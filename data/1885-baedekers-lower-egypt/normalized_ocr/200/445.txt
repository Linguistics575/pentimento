been so raised with deposits of the sand of the desert that the tomb
rather resembles a subterranean roek-strueture than a building on
the surface of the earth. Very little of the exterior is therefore
uew visible, but the interior, which has been eompletely excavat-
ed, is executed with the utmost care, and the sculptures on the
walls exhibit a skill Which is truly marvellous when it is remem-
bered that the mausoleum was erected in the 5th Dynasty, in the
time of the builders of the pyramids M Abusir, that is, aheut 4500
years ago. Both the paintings and the hieroglyphics which cover
the walls are executed in remarkably delicate and ilat bas-relief,
the outlines heing sharp and distinct, while the projecting parts
are at the same time subdued and harmonious. The hieratie
canon (p. 161 ] has already imparted to the human thy1res a some-
what conventional type, notwithstanding their spirited action, hut
there is a refreshing fidelity to nature in the attempts of the art-
ists to represent animals. The painting of the figures is preserved
at places. Each of the larger scenes is presided over by the com-
manding thrure of Ti himself, the proprietor of the tomb, who is
easily distinguishable by his loftier stature. He wears a wig with
the usual looks, and his features were doubtless copied from life,
as ls proved by their resemblance to those of his statue now pre-
served at 13131515 (p. 306 ]. In some cases his chin is prolonged by
a small false beard. Around his Ioins he wears a kind of apron,
carefully folded, and pointed in front, and from his neck hangs a
broad necklace. With one hand he leans on a long staff, and in the

. :5
other he holds his baton of oftiee. Ti hieroglyphic,, as the

inscriptions in the tomh-ehamher inform us (p. 396), was a dign" w
tary of the highest rank in the service of Ra-uefer-ar-ka, IU-ea-
user, and Kaka, monarchs of the 5th Dynasty, He was a'serner'
(companion, adjutant, or el1aiuberlair1) of the king,'enthroued in
the heart of his lord', a'master of the secrets' (yrivy counsellor),
'loviag his sovereign', a'president of the gate of the palace', a
'seeret counsellor of the king in all his royal assemblies', a'seeret
counsellor for the execution of the commands of the king', and a
'president of all the royal works and the royal department of writ-
ing'. He also held a high saeerduta } office at the pyramids of Abu-
sir (p. 370), and he is elsewhere called one of the, chiefs of the
prophets, a president of the sacrifices and puritioatior1s, and a
guardian of the mystery of the divine speech. His wife Nefer-
hotep-s, Who is frequently represented by his side, was a member
of the royal family, but he himselfwas a man ofhumble parentage,
who had risen to distillation by his merit. Iris suns Ti and Tamut
[ Tamuz ] enjoyed the title of yrinces in consequence of the high
rank of their mother. Like other Egyptian ladies of distinction, the
wife of Ti is termed the'beloved of her husband', the'mistress of
the Muse', and the'palm of amiahility towards her l1usbaud'.
