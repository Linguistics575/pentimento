T Irrigation. AGRICULTURE, 71

the late summer or early autumn of the European year. The land
is extremely Fertile, but it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is
sometimes represented to be. Many oi' the crops, as elsewhere, must
oucusionally be followed by a fallow period; others thrive only when
a certain rotation is observed (such as wheat, followed by clover and
beans); and some tields require to be artiMially manurml. Occa-
sionally two crops are yielded by the same tield in the same season
(wheat and saffron, wheat and clover, etc, l. The recent great
extension of the cultivation of the stvg11l'-0'dl10, which requires a
grant deal of moisture, and of the oott0n-plaut, "hich requires
Mtrcmcly little, has necessitated considerable moditityations in the
modes of' irrigation and cultivation hitherto in use. As both of these
crops are ot' a very exlrcustir1g character, the land must either he
more frequently left fallow, "must be artitiiirtly manured. The
industry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are
thus most severely tried, and no imported agricultuml labourers
ronld ever hope to compete with them, as has sometimes been
thought possible. Although tho. homogeneous soil ofthe valley ol'
the Nile breaks up ofits own accord after its irrigation, and requires
loss careful tilling and ploughing than ours, it (warts more uni-
I'unn attention throughout the whole. year, while its' irrigation
involves a great additional amount of labour to Which the European
farmer is quite urtaryeust0med. The increasing use of ortit'w, ial
nmnurem' whieh were formerly but little known, is nllother soun'e
"great labour. As the country is thickly peopled and supports
numerous eattle, there ought to be no lanhk of natural manure; but,
as the dung of the domestic animals IS used as fuel thionghout
Egypt, "here wood is my scarce, that of pigeons (p. TW) is almost
the only kind available for agricultural purposes. An abundant
source of manure is afforded by the ruins of ancient towns, Which
went once built at'nnhakml clay, but now consist of mounds of earth,
recognisable only as masses of ruins by the fragments of pottery they
contain. Out of these mounds, which conceal the rubbish or' thou-
sands of years, is dug a kind orearth sometimes containing as" much
as 12 per cent of saltpetre, soda, ammonia, and other salts. This
manure possesses extremely fertilising properties, but ifused at the
wrong time or place is ye iujurious to the soil.
