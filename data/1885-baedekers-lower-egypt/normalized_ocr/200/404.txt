brown and glaring tracts of sand, interspersed with barren cliffs.
The huge and e, olourless monuments erected here by the hand of
men remind the spectator, like the desert itself, of death aml

embanhmeuts and mounds. hi the direction ot" Cairn runs the long
straight earriage-road. immediately before usrises the Citadel with
the striking mirvarets of the mosque of Mohammad'Ali, while the
1lolsat.tarn hills, which form the chief mass oreolour in the land-
stape, gleam in the morning with a pale gohleu tint, and in the
evening with a violet hue.

The descent of the Great Pyramid is more rapidly accomplished
than the ascent, but is hardly less fatiguing, and the traveller will
