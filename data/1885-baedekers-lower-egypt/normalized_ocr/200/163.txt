degenerate into a body of more empty forms, while he also rejected
their dogmatic teaching as utterly false. Above all he repudiated
whatever seemed to him to savour of polytheism, including the
ductrinc of the Trinity, as'assigning partners' to the one and
only God. Every hmnan being who possesses a capacity for belief
he considered bound to accept the new revelation of 1il1-1siirn,
and every Muslim is bound to promulgate this faith. Practically,
however, this stringency was afterwards relaxed, as the Muslims
found themselves obliged to enter into paeifio treaties with nations
beyond the eoilthut8 of Arabia, A distinction was also drawn be-
tween peoples who were already in possession of a revelation, such
as Jews, Christians, and Sabians, and idolaters, the last of whom
were to be rigorously persecuted.

The Muslim creed is embodied in the words:'There is no God
but God [ Allah ll, and) Iohammed is the prophet of Ciod' (m ilti/ta
ill' Allah, wa s1N) ammedu-rrastit-Att0). This formula, however,
contains the most important doctrine only; for the Muslim is bound
to believe in three cardinal points: (ll God and the angels, [ 2)
written revelation and the prophets, and (3) the resurrection, judg-
ment, eternal life, and predestination.

inscriptions ('Syrle Centrale', pp. 9, 10) it would appear that the
emphatic assertion of the unity "God is by no means peculiar to
Mohammgdauism. As God is a Spirit, cmbraniug all perfection
within Himself, nincty-uine of his different attributes were after-
wards gathered from the Koran, each of which is represented by a
bead of the Muslim rosary, Great importance is also attached to
the fact that the creation of the world Was effected by a simple effort
of the divine Will, [ God said'Let there be', and there was.)

The story of the creation in the I.iorin is taken horn the Bible,
with variations from Rabbinical, Persian, and other sources. God
first created his throne; beneath the throne there was water; the
