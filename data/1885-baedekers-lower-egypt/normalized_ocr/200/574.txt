was this policy mrrried, that when King Baldwin i. ofJerilsnlem wished to
visit Mt. Sinai during the Crusades, at the beginning of the 12th term,
the monks eatreated him to give up his iateatirm. as such a visit might
excite the suspicion of the Muslim rulers, amt prove detrimental to the
monastery. Several Beduin tribes hi the peninsula were cnustituted the

being to escort the caravans of pilgrims, a great nnmher of whom visit-
ed the sacred places in the middle ages. The Egyptian government me.
even during the llmmeluke period, entered into friendly relations with
the monks, partly in ctmanncnce at the pretended letter of the pruyhct
which they possessed, partly for the sake of ensuring the setety of the
Mecca pilgrims, wheee route passed the territory of the monks, and partly
from its desire to protect those places which were regarded as sacred by
Christians and Muslims alike. Down to the reign of ntehemmed'Ali,
whose pntrtmege they enjoyed, the monks were entitled to pert of the
castom-horrse dues levied at Cairo, and that city had to supply them with

insured, psrtly owing to the favour shown to the Christians by the Egyp-
tien government, and partly to the protection of Russia. - Notwith-
standing the amme revenues of the monastery, the number of the mtmks
has greatly diminished. In the 14th cent. it is said to have contained
