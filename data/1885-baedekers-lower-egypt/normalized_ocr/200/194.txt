tian art appears to have been seriously checked in its growth, and
to have entered, after a brief period of tefrloreseenee, on a long era
of what may ho trrrimyd Byxantinism, - and yet in many respects
thp r'.gyptian sculptures merit our highest admiration. The artistic
pffee vapablc of hcing prmiucenl in any given material, such as
granite, "ere always calculated with tho nicest dissrituiuation;
unthing capable of achievement is left undone, and beyond this
nothing is attempted. The smilpton are notable for their knowledge
of miatom for their aucnravy in the delineation of muscle, for
tlmir ski! in portraiture, and for their fidelity in representing
animal lil'u, Of all the Egyptian works the Ilgures of the gods arc
purhaps tho least happy. To us they seem to exhibit a want oftaste
an ] intelligence; but this is perhaps to be accounted for by the fact
that they "cm intended to he worshipped only, and not admired.
That the praetiee of art was very highly developed in Egypt is proved
n tt umoly by the great extent to which the division of labour was
mrriml, but by the that that the artists understood the process ot
rurpyins Iigunw' hy dividing them into squares and nnluulatiug their
prnpaninns so as to ho nme to reduce or enlarge them at pleasurei
