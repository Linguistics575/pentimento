the oldest Hf these inscriptions cannot have been written earlier than the
2nd century 3.0., while the most recent are mnlater than the beginning
of the 4th centv AIL, and that most of them are to be ascribed to the
Iteathen Nehntmns, who adhered to the Saharan rites, and worshipped
the sun, mount and stars, ospeeially .m high mountains, such as Mounts
Serhil and Sinai. No Christian names occur, but many of the writers call
themselves'servants','reverers', ur'pri sts' of the'sua', the'mrrrm', Imd

The S. entrance to the Wtidi Mokatteb, a valley ahout 31/2 M.
in length, is closed by a spur of the mountain of that name, which
our route crosses. Beyond the pass (152011), whence we obtain an
nxnellent survey of the imposing mass of Mt. Scrbil, the route
traverses heights and hollows strewn with small stones. The red
rubble looks like fragments of bricks, and the slopes resemble
dilapidated walls of loose stones.

After 1/ghr, we enter the Wadi Firan, which is here at consid-
erable breadth. This valley, which is probably the most important
in the peninsula, begins above the Oasis of 1'irin, at the base of
the Serbil, and, after describing a wide curve, terminates near the
coast The granite slopes, iltrihing the valley, are not far apart at
places, while in other parts the valley expands to a considerable
width, The grey primitive rock, veiued with rusddish-br0wrr por-
phyry and blaoe diorito, rises in yietnu'squo forms; these veins
run almost invariably from N. to 5. The picturesqueness of the
scene is greatly enhanced by the imposing summits of the barren
mountains towering above the slopes of the valley to the south
At the entrance of the valley, where at the foot of the Jebel Nam"
the small Wadi of that name opens on the left, are several round
heaps of stones belonging to ancient tombs. On our rightnext
