30 GEOGRAPHICAL NU'I'IGE. F'rontiers.,

The boundaries of Egypt in a due S. direction were still more
boldly extended by IsmvCil. They now comprise the "hole course
of the White Nile and the greater part of the river region of the
fl l.ir ot-trhluu, where merchants from Khartfnn had already for
many years possessed settlements and by force of arms had suh-
dued the negro tribes. At the time, ofMohammell uli's death the S.
boundary of the Egyptian dominions on the White bile was formed
by the eoru-noagazines of Er-'Egt and the wharves nea it, situated
about 130 N. latitude, while it now extends to the military station
of Fauira ten the river connecting the Victoria and the Albert
Nyanza), situated about'YN. latitude, so that the whole length of
the empire is now about 2000 English miles. The S, frontier, from
DU-FU to Uerhera, a distance of [ 560 GL, now almost entirely
surrounds the kingdom "Ahyssinia.

Down to 1883 the whole of the vast territory within these houn-
daries was, nominally at least, immediately subject to the Khedivc,
though 1sutsparsely occupied by his comparatively small army, and
it contained no tributary peoples uscdiately subject to him. These
enormous tracts, on the other hand, are utterly disproportionate to
the population, the desert regions are immeasurably more extensive
than the, fertile distriets, and the barbarous and unprofitable'lit-
hahitants far more numerous than the civilised and wealth-pro-
dncing. The geographer and the political eennomist therefore would
vary widely in their description of the real boundaries of the
country. The eountry which (until the most recent events) owned
no other master than the I (lxedive or his representatives is ofim-
mense extent, but the cultivable part of Egypt, which forms the
sole, source of its wealth, is of very limited area, The extensive
dnmiuions of the Khedive which lie to the S. of Egypt proper are
still entirely prMitless, and hence it was that Isma'ii did his utmost
to extend the commerce in this direction, and toimprove the means
of conuminieation,

Thus while lignyt is nominally as extensive as two-thirds of

lussia in Europe, it shrinks to the size of Belgium when the Val-
ley of the Nile, its only productive part, inhabited by a tax-pnying
population, is alone taken into consideration, The total area of the
empire is fully one anti a quarter million square miles, including
that part of the Libyan Desert "high falls "ithiu the western
heululnry drawn from the oasis of Siwu to the west end of Dir-
F't'sr, and which alone measures, 25,000 sq. M. in extent. 0n the
