struck, Curiously enough, the King's Ghamher does not lie exactly
in a line with the diagonal of the Pyramid, but is 113 it. 4 in. to
the li. ofit. Owing to the prodigious weight of the superinemnheut
masses, it would have been extremely hazardous simply to roof the
chamber with long horizontal slabs, but the cautious architects of
C1heops foresaw the danger and relieved the ceiling of the weight
by introducing five hollow chambers above it. The itrst four ft, m,

leaning obliquely against each other. These chambers are a6ec% -.

which were re-opened by Col. Vyse. They are abeutGin. in height
