Vince of Baht el-Abyagl, where in the ease of the Shiliuk tribo,
numbering about one million souls, the proportion of inhabitants
to the square mile is the same as in Egypt proper, The total po-
pulation of the empire, ineluding Dir-hir and liarar, is now esti-
mated at between 16 and 17 millions.

Origin and Descent of the Egyptians. For thousands of years
the banks of the Nile have been occupied by the Egyptians. the
oldest nation known to history, and still exhibiting many of their
ancient personal characteristics unaltered. Notwithstanding the in-
terrninaNe series of immigration and other changes affecting the
character of the inhabitants, the Egyptian type has always predoru-
inated with marvellous uniformity. As Egypt is said to he the
'gift of the Nile', so has the character of its inhabitants been ep <
patently menideti by the influences afthat river. No country in
the world is so dependent on a river which traverses it as Egypt,
and no river presents physical characteristics so exceptional as the
Nile; so, too, there exists no race of people which possesses so
marked and unchanging an individuality as the Egyptians. Itis
therefore most probable that this unvaryiug type is the product of
the soil itself, and that the character of the peoples who settled at
different periods on the bank of the Nile, whatever it may origin-
ally have been, has in due course of time been moulded to the
same constant form by the mysterious iniluenees of the river. In
all countries, indeed, national eharaeteristies ttre justly regarded
as the nature ] outcome ol' soil and climate, and 0F this eomiectiml
no country airords so strong an illustration as Egypt, with its sharply
detlned boundaries of sea and desert, and in its complete isolation
from the rest of the world. These considerations tend to throw
serious doubts on all the current theories as to the origin of the
Egyptians. According to the Bible, Mizraim CMis.rrairn) Was the son
of Ham and brother of Chureun and the Ethiopian Cash; and, us his
name was applied by the Hebrews to Egypt, it is probable that he
migrated with his sousfrom Asia to the banks ofthe Nile. The name,
moreover, of Ludim. his eldest son, corresponds to the word Ilotu,
or Lotu, the hieroglyphic name for the Egyptians. Philologists,
who have discovered points of resemblance in the roots and'1ntl0e-
tions of the ancient Egyptian and the Semitic languages, likewise
come to the conclusion that the Egyptians originally came from
Asia, either by Way OISucz, or across the lledSeat from Arabia. The
