of divinities, whose self-seeking priesthood designedly disguised
the truth, they eagerly welcomedthe simpledoetrines of Christianity,
which appeared so well adapted to their condition and promised
them Sut'eour and redemption. Like Eutyehes, they revered the
divine nature of the Saviour only, in "hieh they held that every
human element Was absorbed; and when the Council of Chaloedou
in .151 sanctioned the doctrine that Christ combined a human with
a divine nature, the Egyptians, with their characteristic tenacity
adhered to theirohl views, and formed a sect termed Eutyehians, or
Monophysites, to which the Copts of the present day still belonur,

the great majority of the belligerents. lhe subtle dogmatic dif-

these professors of the religion of loveY that the defeated Monophy-

After the conquest of Egypt by'Amr the Copts were at first
treated with lenity, and were even appointed to the highest govern-
ment oniees; but they were soon doomed to suffer persecutions and
privations of every description. These persecutions were mainly
xlue to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual conspiracies
against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries
even attributed to them the disastrous coni1agrations from which the
new capital of the country so frequently suffered (p. 242). Accus-
