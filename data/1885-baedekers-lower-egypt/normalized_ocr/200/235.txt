royal castle and another small harbour. The island was so hemed from
being, as it were, a rival of Rhodes. Above it lies the lheittre. Beyond
this is the Poseidium, a eusved promontory which runs out from the
Emperimh (or market-place), and to which Antony added at. embankment

this embankment he erected a royal re dence w ut, l he thitea Thnorriuu1.

Among the hummus. QUARTEIKS of the ancient city we my hrst
mention the Ntser0polts, or eity of the dear ]. at the extreme IV. end,
where there are many gardens, tenths, and establishments for embalming
bodies' tb'trabo,. IO), and 1lhakrotis,'the quarter of Alexandria
situated above the sh ps' magazines' (Srrabo, i. (i), the most ancient
part of the city, and tshierly inhabited by Egyptians. The Bruckium
quarter, whi h wits walled in, (lxld contained the palaces and public
buildings, lay (Ill the mainland between Loehiss and the Ileptastadiam,
while the Jews' quarter was situated to the E. of Leehihs, between the
Sea. and the min street, the E and of which was closed by the Canopit:
gate. ttutside the gate lay the hippedmme, and farther to the E. wss
the suburb or N opo1is. 3U stadih from Alexandria. whieh possessed an
amphitheatre and h racc-course. and where the quiuquennial games Were
eetehmted (Strehe, xvii. C. L, 10).

With regard to the sinems of ancient Alexandria, Strabo (ib. N)
has the following passage; The whole town, indeed, is intersected with
streets practicable res wagons and riders, but the two broadest of them
are there then a. hundred feet in width and cross each other at a right
angle: - This statement. hits been (yor1tirated and supplemented by the
exrxrvatious of 1ralymLi-Bey, who has d' overed traces of h retstaaguhur
network of streets. seven of them running lengthwise, from wisw, to
EALE and twelve bveadthwise, from wa. to 5.5.2, He has also
iden iied the two main streets mentioned by Steehe, the more important
of whieh probably coincided with the modern Rue de la Peste Rosette,
beginning at the Gate at Rosetta, the hheieht Canopus gate, intersecting
the town, and at its W. end deviating from the stcaightline. This street.
is still the most important in the town, and it i probably indebted for
its long existence to the conduit eehstmeted under it at aulezwty peiiea,
which still supplies the cisterns with Nile water. Of the buildings whieh
once ttehked this street a few relies only now exist, but the excavations
have brought to light distinct traces of the old pavement, which consisted
of hteehs of granite, and have established the fact thst the street was
about 45ft. in width, or douhte that of the other streets. Un each side
of the causeway mi foot-pavements with arcades, of whieh, howevort
the traces are bat scanty. - The important mnyss-stveet mentioned by
