On the w. side of the Place Ife1émet Ali (p. 262) is the rail-
way-station for Hclwéu o. 403). From this point a street called
the Salibch runs to the W., traversing the oldest, and now partly
ruined, quarter of Cairo, which was erected by the Tuluhides (p.
102), and is almost exclusively inhabited by the lower Glasses.
About 4-10 yds. from the Place this street is iuterseeteil by another,
running from N. to s., the N. (right) part of which is called the
8tTfiyeh, and the S. (jeft) part the Rugbiyeh, At the beginning
of the Sir1fiyeh, on the right, is a new Arabian Girls' School, and
beyond it, on the same side, is the Tcktyet et-Mtrrtlauru'yth (PI. 36;
F. 3), where the dervishes perform their dances (p. 239), with
a dome adorned with carefully sculptured arabesques. (This street
terminates in the Boulevard Mohammed'Ali.) At the corner
opposite the mosque is the recently completed Sebil of the Mother
af'zlbbzis Pasha CPI. 9-1 ], in marble, rich and eifeetive in general
appearance, but lacking finish in its details. The large school
above it is hardly worth visitinot

We now prceeed in a straight direction to the Place Seiyideh
Zinab, where we show our order of admission at the office of the
Watd. Visitors on foot or on denliey-back follow an attendant with
the key, who leads the way up the direct and somewhat steep path
to the mosque. Those who are driving return to the Sebil of the
Mother of Ahbis Pasha and enter the Ilughtyeh street, follow it for
about 300 yds., and turn down a street to the right, in which, af-
ter about 130 yds. more, we observe on the right the -

was erected by Abu'l-'Ahbas Ahmed Ibn Tulun the independent
governor of Egypt under the suzerainty of kriii'rrrrilrit1 (A. D.
870- An), in the year 205 of the Hegira (A. D. 879 ], on the once
