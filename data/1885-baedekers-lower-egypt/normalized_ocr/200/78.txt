same day only 705,533,389 cubic metres passed Caimi At the
c0nilucruyy of the White and lilne Nile their average volumes are
in the proportion of three to one, but the latter assumes far
greater importance when swollen by the Abyssinian rains, The
lilue Nile is in fact a species of montain-torreut, being linhle to
rise suddenly aml sweep away everything it encounters 011 its ra-
pidly descending course. It is therefom called the Ruhr el-Array,
i. e. the blue,'rlark', or'turbid', in contradistirction to the Balm
el-Abyarj, Lt. the white, or rather the'elear' river, "hose water
descends from clear lakes and is farther filtered by the vast grassy
plains and occasional floating plants through which it passes.
The Blue Nile (together with its eenrljntor the Atham) may there-
fore he regarded as the sole origin of the fertility nfligypt, and also
as the eansc of the inundation, while on the other hand the regular
and steady supply of water afrortled by the White Nile performs the
very important ofiiee of preventing the lower part of the river from
drying n }: altogether in summon The White Nile is not only much
larger than the Blue in avvmge volume, but is, with its tributaries,
meretlmn double thelength. It does not, however, remain veryiong
undivided. Higher up, in 9" Y. latitude, it nweives on the east
side the watersot'the8obol, astrenm descending from the mountains
to the southot'Abyssiniz, and rcsomblingthelilue Nile in character,
thuuzh much smaller. A little farther up, on the opposite side,
the White Nile is joined by the Iinh'r et-G'kusru, or Gazelle River1
l very sluggish stream, fry! by numerous springs rising in the Nyam-
111 am and Kredy regions, hetneen fr" and CPN. latitude. Higher up
the river tMies the n: nneullfuhr el-fv'ehel and is considerably smal-
leri Ill volume, and hmmul iyr'N. latitude it ceases to he navigable,
as it descends in a series "rapids from the Albert Ayunza or
Jhrutun Luke. This sheet of water is eonnm-ted by another riw-1-t
the Womereet', which may he regarded as the continuation ol'tho
White Nile, "ith the Victoria qunul or rkerewe Luke; while the
Shimiju and other s. feeders "the latter may he called the ulti-
mate sources of the Nile.

The Valley of the Nile from liharttun to the Delta, although
from its great length (15" of latitude ] necessarily possessing great
varieties of climate7 forms one long unhrohen tract of country, the
fertilising soil of \\hielI is hrought down by the Blue Nile from the
Abyssinian mountains.

The breadth of theValley of the Nile, including the hanen lam)
immediately ilrtnking it, varies from'H/oto 1" miles in Nubia, and
from M tn'3? miles in Egypt. The banks, of which the eastern is
ealled the Arabian', and the western lhc'lliluan', rise at places
to upwards uf from., resembling two large canal ennlankrncmts,
between which the river has forced its passage through the plateau
of Nubian sandstone' (nhich eucnds to the Gehel F'elseleh above,
