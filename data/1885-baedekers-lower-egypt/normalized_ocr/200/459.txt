Pyramid (comp. p. 150), the lower slopes rising at an angle of "Il',
while the sides "the apex form an angle of AT 50'. The Whole pyramid
was probably nrigineuy intended m have the same slope es the apex (as
the sides of the neighbouring pyramid rise at an angle orw 30'). hut
the lower part was never completed. This pyramid is 206% yds. squm'e
end 321 ft. in height. The interior was explored so early as the year
1600 by Mr. Melton, en English traveller. In 1860 11. Le Brun found e
small chamber in the interim. No clue to the name of the builder has
been discovered. 0n the extreme s. side of the plateau rises a, brick
pyramid, 09 ft, in height, marking the s, extremity of the vast Necro-
polis of Memphis, which extends down to A he Rtmsh (pt 370), towards
the x, e distance of Z3 M. i From Dahsh-'u to the Pyramid of 11tuituu,

Quarries of 1am and Baths of Helwin.

RAILWAY to (ll M.) I } e1w5n in T-l hr. (three 11 piaslres 10. 7 piastres 20,
l piestres 20 penis). The trains, of which there are four daily, start
from the new station in the Place Mehémet Ali. Another train starts
from the Central Station, passes the'Abbtistyeh and the Cartridge Faetury,
joins the first-mentivaert line at Basiittn, and reaches [ lelwin in Ir/s Inn

The railway to Helwan, which was constructed mainly for the
purpose of connecting the great military establishments at Tum
with the Citadel, runs from the Place Miuérnet Ali, in a S.
direction. It skirts the base of the) Iohattam, on the slopes of
Which are the interesting rains of a mosque, and traverses the
burial-grot1nil of the hlamelukes o. 327). To the right lies the
oldest part of Cairo, with the Mosque of Tulm1 o. 265 ]. On
the same side we next observe the Necropolis of Imam Shaferi
Ly. 327), beyond which is the valley of the Nile, with the various
groups of pyramids rising above it (p. 404 ].

Before reaching [ 4 M.) Rasiilin. avillage situated in one of the
angles of a triangular piece of arable land which extends a coil-
siderahle way into the desert, we perceive the Jew h burial-ground
on the left, antiY farther on, the broad l Tsdi et-Tih (p. 339), which
separates the Mohattaui range from the Gebel Tum. Traversing a
tract of desert sand, the line approaches the Nile, on which lies the
village of Tum. A little to the right are the large military estab-
lishments and gunpowder mills, 0n the hill stand the ruins of
an old fort.

91/? M. Jla'eara, a village on the Nile, is noted for the slabs of
stone obtained in the neighbourhood, known as'palattes', and used
for paving purposes in almost every house of the better class in
Egypt. From either Tum or Ma'eara he may visit the Quarries of
Tum o. 405), Which yielded material for the construction of the
ancient temples, and are still worked. Their entrances in the reeks
are visible from the railway. The ride thither occupies 1/glm, from
Helwin 11/2111. It is advisable to bring good donkeys from Cairo,
as the choice at Helwe'm is very limited.

Beyond stat. Ma'gara the line skirts the slopes of the Gebel Tum,
and after ascending a considerable incline reaches the plateau on
Which the Baths of Helwén are situated.
