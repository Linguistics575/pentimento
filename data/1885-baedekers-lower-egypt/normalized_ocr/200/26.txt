as ninlrassvl0rs in other countries, A distinction is sometimes made,
ln-twmn professional ('eensules missi') and commercial tousuls,
the former alone having political functions to t1iseharge; and there

apply for advice to the nearest consul ofhis country, through whom
the authorities are most conveniently approached, and who will

be ubminell without their intervention. The kavasses, or consular
"t1lecrs, also render important services to travellers, for which they
