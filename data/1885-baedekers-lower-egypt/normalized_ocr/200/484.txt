far as Lake Timsglr, as fossil couchylia, particularly varieties ofthe
Spondylus, now occurring in the Red Sea, bat not in the Mediter-
ranean, have been found there. The isthmus, however, is andoabt-
edly of very ancient formation, having been as broad at the time
of the journey of Herodotus (B. C. 454) as it is now. With regard
to the formation of the isthmus we may quote the following passage
from M. J. Schleiden: -

'If we suppose a strait substituted fur the Isthmus, it is not dimeutt
to foresce what would happen. The waves of the Red Sea entering it at
tme and would soon choke it With sand, While the same resuit Would be
caused on the Mediterranean side by the prevalent N. and N.W, winds, the
Etesiun winds ttf antiquity. About halfway between the seas these dif-
ferent agents would come nto eothsion, and throw up a bar of sand, the
situation "which would naturally be a little to the N. of the central
point, as the actitm of the waves rm the b', side would be more regular
than that of the wind on the N., and thus be generally able to penetrate
farther. This bar would gradually be raised by the action of the waves,
and tlud at 2th accelerating me in pvoportiot1 as its growth would
present an obstacle to the mution of the water, until its level came to
he above the level of low tide. The surfnce would then become dry by
exposure lo the air, and the luose Saad, blown about by the winds,
would form sand-hills "the kind found on every sea-lore, In this
way the connection between the sons whhtd at length be cut olf, and the
barrier of Eerisr formed',

The Isthmus of Suez has, from a very early period, formed an
important high" ay between Asia and Africa. A considerable part
of its area was occupied with lakes and swamps, while the higher
points were fortified to prevent the passage of invaders. Near
Pelusiuns, the'key of Egypt', at the E, extremity of the curve
formed by the coast of the Delta, to the SE. of Port Sail,
were situated the passes by which the empire of the Pharaohs
was entered. The high road from Asia skirted the coast of the
Mediterranean, passing I'.hinocolara (the moi1ernEl-'Arish, p.d78),
traversed the neck of land separating the Sirbonie Lake from the
Mediterranean, and led by Casinm [ see below, with the temple
of Jupiter Casius [ the mudem lifts el-Kasr0" 0, and by the
town of Gcnha H, to Pelusium Cp. 435), whence several roads di-
