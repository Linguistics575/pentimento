the NE. and then towards the N.W., and at length reach the Wtdi
SeM'iyeh, at the Eli. base of the Jebel Mtrsa, recognisable by its
chumh and monastery. (Towards the N, the Wgdi Sebé'iyeh is
connected with the W/tdi esh-Shékh by the Wtidi Sadad; comp.
p. 520). A saddle of moderate height separates the Wédi Sebé'iyeh
from the Wiidi ed-Dtr ('vallcy of the monastery'). To the left, on
the preoipitous Jebel 11tiss, which is quite perpendieuhrr at the
toy, we perceive the zigzags "the toad constructed by'Abbis
Pasha (p. 510). We at length descend the narrow Widi ed-Dér
(Shu'aih), and reach the lofty walls of the monastery of St.
Catharine (see y, 503).

(2) THROUGH THE Winn 1.rmmis. Ist Day. For one hour we
ascend a gradual slope with a saline soil to the Umm Sa'ad, where
a spring of fresh water affords support to a few families. The
waterskins should be filled here, and a supply ofdates purchased' as
the desert of Eb-rise, 6 hrs. in width, has now to be traversed. We
follow the read of Abbis Pasha, whieh, though sometimes covered
with sand on the low ground, is always sufiieiotly marked to in-
dicate the direction to the Wadi IJehrin. For the tirst hour or two
we pass a number of dom-palms, but these also at length disappear.
A single seyil-tree stands about halfway, but otherwise we are sur-
rounded by the hot desert, which is at first covered with iiae sand,
afterwards with rubble, and at length with enormous blocks of stone
in the vicinity of the precipitous mountains. The Wadi Wsbriul
is reaehed about sunset. At the point where it issues from the
mountains it is a deep and vexy narrow rocky ravine. A roeky re-
eess close to the entrance affords quarters for the flrst night.

2nd Day. The route through the Wadi Wbrin winds consider-
ably; the formation is granite, in which syenite predominates; it
contains thick veins of hornblende, slate, geenstone, and various
kinds of basalt. The volume of the brook varies according to the
season; its banks are bordered with vegetation The path, Which
ls comparatively good, and yasscs a number ofSinaitie inscriptions,
was to have been converted into a earriagc-roai1 by Llbbiis Pasha,
bat his plan was never carried out. After Ilhhr. the valley di-
vides, and the road of Abbis Pasha leads to the N. At a second
bifurcation (3/4 hr.) the valley expands, and in'/3 hr. more We
reach a eiear and abundant spring, but disagreeahly warm, The,
tarfa bushes and palms hem form an impenetrable thicket. Water
now disappears (10 min.), the vegetation becomes seantier, and
we proceed to cross the yreeigitous Nulcb et-'Efjturi (3290 ft.).
' quarters for the second night are near the W0di Seldf (p. 50il.
On the third day we mach the direct route leading from Mt. Ser-
bil to the Nahh el-lrhwi, etc. (see p. 501).
