500 Route 10. MONASTERY OF SINAI. From Sun.

occupied by the monks, pilgrims, and travellers, are situated on
the first t100T of the houses, which are only one room in depth, their
doors being connected by a long, wooden gallery. The white-
washed walls bear numerous Greek inscriptions, some of which
were written by a monk of Athos, named Cyril, who was formerly
librarian here. The dill'erent buildings are separated by small
courts; one ot these contains a well, and a small group of apricot
trees enclosed by stakes. The low buildings are commanded hy a
lofty cypress. From the cmhrasures in the walls and ramparts a
few small cannons still frown on the now peaceful'8araeens'. 1n
the midst of the buildings is situated the church (see below), with
its handsome tower, adjoining which is the ill-preserved mosque.
The wells yield excelient water, particularly one in a shed at the
back of the church, which the monks point out as the one at which
Moses watered the flocks of Jethro's daughters.

The Chureh of the Tranfruration is an early Christian basilica.
The exterior is uninteresting, In the centre of the W. side, which
forms a kind of facade, a large cross, with a window in the centre,
takes the place of the usual rose-window; and on each side of it
is .1 palm-tree engraved on the stone. - The uhnreh is entered hy
a porch, and a flight of steps descending beyond it, both of which
have been restored, 1n the middle of each of the topmost steps
is aletter of the name of St. James IA-K-Q-B-O-O - We first
enter a vestibule (narthex) with a Byzantine window, containing
a large, modern basin for holy water with small silver eagles.
The, framework of the door leading into the naveis richly decorated
and the panels are embellished with old pictures in enamel, of
small size, The basilica, whiuh we next enter, notwithstanding
the lowness ofits aisles, and the superabundartt decoration yceuiiar
to Greek churches, is not devoid of eifeet. Each of the lofty walls
hearing the entablatnre of the nave rests on thick columns of
granite, covered with stucco and painted green, the capitals of
whieh are adorned with boldly executed foliage. The nailing has
been recently re-painted, and divided into bright coloured sec-
tions containing indifferent medallion iigures of John the Baptist,
the Virgin and Child, and tho Saviour.

The Aisles are lighted by five Byzantine windows on each side,
and are covered by a sloping roof. A coloured Marble Pavement in
the nave now replaucs one of admirable mosaic whiuh was de-
stmyed by Arabian treasare-seckers. Adjoining the third eolumn
on the left side of the nave is a marble Pulpit adorned with pleas-
ing miniatures, which was presented to the church in 1787. Near
the fourth column on the right is the Episcopal Throne, dating from
the last eelrtury, and interesting on account of a representation of
the monastery at that period, painted by an Armenian artist, and
held by figures of Moses and St. Catherine The inscription re-
peats the date 5'27 which is erroneously stated by the monks as
