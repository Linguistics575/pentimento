DOCTRINES OF Fm-Libr. 147



women that the Muslims generally dislike to see them praying or
occupying themselves with religion. The practice of wearing veils
is not oo1rtitued to the Muslim women, but is universal in tho East.
An Oriental lady would, indeed, regard it as an affront to be per-
mitted to mingle in society with the same freedom as European
ladies. Even in the Christian chnxches, the place for women is
often separated from the men's seats by a railing. The peasant and
Reduin Women t on the other hand, are often seen unveiled. The
case withwhich Ii'd-lslim permits divorce is due to 3foliarunied's per-
soual proclivitics. A single word from the husband safiiees to banish
the wife from his house, but she retains the marriage-portion
which she has received from her husband. The children are brought
up in great subjection to their parents, often showing 1110r0 fear than
love for them.

The repetition of Pmnnms tHe times daily forms one of the
chief occupations of faithful Muslims. The hours of prayer (ridtsa)
are proclaimed by the nrueddine [ or muczzins) from the minarcts of
the mosques: (l) Maglirib, a little after sunset; t2)'Ashu, night-
fall, about 11/; hour after sunset; (3) Subh, daybreak; co Duhr,
midday; (5)'Ayr, afternoon, about ri1), hour before sunset. Those
periods of prayer also serve to mark the divisions of the day. The
day is also divided into two periods of 12 hours each, beginning
from sunset, so that where clocks itllll watches are used they require
to be set daily. Most people however content themselves with the
5011010115 call of the mucrlilin: Alltihu. akbar (three times) -Y ushhuds
rln M Wilus itt' AUG; tixhhadu unmt Mubammedu rrasau'th" l
(twice); Zwyyu'ulu-yyaldh (twice); lteyya'ulu'l-fuml; (twice),
Aumm okbar (twice), M it0ha ill'ulldh; i. e.'A1lil1 is great; 1
testify that there is no God but Aiiih, and Mohammed is the pro-
phet of Allah; come to prayer; come to worship; Allih is great;
there is 110 God but Aliids'. This mil to prayer sometimes also
reverberates thrillingly through the stillness of night, to incite
to devotion the faithful who are still awake. - The duty of
washing before prayer is a sanitary institution, and tanks are pro-
vided for the purpose in the court of every mosque. In the desert,
where Water is scarce and precious, the faithful are permitted to
use sand for this religious abiution.

The person pray rug must remove his shoes or sandals and turn
his face towards Mecca as the Jews and same of the (hria'tian sects
turn towards Jiru2iiiii' ortohiards the East. Ma worshipper begins
by putting his hands to the lobes of his cars, and then holds them
a little below his girdle; and he iutersperses his rccitations from
the Igor√©u with certain prostrations performed in agivcn order. On
Fridays the midday recital of prayer takes place three quarters of an
hour earlier than usual, and is followed hya sermon, preached from
the Mamba: (p. 184) by a rcsyc1stable, but unleamed layman,
whose audience sits 011 the ground in rows hcforehim. Friday is not,
