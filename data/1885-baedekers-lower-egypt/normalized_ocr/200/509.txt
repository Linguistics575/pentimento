honour of Osiris, is probably identical with a sheet of water to
the N. of a huge wall enclosing an open space, on the E. side of
which the Wall is upwards of boo yds. long and nearly 65ft. in
thickness. The outline of the lake was probably once elliptical,
but is now of very irregular form. On its S.E. side rise vast heaps
of rubbish, marking the site of the royal palace and the temples
connected with it. It is, however, impossible to trace the outline
of a single building, either here or among the ruins between
the village of Si el-Hagcr and the enclosing wall of the Acropolis,
lying to the N. of the cluster of humble fellilsin dwellings which
have inherited the proud name of Sa'is in the form y. Matiette's
excavations at this spot brought a few antiquities to light, bat
led to no discovery of importance.

FROM ALEXANDRIA To Rusm'm there is l recently opened
railway. skirting the coast, from which short brauch-iincs arc to be
constructed to the various coast fortresses. The famous towns which
lay on this coast in ancient times have entirely disappeared. As far
as SM: Guber (p. 223 ], the second stopping-place, the train runs
parallel with the railway to Cairo, which then diverges to the right,
while out line follows a N.E. direction. The next station of any
importance is (.61/2 M.) Iiamlch (p. 222; the station lies 1/2 M.
to the E. of the town). Stations It2-Molysmmarlhjeh and'Ambet es-

EZ-Mandara the train enters upon the neck ofiand which separates
the Lake of Abukir (Bebirct Miadtyelr) from theMeditorranean, and
reaches (12 M.) Abulgir Co M. to the N.E. of liamieh), an insigni
tiBant village, famous for the naval battle of lst Aug. 1798, in
which the English fleet under Nelson signally defeated the French,
destroying thirteen of their seveateen vessels. The, precise site of
the ruins of Ilemcleopolis and Canopus is unknown. The latter,
Which lay 120 stadia from Alexandria, was probably situated a
little to the E. of Ahuhir. Between that village and an opening in
the neck of land Which separates Lake Edltu from the sea are some
heaps of rains which perhaps belonged to the ancient Canopus.
