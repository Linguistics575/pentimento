These exoresu'euees might he regarded as external prolongations o.
the podentives of the interior, but do not Azorrospoud with them if
position. The architects, however, doubtless intended to suggest
some such connection between the internal aml external orna-
mentation. The domes are eonsmmtrd partly of stone and partly
of brick, the pendants being of stone, or of plaster and lath-work,
and they are sometimes of considerable length. The tinest am
probably those of the Khalifs' Tombs. The greatly elongated domes
of the) Iamcluke tombs have a second dome structure in their in-
terior. The latter, lying mueh lower, supports walls placed in .1
radiating form, which bear the, upper dome. One of these dilapi-
dated tombs (p. 327, affords a good Opportunity of examining this
mode of communion. Neat it thcrc is also a dome with alantem, l
form quite foreign to the customary style of Arabian dome building.

It is l mistake to suppose that the joints are not cut in a straight
direction, bat were formed in curved or broken lines which re-
quired each stone to be an exact counterpart of its neighbour,
This arrangement is occasionally seen in the nase of straight or
Mt segment-shaped plinths, hut even there this kind of eoll-
struction is often merely simulated by means of inlaid marble ot'

The Ninarets [ from the Arabic tnentreh,'a signal' or'signal-
post') are. generally square at the base, tapering upwards, story by
story, until the form at length changes to that of an octagon 0r

skill, and the spectator will not fail to ho, strunk by their graceful
proportions. The highest story is sometimes formed of pilasters,
or columns, which hear a roof, either consisting of one or more
dome-shaped protuberannes with the symbol of El-fsrirn, or ora
simple conical point. They are generally built of substantial ma-
sonry, and contain Winding Staircases of stone leading to the
galleries of the diifemnt stories and to the balmnies between them,
From these last the mneddins summon the faithful to prayer
(p. "The galleries are borne by projecting comices, and the
halnouies by brackets of similar construction. The wooden rods
and hooks at the top of the minarets are used for hanging up the
