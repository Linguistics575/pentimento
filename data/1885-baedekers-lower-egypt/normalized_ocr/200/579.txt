treasury and a selection of comparatively uninteresting modern
MSS. in a room adjoining the arehbislwp's house. Implicit belief
should not be vouchsafed to all that the monks have to say about
the MSS. in the treasury. Thus, some loose pages of a Greek
Bible which they show do not belong, as they assert, to the Codex
Sirrsitieus. The su-called Evanyelium Theodosianum, a collection of
passages from the New Testament, is described without any ground
whatever as a gift of the Plum. Theodosius (766 An), and in
all likelihood does hot date farther back than 1000 AD. It is writ-
ten on whiteparehmeut, both sides of each sheet having two columns
in golden characters. A kind of frontispicee is formed by a series
of elaborate miniatures of Jesus, Mary, the four rivangelists, and
St. Peter. The I'sulleriunum Cassianurn, containing the whole
of the Psalms written in microscopical characters on six leaves, was
not executed by a mm of the 9th cent., named Cassia, but is a
piece of laborious triiling dating from the period of the Renais-
sauce. - In the'Snmll Library' is a copy of the famous Codex
Sinnilicus, discovered by Prof. Tisehermorr, printed most carefully
from the original, and presented by the Emperor of Itussia. Sew
eral leaves of the precious MS. are preserved at the university of
Leipsie, under the name of the'Uudex Frid0rilugustauus', but
the greater part of it is at St. Petersburg, having been purchased
from the monastery by Alexander ll. for a large sum. The codex
contains a complete copy of the New Testament, most of the books
of the Old Testament, a part of the'Shepherd of 11errnas', and the
'Epistle of St. Barnabas'. The great value of the Codex Sinaiticus
is due to its completeness, the care with which it is written, the
consistency of the peculiarities of its text, and, above all, its great
antiquity. "is pretty well ascertained to date from about 400A.1).,
and is surpassed by the celebrated Codex Vaticmms alone in age
and in importance in determining the Biblical text.

On the N. side of the monastery is the Burial Place of the
monks, reached by several dark passages, and eotssistitrgrof a strongly
vaulted crypt. The remains of the bishops are preserved in eoffins,
and those of the priests in a separate put of the vault, while the
bones and skulls of the monks are merely piled up together. The
skeletons of several highly revered hermits are suspended from the
wall. At the gate of the priests' vault is placed the skeleton of
St. Stephauos Ld. 580 ], wearing a skuH-cap of violet velvet. Not
far horn this vault is a well, and beyond it is the rarely used burial-
ground for pilgrims who have diml here.

A flight of steps descends from this court to the *Gurdcn, the
trees of which blossom most luxuriantly in March and April,
presenting a grateful sight in the midst of this rocky wilderness.
It is laid out in the form of terraces, and contains peaeh-trees,
orange-trees, vines, etc., overshadowed by some lofty cypresses.
