A peculiarity of many of the books recently printed at Ihi1iitc is that
smaller works illustrative of the text are printed on the margins of the
pages. The paper used for the purpose is made in Egyptian mmnh
factories, rshieily from nsaiae-shrassr, which accounts for its yc-llow'1sl1 tint.

The great attraction at Ihilil, is the -

MMuseum of Egyptian Antiquities (the traveller bound for
which has only to direct his donkey-boy'lit Antikit'), a magni-
tieent collection, and entirely unrivalled of its kind. A great ad-
vantage possessed by it over all the European museums is that the
places where all its monuments and relies have been found are
known, and indicated by labels, a circumstance of the greatest im-
portance in assisting historical and geographical research, The col-
lection was founded by M. Mariette-Paslug, who died in 1881 and
has been succeeded as director by Prof. Muspero, another French-
man. The keeper of the museum is Herr Bruysch-Bey, who is as-
sisted by M. Boariant.

The arrangement of the museum has recently been entirely
altered, and most of the treasures formerly stored in the magazines
have now found a place in the building itself. Several of the rooms
have been enlarged and an addition has been built to receive the
objects found at DÃ©r el-Bahri, near Thebes, in 1881. Prof. Maspero
has also caused a room to be titted up for monuments of the Creek,
Roman, and Coptic periods.

The Museum is hpen daily, except on Fridays, horn S to 12 and
from 2 to 5; in winter from 8 to 12 and 1 to 4 o'clock (no fee).
Strangers, who wish to make special studies, will receive every
facility from the director and keepers.
