BUILDINGS rm THE MOHAMMEDANS. 170

junction of the walls and ceiling is generally masked by a pendent
cornice, "a hotniee with a frieze for'1rtseriptions, The beams
used in the eoitstruetiouot'the ceilings are generally square at both
ends to a length ot'3-h ft., beyond which they are rounded below,
and frequently carved. The interstices between the beams are
sometimes divided into'coffers'; and proper vxyiterert ceilings also
occur, as in the mosque Sal√©heddin lisuf in the oitadel (p. 26-1 ].
In the comers of the apartments, as well as under the principal
architravos, pendants are generally placed to conceal the angles.
The earliest ceilings appear to have consisted of palm-trrtuks, and
then covered with boardsofsyeamore wood, which were often richly
carved. The space immediately in front of the tibla (prayer niche)
usually terminated in a dome borne by columns. Spherical and
grained vaulting Was used for smaller chambers only; but the
arcades ot'theBarldJs mosque (p. 259. }, with their depressed spher-
ieal brick vaulting, form an exception to this rule. In secular
buildings the use of vaulting is much more frequent7 us in the
case ot' the city-gate Bil; cn-Naer (p. 2S0l and other arched pas-
sagesi The entire ground-floors or palaces are also sometimes
vaulted, and bridges and aqueducts were usually executed in barrel
vaulting, or with pointed arches,

The Decorations generally consist of panelling or Mt paintings,
destitute of structural meaning, while pi1asters, vomiees, and other
architectural embellishments are rare This species of ornamenta-
tion was doubtless originally suggested by the carpets, fringes,
and mats, used by the Arabs for covering their walls. The stalaetitc
c0rb0llings, on the other hand, which mask the union of the vertical
with the horizontal parts of the building, and take the piece of the,
vaulting used in western architecture, are of'amore structural
character; but even these perform no real architectural function.
and form a mere fantastic decoration of the angles of the domes.

. The panel and frieze decorations are either foliage, geometrical
iigures, or written characters. The Foliage is usually shaped in
rectangular relief, with a few incisions to divide the broader
surfaces, The moulding is generally more or less in conformity
with the spirit of the classical style, but in the conventional
atahesques the leaves and other parts of plants of a southern
Climate are recognisable. The Geometrical Figures consist either
of a kaleidoscopie arrangement of constantly recurring fantastic
forms, or of a series of intertwined and broken lines. Lastly,
the Arabic Written Characters with which the friezes are often
decorated, and more particularly the cutie and Sullns characters,
are peculiarly well adapted for ornamental purposes, as they
resemble decorative foliage, although destitute of its strictly sym-
metrical and continuous character. When the writing is em-
ployed for lengthy inscriptions in low relief, the ground on which
it is placed is generally covered with slightly raised arabesques.
