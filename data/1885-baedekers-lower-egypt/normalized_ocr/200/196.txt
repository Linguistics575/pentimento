IX. Buildings of the Mohammedans.
Mosques. Dwelling Houses.
By Franz-Itey, .1t'cllilecl at (tum).

The Mohammedan style of architecture in the vallcy ofthe Kilo
was not, as might perhaps he uprated, the imnwrliate successor
ot'the Egyptian, but was separated from it by that of the early
Chris' inn uponh, n period of six or seven eetrturies. This new style
w not of native growth, but was imported from abroad, being of
Arabian origin, n-onsidcrahly motlitied by the forms of art which the
victorious Arabs found in vogue among the llyzantines, and by
thew, of Persian art of the era of tho Sassanides, Different as the
Arabian buildings at liaghdiui and Cairo may appear from those at
Tunis and in Spain, they all possess certain features in common.
The t'undmnontal idea of all Mohammedan architecture originated
in the nomadic 1m of the Arabs. The tent was the prototype,
alike of the house and of the temple. The walls in particular, with
their carpet-like decoration, and their extensive, nurelieved snr-
raves', remind one of this origin. This style of architecture is that
of the rrekie children of the desert, whose oditices, men after they
had become a settled and stationary nation, continue to convey an
idea of nnsubstautiiuity, and who never attained to a clear per-
m ption of the proportion to ho olrserved between the support and
tlw hunlnu to be borne. This defect is less apparent in cases "here
