during the Mege of t 5 part of the island by the French under Napoleon.
A roM in Turkish taste, ruiling nn Wooden cnluiuns, now covers the well.

Adjoining the Nilometer is a large Kiosque in the Turkish style,
which may be inspected when not occupied by any harem. The
architecture is uninteresting, but the handsome dimensions of the
rooms, which are intended for a summer residence, and the bath
are worthy of notice. The S, verandah of the kiosque airords an
uninterrupted *Yicw of the Nile, with Gizch to the right, the pyra-
mids in the baeksround, and Old Cairo on the left (fee 1 fr.).

Near the N. and uf the island stands the wonder-working tree "the
saint Manglllra, a huge m'hk tree. lhe branches of which are hung with
innumerable rags, Aecnrding to a popular superstition the patient must
thus ufl'em to the saint the Cloth Which enveloped the affected limh, then
encircle the tree seven times, pluck off two leaves, and tie them on the
atrer.ted part with: tnuther cloth.

Leaving the island and returning to the opposite bank, we re-
gain the 0id Cairo road, and after 1,4 M. more we reach the end of
the bazaar of this small town. We then turn to the left, and in
a few minutes reach a street running from N. to S. Turning to
the N. (left), we observe on the right a distinct quarter of the town,
built on the ruins of Fatty?! (p. 241 ] within the precincts of an
ancient Roman Castle, formerly called Babylon. The plan of the
fortress is still traceable by means of the numerous characteristic
remains of the llmnun outer shall. On the S. side, between two
projecting towcrs, is a gateway with a gabled root, now almost
entirely ruined. The. castle is said once to have been occupied by
one of the three lloman legions stationed in Egypt (p. 241), and
to have been connected by a bridge with Ilrh.la and with Gizeh,
where another Roman station is said to have been situated. Proceed-
ing in a straight direction for about 100 yds., and then about
35 paces to the right of a low doorway situated in a hollow on the
w. side and concealed by a small wall, we reach the middle of the
Coptic quarter, where, enclosed by a dense mass of houses, is
situated the much frequented -

Mbd Sergeh, or Coptic Church of fit. Mary. (A Coptic boy may
be engaged as a guide to the church; fee 1 piastre.) According to
a wide-spread belief this church was built before the Mohammedan
eonquest, and a legendary dncumcnt preserved by the Coptic priests
places the date of its erection in the year 320 of the llcgira, fie.
(MO A.D. A glance at the poor materials of the building, however,
with its wooden ceiling and heterogeneous columns, will at once
show the absurdity of this idea. The crypt. however, is undoubtedly
numh uhler than the church and may very well data from'd pre-
Jloharumedan epoch. Abt, Sergeh is probably equivalent tu St. Ser-
gius. According tn tradition, the Virgin and Child after then flight
