The negrrues, who voluntarily settle in l'lgypt in eonsirterabie
numbers, form the xlregsot'the people and are employed in the most
menial "ticuys. Most ot' the negro races of Central Africa to the N.
of the equator are represented at Cairo, particularly in the rank and
file of the negro regiments,

Etluwgraplrurs, liaguiMs, or other seieutith: men who desire to see
specimens of as many diirerent races as pussilile should uhtain an intro-
ductiun to MI Arabian ruercharn in the Gamcliych, whu will conduct

Foreigners are prohibited from taking negro servants out of the

(TY. Tue Although the dynasty of the vieeroys of Egypt is
of Turkish ongm tsee p, 106), a comparatively small section of the
community belongs to that nation, and their numbers appear to be
diminishing. The Turks of Egypt are elrietly to he found in the towns.
where most ofthem are govemmentoNeials, soldiers, and rmyrehants.
The Turkish oflluials are much to blame for the malatlministration
which so long paralysed the rich productiveness of the valley of the
Nile, having always with few exceptions been actuated in their pro-

sequenecs. Now. however, that the government of the Khedive has
adopted more enlightened principles, it has admitted other uational-
ities also to its highest civil appointments. some of which are held
by able Europeans, and under their auspices a brighter future is
probablyin store for Egypt. The Turkish merchants are generally .1

ests, they are dignified and courteous in their hearing, and are
often remarkable for the handsomeness of their features.

in Egypt and the visitors to the banks of the Nile is formed by the
members of the various Mediterranean races, known as Levantines,
who have been settletlhere for several generations, and form no in-
vonsitlerable element in the po ulation of the larger towns. Most of
them profess the Latin form of hristiauity, aml Ambit: has now be-
come their mother tongue, although they still speak their old national
dialects. They are apt linguists, lenrningthe European languages with
great rapidity, and good men of business, and owing to these qua-
lities they are often employed as shopmcn and clerks.'heir ser-
victls have also become indispensable at the eousulates ns translators
of eucnments destined for the native authorities, and as bearers of
