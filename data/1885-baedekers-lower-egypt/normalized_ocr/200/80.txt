having begun to subside, it generally rises again for a short time,
sometimes regaining and even passing its Mst culminating point.
At length it begins to subside steadily, and after a time the dc-
crcasc becomes more aml more rapid. In January, February, and
March the fields from which the water has receded gradually dry
up, and in April, May, and the first few days of June tho river is
at its lowest. The height of the inundation most favourable for
agriculture at the present day has been ascertained by long obsoe
vation to be 23 cnhlts 2 ineln-s (in. about 41ft. "Elm, the cublt
being 2l.3soirrehei), while in the time of lterovlotns 16 cnhits suf-
ticed, and the gotl of the Nile in the Vatican is therefore repres-
cntml as surrounded by sixteen uhildrrn. A single cnhit more is
apt to cause terrible devastation in the Delta. and elsewhere to cover
many tlclds destined for the autumn crop (sutbtiri, p. "M), while a
Mlie, ieney of two cnhlts causes drought and famine in Upper Egypt.
As health depends to a great extent on the regularity of the
pulsations of the heart, so the welfare of the whole of this singular
country is jcopardlscd by a too powerful or a too scanty flow of the
great artery on "hich its very existence depends. An excossivc
overtlow, especially if it does not give notice ufits approach in
due time, is far more disastrous now than formerly, as the extensive
e0ttmr-liehls in the Delta will not bear flooding, antlhavc to be
protected by cmhmlkmcnts.

Egypt is now no longer a vast lake during the inundation as
it formerly was, nor does the ovcmow of the fields take place in a
xlircct manner as is commonly sttyposed. The water is conducted
into .1 vast network of reservoirs and canals, and distributed as rn-
quired (comp, p. 71 l, and spatial engineers are appuintml for their
supervision, The whole of the cultivable land is divided into huge
basins, in which the water intrmlncctl by the canals is maintained
at a certain height until it has sufficiently saturated the soil and
deposited the requisite quantity of mud. Afwr the water in the
river has sulrsided, that in the basins may either be discharged into
the river or into the canals, or it may he used for fill'rng other ba-
sins hing at a lower level. During those operations many 0fthc
villages are connected by means ofenibanlcmouts only, while others
can only be reached by boat, and the whole country presents a
very peculiar and picturesque appearance
