to the Greek truditiun that that pilnt was interred here. S (mbo describes
the p1casure-loving town as follows: -'Canobns is a city which lies IN
stadia. frmn Alexandria, if one goes by land, and is named after the
hclmsmnn of Meuelztus who died there. It conlhins the highly revered
temple of Sempis, which, moreover, works such miracles that even the
must respectable men believe in them, and either sleep init themselves,
"get others to sleep there For them. Some persons also record the
cums, and others the streets of the oracle dreams experienced there. A
particularly remarkable thing is the great number of parties of pleasure
descending the canal from Alexandria; fur day and night the canal
swarms with men and Women' who perform music on the flute and
lieentioas dances in the boats with unbridled merriment, or who, at Cano-
bus itself, { sequent taverns situated on the canal and suited tor such
amusements zmd revelry', - The jars known as'etrstopi' (p. 301) derive
their name from this place.

On the shore of the semicircular bay of Abuhir are several small
forts, and en thepromontory risesalighthouse. The train continues
to traverse the narrow neck oflaud between the Lake of Ahukir
and Lake Edltu beyond it, on the right, and the Mediterranean on
the left. Stations (20 M.) El-llla'ftzliyelt, near the former Canopie
mouth of the Nile (p. W), and (25 MO Edku, a village situated on
a sand-hill to the right. The train finally traverses a dreary expanse
of sand, and reaches Rosetta (p. 449).

FROM Dhsivourfm TO Rosm'm. We ride past several wells and
along the bank of a small actual, traverse some fields, leave the
ruins of ktm, es-Turpin to the right, and in 11/4 hr. reach the
Mtymthityeh Canal (p. 2231, Which lies between lofty banks, and
is traversed by barges and small steamers plying between Alex-
andriaam11losetta. At'toraride of about 10 min. more, we observe,
on the opposite bank of the canal, a long, t1esolue-looking, one-
storied house, which was used for the accommodation of the work-
man employed in cleaning the canal in the reign of Sa'id Pasha.
The canal, which connects Alexandria with Cairo and the Delta,
and at the same time supplies the former city with water from the
Nile (see p. 215 ], was constructed by Mohammei1'Ali in 1819 at a
cost 0671/2 millionfrancs. In the execution ofthe workbeemployei1
theforcetl labour of 250,000 fell√©hin, ofwhom no fewer than20,000
are said to have perished from disease and over-exertion. We fol-
low the bank of the canal, and about Irh M. from Fumm el-Male
mfsdircls reach two rows of remarkably fine trees, under the
shade of which we continue our route. Near Fumm el-Nuluntsdiyels,
where the canal receives its supply of water from the Rosetta arm
of the Bile, its banks are lined with solid brick masonry, and at
this point we observe a number of barges awaiting the opening of
the 1oisk-gates which soparatetheeaual from therivcr. The engines
by means of which animpctus is given to the water so as to cause it
to flow towards Alexandria are four in number, each being of
100 horse power, The large and handsome engine-rooms may he
