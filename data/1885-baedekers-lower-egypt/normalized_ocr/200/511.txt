Rosetta, Arabic Ileshid La Coptic name, TiRushil signify-
ing'city of joy'), the ancient Balbitine, with 19,392'rnhab.,
almost exclusively natives, lies at the mouth of the Bolbitinic arm
of the Nile, which Was also mllml the Taty (Prim), As the Rosetta
Stone Lsee below) was found near Fort St. Jalien, 4 M. to the N.,
it is supposed that the ancient town lay in thatucighhourhood.
_ There is no iuu at Rosetta, bat, if necessary, the traveller may
apply for accommodation to the hospitable Franciscan monks.

Hxsmnv. Little is known regarding the early history uf the town.
It WRh founded on the site of the ancient Bolbltinu, and early in the
middle ages attained nnnsiderable mercantile importance, It Lmntinued
to flouvis3ls down to the beginning Muse present century' bums prosperity
declined rapidly in urmiquence at" the construction of the Maluni'1diyels
Canal and the improvement of the harhonr of Alexandria. The rice
trade of Rosetta is of mmidcmhle impurtauce, and shipbuilding is car-
ried nu with some success.

The town possesses numerous gardens, which yield excellent
fruit. The bill of A1112 Mrmdttr, to the S of the town, which com-
mands a fine view, is supposed by some topographers to have been
the site of the ancient Bolbitiue, The interesting streets contain
many small, but substantial houses in a peculiar, half-European
style, with projecting stories and windows towards tho outside.
Numerous columns from edit'uuys of the heathen and Christian
periods, many of them of granite and some of marble, are seen
lying in various open spaces, particularly one of considerable size
near the river, and a number of others are built into the houses.
The very spacious Mosque of Sak/don is embellished with many
ancient columns, but is otherwise uninteresting, The forti'cations
to the N. of the town are not shown except by permission the
commandant. In 1700 M. Bouchard, a French captain of engineers,
discovered in Hort St. Julian the celebrated Rosetta Stone, which
afforded European scholars a key to the language and writing of the
ancient Egyptians, which had been lost for nearly M centuries,
