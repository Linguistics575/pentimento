ceiling richly coloured and gilded. ln the more important
ate houses we sometimes tind the "ails covered with majoiica.
The naveller will also be struck with the beautiful effects "colour
produced by the Inlaid Work in the hiblrts of eertain mosques Ltlie
tombs of Kalm'm, Tunn, and Igait liey), where marble, porphyry,
mothex-o -pearr, and Venetian enamel have been combinedt 1n
the case of Cabinet Work the culunrs used for inlaying are dark
brown, black (ebony), white Livery ], and bronze. Externally the
dark yellowish stone of which the buildings were eonstrrurterl
produced a naturally pleasing effect, which the architects oe-
easioually endeavoured to enhance by colouring every alternate
couxse ted or black; while important parts were adorned with
marble mosaic, majolieas, paneiling, and giiding. Owing to the
mildness of the climate of Egypt much of the original colouring
has been preserved' but it must not be confounded with the rude
and staring painting of stone facades and marble ornaments exe-
cnted on the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.

The seeniztr editiees, like the sacred, and particularly the
Dwettiny Houses, have also their characteristic peculiarities. The
ordinary town-houses are constructed of stone on the ground-floor,
and generally have an overhanging upper story. The projecting
parts sometimes rest on prllass, but more commonly on beautifully
ruved brackets of peculiar form, and are provided with a kind "
bow-window, which serves the double purpose of ventilatirg the
house and of affording a view of the street to the W0il1e1l concealed
behind the lattice-work. The small perforated and generally octa-
gonal balconies, with round holes at the bottom, are used for cooling
the drinking-water in porous vessels (ltutlehs), whence they derive
their name ofJfuskrebtyers (from shariib, a draught). These bah-
eoriies are rectaugrslar in shape, but theirsides are sometimes arched,
and the Iattree-w0rk round them, composed of turned pieces of
wood, often forms an ingenious and elaborate pattern. The roofs
of these mushrebiyehs usually project in a tent-like form, and
instead of eomices they have pendent friezes cut out of boards.
The anion of these projections with the surface of the wall below
is generally masked by means of riel1ly carved and elegantly waved
mouldings with tasteful rosettes, Above the mushrehiyehs, whieh
rarely extend to the height of the apartment within, there are
usually introduced upper windows, with stucco frames, filled with
stained glass. _ The Corniees of the houses project but slightly,
curving a little outwards when pemlentives are not employed;
and they are almost always crowned with pinnacles, which are often
most elaborately executed. We may also mention the cnriuns form
Ofcoruice seen in the MarnelukeTorubs, where the projecting ends
of the roof-beams are serrated.

While bestowing their full timed of praise on the wonderfully
rich ornamentation and other details of Arabian architecture, one
