IO. Outline of the History of Egypt.
CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.

JNr1touccTioN. There is no people in the world whose history
is traceable to so remote a period as that of the Egyptians. Other
nations may possibly have understood the art of writing :15 early as
they, but no specimens of it have been preserved; whereas the Egyp-
tiarr records, hewn in stone, burned in clay, or written on leather
or on scrolls of papyrus, have sacrired the ravages of thousands of
years. The preservation of these memorials, however, is mainly
due to the dryness of the air in the rainless valley of the Nile, and
to the property possessed by the bot sand of the desert of hermetic-
ally sealing everything committed to its keeping.

The remote dates with Which Egyptian chronology deals seem illy-
thical whenjudged by the standards of Jewish and Christian chrono-
graphers, and particularly when compared with the supposed date of
the crvation of the world; but they are derived from thelists given by
Manntho, which have been confirmed by the monuments themselves.

hthers supplement, the records transeribed by Mauetho for the
l'tolemies, onriuformatiorr being derived from the series of kings'
names inscribed on tablets found at Abydus, Karnak, and Sakham,
from papyrus scrolls, piu1iel1lsrly one in the Museum of Turin, and
lastly from historical and genealogical notices on the walls of tern-
ples and tombs, on statues, implements, amt trinkets. A method-
ieal mode of utilising these fragmentary historical records was first
taught by the learned Prof. Lepsius (d. 1881)
