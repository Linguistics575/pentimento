natural origin. The name signifies'rehearsal', or'resiling', and
the book is divided into parts called Sltrehs. The first revelation
vouchsafed to the Prophet took place in the'blessed night' in the
year 009. With many interruptions, the'sending down' of the
Koran extended over tweuty-three years, until the whole bool:,
which had already existed on'well-preserved tables' in heaven,
was in the prophet's possession. During the time of the'Ahbasidc
khalifs it was amatter ofthe keeuest controversy whether the Koran
was created or Imereated. [ The Oriental Christians have likewise
always manifested a great taste for subtle dogmatic questions, such
as the Procession of the Holy Ghost) The earlier, orMecean v% rehs,
which on account of their brevity are placed at the end ofthe book,
are elssmreterisedby great freshness and vigour of style. They are in
rhyme, but only psrtially poetic in form. In the longer Stirelrs ofa
later period the style is more studied and the narrative often
tedious. The Igore'm is nevertheless regarded as the greatest master-
piece ofArttbic literature. The prayers 0fthe Muslims consist almost
exclusively of passages from this work, although they are entirely
ignorant of its real meaning. Even by the early commentators
much of the Igorfm was imperfectly understood, for Mohammed,
although extremely proud of his'Arabie llook', was very partial
to the use of all kinds of foreign words. The translation of the
Iiortsn beimgprolsibited, Persian, Turkish, and Indian children learn
it entirely by rote.

The Kurftn has been translated into English, French, German" Italian,
and Latin. The best English translatiuns are those of Sale (173;; with
a'preliminary discourse' and copious notes; published in a cheap form
by Messrs Warns & 00., London) and Radwell (London, 1861).

"FUTURE STATE AND PeF, DrssToraTros. The doctrine of the
resurrection has been grossly corrupted by the Koran and by sub-
sequent tradition; but its main features have doubtless been bor-
rowed from the Christians, as has also the appearance of Antichrist,
and the part to be played by Christ at the Last Day. On that day
Christ wilt estahlish El-rsltun as the religion of the world. With
him will re-appear El-Mahdi, the twelfth Imam (p. 153), and the
beast of the earth (p. 14?), while the peoples of Gog and Magog
will burst the barrier beyond which they were banished by Alexander
the Great Cy, MO, The end of all things will he usherediu by the
trurnpet-blasts of the angel Asrifil; the tlrst of these blasts will kill
every living being; a second will awaken the dead. Then follows
the Judgment; the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge of a
hair's breadth, while the wicked fall from the bridge into the abyss
of hell. Some Muslims believe in a kind of limho, like that of the
Hebrews and Greeks7 while others maintain that the souls of the
dead proceed directly to the gates of Paradise. At the Judgment
Every man is judged according to the books of tho Ieeording angels
(p. 142). The good have the book placed in their right hands,
but it is placed in the left hands of the Wicked, bound behind
