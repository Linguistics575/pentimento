they possess no boats or other apyliauees, with the exception of
spears and laiuliug-uets, but merely "elrthyophagi', who pie ]: up

ally they make .1 price of turtle's eggs, and sometimes succeed in
reaching the sandy islands of the Red Sea where the sca-swallow
(Sterne) Jays its eggs, This poor mode of life at course has an in-
t1uenee on their mental capacity, which is not of a very high order;
but they are intelligent in their own affairs, and remarkably skiliul
traukers, so much so that they are often employed by the government
in pursuing criminals. They are nominally Mohammedan, but
they do not pray, or keep the fast of, Ramat1in, or make pilgrir11agtys,
except on rare occasions. Nor do they, like orthodox 11oharnruedans,
fear'ginn' and'glsr1ls', but they permit polygamy, observe the rite
of circumcision, and worship saints.

Besides the Bega, there are numerous Beduius who inhabit the
Steppes and deserts belonging to the region of the Nile, but beyond
the limits of Egypt, and range as far as the t0niines of the heathen
1r0gr0-raees an the left hank of the Nile, nearly to J' N. latitude;
but h ith these we have not atpresent to deal. Among the Arabian
lleduius of the North, there life three important tribes in the pen-
iusula of Mount Sinai: the Ter0bigin, who Carry on a brisk caravan
traffie between Suez and Cairo, and claim territorial rights as far as
the banks of the Nile near Basitin above Cairo; the TtMya, who
occupy the heart of the peninsula, between Suez and'Al.calra; and
the thnvftrkeh or EC-'Araglsiv, to the north of the latter. In Upper
Egypt, besides the Ababdeh, the only lieduins who occupy the
eastern haul: of the Nile are the Beni Mr.set and the At0ni, or
llmvdddt, who, however, have now settled on both banks of the
Theban Nile valley and are gradually blending with the follUtiu,
and the Mttriseh (about 3000 in number), Who dwell in groups
among the limestone mountains between Suez and Ifeneh, where
there are good pastures at places. Most of the Arabian Reduius,
on the other hand, who belong to Egypt, eonfiue themselves to the
westerubank of the Nile. They occupy the whole of this side of the
river from the Faytun as far as Ahydus mear0irgell, and it is mainly
with their aid that communication is maintained with the western
oases, peopled by a totally different race (p. 65), who till the ground
and possess nu camels, being probably allied to the Barbers of
Northern Africa Cone of the numerous Libyan tribes mentioned
in ancient inscriptions ].

The Beduiusof the North Isavcinherittyd with comparative purity
the fiery blood of the desert trihes, who achieved such marvellous
exploits under the banner of the prophet, but the traveller will
rarely come in contact with them unless he undertakes a Journey
across the desert. The loiterers wlro assist travellers in the ascent
of the pyramids and pester them to buy antiquities, whioh are
generally spurious, call themselves Deduins, bat, even if originally
