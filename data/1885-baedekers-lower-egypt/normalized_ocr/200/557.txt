is made, half-a-day').

The Mines of 1kaghtsra. The brown and briek-rcd slopes of
the Widi Maghara rise precipitously to a considerable height. They
belong partly to the sandstone, and partly to the granite formation.
The mines are situated on the slopes on the N.W. side, about
li5 ft. above the bottom of the valley. The traveller has to
scramble over heaps of rubble before reaching the broad but low
openings of the mines, which seem once to have been protected
hy a gallery, new scarcely traceable. The shaft penetrates the rock
to a considerable depth, being very wide at first, but afterwards
contracting, Numerous pillars have been left for the support of
the roof; old ehise1 marks are stiI1 ohserrable, At many p1aees
the reddish stone contains small bluish-green, very impure tur-
quoises, which may easily be detached with a penknife. These
stones lose their colour entirely after a few years. On the route to
theWidi Firth (p. 494) the Deduius frequently offer for sale large,
but worthless, turquoises at exorbitant prices.

Small pillars with hieroglyphic inscriptions still commemorate
the period when the mines were worked for the beueiit of the
Pharaohs, On large smooth surfaces of theroeky walls these ancient
monarchs have handed down to posterity, by means of iip1res and
writing7 the fact that they conquered the Meutu, who inhabited
these regions, and provided for the wants of their miners, A
gigantic Pharaoh is represented grasping the necks of a number of
the vanquished with one hand, while with the other l1eistrandi le
iiig a weapon (khopsh). Sam: iiiises are also represented, and t'estiva1s,
and a visit paid to the mines by insyectors ofhigh rank. The oldest
king named here is Snefru (p. 523j, the first king of thellth Dynasty.
The next are Khufu Theaps, p, 86), the builder of the Great
Pyramid of Gizeh, another monarch of the 4th dynasty; Sahura,
Kaka, Raeuuser7 Menkauhor, Tatkara (Assn), of the 5th Dynasty;
Pepi-Ueriva and Neferlrara, of the 0th Dynasty (p. 87); 1Js0r-
tesen H. and Amenemhm IH., of the 12th Dynasty. During the
domination of the Ilyhsos the wines were neglected; but after their
expulsion, the working was resumed hy Hatasu, the energetic sister
and eo-regent of Thothmes 111., who has caused her ships, return-
ing siehly-2ulen from Arabia, to be represented at DÃ©r eI-Bahri
(Thebes). There is also a pillar here dating from the time of
Ramses IL, but no monument now exists of the reign of his son
3rcreuptah, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, nor of the later kings.

The mineral obtained here is called illn/kut in the inscriptions. It
was of a decided green colour, and is elsewhere represented in hats of
this mm shape, and marked'genuine' to distinguish it from the'imi-
tetion'. The results of the careful researches of Lepeins have 21150 been
"oaths-lee by Professor Creduer's geological investigations. The genuine
nmfknt, which dues not mumx' here, was probably the emerald, while
the inferior quality, which WM nftun imitated, was malachite, verdigris,
green smut, and the green colour prepared from the last. The imitation
