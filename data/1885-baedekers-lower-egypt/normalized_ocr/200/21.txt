"shall now speak atyreutar length of
Egypt, us it truntaims mare wanders than
(my ulher land, and is pr'e-emieeet above
an the auunn'ies m the world for works
that one can hardly describe."

HERODOTUS (13.0. 456).

At the close of let century Egypt was in a great measure m-
discovcted by the French savants attached to Bonaparte"; Egyptian
expedition. Since that period it has attracted the ever-increasing
attention of the soientulo; its historical and "elueologiesl marvels
have hocn gradually unveiled to the world it is the most ancient,
and yet at one time the most civilised country of antiquity;
and it therefore cannot fail to awaken the profouudest interest in
all students of the history and development of human culture

Like other countries of the far East, Egyyt possesses for the
'Frank' traveller the twofold attraction of scenery and history. To
the first category belong the peculiar charms of its Oriental climate,
the singularly clear atmosphere, thewondert'ul colouring and effects
of light and shade, such as axeunknown in more northern climates,
the exuberant fert' ity of the cultivated districts contrasted with the
solemn, aWe-inspi mg desert, and the manners, customs, and ap-
pearance of a most interesting, though not always pleasing, popti-
lation. At the same time Egypt is pre-eminent among the Coun-
tries of the East, and indeed among those ofthe whole world, as the
cradle of history and of human culture. At every step we en-
counter venerable monuments which have survived the destructive
'1r1iluNtees of thousands of years and the vandalism of invaders and
conquerors, and which are executed on so grand a scale, with so
much artistic skill, and with such historical consistency, as at
once to excite our highest admiration and command our most pro-
found respect.

Owing to its distance from the homes of most tmvcllers, and to
the expense involved in exploring it, Egypt will never be overrun
by tourists to the same extent as Switzerland or Italy; but it is now
reached without difileulty by one of the numerous Mediterranean
steamboat lines, and increased facilities are afforded to travellers
by the recent construction of railways (p. ll) within the country
itself, while its unrivalled attractions abundantly reward the enter-
prising traveller and supply him with a subject oflife-long interest.
