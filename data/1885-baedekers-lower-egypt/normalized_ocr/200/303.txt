Cireessinn hlemeluke dynasty ef the Burgites (from the Amhio burg, or
castle, end so called from their service in mrtresses), ascended the throne
in Nov, 1412. His reign Wins el1refly nccnpied with vietorhms campaigns
against his unruly Syrian srasssls, in which he was greatly rtided by the
military talents of his son Ibrahim. He wits it man orweuk constitution,
and the early death of ihrahim is said to have accelerated 3
while some authors state, on the other hand, that he tensed In him to
be poisoned from jealousy an account Of his greater popularity nuniyed
died on 13th Jan, 1421. Although,: tccurding tu Egyptian l1istorirms, he
died very wealthy, his eoti'ers did not contain money enough after his
death ta defray the expenses of his funeral, all his property having heen
carried off by his emirs. while no one cared fur the dead body, Though
successful in his foreign policy, he had neglected to secure the good will
of his penpie. His emirs were never sure of their lives, mztuy of them
having been imprisuned er executed on mere suspicion. As most of the
public ofliees Were sold to the highest bidder, his subjects were oppressed
and maltreated by his judges and urr1Mals, who sought to indemnify
themselves by practising all kinds ot' extortion. Notwithstanding all
the misfortunes he brought upon Egypt by his ma1admiuinrratron and
cupidity, nueiyed had no lack of pstusgyrists, who remembered only that
he was at pious Muslim, that he associated much with sehoiers, that he
Was distinguished es a therMgisn, an orator, and a poet, and that he had
founded at mosque, e l1ospitrl and a mcdreseh, or theological school. On
several ete: ions, after having perjured himself with e view to compass
the destrnetmn ot' his poneats, he spent several days in it dervish mou-
astery, attended the mi; _ end lauded the monastery with presents. Like
the der' es, he usually were nothing hat a. woollen robe, and to prove
his humility he commanded the preachers to descend one of the steps of
their pulpits When they had oeession to mention his name. Towards
rel'sgtrudsts of other ereeds he Was intolerant in the highest degree. He
exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews, and he rerenactcd
and rigorously enfnrced the snmptnery laws uf'0nvar (A.H. (Bi-M),
Mutttwakkil (8:19-50), the Fatimite Khalif Hakim (9964020; see p, 27N,
and Sniten hlohemmed en-Nasir (MB-IMI; y. 277). Not only were the
celnurs to be worn by the Christians and Jews prrssoribed (the enstnrne
of the former being dark hlae, with black turhans, mud n wooden emss
weighing Ntm. hung round their necks; that ef the letter, yellow, with
black turbens, and a black hell hung from their necks); but the Fashion
or their dress and length of their turhans, end even the costume of their
women, were so regulated as entirely to distinguish them from the Followers
of the prophet.

The handsome bronze gate at the entrance originally belonged
to the mosque of Sultan Uttsan (p. 260). The plan ot the mosque
resembles that of the mosque of'Amr (p, 324); bat this cdifieo is
richer in its details, although without any strongly defined vslsarae-
teristics. Here, too, columns of many different kinds have been
employed. On the right, by the Ma.kiitira, is tho mausoleum ot the
sultan, and on the left that ofh'is family. The sanctuary is separated
by a tailing from the inner court (Salli) cl-Chimp), which is shaded
with acacias and sycamores. The ruins on the S. side are those of
a public bath which was formerly connected with the mosque, but
its plan is scarcely now traceable. The mosque has three minarcts,
