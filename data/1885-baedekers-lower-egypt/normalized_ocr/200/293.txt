lofty and graceful miuarets are so conspicuous from a distance as
to form one of the landmarks of Cairo. The building was he-
gun by Mohannned'Ali, the founder of the present Egyptian dy-
nasty, on the sire of a palace which was blown up in 182.1; and
in 1857 it Was partly
completed in its present
form by Sarid Pasha (p.
107). In plan it TO-

baster used for the in-
erustation of the ma-
somy consists partly of
blocks, and partly of
slabs, and was obtained
from the quarries near
Jeui Su√©f, which were
known in ancient times,

used and forgotten. The
