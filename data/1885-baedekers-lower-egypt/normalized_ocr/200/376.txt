Ihand Point de l'hgulla (where we observe the Sebii of the mother of
M-Khedive Isma'il on the left; Pl. OT), leave the new guard-house on
the left, odtlreufollowthe Jtoutedet'Abbasieh. which sooninelines
a little to the left. A few years ago this road was Mnkerl with
large heaps of rubbislr, but these have now given way to villas and
gardens, which extend to the Bah 1Jasaniyeh. The road is also
pleasantly shaded by the iehhok trees (p. 76) planted here some
time ago. Immediately after orossing the Klmlig (eity-eaual),
the'Abbisiyeh road skirts the old mosque of EF-pthir LPI. 71),
a large square pile of buildings, which was called by the French
Fort Sulkot'slcy, was afterwards a government bakehouse, and
is now a guard-house, A few paces heyond this building we
reach the (right) Bah llasaniyeh, through which the route to'Ab-
bisiyeh lay before the completion of the new road (and which,
being shorter, may still he followed by riders or walkers). Beyond
this gate the carriage-road runs towards the XE.Y skirting the
desert. At the beginning ofit, on the left, is the slaughter-house.
A road to the right leads to the pumps of the water company.

A few hundred paces farther on, the road divides again. The
branch to the right, the old Suez road, leads to an uninteresting
viceroyal cl1iteau at the base of the Gebcl el-Alnnur (p. 337), the
Meent of which is recommended.

of houses and cottages, founded by'Abhis Pasha in 1841), in
order to afford suitable accommodation for the Ilcdtlin sh√©khs
whose friendship he was desirous of cultivating, and who objected
to enter the city itself. A large palace which formerly stood here
has been replaced by barracks in the most modern style, besides
which there are numerous older barracks and a military school
with a g } muastie-groand. The English troops are at present en-
camped here. Near the last harmak on the left is a palace of
the ex-khedive's mother, and a little farther on, also to the left,
rises the meteorological and astronomical Observatory, At the
end of the houses of'Ahhisiych begin the new gardens which have
been reclaimed from the desert. The road crosses two railways,
pa the village of Kubbeh Heft ], intersects beautiful orchards
and vineyards, and leads under handsome aeaeias and past numer-
Olh sa'iychs to the Palace of Khedive Tew/T. The vineyards,
