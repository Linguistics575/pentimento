Bazaars. CAIRO, J. Route. 255

Most ofthe booksellers are also acholm's, but they are not so fenztticnl
as their brethren orDamaseus, who sometimes decline to sell their books
to Christians. Seated on their mas.yahas are frequently to be found va-
rious other members of the learned, or would-be learurul, world, who
spend whole days here in interminrrh1e co0oguies Hume of the hook-
sellers sell these works only Which they have themselv 5 published,
while others keep an assortment of books from the printing-less of
1'rtli'rl.c itnrl others (p. 291). As the prices vttry greatly in accordance with
the demand and other circumstances, and there is no such thing as a
fixed publishing price, purchasers should always endeavour to ascertain
beforehand the true value of: my work they wish to bay. As in the
ease of many other wares, the line between new and seeond-hand banks
is not so strictlv drawn in the Eztst us in Europe. The buuksellers gen-
erally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to refresh their memories
regarding the state of their stock. The igarfm, which is shown very rc-
luctantly to non-Muslims, is generally kept under lock and key, or at
least separate from the other books. The books are not arranged side
by side as in European shops, hut piled up in a Very inconvenient fashinni
llituy of them are sold in loose sheets, in which case the purchaser
should see that the Work is complete, as gaps are of frequent occurrence.
The bindings usually consist orieather and pasteboard. Valuable books
are often kept in cMes of red sheepskin, out of Which they are drawn by
means of a, loop. - The Wnrkxuanship of the buokbiaders, who like other
Oriental artisans work in the open street, is generally cheap itnll durable,
Red is their favourite colour,

At the point where the street expands a little, before reaching
the handsome W. entrance of the El-Azhar mosque (p. 287), we
observe several houses with picturesque mnshrehiyehs (p. 181).
The next lane to the left leads us avross the Rue Name, the pro-
longation of the Muski (passing a large new school at the corner to
the right), towards the large new minaret of the Iiasan√©u Mosque
(p. 202). Opposite to it, on the let' is a gateway through which
we enter the Khan el-Khalili (1'1. c 2), which Unce formed the
centre of the commercial trsffiry of Cairo. This building, which is
said to have been founded so early as the end of the 13th cent. on
the site of ruined tombs of the Khalifs by El-Ashrat'hylibeddin
Khalil (1290-4) 3), one of the Be ] tte Mameluke sultans, forms a
distinct quarter of the city, and is intersected by a main street and
numerous erosr4aiuss, formed by long rows of stalls of tradesmen
end artizrtns, all covered overt This is the headquarters of the silk
and carpet merchants and the vendors of trinkets,

The usual price of a light k'etiye8 (shawl fur the head) is 12-14 re,
and of one of heavier quality, with red and yellow stripes ttnd interwoven
with gold unread, 20-25 fr, The fringes are generally loosened and
vljusted after the completion of the purchase. Many oi the sarcailed
Unmascene silks, and particularly the lighter ken'iyehs in pleasing co-
laurs, are manufactured at Lyons and nrerehi. The table-tyweN of red,
blue, or black cloth, emhruidered with euianred silkf35-100F), are well
worthy of notice. The letters with which they itre adorned rarely hare
any meaning.

The Khan Khalili contains two large CARPET BAzAAns, one
(the smaller) immediately to the right of the entrance (see above),
and the other at the W. end, to the left, a little before we reach
the broader and better lighted Shh en-Nahhhsin (p. 206), The
latter of these two hazaars, established in the court of a building
