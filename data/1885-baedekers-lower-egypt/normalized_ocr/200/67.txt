defects to which we have alluded, the Coptic community boasts of
a number of highly respectable members, and in spite ofthe frequent
heavy contributions levied from the sect by previous governments,
it contains several wealthy landowners and merchants, some of
whom we shall hereafter have occasion to name.

3. BBDUINS. Bedu (sing. bedawi) is the name applied to the
nomadic Arabs, and'Arab to those who immigrated at a later per-
iod and settled in the valley of the Nile. They both differ mater-
tally from the dwellers in towns and from the fell√©hiu,'ho
usually call themselves'Sons of the Arahs' (On ei-'Arub). The
subdivisions of the Beduin tribes are called Kabileh (whence
the name Kabyles, applied to some of the Algerian lledru'nsL
Though differing greatly in origin and language, the wandering
tribes of Egypt all profess Mohammedanism. Again, while some
of them have immigrated from Arabia or Syria, partly in very
ancient, and partly in modern times, and while others are sup-
posed to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the territories claimed
by them (as the Berbers of N. Africa and the Ethiopians or Blem-
myes of Nubia), or former dwellers on the Nile expelled from their
homes by foreign invaders, they all differ greatly from the stationary
Egyptian population; and this contrast is accounted for by the
radical ditferemm between the inilueutyes of the desert and those of
the Nile valley. The Beduins may be divided into two leading
groups: Cl) Bcduins in the narrower sense, i. e. Arabic speaking
tribes, most of whom have probably immigrated from Arabia or yo'y-
ria, and who occupy the deserts adjoining Central and Northern
Egypt, or who are to he found in different regions of Southern Nuhin
as a pastoral people; L'2)'Nga', who range over the regions of Upper
Egypt and Nubia situated between the Nile and the Red Sea. and
extending to the frontiers of the Abyssinian mountains (their ter-
ritory being known as'Edhaij. To these last the name of Ethio-
pians may as accurately be applied as that of Arabs to the first
group; and they are believed by Dr. Lepsius to he the descendants
of the Blemmyes, who occupied theNubian part of the valley of the
Nile down to the 4th cent. after Christ, when they were expelled
by'Nubian' invaders from the south. The second group consists of
three different races, the Hademlou, the Rishurin, and the Ababdch.
The 1ast-naraed, who are widely scattered in the valleys of the
desert between the tropics and the latitude of Keneh and Ifoyh,
and who lead a poverty-stricken lite with their very scanty stock of
camels and goats, are those with whom alone we have to deal as
inhabitants of Egypt. Though closely resembling the other Bega
tribes in appearance, the Ahnbdeh (sing. Abidi, the Gebadeiot
Pliny) possess an original language of their own t'to-bedyawiyoh0,
which, however, they have long siure exchanged for bad Arabic.
