PREFACE.

The present volume is the seeoud ofa series of JUND-
BOOKS FOR TUE EAST now in course of preparation, and de-
signed, like the Editor's European handbooks, for the guid-
ance of travellers.

The materials from which the first edition of the IIV
book for Lower Egypt was compiled were partly furnished
by Prnfessar G. Eben of Leipsie, while articles on special
subjects, as well as many additions and emendations, wore
contributed by a. number of other writers. The Editor is

imperfections, and the Editor will therefore gratefully avail
himself of any communications which his readers may kindly
contribute, as many of them lvave so generously done in the
case of his European handbooks. As Oriental life and seenery
differ widely in many respects from European, and mu iurrr1-
ly be appreciated without seine previous study, the Editor
Ms endeavoured to supply the traveller with all the most
necessary preliminary information, believing that it will be
acceptable to most of his readers, although somewhat beyond
the province of an ordinary guide-book.

The MAPS and PLANS have been an object of the Editor's
special care, as he knows by experience how little reliance
can be placed on information' obtained from the natives, even
when the traveller is conversant with their la gunge. The
maps of the Handbook are based upon the large maps of
