and a disk, on a lotus ilower, and attended on her right and left by
female geuii with long wings. Each of the genii bears in her
hand the pen of the goddess of truth. The ruins of the temple are
now so confused that it is impossible to form even an approximate
idea of its original form, A number of blocks resembling mill-
stones show that the shafts of the columns were round. The
capitals were embellished with the Hathor mask. On the N. side
lies an unusually large capital, in granite, and upwards of 7ft, in
circumference, Numerous remains of pillars and arehitraves also
still exist. The steps which led to the roof of the temple, and pro-
bably resembled those at Deudem and Edfu, were also of granite.
A huge block is still to be seen here with four steps attached to it.

The ruins of Mendes, 11 M, to the E. of Mamyha, whence they
may be visited in one day, have recently been excavated, and
it is not unlikely that they may afford a rich spoil to the learned
explorer.

The land IS carefully cultivated in the neighbourhood of Mangura,
and we observe a number of steam engines which are used for the
irrigation of the soil. The train stops at (14 M.) Shirbfn, an
insignificant little town built of crude bricks. The host stations are
JMs el-KhaFty and Kafr er-Brs.t.tikk. The latter lies in a moaoton-
ous, sandy plain, cstcuding as far as Lake Burltts, and covered in
summer with crops of water-meiosis. An important melon market
is held here in July. The siulway-station of Damietta lies on the
left bank of the arm of the Nile (ferry in 5 mru.; 1 fix).

40 M, Damietta, Arabic Jhtmyii.t, situated between the Da-
mictta branch of the Nile and Lake Menzaleh, about 4 M. from the
sea, possesses a harbour, annually frequented by about 500 vessels
of an aggregate burden of 40,000 tons.

interior of the town, however, by 110 means fulfils the traveller's

many of the houses seem to be uninhabited; and new eiillees are
