part of the valley of the Nile, who form the largest foreign element
of the community, antlwho never entirely assimilate with it, as the
Nuhians make it a rule never to marry Egyptian wives. The bmubi-
nns, on the other hand, speak slightingly ofthe Egyptians as'Wod-
vr-l'vtC, or sons of the Nile valley (pomp. p. 31). The two races
entertain a great dislike to each other, and their dispositions are
t'undamentallydilferent. The Nuhians are inferior to the Egyptians
in industry and energy, especially in tilling the soil, and also in
physical strength; and they are moresuperstitions and fanatical, as
is indicated by the numerous amulets they wear round their
necks and arms. They are, however, superior to the Egyptians in
cleanliness, honesty, and subordination, and possess a more highly
developed sense of honour. The Nubian doorkeepers who are to
be found in all the mercantile houses of Alexandria and elsewhere
are noted for their honesty, The traveller must not expect to find
them very sincerely attached or grateful, any more than the native
Egyptians (comp. pp. i'?, 20, bat as servants they are certainly

the Nile are not all strictly Nubians; for in the. southern parts
of that region a colony of Sh√©glyeh and other Arabian tribes has
settled in comparatively recent times. The genuine Nubian: Ca

valley of the Nile from Gehel Barkal near the fourth cataract
down to the first cataract, and are divided in accordance with the
principal idioms of their language into Mamie, Kentis, and Don-

tongues, and Dr. llrugsch is of opinion that it may aiNril a clue to
the interpretation of the still undeeiphered Ethiopian (Mero'itie)
inscriptions of the Nubian part of the Nile valley. Dr. chsius,
on the other hand. who has published an admirable work on the
subject, maintains that the'to-bodyawiyeh' language of the liega
(p. 45) is more likely to be cognate with that of the inscriptions,
as he believes that the Blemmyes, the ancestors of the Begs, were
the original inhabitants ofthe region in question, and were expelled
by the handsome and intelligent'Naba' nogroos from the district to
the S. of Kordorin, Friedrich Miiller places the Nuba tongue in
n separate category along with the dialects of a. few other tribes in
different parts of Africa, and there is certainly much to be said in
favour of this distinction of it from the languages of the llamitie
races on the one side and the typical negro races on the other.
