In the subterranean part of the Egyptian Serapeum, hewn in
the rock, where the Apis bulls were interred, there were found no
fewer than 3000 monuments, and it was ascertained that the hulls
were interred in different ways at different periods of Egyptian his-
tory. No Apis sarcophagus dating from the pirirnasva1morurrtsl1y
was discovered, and it would seem that the first placed here dates
from the reign of Amenaphis Ill. (18th Dynasty). 011 the surface
above, a chapel was erected ia honour of each bull, while his
remains were deposited in one of the square chambers hewn in the
rock, to which a sloping passage descended from the chapeL No
trace of these chapels now remains. Every Apis Was interred in
this way down to the thirtieth year of the reign ofllamsesIf. (19th
Dynasty) after which the vaults began to take a different form. A
suhtenanean gallery, about 11 (1de in length, was now hewn in
the rock, and flanked with rudely excavated chambers forty in
number, which IN ere walled up after having received the remains
of the sacred tyall. This was done down to the twentieth year of
the reiprofPsammetikhl., tlle first king of the 26thDynasty, when
four of the Apis vaults fell in, and another site was chosen for a
new series of tombs. In the thirty-third year of that king's reign
a new gallery, flanked as before with vaults, was accordingly
excavated for the purpose, These vaults, which are much more
carefully constructed than the two series of earlier dare, are still
accessible, while the others have long since been iilled up,
