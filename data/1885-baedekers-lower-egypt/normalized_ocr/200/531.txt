and none of those small relics of the period of the Pharaohs, which are
usually found so abundantly among the ruins of Egypt, have been dis-
covered here. This was perhaps the site of the ancient utmyeme, a town
which probably sprang up on the ruins of a Roman military station,
situated on the extreme western side of Egypt. On the outskirts of the
ruins ere walls which perhaps belonged to gardens; there mustaish have
been once an aqueduct tor the purpose or supplying the inhabitants and
their gardens with water.

From Ka Kmatt to Dhneh is one day's journey. Dimeh is
situated opyo I e to the point at Which We approach the lake from
f5enlotlr. The scanty ruins on the s. hank of the lake (Et-tlam-
vutrrus, eta ], are not worthy of l visit; but the ruins ofDimeh, al-
though no'1nsia'1ptions have been found there, present some attrac-
tion. A street, 400 yds. in length, formerly embellished with figures
of lions, loads to a platform on which an important temple once
stood. The numerous blocks scattered about here, resembling mill-
stones, and apparently artifusislly rounded, are discovered on closer
inspection to be ofnatural formation. The paved court was sur-
rounded by a brick wall, and the temple itself contained several
apartments; a poristyle, with columns now in rains, led to the eu-
hance. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they
suriiee to prove, that a town of very considerable importance, por-
hape the ancient Bacchis, once stood here.



Excursion to Médhm.

The Prthn AND hthsrshhs OI? Meow, the oldest muhhmehts in the
world, deserve it visit, wl1 h if the traveller approaches hy the river, may

euere may perform it in about the same time from the cl-Waste station;
oompr 12,458), Crossing the railway, we proceed on donkey-beek in ehout

on the meetahas ot' the early period of shefrn,

The Pyramid nf Médhm ts so dryerent { rum all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs'Eerm-mn el~Kuddtib', or'the false
pyramid'. From is large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in three ditt'ereat
stages at run angle or 74010', and is still preserved to a height of 122 ft.
The [ irst section is WI ft., and the second 20/, ft., while the third, now
almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer wens cun-
sist hf admirably jointed and polished Mocks "Mokttttam stone. The
holes in one of the surfaces were made by Lepsius and Erhkttm when
they examined the pyramid, the construction of which afforded them an
edmirehte clue to the principle upon which the others were built (camp.
p.350). The Pyramid of JIddthu was never completed; the heap of debris
at its base consists of the material which ohee iilled the angles of the
dilferent sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The pyre-
mid Was pilieged as early as in the time "the 20th Dynasty. It was
opened in 1881 by Meepem, who found a long corridor and a ehemhcr
without sarcophagus, Perhaps in this pyramid jhrsirsu, the first king of the
4th Pym, was buried, as in the steighhouring tombs persons related tn him
are interred.

The Mestebas of IEédism, which were opened by Mariette, lie to the
N. or the pyramid. These were the tomhs of the relations of Snefru
(4th Dyn.), ttnd in many respects resemble the mmisolea of Salgigirah whieh
