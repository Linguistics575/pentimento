and terminates at the top either in asphere, or in a polygonal half-

'rt, slaetites'. The two perpendicular mural pillars of the uichv
approach eaeh other towards the top, either in curved orin straight
lines eonvcrgiux at an acute angle. In neither ease, however, do they
actually meet, the niche tenninating above in a hemispherical dome,
which springs from the converging lines. The form of the entrance
varies considerably, In some cases it terminates above in an archi-
trave, in otheis in a round or pointed arch, while fantastically
wawl or hmkcu-arch forms are Mw not uneonuuon. The commonest
style in the mosques is the arehitrave form with segmental relieving
arches. A favourite practice was to pave the threshold with an Frrpt
cient block of red or black granite, even if covered with hiero-
glyphics, and in many cases these venerable inscriptions are still
traceable. In the mosques, on the resting-piaee in frontofthc door,
is a low sailing which marks the boundary to which the visitor may
penetrate without removing his shoes or sandals t

The Windows are more counnoniy rectangular than arched,
and an) sometimes grouped in twos and threes, in which case they
are often tastefully adorned with round, oval, "star-shaped ro-
settes in plaster, perforated, and liller1 with coloured glass. This
arrangement has many points of resemblance to the Byzantine
and Romanesque styles. The window in the facades are frequently
surrounded with scrolls in lowreiief, and with flat bands or roll-
mouldings 0n the inside they are usually adorned with friezes in
plaster with arabesques.

tpeeial importance was attached to the principal doors of men-
umental buildings, which as a rule were massively mounted with
iron or bronze, or were constructed of pieces of wood of different
colours, ingeniously fitted together. The portals of some of the
mosques are embellished with bronze decorations, beautifully
embossed and chased. The doors in the interior of the buildings
are often richly inlaid with ebony and ivory

The Dame,'4 very salient feature in Mohammedan buildings,
csprcially in the mosques and 1nausolea, varies much in form;
the base of the structure projects beyond the square ground-
plan of the etlitiee, am ] the summit rises ahove the eneiesing wall.
The dome, which tapers upwards in an elliptical form and is
mlorued with knobs and crescents, is blended with the quadrangular
iutrrinr of the mausoleum by means of Irondeutives; while, ex-
