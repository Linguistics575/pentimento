imitation of palm-stems. (Visitors should beware of falling into
the tor11b-shart.)

In passing the w. side of the Pyramid the visitor has an oppor-
tunity of observing, that, although several triangular hloeks ot' gra-
nite are strewn around, which perhaps once formed the lower
portion of the external inerustat'uyi1 ot' the Pyramid, the upper
quarter of the Pyramid is covered with a hard kind of conglo-
merate composed of limestone, broken bricks, and plaster.

Our route now leads towards the SAY. to the Third Pyramid
(p, 300), once entirely covered with huge blocks of granite, the
lower courses of which are still in tolerable preservation, We walk
round the Pyramid on the W. and 5. sides, near lhelatter of which
stand three smaller pyramids (p. 362), then leave the templeCpt 360 ]
belonging to the Third Pyramid on the lett, and descend by a good
path towards the E.

We nbserve here on the left another series of rock-tombs dating from
the 1th and 5th Dynasties. Among these is that of chehen (PLIU, eon-
muing T lung list Uf oitbrings with representations of person: dancing
with raised arms and feet befurc the altar, In a small hollow: t little
further to the N, is a tomh emhcllishcd with four columns (PL J, lhe

In the valley before us, to the right, rises a yrojecting ridge of
rock containing tombs of no interest. Adjoining this rock, on the
left, are two syeanlores and a date-palm, rising above an Arabian
burial-place. Still farther to the E. we observe the remains of the
stone dam leading from the plain of the Nile to the Third Pyramid
(p. JU). To the left of the trees rises .1 kind oftmncated Tower,
constructed partly of the natural rock and partly of masonry, and
supposed tohave been atomh. Passing through ir, we come to other
tombs on the left. also covered with sand, One of these was" that
of L'rlthuu (PL k), who seems to have been a kind of minister of
public, instruction in the reign of Ncrcr-ar-ka-ra, as he bore the
titles off'the royal and learned writer of the lofty gate, the
learned president of the art of writing, who brings light into the
writings of the double house of the tomb:. We nth reach the
Sphinx (p. 362), 150 paces to the S.F3. of which is the entrance
to the Granite Temple (p. 305) On the S. horizon, at a distanre
of 01/4 M., rise the pyramids of Abusiir (b. 3701 and the step-
pyramid of Sakkira Cp. 382).

In order to complete our circuit of the plateau of the Pyramids,
We proceed from the Sphinx towards the W. to (ara1pbell's Tomb'
(p. 367), ascend thence to the Great Pyramid, and pass three
uninteresting small pyramids on the right. (That in the centre,
amording to Herodotus, was the tomb of a daughter of Cheups;
that to the s,: mconling to an inscription preserved in the Museum
of BOil.c, belonged to Hentsen, another daughter of the same
king.) We skirt the E. side ofthe Greatl'yramid to the left, where
