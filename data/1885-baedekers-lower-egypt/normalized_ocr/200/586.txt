516 Route 10. Tiht. From Suez

mirahly protected by coral reefs, which, however, are dangerous to
those unaeqnainted with their situation. Ttir affords the only good
anchorage in the Gulf of Suez, beside Suez itself, and has lately
been made the chief quarantine station of the Mecca pilgrims. As
the desert air here comes into contact with the fresh sea-breezes
and as there is abundance of drit1kirsg-water, the choice of the
government seems a very judicious one. On the return of the pil-
grims, the desert to the S. of Th! presents a scene of great anima-
tion. Long rows of tents, arranged in six groups, afford ample ac-
commodation for the largest concourse of pilgrims, while the throng
is swelled by traders from Suez and Cairo, who sell their inferior
wares at the most exorbitant prices. On the side next Ttlr is the
camp of the soldiers who maintain the quarantine. To the N. of
the town the Jebel IJamrruim Sidna 1Itusa ('Mountain of the baths
of our Lord Moses'; 375n0, a spur of the low range of coast-
hills, projects into the sea. At the foot of this hill lie sulphur-
spsings of the temperature of 0'2AW', roofed over by rAbbas Pasha,
which irrigate plantations of palms, and are used by the natives
chioily "a cure for rheumatism. The Kal'ut e.t- Fr, a castle
erected by Sultan Murat ], is in a dilapidated eondi Ion. Most of
the palm-plantations belong to the monks of Mt. Sinai, and are
managed by their servants. Both the church and the secular build-
ing of the Greek convent at Ttar, which is said to have once been
occupied by a bishop and 1000 monks, are modern and uninterest-
ing. As an inscription on the exterior of the wall of tho ehurch
records, they were built at the expense of the treasurer Gregorius.
A few monks are always stationed here, offioiating partly as cha-
plains to a few Christian residents, and partly as caterers for the
Sinnitie monastery, which is supplied with provisions and fish
from T111. The caravans between the sea and the monastery are
conducted by the Beduins ofthe convent. Excellent fish, num0r011s
shells, and interesting marine animals abound here.
