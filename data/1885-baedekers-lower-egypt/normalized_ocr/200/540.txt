474 Route 10. PENINSULA OF SINAI. Plan ofExcureion.

[ The journey from Mt, Sinai to'Algzihit, and from Petra to the Holy
Land, is very rarely undertaken, ttntt should not be attempted without
e.trei'ut enquiry regarding the safety of the routed

(b) Sm Venom. A boat conveys the traveller down the Red Sort to
The ip. 515), whence he rides to Sinai in W; days. When the N. wind,
whi h almost: thityS prevails en the Red Sea, is strong enough, the WW-
age takes about 20 hrs; but it may take mueh longer if the breeze suhsid.
As the vessel skirts the coast, and as violent storms in the Red Sea are
very rare, except during the prevalence iii the Khnmsin in April and May,
the voyage in a boat of saffleient size (about 20 tons' burden) is uuabtended
with danger, thhugh i'm- from pleasant in is bad vessel. The retr1ra-J'oumer
should on no eeeount be made by water, for, owing to the prevalence of
the N. wired, constant tacking is necessary7 so that the voyage takes 8-10
days or more, The trip may bemttde in a vessel of 20tous' burden, with
a cl'W of four men, for 1UM50 fr.

The master of the vessel should be required to provide himseH with
the necessary ship's deenmeuts. The traveller's emisui will perhaps give
him a letter of introduction to Shekh iieuuen, EL respectable and oblig-
iug Arrdr wltolivcs at The Even witliuut en introduction the traveller
should apply tu t is shiikh, who will assist him in getting eameis, The
sliékh speaks Arabic only, but his sen speaks a time French and Italian.
Travellers whn citu speak modem Greek or Arabic should go direct tn
the Greek Convent, show the monks his letter of introduction tn the
cement oh m. Sinai, and hire from them the camels necessary for the
completion of his jimrney.

The most favourable time for starting is tuwmis evening; we em-
bark trem the quay near the Suez hotel. After traversing the narrow: trm
er the seat at the upper end of whieh Suez is situated, we reach the end
of the Suez canal, and the roa6stead shortly afterwards. On the right
rise the'Atii? a mountains (p. 115), with the promontory er the same
name, end to the Mt Ltre the palms of'Ain hmsn ip. 1lill, beyond which
is the tow chain of thehins of Tih. Beyond Cape Hittite epens the hroad
Wadi Anise, and the hills recedc. 0n the left "s the desert extending
between the Tih hills and the sea; to the right, it. the foreground, is the
lighthouse of Eds Zeyei-aneh, opposite to which, on the left, is the Jebel

pands. To the right, in the fhregruuud, rises the huge and picturesque
Jebet alwaI-t'b (about 5900 ft, in height), at the foot of which is it second
lighthouse. On the left are the conical peaks of the Jebel el-'Araba, the
base of which we now skirt. Beyond the Jehel Ghzirih, which heeeiues
more and more prominent, rises the table-land ofJebet erZtt, whieh
yields petroleum. The chain of Jebel el-'Araba is prolonged by the sandy
Jetet Mitts (p. 510), and the Jebet { Itinintzim Hlisa (p.516). We at length
come in sight of the palm-groves and buildings of Tiir, heyoad whieh
lies the sterile desert of NJ'a (p. 517); above the latter tower the im-
posing mountains of Sen. on the left, and of Unun Shihnar on the
right, between whieh appear the mountains of Sinai. Tttr, see p. 515.

The is now the quarantine station for the Mecca pilgrims and is (50U-
seqnentiy called at by the steamers, which may be used fur the journey
to this point and he i. This considerably deereases the trouble and ex-
pulse of the expedition, but it is necessary to iiail out beforehand the
season and duration of the quarantine, which of course varies with the
lunar year of the Arabs and with the state of 11myltl1 of the pilgrims. In
1580-81 it lasted from November to January.
