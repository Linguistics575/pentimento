to Sinai. PLAIN OF ER-RKHA. 10. Route. 513

This point commands an admirable survey of the broad Wadi, Which
is believed by many to have been the tsampiug-plaee of the Jews,
and is picturesqnely enclosed by huge mountains of granite.

Opposite the cliffs of the Smfgift ml the other side of the valley,
rise the red pmphyry masses ot the Jehel Frifa, forming the nucleus
or a labyrinth of other mountains extending towards the N. The 6.. de
of it is mm the Jebel 39214, to which hehmg the granite slopes com-
manding the Ffriidi er-1tttlss at the traveller's feet and the Wirth' iyd-D6r.
On the right CEO rises the label e6-0Er, sind nu the left (W.) are seen
numerous cliffs of granite, including the narrow Ughrst el-Mehd at the
entrance of the Wiidi Leja, and the label sFtMab, shen. Far below us in
the valley, at the month of the ravine above Which We stand, rises a
mound of sand with some ruined buildings and a few trait-trees,

The Plain of Er-Rii.ha, Which We here survey, is, according to
the measurements of Prof. Palmer, two million sq. yds. in area.
There is no doubt that this valley is suitieieittly extensive to have
been the campiug-plaee of a large multitude like that of the
Israelites, If the Mt. Sinai of the monks, and not Mt. Serhil, is to
he regarded as the mountain where the commandments were given,
the Ris es.-Yfs.if, and not the Jebel Mt1sa, must have been the peak
ascended by Moses. - 1f the Jehel M0sa alone has been climbed,
and the traveller wishes afterwards to visit the ttis os.-Fafyif, he
should ascend with a guide through a cleft immediately behind the
monastery, a little to the W. of the pilgrims' steps. There are steps
here also, but the route is not recommended to those who are ilk
eliucd to diraimess, and it is much more fatiguing than the pilgrims'
route. The descent may be made by a cleft opening into the Reba
plain, but this route is also very rough, and cannot be recommended
for the ascent. Huge masses of rock have fallen into the cleft, and
the path often leads below them.

Those who desire tn compare the form of the group amt. Sinai with
the account given of the'Monnt of the Lord' in the Bible narrative should
keep in mind the following points suggested hy Dr. Rohinsum which may
also be considered in reference to Mt. Sinai. There must be the summit
af a mountain commanding the camp of the people, and a space cun-
tiguous to the mountain from which a large multitude could witness
the scene on the heights. The camping-place must be so situated with
regard to the mountain, that the people mum itpprunch the httten and
stand upon Its lower slopes; there must he the possibility of touching the
mrmutatn, and of placing an enclosure round it to prevent the people
frnm ascending it, Ur touching its extremity.

Those who wish to return hence to the monastery, and not to
visit the Wadi Leja and the El-Ach/sa monastery (y. Md) at
present, may descend hy the ravine called the Sikkat Shu'aib. The
route is difficult; and reminds one of the question asked by Rocha
of the Knight Templar in Lessing's'Nathan', whether'it was really
so much easier to ascend the mountain than to descend it'.

The Wadi al-Lajn and the F2-Arlm" m Monastery may be reached
even on horseback and without a guide. The whole excursion,
Which presents no diffleulties, takes 4hrs.', numerous sacred spots
are pointed out on the route. Before entering the valley from the
Rilys plain, the place is shown where the earth is supposed to have
