cluding a marble Cerberus in the form of a lion with its tail ter-
minating in a snake's head) are in ii very mutilated condition, and
have been purposely covered with sand. Oh the W. side was
situated the Egyptian Serapeum, or Mausoleum of Apis, the sacred
bull, which had spent its life in its temple (Apieum) at Memphis
(p. 373), and after its death was buried in the vaults of y.lak: lcira.
