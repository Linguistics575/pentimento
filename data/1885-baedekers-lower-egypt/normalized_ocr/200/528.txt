404 Route 9. $ ENHI'JR. Fayfun.

Dimeh, and again by water to the s. bank of the lake, situated in
the latitude of Fertlstrr, which lies about, M. inland. The horses
should be sent on from lfayr l.iurtln to the lake, (unless the some-
what refractory guides refuse to obey), in order that we may ride
to Fenlttir, and thence to Medinet ei-r'ayrim. Four or five days are
required for the excursion; the points of interest are mentioned in
the third route. The road from Nezleh (see below) to lies: 15mm
Llhrs.) 1eads through the desert, past the remains of a small temple,
called by the Arabs Kay el-chit, or'Maidens' Castle'.

('2) If the traveller renmmces Dimeh and lgaer f.furiu, and is
satisfied with the sport to be obtained in the Bah: cl-Wiuli, he may
easily make the excursion in 21/s-3 days. On the first day the route
skirts the railway [ see above) to (2 hrs.) Same, - it then leads
through a plantation of opuntia, the growth of which is so gigantic
that it almost resembles a forest, and across a sandy tract overgrown
with tamarisks to (211m) Abnksa, situated on a hill, and com-
manding a fine survey of the lake and the Libyan mountains. At
the N. base of the hill near the railway station (see above) is a sugar
manufaetory, superintended by a Frenchman, who accords a kind rc-
ception to travellers. We now proeeedto the sm amass meadows,
and through a somewhat marshy district, to (2% hrs.) Abtlrelr, sit-
uated close to Nezleh. CThe traveller is recommended to spend the
night in a tent rather than among the Beduins.) Next day "0 fol-
low the valley of the Ruhr et- Wadi (or Ihshr A'czleh ], which is
hounded by large mmi-Wfs, to the lake (21/2 hxs.) w here we spend
the middle of the day. (The numerous dead fish on the bank of the
lake render its proximity unpleasant; heats are to he had from the
Meduins.) In the evening We return to Absheh, and on the third
day to Medinet el-Faytma,

(3) Four days at least are required for the somewhat longer
route vii Symln" u and the lake to Kagr Jiurtsn, if the traveller wishes
to visit Dimeh, and shoot on the lake. The route first skirts the
railway and the villa ot 2ralunrhi Boy, and then passes the tomb of
a sh√©kh, Where a draught of good water is offered to the tmveller
by a dervish. A number of dry ditches must he crossed, and also
several canals, where the traveller on horseback will hardly escape
from wetting his feet when the water is high; if he rides on a
donkey, he should get the Arabs to carry him and his saddle across.
The fields which we pass are remarkably well nultivated, and the
eye rests with pleasure on trees of various kinds, including tine
olives in the gardens, withhedges of cactus. The vegetation is most
luxuriant in the neighbourhood of Fidmin, a village pitstttresquely
situated on a slope, but inhabited by a thievish population. The
Ruhr It-'F/Stine!: L'rnill river'), one of the broader canals, must be
vmssm here. icyoud this point the country is, at places, green and
well irrigated, and at others dry and sterile. One part of the mute,
