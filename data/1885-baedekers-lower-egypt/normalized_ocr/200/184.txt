areueressarily stereotyped. There seems, however, tohave heenn
rctuv, urrcsAon in point ot' technical skill; for, as in the time of
Kliafta, the hardest materials still became compliant, and the dif-
tleulties of tho minutest detail were still successfully overcome by
(he sculptors "the Pharaohs.

Another considerable break lmw took place in the progress of
r'.gyptian art. This dreary interval began with the invasion of
the llyhsus or Shepherds, and lasted throughout
the whole of their domination. To them is at-
tributed the destruction of the older monuments,
and they themselves have left no architectural re-
mains behind them. They were notchowever,
entirely iuseusible to the charms Mart, and after
the first terrors of the invasion were over, they
did not prevent the Egyptian artists from prosc-
cuting their calling. As the Normans in Sicily
adopted the culture of the conquered Arabs, so
the llyksos turned to account the hnowledge of
art and the technical skill possessed by the Egyp-
tians. The sculptures excavated at Tania, the cap-
ital of the Ikasos (four sphinsurs and particu-
larly a group of river-gods in granite), are of
Egyptian workmanship, and there is nothing to
betray their origin in the llyhos period exeept
the type of the features, the bushy beards, and
the thick tufts of hair.

With the expulsion of the Hylrsos begins a
_ newperio0, in the history of art as well as in that
: _ - of politics. The warlike and victorious monannhs
of the l; ghtcenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, in
particular, have perpetuated their memory by
astonishingly ilumer0lls monuments. The compulsory labour of
captive enemies afforded the architects an opportunity of Partying
out their most gigantic designs, while the achievements of their
.~uvt: r (-i, r; ns1 such as the campaigns of Thuthmes, Ansenophis, and
Italltses, supplied the sculptors with an inexhaustible theme for
the (lccoration ot' the facades of their temples. To this period of
the new empire hclong most of the Thehan monuments. The taste
