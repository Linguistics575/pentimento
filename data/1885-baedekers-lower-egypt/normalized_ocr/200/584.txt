swallowed up the company of Korah, although, according to the
Bible narrative, the scene of that event must have been at a "on-
siderablc distance from Mt. Sinai. A hole in the rock is also pointed
out as the mould of the golden calf.

The Leia Valley, which Mnks the W. side of the Jebe ] Mhsa,
owes its name to an Arabian tradition that Leja was a daughter of
Jethro, and a sister of Zipporah (Arabic ZaNriya). At the en-
trance we first observe, on the right, the dilapidated hermitages
tt:,'liitt: ,f to SS. Earl, and Damianus and a disused chapel of
the welve Apostles. 0n the left is the ruinous monastery of
El- Bustfm with a few plantations; farther on we come to a mass
of mak, called by the Arabs Hujer Misa, or'Stone of Moses',
and declared by the monks to be the Rock of IIoreb, from Which
the spring issued when struck by Moses. It isprobably iuaacordance
with an ancient Jewish tradition, With which both St. Paul "L'or.
x. o, and the cxpounders of the Koran seem to have been farnil-
iar, that the monks assure us that this rock aeeompanied the Jews
throughout their wanderings in the desert, and then returned to its
old plate. It is of reddish-brown granite, measures about 130
cubic yds. in content, and is about 12 ft. high. The s. side is
bisected somewhat obliquely by a band of porphyty about 16 in.
wide, from holes in Which jets of water for each afthe12 tribes are
said to have 11owed. Two of the holes, however, seem to have disap-
peared. -Several Siuaitic inscriptions (p. MU) are to be seen here.

About 20 min. to the S. of this point is the unpreteuding DÃ©r
el-Arba'in, or Monastery of the Forty (i.e. martyrs ], with an
extensive garden containing olive and other trees. In the upper
and roaky part of the site rises l spring with a grotto near it, which
is said once to have been occupied by St. () nofrius. The mon-
astery was inhabited from the 10th down to the middle of the 17th
century. Two or three monks reside here occasionally to look after
the garden. The forty martyrs, from whom the monastery derives its
name, are said to have been monks who were slain by the Saraaeus,
but that event may as probably have taken place at the monastery
of Fjilrelyth on Mt. Serbal (p. 495).
