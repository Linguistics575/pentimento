yellow surface of the desert, present a remarkably t0lorless
appearance, but the soil is not entirely destitute of vegetation,
especially in spring One of the commonest plants is the Bethar0n
[ Cautolina fragrantissima), of Which the camels are very fond, and
which is full of aromatic juice; it is collected by the natives in the
N. part of the peninsula Golden colocynths Laandal; Citrullus
eo1oeyuthis) are sometimes seen lying on the way-side, having
fallen from their dark green stems. The dried shells are sometimes
used by the Bednins for holding water, or as a receptacle for butter.
The inside of the fruit is sometimes used as amedieine. The SeyU
(Acacia tortilis) occurs frequently farther t.; the juice which it
exudes (Gum Arabic) is collected by the Beduins for sale. Chewing
the gum is said to be a good remedy for thirst.

The (11/2 Ins.) Wadi el~'AmÂ§.ra, and beyond it the IJajer er-
Rekkab C'rider's stone'), consisting of several masses ofroek, are next
reached. The ground becomes more undulating. 1n the distance,
to the s., rise the Jebelljmmmim Far'ostp. 488) and the long
Jebet Ghammlel (p. 487), In less than 2hrs, we next reach the
sand-hills in the Wadi Hawirrs, 011 the summit of which a bitter
spring rises. Around it grow a number of stunted palm-bushes
and a few thorns. This is believed to be the Marah of the Bible,
mentioned by Moses (Exodus, xv. 23-25). + Burckhardt conjec-
tures that the juice of the berry of the gharhad (Nitrasia tridentata
179st), a shrub growing in the neighbouring Wadi Gharamle ],
may have the property, like the juice of the pomegranate, of im-
proving brackish water; but the Arabs know of no plant possessing

the virtue of that thrown into the spring by Moses.

Stations a ] the Israelites in the Wilderness, and number "the mnt-
The Biblical record oftlrese stations continues as follows (Numb.
S): -'And they departed from before Pi-Hahiroth, and passed
through lhe midst of the see into the wilderness, and went three days
juurliey in lhe wilderness of Elhitm, and pitched in hmmh. 9. And
they removed from Mitrah, and came unto Elim: and in Eiim were twelve
fountains of water, and threesome and ten palm trees; and they
pitched there.' The desert of lithium (which adjuined the hastilms oi
Khetem) may now be traversed more quickly by it Sinai pilgrira with
lime luggage; but it cnull'l hardly have been crossed by a whole nation
in less than lhrue days. Illm'uh is thus the hitter spring in the Imdt'

distance from iihwara lo Gharztndel (21urs0 is a very short journey, even
