Wyptian monuments whieh hear the names of their founders date,
from the time of Sncfm, who formed a link between the, 3rd and
4th Dynasties. That monarrh was the immediate predecessor of
II'Iquu for Chops, Ir, 0. 300l- GT), Jrquffr0 Cor Chapman 3007, 43),
and Uenlmuw (or Myeerinus, J043- 2 (Y), the builders of tbe Great
Pyramids (romp. pp. 86, 8-141 347). It continued customary to
build pyramids down to the. 12th Dynasty (ll. C. 2300); but at a
later period, especially after the residence ofthe Pharaohs had been
removed from Memphis to Thebes. the kings, es well Ts their sub-
jects, seem to have preferred mck-tombs to mausolen above groundi I
The Greeks were mueh struck by these monuments when they first
came, to Egypt, and oven erected similar ones themselves (as at
Cenehreze ], akin to the Magtaha: UL 370). The Pyramids am
therefore invariably described by Greek travollersl, as woll as by
their successors, and they afterwards became famous as one of the
greatest wonders of the world.

Herodotus, though ill informed as to the history of the founders
of the Pyramids, describes the stmetuxes themselves admirably,
like everything elsehe saw in person Cheops (I (hutu ], accord-
ing to his statement, was addicted to every kind of vice; he closed
the temples, prohibited the offering of saisritiecs, and oppressed the
"hole nation by exacting compuisnry labour. Some of his sIIhjm-ts
woe, employed by him in quarrying block: of stone, among the Arab-
ian mountain, and in transporting them to the Nile, others had
to ferry those Itones across the river, while others again conveyed
them to the hase of the Libyan mountains ff.'New there were
about 100,000 men employed annually for three months in eaeh nf
these tasks. They took ten yearx' to make the road forthe. trunspnrt
of the stones, whieh, in my opinion, must have been almost as
lailorious a task as the building ofthe Pyramid itself; fortheleugth

making this road and the subterranean chambers ou the hi1 ] oc-
