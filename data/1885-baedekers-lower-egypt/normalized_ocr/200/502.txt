sulate on the right, and after a few hundred paces reach a lane on
the left, containing the G0mir es-Sign (here pronounced Segue),
or'mosque of the prison', which is pointed out as the prison of
Louis IX., although Ahuli'ida has stated that the king Was eon-
tinoil in the house of Ibn Fakhreddiu, the scribe of the town,
situated on the Nile, [ A small room on the bank of the Nile is
shown as Fsrkhreddht's house, but without the slightest authority.)
The mosque contains columns brought from older edithses, with
Byzantine capitals of Corinthian tendency, bearing Saracenie ar-
ches. The Mamhar (pulpit) and ceiling are still embellished with
remains of tine wood-carving, Which was originally painted. An-.
other, and probably correct tradition points out an old house of
Saladin's time, next door to the F2-hrttwCrf/, c Mosque, as the true
prison of Louis IX.

The town eentains no other sights. The palace of the Khedive
is a large and unpleasiug building.

Excunsmu TO Bnunir EL~HAGBR. The excursion by boat takes
2 hrs. up the river, and 11/2 hr. in the reverse direction, so that,
including a stay of 2hrs., it eueupies 6-7 hrs. in all. The charge
for a good boat is (M) fr.; bad walkers should take donkeys with
them. In ascending the stream, the boat passes the town on the
left, lying close to the bank of the river. On the right is the vil-
lage of th5ger, also known from an early period as Tell el- Irehild? yeh

sire still cause their dead to be inferred here. The next places are

opposite this village we land (on the right) at an old bulwark of
blocks of limestone and bricks, near the Kantamt cl- Wish, 3 bridge
across a cam ] which joins the river here .---Frorn the river to the
ruins is a pleasant walk of M) minutes, The luxuriant trees on the
route have quite a European appearance, as theyinclude lime-trees,
silver poplars, and willows, besides the sunt-tree, the lebhek, the
tamarisk, and the hermit" shrub. We traverse welI-eultivated Mlds,
and soon reach the distinct traces of a wall enclosing a heap of
ruins, known to the Arabs as U/asrer et-fMrrtris' (hnffaloes' stone ],
which form the remains of the anee msgnilieent Isis Temple of

the Arabs to Behhit. The Copts knew the place by its sacred name
of Aaisi oiesru:0, and the Romans called it Isemn or Isirlr's Op-
pidrsm. 1t lay in the Sebeunytiu name, the capital } of which was
Sebmmytus, situated on the same site as the modern Semom11ir1
