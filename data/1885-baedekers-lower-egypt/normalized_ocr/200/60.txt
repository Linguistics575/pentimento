domestic utensils employed by the ancient Egyptians, as well ma
many of their customs, are similar to those of the dwellers ou
the banks "the Zambezi and Niger, but totally different from
those soon on the banks ot" the Indus or Euphrates, will nluays
maintain an opposite view, The considerations already mentioned,
however, teml to show that the truth lies between these extremes.
Even those who most strongly maintain the Asiatic origin of
the Ill ptians will probably admit that the immigrants found
an aboriginal vane already settled on the banks of the Nile, which
in its persistent opposition to all foreign influences was douhtless
similar to the nme usually kuown as the Egyptian. We start with
the cardinal fact, that, although the country has been at various
periods overrun by Uyksos, Ethioyiaus, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,
lomnns, Arabs, and Turks, and although the people were tyran-
nised over. ill-tmated, and in most eases compelled to iutermarry
with these foreigners, the Egyptians have for thousands of years
retained the same unvi1cying physical types, while their character
has been but slightly niovli'fled by the introduction of Christianity
and .1leharurnedarrisrn, If it now be borne in mind that these
foreigners generally invaded the country in the form of an army,
that tlwy formed but a small body compared with the bulk of tho
population, and that they either married native women or sought
uircs in other countries, it is obvious that they would eithex Con-
tinue to exist for a time as a foreign enste. a condition apparently
repugnant to nature and necessarily transient, or that they would
gradually succumb to the never-failing iuf1uenees of the soil and
he absorbed in the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants, An
excellent illustration of this process is aimrded by the Arabian in-
vasion, with the circumstances and results of which we are better
acquainted than with the history of the other foreign imxnlgmtions;
for, disregarding the lieduin trihcs, who are entirely distinct from
the Egyptian population, we no" find that the Arabian element
has entirely disappeared, and we meet with genuine Arabs in the
towns only, where the merchants. pilgrims, and other members of
that people form "class entirely distinct from the natives, and
where their existence is only maintained by means of reinforce-
ments from abroad. Another proof of the transforming iui5nenees
of the Egyptian climate is afforded by the uniform character of the
domestic animals. The oxen, in particular (which, lro1svver, are
gradually being replaced by the buffalo ], though they have often
been repeatedly oxtermimted in a single century by murrain, and
have been sumceded by foreign races from cw-ry quarter of the
globe, invariahly after a few generations assume the well-known
ligyptiun type with which the representations on the ancient temples
render us so familiar.
