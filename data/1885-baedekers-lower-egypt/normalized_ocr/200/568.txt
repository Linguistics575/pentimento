imposing peaks of the Jcbcl Muisrt group, If it be asked how the
glorious title of the Wourrt of the Lord' came to be transretree from one
mountain to Inmther, the question may he answered without much
aifhrarlty. Wluen the early C'lrvistians settled in the peninsula, they
fond no memorials of the Exodus, but arbitrarily assigned Old Testament
names to the varionshills nnd wneys, a practice Which, as we slum after-
Wards see, was imitated to excess by the monks of the hnunastery of
St. Catharine on the Jebel misa. One grant) of anchoriles "eutihed

Mt ep scopal see, its right to claim the title was gmternlly recognised, but
after it had lapsed into heresy, this right was denied by the Orthodox
church, and the hermits of the Jubel 3Msa group were expressly re-
ungnised as the genuine Sinuitcs, for whose protectiun Justinian caused
a castle to be built. The anchorites and Cmnobitc's of Nt. Scrbil, who
wore decimated by the frequently recurring attacks of the Saracens,
accordingly emigrated to the Jebel mm; { m safety, We have already
cited isreu1arktible passage of early date, in which it is expressly stated,
that the monks of Sinai had emigrated { mm another mountain, and had
settled on the modem Sinai by God's command. See the writings nchp-
sins already mentioned (p. Mm, where those views were expressed for the
hut time, and are. fully discussed. Many critics have since adopted the
same theory.

Leaving the Meharret hill (see p. 495), we proceed towards the
NE. under palm-tsees. The ground becomes soft, and is carpeted
with turf, moss, and seeds, interspersed with blue and red flowers,
We pass rich fields of wheat, besides tobacco and other industrial
crops; the bushes are enlivened by birds, and i10tyks of sheep and
goats lie by the side of the brooks under the shade of the trees.
After 1hr. the palm-trees leave off, and are succeeded by a thicket
of tarfa shrubs, which we ts; werseialh hour. Manyofthesc shrubs
assume the form of trees, 2h-3 ft, in circumference,

it is only in the lower pert of the "'idi cshrsh√©kh (p. 520), stud here in
its prolongation, the Wadi Fiviin. so far as the latter is watered by the
brook, that these term plants yield We wen-knnwu Manna. Minute holes
are hand in the Ge bark of the thin, brown twigs, by an insect (Coccns
ipmus) which was first observed by Ehrenberg, and from the almost
ble openings issues a transparent drop ofjnicc, which then falls "
and burdens in the send. This sweet gum, resembling honey, Which is
still mined'rnaa' by the Arabians, ts eolleeted and preserved in consid-
emble quantities; the monks in the monastery generally keep a supply,
partly for their own use, and pavtlymrsale, intir1 boxes. In 1845 chsius
found the whole valley fragrant with manna as early as the end or March,
bat it is usually most plentiful from the end of April to the end of
Jams, and the more so in pmpurthm to the moisture oi the preceding
winter.

Adjoining the, rocky slopes on the left rise, numerous teub-
shaped mounds of earth, upwards of 100 ft. in height, which Fraas
takes to he the remains of ancient moraines. After 1/2 hr. the
Wtdi el-Akhyar (p. 521), leading towards the E., diverges to the
left. Opposite to it opens the det' Ilatiameh, to the w. ot' which
rises a hill situated to the s. (right) of the road, called the Jabct
el-Ottmar, Le.'Mountain of the conversation between God and
Moses'. The Arabs still offer saesiilees here to Moses within l circle
of stones on the summit of the hill, singing -'0 mountain of the
conversatiouut'hloses, we seek thy favour; preserve thy good people,
