bridge t 4 br.; from this bridge to the margin of the desert 20min.;
and t0 Mariette's house 20 min. more. (The Ietum-mute to the
station of Bedrash√©n will take nearly Il/s, hr., without stoppage.)
The two routes unite on the outskirts of the desert, and ascend
to the plateau over the ruins of an ancient village which was per-
haps inhabited by the emhahners of the dead. On the right are
grottoes hewn in the mekst Near the first of these is a deep shaft,
now covered up, where human mummies, and those of several eats,
were found. In the third grotto, on the right, is the figure ofa
cow hewn in the rack. represeutir1g, the goddess Father o. 135).
The traveller may inspect the step-pyramid (p. 382) of Sa -
15513 on the way to Maxiette's House, at which he is recon
mended to rest before Visiting the rest of the Neeropolis.
This pyramid is seaehed by either of the paths indicated on the
map (p. 378) in 20 minutes. One of these leads to the N.,
round the small pyramid nearest to the step-pyramid, and then
turns to the W. through a sandy depression; the other path leads
more to the left { NM.), passing several tombs and shafts, straight
in the direction of the'Step-Pyramid fdesesibed at p.331, and
most conveniently visited in going or returning). Ilaving crossed
the E. enclosing wall, and passed round the RE. comer, we ob-
taiu. near the closed entmrme en the s. side. a striking view to-
Wards the N. In the foreground lies the green valley of the Nile
bordered by palm-trees, and framed on both sides with the yel-
lowish-grcy desert; and we also observe the alabaster mosque of
Mohammed'Ali at Cairo. On the left tower the three pyramids of
Gizeh, 9 M, distant, and the three nearer pyramids of Ahugir. The
path pursues a W. direction for a short distance, then turns to the
right beyond the next heap of rubbish (XIV), crosses the hollow,
and joins the ahove-mentioned path leading to 5lariette's House.
Strangers am quite at liberty to enter and use the broad covered
terrace in front of the house, hut for any very protracted occupation
of it the permission of the museum authorities should be obtained.
No charge is made for admission to the terrace, but it is usual to
give a fee of1 fr. or more, according to the number of the party,
to the Beduins who take charge of the house, and who are much
better conducted than their sapaeious brethren of Crtzel1. A guide
to the tombs must be taken at Mariette's House, as visitors are
not admitted to them unattended. (Bakshish for the tombs of
