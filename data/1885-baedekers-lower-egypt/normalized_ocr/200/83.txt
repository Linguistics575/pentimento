One of the prin ipal geological curiosities near Cairo is the Petri-

These have been described by Unger as Nieiuirri1epypiiam (er the family

wtmlrl seem that the forest contained various other trees also (palms and

covered at places only with scanty vegetation. From the nrurtl1ernmost
spur of the Arabian desert (the Mehettem neer L irrr) to a point above
Etltu, heth banks of the Nile consist of early tertiary numnnnlite lime-
stone. The strata dip gradually from smith to north, so that the farther
we ascend the Nile the older are the strata that we meet with. The
limestone ht the Molgnttam, with its millions of nuu1urulites, is the mih-
terial of which the new buildings of the European suburbs of Cairo are
construeted, and it was from the venerable quarries of Tum and mr'-
_'.urrls that the ancient Egyptians obtained the stone for their pyramids.
The hlueks for these stupendous structures were conveyed to them by
means of e huge stone dyke, of which all traee has new disappeared, On
the hlohetthm, near ltlinyeh, Beni Hagan, Shit, Thebes Esneh, and at
other places the limestone is rich in fossils, and in the vicinity ofCaix-o

To the south or Edfu the nnnnmnlite limestone dt appears, heing ve-

according to Figari-Bey, contain ehnlh fossils, After these we come to

This last forraatiou, known as'Nubian sandstone'. which covers
many thousands of square miles M Nubia and the 8iidiin, was the ma-

of Upper Egypt; and near Selseleh, and in the Arabian desert between
Keueh and Koeér, are still to be seen the exte _ -e quarries whieh yielded
the material for the colossal structures of Thebes.

From Assnan to h'elseleh the Nile flows through Nubian sandstone,
but near the ancient Syene a trensverse Iriurier of granite and'syeaite'
advances from the east, forming the boundary hctwueu Egypt and Nabra.
