the Empire, and the builder of Jlemphis. Herodotus states that ho
was told by the Egyptian priests, that -1fenes had constructed an
embankment across the Nile about 100 stadia above Memphis, and

ciently firm, he built upon it the city of Memphis, situated in the
narrow part of Egypt. To the N. and the W. of the city, as they
informed him, Memes eaused a lake to be excavated forits defence,
and to be filled from the river, which protected the town on the E.
side; while within the city he erected the great and memorable

from the invasion and during the domination of the Uyhsos
