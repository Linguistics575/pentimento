Hons or nu; Osnus AND Isis 0111mm We one to learch a
detailed account of this myth, which has been uniformly wrroborat-
ed by the monuments, and which may be briefly told as follows.

Isis and Osiris were
the children of Rhea and
Ghronos, that is, of Nut,
the goddess of space, and
ofSeh, the god of the earth,
which, owing to its eternal
rejuveneseemse and im-
perishahleness, srir1bolis-

womb of their mother, that

sprang Horus. Typhon and
Nephthys, chihlrau of the
same parents, likewise
married each other. Osiris
and Isis reigruulas a happy
royal pair, bestowing on
Egypt the blessings of
wealth and prosperity.
Typhon conspired against Osiris, and at a banquet persuaded him
to outer a cunningly wrought elusst, which he and his seventy-two
accomplices then closed and thress into the Nile. The river carried
the chest northwards, and so down to the sea by way of the estuary
of'l'auis; and the waves at length washed it ashore near the Phat-
niuian Byblus. Ileattwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the
country, seeking her lost husband; and she at length succeeded in
discovering his coffin, which she carried to a sequestered spot and
concealed. She then set out to visit her son Horus, who was being
educated at Rum. During her absence Typhou, while engaged in a
Mar-lout, fouudthe hodyofthe god, eutitiuto fourteen piooes, and
svattered them in every direction. As soon as Isis learned whathad
happened, she collected the fragments, and wherever one had been
found erected amonnmenc on the spot to its memory; and this 7w-

Egypt and elsewhere. Osiris, however, was not dead. He had Coli-
tinued his 0 scvuce and his reign in the lowerregions, and after his
burial be visited his son Horus, whom he armed and trained for battle,
The young god soon began a war against'J'yphon, and was at length
