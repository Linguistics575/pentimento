The tirst great persecution ot the Christians, which took place
in the reign oi1yecius (250), "as a terrible blow to the gtlcsandrians.
The city had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and
had since loo possessed a theological school, presided over by
l'autu-nus and at the beginning of the 3rd cont. hy Clement of
Alexandria, "ho endeavoured to combine Christianity oith the
Neo-Platonisur which sprang up ahout this period at Alexandria
and was taught by Ammonius Sauces, IIcrcnnius, l'lotinus, Por-
phyrius, Jamblitshus, and others. A second persecution took place
in 257, duringthe reign of Valerian; and shortly afterwards, in the
reign of Gallienus, the plague carried off a large portion of the
population. The incessant revolts whieh broke out in Alexandria
and other parts oflCgypt led repeatedly to the elevation of nsurpers
and rival emperors to the throne, Thus, Firmns was proclaimed
emperor at Alexandria as a rival ofAureliau, and Probus owml the
purple mainly to the Egyptian legions. The Alexandrians after-
wards revolted againstDioeletian and declared themselves in favour
ofArhillens; but Dioeletien besieged thc eit took it by storm,
and chastised the inhabitants with great severity.

Christianity, however, still continued to gain ground, and Al-
exandria was even regarded as the chief seat of Christian erudition
and of the orthodox faith. The dogmatic (1issensiorns between Arius,
who lilled the oiliee of preshyter, and Athauasius, who afterwards
became a bishop, at length broke Ottt, and wore fraught vith dis-
astrous consequences. Alexandria was also soon obliged to yield to
Constantinople its proud position as the centre of Greek thought
and science. The sanguinary quarrels between the Athanasian
party and the Arians under their unworthy bishop Georgius further
uontrihuted to the rapid decline of the city. (hr the accession of
Julian to the purple the pagans of Alexandria again instituted a
persecution of the Christians, and Georgius became one of their
Victims. 1n the reign of The0Msius, however, paganism received its
d0athblow, and Theophilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, displayed
the utmost zeal in destroying the heathen temples and monuments.
The famous statue of Serapis Was broken in pieces and burned in
the amphitheatre amidst shouts of derision from a Christian crowd.
The material prosperity of the city also fell off so greatly, that the
municipality was no longer able to defray the cost of cleansing the
Nile, and keeping the canals open. After the death of Theophilus
(in Ji 13 ] the revenues ot'Alexendria were still farther diminished by
the proceedings of the new patriarch Cyril, who led the armed moh
anain§t the 8y1liuruguv'S and expelled the Jews from the city; and
in'01. » the Yarned and beautiful heathen llypatia, (laughter of the
"yathpmatieian'l'hron, was t'rnelly murdered by an infuriated crowd.

The n-izns ofNarr0u, Leol., and Justinian were also signalised
by nan renolts, rhielly o msioned by religious (lisseusions. Under
Justinian nll [ hr still existing heathen srl00ls were finally closed,
