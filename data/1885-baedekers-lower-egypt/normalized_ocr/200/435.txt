stone-mason then converted these sketches with his ehisni into re-
lief figrtres, some of whisk were flat, while others were raised about
21/21ines or more. Lastly the painter coloured these designs, the
most conspicuous tints being hiaek7 reddish brown, pale brown,
yellow, light and dark blue, and green. Parts of the design that
were intended to be white were not painted, but left in the natural
colour of the stone. All the colours, so far as they have been
chemically analysed, are earthy substances, and are heeutifuliy
preserved, except in eases where they have been too long- exposed
to the sun and wind, The women are always painted efapaie yel-
low colour, and the men of a reddish brown tint. The metals also
have their conventional colours, iron being blue, and bronze yellow
or red, while wood is painted brown, or, when in logs, greenish
grey. 1n painting animals the artists endeavoured to imitate their
natural eolours, and we accordingly find that the cows and calves
are black, brown, and dappled. - On the death of the proprietor
of the tomb, his remains were deposited at the bottom of the
mummy-shut, and the ta. of decorating the tomb was at an end,
so that the mast perfect sculptures are to be seen in juxtaposition
with the mere designs in red chalk. If other members of the fam-
ily died, their mummies "ere likewise deposited in the common
shaft, but no allusion to their history was recorded an the walls of
the principal chamber. An exusepcion, however, was made in the
ease of the widow of the deceased, whose statue was placed on the
W. side of the tomh-ehamhex beside that of her hushand, as has
been done in the tomb of Ti. [ t is also "orthy of remark that the
name of the proprietor of the tomb is always engraved in hierogly-
phies on the se-talled drum of the doorway and on that of a'stele'
fashioned in imitation of a door on the W. side of the tomb [ as in
the ease of the tomb of Ti, p. 388). In a numhcr of the tomhs it
has been observed that a single tigure has been obliterated, while
the whole of the rest of the decorations are well preserved and
intact. The figures thus defaced are supposed to have been these
of dishonest servants, whose misconduct induced the family to
erase their portraits. At stated intervals, onholidays, andprohably
also on the anniversary of the death of the occupant of the tou1b,
the family was went to assemble in the decorated tornb-chatr1ber
and the anterior court, bringing offerings n, which they eon Â»
sumed in honour of the deceased, while homage was done to the
statue by burning incense around it.

The Rock Tombs, placed in long rows, and most of them exta-
vated en the E. and S. slopes of the plateau, are in a far simpler
style than the maetahas, both in point of construction and of in-
ternal decoration; but they sametimes contain similar decorations,
particularly in Upper Egypt.
