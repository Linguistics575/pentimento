Among the lower classes frequent intermarriage with negro women
has darkened the complexion and thickened the features of their
oifspring; while the higher ranks, being descended from white
slaves or Turkish mothers, more nc'arlyreser11ble theEuropean type.
As the inhabitants of the towns could not be so much oppressed by
their rulers as the peasantry, we tiud that they exhibit a more in-
dependent spirit, greater enterprise, and a more cheerful disposition
than the fellfihiu. At the same time they are not free from the
dreamy character peculiar to Orientals, nor from a tinge of the apathy
of fatalism; and their indolenee contrasts stronglywith the industry
of their European rivals in political, seientifie, artistic, and all
business pursuits. A glance at the oifiees of the ministers, tho
bazaars of the merchants, the schools of the Arabs, and the "iu'hling-
yards and workshops e,0ustru0ttu1 by natives will enable the traveller
to observe with what deliberation and with what numerous iiiter-
vals of repose they perform their tasks. From such workers it is
in vain to expect rapidity, punctuality, or work of a highly iHished
character, and the caustic remark of Prince Napoleon that the Egyp-
tians are'eapatrle of making a pair of pantaloons, but never of
sewing on the last button', was doubtless founded on experience.

more picturesque, and better suited to the climate in On the whole,
however, they are bigoted Moluunmedaris, and share the contempt
with which the fellahiu regard all other religions. Their daily inter-
course with unbelievers and their dread of the power of the Christ-
ian rtatioustend, however, to keep their fanaticism, which otherwise
would be unbounded, in check, and has even induced them to admit
strangers to witness the most sacred ceremonies in their mosques.

by many authorities to be identical with'barbarians', a word which
is said to have been adopted by the Greeks from the Egyptians, who
used it to denote all'non-Egyptians', and to be derived from brr,
i. e.'to be unable to speak', or'to speak imperfectly'. The'Bee
bers' of N.Afrie: t and the town of'Berber' in S. Nubia also doubt-
less have the same origin, In Egypt the name is applied in a half
contemptuous way to the numerous immigrants from the Nubian
