hiy Christ. They are It rerractory, good-fm-nothing, and slen-
Jerous set.or people. - The city (Alexandria) possesses treasures and
resources in toundru1ce, No une's hands here are idle. At one place
glass is manufactured, at another paper. and at annther liuea. All these
busy people seem to carry on sume kind of handicraft. Men with gouty
feet, Mind persuns. and e all those with gouty hands, all find some ne-
enpntinn. They all real recognise one god nuly (prubahly Mammon ],
the same who is worshipped by Christians, Jews, and all netilms. It
is a pity that the people are nfsu bad a. disposition, es the importance of
the city, even in pnint of size, makes it Well wurtliy of being the capi,
tal of the Whole of Egypt Imade every possible mnecssiun to the city,
restored its ancient privileges, and added so many new nues that the
citizens came and thanked me in person; and yet as sum: as I had left
the mace they calumnieted my son Verus.

As at that period, so at the present day, the population ofAlex-
andria cons of members of every nation dwelling on the banks
of the Vediterranean. The language most generally 11r1ilerstooi1 is
Italian, which the Arabs, as well as other nations, learn readilyt

Sights. Unless the traveller proposes to make archaeological
researches and to study the ancient topography of Alexandria, he
will easily become acquainted with its principal points of interest
in a single day (comp. p. 20 (f). Cairo "ords a far better insight
into Oriental life than its half-European seaport, while its delight-
ful winter climate, notwithstanding the proximity of the two cities,
is far superior to that ofAlexaudria. In summer the reverse is the
case. as the heat at Alexandria is then tempered with cool see-
breezes, but even as early as April, especially when the s. or S E.
wind prevails, the atmosphere there also is often hot and dusty.
The European should avoid any undue exertion, which may easily
be followed by very prejudicial effects

The new-comei will nevertheless find it interesting to walk
through the town. and particularly to ohservc the busy streets with
their Oriental and European throng; and he will encounter, chietiy
beyond the precincts of the Frank quarter, a number of isolated
relies of antiquity, in the shape of stumps of columns, blocks of
stone, and heaps of broken pottery. It is not an easy matter to give
the traveller distinct directions as to his route through the city, as
only the principal streets have well-recoguised names, Most of the
new names given them by government are unfamiliar to Europeans
and Arabs alike, and have practically superseded the older names
in a few cases only. Some of the streets again are diti'crcntly named
hy Europeans of tliirerent nationalities. If the traveller loses his
way he will soon meet with a donkey-boy who will take him back
to his hotel (oomph p. 205). On the W. side of the city, and on
the neck of land between the two hath' _ the ancient Hepta-
stadium, to the h. of the Place 31éhémet- li, the inhabitants are
ehieily of Arabian extraction (p.906), while the quarter which was
once the island of Phams, farther to the N.. is occupied by the
Turks. The streets here are somewhat broader than in the other
quarters, and the houses are sometimes handsomely built and pro-
