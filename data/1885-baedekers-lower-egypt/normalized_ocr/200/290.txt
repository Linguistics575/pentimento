Starting from the Place Atah cl-Katha, between the Muski and
the Ezbekiyoh (see above), the Boulevard Mohammad'Ari, 1860 yds.
in length, leads straight to the foot of the citadel. At the end of
this long street is the Place'Sutton Ijasan CPI F 2), with two
large mosques. That on the left is the Mmi: RH yeh (P1. 59),
named after an order of dervishes (p. 150), and erected entirely
at the expense of the mother of the ethcdive Isma'il, but still
"ntinished. (ht the right, adjoining the Place Ruméleh, rises the--

'" NHtmir Sultan Hasan (Pl. 44), the'superb mosque', and the
finest exi ting monument of Arabian architecture. It was begun
in the year 757 of the lregira (A.ly. 1356), and completed in three
years by Melik eu-Ni.sis Abu'l-Ma% i IJasan ihn Kaitlin, but is
now in a neglected and dilapidated condition.

esterrninated whole families, whose property was immediately seized by
the government. Mahrizi lp, 2 & 2), with the usual exaggeratinn of Orientals,

After having been dethroned in 13m, IJasan regained pnssussinu of his
Sceptre three years later, but in 136i he was again dethroned and ass-
: tssinated.

The lofty walls with their shallow niches, pierced with six
or seven windows one above the other, the huge gateway (see be-
low'), and the S. minaret which is still preserved, present 4 ma-
jestic appoaram-e, especially now that the incongruous additions
of later date have been removed. The building is in the form of an
irregular pentagon, on the E. side of which the minaret: and the
mausoleum (see below) form symmetrical projections. The windows
in the side are disposed somewhat irregularly, and the wall termi-
nates in tt broad cornice. The angles of the edifice are embellished
"ith volumhs built into the wall, with a wreath of pendenties or
'stalaetites' at the top, forming to some extent a new order of capital.

According to the legend, Sultan I'lasan, after the completion of
the work, ordered the architect's hands to he cut off, in order that he
might not erect a second building of equal splendour. (Similar
myths in various parts of Europe record that architects have been
blindrd from the same motive.) The mosque of ljasnn has always
