cn. Modes of Travelling in Egypt.

IAILWAYS. A network ofrailways constructed by the Egyptian
government now connects mogtot' theimportant places in the Delta.
The engineer of the oldest of these lines, that from Alexandria to
Cairo, was Mr. Stephenson, and the others were planned by Faic.1-
Bey. The railways are under the management of a board ot' admin-
istration, the president of which is .1 native, while most of the
members are Englishmen or other Europeans. The carriages re-
semble those of other countries, but the third class is insufferably
dirty' The dust and heat render railway travelling in Egypt ex-
ceedingly unpleasant in hot weather,

The traveller should be at the station fully half-an-hour before
the hour for starting, as the process of issuing tickets and booking
luggage is often very slow, and the tielret-tylerks are entitled to
close the ot'tiee 10 minutes before the departure of the train. Gold
coins that are in any degree either defaced or of light weight are
not accepted at the bo0kir1g-ofihte. The personal tickets are printed
in English and Arabic, the luggage tickets in Arabic only. The
hours of dcpaxture are seldom altered, and those at present fixed
are given in the following pages.

Donna's (Arab. lsomtsr) form the best means of conveyance
both in the xmrow streets of the towns and on the bridle-paths
in the mummy. They are of a much iiuer, swifter, and more
spirited race than the European, and at the same time patient and
persevering, Those in the towns are generally well saddled and
hridled in Oriental style. The attendants are either men or boysi,
who contrive to keep up with their heasts at whatever pace they
are going, and often address long sentences to them in theirArabie
patois. As the gait of the donkeys is sometimes very uneasy when
they break into a trot, care should be taken not to engage one with
this defeat for an excursion of any length. As the stirrnps are
often in had condition they had better not be used at all. The
r1onkey-boys (Arab, .harnmtr) are fond of showing off the pace of
their beasts, and often drive them unpleasautly fast. The rider
who prefers a slower pace shouts'ala mahlak "mm mahlakum; if
a quicker pace is wanted, yulla, yalla, or tru7sht, or stil: et-l.romrsr;
if a halt is to he made, o5bur, or the English word'stop'. The
t10ukey-boys, especially at Cairo, are generally remarkably active,
intelligent, and ohliging. Many of the donkeys, particularly in the
country, will be observed to have been deprived of part of one or
both cars. This has been clone, according to the somewhat cruel
practice of the country, as a punishment for trespass, Mt add'tional

mure exorbitant in their demands and less obligiug, and even their
rhuskeys appear to partake of their unpleasant disposition,
