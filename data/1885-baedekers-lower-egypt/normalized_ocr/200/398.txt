In order to remove the hodies of the dead from the iniluenee of the
inundation of the Nile, they were buried in the dry rocky soil of
the desert. Wealthy persons caused t0mb-elsar0ers (p. 379) to be
excavated for themselves, while the kings, who wished to maintain
their royal pre-eminenrtc even in death, were specially anxious to
ensure the durahility and permanence of their tombs. The burial-
phee of a king was worthy, in their opinion, of beingdistinguished
by its situation and its magnitude; they desired that it should $ ur-
pass all others in magnificence, end that the tornb-ehamher should
be least capable of violation, It was probably, therefore, at tirst
eustomary to cover the roek-tomh of a king' with blocks of stone, "
to raise a mound over it, if sand and earth were proeumhle in the
Vicinity. The violent winds from the desert, however, rendered it
necessary to consolidate these meundsby covering them with stones.
The sepulehral mounds thns acquired a definite form; they became
square structures, tapering upwards, and gradually assumed the
pyramidal shape, ensuring the utmost strength and durability.
Opening of the Pyramids. The Pyramids are said first to have
been opened by the Persians (Bt. 525-333), and it is certain that
they were examined by the Romans. The Arabs endeavoured to
penetrate into the interior of these stupendous structures, "idefly
in hope of finding treasures; and the greater the Jifiioulties they
encountered, the more precious and worthy of concealment did
they imagine the contents to be. According to'Abdellatif, it
was Khalif Ntun0n (A.D. 813-33), son of Hate" er-llashid
(p. 101), who caused the Great Pyramid to be opened; but it is
probable that that prince merely continued the investigations efhis
predecessors, es Dionysius, the Jacobite patriarch of Antioch, who
entompanied him, found that an entrance had alreadyheen effectedt

adjacent to the old, with the aid of fire, vinegar, and projectiles.
With regard to the success of the undertaking there exist various
more or less highly embellished accounts by the Arabian historians:
but one thing appears certain, that the hopes of the explorers wore
disappointed, and that nothing was found in the already plundered
chambers and corridors. According to some accounts, the gold found
here was exactly enough to defray the cost of the undertaking,
having possibly been introduced into the interior by the Khalif
himself, in order to obviate the reproach of having spent BO much
money for nothing. Many of the Arabs relate, that, after the
workmen had penetrated to a considerable opth, they found a
vessel containing a considerable sum of gold euln, amounting,
strangely enough, to the exact sum which had been spent on tho
inviigation. Along with the treasure was fennda marble slab,
hearing an old inscription to the eITeet that the money beside it
summed to pay for the work of the inquisitive king; but that, it' he
attempted to penetrate farther, he would expend a large sum and
