'AIN m) su. 6. Route. 419

is the Wuyhorn Quay, bearing a Statue of Lieutenant Waghom,
an enterprising Englishman, who after having spent the best years
of his life in establishing regular communication between England
and India vid Egypt, died in London in poverty in 1850. M. de
Lesseps has placed a French inscription to his memory on the W.
side of the monument.

The large basin farther S. t which has been named Port Ibrd-
him, and is capable. of containing 50 vessels of the largest size,
is divided by massive bnlwarks into two parts, one for vessels of
war, and the other for the mail steamers and trading vessels.

The mouth of the dock is protected by gates. The masonry is
everywhere admirably constructed, particularly that of the massive
breakwater outside the doc The dry dock is 123 yds. long,
25 yds. wide, and 20 ft. in depth.

On theE. side ofthese docks are stakes and buoys indicating the
entrance to the Suez Canal (p. 431), which is at a considerable dis-
tance from the N. extremity of the gulf. (Small boat, see p. 410.)

The Springs of Moses, Arabic'Ain ol.'Ayt'tn) Mesa, lie on
the E. side of the gulf, about 7% M. to the S.S.E. of Suez, or
4% M. from the new docks. (Boats and donkeys, see p. 415.)
The whole of the route thither by land traverses the sand of the
desert, skirting the sea, which lies to the right. Towards the W.
tower the imposing'Attica Mts. tp. 415), which present a most
picturesque appearance on the return route. To the left rise
the yellowish ranges of the Gabcl er-Rdlta, belonging to the long
chain of the Gebet ct-'t" h, and facing the S.E. We are now
traversing Asiatic soil, while at the same time the eye ranges over
part of the African continent.

'At this point, he at the Hellesprrnt, two ditrerent quarters of the
glnbe adjoin each other; bat, instead of Eurupe, we here have the
greater continent utAfrice lying to the W. qusia. The meeting of
these two neighbours here, however, is ofu very ditIerent character.
While Enrupe and Asia salute each other across the Bosphorus and Hei-
lespnnt, adorned with verdant robes and crowned with laurel, as if about
to vie with each other in a peaceful contest of sung, Asia and Africa
seem to seow ] at each other across the Red Sea like wrestlers who have
divested themselves of their garments and are on the point of entering
the lists to fight a iieree battle for the sovereignty of the wovld. On the
African side the'Ataha Mtg. present a bold aad menacing appearance,
while the dreary desert of Asia, situated among the Gehel mrllrsha, bids
defiance to its iuftier'adversary'. (Schubert)

Those who make the excursion by water Reed hardly be reminded
of the profound historical interest attaching to this part of the
Red Sea.

"This is Ihe scene of Pharaoh's attempled passage. and these waves
were once ploughed by the ships uf King Hiram and King Solomon,
which every three years brought gold from Dphir, and ivory, ebony, and
intense, to the harbours of Elath and Eziun Â» Geher. Here, too, once plied
the light Moorish vessels mentioned in the Old Testament, and similar
to the craft now used by the Indu-Arahirurs From this point the thni
cian mariners empluyed by King Neeho began their famous civeumas,,
vigation of Africa about the year 13.6, 600, and at a later period enter.
