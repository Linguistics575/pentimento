TIre Necropolis of Sal.era (frorrr Sokar, p. 1'16 ] extends over an
undulating tract of the desert, which, according to 3L Mariette's
computation, is about 7700 ytls, in length, and 550-f600 yds. in
width It contains sepulehral monuments of every kind, from the
pyramid to the roek-hewn aavern, dating both from the ancient and
the later empire. Many of the recent excavations are now covered
with loose heaps of light-uoloumd sand. The whole of the Neero-
polis has been repeatedly explored both by the Byzantines and the
Khalifs, as uzyll as by modern explorers. Many generations hmc
been enriched by its treasures, and yet an immense profusion of
relies was still left to be discovered by the indefatigable M. Ma-
riette. It is nevcxthcless probable that this mine of antiquities,
which has so marvellously preserved everything committed to its
keeping, is still far from being exhausted.

Ancient writers have recorded many interesting facts regarding
the Necropolis of Memphis, and have mentioned various parts of it
by name. The Pyramids, eleven in number, have indeed been
identiOd, and the Serapuum has hcen t'xnavatcd, but all trace of
many other features have bcem irrevocably lost. Who, for example,
can possibly tell where now to look for the sacred lake across which
the mummy of Apis was conveyed by boat; or the beautiful pas'-
tures near it, which were, once compared uith Homer's asphodc!
