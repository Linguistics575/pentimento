are very characteristic examples of Arabian arishiteetnre. Over the
entrance to the principal dome is inscribed the date 764 of the
Ilegira (A1). 1303).

The interior of the mosque is cruciform, and the four arms of
the cross are roofed with lofty, pointed vaulting. 1n the SE. arm
is the Limin el-U0mi: (Pl, tol, or Sanctuary, with a stone Mamba;
(Pl. 11), from which the sultan sometimes addressed the people.
The frieze ts embellished with a timsly executed Cutie inscription.
Numerous lamps hang from the ceiling. To the sight of the mambar
is the entrance (Pl. 13) to the Jfalvtsiira (P1. li), an interesting
and majestic structure, which has been recently restored; it is BOT-
ered with a dome, 180 ft. in height, and contains the Tomb of
Salt.in ljasan. The pcudentives in the comers, whieh are still
partly preserved, betray the inilueni3e of the classical style.
Around the Walls runs a frieze with texts from the Iiorin in large
letters intertwined.

Hn lcaving this mosque, we proceed to the E. (right) to the
circular Place Ruméleh, from which the Mecca pilgrimage starts
(p. 238), and to the Place Méhémet Ali (JIemhfyeh fiedhleh, or
New Place), formerly called the (rararntdun, on the h'. side of the

'umélch. From the h. side of the Ruméleh a broad carriage-road,
passing two mosques (on the left: the Gamz' Mahmadi. Pl. M.
and beyond it the (uimi''Abderral/rn0n, Pl. .il, siith a decaying
minaret), and affording a view of the Tombs "the Khahfs to the
left, ascends in windings to the Citadel. A shorter and steeper
route, which may be ascended on donkey-hack, diverges to the
right near the beginning of tho earriage-roarl, passing through the
Ih1b el-Azab, flanked With its huge towers. It was in this narrow
and crooked lane, enclosed by lofty walls, and formerly the chief
approach to the oitadol, that the massacre of the \lameluhcs took
place on 15t March 1811 by order of Molyunmed A) i (p.106 ].
Amin Ber, the only one who survived, effected his escape by
making his horse lea }: into the moat, through a gap in the wall.

The Citadel JI-Nara; Pl. F, Cr, f, 2), which should be vis-
ited repeatedly for the sake of the view, was erected in 1166 by
Salhhcddiu (p. 22N, with stones taken from the small pyramids at
Uizeh, the site having been selected, according to Arabian his-
torians, owing to the tart that meat rould be kept fresh here twise
as long as in any other part of Cairo. Although the fortress com-
mands the city, its site is unfavourable in respect that it is itself
twinpletely commanded by the heights of the) lohattam, rising
above it immrQiatoly to the S; thus in 18113 Mohammed'Ali was
