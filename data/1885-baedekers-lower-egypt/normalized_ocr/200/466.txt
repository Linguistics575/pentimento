47'/. M. 25.3521 }; (halt ofabouthalf-au-hour; good refreshment-
room, with a rivil Jtalian landlord, and tolerable quarters for the
night), a thriving, semi-lil-earl town, lies on a branch ofthe fresh-
water canal [ sccaboveh and on the Maize Canal (the ancient Tauite
arm of the Nile, p. 438 ]. It is the capital of the E. province of
Sherltiyeh and seat of a mudir, and is said to contain about 40,000
inhabitants.

The situation of Zaluizir, in the midst of a fertile tract watered
by several canals, and: zonneoted with the richest districts of the
Delta, is extremely favourable, and it is a rapidly improving place.
The soil here has been very carefully Ixultivated since the time of
1rol,1ammet1'Ali CI826), and Zahazih forms the chief centre of the
Egyptian cotton and grain trade. No less than 50,000 tons of
cotton are said to he sold here annually. During the American War
the production of cotton in this district was carried to such an ex-
tent as to threaten all other branches ofagrirmlture with oxtiimtion,
but a just equilibrium has fortunately been again restored. Many
European merchants have onte, es here, and the large e0ttou-faetories
give the place an almost European appearance. Talpixils is also
important as a railway juiiutioutiiu the vicinity, Rear Tell Busta,
lay the aunient Rubustis, or Bubastus (Egyptian Pi-bast; the Pibe-
setk of Ezekiel TEX. 17), the napital of the iiubastite home U). Ot).

The ruins of the ancient Bubastis consist of large and dark mounds
ht debris, visible { mm the railway, and situated s/t m. h-nm the station;
but the piece is uninteresting except to those who endeavour to identify
these shapeless remains with the rlescripr'rurs given hy Herodotus (ii. 137,
156) hf the town and temple of the Egyptian Artemis (Sckhet, Bast, "
Pasht). The site was re-disenvered by Nabus. Wherever an ancient
Egyptian town has stand, there are always tn be found mounds of
hm-th, rubbish, and potsherds, which the Arabs call'Korn'. These mounds
here are of unusual height, retailing the account of the place given by
Herudotns. my informs us that Sabaeu. an Ethiopian monarch, wlso
reigned for 50 years, never caused erimiuais tu be executed, but sent
them back to their native places for the [ Iurpase of hehping up rubbish
to raise the height of the sites (Which had already been done in the
reign of Ramses IL). The tuwn of Buhastis in particular, which 60le
tained the beautiful temple of Bnbastis, seems to have been specially
favoured in this respect, so that, if the story is true, the inhabitants
must often have been getting into lruiible. It is these mounds which are
visible from the railway, but the'nutable temple', of which llcrudutus
says that'there are many litrgcr and man: costly' hut hone equal to it
for beauty nf forru', hits entirely disappeared. it was situated m.: m "rs-
land, whieh was connected with the nraialaad by one approach opposite
the entrance to the temple, and formed by two monts utmduetetl from
the Nile. Each moat was 100 ft, in widtls, and bordered With trees.'As
the temple stands in the centre (1fthe tuwa', says Irevootas,'it may be
8CH'a from every diresstioa, and, as it remained unaltered when the site
of the town was raised, the spectator overluuhs it wherever he unity
happen to he. A wall with raised stone-work surrounds it, and another
