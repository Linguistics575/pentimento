of Cairo. sAtirs% s J. Route, 401

requires to he removed, the most interesting, and after that of
Ti the best preserved, is the-

Magtaba of Ptahhotep, which lies a little to the W. of tho
path from the step-pyramid to Mariette's House.

Ptahhotep, like Ti, lived in the 5th Dynasty, and was it priest of the
Pyramids of Aser, mr-en-mst and the'divine dwelling of r3len-1rau-I10r'.
He also bore a number of other titles. The best portrait of him is on
the E. wall. His cosmme is similar to that of Ti (p. 398). His young
son. with the lock denoting infancy, is holding his stair with his right
hand ztud a hoopoe in his left. The visitor should obsorve the harvest
of the papyrus plant, itnd the games which were, probably connected with
the vintage festival The grapes are being plucked, trodden, and pressed.
A hunting sceuo lower down is full of hummu- and life, and some of the
animals will interest zuologists. Most of the hounds m-e'slughi' (p. 398).
The attack and slaughter of the gazelle is a very spirited scene, Ptah-
hotep also indulges in litorrl1untiuir,. A lien is represented seizing in its
jaws the muzzle of it chw tied up as tr bait, and fastening its claws into
the animal's heck, while the calf stands hehiud its mother, and the
kneeling hunier with his two hounds points out to them the lion on
which he is about to let them loose, The iishiag and fewling scenes are
particularly wall oxeented Ahather successful representation on the
S'Luie wall is the procession of the retainers o? Ptuhhotep hearing otferiugs
from the diherent villages on his estates. Like the mud eru processions
nf pilgrims at Cairo, this eurtoge is headed by pugt its and pr er
lighters, Captive lions trrrd other smaller wild animals arc being carried
in cages, and the master of the dogs is leading his greyhounds and an-
uthee kind of hound resembling a hyerur. Next follow mourdudn-goars,
autelopes, aad oxen. h cow is calving with the aid of: t veterinary sur-
ueou. and a number of calves on tho ground are struggling violently to
disengage themselves from the cards with which they are bound, After
these come 1or: ks of poultry. If the inscriptions are to be believed, Ptah-
hatep possessed 121.000 geese of one kind and 11.210 of another, 1225
swans, 120.000 small geese, 121.022 pigeons, and 111,200 goslings. Among
the domestic poultry are included cranes, which their keeper brings be,
fore his master, counted, end in good m-rltvix Pttrltlootep, sitting on a
throne' Wearing a panther- kin, and anointin" himself with oil, surveys
the rich produce nf his estates, watches the slaughter of his cattle, Apr
provos of the order kept by his clerks and listens to the mu e of harps
tuul flutes. The list is exceedingly instructive owing to the distiurrtuess
of the determinative symbols which aeemnpztuy the carefully written
words. This maggaha also contains tl false tluoia homing T representatiun
of the entrance to .t tomb as a symbol, on the W. wall.

The Maetaba of Saba, to the E. of that of Tr, contains similar
representations, and an enumeration of the various kinds of cattle
possessed by the deceased Of one kind of cattlehe possessed 405,
of another 1237, and of a thild1300; ofcalvos 1220 of one kind,
and 1138 of another. Besides those he had 1308 antelope: 1135
gazelles, 1241 goats of a specits resembling the antelope, aml 1010
herons. The poultry (geese, ducks, and pigeons) is reckoned by

thousands (I = 1000)



After having visited the Necropolis, the traveller may, if time
permit, proceed to the'Mar.taba Far'an', which belongs to the
Bamyhsmt's Egypt L 2nd Ed. 26
