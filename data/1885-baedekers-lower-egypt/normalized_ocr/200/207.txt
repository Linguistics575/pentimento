ed in two leading groups: (ll those of rectanyulurrlun, with
ypuetln'ul columns orpilasters round the open court (see plan of the
mosques of'Amr, p. JM, and Bari } b, p, 28N; end C2) those
which have a rectangular or cruciform court surrounded by eluted
rooms, like the mosque of Sultan [ lawn and most of the tomb
mosques, or those where the tomb is of large, size compared with the
F'alur et-6inu".

The TOMBS of the Muslims (comp. also p. J are generally
situated on high ground, uninf1ueueed hy the moisture ofthe river,
and sometimes in the desert. The chambers are destitute ofdeeora <
tion. Within is a catafaique of stone resting on a more or less devo~
rMedpedestar, and hearing two upright columns { SMIH'IZ } of marble,
or other stone, one ot' which, placed immediately over the head of
the deceased, bears hisname and age, with texts from the Koran. At
the top of the shihid is represented the turban ofthe deceased, the
form of Which indicates his rank. Over the eatafarques of Persorts
of distinction are erected dome-shapeil canopies, resting on four
columns or pilasters, or their tombs have the closed form of those
of the siw'khs eirezuiy mentioned. On festivals the catafaiques
and hollow parts of the pedestals are eovered with palin-branehe
Honors, and basilieum. On these occasions the friends, and espen -
ally the female relatives, of the deceased often spend whole days
by the tomb, engaged in prayer and nimsgiviug. For these mour-
ners it was necessary to provide aeoommodation, and the result is
that a complete mausoleum, with its rooms for the family, sebil,
school, stables, custodian's residene, e, etc., is often nearly as CE-
teusivo as the mosques themselves, while some of them are so large
as almost to present the appearance of a small deserted town. To
huiidings of this kind the name oUh5sh is applied. One of the most
imposing "these is the tomh-mosque of Sultan Barluiti.

The Dwelling-Houses, which rarely have more than two
stories, are built in very various styles, but the following rules are
generally Observed in their construction: - Cl) The principal
rooms, particularly those of the Ilurem (p. is?) look into the court
or garden, if there be one. (2) The windows looking to the street
are smaller placed very high, and strongly barred, while those
of the upper floors are closed. with 1aushrebiyel1 (p. 181), which,
however, are gradually being superseded by glass-windows with
shutters. (3) The eutranee-door (l'l, l, o, behind which is the
seat (Jlug'laba, Pr. I, 2) of the doorkecpcr, is generally low and
narrow, and the passage (Pl. L 3) loading from the street to the
court is built in the form ofan angle, to prevent people from seeing
into the court. Cl) The court (116%, Pl. l, J) is planted with trees and
unpaved, and contains a well of water that has hrterccl through from
the Nile. This water, however, is generally more or less brackish,
anti is used only for Washing purposes and for the cattle. (O) By
the entrance to the court, and on the sumu level, is the) Imn'lum
