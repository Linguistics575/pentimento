from the country.

(9). ABMBNXANS AND szs. This section of the community is
about as numerous as the last, and in some respects contrasts
favourably with it. The Armenians generally possess excellent
abilities, and a singular aptitude for learning both Oriental and
European languages, which they often acquire with great gram-
matital accuracy. Many of them are wealthy gnldsmiths and jewel-
lers, and they often held important government offices.

The Jews are often distinguishable by their red hair from the
native Egyptians, as well as by other characteristics Most of them
are from Palestine, but many have recently immigrated from War-
lachia. All the money-ehangers in the streets (: mrr√©f), and many
of the wealthiest merchants of Egypt, are Jews, and notwithstand-
ing the popular prejudice entertained against them, owing as is
alleged to their disregard of cleanliness, they now form, thanks to
the impartiality of the present government, one of the most highly
respected sections of the community.

CIO). EUROPEANS. The number of European residents and
visitors in Egypt at the census of 1882 was S2,000, exclusive of
the British army of occupation. The Greeks are most numerously
represented, then the Italians, French, English (including Maltese ],
Austrians (including many Dalmatians), and Germans. The tru-

consul of their own, are distributed among the above leading clas-

Greeks of all classes are generally traders. They constitute the aris-
tocracy of Alexandria, and the vietual-dealers (ba.k.kdl) in all the
other towns are mostly Cheeks. They are the proprietors of the
numerous small banks which lend money 01 ] good security, both to
the peasantry and the government oflieials, at a rate of interest
sometimes amounting to b' per cent monthly, the maximum per-
mittcdbylaw; and they ate the orrlyEurop0ans who hare established
themselves permanently as merchants beyond the emriiues of Egypt
proper. The Cheeks also have the uneuviahlc notoriety of com-
mitting numerous murders, thefts, and other crimes, hut it must
be home in mind that they are by far the most numerous section
of the European community (35,000 from Greece alone, besides
many Turkish subjeets), and that some 30,000 of them belong to
the lowest class of emigrants from an unhappy and ill-touditioned
country Many of these crimes must, moreover, be regarded as the
outcome of the sadly misdirected daring and ability which
characterise their nation. The superiority of the Greeks to the
