or chief magistrate or mayor of the village, usually known simply as
shékh (plur. shil'tkh ],

In the larger towns there is a magistrate of this kind in each
quarter (at Cairo Mty-three), over whom are placed profects oflarger
sections (she" kh et-Lumn). Over the whole of these presides the Mu-
dir, and lastly over the latter in some cases a Hokmdér with very
extensive powers. Other provinces again are governed by specially
appointed inspectors, who occupy the highest rallkin their respective
jurisdictions.

If the administrative reforms proposed by England actually come
into effect, the duties of the provincial governors will be very ma-
terially cdrenuuseribed. The police administration has been math:
:1 separate department, and Egypt has been divided into the three
police districts of Cairo, Alexandria, and Upper Egypt, mthh under
an inspector general. The administration of justice is to be fNul-
mitted entirely to the native courts, while l special minister is to
have the charge of ram0-making and other public works. In order,
however, to afford some idea of the importance of the Mudir in the
public life of the provinces, we give here a short account of the
functions he has hitherto had to perform.
