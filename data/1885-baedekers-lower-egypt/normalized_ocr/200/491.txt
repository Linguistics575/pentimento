to two different monuments, bear Persian cuneiform and hierogly-
phie inscriptions. In the latter the name of Darius occurs. The
representations still preserved exhibit a curious combination of
Persian and Egyptian characteristics The winged disk of the sun
of the Egyptians resembles the'Feruer' of the Persian monuments.
The Persian time is adorned with the heads of two kings, opposite
to each other. The ftgures are in the Egyptian style, and between
the outstretched hands of each is an Egyptian'eartouehe', or frame
for the name of a king. One of the blocks bears hieroglyphic: in
front (half obliterated) and cuneiform characters at the back.

The Canal now enters what is called the Small Basin of the
Isthmus, which consists entirely of shell formations, and thence
leads into the Large Basin of the Bitter Lakesi (p. 425). At
each end of the large basin rises an iron lighthouse, 60 it. in
height. The water is of a bluish green colour. The banks are ilat
and sandy, but a little to the left rises the not uupicturesque
range of the Gabe! Geneffeh (pt 41-1), A little farther on (near the
89th kilométre) is the cutting which conducts the Canal through
the rocky barrier of the Serapeum, The railway station (p. 414) is
near the freshwater canals A flight of steps ascends to the top
of the left bank of the Canal. The village, which was founded in
1860, contains several pleasant little gardens.

The ruins from which the station derives its name were { nunerly
supposed to have belonged to a Serapeurn, which, according to the itiuer,
: Lry of Antonina, once stood in this neighbourhund; but they can hardly
have belonged to a temple of Serapis nr to any other sanctuary, and
Lepsius is doubtless right in pronouncing them to be the remains of a
third mahumeht erected on the bank of the ancient canal by Darius
ip.h32). He found here a fragment of the Wing of ti disk in the Persian
style, at stone with cuneifurm characters, and a third hearing hiewglyplr
ice, all of which s30trf1'rraed his opinion, The blocks of limestone lying
on the ground belonged to the pedestals of the monuments, The ruins
of the reel Sempeum hrrve been probably discovered in the remains of at
stone building, about "paces luugtfmm E. to W.), and 53 paces broad
(from N. to so, situated ahontm M to the s. or the 14th kilometre stone
on the freshwater eanal. Excavations made there hztve brought to light
a few Egypto-Romo antiquities, which probably once belonged to: t
village connected with the Serapeum. in accordance with the rule re-
garding the temples of Serapis, the village must have lain entirely beyond
the precincts ot the sanctuary.

At the 85th kilometre is situated Tustin, which is easily recog-
nised by the whitewashed dome of the tomb of a certain Shéklt En-
nedck, a wealthy chief, who, after having made a pilgrimage to
Mecca, is said to have presented his cattle and his gardens to the
poor, and to have spent the rest of his life on the Gebel Maryam
near Lake Timsih in pious meditation. Excavations in the neigh-
bourhood of Tustin have led to the discovery of many interesting
fossil remains of large animals belonging to the meioeene tertiary
