Ibrahim Pasha,) Iohammed "Ali's adopted son, had al-
ready taken the reins of government, in consequence of
Mohammed's incapacity, in January 1843, but he (lied in
November of the same year, and before his adoptive Either.

"Abbits Pasha, a son of 1.'usrln Pasha and grandson or
Mohammad "Ali, has generally been described by Europeans
as a brutal, vicious, and rapacious prince. This, however,
Would seem to he a somewhat distorted view of his character,
arising from the fact that he had inherited from his Arab
mother a certain amount of ferocity and even cruelty, coupled
with the dislike of a true son of the desert for European in-
novations. He, however, maintained the strictest discipline
among his ofiUals, and the public security in Egypt was
never greater than during his reign. His death is attributed
to assassination.

Se'id Pasha, hi successor, Was MoyarmuedrAli's third
son. Thanks to ] s enlightened government and his taste
for European civilisation, Egypt made considerable progress
during his reign, although her tinanees were far from being
in a satisfactory condition. He equalised the inr-ideime of
taxation, abolished monopolies, improved the canals, com-

of his education in France and had there acquired the strong
preference for Eumpean institutions which characterised
him throughout his reign Unfortunately, however, he com-
bined with this eniighteument a profound egotism and a
tendency to duplicity and cunning. which in the end, in
spite of his natural talents, proved his min. Host of his
innovations, such as the foundation ofmannfactaries and the
construction of canals, railways, bridges, and telegraphs,
were planned mainly in his own interest, though of murse

to produce an impression in Europe than from real concern
for the needs of his subjectst As time went on he succeeded
