from Pa Hebit. Some idea of the immense changes Which have
taken place in the vegetation of this region since the era of hiero-
glyphics may be formed from the fact that, while the papyrus plant
was sedulously and successfully cultivated on both banks of the
Nile in the neighbourhood of Sebennytus, not a single specimen of
this useful plant is now to be met with, either here or in anyother
part of the Delta. On the N.W. side of the rains of the temple
lies the village of Behhit, and adjoining it still exists the sacred
lake of the temple. The ruins of the venerable sanctuary of Isis
form an imposing and most picturesque mass of blocks, fragments
of columns and architraves, ceiling slabs, and other remains, a1-
together about 400 paces in circumference. We are reminded of
the animal sacred to Isis by the reliefs of cows and of frgares with
cows' heads on several of the blocks of stone. The name of
Ptolemy ll. Philadelphus I. (BA). 284-22 (O, the founder of
the temple, occurs in several plaees. The structure must have
been a very costly one, as it consisted entirely of beautiful granite,
1rhiefly grey, and partly red in colour, brought from a great distance.
The sculptures (haulreliefs and reliefs en creme) are mostelaborately
executed. Several of the female heads and busts, and some of the
eows' heads also, are remarkably fine. In some of the inscriptions
the l1iet0glypltios are unusually large, in others they are of small
and elegant form, and in all they are executed in the somewhat
flonrisbiug style peculiar to the age of the Pt0lornies. The chief
deities revered here were Isis, with Osiris andITorus, besides whom
occur Sch and Nut, 11athorand Khunsu, the triad of Sehu7 Tetnut,
and Anhur, Scbek, Hapi [ the Nile), and Anubis in tho form of
Horus, as the avenger of his father. We may also remark here that
Anubis, the martyr, wasanative of Naisi, or the Iseum, on the site
of which we now stand. On the W. side of the rains is an inter-
esting large slab of grey granite t veined with red, on which is
represented the king offering a gift of land to Osiris and Isis,'the
great divine mistress of Uehit'. Higher up there is another block
of grey granite, with a representation of Isis euthroued, and of the
king offering to'his mother' two small bags of the green mineral
called mafkat and mes.tem, or eye-paint. The inscriptions consist of
the usual formulae regarding olfcrirtgs, None of them are perfect,
bat many must still be concealed among the ruins. The pylons
have disappeared, and with them the historical inscriptions also.
One of the sculptures represents a procession of the gods of the
nome, but unfortunately their names are not given. In one case
Isis calls the king'her brother'. Adjoining a ligure of the goddess
is the inscription: -'Isis, mistress of Wbit, who lays everything
before her royal brother'. On a grey hloek of granite, lying in an
oblique position, is represented the sacred bark of Isis, resembling
those seen elsewhere in bronze only, The cabin is like a house of
two stories, in the upper 0f which sits the goddess, with oow's horns
