be prepared to pay more than persons familiar with the language
and customs.

The following description of the city is so arranged that even t new-

iu the following order.

The Muski, with its JI, continuation the Rue Ncuve, is the
chief thoroughfare of Cairo, nearly 1 If. in length, mm runs in a
nearly straight direction from W. to 19., from the Ezbekiyeh plaee
to the tombs of the hhalifsi This street, the beginning of which
has frequently been sketched by European artists, has now to a great
extent lost its Oriental characteristics, but it still presents many
picturesque and attractive features Lcomp. p. Q44 ]. Among the
shops, many of which present quite a European exterior, are nu-
merous tobacco and cigar stores, emporiums of clothing, and stalls
of fez-makers, with the pecuiinrly shaped iron they use in their
trade. [ The price of a fez or .tsriuish varies from 2fr. to 15 fr.
according to the material with which it is lined.)

On entering the Muski we observe on the right, above us, an
Arabian school (p. 250). We ascend the street to a small place
called the Rand-I'oint (P1. u, 3). Immediately before this place is
reached, we diverge to the right, and follow the first lane to the
left [ running parallel with the Mushi ], passing a red and yellow
mosque 0n the right, and disregarding the attraction of the Euro-
pcau glass wares sohl here. Pursuing a straight direction (LL, as
straight as the crooked lanes admit of), we pass the end of a Hap-
row lane on the right, through Which we perceive the entrance to
an uninteresting Greek church, and the covered entrance to a bazaar
lately burned down, on the left. Turning to'theright, we next
enter the sex; eI-Igiamzawi (Pl. o, 2, 3), or bazaar of the Christian
merchants (Syrians and Copts), who vie with their Mohammedan
feliow-tradesmen in the exorbitance of their demands, and whose
thief wares are European calico, porcelain, and drugs (which last
are sold at all the bazaars). Near the end of this street, a little
before its junction with the broader street Et-Crhortyels (see below),
We observe on the right the 5m; eI-'Attâ‚¬trin, or spiee-merkct, which
is easily distinguished by its aromatic odours. The perfumes of
Arabia, genuine and adulteretcd, was-eamlles, and drugs are the
chief commodities here. Attar of roses is sold by weight at high
prices. The small bottles into which it is put have very narrow
necks, through which one drop at a time only can pass. Customers
should of course see that the bottles are accurately weighed be-
forehand.

beyond the'Attzirin Bazaar (still keeping the Elihoriyeh car-
riage way on out left) we next enter its eoutinnation, the Sh ]; e1-
