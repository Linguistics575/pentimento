Mohammed Ali to punish them for pillaging .1 caravan; but it ap-

In 2hhrs. more the liTrdi Barak reaches the Wddi Silt, which
after 3hhr. turns sharply to the left, leading to the Wbli Sidr,
while the Wadi al-Mzrayih on the right leads to the Debbet er-
Rumlah. Our route runs to the N.W.7 gradually ascending, and
and in 1/2 hr. reaches a narrow sandy plain called the Debibetsh√©kh

On the neighbouring hill, (390 ft. in height, are situated a
number of interesting monuments, dating from the period of the
Pharaohs, and re-dir, eovcred by Niebuhr in 1702. The ascent from
the Wadi Merattemeh, which is somewhat fatiguing, and requires
a steady head, occupies fully an hour. 0n the level plateau
on the top are numerous monuments with hieroglyphic inserip-
tions. There are traces of MI old enclosing wall, 57 yds. long, and
23 yds. broad, surrounded by sixteen ancient Egyptian upright
monuments Cl. Similar stones hearing inscriptions are lying on
the ground, and there are the ruins of a small temple, The sanc-
tuary and a proneos of this editiec Were hewn in the rocks in the
reign of Amenemha 111. ngth Dyn.), and furnished with hand-
somely pMr1tedinssriptions (wh'uyh, howevor, are nearlyoblitemted),
and niches for images. In the reign of Thothmes Ili. (18th Dyn.)
the temple was extended towards the w. by the erection of a pylon
and anterior court, and several rooms on the W. side were aftor-
wards added by other kings. The dimensions of the whole building
are "omparativcly small. As in the Wirli Maghira (p. 4'31), the
goddess llathor, and particularly the llalhor of Mafhat (p. 402),
was principeuy worshipped here. The iusn'riptions indicate that
this spot, iustead of being a hurial-plm-e with its tombstones, as
one would at lirgt have supposed, was a religious ctlillee with a
trumber of nhambers for various purposes.
