Library. 01mm. 3. Route. 269

A long series of tortuous streets, called Derb el-Crami) rnt:
C'syeamore street'), running not far { 10111 the canal, leads hence
towards the N. to the I',0ulevam1 Mcrluinaet Ali. After fully half-a-
mile we come to a small ogen syaoe by the canal, shaded by some
fine acacias. The gate 011 the right leads to the viceroyal *Library
(Kutubkhtineh' Pl. D130), founded by the Khedive Ismail Oil 24th
March 1870, in the left \1 ing of the oiliee of the minister ofpublie
"orship. The collection consists of a number of books formerly
preserved in various other institutions, and of others purchased or
presented by the Khedive, and is dedicated to the use of the public.
One of the finest presentations to the collection is the valuable
library of Muetat'a Pasha, which occupies a separate room. The
whole library consists of about 25,000 vols., 1rl1ietly Arabic and
Turkish works, and there is a small European department, prin-
cipally containing seientifio works in Freneh, Which is to be gradu-
ally extended. The library is open to the public from 3 to G and
from 7 to 10 o'clock by Arabian time, Le. about three hoursir1 the
foreman and three hours in the afternoon, and the ofeeials are
instructed to afford visitors all the information in their power.
Books must be consulted in the reading-room, the use of Which
is accorded to persons provided with a permission from the ministry
of public instruction or with a tyertitieate from their consul, bear-
ing their names, and available for a year. The library is closed 011
Fridays; and during the month of Ramatjén it is open in the
afternoon only. The chief credit of arranging and increasing this
tine collection of books belongs to two Germans, Dr. Stern and Dr.
Spitta-Bey (d. 1883), but the present director is MI Arab shékh,
named Murad Eifendi.

The libcrality with which the treasures of Muslim literature are thus
thrown open to the European Imblic is deserving of all praise. A spe-
e1a1 feature of the Hbrrrry, possessed by 1111 other Oriental collection
available to Frat1k.s, consists of the Mus/s if, or copies of the 11011111,
collected (1011 various mosques of Cairo; and now preserved £10111 de-
struction. They 111-0 remarkable for their large size, superb execution,
tmd great age, and constitute the tinest existing specimens 0111111111111 11-h

The oldest specimen of the F0riit1is one in the Cafe, or early Arabian,
character, 12 inches in length, and 83/1 inches in width. It contains one-
half of the 1101311 only, and is in a very damaged condition, having,
moreover, once been injured by ilre. The tttles oflhe snrehs are bordered
with gold, and the carefully written text illuminated with coloured letters.
According to the testimony of a shékh who saw the "cable book' in
its perNet Londitwn this Koran Was written by Gafm' e: det'lg, son of
Mohammed el- 4111111, son of'Ali 2911 e1 -'Abidta, 5011 drrpud, wi, ofrAli,
son o? Alan Tilib and son- in- Jaw of the Prophet. This LVaHar was a great
chemist and' scholar, whose papil Tartusi, uCLDrding t0 Ibn Khallikuu
ct, MI, ed.otBu11tk), once stated that he had written about 50. ] duTerent
pamphlets He lived in the years 80-148 of the Hegirh and this Kori"
would thus be about IIN) years oN. There is consrderable doubt' us to
the accuracy of this story, but the 115.15 certainlyo of very early late.

The other tine large copies oru1eF0rG1, abouttwentyi IV all, are aflater

Eahrite Mamelnkes (1'2u) -1iks'2) and of the Circassian hlnmelukes (13132 151 (1),
