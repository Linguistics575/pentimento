cessorst it was not unnatural that he should have showed special vener-

Every Pharaoh was, as we are aware' regarded as Em earthly incarnation

Pe.rerov.e, afterwards chose the Sphinx to symbolise the divine nature nf
their mission as monarchs. and it was a favourite practice to crown the lion's
body with a head hearing their own features. The Sphinx representing

wings as symbols of speed and ofthe power of rising above earthly things.

About 3/: hr. in a due s. direction from the Sphinx, on the outskirts
of the desert, is a spot known to the Beduins where numerous Nssils

curious searurchins (Clypeaster), which the Beduias fre nentiy oirermrsale.

A few paces to the SE. of the Sphinx is situated the *Granite
Temple, a large building constructed of granite and alabaster, dis-
covered by M. Mariette in 1853. The different chambers are now
kept free of sand, so that they can be examined in every part. The
object of the building has not yet been ascertained, but there Pon
be no doubt that it was in some way connected with the Sphinx.
The inscription of Khnfn mentioned at p. 364 speaks of a Temple
of the Sphinx. The statues of Chephren (pp. 305, 307) found here
seem to indicate that he was the founder of this structure; and, it
so, this would be the only temple handed dov n to us from the prim
zuval monarchy. At the same time the building so closely resembles
a mastaba (v. JN), that, particularly as it stands in the Neeropolis
"Mcuuphis, it was perhaps rather one of those monuments which
were dedicated to the rites of the dead; and it seems not iaipro-
bable that Chephren, who built the Second Pyramid as his tomb,
erected this edifiee as a place of assembly for the worshippers,
of his mums. The building is a tine example of the simple
and majestic architecture of that remote period, when the art of
working the hardest kinds of stone had already attained perfection.
The chisel which in the hand of the stone-mason shaped these
blocks of granite with such exquisite skill _ could doubtless, when
wielded by the sculptor, easily create a statue of Chephren.

Descending by a recently constructed Passage Cl'l. m) in steps,
protected by walls against the encroachment of the sand, we pass
through a door (5) into a Passage (MI) descending towards the E.,
6ft. b'in. in width and 79 ft. in length. 0n the right, halfway
down this passage, is the entrance to a Chamber (d) constructed
entirely of blocks of alabaster; opposite to it, on the loft, is the
Entrance (d) to a tlight of steps, which turns at a right angle and
ascends to a small chamber, where an opening on the S, side leads
to the granite 100? of the temple. This passage and chamber are,
also constructed ofalabastcr. At the E. tend of the corridor we enter
a Hall (Pl. el, 79 it. in length LN. to S.) and 23 ft. in width, eru-
hellished with sis monolithic pillars of granite varying from 3 it,
