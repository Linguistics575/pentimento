1/4 hr. the defile of El-Buwéb, Le. little gate, or EC-BCA,. gate,
where the valley contracts to a width ot about 20 ft. We Widi
Ftrin terminates here, and the Wadi esh-Shglch (p. 520) begins.

The part of the wadi Firiu hetween the unweh and the Hermit,
which new forms the must fertile oasis in the peninsula, was once eleke,
as is proved by the deposits of earth, 60400 l in height, in the angles
of the valley throughout itswhole distance, efeeture observable nowhere
else. In consequence of the peculiar oontigurauon of the surrounding
mountains. including the Jehel) mse group mm the Serhm, every fall or
rain, Snow, the dew in the whole neighbourhood of this extensive regiun,
found its Way through dilrereat channels into this basin; and, after the
barrier at { Iererit had been removed, the hrookstill remained as a rent
or the ancient lake, The sudden appearance of this slreamletin the rocky
valley, and its as sudden disappearance in the rock at EhHesweh, must
have been e censtent source of wonder to the vivid imagination of the
inhabitants of the desert, and it therefore seems natural that the pheno-
menon shonlrl have been ascribed to the miraculous rod of Moses,

Two routes lead from El-Bumit to the Sinai monastery. The
easier, through the Wadi esh-8luilrh (11 hrs. to the monastery),
is more suitable for the return-jouruey vii v5arlnit. el-Khidetn
(p. 522); the other, rougher (101mm. to the monastery ], but more
picturesque, leads through the Wadi Seléf and across the interest-
ing Nahb et-IIiwi. We select the secoml of these routes.

The Widi esh-Shékh, which frequently expands into pictur-
esque basins, soon diverges to the N.E. (see p. 520), and we reach
(1/4 hr.) the entrance to the Wadi MIM, a monotonous and witul-
ing valley through which our route runs for nearly Ghours. 0n the
right opens the Wadi er-Rimm (p. 497 ] ascending to Mt. Serlril,
and on the same side the Wadi Umm T & khu, containing several
curious stoue-huts in the form of beehives, called'r1awimis', to
Which the absurd tradition attaches, that the Israelites sought re-
fuge in them from tormenting llies. In less than 2 hrs. We reach
the Wzidi'E.ij0tvi, through Which the road from To (p. 518) on
the Red Sea joins our routefrom the SW. Mt. Serbil now at length
becomes visible in all its majesty, and remains in sight behind us
for 1/2 hour. We next pass the Wadi Am T & lib to the left, at the
entrance of Which the prophet Mohammed, When he Was marching
against Syria (Shim) with his uncle Ttlib, is said to have rested.
Several other small widis are passed on the right and left. At
the upper end of the valley at the foot of tlm Nnkh el-hlz'twi Pass,
there is a good eampiug-plaoe, commanding a fi11e distant view of
Mt. Serbil. At this point begins the ascent of the Nalrb e1-iawi
Defue [ 4930 ft.), occupying 2rh hrs., though an active walker
might reach the top in one hour. The camels progress very slowly
in this narrow, steep, rocky pass, so that the traveller will flr1d it
pleasanter to dismount, and walk up the hill. The granite rocks
on each side, weathered into singularly fantastic forms, are up-
wards of 800 ft. in height; the gorge is strewn with stones of all
sizes; the eamel-path skirts the hard and uneven cliffs which
