shouting, are ferried across the 111111: Canal. We then eithes pitch

the descendants of the wild and rebellious Bashmurites and 1hi
mites who gave so much trouble to the troops of the khalifs Mer-
win II. [ 744-50 ] and Maru" (613-33), and also of the Semitic
shepherds who inhabited the Menzaleh region at a very remote pe-
riod. They 11 ere called Arms, or, with the article, Pi-Amu, by the
Egyptians, and the name was afterwards corrupted to Biamitos.
They were also knowa as J'i-Sliemer, Which was corrupted to
Bashmurites. In the Christian period they belonged to the orthodox
church, and styled themselves Melekites, "loyalists', a name
which they still apply to themselves in the form'Malakiyin',
although they have long since embraced El-Jslinn. The hope of
bahshish makes them civil to travellers
