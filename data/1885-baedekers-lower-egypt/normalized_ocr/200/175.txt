of the villages of Syria the traveller will olvsorve small dome-
covemd buildings, with grated windows, and snrnmnnted by the
crescent. These are the so-iuuled Wall's, mausoloa of saints, "
tombs of shékhs. In the interior there is usually a block of stone,
hewn in the shape of a sarcophagus and covered with a green or
red eloth, on which texts from the J.ioriu1 Me embroidered in gold
or silver. The walls are generally embellished with paintings
representing the sacred cities of El-lslim, and meented in an
amusingly primitive style. Suspended front the ceiling by cords
and threads are little boats, Ostrich eggs, and numerous paper
bags tills1 with sacred earth from Mecca. In one corner am
a thick was candle and a heap of bones of all kinds. The tumb is
usually surrounded by a bnrial-ground, where certain persons have
the privilege of being interred. Sehools are also frequently eoriile, et-
ml with theseweli's, shreds of clothare often seen suspended from
the railings of these tombs7 or on certain trees which are consi-
dered sacred, having been placed there by devout persons. This
curious custom is of ancient origin,

About the end of the 18th century a reaction against the abuses
of El-lslém sprang up in Central Arabia. The \VAHHABITBF, or
Wahhahces, named after their foumler "Abd el-Walshib, endeav-
oured to restore the religion to its original purity; they destroyed
all tombs of saints, including even those of \lohemmed and F, lt1sén,
as objects of superstitious reverence, MIL ]. sought to restore the
primitive simplieity 0fthe prophct's code of morals; and they even
forbade the smoking of tobacco as being intoxicating They soon
became a great political power, and had not Mohammad Ali deemed
it his interest to suppress them, their iritlueuee would have been
far more widely extended than it now is. - As to tho 5'cru1si

We have hitherto spoken of the doctrines of the Sunniio (from
summ,'trarlition0, Who form one great sect of El-Islim. At an early
period the Smhrms (from shi'a,'sect') seceded from the Sunnites.
They assigned to (Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammad, a rank equal
or even superior to that of the prophet himself; they regarded him
as an incarnation of the Deity, and believed in the divine mission
of the imims descended from him. El-Mahdi, the last "these,
is believed by them not to have died, but to he awaiting in
concealment the coming of the last day. The Persians are all
sldites. Towards theWest also Slli'itism was widely disseminated
at an oarly period, particularly in Egypt under the régime of the
Fitimite sovernigns, The Shi'ites are extremely fanatical, refus-
ing even to eat in the society of persons of a different ereed.
The other sects, which are eUefly eoniined to Syria [ the Mehiw'rbeh,
the Ismdtttyels, the Nosuirigdr, tho l/ruses, cm), are noticed in
Uaedeker's Syria and Palestine.
