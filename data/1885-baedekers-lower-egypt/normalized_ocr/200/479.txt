The temperature and character of those springs vary, They range
from 70° to 810 Fahm and while some of them are quite drinkable and
but slightly brackish, others are very bitten, and nauseous to the taste
The springs rise in the midst of gardens, where the nature) hilleeks have
been levelled, in huruel-suaped basins, within whieh the water wells
up from numeruus small holes; and every new hole the visitor makes
with his stick becomes the source of a new spring. The natural
eenditiuh of the springs, however, is more satisfactorily observed in
the desert, outside of the opuntia enclosure. About n thousand paces
to the E. of the oasis stands th suluavrprrlm, at the font ot'ahilluek rising
about 16 ft. above the level of the plain. Oh the top of this hilltlck is n
pool, Mt. in diameter and 1yzft. in depth. The water, 70° in tempera-
ture, is very salt and bitter, and the bottom of the pool is covered with
iuky-blarylc mud. The discharge of the spring forms a stream 3U inches
in width, whieh, however, is suou swalluwed up by the desert sand at the
foot of the hill. Numerous water-beetles, which clung to the lutud when
touched, the Melania Pasciolrrta Oliv. which seemed to luxurittte in the
tepid water, and, as I was much pleased to see, myriads of transparent
waterrileas (Cypris t Jeete huh.) dispurtetl themselves in the basin. 1n
the hollow of my hand I caught tiuzens of them, which swam about for
a time with their fringed feelers. and at length got ashore. I next ole
served in the mud the innumerable transparent scales of dead insects,
and l at length discovered tlurt the reek enclosing the hill was entirely
composed of Cypris skins. It was now obvious that the Cyprides had
built the hill,) lilliuns of these little insects bad in the cuurse of ages
cemented with their calcareous integuments the send through which the
springs vise, thus at length forming a kind of wall around it: amt when
the surface was in this way ratsed beyond the height tu whith the pres"

nnd compelled to seek some other outlet.'. The pressure of the
water evidently comes from the "zihah Nts, although they are IO-N miles

with their remains, su that the surface of the water is at some places
40-50ft. ehove the level of the desert, and 100m above the level of the
see, these waters would simply have been lost among the Sands Of the
desert.' to. Frans.)

Unless the traveller is bound for Mt. Sinai, he will probably
not extend his journey farther in this direction. To some of our
readers, however, the following brief description of the Iled Sea
and its shores will not be unacceptable
