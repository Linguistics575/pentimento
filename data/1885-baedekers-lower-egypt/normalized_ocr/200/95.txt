for sowing by the use of the plough. The seed is scattered over the
still soft and moist soil, and is then either pressed into it by means
of a wooden roller, beaten into it with pieces of wood, or twdden
in by oxen i. Throughout the whole country a period of four
months elapses between se? d-time and the completion of the l1ar-
vest. The winter harvest is, therefore, over in Upper Egypt about the
middle of February, in Central Egypt about the middle of March
and in the Delta towards the mid of April. In Upper and Central
Egypt this is tho most important harvest of the whole year. The
principal crop everywhere is wheat (occupying 500/0 of the iiulrls
in Upper Egypt and 30 o/o in the Delta), next to which are barley
(in the proportion of 100/oand 110/0 in these regions respectively),
clover [ 100/0 and Q4 0/0 respectively ], and broad beans ('20 "/0 and
130/0 respectively).

(2) The Stsmmer Crops ('h" p-estf' or'Er-rfh.lr) are much more
varied than those of winter, but they are comparatively unimportant
in Upper and chtrulEgypt, as the cultivable land in these regions
is very narrow, and belongs ohietly to the'ltai' category, two-thirds
of it being under water during summer. In the Delta, on the other
hand, summci is the farmer's most important setismh The vagr-
