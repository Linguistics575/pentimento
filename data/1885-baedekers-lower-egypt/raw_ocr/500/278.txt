245 Route 3. CAIRO. Street Scenes.

One of the most popular characters to he met with in the streets
of Cairo is the Sigiti, or WnTisrt-Cnrtrtrrsn, with his goatshiu of
w ater, carried either by himself or by a donkey who still plies his
trade, although the new waterworks (p. 381) could easily supply
every house in the city, as w c1] as the public sebils (p.177),with
water, and though on many of the houses there are brass tubes
through which passers- -by may take a draught from the main pipes.
llis usual cry is .-.. 'yt uuwad Att/il? Chnay God recompense me).
T he labour he undergoes during eight months in the year, when
he, brings his heavy load all the way from the Nile, is very severe
and miserably underpaid; but during the four months when the
river is rising he obtains his supply from the canal by which Cairo
is intersected. The springs,
being generally brackish, are
not suitable for drinking. Many
of the sahkas sell water to
the people in the streets. These
are known as 'salcl.ca sharbeh',
and they carry their supply of
water either in a skin or in a
large earthen-ware vessel on
their backs. Theyoffer adraught

of the sahhas to dispense water gratuitously. The satlia then
shouts in a singing tone, ‘sebit Allah p0'a.tshiin yt mih/eh', thus in-
viting all thirsty persons to drink gratuitously; while he occasion-
ally turns to his employer, who generally stands near him, with
the words, ‘God forgive thy sins, 0 dispenser of the drink-offering’,
or ‘(iod have mercy on thy parents', to which the persons who
have partaken of the water reply, 'arntn' (amen"), or 'God have
mercy on them and on us'. After numerous blessings of a similar
kind have been interchanged, the salilia hands the last cup of water
to hl, employer, with the words, 'The remainder for tho liberal
man, and Paradise for the confessor of the Unity! 10d bless thee,
thou dispenser of the, tlrinli-ofTv,riug !'

The, J.lemali, who belong to one of the orders of clerviahes
(p. LM), are, also engaged in selling water, which they tla-.
vour with orange-hlossom (MM), while others add a little brandy
('i:rli-srrs) or grape-juice (telhb). There are also numerous itin-
