Boundaries and Area (comp. Map, p. 30). The countries sub-.
ject to the supremacy of the Khedive embrace by far the greater
part of N.E. Africa, or nearly the whole of the territory adjacent to
the Nile. The natural boundaries of the vassal kingdom founded
by Mohammad 'Ali and bequeathed by him to his successor in 1848
are formed by the Mediterranean Sea 011 the N., the Libyan Desert
on the W., the Red Sea on the E., and Abyssinia, Which may be
called the Quito of Africa, 011 the S.E. These boundaries include
EGYPT PROPER, with the five oases of the Libyan desert and part of
the peninsula of Sinai, the NUBIAN VALLEY OF THE NILE, with the
Nubian desert regions, and lastly the so-called EGYPTIAN Stmks,
which consists of the districts of Ttska, 8enntr, and Arordo/7m. The
Khedive Isrna'il, whose dominions were secured to him as a fief
hereditary in the male line, extended his boundaries still farther to
the 8., S.E., and S.W. Thus he purchased Sautkin and Masau'a on
the Red Bea, and Zéla' and Berbera on the Gulf of 'Aden, four im-
portant seaports and commercial places, together with the coast
districts adjoining them, which formerly belonged directly to the
Turkish government; and in the same way he acquired part of the
coast of the Somali, extending to the equator, a district replete
with still untouched natural treasures. The districts of the Bogos
and Galabat on the frontiers of Abyssinia have been occupied with
a view to protect important commercial routes, and together with the
Somtli territory ofHarar have been annexed to the Egyptian empire,
fhtr-d1lr, once an entirely independent principality in the Moham-
medan Stdin, and the terror of its neighbours, has lately been tyon-
qnered by the Egyptians, and the empire of the Khedive has thus
been increased by four very populous provinces, while Mohammed
'Ali, who was less fortunate in his designs on that region, succeeded
in gaining possession of Kordofzin only, the E. part of it. Bogos,
Galabat, and the other provinces adjoining the N. frontier of Abyss-
sinia are, however, constantly exposed to the inroads of their war-
like neighbours, and it will probably be impossible in the long run to
resist the importunate demand of the Abyssinian monarch for their
restitution. The rebellion which broke out in most of the Mahoni-
medan provinces of the Egyptian Sildtn in 1883 threatens to entail
the entire loss of Isrnaril's acquisitions to the S. of Egypt proper.
