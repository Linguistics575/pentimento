86 HISTORY.

 

given by Lepsius, am] now generally accepted, the mythical period
was succeeded by that of the Prinmeval Monarchy, the Hyksos Do-
mination, and the Neil: Empire, which were followed by the supre-
macy or the Persians, the Ptolemics, and the Romans in sueeession.
Another system recognizes between the Old and the New Empire
a Jlidrlle Monarchy, which includes the period of the lkasos. These
divisions, in conformity With the lists of Manetho, are again sub-
divided into Dynasties, or different families of kings, named after
the districts or names (p. 32) of which their founders were natives.

Khul'u and Rhafra have been handed down in the dciesiation
of posterity as pvotligate despisers of the gods, rhietty owing to
the, m't'mmt nl' tht-m given by Jlermlotns (ii. 121-, see p.314 et seq),
who, however, was ill informed with regard lo the earliest period
of Egyptian history. The monuments themselves bear testimuny
lo the fact that the family and eourl, of the builders nf the Great
Pyramids were pious worshippers of the gods, that they were
prnslwmus and wealthy, and that they were indnsirimts and per-
sevo-ring in their undertakings. Al that period the fine arts, and
particularly that of sculpture, attained a perfection which the
FCeyptians never again reached. The inscripfios on the menu-
ments nlm exhibit a high degree of technical skill.
