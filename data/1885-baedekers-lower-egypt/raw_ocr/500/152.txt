from which name an attempt has been made to derive that of the
Greek goddess Themis, like whom Ma is represented as blind, or
at least with bandaged eyes.

Gous OF THE Osrms AND Isis ORDER. We owe to Plutareh a
detailed account of this myth, which has been uniformly corroborat-
ed by the monuments, and which may be briefly told as follows.

Isis and Osiris were
the children of Rhea and
Ghronos, that is, of Nut,
the goddess of space, and
of Seb,the god ofthe earth,
which, owing to its eternal
rejuvenescenee and im-
perishableness, symbolis-
es time. Whilestillin the
womb of their mother, that
is, in the bosom of space,
the ehildreuueearne unit-.
ed, and from their union
sprang Horus. Typhon and
Nephthys, children of the
same parents, likewise
married each other. Osiris
andIsisreignedasahappy
royal pair, bestowing on
Egypt the blessings of
wealth and prosperity.
Typhon conspired against Osiris, and at a banquet persuaded him
to enter a cunningly wrought chest, Which he and his seventy-two
accomplices then closed and threw into the Nile. The river carried
the chest northwards, and so down to the sea by way of the estuary
of Tanis; and the waves at length washed it ashore near the Phe-
nieian Byblus. Meanwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the
country, seeking her lost husband; and she at length succeeded in
discovering his coffin, which she, carried to a sequestered spot and
concealed. She then set out to visit her son Ilorus, who was being
educated at Buto. During her absence Typhon, while engaged in a
boar-lout, foundthe bodyofthe god, eutitinto fourteenpieees, and
scattered them in every direction. As soon as Isis learned what had
happened, she collected the fragments, and wherever one had been
found erected amonnment on the spot to its memory; and this ae-
counts for the numerous tombs of Osiris mentioned as existing in
Egypt and elsewhere. Osiris, however, was not dead. He had 150li-.
tinued his existence and his reign in the lowerregions, and after his
burial he visited his son Horus, whom he armed and trained for battle.
The young god soon began a war against Typhon, and was at length
victorious,although he didnotsueceed intotallydestroying his enemy.
