(now 2171/4 ft.) in length, and they were inclined at an angle of5lo 42' 35".
With regard to the central nne of these pyramids, that to the S. of the
last, the inscriptions state that 'the, dwelling of lla-ea-ttsep stands fast'.
Ti fp, 388) and other priests, whose mastahas were found at Salildira,
presided over the rites connected with this pyramid. According to vdrir an-
cient inscriptions, a peculiar kind of monument (an obelisk standing on a
truncated pyramid), dedicated to the sun, and bearing the name of Rash-
epuab, is said once to have stood near the pyramid of Ita-en-user. The
name of the largest pyramid (sides IOS, formerly 1901/2 yds. l perpendicular
height 105, formerly 229 ft.), situated a little to the b'.W., is unknown.
Perring (p. 351) found that all the chambers had been entered and plun-
dered. The other pyramids are mere heaps of ruins, and one ot'them (lo
the S.W. of the largest) seems never to have been completed.

Continuing our route to Salil.riira, we leave to the left a. pond and
the village of Alm.ste, situated beyond a group of palms to the S.E., and
soon reach the sandy eminences of the Necropolis of Memphis, at the be-
ginning of which the tomb of Ti is situated.

The Site of Ancient Memphis and the Necropolis of Sahhéra.

A visit to Memphis and t3alil.dttya. may easily be accomplished in one
day hy the aid of the railway, but t1/2-2 days may pmditably be devoted
to the excursiOn. There are, indeed, but few of' the tombs in the Neero-
polis of Sakiliiira which are accessible to the ordinary visitor, but the
interiors of these are so interesting, that many travellers will find them
worthy of careful and repeated inspection. A tent is not absolutely ne-
cessary for the expedition. The traveller may pass the night at Mariet-
te's house (p. 377), or on its covered terrace, or, if necessary, in one of the
numerous caverns in the neighbouring rocks. A blanket is a sufficient
covering in spring. Provisions should not Le forgotten, and liquors may,
if necessary, be procured at Bedmshén at the shop of a Greek 'bal.cl.ciil'
(0n the right, beyond the bridge). .

RAILWAY (Lt'gne de la IIaute-Egypte). The station of 2htld.k ed-Daketie
is situated on the left bank of the Nile, 3 M. from Cairo, a drive of
1/zhr. (5 fr.). The train, starting daily at 8.30 a. m., runs thence to Bed-
rashen (see below) in 1/2 hr. (fares 10 pins. 20 paras, 7 pias.-, fare for don-
key and attendant, 21/2 fin; see below). The inspection of the site of
Memphis, and the ride to 1rariette's House, occupy 2 hrs.; for luncheon
and a visit to the tombs 4 hrs. should be allowed, and for returning to
the station of Bedrashén 2 hrs. more. The train from Upper Egypt gener-
laly reaches Bedrashtn about 6. 30p.1n., so that the traveller should leave
Satl.ciira a little after 4 o'cloek. The hotel at Cairo will thus be regained
about 8 p.m. It is desirable to arrive in good time both at Pn"ihlk and
Bedrashtm, as the train, though generally late, occasionally starts before
its time.

Those who wish to spend a night at Sahhftm may return from Bed-
rashén to Cairo either on the second evening (as above), or at 10.45 ann.
by the special train from the Fayiim (see p. 456); or the traveller may
start at 3 pun. from Ihiliil:c ei1-Dakai1r fur Bedrashén by the Fay1lm train,
ride in the evening to Salilfiira, and thus have the whole cf the next day
at his disposal. It should, however, be remarked that the trains to and
from the Faythn start from Biiliil.c ed-Dakn1r at the time when the Nile
bridge at Gezireh is open for the passage of vessels (during 2 lll'S.t.
Crossing the river in a small boat is not recommended, owing to the
great confusion which prevails. - Donkeys with good saddles may now
be obtained in Bedrashén, so that it is no longer necessary to bring them
from Cairo. . A
