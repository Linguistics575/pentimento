112 H 1 EROGLYPIIICS.

Among these were the French savants MM. Ch. Lenormant,
Nestor t'Htste, and Emmanuel de Rouge’, the last of whom was the
lirst to translate with philologiea1 accuracy a hieroglyphic text of
any length, and the Italian scholars MM. Salvolini, Ungarelli, and
flosellini. The most distinguished English Egyptologists of the
same school are Messrs. Osburn and Hincks, and Dr. Birch, who
has compiled the first complete dictionary of the ancient language,
and has translated numerous inscriptions. The most celebrated
German Egyptologist is Prof. Richard Lepsius (d. 1881), the foun-
der of the critical method of prosecuting philologieal and historical
research. Thanks to the discoveries of these savauts and others of
the same school, the study of the subject has progressed so rapidly
that the time is probably not far distant when students will be
able to translate a hieroglyphic inscription with as great philologi-
eal accuracy as the work of a Greek or Latin author.

A glance at a single temple wall, or even at the annexed list
of the names of the Egyptian kings, will show the traveller that
we have not to deal here with an alphabetical mode ofwriting, the
signs (about 2000 in number) being far too numerous. The ancient
Egyptian writings were based 0n twodifrerent, but intimately eon-
neeted systems : CI) the Idcogruphic, which, by the use of well-known
objects as symbols of conceptions, sought to render its meaning in-
telligible to a certain class of the community; and (P) the Phonetic,
which represents words by symbols of their sounds. Although we
cannot now trace the rise and progress of hieroglyphic. writing, as
even the earliest specimens manifestly belong to an already I)er-
fected system, we may at least safely assert that the idengra-
phie element preceded the, phonetic; for, as a child employs
gestures earlier than speech, so nations use a symholieal form of
writing before they arrive at a method of expressing sounds. The
newer and more serviceable phonetic system must ultimately have
superseded the ideographie, although oeeasionally calling, in its
aid as an auxiliary. In the perfected system, therefore, the sym-
bols for sounds and syllables are to he regarded as the foundation
of the writing, while symbols for ideas are interspersed with them,
partly to render the meaning more intelligible, and partly for or-
namental purposes, or with a view to keep up the mystic character
of the hieroglyphies.

The Phonetic signs are divided into alphabetical letters, such as
Is a , J b, a q or.k,ts f, ete., and syllabie signs, such as

"Gi-ur, ”:9 M, li,, sch, 3% tfnklt, manor, etc. The

syllable signs may, in order to fix their sounds with greater preci-
sion, have as 'phonetic complements" one, several, or all of those
sounds which the name of the syllable representing the sign in
