is composed of limestone. Ina number ofhollows, to the right of the
colossal statue, we observe remains of foundations, the most im-
portant of which are 5 min. to the N.W., beyond the projecting
angle of the palm-grove, and due E. from the village of Mitrahineh.
M. Mariette supposed these to be the foundation of a temple of Ptah
(Vulcan). During the inundation the whole of the low ground is
under water, and then resembles a lake surrounded by palm-groves.

In 1851-54 Ilekekyan Bey. an Armenian, was employed by the, Lon-
don Geological Society to make excavations here; and having sunk shafts
at 96 different places, he found bones of domestic animals, fragments of
pottery and bricks, and various implements (ea. a, copper knife), at dif-
ferent depths. Near the colossal statue, beneath strata of Nile-mnd,
which had not been covered with sand from the desert, was discovered
a fragment of red terracotta, at a depth of 30 ft. It therefore appears,
that since the erection of the statue of Ramses. about the middle of the
14th cent. 13.0., the deposit of Nile-mud around it has attained a ihick-
ness of nearly 10 ft.. without reckoning a layer of sand Sin, in thickness.
The alluvial deposits at this spot must thus have increased at the rate
of 33/4in. in each century from the middle of the bith cent. 1:.C. down to
the present time. If the thickness of the deposit above the terracotta
fragment increased at the same rate, it would follow that the earthenware
vessels were manufactured on the banks of the Nile 11,646 years before
Christ. It need hardly be said, however, that this mode of computation
is very untrustworthy. And yet 'who would venture to deny that this
fragment of prttery, buried at a depth of 39 ft., may he at least 4000 years
older than the monument of the great Ilamses'? (Peschel.)

From sUttraUneh (Memphis) to Sa.kl.c(ira. Cr) Spring Route.
We ride towards the W. from the statue of Ramses, leaving the
village of Mitrahineh at a little distance to the right (see Maps,
pp. 372, 378). On quitting the palm-grove we obtain an interest-
ing view; immediately to the right, shaded by palm-trees and leh-
heks, is a small villa belonging to Tigran Bey, a nephew of Nubar
Pasha. About 1 M. to the w. is another long palm-grove surround-
ing Saliliira and bordering the desert; beyond this, on the yellow
sand of the desert, rise eleven pyramids. The first of these, to
the loft, is the outer mud-pyramid , beyond which are the
blunted pyramid, the first mud-pyramid, and the great pyramid,
all belonging to the group of Dahshtlr (p. 40?). Not far from these
we next perceive the Mastaha Fa1"iin, with the pyramid ofPepi ll;
then, exactly above the houses of Saliliiira, two pyramids, the lesser
ofwhieh is that ofPepi L; and, lastly, to the right, the pyramid of
Unas, the great step-pyramid, and two smaller ones tto the right, that
Of Tcti). These last eight pyramids belong to the group of 1ial.il.ihra.
- Having nearly reached (3/4 hr. from the statue of Ramses") Sali-
hara, we leave the village, which is uninteresting, to the left,
turn towards the N., and skirt the palm-groves. (At the end of
these, on the left, is a heautifn], shady sycamore, olose to a spring
of good water, and the tomb of a sh√©kh.') We now reach the mar--
gin of the desert, the route still leading towards the N., and ascend
to the plateau of the Neeropolis (p. 37?0.
