were imported from the island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean, and

the N. ofit is the Harem Building1 part of Which was erected by
Mohammed 'Ali (not shown). Pl. 5, a pleasant resting-place, a
'volipre' enclosed with interesting plants. Pl. 6, a fountain. In
the centre of the garden is the long ''kiosque, probably the finest
modern Arabian structure of the kind. The ornamentation, in east
iron, is in the Alhambra style. The plan of the building is slightly
irregular, as several apartments of an older kiosque have been in-
eorporated with it. The handsome hall and the fountain were
executed at the Lauchhammer foundry near Dresden ; they weighed
400 tons, and the cost of transport alone amounted to upwards of
2000t. ; the hall itself, exclusive of the expense of its erection and
decoration, cost 8000t. On the E. side of the kiosque are the reeep-
tion chambers, and 011 the w. side the private apartments of the
Khedive, consisting of an ante-chamber (Jn. f, g), a small (P1. i)
and a large dining-room (Pl. k), a smoking-room (PI. h), chambers

for reading, resting, and bathing, and a store-room for plate.

in their styles. Furniture French and English.

The Shubra Avenue.

About 21/2 M. to the N. of Cairo lies the village of Shubra, on
the Nile, where a spacious garden and kiosqne of Mohammad 'Ali,
110w neglected, are situated (permission to visit them obtained
through the consulate). The broad *Shubra Avenue leading thither
is composed of beautiful sycamores and lebhek trees [erroneously
called Nile aeaeias; p. 76). This avenue forms the Rotten How, or
Avenue de Boulogne, of Cairo. The fashionables of the town, both
Mohammedan andChristian, drive or ride here daily, but principally
on Friday and Sunday evenings. The scene resembles the 'eorso'
of European cities, but is rendered far more picturesque by its
Oriental elements. The carriages of the slightly veiled ladies from
the harems of the wealthy, and those of the ministers, the consuls
and the, merchants, follow each othorin gay procession, while the
nhiqnitous (lonhe) forms a conspicuous feature in the busy throng.
