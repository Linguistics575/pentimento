siderable, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface eon-
sisting of large slabs. Descending again, and looking into the halls, we may
observe the whole series borne by twenty-seven monolithic, columns. The
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb, consist-
ing of a square, pyramid, each side of which is four plethra (1100 ft.) in
length, and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried here, is called
Ismandes. It is also asserted that so many palaees were built, because it
was the custom for all the nomes, represented by their magnates, with
their priests and victims, to assemble here to offer saeritice and gifts to the
gods, and to deliberate on the most important concerns. Each nome
then took possession of the hall destined for it. Sailing about a hundred
stadia beyond this point, we next reach the town of Arsinois", etc. This
description of Strabo is eontirmed by the contents of two papyri, one of
which is in the museum of Gizeh, the other in private possession (Mr.
Hood). The deities of 66 districts are enumerated here, 24 of whom be-
long to Upper Egypt, 20 to Lower Egypt, and 22 to the Faytim.

It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings
of Nile bricks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as
tombs. Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the splen-
dour of the old 'wonder of the world'. Except some blocks of lime-
stone, nothing remains of the extensive structures once erected

here, save the pyramid 'at the end of the labyrinth'.

To the N. of the pyramid Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered some mummy
toffhrs with carefully painted heads (now in London). Of still greater
value are the portraits found at el-Rubaydt, 13 M. to the N.E. of 3Ie..

Lake Moeris. The object of Lake Mueris, which has long since been
dried up, was to receive the superfluous water in the ease of too high
an inundation, and to distribute its contents over the fields when the
overflow was insrafflcient. Strabo describes Lake Moeris in the follow-
ing terms: 'Owing to its size and depth it is capable of receiving the
superabnndanee of water during the inundation, without overflowing the
habitations and crops; but later, when the water subsides, and after the
lake has given up its excess through one of its two mouths, both it and
the canal retain water enough for purposes of irrigation. This is accom-
plished by natural means, but at both ends of the canal there are also
loek-gates, by means of which the engineers can regulate the influx
and effl11x of the water.' The lock-gate, which in ancient times ad-
mitted the water conducted from the Nile by the canal into the lake,
was probably situated near the modern et-Laluin (see below), the name of
which is supposed to be derived from the old Egyptian U?o-httn' or 'Io-
hem”, tie. 'the mouth of the lake', and the site of Which was probably
once occupied by the town of Ptolemais.

here is a difference of opinion as to the Situation and Form of the
Ancient Lake. Linant-Bey, arguing from the considerable dilTerenee of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket e1lur0n (Lake
of the Horns, p. 465) could never have formed part of Lake eris, as was
formerly supposed, and he assigns to the latter a much smaller area than
Was attributed to it under the earlier theory. Placing it farther to the
S.E., nearer to the Labyrinth and el-Lahiin, he makes its boundary-line
run towards the S.S.W. of Medinet el-Fayiim to the Birket el-G/tara?:, and
intersect the desert of Shékh Ahmed, where the ancient height of the wa-
ter, which far exceeds the level attained in modern times, has left its
traces; it then leads to Kalamsha, turns to the N. to Dir, and then to
the E. and SE. to Dimt'sh.tirseh, follows the embankment of PillauuMeh,
and passes Hawtiret el-Kebirand the bridge of el-than (see below). Hence the
boundary leads by Oiinmo towards the ICE. to Selah, and thence to the W.
fo Bihamu fp. Mor, then again to the s., and thus returns to Medinet el-
Fa.siun.--A smnewhat fatiguing journey of 2-3 days will enable the trav-
