11 day for each person, according to the requirements of iiise' employers,
and for that sum he is hound to provide them With a tent, provisions
(wine excepted), and donkeys, or other means of conveyance, and to
pay railway fares and all other expeuses.A written contract (comp.
p. 471), specifying the places to he visited, the points where some stay is to
he made (on which occasions tt reduced charge per day should he stipulated
for), and other particulars. should be drawn up before starting. Those
who intend to visit Nedinet el-Fayt1m and its immediate environs only,
and who do not object to rough quarters for one or two nights, may
dispense with a dragoman and a tent, hut should he provided with a
moderate supply of food. An introduction to the mudir will be of great
service in enabling the traveller to procure the necessary horses OT? donkeys,
which the inhabitants are often unwilling to hire (comp. p. 453).

Since the completion of the railway this excursion has usually been
undertaken from Cairo, hot it may also he combined with a visit to
Sal.cl.cirah. It was formerly usual to 'visit the Faytim in connection with
11. journey up the Nile, but this plan entails needless expense, as the boat
and its crew have to be paid for while lying idle for sevei'a] days.1t'
however, the iraveller prefers this plan, he disembarks at Wasta and sends
1111 his dhahabtyeh toBeniSutf,whie11 he afterwards reaches by railway.

SITUATION AND Htsrom' OF THE FAYI‘JM. In the great plateau of the
Libyan Desert, which rises 300U00 ft. above the sea-level, is situated the
province of the FAYEIM (from the ancient Egyptian ‘Phium', i.e. marsh
01' lake district). the first of the oases. which is usually considered to
belong to the valley of the Nile, and is justly eelehraied for its extra-
ordinary fertility (see below). This tract is in the form of an oval basin,
8-10 sq. M. in area, and supports a population of 200.000 sonls; it is enclosed
by the Libyan hills, Which are here of moderate height, and lies about
three-ilfths of a degree to the S. of Cairo. 1t enjoys a remarkably fine
climate, and has but rarely been visited by the plague. This 'land of
roses' is still one of the most beautiful parts of Egypt, and more than
any other part of the Nile valley deserves the well known epithet of Uhe
gift, of the Nile', bestowed 1111 Egypt by Herodotus. 11s it is entirely indebted
for its fertility to the waters of the Nile with which it is artifieiallyi irri-
gateil. The Bahr Izlsuf. a channel 207 M. in length,whichis more probably
