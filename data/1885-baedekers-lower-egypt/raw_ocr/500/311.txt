from the terraces of the gates. The casemates and towers still bear
French names out in the bastion walls. On payment ofa small
balishish, the visitor may ascend the Bib en-Nasir and the city-
wall, and walk along the top of the latter to the Bib el-Flotilla.
These gates, the most important of the sixty which once existed
in the walls of Cairo, were erected by the vizier Berd Gamali in
the 11th century. The Bib en-Nasr in particular is built of well-
hewn stone, and has vaulted winding staircases in the interior,
groined vaulting in the gateway, girders with a kind of hatched
moulding, and eorniees with a eorbeled frieze. Over the entrance
are a slab with a olde inscription, and decorative shields. The
principal entrance of the Bit el-1i'uttO is flanked with sernieir-.
cular towers, and that of the Bib en-Nasr with square towers. The
spaces between the inner and outer gates are vaulted.

We leave the Bhb en-Naer and turn to the right, crossing a

eminence not far from the road, is interred J. L. Burclchardt
(d. 1817), the distinguished Oriental traveller, whose works are
still of high authority.

Before leaving the eity-wall to the right, we observe on the
left two towers with iron basins, being the reservoirs of the Water-
works supplying the palace of the Khedive in the 'Abbistyeh and
the Citadel. In front of these, but less visible, are the five large
filters for purifying the town supply.

The water is pumped into these filters by engines of 150-horse power,
situated in the Isma'iliya quarter, on the canal of that name. A smaller
pump adjoining the f1Iters is used for providing the Citadel with water. The
lirst temporary pumping machinery, erected in 1865-66, at Kaer el-'Ain,
was employed in filling the basins in the desert, and also in supplying a
small part of the city. The distribution of water is now effected by a.
double system of pipes, through one set of which the filtered water is
forced to a height of about 80 ft., while the other brings unfiltered water
from the neighbourhood of B13131; for the purpose of watering the streets
and the gardens, conducting it to a height of about 30 ft. only. The
engines in the Isma‘iliya. quarter are capable of supplying the tnwn
with 30,000 cubic metres, or about 111,000 cubic feet, of water per day.
The government pays 40 centimes for each cubic metre of filtered water
