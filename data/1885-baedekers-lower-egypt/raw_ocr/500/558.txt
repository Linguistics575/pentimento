emerald, which is frequently mentioned by ancient authors was a green
paste coloured with copper, which, when ground, yielded the best green
paint. This raw material was used by the Egyptians for colouring glass,
of which many pieces are preserved, and was probably the malachite which
is called by Theophrastus 'false emerald', or copper green; and Which,
being much used for soldering gold, was named 'c1irysoeo11a'. - The in-

lazuli sometimes occurs interspersed with malachite, and sometimes in
small nodules by itself. In the Mriidi Maghiira copper was formerly
worked, and along, with it was doubtless found malachite, which was
either used as a precious stone, OI' manufactured into paint. The district

work in the porphyry quarries, SO in the reign of Ramses II. tho
refractory Israelites were employed in the mines.
