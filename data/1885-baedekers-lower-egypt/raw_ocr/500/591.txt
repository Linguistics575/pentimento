to Suez. WADI LEBWEH. 10. Route. 521

To the W. of the tomb a hill, bearing a few ruins, rises from
the valley. We next pass (1/4 hr.) the entrance to the Wadi (hgtvilrtyeh
on the right, which is traversed by the route to 'Aliaba o. 518).
Opposite us, to the left, are several small towers, above which rises
the pointed Jebel Fert. The valley contracts, but after 1/3 hr. ex-
pands into a wide basin, bounded on the N. hy a chain of preei-
pitous rocky slopes. Beyond this basin C4() min.), and beyond the
mouth of the W/idi Shi'b, on the loft, the route traverses CIO min.)
the El-Watiyeh Pass (4022 ft.), enclosed by imposing masses of
granite. Immediately beyond it rises a stone, resembling an altar,
with a white summit, which the Beduins point out as the scene of
Abraham's saerifiee. A rock near it, in the form of a chair, is,
called the Malc’ad Nebi Mitsa, or seat of the prophet Moses, which
he is said to have occupied while tending the sheep of his father-
in-law Jethro (p. 502).

At this point begins the lower part of the Esh-Shékh valley.
The character of the region becomes less mountainous, and the
route enters an undulating district. In less than an hour we reach
a luxuriant growth of tarfa shrubs, which extends for a distance of
about 11/; M. (couip. p. 500). Beyond these shrubs, on the left,
opens the Wadi I.fa.sah, which leads to the S. to the Nahb el-Héwi
(p. 501), and contains a number of palm-tmes. Near the (11/4 hr.)
Wtidi JIaghiir/it, which lies to the right, is the valley of Esh-Shékh,
which, according to Prof. Palmer's measurements, lies 3506 ft. above
the sea-level. The imposing mass of Mt. Serbil now becomes
visible. Near the Cl hr.) Wadi el- Terr (right) are a few inscriptions
(p. /19O. The next valley 011 the right is the (35 min.) Wadi Soléf;
and opposite to it opens the broad Wddi Sahab, through which
the Nalib el-Wwi (p. 501) may be reached in 5 hrs. At this point
(2850 ft.) our route quits the Wadi Esh-Shékh, which leads to the
(/23/4 hrs.) defile of El-Buwéb (p. 501) farther S. We ascend
rapidly to the N.W. in the western part of the W/hh' Soléf, which
soon contracts to a gorge. Several valleys are now crossed, parti-
cularly the Wadi el-Akhdur and the dei el-‘Ishsh, as well as the
low ranges of hills which separate them; and in [3/4 hr. we reach
the long Wédi Berklr, lying at the base of the Jebel of the same
name. We now ascend this valley, obtaining at first a fine retrospect
of the Sinai group, the Jebel suiisa, and the Katheriu, and reach the
top of the pass at the base of the pyramidal hill of Zibb el-Bal/tr
Alht Bahariyeh (3895 ft.). We next enter the broad Wédi Lebweh,
through which the route, now monotonous and nearly straight,
descends in less than 2hrs. to the foot of the Nahb Wtsdi Barak.
The Wadi Lebweh, which makes a bend here and descends to the
Wtdi Firén, now takes the name of Wtdi el-‘Alpir. Our route
ascends in 1/2 hr. to the top of the Natl, Wiidi Barak Pass, beyond
which begins the thi Barak, a wild, stone-besprinkled valley,
sometimes contracting to a gorge, and overgrown with remarkably
