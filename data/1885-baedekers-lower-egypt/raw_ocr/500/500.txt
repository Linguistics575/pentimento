which consists of three sheltered basins in which vessels discharge
and load. The first of these, beginning on the N. side, is the basin
of the commercial harbour, the second is that of the quays, and the
third the Tassin Chetrif'. The last is flanked with handsome build-
ings, which were erected by Prince Henry of the Netherlands as a
dep6t for facilitating the Dutch gooi1s and passenger traffie between
Europe and the colonies of Holland; on his death, however, which
happened in 1882, they were purchased by the English government,
and they are now used a military dep6t and barracks.

8. Towns of the Central and Northern Delta,

A tour in the inland and r orthern districts of the Delta, including a
visit to the towns of Bransylra, Damietta, and Rosetta, and the exploration
of some of the ruins of towns near the embouchures of the Nile, is at-
tended with considerable diffieulty and discomfort, with Which the at-
tractions are by no means commensurate. A week at least is required
for the excursion, unless the traveller confine himself to places lying
close to the railway.

Those who are unacquainted with the language, and propose tn pene-
irate into the interior of the country, should be provided with a dragnman
111- a servant fp. 13), a tent, and a cook, as there are no tolerable hotels
except at Tanta, Damietta, and Itosetia.Introduetions should be oh-
tained through the consulate at Cairo to the consular agents at Mansura,
Rosetta, 1111115 Damietta, and to the shekh of the fisheries at Tanis.

As wet weather and cold nights are not uncommon in the Delta in
winter, the traveller should be well provided with warm clothing and
rugs. A moderate supply of provisions and wine will also be found useful.

DISPOSITION OF T111111. The railway traffle in the Delia has much in-
creased oflate, so that the following tours can now be accomplished
with much less loss of time than fyryerly. The hours of starting and
the fares are so often changed,that it is useless to give them here,

Ist Day: From Cairo to Mansy'tra. --2nd Day: At Mensum- excursion
to Bohhit el- 1lager; and start from Talkha, opposite o7/iiiiiiil,' for Da..

mietta. -. 3rd 'i5'iyiifieiro"ii' at "frifiiiTiii.,' in the afternoon, by train
(i. 45 p. m. ) to Tania. - 4th Day:From Tanta to Rosette. - 51h Day: From
?vosutta to Ahixai1dria.- A visit to T111113 takes two days more, and to

Sais also two days.
The tour may also be made in the reverse direction, and some trav-
ellers will find it convenient to proceed from Tanis direct to Port Sa'id.
The journey itself presents little attraction. The chief characteristics
of the monotonous scenery are extensive and often remarkably fertile
fields, canals, and dirty villages surrounded by palm-trees.
