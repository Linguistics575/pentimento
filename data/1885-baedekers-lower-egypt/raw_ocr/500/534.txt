IO, The Peninsula of Sinai.

The journey to Mount Sinai is perhaps the most interesting ofOriew.
tal expeditions, particularly to the student of the Biblef, as he will tra..
verse nearly the same route as that of the Israelites described in the
Bible (p. d81j. The peninsula of Mt. Sinai owes its imperishable fame
to the vicissitudes undergone by these wanderers under the leadership
of their great lawgiver; but the scenery is also so varied that it will
amply repay the traveller for al) the privations of his journey, which,
after all, are not more serious than those of a tour through the interior
of Palestine. The usual duration of the Mt. Sinai expedition is 17-20
days (comp., however, P. 475).

The best SEASON for the journey is between the middle of February
and the end of April, and between the beginning of October and the
middle of November. During the months of November, December, and
January, the nights are generally very cold, while in summer the glare
of the sun, reflected from the granite reeks of the Sinai mountains, is
very oppressive. Even at the end of May the weather is hot, and the
Khumsin (p. 69) prevalent (setting in sometimes as early as April], but
at this advanced season the traveller will have the advantage of seeing
the manna (p. 500), or fruit of the tarfa shrub, in its ripe condition.

T2wara Beduins (p. 478).. who act as guides and Jet camels during the
travelling season. The hrst thing is to engage a good dragmnan (p. 13),
who provides camels, tents, bedding, blankets, and provisions. All these
should be examined at Cairo, and the tents pitched by way of experi-
ment. The more carefully this inspection is made, and any defects

, Although it is not the object of the handbook to enter upon the
province of Biblical criticism. the views of the principal explorers are
lrriefty given in connection with the different places. As the great charm
of a jnurney thruugh the Peninsula consists in its associations with the
iiihliea] aceont of the Exodus nf the Israelites, and the prcmmlgutiun of
the law ip. 181), the traveller should of course be provided with a enpy
ut' the wimie Sacred Volume, Ot' at least with the books of Exodus and
Numbers.
