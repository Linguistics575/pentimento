speetion of the great neoropolis. Those who are not fatigued may
now walk towards the Citadel (p. 262), examining the different
lu5shes, domes, and smaller monuments on the right and left, and
may then visit the Tombs of the Mamelukes (p. 3270 beyond the
Citadel. The embankment of the new railway which runs between
the Tombs of the Khalifs and the quarries of the Mokattam, affords
a good survey of the scene. The traveller who quits the Tombs
about sunset should not omit to ascend the Windmill Hill from the
side next the town (comp. Plan, p. 282), for the sake of the view.
A fine effect, especially by evening light, is produced by the domes
and the peculiar colouring of the valley and the opposite heights
of the Motat..tam. This mound of rubbish should indeed be fre-
quently visited (comp. p. 282). To the W. are the city, the plain
of theNiIe, and the Pyramids. The red building to the N.E. is the
'Abbistyelt (p. 332), to the left of Which is a rnost1ueCGirni' el-
'Adif). In front of the latter is the N.E. group of the Tombs of the
Khalifs o. 2820, a little to the right of Which are the two minarets
of Suitytn Barlitilr (p. 282). Beyond these rises the Gebel el-Alunar
(p. 337j, adjoining Which are the Mokattam hills, with the other
Tombs of the Khalifs at their base.

Mosques of' El-Azhar and Hasanén.

The G&mi’ el-Azhar (Pl. 38; G, 2) presents few features of ar-
ohiteotural interest, and is so shut in by houses that very little of
the exterior is visible. The plan of the principal part was originally
the same as that of the 'Amr Mosque (p. 324), but the numemus
additions made at various periods have somewhat moditied its form,
and since the conversion of the mosque into a university the aisles
have been separated from the court by walls and railings. The first
great alterations took place in the year 1004 of the Hegira, in the
reign of Mohammed ibn Murad, the next were made by Shékh Is-
mam Bey in 1131 of the Hegira, and the last by Sartil Pasha about
1848, all exhibiting the decline of Arabian architecture.

The Minarets (Pl. 12j, some of which are brightly painted,
were erected at different periods, one of them having been built
by 'Abder Rahmén Kikhya (p. 279).

The mosque has six gates: the Bail; el-Jlusteyinin (P1. i), or
Gate of the Barbers [see below), on the W. side,, forming the prim-
cipal entrance, and possessing an interesting portal; the Btb Go-
hartyeli (P1. b), on the N. side; the Bith esh-Shurba (P1. (3), or Soup
Gate, 011 the E.; the Btd, eyqitd'tyeh, or Gate of the Upper Egyp-
tians; the Btrb esh-Shawwam (P1. i), or Syrian Gate; and the IMI)
el-uayMrhtW(Pl. o, or Gate of the W. Africans, the three last
being on the S. side.

The mosque was converted into a University (now the most
important in Mohammedan territory) by lihalif 'Aziz Billid1 (A.D.
975-96), at the suggestion of his vizier Abu'] Farag Yilctsb, in
