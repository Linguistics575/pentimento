Treydin.sgly'.,.r? a later passage the sacred record mentions the cities in
Gushen in which the Israelites were compelled to work at the tasks im-
pulsed on them by Pharaeh.Exud11s i. 11: --'Therefore they did set
over them taskmasters to afflict them with -atir. burdens. And they
built tlu, Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithnm and Ilaamses'. Lastly, the first
ean1p'1.11e-p1Tes of the retreating Israelites are enumer ated in Numbers
xxxiii. 5. et seq.: - (t) Ramses, (2) Succoth, (3) Etham and (4) Pi- ha-
hiroth, 'whieh is before Baal- -zeph0n: and they pitched before Nigdol'.
Leaving Pi-hahiroth, they then 'passed through the midst of the sea into
the wilderness'.

We thus find that the Bible mentions a considerable number of pla-
ces belonging to Goshen, and as the sites of several of these have been
identified with the aid of the Egyptian monuments, we are enabled ap-
proximately to determine the boundaries of the district, within which
also lay Tell el- Yehiidiyeh fp. 408), Belbés (p. 409), and Bubastis (p. MO).
That Geshen lay to the E. of the Delta there can be no doubt, as it was
situated between the residence of the Pharaohs and Palestine, and the
Scriptures make no mention of the Nile having been crossed. This pro-
vince was afterwards called the Nomos Arabia, or Arabian meme, and
the ancient Egyptian Gosem is spoken of as one of the E. districts of
the empire. The name still survives in that of the town called K123 by
the Copes, and Fat0s by the Arabs (the ancient I’Imcusa; comp p. 451).

The southernmost point of the triangle formed by the land Pit, Goshen
was probably Heliopolis (Matariyeh), whence the district seems to have
extended in a narrow strip as far as BeleS. The S. boundary 1-1111 thence,
in the latitude of the present Th esh- Water Canal, as far as Lake Tim-.

s'ttlo.on the W. the district was probably bounded by the Tauitie arm
of the Nile, on the N. by Lake Menzaleh, and on the E. by a branch of
the sa111e,as well as by the Balah and Timsiil.o lakes, which in an-
cient times were connected by aline of nyrtiiieatiims, and formed a kind
of moat behind the bastions erected for the purpose of warding " the
attacks of the warlike tribes of IV. Arabia. To the S. of the district of
Goshen extended a desert tract intersected by ranges of hills, ramifying
from the hills which bound the Arabian bank of the Nile. These hills
generally run from w. to E. and attain their greatest height in the
'Atalra Nts., which command the N. w. shore of the Gulf of Suez. It is
probable that the Jews, who settled in Goshen as shepherds, and after-
wards appear as inhabitants of the towns in that region, were compelled
to assist in the cultivation of the soil, which seems to have attained a
high state of perfection at that period. Several records Written on pa-
pyrus by Egyptian offieials about that epoch are still preserved. They
describe the charms of the country in the most vivid colours, stating
that life there was 'sweet', and that the soil yielded all kinds of Crops
in abundance. ln a papyrus preserved at Leyden the writer, Keniamen,
writes the following report to his superior Hui, an important official
Under the Pharaoh of the oppression (Ramses 11.): - 'Therefore Iheard
the message of the eye (an oftieial title) of my master, saying: Give corn
in the Egyptian soldiers, and to the Hebrews who polish stones for the
construction of the great store-houses (hekhennu) in the city of Ramses‘,
etc. - The Israelites were doubtless also employed in the construction
(it the new canals which converted the sterile land into a smiling agri-
cultural tract, affording abundant subsistence both tn 1111111 and beast, so
that it is not surprising that the emigrants fondly remembered the 'flesh-
puts of Egypt'.Pithom, where the Israelites made bricks, probably lay,
as mentioned below, near Amt ,SulémtU, which is situated to the S. of
the railway between Zalgazik and Tell 'ii-yd/iii',' and near whieh there is
a small lake.Farther, 011, near the rnin- -eovered hill of Itigdbeh, me

several muddy ponds, which contain a considerable volume of water dur-
ing the inundation, and are probably identical with the 'Barlcabata'
('1‘2‘73} OI? pends of Pithom, mentioned in a 111111311115 of Anastasi VI. f
