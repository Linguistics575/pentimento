struction of the canal (Khalig), which, leaving the Nile opposite the hr,.
land of Reda, intersects the town, and is supposed to have been intended
to connect the Nile With the Red Sea. The city was considerably ex-
tended in the reign of the splendour-loving Ahmed ibn Tulan, the founder
uf the dynasty of the Tulunides, who erected the new quarter of El-
Ehatiya, to the S.W. of the )resent citadel. Among the buildings ascribed
to him is the mosque (p. 2() J which still bears his name. The town of
Fost.iit was favoured by his successors also, and particularly by his son
Kharnarilyeh, who erected at palace here; and at length, under the
fTtt.imite Eharifs (p. 102), the modern city of Cairo was built adjacent to
the old. The new city was founded by J6har, the general of the Ffttimite
Khalit‘ Mu'ire, to the N. of El-lihatiyzt, as a residence for the khalit', and
as barracks for the soldiers commanded by him. At the hour when the
foundation of the walls was laid, the planet Mars, which the Arabs call
Fiihir,or 'the vietorious', crossed the meridian of the new city; and
3rueizz accordingly named the place May' el-Ifdhira, or thira. 3layr, the
name of Egypt or of its capital, seems also already to have been applied
to Fos.tii.t, which, to distinguish it from Maer el-Wrhira, was now called
May el-'Ati?a (the present Old Cairo). The new town extended rapidly.
Bricks were easily made of the Nile mud, the Nohattam hills atrorded
excellent stone, while the gigantic ruins of the ancient Memphis on
the opposite bank of the river were also used as a quarry, as the
foundations of the houses still show. In 973 the new city of Cairo was
constituted the capital of Egypt, and for many centuries after that period
the destinies of the country were determined here. In 1166 the citadel
which still commands the city was erected by 'nhiloei1dtr) (Saladiu) on the
slope of the 3loliai,.tam hills; and the same sultan caused the whole town,
together with the citadel itself, to be enclosed by a wall, 29,0U0 ells in
length. Under. his luxurious and extravagant successors Cairo was greatly
extended and magrtifieenily embellished. According to the Arabian his-
torians, the most enterprising of these sultans was Nohammed en-Ntlsjir
N. 1341), who constructed numerous handsome edifices both within and
without the citadel, as well as canals and roads, thus converting the ruins
and sand-hills in the environs into beautiful Suburbs, with palaces and
pleasure-grounds. At that period, however, Cairo was fearfully devastated
by the plague, as it had been on two former occasions fin 1067 and 1200),
and was also several times subsequently; and, according to Mahrizi, no
fewer than 900,0000) persons died in Old and New Cairo between Novem-
ber, 1318, and January, 13'19. The town suffered severely in other ways
also, and indeed its whole history, so far as recorded, like that of the
sultans and the Mamelukes themselves, seems io have presented an
almost continuous suceession of revolutions, rapine, and bloodshed, As
must of the Mameluke Sultans who resided in the citadel died a violent
death, so the reign of almost every new putentate began with hitter and
sanguinnry contests among the emirs for the office of vizier, while but
few reigns were undisturbed by insurrections in the capital. During the
third regime of Mohammed en-Nagtr, who had been twice deposed, and
as often recovered his ihrone, a persecution of the Christians took place
at Cairo. The Christians, of whom great numbers resided in Cairo and
throughout the whole of Egypt, were accused by the people of incen-
Jiarism. Their churches were accordingly closed or demolished, while
they themselves were so ill-treated and oppressed, especially in the reign
of Sultan Sale]; (1351-51), that many of them are said to have embraCcd
Islamism. In 1366 and 1367, in the reign of Snltfm Sha‘bcin, sanguinary
c,rmflietg took place in the streets of Cairo between hostile parties of
Mamelukes, and in 1377 Shaqriin himself was tortured and strangled in
the cittuhl. Even greater disorders attended the dethronement of Sultfm
Btwk:iu.c (i380), when the wildest anarchy prevailed at Cairo, the convicts
esmpud from their prisons, and in concert with the populace plundered
the Imneun of the emirs and the public magazines. The following year
a rnhc-Ihon again hruke nut among the Mamelukes, who stormed the
citadel, m ennsequence of which P,avktik regained possession of the
thrnue, and celebrated his trinmpha] ontlzy into Cairn. Searcely, however,
