5. From Cairo to Suez.

No special prepara)iops need be made for this journey, and a drago-
man is supertluous. At Suez, Isma' iliya, and Port Sarid there are good
hotels in the European style, where local guides may be engaged furb the
environs. These towns present little attraction beyond their situation;
but the harbours, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal will interest most
travellers. The excursion may conveniently he made on the way home,
as most of the steamers Which ply between Alexandria and the European
ports touch at Port Sa‘id, besides which it has direct communication with
Naples, Marseilles, and Trieste through the Australian and Chinese mail
steamers.

railway from Cairo to Suez, traversing the desert, but the line had to be
abandoned, partly on account of the want of water. and partly owing to
the difficulty in keeping it clear of sand (e11111p.111ap of Lower Egypt).

About 1"2111 the S.E. of tihibin el-riani.tir is the, ruined site of
Tell el.. 'l/S/ii/h, (11111 of the Jews). (Jn this spot (111111, the high priest
of the, Jews, Still of Onia IH., aided by Ptolemy Philorneior, erected a
temple fur his countrymen who had been expelled from Palestine by the
Syrian party and had met with a hospitable reception in Egypt. To the
1111jectinn that no true temple could exist anywhere but in Jerusalem he
answered in the wnrds of Isaiah (xix. 11“, el seg.): - 'In that day shall
tive rities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear
tit the Lord ofhosis; one shall be called the city of destruction (or, tut-
curdinlr to others, ‘eity of delfveraneejln that day shall there he an
altar tn the Lord in the midst of the land at Egypt, and a pillar at the
border thereof to the Lard'. Some critics have supposed that these and
the following verses were interpolated for the purpose of justifying the,
erectiun nt a temple un the bank of the Nile. At all events Onia elytw,ted
his purpuse and erected the sacred edifice. The temple is said to have

excavations made here have led to the diseovery that a town stood 1111 the
