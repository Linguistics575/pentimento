I dei' Mohammad 'Ali. CAIRO. 3. Route. 263

*Gtunir Mohammed 'Ali CPI. 5,T), the 'Alabaster Mosque', whose
lofty and graceful minarets are so conspicuous from a distance as
to form one of the landmarks of Cairo. The building was be-
gun by Mohammed 'Ali, the founder of the present Egyptian dy-
nasty, on the site of a palace Which was blown up in 182-1; and
in 1857 it was partly
completed in its present . ,
form by Sa'id Pasha (p. , l “a _

107). In plan it 16- .
sembles the Turkish

mosques built on the (
model of the Hagia Sofia I
at Constantinople. The "t

execution of the design
displays but little ar-.
tistic taste, and the
treatment of the ma-
terial is somewhat 11n- . . _
satisfactory. The ala- " 's, ,1 s 8 l / .
baster used for the in- .. '. 4 , _ "
crustation of the ma-
sonry consists partly of
blocks, and partly of
slabs, and was obtained
from the quarries near
Beni Suéf, which were
known in ancient times,
but had long been dis-
used and forgotten. The
beautiful yellow tint
of the stone soon fades
when exposed to the
sun. The alabaster in-
crustation of the S. fa-
fade, is, however, new
and fresh. 1. Entrance. 2. Kursi. 3. Mambar. (i. Kibla.

The interior, consisting

of a large quadrangle, with domes resting on /t huge pillars, pre-
sents an imposing appearance; and the ceiling is effectively painted.
The Kursi, Member, and fiibla possess no particular attraction.

closed by a handsome railing (P1. (O, opposite to Which is a space
