336 Route J. MOliATTAM. Environs ,

The **VIBW from this point, especially with its sunset colour-
ing, is magniiieent. The thousand minarets of the city and the
picturesque buildings of the Citadel are then tinted with a delicate
rosy hue. The grandest of all the burial-grounds of the desert forms
a noble foreground, the venerable Nile dotted with its lateen sails
tlows below us in its quiet majesty, and to the W., 011 the borders
of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous old Pyr-
amids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. At our feet are
the Citadel with the mosque of Mohammed 'Ali, the old aqueduct
011 theleft, andthe domes of Irnirn Sheife'i (p. 327). On a rocky emin-
ence are situated the picturesque ruins of several burial-mosques,
which, being of the same colour as the rock, are apt to escape the
notice of travellers 011 the Nile or its banks.

The Nohattam and the adjacent hills which tlank the valley 01' the
Nile, belong to the great range of the nummulite mouniaius which ex-
tend from ACTH. Africa, across Egypt and India, to China. This num-
mulite formation is one of the Eocene, m- oldest deposits of the tertiary
period, and immediately follows the chalk. It is remarkably rich in
fossils. the chief mass of which consists of millions of nummulites ia kind
of snail-shell), or large rhizopodes of the polyiltalautiea group. The lar-
ger kinds are about one inch in diameter, and the smaller about 1/s inch.
On removing the outer coating of limestone, we lind the well-defined
chambers within. They are also frequently seen, cut into two halves, in
the stones of the Pyramids, which are to a great extent constructed of
nummulite limestone. The Greeks also noticed these curious fossils, and
llerndotus mentions the smallest kinds as being petrified lentils, of the
sort eaten by the ancient Egyptians (comp. 3-18).

The numerous quarries in the slopes of the Mohattzun and the higher
side-valleys of the range also yield a profusion of sen-urehins (elypeaster,
cidavis, eehinnlampas, elm), various kinds of oysters, ecrithium, ovula,
stromlms. nerina, furritella, nautilus, bivalves, 'sharks' teeth, and bones
of the halieore. Beautiful crystals of isinglass-sbme, and of strontium also
oeeur, the, shells of the nummulites having frequently been crystallised
into the latter mineral.

At the N. end of the plateau is an old Turkish fort, whence a
bridge descends to the. litadel, but travellers are not permitted to
use this route. On the E. and higher part of the Mohattam, to the
right, adjoining the summit, is a llagstaif erected in 1874 by the
English party of seiemtifie men who observed the transit of Venus
from this point. The S. (right) end of these hills is skirted by the
road to the smaller Petrified Forest, which may be reached from
this point in about 3/4 hour.

On the way back our route bears a little to the right, and
away from the lofty perpendicular sides of the ahove-mentioned
quarry. The route bank to the town vid the Citadel turns to the
left after 1/4 hr., near some ancient tomb-eaverns, crosses a new
bridge, and enters the Citadel by the B611; et-Gebet, passing a
number of dirty canteens. Turning immediately to the left, we
pass the Well of Joseph (p. 2b4) on the left, and reach the broad
road leading to the city.
