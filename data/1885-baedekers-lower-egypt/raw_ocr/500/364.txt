of burnt bricks, and evidently belongs to different periods, the
oldest part being near the entrance, in the S. facade of the court.
The arches are of very various forms, some of them being almost
circular, while others, particularly those in the apertures of the
wall, form anearly acute angle with straight sides. Horseshoe arches
also occur, and others are constructed in arbitrary and fantastic
shapes. The capitals display a great variety of Roman and Byzantine
forms, and some of them, not quite completed, in the ruined N.
eolonnade, were perhaps Arabian imitations of Ptolemaie models.
The baths and other buildings once connected with the mosque are
no longer traceable.

The colonnades 011 the W. side (that of the entrance) are now
supported by one row of columns only. 0f the double columns that
once stood here one Pair of Columns 0'l. l'Y) alone remains. They
are plaoerl very close together, and it is said that none but honest
men could squeeze themselves between them; but the Khedive
has abolished this test of character by walling up the interstiee.--In
1808 this mosque, which has long been almost disused, witnessed a
very remarkable scene. At the usual period of the rise of the Nile,
the water beg f.tan to fall. Dismayed by this strange phenomenon, the
whole of' theD Mohammedan priesthood, the Christian clergy of every
sect, and the Jewish rabbis, with one accord, assembled in the
mosque of 'Amr to pray for the rise of the water, and s0 effectual
were their prayers that the river ere long rose to its wonted ferti-
lising height. [Fee to the attendant 1/2-dfr/)

The ira1eiler who does not intend ascending the Nile will find it not
uninteresting, on quitting, the _mosque, to visit one of the ahove- mentioned
Jittlleh Jfanv.factovies, and to inspect its primitive apparatus tlsalpshish,
d few Copper piastrei).

The porous water-jars (Arabic Jiulleh) used throughout the whole of
Egypt are chietly manufactured at Keneh in Upper Egypt of light grey
clay of very equal consistency. The remarkably uniform and delicate
porosity of the vessels is produced by mixing the clay with ashes, which,
the first time the vessel is used, are partly w ashed away by the w ater. The
rapid evaporation caused by the porosity of the lgulleh cools the liquid
within to a temporatuve of 1214:" lower than that of the surrounding air.
- These vessels, including the baldaeh, 111 large jars wtthhanilles,ehiefly
manufactured at Baltiz in Upper Il gypt, are brought down from Upper
Egypts in rafts, consisting of thousands of them tied together hy the
handles and with their mouths covered.

Continuing to follow the road across the rubbish-hills of Fostitt,
which we have just left, we observe 011 0111' right a Muslim burial-
ground, and at a short distance in front of us the old aqueduct. A
little to the right, on an eminence, rises an old ruined mosque
(lhimi' AM}, 8u'td), beyond it is the Citadel with the mosque of
)lohammed 'Ali, and farther distant are the hills of the Mohattam
(p. 335). This view is very striking towards sunset.

The road, which becomes had beyond this point, leads round
the ruined mosque and ascends heaps of debris. On the top of the
hill it divides. The road to the left leads back to the town, from
the houses of which the Mosque of Sultful IJasau (p. 5200) stands
