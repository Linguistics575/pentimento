Private Apartments for the winter may also now he procured without
much dif1ieulty. A slight knowledge of the language, however, is indis-
pensable, as the servants seldom speak foreign languages. The cost of
living in this way is lower than at a hotel, but it is seldom possible to
secure private lodgings for a shorter period than six months. A sunny
aspect should be chosen, and a detailed written contract drawn up. A
bargain as to food may be made with some neighbouring restaurant.
Wine, see p. 235. Information as to rooms may be obtained at the cigar-
shop of Livadas in the Ezbektyeh; but it is advisable to submit the con-
traet before signing to an impartial resident.
