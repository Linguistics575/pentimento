ANIMAL KINGDOM. 81

  

Mation, it descends to the vicinity of the Delta. (hocod1'Ies are some-
times seen fast asleep, often with widely opened jaws, basking in the
sun on flat sandbanks " on the ends of low islands, to which they most
frequently resort after cool nights. In Egypt, however, where it is oftener
hunted than in more southern regions, the emeudile is generally too
wary tn be caught napping, though it sometimes becomes entangled in
the nets and falls a prey to the f'1sLerrneu, The Arabs of the So1ditn, who
eat the flesh of the reptile and prepare a kind of musk front its glands,
frequently angle for it with large hooks baited with meat.

It is seldmu worth while to fire at crocodiles when swimming, 113
they usually disappear in the turbid water, even when mortally wounded.
The sportsman should therefore endeavour to get within range of one of
these munster saurians when on shore. As they always keep within easy
reach of the water, they are occasionally observed on the banks of the
river by the traveller navigating the Nile, in which case they should be
'approaehed in a small boat as noiselessly as possible. Success is must
likely tn he achieved in eases where the haunt ot' the reptile is known,
511 that the sportsman may lie in ambush at some convenient spot in the
vicinity. Unless, as rarely happens, the first bullet kills the animal on
the spot, it generally eontnves to find its way back to the water, and
thus effects: its escape.

Anethers mnrian of gt'eatpower, and extremely rapid in its move
ments, is the JfotoitoefAvab.u-0, which attains a length of (I.. 5 ft. ., and
derives its name from its supposed habit of giving warning of the ay-
proeeh of a crocodile.

111. OTHER MAMMALIA AND BIRDS. Although not indigenous to
Egypt, several varieties ofApes, which are imported from the S. andW.
provinces are seen in the larger towns.Among, these are the C'ynoce-
phalas hamadeytts and 0.111111111'11 (bnth called 111'1'11 by the Arabs), the
[1111113 ecaadatustArab,nisutis), the (?ercopitlveetuf 1'11bc1', Cgriseo-thidis,
and, more rarely, the P. 'pyrehonottts.

The Nile Valley and the neighbouring desert hills are largely in-
fested hy Bats (Arab. tca.ttoti9, The commonest kinds are the Kalang
(Pterapus), the Lmeg-em'ed Poat (Plecotus, yespertilio, 2hphozoes, Nyctinomus),
aml the Spectre But (Ilhiaolaphtts, Nycteris, Rhinopmna).

Besides the beasts of prey already enumerated (p. 79), we may also
mention the Muslela Africann, several kinds of Hedgehog (Erinaeeus:
Arab. .kon.t'ttd), and the Shrew (Arab. 11111111 .3351).

Egypt contains numerous species of the RooEwrrA.The f'1ehls,dwel-
ling-houses, and sailing-vessels are often infested w ith Mice and Rats (Mus,
Acomys), and in the Sinai Peninsula is found the Dop mouse (Eliomys me-
tttttttees), all of which are called fdr by the Arabs. The Jumping 3fouse
(Dunas; Arab. yerbal‘a) and the Sand Mouse (2feviosres; Arab. gebelijlive
in the desert, and the 'Fat Rat' (Pszttnmomits abcsus) in the sand-hills
around Alexandria.

Besides the BIRDS indigenous to Egypt, there are, as already men-
tinned. a great number which winter there, while others merely pass
through the country when on their way to other regions. About 380 dif-.
ferent species have been ascertained tn occur 'ii'," Eg gypt, but we shall
merely enumerate a few of the n10st important of those w hieh remain
permanently in the eeuntry.

The commonest Birds of' Prey are the (/ohlea 1"altuve (Gypae'tus meei-
dionatis; Arab. big), the White-headed Vulture (vttltut'futtuts; Arab. nist'),
the Eared Vulture (V. auvieulapis), the Goose Vulture (V. cinereus), which,
hnwever, is a bird of paqsage only, the C'aeeion Vulture (Neapiu'an perc-
