of Ita. As Apis is associated with Ptah , so
this bird by the side of Ra is a symbol of
the soul of Osiris. - Ra is generally re-
presented with the head of a hawk, and co-
loured red. lie holds in his hands the sylrr-
bols of life and sovereignty, and wears on
his head a disk with the Urzeus serpent, or
basilisk. According to the esoteric andpan-

were also celebrated in Upper Egypt at an
early period. He is one of the oldest of the
gods, having existed 'on the waters' in the
