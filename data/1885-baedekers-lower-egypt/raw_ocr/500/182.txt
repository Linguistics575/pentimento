I GO HISTORY OF ART.

this vigorous style ofart, occasioned perhaps by political dissensions,
by internal wars, and possibly by a change of religious convictions.
It was not until the rise of the Eleventh Dynasty that the state of
the country became more settled, and. that art begauto revive. The
new style, however, differed materially from the old. As the ancient
capitals of Memphis and This now began to yield precedence to
Thebes, the new centre ofthe kingdom, and asthe system ofwriting,
thelaws, andtheeonstitution, hadallnmlergonematerialalteration,
so, too, it may rather be said that the cultivation ofart hegananew
than that the style then practised was a development of that of the
fourth and sixth dynasties. Of this second eftlorescenee of art no
great monuments have been handed down to us, the most important
works being the obelisks of Heliopoiis and the Fayihn and several
oolossi dug up at Tanis and Abydus. The rock tombs of lteni Uasan
are also interesting relics of the period of the Twelfth Dynasty.
In these we find a reversion to the roek-br1ilding style, which, ae-
cording to Lepsius, is nearly identical with that of the grotto
architecture, and owed its origin to the prevalence of ancestor-
worship, and to the populardesire, arising from the Egyptian doctrine
of immortality, for the preservation of the bodies of the dead. The
rock-tomh was safe from theoverflow of the Nile, while its equable
temperature arrested the decay of the corpse, and a chapel con-
nected with it afforded the relations an opportunity of paying
homage and presenting offerings to the deceased. The division
of the tomb into a series of chambers, leading at length to the
actual sepulehre, soon led to their being architecturally decor-
ated. Where there were several chambers, one behind the other, it
was natural that openings should be made in the walls for the sake
of admitting light. The next step was to convert the remaining
portions of wall into pillars for the support 0fthe roof, and to plane
offtheir corners, partofthe pillar being, however, leftsquare at the
top so as to blend the octagonal column with the roof. In the
next place the oetagonal pillar was sometimes converted into One
of sixteen sides, so as to resemble a column, and in some cases
the flat surfaces were grooved or fluted, a sharp angle being thus
formed between each of them. Polygonal columns ofthis character,
which 000m in the first tomb of Belli lJasart, have been called
Proto-ltorie or lâ€˜Igypto-Dorie by Champollion and Falkener, from
tln ir resemblance to the Dorie columns of the GreeksCFig. il). The
points of resemblance are the marked iluti11g, the taporing, and the
ahsenee of bases; but the Proto-Dorie differs from the Greek Dorie
in being; destitute of the 'eehinm3', a member resembling an over-
hantrinewrvath ofleaves, and formi ng the capital 0fthe Dorie column.
In some cases there is the still greater diiTerenee that the Proto-
lmrie mlnnms are tilifhitetl, the surfaces being left smooth for the
reception of euloured inscriptions. In such cases the column loses
its Mrnptural ssignitieamw, being degraded to a mere surfaee for
