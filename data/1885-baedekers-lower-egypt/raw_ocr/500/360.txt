gregation first pay their homage to a number of pictures of saints hanging
ml the walls (the veneration (it'suints and nf the Virgin heing a prominent
feature of the Coptic system), and then kneel before the altar and kiss
the hand of the priest. They then take their stand (for there are nu seats)
in the part of the church allotted to them, leaning, un crutches which
they bring for the purpose, as the service often lasts for three hmn-s.
The service begins with the reading or chanting of prayers and passages
from the Gospels, partly in the Coptic language, and partly in Arabic,
in which the priest is assisted by a scltirolmaster and a choir ofhoys.
During this performance the worshippers, with very few exceptions,
engage freely in eunversatitm, and the noise is said to be sometimes so
great that the priest has to come out of the hekel, 0r sanctuary, and
enjoin silence. After l time the burning of incense begins. The priest,
swinging his censor. leaves the hékel and joins the omgregalion, each
member of which he blesses, placing his hand on their heads. lIe con-
cludes this ceremony in the Women‘s section of the church, and the
ordinary service new terminates.

The Celebration of the Eucharist is very frequent in the Coptic ehurehes,
immediately following the ordinary service. The celebrant priest wears
a white and gaily cn1hroidered gown reaching io his feet, and bearing
the Coptic cross on the breast. and sleeves. After washing his hands, he
directs a buy to bring him several small round loaves with the Cuptic
cross impressed on them. He chooses the best of them, places it en a
plate, and pronounces over it the blessing of the triune (ted. He then
carries it into the hékel, places it on the altar, covers it with white
cloths, and makes the circuit of the altar several times, reciting prayers,
and accompanied by the choristers carrying lighted candles. He next
hriugs the plate with the bread out trf the hi.ikel and hulds it up before
the people, whereupon the whole eongregaihm kneels. Returning to the
htkel, he breaks the bread intu small pieces, puts it into a cbalice,puurs
wine over it, and eats it with a spoon. distrilmting a few pieces to the
assistant clergy and the clsorisiers. Lest any fragment of the ennseerutcd
elements should be profaned, he tinallv washes all the utensils and his
own hands, and drinks the water in which he. has washed them. Mean-
while a number nfsmall mund loaves. prepared in an adjoining apartment,
are distributed among the cumgregation, each member receiving and eating
one or mere. The laity partake inure rarely of the wine, and unly after
having previously confessed. In this case the couuuunieanls approach
the door of the lttkel, where the priest administers to them with a spenn
tt piece of the bread dipped in wine.

A curiuus ceremony takes place in the Peptic churches on Palm
Sunday ('id esh-shatiinitt). After the usual service and the emumuninn
which follows it, several lmsins (if water are placed in the space before
the hékel. The priest in his white surplice takes his Maud in frnut of
them, turning his face towards the héket, while another priest in his
