in the roek-temple adjoining the Sphinx (p. 365). The monument
has even been supposed to be entitled to claim still higher
antiquity; for M. Mariette, while examining a ruined building
at the foot of the southernmost of the three pyramids which
rise to the E. of the Great Pyramid, found a stone built into
a wall, bearing an inscription which seemed to imply that the
Sphinx already existed in the time of Khufu, the builder of the
first pyramid. The inscription on the right side of the stone runs
literally thus: - 'The living Horus, the King of Upper and Lower
Egypt, Khufn, the life-dispensing, found [in making excavations)
the Temple of Isis, the patroness (hant) of the Pyramid in tho
place (Le. in the immediate vicinity) of the Temple of the Sphinx'.

The Sphinx is written res Bi J_iu, which signifies 'to

guard" " 'watch', or 'the watchman', an expression precisely equi-
valent to the Iel-hit' (p. 362) of a later period. The above in-
scription, however, is of later date than the time of Cheops. The
large tablet of Thothmes 111., found between the paws of the
Guardian of the Neeropolis, has been already mentioned. This
celebrated Pharaoh (p. 80) restored the Sphinx, and seems specially
to have revered it, as is indicated by numerous small monuments
which bear the figure of the Sphinx coupled with his name or his
portrait. In the inscription already referred to, the Sphinx is said
to speak to Thothmes 'as a father to his son', and to address him in
the words - 'l am thy father IIarmaelis'. Though more or less
buried in sand at various periods, the Sphinx was highly admired
and revered down to so late a period as that of the Roman emperors,
as numerous inscriptions upon it, now concealed by the sand,
testify. Curiously enough, the Sphinx is mentioned neither by
Herodotus nor any later Greek traveller.

8igai.fcatiotr of the Sphinx. The Greeks and Romans call the Sphinx
Harmachis, or Armaehis, which is equivalent to the ancient Egyptian
llar-em-khu, i.e. Horus on the horizon, or the sun in the act of rising.
llarmaehis is the new-born light which conquers darkness, the soul which
overcomes death, or fertility which expels harrenness. Being the power-
ful antagonist of Typhon, he was victorious over evil in different
shapes. IIe achieved some of his most brilliant exploits in the form 0
the winged disk of the sun, and conquered his enemies in that of a lien
with a human head, Le. in the form of a Sphinx. The scene of this
vietury was the Leontopulitan Nome, the name of which is derived from
the in) th. In a papyrus preserved at Berlin the solar god is said sume-
times to take the form of a lion, and other shapes also, llarmachis,
in the burial-places, promises resurrection to the dead. Turned directly
towards the 19.. his face first reileets the brilliance of the rising sun,
and he illumines the world after the darkness of night. Itarmaehis,
dwcllirw, U!) the outskirts of the desert, overenmes sterility and prevents
the sand from overwhelming the fields. This last attribute was still
ascribed hy the Arabs at a late period to the Sphinx-Hnrmachis, who
is called hy Greek inscriptions Agatho0arnum, or the "good spirit'. The
morning was considered sacred to llarmaehis, and it is in the E.that
