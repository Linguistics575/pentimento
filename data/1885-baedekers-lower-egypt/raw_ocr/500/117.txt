HISTORY. 95

pherites) of Mendes at length succeeded in eompletely
throwing off the Persian yoke, and heeame the founder of
the 20th Dynasty. His chief endeavour was to secure the
friendship of the Greeks, with a view to strengthen himself
against the Persians.

Artaxerxes IL, surnamed Mnemon.

The Persian king endeavoured to recover Egypt, but
Akhoris, the successor of Naifuurut, threw obstacles in his
way by supporting his enemies, particularly Euagoras, the
tyrant of Salamis in Cyprus, and by improving the defences
of his country.

Psamut (Psammuthis) and -

Naifuumt (Ne epherites) 11., the successors of Akhoris,
reigned for short periods only.

N ekht- hor-heb (Nectctnebus f.),however, the next native
monarch, a Sehennytie prince, the founder of the 30th
Dynasty, completed the warlike preparations of the Egyp-
tians, and entrusted the chief command of his troops to
Chabrias, an Athenian general, who signally defeated
Pharnahazus, the Persian general, at Mendes.

Artaxerxes 111., Ochus.

Tuchos or Teas, who succeeded Nekht-hor-heb, invaded
Persian 1'hamicia, supported by a body of Greek allies.
During his absence his nephew Nehht-nebf (Neclanebus II.)
usurped the E O'yptlan crown, but was defeated by Arta-
xerxes III. and driven into Ethiopia. Egypt 110W surrendered
to Artaxerxes, and again became a Persian satrapy (3i5j.

Darius 111., Codomannus.

Alexander the Great, after having defeated Darius 011 the
Granieus (334), and at Tssms C333), and captured the Phil-
istine town of Gaza, marched to Pelusium, and was received
with open arms by the Egyptians, who regarded him as their
deliverer from the Persian yoke. He tolerated the native
religion, visited the Oasis of Ammon, and founded Alexan-
dria(p. 207), which, under the Ptolemies, became the great
centre of Greek culture and of the commerce of the whole
world.

In the lists of) the Pharaohs we find the 28th, 29th, and 30th
Dynasties mentioned as contemporaneous with the 27th orPenzian
Dynasty.
