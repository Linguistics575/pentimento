Arabian Bazaars, see pp. 23, 251. Near the end of the Nuski iS a
shop kept by a Nubian, who sells various Egyptian and Nubian articles,
suitable for presents. Thus an ostrieh-egg costs 3 fr. and upwards, a
specimen of the falgftha, Ot' hall-fish (p. 84) 3-5 fr., a Nubian Ianee 1fr.,
bow with six arrows 12-15 fr., small fiddle 12 fr., square fiddle 20 fr.,
leopard skin 15-30 fr. (the skins, however, are insufficiently tanned, and
almost entirely stripped of their hair). Unless the proprietor of this shop
happens to be in want of money, it is difficult to obtain anything from
him at a reasonable price, and he sometimes closes his shop entirely. -
Stieks and whips of Hippopotamus Skin are sold by a Pole (who speaks a
little Italian) near the Roman Catholic church.

Arabian Woodwork is sold by "Pavois, an Italian, on the left side of
a court near the entrance to the Bluski. Strangers should not fail to visit
his interesting workshop, which they may do without making any pur-
chase. Similar objects may he obtained at a more moderate rate from
Irenisio, opposite Shepheard''s Hotel, and Bertini, adjoining the H6tel du
Nil, hut their workmanship is scarcely so artistic, as that of Harris.

The dates of the Religious Festivals of the Mohammedans, of which
Jairo is the principal scene, cannot easily be given according to the Euro-
pean computation of time, owing to the variable character of the Arabian
lunar year. Calendars reducing the Mohammedan and Coptic, reckoning
of time to the European system may, however, be obtained at any book-
seller’s.

The firsi. month of the Arabian year is the Moltat-rem, the first ten
days of which Cashel and particularly the 10th (gem 'rtshtira), are eon-
sidered holy. On these days alms are distributed, and amulets purchased.
Mothers, even of the upper classes, carry their children on their should-
ers, or cause them to be carried, through the streets, and sew into the
children's caps the eopper-coiws presented to them by passers-hy. On the
10th Moharrem, the highly revered IAshha day, on which Adam and Eve
are said first to have met after their expulsion from Paradise, on which
Noah is said to have left the ark, and on which Wtstn, the grandson of
the prophet, fell as a martyr to his religiun at the battle of Kerhela, the
Gitmir P_Iasanén (p. 292) is visited by a vast concourse of religious de-
vntees, whose riutous proceedings had better not he inspected except from
a carriage, especially if ladies are of the party. Troops of Persians in
long white robes parade the streets, cutting themselves with swords in
the forehead until the blood streams down and stains their snuwy gar-
ments. Two boys, representing lllasan and 1.lustm, are also led through
the streets on horseback, with hlood-siaine0 clothes. Htrangers may also
obtain admission to the Persian musque, in whivh the orgies are continued,
by special introduction. Towards cvening a great zikr of whirling der-
vishes takes place here fp. 239).

Detached groups of pilgrims oeeasiona1Cv return before the rest of the
eavaleade, and their arrival is always signalised by the blowing nf trum-
pets and beating of drums. A pyramidal wooden erection, called the
3lulmtut, hung with beautifully embroidered stuffs, and carried by a
camel, accompanies the procession as a symbol of royalty. The interior
of the )tahma] is empty, and to the outside " it are attached two copies
of the Koran. The procession usually enters the city by the Bdb en-Nasr
tp. '2Ni. In Ca-'?, hrs. it reaches the Rttnleleh (p. 262), the large open
space in front of the citadel, from which last twelve cannon-shots are
fired 11“ e Hullltv. The enrtége then sweeps round the Ittunilleh, and tin-
