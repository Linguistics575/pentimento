When the work of the day is over, the solemn and s01101'ous ery
of the mneddin, summoning the faithful to prayer (see p. 147),
reverberates from the tops of the minarets; but much of the
busy street-traffie goes on till nearly midnight, and during the
month of liamadén it even continues throughout the whole night,
while the barking of hungry dogs and the braying of donkeys fre-
quently form an additional interruption to repose. At a very early
hour in the morning the same scenes reeommenee, and 011 leaving
his hotel the traveller is tempted to believe that Cairo is celebrat-
ing a never-ending Carnival.

While perambutating the streets of the city the traveller will
frequently have occasion to observe the Schools (kuttdb), which are
open on the side next the street, and one of which is attached to
almost every public fountain. He will find it very amusing to wateh
the efforts of the filo, or schoolmaster, in teaching his pupils with
the aid of admonitions and blows, while the boys themselves re-
cite verses of the liorin with a swaying motion of their bodies,
bending over their metal writing-tablets, and yet finding time for
the same tricks as European sehooiboys. Unless the visitor has an
order of admission from the minister of pubiie instruction, it is not
advisable to watch the filith too closely, as he is easily diseoneerted
and is then apt to be uneivii.

These schools all have a purely religious character, and are exclusive-
ly creatinns of El.. Isliim. The mere reading and recitation of verses from
the Kuran beingi 111 itsalfconsidered a meritorious act, the great object of
these schools is to teach the pupils to recite the kiii1 by heart. Each buy
is provided with tt copy of the sacred hook, if he can alliurd to buy one,
an ink and pen case (dmcdyeh) and a tablet of metal or of wuud painted
white. After learning the alphabet, the pronunciation and the values of
numbers, he is then taught the ninety-nine 'beautiful names of Al1iih'
eentained in the Koran, a. 'rrioiviii,"e" of which IS necessary lo enable him
b, repeat the ninety- -nine 111113013 of the 3Iohatnmeilan rosary (sehha).
The boy is then made to write nut the thha. or first chapter (snrch)
of the 1ioriin, which he reads often enough' t1) impress it perfectly 1111
his memory, swaying his body to and fro the while, whereby, as he
imagines, his memory is rendered more pliant. After learning the first
chapter, he next proceeds to learn the last, the last but one, and the
others in the same inverted order, until he reaches the setumil,the rea-
son being that the chapters gradually diminish in length from the
