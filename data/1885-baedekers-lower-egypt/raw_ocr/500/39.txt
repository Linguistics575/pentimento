MUSICIANS. 10

and the oftener is the narrator applauded with protracted cries of
'Aah', or 'Allith', 0r 'Allihu akbarl’.

The story-teller generally occupies a small stool on the mastaba,
whence he delivers his address. Most of the members of this class
belong to the so-ealled sho‘am (sing. sM'ir(), literally 'singers'.
They are also known as ‘Andtireh (sing. 'Antari) or Abu-Zédtych,
according as their theme consists of tales and romances from the
history of 'Antar, a Beduin hero, or from that of Abu Zéd. Others
again are called Moltadditin, i. e. narrators of history, their province
being the recital in prose of passages from the history of Sultan
E.z-fyhir Bébars, who reigned over Egypt in 1200-77 o. lol).
The entertainments of the ‘ulf léleh u ttteh' (thousand and one
nights) are, however, no longer heard, as popular superstition has
branded this collection of tales as 'tmlueky'. There are also profess-
sional improvisors and travelling singers, whose performances are
very popular; but the themes of the whole fraternity are too often
of an immoral character.

MUSICIANS by profession. called ttMitt/eh (sing. mats), are in-
dispensable on every festive occasion. The usual instruments are
the refs]? or tambourine with little bells, the na.kl.ttreh, or semi-
spherical tambourine, the Gemr or hautbois, the .tabl beledi or
drum, the .tabl shami 0); kettle-drum, and the daraht"dceh, a kind
of funnel-shaped drum (generally made of earthenware, but some-
times of mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell, with afislr-skin stretch-
ed over the broad end), which last is accompanied by the zummém,
a kind of double flute. A better class of instruments, used for
chamber music, consists of the wit, a kind of flute, the kamengeh or
two-stringed violin, the body of which consists ofa eoeoa-nut shell,
the rebabeh, or one-stringed violin with a square wooden body, the
oklsnt"tn, a kind of zither with strings of sheep-gut, and lastly the
Yul, the lute or mandoline, the oldest of all the instruments.

The Egyptians consider themselves a highly musical people, and the
traveller will indeed often he struck by the frequency of their singing.
The Egyptian sings when indulging in his kéf (p. 23), whether sitting
on his heels or stretched out on his mat, when driving his donkey, when
carrying stones and mortar up a scaffolding, when working in the fields,
and when rowing. He sings whether alone or in company, regarding his
vocal music as a means of lightening his labour and of sweetening his
repose. A peculiarity of the Egyptian songs, however, is that they have
110 tune, though they have a certain rhythm, which is always dependent
on the text. They are sung through the nose on seven or eight different
notes, on which the performer wanders up and down as he feels in-
clined. + The character of this so-ealled music is exceedingly monotonous,
and to a European ear displeasing. The songs (mawwdl " shughl) are all of

a lyrical description, most of them are erotic and often grossly obscene,
and many are at the same time pointless and meaningless. Some of

f In the large work entitled the ' 3001: OF SONGS' au endeavour is
made to reduce Arabic music to a system, and the notes are divided
into seven different keys, each having the same notes, differently arranged;
but the popular songs are sung without the least regard to these artificial
rules.
