monument was erected by Usertesen I.', who also founded the obelisk
of Heliopolis (p. 333), and belonged to the same family (12th Dye.) n3
Amonemha 111., the founder of the Labyrinth. - A visit to Bihamu
and Ehgig is "ltiefly interesting to archaeologists, and perhaps to beta-
nists also.

Exctms10Ns. A whole day is required for a visit to the Pyramid
of Hau-(irah and the Labyrinth (horse 10, donkey 5 fr.). The route
leads at first for 3/4 hr. along the bank of the Baht Y1lsuf. The first
village of any importance is Uhafch. Onr path traverses well c111-
tivated land with numerous water-wheels. The corn and cotton
fields are shaded by numerous sycamores, lebbeks, palms, and
other trees. About 1/2hr. from UhMeh, and beyond two smaller
villages, we reach a bridge of ancient brick masonry. Traversing
the slightly undulating tract a little farther, we reach the Bahr

feta Md (/river without water'), also called el-Bats, a deep tshale.-
nel, extending in a wide curve, and terminating near the N.E. end
of the Birket el-liurtm (p. 465). In winter the water, which trick-
les down from its lofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the
bottom of the channel grow reeds and tamarisks. The S. bank
rises at places nearly perpendicularly to a height of 20 ft., so that
the sequence of the strata of the soil is distinctly observable. We
now ascend the plateau (the highest in the province, 88 ft. above
the sea level) 011 Which lies Ha,wUet el-Kagab or Ilawaret el-
Malcta, a considerable village, with a mosque (reached in 13/4 hr.
from Medinet el-Faytm(). The traveller may apply to the Sl1tlrh-el-
Jeled [prefect of the village) for a guide to the pyramid of Ilawira.
1f the water is high, and the canals have to be avoided, we have
to make a circuit of nearly 2 hrs. to the Labyrinth, but by riding
hrough the water, where necessary, it may be reached in 3/4 hour.

The longer route is preferable, as it passes several relies of
antiquity. A little beyond the village rises the bridge of Kandtir
el-Ayoni, the ten buttresses of which rest on a foundation of mas-
sive stone. We continue to ride along an ancient embankment, and
thus reach the J.futa.santa structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully jointed stops of large and well-hewn hlocks, but bears
no inscription whatever. We cross the Bahr el- WaroMn, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Ha1virah, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Balm cl-Mclckh or Bahr tush-Sherlii,
i.e. river of the East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
which, according to Lepsins, was probably the Labyrinth (see be-
low). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to ascend at once the Pyramid of Ira..
wara. This consists of unburut bricks ofNile mud mixed with straw
(comp. p. 370â€˜), and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area
or upwards of' 116 sq. yards. It has been ascertained that the nu-
cleus ol' the structure is a natural mass orroek, 30 ft. in height. The
dilapidatvd summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a flight of
well-worn steps. The entrance to the pyramid, 011 the S. side, was
