who differed from him in ereed. Till then he had been a. devout Shtrite
and exacted obedience from his subjects as their lawful Iruiim, but had
repudiated any Imumge approaching to deifieation. Ile now, however,
dcvoted himself entirely to the Ultra-Sys" ites, who elevated hint to the

at the mosques, ceased to organise "pihgrimages, and exacted from his
subjects the veneration due to a god. lslfun became a matter of indifference
to him. and he permitted the Christians and Jews who hail embraced
the religion of the prophet to return to their former faith, although by
Mohammedan law such conduct was punishable with death. Al] the
suppressed churches and synagogues were re-established, and their property
restored to them, and the sumptuary laws were repealed. At 1ength,o11
the night of 12th Feb.1021, El- Ilftkim disappeared, having probably been
assassinated while taking one 'of his nightly walks on the Mokattam
hills. The Druses (the sect founded by Tii"- -barazi, above mentioned),
however. believe, that El-l.rilkim voluntarily withdrew from the world in
cunsequence of its sinfulness, and that he will one day re-appear and be
worshipped by all nations as the last incarnation of the Deity.

Until quite recently the greater part of the old mosque lay in
ruins, but the heaps ot'rubbish have now been removed or levelled,
so as to clear the great court for the reception of the building ma-
terials of the Wald. The central part of the sanctuary was restored,
as far as its advanced stage of dilapidation allowed, in order to
contain a museum of Arabian art, which will shortly be opened.
The court of the old mosque is to be occupied by a school of art.

The whole building occupies an area about 400 ft. long and
3:10 ft. wide. The great court was adjoined 0n the side next the
sanctuary by five aisles 01' arcades, on the W. by two, and on the
N. and S. by three. These were supported by brick pillars, 10 ft.
high and 41/2 ft. thick, incrusted with stucco. Thepillars are rounded
at the corners and bear pointed arches approaching the horseshoe
form. The ceiling and the wooden bolts were formed of the stems
of the date-palm. The Cutie inscriptions and arabesques are of little
artistic value, and the entire struetme was much less carefully and
artistically built than its model, the Gami Tulun. - On the N.
side of the mosque are two massive Mabkhara (p. 177), with bases
executed in the style of the Egyptian pylons. That at the N.E.
corner is connected with the old town-walls, the bastions of which
bear inscriptions dating from the yreneh occupation of 1700.

the N., passing on the left an okella with an interesting gateway
enriched with stalactite decoration, and a facade adorned with
Arabian wood-carving. We now reach the -

Bab en-Nasr, or “Gate of the Help of G011”, the plan of which
was probably derived from the lioman castle of liabylon (p. 320].
The ancient city-wall to the W. connects this gate with the
similar Bab el-Futuh, or Trate of Victory". These two gates,
together with the fortified mosque of Sult.in J.jtkirn situated be-
twven them (see above"), formed a strong position for the troops
of Napoleon, “hose cannons have only recently been removed
