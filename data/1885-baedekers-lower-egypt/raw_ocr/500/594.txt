rocks in many different directions, and excavated them in the form of
lahyririths, whilst (as in the TT"iidi Maghiira) they left pillars here and
there to prevent the roof from falling in. To judge from the extent of the
mines the quantity of ore obtained must have been very considerable.
To this day one of the mines contains a considerable quantity of copper
ore, while another, where chambers 80 ft. in length have been excavated,
seems to have been given up as exhausted'. (Riippell.)

On the hill above the mines stands an ancient Egyptian obelisk
with half-obliterated hieroglyphics.

Descending the Wédi Nagb towards the N. we reach the month
of the Wadi FJobtoz (see below), where the caravan should be
ordered to await our arrival. _

Beyond the Wiili Merattameh the Suez route continues to follow
the Wiidi Shwik, to the N.W., passing a number of fine seyil trees
of great age. After 1 hr. the valley takes the name of Wtuli Hobt‘tz,
and in less than 1 hr. more it unites with the W0di Nugb, which
almost immediately joins the Wtuh' Bafba', a valley leading to the
S.E. to the Hanak et-Lalcam (p. 490). At the junctiou of the
Ijnbflz and Nasib valleys our route turns to the right, and leads
across the sandy table-land of Debbet el-Kerrti in 3 hrs. to the
beginning of the Wtdi el-I_Iomr. Ascending a little towards the
middle of the lofty plain, we enjoy a fine view of the Sarbt‘tt el-
Jemel, (2175 ft.), rising to the W. opposite to us, beyond the Witch
IJomr. To the left, in the distance, are picturesquely shaped
mountains with tlat summits; to the right is the Tih range; and
behind us are the hills of fijarbtit. el-Khidem, the Jebel Ghiribi,
and the distant Mt. Serbi1.

We now descend to the broad route leading to Nakhleh (p. 52(0.
on the right rises the long Jebet Btdu'. On the ground here we
observe a number of curious geological formations, consisting of
slabs and fragments of sandstone encrusted with nodules of iron
ore, with a large admixture of silica, grouped like bunches of
grapes. Some of these are perfectly spherical.

The Wtuli eI-Homr is a broad valley flanked by low limestone
hills. It is commanded on the N. side by the f.larbt5t. el-Jemel (see
above). From this valley a path, practicable for camels, traverses
the Wddi Mesulckar and several other valleys, and leads direct
to the Wiidi eth- That (p. 48N. The regular route follows the Wtuli
el-ljomr to its union with the Wt"uii Shebékeh (see p. 489). Thence
to Suez, see pp. 4t30-48t5.
