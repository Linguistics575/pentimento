To the S. of the last is the Satin cl-Gt‘uni' (PI. 10), or Anterior
Court, enclosed by vaulted galleries, in the upper parts of which
plain limestone has been used instead of alabaster. In the centre
is the Ijanefiyeh (p. 184), designed in the (lehased Turkish style.
On the W. side is the approach to a tower, terminating in pavilions
in the Chinese style, and containing a clock which was presented
to Mohammad 'Ali by Louis Philippe of France.

A magnificent *iiVmw is obtained from the parapet at the S.W.
end of the mosque, which is reached by walking round the building.
(The palace of the Khedive, fitted up in the European style, is
uninteresting.) From this point we survey the yellowish grey city,
with its countless minarets, domes, and gardens. At our feet stands
the mosque of Sultin l.tasan. To the N. and W. are the windmill-
hills-? and the green plain traversed by the Nile. To the W. in
the distance are the Pyramids, towering above the desert. On the
flat roofs of the houses we observe innumerable air-pipes, called
malhaf, known also by the Persian name ofudgir, by means of
which the cool north-wind is introduced into the houses.

The other mosques in the citadel cannot Le visited without special
permission (p. 2311). Many of the chambers have been diverted from their
original uses, so that they are not easily inspected, and are moreover in
a very ruinous condition.

The Gtimir tia1tilteddin Yi1suf (P1. (IO), situated to the S.E. of the
Masque of Jlnhammed 'Ali, was erected in A. D. 1171-98, in a style betray-
ing the influence of Western architecture, and in many points resembling
that of a basilica. Here, too, the [minted arch predominates. The openings
under the arcades are of the elongated Moorish form. The dome was
mice supported by nine magniiicent columns of granite, hut it has now
fallen in, the only remains ofit being the deeply sculptured pendcutives. As
in the case of most of the ether mosques, the columns have heen taken
from ancient monuments. The Kibla is handsomely embellished with
miniature arcades, in the interior ufwhieh are rich arabesques. The eotl'ered
ceiling of carved wood is painted white and gilded, with a blue ground.
The windows are still partly filled with tracery in plaster. The whole
edifice up to the roof is of solid masonry. The minarets, each enn-
sistiug of a cutie with a cylinder above it, are covered at the " with
slabs of green porcelain, and are encircled with a band of 'Sullus' characters
in white 011 a brown ground.

Immediately tn the S.E. of the Mosque of Saladin is the so-called
Well of Joseph (Pl. 27), 0. square shaft, sunk in the limestone rock to a
depth of Fo ft., containing somewhat brackish water, which is brought
to the surface by means of two siiiyyehs, one above the other, worked by
oxen halfway tlnwn the opening. Since the introduction of the steam-
pumps (p. 'deli), however, the well has lost its former importance. When
the citadel was constructed here in the 12th cent., the buil0ers discovered
"It ancient shaft filled with sand, which tktldteddirt Yfisu.f t'ttusctl to be re-
opened and named after himself Yttsuf's, 0r Juscph‘s, Well. This cir-
cumstance gave rise to the tradition, which was cLielly current among
the Jews, that this was the well into which the Joseph of scripture was
put by his 1sreihren,and the story is Mill faithfully repealed hy the dragomans,
