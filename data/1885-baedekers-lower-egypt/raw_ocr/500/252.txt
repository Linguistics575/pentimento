covers the eastern and lower half of that valley, while the western half
consists of marshy ground with several islands, bearing rains of ancient
buildings; (3) The chain of hills to the 8. of the lake, about 5 M. in
width, and consisting of fertile land, with the ruins of about forty an-
eient villages; + The hlareotie plain, stretching bt the margin of the
desert, and also containing many ruins.

During the Arabian and Turkish regime the waters of the lake
gradually subsided, but in 1801, during the siege of Alexandria, the
English cut through the neck of land between the lake and the sea near
the so-called Naison Carrée, a little to the IV. ofAbuliir, thus laying an
extensive and fertile region under water and destroying about 150 vil-
lages. The present Es-Sett marks the spot where the fatal cutting was
made and afterwards closed. Muhammed rAli did all in his power tn
repair the damage and to improve the environs of Alexandria, but about
f00,000 acres of cultivable land are said still to be covered by the Seat-
water. The water is now evaporated fur the sake of its salt , the right
to manufacture which is farmed out by government for 4000 purses
(nearly 20,UUUL) per annum.

We observe at intervals the sails of the barges on the Malunfr-
(liyeh Canal, and long strings of laden camels traversing the
embankments. 17 M. Kafr ed-Dawtfr was the point at which
Arabi erected his strongest fortifications in 1882, after the English
had occupied Alexandria and I-lamleh. We now perceive the first
notton-flelds on the right. - 28 M. Abu Iiomg. a group of mud-
hoveis.

381/2 M. Damanhiir Ciirst station at Which the express stops,
reached in 11/4 hr.), the capital of the provimre,of Behéreh, with
25,000inhab., was the ancient Egyptian Tema-tm-Hor (city of
Horus), and the Roman Hermopotis Parua. The town lies on an
eminence. and contains some tolerablysulrstantialbuildings. Among
them are several manuraetories for the separation of the cotton
from the seeds, and above them tower several minarets. The
Arabian cemetery lies close to the railway. In July, 1708, Iona-
parte, on his expedition to Cairo, selected the route vii Hamanhtor,
which at the time was so excessively parched and burned up that
his ofileers and men suffered terribly, while he himself narrowly
escaped being taken prisoner. On letJuly, however, he succeeded
in defeating the troops of the Mamehlkes at the ' tattle of the Py-
ramids', and on the 20th he entered Cairo. In Now, 1802, the
Mamelnkes here inflicted a signal defeat on the Turks. A large
market is held at JJatnanhAr on Sundays, and a smaller one On
Fridays. (From Oamanhtor to Pam el-Balzr and Rosetta, see p. 4118.)
