whirling and howling dervishes, of whom some thirty or forty lake part
in the performances. The scene is of an exciting, hut somewhat painful
character, particularly if any of the performers become 'melbds', a con-
dition resembling that of epileptic convulsion (p. 152).

The month Ramadan is succeeded by that of Shawwdt, on the first
three days of which is celebrated the first and minor festival of rejoicing,
called by the Arabs El-Hd ef-t.Sttt/httyyir (the lesser feast), but better
known by its Turkish name of Beirrtm. The object of the festival is tn
give expression to the general rejoicing at the termination of the fast;
and, as at our Christmas, parents give presents to their children, and
masters to their servants at this festive season. Friends embrace each
other on meeting, and visits of ceremony are exchanged. During, this fes-
tival the lihedive also receives his principal offteials, ambassadors, and
other dignitaries.

At this season the traveller may also pay a visit to the cemetery hy
the Bat) eu-Naer. Or to one of the others. where numerous Cairenes assemble
tn place palm branches or basiliCum (riluin) on the graves of their deceased
relatives, and to distribute dates, bread, and other gifts among the poor.

A few days after the Beiriim, the pieces of the Kiswch, or covering
manufactured at Cnnstantinople, at the cost of the Sultan, fur the Ka'ba
(the most sacred sanctuary in the interior of the temple at Mecca), whither
it is annually carried by the pilgrims, are conveyed in procession to
the citadel, where they are sewn together and lined. The ceremonies
which take place on this occasion are repeated on a grander scale towards
the end of the month of Shawwdl (generally the 23rd), when there is a
gay procession of the esc0rt Which accompanies the pilgrimage caravan
tn Mecca, and which takes charge of the Maturval (p. 236). On this oe-
easion every true believer in the prophet, if he possibly can, spends the
whole day in the streets. The women don their smartest attire. Many
of the harem windows are opened, and the veiled inmates gaze into the
streets. The chief scene of the ceremonies is the Rumeleh (P1. F, 2), at
the fool of the citadel, where a sumptuous tent of red velvet and gold is
pitched for the reception of the dignitaries. The procession is headed
with soldiers, who are followed by camels adorned with gaily coloured
trappings, and bearing on their humps bunches of palm-branches with
oranges attached. Each section of the cavalcade is preceded by an
Arabian band of music, the largest section being that which accompanies
the Takht Rattan, or litter of the Emir el-l.lagg, and the next in order
that of the Delft el-Jjagg, 0r leader of the pilgrims, with his attendants.
Next follow various detachments (if pilgrims and dervishcs with banners,
and lastly the 2talyna1 (see above). A picturesque appearance is presented
by the camp of the assembled pilgrims (ljuggi) at the Birket et-IJagg
(p. 335), whence the caravan fltially starts for Mecca.

On the 10th of thtl-higgeh, the twelfth month, begins the great fes-
tival of El-Hd el-Kebie, which resembles the lesser feast (e1-'id es-sug-
hnyyir) already mentioned. Ibn this day, if on no other throughout the
year, every faithful Muslim eats a piece of meat in memory of the sacri-
tice of Abraham, and the poor are presented with meat for this purpose
by the rich.

The Muslims also celebrate the Christian Easter Week, although in a.
different manner. and of course for different reasons from the Christians. On
Palm Sunday (trad el-kho) the women bind palm twigs round their heads
and fingers. On the following day (Monday) it is customary to eatfat'as
(cucumbers) with eummin. On the Tuesday the diet of the faithful cen-
siAs of a kind of cheese-hruth with onions, and the day is therefore call-
ed y6m el-mish wa‘I-basal (‘cheese-soup-and-onion-day‘). Wednesday is
railed arba' Jtyilb, or ‘th‘s Weduesday'. On this day the trhubera herb
is Puid lo have addressed to Job the words - 'Wash thyself with my
Juice. and thou shalt recover”. He did 80, and recovered, and to this
day the whole of the Egyptian Muslims wait themselves with ghargllm'a
lt'g/tib in mvmury of the miracle. M(tmltly Thursday is the Pea-Thursday
at the Muslims (Mantis el-bisilla). Good Friday is called gmn’a et-mafr0-
la, or 'day of the huiter-cakes'. Saturday is the sebl en-ttth' or ‘suhhath
