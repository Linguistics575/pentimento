and geraniums, all of which have been grown in Egypt from a very
early period. A bushy tree, which in its half 1eafless condition attracts
the attentiun of every traveller on landing at Alexandria in winter, is the
Poinsettia pulcherrima. The insignificant blossom is surrounded by leaves
of the most. brilliant, red, presenting a very picturesque and striking ap-
pearance. Natural forests, ur even solitary wild trees, are never met
with in the valley of the Nile or in the valleys of the northern deserts.
0n the tunbankmenls and on the brink of the rivers we occasionally
find wild tamarisks and willows (.str.f'.sti./'), but always in the form
of mere bushes. In the rleseri-valleys of Upper Egypt, however, grow
five different kinds of acacia and several other shrubs of inferior interest.
Another tree of considerable importance is the beautiful ddm palm, which
grows wild in the valleys of S. Nubia and even in the oases, but those
which occur in N. Egypt are always planted. Even in Lower Egypt it
is not met with beyond 27° N. latitude (indeed hardly beyond Keneh],
and attempts to acclimatise it at Cairo have never been successful. . Lastly
we may mention two circumstances which thrnw some light on the ho-
tanical position of Egypt. One of these is, that, the commonest weeds
associated with the industrial crops of Egypt, and which occur nowhere
else. are of E. Indian origin; and the nther, that. numerous plants euUi-
vated by the Egyptians are only now to be found in their wild condition
in the central regions of Africa.

foal, muhr; the rider, khayytil) was prohably unknnwn to the most ancient
tigyptians. and was first introduced by the Ilyksus (p, FIS). It is now tu
be met. with throughout the whole ut' the valley of the Nile, and even in
the oases. Owing to want of pruper care and insufficiency of food, the
ligyptian lmrses are generally of insignificant appearance.

The Egyptian Donkey (Arab. (tomttr; comp. p. lt) is noted for its
pnwer of endurance, its spirited temper, and its moderate requirements.

The Mule (Arah. bnghl, or baghleh), although admirably adapted for
carrying heavy burdens, is less frequently bred in Egypt, but is some-
times imported from Ahyssinia, Spain, and uther parts of southern Europe,
Syria, and Asia Minor.

The Camel (Arab. Jemel, fem. milm; the camel for riding, hegio), was
nut nnknuwn tn the ancient Egyptians, as it is mentiuned in several
papyri, hut it was probably rarely used, particularly during the early
monarchy. During the hottest weather the camel can dispense with
water for three days or more, while its scanty provcnder consists of a
few handfuls of maize 01' beans, of the dry and wiry desert grass, of
straw, or of prickly acacia leaves.

The Buffalo tArah. Jdntils) seems tn have heen long domesticated in
Egypt. Its ilesh is nut esteemed, but the cows yield milk and butter.
The buffalo requires little fond and attention, but does not thrive except
in swampy ground or in the vicinity of flowing water. The hide forms
strong and valuable leather.

The (M (Aral). (6r; COW, brt.karrt; calf, “fat; milk, chen; sweet milk,
hnlih; sour milk, Miner! or Mb] thrives in Egypt on the dry soil of the
arahie land, and is also reared in the oases. ann in the year .1863
Egypt possessed a hmg-horned race of oxen which is often represented
nu the monuments; but the breed was entirely swept away by a cattle-
plague during that year. The fellahin make both hatter and cheese from
the milk. Instead of a churn they use a leathern hag suspended from a
rripe ttirbeh),

The Goat (Arab. me'za or 'anzeh; he-gnat. tés,. kid, gidi) is to he
found in every cottage nu the banks of the Nile, and in every tent in
the desert. Its milk is palatable and wlus1esornc. The hide makes
durable and waterproof water-bags.

Sheep (Aral). 'iharilf, na'gch, ghmmm, rmm's; rum, kebsh) are almost,
as generally kept hy the Egyptian peasantry as goats, the must esteemed
