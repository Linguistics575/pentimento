48 TIIE MODERN EGYPTJANS. Dwellersin Towns.

of that race, they have entirely lost all its nobler characteristics in
consequence of their intercourse with strangers and their dehasing
occupations. Genuine Beduins are to be found nowhere except in
their desert home, where to a great extentthey still retainthe spirit
of independence, the courage, and the restlessness of their ancestors.
As in the time of Herodotus, the tent of the Bednin is still his
home. Where itis pitched is a matter of indifference to him, if
only the pegs which secure it be firmly driven into the earth, if it
shelter his wife and child from the burning sunshine and the chilly
night air, and if pasturage-ground and a spring bewithin reach. In
consequence of the frequent wars waged between the different
tribes, every Beduin is a warrior. Most of them, too, as might be
expected, are extremely poor. Thus at Ramieh on the coast, near
Alexandria, the traveller will have an opportunity of seeing awhele
colony of the poorest class eneamped in their tents, where they
live in the most frugal possible manner, with a few miserable goats
and the fowls which subsist on the rubbish in their neighbourhood.
Though professors of El-1slim, they are eonsiderably less strict in
their Observances than the fellil.1tn of the valley of the Nile, who
are themselves suffleitmtly lax, and above all they sadly neglect
the religious duty of cleanliness. They do not observe the practice
of praying five times a Jay, and they are, as a rule but slightly ae-
quainted with the Koran. Relics of their old star-worship can still
he traced among their customs.

The traveller will oeeasionally observe llednins in the bazaars
of the arinonrers and leather-merehants, and will be struck with
the. proud and manlyhearing of these hronzed children of the desert,
whose sharp, bearded features and steadygaze hetoken firmness and
resolution. 1n Egypt the traveller need not fear their predatory
proponsitics, but they have frequently attacked travellers in Tur-
kish Tripolitania and in the eastern part of Arabia Petrzea.

(4). ARAIIIAN DWELLHRS IN Town's. Those.Arabs with whom the
traveller usually comes in contact in towns are shopkecpcrs, of'iiisials,
servants, ceaehmen, and donkey-attendants, or perhaps these last
only, as most of the best shops are kept hy Europeans, while in of-
fleial and legal matters his intercourse with the natives is carried
on through the medium of his eonsul. The indolence and duplicity
of these Arabs, which proceed to some extent from the character of
their religion, have often been justly condemned, while theirin-
telligence, patience, and amiahility are too often ignored. They are
generally of a much more mixed origin than the fellzihin, as the va-
riens conquerors of Egypt usually made the towns their head-
quarters. Alexandria, for example, was ehi0fly favoured by the,
Greeks and Arabs, and Cairo by the Arabs and Turks. It thus hap-
pens that the citizens of the Egyptian towns consist of persons of
every emnplexien from dark brown to white, with the features of
the worshippers of Osiris or the sharp profile of the llednins, and
