Fapttm. DiMEH. 9. Route. 467

and none of those small relics of the period of the Pharaohs, which are
usually found so abundantly among the ruins of Egypt, have been dis-
covered here. This was perhaps the site of the ancient Dionytiat, a town
which probably sprang up on the ruins of a Roman military station,
situated on the extreme western side of Egypt. Ott the outskirts of the
ruins are walls which perhaps belonged to gardens; there must also have
been once an aqueduct for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants and
their gardens with water.

From Kasr Kuran to Dtmeh is one day's journey. Dimeh is
situated opposite to the point at which we approach the lake from
fjenhrhr. The scanty ruins on the s. bank of the lake CEI-pant-
mama, etc), are not worthy of a visit; but the ruins of Dimeh, al-
though no inscriptions have been found there, present some attrae-.
tion. A street, 400 yds. in length, formerly embellished with figures
of lions, leads to a platform on which an important temple once
stood. The numerous blocks scattered about here, resembling mill-
stones, and apparently aitifieially rounded, are discovered on closer
inspection to be of natural formation. The paved court was sur-
rounded by a brick wall, and the temple itself contained several
apartments; a peristyle, with columns now in ruins, led to the en-
trance. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they
suffice to prove, that a town of very considerable importance, per-
haps the ancient Bacchis, once stood here.

Excursion to Méiltun.

The PYRAMID AND MASTABAS 0F 31Aoihr, the oldest monuments in the
world, deserve a visit, which if the traveller approaches by the river, may
he accomplished from the village of Ri.k.ka in about fl hrs. (railway trav-
ellers may perform it in about the same time from the el-Wasta station;
comp. p. 458). Crossing the railway, we proceed on donkey-back in ab0ut
11/4 hr. to the pyramid, which rises close to the cultivated country on the
soil of the desert, 11/2 N. to the N. of the village of Médam. This appears
to be the oldest of the local names handed down to us, as It is met with
on the mastabas of the early period of Snefru.

The Pyramid of Médilm is so different from all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs ‘El-Haram el-8atldiib', or 'the false
pyramid'. From a large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in three different
stages at an angle of 74°10, and is still preserved to a height of 122 ft.
The first section is 69 ft., and the second 201/2 ft., while the third, now
almost entirely destroyed, was once 3'2 ft. in height. The outer walls con-
sist of admirably jointed and polished blocks of Molgattam stone, The
holes in one of the surfaces were made by Lepsius and Erbkam when
they examined the pyramid, the construction of which afforded them an
admirable clue to the principle upon which the others Were built (comp.
p. 350). The Pyramid of uddfarr1 was never completed; the heap of debris
at its base consists of the material which once filled the angles of the
different sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The pyra-
mid was pillaged as early as in the time of the 20th Dynasty. It was
opened in 1881 by Maspero, who found along corridor and a chamber
without sarc0phagus. Perhaps in this pyramid Snefrw, the first king of the
4th Dyn., was buried, as in the neighbouring tombs persons related to him
are interred.

The Mastabas of Nédism, which were opened by Mariette, lie to the
N. of the pyramid. These were the tombs of the relations of Snefru
(tth Dyn.), and in many respects resemble the mausolea of Sa1iliiirah which
hear the same name. The facades of the most important of them are
