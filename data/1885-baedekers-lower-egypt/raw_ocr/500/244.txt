vided with gardens. Pompey's Column is easily found and forms
a convenient landmark.

The great centre of European life is the Place Méhémet Ali
(formerly Place des Consuik), which is embellished with plantations
oftrees and two fountains. It was the principal scene of destruc-
tion in 1882. In the centre rises the Equestrian Statue off1fol.iarnrned
'Ali CPI. 35), the founder of the reigning dynasty of Egypt, designed
by Jaguemard, and cast in Paris. The statue is 16 ft. in height, and
stands on a pedestal of Tuscan marble 20 ft. in height. As the
Mohammedan religion forbids the pictorial or plastic representation
of the human form, the erection of this monument was long f)O-
posed by the 'Ulama, or chief professors of Ilivine and legal learn-
ing'. On the N.E. side stands the English Church CPI. 2ri), adjoined
by Si. Marks Building and the International Tribunal (PI. Mf),
the only buildings which escaped the fury of the natives in 1882.
The wooden booths and sheds which were erected after this period
of devastation have now been removed, and their place has been
taken by temporary shops and warehouses of a more substantial
character.

From the S.E. corner of the square we reach the triangular
Place de l’Egtise, or Square Ibrahim, the former name being derived
from the Roman Catholic, church of St. Catharine (P1. 30) situated
here. The Rue de la Colonne Pompée leads hence to the S. to the
Porte de ta, Cotonnc Pompie, or Paris " Cit. Outside this gate we
pass a large Arabian cemetery, lying on the right, and soon reach
an eminence 00vered with rubbish and fragments of ruins, 011 which
rises 'i'Pompey's Column LPI. 37; E, (r). The monument is composed
of red granite from Assuin, which has withstood centuries of ex-
posure to the elements; and it is now the only important relic
of antiquity in the city. The pedestal, composed of several
blocks which once belonged to other buildings, was formerly covered
by the earth and is much damaged. The height of the column,
together with the disintegrated, or perhaps never quite completed,
Corinthian capital, and the pedestal, is 104 ft.; the shaft is (37 ft.
high, and is about o ft. in diameter below, and not quite 8ft. at the
top. The proportions produce an exceedingly harmonious effect.

This handsome monument does not derive its name from Pompey
the Great, when was murdered on the Egyptian coast (p. 97) after the
Battle of Pharsalia, hut from the Ileman prefect Pumpeius, who, accord-
ing to the inscription, erected it in honour of the uncunquered I?ioe,1ctiarn,
thn_‘dvfender of the city of A1csaudria'f. There is no ground for sup-
