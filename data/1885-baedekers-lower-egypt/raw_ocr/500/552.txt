yellow surface of the desert, present a remarkably colourless
appearance, but the soil is not entirely destitute of vegetation,
especially in spring. One of the commonest plants is the Bethartm,
(fantolina fragrantissima), of which the camels are very fond, and
which is full of aromatic juice; it is collected by the natives in the
N. part of the peninsula. Golden eoloeynths (Handel; Citrullus
colocynthis) are sometimes seen lying on the way-side, having
fallen from their dark green stems. The dried shells are sometimes
used by the Beduins for holding water, or as a receptacle for butter.
The inside of the fruit is sometimes used as amedieine. The Seyttl
(Acacia tortilis) occurs frequently farther S.; the juice which it
exudes [Gum Arabic) is collected by the Beduins for sale. Chewing
the gum is said to be a good remedy for thirst.

The (21/2 hrs.) Wadi el-‘Amara, and beyond it the IJuier er-.
Rekkab ('rider's stone'), consisting of several masses of rock, are next
reached. The ground becomes more undulating. In the distance,
to the 8., rise the Jebel Hammc‘nn Far'iin (p. 488) and the long
Jebel Gharandcl (p. 487). In less than 2 hrs. we next reach the
sand-hills in the Whdf Hawera, 011 the summit of which a bitter
spring rises. Around it grow a number of stunted palm-bushes
and a few thorns. This is believed to be the Marah of the Bible,
mentioned by Moses (Exodus, xv. 23--25j.+ Burekhardt conjec-
tures that the juice of the berry of the gharhad (Nitrasia tridentata
Desi), a shrub growing in the neighbouring Wtdi Gharandel,
may have the property, like the juice of the pomegranate, of im-
proving brackish water; but the Arabs know of no plant possessing
the virtue of that thrown into the spring by Moses.

Stations of the Israelites in the Wildevrtess, and member of the Emi-
grants. The Biblical record of these stations continues as follows (Numb.
xxxiii. 8): - 'And they departed from before Pi-Hahiroth, and passed
through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days
journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Narah. o. And
they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve
fountains of water, and Ihreeseore and ten palm trees; and they
pitched there.' The desert of Etham (which adjuined the hastiuns of
Khetam) may new be traversed more quickly by at Sinai pilgrim with
little luggage; but it could hardly have been crossed by a whole nation
in less than three days. Marah is thus the hitter spring in the Wddt'
Jlamira, and Elim, with its twelve springs and seventy palms, has long
been sought for in the Wadi Gha-ramlet, although, as we shall see, the
distance from Hawara to Gharandel (211rs.) is a very short journey, even
fur so large a number.

Standing on the margin of the spring of 1rawtura, the thoughtful
traveller will naturally ask, how ()00,000 men with their families, that
it, at least two million persons, could possibly have drunk of its waters. H

f 23. 'And when they came to Murah, they could not drink of the
waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore the name of it was
called Marah fi.e. hitter). 24. And the people murmured against Moses,
saying: What shall we drink? 25. And he cried unto the Lord, and the
Lord ahewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the
waters were made 'sweet'.
