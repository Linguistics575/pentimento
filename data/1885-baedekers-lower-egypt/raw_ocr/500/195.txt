HISTORY OF ART. 1 T3

 

identical. No attention whatever was paid to tastefulness in group-
ing or uniformity of arrangement, the separate scenes being merely
placed beside or over each other; but, individually, these are re-
markable for distinctness and excellence of execution, and they
afford us a far more vivid picture of the life of the ancient Egypt-
ians, their customs, their wars, and their religious rites, than
any written chronicle could have afforded. In artistic finish, on the
other hand, these scenes are defective, and the colouring has 110 in-
dependent value, being merely used to make the figures stand
out more distinctly, and imitating nature in the crudest possible
manner.

In the province of artistic conception we find Egyptian im-

crown of Lower Egypt; the white crown of Upper Egypt;
the united crown of Upper and Lower Egypt; and the Crieus

serpent. On diadems and suns was placed the emblem g). The
Urzeus serpent, possessing the power of life and death, was

the emblem of kingly power. The sceptre, user, denoted author-
ity of various kinds, power, wealth, and victorious strength. The
seeptre i, which is read Its, t'am, or ouub, indicates the name of

the Theban nomos; :7, a basket, siguities a master; CEP, a
decorated basket, a festival, or solemn assembly, at which offerings
