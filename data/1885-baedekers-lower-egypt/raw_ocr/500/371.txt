opened when the water is St high as to endanger the E. hank near Kaer
en-Nil and the new town of 1sura'iliya. The bed of this arm ofthe river
has been widened. deepened. and protected by emhankments . work
which was begun in l>66).am1 nearly oue-third of the volume of the
File can be conducted through this channel. The emhaukments were

The maeunry was executed by native workmen. the woodwork by
J. Mannstein of Vienna. and the marble-work by Bonani ot'Carrarn. The
decorations of the walls in the. principal apartments were designed by
c. Y. Diehitsch. and the silk-haugin,t,s were manufactured by Detrogat
of Lyons from designs by Franz. Most of the ironwork is from the Laueh-
hammer foundry near Dresden. The furniture in the N. wing is chittily
Parisian, and the rest was partly manufactured by Parvis (p. 2361. and
