III. Outline of the History of Egypt.

CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.

INTRODUCTION. There is no people in the world whose history
is traceable to so remote a period as that of the Egyptians. Other
nations may possibly have understood the art of writing as early as
they, but no specimens ofit have been preserved; whereas the Egyp-
tian records, hewn in stone, burned in clay, or written on leather
01' on scrolls ot' papyrus, have survived the ravages of thousands of
years. The preservation of these memorials, however, is mainly
due to the dryness of the air in the rainless valley of the Nile, and
to the property possessed by the hot sand of the desert of hermetic-
ally sealing everything committed to its keeping.

The remote dates with which Egyptian chronology deals seem my-
thiea] when judged by the standards of Jewish and Christian chrono-
graphers, and particularly when compared with the supposed date of
the oreation of the world; but they are derived from the lists given by
1Ianetho, which have been confirmed by the monuments themselves.

The priest MANETHO (Egypt. Mai m That, Le. 'beloved of Thoth") of Se-
hennytus (the modern Semenntld, p. 4l5), being acquainted with the Greek
language, was employed by King Ptolemy ll. Philadelphus (B.C. 284-246)
to translate the ancient historical works preserved in the temples. This
'Egyptian History‚Äù of Manetho enjoyed a high reputation at a later period,
but was subsequently lost, with the exception of his lists of kings and their r
dates, which have been transmitted to us partly by Flavius Josephus, the .
Jewish historian (lst cent. A.D.), and partly by Christian historians.

The monuments and inscriptions in some cases oontirm, and in
others supplement, the records transcribed by Manetho for the
Ptolemies, on)- information being derived from the series of kings'
names inscribed 011 tablets found at Abydns, Karnak, and Sahlgitra,
from papyrus scrolls, particularly one in the Museum ofTurin, and
lastly from historical and geneaIOgieal notices on the walls of tem-
ples and tomhs, on statues, implements, and trinkets. A method-
ieal mode of utilising these fragmentary historical records was first
taught by the learned Prof. Lepsins (d. 18811).

The lists of the Pharaohs are arranged in the families 01- dynasties
of the Thinites, Memphites, and others. If it be assumed that these dif-
ferent houses reigned in succession, and their reigns he simply added
together, the sum Which results is very large. But, if it be assumed that
many of the dynasties mentioned by Manethe reigned contemporaneously
in different parts of the country, the reigns of members of the leading
dynasties alone have to be added together, and a comparatively moderate
sum is the result. Adopting the former method of computation M. Mariette
has fixed the date of Menes. the first King of Egypt, as B.C. 5002, while
Sir Gardner Wilkinson, proceeding on the latter assumption, assigns the
date B.C. 2700 to the same monarch. Lepsius, on the other hand, believes
the true date to be 3.0. 3802, as Manetho states that an interval of 3555
years for 3553, taking into acteunt the differenee between the Egyptian
and.the Julian year) elapsed between the reign of Memes, the first King of
Egyirt,.and that of Neetanebus II. (13.0. 340), the last of the native sover-
eigns. Our information becomes more definite after the beginning of the
New Empire, while from the 26th Dynasty (B.C. 685) downwards the da-
tes of the different kings are well ascertained.
