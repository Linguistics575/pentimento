F DOCTRINES OF EL-uyfuu. 153

of the villages of Syria the traveller will observe small dome-
eovered buildings, with grated windows, and surmounted by the
crescent. These are the so-ealleil Weli's, mansolea of saints, or
tombs of shékhs. In the interior there is usually a block of stone,
hewn in the shape of a sarcophagus and covered with a green or
red eloth, on Which texts from the Koran are embroidered in gold
or silver. The walls are generally embellished with paintings
representing the saered cities of El-Isliun, and executed in an
amnsingly primitive style. Suspended from the ceiling by cords
and threads are little boats, ostrich eggs, and numerous paper
bags filled with sacred earth from Mecca. In one corner are
a thick wax candle and a heap of bones of all kinds. The tomb is
usually surrounded by a burial-ground, where certain persons have
the privilege of being interred, Schools are also frequently connect-
ed with these weli's. Shreds of cloth are often seen suspended from
the railings of these tombs, or on certain trees Which are consi-
dered sacred, having been placed there by devout persons. This
enrious custom is of ancient origin.

About the end of the 18th century a reaction against the abuses
of El-Islim sprang up in Central Arabia. The WAHHABITES, or
Wallhabees, named after their founder 'Abd el-Wahhih, endeav-
oured to restore the religion to its original purity; they destroyed
all tombs of saints, including even those of Mohammed and 1Jt1sthi,
as objects of superstitious reverence, and sought to restore the
primitive simplicity ofthe prophet's code of morals; and they even
forbade the smoking of tobaeee as being intoxicating. They soon
became a great political power, and had not Mohammed 'Ali deemed
it his interest to suppress them, their influenee would have been
far more widely extended than it now is. - As to the Sent1si
order, see p. 67.

We have hitherto spoken of the doctrines of the Sunnites (from
sunna, 'trailition0, who form one great seet of El-lslim. At an early
period the SHi‘ITES (from sWa, 'sect') seeeded from the Sunnites.
They assigned to (Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed, a rank equal
or even superior to that of the prophet himself; they regarded him
as an incarnation of the Deity , and believed in the divine mission
of the iméms descended from him. El-Mahdi, the last of these,
is believed by them not to have died, but to be awaiting in
eoneealment the eoming of the last day. The Persians are all
'Sht'ites. Towards the West also Shi'itism was widely disseminated
at an early period, partieularly in Egypt under the regime of the
Fitimite sovereigns. The Shi'ites are extremely fanatical, refus-
ing even to eat in the society of persons of a different ereed.
The other seets, which are el1iefly eontined to Syria (the Jiehttcileh,
the Isrna'tltyeh, the Nosairiyeh, the Druses, ete.), are noticed in
Baeilelrer's Syria and Palestine.
