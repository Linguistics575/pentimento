luxuriant crops for which the province is famous; while the western-
most part chieﬂy consists of sterile desert land. To the w. and N. of the
Birket el- Kurun rise precipitous limestone hills, beyond which lies the
immense sandy desert of Sahara. The Fay0m must have been reclaimed
from the desert at, a very early period, probably during the early empire,
in the reign of Amenemha Ill. as monuments of his period indicate
that he was perhaps the first of the Pharaohs who sought to regulate
the whole course of the Nile. 0n the Upper Nile Prof. Lepsius has
found Kilometers constructed by that monarch, and in the Fayiim, on
the site of the Labyrinth, a number of blocks of stone inscribed with his
name. The Greeks called him Ameris, or Moeris, and believed that the lake
known to them as 'Lake Mceris’, which they regarded as a marvel of
engineering skill, was named after him. The word mart, however, is
the Egyptian for lake or overflow, so that the great basin of the Fayiim
was .sippl.y 'the Jake'; and it was from his exertions in connection with
the ir rigation works that Amenemha obtained the name of Noeris. We

learn from several inscriptions and from a papyrus roll treating of the
Fayiim, that the province was known in the time of the Pharaohs as Ta
shet, 01' the lake- land, and that Lake llluaris was called han-t, signifying
the discharge or posterior lake. On its hank rose the celebrated Laby-
rinth, which was probably renewed by the Bubastite monarchs of the
22nd Dynasty. About the same period the town of Crocodilopolis, siiuat-
ed on Lake Meeris, and afterwards called Arsinoii after the wife of Pto-
lemy Philadelphus, was so extended and embellished by Osorkon I. that
it is called the 'city of Oserkon I.' in the inscription on the celebrated
stole of? Piankhi. The whole province was at first called the lake- -land,
then the district of Crocodilopolis, and lastly the Arsinoite Name. The
deity most highly revered here was the crouodile-headed Sebek, the rep-
tile "sacred to whom was carefully tended in Lake Moeris At the same
time the voracious and dangerous monster, notwithstanding the reverence
paid to it uh account of its connection with the inundation, was also
regarded as Typlaonie, and the Croeudilopolitau name was therefore
passed over in the lists of Homes. - At the period preceding that of the
Psarntikides of the 26th Dynasty the Labyrinth appears to have been used
as a hall for great imperial assemblies. At the period of the Ptolemies
and the Romans the products of the Fayiim were much extolled. 'The
Arsinuite Nome', says Straho, Hs the most remarkable ofall, both 01] ac-
count of its scenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it alone is
planted with large, full-grown, and richly productive olive-irees, and the
oil is gond when carefully prepared; those who are neglectful may in-
deed obtain oil in abundance, but it has a bad smell. In the rest of
Egypt the olive-tree is never seen, except; in the gardens of Alexandria,
where under favourable circumstances they yield olives, but nu oil. Vines,
corn, padded plants, and many other products also thrive in this district
in no small abundance'. - Strabn‘s description is still applicable at the
present day. The oranges and mandarins, peaches, olives, figs, cactus
fruit, pomegranates, and grapes grown here are much esteemed, and the
beautiful, rieh-coloured red roses of the gardens of the Fayftm, which
were once so lavishly strewn at the banquets of Cleopatra, still thrive
here. At the station of Medinet el-Fayiim small phials of attar of roses,
of inferior quality, are frequently offered for sale. Isma'il Pasha devoted
special attention to this favoured part of his dominions. The fields, which
are watered by means of wheels of peculiar construction, yield rice, sugar,
cotton, flax, and hemp, besides the usual cereals. The beginning of No-
vember is probably the season at Which the traveller will obtain the most
distinct idea of the fertile character of the district. - The Inhabitants
are fe11ii1y"n,orti11ers of the soil, and Beduins. To the latter race be-
long the poor fishermen who inhabit the banks of the Birket el- Kurun.
ifii2y of the peasants also call themselves 'Arabs' , and the wealthier of
them are generally well 1nounted.

The RAILWAY JOURNEY is preferable to the voyage up the Nile
in point of speed, and the passenger obtains a good view of the
