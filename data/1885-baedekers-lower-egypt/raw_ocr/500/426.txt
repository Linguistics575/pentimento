sian dynasty, took the city by storm after his victory at l’ehisium
ULC. 5'25) over Psammetikh III. (the last king of the 20th ])yn.);
and two centuries later it was entirely eclipsed by the foundation of
Alexandria (po. 332), although it still retained some importance
during the Roman period (B.C. 30). In consequence of the edict
of Thooi1osiusOrD. 370-305; comp. p. 100] the temples and sta-
tues were destroyed, and under the later Byzantine monarchs the
heretical Monophysites (p. 101) seem to have been very numerous
here. Makaukas, the leader of the Copts, was established at Mem-
phis while negotiating with 'Amr Ibn ol-Ni, the general of'Ornar.
The Mohammedan conquerors transferred their residence to the
right bank of the Nile (comp. p. 941), opposite the northernmost
part of Memphis, using the weli-hewn blocks, which had once
composed the venerable palaces and temples of the. ancient city of
Memes, for the construction of their palaces, castles, and mosques.
Memphis, however, was so vast, that it was long before its plun-
derers succeeded in entirely destroying it. Down to a late period
its ruins excited the admiration of all visitors. Thus 'Abdsllat.if
(at the end of the 1'2th cent), after a lively acemmt of numerous
attacks sustained by the enormous city, assures us that even in his
time, the ruins contained a profusion of' wonders which bewildered
the mind and baffled description. 'The more profoundly we con-
template the ruins (he says), the greater does the admiration he-
come with which they inspire us; and every new survey we
take becomes a source of fresh delight.' On Ireholding the ruins
he cannot help regarding as pardonable the popular belief, that the
ancient Egyptians were giants of prodigious longevity, who had
the power ofmevingmasses of rock with a magieian's wand.lfter
the time of 'Abdollattf the rapidly dwindling ruins of Memphis are
rarely mentioned. Stone after stone was transferred as from a
quarry to the opposite bank of the Nile, and we are told that the
site was systematically explored by treasure-seehers, who took
many centuries to exhaust its precious relies.

The '"co1ossa,1 Statue of Ramses IL lies in a hollow, having
unfortunately fallen with its face to the ground. The head is turn-
ed towards the SW. This huge statue was discovered by Messrs.
(inviglia and Sloane (p. Mi] in 1820, and presented to the British
Museum, but owing to the diffieulty of transport it has never
been removed. It consists of remarkably hard and fine-grained
limestone, and before it was injured was about 4?, ft. in height.
The workmanship is admirable. The features, which resemble
the Semitic type, are exactly similar to those of this great molr-
arch ('the Sesostris of the Greeks) as portrayed on numerous
other monuments, particularly at Thcbes. He wears the royal
