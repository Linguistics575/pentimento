sum of money, he obtained the sanction of the Porte to a new
order of suceession based 0n the law of primogenitnre, and
in 186? he was raised to the rank of Khedive, or Viceroy,
having previously borne the title of midi, or governor of a
province only. In 1873 the lihedive obtained a new firmin
"onfirming and extending his privileges (independence ol'
administration and juilieiaries; right of concluding treaties
with foreign countries; right of coining money; right of
borrowing money; permission to increase his army and navy).
The annual tribute payable to the Porte was at the same
time raised to 133,635 purses (about 681,538t.) With re-
gard to the warlike successes of the Khedive and the ex-
tension of his dominions, see pp. 29, 30. - The burden
of the public debt had now increased to upwards of 100 mil-
lion pounds, one loan after another having been negotiated
by the tinarltye minister Isma'it Siddik, who finally became
so powerful that the Khedive deposed him in 1878 and cans-
ed him to be privately put to death. The Powers now brought
such a pressure to bear on the Iihedive, that he was com-

and to accept a ministry under the presidency of Nubar
Pasha, with the portfolio of public works entrusted to M.
lllignieres and that of finance to Mr. Rivers Wilson. This
coalition, however, soon proved unworkable; Nubar Pasha
quitted the ministry in consequence of the lihedive's Cnf'mur-

and early in 1879 the whole cabinet was replaced by a na-
tive ministry under 'Sherit' Pasha, The patience of the Great
Powers Was now at an end; and On the initiative of Germany
they demanded from the Porte the deposition of lsma'tl,
which aevordingly took place on June 26th.

lsma’il was succeeded by his son Tewfik (pronounced
Tev/tlc) or Taufilg, under whom the government was carried
on in a more rational spirit, especially after Riaz Pasha be-
came the head of the ministry. The debts were regulated,
an international commission of liquidation was appointed,
and an extensive scheme of reform was undertaken. In 'Sept.,
1881, however, a military revolution broke out in Cairo,
which had for its objects the dismissal of the ministry, the
grant of a constitution, and above all the emancipation of
Egypt from European influenees. The Khedive was besieged
in his palace and had to yield; he appointed Sherifpresident
of a new ministry and arranged for an election oi' Notables,
or representatives. As the latter espoused the 'national'
reuse, Sherif resigned in Feb., 1882, and Mahmi‘nl Pasha
formed a new ministry, the programme oi' which tallied
I‘xautly with the demands of the national party. The new
