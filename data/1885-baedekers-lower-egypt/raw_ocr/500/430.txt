been discovered, but most of them were, in a ruined condition. Many
of ihem, however, yielded interesting spoil to the se,ientifle explnrer, and
copies were made trom their monuments and decorations, but most of
them have again been covered up to preserve them from the influence of
the air and the repaeity of relic-hunters, my that the visitor is now hardly
aware of their existence. The scientific traveller, however, may obtain
special permission from the n111Seun1 authorities to unearth the interesting
tomb of Ptahhotep (p. 401), or any of the others.

The rocky margin of the plateau of the desert, between the village
of Abusir (p. 370) and the road ascending from Sahhira, contains numer-
nus Tomb-Chambers (comp. p. 382), none of which now merit a visit,
eseept perhaps that of Bekenrauf, of the period of Psammetikh I. The
Mustaba Farin, see p. 402; the Pyramids of Dahshtr, p.t02.

The Grottoes of the Ibis Jhtmmies and of the Cats, containing a num-
ber of mummies piled up together, are now closed, being considered
dangerous. The whole of the soil of the Neeropnlis is indeed so honey-
eomhed with tombs that great caution should be used in traversing it.
Some of the open shafts are no less than 50 ft. in depth.

'The traveller is lost in the immense
expanse of desert, which he sees full of
Pyramids before him; is struck with
terror at the unusual scene of vastness,
and shrinks from attempting any dis-
eovery amidst the moving sands of
Saccara.' Bruce.

The Necropolis of Sahhera. [from Sokar, p. 126) extends over an
undulating tract of the desert, which, according to M. Mariette's
computation, is about 7700 yds. in length, and 550.-1600 yds. in
width. It contains sepulchral monuments of every kind, from the
pyramid to the roek-hewu cavern, dating both from the ancient and
the later empire. Many of the recent excavations are now covered
with loose heaps of light-eolourei1 sand. The whole of the Necro-
polis has been repeatedly explored both by the Byzantines and the
Khalifs, as well as by modern explorers. Many generations have
been enriched by its treasures, and yet an immense profusion of
relies was still left to be discovered by the indefatigable M. Ma-
riette. It is nevertheless probable that this mine of antiquities,
which has so marvellously preserved everything committed to its
keeping, is still far from being exhausted.

Ancient writers have recorded many interesting facts regarding
the 1Neeropolis of Memphis, and have mentioned various parts of it
by name. The Pyramids, eleven in number, have indeed been
identified, and the Serapeum has been excavated, but all trace of
many other features have been irrevocably lost. Who, for example,
can possibly tell where now to look for the sacred take across which
the mummy of Apis was conveyed by boat; or the beautiful pas-
tures near it, which were once compared with Homer's asphodcl
meadows; or the temple of the gloomy Hecate, and the, gates
of Coeytus and of Truth; or the site of the statue ofJustiee without
a head; or the multitude of sacred and profane buildings mentioned
by the later Greek papyri as having; belonged to this burial-
ground? On the other hand, the numerous tombs within its pre-
