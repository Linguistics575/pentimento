ttne of the most interesting of these' " the copy of 'Ahcl cr- -llrrrmi.k. wri
by 'Abd c'l'- Jiahmtin 11111. Abilfath in the year 590 of the Jlegira. and dedicate
tn the mosque "ot' tlusén, 115211137 83/4 inches. This lioriin is more remarkable
for age than Liiiii.ir"."'"iio" the s'upilrseviption of e111:11 sureh are added how
the number of verses and that of the words tuidletters it contains, besides
traditional utterances of the Prophet connected with the chapter in
question.-- a most laborious piece of work,. resembling what has heen
done by Jewish scholars in preparing copies of the Old Testament.
Another eopy,dating from b'35 of the llegiru, 123/1 by 101/e inches, which
once helonrred io the mosque of Husen, has its titles in gold, but it is in
11 damaged condition.

Next in interest is a Koran of Sultan Muhammad en-Wd 11.111- ibn Séfeddin
117de (1293-1341), 21 by 14 inches, written 11y Ahmed hisuf, a Turk, in
130 of the llegira. It is written eritireny in gilded characters, and there
is also a second copy of a similar description. Several otherForiins date
from the reign of th1l.tiin 8harbtin (1363-11) grandson of the 1asitnarned.to
whose mosque they were dedicated The tirst of these, dating from 761).
1211/2 hy 191/1. inches, has not its titles written in the usual Cut1e character,
and the headings in the name oft'rod the all -mereit'111 are in gold. "
the same date and similar size is the t'ioritn of A"hortdabttraka, mother
of Suujin s'1ia'irhn. The tirst two pages are written in gilded andeolourwd
characters, 11111e being the prevailing, colour. and are illuminated with
stars and arabesques; the next two are in gold. embellished with faint
aralresquesiand the w hole work is written in abold and excellent style.
Another copy ot bultan l:'rha'bi%,dating from 770, of the same width, Inn
11 little longer contains some i',liiiiiiii'i workmanship 1111 the early pages.
The text. is wider than that of the last, and the hook is bound in two Ci.
11mes. Another and stilt larger copy, dating from the same year, measures
323/1 hy 21 inches. All these last were destined for the schnnt in the
Khtti.t. et-Tabbdneh (street of the straw-sellers). founded hy Khondabm'aka,
the Sultan's mother. Lastly. we 1nay mention another copy written in
778 by order of the same prince, by 'Ali ibn Mohmmned el- Jfokallib, and
gilded by fbtuihittt el-Amedt', from which we gather that these Fortns
were sometimes the work of several diCerent hands. This copy measures
28 by 201/1 inches, and above each sureh is recorded the number of
words and letters it contains. All these may'il.rif are written on thick
and strong paper, and vie with each other in magnificence. The designs
exhibit no great variety, but they are executed with the most efalrrsrate
care and neatness. The text of these Korans is provided with red letters
written above certain passages to indicate where the tone of the reader's
virice is to be raised, lowered, or prolonged.

The 1aolleetion contains three Korans of the reign of b'yl.tiin 3111-10};
(1'51? OO), the oldest of which, exeented' 1n 760.meastrres 'thy 32 'inches. It

b.vtAbtiepeal.tmtin eytitiigh, with one pen in sixty days,and revised by Muham-
med ibn Ahmed ibn 'Ali, surnamed Ellinfti. A second copy. of the same sul-
tau'g reign, and of similar size, has its first and last pages restored in the
same style as those of other copies, but the modern workmanship is
inferior to the ancient. A smaller Forty, of the year 80l,measuring 23
by191/e inches, is written entirely in gilded characters.
