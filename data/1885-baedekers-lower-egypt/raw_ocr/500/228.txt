The elder palace. to the left. on the prominent [Ms et-Tiu (cape 0 figs,
p. 2191, and the Arsenal are cumparatively uninteresting, especially as
the busy harbour itself now engrusses the whole attention. The steamer
is Snnn surrounded by numerous small heats, the oeeupants of Which
pro0'er their services with animated gesticulations. As soon as the brief
sanitary inspcetion is over, the lmatmen swarm wildly on deck like a
piratical crew, eager to secure a fare, and reminding the traveiler of a
scene from Meycrheer‘s Africainc. In the midst of this hustle and con-
fusit n the following Arabic words may he found useful: - ta'dl, come;
sldif, lunk Ioerei mush 'titteak, 1 don't want you; mush ldzim, it is not
necessary; imshi or rd?, begone. A supply of half-frane pieces and sous
should he kept in readiness for the occasion.

Having sufficiently surveyed the novel and picturesque scene, the t
traveller engages a boatman to convey him and his luggage ashore, or, I
especially if ladies are of the party (see below), he gets one of the hotel
agents to manage everything for him. Befure leaving the vesselhe should
keep a watchful eye on his luggage, and see that the whole ofit is placed
in the boat which he himself is going to use. As soon as the boat is
clear of the steamer the Arab hoists his sail, for he never rows unless
absolutely obliged, and steers for the et1stom-house. Any importunity as
to the fare may be simply answered with - ‘tayyib, yatta, yalla' (all
right, make haste).

()n reaching the landing-stage of the Cusiom-IIoute (Pl. 21), the trav-
eller is first conducted to the passport-office (to the left, in the passage),
and gives up his passport, Which is afterwards restored to him at the
consulate at Alexandria, or he may have it sent after him to Cairo.

Meanwhile the luggage has been landed, and the traveller, if alone,
and with ordinary luggage, pays the boatinen 21/2-3 fr., or for 2 persons
41-5 flu, and for each additional person 1 fr. more. The porter who carries
the luggage into the enstum-house and afterwards to a cab expects 25e.
for each package. All these rates of payment are amply remunerative,
hut 'batshtslt' (p. 16) is invariably asked for, and the word will resound
in the traveller's ears throughout the whole of his journeyings in the
East, and even long afterwards.

The custnm-house examination is generally pretty rigorous, the ar-
ticles chiefly sought for being tobacco, weapons, and diamonds. No fee
need be given to the offieials. .

As already observed, it is preferable, especially when ladies are of
the party1 to secure the services of one of the hotel agents, who re-
lieves the traveller of all tmuhle, pays hoatmen and porters, and assists
in clearing luggage at the eustom-houge. In addition to his outlay, he
receives a fee of 21/2fr. from a single traveller, or more in proportion
for a party. The principal hotels now send their own boats to meet
the steamers. The traveller who wishes to ensure a comfortable
disemharkalinn may write beforehand to the hotel at'which he means
to put up, and desire a commissionnaire, a boat, and a carriage to meet
him. The usual charge in this case fur a party of three persons is: -
heat from the steamer to the eustom-house 5 fr., luggage-boat 2 fr., porter
and fee tu eustorn-himse officers 2fr. T3e., carriage to the hotel 4'/2fr., l
carriage of luggage 2fr., or Ihr. 256. in all.

At the egress of the custom-house a noisy and importunate crowd
of carriage-drivers and donkey-boys lies in wait for new-comers. Neither
walking imr riding is recommended to the traveller on his first arrival,
and hr had better drive straight to his hotel. Carriage to the hotels
(34 Mn 2'/2fr., or fur 3-1 persons 3-Mr.; donkey 1/2fr.; porter for each
large paet'anrc 1/2fr.

Hotels. tlt may again be remarked here that all the hotels in the
E1151 Charm.» a fixed sum per day for board and lodging, exclusive of
liyiyrrs, whether the traveller takes his meals in the house or not.)
