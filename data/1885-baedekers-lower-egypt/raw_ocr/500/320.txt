In the same street, a few paces farther to the s., we observe on
the right the long Okella Kuit Bey, with its carefully executed
gateway and characteristic ornamentation. The facade is built of
massive stone, and is tolerably regular, but the mushrebiyehs are
of inferior workmanship and probably of later date. The gate is
mounted with large iron nails. The ground-floor is vaulted, while
the upper floor has an open ceiling. The edifiee was completed in
the year 877 of the llegira.

A little farther to the s., projecting in an angle, is a public
fountain, now in ruins, also erected by Iiait Bey. The shallow
niches, the upper parts of which are shell-shaped, are in the form
of fantastic arches.

Beyond this sehi] is an open space. on the right side of which
is the *Tomb-Mosque ofFait Bey (p. 268], the finest a1ifiee among
the Tombs of the Khalifs, with a lofty dome and beautiful minarets.

The Sahn el-6ttrnir was once closed by a mushrebiyeh
lantern, which fell in 18752.. The rest of the ei1ilice has an open
ceiling, as in the case of
the mandates (p. 185). The
Dikkeh, in the form ofa hal-
eony, resembles that in the
mosque of liait Bey adja-
centto the mosque ofTult1n.
The details are very elabn
orately executed. Within
the mausoleum are shown
two stones, one of red,
and the other of black
granite, which are said
to have been brought from
Mecca by Jiait Bey, and
to bear impressions of the
feet of the prophet. One of
them is covered with a
wooden canopy, and the
other with a bronze dome.
The mosque also contains
a tinely carved knrsi for the
