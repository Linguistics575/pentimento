S STEAMBOATS.

between the warmth of Egypt and the colder climate of N. Europe.
The vessels of the principal lines are all nearly on a par with
regard to comfort and speed, many of them being large and hand-.

somely fitted up, while others are inferior.

The Ftttsrf'Lnss, cabins and berths are always well furnished; those
'f the StgcuxD CLASS. though less showy, are tulerubly comfortable, and
are often patrunised by gentlemen travelling alone. In autumn and
winter the vessels hound for Alexandria, and in spring these returning
westwards, are apt to be crowded.

The Fooo, which is included in the first-class fare and usually in
the second ulsn, is always abundant and of good quality. Passengers
begin the Jay by ordering a cup of eulfee at 7 " 8 o'eloek; at o or lil
a déjeuner l la fourcheiie nf three courses is served; lunch 01- tiftin is
a similar repast at 12 m- i; and at 5 or 6 there is a very ample dinner,
after which tea is generally provided. Many travellers prefer the cookery
on board the French and Austrian steamers as being lighter and better
suited to the climate than that of the English vessels. Passengers who
are prewnted by sickness from partaking of the regular repeats are

supplied with lemonade and other refreshments gratis.

The yi'rr:wattrrs FEE, which the passenger pays at the end of the
voyage, is generally from I/2 fr. to 1fr. per day; but mere is expected
if unusual trouble has been given.

The BATIIS provided for the use of passengers in the English and
some of the other vessels may be used without extra charge1 but the
attendant expects a fee. at the end of the voyage.
