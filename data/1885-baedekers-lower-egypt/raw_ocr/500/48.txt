The EGYPTIAN POSTAL 815113.11 is admirably organised in all the
principal towns, arid now also in many smaller ones. The ofileials,
who are very civil, are often Italians. The addresses ofletters des-
tined for Egypt should always be written very distinetly(partieularly
the, initial letters), and they had better be directed to the hotel at
which the traveller intends to stay, or to the consulate. Registered
letters are not delivered to the person whose address they bear
unless he gets a resident to testify to his identity. The forwarding
of letters up the Nile or elsewhere in the interior may be entrusted
to the landlord of the hotel. The General Post Oftiee for the whole
of Egypt is at Alexandria. Postage-stamps, bearing a Sphinx and
:1 pyramid, are issued at 5, 10 and 20 paras, and at 1, 2, 21/2 and
5 tariff piastres. There are letter-boxes in the streets and at the
hotels of the principal towns. Egypt is now a member of the Postal
Union, and the postage for letters within Egypt and to other coun-
tries in the union is 1 piastre tariff for every 50 grammes (11/207..],
and for book-paekets 10 paras for the same weight. Post-cards cost
20 paras. Parcels not exceeding 61/2 lbs. in weight may be sent to
the countries of the union for 11 piastres tariff. Posit-ofthe orders,
see p. 3.

The EGYPTIAN TELEGRAPH SYSTEM, the various lines of which
are about 3750 English miles in length, extends northwards as far
as Palestine, and southwards along the Nile toliltartim, a town at
the eoufhrenee of the Blue and White Nile, whence a line diverges
to Kassala, and another by Kordofzin to Ihir-lhir (comp. Map,
p. 30). All the larger towns in theDelta have telegraph-offleos,
and even the Faytun is inehtded in the system. Telegrams to Ale-
xandria, ihtirls, lsma'iiiya, Port Sa'id, and Finer, may he sent in
English, r'roneh, or Italian, hut Arabic must be used for messages
to all the smaller stations. Within Ihtypt the 'he gyptiau telegraph
must be. used (5 piastres tariff per 10 yordsl, but telegrams to

Europe should be sent by the English wires, via Malta, and eer-
tainly not by the Egyptian,vih Constantinople, a provokingly di-
latory mute. The following is the tarifT of the English telegraph:
