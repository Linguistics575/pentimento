masters themselves, who exact payment of 1-2 piastres per week from
each pupil. There are in all about 280 schools of this kind at Cairo, pre-
sided over by 290 teachers, and attended by 8000 pupils; at Old Cairo
there are 'N schools with 30 masters and 909 boys; and at Bdytk il
schools with I?., masters and 1320 boys. - The 11 higher government
schools are attended by 1180 pupils, while the foreign settlers support
57 schools with 2.'g7 teachers and 4310 pupils.

In walking through the bazaars (see below) and other streets,
the traveller will be interested in observing how industriously and
skilfully most of the artizans work with their very primitive tools.
The Carpenters (nagy/ir), for example, seem to ply their craft with
very tolerable success, without bench, vice, rule, or drill. In
order to steady the piece of wood on which they are working they
make use of the weight of their bodies, and sometimes of their
teeth and their toes. For a rule they substitute a piece of string
or a palm-twig, and for boring holes they use an iron spike
imbedded in a circular piece. of wood, which they turn by means
of an instrument resembling a fiddle-bow o. (2:37). Their principal
tool consists of a small axe, whioh serves many different purposes.
A number of other primitive tools are described at pp. 256, 257.
- After the closing of the shops in the evening it is customary
for the porters OI? watchmen to place their beds (sertr) of palm-
twigs outside the entrances, where they spend the night, thus
presenting a very curious and characteristic phase of Egyptian
out-of-door life.

The Bazaarsi of Cairo (comp. p. 23), though inferior to those
ofDamaseus and Constantinople, present to the European traveller
so many novel features, and so many interesting traits of Oriental
character, that he should endeavour to pay them repeated visits,
in order to become acquainted with their peculiarities.

Most of the bazaars consist of narrow, and often dirty, lanes,
generally covered over with an awning to shade them from the sun,
and flanked with rooms of various sizes, open towards the street,
and about 3 ft. above the level of the ground (comp. p. 'Yi).
These lanes usually enclose a massive building of considerable size
(khan), consisting of two stories, and containing an inner court,
around which are grouped a number of magazines for goods. Some
of the older of these buildings, particularly those in the Gameliyeh
o. 257) and the Khan el-Khalili (p. 255), are architecturally iu-
teresting, and possess handsome musl1rebiyclrs. A considerable
number of these khins form separate quarters of the city (ly"sra),
which were formerly closed by massive, iron-mounted gates, still
in some cases preserved; and they were carefully guarded at night
by watchmen appointed for the purpose. No one was permitted to

+ Baztir' is prnperly speaking a Persian word, the Arabic equivalent
for Which is sails. The magazines of the wholesale merchants, with their
large courts, are called wakkdleh, which the Franks have corrupted to
Uccalch, Occal, or Okella (pp. 257, 279). _
