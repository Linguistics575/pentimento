of Cairo. MA'11AllA. 4. Route. 403

Pyramid (comp. p. 159), the lower slopes rising at an angle of 5to M',
while the sides of the apex form an angle of 42° 59'. The whole pyramid
was probably originally intended to have the same slope as the apex (as
the sides of the neighbouring pyramid rise at an angle of 43° 36'), but
the lower part was never completed. This pyramid is 206ye yds. square
and 321 ft. in height. The interior was explored so early as the year
1660 by Mr. Melton, an English traveller. In 1860 M. Le Brun found a
small chamber in the interior. No clue to the name of the builder has
been discovered. On the extreme S. side of the plateau rises abriek
pyramid, 99 ft. in height, marking the S. extremity of the vast Necro-
polis of Memphis, Which extends down to Abit Rottsh (p. 370), towards
the N,, a distance of 23 )1. - From Dahshiir to the Pyramid of 3fi3dthtl,
and to the Fayiim, see R. f).

Quarries of Tara and Baths of Helwén.

RAILWAY to (14 M.) I.felwin in 3Ia-1hr. (fares tt pinstres IO, 7 piastres 20,
k piastres 20 paras). The trains, of' which there are four daily, start
from the new station in the Place Néhémet Ali, Another train starts
from the Central Station, passes the 'Abbtstyeh and the Cartridge Factory,
joins the first-mentioned line at Basiittn, and reaches I.lelwiin in Ir/s hr.

The railway to Helwén, which was constructed mainly for the
purpose of connecting the great military establishments at Tura
with the Citadel, runs from the Place Méhémet Ali, in a S.
direction. It skirts the base of the Mokattam, 011 the slopes of
Which are the interesting ruins of a mosque, and traverses the
burial-ground of the Mamelukes o. 327). To the right lies the
oldest part of Cairo, with the Mosque of Tultn (p. 205). On
the same side we next observe the Necropolis of Imim Shafeq
(p. 327), beyond Which is the valley of the Nile, with the various
groups of pyramids rising above it (p. 404).

Before reaching (4 M.) Basdtin. a village situated in one of the
angles of a triangular piece of arable land which extends a con-.
siderable way into the desert, we perceive the Jewish burial-ground
0n the left, and, farther on, the broad Widi et-Tih (p. 339), which
separates the Mokattam range from the Gebel Tura. Traversing a
tract of desert sand, the line approaches the Nile, on which lies the
village of Tara. A little to the right are the large military estab-
lishments and gunpowder mills. On the hill stand the ruins of
an old fort.

91/2 M. Ma'sara, a village on the Nile, is noted for the slabs of
stone obtained in the neighbourhood, known as 'palattes', and used
for paving purposes in almost every house of the better class in
Egypt. From either Tum or Ma‘sara we may visit the Quarries of
Tara (p. 405), Which yielded material for the construction of the
ancient temples, and are still worked. Their entrances in the rocks
are visible from the railway. The ride thither occupies 1/2hr., from
I.lelwtm 11/3 hr. It is advisable to bring good donkeys from Cairo,
as the choice at Helwén is very limited.

Beyond stat. Ma'sara the line skirts the slopes of the Gebel Tara,
and after ascending a considerable incline reaches the plateau on
Which the Baths of IJelwin are situated.
