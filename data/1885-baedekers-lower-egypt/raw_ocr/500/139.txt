becomes very predominant: i. e., a number of symbols are used to
stand for the first letter only of the word they represent. Thus the

syllabie symbol ij) ser (ythe prince’) is used for the letter 8 alone;

€23 nehem (‘the lotus-bud') for n alone; and so on.

The frames within which the groups of hieroglyphies are 011-
closed CCD are termed 'eartouehes'. Where they occur, the in-
scription generally records the names of kings, and occasionally,
butvery rarely, those ofgods. Above them usually stands the group

nab taui, 'sovereign of both lands', or =7'' f?, neli klut-u,

‘lord of the diadems’.

When the name of a king is to be deeiphered, the alphabetical
signs must first be noted, and then the syllabie symbols. The fol-

but it is to be read KM-f-ro, or Khafra, as the syllable ra, where-
ever it occurs in the name of a king, is always placed first without
regard to its proper place in the structure of the word. This was
done out of respect for the holy name of Re, the god of the sun,
to which the Egyptians thus piouslygave precedence. On the same
principle the name of the builder of the Third Pyramid, CD CO,

Menkera.- Several celebrated kings: 'of the 18th Dynasty are termed
