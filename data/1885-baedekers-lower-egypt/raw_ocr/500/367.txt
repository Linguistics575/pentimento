inclining to the right,1eads to the neeropolis known as Indus
Shafe 1 (see below), with the burial- -1110sq11e of the Viceroy al family,
which, however, presents no great attraetion.Riders may easily
make this short digression (see below).

Between this point and the base of the Mohattam towards the
E., and extending for some distance up the steep slopes. of the
hills, lies an extensive burial-ground, with several conspicuous,
but very dilapidated mausolea, known as the -

Tombs of the iriirefii"iri', which approach close to the city.
Like the so-called Tombs of the Khalifs (p. 282) their history is
obscure, the names of the builders being unknown, and 110 in-
seriptions having been preserved. The ruins of these monuments,
however, still bear traces of great artistic merit, and several of the
minarets in particular are exceedingly beautiful.

In a somewhat detached position, a little way in the direction
of the hills, we observe the ruined dome and lantern mentioned at
p. 177. Close to the town, in the midst of a group of other tombs,
rises the ruins of a mausoleum which once had a double dome.
Inside the building are walls arranged in the form of a fan for the
support of the outer dome, which has fallen in.

The whole of this region is still used as a Muslim burial-ground,
and in some cases the ancient mausolea have been converted into
family burial-places.

The gate by which we re-enter the town is the Bit?) el-Kart/th
(P1. G, '2). If we quit the main street by the second side-street to
the left, we pass through the street El-rAbr et-Tawil, and in about
10 min. reach the sw. and oldest part of Cairo, containing the
venerable Gama" ibn Tultm o. 265), which may now be visited if
time permits.

The road to the viceroyal burial-mosque in the necropolis of
Imim Shaferi passes the old mosque of Aht1 Su%d mentioned above,
descends the hill at the bifurcation of the road, and leads to a group
of dome-bnildings nearly 1M. distant, among which the impos-
ing Outline of the tomb of Inu‘tm Shafc'i, of ahluislr-grey colour, is
most conspicuous. Near it is the Wssh el-Bésha, or burial-mosque
of the family of the Khedive.

To the left of the entrance is a sebil. On each side of the
large arcade leading to the mosque are apartments for the acceni-
modation of the women who come to pray at the tombs. At the
end of this covered passage, 011 the left, is a small open space, in
which, opposite to IIS, is a small door leading to the entrance of the
mosque. [Nearer us is another door 011 the left: leaIding to the mauso-
leum of a wife of ex-Khedive Isma no As usual 111 all the mosques,
the visitor on entering must put on slippers " linen socks over his
boots.(Balrshisl1 for One person 2, and to the guide 3 piastres
