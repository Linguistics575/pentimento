Dragoman. PENINSULA OF SINAI. 10. Route. 471

remedied, the less likelihood will there be of subsequent annoyance.
The traveller is particularly cautioned against trusting to the promises of
Orientals.

The cost of thejouruey for a party of 3-1 persons, including, camels,
tents, accommodation in the monastery of 3It. Sinai (and at the Hotel at
Suez if necessary), provisions (exclusive of spirits), the dragoman's fee,
and all gratuities payable to attendants, will amount to 40-50 fr. a day
for each person, according to the requirements of the party, and the
demand for camels. The expense is proportionally less fur a large
party, but in this case, delays and differences of opinion are more likely
to uceur.

The following CONTRACT will probably meet the requirements of most
travellers.

Contract. Mr. N. and his travelling companions on the one hand, and
the Draguman Y. on the other, have mutually entered into the fulluwing
contract: -

(1) The Dragornan Y. binds himself to conduct Mr. X. and his party
safely through Arabia Petrtea to the Monastery of Sinai, and back, by
the following rmlte . . . (naming the principal points), at a charge of

.. shillings per day. For the three days, during which the camels are
travelling from Cairo to Suez the Dragoman shall receive nne-thirtl only
of the stipulated daily charge. The Dragoman Y. undertakes to await at
Suez the arrival of the, travellers, in perfect order, for starting, on the
. . . day of the month of . .. The day of starting front Suez shall be
deemed the t'irst complete travelling day. Fur each day after the first
twenty days, reckoned from the starting of the camels, and also for days
of rest, the right to appointwlsich is reserved to Mr. N., the daily charge
shall he reduced to . . . for each Person.

(It is advisable to lay down the whole route very precisely, mention-
ing also the valleys which have to be traversed, but the stages must of
course depend en the situation (if the springs. We may again mention
here that the Orientals, and the Beduius in particular, attach no value
whatever to their time, so that little or no cumpensatiun need be made
for delays.)

(2] The whole travelling expenses of the party, for the journey by land
and by water, camels, boats, etc.; for food, for tents, or for accumula-
dation at hotels (to he elmsen hy Mr. X.) in case of any stay at Suez; for
lights, service, guides, ballishish to all persons whatsoever, and parti-
cularly the fees for escorting the party paid to the Beduins whose terri-
tory is traversed, shall be defrayed exclusively by the Dragumau Y., who
shall also hear all outlay fur the stay in the Monastery, including the
usual contributions to the monks. Each traveller shall be entitled,
without extra charge, to 1/2-1 bottle of wine per day, but Mr. N. shall
provide any spirituous liquors required by the party. (Or the party may
prefer to purchase their own wine, as well as spirits, in which ease the
Dragoman Y. shall he required tn carry it free of expense. A few bottles
of good claret or Burgundy, and of Cognac, should also be taken by
each traveller to mix with the water, which is often unpalatable, or to
be used in case of illness.)

(3) The Dragoman Y. shall provide a good cook, and a p1ffieient
number of servants, and shall take care that they are always polite and
ubliging to Mr. N. and his party, and that they are quiet at night so as
not to prevent the travellers from sleeping, and he shall also maintain
order among the camel drivers, as well as the other attendants. The
Dragoman Y. also undertakes to be himself at all times ubliging to Mr.
N. and his party (p. 13), and to comply With all their wishes so far as
possible.

(It is customary for the attendants to ask a halgshish fer every
trifling service, but no attention should be paid to their demands. An-
other bad habit oftheirs, to be carefully provided against, is that of tying
up their beasts too close to the tents, and of chattering beside them balf
