HISTORY. 1 H7

Ibrahim Pasha, Moltammed rAli’s adopted son, had al-.
ready taken the reins of government, in consequence of
Molym1merl's incapacity, in January 1848, but he died in
November of the same year, and before his adoptive father.

"Abbks Pasha, a son of Tustsn Pasha and grandson of
Mohammed 'Ali, has generally been described by Europeans
as a brutal, vicious, and rapacious prince. This, however,
would seem to be a somewhat distorted view of' his character,
arising from the fact that he had inherited from his Arab
mother a certain amount of ferocity and even cruelty, coupled
with the dislike of a true son of the desert for European in-
novations. He, however, maintained the strictest discipline
among his offieials, and the public security in Egypt was
never greater than during his reign. His death is attributed
to assassination.

Sa’id Pasha, his successor, was Mohammed rAli's third
son. Thanks to his enlightened government and his taste
for European civilisation, Egypt made considerable progress
during his reign, although her finanees were far from being
in a satisfactory condition. He equalised the incidence of
taxation, abolished monopolies, improved the canals, com-
pleted the railways from Cairo to Alexandria and to Suez,
and, above an, zealously supported the scheme of M. Fer-
dinand de Lesseps for constructing a canal through the Isth-
mus of Suez, which was opened in 1869 under his successor.
During the Crimean war he was obliged to send an auxiliary
army and considerable sums of money to the aid of the
Porte. He died on 18th Jan. 1863, and was succeeded by
his nephew h--

Ismi"il Pasha, the second son of Ibrahim Pasha, who was
born on 31st Dee. 1830. He had received the greater part
of his education in France and had there acquired the strong
preference for European institutions which characterised
him tl1roughout his reign. Unfortunately, however, he com-
bined with this enlightenment a profound egotism and a
tendency to duplicity and cunning, which in the end, in
spite of his natural talents, proved his ruin. Most of his
innovations, such as the foundation ofmanufactories and the
construction of canals, railways, bridges, and telegraphs,
were planned mainly in his own interest, though of course
the country shared in the advantage, while even in the es-
tablishment of schools, the reorganisation of the system of
justice (p. (O, and the like, he acted rather with an eye
to produce an impression in Europe than from real concern
for the needs of his subjects. As time went on he succeeded
in appropriating for his own use about one-fifth of the cul-
tivable land of Egypt. In 1806, in consideration of a large
