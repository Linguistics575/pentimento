sumption of food was so large that the hospital employed several officials
for the sole purpose of buying provisions and keeping accounts. Besides
these offieialg there were a number of others, whose duty it was to collect
the various revenues set apart for the support of the institution. In the
tomb- -mosq11e the Koriiu and the religious traditions connected with it
were publicly taught, the teachers and the pupils both being supported
by government. A large adjacent apartment contained the library, which
was well stocked with exegetical treatises on the Koran, books of tradi-
tions, grammars, and mei1iea1,theologieal,legal, and literary works, and
was kept in good order by a librarian and five assistants. The school-
building contained four Jeeturo-rooms for the teachers of the four schools
of Mohammedanism (p. 149); and there was also a school for children,
where sixty orphans were maintained and educated gratuitously.

In the tomb- chamber are still preserved articles of dress which once
belonged to Fttlatln, and are populary supposed to possess miraculous
virtues. Thus, the shawl ('immeh) of his turban is supposed to cure
headaches, and one of his heavy kaftfms, wrapped round the body of the
patient for 24 hours, is said to be an infallible remedy for ague. This
superstitious belief in the healing powers of the snltan's clothing is
probably due to the fact that he devoted much attention to medicine.

The Portal (Pl.1; Nos.1- 8 are the only parts of the building
110w preserved; the other numbers on the plan show the former
arrangements), the most interesting part of the whole edifice, is
constructed of black and white marble, and is of imposing height.
The doors still show traces of their former covering of bronze. The
ceiling of the entrance, with its open beams, is also very effective.

The corridors, most of which are vaulted in the Gothic style,
appear to some extent to have lost their original regularity in
consequence of their restoration by Seyyid tyr-Habit and Ahmed
Pasha Taher during the present century.

The second iloor (Pl. 4) on the right leads to the Vestibule
(Pl. 5) of the Tomb of 'tlattn, now used as an offiee by the ad-
ministrators of the Wald. The tomb itself contains a fine gran.ite
column, and the lower parts of the walls are covered with mosaics
in marble. The Bible (prayer-reoess), with its mosaics, its beautiful
dwarf-arcades, and its shell-shaped ornamentation, is also worthy
of notice. The disposition of the pairs of windows resembles that
which occurs in Christian churches of the Romanesque period.
The stucco traeery with which the windows are filled should also be
inspected.

Adjacent to the Mfuistan is the *Tomb of Sultan Mohammad
en-Nasir ibn 1.raladn (1293-13311; Pl. 56), dating from 698 of
the Hegira.

In 1293 Mohmmned en- -Nd_st'r ibn Kaladn, son of the Kalattn above
mentioned, When only nine 'years of age, succeeded his elder brother
Khalil, who is better known as El- ishraf (p. 255). At the beginning of
his reign sanguinary feuds broke out between Kethoga, his "vtfiiii,iiil''snT,
and Shujai, his viziev. In Dee.12%, Ketboga, having got rid of his
antagonist, usurped the seeptre, but two years later was dethroned by
the discontented emirs, and was succeeded by Lajin, son- -in-law of Bebars,
and once a slave of (i'aiiiiin,' who is said to have been a German by birth,
and to have been brought to Egypt when ten years old.Laj1n having
been assassinated in Jan.1299 Nasir, who had meanwhile resided at
Korak, a Syrian fortress to the k of the Dead Sea, was recalled. Although
he had gained several victories over the i1Tniiiiln'i/, who were 'tiiitii'illi,1
