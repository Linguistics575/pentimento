wards proceed to the sight by the Route " Jleks CPI. A, ll, (O,
which skirts the coast. A little to the left of the road is the new
Ifippodrorue, the Ta0e-00Jrse of Alexandria, sometimes known as
the Gabari (see above). To the W. of it is an old palace with a
mosque, recently converted into a Onurunline CPI. i2) or lazzaretto.
In the friable limestone of the vvaoast-lrills are a umuhcr of tomb-
chamhers, the ceilings of whieh are borne by pillars of the rock
left for the purpose; but most of them have been destroyed by the
inroads ot' the sea, and are now covered up. Those chambers, which
contain nothing interesting, have been styled the Baths of Cleo-
patm. Farther on, to the left of the road, is the eirtteae of Sa’id
Pasha (p. 203), and to the right, close to the sea, is the Bab el-
'Arab (p. 203).

At Meks wore established the works of Messrs Crreentleld& 00.,
an English iirm which contracted for the construction of the im-
posing new Barbour Works of Alexandria. These eonsist, in the
tirst place, of an outer breakwater, beginning near the W. and of
the island of Pharos U155 et-Tin, I" 910), and extending to the
S'.W. towards Aleks, forming an obtuse angle, and nearly 2 M. in
length, This huge barrier, completed in Dee. 1873, is formed "
a foundation of 26,000 solid masses ofinasonry, each 20 tons in
werght, faced an the side next the sea with natural bloeks, each
15-25 ttwt. in weight. The horizontal surface is 19ft. in width,
and, atlow tide, to ft. above the level of the water. The admirably
sheltered harbour thus formed is nearly 1800 acres in area. and
20-00 ft. in depth. A second pier, or Mole, nearly 1000 yds. in
length, and connected by lines of rails with the 01d railway-
station, protects the inner harbour, which is about 475 acres in
area and on an average 27 it. deep. From the beginning of this
pier (near Gabari, at the SW. extremity of the town] a series of
new quays extends along the whole E. side of the old harbour to
the Arsenal, whereby about 75 acres of very valuable land have
been reclaimed. The whole length of the berthage thus obtained
for large vessels, including thei “de 0fthe Molo, extends to nearly
231. No fewer than 30,000 arti cial blocks, weighing 20 tons
each, and 2 million tons of natural blocks of stone, manufactured
and quarried respectively at Meks, were used in the construction
of the l1arbour-works.

To the E. of Meks, and to the S. of the road, lies the extensive
