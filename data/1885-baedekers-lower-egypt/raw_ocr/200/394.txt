said to have erected them for their wives. These works are un-
questionahly the most remarkable in all Egypt, whether in respect
of the size of the buildings and their cost, or the skill ofthe artists.
And it is thought that the architects deserve even more admiration
than the kings who defrayed the cost; for the former contributed to
the completion of the work by mental power and praises orthy exer-
tion , but the latter only by tho wealth they had inherited and the
labour of others Neither the natives7 however, nor the historians
at all agree in their accounts of the pyramids. For some maintain
that they were built by these three kings, and others that they were
built by different persons'.

Strubo's account is remarkably graphic and concise: - ur you
go l'orty stadia from the city (of Memphis), you come to a hill on
whieh stand many pyramids, the burial-plaees of kings. Three are
particularly remarkable, and two of these are even rcekonod among
the seven wonders. They are square in form and a stadium in height,
and this height is only slightly greater than the length of each
side. One pyramid, too, is a little larger than the other. A
moderate distance up one of its sides, this pyramid has a stone
“hieh can be taken out When it is removed, an oblique passage
within leads to the tomb. These pyramids are near each other in
the same open space; and a little higher up the hill is the third,
mueh smaller than these two, but erected in a much more costly
style. For, from its foundation nearly up to the middle, it eonsists
ul'a blank stone, of which mortars are also made, and which is
hrmight from a long distance, namely from the mountains o0lthio-
pin. Owing to its hardness and the tlitTumlty of working it, the
building is rendered expensive”.

Strahe then speaks of the fossils resembling Icutils, mentioned
at p. 330, but does not share the view current at that period
that they were the petritied remains of the workmeu’s food. With
regard to 1lhodopis, who is mentioned at p. 356, he tells the
following; tradition , resembling the tale of the modern C)inderella.
While lthodopis was bathing, an eagle carried off one ot her shoes,
carried it to Memphis, and dropped it into the lap of the king, who
was then sitting on the judgment seat. The king, admiring the
neatness ol' the shoe, and surprised at tho strangeness of the occur-
rence. sent out messengers to search for the owner of the shoe. She
w _ found at Naukmtis and brought to the king, who made her his
w e, am] on her death erected the third pyramid to her memory.

Pliny speaks somewhat sliglrtingly oi' the Pyramids: _ 'We
lullat also in p ng mention the Pyramids in this same Egypt, an
idle and foolish tlisplay hy the kings of their wealth; and indeed,
as most permxm maintain, they had no other object in erorstingthern
than to xloyi '0 their successors, and rival: plotting against them,
" money, or perhaps for the puryose of kccpiug the people engaged.
The vanity urthcsc people in this matter was very great'.
