detached columns, which is not the ease with the religious o,t1itlees,

The interiors of the mosques, on the other hand, are freely
embellished with nolumus, the court being usually bordered hy a

ninhe (lcibla).

Cain) presents no example of a distinct Arabian order of eelumn,
and hardly a single Arabian capital, those actually executed by Arabs
(such as those adjoining the yxayer-recess " the mosques) being
imperfectly developedY and copied from Byzantine and Ptolernasan
models. The form of capital which seems peculiar to Cairo is very
simple and is also used as a base. Proceeding from the four corners
of the abacus in curved lines are four surfaces which unite below
with the ligature of the round or octagonal column. The numerous
columns which adorn the mosques and private houses originally
belonged, almost without exception, to liomau or Ptoicmman struc-
tures, and sometimes to Christian churches. The 1fohammedans
did not, however, employ columns belonging to the ancient Egyptian
temples unless they had already been remodelled and used in Greek
or Roman structures. Thus the Roman pedestals with remains of
hieroglyphics occasionally seen in the mosques must originally have
belonged to lhrypt'ran tcmples, The architects of the mosques e01-
lectcd the columns they required for their purpose with little regard
to their dimensions. If they were too short, a pedestal, or a remrs~
ed capital was placed beneath them , regardless of the order to
which it bcionged. Ionic and Corinthian columns are mingled pro-
miseuously, and a certain degree of uniformity in the architecture
is only observed When the abacus is reached. On this last lies a
second abacus of sycamore wood secured by a wooden bar, {mm
which lamps are frequently suspended.

The arches of the Arcades are almost invariably pointed, being
at tirst round, while, their sides go off at a tangent near the top; or
they gradually assume the keel-shape, being slightly curved inwards
below in the shape ofa horseshoe. There ate also other forms which
approach still more nearly to the Gothic pointed arch; and there
seems little doubt that this form, so early and so generally employed
at Cairo, Was exported thence to Sicily, and hccalue tho type which
afterwards extended to Northern Europe Beyond this rosemhlanm
in the form of the arch, however, and in some of the details of
the windows, the, pointed style possesses nothing in common with
the Arabian. The Gothic gateway of marble between the mosques
of l,ialtst5rt and lâ€˜arhukiych (p. 278) in the Derh el-hiWisin must,
therefore, he regarded as a work executed under European in-
fluPrtee. The popular account of it is that it Was brought from
some. island.

The arcades of the, mosques and other spacious halls are covered
with a Mt Ceiling of open-work, of almost uniform height. The
