next valleys on the right are the dez's cd-Dér, Neuron, Et- Tan,
and AIM? flerrtry0t; and opposite the latter opens' the Wadi K0537, a
valley of greater extent. A little before, reaching the oasis, we pass
a rack called the llégi el-Khutmtin, which is entirely covered with
small stones. Prof. Palmer was the tirst traveller who was told
by the Beduius that this reek was the one which yielded water
when struck by Moses.

The plants of the desert now occur more frequently, and are of
more vigorous growth; bushes of tamarisk, the uehh, the seyil, and
palm-tras, make their appearance, and the scene is enlivened by
the notes of birds of grey and dark plumage. We now quit the
desert, and with feelings of unmitigated delight, after a hot jour-
ney of more than She. in the Wadi Firén, we enter the Oasis of
FiriU1, the 'Pearl of Siuai', and by far the most fertile tract in the
whole peninsula, We first ‘reeeh the dale ot' 12-llesweh, a few
hundred paces only in length, watered by an inexhaustible brook
which is suddenly swallowed up by the earth here, after having
converted the whole of the valley above this point into a luxuriant
garden in the midst of the desert. The gardens are watered by
means of ShidCds or buckets; the dates grown here are celebrated.
Every tree has its proprietor, who obtains the whole of its produce,
even when he lives at a distance, his property being protected by
the honest Beduins of the oasis and the inmates of the monastery.
On the road-side, and on the left slope of the valley, ere Beduin
huts, gardens, and the ruins of stone houses, dating from the time
of the ancient Ftrin. In 1/4 hr. more we reach a second small
group of palms, and for a few minutes we obtain a view of the W.
side of Mount Serhil. In 20 min. more we reach a \xider part of' the
valley, in which the rocky and isolated hill of El-Mchurret rises to
eheight of about 100 ft., hearing units summit the traces of an
early Christian monastery and church. Exemtly opposite the ruin
of the monastery the traveller should notiee a very eminus geol0-
gieel formation, consisting of a vein of green diorite in i1es'h-ry01-
cured porphyry, which is in its turn imbeddedin green miea-slat0.
The largest fragment of the ruins, called Irererat et-Netrtr, stands
on the summit of the hill which the Beduins regard as the spot
where Moses prayed during the battle with the Amalekites Jso-
dus, xvii. 10), and at its base the relics of a large church are still
traceable. Fragments of columns and ornaments, which once he-
longed to it, are to be found built into the walls of the houses.
The Wiilis Ejelch and 'Aley0t, valleys diverging here, are watered
in winter by streams from the mountains which are sometimes
covered with snow. This pietnresque spot is a favourite halting-
plaee with the Beduins owing to the facilities tor watering the
camels. The best camping-ground is alittle to the E. of the en-
trance to the Wadi 'Aleyit, and in such a position as to comment}
a view of the pimmcled mmmit of Mt. Serbel o, 497).
