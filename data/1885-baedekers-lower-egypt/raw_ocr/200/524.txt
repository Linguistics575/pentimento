Excl‘nsmxs. A whole day is required for a visit to the Pyramid
of Ihnrriruh and the Labyrinth (horse 10, donkey 5 fl). The route
leads at first for 3/4hr. along the bank of the Uahr Ytssuf. The first
village of any importance is Lhtfeh. ()ur path traverses well cn1<
tivated land with numerous water-wheels. The com and cotton
fields are shaded by numerous Sycamores, lebbeks, palms, and
other trees. About 1/2 hr. from IJhifeh, and beyond two smaller
villages, we reach a bridge of ancient bxick masonry. Traversing
the slightly undulating tract a little farther, we reach the Balm
Beta Jlft C'river without water"), also called el-Butx, a deep eharr-
nel, extending in a wide Gun and terminating near the N.It. end
of the Birket el-J.iurrhr (p. 46:3). la winter the water, which triek-
les down from itslofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the
bottom of the channel grow reeds and tamarisks, The S. hank
rises at places nearly perpendicularly to aheight of 20 ft., so that
the sequence of the strata of the soil is distinctly observable. We
now ascend the plateau (.the highest in the province, 88 ft. above
the sea level] on which lies Hawiret el-Ka§ab or Ihtur0ret el-.
Mult'tu, a considerable village, with a mosque (reached in Wahr.
from Mediuet el-Fayilr11). The traveller may apply to the Shékh-el-
BeledWrefeet " the village) for a guide to the pyramid oflla“ ira.
" the water is high, and the canals have to be avoided, We have
to make a circuit of nearly 2 hrs. to the Labyrinth, but by riding
through the water, where necessary, it may be reached in 3/4 hour.

The longer route is preferable, as it passes several relics of
antiquity. A little beyond the village rises the bridge of F"arusltir
eb-Ayoni, the ten buttresses of which rest on a foundation of mas-
sive stone. We continue to ride along an ancient embankment, and
thus reach the Kataganta structure, which consists of a tarmac of
six carefully jointed steps of large and well-hewu blocks, but bears
no inscription Whatever. We cross the Bahr el- Wardsfn, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Hawirah, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Ruhr es31ele/ck or Balm es/t-sSherlsi,
Lo. river nf the East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
whieh, according to Lepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (see be-
low). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to ascend at nnce the Pyramid of Ba-
wtsra. This consists of unhurnt bricks ofNile mud mixed with straw
(romp. p. 37J), and, when its sides were porl'eet, covered an area
ol' upwards of' Ill; sq. yards. It has been ascertained that the tut-
nhms ol' the struutnre .1 natural mass ut'roeh, b'0 It in height. The
