I/elwr"sn, m) artificial oasis in the desert, 3 M, from the Nile,
belongs to the Egyptian government, and is placed under the super-
intendence of M. Grund-Bey, who is represented at the place itself
by M. Onsy. The medical inspector is Dr. Engel, a German. In
spite of the disadvantages of its situation, which necessitate the
bringing from a distance of drinking water, provisions, and even
garden mould, Heiwim has hitherto had a very prosperous existence,
especially since it came into the hands of the government in 1880.
It still, however, presents a dull and new aypearance, and the
vegetation around is still very scanty Visitors who have come to
Egypt for their health are strongly recommended not to remain in
Cairo, but either to go on at once to Upper Egypt or to pass the
“inter in I.refwiu, where, besides the baths, they enjoy the advaut-
ages ofperfeet quiet and a remarkably pure and dustlcss atmosphere
(comp. p. 67].

The sulphur springs, which “ere also probably used in ancient
times, resemble those of Aix in Savoy in their ingredients. In 187 l
they were utilised for salutary purposes by Dr. Iteil, by order
of Khedive Isma'il. The principal springs are covered in. The
bath-housc for Europeans contains fourteen cabinets, for warm and
tepid baths, shower-baths, and inhalation There is also a basin
containing water strongly impregnated with sulphur, 5-01/s ft.
(levy, and 1900 sq. yds, in area. The interior of the khedive's
bath-house may also be iuspentei

Near the sulphur springs, especially those situated farther to
theW., which are still uncovered, a quantity of Ir1nt splinters have
been found, the largest of which are now in the musmnm at 1mm h
(comp. p. 370). The banks of the Nile airord good wild-fowl shoot-
ing, but the desert game is shy and not easily reached.

The subterranean quarries ot' Mafgara and Tum, which are
still worked, yielded the stone used in the construction of thePyra-
mids. A visit should be paid to these vast caverns, if time permit.
The side thither from f.reiwin takes 11/: hr. ; candles and matches
should not be forgotten. The stone is transported to the bank of
the Nile by means of tramways, carts, camels, and mules.

These immense quarries are hardly less imposing than the Pyr-
amids themselves, for whichthey afforded material. TheArabs make
very poor miners, as they dread the darkness of shafts and pits,
They quarry the stone on the outside of the rocky slopes only7 while
the quarrymcn of the Pharaohs penetrated into the interior of the
mountain and excavated large chambers, tunnelling their way
until they came to serviceable stone, and leaving the inferior
untouched. The roofs of the roek-halls, whiuh are ot'diirerei1t sizes,
are supported by pillars of rock left standing for the purpose. A
few remains of hieroglyphics and coioured hasreliei's are still pre-
served in the quarries, bat they are of no historical value. Daring
