of a white cow impregnated by a moonbeam. In order to represent
Apis worthily, a ball had to be sought which possessed a black hide,
a white triangle on his forehead, alight spot on his

back in the form of M1 eagle, and under his tongue .

After his death tho representative of Apis was I
emhalmed and preserved in a sarcophagus of stone Ei

(p. 386), He was the symbol of the constantly 11¢
operative fashioning power of the deity, and is on
that account represented as the son of the moon,
which, though never changing, appears to re-
fashion itself every hour. The era of time named
after Apis was a lunar period, containing 309 mean
synodic months t Which almost exactly corre-
sponded with 25 Egyptian years.

Ra, the great god of Heliopolis (On) in Lower
Egypt, as the king of gods and wen, ranks next to
Ptah, and is, from the exoteric point of view, the
sun Who illumines the world with the light of his
eyes, and the awakener of life. He rises asachild,
under the name of Harmachis (Har-em-khuti), at
midday he is called ms, and at sunset he is re-

In rising Ra is born, and in setting he dies; but his life is
daily renewed by an act of self-procreation taking place daily in

goddess is frequently called the ruler of the nether regions, and is
represented with the head of a cow, or in the form of a cow, which
every morning gives birth to the young sun. Twelve human ilguros,
each bearing the orb of the sun or a star on his head, represent the
hours ofthe day and night. The animals specially sacred to Ba were
the hawk ', the Upper Egyptian light-colo urcd Mnevis bull, which also
belonged at a later period to Ammon Ra, and a specimen of which
had even before that time been kept in the temple of the sun at
Heliopolis; and, lastly, lions with light skins. The Phoenix, or bird
