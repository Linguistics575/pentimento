ISI IXUIIJJINGS OF THY. MOHAMMEDANS

Thi- Muslims also repent their mayors at the grated windows of
the mausolen of their saints {sltE/ih. ortreli; see p 152), behind
which is visible a eatafalque, covered with bright coloured carpets,
but by no means invariably containing the remains ofthe hoiyman.
These wcli's, or tombs of shtihhs, ovcur in every part of the coun-
try. being frequently built into the houses, and are easily reeognis-
ed try their cubic form and their domes. They are rarely more than
4-il yds. square, and are generally whitewashed. The interior is
often empty and infested with scorpions and vermin.

Every Gini has a court of considerable size, generally uncov-
ered. called the Fushu, or Salim et-C/Put in the centre of which is
the J/rirretrveh, or fountain for religious ahlntion, (hr the E. side

and the court there often runs a mushmbiyeh railing which sepa-
rates the holy plane of the Gémi' from the court.

prayer-niehe turned towards Mecca; (2) the Mumbur, or pulpit, to
the right ofthe ifibia, from which the K/iutib or Imam addresses the
faithful; (3) the kursi (pl. It'ertisi'), or reading-desk, on whirh the
lioriu {which is kept at other times in a cabinet of its own) lies
open during divine service; (i) the Dikkeh, a podium borne by col-
umns, and surrounded by a low railing, from which the Jlobulliyh
(assistants ol' the Khatib) repeat the words of the Koran, whieh is
read at the liihla, for the benefit of the people at a distance;
to) the various lamps and lanterns (Kindil aml [2271175) liy the
side of the tialm el-Chimy is another small court uith a basin ot'
water and other conveniences, which the faithful almost iuvarialr1y
