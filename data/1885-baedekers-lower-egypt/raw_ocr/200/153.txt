When Ra is termed the soul
of Osiris, the meaning is that
he renders visible the hidden
principle of light (Osiris).
When, on the other hand,
Osiris is regarded as emblem-

moisture, the most perfect
embodiment of which is the
godHapi, or the Nile, Typhon
and his seventy-two Mm-
panions represent the days of
drought. Like. the dead body

fruit-bearing earth, mourns over the loss of the fertilising power;
but this is for a short periurl only, for Horus soon vanpishes Ty-

scene of the operation of that principle, while Typhon represents
death, and Horus the resurrection, if we regard Osiris, as the
monuments so frequently do, as a pure and perfect being, the
principle ofthe good and the beautiful, in which case he receives the
surname of Un-Ne/kr, we recognise in Typhon the disuords with

to Osiris, but actually become Osiris. Osiris is always represented
with a human head. He either sits as a king on his throne, or ap-
pears in the form of a mummy. He always wields the scourge and
crook, and sometimes other emblems also. The crown of Upper
Egypt which he “ears on his head is usually garnished before and
behind with the ostrich feathers of truth. Beside him, even in
very ancient representations, stands a kind of thyrsus or entwined
