of Cairo. BARRAGE DU NIL. f Route. 407

mast be obtained from the minister of war through the travelier's
consulate.

The barrier, which consists of a huge hridge with lock-gates, built
across the the Nile at the S. extremity of the Delta, about 12 M.
below Cairo, dates from the time of the energetic Mahammed 'Ali
and was constructed from the plans of a French engineer named
3fonyet-Bey,

Fortiiieatious of considerable strength were constructed here by
Sa'm Pasha for the purpose of arresting the progress of any invad-
ing army, and storing munitions of war. The place was therefore
called Knl'at Sa'idfych (Sairs Castle]7 but is now known as 'iia-
nitir’ (pridges).

The object of the Barrage was to keep the water of the Nile at
the same level in all seasons, so that the necessity for irrigation
machinery throughout the district below it would havehecu entirely
superseded, while those fields to the S. of it whieh are on a level
with the reservoir would also hare boitetited. The Barrage was also
intended to remove the Mfikaltios of navigation below this point
during the three months when the Nile is at its lowest. During
that period the water is too shallow for large vessels, and even
small vessels are often impeded by shoals and shifting sandbanks;
and it “us therefore proposed that the whole of the communication
by water should then be kept up by means of large canals.

The first trial of the Barrage was unsuccessful; when the gates
were closed to retain the water, part of the work gave way and it
was hastily concluded that the whole undertaking Was a costly
failure. For the next twenty years the Barrage was nothing but an
impediment to the navigation, as vessels often take several hours
to cheat the passage of the locks, which is sometimes even attend-
ed with danger, and have to pay heavy duos. At the beginning of
1883, however, it was carefully tested by two English engineers,
who came to the conclusion that the Barrage might not be so wholly
untitted for its intended purpose as had been generally taken for
granted. As the Nile fell, they atyrording1ylowered the gates inch
by inch, and found that no untoward results ensued. On the contrary
the water at the Barrage only fell 10 inches while it fell 57 inches
atAssuirr, and the fellihiu were enabled to irrigate their flelds
without recourse to the expensive steam-pumping apparatus on
Which they had previously heen dependent. It would, however,
he cash to make a prophecy from the successful experiment ofa
single year, and the engineers who conducted it are of the opinion
that an expenditure of 20000N. would be necessary to make the
Barrage quite secure. As yet, also, no barrier has been constructed
for the Damietta branch of the Nile; Mnl for the complete success
of the scheme this, of course, would he essential. Comp. the map
