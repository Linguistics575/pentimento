As fei- as mm: the train follows the W, bank ofthe Rosetta branch
of the Nile, skirting the boundary between the Libyan desert and the
cultivated Delta of the Nile. The stations between Tell el-Biiriid and
Btslrily are NMS Ramadan Er?'avysh, Kafr deudi El~Wat-du‘n, and Et,
Jferuishi. The station at Bdig is nearly U/e ll. {mm the Hush, Car-
riages not always to be had.

The cultivated land becomes richer, and we pass villages,
groups of trees, and even tamarisks. The train reaches the broad
{osetttt arm of the Nile, crosses it by a long irun bridge [tine
view to the left), and eaters the station of (65 M.) Kafr ez-
Zaiyit [second station at which the express stops, 2 hrs. after
leaving Alexandria; halt of20mi11.; restaurant). The town, which
carries on a busy trade in grain, cotton , and the other products of
the Delta (p. 73], lies on the right bank of the river. Excutsion

TWe Delta in Winter. 'The fields are still wet at places, and straight
canals are seen in every direction, All the cereals grown in ancient times
still flourish here, and the slender palm still rears its fruit-ladeu crown
beside the less frequent sycamore, with its slender umbragcnus foliage.
The cotton-plants are successfully cultivated where the eoilis well irrigated,
and funn extensive plantations of uuderwotrd, bearing aprufusinu ofyel-
low, red, and white blossoms, which somewhat resemhle wild roses.
Vineyards are rare, but they sometimes occur in the northern part at
the Delta, the plants being trained on the trelliswork which we often
see represented in the paintings ot the ancient Egyptian tombs. The
water-wheels (stlsiyeh) are turned by 1puit'Moes and donkeys, and some-
times by camels m- by steam; and the water-pail (shidlif). though less
commnu than in Upper Egypt, is urreasiuaally plied by slightly eied men
and boys, The canals are flanked with eu1haalcments to protect the fields
from inundation, and the paths on these banks are enlivened with strings
nf camels, donkeys with their riders, and men, women, and children on
foot. From a distance the villages look like round, grey hillocks, full of
openings, and around them rise dovecots and palm-trees. On closer
examination we dtstiugntsh the iunri-huts, huddled together on rising
ground where they are safe (mm the inundation. Many ofthcse hamlets
are adorned with very handsome groups of palms, while the mirurrets
which overtop the larger villages and towns seem to point as devoutly

Opposite the station is an Inn kept by a Greek, which looks nut

Tanga, the handsome capital of the province of Gharbiyeh,
which lies between the Rosetta and Damietta arms of the File,
with a population estimated at 60,000 souls, possesses large public
buildings and an extensive palace of the Khedive, The bazaars
present a very busy scene at the time of the fairs (see below),

The Mosque of the Seyyid el-Bedawi, having been recently
restored, presentsahandsome appearance. Thelargc court contains
the basin for ablutions (pp. 147, 184).

Seyyid Ahmed el-Bedawi is probably the most popular saint in Egypt,
and the most frequently invoked. He is said to have been born in the
12th cent. at Fez, or according to others at Tunisl and to have settled
