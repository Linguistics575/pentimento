have been greator in ancient than in modern times; for, disregard-
ing the exaggerated calculation of Tluyoeritus, based on a more a8-
sumption, it appears to have numbered atleast 71/2 million souls in
the time of Josephus and the Emperor Nero. This number is quite
reasoirable.in itself, as it is estimated that the country could sup-
port 8-0 million inhabitants.

According to the culmination made by Amiei Boy in 1882 the
