HISTORY OF AltT. 163

 

more ancient and materially different period of development. At
the same time a careful inspection " the monuments of this period
will convince the observer that no farther development could be ()N-
pected afterwards to take place on the basis of a system so lifeless
and entirely mechanical. Shortly before the conquest oi' the country
by the Persians, however, a slight improvement in artistic taste
appears to have taken place. While the monuments of the enty-
second and following Dynasties are unattractive, being mere
reproductions of earlier woclrs, the ser1lptu1'es ot' the Twenty- ixth
Dynasty (such as the alabaster statue of Queen Ameniritis of the,
h'NV. Dynasty) exhibit a considerable degree of clegaucn and
retinement. But this revival was of brief duration. After the
establishment of the Ptolemaean dynasty the native art became
entirely extinct, tl1ougl1 for a time a semblance of life, was artiilei-
ally rusirrtaiiied. Political interests required. the restoration of the
temples, and nnmemus artists were employed for the pmpose; the
trad ional style continued tu be practised, and every branch of art
was liberally pauonised. The style ofthis period, however, had
well-nigh degenerated into mere n1anuerisru, and therefore does
not possess the historical interest attaching to the earlier stages of
Egyptian art.

The art of the Ptolemman era, moreovex, in spite of all its
uess and apparent vigour, not only shows manifest symptoms-
oi' decline, but was threatened with the loss of its originality
and independence owing to foreign inilucnees. As soon as Hellas
came into contact with Egypt, the innate charms of Hellenic art,
Which even remote India was unable to re st, began to affect the
hitherto strongly conservative and selt'-satistied Egyptians,

Having thus given a slight chronological outline oi' the pro-
gress of Egyptian Mt1 we must now endeavour to supplement it by
a description of the chief characteristics of each period. Our
attention will be cl1ieily directed to the monuments of the new
empire, 09 ing to their great number and extent.

The Column in Egypt, as elsewhere, constitutes the most im-
portant of all architectural membersâ€œ Its absence indicates a very
elementary stage of the art of building, when arti ie development
has yet to begin. The column imparts to the edihee an appeamnee
" organic life, it lightens and breaks the outline of its different
masses, and affords strength and apportr When compared with
the Greek columnar orders, the Egyptian column is of a very
imperfect character. Its decoration and its form do not iuarnediate-
ly and. exclusively express its prepay ofliee, as is the case with
the Greek column, and the Doric in partxuulax. Its dependence on
Its natural prototype, the \vreuth-crmvned uauopy-support, still
continues apparent, and its proportions, though not altogether
independent of rule, still appear too arbitrary. Lastly, the height
and thickness of the columns Jo not stand in an appropriate
