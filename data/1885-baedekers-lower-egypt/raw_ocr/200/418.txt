stone (Pl. b) has been exposed to view. Towards the W. and S.W.
lie numerous tombs (mas..tabas, p. 370), bat they present no attrac-
tion, being almost all in very bad preservation and more than halt
huried in the sand.

We may, however, notice two of these umgtahas, situated not fur
from tho alvuve mentitmed fo"n0t'ron-yutr1e, but now covered with suml.
In tine uf these, built by a certain Senet' eaaob, were found several
Carefully exeeuted seenest including a representation of the deceased in
a litter, burue by thirteen servantstnnd followed by two large dogs.
The other tomh belonged to another b'enett Clirab (Ce. 'guod' or 'perfect
mnne0, surnamed Dlella', who seems to have been one of the most
distinguished dignitaries of his time, and was married to Kheut-kau-s, at
king‘s daughter. He wasa priest of high rank, treasurer, andsuperintew
dent of the crorrr-magvs'mes, which last ofiirse, recalling the history uiJn-
seph, was instituted at a very early period. He was at the same time a
minister of War, Ur literally 'president of the duuhle house of war'.

Opposite the N.W. angle of the Second Pyramid, and also now filled
with sand, are the tombs (if three other Egyptian magnates of the 5th Dyn-

generations. As the kings themselves are also mentiuned here. these
tnmhs have materially facilitated the cumpilntitm of an accurate Hit uf
the members of the 5th Dynasty. The ancestor of this family Shep-
scmkaf-ankh, lived in the veign of the Phnrunh 'o'hepseskaf, His eldest
sun Aimeri served under 'defer-av-ku-ra; mill Phalvbttumedev, the sum of
Airueri, was n priest of Ira-en-user, and is also styled a pmphot ut

from this magtaha, and the nrchitreve helunging tn them, are )1er in the
mIIScum at Berlin. The eldest sun ltf Ptah-hzm-nefer was called Ptah,
nelersam. Tu the same family heltmged Ata, wlw also served under
1:.i-Eh-nsei, apparently in the capacity rda director or music, .1: he styles
himself 'presidrmb nfmmgz, whn delights the heart of his lard by his

Egyptian wnrd 'peraa' which neem in this inscripliun is the mot of the
wurd l’harituh used in the Bible.

The largest and best preserved at" these tombs lie to the N.W.
ot" the Second Pyram'rdCsee dotted line in Plan, p. 3.3-1), near the
point e. A handsome gateway and a well-preserved hieroglyphic
inscription are still to be seen here To the N. of this point are
also several rows of tombs now filled lip.

We now skirt the W. side of the vast ueeropolis, and reach the
N.W. angle of the rocky enclosure of the court of the Second Pyr-
amid. A natural cleft in the rock here facilitates our descent from
the top of the rock, which is 16 ft. in height. At the foot of it we
reach the plateau which was hewn in the rock in onler to prepare
u level surface for this pyramid fp. J. Part of the surface on .
the N. side is divided by means of deep in isions and transverse
furrows into six rows of squares, the object of which is unknown.

(7n the rock above is inscribed the name of liamses H. in hicroglr-
phiru. (m the E. side of the Second Pyramid me remains of the
tmnple once conneoted with it (p. 350). We follow the W. side of
the Pyramid. (In the rock to the right is a hieroglyphic inscription
(l'l. f; the name nl'au architect, and uninteresting), near which
are several roek-tornbs. (me of these tor0s(Pl. y), nearly opposite
the b'.W. angle of the Pyramid, has a *Ceiling hewn in the rock in
