important at the pilgrimage shrines in Lower Egypt; and the samejuyous
and licentious festivals Which were celebrated in honour of Htrthor at

" Aven (or on, p. 333; and of Pihcseih shall fall by the sword', says
Ezekiel (xxx. IT), when speaking of their idolatrous practices. Bubastis
was the Aphrodite of foreigners, the golden (Jypris, and also the Artemis
of the Greeks; under the name of East she Was the Ashera, and under
that of Sckhct the Ashtamth, of the Phaeuieians (p. 136]. The Upper
Egyptians eetehi-ated their joyous festivals at Dendera during the tirst
halt of the month corresponding to our October, and the Lower Egyp~
tizms probably held theirs at the some season‘ and also about the period
of our Christmas, on the 16th Kboink (Kinlllk, 0r commonly Kiik), the
‘Very auspicious‘ day dedicated to the goddess. Buhnstis is represented
with the bead of a lien or IL cat (p. 137). The cut was sacred to her,
and, according to Herodotus, cats are said to have received honourable
burial at Buhatstis.

'When the Egyptians travel to Bubastis', says Herodorus, 'they do so
in this manner, Men and women sail together, and in each boat there
are many persons of both sexes. Some of the women make at noise with
rattles, and some of the men blow pipes during the whole journey,
While the other men and women sing and clap their hands. If they
puss a town on the way, they lay lo, and some of the Women land and
shout and mock at the women ot'tlio place, while others dance and make
a disturbance. They do this at every town that lies an the Nile; and
when they a ve trt Bubastis they hegiu the festival with great strsra'r-
i'uuw, and uh this occasion more wine is cnnsnmed than during the wlsrrle
of the rest of the year. All the people tthth sexes, except the childreu,
make a pilgrimage thither‘ about 700,000 persons in all, as the Egyptians
assert.' - Thcso ancient festivals are recalled to smile extent by the
modern merry-makings at the (m M Tanga (p. 296).

On leaving Zahétzih the train runs round the town, into the
market ofwhieh we look down on the right. Immediately afterwards
the Mansftm line diverges tn the loft o. 438). The fertile tract
which we now traverse is part of the Gashen of the Bible. During
theTurkish rurginle it fell into l miserable condition, and at the Ire-
ginning of the century airort1ed a very scanty subsistence to barely
4000 Arabs; but the cultivation was so rapidly improved by means
of the fresh-water canal that it now supports upwards of 12,000
prosperous farmers and peasants. The Viceroy 'Sa'id Pasha ceded
this tract to the company of M. de Lesseps, but it was purchased
by his successor Isma‘il Pasha for 10 million frames, erected into a
separate province, and garrisoned with cavalry.

Tue Gnshen of the Bible (Egyptian Untem) is frequently mentioned
by Noses. Thus, in the Book of Genesis (xiv. IO), phmoh says to Jo-
seph; - 'And thou shalt dwell in the land nqusl-em and thou shalt he
neat- unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children‘s children, and
thy tioeks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast‘. Gem. le' 28, 20
'And he sent Judah before him uutn Joseph, to direct his reee unto
Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen, And Joseph made
ready his chariot, and Went up to meet Israel, his father. to Goshen, and
presented hiutselt unto him'. Gen. mat. 5. ts: - "And Pharaoh spake
unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee.
The hmd of Egypt ts before thee; in the best of the land make thy {m

Gen. slvii. 21: - 'had Israel dwell in the land ofEgypt, in the country
of Gnshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, amt multiplied
