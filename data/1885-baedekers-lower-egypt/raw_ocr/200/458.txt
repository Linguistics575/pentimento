402 Route J. smugthA. Environs

S. group of Sahkdm, a title of Ihlrr, to the S. of Mariette's
House. We pass the step-pyramid and the pyramid of Unas
on the left. Exactly in a line with tho stcp-pyramid, parallel
with its W. side, and about a thousand paces to the W. ot' it, we
observe a space of ground enclosed by broad and massive, bat now
very dilapidated, walls oil the E., N., and W. sides, while the S.
side is bounded hy the natural hills of the desert. The object of
this enclosure is a mystery to Egyytologists. Ji. Mariette, however,
conjectured, with much probability, that the place was used as a
pen for the numerous cattle slaughtered here as victims. tepeat-
ed excavations have been made within the precincts of the emylos-
ure, but without result. Each side is 440 yds. in length.

Proceeding hence towards the Mastaha F arin, we observe the
tomb rising before us at 110 great distauec, so that the route to it
cannot be mistaken. To the left are the dilapidated Pyramids of
Pepi]. and Sa/car-em-ear, On the N.W. side of the 111a§taba is
the still more dilapidated Pyramid of Pepi 11., now used by
tho Arabs as a quarry. All these pyramids are constructed exactly
in the same 111auuer as that of King Unas (p. 383), but they are in
such a ruined and dangerous coudi 011 that the director of the
museum has had them all closed again, previously taking an ac-
curate copy of the iustrriptions they contain. --'ruors.s,taba Far’nn,
which may be ascended, is oblong in form, like all the other tomhs
of the kind, with walls sloping inwards. The entrance is on the N.
side. It was first explored by M. Mariette, who believed that it
was the tomb of King Ulias (p. 383).

We may either retrace our steps hence to Marietto‘s House,
or traverse a depression to the N. of the maegaba, opening to-
wards the TL, and leading direct to the village of Sulsl.cira.

" several days have heen allowed ior the excursion to Sa 11, the
traveller may 11 xt proceed to visit Dtvl1shf1r, situated 2/1 hr, to he s. of
the 1111mm Farun. This place is prnrlvsps identical with tho Acanthus
111 nioCrus, where a leaky cask is unee said to hate 1tnod, into which
water irons the Nile was Gny prutrod hy 360 prtests,0u the margin of
the desert there still grow numcrons gnnt trees, as in ancient times. On
the desert plateau of Dahsutu. rise two huge and two smaller pyramids
of limestone, and two of brick, together with remains of othey
which are .11 a eonsidemhm distance from each other The northe
brick pyi'amirl, which was once covered with 511111 or Stone, is curious.
It is sometimes pointed out, but without any authority, as the fabulous
pyramid which Herodotus mentions 11 having been erected by King
Asyehis, who is said to have compelled his labourers to make 11110111 or
"rad lehmionsiy obtained from the hnttum of .1 lake by 111e11111 oi poles1
The entrance ou the N side was nnce approached by a vestibule. The lure-
sont height of the pyvaruid ig 'about :10 ft. Only.

011 the s 1 'de of another ruined pyramid, situated to the SW. of
the last, are traces of two eurbtrulrmenbs (p, 3M1), descending towards the

[rum the larger Stuns rymmm on the W. The last is still 32051. in
he1yht and '2i?lyd in width, being nearly as 1aige as the Great Pyramid
(If eh and 111 its solitude presents It very imposing appearenl‘c even
to 1111 asiastomed eye.

To the li, and s, Ire remains of seven] other pyramids. Still further
to the S. rises a pyramid of peculiar form, sometimes called the Bluuted
