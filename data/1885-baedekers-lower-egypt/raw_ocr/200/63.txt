Fcllvihint THE MODERN EGYPTlANS, 41

The agricultural population ongypt does not exceed two million
souls, an unnaturally low proportion when we ennsider the nature of
the country. The sole wealth oi'ljgypt is derived from its agriculture,
and to the felliihin alone is committed the important task of tilling
the soil. They are, indeed, neither fitted nor iurlined for other work,
a circumstance whie, pmves how completely the stationary character
of the ancient Egyptians has predominated over the restless Ara-
biau blood, which has been largely infused into the native popula-
tion ever since the valley of the Nile was conquered by the armies
ofEl-lslim. The modern Fgyptiaus, moreover, resemble the ancient
in the lot to uhiuh they are tomlemned. In ancient times the
fellil.r t pressed into the service of the priests and the princes,
was compelled to yield up to them the fruits of his toil, and his
position is nearly the same at the present day. save that the names
at his masters nre rhaugml, and he has obtained some relief ow-
ing to the almost entire aholition of compulsory work.

ln early life the Eguit-ian pemssnt is remarkably docile, active.
and intelligent, but at a later period this freshness and buoyancy is
crushed out of him by care and poyerty and his never-ceasing task
of tilling the pitcher of the Danaides. He, ploughs and reaps, tails
and amusses, but he cannot with certainty regard his crops as his
own, and the hardly earned piastre is too frequently wrested from
him. His character, therefure, becomes like that oh gifted child,
who has been harshly used and brought up to domestic slavery, but
at length perceives that he has been treated with injustice, and
whose amiability and intelligence are then superseded bysnllemiess
and otstiuaey. Thus, as in the time of Ammiunns -1Iareellinns, the
fellil1 will often suffer the must cruel blows in dogged silence rather
than pay the taxes demanded of him.

In his own fields the fell’ah is an industrious labourer, and his
work is more cantinuous than that of the peasant of more northern
countries. He enjoys no period of repose during the winter. and the
whole of his spare time is oeenpieil in drawing water for the irriga»
tion of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to im-
prove his system of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the
most necessarytasks he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will
do the remainder of his work for him.

The fellil) is a believexin the religion of Mohammad, although
he knows but little of the prophets doctrines and history. Fol-
lowers of all other religions hebelieves to be doomed to eternal per-
dition; bat travellers are not on that account disliked by him. We
serve rather to eonfiri11 his beliefin eternal justice, for he is con-
vinced that all the comforts and luxuries we now enjoy will he
counterbalanced bytorments hereafter. At the same time he admires
and overratcs our kuowledge, whielr is so superior to hisown. Every
well-dressed European is in the estimation of the natives a prodigy
