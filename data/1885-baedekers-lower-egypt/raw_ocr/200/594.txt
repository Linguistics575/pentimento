Beyond the Wadi Merattarneh the Suez route continues to follow
the l "idi Fhiwik, to the N.W., passing a numher of tine seyil trees
of great ago. After 1 hr. the valley takes the name of W0di Hobt‘tz,
and in less than 1 hr. more it unites with the Wadi Nu_sb, which

The Wadi eI-Homr is a broad valley tlanlun by low limestone
hills. It is commanded on the N. side by the Farbr1.t el»Jemel (see

the Wtdi Jlesulthar and several other valleys, and leads direct
