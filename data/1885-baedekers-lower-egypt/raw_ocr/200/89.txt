Climate. The climate of Egypt is to some extent iurlueaeed by
tho great artery on which the countrys life depends, but the desert
may be regarded as its chief regulator, But for the immense ah-
sorbing power ot' the desert the inter rains of the Mediterranean
regions would extend far up the Nile valley; and, but for its P1'0h'-
irnity, the great expanse of nearly stagnant water at the mouths of
the Nile, covering an area of upwards of 2500 sq. M., Would reudt‘r
the Delta one of the most unhealthy and uninhabitablc regions in
the world. The air of the desert is pleasantly cool, and possesses
the most refreshing and health-giving qualities; indeed, to horrow
Bayard Taylor's expression, it is a true ‘elixir at like, To the deli-
cious purity of the airf of the desert a kind of parallel is alrorded
hy the excellence of the water of the life-giving Nile.

RAIN, throughout a great part of Egypt proper, is a Very rare
phenomenon At Cairo the fogs of winter are rarely condensed into
showers of any duration, and the min occasionally hlown inland
from the sea seldom lasts long. Observations carried on at Cairo
for five years show a mean annual rainfall of only ll/e inch, while
the mean at Alexandria tor a period of fourteen years was Sim-hes,
The unusual frequency of rain during the last few years has been
absurdly attributed to the great increase of the area planted with
, It may be noticed here thin the air is largely impregnated with
saline particles from the limestone racks of tlse desert, and it is t3l1ieily
to their presence that the beaeficiid eit'ect of the air an the respiratory
organs is supposed tu be due.
