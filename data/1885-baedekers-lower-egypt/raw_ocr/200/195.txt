identical. No attention whatever was paid to tastefulness in group-
ing or uniformity of arrangement, the separate scenes being merely
placed beside or over each other; but, individually, these are re-

afford us a far more vivid picture of the life of the ancient Egypt-

the hand of the same figure they perhaps import the power of
restraining and of urging onwards. Then a sea], the symbol

Unuus serpent, possessing the power of life and death, was

the emblem of Liugly power. The seeptre user, denoted aitthor-
