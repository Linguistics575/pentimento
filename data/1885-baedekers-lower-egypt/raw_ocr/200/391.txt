of twm-u. TllE PYRAMIDS 01: uizmt. J. Route. 345

Now the construction ofthe Pyramid occupied twenty years b. Each
of the sides, which face the different points of the compass, far
there are four sides, measures eight plethra (820 ft.), and the height
is the same. It is covered with polished stones, well jointed, none
of which . less than thirty feet long.'

'This pyramid was first built in the form ofa flight of stops.
After the workmen had completed the pyramid in this form, they
raised the other stones tused for the iaerustatioa) by means of
maehinos, made of short beams, from the ground to the first tier
of steps; and after the stone Was placed there it was raised to the
second tier by another machine; for there were as many machines
as there were tiers of steps; or perhaps the same machine, ifit Was
easily moved, was raised from one tier to the other, as it was re-
quired for lifting the stones. The highest part of the pyramid was
thus fiaislsed first, the parts adjoining it were taken next, and the
lowest part, next to the earth, was completed Iasttt, It was
recorded on the pyramid. in Egyptian writing, how many radishcs,
onions, and roots of garlic had been distributed among the workmen,
and if I rightly remember What the interpreter (p, "13) who read
the writing told met f, the money they cost amounted to sixteen
hundred talents 0fsi1ver[upwards or350,000J.1. If this was really
the case, how much mute must then have been spent on the iron
“ith which they worked. and on the food and clothing of the
uorhmcn, seeing that they worked for the time already mentioned,
and I believe that no shorter time could have been occupied with
quarrying and transporting the stones, and with the work and the
excavations under the surface of the earth.'

'Cheops is said to have reigned fiity [ears in Egypt, and to have
been succeeded in the kingdom by his brother Chephren. who acted
exactly in the same manner as his brother, and who also erected a
pyramid, which, however, is not of so great dimensions (for we
measured this one also]. This pyramid does not contain subter-
ranean chambers, nor is a channel conducted to it from the Nile
(comp. p. 358). Chephreu constructed the foundations of coloured
Ethiopian stone (granite of Assuén], but the pyramid was forty
feet lower than the other, heat which he erected it; for both stand

 

 

' It is uni quite, clom- witether Hemdntus "I035" that the 100.000
men were oecupieil 20 or 30 years in building the I'yrruuid of Cheops,
as he tines not say whether it was the building above the subterranean
chamhm. or the whole of the structure, that tuok twenty years.

" This account of the mode in which the pyramid was constructed
has been entirely etmru-meti by modern investigations (cump. p. 3301.
