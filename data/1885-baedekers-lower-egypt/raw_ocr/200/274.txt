thorities, and is presided over by a governor of its own. Owing
to the secluded habits of the Mohammedan families, and in
nousequenre of the fact that a large section of the lower classes of
the community have no fixed abode, it is a very difiirmit matter to
ascertain the number " the inhabitants with even approximate
prevision. Judging from the average annual number of births in
Egypt and at Cairo, the population of the city may be estimated

including 7000 Italians, 4200 Greeks, 4000 French, 1000 English,
1600 Austrians, and t200 Germans. Natives of all the principal
Oriental states are also to be found at Giro. The mass of the
population consists of Egypto-Arahiau tow11speople(p.48], Fell‘ah
settlers (p. 39), Copts (p. 42), Turks o. 52), and Jews o. 53),
the last of whom number 7000 souls. Besides the natives and the
European residents, the traveller will frequently encounter negroes
of various races, Northern Africans, Reduins, Syrians, Persians,
Iruliaus, and other Oriental settlers.

style, and so likewise is the Military School (Ecoles iUitituires;

Selsoot. Cairo also possesses a Girts' School, maintained by govern-
ment (founded through the exertions orDr. Dar. a b'wiss), and a
Cliernieat-Pharrnaeeutieat Laboratory, presided ever by Gr. Gastinel,
and possessing an excellent pharmaceutical collection. The medi-
