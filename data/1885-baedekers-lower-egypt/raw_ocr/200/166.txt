Abraham baring been cast into l furnace by Nimrod for having
destroyed idols. and having escaped unhurt [probably borrowed
from the miracle of the three men in the iiery furnace).

The history of Moses, as given in the Koran, presents no
features of special interest. lle is called the 'speaker of God'; he
wrote theThorah, and is very frequently mentioned. - In the story
of Jesus Mohammad has perpetrated an absurd anaehronism, Mary
being confounded with Miriam. the sister of Moses. Jesus is call-
ed 'lszi in the Koran; but 'Isl is properly l-lsau, a name of reproach
among the Jew , and this aifenls us an indication of tho source
whence Mohammed derived most of his information. On the other
hand, Jesus is styled the 'Woril of God', as in the Gospel of St.
John. A parallel is also drawn in the Koran between the creation
of Adam and the nativity of Christ; like Adam, Jesus is said to
have been a yrophet from childhood, and to have wrought miracles
which surpassed those of MI other prophets, including even Me-
hammed himself. He proclaimed the Gospel, and thus eenllrmed
the Thorah; but in certain particulars the latter was abrogated by
him. Another was erueilied in his stead, but God caused Jesus
also to die for a few hours before taking hint up into heaven.

Modern investigation shows with increasing clearness howlittle
originality these stories possess, "ulh0wNol.remrned merely repeat-
ed what he had learned from very mixed sources tfirst Jewish, and
afterwards Christian also), sometimes entirely misunderstanding
the information thus acquired. The same is the ease with the
numerous narratives about other so-ealled prophets. Even Alexau-
der the Great is raised to the rank of a prophet, and his campaign
in India is represented as having been undertaken in the interests
of monotheism. Alexander is also associated with the Khiglr, or
animating power of nature. which is sometimes idcntitied with
Elijah and St. George, The only other matter ofinterest connected
with Moliarr1ttied's religious system is the position which he himself
occupies in it. Moses and Christ prophesied his advent, but the
passages concerning him in the Therah and Gospels have been sup-
pressed. lie is the promised Pamclete, the Comforter (St, John
xiv. Hi), the last and greatest of the prophets; but he does not
profc. s to he entirely free from minor sins'. He tytynfiru1s previous
revelations, but his appearance has superseded them, His whole
doctrine is a miracle, and it therefore does not require to be
continued by spruOl miracles A ftcrhis death, however, a number
of miracles were attributed to him, and although he was not exactly
rleiOrl, the position assigned to him is thatot'tlusprineipal mediator

ovt-r, an idea foreign to the Semitic mind, and it was the Persians
