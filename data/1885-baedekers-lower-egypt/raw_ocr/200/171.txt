the pilgrims now perform thegreater part of the distance by water.
0n approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside even
their headgear, and put on aprons and a piece of cloth over the
left shoulder. They then perform the cireuit of the Kala, kiss
the black stone, hear the sermon on Mt. 'Arafftt near Mecca, pelt
Satan with stones in the valley of Mina, and conclude their pil-
grimage with a great satyrifieial feast. 0n the day when this takes
place atMecea, sheep are slaughtered and a festival called the Great
Beiram (et-'td et-keb"ir)Oservei1 throughout the whole of the Mourn-
medan countries. (The 'Lesser Beiram', Arab. et-'td ey-ruylrrtyyir,

biggehCthat 'of the pilgrimage'), and forms the close of the Muslim
year. For an account of the feast in connection with the pilgrim-
age see p. 236. __ in order approximately to convert a year of our
era into one of the Muslim era, subtract GT2, divide the remainder
by 33, and add the quotient to the dividend. Conversely, a year
of the Mohammedan era is converted into one of the Christian era
by dividing it by 33, subtracting the quotient horn it, and adding
622 to the remainder. On Dist October, 1884, began the Muslim
year 1302. The Gregorian calendar has recently been introduced

Most of the Arabic LITERATURE is connected with the Karin.
Commentaries were written at an early period to explain the ob-
scure passages in it, and there gradually sprang up a series of ex-
egetical writings dwelling with elaborate minntcncss upon every
possible shade of interpretation. Grammar, too, was at flrst studied
solely in connection with the 1501511, and a prodigious mess of
legal literature Was founded exclusively upon the sacred volume.
Of late years, however, some attempts have been made to super-
sede the ancient law, and to introduce a modern European system.
The Beduins still have their peculiar customary law.

With regard to theological, legal, and still more to ritualistic
questions, El-rslirn has not always been free from disscnsion. There
are in the first place four Orthodox sects, the J.1aneftes, the Shafe-
'ites, the Matching, and the I/ambalites, who are named after their
respective founders. In addition to these must be mentioned the
schools of Free Thinkers, who sprang up at an early period, partly
owing to the irrl1uemxs of Greek philosophy. The orthodox party,
however, triumphed, not only over these heretics, but also in its
struggle against the voluptuousness and luxury of the most glorious

Aseetism and fanaticism were also largely developed among
