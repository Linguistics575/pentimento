verged to the' interior of the Delta. Three other roads, one from
Mt. Casiasf leading to the E., the second from Genha, and the
third from Pelusinm, converged in the middle of the isthmus (pro-
bahly near the barrier of Ei-Gisr], joining the route leading thence
past theSerapeum and theW. bank of the Bitter Lakes to the ancient
Arsinoe, at the N. end of the Gulf of Suez. The Mediterranean
was thus connected with the Red Sea by an overland route at a
very early period. After the powerful monarchs of Thehes had ex-
pelled the Hyksos and suhjugated a great part of the W. side of the
continent of Asia, the coast districts of S. Arabia, and 111iu1y is-
lands and maritime towns of the Mediterranean, Seti I. and
Ramses II. (p. 90), the great and warlike princes of the 19th Dy-
nasty, became desirous of establishing communication by water
between the Nile and the Red Sea in order that their navies and
merchantmen might thus pass between the latter and the Medi-
terranean. This project was probably carried oat as early as the
reign of Seti L, as a representation of his time on the outer N.
wall of the great banquet hall of Kamak (see vol. ii. of the Hand-
book), elucirlatedhy inscriptions, informs us that, on his victorious
return from Asia, Seti had to traverse a canal U41 lentil, Or 'the
eutting’] swarming with crocodiles (so that it must have commu-
nicated with the Nile), and defended by bastious, the names of
which distinctly indicate that it must have been situated 0n the
frontier of the empire. The construction of the canal is, moreover,
attributed by many ancient authors, including Herodotus, Aristotle,
Straho, and Pliny, to Sesostris (Seti I. and Ramses IC). The ca-
nal may possibly have led from Lake Timsib to Pelusinm, and thus
have connected the two seas directly. Blocks bearing the names of
Ramses I., Seti L, and Ramses ll., found near [iantara (p. 435),
seem to favour this conjecture. At a much later period, after Seti's
canal had probably been obliterated owing to neglect, Pharaoh
Nehho (p. Pl) undertook to construct a canal between the Nile
and the Red Sea. The new canal quitted the Nile at Ilubastis
(p. 410), and entered the Arabian Gulf near the ancient Patumos,
No fewer than 120,000 Egyptians perished while engaged in
the work, and the king afterwards abandoned the work, as
he was informed by the oracle that the barbarians alone would
profit by the work. By the 'barbarians' were ehiefly meant the
Plururieians, whose fleets at that time commanded both the Me-
diterranean and the Red Sea. The canal was probably completed,
after the conquest of Egypt by the Persians, by Darius, the sun of
Hystaspes, the great organiser of the Persian empire, and not by
Ptolemy Philadelphus, as stated by same authors. Numerous traces
