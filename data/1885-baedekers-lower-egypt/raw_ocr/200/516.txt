" Wrvr,, u: small town only, but smbu and Stephanus of Byzantium
l n it 'the great'. In the unursc of the frequent invasions in Egypt frum
the E,, Tanis was usually the fcst place which saifered after Pelusium,
tits ancient monuments were thus gradually destroyed, and the
of 'rheoOsurs contributed nut a lillle lo the same result. The

Ruins of Tanis. The wall, huilt ofbrieks of Nile mud, cuel0s-
ing the temple of llamses ll. , the sanctuary of Which perhaps
existed as early as tho primawal monarchy7 was 250 paces long and
about 150 wide. The temple stood in the centre of the town, and
the latter lay on the slopes of hills which hail been thrown up on
both sides of the templo, partly for tho protection of the temple
itself, and partly to raise the houses above the level of the inrrrr-
dation (p. 410). Ascending a slight eminence nlose to the village,
we first reach a large and much mutilated colossal Iigurein granite.
We next come to lt hollow made in the course of Matiette's
excavations, with solid suhstructions of huge blocks of limestone,
in the side of which there is a small chapclt Farther to the E.
another and larger fragment ofruinwas lately excavated, but, like
most of the remains mentioned below, it has again been covered
up with sand. Among the broken tigares in black basalt lying
here is a female torso, a singular peculiarity of which is that the
left breast is much larger than the right. A damaged eolossal
figure, prostrate on the ground, is worthy of notiee, 'as it shows
that (wen granite monuments wore painted. 'l'he fleshy parts of
these Tanitic coloured statues were painted bright pink, or almost
red, the eyebrows reddish brown, and the 'kaiantika', or headdress
resembling a wig, yellow of various shades. Most of the statues
and blocks bear the name of Ramses ll. The fluest of those of the
early monarchy (such as the e0l0ssal statue of Usertesen at Berlin)
are now deposited in different museums. The name of )lerenptah
is also observed on a number of ruins, and so also is the cartouche
of Sheshenk, or Sesonchis lll. , of the 22uil Dynasty, of Bubastis,
but only on those architectural fragments and statues which owe their
origin toltamsesll. Alittle farther to tho E. Was probably situated
thy hypostyle, or colommded hall of the temple, as is evidenced
by the broken columns lying on the ground7 including several huge
shafts of granite, crowned with finely executed palm capitals. At
the bottom of the opening made by the last excavations, lie shat-
tered oluelisks, colossal statues, capitals of uolnmus, shafts, and
lmscs, in grand confusion. All these fragments are of granite,
granwacke, or other hard stone. 0n a blackish ilg,nre in a sitting
posture is inscribed the name of llamsvs ll., who is hero called
'lordof the 'liai1enns', 'proteirtor ofllgypt’, and 'destroyer of foreign
nations‘ The shaft of a huge cnlnmn also bears the still traceable
