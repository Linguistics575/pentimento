irectious) Early in the afternoon of a day during the second of
these seasons the wind, as is the case in all tropical regions, some-
times rises to a hurricane, in which case itis called a "3sulnim'.
Of this wind there are two or three different varieties: U) Itis
called a t'h6beh' when it blows elu'etly from the east, and (21a
'3lerisi' when it comes directly from the south. In the latter case
it is also sometimes called a 'lihamsia', but this name more properly
applies to the very hot, dry, and dust-laden winds which frequently
blow unremittingly for one or two whole days together, and render
the climate peculiarly trying in March and April |pomp, p. 2j.

The name Khamasin, as it is more correctly written, is the plural
of Kinzmsm, signifying "lirty'. and is applied to these winds in conse-
quencc of the fact that they prevail only dar g a period of my days
ltefore the summer solstice, afterwhlch theyinvariahly cease. The Arabs
eont'use this name to the period, and name the winds themselves share.
The wind m Which the name is applied in winter althrds but a feeble idea
or the Khamsin of the hotter season, which forms the only disagreeable
feature of the Egyptian climate, and one from Which there is nu escape.

1n aceordenue with the TEMPERATURE the Egyptian year may
also be divided into two seasonal, a period ofhot weather, lasting
eight months (April to November), and a cool season of four months
(December to Marehj. Throughout the whole country the heat
gradually increases from April till the middle or end of June, and
many of the superstitious natives believe that a perceptible fresh-
ening of the air takes plane on the night of the 'tlropping' (17th
June; see p. WJ). In Alexandria the blowing of the N. N.\ _ wind
sometimes interrupts the regular increase of the heat, so that the
maximum may be reached as early as May or June or may be post-
polled to September or October, The maximum heat in the Delta
is about 95° Fahr. in the sl1aile, in Upper Egypt about low'. At
Uniro the thermometer sometimes rises as high as 114" during the
prevalence of the Khamsin. 111 December, January, and February
the temPeratIu'e is at its lowest, falling in the Delta to 3N', in Ales-
andria to MP, and in Upper Egypt to 4lo. The quicksilver rarely
sinks to the (re 'ing-point, except in the desert and at night. (in

the thermometer fell to 'XP, About sunrise the traveller will some-
times tind a thin coating of ice in his basin, or on neighbouring
pools of water, where, owing to the rapid evaporation, the tempe-

a rule, throughout the ll hole eounts:y, and at every season, the tent-
peratute is highest from 1 to 5 1Lm.. and lowest during the two
hours before sunrise. The result or' the observations of ten years has
been that the mean temperature in the Delta and at0airo is 58" Fahr.
