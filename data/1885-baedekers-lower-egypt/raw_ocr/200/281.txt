In walking through the bazaars (see below) and other streets,
the travetler will be interested in observing how industriously and
skilfully most of the artizaiis work with their very primitive tools.
The Carpenters (nagyCtrj, for example, seem to ply their craft With
very tolerable succees, without bench, vice, rule, or drill. In
order to steady the piece of wood on which they are working they
make use of the weight of their hodies, and sometimes of their
teeth and their toes. For a rule they substitute a piere of string
or a palm-twig, and for boring holes they use an iron spike
imbedded in a circular piece of wood, Which they turn by means
of an instrument resemhling a 1iddle-bow (p. '2371. Their principal
tool consists of a small axe, which serves many different purpos .
A number of other primitive tools are drsun‘hed at pp. 256, ' W.
- After the elosiug of the shops in the evening it is customary
for the porters or watchmen to place their beds (s:ertr) of palm-
twigs outside the entrances, where they spend the night, thus
presenting a very curious and characteristic phase of Egyptian
oat-or-door lite.

The Bazaarst of C iro (comp. p.23), tlroughireerior to those
of Damascus and Constantinople, present to the European traveller
so many novel features, and so many interesting traits of Oriental
character, that he should endeavour to pay them repeated visits,
in order to become acquainted with their peculiarities.

Most ofthe bazaars consist of narrow, and often dirty, lanes,
generally covered over with an awning to shade them from the sun,
and ffanlwtl with rooms of various sizes, open towards the street,
and ahout 3 ft. above the level " the ground (comp, p. 'M).
These lanes usually enclose a massive building of considerable size
(khan). consisting of two stories, and containing an inner court,
around Which are grouped a number of magazines for goods. Some
of the older of these buildings, particularly those in the Gameliyeh
(p. 257) and the Khén eI-Khalili (p. 255), are architecturally iu-
teresting, and possess handsome maehreUychs. A considerable
number of these khius form separate, quarters of the city (Mm)7
which were, formerly closed hy massive, iron-moar1ted gates, still
in some cases preserved ', and they were carefully guarded at night
by watehmen appointed for the purpose. No one was permitted to
