in 1/. hr. more the third, each at which eontnim taint bushes, arundo,
and three 0: four palms, After a steep ascent of am hour we reach a
ruined home; the mute then passes (20min.] at small pond bordered with
the jassa plant (Coluteu haleppims Innk., Arabic kssurtr) from whieh the
'sltwes or Musei‘ (p. 512. are cut, and CIO min.) several cevema in the
{Ivsh-cnluured pm-phyry which were once occupied by anchni-ites. After
a gradual ascent of one lmar mom we reach the tehle-hnd of eizcelyth,
with the ru 9 of a monastery. If llt. Serha} is the Sinai M the early
hermits. this building must have been the scene of the atrocities com-
mitted hy the Saracens which cost forty mnuks their 1ivesfrromp. p. 5IO,
and which have been deserib d by Ammonius and hung. The ascent or
one of the peaks of Mt. Serlm! begins here. The nearest N. peak is too
steep and dangeruus to be attempted, but the second peak may be as-
eended by following a ridge of granite projecting from the ernmhliug
(limits. If the ascent of hit. Serhal has been made from the N, the tra-
veller may return by Dei- gilgelyih. hut not unless he has gatisfhul him-
sem in the course of the ascent, that his guides are trustworthy.

Ascent of Mt. Serbiit from the N.E. side through the UYuli
'Aley0t. The old Derb es-Serbil, or Serbil route, being now im-
practicable, there is no proper path. The route at first follows a
narrow path, and traverses ridges or rocks, hollows, and ravines, and
small plains watered with springs and richly clothed with vegeta-
tion. It passes several cells of auehorites and traces of walls, and
then, for 3 hrs., ascends rapidly through the Wiidi Abri J/am0d
(or valley of the wild Jigs), The ascent of the actual summit
e/e hr.) is extremely laborious, and should not be attempted by
persons inclined to giddiness. The veins of diorite afford the best
footing. The traveller should observe the caverns in the rock which
were once occupied by hermits, the ruins of their huts, the Sinaitie
ins- iptious, and the traces of old paths, and of a flight of steps,
particularly near the summit.

The highest of the tive peaks which form the summit of Mt.
Serbil, and which are separated by deep r vines and ehasms, is
called I2-Neprwwa (the 'beaeon-house0. Fires used to be lighted
here either in honour ot'Baal, or, as Prof. Palmer conjectures, to
warn the auehorites of approaching danger. Many Sinaitie inscrip»
tions still exist here. On the lower terrace of the peak is an arti-
fuyial circle of stones in which the beaeon-tires were probably
lighted. The view from the summit is very imposing; towards
three points of the compass the prospect is unimpeded, but towards
the S. it is concealed by the intervening pinnacles of Mt. Serbia]
and the still higher Misa group. Towards the ll. we survey the

iay of ‘Ahaba, part of the arid territory of Arabia, and the inter-
minable desert plateau of 'l'ih, stretching to the distant heights of
Petra; towards the N. lies the Bay of Suez, and towards the W.
rise the hills hetheen the Nile and the Red Sea. ‘livery detail of
these remarkable formations is distinctly visible hence. The Midis,
including the long, nreseent-shaped Wadi esh-Shtkh, are seen
turning and winding in every direction. The innumerable hills
stand forth in prominent relief, with as well-defhuul colours as
