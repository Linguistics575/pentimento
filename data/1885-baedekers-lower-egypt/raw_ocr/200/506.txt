The town contains no attractions. The principal mosque is a
huge, Shapeless editiee, the only redeeming features of which are
the lofty minarets and the spaoious dome. All the houses of more
stories than one are provided with handsomely carved wooden jut-
ties and lattice-work, which differ materially in style from the
mushrebiychs of Cairo. The principal street, which is upwards of
l gr. long, forms the busy and well-stocked bazaar of the place.

of which are about 3ft. below the level of the pavement of the
nave. Two of the columns bear curious inscriptions. Some of the
shafts are of beautiful verde entice, and others of porpltyry. The
capitals, including several in the Corinthian style, are partly of
Roman and partly of Byzantine workmanship. Two columns stand-
ing on the same base are believed, like those in the Mosque of
'Amr at Cairo, to possess miraculous powers. (Fevct-paticnts, for
example, are said to be cured by licking one of them.) The minaret
is embellished with early Arabian ornamentation
