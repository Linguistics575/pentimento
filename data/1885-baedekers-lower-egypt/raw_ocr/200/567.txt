to Sinai. SERBir" 10. Route. 499

in Itr1ssegger's geological plan which We held in our hands; the
dark granite, the brown sandstone, the yellow desert, the strips of
vegetation ilar1king the Wadi Firén, and the solitary green spot
occupied by the large groups of palms of Rephidim [assuming its

identity to be established), are all surveyed at a glance'.

Geological Formation. According tu Fraas the chief formations of
Mount Serhai are: - (1) Gneiw or grey colour and very tine grain, the
component parts of which are uniformly distributed, the miea giving it a
somewhat stratified appearance; (2) Red granite of great beauty, c'.ortt.
triiaing little or no mien; (3) Diorite erph y, which Frequently veins the
masses of guciss and gsurni e. The fullewiug are the principal [arms of
dinrite: _ (1)maok dimite porph y; (2) Dark green, and somewhat
dingy diorite; (3) Diorite resemhl g perphyr, , (A) Pclyhedric porphyry
of a paiered colour, containing oe. asional crystals or alhite, and a few
grains nf quartz; W) Pnrnhyry varying in eoieur from brownish to moorl-
red, and rough and granulated to the touch: (6) Porphyry in Which pieces
of oligoMase, ahout an inch in length, are imhedded. Tm'quot'ses of tiam,
quality than those in the Wiidt Maghira are also found here.

Is Motsrrt Sel'bdi Me Sinai of Scripture? The traveller is reminded
that during: the battle of the Amalakites, Moses prayed on a rock of Ho-
rels, that he received Jethro after the battle, when the people were ore
umped by the Mount uf God :tnll that from the entrance to the oasis
(Rephidim) to the foot or hit. mai one day‘s journey only is reckoned,
while a my caravan takes two days to reach the Jebel niiisa, and lastly,
that a person acquaintedwinh the peatasula, as the leader er the lame 'tes
undoubtedly was, Wnuld scarcely have acted wisely, if. while reeei ing
the ttthles of the law, he had cumpelled the multitude entrusted tn his
care to encamp tor a prolonged period far from the best watered and
most fruitful spot on the whole mute, As, moreover, Mt, 8erbrtl is by
far the most imposing mountain in the peninsula, as many traditions de-
clare it to he the scene of God‘s revelation to Noses, as it has long been
regarded as holy, as Eusebius, renewed by eoshias and other Christian
authors, ideutiees it with the llorcb of the Bible, and as Pharan and Sinai
:tre always associated in the monkiah chronicles and the resolutions of
the Councils, it Would seem more jastitiablu to identify Mt. b'orirM with
the Sinai of Scripture, than the Jehel Mtss group. If Mt. Scrbftl is the
Sinai of Scripture, Moses must have conducted his people from Rephidim
through the oasis, where both space and water were inadequate to their
wants, and through the deme of Ruweh. into one of th neighbouring
plains in the Widi esh-Shékh, whence the mountain is ble in all its
majesty. Whilst We are almost surrounded by itu amphitheatre of hills
of moderate height, the imposing mehy mass of hit. Seihal. towering
above them all, rises to the SAY., being more prominently and distinctly
visible here, than from any other part of the peninsula. 'Mount Serbil‘,
observes Prof. Palmer, 'seen from a little distance, exhibits Such boldness
of outline, and such huge and conspicuous forms, that it is justly entitled
to he considered the grandest and most characteristic feature of the ye-
ninsultr'. Although the traveller must not expect to be able to identify
on Mt. Serhi'il every epet referred to in the Scripture] account of the
promulgation of the law, there is no doubt that the genera] topography
of the district lvarrn0nises well with that narrative On again referring
to the book ofExodus (xix. 17) we tind this [\nssugc: - 'and Moses brought
forth the people out of the cam]: to meet with God; and they stood at
the nether part of the mount‘. Wrs shall see that there would have been
no mom fur such a movement in the wadis Er-Raha or eeha'iyeh, ad-
joining the Jebel JICrsa group, whereas it was possible, and even neces-
sary, to lead the people whn were eneamped beyond the oasis, towards
the foot of the mountain before us, perhsps (ts far as the hill of Melyrrret
and the lower part " the \Vidi ‘Ale " No one can look 11po1 the
cnuspicuous and majestic Mt. b'erbri1, without being convinced thttt it was
far more worthy of being the throne of Jehm’ah, than any of the less
