play an important part in (loci ing the soul's fate, a detail which
gave rise to the subsequent doctrine of the efficaey of works. This
doctrine is carried so far that works of supererogatiou are believed
to be placed to the vrcdit ot'theheliever. The (lemons and animals,
too, must be judged. Hell, as well as heaven, has iliifecent regions;
and El-lslam also assumes the existence of a purgatory, from which
release is possible, Paradise is (lepivted by 1folyunmed, in cone
sonancc with his thoroughly sensual character, as a place ofcutircly
material delights.

The course of all events, including the salvation or perdition
of every individual7 is, according to the strict interpretation of the
Koran, absolutely predestined; although several later sects have
endeavoured to modify this terrible doctrine. it is these views,
however, which give rise to the pride of the Muslims. By virtue of
their faith they regard themselves as certainly elect, and as a rule
they make no attempt to ('anvert others, as they have no power to
alter the irrevocable deerees of God,

standard ofethics, but also the foundation of a complete code oflaw.

The )lOllALI'IY of l‘ll-lslém was specially adapted by its founder
to the character of the Arabs. Of duties to one's neighbour, charity
is the most highly praised, and instances of its practice are not
odrequent. Hospitality is much practised by the Bcduins, and by
the peasantry also in those districts which are not overrun with
travellers. Frugality is another virtue of the Arabs, though too apt
with them to degenerate into avarice and eupidity. The law ofdebtor
and creditor is lenient. Lending money at interest is forbidden by
the Jiorin, but is nevertheless largely practised, the lowest rate
in Syria being 12 per cent. The prohibition against eating unclean
animals, such as swine, is older than El-lslim, and, like the pro-
hibition of intoxicating drinks, is based on sanitary considerations.
Wine, however, and even brandy, are largely consumed by the upper
rlasses, especially among the Turks.

Although Pomumn is sanctioned, every Muslim being permit-
ted to have four wives at a time. yet among the bulk of the popli-
latiol monogmny is far more frequent, owing to the o1rftieulty ui'
providing for several wives and families at once. The wives, more-

defect of the system of IDI-Irons, although the position oi' the female
sex among the Hriuntal Christians and Jews is little better than
among the Muslims. It is probably owing to this low estimate of
