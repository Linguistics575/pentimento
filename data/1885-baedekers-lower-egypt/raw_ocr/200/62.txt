usual resort of the family and their domestic animals in summer.
The walls of the yard generally contain round hollows, used as re-
eeptanics for the grain which forms the food of the family. Within
the yard are usually placed a square pillar, about 5 ft. in height,
with openings in its sides as receptacles for objects at value, and n
thit'k column of the same height, terminating in a platform shaped
like a plate, with the edges bent upwards, which is used by the
proprietor as a sleeping-place in hot weather. The fact is, that
beneath an Egyptian sky, houses are' not of the same paramount
importance as in more northern regions, all thatis wanted being
shelter for the night.

The poorer peasants mode of life is frugal in the extreme.
Tho staple of his food consists of a pecuiiar kind of bread made of
sorghum ilour in Upper Egypt. or of maize in the Delta, Wheaten
bread being eaten by the wealthier only. This poor kind of bread
often has a greenish colour, owing to an admixture of bean-flour
(l’tvulnn amount). Next in importance in the hill foare m broad
beans (mi). For supper, however, even the poorest cause a hot
repast to be prepared. This usually aonsists ofa highly salted
sauce made of onions and butter, or in the poorer houses of onions
and linseed or sesame oil. Into this sauce, whiryh in summer
enquires a gelatinous consistency by the addition of the universal
bimia (the capsular fruit of the Hibiscus) and various herbs, each
member of the family dips pieces of bread held in the f1ngers.
',oth in town and country, goats', sheeps’, or buffaloes” milk also
forms a daily article of food, but always in a sour condition or half
converted into cheeseY and in very moderate quantities only. In
the height of summer the consumption of fruit of the cucumber
and pumpkin species, which the land yields in abundance, is
enormous, 1n the month of Ramada“ alone, when a rigorous fast
is observed during the day, and on the three days of the great
"eirim festival CForirin Ucirfim), even the poorest members of the
community indulge in meat, and it is customary to distribute that
rare luxury to beggars at these seasons.

The dress of the Egyptian peasant calls furiittie remark, espeo-
ially as he usually works iu the fields divested of everything. The
chief articles of his wardrobe at other times are an indigo-dyed cot-
ton shirt (liarnt.s), a pair of short and wide cotton breaches, a kind
ot' rzloak of brow homc-spun goats' wool fusrbti.t, 'ttbt?yels, or 'abo),
or simply a hian at of slteep's wool Mirornl null lastly a close-
tittiug felt San-cnp (libtleh). Jle is generally barefootcd, but occa-
xiounlly wears pointed red (r.erbtitsJ, or broad yellow shoes (bulghu),
The shfkhs and wealthier peasants, when they go to market, wear
