It is mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium as Tamiamis, a name which
has heen preserved in the Coptic Tarrriati, The town must, however, have
been a place hf some importance during the Roman period, if we may
judge from the numerous and occasionally very handsome columns in
the mosques, many of Which were found on the spot, though others were
brought by the Arabs hy Sell frum Alexandria or Pehisium. Domitian
seems either tuheve visited Immiette, or to have heenhne er its patrons,

Damietta. During the Arabian 0m Damietta attained a great reputnthm

that period stood farther to the N. then its mntlern successor (see below).
It was besieged fur the first time, but without success, about 1106 by
Amhlarieh rtnd the troops of Manuel, the Greek emperor. Suladin devoted

sideruthly marred by the interference of the ambitious, tlmuglt energetie

Austria, quitterl the camp of the besiegers, believing that they Lad done
their duty. At length, after Various vicissitudes, the Christians captured
the place. They ohtained valuable spoil, sold the surviving townspeople
as slaves, and converted the mosques into churches. but in 1221 they
