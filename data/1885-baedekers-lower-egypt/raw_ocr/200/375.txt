of Cairo. suumm. 4. Route. 331

The handsome equlpage of the thdive is also seldom absent on
Fridays and Sundays. Beyond the railway-station t PL A, 51, where
the avenue begins, are a number of cafes and orange and refresh-
ment stalls. Near the beginning of the drive are several villas, one
of whieh, to the right, a little back from the road, is the beautiful
Villa Ciccolani, a visit to which (on the way ham is reruyinmended.
The tower commands a good survey of the environs (fee 1 fr.). 011
the left is the vieeroyal palace Far ers-Nusha, for the reception of
distinguished foreign visitors (pot shown],

At the end of the avenue, and beyond theiirst houses of Shubrav
we turn a little to the right and soon reach the entrance to the
garden, where tickets of admission are presented, We Ihst proceed
to the kiosque [fee l fr.), afterwhich a gardener shows the grounds
and presents visitors with a bouquet [fee 1 fro.

The new garden chateau, which was erected by Halim Pasha,
son of Mohammed 'Ali, on the site of an older building, presents no
architectural interest, bat is worthy of inspection as an example
of rich and etfeetive garden architecture. The fiite large basin,
bordered with balustrades and galleries, Was left unaltered. The
rowers and sides of the square reservoir are embellished with small
kiosques. The fountains consist of water-spouting lions, and in the
centre of the basin rises a kind of balcony, borne by twenty-four
water-spouting crocodiles, which remind one of the proximity of
the Nile. The pavement, basin, and columns are of Italian
marble, while the upper part of the structure is in wood and
stucco only. As already observed, the whole place is in a neglected
condition Several of the windows afford a thte view of the Nile.
The rooms, which are handsomely titted up, contain a number of
pictures, including an indifferent portrait of Mohammed 'Ali.

The *Garden, Which covers an area of nearly nine acres, was
somewhat ineongruously re-modelled a few years ago by M. Barillet
(p. 76) in the old French style, which is ill adapted for the
Oriental vegetation, bat it also contains some beautiful rose and
geranium beds. Among the tropical plants, which have their
Latin names attached, we remark the beautiful Indian lemon-
shrub and a huge lehbeL tree (p. 76), An artiihyial hill in the
garden commands a good survey of the grounds. A large building
to the N. has been built for the Khedive’s stud.
