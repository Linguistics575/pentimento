of every new prelztte. After a lapse of 112 years at now archbishop (Kant:
mam) was installed in the monastery in 1372, but his election was at-
tended With great iimculries, If the quaint old writer Schiltberger of
Munich (1331-1127) could have foreseen these modern events, he would
hardly have recorded the following ulirxtcle' - 'A great woader takes
place in the mnnestery, Where there are m.tny m0nks.whn have asmnuy
lamps, which are 'always burning, And when e monk is ahout to die
his lamp begins to wane, and When it goes out, he (lies. And when th,
Abbot dies, the monk, who sings his praise after the muss, finds on We
altar a letter on which is written the name of the man who is to he
Abbot. And the lamp of the dead Abbot therenpuu lights itself.â€™ The
absent archbishop is represented by 'a priur or wehti, but the estate he
the monastery are actually managed by an intendant, Must of the munksf
who are quite uneducated, practise some handicraft; and they are most,
sueeessfni in We distilling of brandy, end in gardening. Among them
are also a tailor and a shoemaker who charge exorbitantly for their
primitive workmanship The bread of coarse tlonr is also baked on the
premises. Many of the monks spend a few years only on Mt. Sinai, after
which they return home as 'martyrs', The monastery is also mmsidered
as It kind of penal establishment. The healthy maintain air enjoyed by
the inmates of the mrmastery of St. Catherine has always enntrihutcd great-

The Monastery of Sinai, an irregular pile of buildings, lies
5014ft. above the sos-level, on the N E, granite slopes of the Jebel
Mrisa or Mount Sinai, in the Wadi Shu'aib or valley of Jethro.
Into the outer wall, facing the garden, are built two fragments of
marble bearing inscriptions, one in Greek, and one in Arabic (pub-
lished by Lepsius). They both date horn the 12th or 13th century,
and are to the sameeifeet. Thelonger, irrArabie, runsasfollows '.--
'The monastery of Mt. (Tm) Sinai, and the church of theMountain
of the Conversation, Was built by Justianus (i. e. Justinienus), the
pious king of the Greek confession, dependent on the aid of God,
and waiting for the promise of his Lord, to remind himself and his
wife Theodora of the flight of time, in order that God might ia-
herit the earth and everyone thereon, for he is the best of heirs.
And his building was ended after thirty years of his reign; and he
appointed over it a superintendent named Dhulas, And this
happened in the year b'021 after Adam, which corresponds with
the year 527 of the year of the Lord Christ'. It appears from the
style of the characters, that the inscriptions date from the 12th or
13th cent, and it has already been mentioned, that the date of the
foundation of the monastery has been confounded with that of the
castle built by Justinian, The same wall contain: another large
ston , Which, to judge from its ornamentation, probably bears a
third inscription on one of its sides, The monastery was often
destroyed and rebuilt, and consequently exhibits great iucongruity
of form; we therefore Md unbes and round arches, pointed and flat
roofs, and a church and mosque in close tontact with each other.
The whole building presents the appearance of a fortress exter-

houses, and massive walls of stones connecting the different bt1ild-
