them assistance. When the llerher has succeeded in amassing a
moderate fortune, he returns to settle in his native country, of
which throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight,
and to which he frequently remits his hardly earned savings for the

trying to the poor Barbers, who often have to sleep in the open air
outside the doors, and many of them are attacked by consumption.
They are most commonly employed as tloorkeepers (bmvroft'b), as
