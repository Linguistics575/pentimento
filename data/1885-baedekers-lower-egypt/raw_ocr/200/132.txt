in advance to cut oll' this bend and open ouruuruu'catiou
with Khurmm from Shandy, while the main body continued
its laborious ascent of the Nile. The advanced brigade under
General Stewart aemmpiished its match across the Jhtyrida
Desert (see Map, p. 30) with complete success, gaining
sevurely contested victories over large bodies of the Mahtli's
followers at Abit Kiea (Jan. 17th) and at a point near Me-
temmeh (Jam 19th). Stewart, however, lh as mortaily wound-
ed at the latter engagement. The British reached the Nile
at Gubut, just above Metemmch, 0n the evening of Jan.
10th, and on Jan. 24th a small body of men under Sir Chas.
Wilson set out for Kharpirn in two stuamboats which Gordon
had sent to meet them. Sir Charles reached khartpim on the
28th, but found that it had already fallen on the 26th, ap-
parently through treachery, and that Gordon was either dead
or in the hands of the Mahdi. Upon the news of the fall of
l0artyom the British government, after consultation with
General Wolseley, derided that it was necessary to arrest the
progress of the Mahdi, and determined to dispatch rvinforrc-
ments or10,000 men to So Akin, to eo-operate with Wolseley
from that base. The construction of a railway from Souékin
to Berber was also wsolved upon. At the time the Hand-
book went to press the plan of Wolseiey’s farther operations
was not tlef'ruitcly known; but the loss of Klsarttun and the
approaeh of the hot season had greatly complicated his
task, and the mivanred brigade had been recailcd to join
the main body. Though an absolutely trustworthy amount
ot' the fate of (leneral Gordon has not yet been remived7
there is almost no room to doubt that he perished at the
capture of Khartpim.

The mmient Egyptians used three kinds of wn
Hieroglyphic, tho Ilinmlic, and the Demon's, to whieh,
