of Cairo. PETRIFIED FOREST. 4. Route. 339

'Numerous huge trunks of a kind of lmlsunrtree lie in every direc-
tion among the send " in the strata af mciuucne sandstone. The stnteture
hf the weed is as follows. There are mr arurual rings. The wood unn-
sists of prosenchymal and parenchymal cells. variously distributed, the
latter having both thick and thin divisions Dotted veseeis, iilled with
cells, are scattered throughout the tissue, 1 her singly [ti? in 'groups, and
short in their artry.ylati?n. Those vesse _ e divided inm rshaurltrtrs, am
le. vans being alike, but the outer w Is are sometimes without these
Jivi 0115-, the radiating marks are prolonged by means (if a series of l-l
paxenehynml cells. A comparison of the fossil wuod with living varieties
psl1ows that the vessels of the Slcrculie (urd Astrapara woods are grouped
in the same Way, and Unger therefore considers itprubauie that the wood
of the Niculiit belonged to the IJrttaeriiusear m- to the Stereul'tauezu. Thom
sands of these Niunlitt trunks m-e exposed to view in the desert or Klra-
shalL Wltere. the saudstune heeame disintegrated and in course of time
was converted into the sand of the desert, there the silicisod trunks
were gradually disengaged from their sandstnne bed, and they 11th
cover the surface of the Little Khashith tlw a distenee of 10-15 miles,
and that of the (rear' for a far greater distance . Travellers who are
not Familiar with the appearance of a vein of co win be greatly struck
by the appearance of this formation, regarding which all kinds of fauci-
fu! themes have been set up. The geologist, however, will simply
regard it. as akin to the tporrl-rueasares of the meioeeue periud, with this
ditt‘erenee, that, while the Waters of Europe favoured the preservation of
the carbon and the tibve of the wood, the sili nus srradstuae of the No-
hettem converted the bisque of the wood into siliuic acid. The climatic
eh ngcs, moreover, whi h have taken place in the region hr the Nile
since the meiocehe perm] arc doubtless much the same as those Which
mnet have MtUted the interior of Germany, where the brown coal is
chiefly formed of the remains of balsain-poplars aad oypresses.' (Ii-aas.)

Crossing the plateau of the Petrified Forest for about 20 min.
more towards the s., we suddenly reach the S. slopes of the Mo-
_ka.t.tam, through a gap in which, at a spot now concealed by send,
a path descends past table-shaped ledges of calcareous marl, formed
by erosion, into the Wtidi et-IO (more correctly Wadi JUyhtaj,
" 'sulley of waaderings'. On the s. horizon rise the hills of Tum
(p. 405), recognisable by the old fortress on their right spar and by
two heights exactly opposite to us, of which that to the left somewhat
resembles a eoftin in shape, while that to the right is of semicircular
form. Crossing the bottom of the valley in this direction Cs.), we
perceive in the Tara hills the entrance to a desert gorge, bounded
by lofty and precipitous slopes. This valley extends for many
miles in various wirulings, communicates with the ravines of the
desert Which begin in the Gebel ICh6f near I.relmin, and is abun-
dantly stocked with the plants peculiar to the desert.

We may return from the Little Petriired Forest through the
'Valley of Wanderings”, skirting the S. and W. slopes of the Mo-
kattam, passing the Tombs ofthe Memeluhes, and entering the city
by the Place Mohammad 'Ali at the foot of the Citadelt Another
interesting return-rontc is across the Mohattam hills to the Csiy0shi
eminence (p. 355). Thence to the city, see p. 336.

A visit to the Ginsu l’emmmn Fonnsr near Bir cl-Fahmeh
(ihrs, to the E. of Cairo, and 'Y/s hrs. beyond the Little Petruied
Forest] takes a whole day, and is fatiguing, especialiy as the tra-

age
