Fumm el-Khalig, or influx of the city canal into an arm of the
Nile, which, however, is dry from May until the period ofthe over-
11ow. The festivities connected with the cutting of the Nile em-
bankment take place here in August. The straw-market is bounded
on the S. by the Old Aqueduct of the Citadel, which has been dis-
used since the completion of the steiun-pulnp in 1872.

The 11an or this conduit, separated by a street from the arm of the
Nile just named. is commuted of sulid nmsnnry in a hexagonal mm,
and consists of three stoxie about 150 ft. in diameter. The ground-flour
contains Maldes and mztg ,mes, and on the first and second is accommo-

Towards the left, a few hundred yards from the gate of the head
of the aqueduct are situated the Christiun Cemeteries, surrounded
by lofty walls. The first is the English Cemetery, the second the
Roman Catholic, beyond Which are those of the Greeks, Armenians,
and Copts, which present no attraction.

Leaving the head of the aqueduct, we follow the direction of
the arm of the Nile, which, however, is not always visible, as the
houses and walls of the Jlanjul quarter interpose between the
road and the water, and reach (11 4 MO the mansion which form-
erly belonged to s'lenu"sas Pasha el-FransiitciCcolonel Selves), with
two tine Arabian portals (_visitors not admitted). The second nilre
row and short road to the right beyond the ohiteau leads to the
ferry crossing to the Island of R6515». We descend the slope, enter
the ferry-boat [1an for one person, there and hack; for a party
more in proportion; payment made on returning), ascend the op-
posite path, and turn to the right. A young gardeneris usually
in Waiting: at the landing-Pla" to conduct travellers through the
intricate lanes to the garden. At the S, extremity ol' the island
is the Nilgmelcr fNiliyriti), situated on land belonging to the heirs
of Jjrtsun l’uxlm. The garden, laid out in the Arabian style, is mi-
serahly neglected. The paths are paved with a kind of mosaic of
round pebbles, obtained partly from the desert, and partly from
the island of Rhodes, and the most important of them are bor-
th-n-tl with low walls, supporting wooden verandahs and arbours,
over whieh climb immense vines, The gardens contain orange
antllcmon trees, dates, palms, and bananas, and also the henna
plant, which is not met with in the public gardens of Cairo.
