that of the foundation of the monastery by Justinian (p. 503).
Between each pair of columns are ntdely-earved choir-stalls. From
the ceiling are suspended three candelabra, which are lit at the even-
iug service andmade to swing from side to side; also a hundred lamps
of every shape and size, some of which are adorned with ostriiyhes'
eggs, and so low, that they may be reached with the, hand. Themised
Tribmm projects into the nave fax beyond the choir. Aweodon
Screen C'septum'), e0lot1ret1 blue, yellow, and red, and overlnden
with carving, with a broad gate flanked with gilded columns and
riuh ornamentation, separates the chair from the have and aisles.
The large orueifix, reaching to the ceiling, bears the figure of the
Saviour, painted in bright colours. The candelabra, placed in
front of the screen and covered With red velvet, stand on very MI-
cient bronze lions of curious workmanship, perhaps executed bo-
tore the Christian era. - The beautiful rounded *Apse is adorned
with Mosaics of great value, executed by European artists as
early as the 7th 01' 8th cent. The most important " these, which,
like the others, is well preserved, is the '"Transpgurtiiioss of
Christ, in memory of which the church was originally consecrat-
ed. In the centre of the mosaic the youthful and somewhat 00rn-
monplace figure of the Saviour soars towards heaven. Elijah,
the prophet of Mt. Sinai, is pointing to the Messiah; St. John
kneels at the feet of his master; Moses points to the latter as
the fulNler of his law, and St. Peter lies on the ground, while
St. James is kneeling. Each figure is accompanied by the name
of the person it represents, A kind of frame is formed to this
picture by a series of busts ot' prophets, apostles, and saints in
mosai , admirably executed: -

l, John the deaelin', 2. Luke-, 3. Simon; I. James; 5, 11mg; 6. P3ar-
tholoinew; 7. Andrew; 8 Paul; 9, Philip; 10.Tlyrarrasr ll, Matthew;
12. Thaddeus; 13. 11mm. , 11. '0 gym; iroissyt, (he ‘Iloly Superior'
of the monastery; 15. Dame}; 13. Jeremiah; It. Malachi; LS. Haggai; 10.

Obadiah; 26. Nahum; 27. Zephaniah; 28, Zachariah; 29. Isaiah; 30.
Ezekiel.

Above the apsc, on the right, Moses kneels before the burning

bush ; on the left, he stands before Mt. Sinai, with the tables of the
law in his hand. Between these scenes and the arch of the apse
hover two angels adjoining two medallion figures {perhaps Moses
and St. Catharine), which the monks point out as portraits of
Justinian and Theodora, although they do not in the least resemble
other portraits of the emperor and his wife. Under the scene of
the Transhgurarion is an ir1soriptiort ('Ev rhrilmn llrnpb; xzi Tiai

Longlnus, the Presbyter stud Superior of the monastery, fer the
salvation of the souls of those who had eoutributed towards the cost
of the work.
