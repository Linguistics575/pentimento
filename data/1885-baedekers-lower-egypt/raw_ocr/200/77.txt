Course. THE NILE. n

4'.

The Nile (comp, Map, p. 30). The Nile ranks with the Aura-.
zou and the Congo as one of the three longest rivers in the world
(about 4000 U.), since its headstream is probably to be found in
the Shimiju, which rises fire degrees to the S. of the Equator.
Throughout nearly the whole of its course the river is navigable,
with two great interruptions only (at Alpri J.raruraed-Barksl and
Donlrola-Whli Iialfa), Though it is greatly surpassed by the Ama-
zon and Congo in volume, neither these nor any other river in the
world can vie in historical and isthnogrsphieal interest with the
‘father of rivers'.

The discovery of the true sources of the Nile and the cause of
its annual overiiow are two seientitius problems which for upwards
of 2000 years European scholars labcured to solve, while the Egyp-
tians themselves regarded the river as a deity, and its origin and
properties as the most sacred of mysteries, to be revealed to the
curious spirit of man only when he should have quitted this earthly
scene. As it is the Egyptian Nita only with which we have at
present to deal, we shall advert but brieily to the subject of the
sources of the river, and mention the principal iyiiluents only which
aifeet Egypt.

The Nile is formed by the eont1ueuee of the White and the Blue
Nile at the town of Khar.trhu, from which point to its principal
months at Damietta and Rosetta, a distance of upwards of 1800
miles, it traverses an absolutely barren country and receives one
tributary only, the Atbara, on the east side, about 180 miles below
Klrartim, Throughout the whole of this distance, in the course of
“high it falls 1240 ft. , the river has to contend against numerous
absorbing iniluemses, for which it receives no compensation beyond
the rare showers attracted in winter by the mountains between
its right bank and the Red Sea. Nothwithstandiug the immense
Ieugthoftheriver, itvery rarelypresents the picturesque appearance
of some of the great European and other rivers, as its banks are
generally ilat and monotonous, and it contains hardlya single island
worthy of mention. The broadest parts of this portion of the Nile
are a little belowrfhar.ti'vn, a little above its bifurcation near Calm,
and also near Minyeh, at each of which places it attains a width of
about 1100 yds., while the White Nile is ofgreater breadth throughout
a long part ofits lower course As the river pursues its tortuous
course through thirsty land, for a distance of 15 degrees oflatitutle,
much ofits wateris consumed by evaporation andiut'1ltrati0n (a pro-
cess by which it is probable that Libyan oases are supplied with
water from the Nubian Nile), and still more so by the extensive
system of artifie'ral canals requisite for the irrigation of a whole
kingdom. )1. Linant estimates this loss at the time of the inun-
dation within Egypt proper, Le. between Gehcl Sclselrh and Cain),
as one-thinl 0f the total volume; he, found that 1,093,340,222 eu-
