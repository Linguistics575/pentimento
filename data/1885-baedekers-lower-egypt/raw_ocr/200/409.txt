the 'great' or 'eonsiderable', was erected by Klurfra, who was called
Chcphmu by the Greeks, and whose portrait-statue is preserved in
the museum at B01211} (p. 305), but his name hats not been dis-
covered on any part of the structure Owing to the greater height
of the rocky plateau on which it stands, it appears h" or than its
larger neighbour. As the rocky site rises towards the w. and N.,

courses were left in the rough, a tu'reurnstauee which led the French
suvants to suppose that the Pyramid was once surrounded by a
pedestal. The merit of having opened this Pyramid belongs almost
