The languagn of the peasantry and the inhabitants of the Je-
sert is purer and mom akin to the classical language than that of
the dwellers in towns. The Muslims generally speak more trorrectly
than the Christians, being mtrustomell to a wJirwd div'tion and
pronunciation from their daily "petition of passages M' the Aorin.
The chief difference bcmccu the language of the Korin mid the
modern colloquial dialect is that a numhcr of termitml inllcxions
are dropped in the latter.

Alphabet. The Arabic alphabet was developed from that of tho
2ialrata'aus, who in turn adopted their written characters frum the
Palmyreites, In spite of its external attractions, it ig (Hm " the
most imperfect in existence. In written or printed Arabic the
short vehels am usually omitted and have to be supplied by the
reader, a feat which demands aonsidemhlos ill and experience. In
tho Iiorin, however, the vowels are all indicated by appropriate
signs. It is greatly to be wished that the Arabs would adopt rt
simpler alphabet, with a regular use of the vowel-signs, and that
they would agree to write the ordinary spoken langruagv, The pre-
sent eorrdi ion of affrtrrs not only seriously inereasps a stranger’s dit'-
tieulties in learning the language, but is a serious obstacle to the
education of the Arabs themselves,

We give below the sounds corresponding to the tliit'ererit letters,
so far as it is possible to represent or describe thmu to the English
reader. It should also be observed that in the following pages no
use the vowel sounds of (r. e, i, o, u as they are used in Italian (ah,
eh, 00,0,001 The 2 usml in tho Ilandhook is n contracted form of ti,
and is used in preference to it, as it exactly n-prcscms the ordinary
pronunciation (viz. that of a in lath). The original diphthoug
sound of at is only used in the reading of the Jiorin and in a few
isolated distrirts, Where a so nd resembling the French u occurs
it is represented by it (as in t1 iinj. This system of transliteration
will be found most convenient, as the words will then generally
resemble the forms used in Cexman, French7 and Italian, instead
of being distorted to suit the English pronunciation. Thus : cmfr,
which is pronounced Uymeer'; shékh (or shelkh), pronouucrd
'shake' [with a guttural k); bttl0t, pronounced 'toolool'; Abrrsir,
pronounced 'Abooseer'; ete.

Vowan, The short vowel symbols, I‘uthath, Kesmh, and Dum-
meh (if, F, ii), which are generally omitted, become long when mm-
nected with Ale/', Wm, and 1'e (o, E, t, Cr, ct, an).

The numerom gutturals OfArahic. render thelawguago unpleas-
ing to the ear. The consultants Nos. 15, [fl, and 'll, which are
sometimes called 'emphatie', are very peculiar, and modify the
vowels eonneetei1with them: tl us after them a and u approachthc
sound of o, and i that of c. ‘he sounds of the French u and au
(German ii and ii) are rare in colloquial Arab _
