c apels for themselves (Magtaba) in the form of blunted pyramids,
in order, as it were, to pay homage to the memory 0ftheir illustrious
masters. The pictorial decorations of these temples, as well as the
plastic works of the same period, servo, most impressively to com-
yletc the artistic eifeet of the pyramids. While their marvellously
perfect execution aloneindicatos ahigh state ofartistic development,
om- admiration is specially aroused by the striking fidelity to nature
and expressiveness of the sculptures, The unfavourable criticisms
on Egyptian sculpture formerly current may indeed now be regarded
as entirely refuted. Even in European museums an opportunity is
afforded to the traveller ofbecuming acquainted with the noble style
by which the early Egyptian art alone is characterised. What visitor
to the Louvre, for example, can fail to remember the striking
impression produced by the statue of the 'i1Yiter T The expressive
eyes are formed of dark quartz containing a transparent pupil of
rock crystal fixed with a small knob of metal, while the attitude is I'0-
markzthlc for its lifelike fidelity and strong individuality. This statue
dates from the tiftl1 or sixth dynasty. and the museum atBrthi.k Coll-
tains other plastic works of the same period in which an almost over-
drawn realism is still more apparent. The limestone statue of Ra-
Nefer, a priest of Ptah-Sokar at Memphis, and the wooden figure of
the 'village shr'yrch'(p. 303), which the ParisEslsibitio of 1807 has
brought into so favourable notice, are the best-known specimens of
a style of art of Which the veryexistcr1ee was unsuspected a few de-
cades ago, and the discovery of whieh has tended greatly to modify
the old suppos ion that the Egyptian sculptors executed their works
in mere mechanical accordance with a prescribed mnon, The chief
merit of the earliest Egyptian sculpture is the faithfulness of the
portraiture, Which is such that the identity of the person represented
by two diifererrt statues may often be determined by the similarity
of the features, even When executed at different periods of the per-
son's life. In this way have been identified eight statues of Khat'ra,
the third king of the fourth dynasty, although all differing in mea-
urement, material, and the age represented (comp. pp. 305, 307).
Observation of nature in the case of these earliest works has evi-
dently been carried into the minutest details. The race of men re-
presented is uniformly ofthe same character, somewhat resembling
that of the modem fellilrhr; the figures are of a powerful. thiekset
type, and their muscles are faithfully represented. oeeasi0nally to
exaggeration. These early sculptors, however, were incapable of
producing works of a more complex character, where excellence
of general ofteet required to be superaddcl to accuracy ofdetail, and
in this respect they were far surpassed by their successors, Even
tho reliefs in the tomh-ehamhcrs of Iremphis are executed in a
singularly fresh and unsophisticated style, and the spectator will
hardly regret the absence ofthe mystiesymholisn1 ot'the laterperiod.
