masonry. No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments which must
have belonged to ancient temples. At the w. end of the town the
Baht Ytisut' radiates into numerous branches, which water the
vxmntryin every direction. The ililapidate1 mosque of (haf situated
here forms a picturesque foreground.

To tMN. of the town are the extensive wins of Crocodilopolis-
Arsino√©, which has been entirely destroyed. The site is now called
Kthn Firm. Many antiquities, both ofthe Roman and the Christian
period, have been found here, including numerous small terracotta
lamps and many thousand fragments of papyri, intermixed with
pieces of parchment. Most of the papyri are Greek (among them
fragments of Homer, Euripides, Tl1ueydides, also of a Christian
catechotical book), many are Arabic from the 2nd cent. of the Ile-
gira down to 943 AIL; and others are in Coptic, Pehlevi, cRassa-
nide-Persian, and Meroitie-Eth5opian characters. Several fragments
in hieratic and hieroglyphic eharaeters, the oldest from the time of
Ramses 111. (about 1300 BA).), have also been disyyvoted. As the
writings are for the most part tax-papers, it has been supposed that
they belonged to a tax offhr,e of the town of Crocodilopolis, where
old papyri also were used. A large number of the papyri found
here were acquired by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum. and
even a larger number by Theod. Graf and Archduke Rainer for the
Austrian Museum of Art and Industry at Vienna. The very exten-
sive cemetery of the town, with its picturesque tombstones, covers
part of the site of the ancient city; the highest of the mounds of
rubbish command a survey of the whole of the Faytom. At the N.
end of the ruins, about 11"; M. from Medineh, M. Sehweinfnrth
discovered the remains of a large temple with a pylon, in front of
which is a sitting figure of Amellemha L, the founder of tho 12th
Dyn., and inside several slabs with the name of Ramses the Great.
A head with IIyksos features, now in the museum of Gizeh7 has
also been found here. According to Mr. Flinders Patric, tho temple
proper, which was 490 ft. wide and had a double eolonnade, be-
lougs to the 26th Dynasty.

The village of Bihamu, about ' H. to the br, of Mcdinch, was
doubtless once situated on the bank of Lake Maeris. It still contains
sume shapeless ruins nf ancient origin destitute or it1seripfLu1, but sup-
posed to he the remains of the pyramids which according to Herodotus
once stood in the lake. They (tn) now called Km'si Fstr'ftrs, or Chair "
Pharaoh, and resemble dilapidated altars rising above other fragments of
solid masonry. If they were nnee pyramids, the greater part of them
must have been removed, as the walls are new hut slightly inclined
