supposed to be the ancient Phurbucthus. The town was formerly a
place of some importance from its situation at the junction of most
of the routes leading from Cairo to the East. The railway now ap-
proaches the Fresh-Water Canal. which was probably constructed
by the early Pharaohs, and "ertair1ly e Isted in the 14th cent. B.0.,
but afterwards fell to decay and was not again utilised until the
construction of the modern canal.

stocked with t'ssir and frequented by watervfowll The channel of the old
canal, which was re-diserrrered by the French expedition or1798, is still
traceable at places, and its direction has frequently been followed by the
engineers of M. de Lesseps. From the not inconsiderable remains of the
old canal near Belhes, it appears to have been about JO yds. (100 ells,
according to Stralso) in width. and 16-17% ft. in depth. The somewhat
steep banks are still strengthened at places ith solid masonry Ac-
