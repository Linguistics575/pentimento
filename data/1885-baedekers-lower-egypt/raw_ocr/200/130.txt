sum of money, he obtained the sanction of thePorte to a new
order of surr'essinu based 0n the law of primogeniture, and
in [867 he was raised to the rank of khedice, or Viceroy,
having previously borne the title of mm, or governor of a
province only. In 1873 the Khedive obtained a new tlrrmin
"oMirrning and extending his privileges (independence ol'
administration and Jud'toiaries; right of concluding treaties
with foreign countries; right of mining money; right of
borrowing money; permission to increase his army and navy).
The annual tribute payable to the Porte was at the same
time raised to 133,635 purses (about 681,. 3L). With re-
gard to the warlike sum: es of the Khedive and the ex-
tension of his dominions, see pp. 20, 30. - The burden
of the public debt had now increased to upwards of I00 mil-
lion pounds, Olte, low after another having been negotiated
by the tinalute minister Isn1a'tl Siddik, who tinaliy became
so powerful that the Khudive deposed him in 1878 and anus-
ed him to ho privatelyput to death. The Powers now brought
sueh a pmssure to bear on the Khedive, that he was com-

and to accept a ministry under the presidency of Nuhar
Pasha , with the portfolio of public works entrusted to M.

and early in 1870 the whole cabinet was replaced by a 1m-
tive ministry under Sheri? Pasha. The patience of the Great
Powers was now at an em): and on the initiative of Germany
they demanded from the Porte the deposition of lsma'il,

Isma’il was succeeded by his son Tewiik (pronounced
Tevfk) ur Tautih, under whom the government was carried
on in a more rational spirit, especially after Rial Pasha be-
came the head of the ministry. The debts were regulated,
an international commission of liquidation was appointed,
and an extensive scheme of reform was undertaken. In Sept.,
1881, however, a military revolution broke out in Cairo,
whirh had for its objects the dismissal of the ministry, the
grant of a constitution, and above all the emancipation of
I-lgypt from European infNcnees. The Khedive was besieged
in his pnlar and had to yield; he appointed ,'lherifpresideut
