inclining to the right, loads to the neeropolis known as fuuin1
Shafe’i (see below), with the buriaI-mosque of the viveroyal family,
whieh, houever, presents no great sttrsetiom tiders may easily
make this short digressiou (see below).

Between this point and the base of the 11oliattau1 towards the
FL, and extending for some distance up the steep slopes of the
hills, lies an extensive burial-ground, with several conspicuous,
but very dilapidated mausolea, known as the -

Tombs of the Mamelulres, which approach close to the city.
Like the so-ealled Tomhs of the Khalifs (p. 282) their history is
obscure, the names of the builders being unknown, and no in-
scriptions having been preserved. The ruins of these monuments,
however, still hear traces of great artistic merit, and several of the
minarets in particular are exceedingly beautiful.

111 a somewhat detached position, a little way in the direction
of the hills, we observe the ruined dome and lantern mentioned at
p. 177. Close to the town, in the midst of a group of other tombs,
rises the ruins of a mausoleum which once had a double dome.
Inside the building are walls arranged in the form ot' a fan for the
support ot' the outer dome, which has fallen in.

The whole ofthis region is still used as a Muslim bnriaI-gronnd,
and in some cases the ancient uiansolea have been converted into
l'amiiy burial-plates,

The gate by which we re-enter the town is the IMI, el-Nsmffeh
(PL G, 2), If we quit the main street by the second side-street to
the loft, we pass through the street El-'Abr et-Tawil, and in about
10min. reach the S.W. and oldest part of Cairo, containing the
venerable thhru" ibn Tulcm (p. ?65), which may now be visited it
time permits,

The road to the vieeroyal 1rurial-mosrluo in the necropolis of
Jmiun Shafe'i passes the old mosque of Abt, Sumd mentioned above,
descends the hill at the bifumation of the road, and leads to a group
of dome-buildings nearly Igr. distant, among which the impos-
ing outline of the tomb of Inu‘nn Fha/di, of stbluish-grey colour, is
most conspicuous. Near it is thel'Iésh ei-Bisha, " burial-rmrsqne
of the family of the Khedive.

To the left of the entrmwe is .1 sehil. On em'h side of the
large arcade leading to the mosque are apartments for the aeeonr
niodation of the women who come to pray at the tombs At the
end of this covered passage, on the loft, is a small open space, in
which, opposite to w, is a small door leading to the entrance of the
mosque LNearer us is another door l? theleft, loading to the mauso<
leum of a wife of ex-Khedive [sum i1.) As usual in all the mosques,
the visitor on entering must put on slippers " linen socks over his
