the second wears the crown of Upper Egypt , and the third

that of Lower Egypt both representing Pharaoh as the monarch

 

of S. and N, Egypt respectively. The rope, hammer, and chisel
(implements which were still used in the time of the Ptolemies
whenever a foundation-stone was laid), which they hold in their
hands, show that the king was once present here to inaugurate the
opening of a new mine. The shape of the chisel is curious. The
fourth and t1ftl, figures represent Pharaoh chastising the miners.

The hill, about 200 ft. in height, opposite to the entrance of
the mines, is also worthy ofavisit. On the further side are the
ruins of Major Jisedonatd's house, and the summit is crowned with
the remains of a fort and of the mining settlement of the period of
the Pharaohs. Here also are found various tools oftlint, particularly
arrow-heads and sharp instruments, which were perhaps used for
engraving inscriptions, The old road, once used hy the miners,
descending the hill and leading towards the s., with a bend
towards the E, is still traceable. - There is a spring about
25 min. distant from Major Maedolrald ruined house.

Sin. 19. And they tank their journey out of the wilderness of sin, nut
eneamped in Dephkah.‘ In the hunk of Exodus (swi. i, et seq.) We find
farther particulars of this portion of the journey. We Are informed
there, that the Whole " the peuple complained bitterly inst “uses

Many authr ities identif' the Wilderness of Airs " ith the bleak troast-
plain nf El haa, whieh extends from Itirs Abt Zemmeh tu TILr and
beyond it; hut it is more probably identical with the desolate', rucky
tract which we traversed on the route [rum Puts Abu Zcmmeh to the

ahrupt rocks, the multitude, accustomed to the extensive plain, would
naturally be alarmed and depressed, and would murmur against their
leaders.

A little beyond the mouth of the Wadi 3faghira, the Wadi Sidr
turns to the s., skirting the Jebel ALz‘t'Alalt-a [2623 ft] , and after
fully an hour leads to .1 large table-land. To the E.. opposite to |le

side of this broad valley rises the Jebel Makatleb (3380 ft], at the
foot of whieh, extending down to the Mor of the valley, are strewn
blocks of sandstone, several of them bearing the famous so-ealled
'1nseriptions ofSinai. Most ot' them are on the western side of the
valley. Those who do not intend to make scientific investigations
need only devote a few minutes to the inscriptions in passing.
