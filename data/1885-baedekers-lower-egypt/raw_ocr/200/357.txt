The Nilometer fuilyJtse), a square well, 16 ft. in diameter, cow
neeted by l channel with the Nile, has in the centre Mi octagonal
column, on Which are inscribed the ancient Arabian measures and
Clutie inscriptions. The four straight sides are constructed of
massive masonry, and contain niches Miarneti with columns with
Byzantine capitals. Marble slahs built into the walls bear Cutie,
inscriptions. The Fr, " old Arabian ell, is 5-1 centimetres, "
about 211/3inches, and is divided into '% kirat. The column of
the Nilometer, Which has been frequently repaired, is 17 ells in
height, the first of Which is built into the foundations. The np-
per part is secured by means ofa beam attached to the opposite
walls. The zero point of the Nilumeter Catseording to Mah-
mirl-Jhey) is 28t't. above the average level of the Mediterranean,
so that the top of the column is nearly 59 ft. above sea-level. The
water of the Nile, when at its lowest, euvers 7 ells of the Niiometer,
anti when it reaches l height of 15 eils and 10 kirat, the shéhh of
the Nile measurement proclaims the Weftt (p. 230), Le. the height
of the water necessary for irrigating every part of the ile valley.
The announcement of the wefa is the signal for cutting the em-.
barrkruent. The shrilrl1, however, has his private meter, the zero "
which is nearly 7 inches lower than that of the old Nilometer f.

The mean difference between the low and high level of the
Nile at Cairo is 241/2 feet. When, according to the shtikh’s mode
of reckoning, the height of 23 ells is attained, the island of llt‘ytla
is overflowed.

+ The rate of taxation wasdeterrniaed in ancient times in accordance
with the height of the inundation, All the authorities from Hemdotus
down to Leo Afi-it-euns agree in stating that the Nile must rise. 16 euhits,
or Egyptian ens, in order that the tend may produce good crups. The
farno lathe of Fether Nile. in the Vatican is accordingly surrounded
by si on figures of gears, representing these 16 ells. To this day the
height of the tvrertlow '1rdhtences taxation, and the laud which is artifi-
eieuy irrigated pays less than that reeehmi by the river itself. The
object of the government always is to induce a belief the: the hum

motives, from which in ancient times the enstntiy of the Niiameters
was entrusted to the priests alone, still prevent the Egyptian public
frum obtaining access to the M 'suis iu the island of 1hhJir, The real
height of the water is always contented, and false statements mete, es
it is the object of the iiscal rrutluyrities tn levy, if possihie, the run
rate of taxation every year, whatever the height uf tho Nile they have
been. This traditional dislsoriestr in the use of the Niiometer was first
discovered by the French engineers during the occupation of Egypt by
Napoleon'. (C. Ritter.)
