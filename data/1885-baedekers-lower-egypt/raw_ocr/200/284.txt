Fts1.1ly'utsi (literally, noai-market; Pl. Ir, 2), the bazaar t'or wares
from Tunis mill Algiers. We first observe tlrngr- calls, and then
magazines of light-coloured woollen and other stufrs, which7 how-
ever, are imported from Ahrles and other piavos in Southern France,
iming now seldom or never iiianui'actured at Tunis.

Pursuing the sumo direction, parallel with the Jil-Glu/ch
street, and passing a number of shoemakers' stalls ChawOtshi ), we
come to a broader covered passage [cxactiy opposite whieh is a
modern okella, presenting no attraction), which we follow to the right
for a few paces. and then take the tirst lane to the left. At the od
oi' this laue lies l more open spot where undressed wool is exposmi
for sale, Lower down, a. little to the left, wo, reach the sulrlrsriyeh,
or bazaar for sugar, vlried fruits (nuki) and similar wares. Adjoin-
ing it is the Chhni' el-Jluuiyuzl fp. Qt?) now undergoing restora-
tion, while facing us, at the turd of the street, rises the handsome
ml, es-Zurve"tele (see p. 272), Dr Jlululrclli. Uppositc the outside,
of the gate is a house with a large grated window, and in the Cor-
ner is a cohnnn built into the wall, at which executions by stran-
guiatiou formerly took place. In a straight direction we nest clltur
the Shoemakers' Bazaar, formerly l school, an interesting building,
the iirst story of which overhangs the lower and is home by large
braekets. The large gateway (on the right) is still preserved; part
of the interior has been altered, while the rest of it is in a dilapid-
ated "onrlition,- The same street then passes the stalls ofthe tent
and llvg-ma]u?rs, and loads to the Boulevard Jfolutmmerl'Ali Cp)W)),
at the W. end of which arc the mosques of Sultin i'izlsitil (p. 260)
and "iWiyeh (p, 260), the latter being still unliHislred. On the
left, before this last is reached, is the entrance to the once cel-
ebrated Siiig es-Seliéha " E, 2), or bazaar of the annourcrs. now
iedncod to three or four miserable stalls, where European weapons
are sold. Keeping to the left, we traverse several crooked lanes
and reach the Sebil Mohammad 'Ali (see below) in the Ghiiiiyoh
street. This last digression, however, is uninteresting.

WE: return from the Shoerrvciuyrs' Bazaar to tho P,ib cz-Zuwf‘lch,
before reaching which we pass the unattractive Saddlers’ Bazaar
(Stile evs-Suroryeh), and a poliee-ofthuy at the corner to the right.
We now follow a broader street, the first part of which is called
the Sukkariych (see above). Beyond the Subi] Mohammad 'Ali this
street " named El-Ghnriyeh from the mosque urcutvd by Sultan
_ -hi'n-i (p. '274), the small minaret of which. with its domes,
ris a nearly in the middle ol" the street.

We follow this street in a straight direction nearly as far as' tho
post of the (lower) sentry on tho icl't, a little before reaching whmn
we, turn to the right into the sh? esAiitilih1, or bazaar for wares
from the Sfulfui, consisting ofahests, gum, Mms-palm nuts, ill-
lzmm-d iigi-r skins, etc. (see p. 236). i"arthcr on, in a straight
