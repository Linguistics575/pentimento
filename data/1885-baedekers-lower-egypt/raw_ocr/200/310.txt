L'ntil quite recently the greater part of the old mosque lay in
ruius, but the heaps oi'ruhhish have now been removed or levelled,
so as to clear the great "ourt for the reception of the huihliug ma-
terials of the Wirlif. The central part of the sanetuary was restored,
as far as its advanced stage ordilapidatio" allowed, in order to
nontain a tllUSerul1 ofArabian art, which will shortly be opened,
The umlrt " the old mosque is to be occupied by a school of art.

The whole building occupies an area about 400 ft. long and
3:30 ft. wide. The great court was mljeineil on the side next the
sanctuary by iivo aisles or arcades, on the W. by two, and on the
N. and S by three. These were supported by brick pillars, 10 ft.
high am] 4th, rt, thick, inerustedwith stucco. Thepillars are rounded
at the corners and bear pointed arches approaching the horseshoe
form. The ceiling and the wooden bolts were formed of the stems
of the olate-palm. The L'uth, inscriptions and arabesques are oflittle
artistic value, and the entire structure was much less carefully and
artistically built than its model, the Gimir 1hilfin. _ On the N.
sinlc of the mosque are two massive Muhkhara (p. 177). with bases
executed in tho style of the Egyptian pylons, That at the N.E.
corner is connected with the old town-walls, the bastions of which
bear inscriptions dating from the r'rerwh occupation M1799.

Returning to the lane by which Wt', have come, we follow it to
tlw N, , passing on the left an okella with an interesting gateway
nurialmil with stalaetite decoration, and a farade adorned with
Arabian wood-carving. We now reach the -

Bib et1-Niss.r, or 'Gate of the Help of God', the plan of which
was probably derived from the lioman castle of llabylon (p. 3'20).
Thc auniunt city-wall to the W. venueets this gate with the
similar Bib el-Fumh, or ‘(inte of Victory". These two gates,
tcgntln-r with the fortilhyi mosque of Sultirr Wrliirn situated he-
tiwou them [see above), formed a strong position for the troops
of hapoloon, “hose cannons have only recently been removed
