The plain watered by the Rosetta arm of the Nile is extremely
fertile. A little to the N. of Kafr oz-Za/t the river describes a
long curve; and somewhat farther to the N. , on the W. bank, a
little, inland, but visible from the water, rise the ruins known as
Ed-llahartyeh, a series of heaps of debris which mark the site of a
.town of considerable size. On the W. bank, farther on, is the
pleasant village of Nakhleh. The village of $42 el-Ijager (0n the

The ancient Sais is mentioned in history at a very remote
period, and as early as the 18th Dynasty it was regarded as a cradle
of sacerdotal wisdom. The goddess Neith, whom the Greeks iden-
tified with their Athene, Was the tutelary deity of the place. She
was one of the maternal dfvir1ities, a manifestation of Isis (p. 135)),
and was named the 'great cew’ which gave birth to the sum She
was worshipped both by the Egyptians and the Libyans. On the
Roman coins of the Saite Nome is seen a figure of Minerva with
an owl in her right hand and aiauce in her left. It was this
idcr1tifieatiot1 of Keith with Athene that probably led Partssnias to
suppose that Pallas-Athene originally came from Libya, to which
Sais was frequently considered to belong, According to an ancient
tradition, Athens is said to have been founded by Cecrops of Sais,
and afancifni corroboration ofthemyth is sought for in the fact that
the letters of A-neth-e and Athena are identical. Most of the
Greek scholars who repaired to Egypt for purposes of study went
either to Heliopolis or to Sa'x's. According to Plato, Solon as-
soniated here with the learned men of Egypt, Herodotus obtained
much information here, and the fame of thc Saite knowledge of
mysteries Was maintained down to a late period. The‘thh Dynasty
originated in the city of Ncith, and its kings were specialiy
devoted to that goddess, to whom they erected monuments ofgreat
splendour. Uambyscs also visited Sais after his conquest of Egypt,
and showed himself favourable to the temple of the goddess and
her rites. It is not known when the town was destroyed. It was
probably an episcopal see at a veiy early period.

There is now nu trace of the famous buildings created here by
Amasis and others (p. 93), or of the chapel formed of a single
block of granite brought from Eiephantino to b'iis, which must
have weighed at least 250 tons. The site of the temple of Neith,
whirh was cunneeted with the royal palace and with a mausoleum
for the Pharaohs of the 26th Dynasty7 cannotnowbe identit'uyl with
any certainty. The columns w'1thpalm-eapitals, the tomb of Osiris,
the obelisks, statues, and amlrosphinxcs, mentioned by Herodotus,

according tu Herodotus, mystery-plays were acted at night in
