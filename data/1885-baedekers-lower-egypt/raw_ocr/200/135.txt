or co ? .The readingis, however, faeilitatedby the faetthat,

in order to ensure the correct pronunciation of each syllahie sign,
none but the most definite sounds were added toit. The symbol eee

men, for example, is never Written h eeey, asit mightbe, butal-
most invariably eeey or eeet . It represents a ehess-board with
MMM

figures. The ideographic signs, or determinatives, are placed as

explanatory adjuncts after tho phonetically written groups. They

are indispensable in elucidating the signi0ation, for the Egyptian

language, having been arrested in its development, is poor, and full
bJ

of homouyms and synonyms. The symbol MM dnkh, for CE-

ample, means 'to live', 'to swear', ‘the ear', ‘the mirror', and 'the
goat'. The reader would easily fall into errors, such as mistaking
tlakh nefer for 'a beautiful life' instead of 's beautiful goat', if the
determinative, or elass,.sign did not come to bis aid, and show to
what category of ideas the object belonged. Thus, after (ink/r, the
goat, the Egyptians either placed a figure of that animal, or a piece

of hide with a tail , Which served as a common symbol for all
quadrupeds The symbol used to represent a particular word is
termed a 8peeial, while one chosen to denote a class is termed a

general, determinative. An elephant % placed after the group
of-u , Eb, 'the elephant’, is a special determinative, while a

lock of hair h placed after _ senem, ‘the mourning', is a

generaldeterminative, a lock of hairbeing the eonventioualemhlem
of grief, as the men were in the habit of cutting " their hair in
token of sorrow. A word is frequently followed by several deter-
minatives. Thus CE ash is 'the eedar’; but the wood of the
tree being scented, the group representing al, was not only fol-

lowed by the iip1re of a tree , but also by the symbol C5, which

signifles that a perfumed object is spoken of. The special deter-
minative always precedes the general. Symbols that were not
capable of being very clearly engraved on stone were sometimes
omitted, and the special determinative given alor1e. Instead of
