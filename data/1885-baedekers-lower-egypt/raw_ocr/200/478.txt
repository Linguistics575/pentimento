420 Route 0. 'AIN MrjSA.

prising Greek sailors set l'nrth to solve lhe great geographical prrrblern
ur the ancient ueuenic world regarding the true character and situation
of In The Red Sea was also navigated by the merehtmtrnen nf
the Plulemies and the Romans, who by this route imparted precious
stairs frum India and spices (mm Ai-nhie - the robes and pearls which
decked Cleopetm, and the fnmkinccuse which perfumed the halls "
the Palatine. The waves of this see, moreover, wash the shures of
places deemed seared by two tlifrereat religions, viz. Mt. Sinai, and Jed,
tie, the seaport of Mecca'. (Stephan.)

With regard to the Exodus of the Israelites and their passage
of the Red Sea, see p. 481. If the Red Sea is really meant, and
not the Sirhonic Lake, as supposed by Brugsch, the scene of the
passage was most probably near the modern Suez.

'Ain J10su is an oasis, the property of M. Costa o. 415),
about five funongs in circumference, and watered by several springs.
The traveller will easily iiud a pleasant resting-place for luncheon.
The vegetation here is very luxuriant. Lofty date-palms and wild
palm saplings, tamarisks, and teams thrive in abundance; and
vegetables are successfully cultivated by the Arabs who live in the
mud hevcls near the springs, and who expect a hahshish from
visitors. Their gardens are enclosed byopuntia hedges and palings,
at the entrances to which the traveller is beset by barking dogs.
The springs, situated in the midst of these gardens, consist of
several turbid pools of brackish water. The largest of them,
enclosed by an old wall, ls said to have been the spring called
forth from the rock by the red of Moses, or the bitter waters which
the prophet sweetened by casting a certain tree into them. The
scene of these miracles, however, must have been a considerable
distance to the S. of this point; but this oasis may have been the
spot where Moses and the Israelites sang their beautiful song of
praise, recorded in Exodus, xv.

'I win sing mite the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the
horse and his rider hath he thrown into the seat The Lord is my
strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my and, anti
I will prepare him an l1abitrrtiru1; my father's God, and I will exalthim.
The Lord is e man of war: the Lord is his name. Pl1araoh's chariuts
and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are
drowned in the Red see. The depths have cuvered them: they senkinta
the botturn as e stone. TIV right hand, 0 Lord. is become glorious in
pnwr'r: thy right hand, 0 Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy, And
in the greatness of thine exceâ€˜llenuy thuu hast overthrown them thitt rose
up against thee: thou seutest forth thy wrath, which consumer] them as
stnhhle. And with the blast ofthy nostrils the waters were gathered to-
gather, the floods steed upright us an heap, and the depths were con-
ecaicd in the heart of the sett. The enemy said, 1 will pursue, I win
ttvcrlitke, 1 will divide the spoil; my lust shall be tsatisfied uptiu them;
I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. Thnu ttidst blow
with thy wiud, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty
waters',

The oasis is also interesting in a geological point of view, pap'
tieularly on account of the formation of a ttamber of springs, which
he in fur1nel-shaPul cavities at the top of isolated mounds, 4-i5 ft.
in height. These springs hare been described by Frees, the goo-
Iogtst, whose account will be best appreciated hy the traveller if
