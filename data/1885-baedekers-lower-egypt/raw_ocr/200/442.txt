386 Roule J. SAKKRRA. Environs

in the reign of Psammetikh I. and extended at intervals down to the
time of the last of the Ptolemies, form a series of vaults on both
sides of ,1 lofty horizontal corridor hewn in the solid rock. These
ehambcrs average 20 ft. in height, arid their pavement and vaulted
ceilings are eoustructod of cxeelleut Mokattam stone. The passages
into which they open have an aggregate length of 380 yds., and
are about 10 ft. in width and
171/2 ft. in height. Twenty-
four of the ehamhcza still con-
tain the huge sarcophagi in
which the Apis mummies were
deposited. These monster eoi-
fins average 13 it. in length,
7ft. in width, and lift in
height, and nu less than 65 tons
in weight. The eovcrs, five of
which are eomposed of separate
pieces of stone cemented to-
gather, have in several iustauecs
been pushed on one side, and
on the top of some of them the
Arabs, for some unexplained
reason, have built rude masses
of masonry, All the sareophagi,
when discovered by Mariette,
had been emptied of their core

_ - -- - - tents, with the exception of
two, which still eontained l nnmher of trinkets.

Twenty-four 01' the sarcophagi are, of granite, but three ofthem
only bear inscriptions, briefly recording the name of the king by
whom they were erected. One of these sarcophagi bears the mme
of Amusia [the last king but one of the 2(irh Dynasty), another
that of Cambyses, and a third that of Khabbash (p. 94), a king of
the house of the Sn'r'tes, who gained possession of the throne dur-
ing the reign of Darius and Occupied it until the second year of
Xerxes. The cartouehcs on a fourth sarcophagus, dating from one
of the later Ptolemies, are empty. The most instructive relics
found here were the 'Apis Sides" or small stone votive tablets pre-
sented by pilgrims to the shrine of the bull last interred, and
which, it is said, mum only he received within seventy days of
the sum! animal's death. These tablets during the earliest period
were attached to the basement of the small temple of Apis erected
ahove the vault, and afterwards to the wall which shut olT the
vault from the main passage. As time rolled on, they were set
up at a still greater distance from the tomb, although, curiously
enough, specially favoured persons were permitted to place Slu-
lu/zltu, boring inscriptions similar to those on the stcles, near the

'ii.
