me frequent here, hut custom requires that the bridegrtmm should Ilur-
ehese his bride {mm her father, the usual price being several camels,
hurt a certain sum of money‘ but the bargain is seldom concluded with
out yrtttracted negotiations condtloted by a third party. The girl is not
permitted to kntvw anything ofthese negotiations between the father, the
suimr, and the mateh-meker (khatib); and if she should happen to have
been awitness oftheut, decorum requires that she should retire into the
mountains‘ though only for a few hours. Some tribes require that she
shttnld remain among the mountains for the three days preceding the
marriage, but among the Tawera she spends them in a tent erected beside
that of her father, whence she is removed to the, dwening of her fntnre
husband. It occasionally happens that the girl flees of her own heeuni
to themountains, and seriously resistsand throws stones at an unacceptable
'suuureomIrp.497). Each tribe has a h‘hekh. or chief, a title of honour
which is also sometimes applied to the older and most respected
members of the community. The dress tit these Bcduins is very
simple. They wear a tarhiish " (b turban, and a grey gown Fastened
with e. girdle round the waist. ln cold weather they wear a burnnus
of coarse material; many of them ture barevfttuted. but the wealthier
wear sandals of camel-lcather. Their usual wenpnm comist of sabre uni
knives; the guns they use, in hunting are of great length and simple
enmtructinn. They neither nae bursa: nor latices, hut the men often
carry stares, which are still made in the form ut the Egyptian -
From their girdles usually hang ttmulets, tinder, and tttbah i pipes.
Those tribes. with whom the tmveiier ehieily comes in uonnct, call
tl1esnselves 'l'i‘twaril (people rd Trirl, and are generally honest, Thu
principal subdivisions of this tribe are the Fibjarleddrhr, Mezeneh,

Shuhin. The Beduins n: the E. and NE, and pit uierly the Utfuwhr,

mstory of Me Petu'muta. The history of this region is as old as that (If
Egypt itself, for we ilnd that the iivst Pharaoh, of whose reign we
puesese criatetupovr1neons monuments heari inseriptiuui (Snefrn), signa-
lisod himself as the eunqueror orthese mountain tribes, and the discover
rer of the mines. The mines in the desolate wad; Magltim (p. MII) and
germ; el-Khsdem (p, 5'11) Were worked by Egyptian: more than 5000
years (tgtt; and uttppcr, malachite. and turquoisee were hmnght thence to
the tre ry of Memphis. Duwn to the time ofthe iavrrsion of Egypt by
the 11 ‘305 (p, 88), we learn that the peninsula Was dependent on the
Pharaohs, and was impoverished for their advantage. Whilst the latter,
having heen supplanted by the new masters of Egypt, maintainer] them-
selves in the s. part of tho valley er the Nile, it seems that the working
of the mines was suspended, and that the mountain trihee eueeeeded in
shaking off the yuke crrtl1eivopptrussurs. Immediately after the expulsion
0f the Uykstts. these tribes were stthjughted anew by the powerful mo-
unrchs or the 18th Dynasty, who utmquercd all the states adjoining Egypt on
the East. This is proved by the insstrlptiurtsorSirsrln"4 eHKhftdem. extending
down to the 2ryhDyuasiy. The names of thespviugs,mour1taius, and valleys,
resemble those of the Book of Exodus; and the Bihlical traditions, which
the Beduins attach to them, douhtiess owe their origin to the Christians
who settled M an early period in this wilderness, With regard to the
battle with the Autalekites, and Mount Sinai as the scene of the pru-
nuugation at the law, see p.MH etseg. We may,however, remark here, that
the Israelites or a later period never made pilgrimages from Palestine to
the sacred mount, and that, throughout the Mosaic writings, Elijah
