conquerors sueeeeded in maintaining their position, and though
apparently at Mst inclined to moderation, were at length driven by
the conduct and the previous example of the Copts themselves to
persecute and oppress them to the uttermost.

In spite, however, of all these disasters, u numerous community
of Copes has always existed in Egypt, a fact which is mainly to he
amounted for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual oppres-
sion and contempt to which they have been subjected, the grave
disposition of the subjects of the Pharaohs has degenerated into
sullen gloom, and their industry into cupidity. The raiieom whirh
they have so long cherished has embittered their charmâ€˜ter, while
the persecutions they have suffered have taught them to he at one
time eriuging, and at another arrogant and overbearing, They are
in very few respects superior to their Mohammedan countrymen
They generally possess an hereditary aptitude for mathematical
science, and are therefore in great request as book-keepers mid
areouutants, but on the other band they are entirely destitute of the
generous and tliguilied disposition of the Arabs. 'l'hey obey their
law which forhiils polygamy, but constantly abuse that which per-

oppressors, and they still take a pride in it as a mark of their origin,
though now permitted to dress as they please. A practised eye will
also frequently detect among them the ancient Egyptian east of
features, Towards strangers the Copt is extewally obliging, and
when anxious to secure their favour he not uiii'requently appeals to
his Christian creed as a bond of union. Many Copts have recently
been converted to Protestantism by American missionaries, parti-
cularly in Upper Egypt, ehicfly through the foundation of good
schools and the distribution of cheap Arabic Bibles. Even the
orthodox Copts have a great reverence for the sacred volume, and it
is not unenmmou to meet with members of their seet who know the

begun hy y'srneiseans at the end of the 17th and beginning ofthe
le'yth cent, has been less successful among the Copts, multhere

is partly due the preservation ofthe old Coptic language, into which
