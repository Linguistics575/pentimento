hehited area of Egypt, excluding the deserts, as12,830 sq3f.anil the
area autually under cultivation as 9460 ssrM. The alluvial soil of
the Nile Valley, in eontradistinetioi, to the desert, known among the
natives by the Arabic word 'Er-llt/", begins at Klrsrttun, at the con-
t1uonee of the White and the Blue Nile. Following the wide curve
described by the Nile through Nubia, the length of the valley as
far as the tisst cataracts is 0801., but as the space between the
river and its rocky banks is very limited, and the irrigation system
is imperfectly developed, the cultivable area in this part of the
valley is only about 1050sq. M. The Nubian portion of the alluvial
soil of the Nile is thus Very insigniiirsant, and when the ancient
oracle described Egypt as the country watered by the Nile, and the
Egyptians as the people who quenched their thirst with its water,
the river below the first cataract must obviously have been meant.

Divisions and Administration. The ancient prehistoric Egyp-
tians were at first subdivided into numerous tribes, who formed
a number of distinct small and independent states, with their
own laws and their peculiar tutelary gods. These states were
afterwards gradually united into the two large principalities of
Lower Egypt or the Northern Gnurtry(To Maw, 01' To Melt), and
Upper Egypt or the Southern Country (To Res, or To Fem)), At
a later period these two larger states, united under one Sceptre,
formed the empire ot" the Pharaohs, or the land of Fend. The
smaller states then constituted provintes or uomcs (Egyptian chsoph;
Gre e nonwi), The ancient Egyptians divided each name into four
principal parts '. - CI) The capital (Nut), the religious and admin-
istrative centre of the province; (ly) The cultivated land (Um,
subject to tho annual inundation; (f) The marshy land which re-
mained in a moist condition after the inundation; (4) The district
traversed by canals conducted out of the Nile. The civil and mili-
tary administration of the uome was presided over either by here-
ditary governors (hilt), or by uomarchs (mer-rust-Ot-to) appointed
by the king. Under the Ptolemies these governors were called stm-
tcgoi (nomu)ortuamarehoi, and over a group of these presided an api-
stmtcgos. The chief authority in religious matters was the high priest
of the temple, whose appointment was sometimes hereditary and
sometimes elective; and his staff consisted of a prophet, a temple-
sirribe, a stolistes er custodian of the vestlnelxts, and an astrologer.

The number of the names varied at different periods. Most of
the tlassieal authors (thus Diodorus, liv. 3; Strabo, xsriii. l, 3)
enumerate thirty-six. The Egyptian lists, such as that of Edfu,
mention forty-four, half of them being in Upper and half in Lower
Egypt [but two of those in Upper Egypt and three in Lower Egypt
'arc counted twice), The Greeks and Romans sometimes divided
Egypt into three parts - Upper, Central, and Lower Egypt, or the
Tl1eba'is, Heptanomis, and Delta.
