Hssmxy " Suez Little is knuwn regarding the ancient history of
Sues. A town mentioned " the tirst time by Lneian under the name
of szma, or Kleisma, seems to hztve ueeupicd this site at a very early
period. It was a mrtilied place, and the special task o? the garrison
Was to protect and maintain the old isthmns-canal completed by Darius
(p. 427). Ptolemseus calls the place Clysma Ppaeeidiwn. but places it
mueh farther to the S. During the supremacy of the Arabians, who re-
opened the old canal for a short time (p. 428;, the town was named
Kalzum 0r Kolzimt After the 8th cent. it seems to have sunk inta

Ith- (p. JIN. - The ehief historical interest attaching to the place lies
in the fact that it is usually supposed to be close to the point where the
Israelites crossed the Red See (comp. pp. 419, 483).

Suez, a town with 11,170 inhah., lies at the head of the gulf
of that name, one of the N. extremities of the Red Sea, and to
the sm of the mouth of the Suer. Canal. On the W. it is com-
manded by the picturesque blue heights of the 'Atilra 1lts., and
on the E, by hills belonging to the Asiatic Boast ranges Before the
construction of the great work of ll. de Lesseps, Suez was ll miser-
able Arabian village, with 1500 inhab. at most.

To this day the town presents a very dreary appearance, and
its trade has again greatly fallen off, the stimulus given to it by
the opening of the canal and the large docks having apparently
been transient. Neither theArahian quarter Withits seveninsiguiti-
cant mosques, nor the streets of the European quarter, which can-
tain several buildings and warehouses of considerable size, present
any attraction. The Arabian bazaar is unimportant, but at the
entrance to it are stalls of beautiful shells and coral from the Red
Sea, for which exorbitant prices are asked (comp, p. 416]. Near
the Suez Hotel are several stalls where Chinese articles are sold.

On a mound of debris to the N. of the town, not far from the
station and the magazines of the 'Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company’, is a kiosque of the Khedive, commanding a
tine view of the mountains of the peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the
