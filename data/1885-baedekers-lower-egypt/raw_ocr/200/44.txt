'll [:AZAAHS.

trades, such as 'shi.k en-Nrryly1stn' (market of the copper-soul,
'tr'ohury?yea' (of the jewellers), Klrurdiryiyelr' (pf the ironmongcrsj,
iits.s.sriinst' (of the butchers], and sometimes after a neighbouring
mosque These bazaars are generally crowded with customers and
idlers, and aiford the traveller an excellent opportunity of ob-
serving Oriental manners. In all the larger towns and villages
there are extensive JO0ns, or rlepéts of the goods of the wholesale
merchants, who however often sell by retail to strangers.

The shop (dukkrhs) is a recess, quite open to the street, and
generally about (Sit. in width, the iloor being on a level with the
mngabu, or seat in front, on ohieh the owner smokes his pipe,
retails his goods, chats with his friends, and performs his devotions.
The inscriptions over many of the shops do not announce the name
or business of the occupant, but consist of pious phrases, such as
‘0 Allah! thou who opencst the gates of profit!' 'O Allah! thou
who luelpest us in want!' 'Aid from Allah, and rapid victoxyl’
These and similar ejaculations are invariably repeated by thcshop-
keeper as he takes down his shutters in the morning. When he
leaves the shop he either hangs a net in front of it, or begs l neigh-
bour to keep guard over it. The intending pnrehawr seats himself
on the niagtaha, and after the customary salutati0ns proceeds to
mention his wishes. Unless the purchaser is prepared to pay what-
ever is asked, he will flnd that the conclusion of a satisfactory
bargain involves a prodigious waste of time and patience.

As a rule, a much higher price is demanded than will niti-
mately be, accepted, and bargaining is tlicrefaic the universal
custom, " the purchaser knows the proper price of the goods be-
forehand, he offers it to the seller, who will probably remark ‘lmlil’
(it is little), but will nevertheless sell the goods. The seller some-
times entertains the purchaser with coffee from a neighbouring
coffee-shop in order to facilitate the progress of the negotiations.
if the shopkeeper persists in asking too high a price, the purchaser
withdraws, but is often called back and at last offered the article
at a reasonable price. A favourite expression with Oriental shop-
keepers is 'Mudu buhiW Linkc it for nothing), which is of course
no more meant to be taken literally than the well known Tttt bttak'
(my house is thy house). When in the course of the bargaining the
purclmsnr increases his offer in order to make a concession, he
gmlomlly uses the oxpression 'min sluinuk' (for thy sake}.

Nothing raises the traveller so much in the estimation oft)rien-
tals as llnnnnss in resisting imposition; but even the most wary
aml r'xpericnecd must he prepared to pay somewhat higher prices
for everything than the natives themselves. The various prices
mentioned in the Handbook will give the traveller a fair idea of
what may be justly ilmunndcul, and will prove a safeguard against
any serious extortion.
