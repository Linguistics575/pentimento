His description of the Pyramids is borrowed without remark
from other authors. Thus he does not hesitate to repeat that em-
hanhments for the raising of the stones were made of saitimtre,
which was afterwards washed away, or of, bricks, which on the
completion of the pyramid were distributed among private persons.
He also mentions 1llsodopis.

MtsTsdi, one of the Arabian Historians, says that the Pyramids
wore built three hundred years before the flood by SClrid, in con-
sequenoe of the interpretation of a dream which predicted the deluge.
Having assured himself that the world would be repeopled after the
flood, he caused the Pyramids to be erected, the prophecy to he in-
scribed on their stones, and his treasures, the bodies of his an-
cestors, and records of the whole store of knowledge possessed by
his priests to be deposited in their chambers and recesses, in order
that they might be preserved for the her1eiit of those who should
come after the flood. According to a Coptic legend, he caused the
following inscription to be engraved on one of the Pyramids: -
'l , King Stirid, have built these Pyramids and completed them in
81 years‘ Let him who comes after me, and imagines he is a king
to compare with me, attempt to destroy them in 000 (years), It is
easier to destroy than to erect. J have covered them with silk; let
him dare to attempt to cover them with mate 1' A tradition recorded
by the same author resembles the German myth of the nymph of
the Lorelei: - ‘On the western Pyramid is euthronod a beautiful
naked woman with dazzling teeth, who allures desert weyfnrers
from the south and west, embraces them in her arms, and deprives
them of reason’.

'Fair Hhodope, as story tells,

The bright unearthly nymph, who i1wells

'Mid Sunless gold and jewels hid,

The lady of the Pyramid'. (yoozm)

Acrording to other myths the spirit of the Pyramid bears the
form of a boy, or that of a man, who hovers around it burning
incense.

The Pyramids have been frequently visited and described by
Christian travellers to Palestine (in their way through Egypt, The
spurious itinerary of Antony of Piacenza of the 6th cent. states
that he visited the twelve grannies of Joseph (the Pyramids], and
the same notion was entertained by pilgrims as late as the Ath,
15th, and 16th centuries. It is worthy of remark that many of the
mediaeval travellers, even as late as the 17th cent. honour with the
most accurate of the Arabian authors in stating that they saw in-
scriptions on the Pyramids. Thus the knight of Nygenhusen, a
pilgrim who assumed the name of William of Boldensele (14th
cent.) informs us that he saw inscriptions on the Pyramids in dif-
ferent languages, and he gives six \vrses of (me of them in Latin.
