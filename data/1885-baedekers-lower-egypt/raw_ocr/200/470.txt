Israelites made hriehs for Pharaoh. We next pass the small station
of Itamses, which is ehieny used for the traffle connected with the
eonstruetion of the new fresh-water canal Cy. 409).

Near the freshwater canal is situated thehruta-edverred Tell el-Mes-
khirta, the debris at which is not worth visiting. It possesses, huwever,
At large and interesting block of granite, on the front of which is it re-
presentation ef Ilemses IL, enthmued between the gods Ra. and Tum.
The figures were once elaborately executed, but have suirere6 much from
exposure to the air, particularly the heads. 01] the back of the men-
“meat the name of Ramses is inscribed sts times, Lepsius is probably
right in identifying this spot ith the Ramses 0f the Bible, and his
opinion is eorroborated by the existence of huge bricks of Nile mud in
the enclosing wall of the buried city, which still contain an admixture
of chopped straw, recalling the sacred narrative (Exudns, i. 13, 14): -
'And the Egyptians 1nade the children nflsrael to serve with riguur:
And they made their lives bitter with hard heudnge, in mortar, and in
hrick, end in n11 manner of service in the field', -'had (Exodus, T. 6, 7)
Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
their oflieers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make
brink, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves‘.

Beyond this point the train runs through an entirely desert
(reek, passes the small junction of Nefisheh, and reaches -

at (y. 434) presents a beautiful and striking contrast to the de-
Ert Just traversed, especially if some large sea-going steamer

appens to be passing, with its masts overtopping the low houses
Jr the town. lsma‘iliya is a terminal station. To the right of the
"tation lies the Arabian quarter of the town.

The Suez train returns by the same line of rails to stat. Nefisheh
[good remyshinei1t-room, embellished with antlers, stuCed birds,
and other curiosities), and then turns to the S, (left) On the right
we observe a large nursery for trees, the property of ex-Khedive
Isma'il’s mother. The train traverses the desert, frequently skirt-
ing the fresh-water canal, which it crosses immediately 1usyoiu1
Net‘isheh. This canal runs between the railway and the great Suez
Canal, and is navigated by a few small craft only. The Suez Cami],
connecting the Mediterranean and the Ited Sea, and traversed by
large sea-going steamers, and the extensive Bitter Lakes lie on our

material for the construction of the eanah Beyond (102% M.) stat.
Serapeam (p. 433) we obtain a iiruy view of the bluish green Bitter
Lakes (p. 433) on the left. Farther on, the heights of the (lebel
rCuutbid rise on the right. The next station is (1131/: M.) Ir'dyitl.
Near (l25W. 1ro stat. Gcnc/fch we reach the S. and of the Bitter
Lakes. On the left again stretches a vast sandy plain. On the
right, above the lower hills, tower the dark masses of the ’Ahilta
Mix. (p. 415], the outlines of which stand out very prominently
by evening light.

Near U36'/2 M.) stat. Sham/ (y. 43?) the canal is visible for
a short time. Then CIM) MO Sues [see below).
