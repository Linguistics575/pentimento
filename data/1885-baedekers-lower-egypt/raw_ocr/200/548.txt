Tanis is the min of the Bible, where ltloses performed his miracles in the
presence ofPhartrolr. This plase wss doubtless often visited by nmses ll.
who was a pnwerful Guutlnerm‘ and founder of cities, not only when on his
way to battle, and on his return es e victor, but because his presence mast

meieus foreigners resident in these E. districts. The Israel sh i-eehids only
mention the oppression they mideiweht towards the end of their sojourn in
Egypt, Ramses, however, was far from being a capricious tyrant, but wes
a wise, though severe military prince who employed the Semitic settlers
in his kingdnm in the ryrmstrtrction of useful works, in order to prevent
them from endangering his empire. The Jews, perhaps, else assisted in
strengthening the double series oihastions, known as the wall of Sesestris,
but eehstmeted befure the time at Hemses, which closed the Isthmus at
sites and atherwariis obstructed the progress of the emigrants The 'Egyp-
tiah wall' with its forts and frontier fortresses also afforded protection
against the Asiaties, and commended the district of Goshen.

had allied themselves with the warlike inhabitants of the Mediterranean
islands, and had attacked the eeest of Egypt. He succeeded, hhwever,
in suhdning them, and was thus enabled to march victor'uously to Thebes,
where he sensed spacitius buildings to be erected, and encouraged the
scientific labours of the priests. Like his tether, he also orwasiiar1a11yres'uied
at Tants, es the monuments ihtuini us, and seems to have accorded greater
liberty to the Semitie inhehitents of the Delta than his predecessor.
Being, however, less powerful and resolute, he was more exposed to danger
from his Asiatic neighbours than Ramses, who hell not only rendered
them tributary, butllarl Ieagued himself with them by inrermarriages end
treaties of pesee, of whieh valuable ruuttrt‘ls are still preserved. More-

tier of the empire had been oan1pletod. He contirrue6, nevertheless, to
employ the bnudsmen in Gushen. end to keep them in check, as they
might have become very formidable if they had succeeded in uniting their
forces against Egypt. Accordingly, when Moses requested Pharaoh to alluw
him to letd his people into the desert, Nerrenptal1's policy was bu refuse,
