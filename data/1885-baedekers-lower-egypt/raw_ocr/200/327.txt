that IJusgn's head was sent to Damascus, while his body was interred in
the Meshhed Husén on the ICE. Croutier of Persia, to which Persian
pilgrims still resort in great numbers.

Neither Ijasmz nor (reseh wits remarkable fur moral worth m- poli-

have sprung solely from the persecutions to which the whole family of
mi was subjected, coupled with the fact that they were the grandsons
of the prophet. Their misfortunes doubtless at first excited pity, a feel-
ing which led to their being honoured with a kind of 1eUhurtion ' parti-
cularly in Persia, where divine honours had at a still earlier period been
paid to the sovereigns of the country as being descended from the gods. It
is still the cnstoxn in Persia, during the month ofNoyarrem, to represent
the events Which led to 1lusten's death in nine successive theatrical!

of the Nile, Emit]; (or Boulaq), situated hey nd the Isma'iliych
Canal, and formerly an island, has become the river-harbour of the
city of the khalifs. Its narrow streets present a very busy scene,
affording a mom characteristic picture of Oriental life than the
capital. as the inhabitants of distant provinces are proportionally
more numerous here. Natives of Irar-ytir, Wadai, Donkola, Kor-
dofa‘m, and Iiharttsm, and members of the various negro tribes are
seen mingling in picturesque confusion; and popular festivals and
amusements are very frequently provided for their entertainment
in the evening. Goods are conveyed hither from Upper Egypt,
from Nubia, from the interior of Africa, and from the fertile Delta;
and the Nile barges are then laden with other cargoes for the rett1ttr-
journey. The principal quay is nearly opposite the palace of Gezirch,
adjacent to a large timber-yard; and it is most frequented between
October and December, when the rapids of the river are most easily
navigated. The merchants of Cairo congregate here every morning
to make purchases, frequently as early as 7 o‘clock. When there is
a scarcity of goods, they sometimes go out to the vessels in boats;
but when there is no scarcity, the goods are sold by auction in
BtWs. Caravans bringing merchandise also arrive here not unfre-
quently, the most important being from Tunis vii Kufra and Siwa,
and from Wadai and Dir-FO. On one part of the route from Dir-
Fttr, itis said that the caravans obtain no fresh water for twelve days.
