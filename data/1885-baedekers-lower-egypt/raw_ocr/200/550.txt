informed by Exodus . t 17, 'through the my of the land of the Phili-
sunes, eitheugh that was near; for Gorl raid,lestpecadversbure the people
repent when they See War, mul they return to Egypt: Bat God led the
people ehout (heme Etham) through the Way of the wilderness of the hed
sea'. Muses, accordingly, made them leave the mute to Syria, and turn

the mnrlern Bir Makhdal, aneieutly eeiied hiigdei, which, like the Egyle

During his long sojourn in the wilderness, {titer he had slain the Egyp-
tian, their great leader had hectime familiar with all the routes in this
region, and as soon as he observsd the weakness of his people, almost
the only ctmrse open to him we to event the forts, imd turn towards
the b'., in order to lead them round the N. end of the modern Gulf of
Suez, and through the wilderness of Arabia Petrzra to Canean. From
the outset he appears to have had a twetoid ohjeet in view; the first
being to emeheipete the people from the Egyptian yoke with the least
possible loss, and the second to discipline them, and accustum them to
order, ohedienoe, and nabler pursuits in life, in .t locality suited for his
purpose. At 13mm t~the bastioas0 the Wanderers auuordiugly changed
the direction of their mute, and turned to the s. between the W. bank
of the hitter lakes and the E. slope of the Ciehel Al_nned Taken and,
after it long and fatiguing marsh, eucamped at Iâ€™i-H hieuth, the name of
which has been identified with the modern 'Aprtrrt (-in being the Egyp-
tian fur plane). They then ramped for the lest time in Egypt near the
Tled Set, between Migdol, e frontier fori, netr the aueHeut K&mbysu,

- When Pharaoh heard that the people had not crussed the line of fortil'r
cations, and had quittea the mute to Syria, 0n whieh Pay the famous
temple of the desert on Mount Cassius, where Muses had intended saerUhsinar
tn his God, it we natural m him to say - 'they are entangled in the land,
the wilderness hath shut them in'(Exodas xiv. 3). His mistrust was next
mused. --'Aud it was told the king of Egypt that the people tied: itnd the
heart orPharaoh and of his servants wits turned against the people, and

 

Mructiuu. Dindovns .tisn mentiuns an expedition undertaken hy Arttt-
xerxes, King of Persia, against Egypt, during which part of the Persian
army was lost in the sirhnuie lake, with the dangers ofwhich they were
entirely uuaoquaiubsd. The 1nain mute from Egypt to Syria traversed
(he narrow heck of land between the Sirhtmic lake and the Mediterraneat1
(see p. 426). The Jews, after their arrival at the lake, thsteuerrrnyed at
PieIIahi'tloth the. the 'mouth at the ehttsms euvered with reeds'), and
then followed the usual military route between the waters to the shrine
of Ihrral Zephan (see p. 426). They then turned to the s. in consequence
nf the divine command, traversed the desert of BMh' (see p. A26), .tnd
arrived in Mime days at JIarrah (i.e. hitter), er the three hitter lakes in
the isthmus (see p. 433). They proceeded thence to Elim, Which is
dmihtiess identical with the Aarlim m- Tentiim the. town of the fishes)
mentioned by the mttunmeuts, h piece situated near the Gulf of Suez.
The Egyptians, however, in the etturse of the pursuit, us they were tre-
versiug the narrow neck of land between the Sirhunic lake and the Ned-
itertanesu, were overtaken by e sturm tuul inundation, lost their way,
fen iutu the Sirhoiiie htke, and were drowned. The occurrence of such
Mods in this distriet is borne out by tur observalion of Strhhm that a
greet flood took place during his residvnee in this region near Mount
onsine tsee Note, p. 426), trverrOwing the country to such an extent,
thet Mmml Casius appeared like an island, and that the road to Pales.
tine near it Was navigable for vessels. The sen mentioned in the iiihie,
Iltrnugh which the Israelites phesed, would, according to this theory, md
he the Red Sen but the Sirbunic lake'.
