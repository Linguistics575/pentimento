418 Route 6. SUEZ,

A little farther tf.tho N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water
Canal fp. 400)t, the i1ow of Which into the conduits, as well as
its discharge into the sea, is regulated by means of a large lock.
The level of the canal is here 61/e ft. above that of the Red Sea.
The large buildings to the N, of it are the English Naval Hospital
and the ogine-houso of the 'Compagnie des Eauz.' To the E. of
the canal is the large camping-ground for the caravans coming
from Arabia, which sometimes number as many as a thousand
camels and present a most interesting sight. On the way from the
kiesque of the Khedive to the canal are a number of salt pools,
sometimes tinged red by innumerable microscopically small
crabs, which, in the morning especially, diiruse an odour reh3In-
bling that of violets. The small neighbouring eminence is called
the Beduins" Hill. Opposite, to the E., beyond the railway, is the
Arabian sailors' quarter, consisting of dirty mud-hovels.

A massive 'Pier, about w, M. in length, resting on a sub-
structure of artiflif1al stone, 48 ft. in width, extends into the sea
to the S. of the town, Ieading to the 'snorbour. (Boat thither,
see p. 415.) The foundation of the pier and of the whole of the
quays rests upon a sandhank stretching out from the land in the
shape of a hook, and heightened by the addition oflarge quantities
of earth dredged from the S. cm! of the canal. The deposits of
earth thus made also enabled the cane] company to embank an
area of about 50 acres, on which the arsenal, magazines, work-
shops, and buildings connected with the docks were erected.
The pier affords a pleasant and interesting promenade (donkey
1-2 fr., according to the time), commanding beautiful views oftho
bay and the mountains enclosing it. At low tide the outline of the
sandhank is distinctly traceable,

'The 'Atatm hits to the W. of the town looked as it composed of
a liquid mixture of molten garnets and "nethysts. They were reilected
in the water at their base, the ebb of which gradually disclused more
and more of the ramparts and buildings around the harbour and the
entrance to the canal. The lofty pier, carrying the railway from the
anuhuragc of the large vessels to the town, uvertopped all the other
buildings. the sandlrsalcs, and the deep pools left isolated by the
retiring tide. Men riding on donkeys and camels were passing along the
pier, and the lower the sun sank, the sharper did their outlines become
aueinst the glowing horizon, until at length they looked like black
shadows an a transparent golden yellow and violet wall of glass. At
tohgth the darkness closed in, and the roads were shrouded in ntghe'.

At the end of the pier we tirst reach a small dock of the Canal
Company on the left, with a lighthouse (white light), beyond which
