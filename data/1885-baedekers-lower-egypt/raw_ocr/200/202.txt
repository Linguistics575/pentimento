Paurls or {times bearing inscriptions of this eharar- pnduve
wry rich and pleasing appearance. When viewed from a moderate
distance, especially if enhanced by colouring. the broad ehameters
stand out with great mm. The ground then resembles a network
of late, the delicate lines of the arabesques being indistinguish-
able except on close inspection. Sultan Wsan's mosque (p. 200)
contains a remarkably handsome frieze of this description The
large and bold characters on the mosques or private houses whiuh
strike the eye of the traveller are almost invariably texts from the
herein. while historical notices in a small running character are
OVROH inscribed on marble slabs over the entrances and the lattice-

iuseriptious' lso occasionally occur in the halls of the interior.
The uhsorver can scarcely fail to be struck with the apparently
caprivious wayin which this omamentationis distributed, the artist
luning sometimes lavished the whole riehne s of his ambesquns
upon certain spots to the neglect of others. IN hon this peculiarity
is more closely examined, it will he found that the parts thus
favoured are - (r) the Portals, which are embellished with a
framework of rich friexes, with rosettes to mark ccrtainpoiuts,
with artistic sculpturiux on the arrhitrave, and with pendants in I
the ceiling of the nivhe; (2) the 1limucts, which it was customary
to place over or adjacent to the portals, but seldom from strlmtuml
nmtivcs; (3) the external surfaces of the Dome7 whirl are sometimes
revered with arabesques, and sometimes with roil- mouldings
or wreaths; (s) the igihla, ssith its handsome border, its capitais
and columiw, which are often rich and beautiful, its tine mosaies,
its miniature pseudo-arcades; (5) the Pendcnts in the interior of
Inausolemus; (ii) the Ceilings; (7)the )Iamhar (pulpit), which is
partly in stone and partly in wood. The lattiee-work, windows,
doors. couches or sofas (dikkels), lanterns, and lamps are also miich
ornamented. These inst are sometimes made of very curious
onanwlled glass, bat few are now to be found in the mosques,
Cotrusr does not perhaps play quite so conspicuous a part in the

The zmuml of the decorative inscriptions is frequently deep blue,
while the letters are usually gilded. (m the whole, however.
