cabinet, the soul of which was Arabi Bey, the cucrgctie min-
ister of war, at once proceeded, without receiving the cow
seat of the thdivc, to pass several measures intended to
diminish the European iailuerire in the political and ttmm-
cial administration of the country. The consuls general
were assured that no danger threatened the Europeans, but
were also told that any foreign intervention in the internal
affairs of Egypt would be resisted by force, The Khedive,
to whom both France and England had promised proteetiou,
declared that he would Wer a determined resistance to the
measures of the cabinet. At the end ofMay the British and
French fleets made their appearance before Alexandria. 1n
the middle of June serious disturbances broke out in that
town , in the course of which many Europeans were killed,
while the others found refuge on board the ships. On July
11th and 12th Alexandria was bombarded by the British
fleet, and on Sept. 13th the fortified camp of Arabi at Tell
el-Kehir was stormed by a British force under Sir Garnet
Wolscley. Arabi and his associates were captured and sent
as exiles to Ceylon. Since these events English iuflueneo
has been paramount in Egypt. In the autumn of 1883 a
wide-spread rebellion broke out among the Nubian tribes
of the Stulin under the leadership of Mohammad Ahmed,
the 'so-tyelled ‘Mahdi’ (p. 153), which threatened to be fatal
to the Egyptian supremacy in the St1din. Au Egyptian
army of 10,000 men under an Englishman named Hiths
Pasha was annihilated in Nov., 1883, by the Mahdi's forces,
and a second expedition of 3500 regular troops of the Egyp-
tian army, led by Baker Pasha, was also completely defeated
at Tokar in February, 1884. On the 18th of the same month
General Gordon , after a perilous ride across the desert, cn-
tered Khartt1m, which he had uutertaken to save from the
Mahdi; while on Mar. 1st and Mar. 13th the rebel tribes
under the Mahdi’s lieutenant Osman Digna were defeated at
El-Teb and Tamzmieb by the British troops under Graham.
The Mahdi himself, however, still maintained his position
near Kbirr.ttsrn, and towards the close of the year a second
British expedition (of 7000 men) was sent out under Wol-
seley to rescue Gordan.

Wolseley selected the Nile route for this expedition in
preference to the shorter but more dangerous desert route
horn 80utikin to Berber, but the ascent of the river proved
a very tedious operation and it was not till the beginning of
1885 thathe was able to concentrate his troops at Korti,
between the third and fourth cataracts (a little above Fi,
Dabhc on the Map at p. 30). The Nile here makes an enorm-
ous bend, and a detachment of 1500 men was now sent on
