observe, slightly projecting into the road, the >xG!mnir ei-3htiri

same founder. The two facades, dating from the second half of
the 10th cent. of the Hegim, and presenting a very harmonious

with Ilnid figures, A shirt of the Prophet brought by Sultin el-
Gluiri from Mecca, was formerly shown at this masque, but it
is now said to be preserved in the Citadel7 where it is shown once

have been skilfully restored by the architect of the Welsf, a German
named Franc-my, and are to be extended and adapted to contain
the viceroyal library (11. 269].
