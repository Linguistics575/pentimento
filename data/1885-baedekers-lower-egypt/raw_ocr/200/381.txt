The Gebel ol-Ahhmar, or L'ed Mountain, wh sh rises to the N.
or (101ml (Hyuhshr (p. 335 most conveniently visited from ‘Ahhit-
siwh 0n 1louhey-baek; p. 332), and connected with it by means of
a substratum " limestone, consists of a very hard meioceue cou-
glomemte of sand, pebbles, and fragments of fossil wood, cemented
together by means of silicic acid, and coloured red or yellowish
brown with oxide of iron. According to Frees, the two eolossal sta-
tues at Thebes are composed of rock from the 'Red Mountain'. For
many centuries the quarries hem have yielded excellent and dur-
able mtllstortes, and the neighbouring huge heaps of debris afford
abundant material for the, construction of the macadamiscd roads
of Cairo and Alexandria. Simiiar meiocene formations, which owe
their origin to an eruption of hot springs impregnated with silihie
acid, occur to the S.E. of the Gebel el-Ahmar, in the direction of
the PotriMd Forest, and even in a sitlc-vaney of the Sehel Ch/tslit.
A railway now encircles the whole of the hill, being used for carry-
ing away the oonglorruerate and the shbjacent limestone yielded by
its quarries, Messrs, Fraas and Unger have found a few examples
of freshwater conchylia among the fossils of the Gebel el-Ahmar.

The {ed Mountain undoubtedly nwes its origin to an eruption of
silicic springs, which forced their way tlurocgl1 the tertiary limestone
tuck; and to simil. agency is prolrably to he ascribed the mad-woleaar,
near Abfl Zn’bul, beyond Jorralpth, 4-5 hrs. to the N. of this point. A
little to the E, of Aut Za'bel, ou the borders of the very smooth slupe
hr the sandy desert, protrudes it black basaltic tum rock, which has nut

eunditime cxhetiy msemhl'mg the black blocks lyingmi the E. side orthe
HI-cht Pyrruntd of Gizeh, As there are traces of very ancient quarries
near Abii Ta'bei, these blocks may possihly have been hrought thence.

The services of a guide may he dispensed with, as every dtmkey-bny
is well acquainted with the route to the Little Petrified Forest, but a.
visit to the 'Great', near the Bir ei-Fehmeh, can hardly be aeuomplislsed
without the aid of a weu-infurmed dmgomen.
