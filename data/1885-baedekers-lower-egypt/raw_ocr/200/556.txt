On thc margin of the narrow plain of the coast, to the left of the
route, rise curiously formed, yellowish, limestone hills piled up in
strata, oue apparently resting on gigantic, shell-shaped pedestals
which have been formed by the action of the water. At the s. end
of these hills rises the Jebel el-Nokhel, ahoid eminence abutting so
closely on the sea that it is washed by the waves at high water, in
which case the traveller must cross it by a path ascending in steps.

Beyond this hill we reach a plain, called El-hhrrkha, of consid-
erable extent', and not destitute of vegetation. It is bounded on
the N.E. by the Jebel el-Markhu C590 ft.), a black hill, contrasting
strongly with its light-eoloured neighbours. Proceeding to the S.E.
for 21/4 hrs. more, we at length reach the more mountainous part
of the peninsula, which we enter by the Hanak el-Lalt'am, a valley
varying in width, and flanked with barren reeks ofreddish and
grey tints. After 3/4 hr. we reach the mouth of the Wadi Ba'bu' on
the N., which is commanded by the dark Jebet Jhr'bar, while on
the S. (right) begins the Wadi Shelal. Traversing the latter for
h It, we neat enter theWÃ©di Budra, The winding route ascends
gradually, We pass several mountain slopes resembling huge walls
of blocks of stone, tvrtiiicially constructed. Farther on we observe
grey and red granite rocks amidst other formations. In every direc-
tion lie long heaps of black, volcanic slag, strongly resembling the
refuse from foundries. Beside them lie numerous fragments of
brown, grey, and red stone, including felsite porphyry, which is
remarkable for thebright, brielered eelourofthe orthoelase felspar.
Along the slopes rise cliiTs and pinnacles of various colours and
grotesque forms. Theroute leads from one basin into another, each
of which has a horizon of its own, until 01/4 hr.') we come to a
frowning harrier of rock Which seems to preclude farther progress.
We soon rum, however, that a steep bridle-path ascends in 1/4 lsr.
to the Nal.& el-Budra for 'pass of the sword's point', 1263 ft.), by
which we surmont the apparent barrier. This pass was traversed
in ancient times by the beasts of burden which transported the
minerals obtained in the Widi Maghira to the sea; it then full
into disrepair, but was restored in 1803 byaliajar Maedouald, who
made an unsuccessful search for turquoises in the old mines. The
summit of the pass commands l fine rietrospeistivo view of the wild
Widi Pmdra, the lifts Abii Zeilimehy the Jehel 1.rammirn Karim,
and the sea. Beyond the pass the valley is ealied the Wadi Nulab
('l-liudm, through which we descend in 1% hr. to the Wadi Skin
a. winding valley enclosed by rocks of red granite.

We, soon reach the \lei Umm 7hem0n on the left, where
Messrs, Palmer and Wilson (in 1869) discovered mines similar to
thuse at Maghira, The [3/4111.) deli Mayhvim next IliVUrges to
