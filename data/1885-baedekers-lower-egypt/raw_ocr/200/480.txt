422 Routes, THE RED SEA.

large steamers is in the middle of the sea, Which is free from these
reefs. but tire smaller Arabian vessels always steer close to the shore,
with the configuration of which their ohptains are well acquainted, in
order that they mny mu into one of its numerous creeks (them) on the
slightest threatening of bad weather. The Amhs adopt the Cimtious
policy of never sailing at night or in stormy weather, unless compelled;
and when they are obliged tn cross the sea, they always wait for settled
wuathen In spite of the miserable construction of their vessels, ship-
wrecks :tre accordingly of rare occurrence.

Nu rivers fall into the Red Sea, but at number of intermittent rain.
torrents descend from its hanks. The water is ofa beautiful blue eoiour,
changing tu pitle green where there are shoals " reefs near the surface.
No satisfrretory reason " the modern name of the sen hits yet been
given. The th'il'erenee between high nnd low tide is 3V2-7 feet. The
prevalent wind in the N. pm at the sea, particularly in summer, is the
N. wind, and in the s. part the S.E. wind in winter, and the NW. in
summer, The set is therefore unsuitable for large sailing vessels, which,
when bound for India, always sail mund the Cape of Good Hope.

The eossts at the Red Sea consist of barren rack or send, and are
almost entirely uninhabited. A little way intend the mountains rise to
a height rd 4000-7600 feet. So far back as the time of Solomon the nztv~
igatitm of the Red Sea wtu, of considerable importance, hnd several of
the seaports, sunh " Berenike and Myes llormos, were celebrated. Since
the opening of the Suez Canal the sen has been regularly traversed by
the Indian steamers, which run direct from Suez to Arlen. The traffle
between the different places on the coast is carried on by means of the
Arabian ctmsting vessels (.kayrw, barge; sumb0.k, vessel af medium size
with a short cutwuter; buyhleh, the same, without cutwater; den, or dam,
a vessel of emisidemhie size with tr prodigious development of stem;
wmgeh, the same, with a long entweter). Regulat- suymmuuicau'ou be,.
tween some of the more important places is also kept up by Egyptian
steamers, which ply Fortnightly between Sues, Jedda, Sonakiu, and
Musau'a. Steamers of the Austrian Lloyd and others eisa ply between
Suez and Jedda at the time of the lleccan pilgrimage.

Kes r (1200 iuheh,) is the harbour of Upper Egypt, from which it is
AVE da s'juumsey in a straight line. It was formerly one of the chiefoutlets
for the products of Egypt, particularly grain, and was also the starting-
point of numerous pilgrims, but since the opening of the Suez railway
it has lost nearly an its importance. It was tr place of no importance
down to the thut de de of the present century, when, under the auspices
ot' Muhammad 'Ali, it increased to a town of 7000 inhabitants. It is now
a neglected piece, as an the pilgrims, except the poorest, now prefer the
mute by Suez. Even its grnin trade, its only other resuuree, hes greatly
declined, as steamers now convey cum to the IJejars at a cheaper, rate
than it can he obtained from Knish. The steamers rarely touch here,
and the ti-efhe is eenied ou by native craft enly, which ply almost
exclusively tn Jerhin, Yenbar, end Wejj.
