name of one of his successors, About 20 paces farther on, a large
broken obelisk lies prostrate on the ground. Ten other obelisks
near it, in a still more shattered condition, testify to the ancient
glory of the city. The leftiest of them measured 46 and 49 ft.
in height, and nearly 5 ft. in thickness. Some of them consisted of
verydark, and others of tight-lured syenite. Even the great
temple of imperial Thehes contained fewer obelishs than this vast
I sanctuary. Alt these ediiirres owed their origin to Ramses ll. The
museum at Ihilili contains the finest of the Ilyksos sphinxes
(p. 298) found here, while four others. more or less mutilated, still
remain here. Besides these there is a Sphinx in the Egyptian
style, dating from the 19th Dynasty. The visitor should also
notice an interesting little chapel , resembling a sareoplragus, and
composed of a single block of a granuious kind of alabaster. The
cavity is not much wider than the thickness of the sides. At the
back is represented the triad of Ammon, Tum, and Nut, Another
colossal statue here, composed of rose-colonred or almost purple
granite, and 2t Hon-headed statue of Sekhet were also erected by
Ramsesl]. Adjacent is l second statue of Ramses H., executed in
a ilinty kind of sandstone, and coloured Farther on, towards the
S., we next observe a large granite 'stele' with tiueiy executed
inscriptions, stilt easily legible, although damaged, mentioning a
mode of reckoning dates which has been met with nowhere else.
They are in honour of a distinguished oftleia1 of the time of Ram-
ses IL, and hear the date of 400 years after the Pharaoh Aset-
pehti, a Hyksos monarch. A considerable way beyond this moritr-
ment is another excavated hollow containing fragments of a
temple, including several remarkably fine columns with curious
palm capitals. These capitals, which, like the columns themsch es,
are of r0ge-e0loured granite, are narrower at their bases than the
shafts on which they rest. Alt the columns, now overthrown, are
remarkable for slemlerness of form, and the bases on whinh they
stood were no less than 3ft. in height, being higher than any
others yet discovered in Egypt. Towards the 3.1%. are several
round blocks, probably dating, according to the two inscriptions,
from the period of the Ptolemies. Leaving the hollow containing
the palm columns, we ascend without difticulty to the tomb of a
sluikh which commands the best survey of the ruins ofTanis.
Around the grey plateau of the town rise a series of hills, nearly
forming acircle, and once coveredwith dwelling-houses. Thcruius
of the temple form a mass of cubical blocks and black and red
fragments of obelisks, while the heaps of rubbish are mingled
with innumerable ehips of broken pottery. The empty houses
resemble naverns7 and show that tho Tauitcs were contented with
dwellings of very moderate size. The limestone 'stelc' discovered
here by Dr. Lepsius in 1800, known as the Tablet ofTunirs, or Decree
of Canopus, is now preserved in the museum at 1hilili (p. 313).
