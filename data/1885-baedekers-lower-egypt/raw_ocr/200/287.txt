The chief occupation uf the pipe-makers is the boring of pipe-stems,
Their primitive appamtuq cnnsisls " an instrument resembling a bow
with which they turn :1 wooden cylinder terminating in MI iron spike.
The string of the how is pressed against the wood, and the bow is moved
to and fro, somewhat like that of avioliu, 811 as to turn the hmrer. Not-
withstanding the simplicity of this tooL and although they merely tcatly
the stem with their bands, they execute their Work with surprising rat-
pidity and accuracy - The same kind of implement is used by the
turners. The wood on which they are working is secured on two nails
in two parallel upright pieces of Wood and turned with the bow with
the right hand, while the work is done with it chisel held in the lert.

Leaving the bazaars for :1 short time1 we may now turn to the
right, and follow the broad, newly constructed street to the Bit e1-
Kigii CPI. 2), " 'House of the Judge'. The appointment of tcit.ti is
made by the government at Constantinople, and is usually bestowed
on favourites, as it is said to be a very lucrative post. la the large
court on the right is an open verandah, resting on columns with
Carly Arabian capitals [tnkhta btvA; p 186). Part of the building
still dates from the time of Saladin (1193). Within the building.
the entrance to which consists of an open verandah, the high holds
his court on Thursdays. This court was formerly the supreme tri-
bunal of the country, but its jurisdiction isaowlin1ited to cases in
which the law laid down by the Iiorin is to be administered, and
particularly to actions between married persons. The large extent
to which the court is patronised shows that polygamy is not perd-
cularly conducive to domestic harmony.

Crossing the court, and passing through the gate opposite, we
next follow the windings of tho narrow lane to the left as far as .1

As we shall have to traverse the Gameliyeh ou our way to the
Tombs of the Iihalifs, we need not now visit it]

Where the street divides, beyond the above- mentioned sentry,
we keep to the left until we regain the Snk en-Nahhasln near a
fountain (Scbil 'Abder- ltahmen Kikhya; p. 279) We then follow
the bazaar- street to the right to the Bib el- Futv‘th (p. 280), and
proceed thence to the left to the Rue Neuve pnski', 112‘3.

The above- named bazaars are the most important at Cairo, the
others being unattractive We may, however, add the names of
some of the other trades, as given by Mr. Lane: - TCsgir, cloth
and stuff merchants; khurdugt', dealers in iron goods and small
