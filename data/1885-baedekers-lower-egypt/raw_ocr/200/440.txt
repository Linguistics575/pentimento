The whole of the 2110.1 was excavated and explored by Ma-
riette, who in 1850 found a number of sphinses from Sakkftm
in private gardens, and was thus led to conjecture that they be-.
longed to the 8erapis Temple mentioned by Straho and in several
Greek papyri. The passage in Strabo runs thus: - 'There is also
a temple of Serapis there in l very sandy place, so that mounds of
dust are heaped up by the wind, by which the sphiuxes are either
buried up to their heads or half concealed, whence one may Rn-
derstand the danger incurred by a person going to the temple and
overtaken by a gust of wind'. - In the course of his excavations
M. Mariette first came upou the Sphinx Avenue, which led from
tho Apis tombs to a Sorapoum of the Greek period. It terminated
on the E. side, where the chief entrance was situated, in a semi-
circle formed by eleven statues of Greek philosophers and poets,
which now grace the Louvre. The narrow approach (Dramas) was
flartked by adouhle wall, on which stood the figures of animals
mentioned above.

The Greek Serapeam, which was in the best preservation, was 11 small
example of the simple form ora Greek temple 'in tvnlis', 11111 consisted
(l a calm and a prcH1a0s, approached by a Mght of steps, with trim e111-
inthian culumns between the "anue' or pilasters of the f 'de. Adjoining
this Greek temple stood an Egyptian chapel with walls sloping inwards
and a cnncitve cornice, Which Was once adorned with the fuse statue of
the Apis bull now preserved in the Louvre. la the sand under the pave-

The upper part of an Egyptian Serapeum, which seems to have
been built in the usual form of the Egyptian temples (with pylons,
anterior court, etc.), was also discovered here, but 1121s partly de-
stroyedor overthrown in the course ofthe excavations. These scanty
remains, together with those of the Greek Serapeum, are now Cpoin-
