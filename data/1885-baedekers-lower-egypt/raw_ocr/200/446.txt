Three Entrances CPI. A), the side-walls of which are built of
blocks ofstone inclining slightly inwards, lead to the first small au-
terior Court (PL JJ), which contains the remains of two pillars.
0n the E. wall (PL u) are represented the oiNring of gifts; on the
S. wall, to the left of the entrance (Pl.
b), a poaltry-rard and the fattening
cf geese (see below); and to the right

fish in traps. These three scenes
are small and damaged by expos-

Ti [see above), above which are mu-
tilated hieroglyphics mentioning sev-
era] of bis titles. We next enter the
Great Court (P1. C), an extensive
quadrangle, which was once covered
with a roof borne by twelve square
pillars. The rooflms disappeared, but
some of the pillars are still standing.
This hall is said to have been the
scene of the rites performed in honour
of the deceased and the saeriiiee of
victims. In the centre of the court
was sunk the mummy shaft (PL d),
not perpendicularly, as usual, but in
an oblique direction, communicating
with the tomb-ehambcr below, where
a sarcophagus without inscription was
found.

On the N. side (Pl. e), which is

tirre of cattle, and the conveyance of
