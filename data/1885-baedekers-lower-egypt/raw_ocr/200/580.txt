510 Route 10. JEBEL 1nysa. From Sues

The Jehel Milsa and Rh: e.sd.1afyd.

The ascent of the Jehel mira occupies 3hrs., and presents no dirlumley.
The start siurald be made ahuut 5 a. m. or earlier, Five diMreat paths
lead to the top, but the twn following are almost exclusively used. The
more interesting, bat also more fatiguing, ascends the old pilgrimage-steps
(see below), while the other begins in the midi Shu'eih, and ascends
the Jehel mist by e circuitous route. This last was to have been made
practieahte for the carriage of rAths Pasha, who intended building himself
a villa on Mt. Sinai; but he was assassinated before the completion of
the work (p. 505). Those who wish to ascend the Jehel Mesa and Itis
e f t separately may return by the second of these routes; in this
e " ey may remain long enough on the Jebcl Nttsa to enjoy the
u1vgnititseqt spectacle of a sunset. By starting immediately alter the
disappearance of the sun, and walking rapidly, the traveller Will have
time and light enough to descend to the cypress plain (Chhpel " Elijah],
whence, with the aid of a guide, he may reach the monhstery in an
hour without difhrsrvlty, even in the dark, by renewing the mail of ‘Ahhas
Pasha. The pilgrims‘ steps should on no account he descended M night.
If necessary the night may he spent in the chapel of Elijah, in which
case the monks provide blankets.

One or two of the monks or Jebeliyeh (Arabian servants (if the
monastery) act as guides, cnnyiug the necessary provisions, and render-
ing hetp in the ascent of the Rite eHiarsir.

Those who ascend by the pilgrims' steps quit the monastery by
a small side-gate in its w. wall, and mount the bare granite of the
w. side of the Shu'aih valley, by a path whioh gradually becomes
steeper, but is unattended with danger. This path, which, like
many of the Oriental churches, is said to date from the time of the
Empress Helena, was probably constructed for the pilgrims in the
6th or 7th cent In 20 min. we reach a small spring Which contains
the same quantity of water in winter and summer, and whore, ae-
cording to the Arabs, Moses once tended the sheep of Jethro, whom
they can Shu'aib. The monks, on the other band, declare that it
issued from the rock in consequence of the prayers of the holy abbot
8at1garius, when the wells in the monastery dried up, and that it is
a cure for diseases of the eye. In 12 min more We come to a hut,
styled the Chapel of Mary, which is said to have been erected in
memory of a vision of the Tirgim The monks, according to the
story, Were so terribly plagued with vermin, that they determined
to leave the monastery, and ascended the mountain in procession,
intending to quit the holy places. Ou the way, however, on the
site of this hut, the Virgin appeared to them, promised to deliver
them from their tortmu1tors, and commanded them to return. They
obeyed, and found that all the vermin hatl 6isappeared. The travel-
ler, how0v0r, even at a late period of the year, will have abundant
opportunity of observing that the foe has since returned. --Farther
up, the route crosses a small ravine, and then passes through two
rude gates. Monks are said formerly to have been stationed here for
the purpose of receiving from the pilgrims, who wished to take
the sacrament on the top of Mt. Sinai, a iuyrtuleate that they had
attended the confessional in the monastery. At the Mst gate they
were hiriulei1arueeipt, wldeh they gave up at the second. Aftetat few
