to Sinai. WSDI TAYYIBEH. IO. Route, 480

The hot springs are situated on the N. side of the mountain, facing
the see; they are easily found without a guide, owing tothe steam
which envelopes them. There is agood btrtlsiag-pltuoe mute point where
they flow into the sea from the white rock, bat the httther Shuuld beware
" sharks. Higher up, the springs are very hut, When the temperature
of the air was (ltr, that of the water was found to be 153”. The water
is slightly saline; according to an analysis made by J. Russegger at
Vienna, it contains soda, lime, talc, chloride oi hydrogen‘ and sul-
pharis acid.

The route continues to follow the Willi Ignwéseh for 11/4 hr.Y
and then crosses the W0di eth-Thzil, a valley of considerable
breadth, which descends to the sea towards the SW. in the [arm of
a narrow gorge. In about 1/2 u. more we reach the Wddi Shebe"lceh.
In less than 1 M. moxe we reach the junction of this valley "ith
the W&li el-Ijomr, through which (to the Ir) runs the route to
Sinai via ?urbirt. el-Kluidem, described at p. 524.

We follow the valley descending towards the sea, now called
the Widi Tayyiheh, with numerous windings, some re111arkable,
reek formations, several springs 0i'barl water, and a few stunted
palms. The route traverses a number of round hollws of nonsid-
emble size, enclosed amphitl1eatriealfy by barren slopes of whitish
grey sand and by reeks. The steep sides of these basins look
from a distance as if they had been made "tiheially. The area
in the centre is often so completely enclosed that no outlet is
visible, Each quarter of an hour we obtainadiiferent view, though
the colouring is always the same, A striking exception to the
last remark is afforded by the very curious appearance of the Jebet
Tuyin/ch, situated near the sea, and consisting of oblique strata of
different colours; the lowest of these is of :1 golden yellow tint, the
next is red, which is felhnwed by a rusty black stratum, while
the whole is surmounted by a yellow layer.

After iahhr. the valley expands, and we approach the open
sea, washing the banks of the sandy plain of E't-3fel.dir, After a
walk of Ihhr. along the coast we reach the Ra: Aha Zenimeh,
which still bears the tomb of the saint, and affords nbeautiful
and sheltered ts'aruping-gsound. At this spot (more prohztbly than
in tlreWidi Tayyiheh, as supposed by some authorities) was situated
the encampment of the Israelites on the lied Sea(Nutnb. xxxiii.
IO). The old harbour is still oeeasioa11y used by tho fishing-boats
of the Arabs. In ancient times the roads, by which ore and stone
were brought from the mines of the Widi Naghitra and Yrbta.t e1-
Iihidem for farther conveyance by water, converged here.

Beyond Abi Zenimeh the mute at first skim the sea for
11/2 hour. Travellers usually walk here, and amuse themselves by
picking up shells, as Sinai travellers have done from time imme-
mariah This custom ismentioued hy Thiudmarus in the 13th cunt.,
by Fahri, and by Breidcnbaeh, the last of whom says, that 'various
kinds of shells are to he found on the coast of the Red Sea, and
also white coral, and many beautiful stones', probably meaning by
