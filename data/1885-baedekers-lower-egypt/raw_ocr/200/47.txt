TOBACCO 27

While much caution and firnmess are desirable in dealing with
tho people, it need hardly be added that the traveller should avoid
being too exacting or suspicions. He shoot bear in mind that

children, whose waywardrress should excite compassion rather than
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliuess
of disposition. He should, moreover, do his utmost to sustain the
well established reputation of the ‘kilmeh frenytyels', the ‘werd of a
Frank', in which Orientals are went to Platte implicit eontidenee.

Cjgar-smokers will find it very diftieult to become accustomed
to the Oriental tobacco, but they will find tolerable cigar-shops at
Alexandria and Cairo, most of which have been established quite
reeentiy. As a general rule smokers are recommended to carry with
them, both in going to and returning from Egypt, as little tobacco
as possitle, especially if they travel by the overland route, as a
rigorous search is often made and aheavy duty exacted, both at
the Egyptian, and at the French, Austrian, and Italian frontiers,
Travellers returning to England direct, with their luggage booked
through, are allowed half-a-pound of tobacco or cigars free ofEng-
iish duty, or they may bring three pounds on payment " the duty

(15-90 h. per ekha), which is cut less regularly, and contains parts
of the stalk, is considered less drying to the palate than the Tur-
Kish. It is of two kinds, the (c0rtrni, or light-brown, and the gebeli,
or dark-brown, a mixture of which may be nsed. The latter, which

it is ehietly grown (Lidiliiyeh), but that name is not applied to it
