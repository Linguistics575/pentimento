Continuing to follow the same street, we cross the new B'ouu-.
mlrd Shéklt RiMn, and beyond it the Boulevard Mohammed 'Ali
(see p. 3160). Beyond the latter we pass an open space, on the
right side of which is the Pulacc of sllurr.u"tr Pasha CPI. 8,5; un-
attractive), and enter the street named after the dei’ el-Bent,
(P1. 40; ‘mosque of the girls'), which rises on the right. 011 the
left, a little beyond the mosque, and oh the farther bank of the
canal, is the entranuc to the house of Shékh Mufti, or Shélth ul-let‘tm
CPI. 95), the interesting interior of which is shown by special
permission only (p. 2dlj. The street then runs on towards the N.,
in a straight direction, and terminates in the Muski, near the Hétel
du Nil (p. 23ij.

If we leave the Palace of Jranyir Pasha (see above) on the left,
and follow a lane leading to the 8.12, (right) corner of theplace called
after the old gate Ihlb el-Khalk, we reach after about 500 paces more
the (left) old towu-gate Bib ez-Zuweleh CPI. D, 2), built of solid
blocks of stone, and resembling the Bib el-Frrttsl.r (p. 280)inp1an.
The S, side consists of two huge towers; by that to the right are a
number of stone and wooden halls, probably dating from the Marne-
lulce period. Thmin Boy, the last of the Gircassian sultens of Egypt,
was hanged outside this gate by Snlt.in Selim IL, on 19th Rabir el-
Awwel, 9‘13 of the Hegira (15th April, 1517; p. 243). This gate
is also called Btib irt-ilrrttauserti, from the old tradition that the most
highly revered saint ISuth’r el-Mutaw0llt has his abode behind the
western gate, where he sometimes makes his presence known by a
gleam of light. A beggar who spends the day here endeavours, by
loudly invoking the saint, to excite the compassion of passers-by.
From the inner (E) gate hang bunches ut'hair, teeth, shreds of
clothing, and other votive offerings placed here by siek persons
who hope thereby to be cured of their diseases.

Passing through the gate, we enter the street called Sultkurfyeh
(p. 25O, where on the left we observe the handsome portal 0f the
Gémi' el-Muaiyad CPI. 57), A mosque which is connected with the
gate of the city. The interior is undergoing restoration, and is,
thereforc, not easily accessible. This mosque was erected by Sultan
Shékh ehhlahumdi Muaiyad (1412-21), of the dynasty of the
Cireassian Narnehrkes, who had once been the leader of the
