lies on the right hank of the ancient Bucolic or Phac11itie arm
of the Nile, now the Damietta branch, from which diverges the
Ashrnttn or ?-aghoygar ('the little') cnnat, Next to Tanta, Maatst"tra
is the most important provincial town in the Delta; it is the
residence of the Mudir of the province of Jfa.kaWyeh, and is the
thief depét of the hread-stuffs, cotton, indigo, tobaceo, hemp, and
flax which this part of the Delta produces. There are several
large mat1r1faotories here, and many European inhabitants, ehieily

Inseam. Iranspira (i. e. 'the Tieturious0, a ctunpttratively modern
place, was founded by Sn} att Melik eLKami! in 1220, after the cuptnre of
Damiette by the Christians (p. M3), and dauhuess as an trdviriuagerrus
substitute for that place in e strategic point of view, as it lies securely
ensconced in the angle formed by the Damietta arm 0f the Nile and the
Ashmtiu Canal. The new furtress. according to the chronicles of Jor-
drums, was called New namietta, tn which the epithet of Jraayttra, or
'the vivytorious', Was afterwards added. Melik erktunil constructed the
place with great care, and threw a bridge, strengthened with iron, across
the Nile, which served both for the purpose of cummuuieatinr, with the
opposite bank and as a barrier to prevent the Christians from forcing
their way farther up the Nile. The first serious attack made on 11th-
m was by the Crusaders under Louis rx. of France in 1250, After en-
untering great difiiculties they succeeded in crossing the Ashm0n Canal,
and tm the first day of hsttle, after a severe struggle, they were evexh
tually victorious. In the neighbourhood or" Irauyirrr,huwever, they were
repeatedly defeated by the young Sultan cl-Mo'agzam 'J.'nrrrmshah. Their
fleet was destroyed, trud 'fam'rue-fever' hrokc out. Negociations of
peace proved fruitless, and when the “Hated Crusaders attempted to
escape they were intercepted by the vigilant Turks, who thinned their
ranks terrrihly and captured the king with his brother Charles uf Anjou
and a number of the knights attending them. Louis thus eqireases him-
self regarding this misfortune in a letter which is Mill exlant. - 'The
Saracens with their whole army and in immense numbers fell upon the
Christian army during our retreat, and thus it happened that by divine
permission, and as oar sins merited, we fell him the Iuunls uf the tmemy.
We ourselves, our brothers the cumILs Alphonso hf Poitiers and Charles
of Aajou, and all who were retreating with us by land, fell into up-
tivity, though not without many losses by death and much shedding of
Christian hhmth and not one escaped', During his captivity at 3ran.srtca
Louis IK, was treated with consideration, even etter the young Mo'atggam
Turanshab had been assassinated before his eyes, and the crown ofEgypt
had passed frnm the house of Saladin to the so-called Bahrite )Iamelukes
