head-dress (pshent) with theUi-acus snake, whichis crowned with a
cylinder sloping slightly outwards , and resembling the modius in
the head of Serapis. An artuieral beard is attached to the chin.
On his breast the king weersashieid terminating in a groove at the
top (perhaps a kind of pouch, such as were worn by the Jewish priests
and those of Serapis), in the centre of which is inscribed his pro-
uemeu Ra-user-ma sctep en Ita, Le. 'god of the sun, mighty in the
truth, approved by the sau', while the god Ptah (y. 12(f), and the
Hoa-headed Sehhet (Bast) stand by as bearers; the girdle, in
which a dagger is worn, bears both the pronomen and the surname
of Ramses, the favourite of Ammon, which is also inscribed on the
front of the semi! or stair which he holds in his left hand. 0n
the back of the support of the left leg, Which is in the attitude of
stepping forward, are two vertical rows of hieroglyphics, the lower
parts of which are broken off: - 1st Line: 'the princess and
great _ . .'; 2nd Line: 'the King's (daughter), the great . t .'
These fragments of inscriptions show that the figure of a daughter
of the king was placed at his feet. The figure of a son is still
distinctly recognisable, the arm being raised in an attitude of
prayer, and the hand touching the knee of the statue. - There
can be no doubt that this statue, the face of which, when erect,
was turned towards the N., is one of those erected by Ramses H.
in front of the temple ofPtah (p. 373) at Memphis. In the time
of Strabo it perhaps stood alone in the anterior court, which was
used for bull-fights. 'A colossal statue of a single stoue’, ho ob-
serves, 'stands in the entrance court before the temple ofPtah.
Bull-fights were exhibited here, for which express purpose some
persons keep hulls, as horse-traincrs rear horscs‘. According to
Herodotus two of these statues were 30 cubits in height, Which, as
the Greek cuhit Was only about W.,. ft. in length, nearly corresponds
to the 42 ft. which the statue actually measures. Both Herodo-
tus and Dioderns state that Sesostris [Ramses Ir.), on his re-
turn from a great and victorious campaign, Was invited at Peiusium
on the Egyptian frontier, with his wife and children, to a banquet
at the house of Iris brother. The lattes, desiring to assassinate
Ramses, caused his tent to be surrounded with dry reeds after
the banquet, and to he set on fire. The intoxicated servants reu-
dered iaeifieieut aid, and the king’s wife and children were in the
utmost danger. The king, thereupon, raised his hands in prayer,
dashed into the flames, and rescued them. Out of gratitude he
then erected this statue, at the foot of which the figures ofa prime
and princess were plaecrl. Accessory tigares of a similar kind,
however, are frequentiy found with other statues to whioh no such
story attaches.

Close to the statue, on the left, in front ofa fellih-hut, are
remains ofa statue, including a Golossei foot, which, however, being
ofsandstouc, probably did not belong to the statue of Ramses, which
