veller has the sun in his face both ih going and returning; but itis
interesting to geologists. The route is not easily found (p. 338);
the l 1idi et-Tilt (p. (339) forms the best startiug-point Leomp. Maps,
pp. 316, 328).

We leave Cairo by the BO ol-NUM/O Cpl. G, 2), pass the
Tombs of the Ma1nelulres, and, leaving the village of llhsitiu on the
right, ascend to the left by the Jewish Cemetery. After reaching
the top of the hill in the Wadi et-Tih [whence we observe the en- l
tmnee of the rocky ravine mentioned at p. 839 to the right), we
follow the valley towards the E. for 11/ -ll/2 hr, more, Above the
gradual slopes of the desert, about 1% M. to the left, we then
perceive several reddish hills and another of yellowish colour in
front. Riding towards the latter, we reach on its E. slopes the de-
bris of the Bit el-Fahmeh ("eoal wellO and remains of some walls,
dating from the period (1840] when 3lOammed “Ali caused a
search for coal to he made here. The shaft is said to be 600 ft. in
depth, the bottom being 200 ft. below the level of the Nile. N0 I
coal, however, was found. The hills of the desert to the N., N.W.,
and w. of the Bh el-Fal.m1el1 are thickly strewn with trunks and
fragments of fossil timber. Some of the trunks which are exposed
to view measure 65400 ft. in length, and are upwards. of 3 ft.
thick at the lower end. They are generally brown and black, with
a polished appearance, and frequently contain chalcedony,

A sand-hill 1/2 hr. to the N. of Bi: el-Fal.1mei1, to the base of
which the Forest extends, affords a good survey of the distriet.
To the N.W. are the Mokattam, the 'Red Mountain' (p. 337), 'Ab-
1nutyeh, and the plain of the Nile. We may noW return in this di-
rection, keeping to the N. of the Mokattam hills (comp. Map,
p. 32i0, following a level desert valley. The way cannot be mis-
taken, but is not easy to find in the reverse direetiou without an
experienced guide, as the point for “hieh we are bound, not hemg
renspieuous, is likely to he missed, and there are no good landmarks
en the route beyond the Spring of Moses, opposite to which it enters
the valley between the Moha tam and the Gebel el-Ahmar.
