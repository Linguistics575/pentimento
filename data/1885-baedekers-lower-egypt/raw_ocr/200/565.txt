and we are told, that when he raised his hands, Israel had the mastery,
and when he let them fall. Amelek had the mastery. And Joshua dis-
o0mUed Amalek and his people with the edge of the gword'. - It is
natural that a battle should have been fought on the outskirts of the
oasis, as the Amalakite passessors of this fertile island in the midst of
the desert would be very unlikely to yield up their- nahle property
without a blow, We are then informed (Exodus xv that Moses,
'where he eneemped at the mount of God‘, organised the people by the
advice of Jethro, his futl1er-irs-law, who came to visit him, and chose
valiant men from all Israel, whom he set over them 'to he rulers of
thousands, and m1 g of hundreds, rulers of iifties, and rulers of tens‘.
'And (Numb. xxx) 15) they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in
the wilderness of Sinai', and (Exodus xix. 2) 'they were departed from
Itephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the
wilderness-, and there Israel camped before the mount. And Moses Went

The most conspicuous of the hills visible hence is the Jebel
e.t- Fytmeh (or Mill-Mountaiu], situated in a line with the 111or1-
astery hill (to the N.), rising above the bed of the valley to the
height of 700 ft, and crowned with the ruin ofa handsome church.
The steep, neglected path ascending to it is 11auked with the re-
mains of ancient chapels; and near it are many Muses built of
loose stones, The windows of these look towards the outside, and
not into the court according to Oriental usage. The settlement is
enlivened with children, poultry, and dogs, and with its babbling
break almost resembles a 1'yrolese mountain village. Farther N.
rises the summit of the lofty Jebel et-Betuh (4017 (L), or the
'Mountain of the Virgins', sometimes called the Jebel el-lh'nt, or
‘Mountain of the Virgin'. It is probably so called from a chapel of
the Virgin situated here, but the Beduins maintain that it derives
its name from two Tiwara maidens, who had been ordered to marry
against their wishes, and who therefore tled to the mountains.
They were overtaken by their pursuers on the Jehel el-Bemit, but,
rather than be captured, they plaited their trcsses together and
precipitated themselves from the rocky summit into the abyss. On
the N. side of the valley are numerous tombs of hermits and monks
who spent their lives on Mt. Serbil and in the monastery of the
bishopric 0f Pharan. These tomhs are mentioned by )Iakrizi so
early as 1440. Prof. Palmer re-discovered them, and observed that
the bodies had been buried in a line from E. to W., in coarse
shrouds and (s0ftins of which traces remained.

Mount SerbM (6712 ft.; Le. Serb Ba'al, or 'palm rove of Baal')
rises to the S, in the form of a broad, serrated pyramid.

Tar. ASCENT OF Moon Senhzn is dinieult and fatiguing, and should
he attempted by experienced mountaineers only, especially as the guides
atrord little assistance (the best of ihem is 2ftears sHfrsrbi). The expe-
dition takes a whole day [the ascent 5 hi's.], so that the start should be
made before sunrise. Strong boots are essential, the tucks being hard
and sharp,

The ascent is most conveniently made through the wear weyat (m
the N. side, but it may also be made through the Wadi Seldf (p. 501.)
and the Wiirbier-iti+ 0n the S. side, If the traveller starts early enough
to reach the tirst oasis in the Willi er-Rimm by 8 :t.m., the ascent hurl
