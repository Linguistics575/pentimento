Among these were the French savants NM. Ch. Lerwrrrurnt,
Mor l'HMe, and Emmanuel de IIouyc', the last of whom was the
hrst to translate with philological accuracy a hi roglyphic text of
any length, and the Italian seholars JUL Suluolini, Ungarelli, and
Roscltini. The most distinguished English Egyptologists of the
same school are Mexsrs, Osbum and Hineks, and Dr. Birch, Who
has compiled the iirst complete dictionary of the ancient language,
and has translated numerous inscriptions. The most celebrated
German Egyptologist is Prof. Richard Lepsius Cd. 1881), the foun-
der of the critical method of prosecuting philologi0al and historical
research. Thanks to the discoveries of these savauts and others of
the same school, the study of the subject has progressed so rapidly
that the time is probably not far distant when students will he
ahie to translate a hieroglyphic inscription with as great philologi-
cal accuracy as the work of a Greek or Latin author.

A glance at 1 single temple wall, or even at the mmexed list
of the names of the Egyptian kings, will show the traveller that
we have not to deal here with an alphabetical mode of writing, the
signs (about 2000 in number) heing far too numeroux. The ancient
Hwyptian writings were based on two different, but intimately con-
nected systems '. CI) the fdeoyruphie, which, by the use ofwe1l-known
objects as symbols of conceptions, sought to render its meaning in-
telligible to a eertainclass of the vommunity; and (ow) the Phonetic,
which represents words by symbols of their sounds. Although we
cannot now traee the rise and progress of hieroglypl0 writing, as
even the earliest specimens manifestly belong to an already per-
fected system, We may at least safely assert that the idcugra-
phie element preceded the phonetic; far, as a child employs
gestures earlier than speech, " nations use a symholical form of
writing before they arrive at a method of expressing sounds. The
newer and more serviceable phonetic system must ultimately have
superseded the ideographie, although occasionally ealling in its
aid as an auxiliary. In the perfected system, therefore, the sym-
bols for sounds and syllables are, to be regarded as the fonudntion
of the writing, while symbols for ideas are interspersed with them,
partly to render the meaning more intelligible, and. partly for or-
namental purposes, or with a view to keep up the mystic character
" the hieroglyphics.

The Phonetic signs are divided into alphabetical letters, such as

 

a, J b, m g or .k, x f, etc., and syllahic signs, sueh as

<9 ur, ,9 M, ยง sch, , tmkb, mm aner, etc. The

syllable signs may, in order to " their sounds with greater pieci-
sion, have as 'plwnetie emnplemcnts' one, several, or all of those
aoumls which the name of the syllable representing the sign in
