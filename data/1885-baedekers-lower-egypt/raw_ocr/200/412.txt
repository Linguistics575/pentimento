The three Small Pyramids situated to the S, of the Third Pyr-
amid are uninteresting. The toutb-ehamber of the one in the
nontre also contains the name of Menkaura, painted on the ceiling

About 600 paces to theli. ofthe plateau of the Second Pyramid,
from amidst the sand of the desert, rises the a
Sphinx l which, next to the Pyramids themselves, is the most
famous monument in this vast burial-ground. It is hewn out of
the natural rock, and where this meterin) has failed it has been
moulded into the shape of a recumbent lien with the head ofa
man. The body was left in a rough form, but the head was origi-
nally most carefully executed, The entire height of the monument,
from the crown of the head to the pavement on which the fore-legs
or the lion rest, is said to be (T, ft. [see below), but the head, ncrh,
and a small part of the back are generally alone visible, the rest
being A'ollecaleil by the constantly shifting sand. The car, aeoorrliug;
to Mariette, is il/s, re, the nose 3 ft. 7 im, and the mouth 7 ft.
7 in. in length; and the extreme breadth of the face is l.", tt.
8 inehes. If the traveller stands on the upper part of the ear, he
cannot stretr'h his hand as far as the C,rowrt ofthc head, and the
spnue between these points must have been greater when the head-
dceoration, which, as well as the greater part or the heard, is now
broken off, was still intact. There is a hollow in the head, into
which one of the Arabs may be desired to elim0. The face was
deplorahly mutilated at a comparatively recent period by a fanatic,

fare is very pleasing, and is of a graceful and beautiful type; (um
might almost say that it smiles wiun'mgly'. He also desr-ribos the
proportions of the head very minutely. An older writer, however,
states that the nose was mutilated in his time, and, as it is now
entirely destroyed, the face somewhat resembles the negro type,
though the month still has a smiling appearance. The stone form-
erly had a reddish tint which has now entirely disappeared, The
Arabs have given the Sphinx the name of 'abrl 1161', ix. 'father
of terror', or formerly ‘hnlhit', probably derived from the Coptic
G:h-syvz- [hcl-hit), signifying a person who carries his he t "
his intelligence in his eyes, or 'the watchful'. This last expre, sion
has frequently been used, by authors who “ch ignorant of its an-
tiquity, as an appropriate epithet for the Sphinx. The Arabs be-
lieved that the J'vgurc possessed the supernatural power of prevent-
ing the encroachment of the sand. The complete excavation of the
