The Entrance (Pl. a) to the mosque is on the Fl. side, aiul we
reach the interior hy traversing the b'. part of the Liwiu. The
mosque originally had two entrances from each of the three outer
courts (sec Plan). The Sahn ol-Crime, which we first enter. is a
spacious quadrangle, 99 yds. square. The doine-eovercd structuic
Jn. 6) in the centre was destined to be the tomb of the founder;
bat, as he died in Syria (see p. 965), it was fitted up as a 1iauefi-
yeh, or basin for ablutiou before prayei, andstill scives that purpose.

On the N., w., and S. sides of the couit of the mosque inn
arcades, which were at one time converted into cells for the "'A'ip-
tion of paupei-s and cripples. The charautcr of the building, which
must once have presented a very imposing and harmonious ap-
pearance, has thus been seriously injured. The Arabian historians
relate that Ahmed was so charmed with the editiee when completed
that he presented the aiehitcct with 10,000 diutrs, and he is said
to have defrayed the whole of the cost of its constiuctiou out of
one of the treasures found by him (p. 102).

The pointed arches of the arcades are slightlydepiessed, audllave
a tendency toss ards the horseshoe form, a shape which is completely
developed in the lower stories of the minaret (see below). Between
the openings of the arcades are introduced pointed arches or niches,
partly for purposes of support, and partly by way of ornament.
The central pillars, which fell in 1814, once bore marble tablets
with Cutie inscriptions, recording the date of the building of the
mosque, but these have since been destroyed.

The Liwén, or Sanctuary, on the E. side, through which we
have entered the In1ilding, contains five series of arcades, and in
each of the other sides of the court there are two series. With a
view to exclude all sound of the outside world, the external wall
of this chamber of prayer was' separated from the street by a row
of shops, and the three other sides were isolated by the introduction
of outer courts heyond them, enclosed by lofty walls (see Plan).

All the angles in the interior are tilled With columns built into
the walls, extending two-thirds of the way up, without bases, and
with imperfectly deiiued capitals in plaster. At certain places in
the pillars and the masonry longitudinal beams' of wood have been
introduced for the purpose of strengthening the building, but they
are visible only where the .xtcmal inciusta .has fallen off. The
perforated attics, the gratings of stucco, tie oruamerrtat'ron, and
the cutie inscriptions in stucco are all executed in strict conformity
with the Byzantine-Arabian style. In the Klbla (Pl. 1), however,
we observe two marble columns with capitals of more pronounced
Byzantine form. The upper part ofthe niche is adorned with gilded
mosaic, and the lower part with inlaid marble, while ahove is a
dome with stalactites. The 'Jlumbur JI. LO, a masterpiece of wood-
earving‘ was' mohahly restored when the mosque “as repaired by
El-Melik ol-Mans) in the year 096 of the Uegira.
