pass through the gates without undergoing an emniination hy the
eustodien, and this custom still prevails at Damascus and in the
towns of Upper Egypt, such as Shit. 1n former times, during the
prevalence of the 1fameluke eoui1iets, which wore always attended
with the pillaging and assassination of many peaceful citizens,
the gates " the kMus frequently remained closed for several days
together, for the purpose of airordiirg protection against the out-
rages of these lawless mercenaries,

The principal market-days are Monday and Thursday, when
the traflie in the narrow streets is so great that it becomes difMutt
or impossible to traverse them; but it is on these occasions that
the most characteristic scenes of Oriental life are witnessed. Ped-
lers are seen forcing their way through the crowd, shouting at the
top of their voices, sometimes carrying a small table with them,
and frequently selling their wares hy auctioxL So, too, we oh-
sen‘e coffee-sellers, wat0ehearors, "argi1oh-hawkers, and others,
elhowing their way, landing their commodities, and escaping
aecitlents almost by a miracle. One of the noisicst frequenters of
the bazaars is the Jamil, or auctioneer, who carries on his head or
shoulders the goods he is instructed to sell, and runs up and down
the lanes shouting 'l/arO, lumiy', and adding the amount of the
last bid he has received. However great the confusion may be, his
practised ear instantly detects each new bid issuing from one of
the dnkls%rs, and he immediately announces the new DITer -
'hiishrin lrirsh’, ‘bi’ixhrin u nuy', and so on. The seller of the goods
always accompanies the dailil to give his consent to the conclusion
of the transaction.

It is hardly possible to give the traveller any idea of the yriees
" the various commodities, as they depend on the demand, which
is greater in winter than in summer, and also on the vyharaeter of
the seller and the demeanonr of the purehascn We may also
mention that many so-eil Oriental articles, particularly silks
and woollen stuirs, are now manufactured of inferior materials by
European tlrms, and exported to Egypt. Some articles again, such
as rugs and hangings, please the eye amid their native surroumL
hugs, but are rarely suitable for European rooms; while others are
more advantageously purehascd in most European capitals than
from the Oriental merchants themselves, with whorit bargaining
is diflimlt and troublesome. So-sit antiquities are largely sold
at the hotels at exorbitant prices, far exceeding their true value,
and many of them are even specially manufactured for the purpose.
Caution in making a purehase is far more requisite in the Fast than
in Lumpe, ns Orientals regard skill in "heating simply as a desirable
