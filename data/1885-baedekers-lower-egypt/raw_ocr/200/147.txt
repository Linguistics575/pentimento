Cleonhose who held this doctrine there could be no original act of
ation , and no plurality of gods; but a metaphysical conception
itrffiealt of apprehension could not be propouuded to the great

my of the people. For the use of such persons it was, therefore,

-sirr1pliiied, and ol0tlsei1 with allegorical forms, through the medium

' which they might behold it as through a veil, somewhat obsoured,

I at at the Same time embellished and sham of its terrors. This
anstitnted the Exo'mmc DOCTRINE, with which was connected
the theogony, or theory of the origin and descent of the divinities
who represented the various forces and phenomena of nature. These
gods, however, though not existent from all eternity, were neither
created nor begotten, but were regarded as having been self-created
in the wembs of their own mothers, and are therefore spoken of as
'their own fathers', 'their own sonsâ€™, and the husb;uuls of their
mothers'. The deities accordingly are seldom spoken of as single
individuals, butintriads, as father, mother, and son (comp. p. 130).

The primary source from which all life proceeds, the firist cause
" all things, was clothed with a personal form, called Nun. The
principle oflight, and the creative power of nature, which implants
in matter the germs of existence and light, was Khepera, or the
suarahams with the sun's disk, whose emblem was theheetle (seara-
baeus saver). As that insect rolls up into a ball the eggs which
produce its offspring, and was supposed to have no female, so this
deity Was believed to have concealed within the globe of the world
the germs of organic life. Ptah is the greatest of the gods t and is
the embodiment ofthe organising and motive power developed from
moisture (Nun). It is he who imparts form to the germs sown by
Khepera, andunder the name ofSek/iem Nefer breaks the ball rolled
along by the searahzeus, or in other words the egg of the universe,
from which emerge his children, the elements and the forms of
heaven and earth. Ra, a deity who beam seventy-live different
forms, at Mst appears in the Nun under the name of Tum, or the
evening sun; during his passage through the lower hemisphere,
that of night, he is known as Kimum, and is born anew on the
next moming of the oreation, bursting forth in the form of a child
Hlarmaehis) from a lotus-it- floating on the Nun. Evening and
night precede the morning and day; and Amenthes, or the infernal
regions, were believed to have existed before the uppe: regions
which formed the scene of human life.

After the breaking of the egg " the world, the universe is re-
solved into three empires: - (l) The heavenly Nut, represented
as a woman ' bending over the earth, on whose back float
the vessel of the sun, the planets, and the constellations. C2) Seb,
or the earth, which possesses the power of eternal tejuveneseenee,
and Was regarded by the Egyptians as the symbol ofeternity, a
deity somewhat resembling the Greek Uhronos. (3] Tire Infernal
