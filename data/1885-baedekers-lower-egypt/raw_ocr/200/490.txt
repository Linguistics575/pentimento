of the ship's course. We pass a handsome pies on the left, from

the S. side of which the navigable channel to Suez, bordered by
shallows, branches " to the N.W.l and then, nearly in the lati-

tude of Suez, we enter the mouth of the cam]. On that part of I
the W. bank of which the Canal has made an island by separating
it from the mainland, rise the workshops and coal magazines of the
company and the quarantine estahlishment. At low tide the shah
lows in the N. part of the gulf are visible, and a series of islands
is always to he seen at the extremity of the gulf, which, but for the
Canal, might he crossed on foot at low tide. 0n the westernmost
island, situated opposite the railway station and the hotel, is an
old burial-ground, and on a larger island farther to the E. are the
company‘s furnaces and workshops,

At the 150th kilometre (the 831d on the fresh-water eaual] the
desert rises in a slight eminence, on which lie a number of huge
granite blocks, the remains of two monuments erected here by Da-
rius, during the Persian period, and still bearing trace: of hiero-
glyphics and of the Persian cuneiform characters.

been brought to light (comp. p. 00).
