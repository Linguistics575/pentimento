' to Port Sitd. THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ. 7. Route. 425

2025 passengers, A place on deck should be secured, ifpussible. The
passage from Isma'iliya to Kantara (p. 435), where a hen of 1/th hr. is
made forrefreshmeuts, occupies 2|/zhrs.. and thence to Port Sa'id ave us.,
" about 61/2 hrs. in all. As already mentioned, the large steamers take
16 hrs, to perform the passage between Sues and Port 8rfid, Ismrfiliys
being about half way. They are not allowed to steam at greater speed,
as their wash would injure the embankments.

The Canal is 160 kilometres (100 11.] in length, and the E, bank is
furnished with posts at intervals of 5 kilometres. Near the stations,
which generally consist of a few wooden huts only, are passing
places for the large steamers‘ named ‘Gare da Yord' trad 'Crave dn Sud'
respective! . The Canal is about 26 ft. in depth, tl1us admitting vessels
drawing 2 AIO ft. of water. The surface varies in breadth from 0510
120 yds., while the width 0f the button] is about 2lyds. only. The dues
amount to 10 fr. per ton, 10 fr. for each passenger, and to-N ft. fur piltrt-
age according to the tonnage of the vessel. The use of the Canal is open
to vessels of all natiururlities.

Tho Isthmus of Suez, a narrow neck of land which connects
Africa wich Asia, is at its narrowest part 'roy, M. in width. On
the h side it is washed by the N. part of the Gulf of Suez. (Arab.
Bahr Kalzum, Greek Heroopolite Bay), the western of the two
arms of the Red Sea which separate Africa and Asia. The Isthmus
is a low-lying tract of land, the S. past of which may be regarded
as a kind of cautinuatiou of the gulf. Aboutbalfwsy across it rises
an eminence about 50 ft. in height, called E1-Gisr(the ‘threshold’,
p 431), and dividing itinto two nearly equal parts. Within the
half, and adjoining this barrier, .lies Lake Tirnsir, or the Cra-
eodile Lake (1). 432), a little to the W, of Which begins the Widi
Pimilit (p. 413), a transverse valley, traversed by the Fresh Water
Canal, and now partly cultivated. Farther S. we come to ahelt
of sand-hills in the region known as the Serapeum (p. 433], about
10 M. in width, and beyond them to the Bitter Lakes (p. 433],
consisting of a large and a smaller basin Before the construction
ot' the Canal the deepest part of these lakes, the bottom of whreh
was covered with an inemstation of salt, was IU ft. below the
average level of the Red Sea. In 1856, before the water of the Me-
diterranean ly as introduced into the lakes, they covered all area of
141/2 sq. miles. 'uetweerl them and the Red Sea extends a desert
tract, 121/3 M. in width, and 2y, ft. only above the level of that
sea. To the N. of the barrier of J?,1-Gisr lies Lake 1sho, or the
Date Lake (pt 435), a little beyond which is Lake Menzaleh
(p. 435], originally a shallow sheet of "water, extending a long Way
to the w., as far as the Damietta arm of the Nile, and separated
from the Mediterranean by a narrow strip of land only, in Which
there are now tour openings. By the second opening from the E.
the harbour of Port Sa'id has been constructed. The numerous
ruins which have been discovered below the surface of this lake
indicate that its site was once cultivated land, sprinkled with a
number of towns (p. 435).

At a very remote period the Red Sea and the Mediterranean
were probably conneeted, or at all events the former extended as
