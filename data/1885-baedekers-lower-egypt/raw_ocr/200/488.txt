olemonstrater1 the inaccuracy of Lepére's observations, and proved
that the level of the two seas was nearly the same, so that the
construction of a canal between them was possible. In 1854 M.
de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before said Pasha,
who was then Viceroy, and who determined to carry it out. Diffi,
culties were thrown in the way of the enterprise by the, English
government during Lord Palmerstor1's ministry, but on 5th Jan.
18:30 permission to begin the work was formally granted by the
Viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the neces-
sary capital was raised, and it was not till 25th April 1858, that
the work was actually begun. The Viceroy undertook to pay many
of the current expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen, who were
to he paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate, and
were to be relieved every three months. In order to provide these
workmen with water, 4000 water-casks suitable for being carried
by camels hall to be constructed, and 1000 of these animals were
daily employed in bringing them supplies, at a cost or8000 fr. per

011 18th March, 1800, the water of the Mediterranean was at
length allowed to ilow into the nearly dry, salt-euurusted basins of
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of which lay '2()-M] ft. below the
level of the Mediterranean, while the S. parts required extensive
dredging operations.

'The first encounter of the Waters of the two seas was by no means
of an amicable character; they met beistcronsly, and then recoiled from
the attack; but soon, as if commanded by a 'quos ego' of Neptune. they
pmccfuny mingled, and the ocean once more gained possession of the
land Which it had covered at a very remote period, but only 011 cnnrli-
tion of rendering service to the trairse or the world'. (Stephan)
