Most Hrientuls regard the European traveller as a Urmsus, and
sometimes too as a madman, - so unintelligible to them are the
ohjon-ts and pleasures of travelling, Poverty, they imagine, is
unhnouu among IIS, whereas in reality we feel its privations far
more keenly than they. That such erroneous notions prevailis to
some extent the fault of travellers themselves In a country where
the requirements of the natives are few and simple, and money is
scarce, a few piastres seem a fortunate many. Travellers are there-
fore often tempted to give for tho sake ofaffortlingtemporary pleasure
at u triirmg rest, forgetting that the seeds of insatiable eupidity are
thereby sown, to the, irrfmite annoyance of their successors and the
tlrmtoralisatiou of the recipients themselves, As a rule, hakshish
should never be given except for services rendered, or to the sick
and aged.

Sir Gardner‘Vilkinson has justly observed that the. cry of 're-
shim, bul.cshtsli, yr? JhruMyels' (oh, sirI agiftl), with which Huro-
penlls are invariably assailed, is an insulting substitute for the
'urood day’ of other countries. The Arab reserves his pious henc-
dirtimls for his own countrymen, but never hesitates to take advan-

The word bultxlxiwh, whirl resoululs so perpetually. iu the
traveller’s cals during his sojourn in the East, and haunts him long
afternnnls, simply means 'a gift‘; and, as rverything is to he had
in return for gifts, the word has many different appliuations.
Thus “ith hakshish the tardy formalities of the custom-house
umecr are, accelerated, bnhshish supplies the plane ofa passport,
hnkshish is the alms bestowed on a beggar, hahshish means black
mail, and lastly tl large proportion of the public oftioials of the
vvuntry arc said to live by hahshish or bribery.
