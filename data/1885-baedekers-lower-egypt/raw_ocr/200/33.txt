DRAGOMANS. 13

Travellers about to make a tour of any length may avoid all the
petty annoyances incident to direct dealings with the natives by
placing themselves under the care of a DRAGOMAN (Arab. tur-
gemftn].

The word drawmcm is derived from the chairman target», 'to explain‘,
or from tm-gnm, 'explaaruiurC. The Arabic mrymn also signifies 'to inter
pret'. The dragoman was therefore originally merely a guide who ex»
plained or interpreled. Since the 7th cent, BA). When l’sammetiehus I.
threw open the country to foreign trade, against Which it had previously
been jealously closed, this class, which is mentioned by Herndntus as a
distinct caste, has existed in Egypt. That author informs us that
Perrauuetiehug caused a number of E tizm children to be educated by
Greeks in order that they might learn their language; and it Was these
children who afterwards became the founders of the dragoumn caste
The great historian himself empinyed a dregt-mnn, [mm Whom he fr
quently derived erroneous information. A dragomnn, whn Was employed
by the governor Elius Genus to accompany him up the Nile, is accused
by Strabo of absurdity, conceit, and ignorance. The ignorant Arabian,
Nubian, " Maltese dragomans " the present day do not attempt to ex-
plain or translate the ancient inscriptions. An smut was recently made
with some success to educate young Arabs for this calling in a school
muuded fur the purpose; but, like most Oriental undertakings, the
scheme has not been persevered with.

The dragomans, who speak English, French, and Italian,
undertake for a tlsed sum per day to defray the whole cost of
1oootuotion, hotel accommodation, fees, and all other expenses1 so
that the traveller is enabled to obtain, as it were, a bird's eye view
ofthc country without being concerned with the cares of daily life.
On the other hand the traveller is frequently imposed upon by
the dragomau himself.

The charge made by the Llragomau varies very greatly according
to circumstances‘ such as the number and the requirements of thc
travellers, the lengthof the journey, and the amount of the demand
for the services of such a guide. A dragoman is usually employed
for the longer tours only, such as the voyage up the Nile, the journey
to Mt. Sinai, the excursion to the Faytirn, and a visit to the less fre.
quented towns in the Delta. Visitors to Alexandria, Cairo, Suez,
Isma’iliya, and Port Sarhl may well dispense with a dragoman1 as
every necessary service will be rendered them by the commission-
naires of the hotels (5-10 fr. per day). Ilmgomans of the better
class, moreover7 usually consider it beneath their dignity to escort
their employers through the streets of the towns, and are apt to
consign them to the guidance of the local cicerones.

For the ab0ve-uarned longer tours the charges vary so greatly,
and the services to be rendered on each are so different, that a
separate contract with the dragummi shouhl be drawn up in each
case. (Thus, for the Nile voyage hehas to procure a dahahiych,
for tho Fayrirn horses, for Mt. Sinai camels, for the Delta canal-
boats and donkeys, and, for the last three journeys, tents also.)
Information] regarding expenses and other details, as well as the
names of some of the host dragon1ans, will be prefixed to each of
the routes in question. The larger the party, the less will be the
