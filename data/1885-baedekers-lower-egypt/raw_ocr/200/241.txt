and the few scholars of any eminence who had remained till then
were obliged to leave the place. A new Insurrection which broke
out in the reign of Phocas Was attended with greater success than
previous revolts, fer Ilemclius, whom the Alexandrians now pro-
claimed emperor, contrived in 610 to maintain his possession of
the purple. The sway of the Eastern emperors in Egypt, how ever,
soon came to an end. 111619 Alexandria was captured by Chosroes,
King of Persia, bat the Christians were left unmolested. Ten years
later IIega0lius succeeded in recovering possession of Egypt, but
the troops of the Khalif‘Omar soon afterwards invaded the country
and took Alexandria after a prolonged siege. In December, (MI,
Amr Ibu el-UP, rOmar’s general, entered the city; but by order
of his master, he treated the inhabitants with moderation. The
decline of Alexandria now became still more marked, and about
this period'Ansr founded Fostit (p. Til), as a new capital and seat
of government, free from ChriStian iniluerues. The new town,
which gradually developed itself into the modern Cairo, soon
became an important and prosperous place at the expense of the
famous ancient Greek city. During the middle ages Alexandria
sankinto irtsigniiieamse. Its commerce received a deathbluw by
the discovery of the sea-ronte to India round the Cape of Good
Hope, and the discovery ofAmerica entailed new losses. After the
conquest ongypt by the Turks [in1517) the city languished under
the infamous régirne of the Mnmelukes, the harbours became choked
with sand, the population, which had once numbered half l million
souls, dwindled down to 5000, am) the environs were converted
into a sterile and marshy wilderness. With regard to the history of
the French invasion, see p. 105.

The decay of the once powerful seaport was at length effectually
arrested by the vigorous hand of 1rolsarnrnerAli, who improved
the harbours and constructed several canals. The chief benefit he
conferred on Alexandria was the construction of the Mahmadfyeh
Canal, Which was so named after the reigning Sultan Mzthmfnl.
By means of this channel fresh water Was conducted to the tow I
from the Rosetta branch of the Nile, the adjoining fields were irri-
gated anew, aadAlexam1ria was again connected with the Nile and
the rest of Egypt, the products of which had long found their only
outlets through the Kosetta and Damietta mouths of the river. The
enterprising peshe began the work in 1519, employing no fewer
than 250,000 labourers, and completed it at a cost of 71/2 million
francs. He also improved the whole canal-system of the Delta, the
works being elriefly superintended by the aged and, eminent Linant
de Belleville-Pasha, general director of puhiie works, and other
French engineers. The subsequent vieetoys have also made great
efforts to improve the prospects of the town; and the Egyptian
eotton-eade, Which received lt strong impulse from the American
Trar, and found its chief outlet through Alexandria, has proved a
