of soft limestone, without inscriptions, were found in a sand-hill
in the neighbourhood, belonging probsbly to a burial-plate of the
quarrymon of the Pharaohs,

These quarries were also worked during the Ptolernaie and hhmn
periods; and mam, who was generally well-informed, states that the
.hmrri e whieh yielded the stunt: used in building the pyramids lay on
the rahian bank of the Nile. He says that they were excavated in th
ve rocky mountain, called We Trojii, and that near them and the
\ih} lay the village of Tr 01a, 'an aacieat residence of captive Trojans
who hid followed nenetrtua to Egypt and remsined (here. Diod0rus
gives the same account of the fnuudation of the Egyptian Troja, but adds
that Ctesias lnts a different version of it. Both authors were probably
ed by the Statement Of Herodotus, that Mehems Was hospitehty re-
c ved in Egypt when returning home with Helen from the siege of Troy.
There is, however, little doubt that the village called Troja by these
authors is the modern Tara, which had no connection whatever with
the city of Prime Insériptions dating from the ancient empire and
others "at the later monarchy, found in the quarries themselves, inform
us that the ancient name at the place Was Ta-ro-fa, or more recently
Ta-roue, " region nf the wide rotok-gateway, whence the stone of the
pyramids was obtainedt This name Was currnpted hy the Greeks to
'Troja', and as prisoners of state and of war, including many Asietius,
were touiefly employed in the quarries, it was not unnatural to suppose
that the colony of qllatrymeu at the foot of the hill was :1 settlement of
captive Trojans. Several slabs of rock hearing figures and hieroglyphic:
have been found su one " the great rm: , halls of Tum. One of these
represents King Amennphis m. um Dynasty) sacrificing to the gods
Amman, Horus, and Hcrsheft; and on the other we fiadhhn worshipping
Amman accompanied by Aunhie, Sekhet, and IPathur, The inscription
under the first slab (With which that on the second is nearly identical)
runs thus mm the second line onwards: - 'His Majesty ordered new
halls (lrct-u) to be opened, fur the purpose ofquatryiug the lightrcnlnured
