The first chamber usually eoutaius wcll-cxeeutcd hasreliefs, mostly
coloured, of members of the family of the deceased, and short in,
srriptions in the simple hieroglyphies of that period, with their
scanty determinative symbols, recording the dignities of the de-
ceased, and mentioning the estates from which his faithful servants
have brought offerings to the mamas of their master. Other chambers
contain carefully arranged lists of the appropriate offerings to be
presented to the deceased at different seasons, and on the various
festivals, such as meat and poultry, vegetables and fruit, drinks
and essences; and adjoining these are represented the altars laden
with these gifts. We seldom fit1d any allusion to death, or the life
in the next world, but there are generally faithful representations
of the favouritepursuits of the deocased(bird-eaushing, fishing, ete.),
of his most valuable possessions [horde of cattle, ships, etc, . hut
curiously enough, neither camels, sheep, nor horses, which last seem
to have heen introduced by the Hyhsos), and the tasks performed
by bis servants Citgrierultural operations, vintage, carpentering,
glass-blowing, gold-washing, papyrus-gathering, writing, etc).
These eolourerl hasreliefs form a most interesting link in the
history of ancient art, and are not without aesthetic attraction also.
They constitute, as it were, a picture-book in stone, illustrative of
the manners and customs which prevailed during the earnest known
stage of human civilisation,

These tombs probably originated somewhat in the following
manner. Every Egyptian of moderate means, and particularly the
great and wealthy, began duiing his lifetime to plan the cou-
stmatiou of a tomb worthy of his position in society. The longer
he lived and the wealthier he botanic, the handsomcr and the
more spiwious was the structure. When the architl'ut had lined the
interior with smoothly hewn stones from the quarries of Tura, the
task nf the draughtsmau and the decorator began. In aeuerdauce
