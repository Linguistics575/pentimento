4 MONEY

The curmIt rate of exchange should always be ascertained from
a banker (pp. 200, 232; soo also Tahlo, p 'T), and money should be
changed as rarely as possible at an ordinary uwrmy-elrangor's, at a
hotel, in tho bazaars, or through a dragomanI For excursions in
the country the traveller should be provided with an ample supply
of small change (silver piastres, hollupiastres, and copper coin), as
the villagers sometimes refuse to change money of any kind, and
the traveller may thus be very seriously inconvenienced, They also
frcrpurutly decline to take a coin if the inscription is worn away by
use. and in their examination of gold pieces they attach great im-
poxtam-o to the ring of tho metal. The trawller should also be on
his guard against eounterfeit dollars and piastr A favourite orna-
ment with Oriental women consists ot'a string pf gold coins worn
round the head, or as a necklace, and coins with holes in them are
awordingly often mat with, but they are very apt to be rejected by
tlut natives. lu changing money, thewforo, all those points should
be attended to. It need hardly be observed that money should al-
hhays be carefully kept under lock and key, and that it should he
shown as little as possihlc, in order that the tupidity of the people
with whom the traveller has to do may not be aroused.

l'apcr money is mlnosxn in the East ',csidcs the Egyptian
I-uinago, which moreover has two different rates of I hangef,
Turkish, French, I'higlislr, Italian, Austrian, and linsaxan gold and
silver coins are freely circulated

kept in cttrrent-pirtstro, which are worth one-halt' of the govern-
ment turif-piastres. As, however, these o not, as might be sup-
puscd, indicate two different wins, this tuofolI] mode of reckoning
'eolingly puzzling to strangers. It should he particularly ob-
serveil that at the shops and bazaars the prir arc olwa T tised in
surrrent piastres, so that half the number of silver veins only has to
he ghcn. Tho shopkeepers, however, generally convert their prices
ilzto francs fur the bt?netlt of strangers, and although their demands
"tT' then somewhat raised, they are at least more iutclligritrle. (hr
the othpr hand, in making small purelraws, and in Ilt‘aling with
IzmIntry- people it is more advantageous to keep to tho reckoning
in rrent piastrrvs, as the scllms are very apt to demand as many
