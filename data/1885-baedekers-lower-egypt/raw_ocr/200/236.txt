and Pompey's Pillar, see pp.2W,2220 The locality least free from doubt
is the site of the Paneum, which according to Straho (ih., ' 10) was Ira
artiihsia, eireuiar mound, resembling a rocky hill, to which a winding
wa, nsccntls. From its summit one can survey the whole of the sur-
l‘nnnding tuwn in cvei-y drreetion', This spot is doubtless identical with
the mndt‘rn Rihn ed-Doc, the highest ground in the town, li2ft. in height,
where the reservoir hf the waterworks (p, 216) is now situated.

The Gymnasium, according to Prof. Kiepei-t, who has minutely examined
the plans of hahmtid-Bey. and not the Seine and Museum, ocrmpied the
site of the old German consulate and its garden. ‘The most beautiful
building, however,' says etraho co, es), is the Gymnasium, with its
colonatuies, which are more than a stadium in length. In the middle lie
the cnlirls nr justice and graves‘.

The theatre, the tiema 0r Sema, and the Museum were situated
in the quarter of the Royal Palaces (p, 20W, which heinnged to the
iruchium tp. 209), and occupied 'a fam-th or even a third part of the
whole extent of the city' (ih., ' 8). This quarter must have lain tn the,
b'. of the great street leading to the Cnnopic Gate, and to the s. of
Lnehias, and must have adjoiiieti the hai-hour and tan uurthtybeyoad it',
The Alexandrian Theatre lay opposite the island of Antirrhudus (p. 209),
in accordance with the eustnm that obtained at Greek seaports of placing
theatres where they cnnld command a view of the sea. Speaking

buildings, an eaciesed space, within which are the tombs of the kings
and that of Alexander. For Ptolemy Lagi had taken away the hudy of
the latter from Perdieeas, who bad brought it from L'alrylou. .Now
Ptolemy hmught the hody at" Alexander to Alexandria and buried where
it now lies, though not in the same eofiin. The present coffin is of hyhius

The Museum, like the thsma, belonged to the quarter of the mysi
palaces. and prohabiy stood on the spot where some huge mitts, since
tiesei-ihcrl hy Brugsrsh, were discovered in 1553 when a Greek school was
heiag imiit. These ruins lay on the b' side of the Piece mihéutet-Mi and
m the w. of Cdetrpatwr's Needle, a site which would correspond with the
quarter of the palaces. The library undoubtedly was connected with the
Museum, and it is noteworthy that among these ruins a hollowed stone
was thtmd hearing the inscription, 'Dioskorides, 3 Irols.', though it can
hardly have been used as a receptacle for scrolls, From these walls, nuw
