said to have reigned iifty-six years.'

"I'his makes altogether a hundred and six years, during which
the Egyptians suffered all kinds of oppression, and the temples
constantly remained closed, Owing to their hatred of these two
kings, the people would not even mention their names, and they
even call the pyramids after a shepherd named Philitis, who at that
period pasturcd his Melrs in the neighbourhood''.

"After this king (Chephron), Myeerinus, the son of Cheops, is
said to hare reigned over Egypt, He is said to have had no pleasure
in the conduct of his father, but to have re-opened the templcsand
to have allowed the people, reduced to extreme distress, to return
to their occupations and the worship of the gods. He is also said
to have pronounced the most jus: judgments of all the kings,’

'Ire, too, left behind him a pyramid, but a much smaller one
than that built by his father. Each of its sides measures 280 feet
only, and half of it consists oflithiopian stone. Some oftheGreeks
state that this was the pyramid of Rhodopis7 a courtezan; but they
are, wrong; nay, when they maintain this, they do not seem to me
even to know who this Ilhodopis was, for she Ilourisl1edin the time
of King Amasis, and not in the reign of this King (comp. p. 348).'

The account given by Diadoms Siculus I ()3, Cu) is as follows:
_ 'The eighth king was Chcinbes, the Meniphite, who reigned
Mty years. He built the largest of the three pyramids, which
were reckoned among the seven wonders of the world. They are
to be found in the direction of Libya, [20 stadia distant from
Memphis, and io from the Nile. The sight of these great masses
and their artistic construction excites surprise and admiration. The
base of the largest, the plan of which is 1uadrilatcral, is seven
plothra [700 ft) on cauh side; and the height is more than six
plethra. The sides gradually contract towards the top , where
each is still six euhits broad. The whole hnilding is of hard
stone, clifiienlt to how, and it isofeverlasting duration. l’ornoicss
than a thousand (some writers even say three thousand) years are
said to have elapsed from the building of the pyramids down to
the present time; and yet these stones, in their original jointing,
and the whole structure are preserved uninjured by time. The
stones are said to hare been brought all the way from Arabia,
and the building to have been muted by means of cmlmnknicnts,
as no lifting machines had yet been invented, And the most
wonderful thing is, that, around the place “here this enormous
work is built, nothing is to be found but sandy wil, and thercisno
