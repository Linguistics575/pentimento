So far from being the oldest structure of the kind in Cairo, as
is generally asserted, this mosque is in its present form really one
of the youngest The last of its numerous reconstructions dates
from the beginning of the 9th cent. of the llegira (1400 A.D.),
when a rich Cairene merchant, named lbrihim el-Nahalli, under-
took to restore the building, partly at his own expense and partly
with the proceeds of collections made in all parts of Egypt. In
this undertaking he pulled down and made use of the materials of
the then standing mosque, which had been hastily erected in 1302
after the destruction of a still earlier building by an earthquake.
