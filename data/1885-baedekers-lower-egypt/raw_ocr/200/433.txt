ciuets afford sarii0ient information with regard to tho different po-
riods at which its silent denizens were admitted.

The TOMB: are of two kinds, viz. Maslabas (literally â€˜henehes')
and 1loek-Chumbers. The Mastaba. is a mausoleum of solid ma-
sonry constructed on the surface of the earth. Its form is usually
rectangular, and the walls slope inwards, so that the whole structure
forms a kind of low truncated pyramid. Many of them are built of
liuiestorie-bloeks of moderate size, and others of Nilo-briryks, While
the pyramids am always entered from the N., the door of the
Mastaba is usually on the E. side. On the stone door-posts
generally rests the drum, a cylindrical block of stone, probably
in imitation of the round section of A palm tsunk, such as still
usually covers the doorways of huts built of NiIe-mud 0r sun-dried
bricks. The drum usually bears the name of the deceased, but
rarely his.tit1es, which areoften Tory lengthy. Grand~chi1dren and
other near relations of the Pharaohs, however, are distinguished

O
by the added to their names, being a title ofhononr which

might he translated- 'blood relation of the king', The door-posts
occasionally tear a full-length representation of the deceased; and,
where there is no drum, the arehitrave of the door sometimes bears
an inscription. The arrangements of the interior vary. At the
back of the principal chamber there is 1rsi1ally a monument with
numerous inscriptions, giving the wholeofthetitlesef the deceased,
the names of Iris nearest relations, and a number of prayers, gen-
orally addressed to Anubis, the guide of souls in the infernal re-
gions and the tutelary god of the realms of the dead. In front of
these monuments, and in presence of the family, it was usual for
the priests appointed for the purpose to perform the rites due tu
the mums of the deceased (p. IW). Osiris is rarely mentioned by the
inscriptions, and death is l1ari1lyover alluded to. Near theprineipal
chamber there is generally a niche closed w ith masonry, to which M.
Mariette gave the name of serdab ('hollow spate/j, and sshieh in
many of the mas..tabas either contains, or formerly contained7 a statue
of the deceased. Most of the serdibs are entirely closed, but some
of them have small openings in the wall, through which it was
probably customary to introduce incense. The well, or perpendi-
eular shaft into which the body ot'the deceased was sunk, is usually
on the W. side of the )Iastabz; for it was in the direction of the
setting suu that his soul would cross the threshold of the next
world. The sarcophagus is usually an oblong stone box with a tlat
lid, containing a wooden coffin tapering towards the feet, with a
human face represented on it at the head. Within this tyot'lin was
placed the body, either wrapped in a Moth, cr without any [rover-
ing. There is here no tram of the careful mummifyiug process of
a later age.

The ornamentation of the interior of the mas.tabas is very rich.
