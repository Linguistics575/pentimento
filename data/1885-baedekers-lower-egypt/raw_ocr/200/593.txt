Khidern (Khatem) is the ancient Egyptian word for an enclosed
space, a fort, or castle; and 5arlnlt. (pl. f?eribit) signifies a hill, or
peak, in the language of the Betluins in the peninsula; so that
Serébit el-Kluhlern signifies 'the heights of the 5ortiMd place”. In
the neighbourhood copper and mafkat were formerly worked, and the
plateau Was occupied with smelting furnaces, and a temple where
the miners and the overseers assembled to celebrate various festi-
vals. The dwellings of the workmen and their overseers, and the
magazines, must have been nearer the mines, several of which in
the MTsdi Naeb (see below) still yield a considerable quantity of
copper. Most of the monuments on the plateau were erected by the
superior mining ofiitrials, who wished to hand down their names
and merits to posterity, mentioning the king in whose reign they
obtained their appointments, the mineral (mafkat and ore] they
worked, the number of miners they employed, the zeal with which
they performed their duties, and the accidents which befall them
during their term of oftiee. Victories over the native mountain
tribes are sometimes also mentioned.

The large heaps of black stone in the vicinity, resembling the
slag from a foundry, are partly of natural form; but artificially
produced slag also occurs in the valleys between Farbr)t. e1-Khidem
and the Widi Nagb. The old mines were re-discoveretl by ML
Holland, a member of the last English Survey expedition, while
others had already been diseovered and described by Riippell in the
Widi Nagh. It appears from the inscriptions that the mines of
f.%rbilt. el-Khédem, like those of the W3di Maghéra, were first sunk
in the reign of Suefrn (p. 491) at an early period of the Primmval
Monarchy, end that they were worked for a still longer period than
the latter, and certainly down to the 20th Dynasty. The eartouche
of Ramses w. is also said to have been found here. The mines
of yrlu5t. cl-lihaidem must therefore have been worlsuu1 after the pe-
riod of the Exodus, while in those of the Wadi Magluim the name
of Ramses IL, the Pharaoh of the oppression, is the last Which
occurs in the inscriptions.

About 3/4 hr. to the S.E. of the plateau are several tombs of the
18th Dyn. discovered by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, probably those of
everscers of the mines. At a distance of 2 hrs. theme the remains
of miners' dwellings Were found by Major Macdonald (p. 490).

A visit to these monuments takes half-a-day. Those who desire
to make a thorough inspection, and to visit the Wadi Nash, will
require a whole day. They should then walk from Farbii.t el Culem
along the hills to the W0di Naeb, at the entrance to which are a
spring, shaded by palms, some ruins, the traces of old gardens,
and a quantity of slag brought from the mines, Ir/e hr. to the N.W.

'We find here a number of umisuzuly thick mym 0f earthy oxide tot'
