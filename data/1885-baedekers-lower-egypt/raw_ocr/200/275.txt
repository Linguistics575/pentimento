tion, in whieh all nations, customs, and epochs are represented,
- a living museum of all imaginable and unimaginable phases
of existence, of refinement and degeneracy, of civilisation and
barharism, of knowledge and ignorance, ofpagauisrn, Christianity,
and Jloltaruiuedar1ism1. In the Boulevards of Paris and on London
Bridge I saw bat the shadow, and at Alexandria the prelude only,
of the Babel of Cairo, to which the Roman or the Venetian carnival
is tame and commonplace. These marvellous scenes cannot fail to
strike every one, and particularlythe uninitiated new-comer, most
forcibly. In order to enjoy them thoroughly, one cannot help

of forcing one's way possessed by the camel ofburden'. (B. Gollz.)
There is, however, no great difficulty in forcing one's way through
the crowd in the Muski, although the chaotic, carnivel-like sneue
which it presents can hardly he depicted in too bright colours.
Most of the streets in the old part of the town are still un-
paved antl inaccessible to carriages, and they are too often
excessively dirty. The Khedive, however, is annually increasing
the number of oi1rtiage-ways by the demolition of old streets and
the erection of buildings in the modern style. The lanes separat~
ing the rows of houses in the Arabian quarter are so narrow that
there is hardly room for two riders to pass, and the projecting
balconies ofthe harems with their gratings often nearly meet. The
new quarter on the W. side of the city possesses broad, shadeless
streets, handsome avenues, and the beautiful Ezhekiyeh Garden
(p. 258); bat Oriental life seems to iiad this atmosphere uncon-
genial, and it must therefore he sought forin the old quarters, and
particularlyin the Muski, the Cl1iefbusiruess thoroughfare. The busy
trat'fie in this street often presents an 'interminable, ravelled, and
twisted string of men, women, and animals, of walkers, riders, and
carriages of every description. Add to this the cracking of the,
drivers' whips, the jingling of money at the table of the changers
established at every corner of the street, the rattling of the brazen
vessels of the water-earners, the moaning of the camels, braying
of donkeys, and barking of dogs, and you have a perfect pande-
monium’. Europeans, and even ladies, may ride with perfect safety
through the midst of all this confusion, and they will often have
opportunities of observing most picturesque and amusing scenes.
The denseness of the crowd sometimes seems to preclude the pos-
sibility of farther progress, but the hammir, or donkey-hoy, is

pretty sure to elbow a passage Without much iUftieulty.
