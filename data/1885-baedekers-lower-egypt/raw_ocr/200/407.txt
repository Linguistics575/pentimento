the ceiling, and kept in its place by iron cramps, here arrests the
farther progress of the explorer. The hardness of the material of
which this barrier emisists compelled the Arabian treaguNy-hilntors
(p. 352) to avoid it, and to force a new passage CPI. d) through
the softer limestone. This is the roughest and most awkward spot
on the whole route. Beyond the rugged blocks at this point we
enter a passage CPI. eel, ascending at about the same angle, and
41 yds. in length, beyond which lies the GreatHall on. h). Before
entering the latter, we diverge at the point e, by the horizontal
passage ef, to the so-eellerl Chamber ofthe Queens (P1. y). This
passage is at Mst 3 ft. 9 in. only in height, but at a distance of
(31/2 yds. from the ehatnber the llooring sinks a little, so that the
height inureases to 5ft. 8ineues. The N. and S. sides of the chamber
are earh 17 ft. in length, and the li. and W. sides 18 ft. 10 inches.
The heightis 20 ft. iin., including the pointed roof: which consists
of enormous blocks of wuk placed obliquely and leaning against
each other, and projecting beyond the sides of the walls to a
distance of 51/2 ft. into the surrounding masonry. We now
return to e amt enter the Great Ilnll (Pl. o, the hztlldsomest of the
comparatively small chambers in the interior of this eolossai mass
of masonry. The jointing and polish of the tine-grained Mo-
hattam limestone form rm unsurpnssable marvel of skilful masonry.
As the vis'rtor can now breathe (Hill look about him with more
freedom, he may verify the eeenracy of'Ahdcllatifs remark, that
neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the joints of
the stones. The Great Hall is 28 it, high and 155 ft. long. The
lower part is 5â€™: ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, beyond the
last of the panels of stone. each of which is 1 ft. 8 in. thick and
2 ft. high, is 7 ft. in width. The seven courses of stone composing
the roof, whieh seem to have been arranged in imitation of the
arel1-prineiple, project slightly one above the ether, serving to
strengthen and support the horizontal slabs which form the ceilino:
The parallel incisions in the pavement and on the walls were pe -
haps used to facilitate the introduction of the sarcophagus, and they
now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At the end of the
Great Hall is a small horizontal passage, 22 ft. long and 3 ft. 8 in.

which was once closed by four trap-doors of granite. The remains
of these slabs, in their pendent position, should be noticed. We
next enter the King's Churnber Cpl. k), the most interesting of all.
The N. and S. sides are each l7 ft. in length, the F1. and W. sides
341/2 ft., and the height is K) ft.; the tloor of the chamber is
1391/2 fr. above the plateau mi which the Pyramid stands. The
chamber is entirely lined with granite, and is roofed with nine
enormous slabs of granite, earh [8% ft. in length, the ends of
which rest on the lateral walls It now eontaitrt nothing but an
