find nothing. The vessel containing the treasure is said to have
consisted of an emerald, and to have been taken by Mimftn to
Baghdad. Other fabulous stories are told of golden statues set with
jewels, amulets7 talisrnairs, and mummies, which wore found here
in a golden cabinet, in a box in the form of a human figure, and in
a stone sareophagus. )Iahrizi speaks of the sarcophagus which still
lies in the royal tom%ehamber as in his time, and another author
says that its cover here the words-. 'AU, Amad built the Pyramid
in 1000 days'.

We possess no cletinite information concerning the opening of the
second Pyramid, but 1Abdella.tii, who Was himself present, gives
us an account of the attempted destruction of the Third Pyramid.
As early as the reign of Saladin (All 1109-93), the vizier Fpsra-
lsu1sh used the Small Pyramids as a quarry for the material of which
he constructed various imposing ediiiees in Cairo, including the
Citadel. E]-’\[e]ik e1-'Aziz '0thmin Cll93-00), Saladin’s successor,
was persuaded by his eonniers to demolish the so-eaned ‘I’ted Pyra-
mid', or that of Menkaura, The sultan accordingly organised a party
of workmen for the purpose, under the supervision of some of his
nobles, caused a camp to he pitched at the base of the Pyramid,
and ordered them to begin the work of destruction. After eight
months ofineessant labour, however, the senseless undertaking,
which had cost enormous sums and prodigious exertions, bad to be
abandoned, Gotlfmg was eifeewd by the undertaking', says ‘Ahdel-
latif, 'but the shameful mutilation of the Pyramid, and the de-
monstration of the weakness and incapacity of the mplorers. This
occurred about the year 593 of tho Ilcgira CA, U. 1196). When
the stones that have been removed are regarded at the present day,
one would think that the structure had been entirely destroyed,
but when one then looks at the Pyramid itself, one sees that it has
suffered no material damage, and that a part of its inm:ustatiou has
been stripped oif on one side only’. - The Pyramids were also used
as quarries at a later period, and even during the régixne of Mo-
l1ammed'Ali, who moreover is said to have been advised by a
prophet to destroy them. With the aid of gunpowder he might per-
haps have succeeded in o oeting what the workmen of the Khalif
had failed to do, had not his European friends represented to him
that the blaming operations would probably damage, P. city of Cairo.

The first modern traveller WLIu carefully and sun essfullv examined
the Pyramids was Nicholas Shaw in 1721; but he still eute ed the
notion that the Sphinx had a subterranean ennncctiun with the Great
Pyramid. He was fulluwed by Narden in1737' Pommke in 1713, who
