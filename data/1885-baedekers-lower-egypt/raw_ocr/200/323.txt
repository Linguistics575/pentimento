Most of the students, particularly those whose native tongue is not
Arathic. begin their university education by learning the Arabic grammar
('ilm enrmllm). The next branch of study is religious science ('I'lm el-
L'eldm), the intruductiun to Which mtusiste of it ser s of preparatory lec-
tures Ot1 the attributes of God and the prophet (rum ct tmzlzfd, i. e, the
doctrine of the unity ofGod‘ The chief attributes of God are said
to be the following tw vlve: existence, source of e11 being, eternity, in-
dependence, unity, ornniputenire, will (in accordance with which he rules
the universe, men heing powerless to save himself trom sin or to be
pious without the assistance and grace of God), omniscieuue Cor know-
ledge of everything that happens between the lowest fuandstious tif the
earth end the loftiestheights or the ihasurmeut), life, vision (which enables
him to see everything everywhere, without the aid etiight, and Withnut
eyes), hearing (without em, in the same way as he knows without it
brain, and overthrows without hands), and speeehtin alanguage that hats
had no beginning, nmnguage w'1u1mrtpetters tor sounds, which is inherent
in his netnre, and does not resemble human speech).

After having completed his course orreltg'uous instruction, the student
proceeds to study law mm el-fik.rrh

'Juris rudenee', says Ihn Jihahhhr, one of the greatest of Arahian
thinkers, " e knowledge of the precepts of God in relation to the itctious
of men, some of which it is our duty to perform, while others are for
hidden, or recommended or petmipuv, and [his knowledge is derived
from the book of God, he the Karim, from the Sunni; (i. e, tradition),
and from the inferences drawn by the law giver [Mohammad] from suf-
ent materials Mfiorded by the Koran The study of Jaw is therefore
based npun the exegesis " the Koran (tafsir) and Jr tradition {hadith}

The science nf law is divided into two branches: -

(U The doctrine of the chief Religious Commandments of EHslfnn,
vi (in Ethau id, or the veeognitioa of God's unity and of Mohammed
as h prnphet; th) The Sam and Tahdwz, " the duty of repeating the

Besides these lending hmtehes of instruction, logic Ci [M eC-mtvst.i.ky
rhetoric (rim elmtaztvli wul Dayan), the art uf 'oetrr con et (army, the

The above list of the subjects taught at the must important ofllohztur
medan schools will serve to convey an idea of the intellectual condition
of Orientals M the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
culture consists in the entire absence of independent thuught, ia r3Orist5-
quence erwhieh they are the more recipients of the knowledge of the
past. Their minds are thus exclusively occupied with the lowest grede
ofintelleetual work, their principal task consisting in the systemetie
a 'augement 0r cncyclupimiic compilation of the knowledge handed down
to them. Some of the shekhs of theAthn' are men of mar cllolls erudi-
tton, hut they are destitute of creative power, or ofthe ahi by to utilise
their old materials for the manstrrurtioa of any new ediiiuus, and they ad-
here faithfully to the notion of their forefathers that the greatest
triumph of mental labuur is to learn by heart :my work of acknowledged
literary value. Donht and eriti ism, which so often serve to open up fresh
sources of knowledge, are unknown to them; with natural history they
are entirely nnacqutrinted; and even geometry, nlgubl'n, and astronomy, so
assiduously cultivated by the ancient Arabs, have now fallen into ob-
livion. Sn well satisfied are they. moreover, with their own wisdom,
that they utterly despise the seieutuh, pursuits of the Western werhh
