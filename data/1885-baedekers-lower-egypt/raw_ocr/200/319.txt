Various data regarding the building ofthe mosque and the leg-
acies bequeathed for its preservation were engraved on a long
marble frieze on the okella which adjoins the editieiy on the right,
and a considerable part of it is still to be seen in the place. The
Liwin contains good mosaitst Some of the handsome perforated
stucco windows are still preserved, but the bronze gratings have
been removed, and the openings built up. Several severe ty0tOvJts
between the French troops and the Mamclnkes are said to have
taken place around this mosquet

The admirably executed gateway with its yendentives, and the
wall enclosing the three monuments, were erected by Mohammed,
an iutendant of the Wsh, about the year IM'?. of the Ilegim,

Adjoining the mosque is the Jlibed er-Ili/m, a mausoleum
with a remarkably (leyressml dome, next to which is the Tomb of
the Mother of h'urebey, h poorly executed work. The form ot' the
openings in the letter is worthy of notice, as the niches with straight
sides, plnred below an acute angle, though not uncommon, seldom
occur quite alone, The oldest arches " the kind are to be found
in the 'Amr and Azhar mosques.
