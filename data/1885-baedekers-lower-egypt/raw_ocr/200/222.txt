XI. Works on Egypt.

The tgaveller who desires more than a mere superfieiel acquain-
tance with the 1and of the Pharaohs, the history of which is the
most ancient and in some respects the most interesting in the
world, should of course before leaving home read some of the
standard works on the subject, and also seleet a number of others
for reference or entertainment during the journey. This is all the
more necessary if the traveller is entirely ignorant of the ancient
and modern languages of the country, in which case he will tind it
diftiealt, if not impossible, to institute independent enquiries as
to its manners, literature, and art. From the appended list, which
might easily be extended, the traveller may make a selection in
accordance NI ith hi individual taste. Those indicated by asterisks
