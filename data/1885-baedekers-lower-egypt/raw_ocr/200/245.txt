reach his horse's knees. His hérse soon afterwards stumbled over a
dead body and wetted its knee in human blond, whereupon the emvcmr
Was pleased to regard this as a sign that the unhappy citizens had been
srdiiciently chastised. Out of gratitude, particularly to the horse, they
are said to have erected the brazen horse which was kauwa as that Hf
Diocletian. That the horse did not, however, occupy the summit ot the
column . proved by an ancient illustrated plan of Aiexnudrie, in which
Pompe 's Pillar is represented with the figure oramh rm the hip. The
iuseription, moreover, indicates that the column was erected by Pom-
peius IL, whose prefecture did notbegin tin A.D. 3m. whereas the defeat
and death of Achillcus took place about 296. The column has, therefore,
no connection with the story of the heme horse, hut was probably
erected ehietly in commemoration of a gift of com presented by Diocletian
to the citizens during e period ot scarcity,

Near the extensive cemetery at the foot of the column are 8ev-
eral fragments of columns which probably belonged to the Serapeum
(p. 211). If we are to believe the accounts of Iralirisi and 'Abdell-
atif, this temple was encircled by a colounade of 400 columns7
and once contained the library which was burned by 'Omar.

Following the road a little farther, and diverging to the right
near a manufactory, we skirt the S. slope of a low plateau and soon

reach the Catacombs (Pl. D, 7), about l/e M. from Alexandria.
From this point to the vicinity of the Sempenm (see ahove) the slope
ing, rocky ground was honersuu1bed by a great number of subterranean
passages and tornlerrhruubers, but as there is now nqumy here, all traces
uf the ancient Coustvuctirms will soon he obliterated. Sev ral ornamented
sarcophagi am still seen lying about. The workmen nlfer c s, arhiefly
or the time of (Junstantiue, for sale, and it is from that period that the
construction of the cataevuubs probably dates. One only or the tomh-chhm-
hers, which was discovered in Imb' is toiemhiy preserved, and it is now
expused to view owing to the fall of the Staries above it, We enter by
a thtleu gate, generally open, and descend by an ancient flight of steps
on the W. side to a group ot three chambers. On the left t side) we
observe an apse with traces of paintings and Greeki ii us (Christ
between Peter and Andrew in the middle; on each side a. Irtve-fesst). T
Tlse vault opposite the entrance, with remains ot tasteful decoration in
stucco, cantnins three recesses, the pai tings in which represent (w.
side» the Marius at the Sepulcllre; (X. side) Christ, like the Egyptian
god news, treading on serpents, with a quotation from Ps. sei. I', ', and
ti; side) the Ascension Uu each side ot the central recess is a large
Greek miss with the in ripliou at the four comers IC' NO Ill [Jesus
Christ conquers). These ve v rude frescoes probably date from about
the Glh cent., being doubtless a second restoration of the original, as we
still iind three layers of plaster, one above the other, and each hearing
traces of painting. The third vault, a long chamber on the B side, con-
tains sixteen recesses, which Were uncc closed by means " upright slabs
uf stone. A itight of steps descending hence to the s., the outlet of
which is now built up, led to a lower series of tumhs. "
We now return to the Pane de la Colonne Pompie (PL 38),
and follow the Rue de la Coloune back to the Li/su.) Place Me'-
hémet-Ali (p. QISL from the N.W. comer of which diverges
the Rue rhis ct- Tin, the longest street in - cxandria, This
street deseribes a 15 Me curve through the Arabian quarter situated
on the ancient neptastadium (p. 217), traverses the Turkish
quarter on what was formerly the island ofPharos (p. 217], some of
the houses in which present a very handsome appearance, and leads

to the Viceroyal Palace on the Bis et-Tin CPI, 43), or 'pr0morrt0ry
