At the 80th kilometre stone the Canal enters Lake Timsah, or
the Crocodile Lake o. 40N, on the N, bank of Which lies the town
of Idma‘ilig/a. The lake, which is now about 6 sq. M. in area, and
of a beautiful pale blue eolour, was, before the construction of the
Canal, a mere pond of brackish water, and fall of reeds. On 18th
Nov. 1862 the water of the Mediterranean was let into this basin,
which is traversed by two artif'uOl channels for the passage of

While the Canal was being constructed this town was the cen-
tral point of the works, and the residence ofnmnerous officials and
traders, so that its tridfio soon became very considerable, and it
has even been extolled by modemrporyts as a ‘woudet of the desert'.

dry, notwithstanding the proximity of the 1vater. The ground,
which has been reclaimed from the desert by means of irrigation,
has been planted with tasteful gardens. On the N.E. side of the
town are the ehiteau of the Khedive and the Waterworks; OR the
W. side is the Arabian quarter.

The best way of spending a few leisure hours here is to visit the
hill of Et-Gisr (see below; 1-2 hrs. ; donkey 1:1). The route to it
