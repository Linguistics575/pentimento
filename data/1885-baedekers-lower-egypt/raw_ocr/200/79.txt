lnxmlutiow THE NILE. 57

Egypt, The breadth of the cultivable alluvial soil corresponds with
tho above varying ssidth, but nowhere exceeds ll miles. The soil
deposited by the Nile averages 33-38 ft. deep in Egypt, but near
lialytm at the head of the Delta it increases to about 50 ft., the
lvottom of it being at places below the level of the sea. The bed of
the river is also of considerable depth, and at low water the mud-
hanks (gef) rise above its surface to a height of 25 ft. in Upper
Egypt, and 14 ft. at Cairo. These are also the depths of the various
irrigation wells.

Throughout the whale © of Egypt the Nile mud r8515 an a bed of sea-
mnd. The whole cm‘mtry between the first cataract and the “editor
rmnezm was formerly a narrow estuary, which was prubehly filled by
degrees during the pleioccue period with lagoon deposits, washed down
from the ('ryslalline Hztbesh. At a later period. when Egypt had risen
from the sea Cand after the isthmus had been farmed), the river forced
its passase through these deposits of mud. sweeping away mzmy of the

Nothing certain is known regarding the average increase of the
alluvial land, all the calculations regarding it having hitherto been
based on erroneous or insufficient data. Thus the Nilometer of
antiquity furnishes the depth relatively to the level of the sea, bat
not absolutely. Thethicknessofearth accumulated around buildings
of known ago has also been found a fallacious guide; and lastly
local measurements lead to no result. as the river oftrrneaprieiously
washes away what it has deposited in previous years. An approxi-
mate calculation might possibly be made if the proportion of solid
matter annually brought down by the river could be ascertained,
hat no investigation of this kind has ever been made, It has some-
times been asserted that the desert has begun to emyroaehupon the
cultivated part of the valley, but Sit G. Wilkinson has shown, that,
while the sand of the desert may be advancing at places, the eultiv-
able bed of the valley is steadily increasing in thickness and width.

The INUNDATION, as is obvious from what has already been
said, is more or less favourable according to the greater or less
amount of rain that falls among the Abyssinian mountains, for
that which falls in Central Africa is a more constant quantity,
being regulated by the inllueuoe of the tCade-winds, Like the

by a few days only, and in its depth by several yards. At the be-

15th and 20th of July the increase becomes very rapid. Towards
