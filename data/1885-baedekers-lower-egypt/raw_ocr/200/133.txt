works of every kind except dramas. The most ancient hieratie
papyrus now cstant was written in the third millennium before
Uhrist The language used in the hieroglyphic and hicratic writ-
ings alike Was the ancient sacred dialect of the priests. The
Imnolic writing, which Was first employed in the 9th century
before Christ, diverges so widely from the hieroglyphic that in
some of the symbols the original sign from which they Were derive
cd is either not traceable, 01' can only be recognised with difficulty.
The sign of the owl, for example, Was curtailed to D . This writing
was ehiefly used in social and commercial intercourse; as, for
example, in contracts andletters, whenceitwas sometimes termed
the 'letter character’ by the G'reeks. The more the spoken language
diverged from the sacred dialect, which assumed a fised form at a
very early period, the more urgent became the want of a new mode
of writing appropriate to the lrviaglanguvge. Thus arose the demotie
style, and lastly, in the 3rd century after Christ7 the Coptic, in
which the language spoken at that time by the Christian Egyptians
was written, the characters being Greek, with a few supplementary
symbols borrowed from the demotic (such as g sh, qf, e, M,
'ty, c: c, x j, and the syllabic‘!’ m. Many Coptic writings,
v',lliehly of a religious character, have been handed down to us, the
fitu1st of them being the books of the 01d and New Testament.

Down to the, end of the 18th century scholars had been misled
in their endeavours to find a clue to the hieroglyphic writing by l
work of the Egyptian itrarnrnarian Hompotlon, translated into
Greek, who represented the characters as being purely symbolical,
and as having each an independent meaning ofits own. At length
in 1700 M. Boussmd, a French ofiieer of artillery, discovered at
Rosetta a trilingual inscription (pp. 449 et ser), in l1ierogrlypld"
and demotie characters and in Greek. The demotie part of the in<
smiption was examined by M. Silvestrc de Sacy, a French Savant,
and Hr. Aukerblad, a Swede, in 1802, and, chiefly owing to the
exertions of the latter, the signifieation of a number of the symbols
was ascertained. In 181r18 the hieroglyphic part of the inscrip-
tion was studied by Dr. Th. Young, an English scholar, who, by
comparing it with the demotic part, succeeded in dividing it into
a number ot'rrorresponding groups, and, by dixecting his attention to
the eartouehes (p, I17), discovered the siguifieation of several of the
hioroglyphiis symbols. In 1821 Fre ms Chttmpotlion, usually sur-
namvd Le Jenna, who possessed an intimate acquaintance with the
Coptic language, and literature, directed his attention to the hiero-
glyphiss, and in the course of the fol‘mhing year discovered the
hieroglyphic alphabet, which afforded him tt clue to the whole of
.ihe ancient Egyptian literature. His method, which he has ex-
plained in his hieroglyphic grammar, though at first vehemently
opposed, soon obtained able adherents. who after his early death
in 1832 zealously took up and prosecuted the same line of research.
