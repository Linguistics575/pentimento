siderable,, as there is only one story, we ahserve a stone surface cont
sisiiug nflitrge slabs. Descending again, and louking into the lsalls,we may
ht sent: the whole series borne hy twentyrsevcn iheuulithic columns. The
walls also are euustrusted " stones of similar size. At the end of this
structure, Which is LIIUI'E than it stadium in length, is the tomb, consists

length and uf equal height. The deceased, whn is buried here, is called
Isuiuhdes. It is also asserted that so many palates were built, heeeuse it
" s the custom for all the homes, represented by their 'uagrurtes, with
their priests and victims, to hssemhle here to oirer sttetriii0e and gifts to the
gods, and to deliberate hi: the most important concerns. Each home
then tuok possession of the hall destined for it. Sailing about at hundred
stadia beyond this point, we next reach the town of Atrsinois', etc. This
description of Strhho is eorstitaned by the contents of two papyri, (me of
which is in the museum of Gizeh, the other in private possession tMr.
Hood). The deities of 66 districts are enumerated here. '24 of whom be

It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings
of Nile hrinks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as
tombs. Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the splen-
dour of the old ‘Wonder of the world'. Except some blocks of lime-
stone, nothing remains of the extensive structures once erected
here, save the pyramid 'at the end of the labyrinth'.

To the N. or the pyramid Nv, Flinders PMvie discovered some mummy
coith1s with carefully painted heads (how in London). of still greater
value are the portraits found at cl-Rcbeydt, 13 ll. to the N.E. of Me-
dittet ct-Ftty-im, which were purchased and brought to Europe by t Theo-
dore Graf.

Lake Mums. The uhjeet uf Lake eris, which has long since been
dried up, was to receive the superthrous water in the case of too high
an inundation, and to distribute its contents over the fields when the
Uvertlnw was insufficient. Strabu describes Litke Moms in the follow-
ing terms: "Owing to its size and depth it is capable or receiving the
supeeabundaucs of water during the inundation, without overflowing the
11abitatiurss and crops; but later, when the water subsides, and after the,
lake has given up its excess through one of its two mouths, huth it and
the canal retain water enough for pm-puses of irrigation. This is 36601114
plished by natural means, but at both ends of the canal there are else
lock-gates, by means of which the engineers clln regulate the inthvc
and efflux of the water.' The lock-ghte, which in ancient times ad-
mitted the water conducted from the Nile hy the canal into the lake,
was probably situated near the modern eerahmt (see below), the name of
which is supposed to he derived from the old Egyptian 'RP-hun' or 'Le-
rum”, ine, 'the mouth of the brke', and the site of which was prhhhhiy
once, occupied by the town of Ptelemais.

There is .t diifereuce hf ttpiuiou as to the Situation and Fame 0/ the
Auciant Lake. Linanl Bey, arguing from the cot1sidevable tiilrei-ence of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket el- Kav1n (Lake
of the Horus, p. 41:5t conld never have formed patrt of Lake Mleris, as was
formerly supposed, and he "assigns to the letter umueh smaller area than
was attributed to it under the ehxliei- theory.P1acing it farther to the
