vannm help feeling that the stvle fails to give entire :rsthetic
satisfaction. Want of symmetry in plan, poverty of articulation,
insnt'tleieney of plastic decoration. and an incongruous mingling of
stone and wood, are the imperfections which strike most northern
rnlirs. The architects, in fact, bestowed the whole of their attention
on the decoration of snrfaros; and down to the present day the
Arabian artists have always displayed targrcater ability in tracing
elegant outlines, and designing the most complicated ornaments
and vyrometrieal iigures on plane surfaces, than in the treatment
and pruportioning of masses, Although we occasionally sec dim-
rnltics of construction well overcome, as in the case of the interior
of the Bit eo-, 15:. those instances seem rather to be successful
oxperiiuerits than the result of seieutitie workmanship. The real
cxm‘llencc 0f the Arabian architects lay in their skill in masking
abrupt angles by the use of 'staSetitcs' or brackets.

If we enquire into the ranges of these defeats in the develop-
ment of art “9, shall iind that the climate is one of the principal,
lts remarkable mildncss and the mroncss of rain have enabled ar-
Cllitm'tx to dispense uith quuh that appears essential to the iuhidr-
itant of more northern latitudes; and hence the imperfect de.,
velopnwnt and frequent absence of cornices. The, extraordinary
durability of wood in Egypt, again, has led to its being used in
the construction of walls, and in connnction with stone, in a man-
ner which would never occur to northern architects. Another
circumstance unfavourable to the development " native art has
doubtless been the ease with which the arelyiteets obtained abun-
dance of pillars and capitals in ancient buildings ready to their
hand. There were also political obstacles to the progress of art,
sunh as frequent intestine struggles and dissensions, and the
sway of despotic rulers and their senile oft1eersi and, lastly, the
characteristic Egyptian tenacity and velmration for tradition and
religious preeept have not been without their irriluenee, The ori-
ginal design ofthe mosque, foroxampln, was borrowed froniMccca.
and no desiation could he made from its plan; and this accounts
for the invariable recurrence of the same forms in the mosques of

unvatimis, but they never . led to revert sooner or later to tho
c-tnhlishexl style. The cxterual architecture of private houses,
however, being unfettered by religious considerations, might have
pruzn-ssrll more favrmralsly hut l'urtho powerful iniliieneC of super-
stitinu and fear. An external display of wealth, according to the
popular nation, draw upon its possessor the 'evil eye' of the cove-
