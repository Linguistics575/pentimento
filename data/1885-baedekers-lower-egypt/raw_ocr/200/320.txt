‘230 Route 3. mnm. Tombs ut' the li'halffsi I

In the same strept. n few paces farther to the s., we observe on
the right the long Ulccttu le'ait Bay, with its carefully executed
gateway and eharaeioristie ornamentation The faqade is built of
massive stone, and is tolerably regular, but the mushrehiyehs are
of inferior workmanship and probably of later date. The gate is
mounted with large iron nails. The ground-Mor is wrulred, while
the upper floor has an open ceiling. The iydifusry was completed in
the year 877 of the llegira.

A little farther to the s., projecting in an angle, is a public
fountain now in ruins, also erected by Igait Bey. The shallow
niches, the upper parts of which are shell-shaped, are in the form
of fantastic arches.

Beyond this sehil is an open space. on the right side of which
is the *Tomh-Mosqne ofKait Bey LP- 268], the iinest editiee among
the Tombs of the Khalifs, with a lofty dome and beautiful minarets,

The Sahn el-Girnir was once ektsed by a mushrcbtyeh
lantern, which fell in 1872. The rest of the edilice has an open
ceiling, as in the case of
the mandatas(p. 185). The
Dikkch, in the form ofa hal-
eeny, resembles that in the
mosque of liait Bey adja-
centtothe mosqueot'Ftm.
The details are very elab-
orately executed. Within
the mausoleum are shown
two stones, one of red,
and the other of black
granite, which are said
to have been brought from
Mceea by Jiait liey, and
to bear impressions of the
feet of the prophet. One of
them is covered with a
wooden canopy, and the
other with a bronze ilome.
The mosque also contains
