The roof, with its 011011 timber-work and octagonal recesses, eon-
strneted of the trunks of date-palms and overlaid with sycamore
wood, formerly rested on 158 rectangular pillars of brick, coated
with stucco. The friezes, bearing Cutie inscriptions, are also of
sycamore wood.

The outer court on the w. side contains a .S'kiyeh (P. O) and
the singular 5linaret (P1. 8), with Its external winding staircase,
the design of which is said to have been suggested to '.ruh1n by a
strip of paper wound round his linger, and which is the only one
of the kind except that of the Mahkhara of the Gimi' Hakim
(p. 279). The minaret commands a good survey of the oldest build-
ings of Cairo, but, owing to its ruinous eomlrtiou,the ascent is now
prohibited. (Fee to the attendant hh ho shows the Lhrin 1-2 piastres).

Outside the entrance to the mosque we turn to the right, and
then to the right again. Passing the S. side of the mosque, where
we observe several handsome r1u1shrcbiyebs on the left side of the
street, and turning a little to the loft, we traverse several lanes and
alleys, built on what was formerly the hill of Jial'at el-Kebsh
(p. 265), and reach the small, but onee handsome -

The door, with its bronze covering, is about L5 ft. in height.
The mosque is about 26 yds. in length and 22 yds. in width. The
attics have almost entirely fallen in, but a graceful minaret still
exists. Opposite the liibla is a gallery, serving as a dikkeh, which
is accessible from the staircase to the minaret. The principal
arches, which approach the horseshoe shape, though distinctly
pointed, are tastefully decorated. The mamhar is richly embellished
with wood-earving. The mosaics on the pavement and the walls
are also worthy of notice. Bakshish, 1/; piastre for each person.
