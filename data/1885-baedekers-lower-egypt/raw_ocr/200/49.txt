Boundaries and Area (comp. Map, p. 30). The countries gab-
jeet to the supremacy of the Khedive embrace by far the greater
part of N.E. Africa, or nearly the whole of the territory adjacent to
the Nile. The natural boundaries of the vassal kingdom founded
by Mohammed 'Ali and bequeathed by him to his successor in 18ri8
are formed by the Mediterranean Sea on the N., the Libyan Desert
on the w., the lied Sea on the E., and Abyssinia, which may be
called the Quito of Africa, on the S.E. These boundaries include
EGYPT PROPER, with the tive oases of the Libyan desert and part of
the peninsula of Sinai, the NUBIAN VALLEY op THE NILE, with the
Nubian desert regions, and lastly the so-ealled EGYPTIAN Stmks,
which consists ofthe districts of T0ka, Sennh, and Irordo/Tn. The
Khedive Isma'il, whose dominions were secured to him as a fiet
hereditary in the male line, extended his boundaries still farther to
the s., S.E., and S.W. Thus he purchased Sautkirs and Masau‘a on
the Red Sea, and Zthy and Berbera on the Gulf of‘Aden, four im-
portant seaports and commercial places, together with the coast
districts adjoining them, which formerly belonged directly to the
Turkish government; and in the same way he acquired part of the
coast of the Snmvili, extending to the equator, a district replete
with still untouched natural treasuresl The districts of the Bogus
and Gulubat m] the frontiers of Abyssinia have been occupied with
a view to protect important commercial routes, and together with the
Somali territory ofHarurhave been annexed to the Egyptian empire.
IMr-h'tir, once an entirely independent principality in the Moh;uu-
medan l:3iidin, and the terror of its neighbours, has lately been con-
quered by the Egyptians, and the empire of the Kheilive has thus
been increased by four very populous provinces, while Mohammed
'Ali, who Was less fortunate in his designs on that region, succeeded
in gaining possession of Eorilofin only, the E. part of it. Bogos,
Galahat, and the other provinces adjoining the N. hoatier of Atys-
sinia are, however, constantly exposed to the inroads of their war»
like neighbours, and it will probably be impossible in the long run to
resist the importunate demand of the Abyssinian monarch for their
restitution. The rebellion which broke out in most of the Mahom-
medau Provinces of theEgyptian SOin in 1883 threatens to entail
the entire loss of IsmaWs acquisitions to the S. of Egypt proper.
