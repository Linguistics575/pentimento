of Ita. As Apis is associated with Ptah, so
this bird by the side of lla is a symbol of

presented with the head of a hawk, and co-
ioured red. He holds in his hands the sprl-
bols of life and sovereignty, and wears on

Tum, or Alum. a manifestation of 11a,
whose name is perhaps akin to .tem.i, signi-
