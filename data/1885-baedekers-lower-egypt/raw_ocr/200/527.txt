eller to complete this circuit of the bed of the lake, which is now dried
up. Recently, however, Mr. F.0npe Whitehouse, relying upon, the great
circumference assigned by Hcrodutus (II, 149) to the lake, of 3000 Malia
(reduced by Linant to 360) or about 335 M. (Pliny says 230 21.), and upon
measurements made by himself on the spot, ascribe: a considerably larger
area to the lake than Lina)“, and maintains that it extended on the SW.
tu the “'ddi Haydn. It is not improbable that in ancient times nanrly the
whole of the Fayfsm could he laid under water, so that even the Birket
eluiurin belonged to Lake Mmm, but that the entire system Was meant
for the watering of the Fay1'uu alone and not of the Nile valley or the
Delta. Considering that the bed of the lake must annually have been raised
by the deposit of Nile mud, it follows, that as sunn " the raising nf the
eushrrukrueuts and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become unserviceame, especially after We luckrgates at el-
Lahl'm fell tu decay, each opening at which as Diudurus infurms n9,

water prohahly ran through the Baht 1mm mt, Which has already been
mentioned o. 400). or through the wads Nezlelr (p. MU), both of which
ran into the Birket erFurtist. The true at eunjeuture, thitt the latter

'Libyan S'yrte'), was not an unnatural "ue.

A visit tn the Pyramid of el-Laiutn or Illnhl’m is only interesting tu
thuse who are desirous uf convincing oemselves uf the truth of Linaut's
hypnthesis, and to make the circuit uf the boundaries of the old bed of
the lake [See cthovet. The pyrratnid,whiels is built of Nile bricks, may be
reached from Hawéret el-Frrs.aO in 4-5, Ur from the Lab 'riuth in 3-4 hnurs.
It has been recently heun opened by Fraser. The dxscuvery at an ala-
bastex- altar with the name uf Usertesen II. venders it probable that the
pyramid was built by that monarch. A smaller pyramid lies to theN E.
The remains of the ancient en1hankments, which were toleruhly well
preserved in the time of the Kltalifs, are not without attraction. Those
who are interested in hydraulic engineering should also inspect the en-
trance 0f the Bathr YCrsat' into the Frmim,

Ahtmt 'le M, to the E. of the pyramid of el-Laluh1, Mr. Flinders Pe-
trie discovered a temple in F80, :Ind close beside it the ruins 0fthe town
Ila-Usertesen-hotep, uuw culled Kalmn. The latter was founded by User-
tesen 11 (12th Dyn.) for the labourers on his pyramid. Among the articles
found here Were puttery, flint and copper implements " the 12th Dyn.,
numerous papyri 0f the same period, a statuette of Si-Sehek (13th mm),
a wooden stamp of Apepi, and a large wooden door of Osnrkon t.

Gurub, 11/2 M, to the \V.S.\V, 0f Illallfln and close to the edge of the
desert, owed its origin to Tutmcs UL, who built a temple there. Many
of the inhabitants Were foreigners. Mr. Petrie discovered here fragments
of pottery of the time of Tutzmkhamon aud Ramses IL, resembling the
most ancient potsher© found at Myceme. The eofiin of Ameuturshm
discovered hero. is now at Oxford. The pottery hears Egyptian stamps,
but .1150 letters of tho Cyprian, Pi1omieian, and other nlph' ets.
