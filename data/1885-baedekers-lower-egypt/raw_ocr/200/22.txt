PLA: . The facilities for travel in Egypt are now such that tho
intending visitor may make an outline of his tour at home with
ahuost as great ease as for most of the countries of Europe. During
the travelling season, moreover, the weather is always tine (comp.
p. 67), and never causes disappointment and derangement ofplans
as in most other countries, If, therefore, the traveller from a more
northern region retains his energy in this somewhat enervating
climate, and resists the undoubted attractions of the 'dolee far
nientc', he will have no difilet1lty in disposing of every day to ad-
vantage.

Smsox. From the beginning of November till the middle or
end of April there are but few Jays of bad weather in the interior
of Egypt; the prevalent temperature is that of a delicious spring or
moderate summer, and the few drops of rain that occasionally fall
will hardly be observed by the lluropcau traveller. The fcrtilising
inundation of the Nile (p. 57) has by this time subsided, and the
whole face of the country smiles with fresh \cnlnret About the
end of April, and sometimes as early as March, begins the period
ofthe Khamsinw, U9), l sultry, parching, and cncrvating wind
from the desert, prevailing at longer or shorter intervals for nhout
tifty days (whence the name), though in some seasons it does not
make its appear we at all. Winter is therefore, the, proper season
tor a tour in Egypt. Those travellers. however, who can endure
the fierce, glare of an African summer sun will at that season have,
the advantage of seeing the uxtnnt of the overflow of theNilc, and
will find that price are then generally much lover than in winter.

entirely different from his own: but, if he has been unable to make
up a suitable party at home, he will probahly have an opportunity
