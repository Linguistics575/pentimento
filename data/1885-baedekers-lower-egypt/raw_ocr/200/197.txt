o the court, iudeed, lost their primitive simplicity after their

esiguers had been brought into contact with the colonnaded courts
of Egypt and the Syrian regions, and the Coturunap Court was thus
developed; but the Arabian builders avoided using or imitating
Egyptian columns. They preferred the columns or remains of col-
mnns of the Alexandria“ and Roman period, as the massive pr0<
portions of those of the Egyptian style were less appropriate to a
light and open structure than the columns of the richly decorated
Corinthian order.

They borrowed their cornieings, which they employed bat spar-
ingly, and their mosaic ornamentation, such as araloesquos, from the
Byzantine models which they found in Syria and in the oldest
Byzantine-Christian edifices oCEgypt, and their pointed arches and
domes chietly from the, region of the Euphrates, At the same time
they contrived to impart to their works a eertaiaimlrvidualrty of
character, partly by the elegance of their forms and the preference
given to superficial over architectural decoration, and still more so
by the peculiar character of their ornamentation, resembling the
patterns of textile fabrics, and obviously imitated from wall-
tapestry. Similar patterns appear also in their latticed windows,
their carved doors, and their diapered balconies.

The buierirrr of these buildings is generally plain, consisting of
'A lofty, reetaugalw enclosing “all of quadrangular plan, but not
entirely without relief in tho form of projections and indentations.
in the mosques there are, usually minarets and domes projecting
beyond this general outline, and this is still more commonly the
ease with the public fountains [sehil] and the mosque schools
(medreseh) above them. The portal, on the other hand, and certain
perpendicular sections of the bailding of various widths, generally
reecde * little, the latter a few inches only, being again brought
for“ ard immediately below the cornicing t0 the level of the facade
by means of a 'staSetite' corbelling. In these last also the windows
are often inserted with little regard to symmetry. In the corners of
the projections thus formed, " well as in the other angles of the
building, we frequently find columns of marble inserted, or columns
hewu out of the material ofthe building, and detached to the extent
of three-fonrths of their thiekness. The whole plan of the stone
facades, which is not devoid of a certain degree of grandeur,
reminds us of those of the ancient Egyptian temples, although the
Muslims were generally scrupulously careful to avoid every reserlte
blairce to tho pagan buildings. The portal is generally the richest
part of the tiiilee, The windovs are simpler, and less importance
is given to the priueipal cornice than the height and other (liruen-
sions of the building would seem to demalulr

The Poptals consist of rectangular niches, of such depth as to
