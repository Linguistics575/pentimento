History. Alexandria was founded in BA). 3?,2 by Alexander
the Great, forming a magttiflecat and lasting memorial ofhis Egyp-
tian campaign. With the foundation of the city are associated a
number of legends to the effect that the coast, opposite the island
of Pharos, was specially pointed out by divine omens to the Macc-
donian monarch as a suitable site for the foundation of a new
seaport. t In the time of Alexander there were several harbours on
the N. coast of Egypt. The most important were those of Nat1eratis,
at the w. (Genome) mouth of the Nile, ohieily used by Greek vessels
after the 26th Dynasty (1). 02), and Tanis and Pelusium on the
NE. side of the Delta, at the two emhouchures bearing the same
names, to which Egyptian and Phcenieian vessels only seem to
have been admitted. Alexander, who had overthrown: the barriers
which had hitherto separated the nations dwelling on the E,
shores of the Mediterranean, conceived the plan of founding a
now and splendid seaport town in Egypt, both to facilitate the
i1ow of Egypt's wealth towards Greece and the Archipelago, and
to connect the venerable kingdom of the Pharaohs with that
widely extended. Greek empire which it Was his great ambition
to found. The site chosen by the king was not, however, an
entirely new one. On the coast opposite the island of Pharos
fp. 208), as we learn from the monuments, had long stood the
Egyptian village of Ilhahotis, where, as Strabo records. a guard
Was posted to ensure the safety of the frontier. It seems strange
at first sight that the new seaport should have been founded at
the W. extremity of the coast of the Delta instead of on the old
harbour of Pelusium at the E. end, which lay close to the fled Sea
and to the caravan route between Egypt and Syria, and might easily
have been extended so as to suit Alexander’s requirements. The
fact is, however, that the far-seeing founder really made Ch most
J'udioious choice; for it has been recently ascertained that a current
in the Mediterranean, beginning at the Strait of Gibraltar, wsgl10s
the whole ofthe N. African eoast, end, when it meets the waters of
the Nile, it carries the vast deposits of the rivet towards the E., and
