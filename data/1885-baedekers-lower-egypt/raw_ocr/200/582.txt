garment which they wear when pilgrims at Mecca. After the Sélih
festival (p.020) in the T:slr-Shikh valley the Beduins satyriiiee
animals to Milsa (Moses) here. At the N.E. angle of the rock
whieh bears the chapel there is a hollow, where Moses is said to
have stood when 'the Lord's glory passed by', and the monks show
the impression of the pcophet's head and shoulders on the stone.
The tradition is to the effect that Moses remained fasting for forty
days in a bollow resembling a cistern near the mosque, while writing
the ten commandments.

The view is wild and imposing, Towards the S.W. rise the
barren, sombre, and majestic Jebe] Zehii' and Jebel Katheriu, the
highest mountains in the peninsula. To the SE. we survey the
Sebi'iyeh Valley, near the foot of the Jehc] 3ltisa, which some
authorities take to he the eamping-plaee of the Jews. Above it
rises a multitude of mountain elmius and peaks, piirtttresqnely in-
terspersed with intervening widis. Towards the lg. the Jebel el-
Me'allawi is partieu1arly conspicuous. In clear weather the Red
Flea, and even the greater part of the Bay of‘Ahaha, are visible,
The island of 'trin to the SHE of the peninsula is also sometimes
deseried. Towards the N.W, is the Ris ee-Safefxf, while below us
lie the valleys of the two monasteries, p, yond these, on the right,
framing the picture, rise the Jebel 'Aribeh, El-Fen', and Ey-yum?;
ml the left, the Jebel er-1hablya and Ez-Zafariyeh, with the chateau
oCAbbis Pasha. Towards the N., beyond the lifts ee-Safeiif, we
obtain a glimpse through the defrle 0fthe Nakh el-Wwi of the less
mountainous region of the peninsula in that direction.

We descend in 20 min. to the cypress plain, whence the guides
conduct us in 'h hr. through two fertile hollows by a slightly
o1e3eendirrg path to a third valley, pieturesqueiy commanded by
rocks. The first dale contains the remains of a cistern anda chapel
dedicated to John the Baptism. From the valley in which this path
terminates, it is usual to make the ascent of the Rite syi.s-iiufi.sid
('mounrain of the willow'), which many authorities, particularly
since the time of Dr. Robinson, who is also followed by Prof.
Palmer, identify with the mountain where the commandments
were given. We may here enjoy a cool draught from a spring near
a dilapidated chapel dedicated to the ‘Saered girdle of the Virgin
Mary', and inspect the venerable willow which gives its name to
the mountain, and from which Moses is said to have ent his
mimeulous rod. The monks formerly pointed out another bush in
the monastery garden from which the rod was cut, The ascent of
the '?afs.if LGSJU ft.) is at Mst facilitated by steps. Farther up the
path becomes steeper, and the extreme summit can only be attained
by persons with steady heads by dint of scrambling. Those who
are not disposed for this undertaking should take their stand by

plain, situated about 50paees below the summit of the mountain.
