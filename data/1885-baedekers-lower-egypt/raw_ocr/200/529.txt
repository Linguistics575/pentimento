tlgs, is very muddy. After a ride of fully three hours we reach the
locks and the bridge Kami'lt'r llascm. The large body of water of
the canal, which is conducted from the Bath: Y1hsnf, here falls into
a channel, Which, with many rairsifieations, conveys it to the fields
of $enhm‘.

The large village of Feahitr (rail. station, see p. 463) lies on the
border of the second plateau of the province. Those who visit Ha-
wha p. 460) reach the first plateau, while the second is crossed on
the Way to '5enluir; the third lies at our feet when looking down an
the Birket eI-Kun‘m from the great Khn, i.e. the ruin-strewn hill
to the N. of the village. The handsome house of the Shékh e1-
Beled offers good accommodation, and even quarters for the night.
The traveller should make a bargain here for a boat with the shékh
of the tisl1ermen. About 30 fr. for the day, and a hakshish fur the
towers (of whom 6-8 are necessary for speed), are demanded.

veenlnt stands on the site of an aneient, and not unimportant,
town, of which large heaps of ruins still remain. {omen walls are
traceable in many places. A large building has recently heen E-
eavated by the peasants for the sake of obtaining the hard bricks
of which it is built, but part of it has already been removed. No
remains of columns or inscriptions have been met with.

From seam"- to the Hirket eHrurrin takes about Ir/e he. The route
leads through sugair-plaznatirrrw. We reach the hhe near the peninsula
known as el-Gezirell, on Which stands a heap of ruins. A Khort distance
to the W. are the scanty remnins of et-Hanwvim. The traveller, after
having ridden t0 the lake, shrmld not forget Ir! Order his horses, which
return to senlmr, to await him fur the return-jnurney at the spot where
he has quiUed them, or to order them to meet him in grind time on the
bank nc the lake by Nezleh (see p. MU).

The Birket eHrartm [‘lake of the horns') owes its name to
its shape, which resembles that of slightly bent oows' horns. It
measures 34 M. in length, and, at its broadest part, is about 61/21“,
wide. It is situated on the same level as the Mediterranean, and
its depth averages 13 ft. The greenish water is slightly brackish
(scarcely tlt for drinking), and abounds in fish, some of Which
are very palatable. The right of fishing is let by government, and
the whale of the fishermen dwelling on the banks of the lake are
in the service of the lessee, who receives one-halt' o? the catch.
The boats (merkeb) are very simply constructed, being without
deck or mast; the traveller must take up his quarters on the tloor-
Ing in the stern; none of the boats have sails, for, us the fisl, al-
ways go in the same direction as the wind, the tlshermen have to
row against the wind in order to catch them. Numerous pelieans,
wild duck, and other water-fowl, frequent the lake. The banks
are extremely sterile; on the N. side are barren hills of considerable
height. In the middle of the lake rises a mass of rock, resembling
a table, and serving as a landmark. Near the S. bank, from E. to
w., lie the villages ut' Kafr Tamtyeh, Tirsch, Fjenhtir, Abuksu, Be-
