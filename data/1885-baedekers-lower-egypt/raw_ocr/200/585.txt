to Sinai. JEBEL KATHERIN. 10. Route. 515

fatiguing until (11/2 hr.) we reach the ridge of rocks leading to the
top. The pilgrims have indicated the direction of the path by
heaping up small pyramids of stones on larger masses of rock. After
another hour of laborious climbing we reach the summit. The
Jebel Katherin has three peaks, the Jebel Katherin, the Jebel Eebir,
and the Jebel Abit Rumél, the tirst of Which, according to the most
recent and careful English measurements, is the highest (8337K),
being the leftiest mountain in the peninsula. The air is often
bitterly cold here, and snow lies in the rocky elefts till summer.
Half of the narrow plateau on the summit is oeeupied by a small
and rudely constructed chapel. The unevenness of the floor is
declared by the monks to be due to miraculous impression ot the
body of St. Catharine (p. 508), which was found here 300, or accord-
ing to others, 500 years after her execution, and to which attention
was attracted by the rays of light emanating from it. The view is
magaifioent in tine weather, but towards the S.W. it is intercepted
by the Jehel Umm Shomar. Towards the S. . lies the broad Widi
Natsb. The greater part of the Gulf of 'Algaha, the Arabian ir10url-
tains, and even sometimes the Ris Mohammad (to the S.) are
visible. The Gulf of Suez is surveyed as far as the African coast,
on which rises the conspicuous Jehel Ghirib (p. 474). On the W.
coast of the peninsula lies the sterile plain of El-ryWa, which
terminates near Ttu. To the N. tower Mt. Serbil and the Jehel
el-Benét, and farther distant lie the 1ig11t-eolrrureil sandy plain of
Er-llamleh and the long range of the Et-Tih hills.

The Weds Sehh'iyeh (afternoon excursion of 3 hrs.) is interesting from
its being regarded by Lehurde, Strauss, Tiseluu1dorf, Gran], and others,
as the cnmping-place of the Jews. We ascend the wee; Shu'eih (p. 500),
cross the moderate height of the Jam Jfertdya (-Muuhtein of the Con-
versatior1O, and enter the rocky dei Sebariy27t_ whichis tilled with heaps
of rocks and smell stones, whence the rocky Jebel lmse presents a similar
appearance to that of the has ee-sefeaf trout the Er-Raha plain. We may
now return hy the Wadi eshutad, a. valley farther to the N.E., from the
Widi Seha'iyeh into the Witdi esheshékh, and thence by a longer and
easier mute through the Wadi eerer. On teaching the W2di eshvShékh
(p. 520) we keep to the left until the entrance of the Shn'eib valley and
the monastery comes in sight.

The Jehel Umm Shomal‘ (‘muther of feunel‘, susft.) was long eun-
sidered the highest mountain in the peninsula, but it Was proved by the
measurements made by the English Expedition to be lower then the
Jebel Katheriu. We quit Mt. Sinai by the wee; tlebi'irireh, enter the
broad det‘ Runabeh, and pass the night at the deizzmn. Nextmorning
we iirst ascend the Jam ilbt1 Shefey' rising 1180 ft, above the valley.
The Wadi ffevayyeh, 0n the right, contains the scanty ruins of the old
monastery of Nap Antes. The majestic granite masses of the JebelUmm
Shomar, with its huge pinnacles, somewhat resemble Mt. Serbal.

From Suez to Fr, see y.474. Tttr is a place of some importance,
inhabited by Arabs, whose property, estimated at several hundred
thousand francs, is partly derived from the numerous shipwrecks
which take place near the island of Shadwz‘m. The harbour is all-
