Keg! Kurl'm is a tolerably “ell preserved temple, probably of
the Roman, or, at the earliest, of the Ptolemaie period. Before
reaching it we observe numerous traces of an ancient town,
which has now disappeared. The ground is strewn with blocks
of hem] stone, burnt bricks, broken pottery, anti fragments of
glass. A circular foundation wall indicates the site of an ancient
cistern, while other walls seem to have belonged to vineyards, The
walls of the temple consist of carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in thc oases, was
dedicated to the ram-heatletl Ammou-Khnum, as is proved by the
only two figures of this deity which still exist. They stand opposite
to each other at the highest part of the posterior wall of the upper
story of the open roof.

The temple is 20 ydrin width acx-nis the facade, and 29 yds. in length.
