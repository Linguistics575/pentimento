to Sinai. WSDI GHARANDEL 10. Route. 487

Even if we assume that the volume of water was more copious in the
time of the Exodus, owing to the more luxuriant vegetation, many
other circnmitances would still combine to render it improbable that
two million persons could have pertaken of it. The probability is that
these high figures are a mythical embellishment of the historical facts.
Schleiden has pointed out, that if the Israelites had numbered two
million as the Bible records, they would have furmed a sufficiently dense
population for the whole peninsula. Fnr such a gigantic caravan e mii-
lien gallons ofwater a day would hardly have suftieed, without allowing
for the cattle, and at the present Jay the Beduius begin to feel anxious,
when a party of a few hundreds encemps amand their springs. The
number 600,000 has probably originated from the paetiett] accounts of the
m 'tculons preservation of the people, who gratefully ascribed so great
miracles to theh- protecting God, in order the more effectually to extol
his power. These numbers should, doubtless, be very greatly reduced,
and so also should the forty years, which the Israelites are said to have
spent in the wilderness. it was obviously the purpose of their leaders
to inure the people to the privatious or the desert, in order to prepare
them for the battles they were about tu fight in Palestine. but the sacred
number forty, which is so often repeated, and which was used to signify
a generation, most probably indicates e term of years; we may also
observe that Moses wits forty years old when he fled, eighty when heled
the people into the wilderness, and one hundred and twenty when he
died. The fact that. the Arabian literature contains a number of writ-
ings celled 'Arbahuit', or tales in Which the number forty plays a
conspicuous part, allbr6s th tuoutirruistiou of the above view.

Immediately before us rises the curiously shaped Jebel Gha-
rumlel (Gerendel, Kharantiel, Gurundel), the name of which oc-
curs at an early period. Its slopes have been compared to 'petrified
cushions', It is possible that the widi which descends to the Gulf
of Suez gave its name of Charandra, used during the It0rna11pesiod,
to the N. part of the Arabian gulf, where Ptolemy II. founded the
town of Arsiuoii. In the Itinerary of Antonino the place is called
Gumndeta.

The Wadi Gharax'idel (reached in 2 hrs. from the spring in the
WÃ©di IIawira), which runs for a long distance to the tCE., affords,
near the sea, and particularly at thespot crossed by the Sinai route,
amoderate supply of slightly brackish, bat drinkable, water, espe-
cially after heavy rain, in consequence of which the desert here is
clothed with pleasing, though not luxuriant, vegetation. Among
the plants are several lofty and bushy palms, seyil trees (p. 480),
gharkad shrubs, and tamaxisks. Small groups of rocks on the
margin of the oasis enhance the comyarativc pitturesquenees of
the valley, which was perhaps once better watered and more richly
clothed with vegetation. Thus B. yon Breidenbaeh (15th cent.)Y
one of the Jirst travellers who identified Gharandel with Elim,
observed here a shrub bearing nuts, about the size ofhazci-nuts,
and known " Pharaoh nuts, but which is now extinct. If this is
the Elim of the Bible, the 12 springs and 70 paim-trees are
greatly reduced in number. The remains of two lterrr1it-0ells, hcwu
in the roeks, are not worth visiting. The Wadi Gharandei, owing
to its supply of water, is a favourite camping-plaee for the night.
