From Suez to Mount Sinai by Mnghira and Wtdi Flrén.

From Suez to (21/2 hrs.) 'Ain Mam, see p. 419.

Beyond rAin Mtisa the route traverses the W0di el-'lriia, and
afterwards an undulating region. On the hill-sides specimens of
isinglass-stone are frequently found. To the right stretches the
see, beyond which rise the spurs ofthe'Atilsa mountains (p. 415);
on the left are the heights of the Jebcl cr-RU/a, and, farther on,
those of the Ttls Chain (11. 5'24]. About 9 M, from 'Ain Ihisa
begins a monotonous tract, which extends for a distance of '20 M.

Wsidi Gharandei (p. 487), Which takes two days, is destitute of
variety, and is particularly fatiguing on the return-route, even in
tine weather. If, moreover, the Khamsiu (p. 69) begins to blow

Hammim Far'1trr (p. 4881, while another route to the left leads to

places with sharp hints, which are perhaps fragments ofnodules
burst by the heat, and resemble arrow-heads, knives, and other
implements (comp. p. 370).

We traverse the Wédi Werdén in 11/4 hour. Yellow hills of
Sand rise on the right, and the sea and the African coast continue
visible for some time. On the left the Wufa Ilills, which belong
to the Tih chain, approach the mute, and we obtain a ilne re-
trospect of the Jebc] '5udlir [see above). The sea disappears,
but is afterwards again visible. The hills assume more pictur-
esque forms. The 1ight-e0loured limestone hills, and the whitish
