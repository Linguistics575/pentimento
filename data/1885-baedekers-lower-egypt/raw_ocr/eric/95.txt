for sowing by the use of the plough. The seed is scattered over the
still soft and moist soil, and is then either pressed into it by means
of a wooden roller, beaten into it with pieces of wood, or trodden
in by oxen't. Throughout the whole country a period of four
months elapses between seed-time and the completion of the har-
, vest. The winter harvest is, therefore, over in Upper Egypt about the
middle of February, in Central Egypt about the middle of March,
and in the Delta towards the end of April. In Upper and Central
Egypt this is the most important harvest of the whole year. The
principal crop everywhere is wheat (occupying 50 0/0 of the ﬁelds
in Upper Egypt and 30 0/0 in the Delta), next to which are barley
(in the proportion of 10 0/0 and 1-1 0/0 in these regions respectively),
clover (100/0 and {2-1 0/0 respectively), and broad beans ['20 0/0 and
120/0 respectively).

(‘3) The Summer Crops (‘Es-Sé/i’ or ‘El-Ké‘di’) are much more
varied than those of winter, but they are comparatively unimportant
in Upper and Central Egypt, as the cultivable land in these regions
is very narrow, and belongs chieﬂy to the ‘ltai’ category, two-thirds
of it being under water during summer. In the Delta, on the other
hand, summer is the farmer’s most important season. The vege—
tation with which its whole surface is densely clothed in June and
July is marvellously rich and beautiful, thousands of magniﬁcent
trees clustered in groups aiTord delightful shelter from the ﬁerce
rays of the sun, and the eye ranges over an immense expanse teem—
ing with luxuriant crops. Another charm of the country in summer
consists in its abundantly stocked gardens and orchards: but of all
these attractions the traveller who, like a bird of passage, merely
seeks refuge in Egypt from the cold and rains of a northern winter
cannot possibly form any adequate idea. At this season every dis—

+ The AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS of the Egyptians are exceedingly
primitive and defective. The chief of these is the plough (Milo-tit), the
form of which is precisely the same as it was 5000 years ago; and the
traveller will recognise it on many of the monuments and in the system
of hieroglyphics. lt consists of a pole abmrt 6ft. long. drawn luy an ex.
buffalo. or other beast of burden, attached to it by means of a yoke.
while to the other end is fastened a piece of wood bent inwards at an
acute angle, and shod with a three-pronged piece of iron (limo). Con-
nected with the pole is the handle which is held by the fellah. These
rude and light ploughs penetrate but slightly into the ground. (On the
estates of lhethdive, Fowler's steam—plough is now frequently employed.)
The harruw is replaced in Egypt by a roller provided with iron spikes
(l'mnfud, literally ‘liodgeliog’). The only tool used by the natives on
their ﬁelds, or in making embankments of earth. is a kind of hue or shovel
(migi-nfeh). The process of reaping consists of cutting the grain with a
Sickle, or simply nprooiing it by hand. The n0mg, or ‘threshing-sledge‘,

. consists of a kind of sledge resting on a roller provided with sharp semi-
circular- pieces of iron, and drawn by oxen or buffaloes. This primitive
machine, being driven over- the wheat. peas, or lentils to be threshed,
crushes the stalks and ears and sets free the grain or seeds. The corn
is separated from the fragments of straw by the careful removal of the
latter, and by tossing it to and fro in a draughty place. The grain is
afterwards passed through a sieve.
