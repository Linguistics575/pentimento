  

e igious Festivals. CAIRO. 3. Route. 237

The great festival of the Mdmn EN-NEBI, the birthday of the prophet,
is celebrated at the beginning of Rabi‘ el-awwet. the third month. The
preparations for it begin on the second day of the month, and the most
important ceremonies take place on the evening of the eleventh. The
city, and particularly the scene of the festival, is then illuminated by
means of lamps hung on wooden stands made for the purpose. Proces-
sions of dervishes (p. 150) parade the streets with ﬂags by day, and with
lamps hoisted on poles by night. On this evening the sellers of sweet-
meats frequently exclaim — ‘A grain of salt for the eye of him who Will
not bless the prophet!” The Déseh, or ceremony of riding over the der—
vishes, also took place on the eleventh of this month. Some fifty der-
vishes or more lay close together on the ground, and allowed the shekh
of the Sa’diyeh dervishes on horseback to ride over them. Accidents
rarely happened, although the horse trod on every one of the pro-
strate ﬁgures. During this ceremony the spectators shouted incessantly,
"AllahJé-laJéJéhJihl” This barbarous custom was forbidden by the
Khedive Tewﬁk. and the ceremonies are conﬁned to the procession of the
shékh and the reading of the Koran in the Khedive‘s tent. At night
a great zikr is performed by the dervishes (p. 239). On this festival, as
on all the other ‘mﬁlids’, the jugglers, buﬂ'oons, and other ministers of
amusement, ply their calling with great success (comp p. 150).

In the fourth month, that of Rabif el~.—tl;hir (et-tdm‘), occurs the mom
liarly solemn festival of the birthday or 1161M of 51156;», the prophet‘s
grandson, the principal scene of which is the mosque of Hasanén, where
the head of {{usén is said to be interred. This festival lasts ﬁfteen days
and fourteen nights, the most important day being always a Tuesday
(yen; et-telzit). On this occasion the 'Ilwtiniyeh Dew-vistas (p.150) sometimes
go through their hideous performance of chewing and swallowing burning
charcoal and broken glass, and their Wild dances. On the chief days of
this festival, and on their eves, great crowds congregate in and around
the mosque, and especially by the tomb of Sultan es-$ﬁleh in the
bazaar of the Nahhasin (p. 256]. On these occasions the Koran is read
aloud to the people, the streets adjoining the mosque are illuminated,
the shops are kept open, and story-tellers, jugglers, and others of the
same class attract numerous patrons.

In the middle of Regeb, the seventh month, is the JIélid of Seiyideh
Zénab ("Clur Lady Zénab‘), the grand-daughter of the prophet. The fes-
tival, which lasts fourteen days, the most important being a Tuesday, is
celebrated at the mosque of the Seiyideh Zénab (p. 268), where she is said
to be buried.

0n the 27th of this month is the Lélel el~JIz“1-z?g, or night of the as.
cension of the prophet. the celebration of which takes place outside the
Bah e1-‘Adawi, in the N. suburb of Cairo.

0n the ﬁrst, or sometimes on the second, \\'ednesday of S/Ia'bttn, the
eighth month, the .llolid of 1mdm Sluife‘i is commemorated, the centre of
attraction being the burial-place of El—Karafeh (p. 327). This festival
is uumerously attended, as most of the Cairenes belong to the sect of
Imam Shafe'i (p.149). The ceremonies are the same as those at the
other mblids.

The month of Ramadan (p. 148), the ninth, is the mouth of fasting,
which begins as soon as a )luslim declares that he has seen the new
moon. The fast is strictly observed during the day, but the faithfnl in»
demnify themselves by eating. drinking, and smoking throughout the
greater part of the night. At dusk the streets begin to be thronged, the
story~tellers at the cafe's attract large audiences, and many devotees as-
semble at the mosques. The eve of the 27th of the month is considered
peculiarly holy. It is called the Lélet el~Kad;-, or might of value‘, owing
to the tradition that the Koran was sent down to Mohammed on this
night. During this sacred night the angels descend to mortals with bless-
ings, and the portals of heaven stand open, affording certain admission to
the prayers of the devout. On this night the traveller should visit. the
Hasanén mosque, or, especially if accompanied by ladies, that of Moham-
med “Ali (p. 263) in the citadel, in order to see the great zikrs of the
