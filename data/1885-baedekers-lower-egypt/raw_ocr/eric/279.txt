Street Scenes. CAIRO. 3. Route. 249

erant vendors of different kinds of sweetnieats, which to Europeans
look very uninviting. Thus, sultlub is a thin jelly made of wheat—
starch and sugar, the sellers of which shout,
‘(mltiweln yﬁ su/cka'r bz'mismrir yz‘z luilriweh!‘
(confection, 0 sugar, for a nail, 0 con—
feotiou I). These vendors, who resemble the
rag and bone collectors of European towns,
often barter their wares for nails or pieces
of old iron, as their call indicates. Lastly,
there are itinerant cooks, with portable kit—
chens, who sell small meat puddings, ﬁsh,
and other comestibles, and whose customers
eat their dinners sitting cross-legged by
the side of the street. This custom is no—
ticed by the old German geographer Se-
bastian Minister (d. 1559), who says that
‘the city of Cairo is said to be ﬁve times
as large as Paris. There are fewpeople, who,
as with us, buy food to prepare at home; but
when they are hungry they buy from the
cooks, of whom the city contains nearly thirty thousand”.

The way in which fruit and vegetables are cried is particularly
curious. The commonest expressions are perhaps the following:
‘Altﬁh yehmuwinheh yr? lé—
mi‘m’ (‘God will make them
light, 0 lemous’; i. e., he
will make light, or empty
the baskets containing the
lemons]; “asal yr‘t burtultﬁn,
’asal” Cheney, 0 oranges,
honey’; i.e., sweet as ho-
ney); ‘meded ya Embo‘tbeh
medcd! tirmis Embabeh
yughlib cl-lésl’ ‘yd maltlr’i
bunei cl—baltr’ (‘help! 0
Embabch, help! the lupins
of limbz‘tbeh are better than
almonds; Oh, how sweet is
the little son of the river 1”).
The best lupins are grown
at Embabeh, and they are
called ‘ehildren of the river”
from the fact that they re—
quire to be soaked in Nile water for a considerable time before
they are boiled. Other cries are ‘er nmselli”l-glzulbdn ya libb’
(‘0 comforter of those in distress, kernels”, i, e., of the melon);
or, more commonly, ‘cl—molnumnuf L‘roasted kernels”); ‘yz‘i fustulc
