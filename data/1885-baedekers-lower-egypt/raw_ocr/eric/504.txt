and a disk, on a lotus ﬂower, and attended on her right and left by
female genii with long wings. Each of the genii bears in her
hand the pen of the goddess of truth. The ruins of the temple are
now so confused that it is impossible to form even an approximate
idea of its original form. A number of blocks resembling mill-
stones show that the shafts of the columns were round. The
capitals were embellished with the Hathor mask. 0n the N. side
lies an unusually large capital, in granite, and upwards of 7ft. in
circumference. Numerous remains of pillars and architraves also
still exist. The steps which led to the roof of the temple, and pro—
bably resembled those at Dendera and Edfu, were also of granite.
A huge block is still to be seen herewith four steps attached to it.

The ruins of Mendes, '11 M. to the E. of Mansﬁra, whence they
may be visited in one day, have recently been excavated , and
it is not unlikely that they may afford a rich spoil to the learned
explorer.

opposite to Mansura- ferry in 5 1niu., l/gf r.) The trains leave Talkha
at 2.55 and 11 11.111. and reach Damietta at A 35 11.111. and 1.20 a. m. (fares

Talkha) to l)amiella,71i/2 M., in 31/3— 41/: hrs. (fares 54 or 36 pias.).

The train follows the left bank of the Damietta arm of the l\ile.
The land is carefully cultivated in the neighbourhood of Mansﬁra,
and we observe a number of steam engines which are used for the
irrigation of the soil. The train stops at (14 M.) Shirbtn, an
insigniﬁcant little town built of crude bricks. The next stations are
Rds cl-Khatig and Kafr el-L’attﬂth. The latter lies in a monoton-
ous, sandy plain, extending as far as Lake Burlus, and covered in
summer with crops of water-melons. An important melon market
is held here in July. The railw-ay station of Damietta lies on the
left bank of the arm of the hilt: (ferry in 5 111111.;1 fr.)

40 M. Damietta, Arabic Dunn/(it, situated between the Da-
mietta branch of the Nile and Lake Menzaleh about4 M. from the
sea, possesses a harbour, annually frequented by about 500 vessels
of an aggregate burden 0140,000 tons.

Seen from the railway station, situated near the harbour, Da—
mietta, which now has a population of 43,030 souls, presents an
imposing appearance, with its lofty houses flanking the river. The
interior of the town, however, by no means fulﬁls the traveller’s
expectations. On every side lie ruinous old buildings and walls;
many of the houses seem to be uninhabited; and new ediﬁces are
sought for in vain. There are few European residents here, the
insigniﬁcant trade of the place being chieﬂy in the hands of native
merchants (Arabs and Levantines). Small vessels only can enter
