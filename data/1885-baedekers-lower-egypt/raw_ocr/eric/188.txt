importance.

Immediately connected with the columns are the beams above
them. The inner apartments of the temples were eciled with stone
beams mclusively, extending from the abacus (or crowning slab)
of one column to that of another; and the rectangular spaces th us
formed were ﬁlled with slabs of stone, adorned sometimes with
astronomical designs. The chief characteristics of the outer p arts
of the beams are, that the architrave rests immediately on the aba-
cus, and that there. is a furrow hollowed out above it, forming
a deep shadow. The architrave is generally inscribed with hiero-
glyphics, so that its structural ofﬁce is rendered less apparent; but,
the concave moulding above it presents the appearance of a proper
crowning cornice (Fig. VIII, b), thus serving to counterbalance. the
