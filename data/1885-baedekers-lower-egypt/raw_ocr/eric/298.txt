The roof, with its open timber-work and octagonal recesses, con-
structed of the trunks of date-palms and overlaid with sycamore
wood, formerly rested on 158 rectangular pillars of brick, coated
with stucco. 'l'he friezes, bearing Cuﬁc inscriptions, are also of
sycamore wood.

The outer court 011 the W. side contains a Sakiyeh (P. 9] and
the singular Minarct (Pl. 8), with its external winding staircase,
the design of which is said to have been suggested to 11111111 by a
strip of paper wound round his ﬁnger, and which is the only one
of the kind except that of the Mabkhara of the Game Hakim

p.270). The minaret commands a good survey of the oldest build—
ings of Cairo, but, owing to its ruinous condition, the ascent is now
prohibited. (1 ee to the attendant 11110 shows the L111 an 1- 2 piastrcs).

Outside the entrance to the mosque we turn to the right, and
then to the right again. Passing the S. side of the mosque, where
we observe several handsome mushrebiyehs on the left side of the
street, and turning a little to the left, we traverse several lanes and
alloys, built on what was formerly the hill of Kal’at el—Kebsh
(p. 265), and reach the small, but once handsome —

Gami' Knit Bey LP]. 48) , which, like most of the buildings of
its period, long lay in a neglected condition, and was only lately
saved from complete ruin. This mosque was erected in the 15th
cent., and in plan resembles the Tomb of Kait Bey (p. 286)

lfaid or Kai! Bey (1168 96) was one of the last independent )Inmeluke
Sultans of Egypt. Both as a general and a diplomatist he successfully

maintained his pnsition against the Ports (Sultans lilohammed and Bajazid),
and even inﬂicted serious losses on the Turks but the refractory Mame—

lukes obstructed his undertakings, and in 1496 compelled him to abdicate
in favour of his son Mol1arnmerl,a boy of fourteen.

The door, with its bronze covering, is about 45 ft in height.
rl‘he mosque is about 26 yds. in length and ‘22 yds. in width. 'lhe
attics have almost entirely fallen in, but a graceful minaret still
exists. Opposite the lgibla is a gallery, serving as a dikkeh, which
is accessible from the staircase to the minaret. The principal
arches, which approach the horseshoe shape, though distinctly
pointed, are tastefully decorated. The mambar is richly embellished
with wood-carving. The mosaics 011 the pavement and the walls
are also worthy of notice. Bahshish, 1/2 piastre for each person.

In a small place on the Khalig, or canal traversing the city,
about 5J0yds to the N W. of the mosque of Kait lley, lies the Gami
es- Seiyideh Zénab (Pl. 7‘),- l‘ (x, 4), which was begun at the close
of last century, but not completed until after the Lrench invasion
[in the year of the llegira '1'216), and which has been recently en—
larged. The mosque, richly embellished with ancient columns, con-
tains the tomb of Z1111ab, (laughter oflmam ‘Ali, and granddaughter
of the l' rophet (her mulid, see p. 23?), consisting of a sarcophagus,
enclosed by a bronze railing, with a lofty dome above it (shown by
special permission only) — Outside the mosque, to the right of
the entrance, ls the sarcophagus of another Mohammedan saint.
