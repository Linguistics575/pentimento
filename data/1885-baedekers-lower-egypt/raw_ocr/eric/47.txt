TOBACCO. ‘27

While much caution and ﬁrmness are desirable in dealing with
the people, it need hardly be added that the traveller should avoid
being too exacting or suspicious. He should bear in mind that
many of the natives with whom he comes in contact are mere
children, whose waywardness should excite compassion rather than
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliucss
of disposition. He should, moreover, do his utmost to sustain the
well established reputation of the ‘kilmeh frengiyeh’, the ‘word of a
Frank’, in which Orientals are wont to place implicit conﬁdence.

Cigar-smokers will ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to become accustomed
to the Oriental tobacco, but they will ﬁnd tolerable cigar-shops at
Alexandria and Cairo, most of which have been established quite
recently. As a general rule smokers are recommended to carry with
them, both in going to and returning from Egypt, as little tobacco
as possible, especially if they travel by the overland route, as a
rigorous search is often made and a heavy duty exacted, both at
the Egyptian, and at the French, Austrian, and Italian frontiers.
Travellers returning to England direct, with their luggage booked
through, are allowed half-a-pound of tobacco or cigars free of Eng-
lish duty, or they may bring three pounds on Payment of the duty
(58. per 1b.] and a small ﬁne.

Tobacco (dulchdn) is kept in good condition by covering it with
a moist cloth, with which, however, it must not come in contact.
Strong (Mn-u”) or mild {bdrid} may be asked for according to taste.
Stambﬁli is a long and ﬁne cut tobacco, the best qualities of which
(40-60 fr. per oklga = 21bs. iii/2 oz.) come from Roumelia and Ana-
tolia, and the inferior from the Greek islands. The Syrian tobacco
(15-20 fr. per okka], which is out less regularly, and contains parts
of the stalk, is considered less drying to the palate than the Tur—
kish. It is of two kinds, the [cm-rim”, or light-brown, and the gebcli,
or dark-brown, a mixture of which may be used. The latter, which
derives its colour from being dried in the smoke of resinous woods,
is known in Europe as ‘Lalukia’, from the region of N. Syria where
it is chieﬂy grown [Ladikiyeh], but that name is not applied to it
in the East. The native Egyptian tobacco [dukhdn baledi, or althglur,
green tobacco] is of very inferior quality (about 15 piastres tariff
per olglya). The natives often gather the leaves from the Eeded
dry them in the sun, rub them to pieces, and smoke thf‘ Bovos
fresh. Tumbdlc, or Persian tobacco, is used in a Dlﬁier of Agys:
