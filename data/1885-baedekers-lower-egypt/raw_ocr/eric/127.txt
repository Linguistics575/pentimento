nominal supremacy, and thus claims a legal title to the of-
ﬁce of Khalif, the spiritual and temporal sovereign of all
the professors of El-lslém. ’r

The authority of the Osman sultans soon declined, and
with it that of their governors. The Egyptian pashas were
now obliged, before passing any new measure, to obtain the
consent of the Q4 Mameluke chs (or princes) who governed
the different provinces, and who merely paid tribute to the
pasha. The most distinguished of these beys was —

‘Ali Bey, originally a slave, who raised himself to the
dignity of an independent sultan of Egypt by taking ad-
vantage of the difﬁculties of the Turks , who Were involved
in war with Russia, He conquers Syria and Arabia, but on
his return to Egypt is imprisoned by order of his own
son-in—laW Abu Dabad, and dies a few days afterwards.
Abu Dabad obtains a ratiﬁcation of his authority from the
Turkish sultan. After his death, the boys —

Murﬁd and Ibrahim share the supremacy, and render them-
selves almost independent of Turkey.

The French Occupation.

Napoleon Bonaparte (pp. “MS, 429‘) arrives at Alexan-
dria, hoping to destroy the English trade in the Mediter-
ranean, and, by occupying Egypt, to neutralise the power
of England in India.

Defeat of the Turks at Abnhir.

Napoleon returns from Alexandria to France, leaving
General Kle’ber in Egypt.

Kle’ber defeats the Turks at Matariyeh (p. 333).

Kle’ber is assassinated at Cairo (p. 243).

The French are compelled by an English army to capitulate
in Cairo and Alexandria, and to evacuate Egypt.

+The Turkish Khalifs, however, have never been recognised by the

Shi' ites,

as not being descended from rAli. Most of the Sunnites also,

especially among the learned Arabs, regard them merely as temporal mun-

arch s.

Relying on an ancient tradition, they maintain that none but de-

can attain the ofﬁce of Imam, or spiritual superior. They accordinlrly re-
gard the great Sherif of Mecca as their true Imam.
