invariably ignore it. The fare for a short drive in the town, without
luggage, is on ordinary days 50 c.; to the steamboats, see above; to the
railway station, see p. 223. Per hour, during the day, 2 fr., but more on
holidays, when the demand is greater. After the ﬁrst hour each additional
half-hour only should he charged for. Drives beyond the fortifications

also It bargain should be made, is 20-25 fr.

Gommissionnaires (p. 13), who are useful when time is limited,
abound. They charge 5-7 tr. per day, but the fee should be ﬁxed before»

are always to be found at Cairo in winter. FOr the mere journey to
Cairo, and for the ascent of the Nile by steamer, no dragoman is no-
ccssary. On arriving at the Cairo station ([1. 28].) travellers are met by
the eommissionnaires of the principal hotels, so that the services of any
other attendant are unnecessary.
