The EzbeIcIyeh and the New Isma’iliyu Quarter.

The central point of the Isma’iliyu Quarter (p. 258), which is
intersected by broad and shadeless streets bearing French names,
is the —

Place Ezbekiyeh (1’1. C, 4, :3), or simply the Ezbckfyeh, which
is named after the heroic Emir Ezbek, the general of Sultan
Kait Rey [11). 968), who brought the general and son-in-law of lla-
jesidl. asa captive to Cairo. A mosque was erected here in honour
of his victory; and, though the building no longer exists, its name
still attaches to the site. This was once the focus of the Oriental
trafﬁc of Cairo, but the native industries have gradually to a great
extent been absorbed by EurOpeans. The principal hotels, several
of the consulates, numerous cafc's, palatial dwelling-houses, hand-
some shops, and the theatres are situated in this magniﬁcentpluce,
in the centre 01’ which are Pleasure Grounds, with the luxuriant
vegetation peculiar to the marvellous climate of Egypt. The gar-
dens afford a delightful promenade, especially in the afternoon,
and also present a very attractive appearance by gaslight. They
were laid out in 1870 by )I. Barillet (p. 70), formerly chief
gardener to the city of Paris. They are octagonal in shape, and
cover an area of gut/2 acres; the walks are altogether 11/2 Ill. in
length. The gardens contain a variety of rare and beautiful trees
and shrubs, and the open spaces are planted with the Lippia nadi—
ﬂom, to supply the place of grass, which does not thrive in this
dry climate. The grounds are open to the public in the forenoon,
but in the afternoon a charge of 10 paras silver (no change given)
is made for admission. An Egyptian band, which generally per-
forms European music, plays here daily from 5 to about 8 p.m.
Among the other attractions of the place are several cafes, a thea-
tre, where Italian comedies are performed in summer (p. 233], a
French restaurant, where a good supper is proeurable, and a pho-
tographer’s studio. An artiﬁcial hill with a belvcdcre commands
a llnc view, and below it is a pretty grotto. The garden was at ﬁrst
visited almost exclusively by Europeans, but it is gradually be-
coming the fashion for Arabs to send their veiled wives and their
children to promenade here, while the Europeans of the better
classes now treat it with unreasonable neglect. The trees, shrubs,
and ﬂowers thrive admirably, the greatest show ofblossom being
