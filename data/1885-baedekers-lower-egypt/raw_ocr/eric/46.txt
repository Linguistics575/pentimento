insult of the gravest kind. llaviner emptied his cup, the visitor
must not put it down on the ground, which is contrary to etiquette,
but keep it in his hand until it is taken from him by the servant,
after which he. salutes his best in the usual Oriental fashion by
placing his right hand i' on his breast and afterwards raising it to his
forehead, and pronouncing the word ‘ddimun' (1'. c. ‘l5ahweh

struck with the fact that the degraded rnfﬁanism so common in the
most civilised countries is unknown in Ecypt. The people of the
country, even the poorest aml the entirely uneducated, often possess
a native dignityy self—respect, and gracefulness of manner, of which
