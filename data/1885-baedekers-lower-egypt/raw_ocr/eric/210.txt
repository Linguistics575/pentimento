X. The Arabic Language.

Arabic belongs to the Semitic group of languages, and has no
relationship with the tongues of Europe. A knowledge of Hebrew,
however, will materially facilitate the learning of Arabic. The
gulch-n era of Arabic literature is coeyal with the introduction of
l‘II—lslaur, and the lgoran in the dialect of the linreish (the
family of Mohamured) is still regarded as an unrivalled model of
style and language. .\s El-lslarn spread from its narrow home over
the vast territories that gradually acknowledged the Crescent. Arabic
lo:t many ot'its older and fuller forms and was greatly simpliﬁed
for daily use. In this way arose the vulgar dialects of .\rabir, of
which that spoken in Egypt is one. in writing. however, an at—
tempt was made to retain the older forms, and the written lan-
guuuc of the present day, known as Middle Arabic. occupies a po-
>iiiml midway between the original classical tongue and the popular
t ialerts. Egypt was conquered by the Arabs in the 19th year of
the llegira (Git) A.D.’) and the Coptic language was replaced by
Arabic. The dialect of the latter rlm'eloped in the valley of the
Nile ditTt-rs considerably in the pronunciation of the consonants.

ucalisatiou, and accent from the ordinary Arabic dialects of Syria
add elsewhere. Thus the letter T is pronounced hard in Egypt and
ot't in .Syria [see p. 190'). The variations, however, are not so great
as to prevent the Syrians and Egyptians being mutually intelligible.

A sharply deﬁned and exact pronunciation of the consOnants is
characteristic of Arabic and is absolutely essential to any satisfac-
tory use of the language. The learner should endeavour at once to
master the pronunciation of the more difllcnlt Arabic consonants.
