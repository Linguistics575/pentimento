(17). Post: and Telegraph Ofﬁces.

The lim'r'rmx POSTAL SYSTEM is admirably organised in all the
principal towns, and now also in many smaller ones. The ofﬁcials,
who are very civil, are often Italians. The addresses ofletters des-
tined for Egypt should always be written very distinctly (particularly
the initial letters), and they had better he directed to the hotel at
which the traveller intends to stay, or to the consulate. Registered
letters are not delivered to the person whose address they bear
unless he gets a resident to testify to his identity. The forwarding
of letters up the Nile or elsewhere in the interior may be entrusted
to the landlord of the hotel. The General Post Ofﬁce for the whole
of Egypt is at Alexandria. Postage—stamps, hearing a sphinx and
a pyramid, are issued at 5, 10 and 20 paras, and at 1, ‘2, 21/2 and
5 tariiT piastres. There are letter-boxes in the streets and at the
hotels of the principal towns. Egypt is now a member ofthe Postal
Union, and the postage for letters within Egypt and to other coun-
tries in the union is 1 piastre tariff for every 50 grammes (1 1/2 02.],
and for book-packets 10 paras for the same weight. Post-cards cost
‘20 paras. Parcels not exceeding (51/2 lbs. in weight may be sent to
the countries of the union for 11 piastres tarifl'. Post-ofﬁce orders,
see p. 3

The EGYPTIAN TELEGRAPH SYSTEM, the various lines of which
are about 3750 English miles in length, extends northwards as far
as Palestine, and southwards along the Nile to Khartl‘nn, a town at
the confluence of the lllue and White Nile, whence a line diverges
to Kassala, and another by liordofan to Dar-Fin (comp. Map,
p. 30:). All the larger towns in thellelta have telegraph—ofﬁces,
and even the Fﬂyl‘ll‘n is included in the system. Telegrams to Ale-
xandria, Cairo, lsma'iliya, l‘ort Sa'id, and Suez may be sent in
English, French, or Italian, hut Arabic must be used for messages
to all the smaller stations. Within Egypt the Egyptian telegraph
must he used (5 piastres tariff per 10 words), but telegrams to
Europe should be sent hy the English wires, via Malta, and cor-
taiuly not by the Egyptian, via Constantinople, a provokingly di—
latory route. The following is the tariﬂ‘ of the English telegraph:
each word (not exceeding ten letters; if longer, it is reckoned as
two words) to Austria, 1* raut'e or (iermany "1°. bII., to London 1*.
