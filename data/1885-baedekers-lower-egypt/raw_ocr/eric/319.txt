pcndentives, is of a very elongated form, and differs considerably
from those of the neighbouring mausolea, being more similar to
those of the so-called Mameluke tombs (11. 3‘27).

Opposite the last-named tomb, to the ll. Heft), is the Tomb-
Mosque of Bursbey (Berisbai), completed in 1431.

Blurbey (1422- 38), who had for a time been the vicegercnt of a young
son of Tatar, ascended the throne on lst April, ”‘22 After having de-
feated some of his rebellious vassals, be determined to attack Cyprus,
one of the chief hotbeds of piracy. I11 the course of the third of his ex-
peditions he succeeded in capturing lnnus, King 111' Cyprus, whom he
carried in triumph to Cairo. (J11 paying a ransom of200UOUdenar11, and
promising to pay the sultan an annual tribute, he was sent back to Cyprus
as a vnssal of Egypt. Bursbey was, however, less Successful in his battles
with the ancoman Kara Yelek, who had allied himself with Timur, the
prince of the Mongols. A contemplated expedition against Egypt, which
was to have been commanded by b‘hah ltokh, a son of Timur, had to be
abandoned in couscqwnce of the breaking out of a pestilence throughout
the East. In order to prevent Kara Yelek from joining Shah Ilokh,
llurshey attacked him in N. Syrizi i111436, but u as compelled by his
refractory emirs to conclude a dishonourable peace, notwithstanding
which he shortly afterwards entered Cairo with all the pomp of a con-
queror. Shah llokh then demanded the ccssion to himself of the privilege
of sending to Mecca the materials for the covering of the Kal)’a, a right
which had belonged to the Sultans of Egyptsiuco the decline of the khalifate
of Ba"hd.1.(l, but Bursbey was successful in resisting this claim He also
defeated the Sherif of Mecca and thus became the protector of the holy
city, while the possession of Jedda, the seaport 0t Mecca (p. 1123), alfmded
him great commercial advantages. 'lhis was owing to the fact that Jedda
had recently become 11 favourite resort of the Indian spice-merchants who
had previously traded with 'Adeu, but had there been subjected to gross
extortion by the princes of Yemen. Burshey availed himself so thoroughly
of these advantages that he incurred the hostility of Venice, Catalonia,
and Arragon; but he succeeded in monopolising the trade in sunroof
the most important articles, so that the interests of private dealers were
seriously prejudiced. He died a natural death in 1138.

Various data regarding the building ofthe mosque and the leg-
acies bequeathed for its preservation were engraved on a long
marble frieze 011 the okella which adjoins the ediﬁce 011 the right,
and a considerable part of it is still to be seen in the place. The
Liwzin contains good mosaics. Some of the handsome perforated
stucco windows are still preserved, but the bronze gratings have
been removed, and the openings built up. Several severe conﬂicts
between the French troops and the )lamolukes are said to have
taken place around this mosque.

The admirably executed gateway with its pendentives, and the
wall enclosing the three monuments, were erected by Mohammed,
an intendant of the HOsh, about the year 114? of the IIcgira,

Adjoining the mosque is the Illa/bed er—Ififd'i, a mausoleum
with a remarkably depressed dome, next to which is the ’I'omb of
the Mother of Bursbey, a poorly executed work. The form of the
openings in the latter is worthy ofnotice, as the arches with straight
sides, placed below an acute angle, though not uncommon, seldom
occur quite alone. The oldest arches of the kind are to be found
in the ‘Amr and Azhar mosques.
