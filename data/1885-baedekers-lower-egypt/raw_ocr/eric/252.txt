covers the eastern and lower half of that valley, while the western half
consists of marshy ground with several islands, hearing ruins of ancient
buildings; (3) The chain of hills to the S. of the lake, about 5 SI, in
width. and consisting of fertile land, with the ruins of about forty an-
cient villages; (J) The Mareotic plain, stretching t1; the margin of the
desert. and also containing many ruins.

During the Arabian and Turkish regime the waters of the lake
gradually snlisided, but in 1901, during the siege of Alexandria, the
English cul through the neck of land between the lake and the sea near
the so-ealled Maison Carrée, a little to the \V. of Ahukir, thus laying an
extensive and fertile region under water and destroying about 150 vil-
lages. The present Es-Sett marks the spot where the fatal cutting was
made and afterwards closed, llohammcd rAli did all in his power to
repair the damage and to improve the environs of Alexandria, but about
00,000 acres of cultivable land are said still to he covered by the Sea-
water. The water is now evaporated for the sake of its sall , the right

We observe at intervals the sails of the barges on the Mahmfi-
diyeh Canal, and long strings of laden camels traversing the
embankments. 17 M. Kufr ed-Ide'r was the point at which
Arahi erected his strongest fortiﬁcations in 188?, after the English

reached in 11/4 111:), the capital of the province'of Behéreh, with
r25,000 inhah., was the ancient Egyptian Tenta—en-Hor (city of
Horns), and the Roman llermopotis Portal. The town lies on an
eminence, and contains sometolerablysubstantialbuildings. Among
them are several manul‘actories for the separation of the cotton
from the seeds, and above them tower several minarets. The
Arabian cemetery lies close to the railway. In July, 1798, llona-
parte, on his expedition to Cairo, selected the route via Damanln‘ir,
Which at the time was so excessively parched and burned up that
his officers and men suffered terribly, while he himself narrowly
escaped being taken prisoner. On letJnly, however. he succeeded
in defeating the troops of the Mamelnkes at the ‘ tattle of the P);—
ramids‘, and on the Qoth he entered Cairo. In Nov., 1802, the
Mamelnkes here indicted :1 signal defeat on the Turks. A large
market is held at llamanhfir on Sundays, and a smaller one on
Fridays. (From Dainanhﬁr to l-‘um el-Balzr and Rosetta, see p. .118.)
