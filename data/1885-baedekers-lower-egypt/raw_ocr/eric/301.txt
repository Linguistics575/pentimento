mushaf of Saffya. mother of Sultan Muhammed Khan, who caused fifty-
two copies to be Written by JIM/unwed ilm Ahmed tel-[1710111 el Tebi'izi.
It dates from 03.8 and measures it by 91/3 inches I11 it, as in one of the
other copies a black line alternates with a gilded one and the ﬁrst few
pages are very beautifully executed. A copy of Huse’n- Bey Khenmsluh'gi,
211/2 by 163/; inches, is written in a smaller character.

The library also boasts of many other valuable horans, chieﬂy written
in the Persian character. One of these. 171/2 by 12 inches presented by
an Indian hokmdar to the thdive, has a Persian commentary Written in red
between the lines of the text, and' 1s beautifully illuminated at the beginning
and at the end. Another copy. presented by a prince of Bukharn, contains
foui commentaries two in Arabic by Bédﬁwi and Gelalén and two in l‘er-
sian. Another gift of the same donor was the prayer- -book ‘Daldz‘l el-
li'hm'z'cit’, written on a golden ground. and furnished with a Persian trans-
lation. There is also a Koran about 9 inches only in length illuminated
with gilded ﬂowers and dating from the year 1109 of the Hegira. It was
written by Mohammed Huh Allah, and contains the thirty different parts
of the Koran on thirty pages. Each line begins with an alif, the ﬁrst
letter of the Arabic alphabet — a most laborious performance. Another
Koran. once the property of the Sultan Elga Elyusﬁ, measuring 201/1 by
It} inches, is written in two dilfe1enthaudur1t1nus the lar'rer being named
Thulnthi. and the smaller Neshi. The highest efforts of Arabian calligraphy
and illumination are also displayed in several Moghrcbin 3185.. and in a.
number of single leaves bearing texts from the Koran or savings of the
prophet.

The ancient )Iuslims bestowed the utmost care on these precious
copies of the Koran and their descendants still entertain profound
veneration for the sacred volume sent from heaven. The library possesses
many other ancient and valuable MSS. but they are all entirely eclipsed
by these )Iasahif. They possess, however, great interest for the Arabic
scholar, to whom they are willingly exhibited. and form the ﬁrst collec-
tion of the kind in the world. The library' 15 especially rich' in numerous
commentaries on the Koran and books containing traditions of the prophet,
as well as works on the law of the four Muslim sects, particularly the
Haneﬁtes and Shafe‘itcs. The library likewise contains a number of his-
torical, grammatical, and astrological works, some of which are very
ancient, not a few being in the handwriting of their authors. Among
the poetical MRS. the most important is that of Mutanebbi, dating from
553 of the Hegira, with a commentary by lbn Ginni, who also wrote a
commentary on the Ilamasa. A 111s. entitled ‘Poems of the \rabs. dates
from the same year. and among the M65. of the Hamasa is a Moghrebin or
Algerian work, written from the recitation of the best- informed persons‘,
and dating from 597. There is also an old MS. of the commentary of
llerzuki upon the collection of poems made by him. The ﬁne MS. of
Firdnsi, embellished with many coloured illustrations, was presented by
the Shah of Persia. The above enumeration will convey some idea ofthe
valuable contents of the library, of which at present there is only an Arabic
index, though a French catalogue is now in course of preparation. The
printed books are less numerous than the DISSq and they are chieﬂy from
the Bﬁlak press. Some of the surplus copies derived from that source
have been sold by the library.

After visiting the library the traveller may inspect the neigh-
bouring Dervish Monastery in the Habbaniyeh (PI. ’11 ; permission
must be procured from the minister of public worship). The mon—
astery was erected in 1174 of the Hegira by )Iustafa Agha, vizier
of Sultan Selim. The round sehil is the most interesting object
in the establishment. The building possesses a large court; raised
considerably above the street, and containing a few trees. Around
tl 16 court are the cells of the 1ler1isl1es, and adjoining it is a small

mosque. With regard to the dervishcs, see p. 100.
