Brown Booby (Sula ﬁber: Arab. shomel). several peculiar species of Gulls
and Sen Swallows (Luz-us leucoplthalmus. Lat-us gelastes, Lm'us Hempm'clzt’i,
Slerna media, Slew/ta Berg/ii. Stei'na albigena. Slel‘na infuscala, and Anons
slolidus). and the singular-looking Dramas (Arab. [Mini-6r). on the shores
of the Red Sea. The Flamingo (Pllmnlcaplerus {mlz'qum-um; Arab. bdslm
rash) haunts the Red Sea and the lagoons of the Delta throughout the
whole year, usually cougregating in enormous ﬂights, and breeds in the
F region to the E. of Lake Menzﬁleh.

1V. REPTILES. (If this class of animals there are but few species
peculiar to Egypt. The Salmnmzders and Bulracln'mls (Arab. glzlfcla’a) are
but scantily represented. There are about twenty species of Snakes (Arab.
tn'bdn), including the Horned Viper (Cemstes; Arab. mnlgrireneh) which
appears in the ancient inscriptions as a hieroglyphic. the Ecln‘s (Arab. gha-
m'beh or dashshdshu), the Cobra [la Capella, Hooded, or Speclacle Snake
(inde Haje; Arab. ads/(er), the Telescapus (Arab. abu Wig/mt], the Psam-
mopllz‘s (Arab. abzl rig/22w, the Ti'opz’tlonotus, the Pert'ops (Arab. ariaml. the
Zamenz's (Arab. gidrn-z'), and the Firm: (Arab. dassas). The horned viper,
the echis, and the hooded snake are highly venomous. and their bite is
often fatal; the other snakes are not venomous. but their bite is sometimes
dangerous. The Egyptian snake-charmers (l rah. lulwl). all of whom be-
long to a gipsy tribe (ghugar), usually exhibit, a number of cobras, the
teeth in which the venom is secreted having been extracted (comp. p. 8]).

To the order of thc Sum-inns belong the Crocodile (Cwonodllus vulgar-is;
Arab. limsdh), of which there are several varieties, and the l’lfmzitm-(l'a-
mnus n-L'lotz‘cus; Arab. wm'an), both of which have been already mentioned
(pp. 80. 81). Other species occurring in Egypt arc the Ableplmrus, the Gon-
l/J/lus, the. Plestt'odmz, the Etlprepex, the Scincus (Arab. mi‘mzlcm'J. the
Ilpli-iops, the Eremt‘ns and Acantllodnctylus (Arab. selelz‘ye/I]. the Psmnma-
moi-us grisens (Arab. wan-(m, a name also appl'ed to the monitor), the
Uromaslz'r spiny)“ (Arab. (lab). the Uromustim ru'iclis, the Slellt‘a vulgar-is
(Arab. lit/ratio), several kinds of Agrmm, the Chameleon (Arab. llm'bdglell),
and numerous Ascalaboles (Arab. «bu burs). To the Turtle Family belong
the Nile Turtle (Tricia/.1: new/pliant“ Arab. lz‘rstz) and a small Tortoise
(Tesluda marginal“; Arab. zelltrifeh). while in the lied Sea occur six
varieties of Clzelam'a (Arab. blsa or sat-Hr), several of which yield excellent
tortoise-shell (Arab. bagha).

V. FISH or THE NIL]: (by Dr. C. I}. Klunzinger). The tinny inhabi-
tants of the Nile are in keeping with the palms growing on its banks.
being of a tropical and African type. They are generally the same as
those found in the Senegal and other African rivers, while European
Species are very rare. There are in all about 7U-80 varieties. The fol-
lowing sketch is merely designed to afford an idea of the commonest
species, particularly of those brought to market. Many of them are re-
presented and described in the 'Dcscription de l‘Egypte‘ (p. 200).

The ﬁsh of the Nile are most abundant during the time of the in~
undation. when a number of varieties. not found at other seasons. are
brought down from the higher regions to Lower Egypt. At these seasons
the canals yield abundant spoil. especially after the subsidence of the
water. The flesh is generally soft, watery, and insipid. but the mode of
cooking it is perhaps partly in fault. The colours are wanting in var-
iety. white with a dark-coloured back predominating.

To the Pei-072 Family [scaly fish with serrated head—bones) belongs the
Keshr, and to the Car]; Family (scaly ﬁSh without teeth) belong the Lebls,
or Debs, and the Blunt, with a thorn in its dorsal ﬁn. The various kinds
of Sllm'idac are very abundant (ﬁsh without scales. with barbels, and
generally with an adipose ﬁn). Among,r these are the Shilbeh (a ﬁsh with
a high neck, a short dorsal {in near the head1 and without the adipose
ﬁn). which is of three kinds, the shilbeh ’m'abz’, the slzilbeh sheriffyelz, and
the rm‘lbeh wudnz‘ (the ﬁrst two with. the last without a spinous ray in
its dorsal ﬁn). The Shall, called kiu'kdr in Upper Egypt owing to the
sound which they emit. is easily recognised by the bony armour cover
in;r its head and its fringed barbels. The varieties are the 517th beledl,
the shdl senin or sheildn, and the shtil taanm'i or bag» soda. the last of
