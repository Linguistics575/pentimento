the Delta; pp. 373, 459.].

The throne of the Ramessides n as now usurped by ambitious
hierarehs of Tanis , headed by llerhm‘, the chief prophet of
Ammon; and Thebes was thusI deprived of her ancient pro—
eminence. ’l'his dynasty of priest-kings reigned ingloriously.
Being unable to exact obedience from their Asiatic vassals
by force, they endeavoured to maintain their suzerainty by
a conciliatory policy. (See also the relations of Solomon
with Egypt: 1 Kings iii. 1; ix. 15; x. 28.)

XXII. DYNASTY [Bubastites, from the Ilnbastis of the
Greeks, the Pibeseth of the Bible, the Pibast of the

XXV. DYNASTY (Ethiopians). Shabako (Gr. Subacon] con—

quered Upper Egypt, and resided at Thebes, but made no

of the Assyrian monuments; pp. 299, 303) formed an alliﬁ

ria, but was defeated in Egypt by Esarhaddon, the son and
successor of Sennacherib, and driven back to Ethiopia.
The Assyrians then plundered Thebes and divided the coun-
