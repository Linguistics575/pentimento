whirling and howling dervishes. of whom some thirty or forty take part
in the performances. The scene is of an exciting, but somewhat painful
character, particularly if any of the performers become ‘melbzts’, a con—
dition resembling that of epileptic convulsion (p. 15?).

The. month Ramadan is succeeded by that of Slmwmit, on the ﬁrst
three days of which is celebrated the ﬁrst and minor festival of rejoicing,
called by the Arabs Et-‘Jd es-ﬁughayyt'r (the lesser feast), but hotter
known by its Turkish name of Itch-11m. The object of the festival is to
give expression to the general rejoicing at the termination of the fast;
and. as at our Christmas, parents give presents to their children. and
masters to their servants at this festivc season. Friends embrace each
other on meeting, and visits of ceremony are exchanged. During this fes—
tival the Khedivc also receives his principal officials. ambassadors, and
other dignitaries.

At this season the traveller may also pay a visit to the cemetery by
thc Bah en«Nasr. or to one of the others. where numerous Cairenes assemble
to place palm branches or hasilicum (z-ihrin) on the graves of their deceased
relatives, and to distribute dates, broad, and other gifts among the poor.

A few days after the Beiram, the pieces of the Kisweh, or covering
manufactured at Constantinople, at the cost of the Sultan, for the Ka'ha
(the most sacred sanctuary in the interior of the temple at Mecca), whither
it is annually carried by the pilgrims, are conveyed in procession to
the citadel, where they are sewn together and lined. The ceremonies
which take place on this occasion are repeated on a grander scale towards
the end of the month of Shawwrtl (generally the 23rd). when there is a
gay procession of the escort which accompanies the pilgrimage caravan
to Mecca. and which takes chargc of the Mahmal (p. 236). On this oc-
casion every true believer in the prophet, if he possibly can, spends the
whole day in the streets. The women don their smartest attire. Many
of the harem windows are opened, and the veiled inmates gaze into the
streets. The chief scene of the ceremonies is the Ruméleh (Pl. F, 2). at
the fool of the citadel, where a sumptuous tent of red velvet and gold is
pitched for the reception of the dignitaries. The procession is headed
with soldiers. who are followed by camels adorned with gaily coloured
trappings, and hearing on their humps bunches of palm-branches with
oranges attached. Each section of the cavalcade is preceded by an
Arabian hand of music, the largest section being that which accompanies
the Takht Razcdlt, or litter of the Emir eI-ljagg, and the next in order
that of the Delft cl-llayy. or leader of the pilgrims, with his attendants.
Next follow variousIdetachments of pilgrims and dervishcs with banners.
and lastly the )lahmal [see above). A picturesque appearance is presented
by the camp of the assembled pilgrims (lilaggil at the liirket el-l'lagg
[1). 335). whence the caravan ﬁnally starts for Mecca.

On the 10th of DhuI—lgi‘ggeh, the twelfth month, hegins the great fes-
tival of Etv'lzl ct-Kvbt‘r, which resembles the lessor feast (cl-“id eta-sug-
hayyir) already mentioned. ()n this day, if on no other throughout the
year, every faithful Muslim cats a piece of meat in memory of the sacri»
tice of Abraham, and the poor are presented with meat for this purpose
hy the rich.

The Muslims also celebrate the Christian Easter ll'eelr, although in a
rlitl'erent manner. and of course for dili‘crent reasons from the Christians. On
Palm Sunday (glad el-khus) the women hind palm twigs round their heads
and ﬁngers. ()n the following day (Monday) it is customary to catfalrfts
(cucumbers) with cummin. On the Tuesday the diet of the faithful con-
si‘ts of a kind or cheese-broth with onions, and the day is therefore call-
Cd .ilﬁm et-mi‘sh wa‘I-basal (‘cheese~soup-and-onion-day‘). ll‘udnesdag is
called Iu'ba' 1511120, or ‘Joh‘s “'ednesday‘. On this day the g/Iltbez'a herb
is said to have addressed to Job the words — ‘\\'ash thyself with my
Juice. and thou shalt rerorer‘. He did so. and recovered, and to this
day the whole of the Egyptian Muslims wash themselves with gharglmra
