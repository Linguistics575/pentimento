ddle, which is placed upon the hump of the animal, consists of a kind of
vooden frame. from which two high round crutches project in front and
behind. Upon the frame is placed a leather cushion [which is rendered
more comfortable by the addition of rugs), and in front of the foremost
crutch there is a second cushion. The traveller sits with one leg round the
foremost crutch. somewhat in the way in which ladies ride, and rests
the heel of one foot against the instep of the other. The camel is urged
on by the rider‘s heel. or a switch. The camels generally march in a
long string, one behind the other. with deliberate but long steps, always
snatching at herbs by the wayside when they have an opportunity. Their
trotting and galloping paces are unpleasant. A camel can also carry two
Or more persons in a litter, and may also be made to carry the traveller‘s
luggage. Mounting is not easy at ﬁrst. “'hen the animal kneels
down, the rider grasps the two crutches, and places one knee on the
cushion; he then swings the other leg into the saddle over the hindmost
crutch. The camels have a trick of getting up while the rider is in the
act of mounting, but the drivers prevent this by putting their feet on
one of the animal‘s bent fore-legs. The ﬁrst movements are always
somewhat violent, and the novice must hold fast by the crutches; as the
camel always gets up with its hindleas tirst. the rider should at ﬁrst
lean back, and afterwards forward. The walking motion is very pleas-
ant. and those who are accustomed to it prefer a camel to a horse for a
long journey. The rider can read comfortably if he Wishes, and need not
hold the reins in his hand.

ARABIAN SADDLE-BAGS (Khurg) should be purchased for the journey,
as they are very convenient for carrying the requirements of the toilet,
books, tobacco. and other articles.

\Vith regard to harass, see pp. ll, L"). tlvercoats, cloaks, or bour-
nouses raba‘iych‘, see p. 10), and slippers. Siluillti not be forgotten. The
travaller should n1“: he provided with Srimxc Shoes. if he intends to
make mountain ascents. as the rocks of the Serlnftl and Jehel )lusa are
very sharp and angular.

Lastly a few hints with regard to HEALTH (p, 1.7); chemists, p. 231)
may be acceptable to the traveller. although the climate of the peninsula
is extremely healthy. especially if the traveller walk an hour or turn in
the mornings and evenings. A pair of blue or grey spectacles, with perhaps
a second pair in reserve, will he found to protect the eyes against the in-
ﬂammation which is apt to be caused by the glare of the sun, A supply
of zinc or other eyewash will often be useful. (‘astor oil [two table-
spoont‘uls) is a good remedy for diarrhoea. even when serious. Seidlitz
powders are a speciﬁc for indigestion. l'ills of quinine should be taken
in cases of fever [which frequently attacks the Betluins), and gly-
cerine is useful for softening the skin when cracked hy the heat. A
supply of lint, sticking—plaster, and linen bandages. may also sometimes
be useful. —- A cup of tea or cotl‘ee will be found refreshing atluncheon;
fuel for heating water [camel-dung. and dry plants) can always be obtained
by the Heduins. Good cocoa is also considered wholesome and nutritious,
and is easily prepared. A supply of Liebig‘s extract of meat should not,
be omitted.

At Cairo (or at Suez) the traveller should procure through his consul
a letter of introduction from the Monastery of the Sinaites at Cairo to
those of the Monastery of St. Catharine, where he will then receive every
attention. Those who intend to visit Ciigaba, shonld. if possible, be pro-
vided with an introduction to the commandant of the fortress there,
especially if they propose tu-proceed thence to Petra. — Enquiries should
also be made at Cairo Whether a journey to Petra is considered safe.
