admixture of negro blood imparts its unmistakable stalnp to the features
of the inhabitants. There are no Coptic settlers in the oases, but they
are sometimes temporarily met with there in the capacity of merchants
or government clerks; and Europeans are still more rarely encountered.
The population of the oases is comparatively small tKhz‘trgeh, according
to Schweinfurth, possessing 6310 souls; according to Ilohlt‘s, dehel
17,000, Farﬁtra 320, Bahriyeh about 6000. and Siwa 5600), and the narrow
limits of the cultivable soil prevems it from increasing; but. a more
auspicious era may now be in store for these isolated communities it‘
they follow the example set by the inhahitants of lh‘ikhel by sinking
fresh wells and thus extending their territory. As a rule, even in the
most favourably circumstanced oasis of lla‘tkhel, the physique of the
population is poor and stunted, owing partly to their almost exclusive
vegetable diet (of which l’rot‘. Virchow has found evidence in the condition
of the teeth of skulls from the ancient tnmlts ofDﬁkhelj, and partly to the
unhealthiness of the climate. which has been notorious from the remotest
antiquity. In the early Egyptian I‘ll‘rlud, and also during the domination
of the Roman emperors, the oases were generally used as places of
banishment, partly because their isolation rendered escape well nigh im-
possible, and partly perhaps because the climate was expected to aggra-
vate the misery of the exiles. The overplus of the water used for agri—
cultural purposes forms a series of marshes. ponds, and lakes on the sa-
line soil, and these last contribute greatly to the picturesqueuess of the
landscape in Sitva, which is farther enhanced by a number of isolated
rocky heights, but the exhalations- of these watery tracts in summer
are very unhealthy. “"ithin the last few centuries this evil has been
aggravated by neglect. and the artiﬁcial swamps required for the rice
cultivation are fraught with additional danger. Some measure [or utilis-
ing the superfluous water, or at least rendering it harmless, is perhaps
more urgently needed for the well-heing of the oases than an increase
of the water supply. Under present circumstances Europeans had better
abstain front visiting the oases from the beginning of April till the end
of November, but in the winter months they may visit them safely.
“'ith regard to the construction of the dwellings in the oases it may

low hovels of the Nile valley. we therefore ﬁnd in all the oases houses

times of stone, as at Bahriyeh) and palm logs. A curious feature ofthese

is the covered streets running under the upper stories of the houses,
and sometimes of such length as to be perfectly dark. AS, moreover,
like most Oriental streets. they are generally crooked, it is hardly
prudent for a stranger in venture into thcm without a guide. The main
street of the town of Siwa winds in this manner up the rocky eminence
on which the houses are built. and the place is indeed in this respect
one of the most curious in the East.
