“’ith regard to the Greek and Roman writers on Egypt, see
p. 3—14. The Arabian historians are mere chroniclers, who narrate
_a series of facts and traditions, and are entirely deﬁcient in method
and the faculty of criticism. The following are the most important
writers on the general history of Egypt: — Et—rllas'z‘uli (d. 956),
of Fostat; Ibn el—Athir Ld. 1933:], of Mossul in Syria; Ibn Kliuttlz‘m
[41. 1406), one of the 1110st learned of Arabian authors, a philo-
sophical historian, and chieﬂy famous for the preface to his history,
which was printed at Bulali, in four volumes, in 1868; Abutﬁdt‘t
(d. 1331), prince of llama in Syria. The following are authors of
important works on limited epochs of Egyptian history and of
valuable descriptive works: — I'll-Malaria id- [1142, at Cairo), the
author of a geographical, physical, historical, and political de-
scription of Egypt, and of Cairo in particular, printed at Bulalg in
1854; Abul—Mahﬁsin (d. 1469'), the author of a detailed history of
Egypt. from the Arabian conquest nearly down to the time of his
death; Es—Slyﬁti (d. 15067), of Siﬁt in Upper Egypt; El-dItmz‘tﬁ
(d. 1624]; Abu Sht‘mm (d. 1224), who wrote the history of Nﬁreddin
and Salaheddin; Buhﬁcrltlt‘n ((1. 123-1), who for many years was a
follower of Saladin; ‘Abdctlatif (d. 1232), a physician at Baghdad,
the author of a very important and interesting description of Egypt.
