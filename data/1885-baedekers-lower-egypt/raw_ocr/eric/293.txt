i‘Gami' Mohammed rAli (PI. 53), the ‘Alabaster hlosqne’, whose
lofty and graceful niinarets are so conspicuous from a distance as
to form one of the landmarks of Cairo. The building was be-
gun by Mohammed “Ali, the founder of the present Egyptian dy—
nasty, on the site of a palace which was blown up ill 1824; and
in 1857 it was partly
completed in its present
form by Sa‘id Pasha (p.
107). In plan it re-
sembles the Turkish
mosques built on the
model of the Hagia Soﬁa
at Constantinople. The
execution of the design
displays but little ar—
tistic taste, and the
treatment of the ma-
terial is somewhat un—
satisfactory. The ala-
baster used for the in—
crustation of the ma-
sonry consists partly of
blocks, and partly of
slabs, and was obtained
from the quarries near
Beni Snef, which were
known in ancient times,
but had long been dis—
used and forgotten. The
beautiful yellow tint
of the stone soon fades
when exposed to the " 3 p 1;,

The interior, consisting

of a large quadrangle, with domes resting on 4 huge pillars, pre-
sents an imposing appearance; and the ceiling is effectively painted.
The Kursi, Mambar, and liibla possess no particular attraction.
At the S.E. angle is the Tomb oflllolmmmed ‘Ali ((1. 18-19), en-
c105ed by a handsome railing [P]. (3), opposite to which is a space
set apart for the Sultan, also enclosed by a railing (Pl. 5).
