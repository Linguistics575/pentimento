II‘he oases always lie at a considerably lower level than the stony
plateau of the desert, which rises above them in picturesque rocky pre—
cipices, and the oasis of Siwa is about 78 it. below the sca~level. The
Hat surfaces of these depressions do not always form a single
cultivated area, but consist, even in the case of the smallest oases like
Farﬁfra, of a number of comparatively small parccls of cultivable soil,
separated by belts of sterile ground. One of the large oases, like that
of Khargch, when surveyed front the neighbouring heights, presents the
appearance of a large expanse of desert, decked with isolated spots of
light and dark green, the former being ﬁelds of corn and other crops.
and the latter palm-groves. These islands of vegetation, the extent of
which depends on the copiousness of the springs in their midst and the
amount of care used in the distribution of the water, have often since
the time of Strabo been not inaptly compared to the spots on a pan-
ther‘s skin, but the simile applies to the oases individually, and not to
those of the Libyan desert as a whole, as they are but few in number
and very far apart.

As already observed, these Libyan oases owe their fertility to the
copiousness of their water supply. lnexhaustible subterranean channels,
or an immense reservoir, perhaps common to all the oases, are believed
to connect them with the Nubian Nile, or possibly with the Sudan; and
of this supply it is probable that a very limited portion only comes to
the surface in the form of springs. ‘Vithin the last thirty years Hasau-
Eﬂ'endi, a well-digger from the valley of the Nile, and formerly servant
to a French engineer, has sunk about sixty new wells in thc oasis of
Uzikhel, some of which, though close to older wells. do not seem to di-
minish the cupiousness of the latter. With the aid of this additional
supply a large area of sterile soil has been brought under cultivation, and
it is therefore probable that by means of Artesian wells, such as those
sunk by the French in the Algerian eases, the extent of the cultivable soil
might still be. largely increased. The high temperature of the water,
both in the natural springs and in the wells, shows that it comes from
a great depth; and it is strongly impregnated with mineral ingredients,
as in the case of the bath-springs of Kasr Dakhc] and Babriych (07° FahrJ,
and the beautiful sun-spring (‘Ain I'lannuam) at Siwa (85°), the curative
properties of which, owing to their remote situation, are seldom utilised.
At Bahriyeh the stratum from which the water more immediately bursts
forth seems to lie at no great depth below the surface of the soil. The
thermal waters of Daikhel contain iron, and, like those of Farah-a and
Khargeh, are not unpleasant to drink when cooled; but the water of
Siwa is brackish and nauseous to the taste. The wells are generally
very deep [90-320 ft. and upwards), and in ancient times the inhabitants
of the oases, as we are informed by Olympiodorus, were celebrated for
their skill in sinking them. The invasion of the Arabs, however, was suc-
ceeded by several centuries of barbarism, during which the art of boring
wells was well nigh forgotten; many wells were ﬁlled up, and extensive
tracts of cultivated land, still traceable by the old divisions of the ﬁelds,
were abandoned; but, as above mentioned, the practice is beginning to be
revived. The considerable force with which the water comes up from
its profound reservoirs enables the inhabitants to construct wells or ar-
tiﬁcial dams on the highest parts of the oases. The ﬁelds are always
arranged in terraces of picturesque appearance, over which the fertilis-
ing element is conducted downwards in succession, so that the laborious
system of sibiyehs and shaddfs used in the valley ofthe Nile is dispensed
with. Among the southern oases, on the other hand, we frequently ob-
serve extensive water-conduits, carried by artiﬁcial cmbankments to long,'
distances for the purpose of conveying the precious liquid over ste-
rile salt ground to good soil, or necessitated by the requirements 1f the
curiously involved rights of property, These conduits not unt'rvquently
cross each other at diﬂ'erent levels. The springs are generally the pro-
perty of the communities, rarely that of wealthy individuals; and it is
in proportion to their number, and that of the date-palms, that the in-
habitants have to pay taxes, while the soil itself is nominally free.
