cognate tribes. This accounts for his obstinate resistance to the ap-
parently simple request of Moses. The story of the plagues, and the
destroying angel is well known. The historical foundation of the embel-
lished narrative is corroborated by Egyptian and Greek records, WhiCh

allow the foreigners (or ‘lepers‘, as they are called in“_Egyptian‘reports)
to quit the country.

The Exodus. Moses and his people doubtless started from Ramses;
but it is difﬁcult to follow the route taken by the emigrants during the ﬁrst
few days. Notwithstanding the ingenious theory ofBrngsch (see Note, p. 48”,
there seems little doubt that it was the Red Sea which the Israelites crossed,
when we consider that their route to the E. was obstructed by a line of
fortiﬁcations. Believing this, we at once succeed in identifying the stations
at which they halted, and in accounting for the apparently eccentric route
chosen by illoses. The following passage occurs in Numbers xxxiii. 5, et
seq.: — ‘And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in
Succoth, and they departed from Succoth and pitched in Etham, which is in
the edge of the wilderness. And they removed from Etham, and turned
again unto Pi-IIahit'at/I, which is before Baal erhoa: and they pitched be«
fore llligdol. And they departed from before I’i-llahiroth, and passed through
the midst of the seainto the wilderness‘.# Ramses [Maskhﬁta], on the fresh-
water canal between Tell cl<Kebir and the Lake of Tiinsfth. was their
rallying point; the Israelites assembled here from On (‘llcliopolis), Belbés,
Bubastis, and Pithoni, from the E. and 83., and joined those coming from
Tunis and the N. pastoral districts. The various detachments were here
united; their hearts were ﬁlled With joyous hopes of reaching the happy,
promised land, and, with their swords ready to resist opposition, if ne-
cessary, the Israelites thus departed from Egypt ‘armed‘, and with a.
‘high hand‘. On leaving tamses they took the road to Syria, and encamped
at Succoth, to the S. of the modern Lake Halal]. 0n the following day
they passed Etham (or Khetam, ‘the entrenchment‘), tie. the line of for—
tiﬁcations above mentioned. Ilere their march was arrested by towers,
meats, and troops of well-armed soldiers. Ilereupon the people, who
while under the yoke of their oppressors had little opportunity of learn—
ing to use their swords, lost courage and desired to return. Moses knew
the character of the multitude under his care, and was aware that they
were as yet unable to resist disciplined forces, and to defy death for
the sake of gaining their liberty, and now ‘(1od led them not‘, we are

Museum is preserved in papyrus letter upwards of 3000 years old, in which
an Egyptian writer describes his departure from the royal palace at
Ramses, observing that his object was to follow two fugitive servants.
The writer mentions that he started from Ramses on the 9th day of the
third summer month. that he arrived on the 10th at Segol in Succoth,
and on the 12th at Khetam, and that he there learned, that the fugitives
had taken the route in the direction of the wall (zie. Aubu-Gerrha-Shdr,
see p. 426), to the N. of Migdol. If Moses and the Israelites are substi—
tuted for the two fugitive servants, and the pursuing Pharaoh for the
writer, the route is precisely the same as that followed by the Hebrews
on their Exodus. As the writer arrived on the ﬁrst day at Segol, and on
the third arrived at Etham, and as the fugitives took the route thence
to lligdol and Auhu-Gerrha—Shﬁr, so also did the Israelites. On their
arrival there the Israelites were then on the bank of the Sirbom’c
Lake (see p. 1426, and the Map), a long sheet of water to the E. of Port
said. This lake was well known to the ancients, but has long since
been ﬁlled with sand, and has therefore fallen into oblivion. According
to ancient accounts the lake was in the form of a long strip, separated
from the Mediterranean by a narrow barrier only, and extending along
the coast. Diodorus informs us that the lake was entirely overgrown
with reeds and papyrus plants, and that it was very dangerous to tra-
vellers, particularly when a violent S. wind drove the sand of the desert
over its surface so as entirely to conceal the water, as the surface might
then easily be taken for land, and thus lure the ignorant to their de-
