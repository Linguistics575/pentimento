is composed of limestone. 111 a number ofhollows, to the right of the
colossal statue, we observe remains of foundations, the most im-
portant of which are 5 min. to the N.W., beyond the projecting
angle of the palm—grove, and due E. from the village of Nitrahineh.
N. Mariette supposed these to be the foundation of a temple of Ptah
(Vulcan). During the inundation the whole of the low ground is
under water, and then resembles a lake surrounded by palm-groves.

In 1951-54 llckekyan Bey, an Armenian, was employed by the Lon—
don Geological Society to make excavations here; and having sunk shafts
at 96 diﬂerent places, he found bones of domestic animals, fragments of
pottery and bricks, and various implements (eg. a. copper knife). at dif-
ferent depths. 'Near the colossal statue. beneath strata of Nile-mud,
which had not been covered with sand from the desert, was discovered
a fragment of red terracotta, at a depth of 39 it. It therefore appears,
that since the erection of the statue of hamses. about the middle of the
11th cent. B. C ithe deposit of Nile- mud around it has attained a thick-
ness of nearly to {t.. without reckoning a layer of sand Sin, in thickness.
The alluvial deposits at this spot must thus have increased at the rate
of 33/1in. in each century from the middle of the 111th cent. ILC. down to
the present time. If the thicknch of the deposit above the terracotta
fragment increased at the same rate, it would follow that the earthenware
vessels were manufactured on the banks of the Nile 11,646 years before
Christ. It need hardly be said. however, that this mode of computation
is very untrustworthy. And yet ‘who would venture to deny that this
tragrnent of pt 1tcr\, buried at a depth t1f39 tt.. may be at least li000 years
older than the monument of the great llamses‘? (I’escI/el.)

From Mitruhinch (Memphis) to Sahlcﬁm. [1) Spring ltoute.
We ride towards the \V. from the statue of Ramses, leaning the
village of )litrahmeh at a little distance to the right (see Maps,
pp. 37" ‘1, 37 8). 011 quitting the palm— grove we obtain an interest-
ing View; immediately to the 1igl1t, shaded by palm- trees and leb-
belts, is a small villa belonging to Tigran lley, a nephew of Nnbar
Pasha. About ’1 M. to the W. is another long palm—grove surround-
ing Sahkara and bordering the desert; beyond this , 011 the yellow
sand of the desert, rise eleven pyramids. The ﬁrst of tht-se, t0
the left, is the outer mud-pyramid , beyond which are the
blunted pyramid, the ﬁrst mud-pyramid, and the great pyramid,
all belonging to the group ofl)z1l1sl1f1r (p. 4'09). Not far from these
we next perceive the Mastaba Far'nn, with the pyramid ochpi I];
then, exactly above the houses of S:1hl_<z‘1ra,two pyramids, the lesser
Olelitil is that of l’epil. , and lastly, to the right, the pyramid of
Unas, the great step— pyramid and tnostnallm ones (to the1ight, that
of To ta). These last eight pyramids belong to the group of ﬁahltara.

l}:‘1ra,\1e leave the village which is uninteresting, to tl1t‘let't,
turn towards the. N., and shirt the palm-groves. (At the end of
these, on the left, is a beautiful, shady sycamore, close to a spring
of "nod water, and the tomb of a shtikh l We now reath the mar-
gin of the. desert the route still leading tonards the N. ,and ascend
to the plateau of the Neoropolis (p. 378).

having visited the statue ofRamses, we return to the t5111in.) end
