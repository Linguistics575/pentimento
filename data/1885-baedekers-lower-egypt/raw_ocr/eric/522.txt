left bank of the river, and sometimes of the opposite bank also.
The Nile with its lateen sails is frequently visible to the left, while
011 the right we obtain glimpses of the Pyramids, rich corn-ﬁelds,
canals, water wheels, palm—groves, and villages with tall dovecots
in rapid succession. The journey has already been described as
far as [14 M.) Bedmshén (see p. 372). We next observe 011 the
right the pyramids of Dahshi‘n‘ and the so—called false pyramid of
Mﬁdﬁm (see p. 467). AM Hagua‘m, Kaf'r ed—Dabai, Kn/‘r el-‘Aydt,
Kafr Amnr, and Gizeh are unimportant stations.

51 M. el-Wasta (post and telegraph ofﬁce) lies in the midst of
a large palm-grove, a few hundred yards to the left of the line, in
the direction of the Nile. Travellers coming from Cairo change
carriages here; stay of ‘20 min. in the forenoon, 17 min. in the
afternoon.

The branch-line to the Fayfnu runs towards the W., across
cultivated laud7 to the village of Abu Rt‘idi, beyond which it tra-
verses a desert tract for 35 min.7 and then crosses the low and
bleak Libyan chain of hills, reaching its highest point at a level of
190 ft. above the sea. YVe then descend, cross the Bohr cl- lVam'dn,
which ﬂows towards the Bahr Yﬁsuf from the N.. and then the water-
course ot‘ el-Bats (p. 460), and near the station of (19 M.) el-Adweh
(69 it), on the right, we again perceive cultivated land. On the
left is a cemetery with the dilapidated tombs of several shékhs.
Numerous palm-branches are placed by the tombstones as tokens of
affection. On the right stretches an ancient (lyke, which once may
have belonged to the embankment of Lake Mmris (p. 462). We
pass the station of cl-Masll‘tb, traverse rich arable land, and soon
reach (231/2 M.) ——

Medinet el-Fayum, the ‘town of the lake-district”, situated to
the S. of the site of Crocodilopolis-Arsinoé, the ancient capital of
the province (Hotel clu Fnyoﬁm, [03. daily; with a letter of intro—
duction from Cairo quarters may also be obtained at the American
mission—station 01‘ at the house of the Italian cure). It contains
about 40,000inl1ah.I and is a not unpleasing specimen of an Egyp-
tian town. Between the station and the town we observe a peculiar,
undershot sékiyeh, or water—wheel driven by the Water itself. The
very long covered bazaar contains nothing of special interest. The
traveller, even if unprovidcd with an introduction, should pay a
visit to the nind1r “ho will protect him from e\tortion in case of
any difﬁculty with the Owners of horses and others (comp. p. 34).

now s0n1ewl1at dilapidated, is the only interesting building of the
hind. It contains numerous antique columns, brought from the
ancient Arsinoii, some of which have shafts of polished marble with
Arabic inscriptions, and Corinthian and other capitals. Below the
