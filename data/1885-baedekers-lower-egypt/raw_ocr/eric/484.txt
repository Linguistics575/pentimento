426 Route 7. THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ. From Sues

far as Lake Timsah, as fossil conchylia, particularly varieties of the
Spoudylus, now occurring in the Red Sea, but not in the Mediter—
ranean, have been found there. The isthmus, however, is undoubt-
edly of very ancient formation, having been as broad at the time
of the journey of Herodotus (B. G. 454) as it is now. With regard
to the formation of the isthmus we may quote the following passage
from M. J. Schleiden: ~—

‘If we suppose a strait substituted for the isthmus, it is not difﬁcult
to foresee what would happen. The waves of the Red Sea entering it at
one and would soon choke it with sand, while the same result would be
caused on the Mediterranean side by the prevalent N. and N.\V. winds, the
Etesian winds of antiquity. About halfway between the seas these dif-
ferent agents would come into collision, and throw up a bar of sand, the
situation of which would naturally be a little to the N. of the central
point, as the action of the waves on the S. side would be more regular
than that of the wind on the N., and thus be generally able to penetrate
farther. This bar would gradually he raised by the action of the waves,
and that. at an accelerating rate in proportion as its growth would
present an obstacle to the motion of the water, until its level came to
he above the level of low tide. The surface would then become dry by
exposure to the air. and the loose sand, blown about by the winds,
would form sand-hills of the kind found on every sea~shore. In this
way the connection between the seas would at length be cut oil', and the
barrier of El-Gisr formed‘.

The Isthmus of Suez has, from a very early period, formed an
important highway between Asia and Africa. A considerable part
of its area was occupied with lakes and swamps, while the higher
points were fortiﬁed to prevent the passage of invaders. Near
Pelnsium, the ‘Key of Egypt’, at the E. extremity of the curve
formed by the coast of the Delta, to the S.E. of Port said,
were situated the passes by which the empire of the Pharaohs
was entered. The high road from Asia skirted the coast of the
Mediterranean, passing lthinocolura (the modern El—‘Arish, p. 478),
traversed the neck of land separating the Sirbouic Lake from the
Mediterranean, and led by )asium (see below), with the temple
of Jupiter Casius (the modern Ras el-Kasrﬁn '1'], and by the
town of Gcrrha 'H', to Pelusiuxn (p. 435), whence several roads di-

+ The agnomen of Casius is derived by Brugsch from the Semitic
Egyptian word Hazi or Jluzt'on, signifying the asylum, or land of the
asylum, a name which applies admirably to a shrine situated on the ex-
treme E. margin of the Egyptian frontier. He also identiﬁes the Baal-
zuphun of the Bible, which lay “beside Pi-hahiroth‘ (Exod. xiv. 9), with
this hill and the shrine of Zeus Casins. The word Ba'ulZephon occurs in
a papyrus in the British Museum in the form Bmtlt' Zeptma. and is the
Semitic equivalent (‘lord of the north’) of the Egyptian Amman. Pi-
hahiroth again literally means the ‘entrance to the reed and papyrus
swamps‘, by which was doubtless meant the Sirbonic Lake, so that Pi-
hahiroth itself probably lay at the W. end of the lake at the entrance
to the neck of land when approached from Egypt (p. 48d).

'H' Gem'ha [plnr. of the Greek gem-hon, a wall, 01' fortiﬁed place] is
identiﬁed by Brugsch with Anlm (a word. also signifying fortiﬁed place),
which is mentioned as early as the 19th Dynasty. This place W33 called
Shur [‘wall‘l by the llebrews (Gen. xvi. 7; xxv. 18; Exod. xv. 2‘2;
1 Sam. xv. '7; xxvii. 8). The town lay a little to the SJV. of I’i-hahi-
roth, which is mentioned above.
