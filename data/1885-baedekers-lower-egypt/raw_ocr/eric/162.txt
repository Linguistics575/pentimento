VII. Doctrines of El-Islam.

Manners and Customs of the Mohammedan.
(By Prof. 800m, of Tz'lbingen.)

Mohammed'l', as a religious teacher, took up a position hostile
to the ‘age of ignorance and folly’, as he called heathenism. The
revelation which he believed it was his mission to impart was,
as he declared, nothing new. His religion was of the most remote
antiquity, all men being supposed by him to be born Muslims,
though surrounding circumstances might subsequently cause them
to fall away from the true religion. Even in the Jewish and Chris-
tian scriptures (the Thorah, Psalms, and Gospels), he maintained,
there were passages referring to himself and Ill—Islam, but these
passages had been suppressed, altered, or misinterpreted. So far

disapproved of the rigour of their ethics, which were apt to
