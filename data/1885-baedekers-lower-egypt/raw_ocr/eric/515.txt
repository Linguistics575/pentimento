nome of Lower Egypt, and lay on the arm of the Nile named after it,
the modern Illu’izz Canal, with which many ancient legends are asso-
ciated. Thus it was by this arm of the river that the body of Typhon
(Seth), when slain by Osiris, ﬂoated down to the sea. On this account
the Tanitic arm uf the Nile is said lto have been an object of hatred to
the Egyptians, but it is more probable that their dislike was caused by
the fact that Seth, under the name of Ba'al. was worshipped on its banks
by the natives of the district. Among the other gods specially revered
here were Ammon of Thebes, with Khunsu and llIuth, Tum neb-On, or
lord of Ileliopolis, and Horus along with Isis and Soliar Osiris. The
favourite deities, however, Were Tum and Khunsn, the god of the moon,
who in one of his aspects was identiﬁed by the Greeks with their
Heracles. The Egyptian priests who performed the rites of the ‘gods of
Ramses“ in this town, are also called by the monuments Khar-tot, 0r
‘Warriors‘, a name which is identical with the Ilebrew name Khartnmmim
given in the Bible to the Egyptian magicians who attempted to imitate
the miracles wrought by Moses (Exodus v , ix .

‘Ve learn from the Bible (Numbers xi . 22) that Tanis was founded
seven years later than Ilcbron, which, however, is mentioned as having
been a very ancient place as early as the time of Abraham. This notice
of the place was perhaps copied into the sacred writ of the Israelites
from some earlier Plitenician work. At all events it is probable that it
was founded so far back as the prima‘val monarchy hy Phoenician mar-
iners, and that it then lay much nearer to the sea than at the present
day. The mud of the Nile has formed the broad piece of land which
separates the site of Tanis from Lake Menzalch. In the Scthroitic nome,
adjacent to Tanis, lay lleracleopolis (pp. 87, 412), the cradle of the kings
of the 9th and 10th lleracleopolite Dynasties. monarchs (If foreign origin,

aslics. Monuments were erected at Tauis by Amenemha and Usertesen
(p. 87), but a statue of the 13th Dynasty found here may have been
brought from elsewhere at a later period. When the Hyksos overrau
Egypt, they found at Tanis a population of a race kindred to their
qul. \Vhile Abaris (llauﬁr), on the E. frontier of the empire, formed
the basis of their military operations, they constituted Tanis their cap-
ital. Here they employed Egyptian artists, who executed sculptures for
them in the conventional style, faithfully pourtraying the features of their
conquerors ('1). 993). After the expulsion of the liyksos, Tanis was ne-
glected hy the Egyptian kings, but it was again specially favoured by
the great monarchs 0f the lﬂth Dynasty. Soil 1.. Ramses II., and Me-
reuptah. the Pharaoh of the Exodus, frequently held their courts here,
and even condescentled to participate in the rites of Seth peculiar to the
place. At the same time they embellished the city so liberally. and mm
muted its prosperity so effectually, that it is described by several papyri
as being a particularly beautiful and pleasant place, and the name is

ters. In the time of Isaiah and Ezekiel [8th and Gth cent. respectively)
20an must still have been a very important place. ‘Snrely the princes
of loan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is
become brutish‘ (Isaiah xix. 11). Before this period the city had sur-
rendered to the armies of the Assyrians, as we also learn from the cunei-
form inscriptions, which mention Tanis in the time of Sardanapalus as
Sanu, and its prince I‘u-tu-his-ti (Petubastesj. Under the 26th Dynasty,

started on their wanderings. The now bleak and sterile plain around
Zoan is called by the rnunnnicnts Salt/tot Zea/z, or plain of Zuau. It was
not till the lime of Ilauises 11., when a new town with temples and
shrines was erected adjacent to the ancient fortress of 7301- or Zorn (see
ahove), that the place was called l’i-Ramses t‘city of Ramses‘).
