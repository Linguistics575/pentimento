tents, accommodation in the monastery of AH. Sinai (and at the Hotel at
Suez if necessary), provisions (exclusive of spirits), the dragotnan‘s fee,
and all gratuities payahle to attendants, will amount to 40-60 fr. :1. day
for each person, according to the requirements of the party. and the
demand for camels. The expense is proportionally less for a large
party, but in this case, delays and differences of opinion are more likely
to occur.

The following CONTRACT will probably meet the requirements of most
travellers.

Contract. Mr. X. and his travelling companions on the one hand, and
the Dragoman Y. on the other, have mutually entered into the following
contract: -—

(1J The Dragoman Y. binds himself to conduct Mr. X. and his party
safely through Arabia l’utra'a to the Monastery of Sinai, and back. by
the following route . . . (naming the principal points), at a charge of
. . shillings per day. For the three days, during which the camels are
travelling from Cairo to Suez the Dragoman shall receive one-third only
of the stipulated daily charge. The Dragomau Y. undertakes to await at
Suez the arrival of the travellers, in perfect order for starting, on the
. . . day of the month of . . . The day of starting from Suez shall be
deemed the ﬁrst complete travelling day. For each day after the ﬁrst
twenty days, reckoned from the starting of the camels. and also for days
of rest, the right to appoint which is reserved to Mr. X., the daily charge
shall he reduced to . . . for each person.

(It is advisable to lay down the whole route very precisely, mention-
ing also the valleys which have to be traversed, but the stages must of
course depend on the situation of the Springs. “'0 may again mention
here that the Orientals, and the Beduius in particular, attach no value
whatever to their time, so that little or no compensation need be made
for delays.)

(2) The whole travelling expenses of the party, for the journey by land
and by water, camels, boats, etc.:, for food, for tents, or for accommo-
dation at hotels (to he chosen by lllr. X.) in case of any stay at Suez; for
lights, service, guides, balgshish to all perSons whatsoever, and parti-
cularly the fees for escorting the party paid to the lteduins whose terri-
tory is traversed, shall be defrayed exclusively by the Dragomau Y.. who
shall also hear all outlay for the stay in the Monastery, including the
usual contributions to the monks. Each traveller shall he entitled,
without extra charge, to 1/2-1 bottle of wine per day, but Mr. X. shall
provide any spirituous liquors required by the party. (Or the party may
prefer to purchase their own wine, as well as spirits, in which case the
Dragoman Y. shall he required to carry it free of expense. A few bottles
of good claret or Burgundy, and of Cognac, should also be taken by
each traveller to mix with the water, which is often unpalatable, or to
be used in case of illness.)

(3| The Uragoman Y. shall provide a good cook, and a sufﬁcient
number of servants, and shall take care that they are always polite and
obliging to Mr. X. and his party, and that they are quiet at night so as
not to prevent the travellers from sleeping, and he shall also maintain
order among the camel drivers, as well as the other attendants. The
Dragonian Y. also undertakes to he himself at all times obliging to Mr.
X. and his party (p. 13), and to comply with all their wishes so far as
possible.

(it is customary for the attendants to ask a bahshish for every
triﬂing service, but no attention should be paid to their demands. An-
other bad habit of theirs, to be carefully provided against, is that of tying
up their beasts too close to the tents, and of chattering beside them half
the night.)

(4) The Dragoman Y. shall provide . . . tents for 2-3 per3ous each [to
