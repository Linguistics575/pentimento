man is superﬂuous. At Suez, 1511111111121 and Port. Sa'id there are good

About 1”; M. to the S.E. of bhihin el- l_\'anatir is the ruined site of
Tell el-Yehndlyeh (Hill of the Jews). ”11 this spot Unia. tho high priest
of the Jews. son of Onia 11]., aided by Ptolemy l’hilonletor, erected a
temple for his countrymen who had been expelled from Palestine by the
Syrian party and hall met with a hospitable reception in l: Vypt. To the
objection that no true temple could exist anywhere but in Jerusalem he
answered in the words of Isaiah txix. 15. et 5:14.): — ‘In that day shall
tivo cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear
to the Lord of hosts, one shall be called the city of destruction (or. ac-
cording to others. city of delirerance‘). In that day shall there he an
altar to the Lord in the midst of the land ot Egypt, and 11 pillar at the
hordcr thereof to the Lord. Some critics have supposed that these and
the following verses “ere interpolated tor the purpose of justifying the
crc ction 111 11 temple on the bank of the Nile. At all events tlnia etl‘octcd
his purpose and erected the sacred edifice. The temple is said to lune
oc- 1ied the site of 11 ruined sanetuarv of Pasht tﬁ1kl1ctl, and recent
ex 'ations made here have led to the discor ery that 11 town stood on the

.pot as 1111'l\11s the time of 11111113113 ll. .and attained to great prosperity
