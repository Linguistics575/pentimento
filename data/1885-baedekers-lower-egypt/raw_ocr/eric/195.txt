identical. V0 attention whatever was paid to tastefulness in group—
ing or uniformity of arrangement, the separate scenes being merely
placed beside or over each other; but, individually, these are re-
markable for distinctuess and excellence of execution, and they
afford us a far more vivid picture of the life of the ancient Egypt-
ians, their customs, their wars, and their religious rites, than
any written chronicle could have aﬁ'orded. lu artistic ﬁnish, on the
other hand, these scenes are defective, and the colouring has no in-
dependent value7 being merely used to make the ﬁgures stand
out more distinctly, and imitating nature in the crudest possible
manner.

in the province of artistic conception we ﬁnd Egyptian im«

break; but in the practice of the handicrafts Egypt was perfect.
The goldsmiths and workers in metal in particular had attained the

Urzeus serpent, possessing the power of life and death, was

the emblem of kingly power. The sceptre, user, denoted author-
ity of various kinds, power, wealth, and Victorious strength. The
sceptre , which is read 125, t’am, or ouub, indicates the name of

the Thebau nomos; v, a basket, signiﬁes a master; W, a
decorated basket, a festival, or solemn assembly, at which oﬂ‘erings
