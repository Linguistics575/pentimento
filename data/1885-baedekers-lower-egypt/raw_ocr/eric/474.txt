frequently otl‘ered for sale to travellers as curiosities. The prices de-
manded are usually exorbitant, but may be reduced by bargaining.

The Nolhcr—of—l’earl Shells (sadnf) of the Red Sea form an important
article of commerce, but, owing to the undue extent to which the
ﬁshery has recently been carried, the yield has greatly fallen oil“. The
Beduins of the coast, who train slaves as divers, carry on the ﬁshery
during the summer. The price of the shells averages 12—15 piastres tariﬂ'
per okka (21/2 lbs], varying according to the size. The largest ofthe shells
are rarely more than two pounds in weight, and the ﬁnest are apt to be per-
forated by worms, in which case they are valueless. The principal mart
on the Red Sea for mother-of-pearl and pearls is chda (p. 1123], the
seaport of Mecca. Pearls may sometimes be purchased direct from the
Deduins or their slaves, but they ask more than the pearls are worth in
Europe, 4-5 fr. being often demanded for one of small size. The small
discoloured pearls, though valueless, are also frequently oﬂ'ered for sale.
The Arabs grind them down, and prepare an eye-salve from the powder.

Another common bivalve is the busr(Tr-idacna gigas), a huge kind of
clam-shell. The indigostihle ﬂesh, called ‘wrumbdlc‘, is dried and sold
in the markets as an article of food. This shell also yields pearls, but
they are dull and worthless.

Among the univalves the most important is the 13121:, a kind of whelk,
which the ladwi, or conjurer at fairs, uses as a horn. Large and unstained
specimens are rare, costing 2-4 fr. each. Other large varieties of the
same species are of less value. A very common shell-ﬁsh is the large
gemel or ubﬂ szlb'da (I’teroceras lumbis), which has six long ﬁnger-
like projections; its flesh is also dried and sold as sm'zlmbctlc (see
above). The divers frequently bring up specimens of the large mallza
(Uassis cm'nuta), which is of a stone—grey colour externally, and covered
with a thick yellow substance at the mouth, in which cameos may be
cut. The mum, or eowry, or ‘porcelain shell‘ as it is sometimes called
(Hg/pram), and the morsd’a, or cone—shell (Callus), are very abundant. and
rarely worth more than a few paras each. A small white cowry is used
in the ‘troll-madam‘ game. A small lilack-and-yellow striped cowry
((‘olmnbella mendicaria), known as the sile‘m, is sometimes exported to
the deiin, where it is used instead of small coin. The glossy mosm‘a
(New-Na polita), which is often found on the sea-shore, is sometimes used
for the same purpose. One of the prettiest shells of the Red Sea is the
abundant small pink warddn or silesﬁfu (Monodouta I’lzamom's) with its
black and white knobs. Among Other shells frequently otl'ered for sale
are the Mares. with its long spines, the gibrz‘a (Olive), the long conical
mirzmd, or screw shell (Terebra), the large and thin Dolium, and the small
Haliolis, or ear-shell. The nehé‘d, or top shell (Twas/ms), and the sat-“a
(Turbo) are sometimes polished with muriatie acid so as to resemble
mother—of-pearl, and are used for ornamental purposes. Black coral, or
yusr, which realises a high price, is used for the manufacture of rosa-
ries, pipe mouthpieces, and ornaments. The purple dem el akhwdn, or
organ coral, is sometimes used as a dye, and the blocks of the porous
coral (Portles) for building purposes. Other kinds of coral, 0r stony
zoophytes, known as slm'ab, bleached perfectly white, are frequently
seen in the shops. They sometimes resemble roses, trecs, leaves, and
bulbous growths. The traveller should, if possible, make a. point of seeing
the “*Suoaoohous Coma. FORMATIUNS, which resemble a scene from
iairyland. A boat is taken in calm weather as far as the slope of the
coral reef of Sha‘ab which skirts the shore. The coral in the immediate
vicinity of Suez is not so ﬁne as some of the formations a little farther
oﬂ‘. Those who are interested in marine zoology should walk along the
clitl's at low tide, when they will ﬁnd thousands of curious shell-ﬁsh and
zoophytes in the pools, under the stones, and on the beach. They may
also amuse themselves by gathering edible mussels, limpets, and sea-
urchins, and watch the eccentric movements of the crabs. A visit to the
FISH-NARKET is also recommended, where the curious and brightly
coloured members of the tinny tribe are seen to far better advantage than
in a museum. The singular looking balHlsh (p. 84) is often stutl‘ed and
