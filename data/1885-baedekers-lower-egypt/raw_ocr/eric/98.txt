probably also the small quantity employed in the construction of
their temples. The best proof of the scarcity of good timber in
Egypt is afforded by the fact that sycamore-wood, one of the
worst possible kinds owing to the knottiness and irregularity of
its grain, has been laboriously manufactured into cofﬁns and
statues. )lohammed 'Ali, a great patron of horticulture, at one
time oﬂ'ered prizes for the planting of trees, but his efforts were
unattended with success, as the climatic and other difﬁculties at- l
tending the task were then but imperfectly understood in Egypt.

“is successors were sworn enemies to trees of every kind, and they

were content that their palaces should be exposed to the full glare

of the sun. The lihedive Ism a’il, however, at length revived the plans

of his celebrated ancestor, and by the engagement of )l. Barillet

[1869), superintendent of the gardens of Paris, one of the most

skilful lamlseape-gardeners of the day, introduced an entirely new

feature into Egyptian scenery. 'l‘his enterprising and able man un—

fortunately died (‘lb‘T—l) before all his plans had been earried out,

but the eye of everyuew-eomer will rest with pleasure on the. parks

and gardens for which Egypt is indebted to him. While, for example,

the traveller had formerly to ride all the. way to the l‘yramids over

sterile soil. exposed to the scorching rays of the sun, he now drives

comfortably thither in a carriage on a well-shaded road. .\I. liarillet's

most important works are the Ezbekiyeh Garden at Cairo, the ex- '
tensi\ e pleasure—grounds at (iczireh, and the plantation oftrees which
shades the roads on the left batik of the Nile, opposite the city.
Jlnndreds of thousands of trees were planted within a few years,
and their annually increasing shade has converted many of the
dusty and stilling roads in and around Cairo into pleasant promo-
nades. The ﬁnest of all these trees, both On account ofits um-
brageousness and the excellence ofits wood, and one which thriyes
admirably, is the [colic]: [Albixzia llebbek), which has long been
erroneously called by travellers the acacia of the Nile (the latter
being properly the sun! tree). Within forty years the lebbek attains
a height of 80 ft. and a great thickness, while the branches pro-
ject to a long,r distance over the roads, densely e0vering them with a
dense leafy ranopy within a remarkably short time. Thus, an avenue
planted in ltiGU near the (iennan Protestant church already forms
a complete arcade over the road. Another very valuable and interest—
ing property of the tree is, tliatonttings consisting of branches more
than a foot thit-k, and even portions of the trunk, pill strike root
and thrive, while in the ease of most other trees the cuttings must
consist of mere twigs. In the oourse of a single summer the. shady
avenues leading to the Pyramids were thus formed. About two
hundred dill'ereut kinds of trees, chielly of ii. Jndiau origin, are now
planted in the parks of the Ithedive (about twenty in number), and
they are constantly multiplied in nurseries laid out for the purpose.
Among the most important of these are the magniﬁcent ‘Flamboyer
