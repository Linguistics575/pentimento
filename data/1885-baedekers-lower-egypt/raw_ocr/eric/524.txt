monument was erected by Usurtesen I.‘, who also founded the obelisk
of ttclinpolis (p. 333), and belonged to the same family (12th Dyn.) as
Amcnemha 111., the founder of the Labyrinth. — A visit to B‘ihamu
and Ebgig is chieﬂy interesting to archaeologists, and perhaps to bota-
nists also.

EXCI‘RSIONS. A whole day is required for a visit to the Pyramid
of Hun-{halt and the Labyrinth (horse 10, donkey 5 fr.) The route
leads at ﬁrst for 3/4 hr. along the bank of the Baht Yusuf. The ﬁrst
village of any importance is Ului/‘ch. Our path traverses well cul-
tivatcd land with numerous water-wheels. The corn and cotton
ﬁelds are shaded by numerous sycamores, lebbeks, palms, and
other trees. About 1/2 hr. from Uhafeh, and beyond two smaller
villages, we reach a bridge of ancient brick masonry. Traversing
the slightly undulating tract a little farther, we. reach the Ruhr

ichMd [‘i'iver without water], also called est—Bats, a deep chall-
ncl, extending in a wide curve, and terminating near the NE. end
of the liirket el-lgurﬁ11(p.465). In winter the water, which trick—
les down from its lofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the
bottom of the channel grow reeds and tamarisks. The S. bank
rises at places nearly perpendicularly to a height of 26 ft., so that
the sequence of the strata of the soil is distinctly observable. We
now ascend the plateau (the highest in the province, 88 ft. above
the sea level) on which lies Hawﬁret el-Kasab or Hawdret el—
Mulrta, a considerable village, with a mosque (reached in 13/4 hr.
from Mediuet el—l’ayi‘im). The traveller may apply to the Shékh-el-
leled [prefect of the village] for a guide to the pyramid ofllawiua.
1f the water is high, and the canals have to be avoided, we have
to make a circuit of nearly ‘2, hrs. to the Labyrinth, but by riding
hrough the water, where necessary, it may be reached in 3/4 hour.

The longer route is preferable, as it passes several relics of
antiquity. A little beyond the village rises the bridge of Ifamifir
cl-Agani, the ten buttresses of which rest on a foundation of mas-
sive stone. We continue to ride along an ancient embankment, and
thus reach the Kutasunta structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully jointed steps of large and well—hewn blocks, but bears
no inscription whatever. “'0 cross the Bahr el-li'unldn, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of llawarah, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Bohr el-Mclclth or Ruhr esh-Qherlsi,
i.e. river of the East. 011 the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
which, according to Ttepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (see be-
low). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to ascend at once the Pyramid of Ha.-
wara. This consists of unbnrut bricks of Nile mud mixed with straw
('nomp. p. 370‘), and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area
01' upwards ei‘ 116 sq. yards. It has been ascertained that the nu—
cleus ol' the structure is a natural mass ol'rock, 39 ft. in height. The
dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a ﬂight of
well-worn steps. The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side, was
