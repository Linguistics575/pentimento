overgrown with reeds and marsh-plants. The distance to be tra-
versed depends 011 the state of the water, and the route varies at
different seasons. The villages resemble those 011 the Upper Nile,
except that there are no large dovecots here. About noon we reach
the margin of the desert, 011 the parched and cracked surface of
which there are occasional pools of salt water. Towards sunset we
regain the cultivated land, and, after a good deal of waiting and
shouting, are ferried across the Mu’izz Canal. \Ve then either pitch
our tent among the ruins of the ancient Tanis, or ask hospitality
of Ahmed, the wealthy farmer of the ﬁshings. His son Mustafa
will be found obliging. Insect—powder should not be forgotten.

Sun ls a ﬁshing village (p 431)], where an amusing ﬁsh- auction
takes place every l‘uesday and l riday at the house of Ahmed. The
faces and ﬁgures of the inhabitants are peculiar. They are doubtless
the descendants of the wild and rebellious Bashmurites and Bia-
mites who gave so much trouble to the troops of the khalifs Mer-
wan 11. [744- -50) and Mamnn L813- -33), and also of the Semitic
shepherds 11110 inhabited the )Ienzaleh region at a very remote pe-
riod. They \\ ere called Amu, or7 11 ith the article, Pi—Amn, by the
Egyptians, and the name was afterwards corrupted to liiamites.
They were also known as l’i-Shemer, which was corrupted to
Bashmurites. In the Christian period they belonged to the orthodox
church, and styled themselves Melekites, or ‘royalists’, a name
which they still apply to themselves in the form ‘Malakiyin’,
although they have long since embraced El-Islz‘im. The hope of
bakshish makes them civil to travellers.
