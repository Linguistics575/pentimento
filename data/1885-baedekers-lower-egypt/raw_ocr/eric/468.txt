exceedingly‘. In a later passage the sacred record mentions the cities in
Goshen in which the Ismelites were compelled to work at the tasks im-
posed on them by Pharaoh. Exodus i. 11: —— ‘Therefore they did set
over them taskmasters to afﬂict them with their burdens. And they
built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and llaamses‘. Lastly, the ﬁrst
umnpingplaces of the retreating lsraelites are enumerated in Numbers
xxxiii. 5. et .seq.: — (l) Ramses, [2) Succoth, (3) Etham, and (4) Pi-ha-
hiroth, ‘which is before Baalizephon: and they pitched before Migdol‘.
Leaving Pi-hahiroth, they then ‘passed through the midst of the sea into
the wilderness‘.

\Ve thus ﬁnd that the Bible mentions a considerable number of pla<
ces belonging to Goshen, and as the sites of several of these have been
identiﬁed with the aid of the Egyptian monuments. we are enabled ap-
proximately to determine the boundaries of the district, within which
also lay Tell eliYehﬁdiyeh (p. [108), Bele’s l'p. 409), and Bubastis (p. 410).
That Goshen lay to the E. of the Delta there can be no doubt, as it was
situated between the residence of the Pharaohs and Palestine, and the
Scriptures make no mention of the Nile having been crossed. This pro»
Vince was afterwards called the Nomos Arabia, or Arabian nome, and
the ancient Egyptian Gosem is spoken of as one of the E. districts of
the empire. The name still survives in that of the town called Km by
the Copts, and Fall-{ts by the Arabs (the ancient I’lmcnsa; comp. p'. 451).

The southernmost point of the triangle formed by the land of Goshen
was probably lieliopolis (Matariyeh), whence the district seems to have
extended in a narrow strip as far as Belbés. The S. boundary ran thence,
in the latitude of the present FrcslrW'ater Canal, as far as Lake Tim~
say. (In the \V. the district was probably bounded by the Tanitic arm
of the Nile, on the N. by Lake Blenzaleh, and on the E. by a branch of
the same, as well as by the Balah and Timsﬁh lakes, which in an-
cient times were connected by aline of fortiﬁcations, and formed a kind
of moat behind the bastions erected for the purpose of warding oil the
attacks of the warlike tribes of \V. Arabia. To the S. of the district of
Goshen extended a desert tract intersected by ranges of hills, ramifying
from the hills which bound the Arabian bank of the Nile. These hills
generally run from \V. to E., and attain their greatest height in the
‘Atdlga Jlts., which command the N.\V. shore of the Gulf of Suez. It is
probable that the Jews, who settled in Goshen as shepherds, and after-
wards appear as inhabitants of the towns in that region, were compelled
to assist in the cultivation of the soil, which seems to have attained a
high state of perfection at that period. Several records written on pa-
pyrus by Egyptian ofﬁcials about that epoch are still preserved. They
describe the charms of the country in the most vivid colours, stating
that life there was ‘sweet‘, and that the soil yielded all kinds of crops
in abundance. In a papyrus preserved at Leyden the writer, Keniamen,
Writes the following report to his superior Ilui, an important ofﬁcial
under the Pharaoh of the oppression [Ramses 11.): -—- ‘Thereforc I heard
the message of the eye (an ofﬁcial title) of my master, saying: Hive corn
to the Egyptian soldiers, and to the Hebrews who polish stones for the
construction of the great store-houses (hekhcnnu) in the city of ltamses‘,
cte. —— The Israelites were doubtless also employed in the construction
of the new canals which converted the sterile land into a smilingr agri-
cultural tract, affording abundant subsistence both to man and beast, so
that it is not surprising that the emigrants fondly remembered the “ﬂesh—
pots of Egypt‘. I’ithom, where the Israelites made bricks, probably lay,
as mentioned below, near Abt‘l Sulé‘mdn, which is situated to the S. of
the railway between Zalgazilg and Tell el-Kebir, and near which there is
a small lake. Farther on, near the ruin-covered hill of Itigdbeh, are
several muddy ponds, which contain a considerable Volume of water dur-
ing. the inundation, and are probably identical with the ‘ltarkabota‘
(nTDjB), or ponds of Pithom, mentioned in a papyrus of Anastasi VI.+
