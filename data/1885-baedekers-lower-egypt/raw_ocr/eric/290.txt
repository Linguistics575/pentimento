Starting from the Place Atab el—Kadra, between the Muski and
the lizbekiyeh (see above], the Boulevard Mohammed ‘Ati, 18603113.
in length, leads straight to the foot of the citadel. At the end of
this long street is the Place Sultan [lasan [P]. 19,2), with two
large mosques. That on the left is the 6am“ Rita’iyeh (P1. 59),
named after an order of dervishes (p. 1:30], and erected entirely
at the expense of the mother of the ex—Khedive lsma‘il, but still
unﬁnished. 0n the right, adjoining the Place ltuméleh, rises the—

**Gﬁmi' Sultan Easan (P1. All), the ‘superb mosque’, and the
ﬁnest existing monument of Arabian architecture. It was begun
in the year 757 of the llcgira (Al). 1356), and completed in three
years by Melik en-Nz‘tsir Ahn’l-Ma'ali llasan ibu lfalaﬁn, but is
now in a neglected and dilapidated condition.

Sultan (Insult. the sixth son of Sultan Nﬁsir (p. 277), was still a minor
when he ascended the throne in A.D. 1346. At the end of the vigorous
reign of Nﬁsir (d. 1341), which lasted 43 years, the Mamelukes and emirs
ruvnlled, and the state of anarchy which now ensued was further aggra-
vated by the prevalence of the plague or ‘blaek death‘ (131849), which
exterminated whole families, whose property was immediately seized by
the government. )Ialgrizi lp. 212), with the usual exaggeration of Orientals,
records that no fewer than 15—20,000])erson5 died at Cairo in a single day.
After having been dethroned in 1351, Hasan regained possession of his
sceptre three years later, but in 1361 he was again dethroned and ass-
assinated.

The lofty walls with their shallow niches, pierced with six
or seven windows one above the other, the huge gateway (see be-
low), and the S. minaret which is still preserved, present a ma-
jestic appearance, especially now that the incongruous additions
of later date have been rem0ved. The building is in the form of an
irregular pentagon, on the E. side of which the minarets and the
mausoleum [see below) form symmetrical projections. The windows
in the side are disposed somewhat irregularly, and the wall termi-
nates in a broad cornice. The angles of the ediﬁce are embellished
with columns built into the wall, with a wreath of pendentives or
‘stalactites' at the top, forming to some extent a new order of capital.

AccOrdiug to the legend, Sultan liasan, after the completion of
the work, ordered the architects hands to be cut oil", in order that he
might not erect a second building of equal splendour. [Similar
myths in various parts of Europe record that architects have been
blinded from the same motive.) The mosque of lllasan has always
llt't'll the chief rallying point of the ringleaders ofinsnrrections
and all kinds of public demonstrations.
