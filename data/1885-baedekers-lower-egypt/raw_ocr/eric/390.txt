Egyptian monuments which bear the names of their founders date
from the time of Sne/‘ru, who formed a link between the 3rd amt
4th Dynasties. That monarch was the immediate predecessor of
It'hu/‘u [or (,‘lteops, 13.0. 3091-67], Ii’hd/irti (or Chcphren, 3067-43],
and Menkuurt‘t (or .Uyccrinus, 3043—20), the builders of the Great
Pyramids (comp. pp. 86, 344-347). it continued customary to
build pyramids down to the ‘l‘Zth Dynasty (ll. C. 2300'); but at a
later period, especially after the residence ofthe Pharaohs had been
remover] from Memphis to Thebes, the kings, as well as their sub-
jects, seem to have preferred rock-tombs to mansolca above ground. l
The Greeks were much struck by these monuments when they ﬁrst
came to Egypt, and even erected similar ones themselves (as at
Cenohrezo), akin to the Mastabas (p. 379:). The Pyramids are.
therefore invariably described by Greek travellers-1', as well as by
their successors, and they afterwards became famous as one of the
greatest wonders of the world.

Herodotus, though ill informed as to the history of the founders
of the Pyramids, describes the structures themselves admirably,
like everything else he saw in person. Cheops (‘Khutu_‘), accord—
ing to his statement, was addicted to every kind of vice; he closed
the temples, prohibited the offering of sacriﬁces, and oppressed the.
whole nation by exacting compulsory labour. Some of his subjects
were employed by him in quarrying blocks of stone among the Arab-
ian mountains, and in transporting them to the Nile, others had
to ferry these stones across the river, while others again conveyed
them to the base of the Libyan mountains H. ‘Now there were
about 100,000 men employed annually for three months in each of
these tasks. They took ten years to make the road forthe. transport
ofthe stones, which, in my opinion, must have been almost as
laborious a task as the building ofthe Pyramid itself; for theleuglh
of the road amounts to ﬁve stadia (1017ydsJ, its breadth is ten
fathoms [GO ft), and its height, at the highest places, is eight
fathoms [48 ft], and it is constructed entirely of polished stone
with figures engraved on it ﬁt. Ten years were thus consumed in
making this road and the subterranean chambers on the hill oc-
cupied by the Pyramids, which the king caused to be excavated as
his burial-place, having“r made it an island by conducting: a canal
thither from the Nile. (,As to this erroneous statement, see p. 358.)
