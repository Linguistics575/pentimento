the ceiling, and kept in its place by iron cramps, here arrests the
farther progress of the explorer. The hardness of the material of
which this barrier consists compelled the Arabian treasure-hunters
(p. 352) to avoid it, and to force a new passage Ll’l. (ll through
the softer limestone. This is the roughest and most awkward spot
on the whole route. Beyond the rugged blocks at this point we
enter a passage (Pl. eel, ascending at about the same angle, and
41 yds. in length, beyond which lies the Great Hall (Pl. It). Before
entering the latter, we diverge at the point e, by the horizontal
passage ef. to the so-called Chamber of the Queens [P1, 9]. This
passage is at ﬁrst 3 ft. 9 in. only in height, but at a distance of
61/2 yds. from the chamber the ﬂooring sinks a little, so that the
height increases to 5ft. Sinches. The N. and S. sides of the chamber
are each 17 ft. in length, and the E. and W. sides 18 ft. 10 inches.
The heightis ‘20 ft. 4in., including the pointed roof, which consists
of enormous blocks of rock placed obliquely and leaning against
each other, and projecting beyond the sides of the walls to a
distance of 51/2 ft. into the surrounding masonry. We now
return to c and enter the Great Hall (Pl. h], the handsomest of the
comparatively small chambers in the interior of this colossal mass
of masonry. The jointing and polish of the ﬁne-grained lilo—
haitam limestone form an uusurpassable marvel of skilful masonry.
As the visitor can now breathe and look about him with more
freedom, he may verify the accuracy of 'Abdellatif’s remark, that
neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the joints of
the stones. The Great Hall is ‘38 ft. high and 1‘55 ft. long. The
lower part is 3 ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, beyond the
last of the panels of stone, each of which is 1 ft. 8 in. thick and
2 ft. high, is 7 ft. in width. The seven courses of stone composing
the roof, which seem to have been arranged in imitation of the
arch-principle, project slightly one above the other, serving to
strengthen and support the horizontal slabs which form the ceiling.
The parallel incisions in the pavement and on the walls were per-
haps used to facilitate the introduction of the sarcophagus, and they
now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At the end of the
Great llall is a small horizontal passage, 2‘2 ft. long and 3 ft. Sin.
high, expanding about the middle into an Antechamber LP]. 1"),
which was once closed by four trap-doors of granite. The remains
of these slabs, in their pendent position, should be noticed. We
next enter the King’s ”Lumbar (pl. It), the most interesting of all.
The N. and S. sides are each 17 ft. in length, the E. and W. sides
341/2 ft., and the height is 19 ft.; the ﬂoor of the chamber is
1391/2 ft. above the plateau on which the Pyramid stands. The
chamber is entirely lined with granite, and is roofed with nine
enormous slabs of granite, each 181/2 ft. in length, the ends of
which rest on the lateral walls. it. now contains nothing but an
empty and mutilated sarcophagus of granite, bearing no trace ofan
