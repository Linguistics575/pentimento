(ll). Beggars. Balrshish.

Most Orientals regard the European traveller as a Ortesus, and
sometimes too as a madman, -— so unintelligible to them are the
objects and pleasures of travelling. Povertyp they imagine, is
unknown among us, whereas in reality we feel its privations far
more keenly than they. That such erroneous rlotions prevailis to
some extent the fault of travellers themselves, In a country where
the requirements of the natives are few and simple, and money is
scarce, a few piastres seem a fortune to many. Travellers are there-
fore often tempted to give for the sake of affording temporary pleasure
at a trifling cost, forgetting that the seeds of insatiable enpidity are
thereby sown, to the inﬁnite annoyance of their successors and the
deuioralisation of the recipients themselves. As a rule, balcshish
should never be given except for services rendered, or to the sick
and aged.

Sir GardnerWilkinson has justly observed that the cry of ‘Balc-
shish, bait-shark, yd. Ichawdgeh’ (oh, sirl a giftl], with which Euro-
peans are invariably assailed, is an insulting substitute for the
‘good day’ of other countries. The Arab reserves his pious bene-
dirtions for his own countrymen, but never hesitates to take advan-
tage of bat he considers the folly of foreign travellers. The best
reply it suoh applications is ‘nu‘: fish, and fish’ (_l have nothing for
you ), whit-h will generally have the effect ofdispersingtheassailants.
Ur a beggar may he silenced with the words ‘Atlrih 3111'!ka [may God
give thee l].

The word ll(lz\’,.\‘f12.\‘fl, which resouuds so perpetually. iu the
traveller’s ears during his sojourn in the East, and haunts hiin long
afterwards, simply means ‘a gift’; and, as everything is to he had
in return for gifts, the word has many different applications.
'l‘hus with bakshish the tardy formalities of the custom—house
ol'lleer are accelerated, balishish supplies the plane of a passport,
bakshish is the allns bestowed on a beggar, balgshish means blaelr
mail, and lastly a large proportion of the public ofﬁcials of the
country are said to live by bakshish or bribery.

(10]. Public Safety. Weapons. Dogs.

l’rume Sarm‘v. The authority of the Khedive is so well
established throughout the whole of Egypt that travellers are very
rarely exposed to predatory attacks, even on the Sinai journey, and
travelling is indeed safer than ill some parts of Europe. The pro-
tection of an l-Sl‘Oft is therefore never necessary as it is in certain
regions of Palestine and Syria. Travellers, however, who have
m‘ieutillr ebjt-i'ts in View, and who require the eo-opemtiou 0f the
u-Ilivvs or of the pasha or mudir of a district, or these who have
reason to apprehend any difﬁculty or danger, may obtain through
their «'ullsulnll's a vieerl-gal reemnmemlatiou (ﬁrmdn or lcsltireh),
which will often he found very useful.
