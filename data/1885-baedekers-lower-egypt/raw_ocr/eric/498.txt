farmed out by government atn rent of1,500,000 frs. per annum, but what
a paltry sum is this compared with the value of the lostland!’ (Stephan).

The operation of draining the lake has been begun, particu-
larly of the part adjoining the Canal. Curious mirages are some-
times observed here.

Rds el-‘Esh is the last (15th] station. We soon come in sight
of the numerous masts of Port Sa’id, which we reach in 3/4 hr.
more. To the NW. are the white stones of the cemetery, the
tombs in which are constructed in the form of vaults of masonry
above ground, as the soil is saturated with salt water at adepth
of 2 ft. below the surface.

the traveller sees nothing of the low, sandy coast until the steamer
reaches the yellowish-green water near it, which is rendered turbid by the
mud of the Nile. The lighthouse and the masts of vessels at anchor in
