The lowest rate payable by small families for ﬁltered water is 8 fr. per
month. The whole length of the pipes for ﬁltered water, the largest
of which are 2ft. in diameter, amounts to 19 miles, and that of the pipes
for unﬁltered water to about (3 miles. The cost of the works amounted
to 5 million francs.

The very dusty read next leads to the unimportant tomb of

Shékh Galat, a little beyond which we reach the so-called ~—

“J‘l‘Tombs of the Khalifs,

which extend along the E. side of the city, and which, beyond the
Citadel, are known as Tombs of the )lamelnkes (p. 3‘27)+.

All these tombs, most of which are of vast extent, were once richly
endowed, each being provided with a numerous siaﬂ‘ of shékhs and at.—
tendants, who with their families resided within their precincts. At the
beginning of the present century the revenues of these establishments
were confiscated, so that the tombs are now falling to ruin. The (19'
scendants of the mosque attendants and other Arabs have since taken up
their quarters among the ruins, and the old necropolis has thus been
converted into a kind of suburb of Cairo, the inhabitants of which often
pester strangers with their importunitics.

A visit to the tombs is exceedingly interesting, particularly towards
Sunset, owing to the very curious and novel picture they present. They
may be reached by carriage, but the traveller will be more independent
on donkey~back. The necessary order of admission from the “’ahf mi-
nistry may he obtained through the consulate (see p. 2-11).

opposite the end of the Rue Neuvc, the E. prolongation of the lllushi.
This last point is specially recommended. as it also affords an admirable
survey of the town, the Nile, and the Pyramids, and is very easily
reached. llalf—nu-bour ofleisure before sunset can hardly be better spent
than on this bill (p. 237), but the beggars are often troublesome.

The N.E. group of these mausoleums (on the left when ap—
proached from llz'lb en—Nasr) consists of the Tomb o/‘Sulb‘m zlbu
Na'id Kansuwch ct—Ghdri (p. 274), a cube surmounted by an
elongated dome, and two tomb—mosques, one of Sulgzin et-Asltruf,
with ahandsome minaret, the other of Emir Yi‘tsuf, son of liursbcy
(see p. 285). These two mosques, “lilt'll present no attraction, are
now used for military purposes, and are not shown without special
permission from the minister of war. As visitors are prevented by
the sentry from approaching them, we leave them to the left, and
proceed in a. straight direction to the —
