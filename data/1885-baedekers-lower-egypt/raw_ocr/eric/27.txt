represented by consuls, that mixed tribunals should be appointed, consist-
ing of courts of first and second instance, for the trial of all civil cases
arising between natives and foreigners, (Ii-between foreigners of dill'erent
nationalities, in accordance with Egyptian law, founded on that of
France and Italy. Cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian
government are concerned are also tried before this new tribunal, so
that the system of appeals, formerly so much abused, is now done away
with. The courts of the ﬁrst instance are at Alexandria and Cairo.
The judges consist of natives and foreigners, the latter being elected by
the Khedive out of the qualiﬁed ofﬁcials nominated by the Great Powers.
The-appeal court at Alexandria is constituted in the same manner.
Sometn‘ the judges of the ﬁrst instance are also chosen from members
of the smaller European states. These courts enjoy a constitutional
guarantee for the independence of their jurisdiction, and, so far as
necessary, they execute their judgments by means of their own officers.
The languages used are Arabic, French, and Italian. From 1881 to 1834
the jurisdiction of these mixed tribunals was prolonged by the consent.
of the Powers from year to year, and at the beginning of the latter year
it was agreed to continue it for another period of ﬁve years. —— Besides
these new courts, the consular and local tribunals still. continue to sub-
sist, their jurisdiction being, however, limited to criminal cases and
to civil suits between foreigners of the same nationality, provided the
question does not affect land.

At the beginning of 188-1 there was called into existence :1 new sy-
stem of Native Com-ts, which take precedence of the mixed courts in de-
ciding criminal cases between natives and foreigners. The general pro-
cedure is based on the Code Napoleon. Courts of the ﬁrst instance have
been, or are to be erected at Cairo, Alexandria. Tania, Zalgﬁzilg, Beuha,
Beni Suél‘, Siﬁt, and lSene, while the courts of appeal are at Cairo and
siﬁt. With the native judges are associated ten Belgians, two Dutch-
men, and one Englishman. —A scheme is, however, on foot to appoint a
commission to extend to the mixed tribunals the criminaljurisdiction in
cases where different nationalities are engaged.

Alexandria, the chief seaport of Egypt, is regularly visited by
English, French, Austrian, Italian, Russian, Greek, and. Egyptian
steamers. Whether the traveller returns westwards on leaving
Egypt, or intends to proceed to Syria or elsewhere, it is important
that he should be familiar with the principal steamboat services.

The time-tables of the Peninsular zt‘ Oriental Steam Navigation ('0. may
be obtained in London at 122 Leadenhall St., E.C., or at 25 Cockspur SL,
S.W. Those who purpose including Syria, Greece, and Constantinople in
their Oriental tour should also, before leaving home, write to the
‘Admtm’stmtlon des Services ties Hessngcrics Jlm'z'tlmes, 16‘ Rue Cannebiére,
Illurseilles‘ for a ‘Ltvret rles Lignes (te la JIédltew-unée et rte la Iller Noire’,
and to the ‘Vel'wultngsrath der Dampfschzﬁfahrlsgescltschuft des Oester-
a'eich-Ungru'r'schcrt Lloyd, Tl'ieste’ for ‘Informttlr'on for Passengers by the
Austrian Lloyd’s Steam Navigation Cumpany’ (published in English). \\’ith
the aid of these time-tables, the traveller will have little difﬁculty in
making out his programme. See also ‘Baedel‘er’s Palestine and Syria’
(sold at the bookshops of Alexandria and Cairo).

In selecting a route the traveller must of course be guided by
circumstances and his own inclination. The shortest sea-voyage is
that from Brindisi, three days and a half; from Trieste (via Corfu),
or from Venice (via Ancona and Brindisi), ﬁve days; from Naples,
four days. The last-named route is perhaps the best for returning. as
the temperature of Naples and Rome forms apleasant intermediary
