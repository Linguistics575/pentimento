are necessarily stereotyped. There seems, however, tohave been 11
retrogrcssion in point of technical skill; for, as in the time of
Khafra, the hardest materials still became Compliant, and the dif—
tlculties ot' the minutest detail were still successfully overcome by
the sculptors of the Pharaohs.

Another considerable break new took place in the progress of
Egyptian art. This dreary interval began with the invasion of

the llyksos or Shepherds, and lasted throughout

the whole of their domination. To them is at-

tributed the destruction of the older monuments,

and they themselves have left no architectural re-

it mains behind them. They were not,-however,

‘ entirely insensible to the charms of art, and after

the ﬁrst terrors of the invasion were over, they

il did not prevent the Egyptian artists from prose-

], T outing their calling. As the Normans in Sicily

adopted the culture of the conquered Arabs, so

i i the llyksos turned to account the knowledge of

, art and the technical skill possessed by the Egyp-

tians. The sculptures excavated at Tanis, the cap-

t ital of the Hyksos (four sphinxes and particu-

larly a group of river-gods in granite), are of

Egyptian workmanship, and there is nothing to

betray their origin in the llyksos period except

the type of the features, the bushy boards, and
the thick tufts of hair.

With the expulsion of the llyksos begins a
newperiod, in the history of art as well as in that
; s of politics. The warlike and victorious monarchs
of the liighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, in
particular, have perpetuated. their memory by
astonishingly numerous monuments. The compulsory labour of
captive enemies afforded the architects an opportunity of carrying
out their most gigantic designs, while the achievements of their
sovereigns, such as the campaigns of 'l‘llothmcs, Amenophis, and
ltalnses, supplied the sculptors with an inexhaustible theme for
the decoration of the facades of their temples. To this period of
the new empire belong most of the Theban monuments. The taste
for the great and the colossal, and for symmetry of proportion had
attained itseullninating point, but the stagnation of tho lifesprings
