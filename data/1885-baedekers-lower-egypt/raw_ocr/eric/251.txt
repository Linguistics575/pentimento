taritl). At Kafr ez-Zaiyat (p. 225) there is a European restaurant. The
only refreshments obtainable at the other stations are boiled eggs (béd),
Arabian bread ['éshl, water (mGyeh), and oranges (bortulgan) and sugar-
cane (hasab) in their seasons (1/2-2 copper piastres).

The railway—station (Pl. 2-, ‘r, 5) is not far from the hotels. but the
traveller had better drive to it, starting from his hotel at least half-an-
honr before the advertised time of departure. New—comers and travellers
burdened with much luggage should engage the. eommissionnaire of the
hotel or a valet—de-plaee [25.) to assist in booking their luggage, an
operation carried on by the employés with those alternations of apathetic
indolence and violent hurry which are so characteristic of Orientals.
The Alexandria and Cairo line, the ﬁrst railway constructed in the East,
was made under Sa'id Pasha in 1%.") and was to have been continued by
another line from Cairo across the desert to Suez, but the latter project
has been abandoned. The names of the stations are not called out.
The Arabian villages (comp. p. 30) seen from the line present a very
curious appearance, and the interior of their half~open mud«hovcls is
frequently visible.’ The dust is very annoying in hot weather, forcing
its way into the carriages even when the windows are closed.

The train ﬁrst traverses gardens towards the N.E., and beyond
Sidi G'r‘tber diverges to the right from the line to liosetta (p. 447).
To the left is the ruin of the Kasa- el—Kaydrereh (p. 222), situated
on the coast, with the chateau of Ramleh (p. 222) in the distance.
Jt then crosses the Mahmﬁdiyeh Canal (p. 448) and skirts its S.
bank nearly as far as stat. Damauht‘lr (see below]. To the left lies
the Lake ofAbulct‘r (Beltcret Ma’udiyeh); to the right is Lake Murcotis
(Behérel Maryt‘tt), the water of which washes the railway embank—
ment at places during the period of the inundation, while in sum—
mer it is a considerable distance from it.

The Lake Mareotis, or Jim-eta, as it was also called in ancient times,
hounds Alexandria on the S. side. In Strabo’s time it was ﬁlled from the
Nile by means of numerous canals, both from the S. and E., which
brought great trafﬁc to this inland harbour, While the sea-harbour was
more important for the export trade. The lake, which lies 8 ft. below
the sea—level, was 0 Lee surrounded by a luxuriantly fertile tract of country,
irrigated from the riﬂe as early as the time of Herodotus. The banks once
yielded excellent white wine, which has been extolled by Horace and
Virgil, and is mentioned by Athenzeus as having been particularly
wholesome. Egypt now produces very little wine, but reminiscences
of its culture in ,the region of Lake Mar-eotis are still preserved in
the name Karm (1'. e. ‘vineyard’, p1. kurﬁm), which the Arabs apply to
some ancient ruins here, and in numerous wine-presses hewn in the
rocks which still exist. lilahmi’id-Bey and Professor Kiepert divide this
coast region into four parallel zones: (1) The chain of sand—hills on the
coast, where many old ruins are still observable; 1‘2) The depresswnof
the Wz‘tdi Maryt‘it, a western prolongation of the lake, the water of which
