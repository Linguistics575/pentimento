Library. (Juno. 3. Route. 269

A long series of tortuous streets, called Derb el—Gamfzmt:
[‘sycamore street’], running not far from the canal, leads hence
towards the N. to the Boulevard Alche’met Ali. After fully half-a—
mile we come to a small open space by the canal, shaded by some
ﬁne acacias. The gate 011 the right leads to the viceroyal $Library
(Kutubkhcinch, P1. 30), founded by the Khedive Isma'il on 94th
March, 1870, in the left wing of the ofﬁce of the minister of public
worship. The collection consists of a number of books formerly
preserved in various other institutions, and of others purchased or
presented by the Khedive, and is dedicated to the use of the public.
One of the ﬁnest presentations to the collection is the valuable
library of Mustafa Pasha, which occupies a separate room. The
whole library consists of about 25,000 vols., chieﬂy Arabic and
Turkish works, and there is a small European department, prin-
cipally containing scientiﬁc works in French, which is to be gradu—
ally extended. The library is open to the public from 3 to 6 and
from 7 to 10 o’clock by Arabian time, Le. about three hours in the
forenoon and three hours in the afternoon, and the ofﬁcials are
instructed to afford visitors all the information in their power.
Books must be consulted in the reading—room, the use of which
is accorded to persons provided with a permission from the ministry
of public instruction or with a certiﬁcate from their consul, hear-
ing their names, and available for a year. The library is closed on
Fridays; and during the month of Ramadan it is open in the
afternoon only. The chief credit of arranging and increasing this
ﬁne collection of books belongs to two Germans, Dr. Stern and Dr.
Spitta-Bey (d. 1883), but the present director is an Arab shékh,
named Murad Effendi.

The liherality with which the treasures of Muslim literature are thus
thrown open to the European public is deserving of all praise. A spe-
cial feature of the library, possessed by no other Oriental collection
available to Frank-s, consists of the illusulzif, or copies of the Koran,
collected f1on1 various mosques of Cairo, and now preserved from de-
strnction. They are remarkable for their large size, superb execution,
and great age, and constitute the ﬁnest existing specimens of Arabian art.

The oldest specimen of the Koran is one in the C‘uﬁc, or early Arabian,
character, 12 inches in length, and 83/1 inches in width. It contains one—
half of the Koran only, and is in a very damaged condition, having,
moreover, onée been injured by ﬁre. The titles of the siirebs are bordered
with gold, and the carefully written text illuminated with coloured letters.
According to the testimony of a shékh Who saw the ‘nohle book’ in
its perfect condition this Koran was written by Ga'far- e_s- -Sdclik, son of
lilohammed el- Bakir. son of rA11 Z611 el- 'Abidm, son of IIusen, son of 'Ali,
son of Abu Talib and son—in—law of the Prophet. This Ga‘far was a great
chemist and scholar, Whose pupil Tartusi, according to Ibn Khallikau
(1147‘ ed. of Bulak), once stated that he had Written about 500 ditl‘erent
pamphlets. He lived in the years 80-1-18 of the Hegirn, and this Koran
would thus be about 1150 years old. There is considerable doubt as to
the accuracy of this stOry, but the MS. is certainly of very early date.

The other ﬁne large copies ofthe Koran, about twenty' in all, are of later
origin, most of them having been executed by order of the sultans of the
Bahrite Mamelukes (12601382) and of the Cireassian Mamelukes (1382-1516),
while a few of them date from the still later period of the Osman sultaus.
