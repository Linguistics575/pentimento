336 Route .1. neigAT'rAM. Erwirom ‘

The WVinw from this point, especially with its sunset colour-
ing, is magniﬁcent. The thousand minarets of the city and the
picturesque buildings of the Citadel are then tinted with a delicate
rosy hue. Tire grandest of all the burial-grounds of the desert forms
a noble foreground, the venerable Nile dotted with its lateen sails
ﬂows below us in its quiet majesty, and to the \V., on the borders
of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous old Pyr-
amids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. At our feet are
the (litadel with the mosque of Mohammed 'Ali, the old aqueduct
on theleft, andthe domes of Imam Shelfe'i (p. 327]. On a rocky emin-
ence are situated the picturesque ruins of several burial-mosques,
which, being of the same colour as the rock, are apt to escape the
notice of travellers on the Nile or its banks.

The )lol-gattam zmd the adjacent hills which tlzmk the valley of the
Nile, belong to the great range of the nnmmulite mountains which ex-
tend from NJV. Africa, across Egypt and India, to China. This num-
mulite formation is one of the Eocene, m- oldest deposits of the tertiary
period, and immediately follows the chalk. it is remarkably rich in
fossils. the chief mass of which consists of millions of nnmmulites (a kind
of snail-shell), or large rhizopodes of the polythalmniea group. The tar»
ger kinds are about one inch in diameter, and the smaller about 1/5 inch.
(In removingr the outer coating of limestone, we lind the well-deﬁned
chambers within. They are also frequently seen, out into two halves, in
the stones of the Pyramids, which are to a. great extent constructed of
nummulite limestone. The Greeks also noticed these curious fossils, and
Herodotus mentions the smallest kinds as being,r petriﬁed lentils, of the
sort eaten by the ancient Egyptians (comp. 333).

The numerous quarries in the slopes of the Mohatturn and the higher
side—valleys of the range also yield a profusion of sea-urchins (clypeaster,
eidaris, echinolurnpns, etc), various kinds of oysters, ceritliiuru, ovula,
stromlms. nerina, furritella, nautilus, bivalves, 'sharks‘ teeth, and bones
of the halicore. Beautiful crystals of isinglass~stone and ot' slronlian also
occur, the shells of the numrnulites having frequently been crystallised
into the latter mineral.

At the N. end of the plateau is an old Turkish fort, whence a
bridge descends to the Citadel, but travellers are not permitted to
use this route. On the 1.). and higher part of the Molyattani, to the
right, adjoining the summit, is a tlagstatf erected in 1574 by the
English party of scientiﬁc men who observed the transit of Venus
from this point. The S. (rightl end of these bills is skirted by the
road to the smaller Petriﬁed Forest, which may be reached from
this point in about 3/4 hour.

()n the way back our route hears a little to the right, and
away from the lofty perpendicular sides of the aheve—rnentioned
quarry. The route back to the town vial the Citadel turns to the
left after {’4 hr., near some ancient tomb-caverns, crosses anew
bridge, and enters the Citadel by the B61; cl—Gcbcl, passing a
number of dirty canteens. Turning immediately to the left, we
pass the Well of Joseph [1). 261:] on the left, and reach the broad
road leadiui,r to the city.
