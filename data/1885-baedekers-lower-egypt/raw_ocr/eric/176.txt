Remarks on Mohammedan Customs.

The birth of a child is celebrated on the seventh day of its life
by a domestic festival, attended by the lgiidi or some learned theo-
logiﬂll‘ who dissolxes in his mouth a piece ofsngar-eandy presented
to him by the host and drops a little of his sweetened saliva into
the infant's mouth, as it' to give it a sweet foretaste of the World‘s
gifts. and also for the purpose of ‘giviug it a name out ofhis inoutli'.
Muslims, it is well known, are usually named by their prouomens
only. If a more precise designation is desired, the name of the
father is placed after the pronomeu, with or without the word ilm,
(‘souof'l placed between the names. Nicknames, such as ‘the one-
cyed'. etc., are also not uncommon.

When the. child is forty days old the mother takes it to the bath,
and causes forty howls of water [thirty—nine in the ease of a girl]
to be poured over its head. This hath forms the puriﬁcation] of both
mother and child.

The rite of circumcision is performed on boys up to the age of
six or seven, or even later, the Ceremony being attended with great
pomp. The child is previously couductedthrough the streets in holiday
attire, theprooession being frequently united with somebridal party,
in order to diminish the expense of the proceedings. The boy gener-
ally wears a turban of red cashmere, girls" clothes of the richest
possihle description, and conspicuous female ornaments, which are
designed to attract attention, and thus avert the evil eye from his
person. A handsomely oaparisoued horse is borrowed to carry him;
he half covers his face with an embroidered handkerchief; and the
harbor who performs the operation and a noisy troop of musicians
head the procession. The ﬁrst personage in the procession is usually
the harher's hey, carrying the ‘heml‘, or barber's sign, a hind of
cupboard made of wood, in the form of a half—cylinder, with four
short legs. The flat front of the heiul is adorned with pieces 01'
looking-glass and embossed brass, While the back is covered with
a curtain. Two or more boys are often thus paraded together, being
usually driven in a carriage and attended by music.

liirls are generally married in their I'Zth or 13th, and some—
times as early as their 10th year. A man in search of a bride
eiup oys the services of a relative, or of a professional female
match-maker, and he never has an opportunity of seeing his bride
until the neddiug—day. except when the parties belong to the
lth st, classes. When everything is arranged, the afﬁanced bride-
vronli l 33 to pay a bridal-portion (mam) amounting to about (251.,

Hem-rally speaking, about two—thirds of the sum, the amount
If which always forms a subject of lively discussion, is paid
d .wu, while one—third is settled upon the wife, being payable on
till' death of the husband, or on his divorcing her against her will.
