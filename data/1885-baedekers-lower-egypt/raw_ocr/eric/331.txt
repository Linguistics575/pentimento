creams. CAIRO. 3. Route. 295

A peculiarity of many of the books recently printed at Bﬁlak is that
smaller works illustrative of the text are printed on the margins of the
pages. The paper used for the purpose is made in Egyptian manu-
factories, chieﬂy from maize-straw, which accounts for its yellowish tint.

The great attraction at Bridal; is the —

“Museum of Egyptian Antiquities (the traveller bound for
which has only to direct his donkey-boy ‘lil Antikét’], a magni-
ﬁcent collection, and entirely unrivalled of its kind. A great ad—
vantage possessed by it over all the European museums is that the
places where all its monuments and relics have been found are
known, and indicated by labels, a circumstance of the greatest im-
portance in assisting historical and geographical research. The col—
lection was founded by M. Mariette-Pasha, who died in 1881 and
has been succeeded as director by Prof. IlIaspe'ro, another French-
man. The keeper of the museum is Herr Brugsch-Bey, who is as-
sisted by M. Bowiunt.

The arrangement of the museum has recently been entirely
altered, and most of the treasures formerly stored in the magazines
have new found a place in the building itself. Several of the rooms
have been enlarged and an addition has been built to receive the
objects found at Dér el-Bahri, near Thebes, in 1881. Prof. Maspero
has also caused a room to be ﬁtted up for monuments of the Greek,
Roman, and Coptic periods.

The Museum is open daily, except on Fridays, from 8 to 12 and
from 2 to f); in winter from 8 to 1‘2 and i to 4 o‘clock (no fee).
Strangers, who wish to make special studies, will receive every
facility from the director and keepers.
