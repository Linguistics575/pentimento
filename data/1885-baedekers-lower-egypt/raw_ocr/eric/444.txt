leads to the right, in a direction parallel with the main corridor,
but now built up, as it was in a dangerous condition. A little
beyond this point we reach the E. end of the main gallery (Pl. B].
Retracing our steps for a short distance, we turn to the right, pass
over another sarcophagus which
blocks the way by means of steps,
and thus regain the door by which
we entered the vaults. The tem—
perature in these subterranean
chambers, to which the outer air
has little or no access, is always
about 79", that being the mean
temperature of Cairo.

Before taking our leave of this
extraordinary place, we may quote
the interesting words of its dis—
coverer: —

*1 confess’, says Mariette, ‘that
when I penetrated for the ﬁrst time, on
12th Nov. 1851, into the Apis vaults, I
was so profoundly struck with aston<
ishinent that the feeling is still fresh
in my mind, although ﬁve years have
elapsed since then. Owing to some
chance which it is difﬁcult to account

to conceal the doorway were still re-
cognisable on the lime. There were
also the marks of naked feet imprint-
ed on the sand which lay in one car-
ner of the tomb—chamber. Everything
was in its original condition in this
tomb, where the embalmed remains

wiggg‘aémmm ellers would think it terrible to live

here alone in the desert for a number

of years; but such discoveries as that of the chamber of Ramses 11. pro-

duce impressions compared with which everything else sinks into in-
srgniﬁcance, and which one constantly desires to renew”.

The *4’Mastaba of Ti (2130 paces to the NE. of Mariette’s
house; see Map, p. 378) is the most interesting and best preserved
monument of this kind (comp. p. 379] in the extensive Necropolis
of the ancient capital of the primzeval monarchy. It lies in an old
street of tombs, now covered up; and the surface of the soil has
