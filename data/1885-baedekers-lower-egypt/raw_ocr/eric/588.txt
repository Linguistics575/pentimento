518 Route 10. WADI neunAN. From Suez

the N.E. and then towards the N.W., and at length reach the dei
Sebr‘t‘iyeh, at the 8.10. base of the Jebel Mesa, recognisable by its
church and monastery. {Towards the N. the Willi Seba'iyeh is
connected with the Waidi esh-Shékh by the Wiz‘dz' Sadad; comp.
p. 5‘20). A saddle of moderate height separates the Wédi Seba'iyeh
from the Wadi ed—Dér (‘valley of the monastery’]. To the left, on
the precipitous Jebel Musa, which is quite perpendicular at the
top, we perceive the zigzags of the road constructed by 'Abbés
Pasha (p. 510). We at length descend the narrow Wa‘idi ed-Dér
[Shu‘aibj , and reach the lofty walls of the monastery of St.
Catharine [see p. 503).

(2) Trmouen Tun WADI HRBRAN. 1st Day. For one hour we
ascend a gradual slope with a saline soil to the Umm Sa‘ad, where
a spring of fresh water affords support to a few families. The
waterskins should be ﬁlled here, and a supply of dates purchased, as
the desert of El-Iﬂlfa, 6 hrs. in width, has now to be traversed. We
follow the road of rAbbas Pasha, which, though sometimes covered
with sand on the low ground, is always sufﬁciently marked to in-
dicate the direction to the \Nadi Hebran. For the ﬁrst hour or two
we pass a number of di‘rm—palrns, but these also at length disappear.
A single seyal—tree stands about halfway, but otherwise we are sur-
rounded by the hot desert, which is at ﬁrst covered with ﬁne sand,
afterwards with rubble, and at length with enormous blocks of stone
in the vicinity of the precipitous mountains. The wadi Hebran
is reached about sunset. At the point where it issues from the
mountains it is a deep and very narrow rocky ravine. A rocky re—
cess close to the entrance affords quarters for the ﬁrst night.

2nd Day. The route through the wadi llebran Winds consider-
ably; the formation is granite, in which syenite predominates; it
contains thick veins of hornblende, slate, geenstone, and various
kinds of basalt. The volume of the brook varies according to the
season; its banks are bordered with vegetation. The path, which
is comparatively good, and passes a number ofSinaitic inscriptions,
was to have been converted into a carriage-road by ‘Abbﬁs Pasha,
but his plan was never carried out. After 13/4 hr. the valley di—
vides, and the road of 'Abbﬁs l’asha leads to the N. At a second
bifurcation [3/4 hr.) the valley expands, and in t/2 hr. more we
reach a clear and abundant spring, but disagreeably warm. The
tarfa bushes and palms here form an impenetrable thicket. Water
now disappears (10 min), the vegetation becomes scantier, and
we proceed to cross the precipitous Nulcb cl-‘In‘jjziuu‘ (3290 ft).
Our quarters for the second night are near the dei Sclﬁ/Tp. 501).
(tn the third day we reach the direct route loading from Mt. Sor—

hal to the Nakb cl-llﬁwi, etc. {see p. 501).

'Anmm will be visited by scientiﬁc travellers only (5-6 days‘ journey].
The ﬁrst day from the monastery of Si. Catharine is generally short on
account of the late start. — On the 2nd Day the watershed between the
Gulf of Suez and that of ‘Akabn is crossed, and the Wadi Sa‘l traversed.
