Panels or friezes bearing inscriptions of this character produce
\ery rich and pleasing appearance. When viewed from a moderate
distance, especially if enhanced by colouring, the broad characters
stand out with great effect. The ground then resembles a network
of lace, the delicate lines of the arabesqucs being indistinguish-
able except on close inspection. Sultan llasau’s mosque (p. ‘2th)
contains a remarkably handsome frieze of this description. The
large and bold characters On the mosques or private houses which
strike the eye. of the traveller are almost invariably texts from the
Koran, while historical notices in a small running character are
often inscribed on marble slabs over the entrances and the lattice-
work of the sebils, where they are sometimes carvedin wood. Similar
inscriptions also occasionally occur in the halls of the interior.
The observer can scarcely fail to be struck with the apparently
capricious wayin which this ornamentationis distributed, the artist
hating; sometimes lavished the whole richness of his arahesques
upon certain spots to the neglect of others. When this peculiarity
is more closely examined, it will be found that the parts thus
favoured are —— (‘1) the l’ortals, which are embellished with a
framework of rich friezes, with rosettes to mark certain points,
with artistic sculpturing on the architrave, and with pendents in I
the ceilingr of the niche; (’2) the l\linarets, which it was customary
to place over or adjacent to the portals, but seldom from structural
motives; (3) the external surfaces of the Dome, which are. sometimes
covered with arahesques, and sometimes with roll—mouldings
or wreaths; (i) the Kibla, with its handsome border, its capitals
and columns, which are often rich and beautiful , its ﬁne mosaics.
its miniature pseudo-arcades; [5] the l’cndeuts iu the interior of
mausolenms; Lli‘) the Ceilings; (‘7) the Mambar (pulpit), which is
partly in stone and partly in wood. The lattice—work, windows,
doors, couches or sofas ((likkch), lanterns, and lamps are also much
ornamented. These last are sometimes made of very curious
enamelled glass, but few are now to he found in the mosques.
(‘olnw does not perhaps play quite so conspicuous a part in the
l'lgi‘pto-Arahian monuments as in the Spanish; but the Egyptian
artists, like those ofthe Alhambra, were also much addicted to the
useofhright colours, aspecially red, blue, yellow, gold, and white.
The ground of the. decorative inscriptions is frequently deep blue.

painting was never so highly developed here as in Spain, where
the artists showed a certain appreciation ofperspective by painting
the lower parts of their walls with dark colours and gradually
