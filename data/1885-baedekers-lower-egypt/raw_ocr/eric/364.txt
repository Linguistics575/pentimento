oldest part being near the entrance, in the S. facade of the court.
The arches are of very various forms, some of them being almost
circular, while others, particularly those in the apertures of the
wall, form anearly acute angle with straight sides. Horseshoe arches
also occur, and others are constructed in arbitrary and fantastic
shapes. The capitals display a great variety of Roman and Byzantine
forms, and some of them, not quite completed, in the ruined 1V.
colounade, were perhaps Arabian imitations of Ptoleniaic models.
The baths and other buildings once connected with the mosque are
no longer traceable.

The colonnades 011 the W. side (that of the entrance) are now
supported by one row of columns only. Of the double columns that
once stood here one Pair of Columns 0’]. 1?) alone remains. They
are placed very close together, and it is said that none but honest

1808 this mosque. which has long been almost disused, witnessed a
very remarkable scene. At the usual period of the rise of the Nile,
the water began to fall. Dismayed by this strange phenomenon, the

sect, and the Jewish rabbis, with one accord, assembled in the
mosque of “Arm to pray for the rise of the water, and so effectual
were their prayers that the river ere long rose to its wanted ferti-

The porous water jars (Arabic Kulleli) used throughout the whole of
Eg1pt are chictlv manufactured at liencb in Upper Egypt of light gut}
clay of very eqdal consistency. The remarkably uniform and delicate
porosity of the vessels is produced by mixing the clay with ashes which,
the ﬁrst time the vessel is used. are partly 11asl1ed away by the 11 ater. The
rapid evaporation caused by the porosity of the lculleh cools the liquid
within to a temperahne of 12-14” lower than that of the surrounding air.
