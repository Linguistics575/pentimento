of Ra. As Apis is associated with Ptah , so
this bird by the side of Ra is a symbol of
the soul of Osiris. —— lia is generally re-
presented with the head of a hawk, and co-
loured red. He holds in his hands the sym-
bols of life and sovereignty, and wears on
his head a disk with the Uracus serpent, or
basilisk. According to the esoteric andpan-

the tombs of the kings, Ra is the great Uni-

merely so many impersonations of his
various attributes (see Ammon Ra, p. 138).

Tum, or Atum. a manifestation of Ra,
whose name is perhaps akin to temi, signi-

Lower Egypt, particularly at Heliopolis and
at the city of Pa-tum , that is, ‘the place of
Tnm’, the Pithom of Scripture. His rites
were also celebrated in Upper Egypt at an
early period. He is one of the oldest of the
gods, having existed ‘on the waters’ in the
dark chaos of the embryonic world, prior to
the ﬁrst sunrise, or birth of llarmachis from
the lotus ﬂower. According to the later ex-

of the infernal regions which obstruct the
progress of the sun’s bark, and is repre—

Upper and Lower Egyptian crown, or the
orb of the sun, on his head, and the emblems
of sovereignty and life in his hands. As the
creator he sometimes has a scarabaaus for

a lion, surmounted by a hawk crowned with
