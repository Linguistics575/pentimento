needles, phials for salves and cosmetics, nails, and other ﬁnely-
executed objects in wood. 4737. Double comb, in wood; 4728.
Three polishing stones; 4747. Six ﬁsh-hooks; 4764. Small lizard in
lead, a metal seldom used by the ancient Egyptians. 4791. Model
of an Egyptian house, showing that the present natives of Kurna
and Drah abu’l Negga have in no way improved or altered the
domestic architecture of their forefathers. 4830. Iron key, probably
of the Grzeco-Roman period.

Cabinet AB. Weapons, darts, chisels, knives, pincers, axes, and
arrow-heads. Many of the chisels and axes (e. g. 4657, 4463) bear
the cartonches of Thothmes Ill. and Queen Hatasu [18th dyn.].
4705. Bronze chisel with the head of a hawk; 4714-4716. Bows
and arrows, some of the latter tipped with ﬂint or bone (see also
No. 4720]. The two alabaster statues (Nos. 4648, 4685) belong to
the 4th or 5th dynasty and are destitute of inscriptions. 4676.
Double group in limestone, found at Salglg‘zlra (5th or 6th dyn.) —
4673, 4674. Two boards for games: the ﬁrst is divided into 30
squares, four of which bear special names; the other has three
squares, with holes for the insertion of the wooden pins used
in the game, Both date from the period Of the 17th dynasty and
were found at Thebes. — 4713. Sabre of hard wood, with the name
of King Rasekenen on the one side and that of the ‘royal son’ on
the other.

Cabinet AV (without glass) contains basreliefs of the period of
the 18th dynasty. The titles, as well as the style of execution and
design, which recall the monuments of Tell el-Anrarna, seem to in-
dicate that the persons here represented lived at the close of the
reign of Amenophis lll. or the beginning of that of Amenophis IV.

Cabinet AX contains a selection of Canopi [see p. 301). —
5005,5008. Two unﬁnished statues in grey serpentine, found at
Mitrahineh (Memphis), the one of a man kneeling and holding a
naos, the other a standing ﬁgure divided by a still distinguishable
red line into two halves. —— 5021. Granite statue without an inscrip-
tion, found at Karnak and probably belonging to the 18th dynasty.
The ﬁgure is in a kneeling posture and holds in front of it a kind
of altar in the form of a column, with the head of llathor and a lotus.

We now leave the Salle Funéraire and pass into the Salle des
Momies Royales, which contains the valuable collection of monu-
ments found at Der el-Bahri [Thebes] on July 5th, 1881.

The ﬁrst suspicious of the existence of the royal tombs at Der e]-
Bahri date from 1871, but the Arabs of the neighbourhood carefully con-
cealed their knowledge of them and long baffled the curiosity of travellers.
Statuettes of Osiris, rolls of papyrus, and other objects offered for sale
at Lulgsor gradually put investigators on the right scent, and ﬁnally in
1891 the source of these antiquities was discovered, yielding a treasure

that surpassed the most sanguine expectations.
