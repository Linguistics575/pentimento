bahshish, the visitor may ascend the B211) en—Vasr and the city—
wall, and walk along the t0p of the latter to the Bab el-Futﬁh.
These gates, the most important of the sixty which once existed
in the walls of Cairo, were erected by the vizier Berd Gamali in
the 11th century. The Bill) en-Nasr in particular is built ofwell—
hewu stone, and has vaulted winding staircases in the interior,
groined vaulting in the gateway, girders with a kind of hatched
moulding, and cornices with a corbeled frieze. Over the entrance
are a slab with a Guﬁc inscription, and decorative shields. rl‘he
principal entrance of the B2113 el—Futﬁh is ﬂanked with semicir-
cular towers, and that of the Bab en-Nasr with square towers. The
spaces between the inner and outer gates are vaulted.

eminence not far from the road, is interred J. L. Burclchardt
(d. 1817), the distinguished Oriental traveller, Whose works are
still of high authority.

Before leaving the city—wall to the right, we observe on the
left two towers with iron basins, being the reservoirs of the Water-
works supplying the palace of tho Khedive in the rAbbasiyeh and
the Citadel. In front of these, but less visible, are the ﬁve large

ﬁlters for purifying the town supply.

The water is pumped into these ﬁlters by engines of 1507hnrse power,
situated in the Isma‘iliya quarter, on the canal of that name. A smaller
pump adjoining the ﬁlters is used for providing,r the Citadel with water. The
ﬁrst temporary pumping machinery, erected in 186566, at Kasr el-‘Ain,
was employed in ﬁlling the basins in the desert, and also in supplying a
small part of the city. The distribution of water is now effected by a.
double system of pipes, through one set of which the ﬁltered water is
forced to a. height of about 80ft, while the other brings unﬁltered Water
from the neighbourhood of Bdlﬁllr for the purpose of watering the streets
and the gardens, conducting it to a height of about 30ft. only. The
engines in the Isma’iliya quarter are capable of supplying the town
with 30,000 cubic metres, or about 111,000 cubic feet, of water per day.
The government pays 40 centiures for each cubic metre of ﬁltered water
