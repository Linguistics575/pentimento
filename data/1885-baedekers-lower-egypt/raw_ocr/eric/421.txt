(now 2171/4 ft.) in length, and they Were inclined at an angle of51°‘12'35”.
With regard to the central one of these pyramids, that to the S. of the
last, the inscriptions state that ‘the dwelling of Iiaeenrusel- stands fast‘.
Ti (p. 388,) and other priests, whose mastahas were found at Saklu’ira,
presided over the rites connected with this pyramid. According to very an-
cient inscriptions, a peculiar kind of monument (an obelisk standing on a
truncated pyramid), dedicated to the sun, and bearing the name of Rash-
epnab, is said once to have stood near the pyramid of Ra-en—user. The
name of the largest pyramid (sides 108, formerly 1201/2 yds., perpendicular
height 16:"), formerly 229 ft.l, situated a little to the S.\V., is unknown.
Petting (p. 351) found that all the chambers had been entered and plain
dered. The other pyramids are mere heaps of ruins, and one of them (to
the S.\V. of the largest) seems never to have been completed.

Continuing our route to Salglgdra, we leave to the left a pond and
the village of Abusi‘r, situated beyond a group of palms to the S.E., and
soon reach the sandy eminences of the Necropolis of Memphis, at the be-
ginning of which the tomb of Ti is situated.

The Site of Ancient Memphis and the Necropolis of Sahhara.

A visit to Memphis and Salglgara may easily be accomplished in one
day by the aid of the railway, but 11/2-2 days may proﬁtably be devmad
to the excursion. There are, indeed, but few of the tombs in the Necro—
polis of Salghara which are accessible to the ordinary visitor. but the
interiors of these are so interesting, that many travellers will ﬁnd them
worthy of careful and repeated inspection. A tent is not absolutely ne»
cessary for the expedition. The traveller may pass the night at Mariet-
te‘s house (p. 377), or on its covered terrace. or, if necessary. in one of the
numerous caverns in the neighbouring rocks. A blanket is a sufﬁcient
covering in spring. Provisions should not be forgotten, and liquors may,
if necessary, be procured at Bedrashén at the shop of a Greek ‘bahhﬁl‘
ton the right, beyond the bridge).

RAILWAY (Ligne de la IImzle»Egg/p(e). The Station of Btildzt' eerakrFu'
is situated on the left bank of the Nile, 3 Ill. from Cairo, a drive of
1/2 hr. (5 fr.). The train, starting daily at 8.30 a. m., runs thence to Bed-
rashén (see below) in 1/2 hr. (fares 10 pias. '20 paras, 7pias.-, fare for don-
key and attendant, 21/2 fr.; see below). The inspection of the site of
Memphis, and the ride to )Iariette‘s House, occupy 2 hrs.; for luncheon
and a visit to the tombs 4 hrs. should be allowed. and for returning to
the station of Bedrashén 2 hrs. more. The train from Upper Egypt gener-
laly reaches BedrashEn about 6. 30 p.m., so that the traveller should leave
Sakkara a little after 4 o‘clock. The hotel at Cairo will thus he regained
about 8 p.m. It is desirable to arrive in good time both at Bﬁlak and
Bedrashén, as the train, though generally late1 occasionally starts before
its time.

Those who wish to spend a night at Sahhﬁra may return from Bed—
rashen to Cairo either on the second evening (as above), or at 10.45 a.m.
by the special train from the Fayﬁm (see p. 456]; or the traveller may
start at 3 pm. from Ilﬁlz‘tlg ed-l)akr1ir l‘or BedrashC-n by the Faytim train,
ride in the evening to Sakhdra, and thus have the whole of the next day
at his disposal. It should, however, he remarked that the trains to and
from the Fayﬁm start from Blilalg ed-Dakrﬁr at the time when the Nile
bridge at Gezireh is open for the passage of vessels (during 2 hrs.).
Crossing the river in a small boat is not recommended, owing to the
great confusiOn which prevails. — Donkeys with good saddles may now
be Obtained in Bedrashén, so that it is no longer necessary to bring them
from Cairo. . . .

On leaving the station we observe the Pyramids of Gizeh

(p. 343] on the right, in such a position, that the Pyramid of

Gheops conceals the other two. The View to the left is atrlirst hid-

den by the lofty walls of the large estate at Uizch U). 341), which
