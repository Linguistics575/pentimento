eller to complete this circuit of the bed of the lake, which is norv dried
up. Recently, however, Mr. F.0ope \Vhitehouse, relying upon the great
circumference assigned by Herodotus (11, 149) to the lake. of 3000 stadia
(reduced by Linant to 360) or about 335 M. (Pliny says 23011.), and upon
measurements made by himself on the spot, aseribes a considerably larger
area to the lake than Linant, and maintains that it extended on the SAY.
to the ll’ddz‘ Rayon. It is not improbable that in ancient times nearly the
whole of the Faylim could be laid under water, so that even the Birket
el-Kurt‘m belonged to Lake Mceris, but that the entire system was meant
for the watering of the Faydm alone and not of the Nile valley or the
Delta. Considering that the bed of the lake must annually have been raised
by the deposit of Nile mud, it follows, that as soon as the raising of the
embankments and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become nnserviceable, especially after the lock-gates at el-
Laliﬁn fell to decay, each opening of which, as Diodorus informs us,
cost 50 talents [i.e. about 11.250131). The discharge of the superﬂuous
water probably ran through the Babr Bela lift, which has already been
mentioned (p. 400}. or through the \Vadi Nezleh (p. 464), both of which
fall into the Birket el-Kurﬁn. The ancient conjecture, that the latter
discharged part of its water into the ﬁahara (or, as Herodotus says, the
‘Libyan Syrte‘). was not an unnatural one.

A visit to the Pyramid of el-Lahun or Illahnn is only interesting to
those who are desirous of convincing themselves of the truth of Liuant‘s
hypothesis, and to make the circuit of the boundaries of the old bed of
the lake tsce above]. The pyramid, which is built of Nile bricks, may he
reached from Hawdret el-Kasab in 4-5, or from the Labyrinth in 3-4 hours.
It has been recently been opened by Fraser. The discovery of an ala<
baster altar with the name of Usertesen ll. renders it probable that the
pyramid was built by that monarch. A smaller pyramid lies to the NE.
The remains of the ancient embankments. which were tolerably well
preserved in the time of the Klialifs, are not without attraction. Those
who are interested in hydraulic engineering should also inspect the en-
trance of the Bahr Yﬁsuf into the Fayum.

About V2 M. to the E. of the pyramid of el-Lalidn, Mr. Flinders Pe-
trie discovered a temple in 1389. and close beside it the ruins ofthe town
IIa-Usertesen-hotep, now called Kahun. The latter was founded by User—
tesen 11 (12th Dyn.) for the labourers on his pyramid. Among the articles
found here were pottery, ﬂint and copper implements of the 12th Dyn.,
numerous papyri of the same period, a. statuette of Si-Sebek (13th Dyn.),
a wooden stamp of Apepi, and a large wooden door of Osorkon I.

Gurab, I‘Iz M. to the \V.S.\V. of Illaln‘m and close to the edge of the
desert, owod its origin to Tntmcs 111., who built a temple there. Many
of the inhabitants were foreigners. Mr. Petrie discovered here fragments
of pottery of the time of Tutankhamon and Ramses 11., resembling the
most ancient potsherds found at )lycenae. The cofﬁn of Amentursha,
discovered here. is now at Oxford. The pottery bears Egyptian stamps,
but also letters of the Cypi-ian,_Phcenician, and other alphabets.
