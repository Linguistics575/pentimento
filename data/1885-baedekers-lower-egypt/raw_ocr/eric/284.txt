254 Route 3. CAIRO. Bazaars.

Fahhami (literally, coal-market; P]. D, ‘2), the bazaar for wares
from Tunis and Algiers. We. ﬁrst observe drug-stalls, and then
magazines of light-coloured woollen and other stuffs, which, how-
ever, are imported from Nimes and other places in Southern France,
being now seldom or never manufactured at Tunis.

Pursuing the same direction, parallel with the lCl-Ghﬁriyeh
street, and passing a number of shoemakers’ stalls [bawabishiL we
come to a broader covered passage (exactly opposite which is a
modern okella, presenting no attraction), which we follow to the right
for a few paces. and then take the ﬁrst lane to the left. At the end
of this lane lies a more open spot where undressed wool is exposed
for sale. Lower down, a little to the left, we reach the Sukkariych,
or bazaar for sugary dried fruits (nulsl), and similar wares. Adjoin-
ing it is the (himi' el-Jluuiyud [‘p. 272'), now undergoing restora-
tion, while facing us, at the end of the street, rises the. handsome
B471; ez-Zuwé‘lch [see p. 279), or .llutuwelli. Opposite the outside
of the gate is a house with a large grated window, and in the cor-
ner is a column built into the wall, at which executions by stran-
gulation formerly tool; place. In a straight direction we next enter
the Shoemakers’ Bazaar, formerly a school, an interesting building,
the ﬁrst story of which overhangs the lower and is borne by large
brackets. The. large gateway (on the right) is still preserved; part
of the interior has been altered, while the. rest of it is in a dilapid-
ated condition. — The same street then passes the stalls of the tent
and ﬂag-makers, and leads to the Boulseurd Mohammcd‘xlli (p. ‘260),
at the W. end of which are the mosques of Sultan l_lasan (p, 960)
and Rifa'iyeh (p. 9.60), the latter being still unlinished. ()n the
left, before this last is reached, is the entrance to the once cel-
ebrated Sﬁljr es-Sellaha. (Pl. E, ‘2), or bazaar of the arlnourers, now
reduced to three or four miserable stalls, where European weapons
are sold. Keeping to the left, we traverse several crooked lanes
and reach the Sebil Mohammed‘Ali (see below) in the Ghnriyeh
street. This last digression, however, is uninteresting.

\Ve return from the Shoemakers’ Bazaar to the Bab ez-Zuwcleh,
before reaching which we pass the unattractive Saddlers’ Bazaar
(Stilt cs-Surﬁgiych), and a police-ofﬁce at the corner to the, right.
We now follow a broader street, the ﬁrst part of which is called
the Sukltariyeh (see. above). leyond the Sebil Mohammed ’Ali this
street is named El—Ghﬁriyeh from the mosque erected by suns.“
I'll—Ulluri (p. 274), the small minaret of which, with its domes,
rises nearly in the middle 01' the street.

We follow this street in a straight direction nearly as far as the
post of the (lower) sentry on the left, a little before reaching whom
we turn to the right into the Stir es-Sudém, or bazaar for Wares
from the Sﬁdan, consisting of chests, gum , dI‘un-palnl nuts, ill-
lanned tiger skins, etc. [see p. 236). Farther on, in a straight
din-I'tinn, are the stalls of the Booksellers and Bookbinders.
