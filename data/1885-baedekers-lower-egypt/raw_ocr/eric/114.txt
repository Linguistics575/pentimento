HISTORY.

 

of the llihle), prince of Sais, became the most prominent.
Al‘ter l‘lsarhaddon‘s death 'l‘aharka endeavoured to shake off
the. Assyrian yoke, but was defeated and driven out of Egypt
hy zlssurbunipul (Surdanupalus), Esarhaddons son and Sue-
(-esser. 'l‘he vassal princes assisted 'l‘aharka, but were par-
doned hy Assurhanipal and reinstated in their provinces on
a solemn vow of l‘nture obedience.

Nut-Amen (Assyr. l‘rrdrmumi) captured Memphis and won
hack the whole of Lower Egypt, hut was in his turn defeated
hy Rardanapalns, who again invaded Egypt.

After the departure of the Assyrians and the decline of
their power under the successors of Sardanapalus, the petty
Egyptian princes attained complete independence and es-
tablished the so-called ‘Dodekarehy’. An end. however, was
put to this by l’mmmctilth. son ot'Nehho, and prince of Sa'is
and Memphis, with the aid of Ionian and Marian mercen-

‘aries. As the nephew (by marriage) of Shahako (p. 9,.)

l’sammetikh was the legitimate heir of the Ethiopian dy-
nasty, and he accordingly ascended the throne of Egypt and
founded the. ——

XXVI. DYNASTY (Suites; pp. 163, 4‘37, Mli].

Psammetikh I. ( Egypt. I’semtek, Gr. Pmmmelichus; p. 385‘),
in order to consolidate his empire, assigned dwellings to the
Greek mercenaries in the fertile region of Ruhastis, and fa—
voured foreigners in many ways. The warrior caste of Egypt,
highly oﬂ‘ended at this proceeding, emigrated to Ethiopia,
and there founded the kingdom of the Semhrides. Proﬁting
hy the decline of the power of Assyria, Psammetikh made,
war against the wealthy l’hlenieian seaports, but was stoutly
opposed by the l'hilistines.

Nekho ((Erk. Nachos, Egypt. Nekau; p. -l'27), the son of
l’sammetikh, was more eoneerned for the domestiu welfare
of the country than for military glory. During his reign the
5‘. extremity of Afrira was eiremnnavigated for the ﬁrst time
(Herod. iv. 4'3). Nekho began to uonstrnet a canal from the,
Vile to the lied Sea. hut discontinued the work on lining
informed by an oracle that it would only henetlt ‘strangers.’
Hearing of the eampaign of the Modes and llaliylonians
against the Assyrians. he also marched against Assyria, and
defeated Josiah, King ot'Jndah, the ally ol‘ the Assyrians, who
Opposed him at ,hlegiddo. Meanwhile, however, Nineveh had
fallen, and the Assyrian empire been divided by UyaVares,
King of Media, and Nahopolassar, king of liahylon; and
Neltho's farther progress was arrested lvy Nehuehadnezzar,
King oi‘ltaliylnn and son ol’Nahopolassar, who defeated him
at liarkemish li‘ireesinm). Nekho thus lost his possessions
in Syria and Palestine.
