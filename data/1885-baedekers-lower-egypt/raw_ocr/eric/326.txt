292 Route 3. CAIRO. Grimi' el-Ilasanén. I

U11 the right and left of the WV. Entrance (Pl. :1) are two old
mosques. The Medreseh of Emir Taibur (Pl. 10), 011 the S. side,
built in 1309, contains a hibla richly adorned with mosaic. The
mosque 011 the N. side (Pl. it) is new in ruins, as indeed are sev-
eral other parts of the mosque of El-Azhar (‘the ﬂourishing’).

Returning to the Rue Neuvc, we observe to the N. , opposite
us, the handsome minaret of the —

“'Gami' el- Hasanén (PI. 46; C, ‘2), the mesque of llasan and
Husén, the sons of \li, the son-in-law of the prophet (p. 153;
the termination 311 indicating the dual), which has recently been
restored. The interior is constructed with considerable symmetry
and care. The wooden ceiling, from which hang a number of lamps,
is painted. A marble column is said to contain the head of Husén,
who was slain at Kerbela by Shemir lbn el—Ganshan by order of
Yezid. The head is said to have been brought to Cairo in a green
silk ha". This tomb-mosque is chieﬂy frequented by 111011 011
Thursdays, and by women on Saturdays.+

~1- ‘The visitors to the tombs, burial—mosques, and \velis, which are to
he found near almost every village, generally have a twofold object in
View, one being to do honour to the memory of the deceased and to
invoke the blessing ofheaven upon them, and the other to obtain through
their mediation the fulfilment of some Special wish. ()11 arriving at the
tomb, the visitor must turn towards the face of the deceased and
pronounce the greeting of peace. He then walks round the mak.,_»'121'(( or
monument, from left to right repeating the fatha at the door, or at each
of the four sides, in a very low voice. A suroh ofthe Koran is sometimes
also repeated, and even the khatmeh, or recitation of the whole volume,
is not nnfrequeutly performed. In conclusion the praises of God and
the prophet are usually recited, coupled with a prayer that the merit
of the whole performance may he placed to the credit of the wcli‘s
soul. Before the concluding prayer, the worshipper sometimes introduces
a prayer for his own temporal and spiritual welfare. \thn wealthy
persons visit the tomb of a saint, they distribute bread among the poor,
and pay one sakka or more to dispense uatcr gratuitously Some of the
tombs are chieﬂy visited on certain days oi the week- and there are
certain days of the year [especially abolit the middle of the month of
Sha'ban) on which festivals are celebrated in honour of the patron saints
of the ditlcrcnt towns and villages. 'lho most important of these are
that of Heyyid Ahmed cl- llcrlaWi at Tanta in Lower ligypt, and that of
Abd cr-Rahim at Kt'llﬂll in Upper Egypt. A week or 11 fortnight before
the day of the festival, booths for the sale of collce and swealmeats beWin
to sprin" up around the shrine, and crowds of devotees ﬂock to the tomb
from all directions, some of them to perform the zikr, and others to
take part in various fantasiyas. Dancing women, singers, musicians,
jugglers, snake-channers, bull‘oous, as well as swings and merry-go-romuls,
present their various attractions to young and old. (In the feast-day
itself, when the crowd is greatest, a solemn procession takes place. The

tombi is covered with the gold and silver—embroidered winding-sheet of
