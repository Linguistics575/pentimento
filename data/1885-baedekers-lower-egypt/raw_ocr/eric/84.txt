This barrier extends eastwards for about 130 miles, forming a very ir-
regular chain of barren hills 900-1300 ft. in height.

The Nile has forced a passage for itself through this hard rock, ex-
posing to view at places the beautiful red felspar crystals which it con-
tains, and forms a wild cataract at; Assuﬁn. Near the cataracts are the
deserted quarries of the ancient Egyptians, where to this day we still
observe a number of unﬁnished gigantic obelisks, and columns half hewn
out of the solid rock.

(‘2) Tan Animus Desnnr. Parallel with the coast of the Iled Sea, a
broad and massive range of mountains, consisting of crystalline rocks
(granite, syenite, diorite, porphyry, hornblende slate. gneiss, mica-slate,
etc._)._ runs through the Arabian Desert, sending forth numerous ramiti-
cations into the interior of the country. At Hammﬁmit, on the caravan-
routc from lfosér to Thebes, we pass the quarries whence the dark-
coloured stone tapllanite, diorite, and vcrde antico) used for the ancient
sarcophagi and sphinxes was obtained by the Egyptian sculptors. Near
the Red Sea, almost opposite the southern extremity of the peninsula of
Sinai, rises the Gebel Dukhan, which yielded the beautiful red porphyry
[porlido rosso] so highly prized by the Greeks and Romans at a later
period, and used by them for vases, columns, sarcophagi, busts, and
mosaics. The granite quarries of the Gebel Fatireh yielded both building
stone and copper. Most celebrated of all, however, were the emerald mines
of the Gebcl Zebﬁra, situated on the Red Sea in the latitude of Selseleh.

This extensive range of mountains of crystalline formation, rising to
a height of UGUU it, of which those of the peninsula of Sinai form a
counterpart, terminates towards the east in roof-shaped. stratiﬁed for-
mations. At lirst there occurs a considerable stratum of Nubian sandstone,
next to which we find a series of clayey and calcareous strata, identiﬁed
by Figari-ch with the Triassic and Jura formations, probably errone-
ously, as the collection of specimens of the rock at lorence shows that
apparently the chalk alone is completely developed. These strata are
succeeded by extensive masses of limestone, belonging to tho nummulite
formation, and stretching to the Nile. Among these last formations is
found the pale yellow, brownish, and snow-white alabaster, a kind of
limestone composed of nodulous masses, which was formerly quarried at
the ancient Alabastron near Siut, and still occurs on the Gebel Urakam
near Beni-SuC-f. In the reign of Mohammed ‘.—\li this alabaster was largely
used in the construction of his alabaster mosque (p. 263), and it was ex-
tensively exported in ancient times for the embellishment of buildings
and for sculptural purposes. Blocks of it are even found among the
ruins of the Oasis of Ammon.

Those extensive mountains, with their numerous profound ravines
and boldly shaped masses of rock, impart a most imposing character to
the Arabian Desert. This region is by no means so destitute of vege-
tation as is usually supposed; for, although without oases, it. contains,
particularly in the N. part. a number of springs and natural cisterns,
which are ﬁlled by the rare, but often copious, rains of winter.

Iii). Till-l LIBYAN DESERT. This region again presents an entirely dif-
ferent character. It consists of an immense, monotonous. and stony table-
land, (5130400011. above the level of the Nile, extending between the Nile
and the oases ol‘ Khargch, Dﬁkhel, Farafra, and liahrl‘yeh. Throughout
this vast area there occur neither mountains, nor valleys, nor even iso-
lated bills of any considerable height; and there is no trace of crystal—
line or volcanic formations. The surface of the desert rises in gradations,
cach preccdcd by a broad girdle of isolated mounds, which have been
obviously formed by erosion, the materials having been washed down
from the adjoining plateau. The whole of this stony and absolutely un-
watercd plain, the monotony of which is only varied by a few solitary
ranges of sand—hills, consists of nummulite limestone. In the direction
of the cases it descends in precipitous slopes, furrowed with numerous
ravines, and occasionally nearly 1000 ft. in height. The ditfcrent strata
of the earlier nummulite formation, as well as those of the upper chalk,
are here exposed to View, and generally contain numerous fossils. The l
