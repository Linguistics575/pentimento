fill GEOGRAPHICAL .YO'l'lCE. Frontiers.

The boundaries of Egypt in a due S. direction were still more
boldly extended by lsma'il. They now comprise the whole course
of the White Nile and the greater part of the river region of the
Ruhr cl-(ilmzdl, where merchants from Khartnm had already for
many years possessed settlements and by force of arms had sub—
dued the negro tribes. At the time ofMohammed rAli’s death the S.
boundary of the Egyptian dominions on the White lVile was formed
by the corn-magazines of Et-‘Esh and the wharves near it, situated
about 13“ N. latitude, while it now extends to the military station
of lv'auira (on the river connecting the Victoria and the Albert
Nyanza), situated about 2°C. latitude, so that the whole length of
the empire is now about r2000 English miles. The S. frontier, from
Dar—Fur to Berbera, a distance of 1560 M., now almost entirely
surrounds the kingdom of Abyssinia.

Down to 1853 the whole of the vast territory within these boun—
daries was, nominally at least, immediately subject to the lihedive,
though but sparsely occupied by his comparatively small army, and
it contained no tributary peoples mediately subject to him. These
enormous tracts, on the other hand, are utterly disproportionate to
the population, the desert regions are immeasurably more extensive
than the fertile districts, and the barbarous and unproﬁtable in-
habitants far more numerous than the civilised and wealth—pro-
ducing. The geographer and the political economist therefore would
vary widely in their description of the. real boundaries of the
country. The country which (until the most recent events] owned
no other master than the Khedive or his representatives is ofim-
meuse extent. but the cultivable part of Egypt, which forms the
sole source of its wealth, is of very limited area. The extensive
dominious of the lx'hedivc which lie to the S. of Egypt proper are
still entirely protitless, and hence it was that Isma'il did his utmost
to extend the. commerce in this direction, and to improve the means
of communication.

Thus while Egypt is nominally as extensive as two—thirds of
Russia in Europe, it shrinks to the size of Belgium when the Val-
.‘ey of the Nile, its only productive part, inhabited by a tax-paying
population, is alone taken into consideration. The total area of the
empire is fully one and a quarter million square miles, including
that part of the Libyan Desert which falls within the western
boundary drawn from the oasis of Siwa to the west end of bill'-
lt‘l‘rr, and which alone measures 525,000 sq. M. in extent. 0n the
other hand Egypt proper, extending towards the desert so far only
as it is irrigated by the t'ertilising Nile, the ‘BILAn Maisn‘ [the Mipmim
of the Ilible'), though 550 Ill. in length, is the narrowest country in
the world. The. area ofthis cultivable tract, which has remained
unaltered since the remotcst antiquity, is about "11,342 sq. M. only
(or 21511. M. less than Belgium], excluding Wzltli l_ialfa and the other
districts above Assuan. In 1882 Amiei lley calculated the entire in—
