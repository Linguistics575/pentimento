lo Pm Su'id. THE SUEZ CANAL. 7. Route. 431

Besides the Canal the company also possesses considerable tracts
of land.

The opening of the Suez Canal was inaugurated 011 16th Nov.
1869, and the magniﬁcent festivities which took place on the occa-
sion are said to have cost the Khedive no less than 4,200,0001.

The great mercantile importance of the Canal is apparent from the
following data. The distance from London tO‘Bnmhay viii. the Cape of
Good Hope is 12,518 English miles, and via the Suez Canal 7028 M. only.
The saving thus effected is 41 per cent of the distance. From Hamburg

The trafﬁc” on the Canal is rapidly increasing, as appears from the
following statistics. and many vessels (not exceeding 125 ft. in length)
pass through it at regular intervals.

rian 67,11alian 63, Spanish 31 Russian 18 and there were also a number
of vessels of other nationalities. The number of passengers on board
these vessels was abnut 115, 000.
The net receipts are also steadily increasing. —

The fact that the increase in the receipts of the last few years has
not kept pace with that of the tonnage of the vessels is explained by the
reduction of the taritl‘.

PASSAGE 01‘ THE SUEZ CANAL. The entrance to the Canal from
the Gulf of Suez is not at the N. extremity of the gulf, but much
farther to the S., and is approached by a navigable channel in the
