oilered fer sale. A large crab, known as the binl umm er—rubbdn, which
is caught on the shore by moonlight Without difﬁculty, is esteemed a
delicacy. The tortnise-shell yielded by the loggerhead turtle, and the
thick skin of the gild, or dugong (Helical-e cetacea), form considerable
articles of commerce. According to some authorities the Jewish ark of
the covenant was covered with dngong leather.

HISTORY or SUEZ Little is known regarding the ancient history of
Suez. A town mentioned for the ﬁrst time by Lucian under the name
of K‘lysma, or K‘let’sma, seems to have occupied this site at. a very early
period. It was a fortiﬁed place, and the special task of the garrison
was to protect and maintain the old isthmus-canal completed by Darius
(p. 427). Ptolemwns calls the place Clysma Pj'acsz‘dium. but places it
much farther to the S. During the supremacy of the Arabians, who ro-
opened the old canal for a short time (p. QB), the town was named
Kolzum or Katzim. After the 8th cent. it seems to have sunk into
insigniﬁcance, but it is mentioned by Ahdulﬁda as the starting-point for
Tur (p. 515). — The chief historical interest attaching to the place lies
in the fact that it is usually supposed to he close to the point where the
Israelites crossed the Red Sea (comp. pp. 419, 483).

Suez, a town with 11,170 inhab., lies at the head of the gulf
of that name, one of the N. extremities of the Red Sea, and to
the S.W. of the mouth of the Suez Canal. 0n the W. it is com-
manded by the picturesque blue heights of the ‘Atﬁka 31155., and
on the E. by hills belonging to the Asiatic coast range. Before the
construction of the great work of M. de Lesseps, Suez was a miscr-
able Arabian village, with 1500 inhab. at most.

“The place‘, says Dr. Schweint‘urth in 1864, *still consists of confused
groups of miserable mud hovels, and ruinous, half-European buildings of
lath and plaster. On the quay rises the one»storied block of the English
hotel, in front of which are the iron railway shed, a few warehouses,
and the consulates of the western powers. Such is the poverty»stricken
appearance of the town, Where moreover a deathlike stillness prevails,
notwithstanding the fact that three different quarters of the globe join
hands over its walls. Not a tree, not a spring, not even the meagre
saltwort, or a trace of vegetation of any kind. is to be seen on the
extensive and ﬂat coast or anywhere in the environs of the town. The
blue of the sky and the sea, where half-a-dozen steamers and afew sail-
ing vessels are lying at anchor. ail‘ords the only relief to the eye of the
spectator.‘

To this day the town presents a very dreary appearance, and
its trade has again greatly fallen off, the stimulus given to it by
the opening of the canal and the large docks having apparently
been transient. Neither the Arabian quarter with its seven insigniﬁ-
cant mosques, nor the streets of the European quarter, which con-
tain several buildings and warehouses of considerable size, present
any attraction. The Arabian bazaar is unimportant, but at the
entrance to it are stalls of beautiful shells and coral from the Red
Sea, for which exorbitant prices are asked (comp. p. 416]. Near
the Suez Hotel are several stalls where Chinese articles are sold.

On a mound of debris to the N. of the towny not far from the
station and the magazines of the ‘Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company’, is a kiosque of the Khedive, commanding a
ﬁne view of the mountains of the peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the
harbour, and the town. The hill is called by the Arabs Kom el-’Ol—
zum, and was probably the site of the ancient Kolzum [see above).
