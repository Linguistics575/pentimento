in advance to cut 011’ this bend and open communication
with Klrurtfnn from Shendy, while the main body continued
its laborious ascent of the Nile. The advanced brigade under
General Stewart accomplished its march across the Buyﬁda
Dese‘rl (see Map, p. 30) with complete successI gaining
severely contested victories over large bodies of the )lahdi‘s
followers at Alu‘l Klee (Jan. 17th) and at a point near Ille-
temmeh (Jan. 19th). Stewart, however7 was mortally wound-
ed at the latter engagement. The British reached the Nile
at Gubul, just above Metemmeh, on the evening of Jan.
i‘Jth, and on Jan. r24th a small body of men under Sir Chas.
\Vihon set out for Khartr‘rm in two steamboats which Gordon
had sent to meet them. Sir Charles reached Khartﬁm on the
r28th, but found that it had already fallen on the 26th, ap-
parently through treachery, and that Gordon was either dead
or in the hands of the Mahdi. Upon the news of the fall of
lihartl‘rm the llritish government, after consultation with
General Wolseley, decided that it was necessary to arrest the
progress of the Mahdi, and determined to dispatch reinforce-
ments of 10,000 men to Souakin, to eo-Operate with Wolseley
from that base. The construction of a railway from Souakin
to Berber was also resolved upon. At the time the Hand-
hook went to press the plan of Wolseley’s farther operations
was not deﬁnitely known; but the loss of Khartdm and the
approach of the hot season had greatly complicated his
task, and the advanced brigade had been recalled to join
the main body. Though an absolutely trustworthy amount
of the fate of General Gordon has not yet been received,
there is almost no room to doubt that he perished at the
capture of Khartum.

 

IV. Hieroglyphics.
Jig Professor 6’. libel-5 of Lcipsic.

The ancient Egyptians used three kinds of writing, the
Hieroglyphic, the Ilicmlic, and the Demotic, to which, within the
Christian era, was added the Coptic. The first and earliest is the
pure Hieroglyphic writing, which consists of ﬁgures of material ob-
jects from every sphere of nature and art, together with certain

mathematical and arbitrary symbols. Thus owl, hsnail,
axe, U square, ‘! senti. This is the monumental writing,

which is nftr-uer found engraved on stone than written with a
pen. For the speedier execution of long records the Egyptians next

developed the llirzrutic writing, in which the owl (3, i. c. .3

almost ceases to ho recognisahlo, and in which we possess literary
