318 Route 4. ISLAND or nénA.

Fumrn el-Khalig, or inﬂux of the city canal into an arm of the
Nile, which, however, is dry from May until the period of the over—
ﬂow. The festivities connected with the cutting of the Nile em-
bankment take place here in August. The straw-market is bounded
on the S. by the Old Aqueduct of the Citadel, which has been dis-
used since the completion of the steam—pump in 1879..

The Head of this conduit, separated by a street from the arm of the
Nile just named. is constructed of solid masonry in a hexagonal form,
and consists of three stories, about 150 ft. in diameter. The ground-floor
contains stables and magazines, and on the ﬁrst and second is accommo-
dation for about 130 Soldiers. ()n the terrace, where there are six water-
wheels [sitlgiyehsh each Worked by two oxen, is a large hexagonal basin
from which thc water ﬂowed into the aqueduct. (in the platform there- are
also stables for the oxen and chambers for the attendants. The aqueduct,
constructed of massive blocks of stone, and resting (in pointed arches, as-
cends in four ditl‘erent levels to the citadel, the total height being 27811.,
and the total length 110003115. (21/4 AL). When the Nile was at its lowest,
the water had to he raised to a height of 80 ft. to the ﬁrst basin. A
branch of this conduit supplied the Jewish quarter with water in the
neighbour-howl of lmftm Shafc'i tp. 327). The aqueduct dates from the
time of Saladiu (12th cent.; 1). 1262). The entrance is in the N. wall, at the
back of the head of the aqueduct, where a Berber is posted as a custodian
(fee 1/1 fr. for each person). Views from the openings of the platform,
very ﬁne. Easy ascent by an inclined plane.

Towards the left, a few hundred yards from the gate of the head
of the aqueduct are situated the Christian Cemeteries, surrounded
by lofty walls. The ﬁrst is the English Cemetery, the second the
Roman Catholic, beyond which are those of the Greeks, Armenians,
and Copts, which present no attraction.

Leaving the head of the aqueduct, we follow the direction of
the arm of the Nile, which, however, is not always visible, as the
houses and walls of the Munjul quarter interpose between the
road and the water, and reach (ll/‘4 M.) the mansion which form-
erly belonged to Sulénu‘m l’usha el—I'lrunsdwi [Colonel Selves), with
two ﬁne Arabian portals (visitors not admitted]. The second nar-
row and short road to the right beyond the cltfrteau leads to the
ferry crossing to the Island of Roda. We descend the slope, enter
the ferry—boat (1,4 fr. for one person, there and back; for a party
more in proportion; payment made on returning), ascend the op-
posite path, and turn to the right. A young gardener is usually
in waiting at the landing—place to conduct travellers thrOngh the
intricate lanes to the garden. At the S. extremity of the island
is the Nilometer (illilcyﬂs), situated on land belonging to the heirs
of (lawn Pasha. The garden, laid out in the Arabian style, is mi-
serably neglected. The paths are paved with a kind of mosaic of
round pebbles, obtained partly from the desert, and partly from
the island of Rhodes, and the most important of them are her—
dt-rcd with low walls, supporting wooden verandahs and arhours,
over which climb immense vines. The gardens contain orange
and lemon trees, dates, palms, and bananas, and also the henna
plant, which is not met with in the public gardens of Cairo.
