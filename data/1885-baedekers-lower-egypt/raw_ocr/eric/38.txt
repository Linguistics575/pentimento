(water-pipes) are kept in readiness for the use of customers. The
(um/It‘ll.- (p. 27) smoked in the latter is sometimes mixed with the
intoxicating hashish Lhemp, Cannabis ludica), the strong and un-
mistakeable smell of which is often perceptible even in the street.

The sale of hashish is now nominally prohibited in Egypt.

“the leavos and capsules of hemp, called in Egypt stheesh, were
employed in some countries of the East in very ancient times to induce
an exhilarating intoxication. llerodotus (iv. 75] informs us that the
ﬁt-ythians had a custom of bunting the seeds of this plant in religious
Ct'l‘cllltulit's, and that they became intoxicated with the fumes. Galen
also mentions the intoxicating properties of hemp. The practice of
chewing the leaves of this plant to induce intoxication prevailed, or
existed, in india in very early ages; thence it was introduced into Persia;
and about six centuries ago (before the middle of the thirteenth century I
of our era) this pernicious and degrading custom was adopted in Egypt,
but chietly by persons of the lowerorders. . . . The preparation of hemp '
used for smoking produces boisterous mirth. Few inhalations of the
smoke, but the last very copious, are usually taken from the gozeh. After
the emission of the last draught from the mouth and nostrils, commonly
a tit of coughing, and often a spitting of blood, ensues, in consequence
of the lungs having been ﬁlled with the smoke. I‘lasheesh is to be
obtained not only at some of the coffee-shops: there are shops ofa smaller
and more private description solely appropriated to the sale of this and
other intoxicating preparations: they are called multsheshehs. It is sonic-
timer. amusing to observe the ridiculous conduct, and to listen to the
conversation, of the persons who frequent these shops. They are all of
the lower orders. The tern] sthsluiy‘k, which signitics a smoker, or an
rater, of hemp, is an appellation ot' obloquy: noisy and riotous people
are often called lutsltshrisheen. which is the plural of that appellation, and '
the. oriein of our word assassin; a name ﬁrst applied to Arab warriors in
Syria, in the time of the Crusades, who made use of intoxicating and
solioriﬁc drugs to render their enemies insensihle‘.

"l‘he use of opium and other drugs to induce intoxication is not so
common in Egypt as in many other countries of the East: the number of
l-Zvyptians addicted to this vice is certainly not, nearly so great in pro-
portion to the whole population as is the relative number of persons in
our own country who indulge in habitual drunkenness‘. . ..

"BoGZth or booed/t, which is an intoxicating liquor made with barley-
bread, crumbled, mixed with water, strained, and left to ferment, is
counmmly drunk by the boatmen of the Nile, and by other persons of
the lowrr orders‘. — LANE (1833-35).

Numerous taverns now exist exclusively for the sale of bﬁzeh, kept I
chit-Hy by Nubiuns. It is usually dispensed immediately from a large
boiler wilh a. wooden ladle, which is passed from mouth to mouth, the
customers being1 of both sexes. The liquor is intoxicating in a. very
slight decree.

Many of the haltwas are frequented, especially on the eves of l
fUStll'als IP- 236), by story-tellers and musicians. The performances
range trom those ofa very simple character to gorgeous cntertaiu— I
mt‘nts wrth dancing, music, and ﬁreworks; and these ‘fantasiyas’,
as they are called by the modern Arabs, afford unbounded delight.
