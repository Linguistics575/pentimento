dria, and partly from the Petriﬁed Forest (1). 337). The pebbles
were imported from the island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean, and
the coral and shells from the lied Sea.

the centre of the garden is the long *Kiosque, probably the ﬁnest
modern Arabian structure of the kind. The ornamentation, in cast
iron, is in the Alhambra style. The plan of the building is slightly
irregular, as several apartments of an older kiosque have been in-
corporated with it. The handsome hall and the fountain were
executed at the Lauchhammer foundry near Dresden; they weighed
400 tons, and the cost of transport alone amounted to upwards of
2000i. ; the hall itself, exclusive of the expense of its erection and
decoration, cost 80001. On the E. side of the kiosque are the recep—
tion chambers, and on the \V. side the private apartments of the
Ix'hedive, consisting of an ante-chamber [1']. f, g), a small [P]. i)
and a large dining-room (Pl. k), a smoking-room (Pl. h), chambers

for reading, resting, and bathing, and a store-room for plate.

in their styles. Furniture French and English.

The Shubra Avenue.

About ill/2 M. to the N. of Cairo lies the village of Shubm, on
the Nile, where a spacious garden and kiosque of Mohammed rAli,
now neglected, are situated (permission to visit them obtained
through the consulate]. The broad *Shubra Avenue leading thither
is composed of beautiful sycamores and lebbek trees (erroneously
called Nile acacias; p. 76). This avenue forms the Rotten llow, or
Avenue de lloulogne, of Cairo. The fashionables of the town, both
Mohammedan and Christian, drive or ride here daily, but principally
on Friday and Sunday evenings. The scene resembles the ‘corso’
of European cities, but is rendered far more picturesque by its
(lriental elements. The carriages of the slightly veiled ladies from
the harems of the wealthy, and those of the ministers, the consuls,
and the merchants, follow each otherin gay procession, while the
ubiquitous donkey forms a conspicuous feature in the busy throng.
