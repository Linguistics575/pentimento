Mosque el—Azhur. CAIRO. 3. Route. 289

Most of the students, particularly those whose native tongue is not
Arabic, begin their university education by learning the Arabic grammar
('vilm can-71112121). The next branch of study is religious science ('t'lm et-
kelam), the introduction to which consists of a series of preparatory lec—
tures on the attributes of God and the prophet [Wm 81- -taulnd, i. e. the
doctrine of the unity of God}. The chief attributes of God are said
to he the following twelve: existence, source of all being, eternity, in-
dependence, unity, omnipotence, will (in accordance with which he rules
the universe, man being powerless to save himself from sin or to he
pious without the assistance and grace of God), omniscience (or know-
ledge of everything that happens between the lowest foundations of the
earth and the loftiest heights of the ﬁrmament), life, vision [which enables
him to see everything everywhere, without the aid oflight, and without
eyes), hearing [without ears, in the same way as he knows without a
brain, and overthrows without hands], and speech [in a language that has
had. no beginning, alanguage without‘letters or sounds, which is inherent
in his natnre, and does not resemble human speech).

After having completed his course of religious instruction, the student
proceeds to study law (‘ilm el-ﬁlrh).

‘Jurisprudenee‘, says Ibn lihalddn, one of the greatest of Arabian
thinkers, ‘is a knowledge of the precepts of God in relation to the actions
of men, some of which it is our duty to perform, while others are for-
bidden, or recommended, or permitted; and this knowledge is derived
from the book of God, 27.8. the Koran, from the Sunna (tie. tradition),
and from the inferences drawn by the law giver (Mohammed) from Suﬁ
ﬁcient materials afforded by the lxoran‘. The study of law is therefore
based upon the exegesis of the Koriin (tafsil') and of tradition (Zladith).

The science of law is divided into two branches: —

(1) The doctrine of the Chief Religious Commandments of El- -l'sl:"11n,
viz. (a) El Taulu‘d, or the recognition of God 5 unity and of lllohammed
as his prophet- (b) The tﬁ‘atrit and Tahrlrrt, or the duty of repeating the
canonical prayers in connection with the ablutions; (c) The Sadalra and
Zal-cil, or giving of alnis and payment of a religious tax- (d) The Sig/tint,
or fasting during the month of Ramadan- (e) The (Iago, or duty of per-
forming a pilgrimage to Mecca.

(2] The doctrine of Secular Law, civil and criminal, either as expressly
laid down by the Koran, or as deducible from it. The legal literature
again is divided into two classes, one embracing systematic expositions
of the law of the Koran and the other consisting of the decisions (fctwa)
and opinions of celebrated jurists in special and difﬁcult cases.

Besides these leading branches of instruction, logic (ﬁlm (51- -mmt§z'lt')
rhetoric (“ﬁlm el- mind/21' wul baydn), the art of poetry (‘z'lm el- -‘a:'1td), the
proper mode of reciting the Koian (‘itm el- k d a), and the correct pro—
nunciation of the letters (‘t'lm et- lejwid) are also taught.‘

The above list of the subjects taught at the most important of Moham—
medan schools will serve to convey an idea of the intellectual condition
of Orientals at the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
culture consists in the entire absence of independent thought, in conse-
quence of which they are the mere recipients of the knowledge of the
past. Their minds are thus exclusively occupied with the lowest grade
of intellectual work, their principal task consisting in the systematic
arrangement or encycloptedic compilation ot' the knowledge handed dowu
to them. Some of the shekhs of the Azhar are men of marvellous erudi-
tion, but they are destitute of creative power, or of the ability to utilise
their old materials for the construction of any new ediﬁce, and they ad-
here faithfully to the notion of their forefathers that the greatest
triumph of mental labour is to learn by heart any work of acknowledged
literary value. Doubt and criticism, which so often serve to open up fresh
sources of knowledge, are unknown to them; with natural history they
are entirely nnacquainted; and even geometry, algebra, and astronomy, so
assiduously cultivated by the ancient Arabs, have now fallen into ob-
livion. So well satisﬁed are they, moreover, with their own wisdom,
that they utterly despise the scientiﬁc pursuits of the \Vestern world.
