the pilgrims now perform the greater part of the distance. by water.
On approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside even
their headgear, and put on aprons and a piece of cloth over the
left shoulder. They then perform the circuit of the Ka’ba, kiss
the black stone, hear the sermon on Mt. rArafat near Mecca, pelt
Satan with stones in the valley of Mina, and conclude their pil-
grimage with a great sacriﬁcial feast. 0n the day when this takes
place at Mecca, sheep are slaughtered and a festival called the Great
Beiram (cl-'2d el-kebir)observed throughout the Whole of the Moham—
medan countries. [The ‘Lesser Beiram’, Arab. el—‘Ed es—suglmyyir,
follows Ramadan.) The month of the pilgrimage is called Dhul—
higgeh (that ‘ofthe pilgrimage’). and forms the close of the Muslim
year. For an account of the feast in connection with the pilgrim—

era into one of the Muslim era, subtract 6'22, divide the remainder
by 33, and add the quotient to the dividend. Conversely, a year
of the Mohammedan: era is converted into one of the Christian era
by dividing it by 33, subtracting the quotient from it, and adding
622 to the remainder. On let October, 1884, began the Muslim
year 1302. The Gregorian calendar has recently been introduced
into Egypt, but is used by government in the ﬁnance department

Most of the Arabic LITERATURE is connected with the Koran.
Commentaries were written at an early period to explain the ob—
scure passages in it, and there gradually sprang up a series of ex—
egetical writings dwelling with elaborate minuteuess upon every
possible shade of interpretation. Grammar, too, was at ﬁrst studied
solely in connection with the Koran, and a prodigious mass of
legal literature was founded exclusively upon the sacred volume.
Of late years, however, some attempts have been made to super—
sede the ancient law, and to introduce a modern European system.
The Beduins still have their peculiar customary law.

With regard to theological, legal, and still more to ritualistic
questions, El-Islam has not always been free from dissension. There
are in the ﬁrst place four Orthodox sects, the Haneﬁtes, the Shd/‘e-
Was, the Malelcites, and. the Hambalites, who are named after their
respective founders. In addition to these must be mentioned the
schools of Free Thinkers, WllO sprang up at an early period, partly
owing to the inﬂuence of Greek philosophy. The orthodox party,
however, triumphed, not only over these heretics, but also in its
struggle against the voluptuousness and luxury of the most glorious
period of the khalifs.

Ascetism and fanaticism were also largely developed among
professors of El-Islam, and another phase of religious thought was
pure MYSTIeIsM, which arose chieﬂyin Persia. The mystics (,r‘dﬁ) in—
terpret many texts of the Koran allegorically, and their system there-
