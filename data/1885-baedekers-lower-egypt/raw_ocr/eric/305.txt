the Egyptian dominions, on which occasion El-Ghnri caused the whole
of the S. side of the Haram at Mecca to be rebuilt (in 906 of the Hegira],

of the Osmans, and, before his newly equipped fleet reached India. the
sultan himself died. On 21th Aug. 1516, while ﬁghting against the army
of the Osman sultan Selim I. in the plain of Dahik (to the N. of Aleppo),
he is said to have fallen down in a ﬁt of apoplexy, and to have been

white striped facades (p. 180). The ﬁrst of these is the —-

Muristan Kalafm (P1. 73), once a vast hospital (‘mﬁristan’,
from the Persian word himaristan), the greater part of which is
110w in a ruinous condition, and used as a workshop by copper-
smiths and tinkers. The tomb of the founder, however, which
