Street Scenes. CAIRO. 3. Route. 247

which consists of a long strip of muslin, covering the whole of the
face except the eyes, and reaching nearly to the feet. Lastly they
put on the Izrtbnm, a kind of mantle, which in the case of mar-
ried women consists of two breadths of
glossy black silk. Thus disguised, they
look unnaturally broad and unwieldy, and
not unlike hats. The wealthier ladies, who
drive in their carriages attended by eunuchs,
usually veil their faces 11p to their eyes
with thin gauze in accordance with the
fashion of Constantinople. With regard to
circumcision, weddings, and funerals, the
ceremonies attending which are similar in
all the Egyptian towns, see p. 1:33. Among
other customs we may also mention the
peculiar mode in which a woman carries her
child, either astride her shoulder, or rest-
ing on her hip.

Amid this busythrong of men and ani-
mals resound the various cries of street-ven-
dors and other persons who transact their
business in the open air, and the warning
shouts ofoutruuncrs (sins), coachmen, d011-
key—attendants, and camel—drivers. The
words most commonly heard are —— ‘rz‘glalc’,
‘shemélak’, ‘yeminak’, ‘gmmlu’, ‘12’d, ﬁ’c‘t’.
As a rule, however, the Cairenes pay no
attention to these warnings unless address—
ed to them individually. Thus, ‘riglnlt ya
Ichuwﬁgch’ Cyour foot, sir”, Le. ‘talre care of
your foot’; Iclmwﬁgch is the usual title given
to Europeans by the Arabs, and is said to
have originally meant ‘merehant’ only);
‘shemc‘zlakyt‘t shé‘kIt’Cyonrleft side, 0 chief’);
‘yem‘mnk yﬁ bint’ Cyonr right side, girl’);
‘glalwilc mi 5512' Cyonr back, lady’]; ‘yc‘t
'arﬁseh’ (bride); ‘yd sherif’ (descendant of the
prophet); ‘ya cfcndi’ (Turkish ofﬁcial), ——
BEGGARS are very numerous at Cairo, most
of them being blind. They endeavour to
excite compassion by invoking the aid of
Allah: ‘yz‘t Mohannin, ya Rabb’ CO awakener of pity, 0 Master’) ,
‘tdlib min alluh IzuItIt lukmet ‘5fo CI seek from my Lord the price
of a morsel of b1ead ]; amt déf Altr‘th wa n—nebi C I am the guest
of God and of the Prophet’). The usual answer of the passer- by is,
‘Allah yihannin ulelc CGod will have mercy on you), or ‘Altah
ya ttlc’ C God give thee’, comp. p. 16 ]
