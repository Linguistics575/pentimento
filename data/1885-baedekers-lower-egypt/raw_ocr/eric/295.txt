architecture is a mixture of Arabian and Turkish, but the plan is rather

ruined, quarter of Cairo, which was erected by the Tulunides (1).

About 440 yds. from the Place this street is intersected by another,
running from N. to S.,_ the N. (right) part of which is called the
Silifiyeh, and the S. (left) part the Rugbtyeh. At the beginning
of the Siufiyeh, on the right, is a new Arabian Girls’ School, and
beyond it, on the same side, is the Tekiyet et—Maulawiyeh (Fl. 36;
F. 3), where the dervishes perform their dances (p. 239), with
a dome adorned with carefully sculptured arabesques. (This street
terminates in the Boulevard Nohammed ‘Ali.) At the corner
opposite the mosque is the recently completed Seb’il of the Mother
of'xlbbcis Pasha. (P1. 9-1), in marble, rich and effective in general
appearance, but lacking ﬁnish in its details. The large school
above it is hardly worth visiting.

the key, who leads the way up the direct and somewhat steep path
to the mosque. Those who are driving return to the Sebil of the
Mother of Abbas Pasha and enter the Rngbiyeh street, follow it for

*Gami' ibn 1ulun (Pl. 68). This mosque7 the oldest in Cairo,
was erected by Abu’l—‘Abbds Ahmed ibn Tulﬁn, the independent
governor of Egypt under the suzerainty of Khalif Mn'tamid (A.D.
870-92], in the year 265 of the Hegira (A.D. 879), on the once
fortiﬁed hill of Kal'at el-Kebsh (see p. 268).

Ahmed ibn Tulan, the founder of the dynasty of the Tulunides (p. 102),
was so successful in war that be extended the boundaries ongypt beyond
Syria and as far as Mesopotamia, but was proclaimed a rebel from the
mambar of every mosque by the rAbbaside khalif El—Mu'tamid “Baghdad
(see above), and fell a victim to disease in Syria in A.D. 884.

According to one legend the mosque occupies the spot where Abraham
sacriﬁced the goat (kebsh) instead of his son, whence the appellation
l_{al'at el-Kebsh (i.e., ‘castle of the goat‘). Another legend points to this
as the spot where Noah‘s ark ran aground on the 10th Moharrem
(p. 236), although the Muslims generally believe that this event took place
on Mt. Jﬁdi near Mosul in Syria (see p. 143). According to a third
tradition the name is derived from the winding staircase which ascends
the still existing minaret [see below) in the form of a twisted ram‘s horn.
