496 Route 10. OASIS or FinftN. From Suez

IIislm-y. The (Iasis of Fin-fin was probably occupied at a very early
period by the .Ama]ekit.es. and outside of its gates was doubtless fought
the battle in which they were defeated by the Israelites. The town of
the Oasis is even called by hlahrizi a city of the Amalekites, long after
the Christians had been expelled from it by the Muslims. The Oasis is
mentioned by Diodorus only before the Christian period. but in the 2nd
cent. Ad). Claudius Ptolcmaeus speaks of the town of Film-wt, which
soon became an Episcopal See and the central point of the monastic and
anchorite fraternities of the peninsula. Remains of old monasteries and
herinits‘ cells are nowhere more numerous than here, and on the rocky
slopes and plateaus of the Serbﬁl. In the 4th cent. we hear of the town
heing governed by a senate. and about the year 400 the spiritual affairs
of the country were presided over by Bishop Nateras or Nathyr. The
council of Chalcedon accorded to the oasis an archbishop of its own.
who, however, was subordinate to the recently founded patriarchate of
Jerusalem. In 454 )lacarius is mentioned as bishop of Pharan. The Sol-
itary monasteries among the mountains suffered frequently from the
attacks of the Blemmyes and Saracens, who, however, did not venture
to attack the wellvgnarded city of the oasis, which paid tribute to their
shékhs. The Romans were nominally masters of l’haran, but in reality
it was subject to the sway of the Saracen princes, and one of these, nam—
ed Abokharagor, presented it to Justinian, who. as a reward, appointed
him phylareh of the Saracens of Palestine. Early in the 5th cent. the
monks and anchorites of Pharan began to embrace heretical principles,
and we frequently, hear of admonitions and threats directed by the or-
thodox synods and the Emperors against them as )Ionotbelites and Mono-
physites. — According to the trustworthy testimony of Procnpius, his
contemporary Justinian (527-505) was not the founder of the present mn-
nastery of Sinai, as inscriptions of the 13th cent. built into its walls
erroneously state, but be erected a church to the Virgin halfway up the
Jebel hlﬁsa, probably on the site of the present chapel of Elijah, and
also constructed and garrisoned a strong fortress at the foot of the
mountain, on the site uf the present monastery of St. Catharine, in order
to prevent the Saracens of the peninsula from invading Palestine. It
was doubtless the protection afforded by this castle that gradually attracted
the numerous herniits of the peninsula from the Serbzil to the Jehel
)Iﬁsa, which they made the scene of a number of old Christian legends.
Pharan was at an early period regarded as the site of the llephidim of
the Bible (see below). Eusebius of Cmsarea (h. 270), and his translator
Jerome, state that the battle of the Amalekites took place near l’haran.
Cosmas (535), who visited the Oasis in person, states that Rephidim, where
Moses struck the rock, lay near Pharan, and thc aecount of Antoninns
Martyr of his entry into Pharan shows that regularly organised pilgrimages
to llephidim took place. Among other objects the natives ot’t'ered small
casks of radish»oi1 (Rhaphanino oleo) to the pilgrims, which were prob—
ably carried off as mementoes of Bephidim, as its name (raphanus, ra-
phaninus) imports. — After the dissemination of El-Isldm the anchorites
gradually became extinct.

Rqﬂzidz‘m and tire Bible Nam-alive (comp. p. 493). In the Book of
Numbers (xxxiii. 13-11) we ﬁnd the following passage: ‘And they depart-
cd from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. And they removed from
Alush, and cnramped at Ilephidim, where was no water for the people to
drink”. — Alush was probably situated between the VVddi llaghdra and
the ‘Vadi Firﬁu, and Rephidim in the ‘Vadi Fir-ﬁn at the entrance of the
oasis. The 17th chapter of the Book of Exodus contains important ad-
ditional information. \Ve are there informed that the people murmured
against Moses, and reproached him with having led them out of Egypt
to die of thirst; whereupon “Moses cried unto the liord‘, who commanded
him to strike the rock with his staff. And Moses did so, and the rock
yielded a copious spring. Amalek then came and fought with the Isra.e]~
ites at llephidim, and the battle is described. The Bible narrative
presents to us a picture of Moses stationed on a rock which commanded
the battleﬁeld, and praying, while Aaron and Ilur “stayed up his hands”;
