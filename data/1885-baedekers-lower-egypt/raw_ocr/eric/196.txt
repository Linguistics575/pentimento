The Mohammedan style of architecture in the valley of the Nile
was not, as might perhaps be expected, the immediate successor
Ofthe Egyptian, but was separated from it by tltat 0f the early
(‘hristian epoch, a period of six or seven centuries. This new style
was not of natiu; growth, but was imported from abroad, being of
Arabian origin, considerably modiﬁed by the forms of art which the
victorious Arabs found in vogue among the liyzantines, and by
those of Persian art of the era of the, Sassanides. Different as the
Arabian buildings at Baghdad and Cairo may appear from those at
Tunis and in Spain, they all possess certain features in common.
The fundamental idea of all Mohammedan architecture originated
in the nomadic life of the Arabs. The tent was the prototype,
alike of the house and of the. temple. The walls in particular, with
their carpet-like decoration, and their extensive, nnrelieved sur-
faces, remind one of this origin. This style of architecture is that
of the tickle children of the (losert, whose ediﬁces, even after they
had become a settled and stationary nation, continue to convey an
idea of unsubstantiality, and who never attained to a clear per-
I‘t ption (If the proportion to be observed between the support and
the burden to be borne. This defect is less apparent in cases where
the Arabian builders were brought under the influence of more
f'iVillSCd nations, where they employed columns, Entablatnres, and
uthtr fragments of ruined ediﬁces which they found available, or

other foreign architects, than in purely Arabian ediﬁces like the
