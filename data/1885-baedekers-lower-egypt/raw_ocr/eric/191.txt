the portal ofthe l’rosekos, or hall ‘of the manifestation of majesty’,
they were permitted to behold from afar the sacred emblem ot'
divinity. These worshippers were now passed by the king and the
ofﬁciating priests, who ascended in solemn procession to the roof,
while the high priest entered the small and sombre chamber of the
god. The annexed ground—plan of the S. temple at liaruak will
render the foregoing description more intelligible (Fig. X), and
analogous arrangements might easily be pointed out in the temples-
of other nations, such as those of Semitic race. The erection of
obelisks or colossi (or both] in front of the pylons is also suscep-
tihle of easy explanation. The obelisks, the form of which was well
adapted to break the monotonous outline of the walls, record in

Pharaohs by the god, while the royal statues remind beholdcrs of
the duty of monarchs to show their gratitude by erecting temples t0

good over evil; and an inscription at Edfu informs us that, after
the victory of Horus, Thoth [reason] commanded this symbol to be
placed over all entrances. On the other hand the way in which
architecture is constantly made subservient to paintinv. for the
purpose of obtaining surfaces for symbols and inscriptions , is
unpleasing. Every column. every pillar, every roof-beam, and every
wall is embellished with raised or engraved ﬁgures and characters.

the Pharaohs, and their intercourse with the gods, are always ac-
companied by explanatory inscriptions, and even the simplest orna-
ments used under the new empire have some symbolical signiﬁcation.

The form of temple above described sometimes required to be
varied in consequence of the nature of the site. In Lower Nubia
the sandstone rocks approach so near the Nile that the temples had
to be partially or wholly excavated in their sides. At Girgell, for
example (Fig. X1), the pylons and the colonnaded courtyard were
built in the open air in front ofthe temple, while the hypostylc and
