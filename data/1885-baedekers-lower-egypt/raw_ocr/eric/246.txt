of ﬁgs.’ This walk aﬂ'ords a good view of the street-trafﬁc of the
city, but the palace itself, which was built by Mohammed rAli and
restored by lsma‘il Pasha, is uninteresting, especially as the Diw‘zin,
or Council Chambers, were destroyed by a ﬁre in 1870. The balcony,
however, commands a ﬁne view of the extensive harbour. (Ad-
mission by ticket procured at the Consulate; but the hotel com-
missionnaires sometimes obtain access by payment of a bakshish.]
The Harem. a separate building, facing the sea, is built on the
model of the seraglio at Constantinople. A visit to the neighbour-
ing Lighthouse is very interesting, especially in the early morning,
but admission is granted only to those provided with an order from
the governor, which may he obtained through the English or Amer-
ican consulate. The Arsenal, (Pl. 1) is not worth visiting.

A drive (3 )I.; road very dusty; carriage in the afternoon
10 fr.. or after 5 p.111. 5-7 fr., fee 1 fr.) should also be taken to
the (linEnet cn-Nuzha, or public garden (usually called the Ja'rtlin
Pustré). Turning to the right outside the Porte de Rosette (Pl. 40),
leaving the European cemeteries to the left, and avoiding the
road which leads in a straight direction to Ramloh, we pass the
waterworks on the left, cross a small mound of ancient rubbish,
and reach the Muhmz‘zdiyeh ('unrrl (p. 215]. We then turn to the
left, drive for a short time along the canal, and soon reach the
entrance to the gardens, where a band plays on Fridays and Sun-
days from 4 to G p.111. Europeans will be interested by the pro-
fusion of exotic plants which thrive here in the open air. A little
higher up is a ﬁne garden belonging to )1. Antoniadis, a rich Greek
merchant, who has liberally thrown it open to the public. On the
days on which the band plays this part of the canal is the resort of
the fashionable world of Alexandria.

letracing our steps, and following the bank of the canal. which
lies on the left, we observe on the right a long succession of villas
and gardens, including the viceroyal chateau Nim'reh Tctciteh
[‘Nnmber Three“). with its handsome entrance, and the chateau
and garden of .rlIoZm'rrem-ch. We may n0w re-enter the city by
the l’orte Moharrem-Bey, or by the Porte de la Colonne Pornpée.

Adjoining the W. side of the city is the site of the original
Macedonian Necropotis, a reminiscence of which is preserved in the
Arabic name Guburi [see below). No traces of the cemetery now
remain, the ground being occupied by a dirty suburb intersected
by very bad roads. About 41/2 ll]. farther W. are the Quarries of
Meier: [see below), which are hardly worthy of a visit (carriage
there and back in 2-3 hrs., 10-12 fr.)

Starting from the Place Mc’hémet—Ali, we follow the new Rue
Ibrrihim [1’]. E, I“, {i , 5), which has been constructed straight
through an old Arabian quarter, and at the end ofit cross the
Mahmﬁdiyeh Canal. We then turn to the left, crossing the rails
which lead to the extensive new quay, and immediately after—
