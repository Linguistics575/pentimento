proved to possess. llamilton, in l901, was a dispassionale and critical
observer. ln 1317, Caviglia, a hold, hut illiterate and fanciful Seaman, was
fortunate in eliciting new facts regarding the interior of the Great Pyramid,
and excavated the Sphinx. In 1917, Belzoni (p. 359], an intelligent invest—
igator and discoverer, thoroughly explored the interior ofthc Second Pyr-
amid. The next eminent explorer was Sir Gardner “'illzinson in 1531. lo
[837 and 1838 Col. Howard V'yse and Mr. l’erring made very thorough in-
vestigations and took careful measurements which will always be con—
sidcred authoritative. In 1842-45 Prof. Lepsius, the distinguished German
Egyptologist, who was president of the Prussian expedition, made several
very important discoveries, and furnished us with much valuable in-
formation. lIe found no fewer than thirty pyramids which had been quite
unknown to previous travellers. To ll. Mariette is chieﬂy due the merit
of having explored the hurial places of Sahlgiira (pp. 378, 388), which
yielded him a rich spoil.

Ascent of the Great Pyramid.

Exrsnion. The traveller selects two of the ixuportunate lleduins by
whom he is assailed, and proceeds to the NE. corner of the Pyramid,
where the ascent begins. (Payment, see below. The selection of the
guides should properly be made by the shf-kh; but this is seldom done,
and even when it is. the traveller is still pestered hy the others for
llalgshish.) These. strong and active attendants assist the traveller to
mount by pushing, pulling, and supporting him , and will scarcely allow
him a moment‘s rest until the top is reached. As. however, the unwont-
ed exertion is fatiguing, the traveller should insist on resting several
times on the way up. if so disposed. Ladies should have a suitable
dress for the purpose, and a. stool may he. brought to facilitate their
ascent by halving the height of the steps. The ascent. may he made in
10-15 min, but, in hot weather especially. the traveller is recommended
to take nearly double that time. As the blocks are generally upwards
of 3ft. in height. the traveller will ﬁnd the assistance of the guides very
acceptable, though not indispensable. Persons inclined to giddiness may
find the descent a. little trying. but the. help of the lieduins removes all
danger. lloth in going and returning the traveller is importuued for lial5-
shish, but he should decline giving anything until the descent has been
safely accomplished. At the summit. of the Pyramid the patience is
again sorely tried by the. onslaught of vendors ot‘spur-iuus antiquities and
dishonest money-changers. all pai-ley with whom should he avoided. Those.
who make a prolonged stay on the top had better he provided with sum
shades and perhaps also with grey or blue spectacles.

ls'rsmou. A visit to the interior of the Great Pyramid is interest~
ing, but, though the guides represent it as easy and desirable, it will
be found fatiguing and far from pleasant. The explorer has to crawl
and clamher through low and narrow passages, which, at places,
especially near the entrance, are not above 3V2 ft. high and 4 ft. wide.
The stones on the floor are often extremely slippery, and the close air
smells strongly of hats-t. Travellers who are in the slightest degree
predisposed to apoplectie or fainting ﬁts should not attempt to penetrate
iuto these stilling recesses.

For the ascent a single traveller usually takes two guides, hut three
suffice for two travellers. For a visit to the interior each traveller is
accompanied by one guide. The customary fee for the whole expedition
is 21/;- fr, for each traveller, whether he has been attended hy one. two.
or three guides. The lloduins are never contented with this sum, hut
the remuneration is ample. The traveller, however, if not dissatisfied.
may give. an additional gratuity of L2 silver piastrcs to each of his I
guides. (in no accountshonld any payment he made to any of them llu-

% The temperature of the interior is 79° Fahr.. i.e.. as is usually the I
ease in subterranean chambers, the same as the mean temperature of the
outer air in the neighhourhuod.
