9. The Fayt‘im.

A 'l‘ocn 'rnnot'cn THE Farﬁn, includng a visit to the Labyrinth, the
site of Lake Morris, the Birket el—KIm‘tn with its abundant Wildfowl,
and the ruins in its neighbourhood, takes (5-8 days, and requires a tent,
a dragonian, and a supply of provisions. A dragoinan charges 30-40“.
a day for each person, according to the requirements of his employers,
and for that sum he is hound to provide them with a tent, provisions
(wine excepted), and donkeys, or other means of conveyance, and to
pay railway fares and all other expenses. A written contract (comp.
p.471), specifying the places to be visited, the points where some stay is to
be made (on which occasions a reduced charge per day should be stipulated
for), and other particulars. should be drawn up before starting. Those
who intend to visit Medinet el-Faytiin and its immediate environs only,
and who do not object to rough quarters for one or two nights, may
dispense with a. dragoman and a tent, but should he provided with a
moderate supply of food. An introduction to the inudir will be of great
service in enabling the traveller to procure the necessary horses or donkeys,
which the inhabitants are often unwilling to hire (comp. p. 453).

Since the completion of the railway this excursion has usually been
undertaken from Cairo, but it may also be combined with a visit to
Sahhftrah. It was formerly usual to visit the Fayfuu in commotion with
a journey up the Nile, but this plan entails needless expense, as the boat
and its crew have to he paid for while lying idle for several days. If,
however, the traveller prefers this plan, he disembarks at “’asta. and sends
on his dhahabiyeh toBeui Suef, which he afterwards reaches by railway.

SITUATION AND HISTHRY or run Farﬁu. In the great plateau of the
Libyan Desert, which rises BUG—JOUft. above the sca»level, is situated the
province of the FAYI'JM (from the ancient Egyptian ‘I’hioni‘, Le. marsh
or lake district). the ﬁrst of the oases, which is usually considered to
belong to the valley of the Nile, and is justly celebrated for its extru-
ordinary fertility (see below). This tract is in the form of an oval basin,
8'40 sq. lit. in area, and supports a population] of 200.000 souls; it is enclosed
by the Libyan hills. which are here of moderate height, and lies about
three—fifths of a degree to the S. of Cairo. lt enjoys a remarkably tine
climate, and has but rarely been visited by the plague. This ‘land of
roses” is still one of the most beautiful parts of Egypt, and more than
any other part of the Nile valley deserves the well known epithet of “the
git'tuf the Nile‘, bestowed on Egypt by Herodotus. as it is entirely indcblcd
for its fertility to the waters of the Nile with which it is artiﬁcially irri-
gated. The Bohr I'Ilsuf. a channel 207 I“. in length. which is more probably

from the Nile t0 the N. ot'Assiﬁt. and ﬂows through a narrow opening in
the Libyan chain into the Fayiini, where it divides into numerous
ramiﬁcations, abundantly watering the whole district. One ofits branches
runs towards the N., skirting the E. slopes ofthe Libyan bills. At the point
whore the Ruhr Ynsﬁf enters the Fayﬁni, the district forms a plateau of
moderate height, descending towards the \V. in three gradations towards
the Iiirket cl-lfurlin, a long, narrow lake, extending from 5.\V. to NE.
