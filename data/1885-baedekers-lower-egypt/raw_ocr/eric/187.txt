capitals, somewhat simple in form, and tapering upwards, are
sometimes decorated on the lower part with a wreath of upright
reed leaves7 and sometimes, like the shafts, are treated as surfaces
for painting, in which case their origin in the vegetable kingdom
is indicated by a few painted buds only (Fig. V. u, b].

VI. Calyx Capitals.

While the columns hitherto described performed the structural
function in temples and tombs of supporting
massive stone roofs, the order of columns with
Calyx Capitals was chieﬂy used for the decorative
purpose of enclosing the processional approach

formed the natural prototypes, and even at a
late period several other very pleasing types were
added. Another kind of column, which seems to ' {j

of independent Egyptian art, is of inferior im—
portance and artistic merit. It has a shaft ter-
minating at the top in masks attached to four
sides, usually representing the goddess llathor
