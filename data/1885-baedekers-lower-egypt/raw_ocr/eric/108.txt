HISTORY.

given by hepsius, and now generally accepted, the mythical period
was succeeded by that of the Primueuat Monarchy, the Ilylcsos Do-
mination, and the New Empire, which were followed by the supre-
macy of the Persians, the Ptolemics, and the Romans in succession.
Another system recognizes between the Old and the New Empire
a Middle .‘llonurchy, which includes the period of the Ilyksos. These
divisions, in conformity with the lists of .\lanetho, are again sub-
divided into Dynasties, or different families of kings, named after
the districts 01' names (It. 3‘3] of which their founders were natives.
