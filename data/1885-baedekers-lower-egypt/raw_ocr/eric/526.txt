siderablo, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface con«
sisting of large slabs. Descending again, and looking into the halls, we may
observe the whole series borne by twenty—seven monolithic, columns. The
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb, consist-
ing of a square pyramid, each side of which is four plethra (400 ft.) in
length, and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried here, is called
Ismandcs. It is also asserted that so many palaces were built, because it
was the custom for all the nomes, represented by their magnates, with
their priests and victims, to assemble here to offer sacriﬁce and gifts to the
gods, and to deliberate on the most important concerns. Each nomc
then took possession of the hall destined for it. Sailing about a hundred
stadia beyond this point, we next reach the town of Arsinoé‘, etc. This
description of Straho is conﬁrmed by the contents of two papyri, one of
which is in the museum of Gizeh, the other in private possession (Mr.
Hood). The deities of 66 districts are enumerated here, 24 of whom her
long to Upper Egypt. 20 to Lower Egypt, and 2?. to the Fayﬁm.

It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings
of Nile bricks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as
tombs. Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the splen-
dour of the old ‘wonder of the world’. lxcopt some blocks of lime-
stone, nothing remains of the extensive structures once erected

here, save the pyramid ‘at the end of the labyrinth’.

To the N. of the pyramid Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered some mummy
cofﬁns with carefully painted heads (now in London). Of still greater
value are the portraits found at el-Rubaydt, 13 Ill. to the NE. of Me—
dinct cl~Fayum, which were purchased and brought to Europe by )1. Theo-
dore Graf.

Lake Moeris. The object of Lake MLEriS, which has long since been
dried up, was to receive the superﬂuous water in the ease of too high
an inundation, and to distribute its contents over the ﬁelds when the
overﬂow was insufﬁcient. Strabo describes Lake Moeris in the follow-
ing terms: *Owing to its size and depth it is capable of receiving the
superabundance of water during the inundation, without overflowing the
habitations and crops; but later, when the water subsides, and after the
lake has given up its excess through one of its two mouths, both it and
the canal retain water enough for purposes of irrigation. This is accom-
plished by natural means, but at both ends of the canal there are also
lock-gates, by means of which the engineers can regulate the inﬂux
and efﬂux of the \vater.’ The lock-gate, which in ancient times ad-
mitted the water conducted from the Nile by the canal into the lake,
was probably situated near the modern el-Lahnn (see below), the name of
which is supposed to be derived from the old Egyptian ‘Ro-hun‘ or ‘L0-
hurt”, tie. ‘the mouth of the lake“, and the site of which was probably
once occupied by the town of I’tolemai‘s.

There is a difference of opinion as to the Situation and Form of the
Ancient Lake. Linant-Bey, arguing from the considerable diﬂ‘erenCe of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket el—lgurﬁn (Lake
of the Horns, p. 465] could never have formed part of Lake Mteris, as was
formerly supposed, and he assigns to the latter a much smaller area than
was attributed to it under the earlier theory. Placing it farther to the
S.E., nearer to the Labyrinth and el-Lahﬁn, he makes its boundary-line
run towards the S.S.W’. of llledinet el—Fayt‘im to the Bil-Ice! el-G/Iamlc, and
intersect the desert of Slzékh Ahmed, where the ancient height of the wa-
ter, which far exceeds the level attained in modern times, has left its
traces; it then leads to Kalamsha, turns to the N. to Dir, and then to
the 19. and 8.143. to Dimes/(Much, follows the embankment of I’illawdnelt,
and passes Ilawtiret rl—Ii’ebt‘r and the bridge ofel-La/ntn (see below). Hence the
boundary leads by Dimma towards the N.E. to Sela/z, and thence to the W.
to Iii/lama (p. #59); then again to the hi, and thus returns to Medinet el~
