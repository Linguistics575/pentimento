To the S. of the last is the Saint el—G‘funi’ (P1. 10), or Anterior
Court. enclosed by vaulted galleries, in the upper parts of which
plain limestone has been used instead of alabaster. In the centre
is the Ilanefiyeh (p. 184], designed in the debased Turkish style.
On the W. side is the approach to a tower, terminating in pavilions
in the Chinese style, and containing a clock which was presented
to Mohammed ‘Ali by Louis Philippe of France.

A magniﬁcent ““5me is obtained from the parapet at the S.\\".
end of the mosque1 which is reached by walking round the building.
{The palace of the thdive, ﬁtted up in the European style, is
uninteresting.) From this point we survey the yellowish grey city,
with its countless minarets, domes, and gardens. At our feet stands
the mosque of Sultan liasan. To the N. and W. are the windmill-
hillsi and the green plain traversed by the Nile. To the W. in
the distance are. the Pyramids, towering above the desert. 0n the
tlat roofs of the houses we observe innumerable air-pipes, called
mall5af, known also by the Persian name of badgir, by means of
which the cool north-wind is introduced into the houses.

The other mosques in the citadel cannot be visited without spccial
permission (p. 241). Many of the chambers have been diverted from their
orieinal uses, so that they are not easily inspected, and are moreover in
u, very ruinous condition.

The Gami' Ejalaheddin Ynsuf (1’1. 60], situated to the SE. of the
Mosque of )lohnmmed '.»\li, was erected in _—\.I). 1171-08, in a style betray-
ing the inﬂuence of \Vestern architecture, and in many points resembling
that of a. basilica. Here, too, the pointed arch predominates. The openings
under the arcades are of the elongated Moorish form. The dome was
once supported by nine magniﬁcent columns of granite, but it has now
fallen in. the only remains of it being the deeplysenlptnred pendentivcs, As
in the case of most. of the other mosques. the columns have been taken
from ancient monuments. The Kibla is handsomely embellished with
miniature arcades, in the interior ot‘which are rich arabesques. The cotl'ered
ceiling of carved wood is painted white and gilded, with a blue ground.
The windows are still partly tilled with tracery in plaster. The whole
ediﬁce up to the roof is of solid masonry. The minarets, each con-
sisting of a cube with a cylinder above it, are covered at the top with
slabs of green porcelain, and are encircled with a band of ‘Snllus‘ characters
in white on a brown ground.

Immediately to the 3.11 of the Mosque 0f Saladin is the so-called
Well of Joseph (1’1. 27), a. square shaft, sunk in the limestone rock to a
depth of 280 ft., containing somewhat brackish water, which is brought
to the surface by means of two sftlgiyehs, one above the other, worked by
oxen halfway down the opening. Since the introduction of the steam-
pnmps (p. 281], however, the well has lost its former importance. When
the citadel was constructed here in the 12th cent., thelluilders discovered
an ancient shaft filled with sand, which iﬁ'rtldheddiu Yﬁsuf caused to he rc~
opened and named after himself Ydsuf‘s. or Joseph‘s, “'ell. This cir-
cumstance gave, rise to the tradition, which was chietly curt-cut among
the Jews. that this was the well into which the Joseph of scripture was
put by his brethren,and the story isstill faithfullyrcpcatell by the dragomans.

The Gami' Suléman Pasha (PL 67) was erected in the year SUI nfthe

+ \Viudmills were first erected in Egypt, by the French, before which
period all the grain in the country was ground in the houses in hand-
mills tribal. The lattlr are still chieﬂy used and the windmills have
comparatively little to do.
