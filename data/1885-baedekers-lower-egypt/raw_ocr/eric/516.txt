451 Route 6‘. TANIS. Towns of the

Tunis, Mendcs. and Bullastis, thc half-Semitic cities of the Delta, it began
to decline pcrccptibly, although slowly. Flavius Josephus calls the place
a tramp-1;, or small town only, but Strabo and Stephanus of Byzantium
call it ‘the great”. in the course of the frequent invasions in Egypt from
the E., Tanis was usually the ﬁrst place which sullen-ed after Pelnsinm,
so that its ancient monuments were thus gradually destroyed, and the
edicts of Theodosius contributed not a little to the same result. The
work of destruction was ﬁnally completed in consequence of Turkish
misrnlc. and “the great Tanis‘ has thus dwindled down to the ﬁshing
village of Sin. the sole attraction of which consists in the scanty ruins
in the neighbourhood.

Ruins of Tunis. The wall, built ofbricks of Nile mud, enclos—
ing the temple of Ramses 11., the sanctuary of which perhaps
existed as early as the primzcval monarchy, was 250paces long and
about 150 wide. The temple stood in the centre of the town, and
the latter lay on the slopes of hills which had been thrown up on
both sides of the temple, partly for the protection of the temple
itself, and partly to raise the houses above the level of the inun-
dation (p. 410). Ascending a slight eminence close to the village,
we ﬁrst reach a large and much mutilated colossal ﬁgure in granite.
We next come to a hollow made in the. course. of Mariette’s
excavations, with solid substructions of huge blocks of limestone,
in the side of which there is a small chapel. Farther to the E.
another and larger fragment ofrninwas lately excavated, but, like
most of the remains mentioned below, it has again been covered
up with sand. Among the broken ﬁgures in black basalt lying
here is a female torso, a singular peculiarity of which is that the
left breast is much larger than the right. A damaged colossal
ﬁgure, prostrate on the ground, is worthy of notice, ‘as it shows
that even granite monuments were painted. ’l‘he ﬂesh parts of
these 'l'anitic coloured statues were painted bright pink, or almost
red, the eyebrows reddish brown, and the ‘halantika‘, or headdress
resembling a wig, yellow of various shades. Most of the statues
and blocks bear the name of Ramses II. The ﬁnest of those of the
early monarchy (such as the colossal statue of Usertesen at Berlin)
are now deposited in different museums. The name of )Ierenptah
is also observed on a number of ruins, and so also is the cartouche
of Sheshenk, or Sesonchis ”L, of the r32nd Dynasty, of Bnbastis,
but only on those architectural fragments and statues which owe their
origin to llamsesll. Alittle farther t0 the E. was probably situated
the hypostylc, or colonnaded hall of the temple, as is evidenced
by the broken columns lying on the ground, including several huge
shafts of granite, crowned with ﬁnely executed palm capitals. At
the bottom of the opening made by the last excavations, lie shat-
tered obclisks, colossal statues, capitals of columns, shafts, and
bases, in grand confusion. All these fragments are of granite,
granwacke, or other hard stone. On a blackish ﬁgure in a sitting
posture is inscribed the name of Ramses 1]., who is here called
‘lord of thc diadcms’, ‘proteetor of Egypt’, and ‘dcstroyer of foreign
nations.’ The shaft of a huge column also bears the still traceable
