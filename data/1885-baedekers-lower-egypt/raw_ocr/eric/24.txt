4 MONEY.

The current rate of exchange should always be ascertained from
a banker (pp. 206, 232; see also Table, p. :3), andmoney should be
changed as rarely as possible at an ordinary money—changer’s, at a
hotel, in the bazaars, or through a dragoman. For excursions in
the country the traveller should he provided with an ample supply
of small change (silver piastres, hall'-piastres, and copper coin), as
the villagers sometimes refuse to change money of any kind, and
the traveller may thus be very seriously inconvenienced. They also
frequently decline to take a coin if the inscription is worn away by
use, and in their examination of gold pieces they attach great im-
portance to the ring of the metal. The traveller should also be on
his guard against counterfeit dollars and piastres. A favourite orna-
ment with Oriental women consists of a string of gold coins worn
round the head, or as a necklace, and coins with holes in them are
accordingly often met with, but they are very apt to be rejected by
the natives. in changing money, therefore, all these points should
he attended to. it need hardly be observed that money should al-
\\'a_\s be carefully kept under lock and key, and that it should be
shown as little as possible, in order that the cupinlity of the people
with whom the traveller has to do may not he aroused.

l'aper money is unknown in the East. liesides the Egyptian
coinage, which moreover has two different rates of exellanget.
'l‘nrkish, French, English, ltalian, Austrian, and ltussian gold and
silver coins are freely circulated.

The unit of reckoning in the Egyptian currency is the Piastre,
\Vlllt‘ll contains 40 Paras. In ordinary retail trafﬁc accounts are
kept in current—pinstres, which are worth one-half of the govern-
ment tori/f—piustrcs. As, however, these do not, as might be sup—
posed, indicate two different coins, this twofold mode of reckoning
is exceedingly puzzling to strangers. it should be particularly ob—
served that at the shops and bazaars the prices are always fixed in
current piastres, so that half the number of silver coins only has to
he given. The shopkeepers, however, generally convert their prices
into francs for the beneﬁt of strangers, and although their demands
are then somewhat raised, they are at least more intelligible. 0n
the other hand, in making small purchases, and in dealing with
country-people, it is more advantageous to keep to the reckoning
in current piastrrs, as the sellers are very apt to demand as many
francs as the amount of the price in piastres.
