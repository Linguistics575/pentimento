160 HISTORY OF ART.

this vigorous style ot'art, occasioned perhaps by political dissensions,
by internal wars. and possibly by a change of religious convictions.
it was not until the rise of the Eleventh Dynasty that the state of
the country became more settled, and that art beganto revive. The
new style, however, differed materially from the old. As the ancient
capitals of .‘lemphis and This now began to yield precedence to
'l‘hehes. the new centre ot‘the kingdom, and as the system ofwriting,
thelaws, andthe constitution. had all undergone material alteration,
so. too, it may rather be said that the cultivation ofart began anew
than that the style then practised was a development of that of the
fourth and sixth dynasties. Of this second eftloreseence of art no
great monuments have been handed down tons, the most important
works being the obelisks of Heliopolis and the Fayﬁm and several
colossi dug up at Tanis and Abydus. The rock tombs of lieni l'lasan
are also interesting relics of the period of the Twelfth Dynasty.
in these we ﬁnd a reversion to the rock-building style, which, ac-
cording to Lepsius, is nearly identical with that of the grotto
architecture, and owed its origin to the prevalence of ancestor-
worship, and to the. popular desire, arising from the Egyptian doctrine
of immortality, for the preservation of the bodies of the (lead. The
rock-tomb was safe from theoveri‘low of the Nile, while its equable
temperature arrested the decay of the corpse, and a chapel con-
nected with it aﬂ‘orded the relations an opportunity of paying
homage and presenting oﬂ‘erings to the deceased. The division
of the tomb into a series of chambers, leading at length to the
actual sepulchre, soon led to their being architecturally decor-
ated. Where there were several chambers, one behind the other, it
was natural that openings should be made in the walls for the sake
of admitting light. The nth step was to convert the remaining
portions of wall into pillars for the support of the roof, and to plane
oil their corners, partofthe pillar being, however, leftsquare. at the
top so as to blend the octagonal column with the roof. In the
next place the octagonal pillar was sometimes converted into one
of sixteen sides, so as to resemble a column, and in some cases
the ﬂat surfaces were grooved or fluted, a sharp angle being thus
formed between each of them. l’olygonal columns ofthis character,
which occur in the first tomb of iieni I‘lasan, have been called
l’roto—lloric or l-lgypto-lloric by Champollion and l’alkener, from
tlu ir resemblance to the Dorie. columns of tlieﬂreeks (Fig. ll ]. The
points of resemblance are the marked iluting, the tapering, and the.
absence of bases; but the Prom—Doric differs from the Greek Doric
in being destitute of the. leehinus’, a member resembling an over—
lmnvine wreath oflcavcs, and forming the capital ofthelloric column.
In some cast-s there is the. still greater diil‘erence that the l‘roto-
Doric. columns are uniluted, the surfaces being left smooth for the
