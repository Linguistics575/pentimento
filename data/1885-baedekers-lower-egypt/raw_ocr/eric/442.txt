in the reign of Psammetikh I. and extended at intervals down to the
time of the last of the Ptolemies, form a series of vaults on both
sides of a lofty horizontal corridor hewn in the solid rock. These
chambers average 26 ft. in height, arid their pavement and vaulted
ceilings are constructed of excellent Mokattam stone. The passages
into Which they open have an aggregate length of 380 yds., and
are about 10ft. in width and
171/2 ft. in height. Twenty-
four of the chambers still con-

WE 7ft. in width, and ‘11 ft. in
“,4 height, and no less than 65 tons

in weight. The covers, ﬁve of
. which are composed of separate
‘ pieces of stone cemented to-
gether, have in several instances
been pushed on one side, and
on the top of some of them the
Arabs, for some unexplained
reason, have built rude masses
of masonry. All the sarcophagi,
when discovered by Mariette,
had been emptied of their con-
* tents. with the exception of
two, which still contained a number of trinkets.

Twenty-four of the sarcophagi are of granite, but three of them
only hear inscriptions, brieﬂy recording the name of the king by
whom they were erected. One of these sarcophagi bears the name
of Amusis (the last king but one of the r26th Dynasty], another
that of Cambyses, and a third that of Khubbash (p. 9-1), a king of
the house of the Sa'ites, who gained possession of the throne dur-
ing the reign of Darius and occupied it until the second year of'
Xerxes. The cartouches on a fourth sarcophagus, dating from one
of the later Ptolemies, are empty. The most instructive relics
found here were the ‘Apis Steles’, or small stone votive tablets pre—
sented by pilgrims to the shrine of the bull last interred, and
which, it is said, could only be received within seventy days of
the sacred animal’s death. These tablets during the earliest period
were attached to the basement of the small temple of Apis erected
above the vault, and afterwards to the wall which shut off the
vault from the main passage. As time rolled on, they were set
up at a still greater distance from the tomb, although, curiously
enough, specially favoured persons were permitted to place Sta—
luttllcs, hearing inscriptions similar to those on the steles, near the

dummy.
