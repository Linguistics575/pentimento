Govs or THE Osuus AND ISIS ORDER. We owe to l’lntarch a
detailed account of this myth, which has been uniformly corroborat-
ed by the monuments, and which may be brieﬂy told as follows.

Isis and Osiris were
the children of Rhea and
Uhronos, that is, of Nut,
the goddess of space, and
of Seb,the god ofthe earth,
which, owing to its eternal
rejuvenescence and im—
perishableness, symbolis-
estime. While stillin the
womb of their mother,that
is, in the bosom of space,
the childreubocame unit—
ed, and from their union
sprang Horus. Typhon and
Nephthys, children of the
same parents, likewise
married each other. Osiris
and Isis reigned as a happy
royal pair, bestowing on
Egypt the blessings of
wealth and prosperity.
’l'yphon conspired against Osiris, and at a banquet persuaded him
to enter a cunningly wrought chest, which he and his seventy-two
accomplices then closed and threw into the Nile. The river carried
the chest northwards, and so down to the sea by way of the estuary
of 'l‘anis; and the Waves at length washed it ashore near the Phen-
niciau liyblus. Meanwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the
country, seeking her lost husband; and she at length succeeded in
discovering his cofﬁn, which she carried to a sequestered spot and
concealed. She then set out to visit her son Ilorus, who was being
educated at lluto. During her absence 'l'yphon, while engaged in a
boar-hunt, foundthe hodyoi‘the god, cutitiuto fourteeupieces. and
Scattered them in every direction. As soon as Isis learned what had
happened, she collected the fragments, and wherever one had been
found erected amonurnent on the spot to its memory; and this ac-
counts for the numerous tombs of Osiris mentioned as existing in
Egypt and elsewhere. Osiris, however, was not dead. He had con—
tinued his existence and his reign in the lowcrregions, and after his
burial he visited his son Horns, whom he armed and trained for battle.
The young god soon began a war against 'J‘yphou, and was at length
Victorious, although he did not succeed ill totally destroying his enemy.
