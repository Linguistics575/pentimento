blackened and discoloured with age. Many valuable art relics have
been removed from the church since 1860. A number of old pictures
of saints which still remain, some of them on a gold ground and with
well preserved colours, possess no artistic value. Above a door to
the right of the high—altar, engraved in wood, is the Coptic inscrip-
tion, ‘Greetings to the Temple of the Fatherl’ Below it is a mod-
ern Arabic inscription with the date 1195. — This church may be
regarded as the original model of all the older Egyptian-llyzantine
churches in which the Coptic Christians now worship 1-.
