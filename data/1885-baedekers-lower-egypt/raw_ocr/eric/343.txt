to the dead, most of them in good preservation.

111 the middle of the 5. Wall: *9t5. Statue of Ra—ne/‘cr, a p1iest,
wearing a wig (in limestone). rl‘he muscles of the arms and breast
are executed with gieat realism, and the statue ranks among
the most perfect specimens of Egyptian art (5th dyn. , Sakhz‘ira).
— To the right 974. Basaltic statue of King Khefren at a mole
advanced age than in No. 3961 (p. 304)); the statue, which was

sarcophagus' 1n rose— coloured granite of great antiquity, which once

The sides recall the domestic rather than the sepnlchral style of archi-
tecture, hut in Egypt these styles were similar in many respects. The
ancient Egyptians used to call their earthly dwellings ‘inns’ or ‘lodgings‘,
while they styled their tombs ‘evcrlasting houses‘. The ends of the beams,
resembling triglyphs, should be noticed.

965. Similar but plainer sarcophagus, prepared for Prince
Hirba'if. 970. Similar sarcophagus with the angles rounded, bear-
ing the name of Prince lx’amskhem. These three sarcophagi were
