“’0 now turn to the left and enter the —

Salle historique de l’Ouest. This room contains historical stcles
of various epochs and also the monuments of the period of the
Hyksos (p. 88), which is represented in Europe by a solitary head
in the Villa Ludovisi at Rome. — In the centre of the room: ““107.
Ilyksos Sphinx in black granite, from Tanis, the restored parts re—
cognisable by their darker hue.

The head shows the coarse and foreign-looking features of the race
which oppressed Egypt for so long a period. An inscription on the right
shoulder, almost eﬂ‘aced, mentions Apepi (Apophis), one of the last Hyksos
kings. Merenptah. the Pharaoh of the Exodus, and Ramses ll. sub-
sequently caused their names to be inscribed on the base, and Psusennes=
ot‘ the Elst dynasty, engraved his on the breast of the statue.

106. Head of a sphinx, resembling No. 107, with the name of
Merenptah, added at a later date. — 108. Sacriﬁcial tablet of black
granite, with the name of the Hyksos king Apepi. — 100. Torso
of a Hyhsos statue in grey granite, found at Mit Fares in the Fayr‘nn,
and thus proving that the Hyksos dominion extended at least as
far as this district.

1‘23. Double statue of grey granite, found at Tanis and dating
from the Hyksos period.

Two foreign-looking ﬁgures are standing before the sacriﬁcial tables,
which are lavishly adorned With aquatic plants (Baskhuz'u), ﬁshes, and
birds. The features of the ﬁgures resemble those of the sphinxes; their
matted beards, their plaited hair, and the bracelets on their arms dis-
tinguish them strongly from the ﬁgures on other Egyptian monuments.
The name of Psuscnues. engraved both on the front and on the back of
the monument, was added at a. later date.

=l““89. Stale of the Diadoch, in black granite, found in 1870
among the ruinous foundations of the mosque of Shékhr‘m in Cairo.

in the arch above the proper inscription is a representation of Pto-
lemy I. Lagi (p. 96), before his accession to the throne. 110 is still styled
a ‘satrap‘ here, but the empty eartouches adjoining his tigurc seem to
indicate that he is free to ascend the throne. On the left he is consecrat-

ing to Horus, the avenger of his father. a. piece of planted land x

and on the right he is presenting gifts to Isis-Butt], the tutelary goddess
of the cities of l’eh and Top. The inscription extols the satrap Ptolemy
as a hero, who brought back from Asia to the Nile the treasures removed
from the temples of Egypt, and who ﬁxed his residence in the ‘Foi-tl'ess
of Alexander 1., which was formerly called Itlzalrotis’ (Le. Alexandria).
llis victories over Syria and the western regions of Egypt, and his be-
neﬁeenue to the gods of Egypt are also praised, and there follows a eulo-
gium of his liberality in renewing a grant to the goddesses (Le. to the
priests) of the cities of Feb and Top, the so-ealled quarters of Buto,
whose worship had been abolished by the ‘Arch-enenry Xerxcs‘.

”127. Celebrated monument of the time of Thotlnncs 111, in
black granite [19th dyn.; Karnak).

The upper part. of the inscription was erased by Klm-cn-atcn, who
overthrew the worship of Ammon in Thebes, or by some other early
monarch. but was afterwards restored. perhaps by Ramses 11. The truces
of this double change are distinctly visible on the npperhnlf of the stele.
Below is an inscription in ‘25 lines celebrating the victories of Thothmes III.
in a highly poetic manner. This monument was often copied by sub-
"equent dynasties to celebrate the exploits of Seti l. and Ramses lll.
