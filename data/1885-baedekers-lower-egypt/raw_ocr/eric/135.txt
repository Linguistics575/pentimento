or [4) 3% . The readingis, however, facilitated by the fact that,

in order to ensure the correct pronunciation of each syllabic sign,
none but the most deﬁnite sounds were added to it. The symbol {ll—ml,

men, for example, is never written R Iﬂl, asit might be, but al-
most invariably ﬂ or £5 . It represents a chess—board with

ﬁgures. The ideographic signs, or determinatives, are placed as
explanatory adjuncts after the phonetically written groups. They
are indispensable in elucidating the signiﬁcation, for the Egyptian
language, having been arrestedinits development, is poor, and full
.4

of homonyms and synonyms. The symbol WW (ink-h, for ex-

ample, means ‘to live’, ‘to swear’, ‘the ear’, ‘the mirror”, and ‘the
goat’. The reader would easily fall into errors, such as mistaking
ﬁnk]; nefer for ‘a beautiful life’ instead of ‘a beautiful goat‘, if the
determinative, or classhsign did not come to his aid, and show to
what category of ideas the object belonged. Thus, after dnkh, the
goat, the Egyptians either placed a ﬁgure of that animal, or a piece

of hide with a tail , which served as a common symbol for all
quadrupeds. The symbol used to represent a particular word is
termed a special, while one chosen to denote a class is termed a

general, determinative. An elephant [5% placed after the group
of.__u , 6b, ‘the elephant’, is a special determinative, while a

lock of hair in placed after “k smem, ‘the mourning, is a

general determinativ,e a lock of hair being the conventional emblem
of grief, as the men \\ ere in the habit of cutting off their hair 111
token of sorrow. A word is frequently followed by several deter-

minatives. Thus ESE! ﬁsh is ‘the cedar’; but the wood of the
tree being scented, the group representing ﬁsh was not only fol-

lowed by the ﬁgure of a tree ,but also by th ue symbol G, which

signiﬁes that a perfumed object is spoken of. The special deter-
minative always precedes the general. Symbols that were not
capable of being very clearly engraved on stone “ere sometimes
omitted, and. the special determinative given alone. Instead of
