it lies another victim already slain. The inscription above this
scene informs us that the young bull sacriﬁced here would, ‘accord-
ing to the judgment of the man skilled in slaughtering’, yield
50 men, or pets [pro-

the oﬂering of gifts, a number of servants, and other scenes. There
are no ﬁgures on the S. side. Those on the W. side are well pre—

original size.
