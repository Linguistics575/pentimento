source of great proﬁt to the citizens. Several regular steamboat
services and two telegraphic cables now connect Alexandria with
linsepe, while it communicates with the rest of Egypt by river,
railway, and telegraph. The town suffered severely during Arahi’s
rising in 1882, and a great part of the European quarter was laid
in ashes by the fanatical natives. Owing to the continued state of
political uncertainty and the delay of the Egyptian government to
pay an indemnity, little has been done to repair the mischief, and

the spirit of enterprise seems for the time being completelylamed.

Gas AND \VA'rEn. The city was provided with gas in 1865), and is also
now well supplied with water. The old cisterns, the number of which
is said still to exceed a thousand, and the situation of which enables us
to determine the direction of the ancient streets, have been superseded
by the modern waterworks, completed in 1860, which are supplied by the
)lnharrem-Bey Canal, a branch (if the llahmﬁdiych Canal. The reservoir,
into which the water is pumped by steam, after having been ﬁltered,
is situated on the top of the Kt'nm ed<Dik hill. the site of the i’aneurn
of antiquity (p. 210). and is capable of containing 10,000 cubic metres of
water (about 360,000 cubic feet). The water-rate per cubic metre [36

llAPBOURS (comp. pp. 203, 208). The maritime trafﬁc of Alexandria
is Of or isidcrablc importance, although it is said to have decreased since
the opening of the Suez Canal. The port is entered annually by about
2000 vessels. In 1883, which was commercially a somewhat dull year,
the value of the imports was 7,500.0001.., of the exports 12,150,000l., the
former paying 1353,0001. and the latter 520,0001. of duty. The most im-
portant export is cotton, of which 2'/2-‘23/4 million cwt. are annually dis-
patched. Next in order are cotton-seed, grain, leguminous seeds, sugar,
and onions; and lastly we may mention the not unimportant items of
elephants‘ tusks, ostrich feathers, and niothcr-of—pearl. England possesses
the lion‘s share of the trade and shipping, next in order coming France,
Germany, and Austria.

Alexandria now contains a population of upwards of r200,000
souls, including at least 50,000 Europeans. in its pallny days it
is said to have numbered more than half—a-million inhabitants,
consisting of Egyptians, Greeks, Jews, l’htrnicians, and ltalians,
all of whom were animated in common with the spirit of enterprise
which attracted them to the recently founded city. The Greek ele—
ment predominated at that period, next in importance to which
was the Egyptian, while a numerous, but exclusive. Jewish com-
munity was settled here as early as the 11th cent. ”.0. According
to tradition the Gospel was ﬁrst preached to the Alexandrians by
St. Mark, and it is an historical fact that the Christian conununity
was already numerous in the time of lladrian (2nd cent). in a
letter to Servianus the emperor himself gives a very unfavourable,
but hardly accurate account of the Christians.
