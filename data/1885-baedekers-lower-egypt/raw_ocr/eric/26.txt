[3]. Passports. Custom House.

l’ASSl‘ORTS are usually asked for at all the Egyptian ports, and if
the traveller is IIIIprovided with one he is liable to detention and
great inconvenience. The passport is given up at the custom-house
and reclaimed at the traveller’s consulate.

per cent of the estimated value is charged. Considerable difﬁculty
is also made ahont admitting ﬁrearms and cartridges. The custom-
house is now under European management, and it is on the whole
advisable to refrain from an attempt to facilitate matters by bals—
slIislI (p. 16).

()n all goods- exported, one per cent of duty is charged on the
estimated value, and luggage is accordingly examined again as the
traveller quits the country. The exportation of antiquitiesis strictly
prohibited (’p. ‘25]. lfluggage be forwarded across the frontier,
the keys must be sent with it; but, if possible, the traveller should
always snperintcnd the custom-house examination in person.

[4). Consulates.

Consuls in the East enjoy the same privilege of exterritoriality
as ambassadors in other countries. A distinction is sometimes made
between professional [‘consules missi’) and commercial consuls,
the former alone having political functions to discharge ; and there
are consuls, vice-consuls, and consular agents, possessing various
degrees of authority. In all cases of emergency the traveller should
apply for advice to the nearest consul of his country, through whom
the authorities are most conveniently approached, and who will
(‘lrf‘cillﬂiiy watch over his interests. it is therefore very desirable
that travellers should take the earliest possible opportunity of en-
tering into friendly relations with these most useful ofﬁcials, and
the more so as access to some ofthe principal objects ofinterest cannot
be obtained without their intervention. The kavasses, or consular
IIl'llccrs, also render important services to travellers, for which they
expect a fee, although not entitled to demand payment
