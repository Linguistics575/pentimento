honour of Osiris, is probably identical with a sheet of water to
the N. of a huge wall enclosing an open space, on the E. side of
which the wall is upwards of 500 yds. long and nearly 65ft. in
thickness. The outline of thelake was probably once elliptical,
but is now of very irregular form. On its SE. side rise vast heaps
of rubbish, marking the site of the royal palace and the temples
connected with it. It is, however, impossible to trace the outline
of a single building, either here or among the ruins between
the village of st: el-Hager and the enclosing wall of the Acropolis,
lying to the N. of the cluster of humble fellahin dwellings which
have inherited the proud name of Sais in the form Sa. Mariette’s
excavations at this spot brought a few antiquities to light, but
led to no discovery of importance.

44 M. FROM ALEXANDRIA T0 Room“ by railway in 21/2 hrs; far-es
33 pias., 2‘3. pias., 13 pics. 10 paras (two trains deny). The station is out.-
side the Porto Moharrem-Bey, whence the Cairo trains also new start (see
p. 206), — Fuen DAMANIIflR (p. 224) T0 Rosu'r'rn is a journey of one day
only, but the start should be made at an early hour. As far as Fumm
el-Mahznﬁdiyeh a donkey takes 21/2-3 hrs. [charge about 1i in); thence to
Rosetta by boat in 5-7 hrs., according to the wind (20-30 fr.-, or. including
stay, which must be specially bargained for, and return, about double
that sum).

FROM ALEXANDRIA T0 ROSETTA there is a recently opened
railway. skirting the coast, from which short branch-lines are to be
constructed to the various coast fortresses. The famous towns which
lay on this coast in ancient times have entirely disappeared. As far
as Sidi Gaber (p. 223), the second stopping-place, the train runs
parallel with the railway to Cairo, which then diverges to the right,
while our line follows a N.E. direction. The next station of any
importance is [61/2 M.) Hamlch (p. 2‘22; the station lies 1/2 M.
to the E. of the town). Stations Et—llloltummadlyeh and ‘Ambet es-
Siyr‘tf, the latter of which is a considerable village. Near (91/? M.)
Et-Mandara the train enters upon the neck ofland which separates
the Lake of Abnkir (Behérct Ma‘acliyeh) from the Mediterranean, and
reaches (1‘2. M.) Abukir [G M. to the N.E. of liamleh), an insigni—
ﬁcant village, famous for the naval battle of '1st Aug. 1798, in
which the English ﬂeet under Nelson signally defeated the French,
destroying thirteen of their seventeen vessels. The precise site of
the ruins of Heracleopolz‘s and Canopus is unknown. The latter,
which lay 120 stadia from Alexandria, was probably situated a
little to the E. of Abukir. Between that village and an opening in
the neck of land which separates Luke Edlcu. from the sea are some
heaps of ruins which perhaps belonged to the ancient Canopus.

The city of Canopus, which, according to the decree of'i‘anis (p. 3131
passed here, was known by the sacred name of Pakol, and by the popu—
lar name, still existing in the Coptic language, of Knit en-ZVub, or
‘golden soil”7 was a very famous place in ancient times. The resemblance
of the name Kahcnnub to Canebus , the helmsman of Menelaus, gave rise
