shirt, and ill “inter a light-coloured striped Woollen mantle, while
the liisharin and Iladendoa tend their large ﬂocks of sheep and
herds of camels in a half-naked condition, girded with aleathern
apron and wrapped in a kind of blankethelﬁyeh). All these ‘Ethio-
piaus’ are Dolichocephali, with orthoguathous skulls, and are re-
markable tor their ﬁne and almost Caucasian cast of features, their
very dark, bronze-coloured complexion, and their luxuriant growth
of hair, shading their heads like a cloud, or hanging down in num-
berless plaits over their necks and shoulders, while in front it is
short and curly. Their ﬁgures are beautifully symmetrical, and
more or less slender in accordance with their means of subsistence,
and their limbs are gracefully and delicately formed. In other re—
Spects they resemble all the other children of the desert, as in the
purity of their complexion, the peculiar thinness of their necks,
and the premature wrinkling of the skin of their faces. Com-
pared with their bold and qnarrelsome neighbours the llisharin, the
Ababdeh, who are armed with a dagger worn in a sheath attached
to the upper part of the left arm, or with a long, straight sword,
but never with a gun, are exceedingly gentle and iuoﬂeusive. The
Egyptian government has put an end to the old feuds between the
llisharin and the Ababdeh by entrusting to the latter the superin-
teudence of the great commercial route through the Nubian desert
(from liorusko to Abu llammed), and by placing the nine tribes of
the Iiisharin under the jurisdiction of the chief shiikh of the Ahab-
dch, who is personally responsible for the safety ofthe routes through
the, desert, and is therefore obliged to reside in the valley of the
Nile. (llis present headquarters are at the small village ofliehﬁreh,
at the foot of the hill of liedesiyeh, Opposite to Edfu.) The total
number of the Ababdeh amounts to about 30,000. The chief
Shtl’iiil whose dignity is hereditary, appoints over the principal vil-
lages a number ofslili~chiel's, who are appealed to asljudgesiufamily
quarrels which the head of the family has been unable to settle.

The dwellings of the Ahabdeh consist oflow and miserable hovels
«constructed ofstakes covered with ragged straw-mats, and placed in
groups of not more. than Ai-H' together. They also sometimes live in
caves, like genuine Troglodytes, although exposed to danger from
snakes. Like. the other Boga tribes, they are chiefly occupied as
shepherds and camel-drivers. The wealthier purchase a little sorgh-
um grain, which they eat either raw, or roasted, or in the form of
unleavened cakes, but the poorer seem to haveamarvellouspower of
sustaining life on hommopathically minute quantities ofgoats’ milk
and the, game which they occasionally capture. The ltisharin alsolive
