”no of the most interesting of these is the copy of ' tlul e1--I.‘mzdt.writ

for age than beauty To the superscription of each sﬁreh are added boUt
the number of verses and that of the words and letters it Contains, besides
traditional utterances of the Prophet connected with the chapter in
question. — a most laborious piece of work, resembling what has been
done by Jewish Scholars in preparing copies of the tlld Testament.
Another copy, dating from [535 of the llcgira, 123/.) by 1111/. inches, whiclt
once belonued to the mosque of Husen, has its titles in gold but it is in

Next in interest is a l_{oran of Sultan Jlolmnuned erz-lllisir ibn Sr’ﬂdtlin
Italmhz (1293-1341), 21 by [4 inches. written by Ahmed lﬂsuf, :1 Turk, in
130 of the llcgira. It is written entirely in gilded characters and there
is also a second copy of a similar description. Several other Koriins date
from the reign of Sultan S/m‘btzn (1363 7?) gr randson of the last named. to

11711135. Another and still larger copy, dating from the same year, measures
323/1 by 21 inches. All these last were destined for the school in the
[17:11” et-Tabbzineh [street of the straw—sellers). founded by Ii'hondnbaral'rt,
the sultan's mother. Lastly we may mention another copy written in
775 11) order of the same prince, by ‘Ali ill/t Moltammed cl llakuttib. and
gilded by Ibrahim el— —Amedz', from which we gather that these liorans
were sometimes the work of several ditTerent hands. This copy measures
21“ by 201/4 inches, and above each sureh is recorded the number of
words and letters it contains. All these maszihif are written on thick
and strong paper, and vie with each other in magniﬁcence. The designs
exhibit no great variety, but they are e\ccuted with the most elaborate
care and neatness. 'lhe text of these Korans is provided with red letters
written aboye certain passages to indicate \1 here the tone of the readers
VIIiL‘C is to be raised, lowered. or prolonged.

The collection contains three Korans of the reign of Sulti‘tn Brlrlﬁk
(13"‘2—99). the oldest of which, cxecuted' 111 709. measures it by 32 inches. it

tan‘s reign, and of similar size, has its first and last pages restOred in the
same style as those of other copies, but the modern workmanship is
inferior to the ancient. A smaller Koran, of the \ear SUI measuring 23
by 191/2 inches, is written entirely in gilded characters.
