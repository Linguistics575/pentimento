When the work of the day is over, the solemn and sonorous cry
of the mneddin, summoning the faithful to prayer (see p. 147),
reverberates from the tops of the minarcts; but much of the
busy street-trafﬁc goes on till nearly midnight, and during the
month of 11111111115111 it even continues throughout the whole night,
while the barking of hungry dogs and the braying of donkeys fre-
quently form an additional interruption to repose. At a very early
hour in the morning the same scenes reeommcnee, and 011 leaving
his hotel the traveller is tempted to believe that Cairo is celebrat-
ing a never—endingr Carnival.

While peranibulating the streets of the city the traveller will
frequently have occasion to observe the Schools (Icuttt’tb), which are
open on the side next the street, and one of which is attached to
almost every public fountain. He will ﬁnd it very amusing to watch
the etforts of the ﬁltih, or schoolmaster, in teaching his pupils with
the aid of admonitions and blows, while the boys themselves re—
cite verses of the Koran with a swaying motion of their bodies,
bending over their metal writing-tablets, and yet ﬁnding time for
the same tricks as European schoolhoys. Unless the visitor has an
order of admission from the minister of public instruction, it is not
advisable to watch the ﬁiyih too closely. as he is easily disconcerted
and is then apt to he nncivil.

These schools all have :1 purely religious character, and are exclusive-
ly creations of 112-1 Islam. The more reading and recitation of verses trom
the Koran being' 111 itself considered a meritorious act, the great object or
these schools is to teach the pupils to recite the Koran by heart. Each boy
is provided with :1 copy 01 the «111111 hook, if he can all'nrd to buy one,
an ink and pen ease (rlmuiyeh), and a tablet of metal or of wood painted
white. After learning the alphabet, the pronunciation and the values of
numbers. he is then taught the ninety-nine ‘heautiful names of Allih‘
contained in the Korﬁm a, knowledge of which is necessary to enable him
to repeat the ninety-nine prayers of the Mohammedan rosary (sehhal.
The hoy is then made to write out the 11tit/_1a.or ﬁrst chapter {sureh}
of the Koran, which he reads often enough to impress it perfectly on
his memory swaying his liody to and fro the while, wherchy, as he
imagines, his memory is rendered more pliant. After learning the ﬁrst
chapter, he next proceeds to learn the last, the last but one. and the
others in the same inverted order, until he reaches the second, the rea-
