us, ‘caused this monument to be erected to his gods in indestructible
characters‘. Among the domestic animals are several cattle of very
bright colours. We also notice a gazelle held by the horns by a butcher,
who is cutting 1111‘ its head. Oﬁeﬁngs of wine were also made at this
early period. In the passage leading to the some}, is a group of labour-
ers busily at work. The hunting-scenes are curious, and, notwithstanding
their simplicity, remarkably true to nature. Among them is a. g1eyhound
seizing a gazelle by the leg, and another carrying a long— eared hare

”few paces to the N. E. is another mastaba built of well hewn blocks
oflixnestone. The hieroglyphics and low reliefs. resembling those in
the tomb of Ti at Sahkarah, are admirably executed. The deceased in<
torred here was named Khent, and his wife Mara. Traversing the vesti-
bule and a narrow passage, we reach a tomb-chapel with a sacriﬁcial
table, in the passage, on the right, is a handsome male ﬁgure with a
lasso, and on the left are stone-masons, engaged in making sarcophagi.
On the left, in the innermost niche of this tomb, we perceive the de-
ceased, and on the right, his wife. We next come to a ruined mastaba,
and to another tomb, half excavated, which was constructed for Raha-
tep, a son of Snefru, one of the highest civil and military dignitaries of
the kingdom, and. his wife Nefert, a relation of the royal family. The
statues of this married couple, who died young, or at least are so reprc‘
scnted, which are now among the principal treasures of the museum of
Gizeh, were found here. Farther to the \V. are several other tombs, new
covered up.

On the right bank of the Nile, opposite Rikka, upwards of 3 M. in-
land, is situated the small town of Atﬁh, where a heap of earth and
broken pottery represents the scanty remains of the ancient Aphlodito-
polis, the territory of which, according to Strabo, adjoined that of Aean‘
thus (Dahshur), while its capital lay on the Arabian bank of the Nile.
The city of Aphrodite must have been the same as that of the Egyptian
Hathor, to Whom also was sacred the white cow, which, as Straho ine
forms us, was worshipped here. The monuments, however, show us,
that in the nome of Aphroditopolis, Horus, the son of Isis, was more
highly revered than any of the other gods, among whomuHathor must be
included. At an early period the Coptic name of the place was Tpeh,
from which Atho, and the \rahian name Atﬁh are derived

About A. D. 310 the city of Aphroditopolisg grained some celebrity from
St Anthony, the anchorite, who took up his quarters among the moun-
tains to the E. of the town. So many devotees of every class made pil-
grimages to him, that a regular high-road, practicable for camels, had to
be constructed, which led the pilgrims through the desert to the cell of
the hermit, situated near a group of palms and a spring. The saint,
however, escaped from his visitors, by retiring farther into the heart of
the mountains (see below).

Near the village of Zdwa'yeh (W. bank) a small canal runs out of the
Nile into the Bahr Ydsuf (p. 456); a deep cutting also seems to have
connected the river with the Bahr Yﬁsuf in the latitude of Abnas el-
lllediueh and Beni Suéf. These four channels enclosed an island which
has been identiﬁed with the Ilel'ucleopolitrm Nome, unanimously de«
scribed by Greek authorities as an island. Straho, who visited it on
his way to the Fayﬁm, after leaving the Nome of Aphroditopolis,
describes it as a large island, and informs us, that the inhabitants of
Heracleopolt's worshipped the ichneumon, the greatest enemy of the croco-
dile, which was held sacred in the uomc of Arsinoe; for, as he tells us,
it crawls down the throat of the sleeping monster and devours its
entrails. The large hills of rubbish near Ahnus el-Jledmeh have been
satisfactorily identiﬁed with the ruins of Heracleopolis- they lie about H M.
inland from Beni Sucf, and are called by the Arabs l/mm el- Kimz‘m [‘mother
of the heaps of rubbish”). A11 excursion to them, however, is not recom-
mended, unless the traveller is visiting Beni Suéf from the Fayﬁm.

0n the W. bank of the Nile the mountains recede a considerable
distance, while on the E. bank theix steep and lofty spurs frequently ex-
tend down to the bank in not unpicturesque forms. None of the Nile
