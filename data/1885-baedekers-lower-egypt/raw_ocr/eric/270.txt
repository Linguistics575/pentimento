The above outline will serve as a guide to those who are pressed
for time; a more leisurely visit may be arranged as follows: —

Frus'r DAY. Forenoon [by carriage, or on donkey-back): *Citadel
(p. 262), with *View of Cairo, and visit to the Gami‘ Mohammed
'Ali; Gamir Sultan Hasan (p. 260); Gami’ ibn Tulﬁn (p. 265);
Bab ez-Zuwéleh (p. 272); Gami' el-Muaiyad (p. 272); street and
mosque ofEl-Ghﬁri (p. 274). — Afternoon: drive on the'Abbﬁsiyeh
road to lgubbeh, Illatariyeh, the Virgin’s Tree, and Heliopolis (p.332).

SECOND DAY. Forenoon (on donkey-back) : Bazaars (to which a
whole day may also be devoted on foot); Muristan Igalaun (p. 275);

noon (on donkey-back, starting early in winter): Moses‘ Spring
and the smaller Petriﬁed Forest (p. 337), returning by the Mo—
hattam (view of Cairo by sunset), and past the Citadel (p. 336).

FOURTH DAY. lv‘orcnoon: Mosques of El-Azhar (p. 287) and
liasanén (p. 292), most conveniently visited in succession, as both
are shown by special permission only, and with the escort of a
hawwas. The same remark applies to the Gzimi‘ Seiyideh Zéuab
(p. 268), a visit to which, however, had perhaps better be omitted,
as its cituation is somewhat remote. The mosque of lEl-Azhar
should not be visited on a Friday, as there is no teaching on that
(lay, and the traveller would thus miss one of the chief attractions.
— Afternoon (by carriage»): Old Cairo (p. 317) and the island of
ltr‘nla (p. 318); llabylonrvith the early Christian churches (p. 320);
the, (tinni’ ‘Amr (p. 324); also, if time permit, the Imam Shafe'i,
lidsh el-ltasha (p. 327), and the Tombs of the Mamelukes, after
which we return by the quarter of the Tulunides (p. 265).
