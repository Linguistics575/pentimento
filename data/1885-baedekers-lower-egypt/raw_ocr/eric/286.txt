in the early Arabian style7 is a favourite subject with European

artists.

The prices of the carpets, like those of other Oriental goods, are
liable to great ﬂuctuation. Those of Baghdad and Brussa (in Asia Minor)
are the most sought after, but imitations, manufactured at Brussels, are
said to be not uncommon. They are chieﬂy remarkable for the bar-
monious arrangement of their colours. As soon as a purchaser appears,
the dealers spread their wares over the whole court for his inspection.
If the traveller is pressed for time he had better not attempt to make a
purchase, as several hours must not unfrequently be spent in negociation
before a satisfactory bargain is concluded.

Leaving this court, we cross the Sfik en—Vahhasin (see belOw)
in a somewhat oblique direction, and pass through a very insigni—
ticant gate into the Stilt es-Sﬁigh (pl. Siyttgh), or bazaar of the gold
and silversmiths, which consists of several crooked lanes, barely a
yard in width, through which the traveller will sometimes ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to thread his way. The occupants of these crowded alleys
keep their wares in glass cases or under glass shades. Their stalls
present a very poor appearance, but their ﬂlagree—work is some-
times very good. Spurious gold and silver wares are not unfrequently
sold as genuine. The bellows of the Silversmith are generally of
amusingly primitive construction, consisting of a conical bag of
goatskin, open at one end, where it is provided with wooden
handles, and terminating at the other end in a tube, usually an
old gun-barrel, which runs under a small mound of clay to the ﬁre.

The ﬁnest ninety-carat silver, which is never sold except in its native
condition, is frequently purchased with a View to the manufacture of plate
and trinkets in the house of the purchaser himself and under his immediate
supervision, in order that all possibility of fraud may be obviated. The
finest quality manufactured at the shops is the eighty—carat silver1 the
workmanship bestowed on which is usually worth a quarter to ahalftlle
value of the raw material; the next quality is the seventy-ﬁve carat; and,
lastly, there are inferior qualities containing ﬁfty per cent. or less of pure
silver. The silver manufactured at the shops ought to bear a govern-
rm-nt stamp, indicating the number of carats it contains. As soon as a
standard of price is agreed on, the article is paid for in accordance with
its Weight in dirhenr (drachms), and with its assay as stated by the seller.
The .qnality of the metal is then attested by a government official, who
is always in attendance. and the article is taken to the customs-office,
where a duty is exacted from the purchaser. The whole transaction is
therefore of a somewhat complicated character, and the formal attesta-
tion by the ofﬁcial atl'ords no guarantee whatever of the true quality of
the metal. The only satisfactory plan is to purchase the raw material,
and. like the natives of the country, get it manufactured under one‘s
persona] Superv'sion.

In the Jewish quarter, to the \V. of the Sﬁh’ es-Sﬁigh, are the booths
of the Jewellers (Cohort/{1127:}, where, however, there is nothing to see, as
they show their wares to intending purchasers only.

From this labyrinth of lanes we return to the Stilr en-Nahhasin.
or market of the copper-smiths, immediately to the left of which
are the imposing facades of several contiguous mosques, the ﬁrst
two of which contain the tombs of Sultan Jy'alaﬁn and his son Mo-
hauimed err-Nasir (p. 277). This bazaar presents little attraction, .
but one of the Arabian copper ink-bottles (tluwuych; 4-10 fr.,
