11dation, it descends to the Vicinity of the Delta. Crocodiles are some»
times seen fast asleep, often with widely opened jaws, basking in the
sun on ﬂat sandbanks or on the ends of low islands, to which they most
frequently resort after cool nights. ln Egypt, however, where it is oftener
hunted than in more southern regions, the crocodile is generally too
wary to he caught napping, though it sometimes becomes entangled in
the nets and fall: a prey to the ﬁshermen. The Arahs of the 511113111, who
eat the ﬂesh of the reptile and prepare a kind of musk from its glands,
frequently angle for it with large hooks haitud with meat.

It is seldom worth while to lire at crocodiles when swimming, as
they usually disappear in the tur‘oid water, even when mortally wounded.
The sportsman should therefore endeavour to get within range of one of
these monster saurians when on shore. As they always keep within easy
reach of the water, they are occasionally observed on the banks 11fthe
river by the traveller navigating the Nile, in which case they should he
approached in a small heat as noiselessly as possible. Success is most
likely to he achieved in cases where the haunt ()t' the reptile is known.
so that. tho sportsman may lie in anthush at some convenient spot in the
vicinity. Unless, as rarely happens, the ﬁrst bullet kills the animal on
the spot, it generally oontrlves to ﬁnd its way back to the water, and
thus effects its escape.

Another sanrian of great power, and extremely rapid in its move-
111e11ts, is the 11/11121‘!o1’(;\rah. 1111111111), which attains a length of 4-5 ft., and
derives its name from its supposed habit of giving warning of the ap-
proach of a crocodile.

111. OTHER MAMMALIA AND Bums. Although not indigenous to
Egypt, several varieties of Apes, which are imported from the S. a111l\V.
provinces, are seen in the larger towns. Among these are the ('ynoce—
p/«tlus lmmadryus and C.(uu1bis (both called “ml by the Arabs), the
[nuns ecttmlatus lAl‘itb. 115511125}, the Ce ercopltlmcus I'ltbcl', C'. J) tseo—vn 11111
and, more rarely, the (l. [lg/I'I'IIOIIUtle.

The Nile Valley and the neighbouring desert hills are largely in-
fested hy Burs (Arab. 11111510121), The commonest kinds are the Kalang
(Plat-opus), the Lmag-euretl 1:11! (Plecolas, l’espeI-tllia. T11111111z0us, lﬁ/cllnomzzs),
and the Spectre But (Rhinolaphus, Ail/cleris, Rhirtoponm).

Besides the beasts of prey already enumerated (p. 79], we may also
mention the illuslelu Afn'cmm, several kinds of Hedge/1017 (Erluaceus:
\rah. Irouzlzzl), and the Slum (Arab. 11:11:11 53.513.

Egypt contains numerous species of the RUDENTIA. The ﬁelds, dwel-
liug- houses, and sailing-vessels am often infested with Mice and Rats (illus,
Acomys), and in the Sinai Peninsula is found the Dormousc (Ellomg/s mr-
lmzurus), all of which are called far by the Arabs. The Jumping Mouse
(Dipus; Arab. 3121-1215611) and the Sand Mouse (Marianas.- Arah. gebelt‘) live
in the desert, and the “Fat Rut’ (I’mmmomys obesus) in the sandvhills
around Alexandria.

Besides the BIRDS indioenons to Egypt, there are, as already men-
tioned. a great number which winter there, while others merely pass
through the country when on their way to other regions. About 360 dif-
ferent species have been ascertained to occur in Egypt, but we shall
merely enummate a few of the most important of those which remain
permanently in the country.

The commonest Birds of Prey are the Golden l"ult1ue (Lv'ypzlétus merri-
dianulis; Aral]. big). the While-headed Vulture {l'ullurfutz'us; Aral). tulip),
the Eured Vulture (V. auriculﬂris), the Goose l‘ullm'e (V. cinereus), which,
however, is a bird of passage only, the Carrion Vulture (Neaphrau perc—
