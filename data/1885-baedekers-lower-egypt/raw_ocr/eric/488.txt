4.30 Route 7. THE SUEZ CANAL. From Suez

ilar project. In 1811 and 1817 Linant Bey, the viceroy’s engineer
of waterworks, and Messrs. Stephenson, Negrelli, and Bourdaloue,
demonstrated the inaccuracy of chére’s observations, and proved
that the level of the two seas was nearly the same, so that the
construction of a canal between them was possible. In 1854 M.
de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before Sa’id Pasha,
who was then Viceroy, and who determined to carry it out. Difﬁ-
culties were thrown in the way of the enterprise by the English
government during Lord Palmerston’s ministry, but on 5th Jan.
18:36 permission to begin the work was formally granted by the
viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the neces-
sary capital was raised, and it was not till 25th April 1858, that
the work was actually begun. The Viceroy undertook to pay many
of the current expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen, who were
to be paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate, and
were to be relieved every three months. In order to provide these
workmen with water, 4000 water-easks suitable for being carried
by camels had to be constructed, and 1000 of these animals were
daily employed in bringing them supplies, at a cost of 8000 fr. per
day. On r29th Dec. 1863 the fresh-water canal (p. 409) was com-
pleted , so that the company was thenceforth relieved of the
enormous expense of supplying the work-people with water. The
hands now employed, among whom were a number of Europeans,
were less numerous, and much of the work was done by machinery,
f 92,000 horse-power in all.

On 18th March, 1869, the water of the Mediterranean was at
length allowed to ﬂow into the nearly dry, salt—encrusted basins of
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of which lay 20—10 ft. below the
level of the Mediterranean, while the S. parts required extensive
dredging operations.

‘The ﬁrst encounter of the waters of the two seats was by no means
of an amicable character; they met boisterously, and then recoiled from
the attack; but soon, as if commanded by a “([1105 ego‘ of Neptune, they
peacefully mingled, and the ocean once more gained possession of the
land which it had covered at a very remote period, but only on condi-
tion of rendering service to the trafﬁc of the world‘. (Stephan)

The cost of constructing the canal amounted to about 19 million
pounds sterling, of which 1‘2 ,800,000 was paid by the shareholders,
while the rest of the sum was almost entirely contributed by the
Khedive. [In 1875, however, the British Government acquired the
Khedive’s shares for a sum of-i,000,000l.] The capital was raised in
the following manner: —

Original capital, in 400, 000 shares of r)0l. each . 8,000,000l.

Loan of 1867-06, repayablo in 50 years “by means
of a sinking fui1d . . . . . 4,000,0001.

Loan 01' 1871, repayable i1130 years . . . . . 800,000l.
Total: 12,800,000l.
