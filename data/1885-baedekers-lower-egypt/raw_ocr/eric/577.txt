that of the foundation of the monastery by Justinian (p. 503).
Between each pair of columns are rudely—carved choir-stalls. From
the ceiling are suspended three candelabra, which are lit at the even-
iug service and made to swing from side to side; also a hundred lamps
of every shape and size, some of which are adorned with ostriches’
eggs, and so low, that they may be reached with the hand. The raised
Tribune projects into the nave far beyond the choir. Awooden
Screen (‘septum"), coloured blue, yellow, and red, and overladen
with carving, with a broad gate ﬂanked with gilded columns and
rich ornamentation, separates the choir from the nave and aisles.
The large cruciﬁx, reaching to the ceiling, hears the ﬁgure of the
Saviour, painted in bright colours. The candelabra, placed in
front of the screen and covered With red velvet, stand on very an—
cient bronze lions of curious workmanship, perhaps executed be»
fore the Christian era. -— The beautiful rounded *Apse is adorned
with Mosaics of great value, executed by European artists as
early as the 7th or 8th cent. The most important of these, which,
like the others, is well preserved, is the *Tmnsﬁgumtion of
Christ, in memory of which the church was originally consecrat-
ed. In the centre of the mosaic the youthful and somewhat com-
monplace ﬁgure of the Saviour soars towards heaven. Elijah,
the prophet of Mt. Sinai, is pointing to the Messiah; St. John
kneels at the feet of his master; Moses points to the latter as
the fulﬁller of his law, and St. Peter lies on the ground, while
St. James is kneeling. Each ﬁgure is accompanied by the name
of the person it represents. A kind of frame is formed to this
picture by a series of busts of prophets, apostles, and saints in
mosaic, admirably executed: —-—

1. John the deacon; 2. Luke; 3. Simon; 4. James; 5. Mark; 6. Bar-
tholomew; 7. Andrew; 8. Paul; 9. Philip; 10. Thomas; 11. Matthew;
12. Thaddeus; 13. Matthias; Ll. I0 627m; ‘rjyou’ ever. the ‘Holy Superior‘

Above the apse, on the right, Moses kneels before the burning
bush; on the left, he stands before Mt. Sinai, with the tables of the
law in his hand. Between these scenes and the arch of the apse
hover two angels adjoining two medallion ﬁgures (perhaps Moses
and St. Catharine), which the monks point out as portraits of
Justinian and Theodora, although they do not in the least resemble
other portraits of the emperor and his wife. Under the scene of
the Transﬁguration is an inscription CE‘J dwinarr Harpb; ’mi Tioi

Longinus, the Presbyter and Superior of the monastery, for the
salvation of the souls of those who had contributed towards the cost
of the work.
