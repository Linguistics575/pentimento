DERVISHES (durwish, plur. dardrvish). The love of mysticism
\\‘lllI'il t'llarm'tcrises Mohammedans is due partly to the nature of
iii—Islam itself, and partly to external circumstances. That earthly
life is worthless, that it is a delusion, and at best a period of pro-
bation‘ are sentiments of frequent recurrence in the Koran. This
pessimist View of life has been conlirmed by Mohammed’s Concep-
rion of the Supreme Being, on whose awe-inspiring attributes he
has chielly dwelt. thus ﬁlling his adherents with a profound dread
of their Creator. The result of this doctrine was to induce devout
persons to retire altogether from the wicked world7 the scene of
Vanity and disappointment. and to devote themselves to the prac—
tice ot‘ ascetic exercises, with a view to ensure their happiness in a
future state. The fundamental aim of this ascetioism was to strive
after a knowledge of God by cultivating a kind of half—conscious and
ecstatic exaltation of mind. A mystic love of God was deemed the
great passport which enabled the worshipper to fall into this ecstatic
trance. and to lose himself so completely in contemplation as to
destroy his own individuality (fund) and blend it with that of the
Deity (illilidd). As in Europe the monastic system and the meridi-
cant, orders sprang from the example of penitents and hermits who
had renounced the world, so in the Mohammedan world asceticism
was rapidly developed into an organised system of mendicancy,
although in the Koran Mohammed had expressed his strong disap—
proval of the Christian monastic system. At an early period many
noble thinkers (such as the Persians Sa‘di and Haﬁz) and talented
poets enrolled themsdves in the ranks of the ast-eties, but the der-
vishes who represent the sect at the present day have entirely lost
the spirit of their prototypes, and have retained nothing but the
mere physical capacity for throwing themselves into a mechanical
state of ecstasy and rendering themselves proof against external
sensations.
