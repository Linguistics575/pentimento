the second wears the crown of Upper Egypt , and the third
that ofLower Egypt y, both representing Pharaoh as the monarch

of S. and N. Egypt respectively. The rope, hammer, and chisel
(implements which were still used in the time of the l’tolemies
whenever a foundation—stone was laid), which they hold in their
hands, show that the king was once present here to inaugurate the
opening of a new mine. The shape of the chisel is curious. The
fourth and ﬁfth ﬁgures represent Pharaoh chastising the miners.

The hill, about ‘200 ft. in height, opposite to the entrance of
the mines, is also worthy ofa visit. On the further side are the
ruins of Major )lacdonald’s house, and the summit is crowned with
the remains of a fort and of the mining settlement of the period of
the Pharaohs. Here also are found various tools ofﬂint, particularly
arrow-heads and sharp instruments , which were perhaps used for
engraving inscriptions. The old road, once used by the miners,
descending the hill and leading towards the 8., with a bend
towards the E., is still traceable. —— There is a spring about
‘25) min. distant from Major Macdonald’s ruined house.

li'ddi Naghrirrl, a station of [he Israeli/es during the Exodus. The
neighbourhood of the [his Abﬁ Zenimeh is believed by most expounders
of the Bible to have been the site of the camp on the Red Sea (p. 459).
The sacred narrative (Numb. xxxiii. 11) continues as follows. — ‘Aml
they removed from the Red sea, and cncamped in the wilderness of
Sin. 1?. And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
encamped in Dophkah.‘ 1n the book of Exodus (xvi. 1. el seq.) we ﬁnd
farther particulars of this portion of the journey. We are informed
there. that the whole of the people complained bitterly against Moses
and Aaron for having led them out of Egypt, accusing them of having
lrrought them ‘forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly
with liunger.‘

Many authorities identify the wilderness of Sin with the bleak coast-
plain of El»l_(:l‘a, which extends from lifts Abii Zenimch to Ttir and
beyond it; but it is more probably identical with the desolate, rocky
tract which we traversed on the route from This Ahﬁ Zenimeh to the
“Wadi Maghﬁra. Dophkah is the \Vddi. llaghiira. Enclosed l-y bleak and
abrupt rocks, the multitude, accustomed to the extensive plain, would
naturally be alarmed and depressed, and would murmur against their
leaders.

A little beyond the mouth of the ‘\ 'adi Maghara, the \Vadi Sidr
turns to the 5., skirting the Jcbel AbiZ'Alait-a (‘26‘23 ft.) , and after
fully an hour leads to a large table-land. To the E., opposite to us,
is the mouth of the Wﬁzli Neba', and to the S. lies the WadiMokat-
teb, i.e. ‘Valley oflnscriptions’, which we now follow. On the W.
side of this broad valley rises the Jebel Molmtteb (2380 ft), at the
foot of which, extending down to the ﬂoor of the valley, are strewn
blocks of sandstone, several of them bearing the famous so—called
‘lnscriptions ofSinai’. Most of them are on the western side of the
valley. Those who do not intend to make scientiﬁc investigations
need only devote a few minutes to the inscriptions in passing.

Most of the Sinaitt'c Inscriptions are in the Nahataean character, others
