in the Ezln-kiyeh, next dnm- to the Cafe de la Bourse. The last also keeps
a stock of good cigars. generally of Dutch or German manufacture. Hood
cigars cost 10 fr. per hundred and good tobacco AU fr. per olglga 11). ‘28).

Arabian Bazaars, see pp. ‘23, 251. Near the end of the Muski is a
shop kept by a Kubian, who sells various Egyptian and Nubian articles,
suitable for presents. Thus an ostrich-egg costs 3 fr. and upwards, a
specimen of the fahélta, or hall-ﬁsh (p. 8-1) 3-5 fr., a Nubian lance lfr.,
bow with six arrows [2—15 tr, small ﬁddle 12 fr., square fiddle 20 fr.,
leopard skin 15-30 fr. [the skins, however. are insufﬁciently tanned, and
almost entirely stripped of their hair). Unless the proprietor of this shop
happens to be in want of money, it is difﬁcult to obtain anything from
him at a reasonable price, and he sometimes closes his shop entirely. -
Stieks and whips of Hippopotamus Skin are sold by a Pole (who speaks a
little Italian) near the Roman Catholic church.

Arabian Woodwork is sold by “ arm's, an Italian. on the left side of
a court near the entrance to the )luski. Strangers should not fail to visit
his interesting workshop, which they may do without making any pur—
chase. Similar objects maybe obtained at a more moderate rate from
Venisio, opposite Shepheard‘s Hotel, and Bertim‘, adjoining the lldtel do
Nil; but their workmanship is scarcely so artistic as that of l’arvis.

The dates of the Religious Festivals of the Mohammedans, of which
Cairo is the principal scene, cannot easily be given according to the Euro-
pean computation of time, owing to the variable character of the Arabian
lunar year. Calendars reducing the Mohammedan and Coptic reckoning
of time to the European system may, however, be obtained at any book-
seller‘s.

The ﬁrst. month of the Arabian year is the Madam-em, the first ten
days of which ('ashr), and particularly the 10th (5/6212 worm-a), are eon—
sidered holy. On these days alms are distributed, and amulets purchased.
Mothers, even of the upper classes, carry their children on their should—
ers, or cause them to he carried, through the streets, and sew into the
children‘s caps the copper-coins presented to them by passers—by. 0n the
10th Moharrem, the highly revered 'Ashﬂru day. on which Adam and Eve
are said ﬁrst to have met after their expulsion from Paradise, on which
Noah is said to have left the ark, and on which l_Insén, the grandson of
the prophet, fell as a martyr to his religion at the battle of Kerhela, the
(tfimi‘ [Insanén (p. 292) is visited by a vast Concourse of religious de-
votees, whose riotous proceedings had better not be inspected except from
a carriage, especially if ladies are of the party. Troops of Persians in
long white robes parade the streets, cutting themselves with su'nrds in
the forehead until the blood streams down and stains their snowy gar-
ments. Two boys, representing l_lasan and l_lusEn, are also led through
the streets on hnrsehack. with blood-stained clothes. Strangers may also
obtain admission to the Persian mosque, in which the orgies are continued,
by special introduction. Towards evening :1 great zikr ot' whirling der-
rishes takes place here (p. 239).

At the end of iS'ufar, the second month, or at the beginning of Rain"
rl-meu‘el. the third, the Mecca CARAVAN (p. 143) returns home, its up-
lH'UilL‘II being announced by outriders. Some of the faithful who go to
meet the procession proceed as far as three days‘ iourney, but most of
them await its arrival at the llirket el-{Iagg (p. 33.”, or pilgrims‘ lake.
Detached groups of pilgrims occasionally return before the rest ofthe
cavalcade, and their arrival is always signalised by the blowing of trum-
pets and beating of drums. A pyramidal Wooden erection, called the
Jluhmat, hung with beautifully embroidered stnil‘s, and carried by a
camel, accompanies the procession as a symbol of royalty. The interior
of the .llalxlmal is empty, and to the outside of it are attachcd two copies
of the Koran. The procession usually enters the city by the 11d!) ell-Nasr
(p. 3"”). In 11/292 hrs. it reaches the lluméleh (p. 2152!, the largc open
space in front of the citadel, from which last twelve cannon—shots are
ﬁred as a salute. The eortége then sweeps round the ltlunéleh, and [in-
ally enters the citadel by the Bah e]-\\'e'/.ir (H. E, 2!. The departure of
“1': pil'rims (II. -Jl-S) is attended with similar ceremonies.
