usual resort of the family and their domestic animals in summer.
The walls of the yard generally contain round hollows, used as re-
ceptacles for the grain which forms the food of the family. Within
the yard are usually placed a square pillar, about '5 ft. in height,
with openings in its sides as receptacles for objects of value, and a
thick column of the same height, terminating in a platl'orm shaped
like a plate, with the edges bent upwards, which is used by the
proprietor as a sleeping-place in hot weather. The fact is, that
beneath an Egyptian sky, houses arc' not of the same paramount
importance as in more northern regions, all that is wanted being
shelter for the night.

The poorer peasants mode of life is frugal in the extreme.
’l‘he staple of his food consists of a peculiar kind of bread made of
sorghum ﬂour in Upper Egypt, or of maize in the Delta, wheatcn
hread being eaten by the wealthier only. This poor kind of bread
often has a greenish colour, owing to an admixture of beau-ﬂour
(li‘muum Grzecuni). Next in importance in the bill offare are broad
beans (fol). For supper, however, even the poorest cause a hot
repast to be prepared. This usually consists ofa highly salted
sauce made of onions and butter, or in the poorer houses of onions
and linseed or sesame oil. Into this sauce, which in summer
acquires a gelatinous consistency by the addition of the universal
bamia (the capsular fruit of the Hibiscus) and various herbs, each
member of the family dips pieces of bread held in the ﬁngers.
Both in town and country, goats’, sheeps’, or buffaloes’ milk also
forms a daily article of food, but always in a sour condition or half
converted into cheese, and in very moderate quantities only. In
the height of summer the consumption of fruit of the cucumber
and pumpkin species, which the land yields in abundance, is
enormous. in the month of Ramadan alone, when a rigorous fast
is observer] during the day, and on the three days of the great
leiram festival Ugorban ileiram), even the poorest members of the
community indulge in meat, and it is customary to distribute that
rare luxury to beggars at these seasons.

The dress of the Evyptian peasant calls forlittle remark, espec-
ially as he usually works in the ﬁelds divested of everything. The
chief articles of his wardrobe at other times are an indigo—dyed cot-
tou shirt (lcamig), a pair of short and wide cotton breeches, a kind
of cloak of brown, home-spun goats’ wool {zu‘bz‘tt, ‘ubdyeh, or 'abu),
or simply a blanket of sheep’s wool Hamlin), and lastly a close—
litting felt skull—cap (Lilldﬂh). He is generally barefooted, but occa-
sionally wears pointed red {zerbr‘m}, or broad yellow shoes (balgliu).
The shékhs and wealthier peasants, when they go to market, wear
\\ ide, black woollen cloaks and the thick red ‘Tunisian’ fez (tar-bash)
with a blue silk tassel, round which they coil a white or red turban
{’immch). In their hands they usually carry a long and thick stick
(million), made from the central stalk ot' the palm leaf.
