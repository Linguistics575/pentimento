37o Route 4. ABU ROASH. Environs

there are two long ‘mortar—pits‘ (Pl. m), and soon regain the
Kiosriue ot' the iihedive (p. 342), front which we started. rl‘he so—
called Tomb of Numbers tp. 366] is on the B. side 01‘ the plateau,
a little above the mud-huts of the Bednins.

Tho Prnamns on Am“: Rois“, the northernmost group in the Net-r0-
polis of Memphis, present little attraction. and are not worth visiting.
Standing in front of the viceroyal kiosque on the plateau of the Great
Pyramid of Urizch. we perceive towards the N. an abrupt ridge of rock
descending to a branch of the Nile. and to the right, at its base. two
villages shaded by palm trees. The nearer of these is Key-dam. the in-
habitants of which are occupied in cutting Hints for the primitive guns
still used in Egypt. The large quantities of splinters seen here suggest
to us that the so~called ‘llint tools‘ [1). 435) found in other parts of Egypt
may possibly be merely the refuse from similar workshops. Immediately
heyond Kerdﬁsa is Abii Roésh, which may he reached in 13/i-2 hrs. by a
route skirting the desert. 0n the margin of the plateau close to Ahﬁ
Ito-ﬁsh on the NW. side. rise the shapeless remains of a Pyramid of .lt'z'le
Mud. which is constructed round a nucleus of massive stone. On a ridge
of rock descending precipitously to the margin of the desert7 and reached
by a path ascending a hollow, near the white tomb of a shékh, and
1/4 hr. before the ltlud Pyramid is reached. are situated the remains of
two pyramids. One of these now consists of four or ﬁve courses of stone
only. and (according to Col. Vyse) contains a chamher reached from the
N. side by a passage inclined at an angle of 22°, and 53 yds. in length.
Each side measures 12/; yds. The other pyramid. to the \V. of the
last. is new a mere heap of ruins. A stone dykc, about 600 yds. in
length, leads from the N. to the hill on which these two pyramids stand.
Numerous fragments of granite strewn about here indicate that this ma.-
erial has been used either for the construction of the tomb-chambers or
for the external incrustation of the pyramid. No inscriptions were found
here. Distinct traces of a necropolis now entirely destroyed are observ—
able near these two pyramids. and also on the plateau ascending to the
\V. from the Mud Pyramid. The pyramids of Aln‘i Reash seem to belong
to one of the ﬁrst dynasties, but nothing certain is known about them.

Fuon Gizeu 'ro ABU§§R AND Songhai (p. 371) is a. ride of about
23/1 brs., skirting the margin of the desert. To the left lie patches of
cultivated land and a. number of ponds, containing more or less \ratcrin
accordance with the height of the last inundation. bordered with vegetan
tiou, and frequented by numerous hirds: beyond which ﬂows the Bohr
Ydsuf arm of the Nile (p. 456). After 1 hr. we observe the remains of
two pyramids on the right. The ﬁrst of these (NJ, near the village of
Zriwyet el-‘Arylm. must once have been an important monument, as the
sides are still nearly 100 yds. in length. The second (5.). near the hovels
of Riga, is now a. more heap of debris. ln one hour more, passing the
village of Shobet'ment, we reach the Pyramids of Abuslr (comp. Map,
p. 376]. the ancient Bush'is ['2 hrs. to the 5.8.15. of the Pyramids of Gizeh.
and 3/.1 hr. to the N.N.E. of Saiglgilra), situated on a rocky eminence cov-
ered with sand. The masonry of these monuments. having,r originally
been constructed with no great care. is now much damaged, and their
bases are covered with sand, so that a visit to them is uninteresting.
They were erected by kings of the 5th Dynasty. The entrances are on
the )7. sides. and. as in all the other pyramids . there is a passage , at ﬁrst
slanting and afterwards horizontal, leading to the chamber in the centre.
The northernmost of the three largest pyramids (once fourteen in numher),
lying close together. belonged to a certain Sahara, and was styled that
of the ‘glorious emerging‘ (Le. of the deceased into another world). At
u very curly period divine honours were accorded to this Pharaoh, and
Aarritices were otl'ercd to his wanes so late as the time of the l’tolemies.
'l'lu: pyramid was enclosed by a wall, to which it still traceable path as-
cended from a building (probably a temple] situated in the plain. lts
perpendicular height was 1631/2 t't. (now 118 ft._), its sides were 258'ln ft.
