572 THE TURQUOISE AND COPPER MINES.

fiitiwik hy a winding path, the traveller soon arrives at
Wittii Marattamah, near which is the famous Sarébit al-
khiidim.

To reach Sardhit al-Klint a climb of alyout :00 feet Ill) very
difficult ruad must be made "A scramble over a rough slide
" of loose sandstone at the upper end of the valley, tt
4h treacherous sloping, ledge of rock overhanging an awkward
I' precipice, and a steep ravine which brings into play all oac.'s
" gymnastic capabilities, leads to an extensive plateau hmken
If up h): many deep ravines and rising knolls," On um: uf the
small peaks is a heap of ruins of walls made of sandstone, and
round about are hmken columns and sandstone stelre, some
still ie rim, hut the greater numlier have fallen down : all these
are enchised by the ruins of all outer wall. In the reign of
tittien-hetep III n small rock-IWW" hittwtwdry was made here.
and furnished with an anttrchamlrur, until Thothmcs III
enlarged the building on the west. and added a small pylon,
with an outer court. Within the walls of these numerous stelm,
recording the lives and deeds of Egyptian oftkia1s, were set up,
and from time to time additions to the main building were. made
by later kings. The temple was dedicated to Hathor, the lady

the turquoise,“ who was also the presiding deity of Maghirah ;
in it were niches, intended tu hold statues; til" the higher mining
otiicials and military o0iccrs, hut these were all found to be
empty. The form under which this goddess Wits worshipped
was that of a cow, and the 'l molten t-alf" which Aaron made
(Exodus xxxii. 4) for the Israelites to worship during the
absence of Moses was, rm (lt'llllll, "fashioned with a grating
tool" into :1 resemhlance of Hathur. 'l'he Israelites, in fact,
induenced by the prevailing local worship of Hathur, forced
Aaron to fall in with the ctnttom of the natives of Sinai, and
gave him their gold ornaments to make the "molten calf."
The walls were ornamented with painted reliefs, and traces
of the inscriptions which tieserihed them, and recorded the
titles of the king and the names of his gods, still remain.
The outer wall encloses a space about Iys feet long and 70 feet
broad, and there is reason for believing that a sanctuary stood
here for more than 1,300 years, i.e., from the XIIth to the
XXth dynasty, during which period the mines in the neiglv
bourhood were worked by the Pharaohs with more or less
regularity. .

The mines were situated in the Wiidi Nas.b, and
between them and the temple the valley was otwupied by
the miners pnd try the s;lliers who guarded them, To
the east tint] west of the tcmple are mtumciS, one of which
is 500 feet long and 200 feet hruati, rm'ereri with layers of
slag which vary in thickpess from t2 ti-i-et at the haste. to 4 feet
at the tops 1 this slag is not natural. und authorities are agrced
in thinkingr that it rcprusctls the remains of the snu-tlting

Leaving the mines the mute is resumed in the With Stiwik,
and eventually Wtuti al-ljiomr is reached: this leads into
Wadi Shabékah. and in due c-mirse the traveller arrives at
Suez, In thehrief descriptions of the places, etc, passed on the
roads to and from Sinai no attempt has been made either to
trace the course of the Jametites in their journey to Sinai, or to
identify their halting places. A mere statement of the opinions
of one authority 01' another would be misleading in most cases,
and the space available here is too limited to admit the intro-
duction of general arguments. On one point, however, it is
important to state a few facts, via, the Sinaitic Inscriptions,
for the most extraordinary statements have been made about
them. According to the old traveller Cosmas Indicopleitstes
(am. 536) they were written by the Hebrews themselves, in
