AND ITS HISTORY. 545

1906, two Stat? ()fticers left Constantinople " Alexandria,
and on their arrival in Cairn they lodged in the house of the
Ottoman Delegate hlt‘lkhtar Prshi, and hettl nu communica-
tion with any member of the Egyptian Crorcrnment, or with
H.M.'s Agent and Ctmsul-ficneral. On March 4th they
suddenly left ll'ar ltét't'tt. whent‘t: they were lo proceed to
‘Ahabah. Meanwhile 'l'nrkish troops occupied libah, Al
iiattar, and Marashttsh, and tttidititnnul troops were dispatched
from [Jantrtstrus ant] tather Syrian tuwns It: the frutttier: It
herame evident that the "Chtomnn Ciovermncnt were abusing
" the patience of llN.'s (hwernntcut and tritlhtg with the
"question at issue." The hmmdury hetween Turkey and Egypt
at Rafah was marked by a [rug cm each side (If whirh was a
marble pillariahout this time the pillars were pulled down and
removed in the Turkish interest, The Report of the Officers
who had gone to 'Atcalrah was received UH April 21111. and was
found to bc "eminently unsatisfactory." lhe i’urit: then
referred the matter to Mitkhtar 1'rishri, who 111.111.in stated that
"the Peninsula of Sinai consisted only of the territury lying
Li south tal‘ a line drawn directly from Akalvah to Suez, and the
"boundaries between Egypt and 1urkey were lines drawn
"from Rahth tn Suez, and from Suex tu Akahah. A com-
" promise was hinted at by Mr1kltar P5151151. hy whose orders
G it is not clear, ofa frontier from R515 Mulyammad to Ar'Arish,"
According to Mtlkhtar Pishii's contention, the Turks would
have had the right to construct n strategic railway tn Suez,
and the effect of his compromise would have been to advance
the Turkish frontier to Nakhl, and to turn the Gulf of oucabah
into a mare tlaasum in the possession of 'rurkey, and into a
standing menace to the security of the trade mute to the East.
On April 3oth, the British Ambassador received instructions
toinform the Ottoman Government that ten days would be
given them to comply with the British demands, failing which
the situation would become grave. A fortnight huer the
Sultan gave orders for the evacuation of Tibah by Turkish
troops, and accepted the demands of I-LM/s Government.

In modern times thc antiquities of Sinai were discovered by
Niebuhr in 1762. and he published an account of them in
1774. They were. next examined hy Seetzen in 1809; by
Bontin in 1811 ; by Burckhardt in 1812 and1813; by Riippell
