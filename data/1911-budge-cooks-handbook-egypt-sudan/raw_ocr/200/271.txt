the Natron Valley, and acquired a number of Coptic MSS.
from the Monastery of Barartuls ; in 1837 the Hon, R, Curzon
also ohtttined several vellum MSS. at the monasteries, and in
1838 the Rev. H, Tattam purchased 49 Syriac MSS., which
he sold to the 't‘rustees of the British Museum, The same
year the Trustees of the British Museum sent Mr. 'l"attam to
Egypt to obtain the MSS, which were still thcre, and of these
he was so fortunate as to secure about 314. which arrived at
the British Museum in 1843. In 1845 M. A. Pacho (net the
traveller I’arhe, who committed suicide on Januarr 36th. 1829),
went and lived with the monks for six weeks. anti in the end
euceeetled in obtaining the remainder of the MSS, about 190
m number; 172 tofthcse came to the British Museum in r847,
to were sold to the Trustees in 135i, and M. Paehe kept
back and sold several to the Imperial Public Librarv in
St. Petersburg in 1852. All these MSS, really came front the
Convent of St, Mary Dcipara (llér Suryftni}, and the import-
ance of the Library cannot- be over-estimated, for it has
supplied us with some of the oldest dated hooks in existence,
has given us the Syriac Bible in several versions, the Epistles
of Ignatius, the works attributed to Clement, Patristie litera-
ture of all kinds, and a considerable number of native Syrian
works, most of which were unknown prior to the discovery
of the Library, As we are told that the Natron Valley
held about 100 monasteries during the sixth and seventh
centuries, it is not dieicult to imagine what literarv treasures
their Libraries must have contained. At the present time
there are no MSS. of importance in the Natron Talley, and
only those who are interested in archaeology are recommended
to visit it. The reader who is interested in the history of the
discovery of the MSS. should read Visits (a Motsatttrits sh
the Zevant, by the Hon. R. Curzon, 5th ed. 1365, p, 86,f;
an article by Cureton in the Quarterly Ramiem, No. CLIII,
p.51 , and the privately printed "Journal'' kept by Miss Platt,
who accompanied her stepfather, the Rev. H. Tattam, on his
journey in search of MSS. in 1839.

The Oasis ot Batpartyah, it'., the Northern Oasis, is
thought by some to represent the "Little Oasis," or the
" Seeond Oasis " of classical writers. This Oasis lies between
the parallels 27° 48' and 28° 3o'of north latitude, and between
the meridians 28° 35' and 29° ro' east of Greenwich, about

Messrs. Ball and Beadnell in 1902. This Oasis is really a large,
natural excavation in the Libyan desert plateau (Ball and
Beadnell, 2hrkaAa Oasis, Cairo, 1903, p. 37). Its greatest
iength is 30 miles, and its greatest width 25 miles. In 1897
it contained: apricot trees 4,863, olive trees 5,370, palms
