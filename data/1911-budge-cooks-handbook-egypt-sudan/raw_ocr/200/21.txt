Bakshish '. Important Notice.

The following notiCc has been issued "a--

The attention of the Egyptian autltoritics has heen frequently
drawn, both by visitors and lay residents in the :tnuittry, to the
evils resulting from the indiscriminate hestowul of " Iralishish "
to the inhabitants of the Nile villages, and nther places visited
by tourists during the winter season. The intention of the
donors is no doubt kindly, httt the practice-more especially
in view. of the yearly increaav of visitors to Egypt --cannot fail
to be detrimental to the moral sense and the social well-heing
M the poorer classes of the community. At the present time
many of the poorer inhabitants of those towns on the Nile which
are. most visited by tourists live almost entirely On what they
can obtain by ii haltshish” during, the winter months ; the easy
means thus offered of obtaining a small livelihood prevents
their adopting any form of labour: and children are brought
up to regard the tourist season as the period during which they
may, by clamnrous begging, enable their parents and thvmselves
to lead a life of idleness for the remainder of the year. The
unhealthy tendency of such a system is obvious.

On the other hand, from the point of view of the Nile
travellers themselves, the inconveniences of this universal
mendicity are equally obvious, and, as time goes on, unmet
fail to increase, unless some means are adopted for checking
the practice.

It would be extremely dithcult for the (lot'crnment to devise
an effective remedy for this state of things. The real remedy
rests with the travellers themselves. If money were,
in future, only bestowed in return for some actual
service rendered, or in cases of evident and estab-
lished distress, the present pernicious habit of begging would
soon die out, to the advantage both of the people and of the
\‘tsttors.

It is with this conviction that we 1tnture to express a hope
that our fellow-countrymen, when travelling in Egypt, will lend
their aid to this important reform by abstaining from the dis-
