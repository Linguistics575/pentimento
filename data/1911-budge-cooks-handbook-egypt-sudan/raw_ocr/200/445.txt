Near this place the Asua River juins the Nile, ahmit
100 miles from Gondokum.

At mile 608 is Nimuli, the Iieatiquarters of the Nile

Sir W. Garstin 5113's that it is tiltltiltftii G whether in the cataracts
‘hetween Shabluka and Aswiin any such deunonstrathm of
" the force and power of water is to he seen. The main
" volume of the river pmisos dtown the right-hand or eastern
" channel. Except in tiood the amount ofwatcrin the channel
li to the. left of the central island is insignificant. The scene from
the rocks on the right bank is an extraordinary one At the
" south end of the islands the rapids commence in two 111'
" more falls with a drop of some live or six mbtres, and a total
" width of about 60 mittrc.s. These break the surface of the
" river into a sheet of foam, hut it is only after they have been
"passed that the real struggle eemmenees. Below the falls
" the stream rushes down an extremely narrow gorge with a

very heav y slope, e111 losed between vertic al walls of rock.

This can hest lie cnmpared to a gigantic mill-. race or water-

slide 100 nfetres in length. The water tears through this

channel in a glassy, green sheet with an incredible velocity.
'The width of this 'gut' is nowhere more than 16 metres
across, and in places it is less! What the depth of the
water may be it is impossible to say, At the foot of this
race the river leaps into a deep cauldron or pot, which it fills
with an apparently boiling mass of white water, lashed into
foam and affording :1 remarkable example of the rage with
which water attacks any serious obstacle in its course. The
" length, of this cauldron is only 50 metres, but its width is
" not more than 12 mietrus across! Immediately below this
" the channel widens out to 5111111: 30 mktres, and eventually
" more, while thc river thunders down, in a series of rapids, for
" a considerable distance. It is difficult in words to give even
" a faint idea of this unique scene. The best photographs do
It not satisfactorily reproduce it. They cannot show the colouring
of the picture or really depict the wild beauty of the surround-
" ings. On either side of the channel are vertical walls of
