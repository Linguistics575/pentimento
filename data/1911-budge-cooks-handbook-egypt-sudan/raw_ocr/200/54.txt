For irrigation purposes '.owtyr itlgypt is divided into five
circles, The first itwdudtrrs the provinces on the right bank
of the Damietta arm of the Nile, anti four main canals;
the second includes nil the. land between the Dantietta
and Rosetta arms; tsl' the Nile, and has une main canal;
and the third includes the proviucc 0n the west bank of the
Rosetta arm of the Nile, and has tine main canal, All
these runals take their supply directly from the Nile, and
their water surface is generally from 10 t0 :5 feet below
the level of the surrounding eenntry. In 5899 the area of
Lower Egypt which was cultivated was nbout 3,430,000 acres,
and the yield was worth ,{23.475,c00 , and it has been calen-
lated that if the old system of irrigation enuld be restored the
value of the yield would he $31,000,000, " a gain of
£7,000,000 per annum.

The Corvée. A moment's consideration will convince
the reader that each year it is necessary to carry out a very
large amount of work in connection with the clearing of the
canals and the building up of dykes and embankments to keep
the waters of the Nile in their proper courses,- moreover, new
