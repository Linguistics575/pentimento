'stately public buildings tnagnificent temples, and rich donations
“nnd revenues to admiration; and he built all the private houses,
"some four, some five stories high. And to sum up all in a word,
bt he made it not only the most beautiful and stateliest city of Egypt,
It but of all others in the world. The fame therefore of the riches
Bt and grandeur of this city was so noised abroad in every place,
'l that the poet Homer takes notice of it:

I' * Nor Thebes so much renowo'd,
Whose courts with unexhausted wealth abound,
it i Where through a hundred gates with marble arch
ll ' To battle twenty thousand chariots martrh.'

II Although there are some that say it had not a hundred gates l but
ll that there were many large porches to the temples. whence the city
"was called /lecotompy/us, a hundred gates, for many gates: yet
44 that it was certain they had in it 20,000 chariots of war; for there
"were a hundred stables all along the river from Memphis to
"Thebes towards Lybia, each of which was capable to hold two
" hundred horses, the marks and si ns of which are visible at this
"day. And we have it related, t at not only this king, but the
“succeeding rinces from time to time, made it their business
II to beautify t is city ; for that there was no city under the sun so
"adorned with so many and stately monuments of gold, silver, and
'l ivory, and multitudes of colossi and obelisks, cut oat of one entire
"stone. For there were there four temples built. for beauty and
" greatness to be admired, the most antient of which was in circuit
" thirteen furlongs (about one and a half miles), and five and forty
"cubits high, and had a wall twenty-four feet broad, The Orna-
“inents of this temple were suitable for its magniMence, both for
" cost and workmanship. The fabric hath centiuued to our lime,
"but the silver and the gold, and ornaments of ivory and precious
"stones were carried away by the Persians when Cambyses burnt
ld the temples of Egypt. At which time they say those palaces at
I' Persepolis and Snsa. and other parts of Media (famous all the
"world over). were built by the Persians, who brought over these
"rich spoils into Asia, and sent for workmen out of Egypt for that
"purpose. And it is reported, that the riches of Egypt were then
"so great, that in the rubbish and cinders there were fouud and
tl gathered up above 300 taients of gold, and of silver no less than
'' 2,3oo, which was in the 108th Olympiad. There, they say, are the
"wonderful sepulchres of the antient kings, which for state and
41 grandeur far exceed all that posterity can attain unto at this day.
4h The Egyptian priests say that in their sacred registers there are
bt entered 47 of these sepulchres ; but in the reign of Ptolemy Lagns
" there remained only 17, many of which were ruined and destroyed
Fb when I myself cameiato those parts, The Thebans boast that they
" were the most antient philosophers and astrologers of any people
" in the world, and the Erst that found out exact rules for the
"improvement both of philosophy and astrology; the situation of

"to each month, and add 51, days to every 12 months ; and by this
fl means they complete the whole year ; but they add no intercalary
tt months, nor subtract any days, as it is the custom with many of
"the Greeks. But those of Thebes seem most accurately to have

"Next to the city of Apollo is Thebes, now called Diospolis,
tl 'with her hundred Rates, through each of which issue 20o men,
il 'with horses and chariots,' according to Homer, who mentions
"also its wealth; ‘not all the wealth the palaces of Egyptian
“‘Thebes contain.' Other writers use the same language, and
"consider Thebes as the metropolis of Egypt, Vestiges- of its
ll magnitude still exist, which extend 80 starlia [about nine miles) in

"from the art of the statue which remains in the seat and on its
"base. Willien t was at those places with Elius Callus, and
Il numerous friends and soldiers about him, I heard a noise at the
"first hour (of the day), but whether proceeding from the base or
"from the colossus. or produced on purpose by some of those
th standing around the base, I cannot c.?niitlentiy assert. For from
"the uncertainty of the cause, I are disposed to believe anything
"rather than that stones disposed in that manner could send forth
"sound, Above the Memnonium are tombs of kings in caves, and
'' hewn out of the stone, about forty in number ' they are executed
"with singular skill and are worthy of notice. Among the tombs
Ik are obelisks with inscriptions, denoting the wealth of the kings of
"that time, and the extent of their empire, as reaching to the
bl Scythians. Bactrians, Indians and the present Ionia; the amount
"of tribute also, and the number of soldiers, which composed an
'' army of about a million of men. The priests there are said to be,
"for the most part, astronomers and philosophers. The farmer
