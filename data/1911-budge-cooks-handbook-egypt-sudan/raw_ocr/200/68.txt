CHAPTER IX.
The Religion of the Ancient Egyptians.

THE. earliest proof that the Egyptians possessed rcligious
beliefs is afforded ly the prc-dynastitl graves which haw; been
excavated at ("'tchL-lL-n, Nukfuhth. AV/tlos, and other sites during
the last 17 yt-ttrs. In tllese, in addition to the human rcmains
which Acre deposited in them wither M wholu or disjointed
bodies, have hem: found jars and vases containing substances
which were intended to h'ervte as; food for tht: dcceascd on his
journey to 50th:: place tit" ttlmdc brynnri tht: grave, and 1ycaporvs
of flint whcrvwith ht: might Litrfcnt] himself against thc foes of
various kinds which he was t-xpcctud to must cm the road
thither. Thus it is ('Ilftlt' that the pre-dynastic Egyptians
hclim'utl that it man would enjoy lift: in 50111:; form, and in some
place to reach which they did thcir utmost to provitlc him with
means; it is Imihath that titty considered such (t life to he
merely It prolongation tTI' wmewal of the " which a man led
upon earth, and that they imagincd it would ittuludu joys and
pleasures. perhaps aicio rcwitrtls, ofa nuttcrial Character. Where,
however, that life was lircd, or the mttnnur of region in which
it was lived, Wt: himr no itluttns of knowing, and whether this
life after death was everlasting nr nut we know not. We may,
however, assumt- that the: belicfs of the primitive-' ligyptinns
resembled those of some of the peoples; and tribes of the. north-
east quarter of Africa, who live under the same vondititans as
theylived,andon land which is similar to theirs. Speaking
generally, it seems that the primitive Jtgyptians ttctiplmi earth,
air, river, and sky with spirits tir beings, some: of which were
benevolent and some ttmluvulcnt. and that to these they
attributed various dugrces: of pthr. The greater number
of such beings wen: probably regarded by thtrm its being or a
nature like tum: thcmsclvcs; and than: was perhaps a time
when the, I‘Igyptians did not hciicvc in thc L-xistvntrc of any
beings who wcrc different from themsuh'cs.

What is known of the religion of Egypt in dynastic
times suggests that in the earliest period of its history each
community possessed its own supurnarural huing or spirit, who
had his own peculiar form, and his own special manner of
making himself manifest, and it is pretty certain that the views
which the bulk of thecommunity held concerning him dictated
