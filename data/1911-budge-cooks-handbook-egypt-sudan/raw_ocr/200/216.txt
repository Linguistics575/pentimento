SUEZ CANAL..

ON leaving Port Sa‘itl the canal at once enters Lake
Marrctstah, through which the channcl runs for 29 miles;
the waters ot the take :irc silcdlow, and the bottom is mud,
which has been deposited lry the. l‘citlsinc, Tartitic, and
Mendcsian branches of the Nile, nll of which Ilow through the
Iakc. 'l'he hanks on each side of the canal were formed of
the materials which werc (trudged up from the bottom.
Enormous fltrt-ks of water Fowl may hc Hctill standing in shallow
lagoons at .1 short distance from the railway. In the district
which is now nearly all covcrcd hy Lake Man,titlah stood the
famous city of'lhnis, the myilal of thc 'I'nnilic Nome, which is
familiar to all under the name of Zoan (sw Nttmhcrs xiii, 22) ',
the whole district itself is prohnhly that which is called the
Field of loan in Psalm Ixxviii, 12, 43. The fields for
many miles round were exceedingly fertile, and wheat and
vincs were grown "lrurttlautly, About the eighth of tenth
century, through causes which havc hu-n explained elsewhere,
the SCO invaded the district which, until the present doy, has
remained a shallow marsh. 'l'lw draining of Lake Manrhlah
has been hegtm, and in IL tcw ycars' time we may hope lo sec
the ground occupied by crops of wheat, etc.

At the end of Lake Manrilah is Al-Kantarah, is., " thc
Bridge" , the place hears this name hccuust: it stands on the
narrow strip of land which divides Lake, Marrcllah from Lake
Balaty, and which may be regarded as a hritlgc. As tt
matter of fact the old caravan mule hctwccn Egypt and Syria
passed over this lh hridgu" A littlc 10 the north of J:\i-biantarah
are the mounds of Tcll [kdannah, which mark the site of the
city Tahapanes (Jeremiah ii, to), i.e., the Daphne of the
Greeks. The canal runs for two miles between low sands-hills,
when it enters Lake Halal}, which is eight miles long; at the
end of the lake is Ar-Fardtin, antl here the canal enters a
cutting which extends to Lake 'rimshb. Four miles south of
Al-Fardtin is A1-Ciisr, which is the deepest cutting along the
whole course of the canal, for mud and sand had to be
excavated to at depth of about 70 feet. Three lines of tram-
way were laid down, and six engines and 250 wagons were
employed in removing the soil; the work was finished in

janttary, 1863. It was to this point that, during the carly
stages of thc'tintlcrtaking, thc 2o,ooo/v/hi/ript who won; supplied
hy the (iovermncnt wcrc St'Tli. in order to make 'd narrow
channel wherein the tiretlgms could int: limited anti utilized,
Two years wurrf spent in making this channel, and then the
wrtters of the Mediterranean flowcd into the Irasin of Lake
1"imshb, which took five months to fill. Most of the extrava-
tton was done ly piece work, and each labourer warned from
Js. (”-1. to P.S. rid. per day. The circumference. of Lake' Timshb
is nine miics, and 95,000,000 Cttilic yards of water were
t_‘IEIIIIITCII to fill it. On the north bank of Lake Timstib,
mm, the Cmtrodilc lake, stands the fhourishing little town
of ".m.a"i1ryah, which was called after Isma‘il Wtshit; the
population is alyout Ir,448. The town contains 111:1in pretty
Villas; with gartlc-ns, and the verdant fa’n’n't’ Ircc has hccn
planted generously alcmy the roads, which arc clearly tlciined
and well kept. A great deal of taste has been treplay/ti bv the
inhabitants in laying out the strccts and squares, :tml looking
ton the town from a distance. it seems ihcrctlihic that less than
50 ycars ago its Site was a howling wilderness, Here thc
swc-"1yatte1rcairal which is brought from the Nile at Zal:cizili,
50 miles distant, divides into two hranches. the one entering the
SLICK. Canal lay tiouhlc locks and the other running on to Suez.
From 1862, when the town was (oundol, until 'sri the health
of its inhabitants was Very good; in the hatter year, however,
335 Ca'hta of fever appeared, and thc tliScase hocamc endemic,
and between 188.; and 1897 there were 1,700 cases of fever
each year, and hetwccn 1398 and 1902 there were 1,800 cases
of lever. Up tn the end of 1897 the Suez Canal Company had
epent nearly £32,000 on sanitary works and medicine, but no
impresaion was made on the fever. Sulrsmytcntly Major Ross
was invited to examine the town, and he came to the conclu-
Slt‘ln that the fever was caused by the rtaicywn’d: mosquito,
which bred in vast numbers in the pools of stagnant water
thatlay round the town, On 1hremlrer 27th, 1902, it was
tlecidcd to adopt Major Ross's system of dealing with the
Insect, and in 1903 there were only 2r3 cases of fever us
against 2,209 in 1902. Of the 213 cases in 1903, 203 were
ca.ses of those who had had fever previousl r; thus the number
at new cases in 1903 was only $0, In recent years the number
of cases of malaria has still further diminished.

The second half of the Suez Canal, that from IsrnaWyah to
the Red Sea, may be divided into two portions; the first
