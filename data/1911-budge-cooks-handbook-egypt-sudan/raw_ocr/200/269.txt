VIII.~-CAIRO TO siwArs, OR THE OASIS OF
JUPITER AMMON.

A JnoRsirn' to the Oasis of Jupiter Amman may he made
either from Cairo or Alexandria, hut the shorter route is from
Cairo t't'ti the (Jusisjof Garih. 1f the trm‘eiler decides to start
from Alexandria, two ways are upcn to him : he may journey
along the sea-eoast from Alexandria t0 Hatult‘tm, the Parartonium
ofcrassical writers, and then march southwards to Siwhh, that is
to say, to the Oasis, or, he may travel still further along the
sca-coast until he reaches Katalrathmus Major, the modern
'N.rahat aI-Kahir, when, marching, southwards, he will reach
Siwah without diflicultr In each case the length of time
required for the journey varies between I8 and 20 days; it is
impossible to make a more dehnitte statement, for so much
depends upon the individual traveller and his mounts. Apart
from this, sandstorms are more Frequent and intense at some
seasons of the year than others, and caravans, small or great,
may be delayed for days at a time by them. If the traveller
prefers to start from Cairo, he must set out from the neighbour-
hood of Gizah, and follow the old Pilgrim Route, which runs
in a north-west direction, until he arrives at the south-east end
of the Whdi Narrim or "Natron Valley." From this point he
travels almost due west for about Is days, when Siwah is
reached.

The ancient Egyptians called the Oasis of jupiter Ammon

by the name of sekhet.imit, “I QGQQTQQQ. and
-3"9I11 th

the Arabic name is Siwah. Of the early history of the Oasis
nothing is known. Herodotus tells us (iii, 25) that when
Cambyses reached Thehes he sent 50,000 men to reduce the
inhabitants of this Oasis to slavery, and to burn their temple.
It is said that this force marched for several days from Thehes,
and reached the Islands of the ltlessed, iv., the Cases of
Khirgah and IJitkhlah, hut that having attempted to proceed
to the Oasis of jupiter Ammon, when they were ahout half
way, "as they were taking dinner a strong and vehement south
" wind blew, and carrying with it heaps of sand, covered them
" over, and in this manner they disappeared." Alexander the
Great visited the Oasis, and on his way the Cyrenmans brought
him gifts ; the god worshipped there was Amen. The object

worshipped was made of emerald, surrounded by precious
stones, and was, as Prof. Neville has shown, set in the circular
hollow of a shield-shaped oljetst which was placed in a boat.
Amen saluted Alexander, and acknowledged him as his son:
this was the whole point of the visit. According to ()uintus
Curtius (iv, "j') the track to the Oasis was Intrely practicable
to a small band lightly equipped. Watur, fram springs or
from the ciouds, is rarely afforded. 'l‘he solar heat is in.
tuiet‘ahie: the atmosphere is a glowing vatiour; a desolate
expanse of sand burns the feet. The traveller has to Struggle
with a deep layer of loose sharp dust, which, giving way to the
tread and sticking to the 'ltesh, renders stepping painful.
Alexander, however, was stimulated hy It powerful desire to
preSenl himself before "Jupiter, whom, dissatisficd with a
mortal origin, he believed to have been his father: nr, he
designed that others should believe it." As the king was
approaching, the senior priest saluted him as "son," afrirmjng.
that his father jupiter bestowed that title, Alexander replied
that he accepted it, and enquired whether his father had
destined him to the empire of the globe. The priest replied
that “he should govern the whole earth," He then asked
whether all who conspired and killed his father had been
punished, and the answer was that "the crime of no nne
"could hurt the memory of his father, and that all the
"murderers 01' Philip had suffered punishment, and that
" Alexander should continue to he invincible till he joined the
"assembly of the gods." Alexandet's friends thert asked the
god if they were to pay divine honours to their king, and he
replied that "it was agreeable to Jupiter that they should
" render to their victorious king the honours of divinity."

The Oasis is about six miles long, and from a quarter of a
mile to four or five miles wide , it possesses hot springs and
a sulphur mine, and the Fountain of the Sun (/.'3 feet deep),
and about 150 springs. It contains 300,000 olive a_nd palm
trees, and in 1907 its inhabitants were 3,884. The hill called
Gebel M0ta is full of ancient tombs, which have never been
properly examined. The principal towns of the Oasis are
Siwah and Akermi, each being in the possession ofa, ?ewerful
tribe; these two tribes are often at war, but hostilities are
not carried so far as formerly, when the Oasis was independent
of Egypt. In the town of Akermi ‘apparentty .wa.s situated
the Egyptian fortress which is described by Diodorys, and
the temple which belonged to it stood on the site now
