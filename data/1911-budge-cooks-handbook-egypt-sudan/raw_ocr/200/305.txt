580 THE ROUTE OF THE LSRArtITES.

which has /alrrtil.; cm the north, 1hlis on lhtf. south, and
the modem Tell ntle'uliir oil the cast: and We know that
they act taut from the Widi Tfmoiliu. Whtrn they did so, two
ways wan: open to tht-m. 'l‘ht-y could cither go into Syria by
Way of Tunis. UT they t't'iuld go eastwards through the district
of Ramcws, and m makt: their way to the 1uortlwrn end of the
Red Sun, which it is supposcd reached nearly IIS Far as the
modern town oflstna'iliyah. Some think that having arrived
at Sucroth. thc. ypptiml 'rhukut, they passed into the dc.wrt
at litham, and then turned to the north, whilst others think
that they turncd tn the south. The Bibic narrative says thry
went to the south, in obcvtlicnct: to the command, Ei Turn and

put forward tt theory of the mutt; nf thc lixctius which made
the Israelites to latiti through the lick! of Zoan, and by the
fortresses of Etham, Migdol, near Pelusium, the great Fiirbonian
Bag, and Pi1abircuh, and so into Syria. 'ITe grunt drawback
to this theory is the extrt-nte 1mprobahilitythat the, Israelites
would have ventured to march straight into the lirue of strong
Egyptian fortresses which bad linen built on thu eastern frontier
of the Delta, and which clearly it was to their interest to avoid.
Moreover, we know that Ethan, and Migdol wen; common
terms for Fi fortress," and then: must have hum stwerai Ethams
and Migdols betrsccn Gwshtm and Syria.

Taken together the known facts indicate that the Israelites
made their way into the ticsu't by the. nearest mule votssilole,
and that mute probably lay through some part of thc c(iuntry
now occupied by the modern Lake Timsah, which is relatively
close to the eastern end of the Wiuli Ttlmikit. The narrative
of the Book of Exodus calls the water which the Israelites
creased the "Yam Suph," Le., the "sca of reeds," a name
which would never have been given to the sea in general; and
there is no doubt that they called the water by that name
