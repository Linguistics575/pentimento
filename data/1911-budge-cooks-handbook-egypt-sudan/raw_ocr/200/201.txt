matters reizitii'ely little, t'ur there is :10 douht that there were
mun)‘ Christians in that r'ity at the lit-ginning of the stret'md
century. As tht-ir numhers grew they hecttme the objects of
intense hale huth 0i Romans and jaws, but tht-ir luresentte
Wits trrleraiod, and :1 century Inter they pusscsssid a church and
schools, and h-arneti mm direisl their lives and religion.
Under Detritus. Valcriarws, llitJtihrtian, julian the Apostate, and
other Emperors the Christians suffered severe persecutimi, and
neither peace ner security was to he: eujnyed in the city for
:thnut too years, tick. from :tbutlt A.lr. 250 to 360. Trade
hegnn to ticrlim: in the third century, and when the limpernr
Constantine Founded (‘unshmtinuphu and made it take tho
place 0f Alexandria EH the chief eastern scalmrt of his empire,
the clemty of the ring was assured. In the reign of Theodosius I
the Christians attacked the p:igttns,;tn:1 thsstrnyed their statues,
and either hunted their temples or turned them into churches;
at the instigation rot" 'rhcophilus, Patriarch of Alexandria,
the temple and statut- of Serztliis Were hurnt in this reign.
Thu iniquitous ht-havintlr of the Alexatwirian Christians is well
illustrated by the murder 01' Hypatia, the daughter of 'l'henn,
a modest, beautiful, and learned lady of Alexandria. She was
charged with having withdrawn the friendship of the prefect
Orestes from Cyril the Archbishop, and Peter the Render and
a number of monks dragged her from her chariot into a church,
where they stripped her, scraped her ilesh with metal combs,
and then tore her limb from limh. 'l‘he disputes which raged
betsrecn Aritts and Athanasius, George of Cappttdncia and
Athanasius, Cyril and Scstorius, and the Anthtopomorphists did
more to injure the city than a foreign army would have done.
