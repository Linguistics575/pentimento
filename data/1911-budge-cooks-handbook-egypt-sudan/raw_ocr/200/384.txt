of the Island of [‘hilae: six great cataracts' are found en the
Nile, but this is the most generally known. Here the Nile
becomes narrow and flows hetween twr; mountains, which
descend nearly perpendicularly to the river, the course of which
is obstructed by huge boulders and small rocky islands and
barriers, which stand on 1Jiifcrent levels, and cause the: falls of
water which have given this part of the river its name, On the
west side the obstacles are nut so numerous as cm the east, and
sailing and rowing boats can ascend the interact on this side
when the river is high, The noise made by the water is at
times very great, but it has been greatly exaggerated by both
ancient and modern travellers, some of whom ventured to assert
that the "water fell from several places in the mountain more
" than 200 feet.” Some ancient writers asserted that the
fountains of the Nile were in this vataract, and Herodotus“
