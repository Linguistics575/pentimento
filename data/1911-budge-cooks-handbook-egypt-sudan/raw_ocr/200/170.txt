Next to srnoking the Egyptians chicf enjoyment is the
Bath, which is of the kind commonly called "Turkish "; the
word for hath is "l.tansmim.'' Smut; baths admit male Arab
customers only, Others wumen and children only, and others
both men and women, the former in the morning and the latter
in the afternoon. When the hath is approprratccd in women

men not to enter. The old baths of the city are. lsuilt of brick,
have domes in the roof, and are. paved with earthenware and

The real view taken hy the Egyptians about music, sing-
ing, and dancing is not easy to find Out, but 110 people are
more pleascd than they with these amusements. Music was
forbidden by Muhammad himself, for he thought that it
excited men’s passions and predisposed them to vice, and even
in the Arabian Night; (No. 899) Wt'. read of the damsel who
dressed herself in black, built a tomb,and repented that she

which are strung to a sort of monotonous chant , others are of
a rilyald nr uhseene character, and such are often heard in the
