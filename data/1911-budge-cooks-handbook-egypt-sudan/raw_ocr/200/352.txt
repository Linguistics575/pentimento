8. Dér al-Madinat. The temple built in this place
owes its name tn the Coptic Dér, or Monastery, which stood
near here when Thebes was the home of a flourishing Coptic
community, and was dedicated to Saint Paul of Pikoloi, of
whom, however, nothing is known, The monastery must have
contained a society of considerable size, for it is said to have
possessed {tee stewards, The small Egyptian temple which
stands between the Cnlossi and Madinat Hahn, was begun by
Ptolemy IV, Philopator, and continued hy l‘tuletny VII,
Philometor,and iinisheed hy Ptolemy IX, Euergtrles II. It is
built of the ordinary sandstone of the tiistrivt, and though in
many respects it re:semloles most of the funeral temples built by
the Ptolemies, it is a heautil‘ul little. example of its class. It
appears to have been dedicated to more than one of the
goddesses of the underworld, but Hathur was regarded as its
tutelary deity. The capitals of some of the columns are
Hathor-headed, and over the doorway of the large chamber
are the heads of the Seven Hathors, who, in their forms of
cows, supplied the deceased with food in the underworld. In
one of the chambers is a relief representing the Judgment
Scene, which forms the Vignette of the CXXVth Chapter of

the Rom? ofh Jhad, The chief interest of the scene here is
that it proclaims the nature of the huilding, and proves how
anxious lht: l’tolcmics Were oi1icially t0 adopt and to maintain
the principal religious views ol' the Egyptians. The temple
was much visited by travellers in ancient times, as the number
of names written on the walls testify, and ly hath Greeks and
Copls it was regarded as very holy.

i,c, St) far lravk CL," the XIth dynasty, and many ofiicials under
the XYIIIth dynasty were buried here. The cutting of the

vejlous "find " of the jewellery of s'rrvbvetep, wife of Karnes,

the oihcials of the XIXth and XXth dynasties. The tenths
pf Shékh_‘Abd al-Farm" are, extremely interesting, for
In many of them are depicted events which took place under
the rule " tht- grcatest of the kings of the XVIIIth dynasty,
and they illustrate scenes in the. public and privatehife of
some of the "tncials who played a prominent part in the
development of Thehan conquest and civilization. The tombs
in their leading, features; resemble each other, and there is at
times a sameness in the Stlhjeets represented, and even in the
treatment of them. The scenes depicted comprise representa-
tions of agricultural operations, of the amusements of the
deceased, of festivals and banquets, of oflicial functions in
which the deceased played a prominent part-eg, in the receipt
of tribute from vassal nations, and of funeral rites and
ceremonies. The scenes are usually painted in fcmpera upon
a thin layer of white plaster laid upon the bedding of mud, or
perhaps very poor dark-coloured mortar, with which the lime-
stone slabs that formed the walls were covered. Among such.
tombs may be specially mentioned c-
