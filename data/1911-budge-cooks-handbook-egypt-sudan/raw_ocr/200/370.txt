The. Tomb of Thi was discovered by Mr. 'l‘heodore M.
Davis in January, 19o7. The tumh of this queen is situated
close to the large rock mnund in which Rameses IN had his
tmnli made. and it was buried beneath a huge pile of limestone
debris whii:h was thrown out by the masons when they Were
making the tomliof Rameses VI. Mr. Davis sank rt pit through
this until he came to a layer of clean dry limestone fragments.
