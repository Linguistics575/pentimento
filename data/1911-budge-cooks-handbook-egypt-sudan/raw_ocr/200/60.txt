the work was pushed mi with such speed that by the beginning
of February, 1908, the space betwcun the foundation ends was

the dry built sudd on the west bank floor. To carry out this
work the river traftic was diverted through the lock, hut it was
only after the expenditure of valuable time that the sudds were
finally joined, and but tWere weeks remained in which to build
in the remaining portion of the work before the river attained
the level of the temporary Stldds. This was an anxious time,
but by concentrating lahour on the foundations they were
finaliyjoined up in May, 1908. The water was then allowed to
rise inside slowly enough to enable the pier masonry to be
