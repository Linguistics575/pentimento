Lord (Ii'uitict' thought that the t'ittzn't-nt system did not
entail any wry retri'iutis hardship on UN population. At the
same time, it is umlucsrionably true that the employment of
forced labour for any purpose whatsoever is open to objection.
Now that other 1tlorct prusiing matters haw: heun disposed of,
it is wut'thy of considurmiun wht‘thcr the time has not mine to
Clhtthsh thc Lint vrvitige of a bad system." This was written in
IflCrcy, Mr. Vcrsrhoylte, 1tspectmrficncral of Irrigation for
Luwer Iigytit, thought (t904) that the policy of reducing fiood
Watchmen in the. Ilcltzt had been rather overdvnc during the
last fcw ycars, and he reliurtml that the banks, which had been
dcprived of their prutertimt of stakus and hrushwood, had
suffcred from water action. Under the rule of the Ilritish
in ligyi'n the metl who are required for the protection of the
river banks rm: ('hnscti with due regard to justice, and th
slight burden which falls upon the pmphe is carefully adjusted,

as

t'very care heitig taken 10 prevent the creeping in of any
ahusc, and the Il'ltjll called nut recognize the justice of the

call. If the aholitiuu of the corvée for the clearance of
