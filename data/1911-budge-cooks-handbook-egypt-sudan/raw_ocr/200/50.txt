them; in other words, the Nile was unlike an}- other river
known to them. And this is true, for no other river in the
world has exactly the same elmraeteristics, and no other river has
formed a whole (country quite in the same way. and no other
river has impycsseed so deeply nlton the people, who have lived

The sources of the Nile, that is to say, of the Upper

River, at a spot a few degrees south of the titlttator. This vicw
has. however, heen printed to he ermneous by Sir W, Garratin,
who shows that the Kagera represents the united Gur of
three rivers, and that the true SOtll'L‘t: of the Nile is Lake
Victoria itself. The most t'ect-nt writer on the subject is
Capt. H. ti. Lyons, who says: "It has heen maintained that
the [{agera is the actual upper :‘(Jllrr-ic of the Nile, and that
before the subsidenwe took place. which Formed Lake Victoria,

shore,tltcn skirted the present northern short) by Rosebery
Channel to Napoleon Gulf to join the Nile at the Ripon Falls;
ll distinct current is also mentioned as setting across from the
Kagera to the Ripon Falls, Seeing how small an effect the
volume discharged by the Kagera, even in the rainy season,
can have on the water of this vast lake, any such current must
he an effect of the prevalent winds, and as we have seen that
winds blow from lake to shore by day at almost all seasons, it
is more than prohahle that in places a regular drift of the
surface water may be caused " (sv/r.vsierrat/i.r, p. 53}. Victoria

square kilometres, ts the first reservoir of the Nile; it lies in
the region of almost perpetual rains, and receives an texcessive
supply of water from its western tributaries, from subsoil
springs and heavy rainfall, 'lhe second reservoir of the Nile
is Lake Albert, which has an area of 4,500 aquare kilometres,
and Lake Albert in its turn is fed from Lake Edward, which
has an area of 4,000 Square kilometres. Lake Victoria is
1,130 metres above sea-level, and 500 metres higher than
Lake Albert. The White Nile hetween these lakes is called
