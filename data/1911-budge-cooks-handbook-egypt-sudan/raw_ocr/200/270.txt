that the Oasis was furtificd at the end of the N1.Nth dynasty,
when the Lillyans began to oc-cup)' the outlying, lands of the
Western r)clta, The remains which have heen found in
various parts of the Oasis prove beyond a doubt that the
occupation of the plarw by the Egyptians wasavery effective one.
The advantage of visiting the Oasis of Hixtah from Cairo is
that, either going or returning ,the travelter can pay a visit to
the Monasteries in the “51th Natrt'tn, or Natron Valley.*
Those who do not wish to see more of the descrt than they
Can help. and who onty care, to visit the Monasterics, had
better go ly train from Cairo to Al-Wardin or Beni Salimah,
and then cross the desert to the Natron Valley. The Natton
Valley obtains its name from the, muriate of soda t which has
always been obtained there in large. quantities; the Egyptians

" natron." AeLerding to Stralyo(xvii, I, 23), this was produced
by two lakes, but other writers; give the tnumher of lakes 2s six,
and some enumerate eight; the old inhabitants of the Natron
Valley worshipped Serapis, and Straho says they Were the only
people in Egypt who sacrificed the sheep. The length of the
Natron Valley is about 20 miles,and near the middle of it
was the town, commonly called Scete, where the Christian
monks built a large settlement ', Seete is said to have been one
and a half day's journey from Lake Marcotis, Ecclesiastical
writers distinguish carefully between the olilfercnt parts of the
Natrutt Valley, thus there was the town of Nitria, the town of
Scythia (Seem), Petra, the Cells and the Ladder (eka'tmf).
At the end of the first half of the fourth century Christian
recluses began to assemble there, and, led by Macarius the
Egyptian, they emulated the lives of Anthony the Great,
and other early aseeties. Some 5,000 monks lived there, and

The Monastery of Macarius rwtstntaitnsthtce churches,
and two or three chapels: the gaint is said to he huried in
this Mtonastery. About IO miles to the west is the
Monastery of Anba Bishai, and in the chapel dedicated
to the Virgin the saint is said to be buried. A little further
to the west is, the Syrian Monastery, or Dér Suryérli. which
was huilt iry J ohn the Dwarf in the reign of Constantine, the son
of the Empress Helena. who, tradition asserts, found the True
Cross; it was fornmrly in a very Murishing condition, and in
the fifth and sixth centuries possessed :1 very valuable library.
It contains three churches, the Ittreest and finest being
dedicated to the Virgin. the Monastery of Baramits
lies six or eight miles further to the west, and also contains a
church dedicated to the Virgin. The few monks who live
in these monasteries are poor, hut their courtesyand hospitality
are well known; their possessions; are few, and, though they
may not equal Mucarius in their ascetic strenuousttess, no one
will deny that their lives are sufficiently hard, and that they are
dead to the world, TheN . Natron V alley has been the resort of
ascetic Christians from the earliest times, for l rtyntonius took
up his abode there in the second century ; Habib, the Arab,
the friend of the Prophet, also withdrew there in troublous
times, In the seventh century the monks there numbered
3,500. In modern times the Valley has been visited by
Egidius Lochiensis in r633, who saw 8.000 MSS. there;
Wansleb in 1632 and 1673, who saw three or four chests
full of MRS; Huntingdon in 1673 and r679; Gabriel Eva
