further on is Abit Al'Akhdar, and in four miles more
"/ak:izik is reached. Zakazik is the capital of the province
Sharkiyah, and contained in 1907 some 34,999 inhabitants.
The town is an important centre of the cotton trade, as the

abundant. The large stream which runs through the town is
the Mu' iyotCaaal, and it represents the old lanitic arm of the
Nile; the town is connected by rail with Manylrah, and there
are two lines to Cairo, one rid Bulbés, and the other m'ci
