land from the dcsert. Mr. Iicatineil expltorcd one of the under-
ground nnucthwls' and found that it was 4'6 kilometres long,
and he states that the excavation of the manholes or vertical
shafts which connected it with thc surface must have been a
gigantic task. One of thew was 175 feet deep. and the con-
struction of tin: four subterranean aqucduets, with their 600

excavation and removal of 20,000 cubic. metres of solid rock.
