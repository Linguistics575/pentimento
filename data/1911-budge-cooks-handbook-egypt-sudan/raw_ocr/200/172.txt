British Administrator comes in contact, and shows that his task of
governing them and of keeping the peace is not so easy as some
imagine, The story would be incredible were it not supported by
trustworthy evidence. In December, 1908, a. party of some twenty
rough-Iooking persons of both sexes, resembling neither felUhirt
nor Betlhwin, arrived at As7tlt about the same time as a policeman
in charge of six camels, As the result of inquiries made by an
English official who happened to be on the Spot, it appeared that
these people were gipsies, known in Arabic as Halabyin. 21in.
originally from Aleppo', who travelled from village to village, the
women telling fortunes, and the men carrying on a considerable and
apparently lucrative trade in camels, horses, and other live-stock.
Six months previously, one member of the tribe had struck the
camel of another with a whip, an insult which could only be wiped
out, according to their custom, by the voluntary loss of valuable
property by each party, one bidding against the other, as at an
auction, until the aggrieved or offending party could not afford to
continue. When this occurs, the last bidder is considered to have
won the case. by having proved that he is the richer and, therefore,
the better man. Before the appearance of the camels at Asyilt,
about E400 worth of property had already been sacrificed in the
following manner: --Theaggr1eved party began by slaughtering a
buffalo, the carnage beingappropriated by the neighbouring peasants.
The offender replied by killing two buffaloes, as a proof of the
justice of his cause. The first man then threw Es into the Nile, to
which his opponent answered with £10. and so on, slaughtering
animals or throwing away gold, until property to the value of £400
had been destroyed. On the arrival of the gipsies and their camels
at Asyiit, the dispute broke out afresh, and the local authorities were
unable to effect a settlement until the parties concerned had parted
with their Camels, which were worth about £150, and bid up to
£416. In order to avert the slaughter of the camels and the
throwing of more money into the Nile, as thelitigants at first wished,
it was suggested that the animals should be sold and the pro-
ceeds of the sale, as well as the money staked, given to a Moslem
charitable society. This solution was accepted, and when the result
was made known there were great rejoicings among the Halabyin.
The party then disappeared, apparently quite content that bloodshed
had been avoided, and an insult avenged at the cost of nearly £1,000.

_ On the whole. the result of the grunt invasion of Europeans
and of Wesstcuu, tritrilimtion and methods, which has taken place
in Egypt timing the last 20 years, has been to thrust native
amusements from the main streets of (Iniro in the winter, and
