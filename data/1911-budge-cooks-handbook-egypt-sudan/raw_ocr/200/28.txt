. Dryness of the air: Nu matter how hot thc weather, the
illfo Egypt is always light, (rush, and invigorating, and in places
whicharequite away from cultivalctl lands only a minute amount
of moisture exists in it, Aitothcr important characteristic of
the Egyptian climate is its uniformity, and in this respect it
pmbalyly is rmique. How long this will last it is hard to say,
for there. is 110 doubt that the large surface of water in the
Sucr. Canal, and thu extensive irrigation works which are
increasing yearly, [0 say nothing of the enormous lake which
has linen formed lsy the waters held up by the Aswan Dam,
have produced local disturbances of the atmosphere, and
contributed in some places to make the winters less dry
and the summers less hot. The evenings and the mornings
are beautifully cool, and the. thermmncter does not often fall
helore 40° in Cairo, The average temperature of Lower
Egypt ranges between 75" and yo" in summer, and between
45" and tio' in winter, and that of Upper Egypt between pf'

'and too' in summer,and between 60° and pr' in winter.
