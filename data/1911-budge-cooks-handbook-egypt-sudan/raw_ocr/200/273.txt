set of otlices of Oasis Railway Administration, and a number
of small, clean houses, wherein the traveller can find board

cultivated land of' the Nile Valley the railway proceeds in a
south-westcrly direction up the Widi Samhhl, at the end of
which it reaches the plateau. The geologist will find much to
interest him as he passes up from the valley to the plateau.
It then continues its course in the same direction to Al-
Tundubah. 57 miles from Kh5rgah junction. Here there
is a deep shaft, which at one time appears to have been a well.
