646 TH2HES--DtODORUs ON THE RARIESSEUM.

The following is the account of the Tomb of Osymandyas
given by [)iodurlls :-—

IF And these things are not only reported by the Egyptian priests,
"out of their sacred records, but many of the Grecians, who
IE travelled to Thebes in the time of Ptolemy Lagos, and wrote
"histories of Egypt (among whom was Heeateus), agree with
"what we have related. Of the iirst sepulchres (wherein they say
It the women of Jupiter were buried), that of king Osymandyas was
"ten furiongs in circuit; at the entrance of which they say was
tr a. portico of various coloured marble, in length two hundred feet,
"and in height five-and-forty cuhits: thence going forward, on
"come into a four-square stone gallery, every square being our
"hundred feet, supported, instead of illars, with beasts, each of
" one entire stone, sixteen cubits hig , carved after the antique
bb manner. The roof was entirely of stone; each stone eight cubits
Ir broad, with an azure sky, bespangled with stars. Passing out of
"this peristylion, you enter into another portico, much like the
bh former. bat more curiously carved, and with more variety. At the
" entrance stand three statues, each of one entire stone, the work-
El manship of Meamon of Sienitas. One of these, made in a sitting;
"posture, is the greatest in all Egypt, the measure of his foot
"exceeding seven cubits; the one standin on the right, and tho
" other on the left, bein his daughter an mother. This piece is
Fb not only J,'l'dSar,lhor' its greatness, but admirable for its cut
"and workmanship, and the excellency of the stone. In so great
41 a work there is not to be discerned the least flaw, or any other
"blemish. Upon it there is this inscription :--'I am Osymand as,
'l I king of kings ; if any would know how great I am, and W ere
Il ' I lie, let him excel me in any of my works.'

bf There was likewise at this second gate, another statue of his
"mother, by herself, of one stone, twenty cubits in height: upon
14 her head were placed three crowns, to denote she was both the
" daughter, wife, and mother of a king. Near to this portico, they
It say there was another gallery or piazza, more remarkable than
"the former, in which were various sculptures, representing his
"wars with the Bactrians, who had revolted from him, against
'' whom (it is said) he marched with four hundred thousand foot, and
"twenty thousand horse; which army he divided into four bodies,
ll and appointed his sons generals of the whoie.

" In the first wall might be seen the king assaulting a bulwark,
" environed with the river, and tighting at the head of his men,
'' each against some that make up against him. assisted by a lion,
bl in a terrible manner ; which some affirm, is to be taken for a true
"and real lion, which the king bred up tame. which went along
It with him in all his wars. and by his great strength. ever put the

ll kipg eing a man of extraordinary Courage and strength, he was
th Willing to trumpet forth his own praises, setting forth the bravery
'' of his own spirit, by the representation of a hon. In the second
“well were carved the captives dragged after the king, represented
“without hands. etc. ; which was to signify that they were of

bb images, in which were set forth the Iring's sacrificing of oxen, and
Ir his triumphs in that war.

rt In the middle of this Psristrliop, 0 en to the air at the top, was
"reared an altar of shining marble, a excellent workmanship, and
Bl for largeiiess to be admired. In the Inst wall were two statues,
"each of one entire stone, seven-and-twenty cubits high: near to
E4 which, three passages o ened out of the peristylion, into a stately
tr room, supported with pillars like to a theatre for music; every
"side of the theatre was two hundred feet square. In this, there
FI were many statues of wood, representing the pleaders and
"spectators, looking upon the judges that gave judgment. Of
"these, there were thirty carved upon one of the walls. In the
"middle sat the chief justice, with the image of truth lying about
"his neck. with his eyes closed, having many books lying before
"him. This signified that a judge ought not to take any bribes,
" but ought only to regard the truth and merits of the cause.”

3. The co1ossi.-ri'hese two interesting statues were set up
in honour of Amenophis III, whom they represent; they
stood in from of the pylon 0t" a calcareous stone temple which
was built by this king; this has now entirely disappeared.
Tlwy were hewn out of a hard grit-stune, rind lhe top of each
was ahnut 6c, feet above the ground; originally each was
monolithic, The statue (m the. north is the famous Colossus
of Memnon, from which a sound was said to issue every
morning when the Still rose. The upper part of it was thrown
down by an earthquake, it is said, about 27 P,.C. ', the damage
was partially repaired during the reign of Scptimius Severus,
who restored the head and shoulders of the figure by adding
to it five layers of stone. When Strain) was at 'I‘hehes with
Ailing Gallus he heard "a noise at the (irst hour of the day,
li but whether proceeding from the lmse 01" from the colossus,
lk or produced on purpose by some of those standing round the
" liase, I cannot confidently assert." It is said that after the
colossus was repaired no sound issued from it. Some think
that the noise was caused by the sun's rays Striking upon the
stone, while others believe that a priest hidden in the Colossus
produced it by striking a Stone. The inscriptions show that
many distinguished Romans visited the "vocal Memnon ” and
heard the sound; one Petrmiianiis, of a poetical turn of mind,
stated that it made a sighing sound in complaining to its
mother, the. dawn, of the injuries inflicted upon it by Cambyses.
Tlie inscriptions en the hack of the colossi give the names of
Amenophis III.

the colossi, and its foundation dates from Coptic times. The
