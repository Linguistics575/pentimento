the Red Sea was the great highway for truth: ItctwL'L-II Upper

also: therefore we are jusiiied in assuming that an important
trade routL existed between the Nile and Widi Maghirah at least
6, ooo years ago. The Fuypti; ms, I10 douht, took care to fortify
the route seaports on each side of the Red Sea, and smail
garrisons were prohahh. maintained along, the desert roads.
Apart from this traffic, however, a ''cirsiTi'rri''/d business
was done hetween £g3pt and the toans on the shores of
the RLd Sea and beyond, along the coast of "Somaliland,
and southern Arabia, and both the inward and the outwarti
trade centred at thv.ir. It is very probable that even in early
times there was a subsidiary port at the place on the east
coast, north of KIIser called at the present time Abu Sar
