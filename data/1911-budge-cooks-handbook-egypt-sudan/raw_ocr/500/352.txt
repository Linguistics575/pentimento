8, I0tr al-Madinat. The temple built in this place
owes its name tn the Coptic llétr, or Monastery, which stood
near here when Thebes was the hnnte ef a flcrtuishing Coptic
community, and was dcdicated to Hsint Paul of Pikolol, of
whom, htowever, nothing is knewn. Thc 1ucmastcry must have
contained a society of oynsiderahle. size, for it is said to have
peesessetl fees stewards. The small Egyptian temple which
stands hetween the Cnlessi and Madinat H alul, was begun by
Ptolemy IV, Philopattor, and continued hy Ptl:my VII,
Philomctor, and finishted by Ptolemy IX, Energetes II. It is
built of the ordinary sandstone of the tlistriet,ant1 thnugh in
many respects it resernhles most of the funeral temples built hy
the Ptolernies, it is a heeutithl little esrtntple of its class. It

tutelary deity. The capitals ol" seine of the etilutnrts are
Hathor-headed, and over the doorway tit the large chamber
are the heads of" the Seven Hathors, whet, in their forms of
eews, supplied the deceased with food in the underworld, In
one of the chambers is a relief representing the Judgment
Scene, which forms the Vignette of the CXXVth Chapter of

that it proclaims the nnture of' the huiltiing, and proves how
ttnsietts the Ptolctttics were officially to ndnpt and tti maintain
the principal religions views el' the Egyptians, "the temple
was much risitt'tl by trnrellers in ancicnt times, JS the number
of names written en the walls testify, and ity hath Greeks and
Cepts it was regarded as very holy.
