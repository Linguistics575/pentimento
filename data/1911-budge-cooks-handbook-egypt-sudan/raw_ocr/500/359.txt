The 'l‘enths of the Kings fhrrn a very important and interesting
class of mronurtwnts, the like et which esists nowhere else in
Egypt, They were all made hetween ITDD tt.t':. and tege tart,
that is te say, they were hewn and httilt {hiring the tnest
fiourisl%g, pcriod tit Fgyptimt hister}; and at a time when
tribute flowed intrt the country from Syria, Palestine, Lihya,
Nubia, and a part til the Nerthern Stuhin. When we eensirler
the group as a whele it is easy to see that all are httilt
practically en ette and the same plan; the ntetlilieattens
which eeeer in the details of each are due partly to structural
difficulties and partly te the difference in the lengths of time
which were dcvoted tr: the making of then. If the king
began te build his tenth early in life, and had a long, and
successful reign, his tenth would he large, and eentairt many
chambers, and be elahorately dccorated with seenes and tests
from the religious works which were most esteemed at the
time; if his reign were shnrt and supplies were nut forthcoming
to preside the feed of the workmen and others employed en
the work, the corridors had tr: be shortened, and the number of
reerrts diminished, It may well be assumed that these tenths
were built by forced labour, One of the eernmenest religious
views of the Egyptians was that the Tuat, or Underworld,
was a leng, narrow valley which ran parallel with ligypt, and
was neither above nor helew the level of this earth. It had
a river flowing, threugh the whole length of it. This valley
began en the west bank of the Nile, ran due north, bent
round tewards the east when the Delta was approached, and
terminated at the place where the sun rese. It was divided

into re sections, and at etch end was a sort nf vestiiwle er
chamber. The ante-chamber at its beginning was called
Amentet, and was a place of gloom; as the passenger
threttgh this valley went eriwards eaeh ef the first five.
seetiens grew darker and darker, until at the end of the fifth
seetitm the darkness was absolute. As the passenger moved
rm thrrntgh the last five sections the darkness grew less and
less dense, until at the end of the tenth seetien he entered
the ehatnher, the gloom of which resemhled that ef the
chamber at the hegitttting of the valley. The whole night,
which was supposed to eensist of ta henrs, was eeeupied in
passing thrtntgh the Tuahantl the two chambers and the ID
main divisions of it were traversed each in ene hour. The
Tnat was n ditiienlt place tr) pass through, t'er portions ot it
were filled with hidcous nnntsters and horrible reptiles, and a
lake nf heiling and stinking water. Religious traditian declared
that the Sun-god Ra had madc his way in it seated in his boat,
hut that he was only cnablcd to do .fiU0 hy employing his words
ef magical power, atttl hy the exercise of the functions of deity:
The priests declared that they possessed the httewiedge of
such words of power, and people believed that if they learned
them, and learned to recognize the various divisions of the
Tuat and the beings in them lry means of the pictures which
the priests provided, they could make the journey through the
That in safety, and mould rise in the next world with the sun.
The priests of Amen, whe promulgated this view, which was
based upen an elder system of indigenous helief, presided over the
lntiltlittg hi the royal tombs in the XVIIIth dynasty, and made
each tenth to resemble the long, narrow valley of the Tuat by
prtwiding, it with long corridors. When the body was deposited
in the tenth the priests repeated the words of power which Rs
was believed te have uttered, and pinformed ceremonies in
imitation of those of the acts of the god , in fact, made very full
use of sympathetic magic, and the worshippers of Amen believed
that their kings weuld surely and certainly pass safely through
the dark valley, and would overcome all their foes, and would
rise tegether with the sun to a new life in the next world. Now,
the Sun-god traversed this valley each night in his boat, and,of
course, rese each day ; the aim, then, of every erte of his wer-
shippers was te seeure a passage in his boat, for if only this
eeultl be obtained resurrection was certain. The doctrine of
the sun-worshippers and the priests of Amen taught that the
souls of all who died during the day made their way to Amentet,
