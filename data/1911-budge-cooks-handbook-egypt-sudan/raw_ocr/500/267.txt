Rameses II. Instead of heing dated in the day and month
and year of Rameses II in which it was set up it is dated in
the iooth year of the Hykses king Nubti, a very remark-
able fact. After hlariettt- had read and copied the test he

Under the Heman yimpire,x 'l'anis still hehi a high position
aiming the tewns hi the Helta, and the l-Igt'litiatis considered
it of sufliciuut imptortance te make it an episeepal see. In the
list of the hishetis whe were present at the Council of Chalccclon
{a.ti. 451), the name of Apollonius, [iisheli ofTanis, is found.
Tanis must not he confounded with Tennis, the sealiert town
which grew and increased in ittwrtiatut as tanis declined;
and it is difficult te understand why 'l'anis sheelLi have
dwindled away, tzmsirlering, that Arah writers have described
its climate as heng itiest snlulorious, and its winter like sertimer.
Water was said ttt dow there at all titties, and the inhahitartts
could water their gardens at their will; tie place in all Egypt,
save the Fayyimt, could he compared with it for fertility, and
for the beauty of its gardens and vines. After the sixth century
of our era the sea invaded a large luortion of the tcrritory around
Tanis, and it went en o:,tw.roachingr, each year little try little, until
all its villages were stthmerged- The inhabitants retrieved their
dead to Ter1rtis, and established themselves there; Tennis
was evacuated hy its inhabitants ah. I tea, and the tewti itself
was destroyed Al}. rash.

Nabtshah, which marks the site ef a fortified frontier town
under Raiiieses fi, and no doubt formed tone of the chain ef
fertresses which he heilt across the northeast border of the
Delta. The tewn existed in the KXV’lth dynasty, for some ef
the kings of that 1lynasty repaired the temple of the local

5. Near Sinbaltiiwtm which is en the main line between
?.aigftsik and Nlantfirah, is the mound which the Arabs call
Tamai sI-Amdid, and which marks the site of the classical
Thmuis. Close by is another mound, te which ancient Arab
writers gave the name of Al-Manda; this marks the site
of Mendes, In, er a little hefere, the Ptolemait: I’eried
Thmuis and Mcndes were incorporated, probably because the
inhabitants of both places worshipped the ram. ln the fourth
century of eur era Thmeis was a flourishing town, and
possessed its own magistrates, and was exempt from the
jurisdiction of the Governor of Alexandria. It was aise an

episcrrpal see, and Serapion, ene of its bishops, is mentioned
by Herakleanes. The importance of 'rhmuis-,Mende is
proved by the faet that Amasis lI dedicated te the Ram-grod
a shrine, which was 23 feet high, and Ptolemy II restored the
sanctuary, and took part in the ancient ceremonies, whieh were
performed in that city at the ittstailatiee of a new Ram. The
statues of Ptolemy Ir anti his wife r'trsieee were placed near
the Ram in the lireeessien. and were carried through the
streets felieweti by the chief Iiien of the city, and by crowds
of rcjoicing citizens. A few I‘Igyiitian murllirnet1ts are still to
be seen at this place, The name 'l'tttriai tU-Amdid represents
the twe names Thmuis and 1fcruits 'Tamai = Thrnuis, and
Arndid is a corruption of Mendes, which is the Cheek form of

the Egyptian name 1laa-ucletet,:, 12%, E2? , (i) " There are a

great many meends in this district which eeneeal remains of
ancient Ilgsptian buildings and there is he deeht that under
the EIch dynasty the whale region was full Lif small towns,
many of which were strongly built and fortified, se that they
might resist the attacks ef the nomad tribes from the Eastern
Desert and Syria. It seems, however, that they had to be
built en mounds artificially constructed, the object heing to
keep them above the waters of the 'mundation. The saturated
soil and the storms of war and conquest do away with any hope
that many fragile objects or papyri will be found ameng the
reins.

6. Close to the railway which joins Zakssth and Abil
Hanmriid, and a little to the south of it, is Safe al-thannah,
which was explored by Professor Nasilie in IHH4; it marks the
site of a large, ancient 1igyptiart town, in which Rameses 11
built a fitte temple, for a colossal statue of this king in black
granite was found in a cornfield near the village. Some 4cr er
So years ago the Jelltthin discovered a rectangular, nuonoh'thic
shrine, measuring , feet by 6 feet 9 inches by 6 feet, covered
inside and out with heautifully executed inscripticons and scenes.
The local Psshft, whe thought that gold was hidden inside it,
promptly had it broken in pieces, twe of which were carried to
his farm, and the remainder Were used for handing the bridges
of filaft and Tahra Hamad I The shrine was dedicated to the
Ram-god end the Hawk-god of the East by Neetarurhus II,
the last native king of Egypt, about 36o BL. A restoratirm ct
the sanctuary of these geds was made by Ptolemy il, probably
about ree years later.
