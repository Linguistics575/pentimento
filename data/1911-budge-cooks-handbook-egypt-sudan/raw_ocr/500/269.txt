The ancient Iigyptians called the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon

by the name of Hekhet-imit, li TEQQTQQQ, and

the Aralsie name is Siwah. Of the early history of the Oasis
nothing is known. Herodotus teiis us (iii, as) that when
Camtryses reached Thehes he sent 5n,nee nten to reduce the
inhabitants of this Oasis to slavery, and to harm their temple.
It is said that this force marched for several days from Thehes,
and reached the Islands of the itlessed, ste., the Gases of"
Khirgah and IJEtkhlah, hut that having attempted to proceed
tn the Oasis of jupiter Amnien, when they were ahntlt half
way, "as they were taking dinner a strong and vehement south
" wind hlew, and carrying with it heaps of sand, covered them
" over, and in this manner they disappeared" Alexander the
Great visited the Oasis, and on his way the Cyrenteans brought
him gifts ; the god worshipped there was Amen. The object

Alexander, however, was stimulated h}; a powerful desire to
present himself het'tire "Jupiter, wham, dissatisfied with a
mortal origin, he helieved to have heen his father: hr, he
designed that tithers shtiultl believe it." As the king was
apprcmching, the senier priest saluted him as Ct son," affirming
that his father jttpiter bestowed that title. Alexander replied
that he aeeelited it, and enquired whether his father had
destined hint tn the cmpire irf' the gihhe. The priest replied
that "he should. gevern the whole earth," He then asked
whether all who conspired and killed his father had been
punished, and the answer was that "the erinte of nn tine
"could hurt the ntentnrjr of his father, and that all the
"murderers nf Philip had suffered punishment, and that
" Alexander should continue te he invincible till he joincd the
"assemhly of the gods." Alexander's friends then asked the
god if thcy were tn pay divine honours to their king, and he
replied that "it was agreeable to Jupiter that they should
" render to their victorious king the honours of divinity."

The Oasis is about sis miles long, and from a quarter of a
mile to four or five miles wide , it possesses hot springs and
a sulphur mine, and the Fountain of the Sun {13 feet deep),
and about 'so springs. It contains 3en,e~ne elite and palm
trees, and in 1927 its inhabitants were 3,334+ The hill eailed
Gebel Mtlta, is full of ancient tombs, which have never been
properly examined. The principal towns ef the Oasis are
Siwah and Akermi, each being in the possession e-tr a powerful
tribe; these two trihes are often at war, but 11ostilities are
not carried so far as formerly, when the Oasis was independent
of Egypt. In the town nf Alcerrni apparently was situated
the Egyptian fortress which is described by Diudorus, and
the temple which belonged to it stood on the site new
