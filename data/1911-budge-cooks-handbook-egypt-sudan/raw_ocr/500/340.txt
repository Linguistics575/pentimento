" And these things are not only reported tty the Egyptian priests,
“nut of their sacred records, but many of the Greeians, who
" travelled to Thebes in the time of Ptolemy Lars, and wrete
"histories of Egypt (among whom was Hecateus), egree with
"what we have related., Of the first sepulchres (wherein they say
it the women of Jupiter were buried), that of king 9Nrtpandaras was
"ten furlengs in circuit: at the entrance of whteh they say was
" a portico of rsriens coloured marble, in length two hundred feet,
"and in height five-and-forty cubits: thence going forward, au
"come into a fur-square stone gallery, every square being enr
"hundred feet, supported, instead of iIIars, with beasts, eaeh of
"one entire stone, sixteen enhits hig , carved after the antique
" manner. The roof was entirely of stone; each stene eight cubits
It broad, with an satire sky, bespang1ed with stars. Passingrent of
"this peristy1ion, yen enter into another ptartxo, much like the
" fermer. hnt mere curiously carved, and with mere variety. At the
"entrance stand three statttes, each of one entire stone, the works
Al manship of Memnon of Eienitas. One tai" these1 made in a sitting
"posture, is the greatest in all Egypt, the measure ot his foot
"exceeding seven enhits; the one standing en the right, and the
"other on the left, bein his daughter an mother, This piece is
"not only J','idi2'd'fi1h,) its greatness, but admirable for its cut
"and workmanship, and the excellency of the stone. In se great
"a work there is not to be discerned the least flaw, or any other
"blemish, Upon it there is this inscription :----‘I am i0srmand as,
" I king of kings ; if any weult'l know how great I am, and w ere
" ' I Iie, let him excel me in any of my works.'

" There was likewise at this seeend gate, another statue of his
"mother, by herself, at ene stone, twenty enhits in height: upon
" her head were placed three crowns, to denote she was both the
" daughter, wife, and tttrather of a king. Near to this Portico, they
It say there was anether gallery or piazza, more remarkable than
"the Ierrner. in which were various sculptures, representing his
"wars with the Bactrians, who had resulted from him, against
" whom (it is said) he marched with fenr hundred theusartd feet, and
"toventy thousand horse ; whieh army he divided intn fenr bodies,
" and appointed his sens generals of the whete.

" In the first wall might be seen the king assaulting a bulwark,
" environed with the river, and fighting at the 'head of his men,
41 eaeh against some that make up against him, assisted by a lion,
" in a terrible manner ; which some affirm, is to be taken for a true
"and real lien, which the king bred up tame, which went along
"with him in all his warsI and by his great strength. ever put the
" enem to flight, Others make this tuanstruetion of it, that the
" Icing heing a man of eartra9rdinary eenrage and strength, he was
" willing to trustipet forth his ewn praises, setting forth the bravery
" of his own spirit, by the representatipu of a line. In the second
“well were carved the captives dragged after the king, represented
"without hands, etc. ; which was to signify that they were of
"efreminate spirits, and had us hands when they came te fight.
" The third wail represented all sorts of sculptures, and euttette

" In the middle of this erishr1ion, e en to the air at the tsp, wae
dt reared an altar of shining marble, e exeellent workmanship, and
" for Iargenels to be admired. In the last wall were twe statues,
"each of ene entire stone, seven-and-twent, euhits high: near to
“ which, three passages epeneti out of the peristyiien, into a stately
tt room, supported with pillars like to a theatre for music; every
"side of the theatre was two hundred feet square. In this, there
'l were many statues of wood, representing the pleaders and
"spectators, looking npnn the juriges that gave judgment. Of
"these, there were thirty earned upen ene of the walls, In the
"middle sat the chief justice, with the image of truth lying sheet
"his neck, with his eyes closed, having many books lying hetere
"him. This signified that a judge enght not to take any bribes,
" but ought only te regard the truth and merits of the cause,"
