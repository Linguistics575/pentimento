we have the little reekuhewn temple of "Cru-em-heb, the last
king, of the X‘t"IIIth dynasty, conHuctring, the lithittttiarts , here
we have figures of this king, mul figvrcs of Heti I, Itanteses 11
his son, Nftetwphilrah, ete. At Eiisiiah the Nile was wtorshipped,
and the little tetttpie which Rameses li htiilt in this plocc seems
to have heett detlitrated chicfly to it. “there are neittert'itts inscrip-

figures they accompany are well wtorthy ofcsaminatitm iiir those
who have the time. At Friiisilah the. Nile narrews t'ert' rrmch, and
it was generally thnught that a erttareet tittee existed here i, there
is, hewes'er, no eritlettee in 'mpport of this; view, and the true
channel of the Niie lies en the other side, of the Itteunlain.

Hem Ombos, 55% miles frent Cairo, on the east hank hi
the Nile, was an important place at all periods of Egyptian
histert' ', it was called by the itieytittians l’er-Hehek, lk the
temple of Heheh y') {the ereeet'iih-t god), arid Ntthit, attti Fimlk,
by the Copts. The eidest object here is a sattt'istmte gateway
which 'l'huthttttzrs III dedicated tn the gird Seiteki The ruins
hi the temple and other buildings at Kent Oltthes are 'arrlor1g,
the tttest striking in Egypt, but, until the clearance of the
site which M. tie Morgan made in 1393 A, it was imptos-
sible to get an esaet idea tof their arrangement. It is pretty
certain that a temple dedicated te sOrTltt god tttttst have
stood here in the Early Jimpirc, and we know from M.
Maspero's discoveries, here in 1532, that Amenophis I and
'l'htithtttes III, kings of the Xi’IIIth A,vnasty, earrietl out
repairs on the tetttttie which was in esistettee in their days;
hut at the present time, mi ttarts tof the buildings at Kent Ottthes
Are tthier than the reigns of the l-ittiiettties. Thanks tn the

The Mammisi, the t_ireat Temple, ttttti the Chapcl of Hathor;
and all these buildings were etteleseri within a surrtumtling wall.

The Mammisi, or small temple wherein the festivals net the
birth of the geds were celehrated, stood in front of the great
temple, to the left; it consisted of a small courtyard, hall of
columns, and the shrine. It was built by 1'tolc,my IX, who is
depicted on the walls making offerings to Sehek, lrathttThnth,
and other deities, The best relief remaining {see de h‘turgatt,
Kom Om/ms, p. so) is en the north wall,attt1 represents the king
on a fowling expedition through marshes much frequented by
water fowl.
