it is prnhahle that he will net admire the natives with whnm he
will eeme in enntaet until he knews them fairly well. The
Egyptians in general, until Iptite reeently, have, like ether
Mtthamtnadans, never heen aeeustnmed tn travel, and they

henevnlent and eharitahle tn the peer, and they are eatremely
