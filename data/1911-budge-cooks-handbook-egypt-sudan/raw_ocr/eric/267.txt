Under the Itnman Empire Tanis still held a high [iesitien

and it is diflieult tn understand why Tanis shenld haye
dwindled away, eensidering that Arab writers have deseribed
its elimate as being mest salubrinus, and its winter like summer.

prnyed by the faet that :‘tmasis II dedieated tn the Hatnrged
a shrine, whieh was 23, feet high, and .l’telemy II restered the

great many muunds in this distriet whieh eeneeal remains ef
aneient Egyptian buildings, and there is he deuht that under
the 15:1ch dynasty the whele regien was full nf small tnwns,
many ef whieh were strengly built and fertitied, su that they
might resist the attaelzs ef the nemad tribes frem the Eastern
Desert and Hyde. It seems, heweyer, that they had te be
built en mnunds artiiieially eenstrueted, the ebjeet being te
keep them abet-e the waters ef the inundatien. The saturated
