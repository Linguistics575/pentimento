” And these things are net enly reperted by the Egyptian priests,
“ eut ef their sacred reccrds, but many ef the IErecians, whe
” travelled te Thebes in the time ef Ftelemy Lagus, and wrete
“histeries ef Egypt {ameng whem was Hecateusf'l, agree with
“what we have related. DI the ﬁrst sepulchres {wherein they sayr
“ the wemen ef Jupiter were buried}, that ef king ﬂsymandyas was
“ten furlengs in circuit: at the entrance ef whtch they say was
”a pertice ef varieus celeured marble, in length twe hundred feet,
“and in height ﬁve-and-ferty cubits: thence geing ferward, eu
“ceme iute a feet-square stene gallery, every square being eur
”hundred feet, snpperted, instead ef illars, with beasts, each ef
“ ene entire stene, sixteen cubits hig , carved after the anttque
“ manner. The reef was entirely ef stene; each stene eight cubits
” bread, with an azure sky, bespangled with stars. Passing eut ef
“this peristylien, yeu enter inte anether pertice, much like the
“ fermer, but mere cnrieusly carved, and with mere variety. At the
“ entrance stand three statues, each ef ene entire stene. the werk-
“ manship ef blemnen ef Eienitas. Due ef these, made in a sitting
”pesture, is the greatest in all Egypt. the measure ef his feet
“exceeding seven cubits; the ene standin en the right, and the
“ether en the left, bein his daughter an mether. This piece is
“net enly cemmendableger its greatness. but admirable fer its cut
“and werkmanship, and the encellency ef the stene. In se great
“a werk there is net te be discerned the least flaw, er any ether
“blemish. Upen it there is this inscriptien :----‘I am ﬂsymand as,
” ‘ king cf kings ; if any weuld knew hew great I am, and w ere
“ ' I lie, let him encel me in any at my werks.'

” There was likewise at this secend gate, anether statue ef his
”mether, by herself, at ene stene, twenty cubits in height: upen
” her head were placed three crewns, te denete she was heth the
“ daughter, wife, and mether ef a king. Near te this pertice, they
“ say there was anether gallery er pisses, mere remarkable than
“the fermer. in which were varietts sculptures, representing his
“wars with the Hactrians, wbe had revelted frem him, against
“ whern {it is said} he marched with feur hundred theusand feet, and
”twenty theusand herse; which army he divided inte feur bedies,
” and appeinted his sens generals ef the wheie.

“ In the ﬁrst wall might be seen the king assaulting a bulwark,
” envirened with the river, and ﬁghting at the 'head ef his men,
“ each against same that make up against him, assisted by a hen,
“ in a mrribie manner ; which seme afﬁrm, is te be taken fer a true
”and real lien, which the king bred up tame, which went alcug
“with him in all his wars, and by his great strength. ever put the
“ enen't be ﬂight. ﬂthers make this censtructien cf it. that the
” king eing a man ef ewtraerdinary ceurage and strength, he was
“ willmg te trumpet ferth his ewn praises, setting ferth the bravery
“ ef his ewn spirit, by the representatien ef a lien. In the secend
“ wall were carved the captives d ragged after the king, represented
“witheut bands. etc. ; which was te signify that they were ef
“eﬁ'emiuate spirits, and had ne hands when they came in ﬁght.
“The third wall represented all serts ef sculptures, and curteus

“ In the middle ef this eristylien, e en te the air at the tep, was
“ reared an altar ef shining marble, e encellent werkmanshtp, and
“ fer largenels te be admired. In the last wall were twe statues,
”each ef ene entire stene, seven-and-twenty cubits high: near te
“ which, three passages epened eut ef the periatylien, intc a stately
“ re-em, supperted with pillars like te a theatre fer music; every
”side ef the theatre was twe hundred feet square. In this, there
” were many statues ef weed, representing the pleaders and
“spectaters, leeking upen the judges that gave judgment. Elf
”these, there were thirty carved upen ene ef the walls. In the
“middle set the chief justice, with the image ef truth lying abeut
“his neck. with his eyes clesed, having many banks lying befere
“him. This signiﬁed that a judge eught net te take any bribes,
“ but eught enly in regard the truth and merits ef the cause.”

in hrntnur ef Amenephis III, whnnt they represent; they
steed in frent tn the pylnn at a calcarenus stnne temple which
was httilt by this king; this has new entirely disappeared.
'l'ltey were hewn nttt nf a hard grit-stene, and the tap nf each
was ahnut tic feet aheve the greund; erigittally each was
mnnelithie. The statue en the nnrtlt is the famntts |lilinlessus

was partially repaired during the reign ef Septimius Severus,
whe restnred the head and shnulders cf the ﬁgure by adding
te it live layers nf stene. When iitrahn was at rl‘hehes with

that the neise was caused by the sun‘s rays striking upen the
stnne, while ethers believe that a priest hidden in the enlnssus
prnduced it by striking a stene. 'l‘he inseriptinns shew that
many distinguished Humans visited the “semi l'tlemnen ” and
heard the snund; ene Petrnrtianus, ef a pnetical turn ef mind,
stated that it made a sighing snund in eemplaining te its
mether, the dawn, ef the injuries inflicted ttpen it by Cambyses.
The inseriptinns en the back at" the celessi give the names ef
Amenephis III.
