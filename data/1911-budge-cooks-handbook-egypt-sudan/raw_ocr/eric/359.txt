is reaehed by passing the temple at hittrnrth; it is situated
ahnut three nr i'nnr miles item the riser. This yalley
enntains the tnmhs ni kings hi the Ii‘t’illth, Eli‘ith, and
hich dynasties, and is generallr knnwn as the Eastern lHalley :
a smalier 1i.*a.lh':y, the ‘L‘festern, enntains the tnnths ni' seine ni
the kings ni the H‘t’Hith dynasty. These innihs ennsist nflnng
inelined planes with a numher nt" t‘l‘iE'tITllit'I'ii nr halls reeeding

tribute ﬂnwed intn the enuntry friiim Syria, Palestine, Lihya,
Nubia, and a part ni the Nnrthern seats. ‘L‘i'hen we ennsider
the grnup as a whnle it is easy tn see that all are huilt
praetieally nn nne and the same plan; the mndilieatinns
whieh neeur in the details nf eaeh are due partly in strnetural
ditﬁeulties and partly tn the diiTerenee in the lengths ni' time
whieh were deynterl tn the making nf them. If the king
hegan tn huild his tnmh early in life, and had a inng and
sueeessful reign, his tnmh wnuld he large, and enntain many
ehambers, and he elahnrately deenrated with seenes and tests

the wnrk, the enrridnrs had tn he shnrtened, arid the numher nf
rnnms diminished. It may well he assumed that these tnmhs
were huilt hy t'nreed lahnur. Cine nf the enmmnnest religinus
views nf the Egyptians was that the Tent, nr Underwnrid,
was a lnng, narrnw t-‘alley whieh ran parallel with Egypt, and

a river ﬂnwing thrnugh the whnle length nf it. This valley
