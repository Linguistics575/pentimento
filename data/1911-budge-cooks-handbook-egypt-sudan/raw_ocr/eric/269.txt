frnm this, sandstnrms are mere freiptent and intense at snme

prefers tn start frnm lifairn, he must set nut frnni the neighhnur-

Camhyses reaehed 'I‘hehes he sent 5n,nnn men tn reduee the
inhabitants nf this tiasis tn slavery, and tn hurn their temple.
It is said that this fnree marehed inr several days frnm Thehes,

expanse nf sand hurns the feet. The traveller has tn struggle
with a deep layer nt' lnnse sharp dust, whieh, giving way tn the
tread and stieking tn the flesh, renders stepping painful.
Alexander, hnwever, was stimulated hy a pnwerful desire tn
present himself hefnre H,lupiter, whnm, dissatisfied with a

designed that nthers shnuld lielieve it.” Its the king was
apprnaehing, the seninr priest saluted him as “ sun," afﬁrming
that his father jtlpiter hestnwed that title. Alexander replied
that he aeeepted it. and entpiired whether his father had
destined him tn the empire nf the glnhe. The priest replied
that “he shnuld gnvern the whnle earth.” He then asked
whether all whn ennspired and killed his father had been
punished, and the answer was that “the erime nf nn nne
“enuld hurt the meninry nf his father, and that all the
“ murderers nf Philip had suffered punishment, and that
” Alexander shnuld enntinne tn he invineihle till he jnined the

gnd if they were tn pay divine hnnnurs tn their kin I, and he
replied that “it was agreeahle tn Jupiter that they shnuld
