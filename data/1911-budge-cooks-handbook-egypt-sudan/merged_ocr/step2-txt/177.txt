330 THE GENERAL REELTRREC110N.

The time when the resurrection is to take place is known only
to tied. The first blast of the trumpet will shake heaven and
earth: the second will cause all living creatures te die, the last
being the angel el death; and the third, which is te take place
40 years after the second, will raise the dead, Muhaunnad being
the first to rise. The general resurrection will include
animals. Heme say the day of judgment will last 1,000 years,
and others 50,000; the place of judgment will be the earth,
and M11loammad is to be the intercessor with tired en behalf
et man.:'t hth wherein is written nn account of his actions
will he given to each man, and all things will he weighed
in a halanee; the judgment ever, the souls of the good
will tum to a read en the right, and these all the bad to a
read en the left. All will, however, have to pass ever the
bridge As-Sinn, which is laid ever the midst of hell, and is finer
than a hair, and sharper than the edge of a sword; the good will
have no difficulty in passing ever this, but the wicked will fall
from it and meet their deem in flehenna, which is divided into
seven storey, ene belew the ether. Between hell and paradise
is a partition or gulf, which is net, however, se wide that the
blessed and the damned eannet diseeurse tegelher.

The blessed will drink out of a lake, the water of whiCh
comes from Paradise, and is whiter than milk, and sweeter in
smell than musk, Paradise was created before the wurld, and
is situated above the seven heavens, near the throne of God;
ts earth is made of fine wheat lleur, or musk, or saffron I its
stones are pearls: its walls are inlaid with geld and silver; and
the trunks at all its trees are of gold. Therein is the TMah
tree, laden with every kind of fruit, and it will supply the true
believer with everything he needs, rich, meat, drink, raiment,
horses to ride, ete. The rivers flew with milk, wine, and
honey, and the fountains are innumerable. The wemen at
Paradise, the lifts al-'uyi'm (EL, wemen with large eyes, the
pupils of which are very dark, or black, and the whites of
which are very white and clear), who will he given to the
believers, are made of pure mesh, and are free from all the
defects of earthly women I they live in hollow pearls, which are
be miles lung, and tie miles wide. The beings in Paradise
will never grew old, and they will always remain in the prime
and vigour of a man 30 years eittge; when they enter Paradise
they will be of the same stature Its Adam, tie, er
I re Feet high. Women who have livetl geed lives upon earth
will live in Paradise in an abode specially set apart fer theta.
