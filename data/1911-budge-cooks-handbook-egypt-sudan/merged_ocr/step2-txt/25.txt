The Traveller in Egypt .--'l'he traveller who visits Egypt
tor the first time will certainly be tielighted with the enttntry, but
it is probable that he will net admire the natives with whom he
will Chine in contact until he knows them fairly well. The
Egyptians in general, until quite recently, have, like ether
Mtthamtnadans, never heen aeeustnmed tn travel, and they
look upon those who wander from country as beings
who are possessed of restless though harmless devils. lake

wicked people, and that that destroyed them, and blotted out
their kingdoms and buried their palaees and temples, because

and the wish to see new cities and new peoples, will draw men

that the possession of money will enable him to keep wives, to

loses no opportunity of getting money from the stranger. whom
he believes to possess an inexhaustible supply of gold and
silver. Speaking generally. the traveller has very little opportunity of swing the hotter class of Egyptians, and he must by
flu means judge the nation by these who minister to his wants
in the great cities, The Egyptian, the worst side of whom:
character has not been developed hy cupidity, is a very
estimable individual. He is proud of his religion, but is
tolerant to a remarkable degree: it must never be forgotten
that the strietest Muhammadans tlespise the Christian faith in
their hearts, although Christians are everywhere treated with
civility, As the result of their religion, the Egyptians are
benevolent and charitable to the poor, and they are eatremely
hnspitable; they are Cheerful, affable, easily amused, and many
are temperate and frugal. They lnve their homes and their
native villages, and when they are compelled by the exigencies
of military service to leave them, large numbers of young men
regularly transmit money to their parents and relatives to keep
them from want. It has heen wisely remarked by Lane that
the Egyptian has an gratitude in his composition, and the
traveller will discover for himself that even after he has paid
a man lavishly for trivial services he will he met with the
demand for bakshish. Partly through climatic influences,
partly through constitution, and partly through his intense
fatalism, the Egyptian in all classes is lazy, and he will never
de mere than he is absolutely compelled in do. Truthfulness
is very rare in modern Egypt, but this is in many cases only
the natural result of loose and inaccurate thinking. The views
of the Egyptian about his womankind are not of an exalted
character, but he has only himself to thank for this so long as
he adheres to the abominable system of divorce which is
common throughout the country. In judging the Egyptian
the traveller must make allowance for the eentnries nt nppres
