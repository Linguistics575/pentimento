and bracing, but the nights art: cold, as in the strata; the sky
is elnntlless anrl the days are heat. As there is much shallow
water in the lnwalying lantls. and the air is hot and steamy
above them, a particularly vicious species of mosquito thrives
in the swamps and swarms in every part of the Oasis, especially
when the wind blows from the south. Mosquito curtains
should be carried by, or provided for, the visitors, for fever

set of offices tof oasis Railway Administration, and a number
of small, clean houses, wherein the traveller can find board
and lodging,, Everything is very clean. Soon after leaving the
cultivated land of the Nile Valley the railway proceeds in a
suuth-westerly direetinn up the wen Eamhtttl, at the end of
which it reaches the plateau. The geologist will find much to
interest him as he passes up from the valley to the plateau.
It then continues its course in the same direction to AlTurutubah, 57 miles from Khiirgah junction. Here there
is a deep shaft, which at one time appears to have been a well.
