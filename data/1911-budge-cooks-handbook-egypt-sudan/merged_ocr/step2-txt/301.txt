72 THE TURQUOISE AND COPPER MINES.
Sflwik 11y a winding path, the traveller seen arrives at
1'11.111111 Marattamah, near which is the famous 1iarhtfit alkhtidirn.

To reach tjiarahit arKhirdiin a climb of alitittt gee feet Ill) very
difficult reati meet be made "A scramble over a rough slide
"of loose sandstone at the upper end 1711' the valley, tt
4h treacherous sloping, ledge of rock overhanging an awkward
"precipice, and a steep ravine which brings into play 1111 ene's
"gymnastic capabilities, leads to an extensive plateau hmken
If up he many deep ravines and rising knolls," On tine ef the
small peaks is a heap of ruins of walls made of sandstone, and
round about are tirel-teti columns anti sandstonc, some
still ie rim, hut the greater numher have fallen down: all these
are enclosed by the ruins of all outer wall. In the reign of
tittien-hetep III a small riock-riwit satwtuary waa made here,
and furnished with an anttrchamlrur, until Thothmcs III
enlarged the building on the west, and added a small what,
with an outer court. Within the walls ef tltese numereus stelre,
recording the lives and deeds of Egyptian eftieials, were set up,
and them time to time additions to the main building were. made
by later kings. The temple was dedicated to Hather, the lady

"1% 1.111, the "land of

in it were niches, intended tu hold statues; til" the higher mining
eflicials and military eIIictrrs, hut these were all found to he
empty. The form under which this goddess Wits worshipped
was that of a cow, and the'l molten t-alf" which Aaron made
(Exodus xxxii. i) for the Israelites to worship during the
absence of Merger; was, 1111 1111111111, "fashioned with a grating
tool" inte 11 resemhlanee ef Hather.'l'he Israelites, in fact,
influenced by the prevailing local worship ef Hathei', forced
Aaron to fall in with the Custom of the natives of Sinai, and
gave him their gold ornaments to make the "molten calf."
The walls were ornamented with painted reliefs, and traces
of the inscriptions which descrihed them, and recorded the
titles of the king and the names of his gods, still remain.
The enter wall encloses a space about Iys feet long and "feet
bread, and there is reason for believing that a sanctuary steed
here for more than 1,300 years, tie, from the XIIth to the
XXth dynasty, during which period the mines in the neighheurheed were worked by the Pharaohs with mere er less
regularity. 573

The mines were situated in the Wfidi Nash, and
between them and the temple the valley was eccupied hy

slag which vary in thickpess from t2 feet at the haste. to 4 feet
at the tops 1 this slag is not natural. anti authorities are agreed
in thinking that it represents the remains of the smelting
eperatinns which were carried 1111 near the temple. Lepsius
thought that the place was chosen on eeerittttt of the keen
draught of wind which is always hIrnving there, and which

quantities of feel weuld he required for Smelting the copper

and that the ttmmlry enjnjred ct larger rainfall than at present.

Leaving the mines the mute is resumed in the With Stiwik,
and eventually Wfidi al-Ijlemr is reached: this leads into
Witdt Shatstkah, and in thie Course the traveller arrives at
Sues. In the hrief descriptions of the places, ete, passed an the
roads to and from Sinai no attempt has been made either to
trace the course of the Israelites 111 their journey to Sinai, er te
identify their halting places. A mere statement of the opinions
of one authority 01' another would be misleading in most cases,
and the space available here is me limited to admit the introduction of general arguments. On one point, however, it is
important to state a few facts, tie, the Sinaitic Inscriptions,
for the most extraordinary statements have been made about
them. According to the old traveller Cosmos Indictrpleitstes
(am. 536) they were written by the Hebrews themselves, in
