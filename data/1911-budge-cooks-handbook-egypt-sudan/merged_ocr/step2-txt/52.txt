Second and First Cataracts ie 214 tithes, and the stream is mi
an average mien li-et wine. The river in this reach is provided
with gigantic spurs, which were htiitt tw nnc nf the ancient
kings tn cnllect snil nn the sides in then ], and to train the
river in summer. The First Cataract is three miles long,
and in the Course of it the titer tirnps between It } and 1? feet.
The Egyptians at ent- period of their history, tnr snnie
nrnnaainntalile reasntn lieliet'etl that tht- source of the Nile
was near fits-withI and that it lay under two rocks, which they
t'elled { Et-Jtt'l'l; these rocks art: Inentinnetl try lterndntns,
who calls thrm KprE-q-'u and MtI-g'u, and he say; that they
were situated hetweeit the Islands of Iilephantine and Pbilax
Mubammitdait writers also thouy, lti that the Nile Spring: were
at Aswan. From Aswan tn the Barrage, whit'h lies a little
to the north of Cairn, the distance i'i about 600 miles.
Classical writers tell its that in ancient days the Kile
emptied itself into lllt' Sctt by seven mouths, lo which
were given the names Pelusiac, Tanitic, I'tlcnclcsian1 Phat
nitic, lteihitie, and Canopic. Forvtotett miles to
the north of Cairo the Nile hecnntes twn liranchesJ which
are known as the Rosetta and Damietta arms respectively;
each of these is about 150 miles long.

It has already heen said that a register of the height of the
Nile flood was found at biennial": in the Second Cataract, and
that it dated from 2300 1: .C., and we must nette that a Nile
gaunt: existed hit the Islant'l nti lilephantine, nppnsitc tn the
town of Aswan, at the foot of the Cataract, from very early
times. It seems that the readings of the gauge at
Filrcphantittc' were always used as a hasc for calculating
the general pmsperity of I'lgypt year by year. In the reign
of Severus an nt'ticer nf the Roman garrison there tintntl
an exceptinnally high Nile, hut the maximum flood mark

a'l I metres higher than the mark made by the Roman officer.
