other important things found was a potsherd bearing the
name at a king similar to that at Smart-that, and a fragment

the use at the word pre dynastie when applied to tenths eentaining hudies in a rrritithing position, Hints, and red pets with
hints: rims, is not always; correct. He thinks that the level of
