CHAPTER II.
The Religion of the Ancient Egyptians.

THE earliest proof that the Egyptians ttnssessetl religintts
beliefs is afforded ly the prc-dyttastit1 graves which haw; been
excavated at ("telae-lett, .lhsialicidalr, anti nther sttes during
the last 17 wars. in addition to the htnnanlrematns
whiclt were tlenesitetl itt them either as whale nr titsjemted

merely a tirelmtgatien ttr renewal et- the life which a man led
upon earth, and that they imagincd it would ittuludu joys and
pleasures. perhaps alsn rewartlsI nta material character. Where,

however, asstttttc that the hetieis til the same nt' the [ .tennles ant ] trihes til-r t-lternnrtiteast tilttartet' nt':'tt'rieat whe- lit'e tlttLlE-T the same- ['titldjttt'lllat as

generally, it seems that thetirtmlttye itgyttttans ttenttletl earthj
air, river, and sky with spirits tir beings, some: of which were
benevolent and that to these they
attrihttteti yarietts degrees el' newer. The greater number
of such beings were ytl'tibalily restartleti hy them as hetng fit a
nature like tmtt: themselves; and there was perhaps a time
when the Egyptians tlitl net helieye iii the eslstenee nf any
beings whn were different from themsuh'cs.

What is known of the religion of Egypt in dynastic
times suggests that in the earliest period of its history each
community possessed its own supurnarural huing or spirit, who
had his own peculiar term, and his own special manner of
making himself manifest, and it is pretty certain that the views
which the bulk at thecommunity held concerning him dictated
