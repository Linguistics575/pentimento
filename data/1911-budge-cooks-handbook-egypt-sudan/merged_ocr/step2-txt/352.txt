8. Dér al-Madinat. The temple built in this place
owes its name tn the Coptic Dér, or Monastery, which stood
near here when Thebes was the home of a flourishing Coptic
community, and was dedicated to Saint Paul of Pikolol, of
whom, however, nothing is known, The monastery must have
contained a society of considerable size, for it is said to have
possessed { tee stewards. The small Egyptian temple which
stands between the Celesst and Madinat Hahn, was begun by
Ptolemy IV, Philopator, and continued hy Ptl: my VII,
Philometor, and finishted by Ptolemy IX, Energetes II. It is
built of the ordinary sandstone of the tlistriet, and though in
many respects it resernhles most of the funeral temples built by
the Ptolemies, it is a heautiful little esample ef Its elass. It
appears to have been dedicated to more than one of the
goddesses of the underworld, hut Hathur was regarded as its
tutelary deity. The capitals of some of the columns are
Hather-headed, and ever the doorway of the large chamber
are the heads of the Seven Hathors, who, in their forms of
cows, supplied the deceased with feed in the underworld, In
one of the chambers is a relief representing the Judgment
Scene, which forms the Vignette of the CKKVth Chapter of

the principal religious views el' the Egyptians. The temple
was much visited by travellers in ancient times, as the number
of names written up the walls testify, and ly hath Greeks and
Cepts it was regarded as very holy.
