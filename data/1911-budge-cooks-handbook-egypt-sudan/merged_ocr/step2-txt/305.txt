the Israelites to latiti through the lick! of Kean, and by the
fortresses of Etham, Migdol, near Pelusium, the great Hirhnnian
Eng, and se into Syria,'l'he great drawback
to this theory is the estrenie unhrnhaliility that the Israelites
would have ventured to march straight into the line of strong
Egyptian fortresses which bad linen built en the eastern frontier
of the Delta, and which clearly it was to their interest to avoid.
Moreover, we knew that Ethan ] anti Migdol wen; common
terms for Fi fortress," and there must have lieen several Ethanis

Taken together the known facts indicate that the Israelites
made their way into the desert hy the nearest rnute [ rnssihler
and that mute probably lay through some part of the enuntry
new neeuliied by the modern Lake Timsah, which is relatively
close to the eastern end of the Wiuli Ttlmikit. The narrative
of the Book of Exodus calls the water which the Israelites
crossed the "Yam Snell," tie, the "sca of reeds," a name
which would never have been given to the sea in general; and
there is no doubt that they called the water by that name
