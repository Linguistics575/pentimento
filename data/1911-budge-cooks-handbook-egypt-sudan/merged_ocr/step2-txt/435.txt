made that its general eurrienlum is ten utilitarian, hut, as Mr.
Currie'iafs, it is essential l'nr lltfttltle tn remember the eharaeter
till the [ tettlile with whom ht: is dealing. "A Inunplc whose

is quite. clear that the work of the Cnllege as an edueatinnal
pnwer, hnth trein a thcurutical und practical point of vicw, is
proceeding on the right limes, and the great sueeess already
achieved speaks walunis in praise of Mr, Currie's; prudent,
judicious and eautinus management nF the great Institution
which has hum committed to his cam. The plan en which he
works, and the pulley behind it, and his difficulties, are well
illustrated by the following remarks taken from his Retort,
dated 30th June, tnte:

The Colluge has felt the strain of [ irngress hnrward
has hardly bccn maintained this year. The large new
Primary School was completed in December, 1909, and
will he in partial occupation in October next. The greater
part at the Primary School will he housed therein, but it has
net heen found possible completely to separate the Primary

It has been eren tnund imnnssihle tn ennalilete the nnt'leus nl'

Apart frnm the nl'n'inus desirability nt' emlrlnying natives of

material standpoint, the thwernment is in the lung run gut tn
mnre espense hy its high wages and sneeial pensinn rates than by
the maintenanee eta Heenndary Hehnnl, even on a generous scale,
But it Would ln- ungrateful of him if he did not admit that the

Turning tn the various educational units which taken
together compose the Gordon Cellegej Mr. Currie speaks at
the Primary School, which bas been attended by ten pupils;
the Training College-vernacular and English-by s78, of
which 150 belong to the vernacular side, and the upper school
for the training of engineers and surveyors by 23 students.

the popularity of the Military School among the inhabitants
at the country, both Arab and Sfldani. Some 20 young men
have new received commissions in the famous Black Battalions,
er in the new Arab levies new being raised. They have
almost all been well reported on. He understand that the
responsible Army authorities propose to increase this school
