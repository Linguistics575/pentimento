474 Mecc-xn PYRAMID AT citrate

I'with figures carved an it; an this read these TO years were
"ex ended, and in forming the subterraneous apartments an the
"hil, en which the pyramids stand, which he had made as a burial
if vault for himself, in an island, formed by draining a canal from the
"Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting the pyramid itself:
"ef this, which is square. each face is h plethra { Bee feet }, and the
'- height is the same; it is composed of polished stones, and jointed
"with the greatest exactness; none at the stones are less than
li 30 feet. This pyramid was built thus; in the form of steps, which
"seine call Crosse, others hemides. When they had first built it in
"this manner, they raised the remaining stones by machines made
"of short pieces of wood: having lifted them from thegrenne to
"the first range of steps, when the stone arrived there. it was put
t, on another machine that steed ready en the first range. and front
it this it was drawn to the second range on another machine, for the
"machines were equal in number to the ranges of steps. er they
"*' retrieved the machine, which was only one, and portable, to eac
"range in succession, whenever they wished to raise the stone
"higher, for I should relate it in both ways, as it is related. The
"highest parts of it, therefore, were first finished, and afterwards
"they completed the parts next following, but last of all they
"finished the parts an the ground and that were lewes't.

"On the pyramid is shown an inscription, in Egyptian characters,
"how much was ex ended in radishes, onions, and garlic for the
"werh men l which t e interpreter, as I well remember, reading the
I. inscription, told me amounted to 1.600 talents of silver. And if
"this he really the case, how much mere was probably expended
"in iron tents, in bread, and in clothes for the labourers, since they
"occupied in building the works the time which I mentioned, and
"no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and drawing the
"stones, and in farming the snhtetraneeus excavatien. [ It is
"related ] that Cheeps reached such a degree of infamy, that being
"in want of money, he prostituted his own daughter in a brothel,
"and ordered her to extort, they did net say how much; but she
"enacted a certain sum of money, privately, as much as her father
"ordered her; and contrived to leave a monument of herself, and
"asked everyone that came in to her to give her a stone towards
It the edifice she designed: at these stones they said the pyramid
"was built that stands in the middle of the three, before the great
"pyramid. each side of which is a plethron and a half in length."

"The Egyptians say that this Cheeps reigned So years; and
"when he died his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom;
"and he followed the same practices as the ether, both in other
"respects and in building a pyramid; which does not come up te
"the dimensions of his brother's, for I myself measured them; nor
" has it subterraneous chambers; nor does a channel from the Nile
"flow ta it, as te the ether; but this fiews threugh an artificial
"aqueduct round an island within, in which they say the body of
"Cheeps is laid. Having laid the first course of variegated
.. Ethiopian stones, less in height than the ether by are feet, he built
"it near the large pyramid. They both stand en the same hill,
"which is about 100 feet high, Chephren, they said, feigned
'56 years. Thus me years are reckoned, during which the
"Egyptians suffered all kinds of calamities, and for this length of
I. time the temples were classed and never opened. From the hatred
