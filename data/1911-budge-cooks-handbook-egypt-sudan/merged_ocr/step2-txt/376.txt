of the temple and other buildings at Hem Umhes are among
the most striking in Egypt, but, until the clearance of the

site which M. tie Morgan made in 1393 A, it was impossible to get an exact idea tof their arrangement. It is pretty
certain that a temple dedicated to some god must have
stood here in the Early Iintpire, and we know from M.
Maspero's discoveries, here in 1532, that Amenophis I and
'I'hnthmes III, kings of the IE'IIIth tlynasty, earrietl out
repairs en the temple which was in existence in their days;

The Mammisi, or small temple wherein the festivals of the
birth of the gods were celebrated, stood in front of the great
temple, to the left; it consisted of a small courtyard, hall of
columns, and the shrine. It was built by Ptolemy LN, who is
depicted on the walls making offerings to Sehek, lrathttThnth,
and other deities, The best relief remaining { see de Morgan,
Kern ease, p. so) is en the north wall, and represents the king
en a fowling expedition through marshes much frequented by
water fowl.
