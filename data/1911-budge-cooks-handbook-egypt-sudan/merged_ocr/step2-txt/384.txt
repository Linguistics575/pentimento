The First Cataract, ealletl Shelltil by the Arabs, hegins a
little he the south ef Aswrin, and ends a little to the north
of the Island at l'hilte: six great cataracts are found en the
Nile, but this is the must generally known. Here the Nile
becomes narrow and flows hetween twr; mountains, which
descend nearly perpendicularly to the river, the course of which
is obstructed by huge boulders and small rocky islands and
barriers, which stand en different levels, and cause the falls at
water which have given this part at the river its name. On the
west side the obstacles are net so numerous as an the east, and
sailing and rowing boats can ascend the cataract en this side
when the river is high. The noise made by the water is at
times very great, but it has been greatly exaggerated by both
ancient and modern travellers, some of whom ventured to assert
that the "enter fell from several places in the mountain more

fountains of the Nile were in this cataract, and Herodotus"
