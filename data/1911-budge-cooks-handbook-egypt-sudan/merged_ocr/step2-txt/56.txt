sysimatirmily according to the needs and wants at the various
districts at different seasons of the year. The three greatest
and most important of these are: { I } The Harme'es ttt the

rose at Hemnah, and we knew that en the front nf the stene
tpiay at Thehes Ejhashantl l and his sueeessers alse r'eenrded
the heights of the Nile lleetls in various years: but, se far as
we knew, no attempt was ever made hy the aneient l'lgyptians
te httild a dam m' hnn-age across the main stream, er te
regulate the supply of its waters en any large scale. Yet the
idea of a dam must have occurred to many of the great
engineers at the Pharaohs, and the only wonder is that
dmenemhfit lll, who did so much for the irrigation of Egypt,
emitted te tale: in hand such an elwietrs werk et' improvement,
According to Major Sir R. H.1trnwn. lt.lf,, Cairo, 1896), Clot hey has put it on record that
Napnlenn thaltaparte prephesied that the day would came when
barrages would be thrown across the Rosetta and ltamietta
arms of the Kile, and that these, by means tit' setter dams,
would allow the whole of the Nile stream to flow into either
branch, and in this manner the inundation would be doubled.

Soon after Mubamnvad'Ali hemmc Viceroy of Egypt he hegan
to develop cotton gnawing. and he found that the basin system of
irrigation, which was then in operation, was unsuitable for his
purpose In 1833 he decided that it was necessary to increase
the water in the Damietta branch, and in order to et't'eet this
he proposed to dam the waters of the Resetta branch, which
supplied Alexandria and a whale province with water, and
turn them into the Damietta branch. The Viceroy abandoned
his scheme on the suggestion of Linant de Bellefonds Bey, and
agreed to his proposal he threw a barrage across the head ef

time, although 47,000,000 francs had been spent en the

Commissions were appointed to inquire into the barrage
question, and in the latter year, because water was urgently
