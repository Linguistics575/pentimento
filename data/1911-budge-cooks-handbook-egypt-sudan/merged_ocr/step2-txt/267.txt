51112 THMUIS--MENDEEt

Rameses II. Instead of being dated in the day and month
and year of Rameses II in which it was set up it is dated in
the 400th year of the Hyltses hing Hubti, a very remarkable fact. After Mariette had read and copied the test he
reliuried the steie in the place where he had intuit ] it.

Under the Roman Empire'l'anis still held a high position
among the towns of the Helm, and the Egyptians eunsidered
it of sufficient importance [ 0 make it an episcopal see. In the
list of the bishops who were present at the Council of Chalccdon
(am, 451), the name of Apollonius, Bishop ofTanis, is found.
Tanis must net he confounded with Tennis, the seaport town
which grew and increased in imtiertanre as tanis declined;
and it is difficult to understand why Tanis should have
dwindled away, considering that Arab writers have described
its climate as being mest salubrinus, and its winter like summer.
Water was said to Row there at all times, and the inhabitants
could water their gardens at their will; no place in all Egypt,
save the Fayyimt, could he compared with it for fertility, and
for the beauty of its gardens and sinus. Either the sixth century
of our era the sea invaded a large portion of the territory around
Tanis, and it went On encroaching each year little by little, until
all its villages were submerged. The inhabitants removed their
dead te Tennis, and established themselves there; Tennis
was evacuated by its inhabitants an. I tea, and the town itself
was destroyed Al }. read.

4. About half-way between Sin and At-i-liturgy') is TellNab√©shah, which marks the site of a fortified frontier town
under Ratneses II, and no doubt formed one of the chain of
fortresses which he built across the northeast border of the
Delta. The town existed in the KXV'lth dynasty, for some of
the kings of that dynasty repaired the temple of the local
goddess There is nothing of interest at TelrNabtshah.

5. Near Sinbaltiiwtm which is en the main line between
Kai-gash; and blansftrah, is the mound which the Arabs eall
Tamni al-Amdid, and which marks the site of the classical
Thmuis. Close by is another mound, to which ancient Arab
writers gave the name of Al-Manda; this marks the site
of Mendes. In, er a little before, the Ptolemaic Period
Thmuis and hlendes were incorporated, probably because the
inhabitants of both places worshipped the ram. In the fourth
century of our era Thmuis was a flourishing town, and
possessed its own magistrates, and was exempt from the
jurisdiction of the Governor of Alexandria. It was aise an

episcopal see, and Serapion, one of its bishops, is mentioned
by Heraltleanus. The impertanee ef'i'hntuis-itlendes is
proved by the fact that Amasis lI dedicated te the Ram-grod
a shrine, which was 23 feet high, and Ptolemy II restored the
sanctuary, and took part in the ancient ceremonies which were
performed in that city at the installation of a new Hate, The
statues of Ptolemy H and his wife Arsinoti were placed near
the Ram in the procession, and were carried through the
streets followed ly the chief men of the city, and by crowds
of rejoicing citizens. A few Egyptian monuments are still be
be seen at this place, The name Tamai al--r'tmdid represents
the two names Thmuis and 1fcruits'Tamai = Thmuis, and
Amdid is a corruption of Mendes, which is the Cheek form of

the Egyptian name Lia-neb'tet, 12% E2? fl 3. There are a

great many mounds in this district which conceal remains of
ancient Egyptian buildings, and there is he deuht that under
the EIch dynasty the whole region was full of small towns,
many of which were strongly built and fortified, so that they
might resist the attacks of the nomad tribes from the Eastern
Desert and Hyde. It seems, however, that they had to be
built on mounds artificially constructed, the object heing to
keep them above the waters of the inundation. The saturated
soil and the storms of war and conquest do away with any hope
that many fragile objects or papyri will be found among the
reins.

6. Close to the railway which joins Zakssth and Abe
Hammid, and a little to the south of it, is Saft, al-Hannah,
which was explored by Professor Nasilie in 1884; it marks the
site of a large, aneient Egyptian tnwn, in which Rameses 11
built a fine temple, for a colossal statue of this king in black
granite was found in a cornfield near the village. Some 40 or
So years age the Jelltthin discovered a rectangular, monolithic
shrine, measuring y feet by s feet 9 inches by s feet, covered
inside and net with beautifully executed inscriptions and scenes.
The local Pasha, who thought that geld was hidden inside it,
promptly had it broken in pieces, two of which were carried to
his farm, and the remainder were used for building the bridges
of Fait and Tahra Hamad i The shrine was dedicated to the
Ram-ged and the Hawk-god of the East by Neetanebus II,
the last native king of Egypt, about 360 BAC, A restoration of
the sanctuary of these gods was made by Ptolemy il, probably
about me years later.
