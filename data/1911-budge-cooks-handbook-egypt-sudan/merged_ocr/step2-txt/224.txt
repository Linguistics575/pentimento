In 973 the Khalifah Mn'izz, the Cutting: of his
anrestnrs, made an entry into the city which tiawhar had built
fur him, and tareaehetl the Friday sermtat in Al Azhar masque.
Cairn, hnweyer, was not intended fur the liuhlie nt the capital,
and its esrlusiye eharaeter is indicated by the appellation
"NNahrtriah," is.,.. the guarded," which is; sometimes attached

Saladin built the famous dike at Gizah, and he funded a
number of colleges both in Cairo and Alexandria. On

Cairo, and en the following clay Salim, Sultan of Turkey, was
publicly prayed fur in all the'1tosiitles of Cairn; thus Egypt
became a province, of the'l'urkish Ihnhire, with Cairn For its
capital.

The history of Cairo from this period to the time of the
French Expedition under Napoleon is of little interest, and
the chronicles of the governors recognized by Turkey resolve
themselves into little more than accounts of intrigues, rebellions,
