the fortress fragments of stone were found hearing the ear
tuuehes tit Rameses II and'rhothmcs III. A portion of the
citadel, or "keep," still remains, and when complete it is
thought to have had fnur Storeys and to have heen about
65 feet high. At tint: time one of its chambers was used as a
ehnreh. In anti abntit the area of the fortress are remains of
churches, cemeteries, nee. { in the iedge of rock which skirts
the desert are the ruins of two Coptic churches. The
nnrthern ehnreh was ahnut filfi feet long, and 42 feet timed, and
appears tn haye heen limit in the ninth century. The snnthern
ehnreh is a little lent-get. heing nearly 75 feet lung and nearly
40 feet In-rand, and it was probably built in the eighth century.
A gIIIIIIIe at the plan published by Mr, Mileham shows that
the. huiitiing is aslteitrI and the maintenance of the fahrie must
have caused the ecclesiastical authorities of the day much
anxiety. It helps us to understand why the ruin of such
churches is Si) complete. Opposite to the village of Farms, en
the east hank of the File. are also ruins of two Coptic
churches; they are close to the village of Addendan. The
northern church stands LIII Gclyel fialrilrah, which marks the
hnuntiary hetween Egypt and the.% din, and is about 75 feet
lung and 42 feet side, The columns are sandstone monoliths
about { t } feet high. The southern church is smaller, stands
behind the hill, and was of unusual construction, It had a
central dome with a vaulted aisle on each side of it.
