I'with figures carved an it; an this road these TO years were

(i hil, on which the pyramids stand, which he had made as a burial
if vault for himself, in an island, formed by draining a canal from the
al Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting the pyramid itself:
LE of this, which is square, each face is 8 plethra { Baa feet), and the
1. height is the same; it is composed of polished stones, and jointed
"with the greatest exactness; none at the stones are less than
li 30 feet. This pyramid was built thus; in the form of steps. which
ls some call Crosse, others hemides. When they had first built it in
"this manner, they raised the remaining stones by machines made
"of short pieces of wood: having lifted them from thegrenne to
"the first range of steps, when the stone arrived there, it was put
t, on another machine that stood ready on the first range. and front
it this it was drawn to the second range on another machine, for the
"machines were equal in number to the ranges of steps, or theg
ii removed the machine, which was only one, and portable, to eac
li range in succession, whenever they wished to raise the stone
"higher, for I should relate it in both ways, as it is related. The
t, highest parts of it, therefore, were first finished, and afterwards
"they completed the parts next following, but last of all they
"finished the parts an the ground and that were lowes):.

"On the pyramid is shown an inscription, in Egyptian characters,
"how much was ex ended in radishes, onions, and garlic for the
It warhtnea; which t e interpreter, as I well remember, reading the
I. inscription, told me amounted to 1.600 talents of silver. And if
"this be really the case, how much more was probably expended
"in iron tents, in bread, and in clothes for the labourers, since they
"occupied in building the works the time which I mentioned, and
"no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and drawing the
"stones, and in forming the sutrtetraneous excavation, [ It is
II related ] that Cheops reached such a degree of infamy, that being
El in want of money, he prostituted his own daughter in a brothel,
"and ordered her to extort, they did not say how much; but she
I' enacted a certain sum of money, privately, as much as her father
"ordered her; and contrived to leave a monument of herself, and
"asked everyone that came in to her to give her a stone towards
It the edifice she designed: at these stones they said the pyramid
"was built that stands in the middle of the three, before the great
"pyramid, each side of which is a plethron and a half in length."

by llertuhittts { thigh ii, I27):

"The Egyptians say that this Cheops reigned So years; and
"when he died his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom;
"and he followed the same practices as the other, both in other
"respects and in building a pyramid; which does not come up to
'l the dimensions of his brother's, for I myself measured them; nor
" has it subterraneous chambers; nor does a channel from the Nile
"flow ta it, as to the other; but this fhrws through an artificial
FI aqueduct round an island within, in which they say the body of
"Cheops is laid, Having laid the first course of variegated
.. Ethiopian stones, less in height than the other toy 40 feet, he built
"it near the large pyramid, They both stand on the same hill,
"which is about 100 feet high, Chephren, they said, feigned
'56 years. Thus me years are reckoned, during which the
"Egyptians suffered all kinds of calamities, and for this length of
I. time the temples were classed and never opened. From the hatred
't they bear them, the Egyptians are not very willing to mention
"theirnames', but call the pyramids after Phuition, a shepherd, who
