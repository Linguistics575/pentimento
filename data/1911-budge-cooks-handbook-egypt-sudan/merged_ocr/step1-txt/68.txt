CHAPTER IX.
The Religion of the Ancient Egyptians.

THE earliest proof that the 1iigyptiarrs tatsscsscti rcltgicrtts
beliefs is afforded ly the prc-dyttastit1 graves which haw; been
excavated at t'ichciclt, .lhsialicidalr, Ahythss, and other sites during
the last 17 wars. in addition to the human rcmains
which Acre deposited in them wither M wholu or disjointed
bodies, have hem: found jars and vases containing substances
which were intended to scrt'c as food for the dcceascd on his
journey to scant: place tit" vts,
of flint whct't-with hc might titrfcnti himself against thc foes of
various kinds which he was cxpcctcd to mcet int thc road
thither. Thus it is It'itttl't' that the pre-dynastic Egyptians
hciict'cti that a man would enjoy lift: in 50111:; form, and in some
place to pt1ov" uicajflm with
means; it is pmhahlc that titty considered such a life in he
merely It prolongation tTI' rcnctwtl lot. thc hfc which a man led
upon earth, and that they imagincd it would ittuludu joys and
plcastmes, pcrhnps aiscn rcwirrds, ofa nuttcrial Character. Where,
however, that life was lircd, or the tttaltncr tit rcgtutt III which
it was lived, wt: hart: no itluttns of knowing, and whether this
life after death was everlasting nr nut we know not. We may,
however, asstttttc that the beiicfs of the primitive-' ligyptinns
resembled those of some of the peoples; and tribes of the. northeast quarter of Africa, who live under the same vondititans as
they lived, and tat land which is similar to theirs. Speaking
generally, it seems that the primitive Jtgyptians ttctiplmi earth,
air, river, and sky with spirits tir beings, some: of which were
benevolent and scintc malcvaolcnt, and that to these they
attributed various dugrces: of pthr. The greater number
of such beings wen: probably regarded by thcttt as bctttg fit a
nature like unto thctttsch'cs; and thus: was perhaps a time
when the, Egyptians did not hciicvc in thc t-slstrttcc nf any
beings who wcrc different from themsuh'cs.

What is known of the religion of Egypt in dynastic
times suggests that in the earliest period of its history each
community possessed its own supurnarural huing or spirit, who
had his own peculiar form, and his own special manner of
making himself manifest, and it is pretty certain that the views
which the bulk at thecommunity held concerning him dictated
