and a closer examination reveals the fact that this strip of land,
though consisting chiefly of swamp and sand, has for thousands
of years been a serious Obstacle to communication by ship
between Europe and the East. At the south end of the
Isthmus is the Gulf of Suez, and at the. north of it 111115 the
Mediterranean, It is possible that in remote ages the sea
flowed entirely over the place where the Isthmus now is, but
some authorities hesitate to assert this, because the marine
