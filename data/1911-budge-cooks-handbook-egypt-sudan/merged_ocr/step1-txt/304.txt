"all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

1111111111115 local knowledge of the 1iiastern 1151111, and the

imy kind has been round which can be said truthfully to refer
In any way to their sojourn in Egypt. No surprise need be
felt at this, for it was not the custom of Egyptian kings to
commemorate the deeds of the peoples who were subject to
them, That a great exodus of Israelites from ldeypt took
plane cannot be 115111111111, but it is equally beyond 11511111 that
the story of it in its present form is the work of one whose
knowledge of the sequence of events was incomplete.

The date of the Exodus and the route which was followed
by the children of Israel on their departure from Egypt have
gwen rise to endless discussions and theories, none of which,
however, explain away the difficulties of the Bible narrative,
The exodus may have taken place 1:11:15 5.11., 1314 B.C.,
or 1335 5.11., but the all-important fact to be considered is
that, speaking historically, it could only have happened on
the scale described in the Book of Exodus, in the reign ot
Menerrhthah during the period of the rising of the Libyans
and others against the Egyptian power. As for the route
