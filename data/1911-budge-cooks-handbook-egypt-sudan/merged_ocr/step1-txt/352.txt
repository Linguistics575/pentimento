8. Dér al-Madinat. The temple built in this place
owes its name tn the Coptic Dér, or Monastery, which stood
near here when Thebes was the home of a flourishing Coptic
community, and was dedicated to Saint Paul of Pikolol, of
whom, however, nothing is known, The monastery must have
contained a society of considerable size, for it is said to have
possessed { tee stewards. The small Egyptian temple which
stands between the Cnlessi and Madinat Hahn, was begun by
Ptolemy IV, Philopator, and continued hy Ptl: my VII,
Philometor, and finishted by Ptolemy IX, Energetes II. It is
built of the ordinary sandstone of the tlistriet, and though in
many respects it resernhles most of the funeral temples built by
the Ptolemies, it is a heeutithl little esrtntple of its class. It
appears to have been dedicated to more than one of the
goddesses of the underworld, ht1t Hsther was regarded as its
tutelary deity. The capitals of some of the columns are
Hathor-headed, and over the doorway of the large chamber
are the heads of the Seven Hathors, who, in their forms of
cows, supplied the deceased with food in the underworld, In
one of the chambers is a relief representing the Judgment
Scene, which forms the Vignette of the CXXVth Chapter of

the Esme oftht Futd.. The chief interest of the scene here is
that it proclaims the nature of the huiltiing, and proves how
ttnsietts the Ptolctttics were officially to maintain
the principal religious views el' the Egyptians. The temple
was much visited by travellers in ancient times, as the number
of names written on the walls testify, and ly hath Greeks and
Cepts it was regarded as very holy.

development tit Thehnn eenquest and civilization. The tombs
in their leading features resemble each other, and there is at
times a sameness in the silhjeets represented, and even in the
treatment of them. The scenes depicted comprise representations of agricultural operations, of the amusements of the
deceased, of festivals and banquets, of official functions in
which the deceased played a prominent part-eg, in the receipt
of tribute from vassal nations, and of funeral rites and
ceremonies. The scenes are usually painted in tempera upon
a thin layer of white plaster laid upon the bedding of mud, or
perhaps very poor dark-coloured mortar, with which the limestone slabs that formed the walls were covered, Among such.
tombs may be specially mentioned c
