the waters 0i thc hikc arc shaihim', and the bottom is mud,
which has heen depcesitred lsy the i'chisiac, Tartitic, and
Mendusian hranchcs of the Nile, all of' which Ilow through the
iakc.'l'he hanks on each side of the canal were formed of
the materials which wcrc (trudged up from thc. railway. In the district
which is now nearly all covcrcd hy Lake Manieilah stiitid the
famous city of'lhnis, thc capital rsf thc Tm/ttit: Ncaic, which is
familiar to all under the name of Zoan (sw Nttmhcrs xiii, 22) ",
the whole district itself is prohnhly that which is called the
Field of loan in Psalm Ixsviii, is, 43. The fields for
many miles round were exceedingly fertile, and wheat and
vincs wcrc grown'ahurulantly, About the eighth of tenth
century, through causes which havc hu-n explained elsewhere,
the SCO invaded the district which, until the present day, has
remained a shallow marsh.'l'lw draining of Lake Maliaiilah

At the end of Isikc Mansalah is Al-Kantarah, is., "the
Bridge", the place hears this Iiaiiic hccaiisc it stands on the
narrow strip of land which divides Lake, Marrcllah from Lake
Balats, and which may be regarded as a hritlgc. As a
matter of fact the old caravan mule hctwccn Egypt and Syria
passed over this "bridge" A littlc to the north of Al-liar/tarid,
are the mounds of Tcll Irs1farinah, which mark the site of the
city Tahapanes (Jeremiah ii, to), i.e., the Daphne of the
Greeks. The canal runs for two miles between low sands-hills,
when it enters Lake Halal }, which is eight miles long; at the
end of the lake is Al-Far-do, antl here the canal enters a
cutting which cxtemls t0 Lake'rimsiUr Flour miles south of
Al-Farid is A1-Ciisr, which is the deepest cutting along the
whole course of the canal, for mud and sand had to be
excavated to at depth of about 70 feet, Three lines of tramway were laid down, and six engines and 250 wagons were
employed in removing the soil; the work was finished in

H), the Cmtrodilc lake, stands the fhourishing little town
of Isrnda'iliyahi which was called after Isma'il Pasha; the
population is alyout Ir,448. The town contains 111:1in pretty
Villas; with carilc-ns, and the verdant fa'n'n't' Ircc has hccn
planted generously alcmy the roads, which arc clearly tlciined
and well kept. A great deal of taste has been tiisplayis'l bv the
inhabitants in laying out the strccts and squares,: tml looking
ton the town from a distance, it sciaiis iiicrciiihic that less than
50 ycars ago its Site was a howling wilderness, Here thc

From 1862, when the town was fiitiiiilcti, until'sri the health
of its inhabitants was Very good; in the hatter year, however,
335 Ca'hta of fever appeared, and thc tliscasc liccaaic endetnic,
and between 188.; and 1897 there were 1,700 cases of fever
each year, and hctwccn 1303 and 1902 there were 1,800 cases
of lever. Up in thc end nf 1807 thc Sucs Canal Company had
epent nearly Â£32,000 on sanitary works and medicine, but no
iiiiprcssicii was made on the fevt? t SthiaNucntly Majcr Ross
was invited to examine the town, and he came to the c0nclusaw: that the fever was caused by the ae/she/es mosquito,
which bred in vast numbers in the pools of stagnant water
thatlay round the town, On 11cccnilicr 23th, 1902, it was
flecidcd to adopt Major Ross's system of dealing with the
Insect, and in 1903 there were only s13 cases of fever as
against 2,200 in 1002. Of the 213 cases in 1903, 203 were
ca.ses of those who had had fever previously; thus the number
at new cases in 1003 was only 30. In recent years the number
of cases of malaria has still further diminished
