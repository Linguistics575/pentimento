fiitiwik hy a winding path, the traveller seen arrives at
Wittii Marattamah, near which is the famous 1iarhtfit alkhtidirn.

To reach tjiarahit arKhirdiin a climb of alitittt gee feet Ill) very
difficult reati meet be made "A scramble over a rough slide

4h treacherous sloping, ledge of rock overhanging an awkward
I' precipice, and a steep ravine which brings into play all ends
il gymnastic capabilities, leads to an extensive plateau hmken
If up he many deep ravines and rising knolls," On tine ef the
small peaks is a heap of ruins of walls made of sandstone, and
round about are tirel-teti columns anti sandstonc, some
still ie rim, hut the greater numlier have fallen down: all these
are enclosed by the ruins of all outer wall. In the reign of
tittien-hetep III a small riock-riwit satwtuary waa made here.
and furnished with an anttrchamlrur, until Thothmcs III
enlarged the building on the west, and added a small what,
with an outer court. Within the walls of these ntttitereus steltc,
recording the lives and deeds of Egyptian ofticia1s, were set up,
and them time to time additions to the main building were. made
by later kings. The temple was dedicated to Hather, the lady

in it were niches, intended tu hold statues; til" the higher mining

was that of a cow, and the'l molten t-alf" which Aaron made
(Exodus xxxii. i) for the Israelites to worship during the
absence of Merger; was, rm (lt'llllll, "fashioned with a grating
tool" into a reaeltthlattee of Hether.'l'he Israelites, in fact,
indtuenced by the prevailing local worship ef Hatrui, forced
Aaron to fall in with the Custom of the natives of Sinai, and
gave him their gold ornaments to make the "molten calf."
The walls were ornamented with painted reliefs, and traces
of the inscriptions which tieserihed them, and recorded the
titles of the king and the names of his gods, still remain.
The outer wall encloses a space about Iys feet long and "feet
broad, and there is reason for believing that a sanctuary stood
here for more than 1,300 years, tie, from the XIIth to the
XXth dynasty, during which period the mines in the neighbourh00d were worked by the Pharaohs with more or less
regularity. 573

The mines were situated in the Wiidt Neel). and
between them and the temple the valley was otwupied by
the miners pnd try the s; lliers who guarded them, To

Suez. In the hrief descriptions of the places, ete, passed an the
roads to and from Sinai no attempt has been made either to
trace the course of the letttehtea in their journey to Sinai, or to
identify their halting places. A mere statement of the opinions
of one authority 01' another would be misleading in most cases,
and the space available here is too limited to admit the introduction of general arguments. On one point, however, it is
important to state a few facts, tie, the Sinaitic Inscriptions,
