M, Arnélineau excavated the tombs "a number of kings of the
first three dynasties at Umin al-hiu'alo, which lies to the west
of the necroprrlis of the Middle limpire. and in the course of
his work at Abydos he also discovercd a shritw which the

Professor l'etrie also carried on excavations on M. Aniélineau's
old sites at Arryuui, mod recovertn'l a number of elijerts of the
same class as these found ly M. Anujlitteiu1. The true value

Peel, Dixon, Hall, and Legge, carried out excavations on
behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund in the Royal Tombs

other important things found was a potsherd bearing the
name of a king similar to that of Smerkhat, and a fragment
of a crystal vase. The latter once bore the name of Merpeba,
