practically an entirely new line from Widi Halfah to Kermah would
have to be built, This wonderful work was done in 13 months by a
few young Royal Engineer officers under Lieut, (now Sir Percy)
Girouard, RE. On March 21tit the Sirdar ordered the advance; by
June 4th the line was working to Ambukbl Wells. 68 miles from
Widi Halteh; on August 4th it reached K6shah, 108 miles from

Ihriuti Helfah: and on May 4th it reached Kenneth. 201 miles from
thi Halfeh. Of the 13 months occupied in its construction, five
had been almost wasted for want of engines and material, and in
repairing the damage caused by rain storms, and meanwhile, at
intervals, the Sirdar, Lord Kitchener, fought and defeated the
Dervishes at Eerket (June 7thl and elsewhere, and reconqnered the
DenkeLe revinee. The working expenses of the Kermah line were
in 1903 E, t8, tmo, and the receipts were only £511,000, of which
over £35,000 were on account of the quernment. As the line
had been lightly laid, and any idea of rebuilding it was out of the

mstion, owing to lack of funds, the Government decided to close
t e line to general traffic in MNf The portion of it from Kirshah
to Kermah (ps miles) had been laid by the British with new rails,
and it was further decided to take these up and send them ever to
the Athara, for use in the construction of the Nile- Red Sea Railway.
This was accordingly done, and now the section from Helfeh to

K6ghah is only used for administrative purposes.
