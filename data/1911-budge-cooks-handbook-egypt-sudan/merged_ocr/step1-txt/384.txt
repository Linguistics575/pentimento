little he the south ef Aswrin, anti emis a little to the north
of the Island of ['hihe: six great cataracts' are found en the
Nile, but this is the most generally known. Here the Nile
becomes narrow and flows hetween twr; mountains, which
descend nearly perpendicularly to the river, the course of which
is obstructed by huge boulders and small rocky islands and
barriers, which stand en different levels, and cause the: falls of
water which have given this part of the river its name. On the
west side the obstacles are net so numerous as cm the east, and
sailing and rowing boats can ascend the cataract en this side
when the river is high, The noise made by the water is at
times very great, but it has been greatly exaggerated by both
ancient and modern travellers, some of whom ventured to assert
that the "water fell from several places in the mountain more
"than see fect" Some ancient writers asserted that the
fountains of the Nile were in this cataract, and Herodotus"
reports that an otficial of the treasury HI" Neith at Suits stated
that the source of the Nile was here. Many of the rocks here

Middle Empire; in many places en the little islands in the
cataract quarries were worked, The island of Sahel sheulel be
