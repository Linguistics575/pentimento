to he found on the east hank of the river, but en the west bank
we have the little. roek-hewn temple of "Cru-em-heb, the last
king of the XVIIIth dynasty, conHucring the Ethiopians i here
we have. figure, of this king, and figures of Heti I, aneses 11
his son, Nftetwphilrah, ete. At Eiisiiah the Nile was worshipped,
and the little temple which Rameses li htiilt in this place seems
to have been dedicated chicfly to it. There are numerous inscriptions in many place; in man }; of the quarries, and these and the
figures they accompany are well wtorthy ofcsaminatitm iiir those
who have the time. At Silsilith the Nile narrows very much, and
it was generally thnught that a erttareet tittee existed here; them
is, however, no evidence in support of this: view, and the true
channel of the Nile lies en the other side of the mountain.
Kom Ombos, 55% miles from Cairo, on the east hank hi
the Nile, was an important place at all periods of Egyptian
histert", it was called by the itieytittians l'er-Hehek, lk the
temple of Heheh y') { the ereeet'iih-t god), and Nuhit, attti Fimlk,
by the Copts. The oldest object here is a sandstone gateway
which Thothmcs III dedicated tn the gird Seiteki The ruins
of the temple and other buildings at Kom Omhos are among
the most striking in Egypt, but, until the clearance of the

site which M. tie Morgan made in 1393 A, it was impossible to get an exact idea tof their arrangement. It is pretty
certain that a temple dedicated to some god must have
stood here in the Early Jimpirc, and we know from M.
Maspero's discoveries, here in 1532, that Amenophis I and
'l'htithtttes III, kings of the Xi'IIIth A, vnasty, earrietl out
repairs on the temple which was in existence in their days;
but at the present time 1m parts (it the buildings at Kent Ottthes
are older than the reigns of the l-ittiiettties. Thanks tn the
labours of M. the Morgan, the ruins may he thtts ciassitied _
The Mammisi, the Great Temple, arid the Chapel of Hathor;
and all these buildings were. enclosed within a surrounding wall.

The Mammisi, or small temple wherein the festivals of the
birth of the gods were celebrated, stood in front of the great
temple, to the left; it consisted of a small courtyard, hall of
columns, and the shrine. It was built by Ptolemy LN, who is
depicted on the walls making offerings to Sehek, lrathttThnth,
and other deities, The best relief remaining (see de Morgan,
Kom Omém, p. so) is en the north wall, and represents the king
on a fowling expedition through marshes much frequented by
water fowl.
