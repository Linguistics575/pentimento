eminent expert was pcrmitted to spend £25,611 in providing
the Damietta Barrage with gates and in general repairs. In
June 1834* he was able to hold 1111 water to a depth of
'7 feet a inches in the Resetta ltarrage, and tn a tltzpth of
3 feet in the Damietto Barrage. The cotton crop that year

which was the greatest known 171011 before 1884. ln 1885
about £13,246 wcre spent an the barrage, and the results
