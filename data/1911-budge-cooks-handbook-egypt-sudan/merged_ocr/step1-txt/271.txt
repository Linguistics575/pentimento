the Natron Valley, and acquired a number of Coptic MES.
from the Menestery crf Baramtls; in 1837 the Hon, R. Curzon
also obtained several vellum MES. at the monasteries, and in
1838 the Rev. H, Tattam purchased 49 Syriac MSS., which
he seld in the Trustees of the British Museum. The same
year the Trustees of the British Museum sent Mr. Tattam to
Egypt to obtain the MSS, which were still there, and of these
he was M) fortunate as to secure about 314. which arrived at
the British Museum in 1843. In 1845 M. A. Pacho (net the
traveller I'arhe, who committed seieide en Jnmrary stith, 1329 },
went and lived with the monks for six weeks. anti in the end
succeeded in obtaining the remainder of the MSS, about 190
m number; r72 tof these came to the British Museum in 1847,
to were sold to the Trustees in 1351, and M. Pacho kept
back and sold several to the Imperial Public Lihrertr in
St. Petersburg in 1852. All these MES. really came front the
Convent of St, Mary Dcipara { HEr eiuryhni), and the importance of the Library cannot - be cover-estimated, for it has
supplied us with some of the oldest dated hooks in existence,
has given us the Syriac Bible in several versions, the Epistles
of Ignatius, the works attributed to Clement, Patristic: literature of all kinds, and a considerable number of native Syrian
works, most of which were unknown prior to the discovery
of the Library, As we are told that the Natron Valley
held about 100 monasteries during the sixth and seventh
centuries, it is net difficult to imagine what litcrarv treasures
their Libraries must have contained. At the present time
there are he MES, of importance in the Natron Talley, and
only these who are interested in archaeology are recommended
to visit it. The reader who is interested in the history of the
discovery of the MES. should read Fete hy Monasteries ix

an article by Cureton in the Quarterly Ermine, No. CLIII,
p.51 i and the privately printed "Journal n kept by Miss Platt,
who accompanied her stepfather, the Rev. H. Tattam, on his
journey in search of MSS. in 1839.
