various parts of the Oasis prove beyond a doubt that the

called the salt Vinum, iff-ii?, and the classical writers

"natron." Acctyrding to Strahe (xvii, I, 23), this was produced
by two lakes, but other writers give the nunoher of lakes tts six,
and some enumerate eight; the old inhabitants of the Natron
Valley worshipped Serapis, anti Strahe says they were the only
people in Egypt who sacrificed the sheep. The length of the
Natron Valley is about ae miles, and near the middle of it
was the town, commonly called Scete, where the Christian
monks built a large settlement', Heete is said to have been one
and a half day's journey from Lake Marcotis, Ecclesiastical
writers distinguish carefully between the olilfercnt parts of the
Natrutt Valley, thus there was the town of Nitria, the town of
Scythia (Seem), Petra, the Cells and the Ladder (eka'tmf).
At the end of the first half of the fourth century Christian
recluses began to assemble there, and, led by Macarius the
Egyptian, they emulated the lives of Anthony the Great,
and other early ascetics. Some 5,000 monks lived there, and

It contains three churches, the Ittreest and finest being
dedicated to the Virgin. the Monastery of Baramiis

church dedicated to the Virgin. The few monks who live
in these monasteries are poor, but their ccuartesyand hospitality
