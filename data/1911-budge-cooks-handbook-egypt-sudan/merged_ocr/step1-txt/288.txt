AND ITS HISTORY. 545

1906, two Stat? () fticers left Constantinople "Alexandria,
and on their arrival in Cairn they lodged in the house of the
Ottoman Delegate Mtnkhrar pirshi, and hettl nu communication with any member of the Egyptian Crorcrnment, or with
11.11135 Agent and Ctmsul-ficneral. On March 4th they
suddenly lcft 1111 111-1111. vrlyemi they were lo proceed to
'Ahabah. Meanwhile'l'nrkish troops occupied 111111111, Al

from [ Jantrtstrus ant ] tather Syrian tuwns It: irtmtier, It
became evident that the "Chtomnn Ciovermncnt were abusing
"the patience of 1I.) L's (hwernntcut and tritlhtg with the
"question at issue." The hmmdury hetween Turkey and Egypt
at Rafah was marked by a [ rug cm each side (If whirh was a
marble pillariahout this time the pillars were pulled down and
removed in the Turkish interest, The Report of the Officers
who had gone to'Atcalrah was received UH April 21111. and was
found to Mt" tlchtar 1hishi, who 111111111 stated that
"the Peninsula of Sinai consisted only of the 11:11111111' lying
"south tal' a line drawn directly from Akalvah to Suez. and the
"boundaries between Egypt and 1urkey were lines drawn
"from Rafah 111 fiutez, and from 3111:: 111 Akahah. A com"promise was hinted at by Mr1kltar P5151151. hy whose orders
"it is not clear, ofa frontier from Riis 1fulrartturat1to Ais'Arish,"
According to 1ft1khtar Piishii's contention, the Turks would
have had the right to construct n strategic railway tn Suez,
and the effect of his compromise would have been to advance
the Turkish frontier to Nakhl, and to turn the Gulf 111' "Alsabah
into a mare tlaasum in the pt3ssessit cf'rurkey, and into a
standing menace to the security of the trade mute to the East,
On April 3crth, the British Ambassador received instructions
toinform the Ottoman Government that ten days would be
given them to comply with the British demands, failing which
the situation would become grave. A fortnight huer the
Sultan gave orders for the evacuation of Tibah by Turkish
111111115, and accepted the demands of f-LM/s Government.

Niebuhr in 1762, and he published an account of them in
