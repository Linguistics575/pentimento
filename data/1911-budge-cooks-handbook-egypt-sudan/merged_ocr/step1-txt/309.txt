THE line from Wastah tints wEstwat'ds. and its terminus is at
Madinat a1-lfuyytima, a large Egyptian town situated a little
distance from the site at Arsinoii in the Hteptmumois, called

Crocodilopolis hy the Greeks, heeattse the crocodile was here
vvvrshipped. The city was nae of great importance under
Ptolemy H, and it became virtually the Greck capital tJi Upper
Egypt, and was actually regarded as a name. The Egyptians
called the Fayyiim Ta-she gnaw? [ FT) "the rake district," and
the Ctoptic Phiom,
"the water-" The Pat'yhm district has an area of about
850 square miles, and is watered hy a hraneh of the Nile
called thu llaltVt1suf, which flows, into it through the Libyan
mountains. On the west at it lies the Birkat alMfurtm.
This new fertile, land is thought to have. Ijicen reclaimed from

The Birkat al-liurtm is Formed by a deep depression in the
desert scooped out ul' the Parisian limestone. which has become
covered in great part hy thick hulls of salted hiatus and marls.
On these Nile mud has hum: deposited. The Hirkat al-lisurtin
is all that is left of the ancient Lake Moeris, and its water
surface is about [ 50 feet helew sea hevel. Its cubic contents
are estimated at t,5ee, eee, eee of cubic metres.

According to Pliny (v, 9), Lake Moeris was 250 miles



LAKE atom M. 587

{ Maeianus says 450 miles) in circumference, and 5e paces
deep; and its functions are thus described hy fitraho (xvii, t,
tiri): "The Lake Maeris, by its magnitude and depth, is able
"to sustain the siupttahmttlwtcc et' water which flows into it at.
the time at the rise of the river, without ovet% wing the
"inhabited and cultivated parts of the country. On the
tit-sa'ease of the water of the river, it distribute the excess by
it the same canal at each ol' tho mouths; and both the lake
and the canal preserve a rcmainder, which is used for
"irrigation, These are the natural and independent properties
art the, lake, hut in addition, on linth mouths "tlu: canal are
"placed locks, by which the engineers store tll) and distribute
ie the water which enters or issues from the canal," The
1ral1r-Vrrsul' is said he settie to have been excavated under the
elireetium ef the patriarch Joscph, but there is her satisfactory
evidence for this theory: strictly speaking, it is an arm of the
Nile, which has always needed cleaning out from time to
time, and the IYisuf, or- joseph, after whom it is named, was
seine Mulramnvadan ruler "Egypt. Ih: retlettls says (ii, :49)
of Lake Mocris, "The water in this lake dues net spring
Il From the sod, for these parts are excessively dry, but it is
conveyed through lt channel from the Nils, and for six
months it'lows into the lake, and six mouths out again into
the Nile. And during the six months that it flows out it
yields a talent of silver (25240) every day to the king's
treasury from the Iish: but when the water is flowing into
it, twenty Inintt: (1:80)." That Lake Moeris was believed
tn hare heen artificially constructed is evident from the
writings of many ancient writers, and Herodotus says, "That
"it is made and dry, this circumstance proves, for about
r,' the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, each rising

"placed a stone statue, seated on a throne" The pyramids

later by Pmfes, srsr Petrie also. On the other hand, it has
been proved recently by Sir H. Brown that there never was a
Lake Mueris, and that what Herodotus saw and thought was
a lake, was merely the Nile-Mod, the "containing walls of the
lake "being only the dykes which separated the basins from
