"some fear, some five stories high. And to sum up all in a word,
"he made it not only the most beautiful and stateliest city of Egypt,
It but at all others in the world. The fame therefore of the riches
"and grandeur of this city was so noised abroad in every place,
"that the poet Homer takes notice of it:

I' l Nor Thebes as much renewe'd,
Whose courts with unexhausted wealth abound,
it i Where through a hundred gates with marble arch
LI l To battle twenty thousand Chariots march.'

II Although there are some that say it had not a hundred gates; but
18 that there were many large porches to the temples. whence the city
"was called Hecotompy/us, a hundred gates, for many gates: yet
44 that it was certain they had in it ashes Chariots of war; for there
"were a hundred stables all along the river from Memphis to
"Thebes towards Lybia, each of which was capable to hold two
"hundred horses, the marks and si es of which are visible at this
"day. And we have it related, t at not only this king, but the
"succeeding rinces from time to time, made it their business
"to beautify t is city; for that there was no city under the sun so
"adorned with as many and stately monuments of gold, silver, and
It ivory, and multitudes of colossi and obelisks, cut out of one entire
"stone. For there were there four temples built. for beauty and
"greatness to be admired, the most antient of which was in circuit
"thirteen furlongs (about one and a half miles), and five and forty
"cubits high, and had a wall twenty-four feet broad, The area"ments of this temple were suitable for its utagniMence, both for
"east and workmanship. The fabric hath centiuued to our lime,
"but the silver and the cold, and ornaments of ivory and precious
"stones were carried away by the Persians when Cambyses burnt
"the temples of Egypt. At which time they say those palaces at
"Persepolis and Snsa, and other parts of Media (famous all the
"world ever }, were built by the Persians, who brought over these
"rich spoils into Asia, and sent for workmen out of Egypt for that
"purpose. And it is reported, that the riches of Egypt were then

I, 2,3ns, which was in the 108th Olympiad. There, they say, are the
"wonderful sepulchres of the autism kings, which for state and
"grandeur far exceed all that posterity can attain unto at this day.
"The Egyptian priests say that in their sacred registers there are
"entered 47 at these sepulchres; but in the reign of Ptolemy Lagns
"there remained only 17, many of which were ruined and destroyed
"when I ttayselfcameiuto those parts, The Thebans boast that they
