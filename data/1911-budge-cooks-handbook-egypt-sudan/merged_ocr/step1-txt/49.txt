Nile 11111111 11115 ah1mdant, food was t'hcap, cattle ficrurishcd,
and the prosperity of the country was assured for thc 311111;
similarly, when the Nile Hum! was too great or 1111:: little,
grain was dcar, the cattle. languished, business was paralysed,
and want and misery filled the land. Everything in Egypt
depended on the Nile, and it is not too much to say that the
river was the cause not only of the physical characteristics of
the Egyptians, but also of their learning and civilization. As
