According to Major Sir R. H.1trnwn. R.rc. Jlistory rgf Me

Natieleen Henaliarte prvphesitrd that the day would came when
barrages would be thrown across the Rosetta and Itantietta
arms of the Kile, and that these, by means tit' setter dams,
would allow the whole of the Nile stream to flow into either
branch, and in this manner the inundation would be doubled.

Soon after Mubamnvad'Ali hemmc Viceroy of Egypt he hegan
to develop cotton gnawing. and he found that the basin system of
irrigation, which was then in operation, was unsuitable for his
purpose In 1833 he decided that it was necessary to increase
the water in the Damietta branch, and in order to et't'eet this
he proposed to dam the waters of the Resetta branch, which
supplied Alexandria and a whale province with water, and
turn them into the Damietta branch. The Viceroy abandoned
his scheme on the suggestion of Linant de Bellefonds Bey, and
agreed to his proposal he threw a barrage across the head of
