The foilowitog netiee has been issued :-
The attention of the Egyptian authorities has heen frequently
drawn, both by visitors and lay residents in the: tnuittry, to the
evils resulting from the indiscriminate hestewttl of G heI-tshish "

by tourists during the winter season. The intention of the
donors is no doubt kindly, her the practice-more especially

to lead a life of idleness for the remainder of the year. The
unhealthy tendency of such a system is obvious.

On the other hand, from the point of view of the Nile
travellers themselves, the inconveniences of this universal
mendicity are equally obvious, and, as time goes on, unmet

the practice. L

It would be extremely difficult for the Crovcrnment to devise
an effective remedy for this state of things. The real remedy
rests with the travellers themselves. If money were,
in future, only bestowed in return for some actual
service rendered, or in cases of evident and established distress, the present pernicious habit of begging would
seen die out, to the advantage both of the people and of the
rtstters.

It is with this conviction that we venture to express a hope
that her fellow-countrymen, when travelling in Egypt, will lend
their aid to this important reform by abstaining here the dis
