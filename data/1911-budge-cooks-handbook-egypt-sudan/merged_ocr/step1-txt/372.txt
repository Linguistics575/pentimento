a site in the 11eighhourhofud of Asnf whirh has proved ol'
considerahle importance from the historical standpoint, inasmuch as it has provided what is possibly the most representative
and complete series of Egyptian antiquities of the Hyksos
Period. During the course of these excavations a systematic
exploration has been made of the desert lying ten the siitith of
Asna fer a distance of sixty miles. In 1905 Professor Sayce
carried out the excavation of a XIIth dynasty cemetery at
