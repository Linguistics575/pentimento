TANIS, THE FIELD OF? IOAN. 501

Teh of the North, and ltehtttet of the NHTIIL" Tanis was
situated on the right or cast bank of the Tanitic branch
of the Nile, about 30 miles neatly due west of the ancient
Pclusium; and as it were near the northeast frontier of ngpt,
it wae always elte of the towns which turmoil the ehjeet at the
first attack ofthe so-calico Ilykstas. Syrians, Assyrians, Greeks,
Arabs, and'l'urks. The texwaviitions which have been made
in the ruins ream ] about trin h }; Mariette and Pctrie prtwt:
that Tanis must have been one of the largest and most important cities in the Helm. The earliest monuments found here
date from the time el' Pelti I, Ylth dynasty, ahettt 3233 eta;
the neat eltleet ate the black granite statues of Uscrtsun I
end Arnenetrurnt II, a sandst) nc. statute cd' UHEI'ESEH ll, an
inscribed granite fragment of Ueet'teen III, and two statues of
Scbek-lwtcp Ill. Following these come the mast interesting
black granite sphinxes, which are ttsurdly said tto he the werk
of the so-t'alleti Hyksos, but which are, in the writer's opinion,
older than the period when these people ruled ever Lower
Egypt. The cartvuches inscribed ttptttt them eniy prove that
many kings were anxious to have their names added tn these
monuments. The greatest builder at Tania was Rameses II,
who erected a temple with pylons, colossal statues, ohclisks,
and sphinxes. Paselkhijms, Shuslianq f, and Shashanq III
repaired and added to the buildings in Tania, and they
took the topportunity cg" usmrping aphinxee, eheliake, & c.,
which had been set up by earlier kings. Traces of
such usurpations are found everywhere at ihn. The
inscription upon it, which is of the time of Rameses II, is
dated in the four hundredth year of a Hyksos king, named

The last native king of Egypt whose name is mentioned
at Tania is Nectancbus H, and after him come the Ptolemies.
The stele, commonly called the Decree of Canopus. which
was set up in the ninth year of Ptolemy Ill, Euergetes I
(238 He), was found here. Here, too, was found in the
eastern portion of the ruins of the great temple, near the
shrine, the famous Stele of Four Hundred Years.
The stele was set up in honour of the god Set, by an official
called Seti, who appears to have flourished in the reign of
