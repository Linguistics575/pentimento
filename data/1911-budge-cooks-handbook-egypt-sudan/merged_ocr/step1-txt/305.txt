fortresses of Etham, Migdol, near Pelusium, the great Fiirbonian
Bag, and se into Syria,'l'he great drawback
to this theory is the estrettte 1mprohahility that the Israelites
would have ventured to march straight into the line of strong
Egyptian fortresses which bad linen built en the eastern frontier
of the Delta, and which clearly it was to their interest to avoid.
Moreover, we knew that Ethan ] anti Migdol wen; common

Taken together the known facts indicate that the Israelites
made their way into the dcscrt hy the nearest rettte pessihle,
and that mute probably lay through some part of the eettntt } I
now occupied by the modern Lake Timsah, which is relatively
close to the eastern end of the Wiuli Ttlmikit. The narrative
of the Book of Exodus calls the water which the Israelites
crossed the "Yam Suph," tie, the "sca of reeds," a name
which would never have been given to the sea in general; and
there is no doubt that they called the water by that name
