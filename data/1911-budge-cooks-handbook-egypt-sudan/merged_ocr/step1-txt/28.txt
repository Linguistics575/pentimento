Lyons in teeth; but if they he compared with those puhlished
in the ALstAXAcK issued hy the ylttrvey 1h'pnrtrruent year by
)'c'ur since that date, it will be semi that the variations are very
slight, and that for all practical Pulp0strs they are unimportant.

. Dryness of the air: Nu matter how hot the weather, the
tttrttf Egypt is always light, (rush, and invigorating, and in places
which are quite away from cultivatud lands only a minute amount
of moisture exists in it, Aitothcr important characteristic of
the Egyptian climate is its uniformity, and in this respect it
pmba) is unique. How long this will last it is hard to say,
for there. is 110 doubt that the large surface of water in the
Sucr. Canal, and the extensive irrigation works which are
increasing yearly, ten say nothing of the enormous lake which
has linen formed Ly the waters held up by the Aswan Dam,
have produced local disturbances of the atmosphere, and
contributed in some places to make the winters less dry
and the summers less hot. The evenings and the mornings
are beautifully em ], and the thermemeter does not often fall
helore 40° in Cairo, The average temperature of Lower
Egypt ranges between 73" and get" in summer, and between
45" and tie: in winter, and that of Upper Egypt between pf'

'and too' in summer, and between 60° and pr' in winter.
