646 TmtHICS-DlODORUS ON THE RARIESSEUM.

The following is the account of the Tenth of Osymandyas
given by [) iodurlls :-
IF And these things are not only reported by the Egyptian priests,
"out of their sacred records, but many of the Grecians, who
"travelled to Thebes in the time of Ptolemy Lars, and wrote
"histories of Egypt (among whom was Hecateus), agree with
"what we have related. Of the first sepulchres (wherein they say
it the women of Jupiter were buried), that of king Osymandyas was
"ten furlengs in circuit: at the entrance of which they say was
"a portico of various coloured marble, in length two hundred feet,
"and in height five-and-forty cubits: thence going forward, on
"come into a fur-square stone gallery, every square being our
"hundred feet, supported, instead of iIIars, with beasts, each of
"one entire stone, sixteen cubits hig, carved after the antique
"manner. The roof was entirely of stone; each stone eight cubits
It broad, with an satire sky, bespangled with stars. Passing out of
"this peristy1ion, you enter into another portico, much like the
"fermer. bat more curiously carved, and with more variety. At the
"entrance stand three statues, each of one entire stone, the works
Al manship of Memnon of Eienitas. One of these, made in a sitting
"posture, is the greatest in all Egypt, the measure of his foot
"exceeding seven cubits; the one standing en the right, and the
"other on the left, bein his daughter an mother, This piece is
"not only J,'l'dSar, lhor' its greatness, but admirable for its cut
"and workmanship, and the excellency of the stone. In so great
"a work there is not to be discerned the least flaw, or any other
"blemish, Upon it there is this inscription :--'I am i0srmand as,
"I king of kings; if any would know how great I am, and w ere
"' I lie, let him excel me in any of my works.'

"There was likewise at this second gate, another statue of his
"mother, by herself, of one stone, twenty cubits in height: upon
"her head were placed three crowns, to denote she was both the
"daughter, wife, and mother of a king. Near to this portico, they
It say there was another gallery or piazza, more remarkable than
"the former, in which were various sculptures, representing his
"wars with the Bactrians, who had revolted from him, against
"whom (it is said) he marched with four hundred thousand foot, and
"twenty thousand horse; which army he divided into four bodies,
"and appointed his sons generals of the whete.

"In the first wall might be seen the king assaulting a bulwark,
"environed with the river, and fighting at the head of his men,
" each against some that make up against him, assisted by a lion,
"in a terrible manner; which some affirm, is to be taken for a true
"and real lien, which the king bred up tame, which went along
It with him in all his wars. and by his great strength. ever put the
"enem to flight, Others make this construction of it, that the
"Icing heing a man of extraordinary Courage and strength, he was
"willing to trumpet forth his own praises, setting forth the bravery
"of his own spirit, by the representation of a line. In the second
"well were carved the captives dragged after the king, represented
"without hands, etc.; which was to signify that they were of
"efreminate spirits, and had us hands when they came to fight.
"The third wail represented all sorts of sculptures, and canoes

"images, in which were set forth the king's sacrificing of oxen, and
It his triumphs in that war.

"In the middle of this erishr1ion, e en to the air at the top, was
"reared an altar of shining marble, a excellent workmanship, and
"for Iargenels to be admired. In the last wall were two statues,
"each of one entire stone, seven-and-twenty cubits high: near to
"which, three passages o ened out of the peristyiien, into a stately
tt room, supported with pillars like to a theatre for music; every
"side of the theatre was two hundred feet square. In this, there
'l were many statues of wood, representing the pleaders and
"spectators, looking upon the judges that gave judgment. Of
"these, there were thirty carved upon one of the walls, In the
"middle sat the chief justice, with the image of truth lying about
"his neck, with his eyes closed, having many books lying before
"him. This signified that a judge ought not to take any bribes,
"but ought only to regard the truth and merits of the cause,"

' Thc co1ossi.-rrhesue two interesting statues were set up
in honour of Amenophis III, where they represent; they
stood in from of the pylon 0t" a calcareous stone temple which
was built by this king; this has now entirely ilisappcared,
Thcy were hewn out of a hard grit-stunt.:, end the top of each
was nisntt he feet above the ground; originally each was
monolithic, The statue (m the. north is the famous Colossus
of Memnon, from which a sound was said to issue every
morning when the Still rose. The upper part of it was thrown
down by an earthquake, it is said, about 27 1: .E.: the damage
was partially repaired during the reign of Septimius Severus,
who restored the head and shoulders of the figure by adding
to it five Layers of stone. When Strnhn wns at rI'he'ties with
Ailing Gallus he heard "a noise at the fu-st hour of the day,
li but whether proceeding from the lmse 01" from the colossus,
"nr produced on purpose by some of these standing round the
"hase, I cannot confidently assert." It is said that after the
colossus was repaired no sound issued from it. Some think
that the noise was caused by the sun's rays Striking upon the
stone, while others believe that a priest hidden in the Colossus
produced it by striking a Stone. The inscriptions show that
many distinguished Romans visited the "vocal Memnon "and
heard the sound; tine Fetreninnns, of a poetical turn of mind,
stated that it made a sighing sound in complaining to its
mother, the dawn, of the injuries inflicted upon it by Cambyses.
The inscriptions en the hack of the colossi give the names of
Amenophis III.
