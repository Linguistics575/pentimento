order of the hinge Hf the Illth dynasty, rthnut 2300'LC., and
them: show that tht: Nile Ihood rcvordeii there was ah t-cut
higher than any item ] of lip duy. Thc. dietai'tt'e hetweeti the
Second and First Cataracts ie 214 tithes, and the stream is mi
an average t,6, po Feet wide. The river in this reach is provided
with gigantic spurs, which were httiit by etie of the ancient
kings to eelleet r-ttiil en the sides in then ], and to train the
river in summer. The First Cataract is three miles long,
and in the Course of it the rircr drops between It } and 1? feet.
The ligyittiaiie at ent- period of their history, for enme
ttnaeetitittt'ahte reaeeti, lrehcwtl that tht- source of the Nile
was near Aswan, and that it. lay under two rocks, which they
t'elled { Et-Jtt'l'l; these rocks art: mentioned by llerednttte,
who calls thrm KprE-q-'u and MtI-g'u, and he say; that they
were situated hetween the Islands of Iilephantine and Pbilax
Mubammitdait writers also thouy, lti that the Nile Spring: were
at Aswan. From Aswan t0 the Barrage, whit'h lies a little
to the north of Cairn, the distance i'i about 600 miles.
Classical writers tell tlh' that in ancient days the Eile
emptied itself into lllt' Sctt by seven mouths, lo which
were given the names Pelusiac, Tanitie, 11cndcsian, Phat,
nitie,'ranitic, lteihitie, and Canopic. Forvtotett miles to
the north of Cairo the Nile buacomes two branches, which
are known as the Rosetta and Damietta arms respectively;
each of these is about 150 miles long.

It has already heeti said that a register of the height of the
Nile flood was found at Seeinah in the Second Cataract, and
that it dated from 2300 1: .C., and we must nette that a Kite
gauee existed hit the Iyi ] arid of filcpicttotiiw, toyptosiitc tn the
town of Aswan, at the foot of the Cataract, from very early
times. It seems that the readings of the gauge at
Filrcphantittc' were always used as a hasc for calculating
the general pmsperity of I'lgypt year by year. In the reign
of Severus an et'tieer of the Roman garrison there nntcd
ttti exeeptietialiy high Nile, hut the maximum flood mark
noted hy thc lttemhers of Napuleeli'e great expedition was
e'l I metres higher than the mark made by the Roman officer.
The French savants, reckoning from the middle of the reign
of Severus (say AAr. gee } te e.ti. thee, concluded that the hut ]
and banks of the Nile had risen 2'1: metres in [ ,600 years,
