330 THE GENERAL REELTRREC110N.

The time when the resurrection is to take place is known only
to tied. The first blast of the trumpet will shake heaven and
earth: the second will cause all living creatures tu the last
being the angel el death; and the third, which is lo take place
40 years after the second, will raise the dead, Mnhammad being
the first to rise. The general resurrection will include
animals. Some say the day of judgment will last 1,000 years,
and others 50,000; the place of judgment will be the earth,
and M11loammad is to be the intercessor with tired Olt hehItll
Lil mart. A hunk wherein is written nn account of his actions
will he given to each man, and all things will he weighed
in a hIIlIIIIee, the souls of the good
will tum to a road on the right, and them; of the bad to a
road on the left. All will, however, have to pass over the
bridge As-Sinn, which is laid IIIIer the midst of hell, and is finer
than a hair, and sharper than the edge of a sword; the good will
have no difficulty in passing over this, but the wicked will fall
from it and meet their doom in Guhcnna, which is divided into
seven storey, one helew the other. Between hell and paradise
is a partition or gulf, which is not, however, 50 wide that the
blessed and the damned t" at1tttyt discourse tegetlter.

The Llessed will drink out of a lake, the water of whiCh
comes from Paradise, and is whiter than milk, and sweeter in
smell than musk, Paradise was created before the wtorld, and
is situated above the seven heavens, near the throne of God;
ts earth is made of fine wheat fltour, or musk, or saffron I its
stones are pearls: its walls: in: inlaid with gnltl and silver; and
the trunks of all its trees are of gold. Therein is the TMah
tree, laden with every kind of fruit, and it will supply the true.
believer with everything he needs, rich, meat, drink, raiment,
horses to ride, ete. The rivers flow with milk, wine, and
honey, and the fountains are innumerable. The women of
Paradise, the lifts al-'uyi'm (EL, women with large eyes, the
pupils of which are very dark, or black, and the whites of
which are very white and clear), who will he given to the
believers, are made of pure musk, and are free from all the
defects of earthly women I they live in hollow pearls, which are
60 miles long, and 60 miles wide. The beings in Paradise
will never grew old, and they will always remain in the prime
and vigour of a man 30 years ofagc; when they enter Paradise
they will be of the same stature Its Adam, tie, 60 cubits, or
I 10 feet high. Women who have lived geetl lives upon earth
