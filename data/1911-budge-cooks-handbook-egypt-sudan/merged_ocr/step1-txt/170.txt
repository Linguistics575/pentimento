Next to smoking the Egyptians chicf enjoyment is the
Bath, which is of the kind commonly called "Turkish "; the
word for hath is "ltammiinh": iienie baths admit male Arab
customers only, Others wumen and children only, and others
both men and Women, the former in the morning and the latter
in the afternoon. When the hath is appropriated tn wettten
a piece of linen or drapery is hung ot'er the entrance to warn
men not to enter. The old baths of the city are httilt of brick,
have domes in the roof, and tire paved with earthenware and
marble tiles. The.? rfubarnrrriulan believes that baths and lava.
teries arc haunted by spirits of tt more or less evil and malicious
nature, and when he enters; them often does St) with his left

of a hath in tight as elsewhere depend upon the class nf
enwtnniere who visit it. The nhler baths are net FA) etean ns

The real view taken hy the Egyptians about music, singing, and dancing is not easy to find Out, but 110 people are
more pleas-cd than they with these amusements. Music was
forbidden by Muhammad himself, for he thought that it
excited men's passions and predisposed them to vice, and even
in the Arabian Nights (No. 899) we read of the damsel who
dressed herself in black, built a tenth, and repented that she
had sung to the lute, As a matter of fact the Egyptians sing
whenever they have a chance, and the boatmen and artisans,

The system of music which was in use: tmmig the ancient
Arabs is not understood by the modem Egyptians, who appear

Many of the popular sungs sung in Egypt at the Iamsunt time
