is reaehed by passing the temple at hittrnrth; it is situated
ahnut three nr i'nnr miles item the riser. This yalley
enntains the tnmhs ni kings hi the Ii't'illth, Eli'ith, and

the grnup as a whnle it is easy tn see that all are huilt
praetieally nn nne and the same plan; the mndilieatinns
whieh neeur in the details nf eaeh are due partly in strnetural
ditfieulties and partly tn the diiTerenee in the lengths ni' time
whieh were deynterl tn the making nf them. If the king
hegan tn huild his tnmh early in life, and had a inng and
sueeessful reign, his tnmh wnuld he large, and enntain many
ehambers, and he elahnrately deenrated with seenes and tests

rnnms diminished. It may well he assumed that these tnmhs
were huilt hy t'nreed lahnur. Cine nf the enmmnnest religinus
views nf the Egyptians was that the Tent, nr Underwnrid,
was a lnng, narrnw t-'alley whieh ran parallel with Egypt, and
was neither ahnye nnr helnw the level ni this earth. It had
a river flnwing thrnugh the whnle length nf it. This valley

terminated at the plane where the sun rnse. It was divided
