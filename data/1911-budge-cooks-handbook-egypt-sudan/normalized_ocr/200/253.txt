"with figures carved on it; on this road these IO years were
"ex ended, and in forming the subterraneous apartments on the
ii hil, on which the pyramids stand, which he had made as a burial
if vault for himself, in an island, formed by draining a canal from the
rl Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting the pyramid itself:
ht of this, which is Square. each face is 8 plethra (820 feet), and the
1. height is the same; it is composed of polished stones, and jointed
"with the greatest exactness; none of the stones are less than
li 30 feet. This pyramid was built thus; in the form of steps, whieh
lk some call Crosse, others bomides. When they had first built it in
"this manner. they raised the remaining stones by machines made
"of short pieces of wood: having lifted them from theground to
"the first range of steps, when the stone arrived there. it was put
t, on another machine that stood ready on the first range. and front
it this it was drawn to the second range on another machine, for the
"machines were equal in number to the ranges of steps, or theg
ii removed the machine, which was only one, and portable. to eac

"range in succession, whenever they wished to raise the stone
"higher, for 1 should relate it in both ways, as it is related. The
l, highest parts of it, therefore, were first finished, and afterwards
"they completed the parts next following, but last of all they
"finished the parts on the ground and that were lowest.

"On the pyramid is shown an inscription. in Egyptian characters,
"how much was ex ended in radishes, onions, and garlic for the
It workmen, whicht e interpreter, as I well remember, reading the
I, inscription, told me amounted to 1.600 talents of silver. And if
"this be really the case, how much more was probably expended
"in iron tools, in bread, and in clothes for the labourers, since they
"occupied in building the works the time which I mentioned, and
"no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and drawing the
"stones, and in forming the suhtetraneous excavation, [ It is
II related ] that Cheops reached such a degree of infamy, that being
El in want of money, he prostituted his own daughter m a. brothel,
"and ordered her to extort, they did not say how much; but she
IT exacted a certain sum of money, privately, as much as her father
"ordered her; and contrived to leave a monument of herself, and
4s asked everyone that came in to her to give her a stone towards
It the edifice she designed: of these stones they said the pyramid
"was built that stands in the middle of the three, before the great
"pyramid, each side of which is a plethron and a half in length."

The history of the. building ol' the pyramid is thus stated
try llt-rtuintus { ihauk ii, I27)' ,---

"The Egyptians say that this Cheops reigned So years; and
"when he died his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom;
"and he followed the same practices as the other, both in other
"respects and in building a pyramid; which does not come up to
'l the dimensions of his brother's, for I myself measured them; nor
"has it subterraneous chambers; nor does a channel from the Nile
"tlow to it, as to the other; but this fhuxrs through an artificial
FI aqueduct round an island within, in which they say the body of
"Cheops is laid. Having laid the first course of variegated
.. Ethiopian stones, less in height than the other by .10 feet, he built
"it ttear the large pyramid. They both stand on the same hill,
Peut is about 100 feet high, Chephren. they_ said, feigned
'56 years. Thus 106 years are reckoned, during which the
tr Egyptians suffered all kinds of calamities, and for this length of
I. time the temples were classed and never opened. From the hatred
'/ they hear them, the Egyptiane are not very willing to mention
"theirnaaaes', but call the pyramids after Philition, a shepherd, who
It at that time kept his cattle in those parts" [ Cttry's 1runhlurion.)
