Rameses II. Instead of being dated in the dayand month
and year of Rameses II in which it was set up, it is dated in
the 400th year of the Hyksos king Nubti, a very remark-
able fact. After Mariette had read am) copied the text he
rehttried the steie in the place where he had intuit ] it.

Under the Roman Empire'l'anis still held Ct high position
among the towns of the Helm, and the ligylntiztns considered
it of sufficient importance [ 0 make it an episcopal see. In the
list of the bishops who were present at the Council of Chalccdon
(am, 451), the name of Apollonius, Bishop ofTanis, is found.
Tanis must not be confounded with'I'ennis, the seaport town
which grew and increased in impoortarwte as Ianis declined;
and it is difficult to understand why Tanis should have
dwindled away, considering that Aral) writers have described
its climate as being most salr+rious, and its winter like summer.
Water was said to Row there at all times, and the inhabitants
could water their gardens at their will; no place in all Egypt,
save the Fayyitrn, t'hult'i he compared with it for fertility, and
for the beauty of its gardens and vines. After the sixth century
of our era the sea invaded a large portion of the territory around
Tanis, and it went On encroaching each year little by little, until
all its villages were suhmerged. The inhabitants removed their
dead to'renrois, and established themselves there; Tennis
was evacuated by its inhabitants LI). l :92, and the town itself
was destroyed A.D. 1220.

' About half-way between Sin and AyEiiilal.tiyah is Tell-
Nabéshah, which marks the site of a fortified frontier town
under Ratttesest Ii, and no doubt formed one of the chain of
fortresses which he built across the north.east border of the
Delta. The town existed in the XXVlth dynasty, for some of
the kings of that dynasty repaired the temple of the local
goddess.'l'here is nothing of interest at T'clrNabclshah.

5. Near Sinhalttiwén. which is on the main line between
Zakr1zil; and Mamfirah, is the mound which the Arabs call
Tamai al, -Amdid, and which marks the site of the classical
Thmuis. Close by is another mound, to which ancient Arab
writers gave the name of Al-Mandid; this marks the site
of Mendes. In, or a little before, the Ptolemaic Period
Thmuis and Memles were incorporated, probably because the
inhabitants of both places worshipped the ram. 1n the fourth
century of our era Thmuis was a flonrishing town, and
possessed its own magistrates, and was exempt from the
jurisdiction of the Governor of Alexandria. It was aiso an

episcopal see, and Serapion, one of its bishops, is mentioned
by Herakleanus. The importance of'l'hmuis-Mendes is
proved by the fact that Amasis 11 dedicated to the Rarniyod
a shrine, which was 23 feet high, and Ptolemy II restored the
sanctuary, and took part in the ancient ceremonies which were
pert-or-med in that city :11 the installation of Lt new Ram. The
statues of Ptolemy H and his wife Arsinoti were placed near
the Ram in the procession, and were carried through the
streets followed ly the chief men of the city, and by crowds
of rejoicing citizens. A few Egyptian monuments are still to
be seen at this place. The name'l'amai al-Amdid represents
the two names Thmuis and Mcndec'l'amai = Thmuis, and
Amdid is a corruption of Mendes, which is the Greek form of

the Egyptian name Ba-neh-tet, liis :27, (i) _ There are a

great many mounds in this district which conceal remains of
ancient Egyptian buildings, and there is no douht that under
the XIXth dynasty the whole region was full of small towns,
many of which were strongly huilt and fortified, so that they
might resist the attacks of the nomad tribes from the Eastern
Desert and Syria. It seems, however, that they had to be
built on mounds artificially constructed, the object heing to
keep them above the waters of the inundation. The saturated
soil and the storms of war and conquest do away with any hope
that many fragile objects or papyri will be found among the
nuns.

6. Close to the railway which joins Zal.ikzili and Abe
Hammid, and a little to the south of it, is Fatt. al-Ijlannah,
which was explored by Professor Neville in 1884; it marks the
site of a large, ancient ligyptian town, in which Rameses II
built a fine temple, for a colossal statue of this king in black
granite was found in a cornfield near the village. Some 40 or
So years ago the felltthut discovered a rectangular, monolithic
shrine, measuring 7 feet by 6 feet 9 inches by 6 feet, covered
inside and out with beautifully executed inscriptions and scenes.
The local Pasha, who thought that gold was hidden inside it,
promptly had it broken in pieces, two of which were carried to
his farm, and the remainder were used for building the bridges
of Fait and Tahra Hamad I The shrine was dedicated to the
Ram-god and the Hawk-god of the East by Nectanehus II,
the last native king of Egypt, about 360 BAC, A restoration of
the sanctuary of these gods was made by Ptolemy ll, probably
about me years later.
