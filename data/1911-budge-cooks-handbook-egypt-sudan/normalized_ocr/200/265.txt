The ruins "Tell al-Yahiidiyah lie near the modern
town of iihihin al-fiancirir, alcu1t 20 miles from Cairo. At this
place Rameses Ill built a small palarc which contained a
chamber lined with beautifully glazed tiles ornamented with
floral designs, humus of hints. animals, representatives of foreign
conquered tr1i1t.~sJ etc. lo the reign of Ptolemy V II, a young
Jew called (htias, the son of the high priest of the same name
iwho had been put to deathby Antiochus, petitioned the king
to allow him to huiitl a temple wherein the jews could worship
God according to their own custmns. Ptolemy's answer is
said to have run thus r-" King Ptolemy and Queen Cleopatra
"to Onins send greeting. We have heardthopetition, ivherein
"thou desirest leave to be given to thee to purge that temple
$ i which is fallen down at Lenntopolis, in the Names of Helio-
"polis, and which is named from the country Buhastis; 0n
"which account we cannot but wonder that it should be
" pleasing to God to have a temple erected in a place so
"unclean, and so full of sacred animals. But since thou
"sayest that Isaiah the prophet foretold this long ago (see
"chapter xix, 19), we give thee leave to do it, if it may be
"done according to thy law, and so that we may not appear
"to have at all offended God therein." Onias then built a
tower 60 feet high, with a httrnt brick girdle wall, and with
gates of stone: the altar was like that at Jerusalem, and over
it hung, by a gold chain, a lamp which was beaten out of a
piece of gold. The place wlts called "Onion" by the Jews,
and "Seeme Veteranorum "by the Romans, and it appears to
have been built on the site of the temple of R51, which lay to
the north of Heliopolis, It was looted by Lupus, Governor of
Alexandria in the reign of Vespasian, and was destroyed by
his successor Paulinus, 343 years after it had been founded.
