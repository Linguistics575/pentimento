higher than any ilotnd of 1oduy.'J'ht- distanve hctwcen the
Second and First Cataracts is. 214 tithes, and the stream is Im
an average t,630 I'trt't wide. The river in this reach is provided
with gigantic spurs, which were huiit by 011C of the ancient
kings ti) CUHCL'I soil on the sides in Hunt ], and to train the
river in summer. The First Cataract is thrcarr miles long,
and in the Course of it the. rircr drops between It": and 17 feet.
The Eg: yptiavs' at (.mt- period of their history, for 5mm:
unaccountable reasuu, lrehcwtl that tht- source of the Nile
was near Aswan, and that it. lay under two rocks, which the.) -
valled Qt-jtt't'l; these rocks art: mentioned by llerodntus,
who calls thrm KprE-q-'u and MtI-g'u, and hc. says that they
were situated hetwmn thc Islands of lilepirmotinc and Pbilax
Mubammitdait writers also thouy, lti that the Nile Spring: were
at Aswan. From Aswan t0 the Barrage, whit'h lies a little
t0 the north of Cairo, the distance i'i about 600 miles.
Classical writers tell tlh' that in ancient days the Nile
emptied itself into lllt' Sctt by seven mouths, lo which
were given the names Pelttsiac,'ranitic, 11cndcsian, Phat.
nitic, Schematic, Jluthitic, and Canopic. Forvtotett miles to
the north of Cairo the Nile heeomes two branches, which
are known as the Rosetta and Damietta arms respectively;
each of these is about 150 miles long.

It has already hectt said that a register of the height of the
Nile flood was found at Semnah in the Second Cataract, and
that it dated from 2300 1: .C., and we must nette that a Nile
gaugc existed on the Ie/and ot" IiltsTlcrliuw, opposite to tht:
town of Aswan, at the foot of the Cataract, from very early
times. It seems that thc readings of tlw gauge at
lilespharitinc" Were always used as a hasc for calculating,
the general pmsperity of I'lgypt year by year. In the reign
of Severus an otlird: r of the Roman garrison there nttlutI
atl exceptionally high Nile, hut the maximum flood mark
noted hy thc lttemhers of Napuleon's great expedition was
2'I I metres higher than the mark made by the Roman officer.
The French savants, reckoning from the middle of the reign
of Severus (say AHI. 200) ttt A.H. 1800, concluded that the hut ]
and banks of the Nile had risen 2'1: metres in [ ,600 years,
