In ancient days there was a harhnttr hertz and it was at this

tihjeets, and was made into amulets.'rhuse mines were
ahttntlnnetl at the end of the XIIth dynasty, probably heeattse
the Egyprian { hivemment could not work them at a profit.
The Egyptian inscriptions have been much injured by the
timhs, who blast away the Stone in search of turquoises. The
mines are well worth a visit, especially Fur those who wish
to examine r/d Itigyptian mining methods, the ruef pillars,
tunnelling, etc. Professor Palmer found UH the various fissures
and cuttings in the rock chisel marks, which indicate the vast
amount of labour expended on them. The inscriptions are on
the rm'ks ml the western side of the valley, oppnsite the site of
the old Fort and the: ruins of Major Mardonald'r, house, This
gentleman was an English officer who lived here for some
years, and reopened the mines, and employed the Arabs to
work, commercially his venture was a failure, and he subse-
quently died in ligypt a ruined man.

Passing out tif Widi Magluirah, and journeying south through
Wtidi Sitir, the interesting Wiidi Mukattab, "Valley of
Writings," is reached. Here are the. famous Sinaitit: inscrip-
tions and rude drawings, which many, on the authority of
Commas Indicopleusitcs, have det'laretl to be the work of' the
Children nf Israel. It is now known that these were the work
of the Nahataeans, who were masters of' Sinai during the early
centuries of the Christian era: the. Arabic, Greek, and Coptic
gragiti belong to a still later date. Many of the symbols are
Pagan and many Christian. The Wtidi Fieiin is next entered,
with its wild and striking scenery; in this valley, not far from
the Oasis, is the rock called bJNri al-Khattitttm which
Arab tradition says is the rock which Moses struck when he
made water to flow forth. It is iurrounded by small heaps of
pebbles, and tradition declares that these were thrown there by
the Israelites after they had drunk their fill, in order to amuse
