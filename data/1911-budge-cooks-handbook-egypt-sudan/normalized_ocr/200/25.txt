The Traveller in Egypt .--'l'ht: traveller who visits Egypt

it is probable that hc will not admin: the natives with whom he
will CUIUt' in contact until he knows them fairly well. The
Egyptians in general, until iluitcs recently, have, like other
Mulyamn1adans, never lieen accustomed to travel, and they
look upon those who wander from country to country-as bmogs
who are possessed of restless though harmlcss devils. Lilie
their more fanatical co-rtlgionists and kinsmen in Mesopotmnm,
Ihcy helieve that the ancient Egyptians were itiolaters and very
wicked people, and that God destroycd them, and blotted out
their kingdoms and buried tlwirpalaccs and temples, because
of their ihiquity. That anyone should wish to makc'excavit-
tions for the love of learning or the advancement of seienee is
more than they can understand, and the older generation

himself to making money out of him. The Egyptian knows
that fllt' possession of money will enable him to keep wives, to

loses no opportunity of getting money from the stranger. whom
hc believes to possess an inexhaustible supply of gold and
silver. Speaking generally. the traveller has very little oppor-
tunity of swing the hotter class of Egyptians, and he must by
111.: means judge the nation by those who minister to his wants
in the great cities, The Egyptian, the worst side of whom:
character has not been developed hy cupidity, is'd very
estimable individual. He is proud of his religion, but is
tolerant to a renmrkahlc degree: it must never be forgotten
that the strictest Mubanmvadans [ lespise the Christian faith in
their hearts, although Christians are everywhere treated with
civility, As the result of their religion, the Egyptians are
benevolent and charitable to the poor, and they are extremely
hospitablc; they are Cheerful, affable, easily amused, and many
are temperate and frugal. Thcy love their homes and their
native villages, and when they are compelled by the exigencies
of military service to leave them, large numbers of young men
regularly transmit money to their parents and relatives to keep
them from want. lt has heen wisely remarked by Lane that
the Egyptian has 110 gratitude in his composition, and the
traveller will discover for himself that even after he has paid
a man lavishly for trivial services he will be met with the
demand for bakshish. Partly through climatic influences,
partly through constitution, and partly through his intense
fatalism, the Egyptian in all classes is lazy, and he will never
do more than he is absolutely compelled to do. Truthfulness
is very rare in modern Egypt, but this is in many cases only
the natural result of loose and inaccurate thinking. The views
of the Egyptian about his womankind are not of an exalted
character, but he has only himself to thank for this so long as
he adheres to the abominable system of divorce which is
common throughout the country. In judging the Egyptian
the traveller must make allowance for the centuries of oppres-
