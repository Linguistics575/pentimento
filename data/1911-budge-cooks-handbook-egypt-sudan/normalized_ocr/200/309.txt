THE line from Wastah rims; westwitrds, and its terminus is at
Madinat al-Fayyflm, a large F/gy, pian town. situated a little
distance from the site of Arsinoé in the Hteptanomis, called

Crocodilopolis hy the Greeks, hccatlrie the crocodile was here
wurshipped. The city was um.- of great importance under
Ptolemy fl, and it became virtually the Greek capital of Utipur
Egypt, and WCP', actually regarded 51-5 a name. The Egyptians
called the JVvyi'ltn'l'a-she gm Fil "the rake district," and
the name Fayytlnt is the Aruhic form of Ilu: Cuptic Phiom,
"thc water." The Fayyio district has an area of about
850 square miles, and is watered lay ct hmnch of the Nile
called thu llaltVt1suf, which flows, into it through the Libyan
mountains. On the west of it lies the Birkat alMfurtm.
This now fertile. land is thought to have. Ijicen reclaimed from
the desert hy Amcnemlr0t III, a king of' the XIIth dynasty.
The Birkat al-liurtm is Formed by tt rleep (lypressicm in the
desert scooped out ul' the Parisian limestone. which has become
covered in great Iran ly thick hulls of salted loums and marls.
On these Nile mud has hum: deposited. Thc, Hirkut al-lit1rtin
is all that is left of the ancient Lake Moeris, and its water
surface is about :30 feet huluw sea Icvel. Its cubic contents
are estimated at r,50o, ooo, oor5 of cubic metres.

According to Pliny (v, 9), Lake Moeris was 250 miles



LAKE atom M. 587

{ Munianus says 450 miles) in circumference, and Cid) paces
deep; and its functions arc thus described h)' Straho (xvii, l,
tiri): me' The fake Mneris, by its magnitude and depth, is able
"to sustain the'ituperalornulaiu: c of water which flows into it at
Ek the time of thc. rise of the river, without ovet% wing the
"inhabited and cultivated parts of the country. On the
lk decreme of the water of the river, it distribute the excess by
it the same canal at each ol' tho mouths; and both the lake
"and the canal preserve a tcmainder, which is used for
"irrigation, These nre tht: natural and independent properties
tr of the lake, hut in addition, on linth mouths "tlu: canal are
sf placed locks, by which the engineers store L11.) and distribute
ie the water which enters or issues From the canal," The
1ral1r-Vrrsul' is said by 24mm: to have been excavated under the
directiun of the patriarch jtiscph, but there is no satisfactory
evidence for this theory: strictly speaking, it is an arm of the
Nile, which has always needed cleaning out from time to
time, and the IYisuf, or- joseph, after whom it is named, was
some Muirammadan ruh-r of Egypt. Hc.rrtrdiotus says (ii, :49)
of Lake Mocris, "The water in this iake does not spring
Il From the sod, for these parts are excessively dry, but it is
conveyed through lt channel from the Nils, and for six
months it'lows into the lake, and six mouths out again into
the Nile. And during the six months that it flows out it
yields a talent of silver (25240) every day to the king's
treasury l'rmit the Iish: but when the water is flowing into
it, twenty Inintt: (1:80)." That Lake Moeris was believed
tn hove litrcn artificially constructed is evident from the
writings of many ancient writers, and Herodotus says, "That
Ti it is made and dry, this circumstance proves, for about
r,' the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, each rising
"50 orgytt: alwove the surface of the water, and the part built
4r undur water extends to an equal depth; on each of these is
"placed a stone statue, seated on a throne," The pyramids
here referred to can bc nu other than the pedestals of two
large sandstone statues of Amen-em-Sit III, which were set
up either close by ctr in Lake Mueris: remains of' these tere
found "Biyamil, with 3,312 inhabitants, by Dr. Lepsius, and
later h }; Prrdessor Pettic also. On the other hand, it has
been proved recently by Sir H. Brown that there never was a
Lake Mueris, and that what Herodotus saw and thought was
a lake, was merely the Nile-Mod, the "containing walls of the
lake I? being only the dykes which separated the basins from
