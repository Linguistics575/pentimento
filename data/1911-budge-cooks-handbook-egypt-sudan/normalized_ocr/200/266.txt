in the Ingptian Museum and in the b'ritish Museum. A

TANIS, THE FIELD OF? IOAN. 501

Teh of the North, and Behtltet of the Nurlh." Tanis was
situated on the right or cast bank of the Tanitic branch
of the Nile, about 30 miles nearly titre west of the ancient
Pclusium; and :15 it was near the northeast frontier of ngpt,
it was ulways Oitr: of the towns which turmoil the ohject of the
first attack ofthe so-calico Ilykstas. Syrians, Assyrians, Greeks,
Arabs, and'l'urks. The texwaviitions which have been made
in the vuins round about.'fnt'tn by Mariette and Pctrie prtwt:
that Tanis must have been one of the largest and most impor-
tant cities in the Delta.'I'he earliest monuments found here
date from the time OI' Pepi I, Ylth dynasty, uhuttt 3233 ll.C.,'
the next ohimt ate the black granite statues of Uscrtsun I
and Amenenurru ll, a sandstone statue of Usertsen II, an
inscribed granite fragment of Unet'tKen HI, and two statues of
Scbek-lwtcp Ill. Following these come the mast interesting
black granite sphinxes, which arc ttsurtlly said tn be the work
of the so-t'alleti Hyksos, but which are, in the writer's opinion,
older than the period when these people ruled over Lower
Egypt. The cartvuche, insrri? itl upon them eniy prove that
many kings were anxious to have their names added tn these
monuments. The greatest builder at'l'ttnis was Rallieses II,
who erected a temple with pylons, colossal statues, ohclisks,
and sphinxes. Paselkhijms, Shuslianq f, and Shashanq III
repaired and added to the buildings in Tunis, and they
took the'opportunity of ussttrpingr sphinxes, obeiisks, & c.,
which had been set up by earlier kings. Traces of
such usurpations are found everywhere at ihn. The
inscription upon it, which is of' the time of Rameses II, is
dated in the four hundredth year of a Hyksos king, named

The last native king of Egypt whose name is mentioned
at Tanis is Nectancbus ll, and after him come the Ptolemies.
The stele, commonly called the Decree of Canopus. which
was set up in the ninth year of Ptolemy Ill, Euergetes I
(238 1111.), was found here. Here, too, was found in the
eastern portion of the ruins of the great temple, near the
shrine, the famous Stele of Four Hundred Years.
The stele was set up in honour of the god Set, by an official
called Seti, who appears to have flourished in the reign of
