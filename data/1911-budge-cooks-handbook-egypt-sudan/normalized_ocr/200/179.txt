2. Almsgiving.-Alms are of two kinds, ohhgatory and
voluntary, and they are regarded as of great assistance in
Causing, God to hear prayer: it has hum said hy one of the

smells perfumes, or bathes, m' swallows his spitttc, or kisses or
touches a woman, or smokes; at and after sunset they cat and
drink as they please.

4. The Pilgrimage to Meceaa--f > ery Muhammadan
