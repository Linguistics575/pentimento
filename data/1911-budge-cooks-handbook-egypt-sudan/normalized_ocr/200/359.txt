l0. The Tombs of the Kings. called in Arabic. Clildn
al-Multrk, are hewn out of the living rock in n valley, which
is reached by passing the temple at iitirnah; it is situated
about three or four miles from the river. This valley
contains the tombs of kings of the XVlllth, XlXth, and
XXth dvnasties, and is generally known as the Eastern Valley',
a smaller valley, the Weatern, contains the tenths of some of
the kings of the X\-'Illthr_lytiasly. Thcsc lnmhr: consist oflong
inclined planes with a ntlmher of t'hamht-rs or halls receding
into the mountain, sometimes to it clistnm'e of 300 feet. Straho
gives the number of those royal tomhs as 4o, "of which were

The Tombs of the Kings form a very important and Interesting
class of monuments, the like ofwhirgh exists nowhere else in
Egypt. They were all made between r300 ILC. and 1050 ML,
that is to say, they were hewn and Imilt during the most
flourishing period of l-Zgyptiun history, and at "time. when
tribute flowed into the country from Syria, Palestine, Lihya,
Nubia, and a part of the Northern Sftditti. Whcn we consider
the group as a whole it is easy to see that all are built
practically on one and the same plan; the mvdifications
which occur in the details of each are due partly to structural
difficulties and partly to the difference in the lengths of time
which were devoted to the making of them. If the king
began to build his tomb early in life, and had a long and
successful reign, his tomb would be large, and contain many
chambers, and be elaborately decorated with scenes and texts
from the religious works which were most esteemed at the
time; if his reign were Short and supplies were nut forthcoming
to provide the food of the workmen and others employed on
the work, the corridors had to be shortened, and the number of
rooms diminished. It may well be assumed that these tombs
were built by forced labour. One of the commonest religious
views of the Egyptians was that the Tuat, or Underworld,
was a long, narrow valley which ran parallel with Egypt, and
was neither above nor below the level of this earth. It had
a river flowing through the whole length of it. This valley
began on the west bank of the Nile, ran due north, bent
round towards the east when the Delta was approached, and
terminated at the place where the sun rose. It was divided

into to sections, and at each end was a sort of vestibule or
chamber. The: tnte-chamher at its beginning, was called
Amentet, and was a place of gloom; as the passenger
through this valley went onwards each of the first iivv,
sections grew darker and darker, until at the end of the flfth
sectitm the darkness was absolute. As the passenger moved
on through the last five sections the darkness grew less and
less dense, until at the end of the tenth section he entered
the chamber, the gloom of which resembled that of the
chamber at the beginning of the valley. The whole night,
which was supposed to consist of 12 hours, was toccupied in
passing through the Trmt, and the two chambers and the to
main divisions of it were traversed each in one hour. The
't'uat was n ditiieltlt place to pass through, for portions of it
were filled with hideous monsters and horrible reptiles, and a
lake of boiling and stinking water. Religious tradition declared
that the Sun-god Jlit had made his way in it seated in his boat,
but that he was only enabled to do so by employing his words
of magical power, and by the exercise of the functions of deity:
The priests declared that they possessed the knowledge of
such words of power, and people believed that if they learned
them, and learned to recognize the various divisions of the
Tuat and the beings in them by means of the pictures which
the priests provided, they could make the journey through the
Tuat in safety, arid would rise in the next world with the sun.
The priests of Amen, who promulgated this view, which was
based upon an older system of indigenous belief, presided overthe
building of the royal tombs in the XVIIIth dynasty, and made
each tomb to resemble the long, narrow valley of the'l'uat by
providing it with long corridors. When the body was deposited
in the tomb the priests repeated the words of power which R5.
was believed to have uttered, and performed ceremonies in
imitation of those of the acts of the god; in fact, made very full
use of sympathetic magic, and the worshippers of Amen believed
that their kings would surely and certainly pass safely through
the dark valley, and would overcome all their foes, and would
rise together with the sun to a new life in the next world. Now,
the Sun-god traversed this valley each night in his boat, and, of
course, rose each day; the aim, then, of every one of his wor-
shippers was to secure a passage in his boat, for if only this
could be obtained resurrection was certain. The doctrine of
the sun-worshippers and the priests of Amen taught that the
souls of all who died during the day made their way to Amentet,
