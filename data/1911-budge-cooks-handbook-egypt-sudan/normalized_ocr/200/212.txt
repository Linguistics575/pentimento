is 26 feet. () n the west mole is a lighthouse nearly 130 fest

who was born in 1305 and died in 185", and who is tamous as
the builder of the Suez Canal. 1n Port Sa'id there is little
to he seen which is not connected with shipping and the Canal,
hut the coaling, operations which are hen.- mrrietl Utlt tin a very
large scale, htiwever unpleasant to the traveller, are always a
source of interest. Loaded barges are hi'ought alongside the

gangways are run up, and scores of men, each bearing a basket
of coal, immediately begin their work amid shouts and cries
and singing. The largest steamer, which may require several
hundreds of tons of coal, can he supplied in about two hours,
and when the work is carried on at night, the huge. fires which
illumine the hinges produce, "peculiarly weird effect. The
steam tramway on the west hank of the Canal, which comwctcd
Port Sa'itl with Isma'iliyah, has [ men tviwetted into a railway,

hours instead of seven us formerly.

The Suez Canal CImpany are carrying utt extensive works
at Purt Sa'itl, and in about five ycars' time the harbour will
have heen increased to more than twice its present site. On
the eastern side a large basin is being tlredgetl fer the use of
colliers and [) L-tmletun ships, and thc Sheri? basin 0n the
western side is heing dnuhiet'l in size and deepened to 30 feet.
It is proposed to renew the oid eastern brcakwater and to
continue it towards the western breakwater.

The Suez Canal.-A glance at the. map of Africa will
show that this vast country is attached to Asia by means of
a relatively very narrow strip { at land, iv, the Isthmus of Suez,
and a closer examination reveals the fact that this strip of land,
though consisting chiefly of swamp and sand, has for thousands
of years been a serious Obstacle to communication by ship
between Europe and the East. At the south end of the:
Isthmus is the Gulf of Suez, and at the. north of it rolls the
Mediterranean, It is possible that in remote ages the sea
Mwed entirely over the place where the Isthmus now is, but
some authorities hesitate to assert this, because the marine

its width varied between 100 and 200 feet. Cleopatra, after

failed, owing to the lewness of the Nile at that seamn.
