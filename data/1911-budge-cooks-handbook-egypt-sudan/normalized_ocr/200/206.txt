Those who are interested in the modern history of Egypt may
visit the village of Abuk.ir, near which the Battle of the Nile
was fought on August 351, 1:98. Horatio Nelson engaged the
French Admiral llrttcys and captured nine of the enemy's line-
oMrattle ships and humui two. The Vrench ship "L'Orient"
blew up with lirueys and 1,000 on board, and only about 80
escaped. At this place on July 25th, 1799, Napoleon with
5,000 soldiers defeated the Turkish army of 25,900 men; on
March 8th, 1801, Sir Ralph Abercromby defeated the French
here, and Abukir fell into the hands of the British. About
3 miles from Abuliir are the ruins of the city of Canobus,
