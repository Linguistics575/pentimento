12 years of age he knew the 1.iurlin by heart, and when
22 years old he scttled down in the island of Abba in the
White Nils, and meditated there for 1,5' years. He lived in a

surrendered to him, and on January 15111, 188.1, the valuable
province of lJarthr became & part of the rehel's kingdom.

ln Iiei'trtmry General Gordon arrived in Khartim on his
fatal mission, having on his; way thither, unfortunately; told the
Mudir "lierher and the Iilmir of Matammah that he was
going to remove the Egyptian garrisons: this became noised
abroad, and many pttople, whet1 they learned that the Egyptian
(lovermnent was going to abandon the Sfd1n, joined the
Mahdi. Thus fate played into the Mahdi's hands. The next
city to fall was Berher, (iordon's troops having been defeated
on March 1 (1th. On October 2311'! the Mahdi arrived in
Omdurtsin, being well aware of (rordoNs desperate condition
through the correspondence which had been captured in the

before sunrise 0n the Monday (lcneral Gordon was murdered:
and in a Few days 50,000 Dervishes looted the town and
destroyed 10,000 men, women, and children. As aproof of
the admiration for General Gordon felt by even his bitterest
foes, it is sufficient to quote a common saying in the Stidin,

man." After the capture of 1'ihart.tlm no one doubted the divine
missionofthe Mahdi, and his word and power becameabsolute.
He now gave himself up to a life of case and luxury. He who
had professed himself satisiied with trrte coarse garment, and
had lived in a hole in the ground, and slept upon a straw mat,
and fasted and 1vellmigh starved himself, now dressed himself
in shirts and trousers of silk and in the daintiest fabrics of the
East, and lived in a large, line house, and slept upon the best
bed that Khartt'tm could produce, and ate dainties and drank
immodemtely. Father Ohrwalder tells us that he had his
clothes perfumed before he put them on, and that his wives
