we know, no attempt was ever Inmie by the ancient F,?, yptiats
to build a dam m' hnn-age across the main stream, or to
regulate the supply of its waters on any large scale. Yet the
idea of a dam must have occurred to many of the great
engineers of the Pharaohs, and the only wonder is that

According to Major Sir R. H.1trnwn. R.rc. Jlistory rgf Me
b'arragr, Ce/ro, 1896), Clot hey has put it on record that
Napoleon ihmnparte prophesied that the day would come when
barrnges would be thrown across the Rosetta and lyamietta
arms of the Nile, and that these, lor' means of cotter dams,
would allow the whole of the Nile stream to flow into either
branch, and in this manner the inundation would be doubled.

Soon after Mubamnvad'Ali hemmc Viceroy of Egypt he began
to develop cotton igrowing, and he found that the basin system of
irrigation, which was then in operation, was unsuitable for his
purpose. In 1833 he decided that it was necessary to increase
the water in the Damietta branch, and in order to eifctt this
he proposed to dam the waters of the Rosctta branch, which
supplied Alexandria and il whole province with water, and
turn them into the Damietta branch. The Viceroy abandoned
his scheme on the suggestion of Linant de Bellefonds Bey, and
agreed to his proposal to throw a barrage across the head of

time, although 47,000,000 francs had been spent on the
barrage, without mentioning, the labour of the corvée and of
soldiers, scarcely any of the piers were above the level of the
Water. The total cost of the barrage, with its fortifications,
Canal heads, etc., was about £4,000,000. In 1861 and 1863
Commissions were appointed to inquire into the barrage
question, and in the latter year, because water was urgently
