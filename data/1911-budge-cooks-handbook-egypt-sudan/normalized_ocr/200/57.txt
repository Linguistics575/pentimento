_ to adopt this prroptrsal, and directed Mr. (now Sir) W. Willcocks
to examine the barrage and to report 1111011 it. In I834 this
-en11'11ent uxpert was pcrmitted to spend £25,611 in providing
the Damietta Barrage with gates and in general repairs. In
Tune 1884, he was able to hold 1111 water to a depth of
'7 feet 2 inches in the Rosctta Barrage, and t0 a tltzpth of
3 feet in thc Damietto Barrage. The cotton crop that year
was 3,630,000 kantars, as against 3,186,060 lcantars in 1539,
which was thc grcatest known 171011 before 1884. ln 1885
about £13,246 wcre spent on the barrage, and the results
were 50 successful that it was decided to reatore the whole
work; the total sum spent in restoring both barrages was
£465,000, and the work lasted from 1836 to 1391. When
finished the barrage was ahle to hold 1111 a head of about
13 feet of Water, and it has been doing splendid work ever
