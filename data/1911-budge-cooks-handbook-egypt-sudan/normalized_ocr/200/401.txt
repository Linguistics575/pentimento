On Paras Island, 20 miles from Wtitli t_laiti'th, is Gebel

Sftdr'in (hivertimenrs. marks the administrative frontier of
Egypt on the south, and the administrative frontier of

was excavated by Mr. F. L. Griffith during the winter of

About tii miles upstream of Alu) Simbet we enter the

still to he seen there. The Island of Farms, which the modem
inhabitants call Art√©kio. was in old days, as is the ease now,
the aNule of the living, and the western hank ofthe Nile close
to the island formed the resting place of the dead; in the
latter plurc Nubian Christians of the early centuries built
funerary: thiirehes. Small tetiiples were built there even
under the. XVIIJIh dynasty, and the lmnhs in the hills,
and the ruins of l'triiemaie buildings and of small Roman
temples. prove that the district was of mnsiderahie importance
1uymmcrtially. Close tn: the river hank is a good example of

is ul' ashlar to a height of 13 feet. and its upper part of crude

the fortress fragments of stone were found hearing the ear

citadel, or "keep," still remains, and when complete it is
thought to have had fnur Storeys and to have heen about
65 feet high. At tint: time one of its chambers was used as a
churrh. In and about the area of the fortress are remains of
Churches, cemeteries, Sc, On the iedge of rock which skirts
the desert are the ruins of two Coptic churches. The
nnrlherti church was athuut 65 feet long, and 42 feet hmad, and

church is a little lnnger, being nearly 75 feet Jung and nearly
40 feet lrroad, and it was probably built in the eighth century.
A ghtlitte at the plan published by Mr, Mileham shows that
the. building is itsakew, and the maintenance of the tiahric must
have caused the ecclesiastical authorities of the day much
anxiety. It helps us to understand wlty the ruin of such
churches is Si) complete. Opposite to the village of Farms, on
the east hank of the Nile, are also ruins of two Coptic
churches; they are close to the village of Addendan. The
northern church stands on GcheI Salrilrah, which marks the
boundary hetween Egypt and the.% din, and is about 75 feet
lung aml 42 feet side, The columns are sandstone monoliths
about { t } feet high, The southern church is smaller, stands
behind the hill, and was of unusual construction. It had a
central dome with a vaulted aisle on each side of it.
