Continuing the toad to Sinai, before the end of Wadi Firén
is reached,. note should be taken of Jebel al-Munaynh, tie,

Ihe "Mountain of the Conference"; here tradition deeiares
God held converse with Moses. On this mountain the Arabs
still offer sacrilices to Mnses. At Al-Buwéh the Widi Firt'm
ends. From this point the least dimcuh road is by the Wadi
ash-Shékh, where manna is found, hut the more convenient
mad passes" thruueh Widi Shift!" and Nakh al-tkiwi, 1n the
Whdi Salrif are to be seen numbers of the small stone houses,
like bcehives, which the Arahs declare to have been built by
the Israelites, who took shelter in them from the mosquitoes
which infested the peninsula: they are called .rmecreimi; (sing.
n.amis), The Arabic word for mosquito is mrm/is. About
stx miles further on, at Wittii'Ajjiwi, the road iuins that
which leads to Mount Sinai from Tyur, the port tut the Red
Sea. At the end of Wadi Halftf is Nakb al-thim', tie, the
" Cleft of the Wind." This is mm of the grandest passes on
earth, and forms a fitting gateway to the awful heights of Sinai,
"It is it 11arrow anti precipitous passage through lefty granite
"mountains rising to the height of 1,500 Feet, while large
masses of rock on either side seem ready to fall on the
adventurous traveller." I'nssing through Whdi ar-Raha
the mountains of Sinai are seen in full view: the wairi
ad-Dér is next entered, and in a short time the traveller
arrives at the Monastery of St. Catherine. At the
entrance to this With", which is also called tihu'aih, is Jebel
"tiran, where tradition says Aaron set up the golden calf;
mul since tradition connects this valley with Jethro, the Well
of Jethro is pointed out. Ciose hy is the magnificent peak
of Jebel Mitst" t, and to the west is Jebel ag-Safgéfa, or
Ras ayeiafs; ir, from which the Law is said to have been given
to the Israelites assembled in the plain of Ar-Ralyah.

2. Suez to the Monastery of St, Catherine,
vit Ttr.

The journey to Mount Sinai may be made partly by sea,
and if it be decided to follow this route a large boat with a
crew must be hired at Suez; the traveller having embarked with-
his baggage at Suez, sail is set for Tilr, or Tor, on the western
side of the peninsula, some 120 miles down the Red Sea. An
agreement must be made carefully with the owner or captain of
the heat as to the amount of hire, etc., so that there may be no
misunderstanding on this point during the journey; in cases
where no definite agreement has been made captains have, when
at sea, demanded exorbitant sums to: the hire of their services'
