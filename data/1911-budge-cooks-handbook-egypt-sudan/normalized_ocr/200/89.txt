l-EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY. I 55

Astronomy-There is no tlnuht that the. littyptians
piossesiied a ctmsiderahle amt'amt of knowledge ahhttt the

agricultural purposes. that is tu Fay. they tlepeni'letl on the
: tppearant'e of t'ct'tain stars for knowing when the intmdmion
ol tht- Nile was running near, and the hest time for sowing
their crops. At Cl very early pet'iutl they invented a war
whisi, contained IP. months, each of 30 tlavs, and Itccause
they. tUund this year ttm short, they added I/ it tive days,

Curiously ctttltlglt, however, many of the ['Igt'ptians ouig,
lo the ycilr of 365 days, although, as we know, they wt.'re fully
aware that the year in mtnmun use was ttrat'tirally a quarter of
a lay tot } short.'l'hete may have been many reasons for their
action in this resl.acrtt, hut the strongest of all appears to have
been the tart that the tlit'isitm of the year into 12 30-day
months and the live: ttltlitit-nal days was a ten ancient one,
and that they had received from vcryearly times the ttaditionai
custom of regarding: certain days as ltteky, anti certain tings
as unlucky, Had they aJopted the year of 365 tlat's, with a
day in1crinlatcrl e't'ery four years, tlsy would have liceh cum-
pelletl t0 mun: their who! e system of lttrky and unlucky days
every h'mr years. Thus conservatism, and In'ohahly religious
Sentiment, causal them to cling to a tihanging year which only
agreed with the true year tmee in r,46r years.

The [ tractiral difficulty as regards agriculture was overcome. in
the late period hy the priests, who regarded as the true New Year's
Day that day on which the star Hothis, Le., Sirius, the Dog-Star,

Period, and each of the L401 divisions of this period was

was kept by the I'nriests, who were ahle to inform the farmers
on what day Suthis would rise with the 3am, and which
day was to he regarded as the tirst day of the Inundation,

diiticulty, An attempt was made hy Ptolemy III lo reform
