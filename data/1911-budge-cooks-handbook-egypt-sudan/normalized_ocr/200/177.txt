330 THE GENERAL REELTRREC110N.

The time when the resurrection is to take place is known only
to ("rod, The first hlast of the trumpet will shake heaven and
earth, the second will cause all living creatures to die, the last
being the angel 0|" death; and the third, which is lo take place
40 years after the second, will raise the dead, Mnhammad being
the first to rise. The general resurrection will include
animals. Some say the day of judgment will last 1,000 years,
and others 50,000; the place of judgment will be the earth,
and Mul.1arnmad is to be the intercessor with God 011 hehztlf
of man. A hunk wherein is written rm account of his actions
will he given to each man, and all things will he weighed
in a haltmee; the judgment: over, the souls of the good
will tum to a road on the right, and them; of the bad to a
road on the left. All will, however, have to pass over the
bridge As-Sinn, which is laid cyver the midst of hell, and is finer
than a hair, and sharper than the edge of a sword; the good will
have no difficulty in passing over this, but the wicked will fall
from it and meet their doom in Gchcnna, which is divided into
seven storey, one helew the other. Between hell and paradise
is a partition or gulf, which is not, however, 50 wide that the
blessed and the damned t'atmot discourse tugelher.

ts earth is made of fine wheat Ilour, or musk, or saffron', its
stones are pearls: its walls: in: inlaid with gnltl and silver; and
the trunks of all its trees are of gold. Therein is the TMah
tree, laden with every kind of fruit, and it will supply the true.
believer with everything he needs, rich, meat, drink, raiment,
horses to ride, etc. The rivers flow with milk, wine, and
honey, and the fountains are innumerable. The women of
Paradise, the litir al-'uyi'm (EL, women with large eyes, the
pupils of which are very dark, or black, and the whites of
which are very white and clear), who will he given to the
believers, are made of pure musk, and are free from all the
defects of earthly women; they live in hollow pearls, which are
60 miles long, and 60 miles wide. The beings in Paradise
will never grow old, and they will always remain in the prime
and vigour of a man 30 years ofage; when they enter Paradise
they will be of the same stature CIS, Adam, tie, 60 cubits, or
