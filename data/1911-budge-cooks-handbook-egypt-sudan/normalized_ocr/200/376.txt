we have. figure, of this king, and figures of Heti I, aneses 11
his son, Meiwphthah, etc. At Slsilah the Nile was worshipped,
and the little temple which Rameses II huilt in this place seems
to have been dedicated chicfly to it. There are numerous inscrip-
tions in many place; in man }; of the quarries, and these and the
figurcs they accompany are well worthy ofoxaminatitsn thr those
who have the time. At Silsilith the Nile narrows very much, and
it was generally thuught that a trataraet unlit: existed here; them
is, however, no evidence in support of this: view, and the true
channel of the Nile lies en the other side of the mountain.
Kom Ombos, S56), miles from Cairo, on the Etttit hmtk 0f
the Nile, was an important place at all periods of Egyptian
hiatnry', it was called he the F4.r, yptiar1s l'er-Sehek, lk the

temple of Sehek', (the crrfcodiie god), and Nuhit, and Emlk,

by the Copts. The oldest object here is a sandstone gateway
which Thothmcs III dedicated tn the gud Sehek. The ruins
of the temple and other buildings at Kom Omhos are among
the most striking in Egypt, but, until the clearance of the

site which M. de Morgan math: in 1893 4, it was impos-
sible to get an exact idea ol" their arrangement. It is pretty
certain that a temple dedicated to some god must have
stood here in the ittrly Empire, and we know from M.
Maspero's disrm'eries here in 1882, that Amenophis l and
'l'hnthmeri m, kings of the XVHith I, vnasty, carricd out
repairs on the temple which Wits in existence in their days;
but at the present time 1m parts (it the buildings M Kent Ottthes
are older than the reigns of the l-'tulemies. Tbanks tn the
labours of M. the Morgan, the ruins may he thus ciassifwd: -
The Mammisi, the Great Temple, arid the Chapel of Hathor;
and all these buildings were. enclosed within a surrounding wall.

The Mammisi, or small temple wherein the festivals of the
birth of the gods were celebrated, stood in front of the great
temple, to the left; it consisted of it small courtyard, hall of
columns, and the shrine. It was built by Ptolemy LN, who is
depicted on the walls making offerings to Sehek, Hathor, Thnth,
and other deities, The best relief remaining (see de Morgan,
Kom Om√©m, p. So) is en the north wall, and represents the king
ena Rowling expedition through marshes much frequented by
water fowl.
