practically an entirely new line from Widi Halfah to Kermah would
have to be built, This wonderful work was done in 13 months by a
few young Royal Engineer officers under Lieut, (now Sir Percy)
Girouard, R.E. On March 215t the Sirdar ordered the advance; by
June 4th the line was working to Ambukbl Wells, 68 miles from
Wiuii Halfah; on August 4th it reached Késhah, 108 miles from

Wadi Hatfah: and on May 4th it reached Kermah, 201 miles from
Wédi Halfah. Of the 13 months occupied in its construction, five
had been almost wasted for want of engines and material, and in
repairing the damage caused by rain storms, and meanwhile, at
intervals, the Sirdar, Lord Kitchener, fought and defeated the
Dervishes at Ferket (June 7thl and elsewhere, and reconqnered the
Donkola rovince. The working expenses of the Kermah line were
in 1903 E, r8, ooo, and the receipts were only £511,000, of which
over £35,000 were on account of the quernment. As the line
had been lightly laid, and any idea of rebuilding tt was out of the
uestion, owing to lack of funds, the Government decided to close
t e line to general traffic in I904. The portion of it_from Keshah
to Kermah (gs miles ] had been laid by the British with new rails,
and it was further decided to take these up and send them over to
the Atbara, for use in the construction of the Nile- Red Sea Railway.
This was accordingly done, and'? ow the section from Halfah to
K6shah is only used for administrative purposes.
