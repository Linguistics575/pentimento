The date of the Exodus and the route which was followed
by the children of Israel on their departure from Egypt have
gwen rise to endless discussions and theories, none of which,
however, explain away the difficulties of the Bible narrative,
The exodus may have taken place 1270 Bt., 1314 B.C.,
or 1335 e.tt, but the all-important fact to be considered is
that, speaking historically, it could only have happened on
the scale described in the Book of Exodus, in the reign of
Menephthah during the period of the rising of the Libyans
and others against the Egyptian power. As for the route
