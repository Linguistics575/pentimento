the Government. The Cirnurrissirul spcnt three months in

that Aswan Way" the best plncc: for fl roscrvoir-dam, hut recom-
mended certain mradiiications, all "which tended to make
the design approach mort- closuly lo that of a suiid dam, and
to increase its stability. As a result it was decided to build
a dam "cross the head rat the Aswiiu Catar: wt, tn the north of
the Island of Phila.). The maximum itudti was to he 35 feel,
aml the volume of water stored,'s'h'cioo, ococvcyco cubic feet; the
level of the water held up was to be 374 feet ahtwe the mean
level of the Mediterranean Sea. When the details of the
proposal hetrttme known, a great outcry was raised by the
principal archaeological societies of Europe, atul at modified
plan was; made, which enabled the level of the water held up
to he reduced to 348 feet above mean scaucrvl. When the
plans were passed in 1895 there was no money to he had for
such a great undertaking, and the beginning of Operations was
delayed until r893. Early in that year Lord Cromer wrote _

'l'he Dam crjrist'S the vuiley in a straight line, passing over
the tive summer channels at the rircr; the valley is 2,185'yards
wide. and the dam is built { m the ctrurssrgrairwd rt-tl granite.
At fhood_time the waterway is 1.550 yards with; with "maxi-
mum depth of 56 feet. The dam is intended to hold up
water to the level nf 54S ft-t-t ", the Inn-est level of water on the
downstream side is 332 (cct, nud the greatest hunt of water
will thurefore be 66 feet. The storage capacity is estimated
at 37,6t: ,ooo, ooo tuilaic feet. No attempt is made to store
water until the, .ivvr is practit-ally fret- frnm silt, which tJCCU1" 8
about three months after the Mile is in full flood. Usually the
Nk, reaches its maximum early in September, but the reservoir
is not filled before I) t-: :emher l'1: horiuary; the water is dis.
charged during the monthsof May, June, and july. The total
fall in Water-level from Phike t0 Aswin is :6 feet 5 inches. The
mean low Nile: tt Phila: is 295 feet tthm't: mean sea-level, and
the mean high 321 feet, between high and low Nile the river
rises 26 feet. The rise of the water upstream of the dam is
it) feet above low Nike, and 26 feet 3' inches above high
Nik:; the effect of" the reservoir is felt at a distance of 140 miles
south of the dam. The sluices are 130 in number, and they
are arranged at four diferent lcrcls, via, 328 feet, 3t5 feet,
301% feet, and 2ll7 feet: only 130 sluices are used for regu-
httittg thr: discharge, and the remaining 50 are required for
gwlrtg stmir: icnt'vntcrway to the Nile when in flood. About

uly 5th all the sluiccs are open, and the Nile is rising

rapidly. At the end of july the (lisehnrge of the Nile is

159.000 cubic. feet per second, and at the end of August the
