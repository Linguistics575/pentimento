the cast of the Sempeum, was the headquarters of' M. Mariette
and his staff when employed in making excavatirms in the
Necmpolis of tiaklrirah in 1350 and 185:. It is not easy to
estimate properly the value to scicnce of tht- wnrk of this
distinguished man. It is trim that fortune gave him the
opportunity of excavating some of the most magnificent of the
buildings of the I'haranhs or all pcriods, and of hundreds of
ancient towns: m3vcrtlshess, it is equally true that his energy
and marvellous pnwcr uf Wurk enabled him to use to the fullest
extent the 111mm; fur advanring tht- science of ligyptulugy which
had bucn put in his hands. lt is to he hoped that his house
will he preservutl on its present site as a remembrance of tl
great man whn did a great work.
