British Administrator eernes in contact, and shows that his task of
governing them and of keeping the peace is not so easy as some
imagine, The story would be incredible were it mot supported by
trustwortlty evidence, In December, rhea a party of same twent
rough-looking persans of both sexes, resembling? neither fellahin
nor Bettawin. arrived at Asyi'tt about the same time as a policeman
in charge of six camels., As the result of inquiries made by an
English official whe happened to be an the spot, it appeared that
these people were gipsies, knewn in Arabic as Halabyim is.,
originally from Aleppd, who travelled from village to village, the
whales. telling fertnnes, and the men carrying on a considerable and
1q? paretttly lucrative trade in camels, horses, and other iive-steek.
Six months previously, one member of the tribe had struck the
camel of another with a whip, an insult whieh eenid oaly be wiped
out, according to their eastern. by the veluntarjr less of valuable
property by each party, ene bidding against the other, as at an
auction, until the aggrieved or offending? party eenld not afford to
continue, When this eeenrs, the last bidder is considered to have
wen the case, by having proved that he is the richer and, therefore,
the better man. Eet'ere the appearance of the camels at Asyitt,
about E400 worth at" property had already been sacrificed in the
following manner :--The aggrieved party began by slaughtering a
buffalo, the earease tring-appropriated hy the neighbouring-" peasants.
The offender replied by killing two bulTah:) es, as a proof of the
justice of his cause. The first man then threw A's into the Nile, to
which his opponent answered with cjCtty, and so en, slaughtering
animals or throwing amay gold, until pmperty to the value of A4oo
had been destroyed. On the arrival of the gipsies and their camels
at Asyiit, the dispute hreite ent afresh, and the inset authorities were
unable to effect a settlement until the parties concerned had parted
with their camels, which were worth about says, and bid up to
354:6. In order to avert the slaughter of the camels and the
throwing of mere motley inte the Nile. as thelitigants at first wished,
it was suggested that the animals should be sold and the pro-
eeeds of the sale, as well as the money staked, given lo a Moslem
charitable society, This solution was accepted, and when the result
was made known there were great rejoicings among the Haiahyin.
The party then i: ysappeared, apparently quite content that bloodshed
had been avoided, and an insult avenged at the east of nearly di; z, rsoo,
