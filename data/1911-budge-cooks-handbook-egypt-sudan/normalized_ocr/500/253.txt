J4 vault for himself, in an island, formed by draining a canaI_frc_nt the
al Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting the pyramid itself:
LE of this, which is square, each face is 8 plethra { Baa feet), ay! the
1. height is the same; it is composed of polished stones, and jointed
"with the greatest exactness; none at the stones are less than
Ji 30 feet. This pyramid was built thus; in the farm of steps. which
ls some call crcssae. others hemides. When they had first built it 111
"this manner, they raised the remaining stnnes by machines made
"of short pieces of weed: having titted then: from thegrenne to
"the first range of steps, when the stone arrived there, it was put
dn on another machine that stood ready on the first range. and from
'. this it was drawn to the second range nn aaether machine, for the
"machines were equal in number to the ranges of steps, er theg
ii removed the machine, which was only one, and portable, to eac
li range in succession, whenever they wished to raise the stane
"higher, for I should relate it in both ways1 as it is related. The
t, highest parts of it, therefore, were first finished, and afterwards
"they completed the parts next folhvxring, but last of all they
kr finished the parts an the ground and that were lowes):.

bg On the pyramid is shown an inscription, in Egyptian characters,
"how much was ex ended in radishes, onicns, and garlic for the
It warhtnea; which t e interpreter, as I well remember, reading the
I. inscription, told me amounted to 1,6oo talents of silver. And if
"this be really the case, how much more was probably expended
"in iron tents, in bread, and in clothes for the labourers, since they
"taccupied in building the works the time which I 1tyrrttiot1ed, and
"no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and drawing the
"stones, and in farming the sutrtetraneous excavation, [ It_ ts
I. related ] that Cheops reached such a degree of infamy, that being
ql in want of mattey, he prostituted his awn daughter in a brothel,
"and ardered her to extort, they did not say how much; but she
I' enacted a certain stint of inaney, privately, as much as her father
"ordered her; and centritred to leave a mannrnent or herself, and
"asked everyone that came in to her to give her a stone tawarels
It the edifice she designed: at these steaes they said the pyramid
"was built that stands in the middle of the three, before the great
"pyramid, each side of which is a plethren and a half in length."

Thc histery of the building el' the pyramid is thus stated
by llertuhittts { thigh ii, cr;):

"The Egyptians say that this Cheaps reigned So years; and
"when he died his hrether Chephren succeeded to the Iriogdom;
"and he followed the same practices as the other, both in other
Aq respects and in building a pyramid; which does act come up to
'l the dimensions of his brother's, for I myself measured them; nor
" has it subterratteous chambers; nor does a channel from the Nile
"flow ta it, as to the other; but this fhrws through an artificial
ll aqueduct round an island within, in which they say the body of
"Cheops is laid, Having laid the first course of variegated
bl _E.thiepian stenes. less in height than the other toy 40 feet, he built
"it near the large pyramid, They both stand on the same hill,
"which is about Isa feet high, Chephren, they said, reigned
lt 515 years. Thus me years are reckoned, during which the
"Egyptians suffered all kinds of calamities, and for this length of
Im time the temples were clasetl and never opened. P_raat the hatred
't they bear them, the Egyptians are not very willing ta mention
"theirnames', but call the pyramids after Phuition, a shepherd, who
li at that. time kept his cattle in those parts" ttliry's Iransratisn.)
