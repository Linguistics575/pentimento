The Traveller in Egypt .--'l'he traveller who visits ligypt
for the first time will certainly be tielighted with the cuountry, hut
it is lirtihaliie that he will net admin: the, natives with whom he
will Chine in eentaet until he knows them fairly well. The
Egyptians in general, until quite recently, have, like other
Mulramntadans, never been nc, clrstomed th travel, and tlwy
leek upon these whet wander from ccnorttry ter country as beings
who are possessed of restless though harmless devils, Like
their Ittnre fanatical co-religion/sts and kinsmen in 1ie, sopotamin,
they helieee that the ancient Egyptians were itlnlaters E'll'ltl very
wicked people, and that that destroyed them, and blotted nut
their kingdoms and buried their palaccs and temples, because
of their iriwitr That anyene should wish to make eseat'a-
liens for the Inse ni learning er the advm1cemetot of science, is
tttore than they can 1mdttitancl, and the older generat1tor1
regard all these who tie work of this kind as wicked men.
fi' How do you dare to dig up what God hath huried? "said a
native to the writer shine years agn, and even when it was
pointed tail to him that the smallest ehjeet could net he dug
up "unless Grid willed it," he was disa: ontented with the
explanation. Egyptians of the "old sehntil," and especially
those who have heen much in enntaet with the orthodox
Turkish official, still believe that the "Frangi/' or European

traveller, has seine ulterior mtotive in geing ahettt the country,
and nothing will induce them to realize that the love of travel,
and the wish ten see new cities and new peoples, will draw trten
from their hhntes into Timute countries.'l'he: t'ttttnger (genera-
titin, though not generally fanatical, is as sceptical about the
traveller's ntntises as his elders, Dilly, seeing that mtntejr' is tn be
made out of the "liranei," he enneeals his doubts, and deviates
himself tn making, mtmey tittt tif him. The Egyptian knows
that the possession of mutter will enable him to keep wives, to
dress well, and to gratify his riesires for pleasure; he therefore
lnses tin topportunity of getting; money { rent the strangct whom
he believes to litissess an inexlratrstilolc supply of gold and
silver. Speaking generally. the traveller has 1'ery little UPIJDI-
tunity ni seeing the hetter elass tif Egyptians, and he titttst by
flu means judge the nation by these who minister te his wants
in the great eities. The Egyptian, the worst side of whese
character has not lieeit developed hy cupidity, is a very
estimable individual. He is proud of his religion, but is
toicrant tea a remarkable degree: it nttist never be forgotten
that the strietest Mulytmr1radans tlesttise the Christian faith in
their hearts, although Christians are everywhere treated with
civility, As the result of their rcligiton, the Egyptians are
beneselent and charitable ten the peer, and they are extremely
hospitablc; thcy are ehecrful, affable, easily amused, and many
are temperate and frugal.'rhcy hove their homes and their
native villages, and when Ihey are compciled by the exigencies
nt military service to leave them, large numbers of young ltten
regrtlarly transmit money to their parents and relatives to keep
them from want. It has heen wisely remarked by Lane that
the Egyptian has IIO gratitude in his composition, and the
traveller will discover for himself that even after he has paid
a man lavishly [ hr trivial services he will be met with the
demand for balishish. Partly through elintatie infusces,
partly through constitution, and partly through his intense
fatalisnt, the Egyptian in all classes is lazy, and he will never
do mere than he is absolutely compelled in do. Truthfulness
is very rare in modern Egypt, but this is in manyeases only
the natural result of loose and inaccurate thinking. The views
of the Egyptian about his womartkind are net of an exalted
character, but he has only himself to thank for this so lung as
he adheres tty the abominable system of divorce which is
common throughout the Country. In judging the Egyptian
the traveller must make allowance for the centuries of eppres-
