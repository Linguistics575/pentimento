has given us the Syriee Bible in several versions, the Epistles
of Ignatius, the works attributed ta Clement, Patristic: litera-
ture of all kinds, and a considerable number of native Syrian
werks, meet tof which were unknown privr to the discovery

held about IOC) monasteries during the sixth and seventh
centuries, it is net difficult to imagine what litcrarv treasures
their Libraries must have contained. At the present time
there are he MES, of importance in the Natron 1tieliey, and

te visit it. The reader who is interested in the history ef the
discovery of the MES. should read Fete hy Monasteries ix
