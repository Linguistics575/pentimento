The attention of the Egyptian authorities has heen frequently

evils resulting, from the indiscriminate hestewttl of G heI-tshish "

unhealthy tendency of such a system is olriws..

On the other hand, from the paint of view of the Nile

the practice. L

It would be extremely difficult for the Crovcrnment to tlet'ise
an effective remedy for this state of things. The real remedy
rests with the travellers themselves. If money were,
in future, only bestowed in return for some actual
service rendered, or in cases of evident and estab-
lished distress, the present pernicious hehit ht begging would
seen die out, to the advantage both of the people and of the
rtstters.

It is with this conviction that we venture to express a hhpe
that her fellow-countrymen, when travelling in Egypt, will lend
their aid to this important reform by abstaining here the dis-
