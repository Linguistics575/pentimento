and Italy. Even cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian government are concerned are tried before this tribunal, which<br/>
includes courts of first and second instance. The courts of the first<br/>
instance are at Cairo, Alexandria, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mane'a</span>, and there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">delegation </span>at Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sand</span>. The appeal-court is at Alexandria. Lists of<br/>
qualified barristers are exhibited in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">anterooms </span>of the courts. Important civil cases between natives, and all criminal cases, are<br/>
tried by the Native Courts (Central Tribunals), established in 1883,<br/>
situated at Cairo, Alexandria, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisueif</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assiiit</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iieneh</span>, Tanta, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Zalrizili</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>These form also the tribunals of second <span style="color: #0000FF;">instance </span>for the<br/>
petty <span style="color: #0000FF;">misdemeanours </span>and civil suits dealt with by the Summary<br/>
Tribunals (47 in number). In addition there are 108 District Courts<br/>

</span>(7). Egypt as a Health Resort. Medical Hints.<br/>
By Leigh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Canney</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>D. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Land</span>), F. R. Met. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sue</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">btyneiieial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">influence </span>of the climate of Egypt (<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxvi</span>)<br/>
has been known since the Roman period at least, and of late years<br/>
an increasing number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">visitors </span>have <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocked </span>to the Nile to enjoy<br/>
the benefits of its remarkably dry winter-climate. Phthisis (if not<br/>
too far advanced and if the patient has a sound heart and little <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>no fever), asthma, chronic bronchitis, Bright's disease, rheumatoid<br/>
arthritis, gout, and diseases of the kidneys are some of the most<br/>
important ailments that are at least alleviated by a visit to Egypt.<br/>
Invalids should remember that a stay <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a few weeks only is not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient</span>, and should remain from the beginning of November to<br/>
the end of March. In deciding which of the health-resorts in Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">given </span>case should be sent to, the physician must of course consider<br/>
whether or not warmth must be secured along with dryness of air,<br/>
whether <span style="color: #0000FF;">purity </span>of air alone or also a bright stimulating climate is<br/>
to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>sought, and whether cold winds and blowing sand<br/>
are harmful or not. It is advisable in all cases to secure the advice<br/>
of the physician resident at the spot selected.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo itself cannot properly be considered a health-resort. The<br/>
presence of a large city with its noise and bustle, the higher <span style="color: #ff0000;">relatix </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e </span>humidity, owing to the N. wind and the neighbourhood of the<br/>
Delta, and other causes, all combine to compel those who seek health<br/>
from the climate of Egypt to look to other stations. There are, however, excellent health-resorts in the immediate vicinity of the capital, such as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menu </span>House Hotel, the Oasis <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">/felwiim </span>Luxor and (still better) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan</span>, in Upper Egypt, offer still<br/>
more favourable climatic conditions<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
