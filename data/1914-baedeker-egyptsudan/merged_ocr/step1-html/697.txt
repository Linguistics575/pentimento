<br/>
On the W. bank, near the river<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>lie the remains of a fortress 01<br/>
a late period and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined </span>houses.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Faras </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>bank). Close by is a rectangular wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian<br/>
</span>period enclosing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">remains </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a castle as well as blocks of masonry<br/>
belonging to an Egyptian temple and to a church. To the S.W. is<br/>
an isolated rock with a Memorial <span style="color: #0000FF;">Niche </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Setaw</span>, governor of Ethiopia<br/>
under Ramses IL; farther to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>are a Christian cemetery and the<br/>
remains of two churches. To the N. of the walled enclosure, near<br/>
a modern Mohammedan cemetery, lies an early Nubian <span style="color: #ff0000;">neeropolis</span>,<br/>
to the W. of which are remains of churches and Christian tombs.<br/>
Extensive excavations were made here in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1910-12 </span>by the Oxford<br/>
Expedition under Dr. Griffith. - On the W. bank our attention is<br/>
attracted by the curious dunes extending between the villages and<br/>
the desert expanse and consisting of sand and the pointed leaves of<br/>
tamarisks. In the river lies <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ges</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tret </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Faras</span>, a large island, known as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Artikargu </span>('rich island') by the Nubians.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite the S. end of the island, on the W. bank, lies the<br/>
village of Aksheh, with the remains of a small temple built by<br/>
Ramses H.<br/>
<br/>
We next reach the scattered village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sam</span>), on both<br/>
banks of the Nile. Here, on the E. bank, are the remains of Coptic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conventual </span>buildings and three churches, all within a wall of an<br/>
earlier period. About 1/2 M. farther S. lies a fourth church, to the<br/>
E. of which is a hill with graffiti of the Middle Empire.<br/>
<br/>
Farther on, on the W. bank, are remains of Coptic buildings<br/>
and a ruined Coptic church. <span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dibeireh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Debeira</span>, Debiera), on<br/>
both banks, with fine palm groves. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the river lies the Island of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dibeireh</span>. Farther <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>we pass (<span style="color: #0000FF;">331/231</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ashkil </span>(E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mm<br/>

and barren.<br/>

from <span style="color: #0000FF;">40 </span>pias., good), often called simply Halfa, is a clean little<br/>
town on the E. bank, founded by the British on the site of several<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubian </span>villages. It is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital </span>of the province of the same name<br/>
in the Anglo-Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">St1dttn</span>. It contains a hospital, a small bazaar,<br/>
and a pretty mosque, and, including the Nubian village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dabar√©sa<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">011 </span>the N., has 2675 inhabitants. <span style="color: #ff0000;">llalfa </span>is the starting-point of the<br/>
government railway to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khart.ihn </span>(p. 419). The government steamers<br/>
lie to close to the station. The military railway from <span style="color: #ff0000;">l.lalfa </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerma<br/>
</span>(at the Third Cataract; p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">420</span>) is no longer <span style="color: #0000FF;">used</span>.<br/>
<br/>
About 11/4 M. to the S. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa </span>is the British Camp or Lines<br/>
(called Geiger by the natives), the base for the campaign against<br/>
the Mahdists (p. 427; donkeys obtainable at the rest-house). It has<br/>
lost much of its military importance. Besides the partly disused<br/>
barracks and stores it <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>the residence of the commandant,<br/>
large railway workshops, etc.<br/>
