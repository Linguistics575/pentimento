<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxvi </span>VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
developed the use of a correct <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile </span>representation. This is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes </span>met as early as the 5th Dyn. but was not handled with <span style="color: #ff0000;">perfeet </span>certainty until the second half of the 18th Dynasty. At this<br/>
time the Egyptian art of drawing had attained <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>zenith. Nothing<br/>
of equal excellence is found of a later date. The traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find<br/>
</span>the best opportunity to study the works of this period at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheikh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Abd'sl-liar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>and Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Amarna </span>(pp. 309, <span style="color: #0000FF;">212</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The animals, upon the realistic reproduction of which the artists bestowed great care and devotion, are shown in an almost correct <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">position </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>- Mention may be made also of another rule of<br/>
Egyptian composition which originated in the effort to represent<br/>
each object in the clearest and most complete manner. Thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">per </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sons</span>, animals, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, supposed to be behind others are depicted in<br/>
rows above them, and objects intended to be lying upon tables are<br/>
depicted standing above the tables. At the same time the principle<br/>
that objects lying behind other objects are concealed was recognized<br/>
even at an <span style="color: #ff0000;">earlyperiod</span>. The principal personages in a representation<br/>
are indicated by the primitive device of delineating them on a much<br/>
larger scale than the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The art of drawing in Egypt was hampered from time immemorial by a number of designs that <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>copied again and <span style="color: #0000FF;">again</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">though<br/>
</span>some alterations were gradually introduced. In the course of <span style="color: #0000FF;">centuries </span>the ancient treasury of types was increased by the addition<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>new and valuable motives. Thus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g.</span>, the Ancient Empire<br/>
furnishes numerous scenes from the life of the people on the large<br/>
landed estates, which are often marked by a charming <span style="color: #0000FF;">naivete </span>and<br/>
a delicate <span style="color: #0000FF;">observation </span>of nature. In the 5th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn</span>. pictures of military import join the circle of representations used in the mortuary<br/>
temples, while under the Middle Empire we find scenes of the life<br/>
at the courts of the provincial princes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andvarious </span>new burial scenes.<br/>
The supply of material, however, dates its greatest increase from<br/>
the period of the 18th Dyn., when Egypt became a world power<br/>
through its political relations with Asia Minor, and when the horizon<br/>
ofthe artists had consequently become much more extensive. Under<br/>
Amenophis IV. even the intimate life of the royal family and the<br/>
court, which no one had previously ventured to represent, was, for a<br/>
time, drawn into the field of art. Under the 19th Dyn. and under<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>new tasks <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>imposed upon the artists, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>called<br/>
upon to represent the warlike deeds of the king, and to execute huge<br/>
pictures of battles. The beginning of this new tendency may indeed<br/>
be recognized in the 18th Dyn., as in the reliefs on the chariot of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>IV. in the Museum at Cairo (No. 2080, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">90</span>). With the<br/>
end of the New Empire the supply of types again shrinks and <span style="color: #ff0000;">beeOmes </span>inferior even to that of the Ancient Empire. In scenes of the<br/>
kind here referred to the artist found a free field for his powers of<br/>
invention. When, however, he had to reproduce ceremonial scenes,<br/>
he had naturally to adhere more or less rigidly to the ancient models.<br/>
