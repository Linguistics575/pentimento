<span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span>is the king in his chariot, inspecting his <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieers</span>, who count<br/>
the severed hands of the enemy and bring fettered prisoners.<br/>
<br/>
REAR (W.) WALL. To the right (Pl. m) of the central door is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>leading two rows of captured Hittites before <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harakhte</span>,<br/>
his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">deified </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">figure</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lion-headed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wert-hekew</span>; to the left<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. n) he leads two rows of negroes before Amen, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">defiled<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Mut. - Between the two last (<span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>pillars stands a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Stelc </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. p) dating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">35th </span>year of the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>which is a long inscription recording in <span style="color: #0000FF;">florid </span>terms that Ramses<br/>
erected large <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>for Ptah of Memphis and presented rich gifts<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining this large hall are eight CHAMBERS (Pl. F-N), probably used to store the temple utensils and furniture. Round<br/>
the walls of these, which are covered with inferior reliefs, run<br/>
stone tables.<br/>
<br/>
We now enter a Hall (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>), 36 ft. broad and 25 ft. deep and<br/>
supported by four pillars. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the S. wall the king, followed by his<br/>
wife Nefret-ere holding two sistra, appears offering incense before<br/>
the sacred boat with the shrine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, which is carried by<br/>
priests; and on the N. wall is a similar scene before the boat of <span style="color: #ff0000;">REHarakhte</span>. Three doors lead from this hall into a long and narrow<br/>
Transverse Chamber (Pl. D), and thence three other doors admit to<br/>
three apartments, of which the two at the sides are very small. The<br/>
central apartment is the Sanctuary (Pl. E), containing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-hewn<br/>
</span>support for the sacred boat, behind which are seated figures of the<br/>
four deities worshipped in the temple - Ptah, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amon-Re</span>, the<br/>
deified Ramses, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">falcon-headed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">RÃ©-Harakhte</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately to the S. of the great temple is a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">ROCK </span>TEMPLE,<br/>
discovered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia<br/>
B. Edwards, the well-known writer (d. 1892), who has described it<br/>
in her interesting'Thousand Miles up the Nile'. This is possibly a<br/>
Birth House (comp. p. 250). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>chamber, probably built of<br/>
brick and vaulted, has disappeared. The second chamber, hewn in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock</span>, is the Sanctuary, and is embellished with <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-preserved<br/>
</span>reliefs.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Entrance </span>Wall. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>each <span style="color: #0000FF;">side </span>appears the king entering the temple. Left Wall. The king, followed by his <span style="color: #ff0000;">guardian-spirit</span>, offers incense to the<br/>
sacred boat of Thout. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rear </span>Wall. To the left, the king presents his own<br/>
cartouche to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amon-EE </span>of Napata<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>to the right, he makes a <span style="color: #0000FF;">libation </span>of<br/>
wine to <span style="color: #ff0000;">RiVHarakhte</span>. - Right Wall. The king accompanied <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>his guardian-spirit, sacrifices to the boat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Herakhte</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">king</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prenomen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>represented behind by the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Man</span>, who is <span style="color: #0000FF;">equipped </span>with<br/>
special <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbols</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>A Marble <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tablet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the rock in front <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this small temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">commemorates </span>the battle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Toshkeh </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">403</span>) in English and Arabic.<br/>
<br/>
From the forecourt of the temple we pass through a stone gateway made by Ramses II. in the brick enclosure and proceed to the<br/>
N. by the path along the river-bank, which brings us In a few<br/>
minutes to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
