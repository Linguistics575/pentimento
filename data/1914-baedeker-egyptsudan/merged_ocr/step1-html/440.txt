<br/>
19th Day. Steam to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span>e.t-Teir (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>226<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>20th Day. Arrival <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Cairo. Passengers may remain on board<br/>
until after breakfast on the following morning.<br/>
<br/>
Holders of Cook's or the Hamburg & <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anglo-American </span>Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">Co.'s<br/>
</span>tickets may break their <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>at Luxor or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>either on the<br/>
way up or the way down (after previous arrangement in Cairo), and<br/>
proceed by the next steamer, if there are vacant berths. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>all these<br/>
deviations from the usual tours very strict adherence to the terms<br/>
of the special arrangement is exacted.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahabiyehs</span>. Travellers to whom independence of action and<br/>
economy of time are more important than economy of money may<br/>
charter for themselves <span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyehs </span>or private steamboats (620 berths), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are not much slower than the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">tourist-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">steamers</span>. But in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sailing-dahabiyeh </span>(4-16 berths), which has to be<br/>
towed upstream when the wind is <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable</span>, not less than 2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">013 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">months </span>must be allowed for the voyage to Assuan and back. In<br/>
Cairo the best <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs</span>, comfortably and even luxuriously fitted<br/>
up, are those belonging to Messrs. Cook f Son (9 <span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyehs</span>,<br/>
13 sailing <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs</span>) and the Hamburg'Anglo-American Nile Co.<br/>
(2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyehs</span>, several <span style="color: #ff0000;">sailing-dahabiyehs</span>). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahabiyehs </span>are<br/>
not usually let for less than a month. The inclusive charge for a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyish </span>is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">400-750t</span>. per month according to the<br/>
number of passengers. These prices include not only the hire of the<br/>
dahabiyeh and its full equipment and the wages of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">raiyis </span>or<br/>
captain and the crew, but also the services of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>and attendants, as well as provisions (except liquors), donkeys, saddles, and<br/>
all the incidental expenses of excursions (excluding bakshish). The<br/>
charge for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sailing-dahabiyeh</span>, excluding provisions and all incidental expenses, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">35-50l</span>. per <span style="color: #ff0000;">month</span>. In the case of head-winds<br/>
small <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-tugs </span>may be hired for <span style="color: #0000FF;">6-85. </span>per day. Further details<br/>
will be found in the programmes issued <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the companies.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller may also hire a dahabiyeh directly, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tie</span>. independently of the agents, and take the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commissariat </span>into his own<br/>
hands; but this is not recommended to inexperienced travellers. A<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">XXV</span>) is essential<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A contract with him <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be drawn<br/>
up <span style="color: #ff0000;">stipu </span>lating for the price and duration of the voyage, the style of<br/>
living, the maintenance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh </span>in a good and <span style="color: #ff0000;">effieient<br/>
</span>condition, and the providing of a small boat to be at all times at<br/>
the disposal of the traveller<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A clause should be inserted relieving<br/>
the travellers from all responsibility for any damage to the dahabiyeh <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>contents, not due to their fault; and finally both parties<br/>
should expressly agree to submit all disputes as to the carrying out<br/>
of the contract to the arbitration of the consul in whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">presence<br/>
</span>it has been signed.<br/>
