side his temples <span style="color: #ff0000;">tiourishtsd</span>, and the kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>their richest gifts<br/>
to this god. The fame of the huge city early reached the ears<br/>
even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated passage of the Iliad<br/>
(ix. 379-384), Achilles, enraged with Agamemnon<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>assures Ulysses<br/>
that he will never more unite in council or in deed with the great<br/>

The epithet <span style="color: #ff0000;">éxatépmuhog</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Le</span>.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'hundrM2gated</span>', here used by<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">llomer</span>, was applied also by later classical authors to Thebes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, Pliny, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stephanus </span>of Byzantium all make use of it, referring to the gates of the town as symbols of its size <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>power. The<br/>
persecution of the god Amen by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>IV. (p. cii) and the<br/>
temporary transference of the royal residence to Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Amarna<br/>
</span>(p. 211) <span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>slightly. Its ruined temples were rebuilt under <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haremheh</span>, Sethos I., and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, and the wealth of<br/>
the god became greater than ever. An idea of the endowments of<br/>
the temple of Amen may be gleaned from the fact that under<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>more than 2/3 of the landed property possessed by the<br/>
temples of Egypt belonged to it, and that 3/4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>gifts lavished by<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>upon the gods of Egypt fell to the share of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, so<br/>
that, for example, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>113,433 slaves, no fewer than 86,486 were<br/>
presented to the Theban deity. Under these circumstances it was<br/>
natural that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch-priests </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>should gradually grow to<br/>
regard themselves as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>in the state; and they <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally<br/>
</span>succeeded in usurping the throne and in uniting <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a time the<br/>
royal title with the priestly <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftiee</span>. But the sun of Thebes began<br/>
to set when the royal residence was transferred to the Delta under<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">princes </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Met </span>Dynasty. For a long time, however, Thebes,<br/>
with a large part of Upper Egypt, formed a distinct political entity,<br/>
governed by the high-priests of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>and more or less independent of the kings residing in the N. In the 7th cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. the armies<br/>
of the Assyrians <span style="color: #0000FF;">penetrated </span>as far as Thebes and plundered it;<br/>
the Ethiopians planted their rule here and honoured <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>with<br/>
buildings and inscriptions; the princes of the 26th Dyn. did for<br/>
Sais what the princes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">18th </span>and 19th Dyn. had done for the<br/>
city of Amen. The invading army of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses </span>ascended as far<br/>
as Upper Egypt, but seems to have done little or no damage at<br/>
Thebes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebés</span>, one of the native Egyptian princes who <span style="color: #0000FF;">maintained </span>themselves against the Persians, added a gate to the temple<br/>
of Mont. Alexander the Great and the princes of the house of the<br/>
Lagidae probably found Thebes still a great though decadent city,<br/>
and they assisted to embellish it, as many buildings dating <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
