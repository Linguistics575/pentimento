<span>256 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">90</span>. THEBES. History.<br/>
<br/>
the period of the Ptolemies still attest. The town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolernais<br/>
</span>(p. 221), founded and endowed with many privileges by Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">1.</span>,<br/>
soon became the capital of Upper Egypt, and rapidly proved a<br/>
dangerous rival to the ancient metropolis. For a brief interval<br/>
Thebes, though <span style="color: #0000FF;">politically </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">economically </span>weakened, <span style="color: #0000FF;">recovered<br/>
</span>its independence under native princes, by putting itself at the head<br/>
of the revolt in Upper Egypt under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Epiphanes </span>against the Macedonian domination<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>But the rebellion was speedily crushed and<br/>
Thebes once more reduced to the rank of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">provincial </span>town. Its<br/>
decline steadily continued and the great city gradually became a<br/>
mere congeries of villages. Under Ptolemy X. Soter <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>it again rebelled, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>after a siege of three years was captured and destroyed.<br/>
In spite of its evil fate it once more <span style="color: #0000FF;">revolted</span>, taking part in the<br/>
Upper Egyptian insurrection in 30-29 <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0. </span>against the oppressive<br/>
taxation of the Romans. Cornelius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Callus</span>, the prefect (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ox</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">overthrew </span>the rebels and utterly destroyed the town. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, who visited<br/>
Egypt in <span style="color: #ff0000;">24 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">B.O.</span>, found only scattered villages on the site of the<br/>
ancient city. Thenceforward Thebes is mentioned only as a goal of<br/>
inquisitive travellers, who under the Roman emperors were attracted<br/>
to the Nile by two monuments in particular - the pyramids and<br/>
the musical colossus of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnon </span>on the W. bank at Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
The introduction of Christianity and the edicts of Theodosius<br/>
were followed by the destruction of many pagan statues and the<br/>
obliteration of many pagan inscriptions. The Nile, which annually<br/>
overflowed as far as the temple of Karnak, and the saline exudations<br/>
of the soil wrought harm; many tombs were converted into peasants'<br/>
dwellings; Christian churches and convents were erected in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-halls</span>, and houses were built between the columns of the<br/>
temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removed<br/>
from the monuments, which were used as quarries, and many limestone details were thrown into the furnace and <span style="color: #0000FF;">reduced </span>to lime.<br/>
