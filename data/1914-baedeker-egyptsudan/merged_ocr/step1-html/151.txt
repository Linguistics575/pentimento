<br/>
</span>custom adopted by the kings of Egypt of wearing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">urzeus </span>serpent<br/>
as a diadem or as an ornament in their crowns. - Another conception identified the sun with the sun-god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Re</span>, who, in the guise of an<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">tisherman</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>sailed in a boat on the waters <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sky <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>day,<br/>
and in the evening stepped into another boat and continued his voyage<br/>
through the underworld. As the sun-god <span style="color: #ff0000;">RÃ©-liarakhte </span>was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">falcon<br/>
</span>the sun <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>sometimes regarded as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">brilliantly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plumaged </span>falcon<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">soaringin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">firmament</span>; or like Horus the sun was a powerful young<br/>
hero, waging a ceaseless combat with the hostile powers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>darkness.<br/>
It was conceived of also under the form <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Scarabneus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>beetle<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.01xxvii</span>); the sun-god was represented in the form <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fear</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hams </span>rolling the round disk of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span>in front of him, in the same<br/>
way as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabzeus </span>rolls the small ball in which it has laid its egg.<br/>
The Egyptians of course did not believe that the world, the gods,<br/>
and human beings had always existed, but that they were created.<br/>
The most widespread belief was that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keb</span>, the god of the earth, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nut </span>the goddess of the sky, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">close </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">union </span>in Nun, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">primasval<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ocean</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">until </span>Show, the god of the air. separated them by raising Nut<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">aloft </span>in his arms. The sun-god RE also was supposed to have arisen<br/>
from Nun; another view, however, made him the child of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and<br/>
Nut, <span style="color: #0000FF;">newborn </span>every morning. These ideas of course conflict with the<br/>
other <span style="color: #0000FF;">conception </span>that Re himself created the world (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxliV</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the course <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>its history the religion of Egypt underwent<br/>
many transformations<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The dominant position in the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">pantheon </span>shifted from one god to another, either through theological<br/>
speculation and the growth of legends, or through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coming </span>into<br/>
prominence of royal houses and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cities </span>that were devoted to the cult<br/>
of particular gods. In the primitive period two independent kingdoms were formed in Upper and Lower Egypt, and Seth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span>, of Buto, the local deities of the two capitals, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">re</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cognized </span>as guardians of the two states. After the first union of the<br/>
two kingdoms had been operated from Lower Egypt, presumably<br/>
with Heliopolis as the capital, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>became <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognized </span>as the sole<br/>
royal god, and henceforth remained the patron of the Pharaohs and<br/>
god of the empire. In the latest period of the prehistoric epoch Egypt<br/>
was again divided into <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>kingdoms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>capitals being <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-kilo </span>(in<br/>
Upper Egypt) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>; the patron deity of the former was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vulture-goddess </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhbeyet</span>, of the latter the <span style="color: #0000FF;">serpent-goddess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Buto</span>. These<br/>
thus became the royal goddesses of Upper and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lower </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hgypt</span>. 1n the<br/>
same way at the end of the Ancient Empire <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptah</span>, the local deity of<br/>
the capital Memphis, became the patron deity of the whole of Egypt.<br/>
An important <span style="color: #0000FF;">rile </span>in the religious history of Egypt has been played<br/>
by the city of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ON-HBLIOPOLIS </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">loo</span>), which was probably the<br/>
religious centre of Lower Egypt in the earliest period, and in all<br/>
likelihood was for a time the capital of the united kingdom <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coronation </span>ceremonies of the sovereign seem to have taken place<br/>
in the temple of this city, and here, too, according to legend, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Raspexsn</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>Egypt. 7th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edit</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">k<br/>
