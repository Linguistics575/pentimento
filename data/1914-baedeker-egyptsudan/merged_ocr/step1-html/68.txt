</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">JO</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ARMENIANS </span>AND <span style="color: #0000FF;">JEWS</span>. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">section </span>of the community is<br/>
somewhat less numerous than the last. The Armenians generally<br/>
possess excellent abilities and a singular aptitude for learning both<br/>
oriental and European languages, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they often acquire with<br/>
great grammatical accuracy. They often hold high positions in the<br/>
service of government, and many of them are wealthy goldsmiths<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jewellers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Jews (<span style="color: #ff0000;">38,635 </span>in 1907) are met with almost exclusively in<br/>
Cairo and Alexandria, and can hardly be reckoned as among the<br/>
natives of the country. Most of them are from Palestine, though of<br/>
Spanish origin, but many have recently immigrated from Roumania.<br/>
The latter are popularly caller ]<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Shlekhti</span>', in reference to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">barbarous </span>German idiom they speak. Most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">money-changers </span>in the<br/>
streets (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Â§arrdf</span>), and many of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>wealthiest merchants of Egypt, are<br/>
Jews, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">notwithstanding </span>the popular prejudice entertained against<br/>
them, they now form one of the most highly respected sections of<br/>
the community.<br/>
<br/>
(10). <span style="color: #0000FF;">EUROPEANS</span>. The number of European residents and<br/>
visitors in Egypt was <span style="color: #0000FF;">147,220 </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1907</span>, inclusive <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>British army<br/>
of occupation. The Greeks are most numerously represented, then<br/>
the Italians, <span style="color: #0000FF;">British </span>[ including Indians and Maltese), French, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Austrians </span>[ including many Dalmatians), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russians</span>, and Germans. Besides these nationalities, there are also a few representatives of<br/>
America, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia, and<br/>
other <span style="color: #ff0000;">trountries.-The </span>Greeks <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofall </span>classes are generally traders. They<br/>
constitute almost entirely the aristocracy of Alexandria, and, at the<br/>
other end of the scale, nearly all the small inn-keepers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">vietualdealers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">balt-Znil</span>) in other towns are Greeks. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">oigarette-industry<br/>
</span>also is almost exclusively in the hands of Greeks. They are the<br/>
proprietors of the small steam-mills that abound in the villages, and<br/>
of the numerous small banks which lend money on good security,<br/>
both to the peasantry and the government-officials, at a rate of<br/>
interest sometimes amounting to <span style="color: #ff0000;">0 </span>per cent monthly, the maximum<br/>
permitted by law. The Greeks are the only Europeans who have<br/>
established themselves permanently as merchants beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ymflnes<br/>
</span>of Egypt proper. Almost the entire trade with the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stadin </span>is<br/>
now in their hands. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>recent years many <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creeks </span>have been active<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">physicians</span>, lawyers, engineers, architects, and especially landowners, but they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous </span>by their absence from the government-service. The Greeks have also the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unenviable </span>notoriety of<br/>
committing numerous murders, thefts, and other crimes, but it must<br/>
be borne in mind that they are by far the most numerous section of<br/>
the European community (62,973 in 1907), and that most of them<br/>
belong to the lowest class of immigrants. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">commercial </span>superiority of the Greeks to the Orientals is nowhere so strikingly manifested as in Egypt, where it <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>reflex <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their ancient<br/>
success in colonization<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
