<br/>
Exact systems <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chronology </span>were as little known to the ancient<br/>
Egyptians as to the other peoples of antiquity. The events they<br/>
desired to record were dated according to the years of the king<br/>
reigning at the time. To determine at what period a particular king<br/>
had reigned, the priests drew up long lists of monarchs, fragments<br/>
of which have survived to the present day (comp. pp. 87, <span style="color: #ff0000;">241</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">275</span>).<br/>
The chronological epitomes, moreover, which are all that has been<br/>
transmitted to us of the'Egyptian History' written in Greek by the<br/>
priest <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manethot</span>, were founded.on these native registers. Manetho<br/>
arranged all the rulers of Egypt, from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menes</span>, the first king, to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexand </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er </span>the Great, in 31 Dynasties, which correspond, generally<br/>
speaking, to the various royal houses that held sway in Egypt successively or (at certain periods) contemporaneously. This arrangement has been generally adopted by writers on the subject; but at<br/>
the same time, for the sake of convenience, several dynasties are<br/>
frequently grouped together under the name of a'period','empire', or<br/>
'kingdom'. It is impossible to assign anything like exact dates for<br/>
the kings before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Psammetichos </span>I. The dates, therefore, in the<br/>
following outline are given as approximate merely, and in the<br/>
earliest period may sometimes be even a <span style="color: #0000FF;">century </span>or more out<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
The dark prehistoric period, which later traditions fill up with<br/>
dynasties of gods and demigods, is illumined by a few scattered<br/>
rays of light only. It may be taken as certain that the country<br/>
did not originally form one single kingdom, but was divided into<br/>
two states - the'Northern', corresponding to the Delta, and the<br/>
'Southern', stretching from the neighbourhood of Memphis (Cairo) to<br/>
the Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silsileh </span>and afterwards to the First Cataract. Each of<br/>
these states was subdivided into a number of small principalities,<br/>
originally independent but afterwards dependent, which still existed<br/>
in historic times <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'nomes</span>' or provinces. The two Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">kingdoms </span>were for a time hostile to each other. Their final union seems<br/>
to have been operated from Upper Egypt by King Menes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>how<br/>
is unknown. The memory of the division <span style="color: #0000FF;">subsisted </span>beyond the<br/>
dawn of the historic period; the arms of the united empire were<br/>
formed by the union of the lily and the papyrus, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical<br/>
<br/>
</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manetho </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebennytos </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">174</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span>in the reigns <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>a priest at Heliopolis and wrote his<br/>
three books of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aiyux-ux√© </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Txownpiznx </span>in the reign of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">u</span>.<br/>
