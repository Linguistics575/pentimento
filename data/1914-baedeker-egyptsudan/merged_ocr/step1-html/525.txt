The great "Temple of Amen was not built on any single uniform plan, but owes its present form to the building activity of<br/>
many successive rulers of Egypt. From the Middle Empire to the<br/>
Ptolemaic period most of the Pharaohs took some share in adding<br/>
to or adorning this shrine, rivalling each other in the magnitude of<br/>
their designs. The foundation of the temple must be dated not<br/>
later than the first monarchs of the 12th Dynasty. Amenophis I.<br/>
built a second sanctuary alongside the main temple of the Middle<br/>
Empire, but this was again removed at an early period <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>278).<br/>
When Thutmosis I. made Thebes the capital of the New Empire<br/>
the original modest shrine seemed no longer worthy of the dignity<br/>
of the god, and the king therefore built round the temple of the<br/>
Middle Empire <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large court which was bounded on the W. by a<br/>
pylon (<span style="color: #0000FF;">tio.V</span>), and was surrounded inside by <span style="color: #ff0000;">colonuades </span>with statues<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Osiris<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>At a later date he erected in front of this another pylon<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span>. IV) with an enclosing wall, placed two <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>front of this,<br/>
and constructed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>between the two pylons. In the reign<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hatshepsut </span>alterations and additions were made in the interior.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>front of the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Middle Empire, in the court of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">she </span>constructed a special sanctuary, and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>between pylons IV and <span style="color: #0000FF;">y </span>she erected two obelisks, besides practically<br/>
rebuilding the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnade </span>itself. Her brother Thutmosis III. continued<br/>
these alterations when he became sole monarch. He tore down most<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>in the court of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>and replaced them<br/>
with a series of small chapels. A new pylon (No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">VI</span>) was erected,<br/>
and the court between this and the building of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hatshepsut</span>, which<br/>
had been embellished with a vestibule, was adorned with colonnades. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, between pylons 1V and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Y</span>,<br/>
was subjected to a thoroughgoing alteration, the main object of which<br/>
Was to withdraw the obelisks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hatshepsut </span>from the gaze of visitors<br/>
of the temple. Two new <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>were raised in front of those of<br/>
Thutmosis I. About twenty years later the king continued his alterations of the temple by <span style="color: #0000FF;">erecting </span>the two Halls of Records and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">antechambers </span>between pylons V and <span style="color: #0000FF;">VI</span>. To the reign of Thut-<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>mosis <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. is due also the Great Festal Temple (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tromemoir</span>') which lies to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. behind the main temple. Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>erected a new pylon (No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>) on the main <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>of the<br/>
temple. All these buildings of the 18th Dynasty were thrown into<br/>
the shade by the erections under <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nth </span>Dynasty. Ramses I.<br/>
raised still another pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethus </span>I. and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.<br/>
</span>created between this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mth </span>pylon and the pylon of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.<br/>
</span>that gigantic Hypostyle Hall which has remained ever since as<br/>
one of the chief wonders of Egyptian architecture. Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span>.<br/>
caused also a second girdle-wall to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>built, outside the wall of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>The temple now seemed to have received its final<br/>
form. The temples of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>and Ramses III. were separate<br/>
buildings, erected in front of the facade of the great sanctuary. But<br/>
