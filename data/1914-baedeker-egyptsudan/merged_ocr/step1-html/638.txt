<br/>
the deceased and his wife seated at a meal in an arbour, with their<br/>
son before them. On the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>of the tomb of Khunes are interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>craftsmen<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>bakers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">potters</span>, metalworkers beside a furnace, brewers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">leather-workers</span>, etc. The two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">last-named </span>tombs were used as dwellings by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>monks, who<br/>
have added various inscriptions. - Then follow the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khenusew </span>(sanded up) and the Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harkhuf</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>with inscriptions of<br/>
great historical importance. These inscriptions appear outside the<br/>
tomb, on each side of the entrance, above and beside <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of the<br/>
deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>to the left, Harkhuf leaning on a long staff with his<br/>
son holding a censer in front of him). The inscriptions form an<br/>
extract from the biography of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilarkhuf</span>, recording especially four<br/>
successful trading expeditions to Nubia, three of which were made<br/>
in the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenre </span>(6th Dyn.) and one in that of King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neferke-ré </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Phiops </span>IL), the successor of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Merenré</span>. Among the goods<br/>
brought back on the fourth journey was a dwarf.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Adjoining is the small tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pyopi-nakht </span>(No. 35; sanded up),<br/>
with important inscriptions on each side of the doorway. These<br/>
extol the exploits <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the deceased in the campaigns led by King<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefer-ke-ré </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Phiops </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">11</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) against Nubia and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>dwelling <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the E. of Egypt. Farther on are the grave of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senmosc </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally<br/>
</span>the interesting tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">CNo</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">36</span>) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Si-renpowet</span>, son of Sat-zeni, who<br/>
flourished in the reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sesostris </span>I. (12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>). A doorway of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine<br/>
</span>limestone, with portraits of the deceased, admits to the Court. The<br/>
shafts of the six pillars, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>here supported the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Inscriptions </span>and figures of the deceased. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Back </span>Wall, to<br/>
the left of the door, is a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the deceased followed by his<br/>
sandal-bearer and two dogs; cattle are being brought to him (notice<br/>
the enraged bulls); he appears in a boat spearing <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish</span>. To the right<br/>
of the door is a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">followed </span>by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">bowbearer</span>, a dog, and his three sons. Above, the deceased is shown<br/>
seated in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">women </span>with flowers in front <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span>;<br/>
below are a woman and two men gambling. Within the tomb is a<br/>
small Hall, with four pillars. The mural paintings on stucco are<br/>
unfortunately much injured. At the foot ofthe walls river-scenes are<br/>
shown and on the pillars are <span style="color: #0000FF;">granaries </span>(with scribes registering the<br/>
amount of grain), brewing, and weaving. A vaulted corridor leads<br/>
hence to a second Hall with pillars and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">recess</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>From this tomb<br/>
we may descend to the river-bank, passing several small <span style="color: #ff0000;">tombs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.-Higher </span>up than the tombs are the remains of a Coptic convent.<br/>
<br/>
The summit of the hill, which, however, is not reached without<br/>
some <span style="color: #ff0000;">dimeultr</span>, is crowned by the Kubbet <span style="color: #ff0000;">eh-Hatoa</span>, the small tomb<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheikh</span>. It commands a very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>view (especially by full<br/>
moon) of the Nile valley, the district of the cataracts, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">desert</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>From this point we <span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>reach the convent of St, Simeon<br/>
in M) min., by a route leading to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.S.W</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
