<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tenigra </span>of the Greeks, is one of the most ancient<br/>
and most famous cities of Egypt, and was the capital of the sixth<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">nome </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span>Egypt. Its ancient name was <span style="color: #0000FF;">End</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Enei-te-ntiire</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Enet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Goddess' (i.e. of Hathor), of which the Greek and <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>Arabic names are <span style="color: #0000FF;">corruptions</span>. Enet was the chief seat of the<br/>
worship of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor </span>(the Egyptian Aphrodite), goddess of love and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">joy</span>. Along with her husband<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the falcon-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>of Edfu<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and her son, the youthful Ehi or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Har-sem-tem</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">CHorus</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uniter </span>of<br/>
both <span style="color: #0000FF;">lands</span>'; Cr. Harsomtus; comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">344</span>), she was worshipped in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>temple which remains here to this day. Her chief<br/>
festival synchronized with the great feast of the New Year.<br/>
<br/>
The gate, to which our road leads and where the cards of admission (<span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>p. 200) are shown, forms the N. termination of the<br/>
wall of Nile bricks enclosing the temple. The total enclosure is<br/>
317 yds. long and 306 yds. wide, and besides the large Temple<br/>
of Hathor contains a small Temple of Isis and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Birth<br/>
House <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>250). The N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gate </span>was built under the Emp. Domitian,<br/>
who is here named Germanicus. On the side next the temple<br/>
appear the names of Nerva and Trajanus, also with the epithet of<br/>
Germanicus (Trajan is here also called Dacicus). There is another<br/>
similar gate (now much sanded up) on the E. side; while beyond<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-precincts</span>, also to the E., is a third gate, dating from<br/>
the Roman Imperial epoch. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Straight in front of the N. gate<br/>
lies the<br/>
"Temple of Hathor, the orientation of which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">practically </span>N.<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>Though still partly buried in the accumulated rubbish <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">centuries</span>, this temple is in better preservation than any other ancient Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>except those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span>. It was<br/>
built in the first century <span style="color: #0000FF;">n.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>during the reigns <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies<br/>
</span>and of Augustus; but it occupies the site of an older <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, going<br/>
back traditionally to the period of the Ancient Empire, and added<br/>
to or altered not only by the kings of the 12th Dyn., but also by<br/>
the great monarchs of the New Empire, such as Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.</span>,<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir.</span>, and Ramses III. The decoration of the temple-walls<br/>
with reliefs went on to a still more recent date. In accordance<br/>
with the plan of other temples (comp<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Plan of <span style="color: #0000FF;">MIN</span>, p. 344) <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>and two large pylons should stand in front of the great<br/>
vestibule; but perhaps the means to add these were not <span style="color: #0000FF;">forthcoming</span>. If we compare the temple of Dendera with a similar <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>of the earlier period, such as the temple of Abydos <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>238)<br/>
or the great national <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span>of Karnak (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">265</span>), we <span style="color: #0000FF;">rind </span>it not<br/>
less beautiful in its own way, though of course far from competing<br/>
with these gigantic structures in <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnifieenee </span>or extent. Its chief<br/>
characteristics are a <span style="color: #ff0000;">fine </span>symmetry of proportions and dignified adaptation to its purposes. Neither the figures nor the inscriptions<br/>
sculptured on the walls compare in <span style="color: #0000FF;">masterly </span>execution with those<br/>
in the tombs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancient </span>Empire or with those in temples dating<br/>
