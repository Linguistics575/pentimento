inches, and are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">ibrtmi</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">sultk6ti</span>, as they come from N. Nubia.<br/>
The most delicately <span style="color: #0000FF;">flavoured </span>are the dark-brown dates from Alexandria, known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">amhiit</span>, which are eaten fresh. The value of the<br/>
dates exported annually amounts to about one million francs only,<br/>
as they realize too high a price in the country itself to <span style="color: #0000FF;">remunerate<br/>
</span>the exporter. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">dum-palm </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hyphaena </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thebaica</span>) occurs principally in Upper Egypt and Nubia. It may be seen on the Nile above<br/>
Baliana (comp. p. 244). It is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad-leafed </span>palm <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">medium </span>height,<br/>
and its timber and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bast </span>are of considerable value. Various objects<br/>
are made out <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>hard kernel of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whilethe </span>soft and fibrous<br/>
rind is edible and has a sweetish taste, not unlike that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">gingerbread</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>The mango-tree (Mangifera <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indica </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>has recently been introduced into the Delta for the sake of its fruit.<br/>
<br/>
The vine thrives admirably in Egypt, and grapes <span style="color: #0000FF;">final</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>) abound<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">July </span>to September. Wine was extensively made from them<br/>
in ancient times, and this might still easily be <span style="color: #0000FF;">done</span>, were it not<br/>
that Egypt is already amply supplied with cheap and excellent<br/>
wines from every part of the Mediterranean. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">vine </span>blossoms in<br/>
March and April, like the palm, and the grapes ripen in June and<br/>
July. Oranges <span style="color: #ff0000;">tburtulciis0 </span>are abundant and cheap (the harvest <span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning </span>in September), and so also are mandarins (<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Yasuf </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Eftmdi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>and small lemons (<span style="color: #0000FF;">tannin</span>; the small and <span style="color: #0000FF;">juicy </span>fruit of the Citrus<br/>
limonium); citrons and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eedros </span>are of less frequent occurrence.<br/>
Among other <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-trees </span>we may mention also the pomegranate<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">ramvufn</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>yields a handsome return. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">romuuou </span>European<br/>
fruits likewise abound, but their flavour is generally very inferior.<br/>
Figs (tin) are very common in summer, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">caprification </span>is not<br/>
practised in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The principal DECORATIVE PLANTS are roses <span style="color: #0000FF;">board</span>; of which<br/>
the Rosa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damascena </span>moschata and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iloea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sempervirens </span>are specially<br/>
cultivated for the manufacture of attar of roses), oleanders of astonishing height, <span style="color: #ff0000;">carnations</span>, and geraniums, all of which have been<br/>
grown in Egypt from a very early period. A bushy tree, which in<br/>
its <span style="color: #ff0000;">ha1f-leal1ess </span>condition attracts the attention of every traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>landing at Alexandria in winter, is the Poinsettia (Euphorbia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pulcherrima</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>blossom is surrounded by leaves<br/>
of the most brilliant red, presenting a very picturesque and striking appearance. Natural forests, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">even </span>solitary wild trees, are<br/>
never met with in the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile or in the valleys of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">northern </span>deserts.<br/>

The blue cloudless sky, the powerful sunlight, and the dry<br/>
warm air are among the first facts that strike the traveller On his<br/>
arrival in Egypt; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>surprise <span style="color: #0000FF;">increases </span>when he observes that<br/>
