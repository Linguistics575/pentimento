<br/>
most <span style="color: #0000FF;">severely </span>tried, although the homogeneous soil of the valley of<br/>
the Nile requires less careful tilling and ploughing than ours. As<br/>
the dung of the domestic animals is used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">fuel </span>throughout Egypt,<br/>
where wood is very scarce, while that of the numerous pigeons (comp.<br/>
p. 235) is mainly used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">horticultural </span>purposes, resource must be<br/>
had to other manures. One of these is afforded by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>towns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>were once built of <span style="color: #0000FF;">unbaked </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">clay</span>, but now <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonsist </span>of mounds of earth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognizable </span>only as masses of ruins by the<br/>
fragments of pottery they contain<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Out of these mounds, Which<br/>
conceal the rubbish of thousands of years, is dug a kind of earth,<br/>
known as Sabakh, sometimes containing as much as 12 per cent <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>nitrate of soda, potash, and chloride of soda. The valuable nitrates,<br/>
however, usually form a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>small proportion. So largely have<br/>
these ancient sites been worked of late years, since intensive cultivation began, that they will be exhausted at no very distant date.<br/>
So long as the inundation deposited a thick deposit of fresh mud<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">basin-lands </span>every year, and a single crop was raised off the<br/>
greater part of the area, the land could go on producing crops <span style="color: #ff0000;">imhrfinitely</span>, but now that most of the land is irrigated throughout the<br/>
year a very small amount <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>mud is deposited, while two or more<br/>
crops are raised annually. To meet this, <span style="color: #0000FF;">manuring </span>in a much more<br/>
systematic manner than hitherto has now become necessary, but as<br/>
yet few <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cultivators </span>have fully realized this.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IRRIGATION</span>. As a consequence of the works described on<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>lxvi, the whole <span style="color: #ff0000;">ongypt </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitt </span>to the Mediterranean, with<br/>
the exception of a strip <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflanrl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">along </span>the edge of the Western Desert<br/>
and the right bank of the Nile above Cairo, has had its old system<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood-irrigation</span>, Le. a single watering by the annual inundation,<br/>
replaced by a perennial supply furnished by innumerable canals<br/>
and watercourses. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the inundation season (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxiv </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sluice-gates<br/>
</span>of the dams are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Open </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the red-brown <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>rushes through them<br/>
towards the plains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>When the irrigation-basins are <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled<br/>
</span>up to a <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffi0ient </span>level, the water is left in them for about 40 days,<br/>
to deposit its suspended mud and to soak the ground thoroughly.<br/>
The perennially irrigated lands of the provinces of Middle Egypt<br/>
and the Delta receive only so <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>water as the standing <span style="color: #0000FF;">crops<br/>
</span>require, since these districts <span style="color: #0000FF;">can</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>be inundated. They, therefore,<br/>
under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">present </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intensive </span>cultivation receive a very much smaller<br/>
amount of mud from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood-water </span>than the land which has <span style="color: #ff0000;">basinirrigation</span>, and this has to be compensated by extensive manuring.<br/>
<br/>
Briefly stated, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">annual </span>routine after the end of the inundation<br/>
is as follows. In November, when the Nile is falling and the whole<br/>
country is amply supplied, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sluice-gates </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>Dam are<br/>
gradually closed, so as to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fill </span>the reservoir slowly. This is usually<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">aeeomplished </span>about the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">January </span>The gates of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitt</span>, and Delta barrages are similarly manipulated so as to <span style="color: #ff0000;">maintain </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Iuwr0ssary </span>depth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">supply-canals</span>.
