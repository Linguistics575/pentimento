<br/>
E. side of the plateau was <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>extended by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrace-wall </span>of<br/>
enormous blocks of stone. To the E. lies the Mortuary Temple, the<br/>
various chambers of which may be distinctly traced in spite of its<br/>
ruinous condition. Like all these pyramid temples it consisted of<br/>
two distinct principal portions, the public temple and the reserved<br/>
sanctuary. The main chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>public temple was a large open<br/>
court, surrounded by a passage like the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eloisters </span>of a medieval <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>and embellished with colossal statues of the king. This<br/>
was the scene of the great funeral festivals. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">causeway </span>ascending<br/>
to it from the valley, the monumental entrance to which was formed<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-allied'Granite </span>Temple' (p. 135), is still traceable. To<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, within the wall that surrounded this pyramid, stood another<br/>
small pyramid, now almost level with the ground, in which the<br/>
queen was buried. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span>of the Second Pyramid, of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>a considerable part still remains at the top, consisted of<br/>
limestone slabs in the upper courses and of partially unpolished<br/>
granite slabs in the two lower (well preserved on the W. side)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</span>The merit of having opened this pyramid belongs to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Belzoni </span>(p. 126).<br/>
An inscription over the entrance records that the opening took<br/>
place <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>March 2nd, 1818.<br/>
<br/>
The plan of the Second Pyramid also appears to have been altered<br/>
in the course of <span style="color: #0000FF;">building </span>The original <span style="color: #0000FF;">intention </span>seems to have been to<br/>
erect a small pyramid <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the subterranean chamber<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Afterwards a larger<br/>
pyramid was decided upon and the chamber moved towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, to<br/>
its present position.<br/>
<br/>
The Interior is thus entered by two passages, both on the N. side<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The month <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of these, blocked up on the abandonment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
