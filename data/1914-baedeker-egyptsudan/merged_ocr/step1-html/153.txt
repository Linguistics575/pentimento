<span>VI. EGYPTIAN RELIGION cxlvii<br/>
<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>speedily regained the upper hand; the new religion was<br/>
abolished and the earlier creed restored. The Egyptian religion remained in its former confusion; the process <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofamalgamating </span>different<br/>
gods became more and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">common</span>; and religious belief gradually<br/>
lost all living reality. Men clung anxiously to the ancient traditions,<br/>
and the superstitious belief in amulets and magic as the only protection against harmful <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>gained universal sway. But no<br/>
fresh religious conceptions are to be found in the innumerable texts<br/>
inscribed upon the temples, tombs, and sarcophagi of <span style="color: #ff0000;">thelaterperiod</span>.<br/>
After the decline of Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>began to lose his prestige, and<br/>
his place was taken by the deities of the Delta, such as Osiris and his<br/>
group (Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harpocrates</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Anubis). Under the Ptolemies <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osorapis<br/>
</span>(Sarapis, Serapis), Le. the deceased <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apis-bull </span>identified with Osiris<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp </span>p. 147)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>became the national deity of Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, and the<br/>
worship of this god (an infernal deity, like the Pluto of the Greeks)<br/>
gradually spread beyond Egypt to the East and subsequently also to<br/>
the Roman empire. The old religion of Egypt was gradually vanquished only by the power of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christianity<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Future Life. A considerable diversity of doctrine as to the<br/>
fate of man after death prevailed amongst the Egyptians, and the<br/>
various views were never reduced to a single authoritative creed.<br/>
The only point that was common to the whole people was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firm<br/>
</span>conviction that the life of man did not end at death, but that on the<br/>
contrary men continued to live just as they had lived upon earth,<br/>
provided that the necessaries of existence were assured to them. It<br/>
thus seemed specially necessary that the body should be carefully<br/>
interred and protected from decay<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The next step was to build a<br/>
house for the deceased, after the pattern of his earthly abode, in<br/>
which he might dwell, and which, according to the popular belief,<br/>
he could quit at pleasure during the day. Statues, erected in a<br/>
special room for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">purpose</span>, represented the owner of the house, his<br/>
family, and his domestics (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxviii</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sacrificial </span>offerings provided<br/>
the deceased with food, and pious endowments ensured him against<br/>
hunger and thirst even in the distant future. Nor was this all; representations of food, utensils, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ere.</span>, were painted or carved upon the<br/>
walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span>or the sides of the sarcophagus, and it was believed<br/>
that through magic these representations could serve the deceased<br/>
in place of the real things<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Ornaments, clothing, ete., were likewise<br/>
placed in the tomb or depicted on the walls for the same purpose.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupations </span>that engrossed the deceased while on earth, the<br/>
pleasures that <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>delighted in, the dignities that he enjoyed, awaited<br/>
him beyond the tomb, and these too were represented on the walls<br/>
in order that he might really possess them. To this belief we owe<br/>
those <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>paintings that give us so exact a picture of the life<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ancient Egyptians. In the earliest times the grandees alone<br/>
were allowed to build themselves tombs, and that <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>only by<br/>
favour of the king. Those who <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>not attached to the court had<br/>
