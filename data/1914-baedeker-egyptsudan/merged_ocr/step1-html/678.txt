adorned with plants, from which hang rings and skins. Behind<br/>
these are two fettered negroes, after whom come negroes with <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer-</span>.<br/>
ings (monkeys, greyhounds, a panther, a giraffe, cattle, an ostrich)<br/>
and women with their children (one carrying her children in a basket<br/>
held on her back by a strap round her forehead). One of the oxen<br/>
has horns represented as arms, between which is the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>negro<br/>
suing for mercy. In the upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">row </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>see the above-mentioned tablet<br/>
placed before <span style="color: #0000FF;">theking</span>, while the governor <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEthiopia </span>is being adorned<br/>
with gold chains of honour; farther on are rings of gold, chairs, elephants' tusks, bows, shields, panther-skins, ebony, fans, and other<br/>

his sons appear in chariots dashing against the negro <span style="color: #0000FF;">Me</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flee </span>to their village, which lies among <span style="color: #ff0000;">dilrn-palms</span>. A wounded<br/>
negro is led by two comrades to his wife and children, while another<br/>
woman <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">touches </span>over a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tire </span>and cooks a meal.<br/>
<br/>
The reliefs on the right wall refer to the wars against the Syrians<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Libyans</span>. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>scene (beginning to the right) the Pharaoh<br/>
stands upon two prostrate enemies, grasping three others (Syrians)<br/>
by the hair, while a prince leads <span style="color: #0000FF;">tattered </span>prisoners <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>him. <span style="color: #ff0000;">7<br/>
</span>In the second relief the king appears before a Syrian fortress; on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlements </span>are men and <span style="color: #0000FF;">women </span>suing for mercy <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>notice the<br/>
woman holding her <span style="color: #ff0000;">rhihl </span>by the arm); the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">seizes </span>one of the<br/>
enemy (who <span style="color: #0000FF;">holds </span>a broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">took</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>by the hair to kill him; below,<br/>
one of the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">princes </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">beating </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doors </span>with an axe. - The<br/>
third relief shows the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">chariot</span>, dashing against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meing<br/>
</span>Syrians; he kills two <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the foes, while two others are bound to his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chariot</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>In the next <span style="color: #0000FF;">scene </span>the king smites a Libyan, while his dog<br/>
seizes the <span style="color: #ff0000;">foe</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lifth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">relief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>see King Ramses II. <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned<br/>
</span>beneath a <span style="color: #ff0000;">nanOpy</span>, with his lion at his feet. His son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-her-wmmf<br/>
</span>leads Syrian prisoners to him.<br/>
<br/>
Three doors lead from the vestibule into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">HYPOSTYLE </span>HALL,<br/>
which was hewn in the rock. The veiling <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the hall is borne by<br/>
two'proto-Dork columns (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">civii</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eaz-h </span>with four plain sides on<br/>
which are inscriptions. The mural reliefs are well executed, but<br/>
their subjects are of no special interest. They represent the king<br/>
before the gods and (on each side of the side-doors) smiting his<br/>
enemies <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>Syrian and an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethiopian</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. - The SANCTUARY has<br/>
similar reliefs. By the rear wall are three statues of the gods, <span style="color: #0000FF;">now<br/>
</span>defaced beyond recognition. Both these <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-chambers </span>also <span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
</span>used as Christian churches.<br/>
