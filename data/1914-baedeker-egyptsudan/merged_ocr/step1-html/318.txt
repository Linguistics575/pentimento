<br/>
broad. Indeed there is scarcely a building in Egypt that has so<br/>
frequently been destroyed by water, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire</span>, and earthquake, and that<br/>
has been so regularly rebuilt.<br/>
<br/>
The interior exhibits the usual plan of a court surrounded hy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, and in spite of its imperfect state (the N. and S.<br/>
colonnades are represented by the column-bases only) its mere size<br/>
produces a certain effect. The columns, all of marble of various<br/>
kinds, were once 366 in number. Their heterogeneous nature is<br/>
accounted for <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the fact that they were brought from Roman and<br/>
Byzantine buildings in Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>of the Court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Saint</span>) have no pretensions to antiquity; the arches are, of an unusually clumsy shape. In the centre<br/>
of the court, which is now planted with trees, is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">hanefiyeh</span>; the<br/>
deep well is popularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">believed </span>to have a connection with a well<br/>
in Mecca. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">South-Eastern </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lturiin </span>is the sanctuary. In front<br/>
of the pulpit, within an iron railing, is a column of grey marble,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, by a freak of nature, the names <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Allah</span>, Mohammed,<br/>
and Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suleiman </span>in Arabic characters, and the outline of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">prophet's'kurbatsh</span>' appear in veins of a lighter <span style="color: #0000FF;">colour</span>. This<br/>
column is believed by the Moslems to have been transported <span style="color: #0000FF;">miraculously </span>from Mecca to Cairo by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caliph </span>Omar. In the N.E.<br/>
corner is the tomb of Sheikh Abdallah, son of Amr. In the N.W.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">corner </span>is a recess with two low columns; the blood-stains on the<br/>
top are caused by patients in search of health, who here rub their<br/>
tongues until they bleed. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, which consists of<br/>
a single row of columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">only</span>, is a Pair of Columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed </span>very close<br/>
together, and it is said that none but honest men could <span style="color: #0000FF;">squeeze<br/>
</span>themselves between them.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span>is almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">disused</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>Friday in the month of<br/>
fasting, however, a solemn service is annually held here, in which the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>his grandees take part. 0n the remaining Fridays throughout<br/>
the year a handful of poor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moslems</span>, mostly of the working classes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">assemble<br/>
</span>for worship in the venerable <span style="color: #ff0000;">hut </span>poorly preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary</span>. - In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1808<br/>
</span>this mosque witnessed a very <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>scene. The whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedan </span>priesthood, the Christian clergy of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat</span>, and the Jewish<br/>
rabbis, with one <span style="color: #0000FF;">accord</span>, assembled in the mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arm </span>to pray for the<br/>
rise of the Nile, which had delayed beyond the usual period.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Mosque of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ann </span>are several Kulla <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manufaclories</span>, in<br/>
which the process of making the porous water-jars <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalle</span>,<br/>
pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ku'lal</span>) used throughout Egypt may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>seen. The chief seat <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">manufacture </span>is, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh </span>(p. 222). The material is a lightgrey clay; the remarkably <span style="color: #0000FF;">delicate </span>porosity of the vessels is produced by mixing the clay with ashes. The rapid evaporation caused<br/>
by the porosity of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lolla </span>cools the liquid within to a temperature of <span style="color: #0000FF;">12-140 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fahr</span>. lower than that of the surrounding air. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>To<br/>
