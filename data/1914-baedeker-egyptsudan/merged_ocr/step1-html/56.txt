</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">vsestwards</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">itecent </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ylrilologists </span>[ such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Reiniseh</span>) classify the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamites </span>from their linguistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span>as the prototype of the<br/>
Semitic family, distinguished by more elementary, more primitive<br/>
forms. It is universally assumed that both Hamites and Semites<br/>
had their original home in Asia. At what period each hived <span style="color: #0000FF;">off<br/>
</span>from the original common stock is veiled in prehistoric darkness.<br/>
But it is clear that Asiatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>must have affected the dwellers<br/>
on the Nile even before the introduction of the art of tillage, while<br/>
the valley of the Nile in Egypt was still populated by pastoral<br/>
races - a conclusion based mainly on the origin of the domesticated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">several </span>other domestic animals. On the other hand the<br/>
original ancestor of the Egyptian domesticated ass was peculiar to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Africa</span>, dwelling among <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>mountains and steppe sto the S. of<br/>
Egypt. In this fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>an indication of the route followed by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic </span>invaders <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The beginning of anything like <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>regular political development<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Egypt cannot <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>dated before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">introduction </span>of agriculture;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>probably it began with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivation </span>of wheat and barley,<br/>
grains of which have been found among the remains in the most<br/>
ancient Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs</span>, dating from before the earliest dynasty.<br/>
The origin of both these cereals is <span style="color: #0000FF;">indisputably </span>Asiatic; their first<br/>
home was in the valley of the Euphrates or in some more central<br/>
region of the continent. Besides these grains the funeral <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings<br/>
</span>under the earliest dynasties included also linen, wine, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">produce </span>of other cultivated plants, originally indigenous to W. Asia.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the earliest ideal conceptions of the proto-Egyptians<br/>
must <span style="color: #ff0000;">likewisehave </span>been drawn <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sources</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, however,<br/>
in this case are to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>looked for farther to the S. in that continent.<br/>
Not only the use of <span style="color: #0000FF;">incense </span>but also the sycamore and the persea,<br/>
the two sacred trees in the Egyptian Pantheon, were known in<br/>
Egypt from the very earliest period. <span style="color: #ff0000;">llut </span>all these plants are <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclusively </span>indigenous to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mountainous </span>regions of S. Arabia and<br/>
the adjoining <span style="color: #0000FF;">coasts </span>of the Red Sea; they could have been derived<br/>
from no other source. The use of incense is as ancient as the most<br/>
ancient known religion. The tree called by the Greeks <span style="color: #0000FF;">persea</span>, and<br/>
known to modern botanists as mimusops, flourished in the gardens<br/>
of ancient Egypt; and the sycamore, which is now nowhere found<br/>
in a wild state outside the regions mentioned above, is to be seen<br/>
all over Egypt at the present day.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up. The condition of the prehistoric dwellers in the<br/>
Egyptian Nile valley may be described as the result of a union between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">autochthonous </span>inhabitants and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic </span>tribes <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>advancing from the Red Sea, entered the country from regions to<br/>
the S. or S.E. of Upper Egypt. After a long interval of <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>ancient dwellers on the Nile were subjected to new <span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications</span>,<br/>
arising from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">predatory </span>attacks ofa <span style="color: #0000FF;">race </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>had attained a higher<br/>
level of civilization. This latter race must have started from the<br/>
