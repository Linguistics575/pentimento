<span>VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxiii<br/>
<br/>
</span>arrangement of the arms and legs. If a plane be conceived as descending vertically from the top <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>skull through the face, breast,<br/>
and back, it will be found to divide the trunk into two symmetrical<br/>
halves and to form a right angle with the line of the ground; the<br/>
trunk bends neither to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rightnor </span>to the left. <span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">principle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fullface </span>symmetry, or'law of <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontality</span>', as Julius Lange named it, is<br/>
common to the art of all primitive races, and even the Greeks did<br/>
not finally emancipate themselves from it until their plastic art had<br/>
attained its zenith. - Personages who were meant to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>invested<br/>
with a certain dignity are shown standing or sitting in a quiet<br/>
posture, or even seated on the ground with their legs folded<br/>
beneath them. They are often combined in family groups. The<br/>
attendants, on the other hand, whose statues <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>placed in the<br/>
grave of the deceased, are represented as indulging freely, within<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pertain </span>limits, in their usual occupations. - The art of sculpture<br/>
showed rapid signs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">improvement </span>at the beginning of the 4th Dym,<br/>
and reached one of its highest points in this dynasty and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">following</span>. Among the works of this period preserved in the Museum<br/>
of Cairo, most of which are of limestone or wood, the best are <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicated </span>at pp. 82-84. In all these statues the chief stress is laid<br/>
upon a faithful reproduction of the face; the rest of the body,<br/>
especially the hands and feet, are conventionally treated. The<br/>
artist frequently imparted a curiously striking effect to his statue<br/>
by inserting eyes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>and white quartz, with a wooden or copper<br/>
stud to represent the pupil.<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">period </span>of decay the art of sculpture attained, in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">MIDDLE </span>EMPIRE, what was probably its highest perfection in the<br/>
whole course of Egyptian history. Among its masterpieces were<br/>
the fine statue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét </span>III<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>at Cairo (<span style="color: #0000FF;">No.284</span>, p. 84), and<br/>
the statues and sphinxes which were formerly attributed to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilyksos</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>which probably also represent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét </span>III. or other<br/>
kings of the close of the 12th Dyn. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>85). These are marked by an<br/>
emphatic rendering of the spiritual expression, and are permeated<br/>
by an appealing seriousness. The period, however, furnishes us<br/>
also with creations of much less intrinsic value, such as the conventional statues from Lisht (<span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">301</span>, p. 84), with their vacant faces.<br/>
<br/>
The comparatively large number of STATUES or THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">NEW </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EMPIRE </span>which have come down to us, most of which, it is true, were<br/>
intended merely for decorative purposes, present a striking contrast<br/>
to those of the Middle Empire. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>of the melancholy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barnestness </span>shown by the latter we find a certain placid and attractive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cheerfulness</span>. Examples of incomparable verisimilitude, worthy to<br/>
rank with the best productions of the earlier period, are not wanting. Among these may be mentioned the statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>(No. 400, p. 85), the heads of Amenophis <span style="color: #ff0000;">IV</span>. (Nos. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3610-3612</span>,<br/>
p. 93), tho busts of a married couple (No.745<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>p. 87), the heads<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">King </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Haremheh</span>, of the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khons</span>, and of the goddess Mut in<br/>
