</span>marks on p. 284. After the beginning of the 18th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn</span>. the Pharaohs<br/>
also ceased to build pyramids as <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-places</span>, and prepared their tombs in the slopes of a sequestered mountain-valley<br/>
on the W. bank of the Nile near Thebes. These ROYAL Tomas <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">NEW </span>EMPIRE comprised long corridors and <span style="color: #ff0000;">halls</span>, the walls of<br/>
which were occupied by religious inscriptions and scenes (comp.<br/>
p. 284). Like the passages within the pyramids, these were exclusively destined for the reception of the sarcophagus, while the<br/>
rock itself represented the pyramid built over the grave. Since<br/>
there was no room among the mountains for mortuary temples, the<br/>
latter were built (usually on a large scale) on the plain, where their<br/>
ruins remain to this day.<br/>
<br/>
The grandees <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the late period followed the example of their<br/>
predecessors under the Middle Empire by imitating the tombs of<br/>
the Pharaohs in preparing their own private graves. This was the<br/>
case in Thebes at least. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asasif </span>(p. 305) near Thebes we find in<br/>
their tombs a complicated series of corridors and <span style="color: #ff0000;">halls</span>, the walls of<br/>
which are decorated with nothing <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>religious texts and representations. Unfortunately none of the royal tombs of the last native<br/>
dynasty have as yet been discovered; these <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>lain near the<br/>
large capitals in the Delta. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Even </span>of the larger private tombs of this<br/>
epoch few have been found, with the exception of those at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thtybes<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ind </span>a few others at Gizeh and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salslgira</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomes </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">T1115 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l-IUMBLER </span>CLASSES must, of course, have<br/>
largely outnumbered those of the grandees; but beyond the pits<br/>
which contained the bodies, and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">gravestones</span>, they have <span style="color: #0000FF;">left<br/>
</span>no traces. From pictures we know that under the New Empire they<br/>
were frequently in the form of small brick pyramids; but nearly<br/>
all have fallen victims to time. The poorer classes were frequently<br/>
buried in <span style="color: #0000FF;">COMMON </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Terms</span>, constructed by speculators in ruined temples or in long corridors underground. In these the corpses were<br/>
laid in plain <span style="color: #ff0000;">1eoffiris </span>(sometimes merely on planks <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>mats made of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fibres </span>of palm-leaves), accompanied by simple gifts for their use<br/>
in the future world. But these common graves are now almost all<br/>
covered by drift sand, and all trace of them is lost.<br/>
<br/>
2. Sculpture and Painting.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>fair estimate of the achievements of Egyptian sculpture<br/>
or of its masters can be obtained from a study of the ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues, sphinxes, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-reliefs</span>; for these, though they<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>the most conspicuous examples of Egyptian sculpture,<br/>
were, with few exceptions, exclusively decorative and were <span style="color: #ff0000;">esecuted </span>by artisans rather than by artists. For such an estimate an<br/>
acquaintance must be obtained with works produced by genuine<br/>
artists, such as the portrait statues and reliefs <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>preserved in the<br/>
Museum of Cairo, and the reliefs on the walls of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas</span>, of rock<br/>
