<br/>
Along with the pier and the allied <span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Dorie </span>column the round<br/>
Column began to be used in Egyptian stone architecture after the<br/>
beginning of the 5th Dynasty. Its simplest form was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tree-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Trunk </span>Column of two members, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>an imitation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cient </span>palm-tree supports (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clvii</span>) and is first found in the mortuary<br/>
temple of Sehme at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abugir</span>. This consists of a low circular <span style="color: #ff0000;">b </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ase<br/>
</span>and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cylindrical </span>shaft, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>adorned in front <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a band <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>

<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>. Usually, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, the column had three parts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">La </span>it<br/>
was crowned by a capital, ending in a square slab known as the<br/>
abacus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>rest the beams of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave</span>, supporting<br/>
the slabs of the roof. The Egyptian love of plants is well known<br/>
from various sources, and consistently with this the favourite forms<br/>
for columns as early as the Ancient Empire were borrowed from<br/>
plant-life. Two plants especially were most frequently copied, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vis</span>.<br/>
a variety of lotus (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nymphzea </span>lotus) and the papyrus (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cyperus<br/>
