<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Heuenistic </span>Christian civilization, which we must regard as the<br/>
hybrid product of Greek and Asiatic feelings and philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
When that point is established Islamic civilization falls into its<br/>
natural position in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>general scheme of the historical development of the world. From the days of Alexander the Great down to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>imperial epoch the East had been forced to bow to<br/>
European ideas and to submit to European domination. But just as<br/>
in the days of the early emperors the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hellenic </span>spirit was <span style="color: #ff0000;">sutfocatml </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embrace </span>of the Orient and the classical world hungrily<br/>
assimilated the cults and religions of the East; so an ethnical renaissance of the East began in the second century and the Semitic<br/>
element steadily asserted itself beneath the Hellenistic surface.<br/>
With the spread of the Arabs the Orient once more achieved an<br/>
independence in the political sphere, corresponding to that <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>had slowly been growing in the intellectual sphere. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">result<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the political union of the whole of the Near East was that the<br/>
Greek intellectual impulses <span style="color: #ff0000;">there</span>, cut off from <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">original </span>sources<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>inspiration and operating only through Semites, were submerged<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">orientalism</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On the other hand the seeds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatic </span>civilization<br/>
found fresh nourishment in the new whole formed by the permanent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">political </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">connection </span>between the Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">East </span>and Western Asia; and<br/>
the Asiatic reaction against the comprehensive expansion of the<br/>
Greek spirit operated until far on in the Islamic period. Thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Js-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lamie </span>civilization <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>its organic connection with and place in the<br/>
general course <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>history. Further, we recognize another important<br/>
bond of connection; for, if <span style="color: #ff0000;">Islam </span>simply carried Christian civilization a step farther, we are no longer surprised by the profound<br/>
inner relationship between the mental outlook of medieval Christianity and that of Islam; both systems <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>based upon the common<br/>
foundation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek-Oriental </span>civilization of Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Arabs on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>hand consistently stressed the oriental <span style="color: #0000FF;">elements </span>in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization</span>; while on the other hand, on European<br/>
soil, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Germanic spirit turned farther and <span style="color: #0000FF;">farther </span>away from these<br/>
and elaborated from its inner consciousness the typical western<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">forms </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the middle ages.<br/>
<br/>
From these fundamental principles it becomes clear why Arabia<br/>
could not permanently remain the seat of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caliphate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Damascus<br/>
superseded <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medium </span>It was only in the agitated period of the Arab<br/>
empire<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the period of expansion, that the artificial condition <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the political supremacy of the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>subjects superior to them<br/>
in culture could <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>maintained. In the long run the <span style="color: #0000FF;">economic<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">intellectual </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">intlueuee </span>of the subjugated races was bound to<br/>
tell and the deposition <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Arab ruling class was inevitable.<br/>
The levelling influence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam</span>, as it was understood by the overwhelming majority of its converts, destroyed the economic basis of<br/>
the Arab dominion and with it the prerogatives of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Arabs as<br/>
such<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The net results of the Arab period of Islamic civilization<br/>
