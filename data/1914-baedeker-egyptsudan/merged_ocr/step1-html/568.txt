<br/>
and some unimportant additions were made, without, however,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affecting </span>the original plan. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the introduction of Christianity <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>community of monks established themselves in the temple and<br/>
founded a convent, known to the Arabs as Deir <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Bayri</span>, or the<br/>
'Northern <span style="color: #0000FF;">convent</span>'. The chambers of the temple were converted into<br/>
chapels and the'heathen' representations on the walls were barbarously <span style="color: #0000FF;">defaced</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Mariette made a few excavations here, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally<br/>
</span>in 1894-96 the entire temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>exhumed <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the cost of the Egypt<br/>
Exploration Fund under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">skilful </span>directions <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Eduard <span style="color: #ff0000;">Naville</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>should be noted that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatshepsnt </span>in her capacity as ruler of Egypt<br/>
is uniformly represented with the traditional attributes of kingship, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vis</span>.<br/>
the short apron and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beard</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span>these, of course, are properly<br/>
appropriate to men only.<br/>
<br/>
The temple was dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>; but the goddess Hathor<br/>
and Anubis, god of the dead, also had chapels here, and several<br/>
chambers were devoted to the worship of the queen, who was buried<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibtn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tyl-Mulhlr </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">296</span>), and to that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">her </span>parents. The building occupies three terraces, <span style="color: #0000FF;">rising </span>one above the other from the<br/>
level <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>these are connected with each other by inclined planes,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>divide the whole into a N. half, to the right, and a S. half,<br/>
to the left. At the W. side of each terrace is a raised colonnade. The<br/>
stages were cut out of the E. slope of the mountain, and support was<br/>
given to the outer and inner walls by means of blocks of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest<br/>
</span>sandstone. The chambers devoted to religious rites were likewise<br/>
cut out of the rock.<br/>
<br/>
An Avenue <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sphinmcs </span>led from the plain to the temple, ending<br/>
at the gateway (now almost totally <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>forming the entrance<br/>
to the temple-precincts. In front of the gate, in square enclosures<br/>
of masonry, stood two persea trees (Mimusops <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schimperi</span>), the stumps<br/>
of which are still extant.<br/>
<br/>
We first enter the Lower Terrace. This is in a very dilapidated<br/>
condition, though it has lately been restored. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">COLONNADE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">consisted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22 </span>columns arranged in a double row. The columns in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>row were sixteen-sided, while the others were foursided in front and seven-sided behind. Little now remains of<br/>
the reliefs and inscriptions that once adorned the walls.<br/>
<br/>
On the rear wall of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ar</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Colonnade, at Pl. a, are traces of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representation </span>of a pond, on which water-fowl are being caught with nets.<br/>
- On the rear wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade </span>(from right to left); Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">c.<br/>
</span>Erection and dedication <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tempIe-obelisks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>ships and soldiers hastening<br/>
to a festival<span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>d. Ships bringing two <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarries </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuiin </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Below the S. colonnade are holes hewn in the rock, which were<br/>
formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with Nile mud and used for plants. Remains of palms,<br/>
vines, and the like are <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span>extant<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We now ascend the approach to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Central </span>Terrace, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the S.<br/>
side of which we can best observe the careful workmanship of the<br/>
retaining walls, intended to obviate any movement of the soil. They<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">consist </span>of finely polished blocks of limestone, with simple but <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
