<span>The Sphinx, PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">oiZEH</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span>. Route<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>135<br/>
<br/>
The "Sphinx, which next to the Pyramids themselves is the<br/>
most famous monument in this vast burial-ground, is hewn out of<br/>
the natural rock and, with some aid from added blocks of stone, has<br/>
been moulded into the shape of a recumbent lion with the head of<br/>
a king wearing the royal head-cloth, adorned with the royal serpent<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Originally it was probably a natural rock which from a distance<br/>
somewhat resembled a lion. It was no doubt the workmen engaged<br/>
in building the tomb of Khephren who improved this resemblance<br/>
with the help of blocks of stone and carved the face in the likeness<br/>
of Khephren. Afterwards it was taken for the sun-god and named<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Horms </span>on the horizon'). In front of the breast<br/>
was once an image of a god. The head is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">deplorably </span>mutilated;<br/>
the neck has become too thin, the nose and beard have been broken<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>, and the reddish tint which enlivened the face has almost disappeared. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>in spite of all injuries it preserves even now an<br/>
impressive expression of strength and majesty. The entire height<br/>
of the monument, from the pavement to the crown of the head, is<br/>
said to be 66 ft., while its length from the fore-paws to the root<br/>
of the tail is 187 ft. The ear, according to Mariette, is 41/2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.</span>, the<br/>
nose 5 ft. 7 in., and the mouth 7 ft. 7 in. in length; and the extreme<br/>
breadth of the face is 13 ft. 8 inches. If the traveller stands on the<br/>
upper part of the ear he cannot stretch his hand as far as the crown<br/>
o t' the head. There is a hollow in the head.<br/>
<br/>
The Excavation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinx</span>, so far as is now known, was first undertaken by Thutmosis IV. (see below)<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>and Roman<br/>
periods the colossus was several times restored and was highly admired<br/>
and revered, as numerous inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upon </span>it testify. Curiously enough,<br/>
the Sphinx was mentioned <span style="color: #0000FF;">neither </span>by Herodotus nor by any later Greek<br/>
traveller. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mati </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lions </span>which now <span style="color: #0000FF;">disfigure </span>it date <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Arab<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">domination </span>In 1380 it fell a <span style="color: #0000FF;">victim </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ieonoelastie </span>zeal of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fanatic<br/>
</span>sheikh, and it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">afterwards </span>used as a target by the barbarous <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>.<br/>
- In the 19th century the Sphinx <span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ihrst </span>completely excavated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cavigtia<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">126</span>), at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">costuhm</span>.) of an English society. He discovered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>steps which ascended to the stupendous monument, and also found between the paws of the lion a carefully laid pavement, <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>end <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>next to the breast of the Sphinx rose a kind <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>open <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>The latter<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>enclosed by two partitions, through which ran a passage, in the middle<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a recumbent lion, <span style="color: #0000FF;">facing </span>the Sphinx. In the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">background </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>each side were <span style="color: #0000FF;">memorial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stones </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Thutmosis IV.<br/>
and Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>. The Sphinx was again excavated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maspero </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">886</span>. At<br/>
present, however, the Sphinx is much sanded up <span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span>that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">abovementioned </span>structures are no longer visible<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>About 50 yds. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. of the Sphinx lies the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Valley<br/>
</span>Temple of Khephren, long known <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the'GRANITE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tmuua</span>', discovered by Mariette in 1853 and almost completely excavated by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">You </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sieglin </span>expedition in 1909-10. This was the sanctuary<br/>
erected as an entrance to the causeway which ascended from the<br/>
valley to the mortuary temple and pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khephren</span>. It is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>example of the simple and majestic architecture of a period<br/>
when the art of working the hardest kinds of stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>already<br/>
attained perfection.<br/>
