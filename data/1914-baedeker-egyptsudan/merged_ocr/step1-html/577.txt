<br/>
The Second Court is entered through a gap in the wall to the<br/>
right of the colossus. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is in much better preservation than the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>court, and is mentioned with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">caryatides </span>in Diodorus's description of the tomb of Osymandyas. On all four sides were <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>; those to the right and left (N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, almost wholly destroyed) had two rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-bud </span>columns, while <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>on the<br/>
front (E.) and back (W.) had each one row of square pillars with<br/>
statues of Osiris, that on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>having <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span>a row of papyrus<br/>
bud columns. The W. colonnade or vestibule is raised on a kind<br/>
of terrace. Four of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Osiris-pillars in front are still extant, and<br/>
also four at the back. On the shafts of the columns and the sides<br/>
of the pillars are representations of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir</span>. sacrificing to the<br/>
gods. The figures of Osiris, most of which are headless<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>likewise<br/>
represent Ramses II.<br/>
<br/>
The part of the front wall which is still standing is now supported on the side next the court by modern brick buttresses. Upon<br/>
it are two rows of interesting reliefs, bearing traces of colouring and<br/>
easily distinguishable with the aid of an opera-glass. Those in the<br/>
Lower Row once more refer to the Hittite <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>and commemorate<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>'s great exploits at the Battle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadesh</span>. The king (to<br/>
the left), much larger than the other warriors, dashes along in his<br/>
chariot. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hittites</span>, pierced by his arrows or <span style="color: #0000FF;">trodden </span>down by the<br/>
horses, fall in confused heaps; crowds of them are hurled into the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Orontes</span>. Farther to the right appears the battlemented fortress of<br/>
Kadesh, round which the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">flows</span>. Beside it, on the other side<br/>
of the river, are Hittite troops that have had no share in the battle;<br/>
some of them hold out helping hands to their drowning comrades.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Row </span>contains scenes from the Festival <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofMin </span>(the <span style="color: #ff0000;">harvestgod</span>), which was celebrated when the king ascended the throne<br/>
(p. 325). To the left stands the king, awaiting the procession,<br/>
which is headed by priests carrying the images of the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancestors</span>. Two tall poles erected in front of the king bear the god's<br/>
headdress. Adjacent are priests letting four birds <span style="color: #0000FF;">fly</span>, for the purpose<br/>
of carrying tidings to the four quarters of the globe that the Pharaoh<br/>
has attained the crown; to the right the king appears cutting a sheaf<br/>
with a sickle for <span style="color: #0000FF;">presentation </span>to the god.<br/>
<br/>
This second court also contained colossal statues of the king.<br/>
Fragments of one of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>black granite) lie upon the ground,<br/>
