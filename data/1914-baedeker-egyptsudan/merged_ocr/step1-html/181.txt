<span>VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART. <span style="color: #0000FF;">elm<br/>
<br/>
</span>distinctly begun to decline, and it is not till we reach the works<br/>
of the 18th Dyn. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. in the temples of Luxor and Deir <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Balm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>,<br/>
and in some of the graves of Sheikh'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kurna</span>) that we find<br/>
some <span style="color: #ff0000;">approaeh </span>to the old excellence. From this period on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">decline </span>is steady, though a few graceful and attractive reliefs were<br/>
produced in the time of Sethos I. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">c.g</span>. in Abydos, p. 239). The<br/>
too lavish demands made upon artistic resource for the decoration<br/>
of the numerous new temples led, under Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rough </span>and<br/>
ready style of work, the defects of which were multiplied under<br/>
Merenptah. - In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SA'iTE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PERIOD </span>the works of the Ancient Empire<br/>
were again selected as models for sculptures in this branch of the<br/>
plastic art, though no attempt was made to rival the ancient masters<br/>
with actual copies. But all the same the reliefs of this period <span style="color: #0000FF;">otter </span>a<br/>
pleasing contrast to those of the reign of Ramses IL, in their delicate and exact execution, and in a certain elegance and <span style="color: #ff0000;">aeharming<br/>
</span>softness of form. - Art under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">PTOLEMIES </span>was at <span style="color: #ff0000;">tirst </span>content to<br/>
follow in the track of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.aite </span>artists; but it gradually grew more<br/>
and more crude, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-Walls </span>were <span style="color: #ff0000;">overladen </span>with rows of<br/>
tasteless reliefs, contrasting with the good taste shown by the earlier artists in interspersing decorated with <span style="color: #ff0000;">undeeorated </span>surfaces.<br/>
The figures of men and gods in these became heavy and shapeless,<br/>
so that their features and limbs have a swollen appearance. Unfortunately the reliefs of this late period of Egyptian art are the most<br/>
numerous and most conspicuous in Upper Egypt, and thus it is that<br/>
the traveller is inclined to assign to Egyptian sculpture a much<br/>
lower rank than even its mediocre productions deserve. <span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>All reliefs were painted, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>many of them have now lost every trace of<br/>
colour. When Painting was used instead <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sculpture </span>(as, e.g., in the<br/>
tombs of the 18th Dyn. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheikh'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-liurroa</span>, p. 309), it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>so<br/>
either in order to save expense or because the available stone was<br/>
not suitable for carvings. That the same rules of drawing applied<br/>
to paintings as applied to reliefs need scarcely be stated.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult for the ordinary student to obtain a proper appreciation of Egyptian reliefs and paintings, owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar<br/>
</span>style of Drawing. This arose in the prehistoric age, but was remodelled at a very early period of Egyptian history, and it is easy<br/>
to recognize how in the course of time the means for representing<br/>
the phenomenal world were multiplied. Many forms <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the earlier<br/>
period, however, were religiously adhered to. The characteristic<br/>
Egyptian drawing represents the human figure as a composition<br/>
of the various parts of the body drawn from different points of<br/>
view. The head is seen from the side, while the eyes are drawn from<br/>
the front. The shoulders are shown facing us, without <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreshortening</span>, and the rest of the body and the feet and legs in profile.<br/>
The inconsistencies of this method were felt by the later Egyptian<br/>
artists, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffleulty </span>was got over by treating the whole as in<br/>
three-quarter profile. Alongside of this normal type there gradually<br/>
