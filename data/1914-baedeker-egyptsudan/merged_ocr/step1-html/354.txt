<br/>
The total <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>is 147 ft. square and 43 ft. in height; externally the walls batter. The facade, on the E. side, was pierced by<br/>
two huge portals (now closed), surrounded by monumental royal<br/>
inscriptions. The present entrance is from the ancient Causeway<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">JI</span>. a). We descend the corridor (P1. b) to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antechumber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">JI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>),<br/>
constructed of red granite, in which the passages leading from the<br/>
two portals unite. Here is also the well (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">l</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>full of water,<br/>
in which Mariette found the famous statue of Khephren now <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>the museum at Cairo (<span style="color: #ff0000;">11.83</span>). We return through the large doorway in the central axis of the building into the main Hypostyle<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Halt </span>(P1. <span style="color: #ff0000;">f</span>), which is shaped like an inverted T, the main arm being<br/>
57 ft. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lqng </span>and 291/2 ft. broad, and the cross arm 82 ft. long and<br/>
23 ft. broad. Sixteen <span style="color: #0000FF;">monolithic </span>granite pillars divide the main<br/>
arm into three aisles, the cross arm into two. The stone beams of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>still preserve their sharp edges. These rooms were<br/>
lighted by means of small oblique openings, still to be seen in the<br/>
upper part of the side-walls. Against the walls originally stood 23<br/>
colossal royal statues, the bases of which have left rectangular marks<br/>
on the pavement. Several of these statues are now in Cairo. <span style="color: #ff0000;">F.-.-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>angle of the hypostyle hall a dark passage leads to a<br/>
group of Storerooms (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. g), arranged in two stories with three rooms<br/>
in each. Thence we return to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-corridor </span>(Pl. b), quit it<br/>
by a door <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">theleft</span>, and follow a short oblique passage to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Porter's<br/>
</span>Room (Pl. h), which is constructed of slabs of alabaster. To the<br/>
right in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corridor </span>is the entrance to an Inclined Plane (Pl. i),<br/>
which turns twice at a right angle and leads to the Roof of the<br/>
temple. The pavement and walls of this plane are likewise <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span>of alabaster<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
