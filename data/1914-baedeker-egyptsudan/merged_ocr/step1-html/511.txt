<br/>
The main entrance to the temple by the great pylon (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">258</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>is now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">closed</span>. We therefore leave the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon </span>to the last and proceed from the<br/>
road on the bank of the river to the court of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>(p. 260),<br/>
whence we visit the older parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sanctuary <span style="color: #0000FF;">CHA</span>; pp. 260, 261). We<br/>
then return to the court and proceed through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>(p. 259) to<br/>
the court of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">959</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Admission-tickets </span>(p. 200) must not be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">forgotten</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>In the following description, however, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned<br/>
<br/>
</span>To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>of the town and close to the bank ofthe Nile rises<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imposing<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*Temple </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">B</span>, 3, 4), which still contains the little<br/>
mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lagging </span>within its N. part. The temple was built<br/>
by Amenophis 111<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(18th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>; p. cii) on the site of an older<br/>
sanctuary of sandstone, and was dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, his wife or<br/>
daughter Mat, and their son, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">moon-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khons</span>. Like all<br/>
Egyptian temples, it included the sanctuaries with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoining </span>rooms, a large hypostyle hall, and an open peristyle court. The<br/>
last was to have been preceded by a large hypostyle hall with <span style="color: #0000FF;">several </span>aisles, but only the central rows of columns had been erected<br/>
at the death of the king. The temple was then 208 yds. in length,<br/>
while its greatest breadth was 60 yds. Opposite the temple was a<br/>
granite chapel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. During the religious revolution under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>IV. (comp. p. 255) the representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>were obliterated, and a sanctuary of the'Sun' was<br/>
built beside the temple<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tut-enkh-Amun </span>(p. cii) transferred the<br/>
royal residence back to Thebes, and caused the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1uifinished </span>great<br/>
hypostyle hall to be hastily completed and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>to be decorated<br/>
with reliefs (p. 260), in which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilaremheb </span>afterwards substituted<br/>
his own name for that of his predecessor<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The'Temple of the Sun'<br/>
was destroyed<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and in the reign of Sethos the figures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen<br/>
</span>were restored. Ramses IL, the greatest builder among the Pharaohs,<br/>
could not refrain from adding to the temple at Luxor. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>added a<br/>
large <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>court in front <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>completed temple; he'usurped'<br/>
the ancient chapel of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III. and replaced the old reliefs<br/>
with new ones; and he erected a massive pylon, the entrance of<br/>
which was formed next the chapel of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis</span>, so that the longer<br/>
axis of the main temple was altered. The total length of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple<br/>
</span>was now <span style="color: #ff0000;">284 </span>yds. Later centuries brought few alterations to the<br/>
temple of Luxor. After the <span style="color: #0000FF;">introduction </span>of Christianity it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">converted </span>into a church. A modern wall on the side next the river<br/>
protects it against <span style="color: #0000FF;">damage </span>from inundation<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
