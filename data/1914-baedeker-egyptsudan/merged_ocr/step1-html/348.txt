<span>130 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PYRAMIDS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>GiZEH. Great Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately in front of the entrance to the latter a formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">concealed </span>opening in the pavement gives access to the horizontal passage <span style="color: #ff0000;">cf</span>,<br/>
which terminates in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Chamber of the Queen (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">g</span>). This<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span>is at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>3 ft. <span style="color: #ff0000;">fl </span>in. only in height, but at a distance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">61/2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yds</span>.<br/>
from the chamber the paving has been removed so that the height increases<br/>
to 5 ft. <span style="color: #ff0000;">8inches</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and S. sides of the chamber are each 17 ft. in<br/>
length, and the E. and W. sides 18 ft. 10 inches. The height is 20 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Aim</span>,<br/>
including the pointed <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof</span>, which rises <span style="color: #0000FF;">51/2 </span>ft. above the top <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the walls<br/>
and consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous </span>blocks with their ends sunk into the surrounding<br/>
masonry.<br/>
<br/>
The jointing and polish of the tine-grained <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam </span>limestone<br/>
in the Great Hall (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. h) form an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unsurpassable </span>marvel of <span style="color: #0000FF;">skilful<br/>
</span>masonry, of which the Arab historian'Abdellatif accurately remarks, that neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the<br/>
joints of the stones. The Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>is 28 ft. high and 155 ft. long.<br/>
The lower part is 3 ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, above<br/>
the stone ramps on each side, which are 1 ft. 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>thick and <span style="color: #ff0000;">2ft</span>.<br/>
high, is 63/4 ft. in width. The roof is formed of seven courses of<br/>
stone projecting one above the other and crowned by horizontal<br/>
slabs. The incisions <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the walls were used to facilitate the introduction of the sarcophagus. On the smooth floor are irregularly hewn<br/>
hollows, which now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At<br/>
the end of the Great Hall is a small horizontal <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage</span>, 22 ft. long<br/>
and 3 ft. 8 in. high, expanding about the middle into an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antechamher </span>(P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>once closed by four trap-doors of granite<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
remains of one of these slabs, in its pendent position, should be<br/>
noticed. We next enter the Tomb Chamber proper, commonly called<br/>
the King's Chamber (Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">k</span>). The N. and S. sides are each 17 ft. in<br/>
length, the E. and W. sides 341/2 ft., and the height is 19 ft.; the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>of the chamber is 1391/2 ft. above the plateau on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the<br/>
Pyramid stands. The chamber is entirely lined with granite and<br/>
is roofed with nine enormous slabs of granite, each <span style="color: #ff0000;">181/2 </span>ft. in<br/>
length, above which five chambers (l, m, n, <span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span>) have been formed,<br/>
which may be reached from the Hall h by means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ladders</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In constructing these hollow <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers </span>the over-cautious builders made<br/>
an <span style="color: #0000FF;">error </span>in their calculations<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for as a matter of fact the uppermost<br/>
chamber by itself would have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">trufileient </span>to prevent the roof of the<br/>
King's Chamber being crushed by the superincumbent weight. The name<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">thops </span>was found in the two highest chambers (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The King's Chamber now contains nothing but an empty and<br/>
mutilated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sarcophagus </span>of granite, bearing no trace of an inscription,<br/>
the lid of which had disappeared before the time of the French<br/>
expedition (p. 126). The sarcophagus is <span style="color: #ff0000;">772 </span>ft. long, 3 ft. 3 in.<br/>
wide, and 3 ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>. high. The very massive sides ring with a clear<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tone </span>when struck. Curiously enough, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">King</span>'s Chamber does not<br/>
lie exactly in a line with the diagonal of the Pyramid but is 16 ft.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dim </span>to the S. of it.<br/>
<br/>
The Air Shafts (Pl. G, <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>), the ends of which are seen about<br/>
3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>of the chamber, were perhaps constructed from<br/>
religious motives. They are about 6 in. in height and <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>in. in width<br/>
<br/>
