street planted with trees (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cl</span>, D, 2, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>. Even under the Pharaohs<br/>
the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, the chief god of Thebes, was considered the<br/>
most striking creation of an age peculiarly famous for architectural<br/>
achievements. To this day few <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>buildings in the world can<br/>
match its dimensions. Farther to <span style="color: #0000FF;">theN</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>is another extensive templesite at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afedam0t </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">281</span>), which must be regarded as occupying the<br/>
site of a suburb of Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
On the left (<span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>) bank <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>281) was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>, with vaults in<br/>
the rock and tombs on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-soil</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>by many temples<br/>
and dwelling-houses. Even in antiquity the Tombs of the Kings<br/>
(p. 284) were reckoned among the chief sights of ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The HISTORY of Thebes under the Ancient Empire is veiled in<br/>
uncertainty. The Egyptian name for the town was <span style="color: #ff0000;">WEset</span>, or more<br/>
shortly Newt,'the city', whence the Scriptural name No or No-Amon<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">i'eity</span>','city of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amon</span>'). The W. bank was known as'the West of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wtiset</span>' or'the West of the city'. No satisfactory explanation has<br/>
been offered of why the Greeks called it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">87730</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>a name<br/>
they frequently bestowed upon their own cities. Among the Greeks<br/>
the town was known also as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ato'crroltg</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'city </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zens</span>' (Amen),<br/>
also called Diospolis <span style="color: #0000FF;">hé </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">megalé </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diospolis </span>Magna to distinguish it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Diospolis Parva or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Him </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">244</span>). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wéset </span>was the capital of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>, and it was ruled by princes of its own, whose tombs (6th Dyn.)<br/>
were discovered at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu'l </span>Negga (p. 283). The local deity was<br/>
the falcon-headed Mont, a god of war, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>worshipped also in<br/>
the neighbouring town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermonthis</span>. Several other places lay near<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wéset </span>on the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span>; among these were <span style="color: #ff0000;">Epet-Esowet </span>(the modern<br/>
Karnak) and South <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ape</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>(Luxor), which were afterwards incorporated<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">great'city</span>' and subjected to the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">governors</span>.<br/>
<br/>
When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>princes assumed the royal dignity during the<br/>
Middle Empire Thebes rose to a more commanding position. The<br/>
city was <span style="color: #0000FF;">adorned </span>with temples, amongst which the large shrines<br/>
raised in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Epet-Esotret </span>and South Apet to the god Amen <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>conspicuous. But the greatness of Thebes dates only from the beginning of the New Empire. The liberation of the country from the<br/>
Hyksos and the reunion of the empire was directed from Thebes,<br/>
and that city continued for centuries to be the favourite seat of the<br/>
Pharaohs, and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures<br/>
exacted as tribute or brought as booty from conquered nations. A<br/>
large share of this wealth was bestowed upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieent </span>and gigantic temples erected at this period to the god are<br/>
still among the chief sights of Thebes. The grandees <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>kingdom<br/>
esteemed it an honour to become priests of Amen, the schools be<br/>
