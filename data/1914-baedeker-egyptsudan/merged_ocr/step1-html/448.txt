<span>210 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MELLAWI</span>. From Cairo<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">columns </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">foreeourt </span>and the main hall project from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rubbishheaps</span>. The vestiges of public buildings are now exceedingly scanty,<br/>
though the French Expedition saw a <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphal </span>arch, a theatre, and<br/>
streets flanked with columns. Granite columns and capitals lie<br/>
scattered about. Near the ruins of a large building on the road<br/>
running to the E. from the mosque lies a broken marble basin,<br/>
which must have had a diameter of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span>ft. The Roman and<br/>
Christian cemeteries have recently been much injured.<br/>
<br/>
To the S. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheikh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAtrideh </span>we reach Deir Abu Hennes <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tonvent </span>of St. <span style="color: #ff0000;">John</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, called also simply Ed-Deir, a village on the E.<br/>
bank inhabited by about 2000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts</span>. Near it is a ruined town of<br/>
the Christian epoch, known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">E2-hfedtnelv</span>. On the N. side of a<br/>
ravine in the hill behind the village are many ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">trave-like<br/>
</span>quarries, which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">titted </span>up at an early date as Christian chapels<br/>
or <span style="color: #ff0000;">anehorites</span>' dwellings. The largest Chapel, in which divine service<br/>
is held, may be reached from the village in 1 hr.; it is said to date<br/>
from the time of the Empress Helena and contains paintings of saints<br/>
and scenes from the New Testament, but those in the neighbouring<br/>
Chapel (Raising of Lazarus, Marriage at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cana</span>, etc.) are better. Deir <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Bersheh </span>(see below) is within 1/2 hr<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>of Deir Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hennes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately beyond <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roda </span>the mountains on the E. bank <span style="color: #0000FF;">recede<br/>
</span>farther from the river. <span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-cane </span>harvest, in the beginning of February, this region presents a busy scene.<br/>
<br/>
1811/2 M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mellawi </span>(Mallawi; modest Inn at the station, <span style="color: #0000FF;">R.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>pias.), a <span style="color: #ff0000;">distriet-eapital </span>on the W. bank of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibrthirntyeh </span>Canal,<br/>
with 20,250 <span style="color: #ff0000;">i11hab.</span>, has a frequented market on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sundays.. </span>In the<br/>
vicinity are many palms. To the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>have a view of the E. range<br/>
of hills, in which are the tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Bersheh </span>(see below) and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shaikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>231). A shady route, skirting a canal, leads hence<br/>
in about <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hr</span>. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ashmunein </span>and the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermopolis </span>(p.209).<br/>
<br/>
Opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mellawi</span>, on the E. bank, a little way from the river,<br/>
lies the Coptic village <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Deir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eI-Bersheh</span>. Beside a Coptic cemetery<br/>
to the E. begins a desert-ravine, running N.W. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>, and named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wddi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nakhleh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dei </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Bershch</span>, in the steep sides of which are<br/>
numerous quarries and ancient tombs. The valley is <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>noted<br/>
for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">roelc-tombs </span>in its <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>slope, <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span>the Middle<br/>
Empire by the princes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the'hare-nome</span>' (p. 209), which included<br/>
this region. The only one that need be visited is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMB </span>2, belonging <span style="color: #0000FF;">to'l'HuTI-Ho'nap</span>, son of Kai, prince of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Home </span>in the reigns of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemh√©t </span>II. and Sesostris II. and III.<br/>
This tomb is constructed in the same way as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benihasan</span>.<br/>
The Vestibule, originally supported by two palm-columns, has fallen<br/>
in. A door leads hence to the Inner Chamber, the walls of which<br/>
were embellished with reliefs, now partly destroyed. On the Left<br/>
Wall is a scene representing the transportation of a colossal statue<br/>
of the deceased from the quarries <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Het-nub (p. 218) to a temple.<br/>
The inscription informs us that the statue was of alabaster and<br/>
