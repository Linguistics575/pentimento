<br/>
In spite of the numerous religious inscriptions and <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>that have come down to us from Egyptian antiquity our<br/>
knowledge of the Egyptian religion is still comparatively slight. We<br/>
are indeed acquainted with the names and aspects of many deities,<br/>
and we know in what temples they were worshipped, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>of the true<br/>
essence of these deities, of the particular <span style="color: #ff0000;">signif1eanee </span>attributed to<br/>
them by priests and people, of the myths attached to the personality<br/>
of each<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>we know very little. The Egyptians themselves never evolved<br/>
a clear and complete religious system. Their faith accepted the most<br/>
glaring <span style="color: #0000FF;">incongruities</span>; and no attempt was made to harmonize <span style="color: #0000FF;">popular </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">credulity </span>with the esoteric wisdom or to reconcile tradition with later <span style="color: #ff0000;">accretious</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The complicated religion which the texts of later times make<br/>
known to us did not exist in prehistoric days. Originally the country<br/>
was divided into a number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">town </span>and village communes, each one<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>which had its own protecting deity or'town god'. We know many<br/>
of these local deities, without, however, being able to assert positively their original locality. Among them were Horus, who was<br/>
worshipped in Buto, the ancient capital <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Lower Egypt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thom</span>,<br/>
the patron deity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermopolis</span>; Osiris, originally worshipped at<br/>
Busiris in the Delta; the gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptah </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphis</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Herishef </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Heracleopolis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alum </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIeliopolis</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sobek</span>, who was worshipped in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Faiyiirn</span>, etc. Frequently there are goddesses also who appear as<br/>
protecting divinities of places: e.g. Neith, worshipped in Sais, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Humor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Dendera. These local deities have often lost their original names, and in many cases were known only by some attribute<br/>
or some legendary name. Thus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">e.9.</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lion-goddess </span>who was<br/>
worshipped in the vicinity of Memphis was known as Sekhmet, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<br/>
'the mighty'; the god worshipped in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitst</span>. in the form of a wolf<br/>
was named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wep-mawet</span>, the'Path Opener', probably because his<br/>
image, borne in the van of the troops<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>led the way into the enemy's<br/>
country; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">local </span>deity of This was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">EnhuretNreek </span>Onuris),<br/>
'he <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>fetched the distant <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span>', probably because according to an<br/>
ancient legend he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>said to have brought a lion-goddess, who was<br/>
worshipped along with him, from a foreign land. Other local deities<br/>
came to be called after the town to which they belonged. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thus </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cat-goddess </span>of the town of Bast (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bnbastis</span>), in the Delta, was known<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Basket</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.'she </span>of Bast', while the goddess of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhab </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Kab</span>)<br/>
was <span style="color: #ff0000;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhheyet</span>, or'she of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhab</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient Egyptians originally represented these deities to<br/>
themselves under very crude forms, which recall the fetishism still<br/>
prevailing among <span style="color: #ff0000;">uneiviliztyil </span>African tribes at the present day.<br/>
Thus Osiris of Busiris (Tetu) was believed to dwell in a post, and<br/>
the god Min of Koptos was worshipped under a similar form. In<br/>
