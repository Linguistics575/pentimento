<br/>
Mohammad, the founder of the religion, son <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Abdalltth</span>, was<br/>
born at Mecca about 570 A.D. and at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">age </span>of forty announced <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span>as a prophet. As he found no acceptance in his native Mecca,<br/>
he emigrated In <span style="color: #0000FF;">622 </span>to Medina<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This was the famous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heiilra </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hijra<br/>
</span>(quite erroneously <span style="color: #0000FF;">translated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wight</span>'), the date of which, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">introduction </span>of the Mohammedan calendar, was fixed as 16th July, <span style="color: #0000FF;">P22</span>.<br/>
At Medina he met with more success, and from the position <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofa<br/>
</span>kind of magistrate he rose to be the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a new state. After years<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting </span>he captured Mecca in 630, but two years later he died at<br/>
Medina in the prime of life. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>never represented himself<br/>
as anything <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span>a mortal man, but in legend, which in the East<br/>
has the authority of history, he is invested with the halo of the<br/>
miraculous. God, it is said, created the Light of the Prophet even<br/>
before the creation of the divine throne; and this Light wandered<br/>
through all the generations of men <span style="color: #0000FF;">until </span>it manifested itself at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">centre </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>world in the best of created beings, a noble scion of<br/>
the noblest family of Mecca. Angels, opening the breast of the<br/>
boy, <span style="color: #ff0000;">expnngetl </span>the last drop of sin from his heart<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A little later the<br/>
Archangel Gabriel brought him the Revelations, the Korans, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>were then formed into a book<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mehammed </span>wrought many miracles<br/>
and even raised the dead to <span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span>, as in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ease of his parents, who<br/>
turned their brief resurrection to account by <span style="color: #0000FF;">embracing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ishim</span>. Among<br/>
his most celebrated feats was the splitting of the moon and his<br/>
nocturnal journey (<span style="color: #0000FF;">mi'trag</span>) on a miraculous steed from Jerusalem to<br/>
heaven, where he treated with the Deity as to the number of prayers<br/>
to be offered by the faithful.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">starting-point </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Mohammed's <span style="color: #0000FF;">teaching </span>was the conception<br/>
of the Last Judgment. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Borrowing </span>the conviction of a future life and<br/>
of future rewards and punishments from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jews </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">andChristians</span>, who<br/>
were found all <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>Arabia, Mohammed exhorted his careless <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowcountrymen</span>, who lived merely from day to <span style="color: #0000FF;">clay</span>, to adopt a more<br/>
serious conception of life. Paradise and hell were <span style="color: #0000FF;">drawn </span>by him in<br/>
striking colours. The idea of the Judgment involves the idea of a<br/>
just and single deity; from the beginning, <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>had<br/>
to preach the strictest <span style="color: #0000FF;">monotheism </span>in opposition to the fetishism <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the Arabs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This he named Islam, Le. resignation to the will of God.<br/>
He believed at first that Christianity and Judaism were identical,<br/>
and he desired to bring the same glad gospel to the Arabs. When he<br/>
learned the real historical relation of these faiths, <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>postulated an<br/>
ascending series of revelations, <span style="color: #0000FF;">culminating </span>in Islam<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At Medina he<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to accommodate himself to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">doctrines </span>of the<br/>
Jewish community there, but soon <span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>this impossible he shook<br/>
himself free of both Christian and Jewish fetters, although he still<br/>
adhered to Abraham <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibrahim</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, who was venerated by Jews and<br/>
Christians alike and was, moreover, according to the Bible the ancestor, through Ishmael, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Arabs. The ancient temple of stone<br/>
at Mecca, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaaha </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ka'ba</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>cube<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>became to him an analogue of<br/>
<br/>
