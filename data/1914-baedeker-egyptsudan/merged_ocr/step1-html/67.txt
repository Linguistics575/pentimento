<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>very rarely committed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians</span>, but in <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the kind the<br/>
sheikh compels the whole of his subjects to <span style="color: #0000FF;">contribute </span>to repair the<br/>
loss, and cases have been known in which several hundred pounds<br/>
have been recovered in this way. The result is that there is a<br/>
strict mutual system <span style="color: #ff0000;">ot'supervision</span>, and suspected characters are<br/>
unceremoniously excluded from the fraternity. Nubian women <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>

Egypt are professors <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofHslirn</span>, to the easily intelligible doctrines<br/>
of which they readily and zealously attach themselves. Most of the<br/>
older negroes and negresses with whom the traveller meets have<br/>
originally been brought to Egypt as slaves, and belong to natives,<br/>
by whom they are treated more <span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>members of the family than<br/>
like servants. The eunuchs, who also belong almost exclusively to<br/>
the negro <span style="color: #0000FF;">races</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>very seldom avail themselves of any opportunity <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span>regaining their liberty, as their emancipation would necessarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">terminate </span>the life of ease and luxury in which they delight. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The<br/>
numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>who voluntarily settle in Egypt form the dregs of<br/>
the people and are employed in the most menial <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices<br/>

</span>Most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negro-raees </span>of Central Africa to the N. of the<br/>
equator are represented at Cairo, particularly in the rank and <span style="color: #0000FF;">file </span>of<br/>
the negro regiments. In 1907 there were <span style="color: #ff0000;">65,162 </span>natives <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">St1dtn </span>settled in Egypt.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Turkish </span>origin <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>p. css), a <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">section </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">community </span>belongs to that nation. According to the census <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1907<br/>
</span>there were 27,591 genuine Turks in Egypt, besides <span style="color: #ff0000;">42,134 </span>Turkish<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects </span>from other parts of the Ottoman empire (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Syria</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Arabia,<br/>
Armenia). The Turks of Egypt are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>to be found in the towns,<br/>
where most <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'them </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">government-officials</span>, soldiers<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and merchants.<br/>
The Turkish language is <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>little understood in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

Nile is formed by the members of the various Mediterranean races,<br/>
especially the Christian Syrians, known when of partly European<br/>
origin as Levantines, who have been settled here for several generations, and form <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>inconsiderable element in the population of the<br/>
larger towns. Most of them profess the Latin form of Christianity,<br/>
and Arabic has now become their mother tongue, although they<br/>
speak also French, Italian, or English. They are good men of<br/>
business, and are often employed as shopmen and <span style="color: #0000FF;">clerks</span>. Their<br/>
services have also become indispensable at the consulates and in<br/>
several of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">government-om</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>A large, proportion of them are<br/>
wealthy. The Egyptian press is very largely in the hands of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Syrian</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
