<br/>
Above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">defile </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span>Silsileh the landscape changes its<br/>
character. The mountains recede from the river, giving space to<br/>
the desert, which appears grey on the Arabian side and yellow on<br/>
the Libyan side. The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of<br/>
a distinctly darker complexion than the fellahin of the Thebaid.<br/>
Both land and people approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type.<br/>
<br/>
On the E. bank lies <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afclit</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>At the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Monilm </span>(E. bank)<br/>
we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here encircles the<br/>
island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">s1lunyiriyeh</span>, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">village </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>same name.<br/>
<br/>
On the E. bank are the large pumping-works of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ktrn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombo<br/>
</span>Co. (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">341</span>). On a hill and conspicuous from a considerable<br/>
distance appear the ruins of the beautiful temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kthn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombo</span>,<br/>
especially picturesque by the light of the full moon. The islands<br/>
opposite the E. bank were, perhaps, in former times united with the<br/>
mainland, or separated from it only by a narrow channel; but in the<br/>
course of centuries the Nile has gradually extended its <span style="color: #0000FF;">channel<br/>
</span>farther and farther <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and during the 19th cent. alone about<br/>
20 ft. were washed away from the E. bank, along with a large portion of the building. An embankment has been constructed to<br/>
prevent further mischief.<br/>
<br/>
411/2 M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">K6111 </span>Ombo (railway station, see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>), the'Hill of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos</span>', lies about <span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>ft. above the average <span style="color: #ff0000;">surface-Ievel </span>of the Nile.<br/>
The ancient Egyptian city of Ombos probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">owes </span>its foundation to<br/>
the strategic importance of its site, upon a hill commanding both<br/>
the Nile and the routes from Nubia to the Nile valley. Yet the town<br/>
attained no great prosperity until the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaie </span>era, when it was<br/>
converted from an ordinary provincial town into the capital of the<br/>
separate nome of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ombitcs</span>. It was at this era that the mighty temples<br/>
were built, which excite our admiration to-day; the earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuaries </span>have left <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarcely </span>a trace. Ombos possessed two <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gods </span>the crocodile-headed Sobek (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Suchos</span>) and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">falcon-headed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Haro√©ris</span>.<br/>
With the former were specially associated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>and the youthful<br/>
moon-god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khons-Hor</span>; with the latter, the'Good Sister' (<span style="color: #ff0000;">T-mmtnofret</span>, a special form of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIathor</span>) and the'Lord of Both <span style="color: #0000FF;">lands'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fP-neb-teure</span>). The ruins of the town, now buried in sand, lie in<br/>
the N.E. corner of the plateau. In 1893 all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-buildings<br/>
</span>in the S. part of the plateau were cleared of rubbish and restored<br/>
under the directions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">De </span>Morgan. A marble tablet on the right<br/>
door of the vestibule (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">351</span>) commemorates the fact.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1andiug-plaec</span>, to the S. of the hill, a road skirts the<br/>
river to (5 min.) a <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of steps, which ascends to the<br/>
principal entrance. Tickets of admission should not be forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-precincts </span>were enclosed by a brick girdle-wall.<br/>
The entrance is formed by a massive Pylon, erected by Ptolemy<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neos </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos</span>. Only the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">13</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) half is now standing; the<br/>
other has <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunk </span>in the river. The reliefs show Neos Dionysos presenting various <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the gods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos</span>. We enter the<br/>
