were a simple continuance of previously existing elements of civilization, an advance to a kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">syneretisrn </span>among the varied <span style="color: #ff0000;">eivilizations </span>of the Near East, and the spread of the Arab tongue and<br/>
the religion of Islam.<br/>
<br/>
By-and-by the people that <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>nationally the strongest <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>the most advanced in culture within the wide empire of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">caliphs<br/>
</span>began to assert itself. That people was the Persians, whose <span style="color: #ff0000;">eivilization </span>even in <span style="color: #0000FF;">pre-Islamic </span>days had permeated the Near East and<br/>
was, indeed, the chief factor in orientalizing it. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of the Persian element in<br/>
Islamic civilization, which is so often erroneously spoken of as<br/>
Arabian. If we are to connect that civilization with the name of<br/>
any one people, it must be with the name of the Persians; for all<br/>
the notable achievements of the period of the caliphs, the sumptuous buildings, the works of literature, even the higher developments of the religion of Islam, are utterly <span style="color: #ff0000;">mr-Arabian </span>and, so<br/>
far as they are not inspired by Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">intluenees</span>, are due to the<br/>
Persian spirit. Only the domain of law, so intimately connected<br/>
with the beginnings of a religion, betrays the stamp of the Prophet's native land. The decisive ascendancy of the Persians is apparent enough in the facts that the Arabic language never <span style="color: #0000FF;">established </span>itself on Persian soil and that under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abbaside </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">caliphs<br/>
</span>it was a matter of course that court and government, architecture<br/>
and literature, should be modelled after ancient Persian patterns.<br/>
Moreover, when the separate provinces developed into independent kingdoms, it was the Persian rulers alone that followed local<br/>
traditions, while, <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.9.</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tnlunide </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultans </span>of Egypt could only<br/>
imitate the Persianized Baghdad and the residence of the caliphs<br/>
at Samarra. Even the civilization of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>empire was<br/>
thoroughly Persian.<br/>
<br/>
The transference of the imperial residence from Damascus to<br/>
Baghdad heralded a new era, and the Arabian military aristocracy<br/>
was simultaneously changed into an absolute despotism on the<br/>
ancient oriental pattern. This was the natural consequence of the<br/>
deposition of the Arabs as a ruling caste <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxxi</span>). The Arab<br/>
aristocracy of birth <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>superseded by a bureaucratic aristocracy<br/>
of Persian <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>, the free warriors sank into the condition of<br/>
paid troops, and were finally replaced by an army of slaves.<br/>
<br/>
With these slaves, who were a constantly growing factor in the<br/>
Islamic world from the 9th century onwards, the third great national<br/>
element powerfully affecting Islam enters upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scene </span>The<br/>
Turks, appearing at first in groups of slaves but afterwards as strong<br/>
tribes from Central Asia, introduced fresh traditions and new <span style="color: #ff0000;">forms<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iuto </span>the empire of the caliphs. This third phase in the development of Islam begins with the appearance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seljuks</span>, the most<br/>
powerful of these Turkish tribes. The union of the empire had<br/>
long before begun to crumble, but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seljuks </span>for a time postponed<br/>
