(no hot <span style="color: #0000FF;">viands</span>). At other stations refreshments are brought to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage-windows </span>(bargaining necessary; <span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oranges </span>1/2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">pias.</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
water offered for sale should be abstained from. In most of the<br/>
express-trains there are dining-ears (B. 10, lunch 20, <span style="color: #0000FF;">D.25 </span>pias.).<br/>
<br/>
Narrow Gauge Railways. The Egyptian Light Railways cover<br/>
the Delta and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Faiyiim </span>(p. 190) with a network of lines, which,<br/>
though of little importance to the ordinary tourist, enable the business man, the explorer, and the specialist to reach various remote<br/>
points with comparative ease.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cabs </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">sing.'arab</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yeh</span>) in the large towns are generally very<br/>
good. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">offleial </span>tariffs are exhibited in the vehicles and are <span style="color: #0000FF;">advertised </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Indieateur </span>des <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chemins </span>de Fer' (see p. xvii). At<br/>
Alexandria and Cairo there are also <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taximeter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cuba </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tarimeter<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Motor </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pubs</span>. The latter are <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>adapted for drives outside the city<br/>
except on good roads. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cab-drivers </span>(comp. pp. xxiv, 39) are<br/>
unable to read the names of the streets, while many of them know<br/>
the various points only by names of their own. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">hotel-portier<br/>
</span>should therefore be employed as interpreter. The traveller should<br/>
keep his eye on the direction taken by the cab, as sometimes the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cabman </span>drives straight ahead in complete ignorance of the way and<br/>
requires to be guided, e.g. by being touched with a stick on the right<br/>
or left arm <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the turning, or with the words <span style="color: #ff0000;">yerntnak </span>(to<br/>
the right)<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thimtlak </span>(to the left), <span style="color: #ff0000;">dughri </span>(straight on). The cabs<br/>
usually drive rapidly, so that their use saves time and strength.<br/>
<br/>
Donkeys (sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">hom√©r</span>) are found everywhere. The better ones<br/>
belong to a finer race than the European breed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>Alexandria and<br/>
Cairo they are, however, not used by Europeans for riding within<br/>
the town. In the towns the donkeys are generally well bridled and<br/>
saddled; side-saddles are not always obtainable, and when they are<br/>
an extra charge of 5 pias. is sometimes made for them. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">proelivities </span>of the donkey-boys for prodding the animals with pointed<br/>
sticks and urging them to gallop should <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sternly </span>repressed. When<br/>
a slower pace is desired the rider shouts'ala <span style="color: #ff0000;">mahluk </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0r'ala </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mahlakum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>if a quicker pace is wanted, yallah, yallah, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">m1.el-.horrufr</span>; if a halt is to be made,'andak, hush, or the English word<br/>
'stop' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. xxiv).<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">co </span>Hotels.<br/>
<br/>
In Cairo and its environs and at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inner </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutm </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">corny</span>. pp. xxi,<br/>
xxii) there are hotels quite of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>class, though perhaps not<br/>
equal to the most modern establishments in Europe and America.<br/>
There are good hotels also at Alexandria, Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">82</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%</span>, and a few other<br/>
places. They are managed according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">international </span>methods; the<br/>
waiters and chamber-maids are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>German <span style="color: #ff0000;">01</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Swiss, while the<br/>
'boots' are generally Nubians (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Baribra</span>) who in most cases <span style="color: #0000FF;">understand </span>one or several European languages. As on the American<br/>
system a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>sum daily is paid for lodging and board, the latter<br/>
