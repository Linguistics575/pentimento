</span>feet per second, holds back the waters of the White Nile above<br/>
the junction of the two streams, so that in August and September<br/>
the waters of the Baht <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Gebel </span>and the Sohat are penned up in<br/>
the White Nile valley and contribute only a very small share to<br/>
the inundation of the Nile proper. The rains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinia </span>may<br/>
therefore be regarded as practically regulating the height of the<br/>
inundation of the Nile, and it is their variations which occasion<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fl11etuation </span>from year to year. The region of the equatorial<br/>
lakes has no <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>whatever on the flood.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile begins to rise <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartihn </span>about the middle of May,<br/>
and at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">June</span>, reaching its maximum<br/>
height at both places about the end of the first week in September.<br/>
The mean <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>between the highest and lowest stages of the<br/>
river is 21 ft. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ehart.ilm</span>, 20 ft. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tuh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa</span>, 23 ft. at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin</span>,<br/>
22 ft. at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22 </span>ft. at Minyeh, and 16 ft. at Cairo. After the flood<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bas </span>reached its maximum height the Blue Nile falls rapidly, but the<br/>
water of the White Nile, which is now liberated, prevents too rapid<br/>
a fall of the river below <span style="color: #ff0000;">kharttorn</span>. By January the Blue Nile supply has diminished to a small amount, while that of the White Nile<br/>
is several times as great, and this state of affairs continues until<br/>
June, when the Blue Nile again rises. Thus, for these five months<br/>
the mainstay of the Nile supply is the constant quantity furnished<br/>
by the White Nile, amounting to <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">14,000 </span>cubic ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">per </span>second,<br/>
supplemented by a quantity from the Sobat River and the Blue<br/>
Nile, which varies from year to year according to the amount of the<br/>
summer and autumn rains of Abyssinia in the preceding year.<br/>
<br/>
From time immemorial the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">flooded </span>its valley annually.<br/>
Crops were <span style="color: #ff0000;">sown </span>on the mud flats left by the water as it subsided<br/>
and, at a very early period, a system of irrigation was developed by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the flood-water, with its load of rich earth, was led by canals<br/>
into basins enclosed by earthen banks, where it deposited its sediment and whence it was allowed to escape when the river had fallen<br/>
sufficiently. The crops which grew luxuriantly on the soil thus<br/>
annually enriched were harvested in April and May, after which<br/>
time land in the neighbourhood of the river or where there were<br/>
wells could alone be cultivated until November after the next <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood</span>.<br/>
The amount of water was <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient </span>to meet <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>needs <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'agriculture </span>in Egypt during the months of <span style="color: #0000FF;">May</span>, June, and July.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>recent years, however, especially since <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>Ali developed <span style="color: #ff0000;">eotton-growing </span>in the Delta, a great change has taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span>.<br/>
It is no longer in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood-season </span>alone that water is supplied to<br/>
the land. Several large works have been constructed in order <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>render Perennial Irrigation (comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxi</span>) possible, by storing up<br/>
the surplus water in November, <span style="color: #0000FF;">December</span>, and January for distribution in the later months before the arrival <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flood</span>, and by<br/>
means of canals and numerous regulating works water is supplied<br/>
to the Delta at such a level as to flow on to the cultivated land at<br/>
