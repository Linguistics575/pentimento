<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cession</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>foremost persons in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cort√©ge </span>are usually six or more<br/>
poor, and generally blind, men, who walk in twos <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>threes at a<br/>
slow pace, chanting the creed <span style="color: #ff0000;">-'There </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>God but God; Mohammed is the ambassador of God; God be gracious to him and preserve<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l.</span>' These are followed by several male relatives of the deceased,<br/>
and sometimes by a number of dervishes with the flags of their<br/>
order, and then by a few boys, one of whom carries a copy of the<br/>
Koran. The boys usually chant in a loud and shrill voice several<br/>
passages from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">U.hssEriyeh</span>', a poem describing the last judgment.<br/>
The bier, with the head of the deceased foremost, comes next,<br/>
being borne by <span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span>or four of his friends, who are relieved from<br/>
time to time by others. After the bier come the female relatives,<br/>
with dishevelled hair, sobbing aloud, and frequently accompanied<br/>
by professional mourning <span style="color: #ff0000;">women</span>, whose business it is to extol the<br/>
merits of the deceased. If the deceased was the husband or father<br/>
of the family one of the cries is:<span style="color: #ff0000;">'O </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thou </span>camel of my house', the<br/>
camel being the emblem of the bread-winner of the household.<br/>
The body is first carried into that mosque for whose patron saints<br/>
the relatives entertain the greatest veneration, and prayers are<br/>
there offered on <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>behalf. The body is then <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>to the cemetery,<br/>
where it is laid in the tomb in such a position that the face is<br/>
turned towards Mecca.<br/>
<br/>
Among the women are the relatives and friends of the deceased,<br/>
distinguished by a strip (usually blue) of linen, cotton, or muslin<br/>
bound round the head, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>hanging down behind. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men<br/>
</span>wear <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>mourning clothes. The women, especially in the country,<br/>
frequently put dust on their brows and breasts, a practice <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>survival from antiquity, as may be seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>comparing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>of ancient funerals at Thebes and elsewhere. Rich<br/>
men <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>pious sheikhs <span style="color: #0000FF;">and'ulamas </span>are buried with greater pomp,<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>religious fraternities and dervishes with their flags <span style="color: #0000FF;">contribute</span>; water is distributed; and the riding-horse and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">buffalo </span>are<br/>
led in the procession. The buffalo is slaughtered at the tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>its <span style="color: #0000FF;">flesh </span>distributed among the poor.<br/>
<br/>
Another custom peculiar to the Moslems is the separation of<br/>
the sexes even after death<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In family-vaults one side is set apart<br/>
for the men, the other for the women (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxxiii</span>). Between<br/>
these vaults is the entrance to the tomb, usually covered with a<br/>
single large slab. The vaults are high enough to admit of the<br/>
deceased sitting upright in them when he is being examined by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">angels </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Munkar </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nelrtr </span>011 the first night after his interment.<br/>
