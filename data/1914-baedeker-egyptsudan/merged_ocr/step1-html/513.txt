<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">battlements</span>. Remote from the battlefield, to the extreme left, the<br/>
prince of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIittites </span>stands in his chariot, surrounded by his<br/>
guards, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Years </span>before his <span style="color: #0000FF;">majesty</span>'. - Below the reliefs on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tower </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>long poetical description of the battle <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Kadesh,<br/>
inscribed in vertical lines. It is continued <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>tower, where,<br/>
however, the text <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>still partly <span style="color: #0000FF;">concealed </span>by rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the front of each tower of the pylon are two large vertical<br/>
grooves for the reception of flag-staffs, and above these are large<br/>
square apertures to receive the braces securing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staffs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>loopholes to admit light and air to the interior. The portal between<br/>
the towers is buried in rubbish and in a very ruinous condition.<br/>
The reliefs represent Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>in presence of the chief deities of<br/>
the temple. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">carvings </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the doorway, in somewhat high relief,<br/>
date from the reign of the Ethiopian king <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shabako</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the principal pylon (though not accessible from this<br/>
side, comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>257) lies the great Court of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. A),<br/>
which was entirely surrounded by a double row <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofpapyrus-columns<br/>
</span>(74 in all), with <span style="color: #0000FF;">bud-capitals </span>and smooth shafts. It measures<br/>
187 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in length and 167 ft. in breadth, but, owing to the presence<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>a mosque (p. 257), only the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>sides have been laid bare.<br/>
On a platform in the N.W. corner lies an ancient Chapel (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. Th),<br/>
built by Thutmosis III. and restored by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span>. It contains<br/>
three chambers, of which that in the centre was dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>,<br/>
that on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nut</span>, and that on the E. to Khons, each <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlontaining </span>the sacred bark of the god. On the side facing the court<br/>
it had <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade </span>of four clustered <span style="color: #ff0000;">papyrus-eolumns </span>in red<br/>
granite.<br/>
<br/>
The Walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the court are covered with reliefs and inscriptions,<br/>
including sacrificial scenes, hymns to the gods, representations of<br/>
conquered nations, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, most of which date from the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir</span>. The relief on the S.W. wall (P1. Y) shows the facade of<br/>
the temple of Luxor, with the pylons and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staffs</span>, the colossal<br/>
statues, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>from the right approaches a <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession</span>, headed by the princes and followed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">garlanded </span>animals<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice</span>. (The scene is continued on the W. wall.)<br/>
<br/>
The S. half of the court is further embellished with standing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossi </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, placed between the columns in the first row.<br/>
These, with the exception of one in black granite, are wrought in<br/>
red granite and average 23 ft. in height. The finest (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>a) is <span style="color: #0000FF;">171/3 </span>ft.<br/>
high; the crown, carved from a separate block, has fallen off; on<br/>
the pedestal and apron is the name of Ramses II. On each side<br/>
of the S. doorway is another colossal figure of the king in black<br/>
granite, seated with the queen by his side.<br/>
<br/>
On the S.side this court is <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>by a Colonnade (<span style="color: #ff0000;">PLB</span>), which<br/>
was originally intended as the beginning of an immense <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle<br/>
</span>hall (comp. p. 257). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>is in fairly good preservation<br/>
