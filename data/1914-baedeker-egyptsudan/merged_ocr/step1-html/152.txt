<br/>
goddess Seshet inscribed the years of the coming reign on the leaves<br/>
of the sacred tree. At On stood also the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Obelisk-like </span>stone column<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benben</span>, the chosen seat of the sun-god. The local deity, strictly<br/>
speaking, was, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">astete </span>priests of On <span style="color: #0000FF;">put </span>this<br/>
god on a par with the god of the sun and asserted that he was only<br/>
another form, another name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1lEirakhtis</span>. This doctrine obtained<br/>
a wide currency throughout the country and all the local gods were<br/>
promptly identified with <span style="color: #0000FF;">lie </span>and invested <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the symbol <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">vis</span>. the sun-disk with the poisonous royal serpent (<span style="color: #ff0000;">nrmns</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elxxvii</span>)<br/>
coiled round it. Thus even the crocodile-god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobek </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>of<br/>
Thebes became sun-gods. This amalgamation of local deities with<br/>
Re, which began under the Middle Empire and was carried to great<br/>
lengths under the New Empire, was a fertile source of confusion<br/>
in the Egyptian religion. Attempts indeed were made to draw a<br/>
distinction among the various forms <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Re, Khepre for example<br/>
being regarded as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">morning-sun </span>and Atum as the evening-sun,<br/>
but nothing like a systematic scheme was ever <span style="color: #0000FF;">achieved</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way a number of female local deities, especially<br/>
when they were of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">similar </span>character, were welded into one. Thus<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor</span>, the goddess of the sky, was identified with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isis</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cat-goddess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>with the lion-goddesses Sekhmet and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pekhet</span>, while Sekhmet was identified also with the vulture-goddess Mut.<br/>
<br/>
When the centre of the empire was carried farther to the S. under<br/>
the Middle Empire and <span style="color: #0000FF;">THEMES </span>became the capital in place of Memphis, a new <span style="color: #ff0000;">phase </span>began in the development of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptian </span>religion.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, the Theban local god, who had been identified with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sungod </span>under the name of Amon-RE, took precedence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>other gods,<br/>
and at <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning </span>ofthe New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">became </span>the head ofthe Egyptian pantheon. The great campaigns against Nubia and Asia <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>waged in his name by the Theban kings, temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>erected to<br/>
him in the conquered lands, and the lion's share of the spoil fell to<br/>
his shrines in Egypt, especially to the temple at Thebes. Amen, in<br/>
short, became the national god, the successful rival <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">predecessor<br/>
</span>Horus (<span style="color: #ff0000;">RÃ©-Harakhte</span>). It was not to be expected that the priests of<br/>
Heliopolis should tamely submit to <span style="color: #ff0000;">this </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">weakening </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">theirinf1uenee</span>.<br/>
They therefore eagerly seized the first opportunity of overthrowing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>and of restoring the sun-god to his former <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>dignity.<br/>
When Amenophis IV. succeeded to the throne the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heliopolis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Re-Harakhte</span>) regained the position of supreme deity, and<br/>
shortly afterwards the sun itself (Egypt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aton</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>was announced as<br/>
the one and only god. This revolution was doubtless to some extent<br/>
prompted by the king's desire to put a stop to the prevailing <span style="color: #0000FF;">religious<br/>
</span>confusion at a blow, and to make <span style="color: #0000FF;">practice </span>square with theory, for<br/>
theoretically all the numerous deities had long been explained as<br/>
in reality one with the great sun-god (comp. p. 211). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>and names of Amon and his fellow-gods were everywhere obliterated. But after the death of Amenophis the partisans<br/>
