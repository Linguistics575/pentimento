<br/>
</span>intercourse with the gods, appears again and again, offering gifts<br/>
and homage to the deities and receiving from them earthly <span style="color: #0000FF;">blessings</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the late period and especially under the Ptolemies <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>secular representations on the external walls and the walls of the<br/>
court gave place to religious scenes; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle-scenes </span>and triumphs<br/>
of the ruler are superseded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifieial </span>and other sacred scenes<br/>
depicted at tedious length. On the pylons, however, the primitive<br/>
typical <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the Pharaoh smiting his enemies in presence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the god still appears. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The temple, moreover, like his house and<br/>
his tomb, was in the eyes of the Egyptian a type in small of the<br/>
world. The roof corresponded to the sky, and was, therefore, <span style="color: #0000FF;">appropriately </span>adorned with stars upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blue </span>ground, while above the<br/>
middle passage hovered vultures<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>protecting the king as <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>passed<br/>
along below. Not unfrequently, and especially in the temples of<br/>
the Ptolemaic period, the ceiling is adorned <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>astronomical <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>the gods and goddesses of the months and days,<br/>
the planets, various constellations, and the goddess of the sky<br/>
herself, on whose body rested the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat </span>of the sun. Similarly the<br/>
pavement represented the earth. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilere </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">La </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bottom </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">walls</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>we see flowers blooming or long processions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representatives </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">homes </span>and other divisions of the country, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the river and canals, bringing their characteristic products as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to the deities of the temple. Egypt was traditionally regarded as divided into two portions - a northern and a southern and similarly the entire world as represented in the temple was also<br/>
regarded as consisting <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>N. half and a S. half. The representatives of the N. appear on one side, those of the S. on the other;<br/>
and even in the ceremonial religious scenes on the walls this<br/>
distinction may frequently be traced. The entire <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-preeinets<br/>
</span>were enclosed by a massive <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick </span>wall, the portal of which (generally a pylon) was approached by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dromos </span>or avenue of sphinxes or<br/>
of animals sacred to the god (6.9. in Thebes recumbent rams). Within this wall stood also the dwellings of the priests, besides storehouses and stables, so that the temple proper, like an Arab mosque<br/>
of to-day, stood in the midst of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">complesus </span>of domestic buildings.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to the great value of cultivable land in Egypt Tombs<br/>
were not placed in the lower portions of the Nile valley, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mere </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">elevated </span>desert-regions, which, moreover, being beyond the<br/>
reach of the inundation, were in any case better adapted for the<br/>
preservation of the dead. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span>always had a double<br/>
function to fulfil; it not only served as a safe resting-place for the<br/>
dead, but it was also a place where the survivors could meet on<br/>
certain days and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>gifts to the deceased. Thus the tomb was in<br/>
two parts, the actual Tomb in the ground, and the Place of Worship<br/>
above ground. <span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>The most ancient graves were simple pits, in<br/>
which the corpses <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>laid; these were frequently walled with<br/>
bricks and covered over with beams<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Larger pits were divided<br/>
