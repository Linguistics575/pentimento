<span>W. EGYPTIAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">RELIGION</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">oxli<br/>
<br/>
</span>the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>a sycamore tree <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>believed to be the abode of the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Huthor</span>, who belonged to the district to the S. <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofMemphis</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>while the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nefertem </span>was worshipped in the form of a lotus flower,<br/>
and the goddess Neith, of Sais, as a bundle of arrows. But the belief<br/>
that gods chose animals as their abode and revealed themselves in<br/>
the form of animals was much more generally spread; cows, bulls,<br/>
rams, goats, crocodiles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats</span>, lions, <span style="color: #ff0000;">iehneumons</span>, frogs, certain kinds<br/>
of fishes, ibises, falcons<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vultures </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>all believed to be thus chosen<br/>
by one or other god. Thus the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>was represented as a ram,<br/>
Horus as a falcon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thou</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>as an ibis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobek </span>as a crocodile, the goddess<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhbeyet </span>as a vulture, the goddess of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bnbastis </span>as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eat</span>, Hathor of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera </span>as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow</span>, the local goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">efAthribis </span>as a serpent, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the local deities who were worshipped in the form of<br/>
animals there were special sacred animals, distinguished by certain<br/>
markings, which were worshipped from a very early period. These<br/>
were kept in the temple, and after their death they were interred<br/>
with all honour, while their place in the temple was taken by another.<br/>
The best known example <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this worship is afforded by the Apis,<br/>
the sacred bull, worshipped at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memphis </span>It was black with white<br/>
spots; on the forehead it <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>a white triangle and on the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">flank<br/>
</span>a crescent. Similarly a <span style="color: #ff0000;">light-ooloured </span>bull (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mnevis</span>) was worshipped<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ileliepolis</span>, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">llermmrthis </span>the bull Buchis was sacred, as was the<br/>
heron <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenix </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>These sacred animals <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>connected<br/>
with the local deities; the Apis was thus considered to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'lie<br/>
</span>ing replica of Ptah', the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenix </span>the'soul of the sun-god'. At a<br/>
later period, the worship of sacred animals was carried further. Not<br/>
only were these <span style="color: #0000FF;">individual'sacred</span>' animals revered as holy, but<br/>
also all the animals in which the local deities <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhered</span>. One or more<br/>
of these animals <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>preserved in the temple, and all others of the<br/>
same kind, none of which might be killed within the region sacred to<br/>
them, were solemnly interred in special cemeteries when they died.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">eat-eemeteries </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bnbastis </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beuihasan</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">croeotlile-graves<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Ombos, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ibis-graves </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ashmunein</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, date from this late<br/>
epoch of exaggerated <span style="color: #ff0000;">oitnal-worship</span>. It was probably only this<br/>
excessive expansion of animal-worship that struck the Greeks in<br/>
Egypt as remarkable. For traces of a similar worship were common<br/>
to various oriental peoples, and even <span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>the Greeks and Romans<br/>
themselves certain animals were regarded as sacred to the gods, as,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">c.g.</span>, the lions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cybele</span>, the owl of Athena, and the eagle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lens</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A stage beyond fetishism was reached when <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians</span>, in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>historical period, began to <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">anthropomorphic<br/>
</span>conception of their deities. The gods had human faces and forms<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">wore </span>clothing such as the Egyptians themselves wore. Like<br/>
princes, they wore on their heads helmets or crowns, and, like the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">primeval </span>rulers, they had tails fastened to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">aprons<br/>
</span>They bore the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre </span>or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commander</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>baton as the symbol<br/>
of their might. The deities that were conceived of as animals <span style="color: #0000FF;">now<br/>
<br/>
