body at pleasure, provided, of course, that the latter did not decay.<br/>
Thus from ancient times everything was done in Egypt to prevent<br/>
the destruction of the body, and so to enable the soul to recognize<br/>
its mortal tenement. A prominent place in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">belief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ancient<br/>
Egyptians was taken by the Ka, a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">guardian-spirit </span>or genius,<br/>
which was born with the individual and accompanied him through<br/>
life as a'double'. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ha </span>did not expire with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">protege </span>but <span style="color: #0000FF;">continued </span>to live in order to protect the deceased in the future world.<br/>
<br/>
In the earliest period the dead were buried in a crouching posture<br/>
with their knees drawn up and lying on their left side. In the Ancient Empire the custom <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leaving </span>the corpse <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>full length began<br/>
to be followed, probably at first in the case of the kings<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the<br/>
same time embalming was attempted. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">bodies </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>treated with<br/>
saline solutions and bitumen and rolled in linen bandages and wrappings. The process of preparing the mummy was more elaborate at<br/>
later times. The brains were <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>removed through the nostrils by<br/>
means of an iron hook; the stomach <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>then opened with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nut </span>knife<br/>
and the viscera removed (Herodotus ii. 86) and placed in four jars,<br/>
known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canopi</span>. These were usually closed with lids, bearing the<br/>
heads of the four sons of Osiris, to whose protection the intestines<br/>
were committed. The heart also was removed from the body, and<br/>
was replaced by a stone <span style="color: #ff0000;">searabaus</span>, laid upon the breast of the deceased, beneath the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrappings</span>. Herodotus states that at a later<br/>
period there were three methods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalming</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">differing </span>according<br/>
to the expense involved. So much care was given to the preservation of the corpses that to this day the features <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>mummies may be clearly made out.<br/>
