<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">received </span>human figures, with the heads of the animals in which they<br/>
revealed themselves. Thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobek </span>appears as a man with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eroeodile's<br/>
</span>head, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">rarn</span>'s head, Thom with an ibis's head, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus<br/>
</span>with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">faleon</span>'s head, etc. The various Cow Goddesses have a<br/>
human head with cow's horns, while over the vulture goddess<br/>
Mut (worshipped in Thebes<span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>vulture spreads its wings, and the<br/>
head of Neith of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'is </span>was adorned with a bundle of arrows, which<br/>
was the form in which she was worshipped. Though such a device<br/>
cannot but appear strange to us as it did to the Greeks, it must<br/>
be confessed that the Egyptian artists in their reliefs and statues<br/>
of those <span style="color: #0000FF;">animal-headed </span>deities managed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">transition </span>from the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ani </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mal</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>human body with remarkable skill.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jesides </span>the local deities, whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">spheres </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>were limited<br/>
to particular districts<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>there were even in the earliest times a certain<br/>
number of universal deities, who were revered by the whole nation<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Among </span>these were the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">keb </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the goddess Nut (the<br/>
sky), the god Show (the air), the goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Te/hut </span>(the dew), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sungod </span>RE, a masculine deity with the Egyptians as with the Greeks<br/>
(Helios), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hapi </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bile</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Nun (the ocean); among the stars<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Orion </span>and Sothis (Sirius <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>the Dog Star<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>female deity) played the<br/>
leading <span style="color: #0000FF;">roles</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>These were all impersonal beings, who revealed <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>only in natural phenomena; they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore </span>not <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoniined<br/>
</span>to any particular place of worship, but were <span style="color: #0000FF;">everywhere </span>revered. Only<br/>
at a later period, though still in <span style="color: #0000FF;">prehistoric </span>times, did these forces<br/>
of nature, the great gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">heaven</span>, receive human forms and special<br/>
places of worship. Thus the sun-god <span style="color: #0000FF;">IRE </span>came to be specially worshipped at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, and the divine <span style="color: #0000FF;">couple </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Show </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tefnut </span>as <span style="color: #ff0000;">lionheaded </span>deities at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leontonpolis </span>(p. 171).<br/>
<br/>
Already at an early period the religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceptions </span>regarding<br/>
many of the gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>deepened <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">expanded</span>, as certain <span style="color: #ff0000;">charaeteristics </span>became <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>emphasized. Thus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.9.</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">faleon-heai1ed<br/>
</span>Mont, the local god of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilermonthis</span>, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>war-god; the god Min of<br/>
Koptos, where the desert road across the mountains <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Red Sea<br/>
joins the valley of the Nile, became the patron deity of travellers in<br/>
the desert, then also a god of fertility, whence the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Greeks </span>identified<br/>
him with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Parr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">th </span>of Memphis <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the patron of artists, metalworkers, and smiths, and was thus the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hephmstos</span>; the<br/>
powerful <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhmet </span>of Memphis became a <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrible </span>war-goddess, who<br/>
annihilated the enemy, while on the other hand stress was laid on<br/>
the more attractive attributes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>, who was <span style="color: #0000FF;">wore<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shipped </span>as the goddess of love and joy (resembling Aphrodite)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Many<br/>
local deities were connected with the moon and the sun and other<br/>
cosmic powers. Thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thout </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermopolis </span>was regarded as a moongod, who had created the times of day and the cosmic universe; he<br/>
Was the inventor of hieroglyphic writing and therefore the patron<br/>
deity of scribes and scholars. Above all Horus was transformed into<br/>
a god of the heavens in connection with the sun and received <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
