<span>126 Route 6. PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gillan</span>. Construction.<br/>
<br/>
construction of the Pyramids has been opposed by Flinders Petrie,<br/>
who has sought to show that the initial plan of each pyramid <span style="color: #ff0000;">praetically </span>contemplated the full extent reached by the completed work.<br/>
But more recently Borchardt has demonstrated conclusively that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius</span>'s theory <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>gradual growth of each pyramid is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">incur </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rect</span>, though it requires <span style="color: #0000FF;">modification </span>in some essential points. <span style="color: #0000FF;">According </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Borchardt</span>, each pyramid builder began <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>planning a<br/>
monument of moderate size. In many <span style="color: #ff0000;">Instances </span>this original small<br/>
conception was permanently adhered to; but it not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequently<br/>
</span>happened that kings who enjoyed long reigns or found themselves<br/>
in control of more extensive powers expanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">original </span>designs<br/>
and enlarged their buildings, either by mere additions without<br/>
altering the passages or chambers <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>as in the step-pyramid at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salthara</span>) or by revising the whole original design, including the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, on anew and more extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">scale </span>(as in the second<br/>
and third pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Gizeh). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Occasionally </span>a second enlargement<br/>
took place, as in the case of the Great Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids were opened by <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrilegious </span>robbers at a very early<br/>
period, probably under the 20th Dyn., when also the tombs of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>kings were plundered, or even earlier. Attempts were made<br/>
to force an entrance into the inner chambers, and passages were<br/>
laboriously cut through the solid masonry in order to reach the<br/>
expected treasures. In the course of this mining and tunnelling the<br/>
passages and chambers sustained much damage. Somewhere about<br/>
the period of the 25th or 26th Dyn. these injuries were repaired<br/>
and the pyramids restored. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>they seem to have been again invaded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Persians; and also at later periods, under the Romans<br/>
and under the Arabs, renewed attempts were made to penetrate<br/>
to the treasures supposed to lie in the interior.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>modern traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>carefully and successfully examined<br/>
the Pyramids was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicholas </span>Shaw in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1721</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hut </span>he still entertained the<br/>
notion that the Sphinx had a subterranean connection with the Great<br/>
Pyramid. He was followed by Norden in 1737; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pococke </span>in 1743, who<br/>
gives a plan and dimensions; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fourmontin </span>1755; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carsten </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Niebuhr </span>in<br/>
1761; Davison in 1763; Bruce in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1768</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Volney </span>in 1783; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Browne </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1792-98</span>;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Denon</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coutelle</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jomard</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">savants </span>of the French <span style="color: #0000FF;">expedition<br/>
</span>under Bonaparte in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1799-1801</span>. Jomard in particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>the merit <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>having taken very accurate measurements. Hamilton, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1801</span>, was a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dispassionate </span>and critical observer. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1817 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Caviglia</span>, a bold, but illiterate<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fanciful </span>seamen, was fortunate in eliciting new facts regarding the<br/>
interior of the Great Pyramid, and excavated the Sphinx. In the same year<br/>
Belzoni thoroughly explored the interior of the Second Pyramid. Belzoni,<br/>
an intelligent explorer and accurate <span style="color: #0000FF;">draughtsman</span>, was originally a monk<br/>
at Rome, but when the French occupied that city he retired to London,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">where </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>devoted himself to study in spite of many <span style="color: #0000FF;">hardships</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1815 </span>he<br/>
reached Egypt, where, besides exploring the pyramid, he discovered the<br/>
tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>, etc. The next <span style="color: #0000FF;">eminent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">explorer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>Sir Gardner<br/>
Wilkinson in 1831. In 1837 <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>1838 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colt </span>Howard Vyse and Mr. Perring<br/>
made very thorough investigations and took careful measurements which<br/>
will always be considered authoritative<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1842-45 </span>Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius</span>, the<br/>
distinguished German Egyptologist, made several very important discoveries and furnished us with much valuable <span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>He found no<br/>
fewer <span style="color: #0000FF;">than </span>thirty pyramids which had been quite unknown to previous<br/>
<br/>
