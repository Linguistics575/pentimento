<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clxii </span>VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ments</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or harem (<span style="color: #0000FF;">harim</span>), the middle point of which was another<br/>
open court; and on the other side were the slaves' apartments, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">store-rooms</span>, the kitchens, and the stables. This arrangement of<br/>
the Egyptian dwelling-house was probably the same in essential<br/>
details at all periods, and even in the ROYAL PALACES (e.g. at Tell<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ewhrnartia</span>) the four principal divisions occur in the same order.<br/>
The houses of the 18th Dyn. which have recently been excavated<br/>
at Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Amarna </span>are built upon a slightly different plan from<br/>
that just <span style="color: #0000FF;">described</span>. - The walls of the houses and palaces were<br/>
built of <span style="color: #0000FF;">unburnt </span>bricks of Nile mud; the roofs were made of wooden<br/>
beams, covered with straw or reeds and daubed within and without<br/>
with Nile mud; the columns were either of stone or of wood, and in<br/>
palaces were inlaid with coloured stones or glass-paste. Colour was<br/>
extensively used also in the interiors; the walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>whitewashed<br/>
and adorned with <span style="color: #ff0000;">hright-eoloured </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rugs </span>or with paintings, and even<br/>
the pavements were often covered with colouring matter.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">FORTIFIED </span>STRUCTURES have been preserved. Amongst<br/>
these may be mentioned the Nubian forts at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kubén </span>(p. 397) and<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Halfa (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">413</span>), where a chain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortifications<br/>
</span>closed the roads beside the cataract, and the Egyptian forts at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Kab </span>(p. 333) and near <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Alrriweh </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">236</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, all of which probably date from the Middle Empire.<br/>
<br/>
As taxes and salaries were paid in kind, large <span style="color: #0000FF;">MAGAZINE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>were<br/>
required for the reception of tribute, not only by the state but also<br/>
by temples. The remains of such <span style="color: #0000FF;">storehouses </span>have been found<br/>
beside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">309</span>) and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Probably in no other country have so many Temples within such<br/>
narrow limits survived from antiquity as in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. Most of these,<br/>
it is true, date from the New Empire and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaio </span>epoch, so<br/>
that we have a clear conception <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>temples of these periods only.<br/>
Few or no complete <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>have <span style="color: #0000FF;">survival </span>from the Ancient or<br/>
Middle Empires or from the late-Egyptian period.<br/>
<br/>
Of the TEMPLES <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE ANCIENT EMPIRE, apart from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mortuary </span>temples beside the pyramids (pp. 131, 134), only one example<br/>
of a particular kind has been preserved. This is the Sanctuary of<br/>
the Sun at Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gurab</span>, erected by King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nuserré </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.140</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>This<br/>
temple consisted of a large court bounded by covered passages and<br/>
containing only a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings</span>; at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of the court rose a<br/>
huge obelisk. The walls of the passages and of some of the rooms<br/>
were covered with reliefs representing festivities, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hunting-scenes</span>,<br/>
and country life.<br/>
<br/>
The remains of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">TEMPLES </span>OF THE MIDDLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">EMPIRE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>even<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">seantier </span>than those of the Ancient Empire. Large sanctuaries,<br/>
sometimes even superior in size to those of later times, were built<br/>
during this period at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kamak</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koptos</span>, Abydos, Medinet<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Faiytm</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">fdeUopolis</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania</span>; but none has left any<br/>
considerable traces. All probably fell into decay during the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tro11b<br/>
<br/>
