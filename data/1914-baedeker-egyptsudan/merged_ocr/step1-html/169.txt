<span style="color: #0000FF;">18th </span>Dyn. by new buildings, in which the materials of the earlier<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tsdifiees </span>were utilized as far as possible. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>plan they seem to<br/>
have corresponded exactly with the later sanctuaries, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably<br/>
</span>many temples of the later period were erected on the plans of the<br/>
earlier buildings. In decoration also they exactly <span style="color: #ff0000;">raserhNeil </span>the<br/>
later temples. The inner walls were adorned with reliefs showing<br/>
the king in communion with the gods; the ceilings of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">halls </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>supported by columns of various patterns <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clviii </span>et <span style="color: #0000FF;">squ</span>;<br/>
and in front of their entrances rose tall <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>(p. 121) and colossal<br/>
statues of the Pharaohs.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EMPIRE </span>appear at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>sight, there is but little <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in referring them all to two general fundamental forms. One of these, recalling, probably quite accidentally, the Greek Peripteros or temple<br/>
surrounded by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, was especially popular during the<br/>
18th Dyn., the age of Thutmosis <span style="color: #ff0000;">ill. </span>and his successors. The<br/>
rectangular <span style="color: #0000FF;">cells </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lor </span>sanctuary), containing the sacred boat with<br/>
the image of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">god </span>and provided with doors at each end, rose<br/>
upon a basement of masonry<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">crowned </span>with a concave cornice and<br/>
approached by a flight of steps. On all four sides it was surrounded<br/>
by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">colonuade</span>, the roof of which rested upon square pillars or<br/>
on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Dorie </span>columns, connected by low screens. Occasionally<br/>
this main structure was <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>at the back by several smaller<br/>
apartments, also used for religious rites. Among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peripteral<br/>
</span>structures of this kind are the small temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>. at<br/>

</span>near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa </span>(p. 412)<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and a sanctuary of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>upon<br/>
the island of Elephantine, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has now vanished. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Curiously<br/>
</span>enough this form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">peripteros </span>was revived in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period,<br/>
though with various <span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications</span>, being used in the so-called Birth<br/>
Houses (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mammi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">si</span>), which stood beside the principal temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Phila</span>; p. 367) and were dedicated to the worship of the maternal<br/>
deity (Isis or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor </span>] and her child. The inner sanctuaries in these<br/>
birth-houses also were surrounded with <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, the roofs of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, however, were borne by the curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">sistrum-columns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Browned </span>with heads of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor </span>or with <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The second fundamental form of the Egyptian temple is most<br/>
simply and clearly illustrated in the small temples built by Ramses III. at Karnak in honour of Khons and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, with his two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">companion-deities </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">pp</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">262</span>, 267; see <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plan </span>of the great temple<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anion </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">265</span>). The approach to the temple is formed<br/>
by the Pylon, two large towers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">masonry </span>flanking the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-door</span>.<br/>
These towers are shaped like very steep truncated pyramids; the<br/>
slightly inclining walls, framed with round mouldings, offer the<br/>
greatest available space for reliefs. The towers were imposing from<br/>
heir sheer size, and this impression was heightened (from the<br/>
