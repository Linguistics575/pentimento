into chambers by partition walls. Over the grave heaps of <span style="color: #ff0000;">stones<br/>
</span>were piled or a mound was formed of bricks made <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span>mud, on<br/>
the E. side of which a stele was set up; in front of this a small<br/>
court <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>made, which served as a place of worship, where the<br/>
gifts for the deceased were deposited. From this early form of<br/>
Egyptian tomb were developed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hIAsTABAs</span>, as the tombs of the<br/>
aristocrats of the Ancient Empire are <span style="color: #0000FF;">called</span>; these were erections<br/>
of limestone blocks or of bricks, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>rectangular <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground- </span>plan and<br/>
sloping walls. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">perpendicular </span>shaft <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span>100 ft. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">depth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>or a<br/>
staircase <span style="color: #0000FF;">led </span>down to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>chamber, containing the<br/>
corpse, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>frequently lay in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">eof'fln </span>of wood or stone. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">doorshaped </span>stone or <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele</span>, resembling a false door, set in a shallow<br/>
recess in the court on the E. side of the upper structure <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the<br/>
court or place of worship, seldom discernible now), marked the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spot </span>that was regarded as the entrance to the grave and to the<br/>
realm of the dead. In front of this the surviving relatives laid the<br/>
food, drink, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to the dead upon the flat Table of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Offerings</span>, or recited their prayers for the welfare of the departed.<br/>
After the close of the 3rd Dyn. a chapel was frequently built in<br/>
front of the recess or a regular <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber </span>of worship formed in the<br/>
masonry of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele </span>was then removed to its W.<br/>
side. In the time of the 5th Dyn. the inner chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>enlarged<br/>
and a number of additional rooms added. The extent to which these<br/>
'everlasting abodes' might be enlarged and developed is best illustrated by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mereruka </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©ra </span>(p. 159), which, like<br/>
any ordinary well-to-do house, contains a suite of rooms for the<br/>
master, another (the harem) for his wife, a third<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>behind, for the<br/>
son, besides various <span style="color: #0000FF;">store-rooms</span>. The inner walls were embellished<br/>
with inscriptions and representations (usually in relief), depicting<br/>
the deceased at his favourite occupations<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>hunting and fishing, the<br/>
various activities on his estates, his workmen at work, etc. The<br/>
object of these representations was to enable the deceased to continue his occupations in the land beyond the grave (comp. pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">149<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et </span>seq. and p. cxlvii). The deceased and the members of his family<br/>
were represented by statues, which were placed in one or more<br/>
special rooms (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Serdc'tbs</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cellars</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, generally built<br/>
in the thickness of the. walls but sometimes separate structures.<br/>
These received light and air by means of small apertures only.<br/>
Most of the fine statues of the Ancient Empire now in the Museum<br/>
at Cairo (pp. 82 et seq.) were found in such <span style="color: #ff0000;">serdibs</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Just as the streets of a town were arranged round the palace <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the king, so the rows of mastabas were grouped around the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb<br/>
</span>of the king. Originally the royal tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>large brick <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas<br/>
</span>like the others (comp. above), in or beneath which were chambers<br/>
for the body of the king, for those of his suite, and for the various<br/>
funeral gifts. Subsequently the royal <span style="color: #ff0000;">mastahas </span>were enlarged by<br/>
heightening them and surrounding them with several outer casings,<br/>
