<br/>
perative tone<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the same time it must be admitted that the increasing number of visitors to Egypt tends to raise prices during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">travelling </span>season, so that a larger <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish </span>than is <span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned </span>in the Handbook may sometimes be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
While much caution and <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmness </span>are desirable in dealing with<br/>
the people, it need hardly be added that the traveller should avoid<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span>too exacting or <span style="color: #0000FF;">suspicious </span>He should <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear </span>in mind that<br/>
many of the natives with whom he comes in contact are <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>children, whose demands should excite amusement rather than<br/>
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliness<br/>
of disposition. The native communities hold together with <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>faithfulness, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>of a common religion, which takes<br/>
the place of'party' in other countries, and requires its adherents<br/>
to address each other <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'yd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">akho2ya</span>' (my brother), is far more than<br/>
a mere name. On the other hand, <span style="color: #0000FF;">intimate </span>acquaintance with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orientals </span>is to be avoided, especially with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragomans</span>, who sometimes<br/>
presume on their opportunities of social intercourse (comp. below).<br/>
In Lower Egypt travellers can usually make themselves understood<br/>
in French or Italian; in Upper Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">English </span>is more useful.<br/>
A good deal <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>usually be done by signs.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>the suggestions we have ventured to <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer</span>,<br/>
the traveller will to some extent have to buy his experience. In<br/>
most cases the overcharges to which he will be exposed will be<br/>
comparatively <span style="color: #0000FF;">trifling</span>; but if extortion is attempted on a larger<br/>
scale he had better refer the matter to his consul or the police.<br/>
<br/>
For the tours described in this book the services <span style="color: #ff0000;">uquragomml<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hob</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Turgumcin</span>) may easily be dispensed with, <span style="color: #0000FF;">even </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>those less<br/>
accustomed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">travelling</span>. They are useful, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>those who<br/>
wish to see <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>much as possible in a very short time. Only well<br/>
recommended dragomans should <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>engaged<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>preferably those for<br/>
whom the hotels assume some responsibility. They must he treated<br/>
from the first as servants and all familiarity should <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>discouraged.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dragomans </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>with few exceptions quite uneducated, without<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>least knowledge of the historic <span style="color: #ff0000;">er </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">msthetie </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">significance </span>of the<br/>
monuments; and their'explanations' of them are only too often<br/>
merely garbled versions of what they have picked up from guidebooks or from the remarks of previous travellers.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wish to make long tours in the desert or hunting<br/>
excursions are advised to consult residents learned in these matters.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">teurist-agents </span>also can sometimes give good advice, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>necessary <span style="color: #0000FF;">outfit </span>(tents, kitchen utensils, etc.) may be bought or<br/>
hired through them. - For sporting and other expeditions in the<br/>

<br/>
On the successful termination of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>travellers are <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>apt<br/>
from motives of good nature to write a more favourable testimonial for<br/>
their dragoman than he really deserves<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>but this is <span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>an act of in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">justice </span>to his subsequent employers. The testimonial therefore <span style="color: #0000FF;">should<br/>
</span>not <span style="color: #0000FF;">omit </span>to mention any serious <span style="color: #0000FF;">cause </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>dissatisfaction.<br/>
