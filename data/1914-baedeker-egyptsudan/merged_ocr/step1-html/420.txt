<span>188 Route 13. SUEZ.<br/>
<br/>
Suez (Arab. <span style="color: #0000FF;">swag</span>) lies at the head of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gulfof </span>that name,<br/>
one of the N. extremities of the Red Sea, and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">DEW</span>. of the<br/>
mouth of the Suez Canal. Before the construction of the great<br/>
work of M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span>Lesseps it was a miserable Arab village, <span style="color: #ff0000;">while </span>in<br/>
1907 it contained 18,347 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, including 2530 Europeans. Neither the Arab quarter, with its seven mosques and unimportant<br/>
bazaar, nor the European quarter, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the principal street is<br/>
the Rue <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colmar</span>, presents any attraction. The town has a governor<br/>
of its own.<br/>
<br/>
A mound of debris to the N. of the town, called <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Arabs<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kolzum</span>, commands a fine view of the mountains of the<br/>
Peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the harbour, and the town. This hill<br/>
was probably the site of the Ptolemaic fortress Klysma as well as<br/>
of an earlier settlement of the period of the Pharaohs. Beyond the<br/>
railway, to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W.</span>, are the mud-huts of an Arab sailors' quarter.<br/>
- A little farther to the N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water Canal<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>180), the flow of which into the conduits, as well as its discharge<br/>
into the sea, is regulated by means <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lock</span>. The level of the<br/>
canal is here 61/2 ft. above that of the Red Sea. On its banks, and<br/>
also near the British Cemetery, are gardens in which fruit and vegetables flourish luxuriantly. The large buildings to the N. of it are<br/>
the former English Naval Hospital and the engine-house of the<br/>
Water Works. - To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>of the canal is the large <span style="color: #ff0000;">eamping-ground<br/>
</span>for caravans<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Numerous pilgrims to Mecca, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>from Egypt,<br/>
Syria, Turkey, and Bokhara, pass through Suez.<br/>
<br/>
As the N. extremity of the Gulf of Suez ends in a shoal, which<br/>
is dry at low water, the entrance of the Suez Canal and the necessary harbour-works were constructed 2 M. to the S., at the beginning <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>deep water. A stone Causeway, 50 ft. wide, on which<br/>
run a road and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">junctiou-railway </span>mentioned <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>p. 187, connects<br/>
the town with these works and affords beautiful views of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Atilra </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hits</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>and the range of the Peninsula of Sinai<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.<br/>
<br/>
</span>At the end of the pier is Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t.k</span>, on an <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>island,<br/>
about 50 acres in area, constructed of the large quantities of earth<br/>
dredged from the canal. To the left is the railway station of <span style="color: #0000FF;">TerrePlein</span>. The main street of Port Taufik is the Avenue <span style="color: #ff0000;">Il√©lime</span>, over<br/>
1000 yds. in length, at the N. end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is a bronze bust erected<br/>
by M. de Lesseps to Lieutenant <span style="color: #ff0000;">Waghom </span>(p. 183), an enterprising<br/>
German in the British service, who, after having spent the best<br/>
years of his life in the endeavour to establish regular communication<br/>
between England and <span style="color: #0000FF;">indie </span>via Egypt, died in London in poverty<br/>
in 1850. The large <span style="color: #0000FF;">basin </span>to the S.W., Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibrahim </span>(Docks Station),<br/>
is spacious and well-protected and is capable of containing even<br/>
large war-ships. - The situation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aand-hanks </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
navigable channel is of course best seen at low tide.<br/>
