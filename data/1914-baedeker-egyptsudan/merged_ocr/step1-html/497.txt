</span>ornaments) to various gods. - Crypts <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mu</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ak </span>2, arranged above each<br/>
other in two stories, are interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">also</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>they are most conveniently <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Room<br/>
<br/>
</span>We return to the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>(p. 247) and ascend one<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Staircases </span>which lead thence to the roof of the temple.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">EAST </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">STAIRCASE</span>, which ascends straight to the roof with easy<br/>
steps, is dark. The WEST STAIRCASE is a kind of spiral staircase,<br/>
with ten rectangular bends, lighted by several windows, with<br/>
tasteful <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical </span>representations of the sun shining through<br/>
them. The walls of both staircases are embellished with reliefs of<br/>
the ceremonial procession of the priests with the images of Hathor<br/>
and her fellow-gods at the great new year's festival. The left wall<br/>
presents us with a view of the procession ascending from the lower<br/>
rooms of the temple to the roof, in order that'the goddess Hathor<br/>
might be united with the beams of her father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re</span>' (the sun-god); the<br/>
right wall shows the procession descending. The priests are headed<br/>
by the king; some of them wear masks representing the lesser deities.<br/>
- The W. staircase passes a small room [ situated above the storeroom adjoining the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber</span>) with three windows <span style="color: #0000FF;">looking </span>into the court. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Higher </span>up is a small court with two rooms<br/>
opening <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>it, corresponding to the chambers on the E. side of the<br/>
terrace (see below) and likewise dedicated to the cult of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span>.<br/>
The reliefs in the second room represent the resuscitation of Osiris<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We now reach the Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roof</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which has various levels, the<br/>
highest being above the great vestibule or pronaos (p. 246). At<br/>
the S.W. angle of the lower terrace, which we reach first, stands a<br/>
small open Pavilion, supported <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sistrruu-eolamns </span>with heads<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Adjoining the terrace on the N. is a small Shrine of Osiris,<br/>
situated above the chambers to the left of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle </span>hall and used<br/>
in the worship ofthe slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations<br/>
and numerous inscriptions indicate. The second room is separated<br/>
from the first (an open court) by pillars, and formerly contained the<br/>
famous Zodiac of Dendera (now in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biblioth√©que </span>Nationale at<br/>
Paris), the only circular representation ofthe heavens found in Egypt.<br/>
The remaining portion of the ceiling still shows two <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">heaven</span>. The window in the last room, with representations of Osiris resting upon a bier, deserves attention. - A <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight<br/>
</span>of steps ascends from the N.W. end of the terrace to the roof of the<br/>
first <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>and thence to the still higher roof of the hypostyle<br/>
hall. Thence a modern iron staircase leads to the roof of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos</span>, which commands a beautiful view of the valley of the Nile<br/>
and the hills of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found<br/>
interesting. The exterior walls are covered with inscriptions and<br/>
representations. The reliefs on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span>and W. walls date from the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">16*<br/>
