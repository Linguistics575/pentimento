</span>name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ri'-Harakhte</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'the sun, the Horus who is on the horizon'.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">tow-goddess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>(whose name means'House <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Horns') became a goddess of the heavens. Many local deities came to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">fvorshipped </span>all over the country under these particular characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Finally there was also a considerable number of lesser deities,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">daemons</span>, and spirits, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">exereisedinfluenee </span>over human beings,<br/>
helping or harming at particular junctures, and who therefore<br/>
must be propitiated. Among these rank, for example, the different<br/>
Goddesses of Childbirth, who assisted women and could either cut<br/>
short or <span style="color: #0000FF;">protract </span>their pangs; the grotesque god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bes</span>, the protector<br/>
of the marriage chamber and <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>women in childbirth; various <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goddesses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Harvest, <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>At a later period unusually distinguished<br/>
mortals, revered after death as saints, gradually came to be included<br/>
among the gods, as, <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g.</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Imliotep </span>of Memphis (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cii</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenhotep</span>,<br/>
the son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hap</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Like human beings the god frequently had a wife and a son,<br/>
and in that case this <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Triad </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelt </span>and was worshipped in<br/>
one temple. Divine families of this kind are <span style="color: #0000FF;">exemplified </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pink</span>,<br/>
with his wife <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhmet </span>and his son Nefertem, and by Osiris, Isis,<br/>
and Horus. The theologians of the holy city <span style="color: #0000FF;">oron </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>) even<br/>
created a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ninefold </span>group (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ennead</span>) of gods, at the head of which<br/>
stood Alum, the local deity of the city. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alum </span>was attended by the<br/>
four <span style="color: #ff0000;">eosmogonie </span>deities Show, his wife <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tefnut</span>, Keb, and Nut (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxlii</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The number <span style="color: #0000FF;">nine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>was made up by Osiris, his wife Isis, Seth <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the<br/>
ancient god of Upper Egypt and the legendary antagonist of Osiris;<br/>
see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">wife </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nephthys</span>. The worship of the nine gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">became </span>so popular that it was adopted in many different localities,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>of Atum being taken by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>local god in each.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Human </span>passions and virtues <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>attributed to the gods; and<br/>
numerous tales <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>told by the faithful of the divine exploits and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">adventures</span>. Unfortunately most <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>these myths have perished; <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the few that have <span style="color: #0000FF;">rome </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span>to us the best known is the story of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiris</span>, which in antiquity also <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>one <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthe </span>most widely spread.<br/>
Osiris ruled as king <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>Egypt and the country enjoyed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">blttssings </span>of prosperity. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>Seth, his wicked brother, conspired against<br/>
him, and at a banquet persuaded him to <span style="color: #ff0000;">enter </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cunningly </span>wrought<br/>
chest, which he and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy-two </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplices </span>then closed and<br/>
threw into the Nile. The river carried the chest down to the sea,<br/>
and the waves at length washed it ashore <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Car </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phenieian </span>Byblos.<br/>
Meanwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the world, seeking<br/>
her lost husband; and she at length <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in discovering his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">troffin</span>, which she carried to Egypt and there mourned over her husband in solitude. <span style="color: #0000FF;">She </span>then buried the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>before going to visit<br/>
her son Horus, who was being brought up at <span style="color: #0000FF;">liuto</span>. During her<br/>
absence Seth, while engaged in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">boar-hunt</span>, found the body of his<br/>
brother, cut it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them in every<br/>
direction<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>As soon as Isis learned what <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>happened she <span style="color: #0000FF;">sought<br/>
