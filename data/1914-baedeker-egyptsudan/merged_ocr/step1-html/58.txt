</span>The dwelling of the fellah is <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a miserably poor <span style="color: #0000FF;">description</span>,<br/>
consisting generally of four low walls formed of crude <span style="color: #0000FF;">bricks </span>of<br/>
Nile mud, and thatched with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>roof of <span style="color: #0000FF;">dune </span>straw, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the<br/>
poultry most. In the interior are a few mats, a sheepskin, several<br/>
baskets made <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>matting, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">copper </span>kettle, and a few earthenware<br/>
pots and wooden dishes. hit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway-traveller</span>, passing through<br/>
the Delta for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>time, must not suppose that the miserable,<br/>
ruinous huts that meet his eye are typical of all peasants' dwellings<br/>
in Egypt. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Central </span>and Upper Egypt he will obtain a much more<br/>
favourable impression. The fact is, that beneath an Egyptian sky,<br/>
houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paramount </span>importance as in more northern<br/>
regions, all that is wanted being shelter for the night. The day is<br/>
spent in the open air, <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the court in front of the hut, shaded by<br/>
acacia trees, among whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">branches </span>the pigeons coo. Here the fellah<br/>
spends <span style="color: #0000FF;">his'keif </span>or leisure, chatting with his neighbours and spinning wool from a spindle that <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>turns in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
The poorer <span style="color: #0000FF;">peasant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>mode of <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>is frugal in the extreme.<br/>
llis meals may be summarily characterized as'short, scant, and<br/>
bad'. The staple of his food consists ofa peculiar kind of bread<br/>
made of sorghum flour in Upper Egypt, or of maize in the Delta,<br/>
Wheaten bread being eaten by the wealthier only. This poor kind<br/>
of bread often has a greenish colour, owing to an admixture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">flour<br/>
</span>made from the kernels of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feanum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Graecum </span>(see below). Next in<br/>
importance in the hill of fare are <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad </span>beans <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. For <span style="color: #0000FF;">supper</span>,<br/>
however, even the poorest <span style="color: #0000FF;">cause </span>a hot <span style="color: #0000FF;">repast </span>to be prepared. This<br/>
usually consists of a highly salted sauce made of onions and butter,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>in the poorer <span style="color: #0000FF;">houses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>onions and linseed or sesame oil. Into<br/>
this sauce, which in <span style="color: #0000FF;">summer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">acquires </span>a gelatinous consistency hy<br/>

Hibiscus) and various herbs, each member <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>family dips pieces<br/>
of bread held in the fingers. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Both </span>in town and country, goats',<br/>
sheep's, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">buffaloes</span>' milk also forms a daily article of food, but<br/>
always in a sour condition or half converted into cheese, and in<br/>
very moderate quantities only. In the height of <span style="color: #0000FF;">summer </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">consumption </span>of fruit of the cucumber and pumpkin species, which the<br/>
land yields in abundance, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous </span>In spring large quantities<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ot'lettuee</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">radish-leaves</span>, and similar green vegetables are eaten;<br/>
and the lower classes consume, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">medical </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Purposes </span>during January<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">andFebruary</span>, considerable amounts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feenum </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Grseeum</span>, a clover-like<br/>
plant with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>somewhat disagreeable odour (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxiv</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the month<br/>
of Ramadan alone <span style="color: #ff0000;">o. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">xcvi</span>), when a rigorous fast is observed during<br/>
the day, and on the three days of the great Bairam festival <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ofurbin<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beirim</span>), even the poorest indulge in meat, and it is customary to<br/>
distribute that rare luxury to beggars at these seasons.<br/>
