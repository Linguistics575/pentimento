<span style="color: #0000FF;">rock</span>. The larger temple of Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Simbel </span>(p. 404) is entirely a rock<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">building</span>, the pylon and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">colossiincluded</span>. At Abydos the difficulty<br/>
of excavating the rock was avoided by placing the part of the temple<br/>
containing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">slaughter-cout </span>and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>at right angles to<br/>
the main <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, so that the whole <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>presents the form of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">-n<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">comp</span>. the Plan, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">239</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Although many small <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-buildings </span>of the LIBYAN <span style="color: #ff0000;">Evocn<br/>
</span>and the LATE PERIOD are still in existence, almost nothing has<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">come </span>down to our day of the large temples, with the exception of<br/>
the temple of Hibis, in the Oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khirgeh </span>(p. 381), which was<br/>
erected in the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Persians. Nearly all the kings of that<br/>
period resided in the Delta (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis</span>, Sais), and therefore markedly favoured the North in erecting their monuments. There the<br/>
sanctuaries were built of limestone, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>and modern times the blocks have either found their <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>into lime-kilns,<br/>
or, since the Delta itself yields but scanty building-materials, <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>been utilized for new buildings, usually leaving only the more <span style="color: #ff0000;">lefractory </span>blocks of granite behind. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>not until the days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Ptolemies that attention was once more directed to the South. These<br/>
monarchs raised many large temples to the gods of the country,<br/>
usually on the site of earlier ruined buildings. All these temples<br/>
are built on one uniform plan, differing but slightly from the older<br/>
forms (comp. the Plan of the temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span>, p. 344, with that of<br/>
the Ramesseum, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">306</span>). There is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>in only one essential<br/>
point. The sanctuary for the boat is surrounded on three sides by<br/>
corridors, on which open smaller chambers. This innovation, which<br/>
is seen for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>time in the temple of Khons at Karnak (20th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dye</span>), provided the temple proper with a chapel closed all round.<br/>
The earlier temples were often altered to conform to this new plan,<br/>
and a separate <span style="color: #ff0000;">boat-ehamber </span>was inserted among the older rooms<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. in the temple at Luxor, and in the great temple at Karnak).<br/>
The side-rooms also are numerous at this period and among these<br/>
special mention must be made of a small <span style="color: #ff0000;">8aerifeial </span>Court situated<br/>
on the right side (see Plan of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span>, p. 344) and an elegant <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kiosque<br/>
</span>adjoining it (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ill</span>). Rooms of this kind occur, however, even in some<br/>
of the older temples.<br/>
<br/>
From the earliest known period all flat surfaces on pylons, interior walls, column-shafts, and ceilings were covered with representations and inscriptions. The external walls, the pylons, and<br/>
the walls of the courts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.. </span>those parts of the temple that were exposed to the vulgar eye, commemorated above all the exploits of<br/>
the king, campaigns, great festivals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>other important events of<br/>
his reign; the representations were intended to keep the power and<br/>
nobility of the Pharaoh constantly before his people. On the other<br/>
hand the representations in the interior of the temple were <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclusively </span>devoted to the religious proceedings that took place there.<br/>
The king, who theoretically <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the only mortal who might have<br/>
