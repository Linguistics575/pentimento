<span style="color: #0000FF;">accordingly </span>restored the ancient canal, the bed of which is said to<br/>
have been pointed out to him by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Copt</span>, and used it for the transport of grain from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fustat </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">44</span>) to Kolzum (Suez), <span style="color: #0000FF;">whence </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was<br/>
exported by the Red Sea to Arabia. The canal again became <span style="color: #0000FF;">unserviceable </span>after the 8th century. At a later period the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Venetians<br/>
</span>frequently thought of constructing a canal through the Isthmus, with<br/>
a view to <span style="color: #0000FF;">r'ecover </span>the trade which they had lost owing to the discovery<br/>
of the route round the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cape </span>of Good <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hope</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Leibnitz</span>, too, in his proposal regarding an expedition to Egypt, made in 1671 to Louis <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIV.</span>,<br/>
the greatest monarch of his age, strongly recommends the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of such a <span style="color: #0000FF;">canaL </span>Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mustafa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, the admirer of Frederick<br/>
the Great, Ali Bey, the enterprising Mameluke prince, and Bonao<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pane </span>all revived the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scheme</span>, and the last on his expedition <span style="color: #ff0000;">tEgypt </span>in 1798 (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">css</span>) even caused preliminary works to be undertaken, but the actual execution of the project seemed almost as<br/>
distant as <span style="color: #0000FF;">ever</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">LepEre</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bonaparte</span>'s chief road engineer<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>surveyed<br/>
the ground, but owing to a serious <span style="color: #0000FF;">miscalculation </span>he threw great<br/>
doubt on the feasibility of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">undertaking</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">While </span>in reality the<br/>
level <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>two seas is nearly the same, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lepére </span>estimated <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea to be nearly 33 ft. higher than that of the Mediterranean<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In 1836 Ferdinand de Lesseps (1805-94) came to Cairo as a<br/>
young consular <span style="color: #0000FF;">dive</span>, and there had his attention called to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rre's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mémoire </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">regarding </span>the scheme of connecting the two seas, which<br/>
led him to <span style="color: #0000FF;">consider </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>great importance in spite of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep'ere</span>'s doubts<br/>
as to its feasibility. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>1838 he made the acquaintance of Lieut.<br/>
Waghorn (p. 188), whose zealous advocacy of the establishment of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>route between Europe and India <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>Egypt stimulated <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>zeal<br/>
for a similar project. In 1841 and <span style="color: #0000FF;">1847 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Linant-Bey</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vieeroy's<br/>
</span>engineer of water-works, and Messrs. Stephenson, Negrelli, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bourdaloue </span>demonstrated the inaccuracy of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leptre</span>'s calculations.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ISM </span>M. de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before<br/>
Sa'id Pasha, who was then <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy </span>and determined to <span style="color: #0000FF;">carry </span>it out.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Difficulties </span>were thrown in the way of the enterprise by the British<br/>
government during Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palmerston</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>ministry, but on Jan. 5th,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1850</span>, permission to begin the work was formally granted by the<br/>
Viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary </span>capital was raised, and it was not till April 22nd, 1859, that<br/>
the work was actually begun. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy </span>undertook to pay many<br/>
of the current expenses and provided 25,000 workmen, who were<br/>
to be paid and fed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">company </span>at an inexpensive rate and<br/>
were to be relieved every three <span style="color: #0000FF;">months</span>. Until the completion of<br/>
the fresh-water <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">180</span>) the supplying of these workmen with<br/>
water, which at first had to be transported on camels, cost the<br/>
company 8000 fr. per day. Later, however, fewer native hands were<br/>
employed, European labourers were engaged, and much of the<br/>
work was done by machinery, of 22,000 horse-power in all<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
