government <span style="color: #ff0000;">ot'tiees</span>; but they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>soon doomed to suffer persecutions<br/>
and privations of every description. These persecutions were mainly<br/>
due to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspiracies<br/>
</span>against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries<br/>
even attributed to them the disastrous <span style="color: #0000FF;">contraption</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">frem'which<br/>
</span>the new capital of the country so frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffered</span>. Their hopes<br/>
were doomed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">bitter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">disappointment</span>, and their national pride to<br/>
utter humiliation. Their conquerors succeeded in maintaining their<br/>
position, and though apparently at first inclined to moderation, were<br/>
at length driven by the conduct and the previous example of the<br/>
Copts themselves to persecute and oppress them to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">uttermost</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In spite, however, of all these disasters a numerous community<br/>
of Copts has always existed in Egypt, a fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is mainly to be<br/>
accounted for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the<br/>
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual oppression<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>contempt to which they have been subjected, they have degenerated in every respect, while their character has been correspondingly altered. Their divine worship will strike the traveller as<br/>
strange, and anything <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>edifying or elevating (comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1071</span>.<br/>
It is true that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copt </span>is a regular attendant at church (<span style="color: #ff0000;">'keniseh0</span>,<br/>
but his conduct while there and the amount of <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>he receives<br/>
are somewhat questionable. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">service </span>the Coptic language, Le.<br/>
the language of the Egyptians of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">3rd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A.l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>, is used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">praying </span>and chanting. But as the majority even of the priests themselves,<br/>
though able to read this ancient speech, do not understand it, the<br/>
Arabic translation of the prayers is given at the same time, and<br/>
the sermon is delivered in Arabic. Since the 6th cent. the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doctrine </span>of the Jacobites has been in a state of deathlike lethargy which<br/>
has made even the slightest attempt at further development <span style="color: #0000FF;">impossible</span>. In no other religious community is fasting so common <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christians </span>of Egypt and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinia</span>. They still found their<br/>
creed upon Old Testament institutions<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>show pretty clearly<br/>
that had Christianity been <span style="color: #0000FF;">confined </span>to the East it would never have<br/>
become the chief religion of the world. The Coptic church has not<br/>
even training-colleges for its ministers.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>are no longer distinguished from the Arabs by their<br/>
dress. Only the priests now wear the dark blue or black turban and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dark-eoloured </span>clothes, a costume that was originally prescribed<br/>
by their oppressors<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A practised eye will frequently detect among<br/>
them the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">east </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>features. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Towards </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">strangers </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copt<br/>
</span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">externally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">obliging</span>, and when anxious to secure their favour he not<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">unfreqnently </span>appeals to his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Christie </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">n </span>creed as a bond of union. Many<br/>
Copts have recently been converted to Protestantism by American missionaries, particularly in Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>through the foundation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>schools and the distribution of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cheap </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bibles</span>. Even the<br/>
orthodox <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>have <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great reverence for the sacred volume, and it<br/>
is not uncommon to meet with members of their seat who know the<br/>
