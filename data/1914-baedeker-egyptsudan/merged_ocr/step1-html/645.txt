<span>Outer Temple Court. <span style="color: #ff0000;">PHIL/E</span>. 24. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1mm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">365<br/>
<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">1151 </span>A.D.), the priests of these tribes <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">permitted </span>to offer <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to<br/>
Isis along with the Egyptian priests, and also obtained the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>removing the miraculous image of the mighty goddess from the island at<br/>
certain solemn festivals and of retaining it for some time. Even after all<br/>
Egypt had long been Christianized the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis-worship </span>still held<br/>
sway in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>spite of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edicts </span>of Theodosius the temples of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l'hilse </span>were not closed until the reign of Justinian (<span style="color: #0000FF;">597-565</span>), when some<br/>
of their chambers were used for Christian services. After the conquest of<br/>
Egypt by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>embraced Islam, but in the meantime a Coptic<br/>
town had been established on the island.<br/>
<br/>
The island, which formerly ranked, with its stately temples and<br/>
rich vegetation, as one of the most beautiful points in Egypt, has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lost </span>much of its charm since the construction of the Nile Dam. It<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>between Aug. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vee.</span>, when the water of the Nile is allowed to flow freely through the gates of the dam and the surface<br/>
of the water regains about the same level it had before the construction of the barrier, that the whole island stands above water,<br/>
so that access may be obtained to all the temples. Formerly, during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rest </span>of the year also, certain portions <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ruins were accessible<br/>
(partly by boat), <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>since the raising of the dam (<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">371</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
</span>this is no longer the case. Elaborate operations on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>taken place to preserve the temples as far as possible from injury<br/>
during their annual <span style="color: #0000FF;">submergence</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller should visit the various points in the following order,<br/>
without lingering too long over any <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthem</span>, if his time be limited. It is<br/>
better to obtain a good general impression from the whole than to examine<br/>
the details minutely.<br/>
<br/>
At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>end of the island lies the extensive Outer Temple<br/>
Court, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is bounded on the N. by the first pylon of the Temple<br/>
of Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span>the S. by the Vestibule <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektarusb6s</span>, and on the E.<br/>
and W. by <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>. This court dates from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1atty-Pto1Brnaie</span>,<br/>
period or from the reign of Augustus. Attention should be paid<br/>
to the remains of the strong Quay Wall that <span style="color: #0000FF;">perhaps </span>was carried<br/>
round the greater part of the island, with flights of stone steps at<br/>
various points.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">VESTIBULE </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">NBKTAxnhes </span>was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektaneb√©s </span>as the<br/>
vestibule for a temple, dedicated to'his mother Isis, revered at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abaton</span>, mistress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>, and to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">liathor </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senmet</span>' (p. 370). The<br/>
temple was swept away by the floods <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile very shortly after its<br/>
completion; but Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the vestibule to be<br/>
thoroughly restored. The elegant <span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>structure was supported by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">id </span>columns with varying <span style="color: #0000FF;">floral </span>capitals, above each of which was a<br/>
second <span style="color: #0000FF;">sistrum-capital</span>. Only six of the columns are now standing,<br/>
and the roof has <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared</span>. Between the columns were stone<br/>
screens, <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>6 ft. in height, crowned with concave cornices and<br/>
rows of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uracus-serpents</span>, and interrupted on the E., W., and N. by<br/>
exit-doors. These screens bore reliefs showing King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektaneb6s<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifleing </span>to the gods.<br/>
<br/>
Before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-front </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the temple two <span style="color: #ff0000;">0betisks </span>upon chest-shaped<br/>
bases were erected in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>made <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>sand<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
