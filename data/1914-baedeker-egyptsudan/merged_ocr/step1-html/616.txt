Horus leads almost due <span style="color: #ff0000;">w.</span>, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts<br/>
the Canal of Edfu and crosses it by a bridge. It then proceeds to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>several streets and finally turns N. again for a short<br/>

<br/>
The "Temple of Horus, built <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sandstone</span>, stands in wonderful,<br/>
almost perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian<br/>
temple or even of any antique building in the world, in spite of the<br/>
2000 years that have passed over it. Unfortunately the faces of the<br/>
kings and gods in the reliefs all over the temple were scratched out<br/>
in the Christian period. The present temple occupies the site of an<br/>
earlier sanctuary and was dedicated to the sun-god Horus, Hathor of<br/>
Dendera, and the youthful Horus<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>'Uniter of the Two Lands' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">llarsem-tcwe</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hareorntus</span>). The history of its construction and a description of the entire structure are detailed in <span style="color: #ff0000;">lengthyinscriptions<br/>
</span>on the exterior of the girdle-wall (at Pl. i and k). The temple proper<br/>
was begun in 237 B.0. by Ptolemy IlI. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>I. and completed, so far as the masonry <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>concerned, by his successor<br/>
Philopator in <span style="color: #ff0000;">212 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">B.O</span>. The decoration of the walls with reliefs<br/>
and inscriptions, postponed by the death of <span style="color: #ff0000;">PhiloPator </span>and the<br/>
disturbed reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Epiphanes </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">successor</span>, was resumed in<br/>
176 <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. under Philometor and completed in 147 <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. (under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>IL), <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. 90 years after the laying of the foundation-stone.<br/>
Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>built the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestibule </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">completed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">122 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>.) and<br/>
embellished it with reliefs, and under Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">X. </span>Soter II. and<br/>
Ptolemy XI. Alexander <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>court, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">girdle-wall</span>,<br/>
and the pylon were added, though the reliefs on the latter date <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span>Neos Dionysos. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">final </span>touch was given in 57 B. C.<br/>
<br/>
The temple was originally surrounded by a lofty Brick Wall,<br/>
still partly preserved, pierced by a large gateway on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, in the<br/>
axis of the temple, and by a smaller gateway to the W.<br/>
<br/>
The great Pylon stood in an inner girdle-wall of brick, and its<br/>
entrance was closed by a double door. It is covered on all sides<br/>
with reliefs and inscriptions. On the front of each of the towers<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>figure <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>King Neos <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous</span>, smiting<br/>
his foes, whom he holds by the hair, in presence of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">falconheaded </span>Horus of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu </span>and Hathor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>. In two rows, above,<br/>
the king appears praying and offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>before Horus, before<br/>
Hathor and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>,'Uniter of the two lands', and before other gods<br/>
of Edfu. The four wide incisions, two on each side of the central<br/>
portal, were intended to support large <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staffs</span>, which were further<br/>
secured by means of clamps fastened in the holes still to be seen<br/>
in the masonry directly above. The small rectangular apertures in<br/>
