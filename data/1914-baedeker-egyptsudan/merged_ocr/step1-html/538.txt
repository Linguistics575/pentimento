<br/>
which the staircase is still to be seen, to Six Small Chapels, each<br/>
of which is entered by a sandstone gateway in the girdle-wall. Only<br/>
the two chapels farthest to the W. have left any considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">remains</span>. The second from the W. contains the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenertiis</span>,<br/>
with that of her brother Shabako. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">line </span>alabaster statue of the<br/>
queen now in the museum at Cairo (p. 88) was found <span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Farther </span>on towards the river are numerous brick houses of a later<br/>
date, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have been largely demolished. Among them are the<br/>
remains of a small temple dedicated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philopator </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thout</span>. To<br/>
the extreme N., amidst the houses of the village of Karnak, stands<br/>
a Small Temple, erected by Shepenupet, the daughter of the Ethiopian King Piankhi, and adorned with palm-columns.<br/>

<br/>
Situated to the S. of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IVs </span>girdle-wall (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">276 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>is the<br/>
Sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake</span>, named <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Arabs Birket <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-JfalW.ur </span>or Lake of the<br/>
Salt Pit, as the water has become saline and undrinkable through<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">infiltration</span>. The banks were anciently faced with <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>stones, and<br/>
traces of these are still to be seen on the W. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>sides, and<br/>
even better on the N. On the N. bank of the lake stands a structure<br/>
of Thutmosis III. Near the N.W. corner are the ruins of a building<br/>
of Taharka, and on the bank of the lake is a colossal <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Wanite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Scarabaeus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was dedicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to the sun-god <span style="color: #ff0000;">AtumKhepre</span>, who was pictured in the form of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabaeus</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We now proceed to visit the Connecting Buildings between the<br/>
Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>and the Temple of Mut.<br/>
<br/>
Quitting the central court of the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, we enter a<br/>
court enclosed on two sides by walls and on the rear by Pylon VII,<br/>
all of which are in ruins. Here stood a temple erected <span style="color: #0000FF;">try </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>I. and taken down under Thutmosis <span style="color: #ff0000;">111.</span>, the limestone blocks<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have been recently rediscovered; they are adorned with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>reliefs. Adjacent is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-talle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Karnak </span>Cachette' (now closed<br/>
up again), a large pit in which a profusion of statues of all periods<br/>
was discovered (779 of stone, 17,000 of bronze; now mostly in the<br/>
museum at Cairo, see p. 84); they came from the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen<br/>
</span>and were probably buried here when no longer used. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
exterior of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>wall was inscribed the famous treaty made by<br/>
Ramses II. with the Hittites (p. 272). On the E. wall is a long<br/>
inscription (P1. a), describing the contests of King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenephthes<br/>
</span>(Merenptah) with the Libyans and the peoples of the Mediterranean<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Etruscans</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Achaeans</span>, etc.), and a triumphal relief (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. b) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenephthes</span>, in the presence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, smiting his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Pylon VII, built by Thutmosis 111., whose victories <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>celebrated on it, originally <span style="color: #0000FF;">served</span>, like the following Pylon <span style="color: #ff0000;">V111</span>, as the S.<br/>
entrance to the Temple of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. (see above). In front of<br/>
the N. facade <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>colossal red granite statues of kings of the Middle<br/>
and New Empires; in front of the S. facade are the lower parts of<br/>
