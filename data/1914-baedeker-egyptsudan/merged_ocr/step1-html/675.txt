lay a second temple, which, however, was entirely destroyed in the<br/>
latter half <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">19th </span>century. To <span style="color: #0000FF;">thew</span>. is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedan </span>cemetery<br/>
of an early period, with many <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>inscriptions. On the hill above<br/>
is a castellated building.<br/>

Beyond Tafeh the dark shining rocks advance close to both river<br/>
banks, forming a kind of rocky gateway, known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">BER</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elKaldluyheli</span>. At a few isolated points a narrow strip of cultivated<br/>
land with palms borders the river; and on the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank </span>lies a small<br/>
village. The navigation of this reach is somewhat intricate, owing<br/>
to the numerous rocky islands. At the point where the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">6Ne<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pands </span>again lies a small island, with some mined buildings.<br/>

of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>From <span style="color: #ff0000;">hniarytrn</span>, a small village on the W. bank, a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-route </span>leads round the Bib <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Knl√©hshch </span>to Tafeh (p. 388).<br/>
On this route, about <span style="color: #ff0000;">/ </span>M. from the village, is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">rock-inseription</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dating </span>from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">10th </span>year of King Taharka (p. cv). About <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M.<br/>
</span>farther on, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a small plateau, is the ruined church of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sitteh </span>Gasma,<br/>
built of rough stones.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hard </span>by the river, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>proceed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, lie the ruins of the<br/>
ancient town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talrnis</span>. Closely hemmed in by modern houses<br/>
appears the large and picturesque<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ealkbisheh</span>, built in the reign of Augustus on the<br/>
site of an earlier sanctuary founded by Amenophis II. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">refonnded<br/>
</span>by one of the Ptolemies. It was never completely adorned with<br/>
reliefs and inscriptions; and the reliefs that are finished are very<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">crude</span>, while the subjects of the representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>frequently<br/>
misunderstood. The temple was probably dedicated in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>place<br/>
to the god Mandulis (p. 366), to whom are addressed most of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicatory </span>inscriptions to he found on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylons</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the walls of the<br/>
vestibule, and elsewhere. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>converted into a church on the<br/>
introduction of Christianity. The building is in comparatively good<br/>
preservation and has recently been restored.<br/>
<br/>
The approach to the temple (comp. the Plan, p. 390) is formed<br/>
by a Causeway, about 100 ft. long and 25 ft. broad, constructed of<br/>
hewn stones and still in excellent preservation. At the end next<br/>
the river is a rectangular <span style="color: #0000FF;">projection</span>, below which passes a road; at<br/>
the landward end a flight of low steps ascends to a long and narrow<br/>
platform immediately in front of the pylon.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYLON </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pl</span>. AA), the principal entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-preeincts</span>, stands at a slight angle with the axis of the temple and<br/>
causeway. Only the top of it has been destroyed, but it has no reliefs<br/>
whatever, with the exception of two representations of gods in the<br/>
doorway. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">tower </span>of the pylon has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>groove for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staff<br/>
