<span>358 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">24</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ASSURN</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span>.<br/>
<br/>
and the mummies of a priest and a priestess of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>found on the<br/>
island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hesseh </span>(p. 387).<br/>
<br/>
Farther to the s., opposite the Cataract Hotel, lies a massive<br/>
ancient Embankment, many of the blocks in which were taken from<br/>
earlier <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span>inscriptions. The rock-inscriptions close<br/>
to the stream should be noticed also.<br/>
<br/>
The entire S. part of the island is covered with great mounds<br/>
of rubbish formed by the ruins of the Ancient Town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span>.<br/>
Among some brick walls a few paces to the W. of the quay we may<br/>
distinguish the foundations of a small temple, constructed with<br/>
stones brought from earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>, including drums of columns<br/>
and blocks with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, Ramses m.,<br/>
and other monarchs. From an inscription on the solitary stump<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>column now standing we learn that Trajan was the builder.<br/>
About 50 paces to the W. a granite portal, once the entrance to some<br/>
large temple, dominates all this part of the island. The reliefs<br/>
upon it show Alexander <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">evii</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerificing </span>to the ram-headed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>and other deities of Elephantine. Inscribed blocks and<br/>
sculptured fragments lie scattered about. Close by is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">neeropolis </span>of the sacred rams, whose sarcophagi <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>still to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>seen<br/>
(for the mummies comp. pp. 357, 90). Various other buildings,<br/>
seen and described by the French Expedition, were pulled down<br/>
about the beginning of the 19th century<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Among these were temples<br/>
built by Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III.<br/>
<br/>
The higher parts of the island, especially a granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">promontory<br/>
</span>on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>bank, command a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*View </span>of the black and brown,<br/>
rough and smooth rocks of the cataract, among which the Nile flows.<br/>
<br/>
The trip round the island by small boat, which takes <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>hr.<br/>
(fare for <span style="color: #ff0000;">1-3 </span>pers., 15 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pies</span>), is full of interest<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On an islet, about<br/>
550 yds. to the s., not far from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span>bank of the Nile, are<br/>
several smoothly polished and cylindrical'pot-holes', caused by the<br/>
action of high water. - The island between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elephautine </span>and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>bank, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Airutt</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirdfir</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>Island, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kitchener</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>Island, formerly belonged to Lord Kitchener and is now the property of the<br/>
government. It is covered with palms, <span style="color: #ff0000;">oleauders</span>, and pomegranates.<br/>
<br/>
On the W. bank, to the N. of Elephantine, rises a hill, crowned<br/>
with the tomb of a sheikh <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>360), in which are excavated the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Roek </span>Tombs of the princes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandees </span>of Elephantine. These,<br/>
which were opened in 1885-86 by Sir F. Grenfell (now Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grenfell</span>), date from the close of the Ancient Empire and from the Middle<br/>
Empire and are therefore contemporary with the tombs at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beni..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hasan </span>(p. 227), which they resemble both in construction and decoration. The more important tombs are now kept <span style="color: #0000FF;">closed</span>. Tickets<br/>
should not be forgotten.<br/>
