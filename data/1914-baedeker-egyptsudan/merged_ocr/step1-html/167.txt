</span>column) and supports a capital formed of a bundle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-leaves</span>,<br/>
bending slightly outwards, and held together by bands (Fig. V <span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span>).<br/>
The earliest and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-columns </span>were found in the mortuary<br/>
temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehuré </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abusir</span>. At a later period the base of the<br/>
column was often omitted. - The comparatively simple <span style="color: #ff0000;">plantcapitals </span>of the earlier periods were elaborately developed during the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>epoch, until they almost assumed the form of bouquets<br/>
of flowers, resplendent with brilliant colours (Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vbl</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Besides these <span style="color: #0000FF;">plant-columns </span>other varieties <span style="color: #0000FF;">occur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sovcalled<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatlnor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sistrum </span>Columns have round shafts crowned on four sides<br/>
with the head of the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>(with <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow</span>'s ears), above which<br/>
was a temple-like addition. These are exclusively <span style="color: #ff0000;">tonfinei1 </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">temples </span>of female deities and are most numerous in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic<br/>
</span>period; they are doubtless <span style="color: #0000FF;">reproductions </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sistrum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Clvii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
with its handle. Another curious column is the Tent-Pole Column,<br/>
<br/>
an imitation of the primitive form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tent-poles</span>. This occurs in<br/>
<br/>
the festal temple of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>at Karnak (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">275</span>), where the<br/>
capitals are altered to the form of inverted calices.<br/>
<br/>
Comparatively few of the ancient Egyptian Secular Buildings,<br/>
even of the later historical periods, have been preserved. The<br/>
number of ruined towns is not, indeed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the remains of the earlier houses are almost invariably concealed by those<br/>
of later date and are thus very <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to examine. The remains<br/>
of earlier houses have come down to us directly in only a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">exceptional </span>instances, as at <span style="color: #ff0000;">lllahtlu </span>(pp. 194<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>196), Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Amarna<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>p. 212), and Deir el-Ballis, and beside the valley temple of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mykerinos </span>Pyramid <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>133). These, in connection with representations preserved on the monuments and models of houses found in<br/>
tombs, afford us some knowledge of the structure and interior arrangements of Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">PRIVATE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HOUSES</span>, which in many respects<br/>
resembled the Arab houses of <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>Egypt <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxxiii</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
house of the humble peasant or <span style="color: #0000FF;">workman </span>was as simple then as it<br/>
is to-day. An open court, in which the family spent the day (and<br/>
in summer the night also), was adjoined by a few dimly-lighted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sleeping-rooms </span>and stables for the cattle, while a staircase led from<br/>
the court to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>roof, upon which a few smaller apartments were<br/>
often found. The houses of the more prosperous Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
Middle Empire also had a court as their central point, at the back<br/>
of which, <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>a terrace, was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade </span>or vestibule of light <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>, generally open towards the N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">affording</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>protection from<br/>
the sun. Thence a door led to a wide hall, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span>of which rested<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>columns, and beyond that was a deep hall, also with columns,<br/>
probably used as the eating room. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jeyond </span>that again were other<br/>
apartments (bedrooms) for the master of the house and his grownup sous. On one side of the four principal divisions of the house<br/>
