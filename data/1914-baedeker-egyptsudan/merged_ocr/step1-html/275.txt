(previous application through a dragoman necessary). At the intersection of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shtur </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Siytfiyeh </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shirir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-elalibeh </span>is the rich<br/>

the left, in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shtrir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shekhth </span>(leading to the Place Saladin), is<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gitrnir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shekhiut</span>, built by the emir of that name (1350-55), and<br/>
opposite, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the S. side of the street, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">KhGliillt </span>or Convent of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shekhilh</span>, occupied by dervishes of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kadiriyeh </span>Order (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xcii</span>). We continue to follow the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shtrit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Rukbiyeh </span>and turn down the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SHAW </span>IBN <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tmsfm </span>to the right, in which, after about 100 yds. more,<br/>
we <span style="color: #0000FF;">observe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span>the right a lane leading to the E. entrance of the<br/>
now disused and sadly neglected<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Namir </span>Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuliin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. D, 7; also pronounced <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahln</span>). This<br/>
mosque, the oldest in Cairo but one, was erected in 876-879 by<br/>
Ahmed ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tulan</span>, the founder of the dynasty of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunides<br/>
</span>(p. cxiv). It lies in the quarter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cl-Kabsh</span>, on a hill named<br/>
Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yeshk0r</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupies </span>an area of 30,720 sq. yds., 20,320<br/>
of which are taken up by the mosque proper. The edifice is said<br/>
to have been designed in imitation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kaaba </span>at Mecca, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>without columns, by a Christian prisoner, who, in return for his<br/>
release, constructed the whole of the building of entirely new<br/>
materials (<span style="color: #0000FF;">th </span>not taken from other buildings). The walls consist<br/>
of brick, coated with stucco. The older part of the ornamentation,<br/>
which is in carved (not moulded) stucco and wood, exhibits none<br/>
of the intricate forms of the Byzantine-Arabian style, which appear<br/>
in the later restorations. At a later period the mosque was used<br/>
as a magazine and as an asylum for aged men, which explains the<br/>
addition visible in the N.W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">liwan</span>, below the minaret.<br/>
<br/>
From the main entrance (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>, p.72) we pass through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">outer<br/>
</span>court to the Chief <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ltwtn </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. 4) or sanctuary, and thence proceed<br/>
to the inner quadrangle or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sal</span>", 99 yds. square. With the<br/>
exception of the ceilings, most of which have been restored, the<br/>
building has been preserved almost intact, though its <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitting </span>up has<br/>
been frequently altered. The most important renovations were carried<br/>
out by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ligin</span>, afterwards Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Nanylr</span>. It was he who erected<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mausoleum-like </span>Dome (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>in the centre of the court, covering<br/>
an octagonal basin, on the site of an older hall which was destroyed<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire</span>. The court is surrounded by a double arcade, except on the<br/>
sanctuary side, where the arcade is quadruple, while a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifth </span>row<br/>
of arches <span style="color: #0000FF;">collapsed </span>in 1875. Pointed openings above the pillars<br/>
lighten the weight of the masonry, and the facades are crowned by<br/>
a medallion-frieze and <span style="color: #0000FF;">open-work </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">balustrades</span>. The pillars are of<br/>
plastered brick and have their <span style="color: #0000FF;">corners </span>rounded into quarter columns, with delicately ornamented capitals. The pointed arches<br/>
