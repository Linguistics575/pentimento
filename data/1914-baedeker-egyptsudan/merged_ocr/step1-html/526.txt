<span>266 Route 20. <span style="color: #0000FF;">THEBES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BANK</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>:<br/>
<br/>
the Libyan kings of Bubastis (22nd Dyn.) revived the traditions <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the ancient Pharaohs. A huge court, with colonnades on two sides<br/>
and incorporating half of the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>built by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shosheuk </span>in front of the pylon of Ramses I. Taharka, the Ethiopian (25th Dyn.), afterwards reared a kiosque-like building with<br/>
colossal columns in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span>The temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>now left unaltered<br/>
for some time, but under the Ptolemies it underwent fresh alterations <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>including the erection of the granite Chapel of Philip) and<br/>
received its final great pylon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">No</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span>). Its decay began in the time of<br/>
the Roman emperors (p. 256). - Extensive excavations and restorations have been very successfully accomplished since 1895 by the<br/>
French <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeologist</span>, M. Georges Legrain (p. 264)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>working under<br/>
the auspices of the Egyptian Service des Antiquit√©s<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*First </span>Pylon is still 370 ft. wide, with walls 49 ft. thick<br/>
and 1421/2 ft. high. This gigantic portal, which dates from the<br/>
Ptolemies, was never completed; and portions of the scaffolding,<br/>
constructed of crude bricks, remain to this day. <span style="color: #0000FF;">-The </span>inscriptions on the door of the pylon merit notice. The one on the right,<br/>
high up, placed there by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">savants </span>who accompanied the army of<br/>
Napoleon to Egypt in 1799, records the latitude and longitude of<br/>
the chief temples of the Pharaohs, as calculated by them; opposite,<br/>
on the left, is one erected by an Italian learned society (Feb. 9th,<br/>
1841), showing the variation of the compass as <span style="color: #0000FF;">10'56</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #ff0000;">magniticent*View </span>is enjoyed from the top, which is reached<br/>
by a staircase on the N. tower <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>p. 267). It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>interesting to<br/>
seek to identify, with the aid of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanying </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plan</span>, the various<br/>
columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, and pillars, though at first we seem to see nothing but a confused system of ruins.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Great </span>Court, built by the rulers of the 22nd Dynasty, is<br/>
276 ft. deep and 338 ft. wide. On each side is a row of columns,<br/>
that on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interrupted </span>by the temple of Ramses IH.<br/>
(see p. 267). To the left stands the small<br/>
TEMPLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SETHOS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, built of grey sandstone, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception </span>of the door-frames and the lower part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>walls, for which<br/>
a reddish <span style="color: #0000FF;">quartzose </span>sandstone has been used. The temple has three<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chapels</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of which that in the centre, dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, and that<br/>
on the left, dedicated to Mut, are filled with rubbish<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The third<br/>
chapel is that of Khons; on the walls the king is represented before<br/>
the boat of Khons, which is decorated with falcons' heads, and<br/>
before Amen, <span style="color: #ff0000;">hint</span>, and Khons.<br/>
<br/>
Beside the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span>IL, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. side of the court, are<br/>
a number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>recumbent rams, which were stored here in antiquity. They<br/>
belonged to the Sphinx Avenue of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>(p. 264), which led to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>pylon, and were removed on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">erection </span>of the various buildings<br/>
in the great court.<br/>
<br/>
In the centre of the great court are two large Pedestals for <span style="color: #0000FF;">statues </span>(that on the right retains its base only). Behind <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the<br/>
Kiosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Taharka; of the original ten columns there still stand<br/>
<br/>
