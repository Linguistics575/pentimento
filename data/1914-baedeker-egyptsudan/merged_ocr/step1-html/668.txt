<br/>
Nubia continued to be a dependency of the Pharaohs until about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1100 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>But when the power <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>waned under the 21st Dyu.<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>civ) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia </span>shook <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>her allegiance and a native ETHIOPIAN<br/>
MONARCHY was <span style="color: #0000FF;">established</span>, with Napata as its capital (p. MO). But<br/>
the civilization of this kingdom continued to be Egyptian; and its<br/>
monarchs, who were dependent on the priests, regarded themselves<br/>
as the true protectors of the Egyptian religion and as the legitimate<br/>
rulers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. About 730 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.0</span>. the Ethiopian Piankhi (p. civ)<br/>
temporarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">overrun </span>all Egypt, and shortly afterwards an Ethiopian<br/>
dynasty (<span style="color: #ff0000;">the25th</span>; p. cv) <span style="color: #0000FF;">established </span>itself <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmly </span>on the Egyptian<br/>
throne. But in little more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>century (about <span style="color: #0000FF;">663110</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>these<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kthiopian </span>Pharaohs were forced to give way before the Assyrians,<br/>
and their kingdom was restricted to Nubia, of which the N. border<br/>
then lay near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philie </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kouosso</span>, p. 371).<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization </span>gradually declined in Nubia. The<br/>
Egyptian hieroglyphic writing became corrupted and a native <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mero'itic </span>hieroglyphic and cursive character was developed (p. cxxxi),<br/>
which, about the beginning of the Christian era, began to be used<br/>
for writing the native Nubian language even in <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">documents</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>About <span style="color: #0000FF;">600 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0. </span>the royal residence was <span style="color: #0000FF;">transferred </span>from Napata to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Arero'e</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>422), which lay farther to the S. Comparatively full<br/>
information has come down to us concerning the earlier kings who<br/>
dwelt at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mero√©</span>. We know also of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unsuccessful </span>campaign of the<br/>
army <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Psammetichos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>against Lower Nubia (about 590 <span style="color: #0000FF;">15.0</span>.) and<br/>
of the attempts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cumbyses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C525 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.) to conquer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopia</span>, which<br/>
were foiled <span style="color: #0000FF;">mainly </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">energetic </span>Ethiopian King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nastcsen</span>.<br/>
After that an almost impenetrable veil falls over the history of the<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
During the <span style="color: #0000FF;">PTOLEMAIC </span>AND <span style="color: #0000FF;">ROMAN </span>IMPERIAL <span style="color: #ff0000;">EPocns </span>the S.<br/>
boundary of Egypt was near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hierasykaminos </span>(p. 397), and it was<br/>
occasionally pushed farther S. as far as Primis <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>402)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the<br/>
other hand the Nubians sometimes succeeded in extending their<br/>
power as far N. as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span>, and perhaps even occupied part of Upper<br/>
Egypt. When the Romans first came to Egypt Ethiopia was governed by a succession of queens named Candace. One of these<br/>
attacked the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>province, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>repulsed by the Roman governor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petronius </span>in 23 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>. The Ethiopian kingdom seems soon<br/>
afterwards to have fallen into disorder and to have split up into a<br/>
number of small principalities. About this time also the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blemmyes</span>, a nomadic race of the E. desert, who had previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">acknowledged </span>the suzerainty of Ethiopia, assumed an aggressive attitude.<br/>
Not content with harassing the N. parts of Lower Nubia, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">carried </span>their <span style="color: #0000FF;">depredations </span>also into the Roman territory in S. Egypt,<br/>
until <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>the Romans gave way before them. Diocletian (about<br/>
300 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>from Nubia altogether, retiring within the<br/>
bounds of Egypt proper, to the N. of Phila. The Blemmyes, however, in alliance with the Nubians, continued their attacks <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper<br/>
