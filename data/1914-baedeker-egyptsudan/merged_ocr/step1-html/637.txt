<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rock </span>Tombs<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Assufm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>Route. 359<br/>
<br/>
We <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross </span>the river in a small boat <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>there and back, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">piss</span>. each<br/>
person). From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place </span>we ascend a sandy path, which<br/>
reaches the top at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>The ancient staircase, hewn in the<br/>
rock and consisting of two parallel flights of <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps </span>with an inclined<br/>
plane between them up which the sarcophagi were drawn, is more<br/>
fatiguing. The view from the tombs is <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We begin <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb </span>No<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">25</span>, belonging to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mehhu</span>. This dates<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the 6th Dyn.; and both its construction and decoration are<br/>
somewhat crude. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>18 roughly worked columns in 3 rows.<br/>
Between two columns opposite the entrance is a stone table with<br/>
three legs, which was perhaps used as an altar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the rear wall,<br/>
opposite the entrance, is a false <span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>within a recess approached<br/>
by steps and closed by a stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">screen </span>The representations on the<br/>
walls and columns show the deceased receiving various votive gifts.<br/>
To the right of the entrance <span style="color: #ff0000;">satyrifitiys </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span>made to the deceased; to the left of this are agricultural scenes (ploughing; harvest; asses bringing home the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harvest</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>- Adjoining is Tomb<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">26</span>, belonging to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sabni</span>, son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mekhu</span>. The remarkable entrance<br/>
is divided by a cross-beam into two parts, the lower of which is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">filltyd </span>up with rubbish. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamber </span>contains 14 square pillars. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rear </span>Wall represents the deceased in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">boat</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied<br/>
</span>by his daughters, hunting in the marshes: to the left he <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears<br/>
</span>holding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">throw-stick </span>in one hand and the slain birds in the other;<br/>
to the right he appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">harpooning </span>two <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>at a blow; in the middle<br/>
is a papyrus-thicket with birds hovering about it.<br/>
<br/>
Climbing up to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span>(N.) from this double tomb we pass<br/>
several others (Nos. 27, 29, <span style="color: #0000FF;">30</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>sanded up, and reach<br/>
No. 28, that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heke-ireb </span>(locked). <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the small chamber is a<br/>
representation of the deceased as a negro, with a dark-brown skin.<br/>
- Farther on is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span>. 31, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Si-renpowet</span>, son of Satet-hotep, and<br/>
a prince under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenemhet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. Beyond a narrow Passage follow a<br/>
Hall with 6 square pillars (without decoration) and then a Corridor<br/>
with three recesses on each side. Each of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">recesses </span>contains<br/>
a statue of the deceased in the guise of the Osiris mummy. To the<br/>
left of the first recess is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the deceased, followed by his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">son</span>. At the end of the corridor is a small Hall, with four pillars,<br/>
on each of which appears the deceased. The lines dividing the scene<br/>
into squares for the guidance of the artist's hand may still be seen<br/>
in several of these designs. At the back of this hall opens a Recess<br/>
with good reliefs and delicately executed <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphies</span>. On the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">back-wall </span>of the recess the deceased is shown at table, with his son<br/>
before him carrying <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers</span>; on the right wall the mother of the<br/>
deceased sits at table, the deceased standing to the right; on the<br/>
left wall is the deceased with his wife and his son.<br/>
