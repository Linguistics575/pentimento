<span>138 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">GiZEH</span>. Campbell's Tomb.<br/>
<br/>
connected with it (p. 132). We follow the W. side of the Pyramid.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the rock to the right is another <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span>inscription (Pl. f)<br/>
by the above-mentioned <span style="color: #0000FF;">Me'i</span>, near Which are several <span style="color: #ff0000;">roek-tomhs</span>.<br/>
One of these (Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">g</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nth-ern-pest</span>, nearly opposite the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sm </span>angle of the Pyramid, has a tine ceiling hewn in the rock in<br/>
imitation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">palm-stems</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Our route now leads towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to the Third Pyramid<br/>
(p. 133). To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>of it stand three small Pyramids, belonging to<br/>
near relatives of King Mykerinos.<br/>
<br/>
We now turn to the remains of the mortuary temple to the E. of<br/>
the Third Pyramid and descend towards the E. by the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">causeway </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1'24</span>). Here, on the left, is another series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rook-tombs </span>dating from the 4th and <span style="color: #ff0000;">iith </span>Dynasties. Among these is that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tebehm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">LPI</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">h</span>), with several chambers and recesses. This is now closed by<br/>
a wooden door and is regarded as the sacred tomb of Sidi Hamed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sam'Ã©n</span>. Numerous villagers assemble here <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>Friday for <span style="color: #0000FF;">religious<br/>
</span>exercises.<br/>
<br/>
In the valley before us, to the right, rises a projecting ridge of<br/>
rock containing tombs of no interest. Adjoining this rock, on the<br/>
left, is a picturesque Arab cemetery. Still farther to the E. we observe the remains of a wall (perhaps the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">town-wall</span>), with<br/>
a gateway. - After passing a high mound of <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris</span>, consisting<br/>
of a pyramidal <span style="color: #0000FF;">mass </span>of masonry on a <span style="color: #0000FF;">projecting </span>rock and supposed to<br/>
be the remains of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncompleted </span>pyramid, we come to other tombs<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the left, likewise covered with sand. Among these is the tomb<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wer-khewew </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. k), a judge under the 5th Dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
We now proceed to the left (N.) to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Campbell</span>'s Tomb, a family<br/>
tomb of the 26th Dyn., discovered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Col. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Vyse </span>in 1837 and named<br/>
by him after <span style="color: #0000FF;">Col. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Campbell</span>, the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">consul-general </span>in Egypt at<br/>
that period. The upper part, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>proper, has been entirely<br/>
destroyed, and the shaft (53 ft. deep), at the bottom of Which is<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">torrnr-ehamber </span>vaulted with an arch having a span <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofl1 </span>ft., is now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">uncovered</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The sides of the shaft are separated from the surrounding rock by a trench, which is spanned by bridges of stone at only a<br/>
few points. The sarcophagus <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>stands in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamber<br/>
</span>contained the remains of the royal scribe <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pc-kop </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wah-eb-rg-emyekhet</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>contemporary of King Apries. Beside the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sareophagus<br/>
</span>lies a stone lid shaped like a mummy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>niches in the S. and W.<br/>
sides of the shaft are two other <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi</span>; a fourth sarcophagus<br/>
found here is now in the British Museum. All these <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>had<br/>
been opened and plundered. For a description of the similar tombs<br/>
from the Persian period, see p. 166.<br/>
<br/>
We return past the Sphinx (p. 135) and the Valley <span style="color: #ff0000;">Templenof<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khephren </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1351 </span>to the Great Pyramid and the three small pyramids lying in front of it to the E.<br/>
<br/>
We may now proceed to the E. to the verge of the desert-plateau,<br/>
in the direction of the Arab village of Kafr el-Haram, in order to<br/>
