<span>VII. HISTORY or' EGYPTIAN ART. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chtv<br/>
<br/>
</span>is often used (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak</span>) for the insertion of windows with stone<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tracery</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Beyond the hypostyle hall lies the innermost Sanctuary, a<br/>
comparatively narrow and deep chamber. This contained the image<br/>
of the god, <span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>a sacred boat, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was borne by the priests<br/>
in processions. Only the king or his representative, the high-priest,<br/>
might enter this chamber and'look upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">god</span>'. When the<br/>
temple, as, <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g.</span>, the sanctuary of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak </span>(p. 267),<br/>
was dedicated to a triad <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>gods, the sanctuary of the chief god<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>) was flanked by the chapels of the other two (Hut and<br/>
Khons). Chambers of various sizes used for religious rites <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>for<br/>
the storage of temple property surrounded the sanctuary; staircases<br/>
led to the roof and to various rooms, which either served as dwellings<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the temple watchmen and servants or were used in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebration </span>of particular ceremonies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This form of Egyptian temple, which recurs in most of the larger<br/>
sacred buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the New Empire and lingered until after the<br/>
beginning of the Ptolemaic period, closely corresponds with the<br/>
ground-plan of the early Egyptian house or palace previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">described</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The open court of the house, accessible to every visitor, is<br/>
represented by the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-court</span>; the pronaos of the temple<br/>
corresponds to the vestibule, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle</span>) hall to the<br/>
broad hall of the dwelling; and the deep hall in which the master<br/>
of the house spent his time finds its analogue in the sanctuary, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelling-plate </span>of the god. And just as these apartments in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelling-house </span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>by chambers and rooms for various<br/>
purposes, so the sanctuary in the temple was adjoined by a series of<br/>
small apartments, store-rooms, etc. Thus the temple was literally<br/>
what the Egyptians called it, the House <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>God.<br/>
<br/>
In many temples the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>hall is further separated from<br/>
the sanctuary by one or more Smaller <span style="color: #0000FF;">Halls </span>(with or without <span style="color: #0000FF;">col </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>narrower proportions and diminishing in height. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frequently </span>also the sanctuary is followed by several other halls and<br/>
chambers; and not <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfreqnently </span>the temple proper is preceded by<br/>
two colonnaded courts instead of by one. The particular purposes of<br/>
all these various rooms are in most cases hard to determine.<br/>
<br/>
Though many temples, such as the temple at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lusor </span>and the<br/>
great temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anion </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>, exhibit a much more complicated form than that just described, the explanation is that they<br/>
were not built on one uniform plan but owe their construction to<br/>
various builders. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the descriptions of the particular temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">concerned </span>this matter is treated with due attention to detail.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Occasionally </span>the nature of the site compelled further deviations<br/>
from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">above-deseribed </span>form. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>Lower Nubia the sandstone cliffs<br/>
approach so close to the bank of the Nile that the temple had to be<br/>
partly or wholly constructed in the rock, the necessary <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>out. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gerf-Husein </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cp</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">394</span>) the court is built as usual,<br/>
while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>hall and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span>are hewn out of the<br/>
<br/>
