<br/>
the towers served to admit <span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span>and air to the chambers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">stairrases </span>within (<span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>p. 347).<br/>
<br/>
A passage leads through each <span style="color: #ff0000;">pylou-tower </span>to the outside of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">girdlewall</span>, which is embellished with colossal reliefs (Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">XI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>before the<br/>
gods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Earn</span>) and bears the inscriptions mentioned at p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>. In front<br/>
of the pylon stand two <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>falcons in dark granite. One has the<br/>
figure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>priest in Roman costume before it<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Court, between the pylon and the vestibule, is a spacious<br/>
enclosure, paved with broad flags and surrounded on three sides<br/>
by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>of 32 columns. In this court rose the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span>altar upon which offerings were made to the gods of Edfu<br/>
in presence of the assembled people. The columns supporting the<br/>
roof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>are embellished with rich floral and palm<br/>
capitals. The incised reliefs on the shafts show the king before<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus </span>and the other gods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ham</span>; the name of the king has not<br/>
been inserted in the inscriptions. On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rear </span>walls of the colonnades are three rows <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflarge </span>reliefs, showing the Pharaoh (Ptolemy<br/>
Soter II. or Ptolemy Alexander) in communion with the gods or<br/>
triumphing over his foes, as the earthly representative of Horus.<br/>
The same representations occur over and over again in wearisome<br/>
repetition throughout the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>wall (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. a), to the left of the entrance: <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The king, wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, quits his palace in <span style="color: #0000FF;">order </span>to visit the<br/>
temple; a priest <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers </span>incense in front of him. 2. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>and Thout pour<br/>
the water of <span style="color: #0000FF;">consecration </span>upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king</span>. - These scenes are repeated to<br/>
the right of the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">tPl</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">h</span>), where, however, the king wears the<br/>
crown of Upper Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The doors to the right and left of a and <span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">load </span>to the staircases<br/>
in the interior of the pylon (ascent, see p. 347). The E. and W.<br/>
exits (Pl. c) are built up.<br/>
<br/>
The back of this court is formed by the front of the vestibule,<br/>
which is crowned by a concave cornice. On each side of the<br/>
large portal are three stone screens between <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>columns. Upon<br/>
these, facing the court, are reliefs representing Euergetes 11. with<br/>
pendent arms or offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>of Dendera (on the two<br/>
central screens) <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">falcon-headed </span>Horus of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfn </span>(on the<br/>
others). To the left of the entrance stands a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>falcon with<br/>
the double crown; the corresponding falcon on the right lies on<br/>
the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The Vestibule, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pronaos</span>, has <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>columns with elaborate <span style="color: #0000FF;">floral<br/>
</span>capitals. The ceiling is covered with astronomical representations,<br/>
now blackened almost beyond recognition. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the walls are four<br/>
rows <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">incised </span>reliefs, showing Euergetes <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifleing </span>to the gods<br/>
and performing other <span style="color: #0000FF;">religious </span>rites, such as the ceremonies at<br/>
the foundation of the temple, etc. Above are a row of astronomical<br/>
representations and a frieze consisting of the names of the king<br/>
guarded by two falcons<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Close to the pavement we see <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>aml<br/>
his wife Cleopatra and a long procession of local deities bringing<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">savaifuyial </span>gifts to the three chief gods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- To the right and<br/>
