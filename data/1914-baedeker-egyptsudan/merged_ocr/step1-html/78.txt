<br/>
supply falls below the requirements of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>, and, besides<br/>
drawing upon the supply of the reservoir, it then often becomes<br/>
necessary to restrict land-owners on different parts of a canal to<br/>
drawing water from it in rotation<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Periods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">watering </span>alternate<br/>
with periods when the water is employed elsewhere. The intervals<br/>
become longer as the river falls, and the supply steadily diminishes<br/>
until the flood rises about the beginning of August.<br/>
<br/>
Above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assit1t </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">flood </span>irrigation still continues. About Aug. 20th<br/>
the river has risen high enough to <span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>into the supply canals and<br/>
basins; in these, when full, the water stands for <span style="color: #ff0000;">40 </span>days. At the<br/>
end of this period the clear water is allowed to flow back into the<br/>
river, or, in the case of years when the flood is exceptionally low,<br/>
into other basins at a lower level. On the mud thus left the seed is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sown </span>and a crop is grown without further watering. In years of <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>the higher portions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>are not watered; these<br/>
lands are <span style="color: #ff0000;">termed'sharttlsi</span>' and pay no tax when <span style="color: #ff0000;">nnwatered</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The irrigation is effected by means <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span>: (<span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WRciyeli</span>', or<br/>
large wheels (rarely exceeding 30 ft. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">diameter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, turned by cattle<br/>
or buffaloes, and sometimes by camels, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">SCOOPS </span>or<br/>
buckets (<span style="color: #0000FF;">gammy </span>of wood or clay, resembling a dredging-machine.<br/>
L2) <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'8hidtf</span>, an apparatus resembling an ordinary'well-sweep'<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>with bucket and <span style="color: #ff0000;">connter-weight</span>), set in motion by one person only,<br/>
and drawing the water in buckets resembling baskets in appearance; as a substitute for <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">siliiyeh </span>several <span style="color: #ff0000;">shiiltifs </span>are sometimes arranged one above the other. (3) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Whewit </span>is possible to store<br/>
the water in reservoirs above the level of the land to be watered,<br/>
it is allowed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow </span>the fields whenever required. This is the<br/>
only method available in the oases, where fortunately the springs<br/>
rise with such force as to admit of their being easily dammed up<br/>
at a <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffieiently </span>high level. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>) Pumps <span style="color: #0000FF;">driven </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>steam are used also,<br/>
particularly when <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large supply of water is required, as in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ease<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-plantations </span>on the banks (gefs) of the Nile in the N.<br/>
part of Upper Egypt, where they are seen in great numbers. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>5) The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Tiibiit</span>', a peculiar, very light, and easily moved wooden wheel,<br/>
which raises the water by means of numerous compartments in the<br/>
hollow felloes, is used mainly in the Lower Delta in places where<br/>
the level of the water in the canals remains nearly the same. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Archimedean </span>screws also are found in the Delta, and in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Faiyt1m<br/>
</span>there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">undershot </span>water-wheels. Occasionally irrigation is <span style="color: #0000FF;">effected<br/>
</span>by means of a basket (<span style="color: #0000FF;">nugget</span>) slung on a rope between two labourers.<br/>
In order to distribute the water equally over <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>fields, these are<br/>
sometimes divided into a number of small squares by means of<br/>
embankments of earth, a few inches in height, which, owing to the<br/>
great plasticity of the Nile mud, are easily opened or closed so as to<br/>
regulate the height of the water within them. The efforts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">government </span>as mentioned on p. lxvi are directed towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">emancipation </span>of agriculture from dependence upon the inundation<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
