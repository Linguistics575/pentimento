The cubic content of the masonry, deducting the foundation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock<br/>
</span>in the interior, as well as the hollow chambers, was formerly no less<br/>
than <span style="color: #ff0000;">3,277,000 </span>cubic yards and it still amounts to 3,057,000 cubic<br/>
yards. In round numbers, the stupendous structure covers an area<br/>
of nearly thirteen acres. The material of which it is constructed<br/>
is yellowish limestone quarried in the vicinity and containing<br/>
numerous fossils, chiefly <span style="color: #0000FF;">nummulites </span>(p. 116). The outer covering<br/>
was formed of blocks of a finer white limestone, which was obtained<br/>
from the quarries at <span style="color: #0000FF;">ana </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>170) and other parts of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohattam</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Construction </span>of the Great Pyramid. According to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Borehardth</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>theory<br/>
this pyramid was not built on a single homogeneous <span style="color: #0000FF;">plan </span>(p. 126)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It<br/>
was originally designed to contain only one sloping corridor hewn in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rocky </span>ground (a r) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">leading </span>through an <span style="color: #ff0000;">anteehamher </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">l</span>) to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tombcbamher </span>(t). But before this design <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>completely carried out it was<br/>
exchanged for a more comprehensive plan, involving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of<br/>
another chamber, now called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">queen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>Chamber <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">g</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">reached </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corridor </span>marked <span style="color: #ff0000;">eef</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bat </span>even this <span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span>not <span style="color: #ff0000;">flntrl</span>, for Kheops undertook<br/>
another <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>greater extension, resulting in the construction of the Great<br/>
Hall (h) <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">King</span>'s Chamber (k)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ASCENT </span>of the Pyramid, though fatiguing, is perfectly safe.<br/>
The traveller selects two of the importunate <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>124) and<br/>
proceeds to the N.E. corner of the pyramid where the ascent usually<br/>
begins. Assisted by the two <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, one holding each hand, and,<br/>
if desired, by a third (no extra payment) who pushes behind, the<br/>
traveller begins the ascent of the steps, which are each about 3 ft.<br/>
high. The strong and active attendants assist the traveller to mount<br/>
by pushing, pulling, and supporting him, and will <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarcely </span>allow<br/>
him a moment's rest until the top is reached. As, however, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unwanted </span>exertion is fatiguing<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the traveller should insist on resting<br/>
as often as he feels inclined<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Uskut </span>walla <span style="color: #ff0000;">mt </span>fish <span style="color: #ff0000;">baltshtsh</span>' (be quiet,<br/>
or you shall have no fee) is a sentence <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>may often <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>employed with advantage. All requests for <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish </span>should <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>refused,<br/>
and it is as well to keep an eye <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>one's pockets. - The ascent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>be made in 10-15 min. but, in hot weather especially, the<br/>
traveller is recommended to take nearly double that time, in order<br/>
to avoid the discomfort of arriving breathless and heated at the<br/>
summit. The space at the top at present is about 12 yds. square,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>that there is abundant room for a large party of visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Irrrrw </span>is remarkably interesting and striking. There is<br/>
perhaps no other prospect in the world in which life and death,<br/>
fertility and desolation, are seen in so close juxtaposition and in<br/>
such marked contrast. To the W., <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, and N.W. extend yellowish<br/>
brown tracts of sand, interspersed with barren <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs</span>. The huge<br/>
