The dress ol' the Egyptian peasant calls for little remark, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eshecially </span>as he usually works in the fields divested of everything except<br/>
a scanty apron. The chief articles of his wardrobe at other times<br/>
are an indigo-dyed cotton shirt (<span style="color: #ff0000;">lcamis</span>), a pair of short and wide cotton<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">breeches</span>, a kind of cloak of brown, home-spun goats' wool (<span style="color: #ff0000;">'abc'tyeh</span>),<br/>
or simply <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>blanket of sheep's wool (<span style="color: #0000FF;">himm</span>), and lastly a <span style="color: #ff0000;">closefitting </span>felt <span style="color: #0000FF;">skull-cap </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">libdehi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">barefooted</span>, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">oceasionnlly </span>wears pointed red (<span style="color: #ff0000;">markttb</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>broad yellow shoes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">balghd</span>).<br/>
The sheikhs and wealthier peasants wear wide, black woollen <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloaks<br/>
</span>and the thick red'Tunisian' fez (<span style="color: #ff0000;">turbzish</span>) with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">blue </span>silk tassel,<br/>
round which they coil a turban <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'imma</span>; usually white). They <span style="color: #0000FF;">USUally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">carry </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>long and thick stick (<span style="color: #ff0000;">n√©bat</span>), made <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ash </span>imported from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Uaramania</span>. All watchmen carry similar sticks as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>badge of <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The sole wealth of Egypt is derived from its agriculture, and to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellahiu </span>alone is committed the important task of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tilling </span>the soil.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">They </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span>, indeed, neither fitted <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>inclined for other work, a circumstance which proves how completely the settled character of the<br/>
ancient Egyptians has predominated over the restless Arabian blood,<br/>
which has been largely infused into the native population ever since<br/>
the valley of the Nile was conquered by the armies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
ancient Egyptian racial type has been preserved in extraordinary<br/>
purity in many fellah families, especially in Upper Egypt. This is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span>evident in the case <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the children and women, whose<br/>
features are not concealed <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>distorted by veils (which the ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>despised). Even among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Is</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">between</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>and second cataracts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">faces </span>occur that might almost lead us<br/>
to think that some <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the pictures <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the period of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohl </span>Pharaohs<br/>
had come to life and stood <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>us in <span style="color: #0000FF;">ilesh </span>and blood. In Lower<br/>
Egypt, and especially in the Delta, the Semitic type has <span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes<br/>
</span>prevailed over the African in <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence </span>of the steady stream <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arab </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">immigration </span>that has now been flowing <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>than <span style="color: #0000FF;">athousand<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">years</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>Egyptians, moreover, resemble the ancient in<br/>
character and in the lot to <span style="color: #ff0000;">whiuh </span>they are condemned. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>ancient<br/>
times <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah</span>, pressed into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">service </span>of the priests and the<br/>
princes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>compelled to yield up to them the fruits of his toil,<br/>
and his position is <span style="color: #0000FF;">nearly </span>the same at the present <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">save </span>that the<br/>
names of his masters are changed, and he has obtained some relief<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">owing </span>to the almost entire abolition of compulsory work.<br/>
<br/>
In early life the Egyptian peasant is remarkably docile, active,<br/>
and intelligent, but at a later period this freshness and <span style="color: #0000FF;">buoyancy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">crushed </span>out of him by <span style="color: #ff0000;">care </span>and poverty and his never-ceasing task<br/>
of tilling the pitcher of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Danaides</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lle </span>ploughs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">maps</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tails<br/>
</span>and amasses, but he cannot with <span style="color: #0000FF;">certainty </span>regard his crops as his<br/>
own, and the hardly earned <span style="color: #0000FF;">piastre </span>is too frequently wrested from<br/>
him. His character, therefore, becomes like that <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofa </span>gifted child<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>who has been harshly used and brought up to <span style="color: #0000FF;">domestic </span>slavery, but<br/>
at length perceives that he has been treated <span style="color: #0000FF;">with</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>injustice, and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
