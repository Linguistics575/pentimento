tombs, and of a few special temples (notably the temples of Deir<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Bahri </span>and Luxor and the temple of Sethos at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Genuine<br/>
</span>art-works, it is true, are but thinly sown in Egypt, and, owing to<br/>
the enormous mass of sculpture that has been preserved, it is perhaps more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>in this than in any other branch of art for any<br/>
one but an expert to discriminate the good and artistically worthy<br/>
from the inferior and mechanical; and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieulty </span>is increased<br/>
by the Get that even the best artists were unable to emancipate<br/>
themselves from certain traditional peculiarities of representation.<br/>
<br/>
Our unbounded admiration is commanded by the wonderful skill<br/>
with which both artisan and artist could work the hardest stone<br/>
with comparatively primitive tools. This extraordinary technical<br/>
skill is apparent in all the productions of Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculpture </span>But<br/>
the qualities that <span style="color: #0000FF;">differentiate </span>the genuine works of art from the<br/>
others are an admirable fidelity in portraiture and a charming <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sym-pathy </span>with nature, which is specially apparent in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representation </span>of animals<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

Statues. We possess specimens of the art of even the <span style="color: #0000FF;">EARLIEST<br/>
</span>PERIOD of Egyptian history in the shape of primitive <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of men<br/>
and animals, mostly carved in bone or ivory, some of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>(especially<br/>
among the animal <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>) display a high degree of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finish</span>. The<br/>
statues dating from the end of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">2nd </span>Dyn. and the beginning of<br/>
the ANCIENT EMPIRE already possess <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>the merits of Egyptian<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mrscnlpture</span>, though they still show traces of archaic stiffness. They<br/>
are mostly seated <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of moderate size, with a constrained arrangement of the limbs; the right hand usually rests on the breast,<br/>
the left hand upon the thigh. When an <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>occurs it is usually given in relief. But the facial features even in these primitive<br/>
works are handled with a portrait-like firmness.<br/>
<br/>
In all Egyptian statues the head and trunk are carved with a<br/>
strict regard to symmetry, the only freedom ever taken being in the<br/>
