</span>L Architecture.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>Egyptian architectural monuments dating from the prehistoric period or from the earliest dynasties unfortunately little<br/>
has been preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>very little compared with what remains of the<br/>
buildings of the period extending from the Ancient Empire to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Graaeo-Roman </span>epoch. The remains that do exist are <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohieily </span>tombs,<br/>
of clay or of sun-dried bricks of Nile mud, materials which were<br/>
used also for houses and temples of the period. For the roof-supports, and frequently for the roofs also, round trunks of palms were<br/>
used. In many other cases the chambers were covered with <span style="color: #ff0000;">barrelvaulting</span>. - Stone began to be used for tombs and temples at the<br/>
beginning of the Ancient Empire, but brick never ceased to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he<br/>
</span>the characteristic building-material of Egypt. The characteristic<br/>
Egyptian architectural members, such as the concave cornice<br/>
(cavetto) and the round moulding (<span style="color: #0000FF;">torus </span>or roll), had their origin<br/>
in the primitive structures of wattle-and-daub, and the form of the<br/>
circular Column was borrowed from the wooden supports used in<br/>
brick buildings. The square Pier or Pillar, on the other hand, came<br/>
into existence with architecture in stone.<br/>
<br/>
Piers are first met with in tombs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire</span>. Their<br/>
lateral surfaces <span style="color: #0000FF;">arty </span>frequently occupied by reliefs or inscriptions<br/>
and their fronts by other ornamental designs. Thus tall <span style="color: #0000FF;">Papyrus'plants </span>and lilies occur on piers of the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III. at<br/>
Karnak (p. 274), and a sistrum (a rattle used by women) with a head<br/>
of Hathor at Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Simbel </span>(p. 409). The four-sided pier was converted into an octagonal or sixteen-sided pillar by bevelling <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>the<br/>
corners, part of the pier, however, being left square at the top so<br/>
as to blend with the roof; at the foot was a round, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cushion-like<br/>
</span>base. By grooving or <span style="color: #ff0000;">iluting </span>the flat surfaces of the pillar a play of<br/>
light and shade was obtained. Sixteen-sided fluted pillars, which<br/>
have received the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Dorie </span>Columns (Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>), occur in<br/>
tombs of the Middle Empire (at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benihasan </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">As-min</span>) and in<br/>
temples of the time of Thutmosis Ill. (Karnak, p. 277; Deir <span style="color: #ff0000;">elBahri</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">30</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0</span>. The name was suggested by certain points <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">resemblame </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>columns of the Greeks, the chief of which are<br/>
the marked <span style="color: #ff0000;">ilutitrg </span>and the tapering; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Dori</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">differs<br/>
</span>from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Greek </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dorie </span>in being destitute of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'eehinus</span>', a member<br/>
resembling an overhanging wreath of leaves, forming the capital<br/>
of the true <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>column. The chief difference, however, is that<br/>
the shaft of the Egyptian column rests <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>a base, while the<br/>
Dorie column springs immediately from the ground. Another<br/>
difference is that some of the sides of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Dorie </span>column are<br/>
frequently <span style="color: #ff0000;">twfluted </span>and left <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>for the reception of inscriptions.<br/>
