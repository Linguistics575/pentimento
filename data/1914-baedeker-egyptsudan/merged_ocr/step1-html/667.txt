the W. bank, the desert advances clear up to the river-brink. The<br/>
population is in consequence very scanty, viz. <span style="color: #ff0000;">96,500 </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1897</span>.<br/>
Comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.11</span>. - All the countries on the Upper Nile, from the<br/>
borders <span style="color: #ff0000;">ongypt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">southwards</span>, were included by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians<br/>
</span>under the single name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kosh</span>, the Cash of the Bible. The Greeks<br/>
and Romans called them Ethiopia. Lower Nubia was more particularly<br/>
known to the Egyptians as the land of Scti and consisted, as it does<br/>
to-day, of a number of separate districts (<span style="color: #ff0000;">e.g</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Weird</span>).<br/>
The present inhabitants of Nubia are more faithful to their ancient<br/>
manners and customs than the Egyptians. When the huge <span style="color: #ff0000;">storagelake</span>, extending far into Northern Nubia, was formed by the dam at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin</span>, the villages within its basin were either deserted or <span style="color: #0000FF;">removed </span>to the heights. This fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">accounts </span>for the numerous ruined<br/>
villages seen under water or on the edge of the lake (comp. p. 384).<br/>
<br/>
History. Lower Nubia, whence the Egyptians procured their<br/>
supplies <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">incense </span>and other products of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sedan</span>, is mentioned<br/>
in some of the earliest Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">texts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Its relations with Egypt were<br/>
still closer under the kings of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">6th </span>Dyn., who there enlisted negro<br/>
mercenaries, while the princes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>dispatched great<br/>
trading expeditions to the lands of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span>Nile. But it was not<br/>
until the period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">12th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn</span>. that the conquest <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia </span>was<br/>
undertaken and the borders of Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">advanced </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semneh </span>(p. 413).<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>order to guard the newly acquired possessions against the attacks<br/>
of the negroes a chain of forts was erected in the rocky valley of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Batu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ol-Oat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">dill</span>), with its numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">cataracts</span>, between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haifa </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Semneh</span>. From this base the Pharaohs of the 18th Dyn. penetrated<br/>
still farther to the S. and made themselves masters of the land of<br/>
Kosh as far as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Napata </span>(p. 419), which then became the southernmost<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">city </span>of the empire. The conquered regions were <span style="color: #0000FF;">incorporated </span>with<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">southernmost </span>department <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt </span>proper, which began at <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Eib<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">333</span>), and the whole of the great province thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">formed </span>was placed<br/>
under an <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>who bore the title <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Prince </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kosh </span>and Governor<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southern </span>Lands'. Under the established rule of Egypt Nubia<br/>
rapidly prospered; new towns were founded, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>temples,<br/>
little inferior <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>size and embellishment to those of the motherland,<br/>
arose in profusion, especially on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hank </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the Nile, which<br/>
was safer from the attacks of the E. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>. Most of these temples<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>ere dedicated to the great Egyptian gods, Amen, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ré-liarakhte</span>,<br/>
and Ptah; but in some of them other deities also were worshipped,<br/>
such <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>Isis and others of the Egyptian gods, the local Nubian god<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Teiun</span>, the deceased King Sesostris 111., who united the <span style="color: #ff0000;">réles </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">first </span>conqueror and patron-saint of Nubia<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and occasionally also the<br/>
reigning king and queen (<span style="color: #ff0000;">pp</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">305</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">398</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dog</span>, 408, <span style="color: #ff0000;">409</span>). The temple<br/>
inscriptions were composed in the Egyptian language and written<br/>
in the Egyptian character, and Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">became </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>language, although the great mass of the people adhered to <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">native<br/>
</span>Nubian tongue<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
