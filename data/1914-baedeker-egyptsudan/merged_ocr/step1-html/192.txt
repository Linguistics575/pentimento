<br/>
than those of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">liwéus</span>, is provided with a wooden <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupola </span>or lantern,<br/>
with coloured-glass windows <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>kind known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Famttrtyehs</span>. These<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tcamartyehs </span>are plaster-slabs, about 11/4 inch in thickness, perforated, while still soft, with patterns representing vases of flowers,<br/>
houses, geometrical figures, <span style="color: #0000FF;">writing-characters</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, the openings<br/>
being afterwards filled in with coloured glass. Owing to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">abovementioned </span>difference in the height of the ceilings, two of the walls<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dur.kire </span>rest upon supports which are based upon massive<br/>
brackets reaching far down <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the main side-walls. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangement </span>results in a curious kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlat </span>arch, against which some of<br/>
the beams of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">liwirreeiling </span>lean. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">durWa </span>is paved with<br/>
coloured marbles and frequently has a fountain in the centre. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">liwiins </span>are paved with ordinary stone slabs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">concealed </span>by rugs or<br/>
carpets. On one wall of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">durlrira </span>there is always a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suffa</span>, a shelf<br/>
on which are placed <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>cups, ete. used in entertaining guests.<br/>
The walls of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">liwéns </span>are panelled to the height of 6-10 ft., and<br/>
against them are placed divans, above which is a broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornice-shelf</span>,<br/>
on which are arranged porcelain, chased metal-work, and similar<br/>
ornaments. Instead <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">panelling</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">du </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-ci'a </span>have marble<br/>
mosaics. The upper part of the walls is usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>with smooth<br/>
plaster or, in exceptional cases, with plaques of coloured fayence.<br/>
The expanse of white wall is usually broken by a grated recess intended for female singers and accessible from without. At the very<br/>
top of the wall is a broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">concave </span>frieze, embellished with <span style="color: #ff0000;">inseriptions </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>stalactites, and forming the transition to the usually elaborate <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling-decorations</span>. Light and air are admitted to <span style="color: #ff0000;">theiroom<br/>
</span>from one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ends, where <span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrabiyehs </span>are inserted in the lower<br/>
part of the wall and <span style="color: #ff0000;">tamariyehs </span>in the upper part.<br/>
<br/>
The Public Baths, usually of quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpretending </span>exterior, are<br/>
frequently very large erections in which marble is not spared; in<br/>
their heating arrangements they are modelled on ancient Roman<br/>
vapour-baths (comp<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>p. xxvii)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Okellas </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50</span>) were important <span style="color: #ff0000;">ediflces </span>when the caravan<br/>
trade, especially the <span style="color: #ff0000;">earavan-trade </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea, flourished.<br/>
Their often extensive facades <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a peculiar type. The portals<br/>
resemble those of the mosques, and the doors and shutters of the<br/>
outer shops are sometimes carved<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The central open <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accommodated </span>the caravan, the goods brought by which were deposited in<br/>
vaulted chambers on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">groundfloor</span>, while the rooms in the upper<br/>
stories, opening off galleries, were used as lodgings by the merchants.<br/>
The centre of the court seems in each case to have been occupied<br/>
by a simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer-room </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">mosalla</span>).<br/>
<br/>
When we come to analyse the impressions produced by a study<br/>
of Arabic buildings in Egypt, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>that our admiration of the<br/>
harmonious and tasteful ornamentation, unsurpassed by any school<br/>
of architecture, is counterbalanced by a certain feeling of <span style="color: #0000FF;">aesthetic<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dissatisfaction</span>. The main reason why Arabian art failed to reach a <span style="color: #0000FF;">high<br/>
