<br/>
</span>LAST JUDGMENT. The doctrine of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">resurrection </span>has been highly<br/>
elaborated in the Koran and subsequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">tradition</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but its main features<br/>
have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>as has also the <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance </span>of Antichrist, and the part to he played <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Christ at the Last Day.<br/>
On that day Christ will <span style="color: #ff0000;">establish </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Isltun </span>as the religion of the world.<br/>
Before him will <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-appear </span>the Mahdi, the'well-directed <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span>', the twelfth<br/>
Imam (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">mi</span>), who will establish the Islamic <span style="color: #0000FF;">ideal </span>empire and will render<br/>
Islamic law supreme. The Last Judgment will begin on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Christ</span>. The first <span style="color: #0000FF;">trumpet-blast </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the angel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asrafil </span>will kill every<br/>
living being; a <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>will awaken the dead<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Then follows the Judgment;<br/>
the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hair</span>'s breadth, while the<br/>
wicked fall from the bridge into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">abyss </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofhell</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Judgment </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">every<br/>
</span>man is judged according to the books of the recording angels <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxxvii</span>).<br/>
The hook is placed in the right hand <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the good, but is bound in the<br/>
left hand of the wicked behind their backs. The scales in which good<br/>
and evil deeds are weighed play an important part in deciding the soul's<br/>
fate, and the doctrine <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficacy </span>of works is carried so far that it is<br/>
believed works of <span style="color: #0000FF;">supererogatiOn </span>may be placed to the credit of other<br/>
believers. Hell, <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>well as heaven, has <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>grades; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">asSumes </span>the existence also of a purgatory, from which release is possible.<br/>
Paradise is depicted by Mohammed as a place <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>entirely material delights<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Mysticism, the third great <span style="color: #0000FF;">branch </span>of religious thought under<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Islim</span>, aims at an immediate union with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">divine </span>on the basis of<br/>
emotion, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">coutradistinction </span>to the hair-splitting of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dogmatists<br/>
</span>and to the doctrine of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tsffieaey </span>of works taught by the moralists.<br/>
The mystics seek their end in two ways. <span style="color: #ff0000;">On </span>the one hand they<br/>
bridge over the vast gulf between God and humanity by the conception of mediators with God, viz. Saints, who with reference to<br/>
an expression in the Koran are known as'those who stand <span style="color: #0000FF;">near<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">God</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Auliya</span>, sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wait</span>); and 011 the other hand, by emotional<br/>
exercises in company, they aim at producing an ecstatic exaltation<br/>
of mind, Le. the immediate blending of their own individuality<br/>
with that of the Deity. The latter is the explanation of the practices<br/>
of the orders of dervishes o. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xci </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. In the worship of saints, which<br/>
centres principally at tombs and ancient holy sites, <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>trace the<br/>
same popular polytheistic tendencies as appear in Christianity,<br/>
connected with the primitive traditions of the heroic age. A not<br/>
unwarrantable attempt has been made to deduce the fundamental<br/>
forms of early Semitic religious conceptions from the practices<br/>
current to-day in the Islamic saint-worship. The recognition of<br/>
saints became possible in Islam when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>himself <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>exalted above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infirmities </span>of humanity. The tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>at Medina and that of his grandson <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hoseiu </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerbeli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">became </span>particularly famous, and every little town soon boasted ofthe<br/>
tomb of its particular saint. In many of the villages the traveller<br/>
will observe small dome-covered buildings with grated windows.<br/>
These are saints' tombs and are <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'lilheikhi </span>(comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxxiii</span>).<br/>
'Sheikh' also means a chief or old man. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shreds </span>of cloth are often<br/>
seen suspended from the gratings of these tombs, or on certain <span style="color: #ff0000;">trees<br/>
<br/>
