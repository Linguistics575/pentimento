<span>260 Route 20. THEBES <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RANK</span>). 1. Temple<br/>
<br/>
and contributes essentially to the dignified appearance of the ruins<br/>
of Luxor when viewed from the river. Seven couples <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">papyruscolnmns</span>, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">52 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>in height, with calyx-capitals, still support<br/>
a heavy architrave above a lofty abacus. The whole was built by<br/>
Amenophis 111., but <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tut-eukh-Amun </span>(p. 257), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilaremheb</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, and Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>have likewise recorded their names upon<br/>
it. The walls on each side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>were embellished by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tut-enkh-Amun </span>(whose name was later replaced by that of his<br/>
successor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haremheb</span>) with <span style="color: #0000FF;">tine </span>reliefs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">representing </span>the great festival<br/>
celebrated at Luxor on New Year's Day. On that day the sacred<br/>
boats of the gods were brought by the Nile from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kama </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>to Luxor,<br/>
borne into the temple at Luxor, and returned to Karnak in the<br/>
evening. The procession is here depicted in a realistic manner<br/>
in all its interesting details, though unfortunately a large part of<br/>
the reliefs has perished with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined </span>upper part of the walls.<br/>
The series begins at the N.W. corner of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>and ends at<br/>
the N.E. corner.<br/>
<br/>
The (second) Court of Amenophis III. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">C.</span>), which visitors<br/>
actually enter first, is 49 yds. deep and 56 yds. broad, and had<br/>
double rows of columns on three sides. The columns are clustered<br/>
papyrus-columns with <span style="color: #ff0000;">bud-eapitals</span>; the E. and W. rows, with the<br/>
architrave, are in excellent preservation. - The remaining (<span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>)<br/>
side of this court is <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pronaos </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vestibule </span>of the temple proper (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span>. D), the roof of<br/>
which was borne by 32 clustered papyrus-columns arranged in <span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span>rows<br/>
of 8. The reliefs on the E. wall show Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>before the<br/>
gods of Thebes; at the foot of the wall are <span style="color: #0000FF;">personifications </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">names</span>, bearing gifts. To the left stands an Altar, dedicated to the Emperor Constantine, with a Latin inscription. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Adjoining </span>the rear wall are two small Chapels (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. L and M) and a<br/>
staircase (PI. N), now destroyed. One chapel (L) was dedicated<br/>
to the goddess Mut, the other (M) to the moon-god Khons. - A<br/>
door in the centre of the rear wall admits to a smaller hall, which<br/>
originally had eight columns and was converted into a Church<br/>
(Pl. E) in the Christian period. The ancient entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanctuary-ehambers </span>has here been altered into a kind of apsidal recess,<br/>
bounded on the right and left by two granite Corinthian columns.<br/>
At a few points the Christian whitewash has peeled off, permitting<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the'heathen</span>' reliefs of Amenophis III. to become visible again.<br/>
Adjoining the church are several small rooms (Pl. I on the W.,<br/>
Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">H </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">E </span>on the E.<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We return to the Vestibule and quit the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a door on<br/>
the E. side, then turn to the right and re-enter it almost immediately<br/>
(three doors) to inspect the Birth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. R), the roof of which<br/>
rested upon three clustered columns. The room owes its name to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Relief</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>on the W. wall, <span style="color: #0000FF;">referring </span>to the divine birth of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.<br/>
</span>The reliefs on the S. wall refer to his accession to the throne.<br/>
