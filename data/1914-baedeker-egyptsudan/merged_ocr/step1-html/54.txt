For thousands of years the banks of the Nile have been occupied<br/>
by the Egyptians. Notwithstanding the interminable series of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">immigrations </span>and other changes affecting the character of the<br/>
inhabitants, the Egyptian type has always predominated with marvellous uniformity<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>As Egypt is <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>the'gift of the Nile', so<br/>
has the character of its inhabitants been apparently moulded by the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">inflnenees </span>of that river. No country in the world is so dependent<br/>
on a river which traverses it as Egypt, and no river presents physical<br/>
characteristics so exceptional as the Nile; so, too, there exists no race<br/>
of people which possesses so marked and unchanging an individuality as the Egyptians. It is therefore most probable that this unvarying type is the product of the soil itself, and that the character of<br/>
the peoples who settled at different periods on the bank of the Nile,<br/>
whatever it may originally have been, has in due course of time<br/>
been moulded to the same constant form by the mysterious <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of the river. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span>countries, indeed, national <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span>are justly regarded as the natural outcome of soil and climate,<br/>
and of this connection no country <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>so strong an illustration<br/>
as Egypt, with its sharply defined boundaries of sea and desert, and<br/>
in its complete isolation from the rest of the world. <span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>fidelity to<br/>
type, which doubtless <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>other oriental races share with the<br/>
Egyptians, is by no means in accordance with common theories as<br/>
to the decline and degeneration of the Orient. These races seem to<br/>
possess an innate capacity that is absent from Western nations the capacity, namely, of permanently preserving the original type.<br/>
In Egypt this tendency may be partly assisted by the universal<br/>
practice of early marriages, by which the succession of generations<br/>
is accelerated, while many children are born of parents still <span style="color: #0000FF;">unaffected </span>by any physical deterioration. Although the country has<br/>
been at various periods overrun by Hyksos, Ethiopians, Assyrians,<br/>
Persians, Greeks, Romans, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs</span>, and Turks, and although the people<br/>
were tyrannized over, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-treated</span>, and in most cases compelled to intermarry with these foreigners, the Egyptians have for thousands of<br/>
years retained the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">unvarying </span>physical types, while their character has been but slightly <span style="color: #0000FF;">modified </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bythe </span>introduction <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofChristianity<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span>. If it now be borne in mind that these foreigners generally invaded the country in the form of an army, that<br/>
they formed but a small body compared with the bulk of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">population</span>, and that they either married native women or sought wives<br/>
in other countries, it is obvious that they would either continue to<br/>
exist for a time as a foreign caste, a condition apparently repugnant<br/>
to nature and necessarily transient, or that they would gradually<br/>
succumb to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">never-failing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ir1fluenees </span>of the soil and be absorbed<br/>
in the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants. An excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">illustration </span>of this process is afforded by the Arabian invasion, with<br/>
