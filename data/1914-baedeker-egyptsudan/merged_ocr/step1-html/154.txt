<br/>
to content themselves with simpler tombs, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the necessaries<br/>
for the future life were buried with the bodies. But at a later period<br/>
even the ordinary citizens built'everlasting houses' for themselves,<br/>
at least so far as they possessed the means to do so.<br/>
<br/>
The dead were <span style="color: #0000FF;">under</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>the protection of the local deities, whose<br/>
duty it was to superintend the funeral ceremonies and afford <span style="color: #ff0000;">seourity </span>in the tomb. There was also in many towns a special god of<br/>
the dead, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khente-Amentiu</span>,'the first of the inhabitants of the<br/>
Western kingdom' (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deb </span>d), who was represented in the form<br/>
of a dog. At a later date these local gods retired in favour of Osiris.<br/>
He was gradually recognized as the ruler ofthe dead by all Egypt, and<br/>
dominion <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the departed was assigned to him almost exclusively.<br/>
Abydos became the chief religious centre of his cult. The death<br/>
which, according to the legend (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.0xliii</span>), Osiris suffered <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">common </span>lot of mortals; <span style="color: #ff0000;">butjust </span>as Osiris rose again, so a man also could<br/>
begin a new life, provided that the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">formula </span>were pronounced<br/>
for him by some faithful son; he went to Osiris, became united with<br/>
the slain god, in fact was himself Osiris. Admission to the realm of<br/>
Osiris depended upon the recitation of magical <span style="color: #0000FF;">formulae </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">incantations</span>, a knowledge <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>must be communicated to the deceased.<br/>
A virtuous earthly life was required to assure the deceased eternal<br/>
happiness, and he had therefore to undergo a trial before Osiris and<br/>
to prove before <span style="color: #ff0000;">42 </span>judges that he was free from mortal sin. Before<br/>
this, and before his heart had been weighed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thout </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the scales of<br/>
righteousness and found perfect, he might not enter the future land.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions differed as to the abode of the blessed dead. Their<br/>
dwelling was usually located in the West, among the mountains,<br/>
and in the desert where the sun set. Some believed that they inhabited the heavenly fields of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Earn</span>, a fruitful country where ploughing and reaping were carried on as upon earth, and where the corn<br/>
grew seven ells high, forming a veritable paradise for the Egyptian peasant. As the labour in this future land might often be<br/>
too great for the strength of the deceased, it became the custom at<br/>
the period of the Middle Empire to place <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ushebtis </span>in the tomb along<br/>
with him. These little <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of men <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>imbued with life by a<br/>
magic spell written upon them and assisted the deceased when<br/>
he was called to work beyond the tomb. Another doctrine sought<br/>
to unite the different conceptions of the future life and placed the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">abodes </span>of the blessed <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Twat, the underworld (see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">cxliv</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. This<br/>
was divided into twelve parts, corresponding to the twelve hours<br/>
of night, and, according to a certain view, separated from each other<br/>
by massive gates (comp. pp. 284 et <span style="color: #0000FF;">seq.</span>).<br/>
<br/>
In flat contradiction to these doctrines <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the popular belief<br/>
that man possessed not only a body but also a <span style="color: #0000FF;">soul </span>(ba'i), which lived<br/>
after death. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This </span>was originally conceived of as a bird; at a later<br/>
period as a bird with a human head. It was believed that the spirit<br/>
left the body at death and flew <span style="color: #0000FF;">freely </span>about, but could return to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
