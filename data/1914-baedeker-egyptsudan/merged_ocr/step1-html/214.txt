<br/>
with the Museum was the famous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexandria</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Library<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which contained<br/>
400,000 scrolls as early as the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>while in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesars </span>time, when it was burned, the number <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>risen to about 900,000.<br/>
The library lay to the N. of the Museum, near the harbour. Apart from the<br/>
revenues <span style="color: #0000FF;">enjoyed </span>by the Museum in its <span style="color: #0000FF;">corporate </span>capacity, a yearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">sultry<br/>
</span>was paid to each of the members, whose number in the time of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies </span>has been estimated at <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>hundred at least.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>(Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarapeion</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or great temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapis</span>, whose<br/>
worship was introduced by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, was situated on the hill on<br/>
which stands Pompey's Pillar (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.16</span>).<br/>
<br/>
In 69 A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vespasian </span>was proclaimed emperor by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrians</span>, his recognition having been to a great extent due to the<br/>
influence of the philosophers then resident at the Museum. In<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Trajan</span>'s reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">98-117</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>the Jews, who constituted one-third of<br/>
the whole population, caused <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanguiuary </span>riots. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hadrian </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">117-138</span>),<br/>
who visited the city in 130, held public disputations with the professors at the Museum. Marcus Aurelius (161-180) attended the<br/>
lectures of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">grammarians </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Athenaeus</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harpoeration</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hephastion</span>,<br/>
Julius Pollux, and others. Lucian also lived at Alexandria at this<br/>
period, in the capacity of secretary to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prefect </span>of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sepiimius </span>Severus <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>193-211) visited Alexandria and established<br/>
a municipal constitution. A disastrous visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caracalla<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">211-217</span>), who <span style="color: #0000FF;">revenged </span>himself for the derision of the citizens<br/>
by a bloody massacre and also caused the academy to be closed.<br/>
Still more disastrous were the contests between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palmyrenes </span>and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Imperialists </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">cxi</span>), in which a large part of the population was<br/>
swept away by the sword, pestilence, and famine.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity early found its <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria</span>. According to<br/>
tradition the Gospel was first preached to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrians </span>by St.<br/>
Mark (whose bones <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>removed to Venice in <span style="color: #0000FF;">820</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The first<br/>
great persecution of the Christians, which took place in the reign<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Decius </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9-50</span>), was a terrible blow to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexanilrians</span>. The city<br/>
had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and had<br/>
since <span style="color: #ff0000;">190 </span>possessed a theological school, presided over by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pantamus<br/>
</span>and Clement <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>(beginning of 3rd cent), who <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to combine Christianity <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the Neo-Platonism which sprang<br/>
up about this period at Alexandria and was taught by Ammonius<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Saecas</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Herennius</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Plotinus </span>(p. 233), Porphyrius, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iamblichus</span>, and<br/>
others<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A second persecution took place in 257, during the reign of<br/>
Valerian<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and shortly afterwards, in the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gallienus</span>, the<br/>
plague carried off a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>portion of the population. Alexa dria,<br/>
however, still continued to be regarded as the chief seat of Christian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">erudition </span>and of the orthodox faith (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Athanasian </span>Creed), until it<br/>
was eventually obliged to yield to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople </span>its proud position as the centre of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek </span>thought and science. Sanguinary <span style="color: #ff0000;">quarrehitook </span>place between the Athanasian party and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arians </span>under<br/>
their unworthy bishop Georgius. On the accession of Julian the<br/>
Apostate <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>361-363) the pagans of Alexandria again instituted a<br/>
persecution of the Christians. In the reign of Theodosius (<span style="color: #0000FF;">379-395</span>),<br/>
