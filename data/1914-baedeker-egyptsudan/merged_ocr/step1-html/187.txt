</span>in that country. The four <span style="color: #ff0000;">liwéns </span>were superseded by a single sanctuary, consisting of a main building covered with domes and usually<br/>
preceded by a second court (comp. the plan on p. 69).<br/>
<br/>
The smaller prayer-rooms, frequently added to private houses<br/>
and not unlike the Christian chapels, are known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ztiuriyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>EXTERIOR of the earliest mosques was absolutely plain. The<br/>
court was enclosed by a simple battlemented wall and was entered<br/>
by an <span style="color: #ff0000;">nnadorned </span>doorway. It was not until the Egyptians beheld<br/>
the buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Crusaders in Syria and Palestine that they began<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">elaborate </span>the facades of their mosques. The hitherto smooth<br/>
walls were now interrupted by panels or <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>, receding about 8 or<br/>
10 inches, but again brought forward to the level of the facade by<br/>
smooth slanting surfaces immediately below the unobtrusive battlemented main cornice. In these panels were placed the windows<br/>
(rectangular or arched)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>frequently arranged in pairs with a smaller<br/>
circular or star-shaped window above usually closed with <span style="color: #ff0000;">liamariyeh<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxxvi</span>). The main portal was a deep rectangular recess, with a<br/>
stone bench on either side, and terminating at the top in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ham<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dome</span>, embellished with stalactites. The doorway at the inner end<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the recess was surmounted by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave-arch </span>and a relieving<br/>
arch. The door itself, often richly panelled, is usually adorned <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>one side with embossed or chased bronze decorations<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The threshold<br/>
generally consisted of a block of granite taken from an Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">monument </span>The low railing here (or on the steps below) marks the<br/>
boundary to which the visitor may penetrate without removing <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
</span>shoes or sandals.<br/>
<br/>
We now turn to inspect the <span style="color: #0000FF;">INTERNAL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EQUIPMENT </span>of the mosque.<br/>
The centre of the Court was originally occupied by a fountain, beneath a canopy supported upon columns. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>intended for<br/>
ornament only, for the prescribed <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablutions </span>were performed at a<br/>
special basin (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ale</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">u.lii</span>) in an adjoining court. Under Turkish rule<br/>
the fountain was frequently replaced by an apparatus provided<br/>
with taps and known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">f.lanefiyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Sanctuary contains the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiibla </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miyrtsb</span>, the prayer-niche<br/>
turned towards Mecca. Here we further observe: (<span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span>) the Minbar, or<br/>
pulpit, to the right of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kibia</span>, usually embellished with <span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamental </span>panels and <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>; (<span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span>) the Kursi, the seat of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Imam</span>, together with a desk <span style="color: #ff0000;">forithe </span>Koran; (3) the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dikkeli</span>, a podium<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and surrounded by a low railing, from which the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Muballighin </span>(assistants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrant</span>) repeat the words of the<br/>
Koran and the ritualistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">gestures </span>for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>more <span style="color: #0000FF;">distant </span>worshippers; (4) the lamps and lanterns <span style="color: #ff0000;">fTuantir</span>, large <span style="color: #0000FF;">chandelier</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Toreiya</span>, lit.'seven stars', small chandelier; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ftnils</span>, lamp,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nando</span>, small oil-lamp) which hang by wires from the iron braces<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ceilings </span>of the arcades as in all the <span style="color: #ff0000;">liwéns</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The sanctuary is frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>by the Turba or Mortuary<br/>
Chapel of the founder. This is usually a square <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">contain<br/>
