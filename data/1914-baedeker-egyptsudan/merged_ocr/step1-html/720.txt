<br/>
The native town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Omdurman</span>, which was the capital under the<br/>
new Mahdi regime, was founded in 1883-84 by the Mahdi Mohammed Ahmed (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">427 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, and after his death in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1885 </span>it was the residence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalifa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAbdallah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Tartishi </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>years, <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>it became the scene of the most atrocious <span style="color: #0000FF;">cruelties </span>and the most<br/>
extravagant orgies. It extends for about 31/2 M. along the left bank<br/>
of the united Nile, and has room for upwards <span style="color: #ff0000;">of100,000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants</span>. The name is said to be derived from an old woman who<br/>
once spent a solitary existence here. The S. part is the Umm<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ed-Durmfin </span>proper<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The central part, including the holy buildings<br/>
and the walled inner town inhabited by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baggira </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Balrlstra</span>)<br/>
tribe, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom'Abdallah </span>belonged, is called by the natives <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Ba.hfa</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>.'the (holy) <span style="color: #ff0000;">p1aee</span>', a name always given to the wandering<br/>
headquarters of the Mahdists. To the N. is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">H </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">& </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ret </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tm-Nayira<br/>
</span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Jle.siyin</span>, the Christian quarter, inhabited by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinians</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts</span>, and Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
The warlike oppression before 1899, the fanatical enthusiasm<br/>
for pilgrimages, the desire for plunder, and the devastation of whole<br/>
provinces have assembled here a confused medley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the most diverse<br/>
races and stocks: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bautus </span>and grotesque dwarf negroes from the W.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SMin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Semitic and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic </span>tribes from the desert, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ntoa</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bagg√©ra</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kabhabish</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gowameh</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kowihleh </span>Arabs; Nubians, Fellahin, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ja'ilin </span>(p. 423). To these must now be added Egyptians,<br/>
Syrians, and a few Greeks. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sl10pkeepers </span>are mostly <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dougolese</span>.<br/>
The fashions prevalent among the natives are very curious, such as<br/>
their methods of shaving, tattooing, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfuming </span>themselves, and<br/>
otherwise altering their personal appearance.<br/>
<br/>
The steam-ferry lands its passengers at Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Anga</span>, near the large<br/>
and picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamda</span>, or Boat Harbour, which is adjoined by<br/>
the markets for ivory, <span style="color: #0000FF;">india-rubber</span>, and grain. From this point we<br/>
may proceed into the town either by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-tramway </span>(p.426) or<br/>
(preferably) by donkey. - Following the tramway-line, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross </span>one<br/>
of the markets (<span style="color: #0000FF;">say</span>) and reach the lofty walls surrounding the Beit<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">eL-Amiina </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">P1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">19</span>; B, 2), the former arsenal of the dervishes, which<br/>
still serves as a military magazine and contains memorials of Gordon's<br/>
time and trophies of weapons. For a visit to it, which, however,<br/>
is hardly worth while, a permit must he obtained from the Assistant Secretary, Stores Section in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eharttsm </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">429</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The Prison<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>B, 2), where many Europeans languished, is situated 500 yds.<br/>
farther E., at the S. angle of the ruinous town-wall. It is sometimes<br/>
known as the'Saier Prison', from the name of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">jailor </span>under the<br/>
Mahdi and Khalifa. - Farther on, to the left, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">JromamMn'lyell<br/>
</span>or Guard House <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Sudanese, formerly the House of Emir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yak0b<br/>
</span>(P1. 21). On the large Mosque Square (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. B, 2), in which the dervish army was reviewed, lie (<span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>.) the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zab.ttyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ma'mtlr<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22</span>) and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span>) the Mosque of the Khalifa, a large rectangular court<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounded </span>by a brick wall (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxviii</span>).<br/>
