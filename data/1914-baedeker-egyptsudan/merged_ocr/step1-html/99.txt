</span>Remarks on Mohammedan Customs.<br/>
<br/>
The rite of circumcision is performed on boys up to the age of<br/>
six or seven, or even later, the ceremony being attended with great<br/>
pomp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">child </span>is previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">conducted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">streets </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hot </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iday<br/>
</span>attire; in <span style="color: #0000FF;">order </span>to diminish the expense of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>proceedings, the<br/>
procession is frequently united with some bridal party, or two <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>more boys are driven together in a carriage. The boy generally<br/>
wears a turban of red cashmere, girls' clothes of the richest possible description, and conspicuous female ornaments, which are<br/>
designed to attract attention and thus avert the evil eye from his<br/>
person. He half covers his face with an embroidered handkerchief;<br/>
and the barber who performs the operation and a noisy troop of<br/>
musicians head the procession<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The first personage in the procession<br/>
is usually the barber's boy, carrying <span style="color: #ff0000;">tho'lieml</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">barber</span>'s sign, a<br/>
kind of cupboard made <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wood</span>, in the form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">hVisylruder</span>, with<br/>
four short legs.<br/>
<br/>
Girls are generally married in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">12th </span>or 13th, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes </span>as early as their 10th year. A man in search of a bride<br/>
employs the services of a relative or of a professional female <span style="color: #0000FF;">matchmaker</span>, and he never has an <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>of seeing his bride until<br/>
the wedding-day, except when the parties <span style="color: #0000FF;">belong </span>to the lowest<br/>
classes. When everything is arranged, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">affianeed </span>bridegroom<br/>
has to pay a bridal-portion <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mahr</span>) amounting to about <span style="color: #0000FF;">25 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, less<br/>
being paid <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>the bride is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>widow. Generally speaking, <span style="color: #ff0000;">about<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">twe-thirds </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the amount of which always forms a <span style="color: #0000FF;">subject<br/>
</span>of lively discussion, is paid down, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third </span>is settled upon<br/>
the wife, being payable on the death of the husband or on his<br/>
divorcing her against her will. Before the wedding the bride is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conducted </span>in gala attire and with great ceremony to the bath. This<br/>
procession is <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'Zeffet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-llamrtu</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">un</span>'. It is headed by several<br/>
musicians with hautbois and drums; these are followed by several<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">married </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">female </span>friends <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>relatives of the bride in pairs, and after<br/>
these <span style="color: #0000FF;">come </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>number of young girls. The bride follows, under <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>silken <span style="color: #ff0000;">eanoPy </span>open in front. In Cairo, however, this <span style="color: #0000FF;">canopy </span>is now<br/>
generally replaced by a carriage of some kind. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">shrinks </span>of joy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>women of the lower classes utter on such occasions <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">saghi'crit </span>(sing<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">zaglmita </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. The bride is afterwards conducted with<br/>
the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">formalities </span>to the house of her husband.<br/>
<br/>
The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable<br/>
than those that attend weddings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>death occurs in the morning, the funeral takes place the same day; but if <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the evening,<br/>
it is postponed till next day. The body is washed and mourned<br/>
over by the family and the professional mourning women <span style="color: #ff0000;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">neddabeh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flcts</span>, or schoolmasters, read several <span style="color: #ff0000;">strehs </span>of the Koran<br/>
by its side; after this, it is wrapped in its white or green winding<br/>
sheet, placed on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bier</span>, and then carried forth in solemn <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro<br/>
<br/>
