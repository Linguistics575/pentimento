</span>VIII. Buildings of the Mohammedans.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Franz-Pasha</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Mohammedan style of architecture in the valley ofthe Nile<br/>
was founded upon the forms of art which the victorious Arabs<br/>
found in vogue among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Byzantines </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cepts</span>, and upon those<br/>
of Persian art of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">era </span>of the Sassanides. The buildings in Egypt<br/>
exhibit a considerable variety coupled with a certain finish <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofstyle</span>,<br/>
but none of them dates <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>period ofthe Arabic dominion;<br/>
for the professors of the new religion were for centuries content<br/>
merely to adapt the religious <span style="color: #ff0000;">editlees </span>of the conquered countries as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mosques</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This was a process of <span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieulty</span>, for the ceremonial<br/>
requirements of the new religion were comparatively simple, and<br/>
it took place in all parts of the great empire of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Galip'hs</span>. From<br/>
casual references <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Arabian <span style="color: #ff0000;">1yhroniclers </span>we learn that the<br/>
earliest prayer-houses built by the Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span>merely enclosed <span style="color: #0000FF;">courts</span>,<br/>
along the walls of which ran covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">passages</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>supported by palm<br/>
trunks, in order to shelter the worshippers from sun and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Even </span>the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span>built by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifa'Abdallil1 </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Omdurman<br/>
</span>(p. 430) is of this type. Costly mosques, with marble arcades, began to appear <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>gradually, under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iutluiynee </span>of the ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">editiees </span>and of the increasing wealth flowing from the military<br/>
successes of the Mohammedans. Columns from Greek and Roman<br/>
temples and even, in some cases, <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iyarly-Egyptian </span>buildings,<br/>
were freely employed in these later mosques. This employment of<br/>
ancient columns in the mosques, frequently without any regard to<br/>
harmony of style or size, brings it <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>that uniformity in the<br/>
architecture of the arcades is observed only when the abacus is<br/>
reached. No distinct Arabian order of <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>was thus ever developed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>A few Arabian forms of capital (one a curious<br/>
form of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ealyx-capita </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, another including a wreath of <span style="color: #ff0000;">stalaetites </span>as<br/>
the transition between the shaft and the abacus) are the only <span style="color: #0000FF;">evidence </span>of any effort towards originality in this direction.<br/>
<br/>
The most prominent characteristic peculiarities of Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture </span>are the following:<br/>
1. The use of the pointed arch (Mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'lhu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tul</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, p. 71) and<br/>
the Byzantine stilted round arch, as well as of the round and pointed<br/>
horseshoe arch, the scalloped arch, the clover-leaf <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the<br/>
'keel' arch. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>except the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scalloped </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">clover-leaf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arches</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>were accompanied by corresponding forms of domes.<br/>
<br/>
2. The development of the form of tower known as the minaret.<br/>
<br/>
3. The refining of various forms of pinnacles that occur also in<br/>
early Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assyria</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phaauieia</span>, and Persia.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">d. </span>The employment in facades of two colours, by alternate<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">courses </span>of red and white limestone or (in later examples) of black<br/>
and white marble.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">D. </span>The invention of the elegant wooden balconies and the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
