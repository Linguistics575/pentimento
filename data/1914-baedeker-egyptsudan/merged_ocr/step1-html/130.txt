<span style="color: #ff0000;">pearanee </span>before Alexandria. In the middle <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">June </span>serious<br/>
disturbances broke out in that town, in the course <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofwhich<br/>
</span>many Europeans were killed, while the others found refuge <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>board the ships. On July 11th and <span style="color: #0000FF;">12th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria<br/>
</span>was bombarded by the British fleet, and on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sept. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">13th<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortified </span>camp of Arabi at Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Rem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>181) was<br/>
stormed by a British force under Sir Garnet Wolseley.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi </span>and his associates were captured and sent as exiles to<br/>
Ceylon. Since then British <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>has been paramount<br/>
in Egypt. Arabi, who had been released and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pensioned<br/>
</span>in 1901, died at Cairo in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1911</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In 1883 Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer) <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">came </span>British diplomatic agent and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eosul-general </span>in<br/>
Egypt. In his hands lay the control of <span style="color: #0000FF;">British </span>policy in that<br/>
country and he has <span style="color: #0000FF;">won </span>high distinction as one of the<br/>
makers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>Egypt. In the autumn of the same<br/>
year a <span style="color: #0000FF;">widespread </span>rebellion broke out among the Nubian<br/>
tribes of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">St1din </span>under the leadership of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed<br/>
</span>Ahmed, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">su-called'Mahdi</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sci</span>), which proved fatal<br/>
to the Egyptian supremacy in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bidin</span>. An Egyptian<br/>
force of 10,000 men under an Englishman named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hicks<br/>
</span>Pasha was annihilated in Nov., 1883, by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahdi</span>'s forces (comp. p. 433), and a second expedition of 3500 regular troops of the Egyptian army, led by Baker Pasha,<br/>
was likewise vanquished at Tokar in February, 1884. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the 18th of the same month General <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gordon</span>, who had<br/>
been Governor General of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shilin </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1877-79</span>, after a<br/>
perilous ride across the desert, entered <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartjim</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which<br/>
he had undertaken to save from the Mahdi; while <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>Jan. 29th and March 13th the rebels under the Mahdi's<br/>
lieutenant Osman Digna were defeated at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Et-Teb </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tarn/fi </span>by the British under Graham. The Mahdi himself, however, still maintained his position near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifharttlm</span>,<br/>
and towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">closed </span>the year a second British expedition (of 7000 men) was sent out under Wolseley to<br/>
rescue Gordon.<br/>
<br/>
Wolseley selected the tedious and laborious Nile route <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>this expedition in preference to the shorter but more dangerous desert route from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Suikin </span>to Berber. An advanced<br/>
brigade under General Stewart <span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span>, however, sent on from<br/>
Korti at the beginning of 1885, which accomplished its<br/>
march across the Bayada Desert with complete success,<br/>
gaining severely contested victories over large bodies<br/>
of the Mahdi's followers at Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Klea </span>(Jan. 17th) and at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ithrik</span>, near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metemmeh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jan. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">filth</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Stewart, however, was <span style="color: #ff0000;">mortallywounded </span>at the latter engagement. The<br/>
British reached the Nile at Gubat, just above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metem<br/>
