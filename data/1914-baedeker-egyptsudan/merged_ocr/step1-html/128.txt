death of the sultan (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ist </span>July, 1839) Ahmed Pasha, the<br/>
Turkish high admiral, and the entire Turkish fleet declared<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed</span>. The armed intervention of England and<br/>
Austria, however, obliged <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>to yield to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ports<br/>
</span>a second time. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ly </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-ealled </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">firman </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">investiture </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of'<br/>
</span>1841 the sultan assured the hereditary sovereignty of<br/>
Egypt to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">family </span>of Mohammed Ali, <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the<br/>
Turkish law of succession (<span style="color: #0000FF;">seniorate</span>), and granted to the<br/>
pasha the right of concluding <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-political </span>treaties and<br/>
of appointing all Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'fleers </span>up to the<br/>
rank of colonel. In return the pasha was required to pay<br/>
to the Porte an annual tribute <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">80,000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">purses </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">318,930L</span>).<br/>
During the last years of his life <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fell </span>into a<br/>
state of <span style="color: #0000FF;">imbecility</span>. He died <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Aug. 2nd, 1849, in his<br/>
palace at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shuhra</span>.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sequence </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>'s incapacity, in Jan., 1848, but<br/>
he died in November of the same year, before his adoptive father.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Abbkg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, a son <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tustin </span>(p. cxxi), had all the dislike <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">true<br/>
</span>son of the desert for European innovations. He, however,<br/>
maintained the strictest discipline among his <span style="color: #ff0000;">off1eialiy</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sa'id</span>, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">successor</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ali</span>'s fourth son. He<br/>
equalized the incidence of taxation, abolished monopolies,<br/>
completed the railways from Cairo to Alexandria and to<br/>
Suez, and, above all, zealously supported the scheme for<br/>
the Suez Canal. During the Crimean <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>obliged<br/>
to send an auxiliary army and considerable sums of<br/>
money to the aid of the Porte. He died in 1863 and was<br/>
succeeded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Iame'il</span>, the second son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibrahim </span>Pasha <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1830j</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lsm√©'il<br/>
</span>had received the greater part of his education in France<br/>
and had there acquired the strong preference for European<br/>
institutions which characterized him throughout his reign.<br/>
Most of his innovations, however, such as the foundation<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories </span>and the construction of canals, railways,<br/>
bridges, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">telegraphs</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>planned mainly in his own<br/>
interest, though of course the country shared in the advantage, while even in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">establishmentof </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">schools</span>, the reorganisation of the system <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">justice </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.39</span>, and the like,<br/>
he acted rather with an eye to produce an impression in<br/>
Europe than from real concern for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">needs </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects</span>.<br/>
As time went on he succeeded in appropriating for his own<br/>
use about <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-fifth </span>ofthe <span style="color: #ff0000;">cultivableland </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1866</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>in consideration of a large sum of money, he obtained the<br/>
sanction of the Porte to a new order of succession based<br/>
