The Northern Colossus is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">famous </span>vocal statue of Memnon. To<br/>
the left of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stands </span>his mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Met-em-wee</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>right his<br/>
wife Teye; a third <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure</span>, between the leg <span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>has been destroyed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>each side of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seat </span>two Nile-gods were <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>in sunk relief,<br/>
twining the representative plants of Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>papyrus and lily) round<br/>
the hieroglyph for'to unite', a symbol of the union of Upper and<br/>
Lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Attention began to be directed to the Musical Phenomenon <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with the colossus about the beginning of the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">empire</span>, after it had been broken. When it became known that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>N.<br/>
colossus emitted a musical note at sunrise, a new myth was <span style="color: #0000FF;">invented </span>to explain the fact. Memnon who had fallen at Troy <span style="color: #0000FF;">appeared </span>as a stone image at Thebes and greeted his mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">lies<br/>
</span>with a sweet and plaintive note when she appeared at dawn. The<br/>
goddess heard the sound and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">morning-dews </span>are the tears she<br/>
shed upon her beloved <span style="color: #0000FF;">child</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>the sound was not heard, it was<br/>
taken as a sign that the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>angry. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, who is the first<br/>
author to mention the phenomenon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">expresses </span>doubt as to its<br/>
genuineness; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pausanias </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Juvenal </span>(p. 354) <span style="color: #0000FF;">accept </span>it as a<br/>
fact. The phenomenon ceased altogether after the time of Septimius<br/>
Severus, who caused the restoration of the upper portions, perhaps<br/>
with a view to propitiate the angry god. The restoration was not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>managed, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">courses </span>of sandstone blocks.<br/>
Attempts have been made to explain the resonance of the stone as<br/>
due to the splitting <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>of minute particles from the surface, caused<br/>
by the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the cold nights. A<br/>
similar phenomenon has been observed elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The numerous Greek and Latin <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inscriptions</span>, in prose and verse, <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscribed </span>upon the legs of the figure <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>travellers <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span>the Roman empire,<br/>
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the<br/>
foot of the statue. The earliest was carved in the 11th year of the reign<br/>
of Nero, the latest in those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Septimius </span>Severus <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Caracalla</span>, and the<br/>
most numerous (27) in that of Hadrian. <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>one Egyptian (<span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">responsible </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a short demotic inscription) is <span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span>among these <span style="color: #ff0000;">seribhlers</span>. The inscriptions were for the must part the work of men <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofsome<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eminence</span>, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">8 </span>governors of Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">epistrateges </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebaid</span>,<br/>
2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">procurators</span>, etc. A large number, <span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span>not all, are dated. Many of the<br/>
great <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>who visited the marvels <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by their<br/>
wives. The colossus <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>frequently dumb, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>the visitor<br/>
usually waited <span style="color: #0000FF;">until </span>a more favourable occasion. Some were so struck<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">phenomenon </span>that they were not <span style="color: #0000FF;">content </span>till they had heard it<br/>
three or <span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>times. Hadrian (130 <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.DO </span>spent several days <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>along<br/>
with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">wife </span>Sabina and a large retinue. In his reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>perfect <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>of<br/>
Greek verses spread <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the legs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the colossus, most of them by the<br/>
court- <span style="color: #0000FF;">-poetess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Balbilla</span>. One of her <span style="color: #ff0000;">eiNsions </span>(on the left leg) relates in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">12 </span>hexameters that Memnon greeted Hadrian, as well as he could (<span style="color: #0000FF;">u</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>:<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">aumdv</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>when he perceived the <span style="color: #0000FF;">emperor </span>before sunrise<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but <span style="color: #ff0000;">that</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>clearer<br/>
note, like that caused by a blow on an instrument <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">copper</span>, was emitted<br/>
at the second hour, and that even a third sound <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>heard, so that all<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>could see how dear the emperor was to the gods<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span>far the best verses are <span style="color: #0000FF;">those </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the front of the pedestal by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asklcpiodotus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>calls himself imperial procurator and poet. They may<br/>
