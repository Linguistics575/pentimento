<br/>
of the plan of the mortuary temples of the Middle Empire beside<br/>
the pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lisht</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahslitir</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Illahtm</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">r.lawira</span>. Most of these<br/>
are in a very ruinous condition, like the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenemhet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Labyrinth (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">195</span>), while others have not been fully<br/>
excavated. The only one in tolerable preservation <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the mortuary<br/>
temple of Mentuhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mentuhorep </span>IV. <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Deir <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Babri<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>p. 304), but that is built on a peculiar plan with terraces and cannot be considered typical. For the way in which the pyramids were<br/>
built, comp. p. 124. At a later period the kings of Napata and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mero'e<br/>
</span>(pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">MO</span>, 422) <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-adopted </span>the pyramidal form for the royal tombs.<br/>
<br/>
The custom of placing their tombs at the foot of a royal pyramid<br/>
was gradually abandoned by the nobles at the close of the Ancient<br/>
Empire; they preferred to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>buried near their <span style="color: #0000FF;">own </span>homes. Like<br/>
the Pharaohs they built for themselves small BRICK <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYRAMIDS </span>upon<br/>
square or rectangular bases. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamber </span>was formed in the<br/>
thickness of the wall or dug out of the ground beneath; and a tombstone was erected on the outside, before which the survivors recited<br/>
their prayers <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>presented their <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span>. But the high and steep<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">declivity </span>of the desert-plateau did not always offer space enough<br/>
for such free-standing tombs; and at various points graves were<br/>
hewn in the rock, a practice of which there were isolated examples<br/>
even under the Ancient Empire o. 139). In accordance with the<br/>
fundamental conception of the tomb as the House of the Dead, each<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>these ROCK <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomes </span>must contain the four principal divisions of<br/>
the ancient Egyptian dwelling-house. Thus a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Forecourt</span>, usually<br/>
surrounded with a brick wall, was provided in the open air in front<br/>
of the tomb, generally ending in a small Colonnade with two pillars<br/>
or columns hewn in the solid rock. Beyond this was a large Chamber<br/>
with columns or pillars, followed by a small Chamber or Recess,<br/>
which contained the statue of the deceased, frequently accompanied<br/>
by that of his wife, hewn out of the rock, and thus corresponded<br/>
to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">serdib </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxviii</span>) of the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This dwelling-house arrangement is most distinctly seen in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tombs </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BenilJasan </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assu√©u </span>(comp. pp. 227, 358). The<br/>
inner walls are covered with inscriptions and representations, which,<br/>
though more varied in subject than those of the earlier tombs, agree<br/>
with them in being intended to provide for the enjoyment of the<br/>
deceased. The unembellished <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus-chamber </span>was reached<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>hall by a perpendicular shaft <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>in the rock.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tones </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">NEW </span>EMPIRE coincide in their general <span style="color: #0000FF;">features </span>with those of the Middle Empire. At this date also both freestanding tombs (<span style="color: #0000FF;">mas.t.abas </span>and pyramidal tombs) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">roek-hewn<br/>
</span>tombs occur, according to the nature of the site at <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>places.<br/>
The former variety of tomb is now, however, represented by very<br/>
few examples. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tombs </span>a narrow corridor is <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently<br/>
</span>found between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>hall and the small inner chamber with the<br/>
statues; for their general arrangement and decoration, see the re<br/>
