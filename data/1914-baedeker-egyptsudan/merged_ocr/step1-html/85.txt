<br/>
</span>By <span style="color: #0000FF;">Professor </span>C. H. Becker.<br/>
<br/>
The term <span style="color: #0000FF;">mam </span>is used to connote the peculiar civilization of<br/>
<br/>
the Nearer East, which owes its characteristic features to the spread<br/>
of the Arabs and to the religion of Mohammed. However strange<br/>
and novel it may appear to us at first sight, it is nevertheless based<br/>
upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>same general <span style="color: #0000FF;">principles </span>as the civilization <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval<br/>
</span>Europe, from which it <span style="color: #0000FF;">differs </span>mainly in being represented by other<br/>
peoples and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">races</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to whom the brilliant intellectual development of Europe has been denied.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>The rise of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ei-1sltm </span>has become historically intelligible only<br/>
within <span style="color: #0000FF;">recent </span>years. Formerly it was tacitly assumed on all hands<br/>
that the Arabs had imposed upon the East not only a new language,<br/>
but also a new, <span style="color: #ff0000;">speeiiieally </span>Arab, civilization. This view agreed<br/>
with Christian conceptions, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognized </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1slrrim </span>only a new<br/>
religion and founded its opposition to Arab dominion <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">religions<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ecclesiastical </span>motives only. In Christian eyes Mohammed was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">identified </span>with Antichrist; he instigated his barbarian hordes to<br/>
hurl themselves upon the Christian countries of the East in order to<br/>
convert them to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam </span>by the sword; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>since<br/>
antiquity was abruptly broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and the Islamic Arab civilization<br/>
superseded its <span style="color: #ff0000;">early-0hristian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">predeeessor</span>. When, with such <span style="color: #0000FF;">preconceptions </span>as these, the Arabian historical sources were consulted,<br/>
they seemed at first to yield confirmation. The Arab tradition was as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ecclesiastically </span>coloured as the European; <span style="color: #ff0000;">there/too/the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">startingpoint </span>was Mohammed and the Arab migrations; Mohammed and<br/>
the early Caliphs were supposed to have reorganized everything<br/>
and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">created</span>, in all essentials, the new Islamic civilization.<br/>
As a matter of fact, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">erroneousness </span>of all these current <span style="color: #ff0000;">f'0rlceptions </span>cannot <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>too emphatically insisted <span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>it must be clearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">understood</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the; <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphant </span>campaigns of the Mohammedans were nothing else than an<br/>
Arab Migration, the latest and, for us, the most obvious of the great<br/>
Semitic migrations, <span style="color: #0000FF;">absolutely </span>analogous with the great migrations<br/>
of the Germanic peoples in Europe. The main difference between<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Germaniehnigrations </span>is this, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vis</span>. that the Arabs,<br/>
owing to their religious organization, were directed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>central<br/>
authority, so that the establishment of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">homogeneouslslamic </span>empire became a possibility.'It was not religious zeal, it was not<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiery </span>words of an inspired prophet that urged the Arabs on<br/>
their warlike mission to the outer world; simple necessity, the long<br/>
continued economic decline of Arabia, <span style="color: #ff0000;">inja </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">word </span>sheer hunger,<br/>
drove them into the rich lands of the settled countries. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement </span>had begun centuries before <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed</span>. The tribes of Inner<br/>
Arabia were already on the move, a peaceful immigration of Arabs<br/>
into Mesopotamia and Syria had already begun, and the standing<br/>
