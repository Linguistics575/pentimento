<span>212 Route 15. TELL EL-'AMARNA. From Cairo<br/>
<br/>
sprang up, beside the imposing royal abode <span style="color: #0000FF;">arose </span>the dwellings of<br/>
the nobles, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hardly </span>tombs were prepared for the king and his<br/>
favourites in the hills to the east. But after the death <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis<br/>
</span>the ancient religion once more obtained the upper hand, the court<br/>
returned to Thebes, and the new town rapidly decayed. Its life<br/>
had <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>lasted for more than 50 years, and the site upon which it<br/>
stood was never again occupied. Owing to this circumstance the<br/>
ancient streets and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plans </span>have remained to this day and<br/>
may be traced with little trouble (comp. below). The religious revolution under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>IV. was accompanied by a revolution in<br/>
art. The artists who worked in his reign, probably feeling themselves more independent of ancient traditions, attempted to lend<br/>
their creations a more natural expression. In many cases, however,<br/>
they fell into exaggeration, as, for example, in the representations<br/>
of the lean form of the king. The tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofEl-'Amarna </span>contain the<br/>
best examples of this realistic tendency and are, therefore, of great<br/>
importance in the history of art.<br/>
<br/>
About 1/2 hr. to the N. of Et-Till <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the ruins of the city and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Palace <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amencphis </span>IV. Its tine stucco pavements, <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>by Flinders Petrie in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1891-92</span>, were' <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruthlessly </span>destroyed in<br/>
1912 (fragments in the museum at Cairo, see p. 86). - To the E.<br/>
lay the Archives, in which in 1888 the celebrated clay tablets of<br/>
Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Amarna </span>with cuneiform inscriptions were found (now in<br/>
the British Museum and the museums of Berlin and Cairo; comp.<br/>
p. 89); these are letters <span style="color: #0000FF;">written </span>to kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>III. and IV.<br/>
by Babylonian and other kings of W. Asia and by Syrian and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phenician </span>vessels, and are of the greatest historical value. - The portion of the city that has, so far, been excavated by the German Orient<br/>
Society lies 11/2 M. to the N. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mt</span>), where permission<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>the excavations is obtained. If time permit, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller<br/>
</span>should see the well-preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">House </span>of the High Priest Pe-woh,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affording </span>as it does <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>typical example of the ground-plan of an<br/>
upper-class Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelling-house </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>. pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cixi</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxii</span>). He<br/>
may visit also the <span style="color: #0000FF;">House </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Farm-EailW</span>, where the laying-out of<br/>
the garden is still recognizable<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the House of the Sculptor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmose</span>,<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">workmen</span>'s dwellings, and lastly a large granary. Some of the<br/>
houses have well-preserved bathrooms and lavatories.<br/>
<br/>
From the palace we proceed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>, passing the site of the<br/>
<br/>
Great Temple, and in 3/4 hr. we <span style="color: #0000FF;">reach </span>the North Group of Tombs.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">roek-tombs </span>of Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-rAmarara </span>are essentially the same in point<br/>
of structure as the tombs of the 18th Dyn. <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span>(p. 309). Each is <span style="color: #0000FF;">im</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mediately </span>preceded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Forecourt</span>, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounded </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>brick wall. Thence a wide door admits to the Main Chamber, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span>of<br/>
which is in many cases supported by columns. The Chamber containing<br/>
the statue of the deceased is next reached, either by another door<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>corridor <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>frequently leads first to a narrow <span style="color: #0000FF;">anteroom</span>. Many <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the tombs are <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>, in consequence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">death </span>of Amenophis IV,<br/>
and the subsequent return of the court to Thebes. - The tombs (in <span style="color: #0000FF;">both<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">groups </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>are marked with black numbers (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1115</span>), running from N. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>.<br/>
