<span>122 Route J. BARRAGE DU NIL.<br/>
<br/>
The object of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Barrage </span>du Nil, the largest structure <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the kind in the world after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assmin </span>Dam <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>371), is to keep<br/>
the water-level in the Delta uniform in all seasons, so as to obviate the necessity for the old irrigation machinery, with its great<br/>
expenditure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">labour</span>, and to remove the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffleulties </span>of navigation during the three months when the Nile is at its lowest.<br/>
The work was begun under <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>Ali, about 1835. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lincmt<br/>
</span>Bey proposed to alter the course of the river and to build a weir<br/>
farther to the N., where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">configuration </span>of the ground appeared<br/>
more favourable; but his plan was <span style="color: #0000FF;">judged </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">too </span>costly and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rejected </span>in favour of one proposed by a French engineer named Mougel<br/>
Bey<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The cost of establishing foundations in the shifting soil of<br/>
the Delta, however, far exceeded the estimates; and, after all, the<br/>
erection was found to be too insecure for its intended purpose. For<br/>
nearly twenty years after 1867 the Barrage lay useless, as a costly<br/>
failure; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1885-90 </span>Sir Colin <span style="color: #ff0000;">Steott-Monerieff </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sueeessfully </span>completed it at a cost of <span style="color: #ff0000;">460,000l.</span>, so that now a depth of water of<br/>
about <span style="color: #ff0000;">12 </span>ft. can be maintained in the W. branch of the Nile. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>consequence of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">burst </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">winter </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oci909-i0 </span>considerable strengthening works became necessary, which are not yet quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Nearest the station are the Weirs on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rayt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Taufilct </span>and<br/>
on the E. (Damietta) Branch of the Nile. The latter weir is over<br/>
500 yds. in length and has <span style="color: #0000FF;">68 </span>vertical iron sluices. From the<br/>
farther end a pretty avenue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lebbakh- </span>trees leads across the<br/>
isthmus (about 1/2 M. wide) between the arms, in the middle of<br/>
which is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rayty </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Mena/heh</span>, constructed both for irrigation and<br/>
for communication with the district of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mmiyf'tyeh </span>(p. 33). The Weir<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>(Rosetta) Branch <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile is about 480 yds. across and<br/>
has <span style="color: #ff0000;">58 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">vertical </span>iron <span style="color: #ff0000;">sluioes</span>. Farther to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>is a fourth Weir, on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malimiidtyeh </span>Canal, constructed a few years ago. The navigation<br/>
of the river is carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>by means of spacious basins and <span style="color: #0000FF;">looks</span>,<br/>
titted with swing-bridges, at either end <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the two weirs and also <span style="color: #0000FF;">011<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Itayili </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Mtsnt1fiyel1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s11perstruetures </span>of the works are built<br/>
in an effective Norman castellated style. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">junction-canal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>the<br/>
weirs connects the two branches of the Nile, and is used to regulate<br/>
the depth of water in each. When the river is low the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">branch<br/>
</span>receives all its water through this <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The island, <span style="color: #0000FF;">formerly </span>occupied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortifications</span>, is now covered<br/>
with attractive and <span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive'Gardens</span>, laid out with flower-beds,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, by Mr. Draper, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Englishman</span>. - In the garden is a Museum, with models of the various water-works of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
If not pressed for time the traveller should visit the little Arab<br/>
village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shala.ktrn </span>which stretches along the river near the Barrage<br/>
station. A charming and picturesque impression <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>country-life is obtained here on market-days.<br/>
