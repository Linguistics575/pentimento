<br/>
hostility between Byzantium and Persia had many times led to<br/>
incursions into the settled districts by the savage <span style="color: #0000FF;">horder-tribes </span>of<br/>
both empires. The tide had thus begun to flow long before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam<br/>
</span>gave the movement a unifying <span style="color: #0000FF;">watch-word </span>and an organization.<br/>
Universal dominion for the Arabs was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">watch-word </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>that was the<br/>
interpretation put upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam </span>by the conquerors, in sharp contrast<br/>
with the initial position of their prophet. They had no thought<br/>
of converting the defeated nations by force; so long as tribute was<br/>
paid and Arab supremacy recognized, every <span style="color: #0000FF;">religious </span>and civil<br/>
right was <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>to the conquered. At first conversion to Islam<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>possible only by connecting the convert with the Arab tribal<br/>
system as a client; then, as a Moslem, he became, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">theory </span>at<br/>
least, a fully <span style="color: #0000FF;">qualified </span>burgess of the Islamic theocracy and no<br/>
longer required to pay tribute. Thus the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>of converts to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islim<br/>
</span>soon became larger than was altogether pleasing to the Arabs;<br/>
but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">impelling </span>force <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>not terror of the sword but the great<br/>
economic advantages that attended the transition of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>subject<br/>
into even the lowest rank among the rulers.<br/>
<br/>
The key to a proper appreciation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islamic </span>civilization lies in<br/>
a due understanding of the relations existing between the thin<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Arab </span>upper layer and the huge underlying mass of their subjects.<br/>
In the case of kindred peoples at least, it was easy for the Arabs to<br/>
impose their language as the language of common intercourse; and<br/>
for the reasons given above their religion also was bound to spread.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>for the rest the Arabs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span>few in number and on a<br/>
lower stage of culture, could hardly hope to stamp <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>civilization upon the highly-developed inhabitants of the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">empire<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">la </span>each <span style="color: #0000FF;">new-won </span>province, therefore, they simply took over the<br/>
arrangements for governing as they found them, and with them<br/>
all the problems of economic and intellectual life. Even their religion, in order to he <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective</span>, was forced to come to an understanding with the existing ecclesiastical conceptions of expiring<br/>
antiquity. The religion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam</span>, born of the religious-spirit of W.<br/>
Asia, did not of its own strength impose upon a population of a<br/>
widely different nature that religious temper which is to this day<br/>
characteristic of the Islamic world, permeating state and society,<br/>
family and individual. On the contrary; it was by the people of<br/>
the conquered lands that Islam itself was converted to that view of<br/>
existence, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>now see it, which infuses religion into everything;<br/>
for these new converts, in contrast with the religiously-indifferent<br/>
Arabs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">could </span>neither do anything nor leave anything undone without<br/>
bringing it into direct relation with God and the future life. We<br/>
must therefore think of the early Islamic civilization, not as something quite new, introduced from elsewhere by the Arabs, but as<br/>
the self- assertion of the remarkable mixed civilization of the<br/>
Near East which had developed in the course of the first six<br/>
Christian centuries. In other words, Islam is the heir of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">late<br/>
<br/>
