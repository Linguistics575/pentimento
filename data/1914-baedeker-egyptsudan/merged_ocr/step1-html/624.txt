<span>350 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roule23</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">KeM </span>OMBO. From Edfu<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Great </span>Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobek </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haro√©ris</span>. This temple was built on<br/>
a uniform plan in the Ptolemaic period and embellished with reliefs by Philometor, Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">IE</span>, and Neos <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">relief</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>in the court <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>on the outer walls, however, were added under the<br/>
Roman emperors, more especially under Tiberius. The Ptolemaic<br/>
reliefs are easily distinguished from those of the emperors, as they<br/>
are in low relief while the latter are'en <span style="color: #0000FF;">creux</span>'. In its general<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangements </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>temple of Ombos resembles other temples of the<br/>
same period tat Dendera, Edfu, and Phila), but it <span style="color: #0000FF;">differs </span>from<br/>
them in being dedicated to two deities instead of to one only. Each<br/>
of these two deities had his own special worship and festivals, so<br/>
the entire building is bisected longitudinally by an imaginary line,<br/>
each half having its own gateways, doorways, and chapels. The S.<br/>
or right half was dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobek</span>, the N. or left half to <span style="color: #0000FF;">HaraE'ris</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYLON</span>, at the entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ttsrrwhs-eourt</span>, had two doors.<br/>
The left wing has completely vanished; while only the lower part<br/>
of the central pillar (between the doors) and of the right wing<br/>
remain.<br/>
<br/>
On the outer side (facing the river) of the right wing <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the following representations, from left to right: <span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. a. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobek</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Har</span>, the gods worshipped in the right half of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">b. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hieroglyphic </span>text of 52 lines. Pl. c. Emp. Domitian, with the crown of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Upper<br/>
</span>Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">u </span>gods and goddesses, offering gifts to the above<br/>
mentioned deities.<br/>
<br/>
At the corner to the right (above Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">e</span>) the upper row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations<br/>
</span>also has been preserved: six demi-gods (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">three</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Souls </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hierakonpolis</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dogs</span>' heads) carry the newly crowned king (defaced) to<br/>
his palace, on a portable throne; they are followed by the symbols<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t'life0 </span>and (<span style="color: #ff0000;">'happiness0</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>images of the gods on long poles;<br/>
<br/>
finally a large figure of the king, preceded by a priest <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>followed by his guardian-spirit (with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>king's head upon a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sceptre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>The COURT, as at Edfu, was surrounded on three sides by colonnades. Only the lower portions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns'are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span>.<br/>
The reliefs on these, the colouring of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>in places admirably<br/>
preserved, represent Tiberius <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifleing </span>to the gods. On the inner<br/>
side of the right wing of the pylon are two doors, one of which<br/>
(Pl. d) admits to a small apartment, while the other (Pl. e) leads to<br/>
a staircase by which the roof of the pylon was gained. The square<br/>
base in the centre of the court was probably an altar; let into the<br/>
ground beside it are two small granite troughs. In this, as in all<br/>
the other rooms of the temple, the ancient pavement is in excellent<br/>
preservation. The rear of the court is separated from the adjoining<br/>
pronaos by stone screens, which are pierced by two large portals<br/>
and two smaller doorways. On the screen to the right (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PLf</span>) is a<br/>
relief of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">falcon-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ibis-headed </span>Thout pouring the water of consecration upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ring </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Neos </span>Dionysos, to the left of<br/>
whom is the crocodile-headed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sohek</span>, the lord of the right half of<br/>
the temple. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left screen (PI. <span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span>) the same scene takes place<br/>
<br/>
