</span>ing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">catafalque </span>above the vaulted tombs in which the deceased<br/>
are placed with due attention to the separation of the sexes. The<br/>
chapel is covered by a dome, the transition to which from the<br/>
square ground-plan is effected by means of a delicately articulated<br/>
intermediate <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>tapering gradually to an octagon. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the examples dating from the Fatimite period, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pendentives<br/>
</span>corresponding to the four <span style="color: #0000FF;">bevelled </span>angles of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intermediate </span>structure retain the large spherical niches borrowed from Roman and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Byzantine </span>models. These were replaced, under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aiyuhides</span>, by<br/>
several rows of prism-shaped niches, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally</span>, under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, by more or less complicated arrangements of <span style="color: #ff0000;">stalaetite-pendentives</span>. These last are formed by a system of gradually projecting<br/>
courses of stone, embellished by dwarf domes and niches exhibiting<br/>
a very great variety of <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile-outline</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest mosques seem to have had no <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minarets </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mixing</span>).<br/>
The earlier examples of these towers were square throughout, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tapering </span>upwards, and were covered by a simple conical roof. The later<br/>
examples are square at the base but assume a cylindrical <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>polygonal form in the upper stories, and are embellished with galleries<br/>
supported by <span style="color: #ff0000;">stalaetite-eornice8 </span>and with balconies; the top story is<br/>
formed of columns or pilasters bearing a roof consisting of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">domeshaped </span>protuberance. The minarets contain winding staircases, two<br/>
being sometimes arranged round the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">newel </span>for the convenience<br/>
of the blind men who are preferred as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mtsevutts </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mu'eddin</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxxvii</span>).<br/>
The wooden rods and hooks <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the galleries and top stories are used<br/>
for hanging up the lamps during the fasting month of Ramadan.<br/>
<br/>
Since the end of the 14th cent., following the example set by<br/>
the mosque of the Emir <span style="color: #0000FF;">GG </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Ytiseti </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain </span>(1366), every mosque<br/>
has possessed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebil</span>, or public fountain, except in cases when a<br/>
separate building is erected for this. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebils </span>are rooms with<br/>
bronze railings at which <span style="color: #0000FF;">passers-by </span>may obtain water. The upper<br/>
story of the sebil is a kind <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofloggia</span>, supported by columns and <span style="color: #0000FF;">COW</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ered </span>with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tent- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">roof</span>, frequently in elegant <span style="color: #0000FF;">timber- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture</span>.<br/>
This is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kuttdb</span>, or elementary school. The detached columns that<br/>
often embellish the exterior of these buildings differentiate them<br/>
from <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span>the other parts of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque-fagade</span>, in which columns<br/>
appear only built into the angles or immured in the masonry.<br/>
<br/>
Tombs. The tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sultans </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">emirs </span>and of their families<br/>
are invariably built in connection with mosques (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clxxxi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
other hand the Shaikh Tombs or tombs of saints (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">sci</span>), which are<br/>
found in all parts of the country, are independent structures, usually<br/>
built on the spot on which the revered deceased ended his days.<br/>
These closely resemble the mortuary chapels of the mosques and are,<br/>
like them, covered with domes. The ordinary tombs of the Moslems<br/>
are generally situated on high ground, beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iuiluenee </span>of the<br/>
moisture <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the river, and preferably in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">desert</span>. The subterranean<br/>
vaulted <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers </span>are generally large enough for four or more bodies<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
