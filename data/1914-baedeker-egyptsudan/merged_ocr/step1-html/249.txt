the place <span style="color: #0000FF;">Et-Kc'thim</span>. Its N. and its S. limits are to-day marked by<br/>
the Bib <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Futtrh </span>(p. 77) and the Bib <span style="color: #ff0000;">aneileh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>60) respectively.<br/>
In 973 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Main </span>took up his permanent residence in the new city of<br/>
Cairo. A new period of prosperity began under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aiyubides</span>.<br/>
Saladin <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to unite the still separated cities of Cairo and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fust√©t </span>by means of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">common </span>wall, which, however, was never<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>, and in 1179 he founded the citadel. Under his luxurious<br/>
and extravagant successors Cairo was greatly extended and <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieently </span>embellished, and in the 14th cent. it reached its <span style="color: #0000FF;">zenith</span>.<br/>
At that period, however, it was fearfully devastated by the plague,<br/>
as it had been on former <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasions </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">6.9. </span>in 1065 and in 1295 ] and<br/>
was also several times subsequently (especially in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1492</span>, when<br/>
about 12,000 people are said to have been carried off by it in one<br/>
day). The town suffered severely in other ways also, and indeed its<br/>
whole history, so far as recorded, like that of the sultans and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>themselves, seems to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>presented an almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">Coittinuous </span>succession of revolutions, rapine, and bloodshed. As most<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultans </span>who resided in the citadel died a violent<br/>
Math, so the reign of almost every new potentate began with bitter<br/>
and sanguinary contests among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">emirs </span>for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiee </span>of vizier,<br/>
while but few reigns were undisturbed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrections </span>in the<br/>
capital. During the third regime of <span style="color: #ff0000;">En-N0pir </span>(1293-1340), who had<br/>
been twice deposed and as often <span style="color: #0000FF;">recovered </span>his throne, a persecution<br/>
of the Christians took place at Cairo. The churches which had been<br/>
built in the capital and elsewhere were closed or demolished,<br/>
while the Christians themselves were so ill-treated and oppressed,<br/>
especially in the reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSultun </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sililt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ci351-50</span>, that many <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>them<br/>
are said to have embraced Islamism. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1366 </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1367</span>, in the reign<br/>
of Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">8luOtin</span>, sanguinary <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonflicts </span>took place in the streets of<br/>
Cairo between hostile parties of Mamelukes, and in 1377 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sha'ban<br/>
</span>himself was tortured and strangled in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citadel</span>. Even greater<br/>
disorders attended the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dethronement </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Barl.cN.t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">1389</span>), when<br/>
the wildest anarchy prevailed at Cairo, the convicts escaped from<br/>
their prisons, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">concert </span>with the populace plundered the houses<br/>
of the emirs and the public magazines. The following year another<br/>
rebellion among the Mamelukes restored <span style="color: #ff0000;">PrarlirUr </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">throne</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Scarcely</span>, however, had he closed his eyes and been succeeded by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Farag </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>1399), when the Mamelukes again <span style="color: #0000FF;">revolted </span>and renewed <span style="color: #ff0000;">00nflicts </span>took place <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>possession of the citadel, during which the city<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">partly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plundered</span>. Similar scenes <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>repeated on almost every<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">change </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>government. The turbulence of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamelukcs</span>, who<br/>
were always treated with too much consideration by the Sultans,<br/>
became more and <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>unbearable; they robbed the people in the<br/>
markets and assaulted citizens in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pyblie </span>streets.<br/>
<br/>
On Jan. <span style="color: #ff0000;">20th</span>, 1517, the Osman sultan Selim 1., after having<br/>
gained a victory in the neighbourhood of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIeliopolis </span>(p. 120), <span style="color: #0000FF;">ell-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tered </span>the city. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ttttrttht </span>Bey, the last Mameluke sultan, was taken<br/>
