<br/>
and colourless monuments erected here by the hand of man remind<br/>
the spectator<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>like the desert itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>of death and eternity. On<br/>
a bare plateau of rock stand the other pyramids, while the Sphinx<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">reposes </span>majestically on the sand. The arrangement of the extensive<br/>
burial-ground with its various streets of tombs is plainly seen.<br/>
To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, in the distance, rise the pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abusir</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salrlptra</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshtr</span>. To the N. are the palm-groves of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eerdiseh </span>and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>of the valley of the Nile. Towards the E., on the other<br/>
hand, glitters the river, on each bank of which stretches a tract of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rich </span>arable land, <span style="color: #0000FF;">luxuriantly </span>clothed with blue-green vegetation<br/>
and varying in breadth. The fields are intersected in every direction<br/>
by canals, on the banks of which stately palms wave their <span style="color: #0000FF;">flexible<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fsn-like </span>leaves. In the direction of Cairo runs the long straight<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage-road</span>. Immediately before us rises the Citadel with its<br/>
striking minarets, while the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohattam </span>hills, Which form the chief<br/>
mass of colour in the landscape, gleam in the morning with a pale<br/>
golden tint and in the evening with a violet hue.<br/>
<br/>
The descent of the Great Pyramid is hardly less fatiguing than<br/>
the ascent. Persons liable to giddiness may find it a little trying,<br/>
but the help of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>removes all danger.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">INTERIOR </span>(comp. Plan, p. 127)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A visit to the interior of the<br/>
Great Pyramid is comparatively uninteresting to the ordinary tourist.<br/>
It will be found fatiguing, and an interval of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rest </span>between the ascent<br/>
and this expedition is recommended. Travellers who are in the<br/>
slightest degree predisposed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">apopleetiis </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">fainting.fits </span>and ladies<br/>
travelling alone should not attempt to penetrate into these <span style="color: #0000FF;">stifling<br/>
</span>recesses. The explorer has to crawl and clamber through low and<br/>
narrow passages, which, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">plates</span>, especially near the entrance, are<br/>
not above 31/2 ft. high and <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>ft. wide. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>is often very slippery,<br/>
and the close air smells strongly of bats. The temperature of the<br/>
interior is nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">79o </span>Fahr. The attempts of the guides to <span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>the<br/>
visitor into inconvenient hurry should be disregarded.<br/>
<br/>
The Entrance (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. a) is on the N. side (as in all pyramids), <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the thirteenth tier of stones, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>perpendicular height <span style="color: #ff0000;">of49 </span>ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span>the ground. The long passage a r, which is only 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>4 in. in width<br/>
and 3 ft. 11 in. in height, descends in a straight direction at an<br/>
angle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pil</span>', and is altogether 106% yds. in length. We follow<br/>
this passage as far as the point d only, 20 yds. from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance</span>, the<br/>
end being filled <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>Here diverges the ascending passage <span style="color: #ff0000;">d </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e</span>, the<br/>
lower end of which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with massive blocks of granite, placed in<br/>
position after the interment of the mummy to protect the grave from<br/>
robbers. The hardness of the material of which this barrier consists<br/>
compelled <span style="color: #ff0000;">treasure-hunters </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">126</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>to avoid it and to force a<br/>
new passage (Pl. d) through the softer limestone. This is the roughest<br/>
and most awkward spot on the whole route. Beyond the granite<br/>
blocks we enter the passage (Pl. de), <span style="color: #0000FF;">41 </span>yds. in length, with a very<br/>
slippery <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span>, beyond which lies the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>.<br/>
