<span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">O'garre </span>(defaced) of Amenophis IV., upon which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sun'g </span>rays<br/>
descend.<br/>
<br/>
0n the hill above the Cataract Hotel is Fort <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tagug</span>, whence a<br/>
beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>is enjoyed, especially towards evening. Visitors<br/>
should prolong their walk along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill</span>, to the S., for the sake of<br/>
the views of the Nile valley, the islands, and the dam, and descend,<br/>
to the right, to the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Mrlia.t.ta </span>(p. 363).<br/>
<br/>
A ride (donkey or carr. there and back 5 pies.) may be taken to<br/>
the CAMP <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">BISHABiN</span>, situated within an Arab cemetery, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3/4 </span>M.<br/>
to the E. of the town. These <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>with their families live in<br/>
wretched tents covered with mats. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Abtbdeh </span>tribe,<br/>
differing both in type and dress from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishtrin</span>, also have tents<br/>
here. Both tribes speak a curious language, allied to Egyptian and<br/>
other E. African dialects. They support <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">cattle-rearing<br/>
</span>and by trading, especially with <span style="color: #ff0000;">senna-leaves</span>, which they collect in<br/>
the desert and sell <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>good prices. - A <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*View </span>is commanded<br/>
by the Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shaikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harlin</span>, above the camp, to the right.<br/>
<br/>
We may return <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">ARAB </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CEMETERIES</span>, which are<br/>
situated in the desert to the S. of the railway. From the railway<br/>
station these may be reached <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sherir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Shelltl</span>. Each grave<br/>
was marked by a rectangle of unhewn stones and a slab bearing an<br/>
inscription. The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the hills to the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the road are some large <span style="color: #ff0000;">mosqueJike<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cenotaph</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of famous saints, such as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hheikh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nayuuid</span>, the Sheikh'Ali,<br/>
<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lady </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Saiyideh</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zeinab</span>, etc., whose memory is celebrated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">festivals<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>their birthdays <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jiiiiiiri</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>etc.<br/>
<br/>
The Granite Quarries (Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">MrliOir</span>), from which the ancient<br/>
Egyptian builders and sculptors drew their supplies (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">354</span>),<br/>
are situated in the hills to the S., and may be reached in 1/4 hr. either<br/>
direct from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishirin </span>camp or from the town by a route leading<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">via</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>the Arab cemeteries (see above) and then to the E., passing<br/>
a grove of tamarisks. Numerous blocks of granite lie where they<br/>
were left when the works were given up; <span style="color: #0000FF;">thy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the huge block (marked<br/>
'Obelisk' on the Map) in the N. Quarry, measuring 92 ft. in length<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">low</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>ft. in breadth at the broadest part. A moderately lofty<br/>
cliff shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">stonecutters</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The blocks were detached from the cliffs by boring numerous holes along a prescribed line, driving wedges into these, and<br/>
then wetting the wedges. By this process tolerably smooth and<br/>
even fractures were obtained. Frequently the blocks were finished<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>three sides before being <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>detached. Statues, sarcophagi,<br/>
obelisks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, were also roughly dressed by the stone-cutters in the<br/>
quarries in order to lessen the weight for transport. The hill above<br/>
the N. quarry commands a wide prospect, including the convent of<br/>
St. Simeon (p. 361) in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-valley</span>, to the W., beyond the Nile.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>massive Causeway, by which the huge blocks were conveyed to<br/>
the Nile, <span style="color: #0000FF;">runs </span>from the quarries to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>and is used to this day.<br/>
