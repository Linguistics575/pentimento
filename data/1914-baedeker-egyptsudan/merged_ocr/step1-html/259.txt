second-hand books is not so strictly drawn in the East as in Europe<br/>
The booksellers generally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to refresh their memories regarding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">state </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their <span style="color: #0000FF;">stock</span>. The Koran, which<br/>
is shown very reluctantly to <span style="color: #0000FF;">uon-Moslems</span>, is kept separate from the other<br/>
books. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">books </span>are piled up in a very inconvenient fashion. Many of<br/>
them are sold in loose sheets, in which case the <span style="color: #0000FF;">purchaser </span>should see that<br/>
the work is complete, as gaps are of frequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurrence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The bindings<br/>
usually consist of leather or <span style="color: #0000FF;">pasteboard</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Valuable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">books </span>are often kept<br/>
in cases of red <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheepskin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The workmanship of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bookbinders</span>, who,<br/>
like other oriental artisans, work in the open street, is far inferior to<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>European productions. Red is their <span style="color: #0000FF;">favourite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colour</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

</span>We now follow the <span style="color: #0000FF;">She </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Azhar</span>, which leads to the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the main entrance of the Azhar Mosque.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gimi</span>' el-Azhar <span style="color: #0000FF;">JI</span>. E, 3, 4), the'most blooming', the most<br/>
important monument of the Fatimite period, was completed in 970<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">NU</span>. by <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Filter</span>, the vizier <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Fatimite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Murizz</span>, and here,<br/>
three years later, <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1-Mtfizz </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">offered </span>his first prayer after his entry<br/>
into Cairo. Admission, see p. 43; cameras are forbidden and the<br/>
visitor should carefully abstain from any manifestation of amusement or contempt. The mosque was converted into a University in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">988 </span>by Caliph <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-UW</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>(p. cxv). The rectangular ground-plan <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the original building, almost entirely rebuilt by the Emir Salar<br/>
after an earthquake in 1303, is easily recognizable, but it has been<br/>
so frequently restored that no part of it can be said to date actually<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>period except the central part of the sanctuary,<br/>
with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupolas</span>. Everything outside this rectangle is known positively to be of later date. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristic </span>old ornamentation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the arcades and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupolas </span>in the sanctuary deserves special attention;<br/>
that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>walls has been for the most part renewed after vanished<br/>
patterns. The arcades of the court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">galm</span>) were <span style="color: #0000FF;">rebuilt </span>under the<br/>
Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tauri</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>with scrupulous reproduction of the old style and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>retention of the old columns. - The successive rulers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
</span>have emulated each other in maintaining and enlarging this venerable building. In the 18th cent. the wealthy'Abd <span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Psaltrnhn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kihya<br/>
</span>added four aisles to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and in more recent days <span style="color: #0000FF;">sail<br/>
</span>Pasha and the Khedives <span style="color: #ff0000;">Taufils </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and'Abbis </span>ll. <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been notable<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">henefaetors </span>of the mosque<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAbbis </span>II. erected a new building in<br/>
place of the dilapidated N.W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">side </span>of the mosque, and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">neo-Arah<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fagade </span>is practically the only one the mosque boasts, the other sides<br/>
being all quite unpretentious and concealed in narrow lanes.<br/>
<br/>
The university is considered the most important in the territory<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam</span>. Before the British occupation the <span style="color: #0000FF;">average </span>number of<br/>
students was <span style="color: #ff0000;">7600-7700</span>, taught by 230 professors<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>After that<br/>
the numbers sensibly diminished, as no students came from the<br/>
former equatorial provinces of Egypt during the domination of the<br/>
Mahdi. In 1912, however, the numbers had again risen to <span style="color: #0000FF;">14,959<br/>
</span>students and <span style="color: #ff0000;">587teaehers</span>. Most ot'the students are natives <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt</span>,<br/>
so that the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">riwtlss </span>(p. 58; Upper Egypt, Lower Egypt,<br/>
Eastern Egypt) are <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">largest</span>, each <span style="color: #ff0000;">having </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">several </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hundredstudents</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
