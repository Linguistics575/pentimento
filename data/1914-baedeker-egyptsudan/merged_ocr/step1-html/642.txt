The Island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philse</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Philae, once the'pearl of Egypt', is 500 <span style="color: #ff0000;">yds</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>length and <span style="color: #0000FF;">160 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yds</span>.<br/>
in breadth, and consists of a crystalline granite mixed with <span style="color: #0000FF;">hornblende</span>, beneath the alluvial deposits of the Nile. The modern name<br/>
is borrowed from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creeks</span>, and is derived from the ancient Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi-lak</span>, or the'island of Lak'. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>called it <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pilakh</span>, Le.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">corner</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, and the Arabs used to call it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bilah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Now-a-days the island is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">El- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t'asr </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Geztret </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Anus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Wogtd</span>, after<br/>
the hero of one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tales </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thousand </span>and One Nights, which has<br/>
its scene transferred to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philee </span>in the Egyptian version<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The name Philae<br/>
is known to the natives only through its use by tourists<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">boatmen </span>relate it as follows<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Once upon a time there <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>king, who had a handsome favourite named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Woggd</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vizier</span>,<br/>
whose daughter was named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zahr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Ward</span>, Le. Flower of the Rose. The<br/>
two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found opportunities of meeting secretly, until they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>discovered through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imprudence </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">maiden</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>attendant. The vizier was violently enraged<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span>, in order to secure his daughter from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">further </span>pursuit of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">young </span>man, <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>her to the island <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Philar</span>, where he caused her<br/>
to be imprisoned in a strong castle (the temple of Isis) and closely<br/>
guarded. But Anas <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-World </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">could </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>forget his love. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">forsook </span>the<br/>
court and wandered far and wide in search of her, and in the course of<br/>
his travels showed kindness to various animals in the desert and elsewhere. At last a hermit told him that he would <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>Zahr <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Ward </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the island <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPhilte</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>He arrived on the bank of the river and beheld the<br/>
walls of the castle, but was <span style="color: #0000FF;">unable </span>to reach the island, for the water all<br/>
around it was alive with <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodiles</span>. As he stood lamenting his fate one of<br/>
the dangerous monsters <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>to convey him to the island on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>, out<br/>
of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness to animals. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lover<br/>
</span>was thus able to reach the prison of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">mistress</span>, and the guards suffered<br/>
him to remain on the island, as he represented <span style="color: #ff0000;">himselfto </span>be a persecuted<br/>
merchant from a distant land. Birds belonging to Zahr el-Ward assured<br/>
him that she was on the island, but he could never obtain sight of her.<br/>
Meanwhile the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lady </span>also became <span style="color: #0000FF;">unable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">longer </span>to endure her fate. Letting<br/>
herself down from her prison-window by means of a rope made of her<br/>
clothes, she found a compassionate ship-master, who conveyed her from<br/>
the island in which the lover she sought then was. Then <span style="color: #ff0000;">followed </span>another<br/>
period of search and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>the meeting of the lovers. A marriage, with<br/>
the consent of the father, ends the tale.<br/>
<br/>
The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPhila </span>does not occur in any of the earlier inscriptions, and even Herodotus, who visited <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>during his<br/>
journey on the Nile (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ca</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">450 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>.), makes no mention of this island.<br/>
The first mention of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila </span>dates from the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektamyhi5s<br/>
</span>tea. 350 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.G</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>; p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">cvii</span>), to which the oldest temple buildings on the<br/>
island belong. But there is little doubt that Philae was inhabited<br/>
and adorned with temples at an earlier period than that.<br/>
<br/>
The chief deity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>the goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isis</span>; but Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nephthys</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hath</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(p. 370), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>and Satet, the gods of the cataracts<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and other<br/>
deities were likewise worshipped here. The imposing buildings which<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lend </span>the island its <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristic </span>appearance were erected by the Ptolemies during the last two centuries <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0. </span>and the Roman emperors during<br/>
the first three Christian centuries. Numerous inscriptions inform us that<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ereek </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>Roman pilgrims <span style="color: #ff0000;">floeked </span>in crowds to the shrine of the mysterious, benign, and healing goddess Isis. We know also that the goddess of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>was worshipped hy the predatory <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians </span>and by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blemmyes<br/>
</span>(p. 386), and that, even after their <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>with the Emperor Marcian<br/>
