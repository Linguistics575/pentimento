<span>Construction. PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sizes</span>. 6. Route. 125<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>engraved on <span style="color: #0000FF;">ite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tea </span>years were thus consumed in making<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>and the subterranean chambers <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eofflns</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of the Pyramid <span style="color: #0000FF;">itself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied </span>twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">years</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Each of the<br/>
four sides measures eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">plethra </span>(820 ft.), and the height is the same.<br/>
It is covered with smoothed stones, <span style="color: #0000FF;">well </span>jointed, none <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>which is less<br/>
than thirty feet long. This pyramid <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>built in the form <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tlight </span>of steps. After the workmen had completed the pyramid in this<br/>
form, they raised the <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>stones (<span style="color: #0000FF;">used </span>for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>) by means<br/>
of machines, made <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">short </span>beams, from the ground to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>tier of<br/>
steps; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">after </span>the stone was placed there it was raised to the second<br/>
tier <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>another machine; for there were as many machines as there <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>tiers of steps; or perhaps there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>one machine, easily moved, that<br/>
was raised from one tier to the other, as it was required <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>lifting the<br/>
stones. The highest part of the pyramid was thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>smoothing), the parts adjoining it <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>taken next, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lowest </span>part,<br/>
next to the ground, was completed last. It was recorded on the pyramid,<br/>
in Egyptian writing, how much was spent on radishes, onions, and roots<br/>
of garlic fur distribution among the workmen and, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ifI </span>rightly remember<br/>
what the interpreter who read the writing told me <span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span>, the money they<br/>
cost amounted to sixteen <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">talents </span>of silver (upwards of <span style="color: #ff0000;">550,000L</span>).<br/>
If this was really the case, how much more must then have been spent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the iron with <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they worked, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the food and clothing of<br/>
the workmen.'<br/>
<br/>
In modern times many eager discussions have been held as to<br/>
the mode in which the Pyramids were erected and the meaning of<br/>
the account given by Herodotus. The most important questions<br/>
seem to be: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>) How could Kheops, when he ascended the throne<br/>
and chose an area of 82,000 sq<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>yards for his monument, know<br/>
that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>it? <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had died<br/>
in the second or third year of his reign, how could their sons or<br/>
successors, however willing to carry out the plan, have succeeded in<br/>
completing so gigantic a task and in erecting monuments for themselves at the same time? (3) And how <span style="color: #0000FF;">comes </span>it that many other<br/>
kings did not, like Kheops, boldly anticipate a reign of thirty years<br/>
and begin a work of the same kind, the design for which might so<br/>
easily have been drawn, and might so readily have been carried<br/>
out by his subjects? - To these questions <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erhkam</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fibers </span>answer.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Each </span>king', says Lepsius in his letters from Egypt,<br/>
'began to build his pyramid when he ascended the throne. He began<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small scale, in order that, if a short reign should be in store<br/>
for him, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span>might <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>a complete one. As years rolled on,<br/>
however, he continued enlarging it by the addition of outer coatings<br/>
of stone, until he felt that his career was drawing to a close. If<br/>
he died before the work was completed the last coating was then<br/>
finished, and the size of the monument was accordingly proportioned<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the length of the builder's reign.' - <span style="color: #ff0000;">This'layer-thenry</span>' of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>This causeway is still traceable<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It terminated <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>side <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pyramid </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Kheops (see Plan and p. 138).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>It is unlikely <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the interpreters, who attended <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">dragomaus </span>of the present day, were able to read hieroglyphics. They<br/>
probably repeated mere popular traditions regarding the pyramids and<br/>
other monuments, with embellishments and exaggerations of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">own</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
