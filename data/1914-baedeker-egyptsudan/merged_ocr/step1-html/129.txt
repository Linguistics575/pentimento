on the law of <span style="color: #ff0000;">primogenituro</span>, and in 1867 <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>was raised to<br/>
the rank of Khedive, or Viceroy, having previously borne<br/>
the title of <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span>, or governor of a province only. in 1869<br/>
the Suez Canal was opened (p. 184). In 1873 the Khedive obtained a new <span style="color: #ff0000;">flrman </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">confirming </span>and extending his<br/>
privileges <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>independence <span style="color: #0000FF;">oi'administration </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">judiciaries</span>;<br/>
right of concluding treaties with foreign countries; right<br/>
of coining money; right of borrowing money; permission<br/>
to increase his army to 30,000 men). The annual tribute<br/>
payable to the Porte was fixed at 133,635 purses <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">700,000t0</span>. The warlike successes of the Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">resulted </span>in the extension of his dominions to the borders<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahyssinia </span>and<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, to the 2nd parallel <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofN.latitude</span>. - The burden of the public debt had now increased<br/>
to upwards of 100,000,0001., one loan after another <span style="color: #0000FF;">having </span>been negotiated. The Powers brought such a pressure<br/>
to bear on the Khedive that he was compelled to resign<br/>
his private and family estates to the state and to accept a<br/>
ministry under the presidency of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ntbar </span>Pasha, with the<br/>
portfolio of public works entrusted to <span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">luignibres </span>and<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tinanee </span>to Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rivers </span>Wilson. This coalition, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">soon </span>proved unworkable; and early in 1879 the<br/>
whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">cabinet </span>was replaced by a native ministry under<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheri</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pasha</span>. The patience of the Great Powers was <span style="color: #ff0000;">new<br/>
</span>at an end<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and on the initiative of Germany they demanded from the Porte the deposition of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismiril</span>, which<br/>
accordingly took place on <span style="color: #0000FF;">June </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20th</span>. He died at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Constanti110p1e </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1895</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismi'il </span>was succeeded by his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfilr</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Turkish pronunciation), under whom the government was<br/>
carried on in a more rational spirit. The debts were <span style="color: #0000FF;">regulated</span>, an international commission of liquidation was<br/>
appointed, and an extensive scheme of reform was <span style="color: #0000FF;">undertaken</span>. In Sept., 1881, however<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>a military revolution<br/>
broke out in Cairo, which had for its chief object the<br/>
emancipation of Egypt from European <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences</span>. The<br/>
Khedive was besieged in his palace and had to yield; he<br/>
appointed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sherifpresident </span>of a new ministry and arranged<br/>
for an election of Notables, or representatives. As the<br/>
latter espoused the'national' <span style="color: #0000FF;">cause</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sherif </span>resigned in<br/>
Feb., 1882, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maluniid </span>Pasha formed a new ministry,<br/>
the soul of which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi </span>Bey, the energetic minister<br/>
of war. This cabinet at once proceeded, without receiving<br/>
the consent of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">khedive</span>, to pass several measures intended to diminish the European <span style="color: #ff0000;">iuih1enee </span>in the political and <span style="color: #ff0000;">flnancial </span>administration of the country.
