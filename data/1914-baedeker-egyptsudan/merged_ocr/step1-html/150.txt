<br/>
for the fragments, and wherever one was found she buried it and<br/>
erected a monument on the spot to its memory; and this accounts<br/>
for the numerous tombs of Osiris mentioned as existing in Egypt<br/>
and elsewhere. When Horus grew up he set out to avenge his<br/>
father's murder, and after terrible contests was at last <span style="color: #ff0000;">victoriomb</span>.<br/>
According to other accounts the combatants were separated by Thout.<br/>
They then divided the country, the S. of Egypt falling to Horus and<br/>
the N. to Seth. Osiris was afterwards magically restored to life by<br/>
Horns and continued to rule the W. land as king of the dead.<br/>
Among the Egyptians as with other peoples the speculations<br/>
about the origin of the world, the movements of the heavenly bodies,<br/>
and the alternation of day and night were closely bound up with<br/>
their religion. Their conception of the world reveals the limited<br/>
geographical horizon of the ancient Egyptians. They regarded the<br/>
earth as a huge oval plain, floating upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ocean. From one end<br/>
to the other it was traversed by a broad stream, the Nile, which<br/>
flows out of the ocean on the S. or rises from two springs near the<br/>
cataracts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutrn</span>. All around rose high mountains, and the sky<br/>
was pictured as a flat slab resting upon four mountains, with the<br/>
stars hanging from it like lamps. Another view was that the sky<br/>
had the same form as the earth, and was traversed by a river and<br/>
intersected by numerous canals; and under the earth there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">believed </span>to be an underworld, called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Twat</span>, which was exactly like the<br/>
sky and the earth and was peopled by the dead. After the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow-goddess </span>Hathor had become a goddess of the heavens (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxliii</span>) the<br/>
sky was sometimes conceived <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>as a cow, with the sun seated between its horns illuminating the world. Another view was that the<br/>
sun sailed in a boat by day on the cow, as on the ocean of the sky,<br/>
while the stars were represented on the body of the cow; Show, the<br/>
god of the air, stood below the cow of the heavens and supported it.<br/>
The sun and the moon, the principal heavenly bodies, were in<br/>
particular the subject of many theories, probably representing the<br/>
teachings of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>colleges <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">priests </span>throughout the country.<br/>
A very early idea represented the sun and moon as the eyes of the<br/>
great god who created the world. At the same time this great god is<br/>
no other than the sun-god He himself, so that we have the contradictory idea that the incorporation of the sun (Re) had the sun <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>an<br/>
eye. When Horus became a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span>the sun and moon were considered to be his eyes. In one way or another the eye of the sun<br/>
played a very important part in Egyptian mythology. It was thought<br/>
of as a sun and was transformed into an independent goddess proceeding from the sun-god. With this eye of the sun are identified<br/>
the serpent-goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buto</span>, of Lower Egypt, and afterwards other goddesses also, such as the lion-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tefnut </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cow-goddess<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor</span>. The eye of the sun was sometimes thought of as a poisonous<br/>
serpent (<span style="color: #0000FF;">means </span>serpent) rearing itself on the forehead of the sun-god<br/>
and breathing <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>against his enemies. This idea gave rise to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
