<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumstances </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">results </span>of which we are better acquainted<br/>
than with the history <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the other foreign immigrations; for, disregarding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beduin </span>tribes, who are entirely distinct from the<br/>
Egyptian population, we now meet with genuine Arabs in the towns<br/>
only, where the merchants<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>pilgrims, and other members of that<br/>
people form a class entirely distinct from the natives, and one that<br/>
is maintained only by means <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofreinforcements </span>from abroad. Another<br/>
proof of the transforming <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of the Egyptian climate is<br/>
afforded by the uniform character <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the domestic animals. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">osen</span>, in particular, though they have often been repeatedly exterminated in a single century by murrain, and have been succeeded<br/>
by foreign races from every quarter of the globe, almost invariably<br/>
after a few generations assume the well-known Egyptian type with<br/>
which the representations on the ancient temples render us so familiar.<br/>
There have been many hypotheses <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>to the origin of the Egyptians. In all probability the rise and development of that people<br/>
followed essentially the same course as those of other great races,<br/>
whose geographical positions exposed them to a similar variety of<br/>
external <span style="color: #ff0000;">infhlenees</span>. In the course of its history this people attained<br/>
a characteristic development of its own; but we have to inquire as<br/>
to the nature of the original prehistoric stock. In classical antiquity<br/>
the Egyptians were considered to be of African origin, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus<br/>
</span>has given expression to this view by quoting a tradition of the<br/>
Ethiopians, according to which the Egyptians were originally an<br/>
Ethiopian <span style="color: #0000FF;">colony</span>, just as their country itself is a product of the<br/>
Nile. But the Greeks and Romans knew little of Central Africa,<br/>
and, more especially, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">acquainted </span>with none of the peoples<br/>
of the Nile district except those whom we now distinguish as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hamitie </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">proto-Semitic</span>). The term <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilamites </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic </span>races is used to<br/>
distinguish that great ethnographic group of peoples which has, in<br/>
the course of ages, altered the population of half Africa, ever pressing from E. to W. and driving out the <span style="color: #ff0000;">primawal </span>population before<br/>
them. The final stage of this migration, which, like those of the<br/>
horse and camel, falls partly within the historic period, was reached<br/>
when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamites </span>came in contact with the later Semitic races.<br/>
When these <span style="color: #ff0000;">liamitic </span>peoples began to find their way from Asia<br/>
across the Red Sea into Africa, they no doubt pushed down the<br/>
Nile, after subduing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">primawal </span>inhabitants of the river-valley.<br/>
The Ethiopian tradition thus agrees with the Biblical, which describes <span style="color: #0000FF;">11am </span>as the father of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mizraim </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cush </span>- names under<br/>
which the ancient Hebrews used to personify Egypt and Ethiopia.<br/>
The civilization and culture of the Egyptians have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">sueeessively </span>affected by every race that has played a prominent part<br/>
in W. Asia, from the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babylonians </span>to the modern Arabs and<br/>
Turks. Maspero argues for a gradual <span style="color: #0000FF;">infiltration </span>from Libya also<br/>
in the earlier epochs. But the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Libyans </span>were themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic</span>,<br/>
no less than the Ethiopians who <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtook </span>them in their advance<br/>
