its disintegration. Egypt, indeed, at first stood out against them,
but even Egypt in the long run was unable to repel the tide of
b'e0ukiuflaeuee; and Turkish civilization penetrated to the Nile
under Saladin, who himself stood upon the ruins of the Seljuk
power. The religious reaction was accompanied by a change in
ecclesiastical architecture tp. clxxx), and the establishment of a
feudal system (very different indeed from the European system) coincided with a total alteration of all titles of honour. The traditions
of Saladin's epoch were carried on in all departments by the Mamelukes, whose influence is most eorrspiemms in Egypt; while the
continuous reinforcements from Central Asia conducted at the same
time to the growing accentuation of the Asiatic elements. The
Mongol invasion, which finally overthrew the Seljuk civilization in
Asia, came to a halt before the gates of Egypt. Egypt's brilliant
period ended only when she lost her political independence and
became subject to a foreign people from Central Asia, vis. the
Osman Turks (1517 ].

A glance over the historical development thus briefly sketched
shows at once why the Islamic civilization cannot properly be named
al'ter any particular nation; from the very first it was a hybrid civilization resting upon the international basis of religion. Yet amid
all the mingling of the various constituent elements, amid all the
confused shiftings of peoples, one unifying principle is clear: viz.
the steady growth of Asiatic Ideas. Ante-dating Islam, the process
had begun in a reaction against Greek intellectual supremacy and
lloman political dominion; European fetters were burst asunder and
shaken ott; and in the course of subsequent development both the
Near East and Egypt passed under the direct infhrenee of Asiatic
conceptions, first in the intellectual and finally also in the political
sphere. tut that accomplished, the vital ethnic force and the in-.
tellectual energy of Asia were exhausted. This is the true reason of
the striking decline of Islam under Osman rule. Its civilization
has culminated; strength fails it for a renaissance. At the present
day, just as in the Hellenistic period, the European spirit and European domination are pressing forward in the East. This western movement in the historical process will certainly be followed by an "eastern
reaction. In any case only the form and not the essence will be common to the East and West in the intellectual sphere so long as racial

the other continents also, including Australia. It is rapidly isxtendlug, especially in Africa. Almost the entire population of Egypt
(about 913/4 per cent) is Mohammedan.
