papyrus). Sometimes the column represents a single plant-stem,
sometimes a cluster of stems held together by bands; while the
capital imitates in turn the closed bud or the open calyx (Fig. 11).
Thus there arise four varieties of plant-columns: the simple plantcolumn with bud-capitals and the same with eaIyX-eapitals; and
the clustered plant-column with bud or calyx capitals.

Of the various Lotus Columns (which seem to have been freely
used if we may judge from the numerous pictures of them) comparatively few have been
preserved. Clustered trolumns of this kind with
bud-capitals occur during
the Ancient and Middle
Empires (in a tomb at
Benihasan), but appear to
have died out under the x
New Empire. The above- "E LI'
mentioned shaft at Beni- h I
hasan is formed of four l
round stems, rising from
around base, and fastened
together at the top by
bands (Firm). The capital is formed of closed l
buds, the green sepals of l
which extend quite to the i
top of the white petals of
the corolla. Near the top I I
of the shaft, between the
bands which hold the i J "J _,.,
main stems together, are
inserted smaller stems.
Examples of clustered
Iotus-columns with open [ calyx ] capitals (Fig. H) are frequently
seen in reliefs on tombs of the Ancient and Middle Empires; but
they occur most often in buildings of the later period.

The Papyrus Columns are mmh more numerous. They differ
widely from the lotus columns. The stems in the latter are circular
in section, while in the papyrus-columns they are triangular, and
moreover taper rapidly at the base, where they are encircled with
pointed leaves - characteristics that are wanting in the lotnscolumns. There is a difference also in the capitals, the sepals of
the lotus reaching to the upper edge of the flower (sec above), while
the leaves surrounding the nmbel of the papyrus are considerably
shorter. The simple papyrus-column with a bud-capital is seen only
in paintings and reliefs, whereas the clustered column is common
enough (Fig. IVa). The latter usually consists of eight stems held
