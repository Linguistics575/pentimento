430 _ 34. OMDURMAN. Arsenal.

The native town of Omdurman, which was the capital under the
new Mahdi regime, was founded in 1883-84 by the Mahdi Mohammed Ahmed (p. 427 ], and after his death in 1885 it was the residence of the Khalifa rAbdallah et-Tartishi for "years, during which
it became the scene of the most atrocious cruelties and the most
extravagant orgies. It extends for about 31/2 M. along the left bank
of the united Nile, and has room for upwards of100,000 inhabitants. The name is said to be derived from an old woman who
once spent a solitary existence here. The S. part is the Umm
ed-Durmfin proper. The central part, including the holy buildings
and the walled inner town inhabited by the Baggira (Balrlstra)
tribe, to whom'Abdallah belonged, is called by the natives El-Ba.hfa, in.'the (holy) p1aee', a name always given to the wandering
headquarters of the Mahdists. To the N. is the H & ret tm-Nayira
or el-Jle.siyin, the Christian quarter, inhabited by Abyssinians,
Copts, and Greeks.

The warlike oppression before 1899, the fanatical enthusiasm
for pilgrimages, the desire for plunder, and the devastation of whole
provinces have assembled here a confused medley of the most diverse
races and stocks: Bautus and grotesque dwarf negroes from the W.
SMin; Semitic and Hamitic tribes from the desert, such as Ntoa,
Bagg√©ra, Kabhabish, Gowameh, and Kowihleh Arabs; Nubians, Fellahin, Ja'ilin (p. 423). To these must now be added Egyptians,
Syrians, and a few Greeks. The sl10pkeepers are mostly Dougolese.
The fashions prevalent among the natives are very curious, such as
their methods of shaving, tattooing, and perfuming themselves, and
otherwise altering their personal appearance.

The steam-ferry lands its passengers at Abu Anga, near the large
and picturesque Mamda, or Boat Harbour, which is adjoined by
the markets for ivory, india-rubber, and grain. From this point we
may proceed into the town either by the steam-tramway (p.426) or
(preferably) by donkey. - Following the tramway-line, we cross one
of the markets (say) and reach the lofty walls surrounding the Beit
eL-Amiina (P1. 19; B, 2), the former arsenal of the dervishes, which
still serves as a military magazine and contains memorials of Gordon's
time and trophies of weapons. For a visit to it, which, however,
is hardly worth while, a permit must he obtained from the Assistant Secretary, Stores Section in Eharttsm (p. 429). The Prison
(PL B, 2), where many Europeans languished, is situated 500 yds.
farther E., at the S. angle of the ruinous town-wall. It is sometimes
known as the'Saier Prison', from the name of the jailor under the
Mahdi and Khalifa. - Farther on, to the left, is the JromamMn'lyell
or Guard House of the Sudanese, formerly the House of Emir Yak0b
(P1. 21). On the large Mosque Square (P1. B, 2), in which the dervish army was reviewed, lie (I.) the Zab.ttyeh or office of the ma'mtlr
(Pi. 22) and (r) the Mosque of the Khalifa, a large rectangular court
surrounded by a brick wall (comp. p. clxxviii).
