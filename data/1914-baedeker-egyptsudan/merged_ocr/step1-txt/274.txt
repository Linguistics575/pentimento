gardens. At our feet stands the mosque of Sultan 1Jasan. To the
N. and N.W. are the Windmill Hills and the green plain traverseg
by the Nile. To the W., in the distance, are the Pyramids, towerind
above the desert. On the flat roofs of the houses we observe innumerable ventilators, called mallgaf, by means of which the cool
north-wind is introduced into the houses.

The 1huff er1-NMir (P1. F, 6) was erected in 1317 by Sultan
En-Nis.ir. Long used as a military magazine and storehouse, it is
in a dilapidated condition. It exhibits traces of the Romanesque
taste on the exterior, particularly on the portals. The two curious
minarets are surmounted by bulbous cupolas adorned with brightcoloured fayence tiles in the Persian style. The sadly misused liwans,
in the construction of which some fine ancient Byzantine columns
were used, still retain their painted cassetted ceilings. The dome
in front of the prayer-recess rests upon ancient Egyptian granite
columns, but only the drum now remains.

The entrance to the barracks opposite the NE facade of the Gami
en- -Na.sir leads to the small Gami' Suleiman Basha (PI F16), also called
Sdryat or, Sisartyeh, on the E. side of the citadel, which was erected in
1528 by Suleiman, one of the Mamelukes of Sultan Selim. The architecture
is a mixture of Arabian and Turkish. The mosque contains Cutie inscriptions, marble mosaics, a decorated prayer-recess, and a pulpit in marble.
In the N. E. corner of the forecourt is the tomb of the saint yTru.

By skirting the ICE. and S. E. sides of the Giimir emNasir we reach
the so- -called Well of Joseph (3." 1mm; PL F, 6), a square shaft, with a
spiral passage around it, sunk in the limestone rock to a depth of 290 ft.
Within the shaft, at a depth of about 155 ft., is a platform on which the
oxen stood that brought the water to the Surface by means of a sakiyeh.
The well was sunk by Saladin to provide the citadel with water, but has
lost its importance since the completion of the new water-works. The
name is due to the legend that this was the well into which the Joseph
of Scripture was put by his brethren

A narrow lane leads from Joseph' 3 Well to the Bdb leGebel (PL F, ir,
'mountain-gate'), the S. main gate of the citadel, whence a road leads
straight to the Mokattam (p. 116). A road diverging to the right a little
farther on leads to the Monastery of the Bektashi (Deir et-2fagauriha
Turkish order of Dervishes, situated among green palms on a bare mountain- -slope (visitors admitted). [ The monastery may be reached also from
the Place Saladin via the narrow lanes between the Tombs of the Meme
lukes and the citadel.) An easy staircase ascends to a court, in which
are situated the residences of the monks. The garden in front commands
an admirable view of the city, the valley of the Nile, and the desert
From the court a dark cave (probably an old quarry) enters the mountainside, with the graves of dervishes. At the end is a chamber containing
the tomb of a sheikh, where worshippers are frequently observed. The
remains of a wife of rAbbas I. also rest here under an elaborate gilt tomb.

From the Bab el- Gebel a road leads to the S. to the Tombs of the Name.

We return to the Place Saladin (p. 68) and follow the Shari
Mohammed'Ali o. 62) to its intersection with the SHARI BL-HIL1.1111111 (P1. D, 5, 6). The latter street, along with its continuations,
the Shari cs- Siyufiyeh and the Shari Jdiiiiilliii' (P1. D, 6,7), forms
the main thoroughfare traversing E. Cairo from N. to S. (comp.p. 59),
