'XXV. DYNASTY (ETHIOPIANS; 7124353 BAL).

112-700. Shabako (Sabakon) assisted the smaller Syrian states Ulez
ekiah of Judah) against the Assyrians.

Sebichos (Shabataka).

Taharka (the Tirhakah of the Bible) also assisted the princes
of Syria and Palestine against the Assyrians t but was
defeated in 670 by Esarhadden, King of Assyria, and after

the capture of Memphis compelled to take refuge in Ethiopia. Both Upper and Lower Egypt became subject to the
Assyrians, the various local princes [ such as Neche of
Sais, etc.) becoming vassals of the invaders. Various attempts to expel the latter failed.

663. Tanutamun, son of Shabako, succeeded in recovering Egypt
for a brief period, but was finally defeated by the Assyrians and driven back into Upper Egypt.

The Assyrian rule in Egypt was, however, approachingits
end. The absence of the main Assyrian forces, which were
engaged in distant wars in Babylon and Elam, afforded
an opportunity of shaking off the yoke, which was seized
by Psammetichos of Sais, son of Necho [ see above), with the
help of Gyges, King of Lydia. The foreign garrisons were
expelled; the authority of the small native princes was
gradually curbed; and Egypt was again united. Since then
Ethiopia has been separate from Egypt.

q. Late-Egyptian Period (663-332 B.C.).
'XXVI. DYNASTY (633-525 Bi.),

Egypt new enjoyed another period of prosperity. Trade began to
flourish owing to the new relations with Greece. Art also received
a fresh impetus; even before the Ethiopian kings artists had begun
to imitate the models of the classic period of Egyptian art under
the Ancient Empire. This reversion to an earlier era appeared also
in other departments, such as literature, the spelling ofinscriptions,
and even the titles of oftieials, so that the period of the 26th Dyu.
may be styled the Egyptian Renaissance.

MBAi09. Psammetichos I. (Psametik), see above.

609-593. Necho (Nekaw). While the Assyrians were engrossed in a
deadly contest with the Babylonians and Medes Nacho
invaded Syria, defeating and slaying Josiah, King of
Judah, at the battle of Megiddo. The Egyptians were,
however, defeated at Carchemish by Nebuehadnezzar, King
of Babylon, and thus lost their possessions in Syria and
Palestine. - Necho began to constructa canal from the Nile
to the Red Sea, but was stopped by an oracle (p. 182).
