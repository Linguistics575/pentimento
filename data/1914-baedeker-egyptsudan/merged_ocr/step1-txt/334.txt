Matariyeh (Gr.- Hot. Matarieh) is an insignificant village, noteworthy only for its proximity to Heliopolis and for its possession
of the Virgin's Tree, an ancient sycamore, under which, according
to the legend, the Virgin and Child once rested during the Flight
into Egypt. The sycamore, planted after 1672, was seriously injured in 1906, but a shoot still flourishes and is now protected by
a railing. The garden in which it grows is watered by means of
a double sU.riyeh, supplied from a shallow reservoir fed by springs.
This water is drinkable, while that of all the other springs, which
percolates through the ground from the Nile, is usually brackish;
and this peculiar quality is popularly ascribed to the fact that the
spring was called into being by the Child Jesus. Adjoining the
garden is the Roman Catholic chapel of Notre-Dame de Matarieh.

From the garden the 8Mrir el-Misallrz (Chareh el JrassauaJleads
in 12-15 minutes to the obelisk and ruins of the famous ancient
Heliopolis (p. cxlv), or city of the sun, called On by the Egyptians. The latter name frequently occurs in the Bible. Thus, in
