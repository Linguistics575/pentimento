(In. f) diverging to the right, some 22 yds. in length, from which
another passage leads to the right, in a direction parallel with the
main corridor, but now built up. Opposite the side-passage we
pass over another sarcophagus by means of steps (P1. g) and thus
regain the door by which we entered the vaults. The temperature
in these subterranean chambers is always nearly 800 Fahr.

'I confess', says Mariette, in his report of the discovery,'that when
I penetrated for the first time, on Nov. 12th, 1851, into the Apis vaults, I
was so profoundly struck with astonishment that the feeling is still
fresh in my mind, although five years have elapsed since then. Owing
to some chance which it is iliftheu1t to account for, a chamber which had
been walled up in the thirtieth year of the reign of Ramses II. had escaped the notice of the plunderers of the vaults, and I was so fortunate as
to find it untouched. Although 3700 years had elapsed since it was closed,
everything in the chamber seemed to be precisely in its original condition.
The finger-utils of the Egyptian who had inserted the last stone in
the wall built to conceal the doorway were Mill recognizable on the
lime. There were also the marks of naked feet imprinted on the sand
which lay in one corner of the tomb-ehamher. Everything was in its
original condition in this tomb, where the embalmed remains of the bull
had lain undisturbed for thirty-seven centuries.'

Next to the Apis Tombs the private tombs (Mustabas, p. clxviii)
are the most interesting points at Sal: ira, though only a few are
Open to the inspection of tourists.

The most celebrated of them all, to the N.E. of Mariette's
House, is the *'Mastaba of Ti, dating from the epoch ot' the
5th l) yn., at the beginning of which the deceased Ti was a high
court-official and wealthy landowner. The building originally
stood above ground but it is now almost entirely sunk in the sand.
It was discovered and excavated by Mariette and has been restored
by the'Service dos Antiquit√©s de I'Egypte', as is recorded on a
tablet at the entrance. The mural reliefs, besides being interesting on account of their subjects, are among the finest and bestpreserved examples of the art of the Ancient Empire (comp.
p. Clxxiv).

From the street (Pl. A, p.150) we first enter the SMALL VESTIBULP.
(Pl. B), which contains two pillars (upper parts restored), on each
of which Ti is represented, in a long wig and a short, broad apron,
holding a staff in one hand and h kind of club in the other. On
the E. wall are several peasant women (PI. a), representing the
villages belonging to Ti, bringing food to the tomb; on the S. wall
are poultry and doves being fattened in a pen (PL b). The other
reliefs are obliterated.

We next pass through a doorway, the sides of which show figures
of Ti and inscriptions, and enter the GREAT COURT (Pl. C), an
extensive quadrangle, with a modern wooden roof borne by twelve
ancient square pillars (restored). This hall was the scene of the
offerings to the deceased. in the centre of the court is a flight of
steps LPI. o, by which we may descend to a low subterranean
