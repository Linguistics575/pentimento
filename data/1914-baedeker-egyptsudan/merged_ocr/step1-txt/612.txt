340 Route 21. 911.311. } 311. From Luxor

The route goes on to the S. from the Rank Chapel, sometimes
skirting the river-bank, sometimes leading through the ancient
quarries, which were probably exhausted during the Roman period.
It passes a number of roek-inseriptios and chapel-like recesses
(cenotaphs).

We first reach a rock facing the river, with three Memorial Inscriptions
upon it: to the left, Ramses IH. before Amen, Nut, and Khons; in the
middle, Shoshenk I. (Erector of the tablet) conducted by the goddess Nut
before Amen, llemkhte, and Ptah, while behind the king is his son,
Yewpet, high-priest of Amon-RE and general-in-chief-, to the right,
tamses IN., worshipping Amon, Mat, Khons, and Sobek.

Farther on is a Cenotaph Recess with a painted ceiling, on the left
dnnrrjamh of which is the praying figure of Thutmosis, scribe of the
treasure-house. Another Recess, with a ceiling finely painted with spiral
patterns etc., has the cnrtouuhes of Thutmosis Ill. and of Hatshepsut
(destroyed) on the lintel.

Farther to the s, close to the river, are three Cenotaph Recesses side by
side. The northernmost of these belonged tn Nekhbullin, royal scribe and
overseer of the gratuities of Upper and Lower Egypt; on the left wall is
a fine relief showing the deveased and a companion at table; on the rear
wall are three seated figures. - Another Tomb Recess, belonging to Amenetht, priest of Amon, has fine reliefs and well-preserved colouring;
in the rear wall appears the deceased, In whom attendants bring food and
drink, and an the side-wall; are the deceased and his wife Mimi, etc.

After skirting the bushy riser-bank for about 1/4hr. we reach the
Sour" Mos t ENTs, offering a picturesque appearance as seen from
the Nile. The chief of these are two Recesses Lcenotaphs) about 6 ft.
deep, which lie close beside each other. The architraves over the
entrances are adorned with concave corniees and Uramrserpents
and are borne by clustered columns. That to the N. (right) was constructed by Amenephthes (Merenptah), in the first year of his reign;
it represents the king sacrificing to Ilarakhte, Ptah, and the Nilegod (on the right), and to Amen, Mat, and lihons (on the left).
Beneath is a long hymn to the Nile and lists of offerings to be made
to the river-god. On each of the narrow side-walls are injured
reliefs of the king saerifteing to the gods. - The scenes in the S.
recess are repetitions of these, except that Amenephthes is replaced
by Ramses 11., who constructed the recess in the first year of his
reign. - tht the rock between these recesses is a door-shaped Stale,
on which King Amenephthes is shown presenting a fi, uriy of the
goddess of truth to Amen; the king is followed by a prince and by
the vizier Penehsi, who erected this stele to his master. - Farther
to the S. is another Stele, on which Amenephthes saerifipes to Amon,
while behind him is Roi, high-priest of Amen, who dedicated this
monument.

On a curious isolated sandstone rock, to the right, is a Stale of
the 6th year of Ramses m., showing the king sacrificing to Amen,
Harakhte, and the god of' the Nile. 0n the same rock, to the left,
appears a priest revering the names of Sethos I. - Farther to the s.,
and at a lower level than those steles, is another and much ruined
recess, dating from the reign of Sethos I. On the river-bank are
traces of an ancient flight of' steps descending to the stream.
