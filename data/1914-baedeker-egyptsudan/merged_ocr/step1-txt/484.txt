242 Route 16. AHYDOS. Temple. of b'ethos f,

On the left wall of the corridor we again meet Sethos and the
youthful Ramses. The father holds a eeuser in his left hand, while
the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skin, pours a libation on
the altar in front of him. The inscription contains a long list of
the names and shrines of gods whom Sethos and his son are here
honouring with saerifieial gifts.

In the centre of the right wall a door leads into a PASSAGE,
beyond which is a vaulted stone staircase, which led out of the
emple but was built up in ancient times.

The Relief: in the passage date from Ramses IL 011 the right wall the
king and a prince appear lassoing a bull in presence of the w0lf-iuurde6 god I
Wep-wawet. Farther to the left this animal is being tsaerifieed to the
god Wep-wawet. On the left wall Ramses conducts four sacred oxen to
Khons and King Sethos; farther to the left Ramses paces out the precincts
of the temple (comp. p. 306); names and four gods are netting birds;
Ramses and a prince offer the captured geese to Amon and Nut.

Annther door (now built up) in the right wall of the Kings' Gallery led
to the HALL OF THE Bums, a small chamber (now inaccessible) supported
by six columns and adorned partly with paintings by Sethns L, partly with
reliefs'en ei'eux' by Ramses II. The benches by the walls were probably
intended for the sacrificial gifts.

The other rooms of this S. Wing are all more or less in ruins.
From the s. end of the Kings' Gallery, where Coptic prayers have
been written up in red, we enter the SLAUGHTER COURT, surrounded
with seven columns, which was never completed. The sculptures
and hieroglyphics were sketched in colour under b'ethos, and only a
few of them were afterwards finished as reliefs'en "reux'. They
represent Sethos sacrificing. The scenes in the lower row depict the
slaughter and cutting up of sacrificial animals. The screen between
the first column and the left wall was intended to veil the proceedings in the court from the kings' Gallery.

Adjoining this court are four unfinished mums TI. A, B, C, D). In
the first three the designs on the walls are merely sketched in; in D they
have been completed in colour. - Of Rooms EH, which lie one story
higher, II anti ] are billed with rubbish, E-G contain unfinished representations dating from the reign of Amenephthes. - Beyond Room D, outside
the temple proper, lies a deep circular well.





Returning now to the second hypostyle hall, we may pay a brief
visit to the CHAMBER which adjoins it on the left and was dedicated
to Ptah-Soker, god of the dead at Memphis. The roof is supported
by three tree-trunk columns (p. 939). The fine reliefs show Sethos
revering Soker, Nefertem, and other gods.

Opening off' this chamber are two small vaulted chapels; that to the
right dedicated to Soker, that to the left to Nefeviem. On the left wall
of the former is a relief of Home and Isis by the bier of Osiris, on whose
mummy sits a falcon (leis); at the head and feet of the mummy are two
other falcons, with drooping wings. On the right wall are Isis and Horus
by the bier of Soker-Osiris, whose left hand is raised to his brow.

About 40 yds. to the W. of the temple of Sethos, and in the same axis,
lies a building constructed by Amenephthes in an artificial mound. The
main chamber is adorned with religious scenes This has been taken for
n Shrine of on I (Osireion), but is more probably a cenotaph of Sethns I.
Ecxavatiuns were begun here in 1911 by the Egypt Exploration Fund.
