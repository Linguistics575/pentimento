About 11/2 M. to the s. E. at Zakazik on the Tell bang, lie the ruins
of the ancient Bubastis (Egyptian Per-Base; the Pi-beaeth of Ezekiel xxx. 17),
the capital of the Bubastite nome. Some of the remains of the brick
wall: of the houses are of considerable height. The temple of Bastet, the
patron-goddess of the town, at the S.W. foot of the hill, was excavated
in 1887-89 by Naville, at the expense of the Egypt Exploration Fund;
but the remains (granite blscka, columns, architraves, ele., some with
inscriptions, and a few statues) are in too ruinous a state to repay a
visit. The temple, begun by the p.sramid-bnilders Kheups and Khephren,
underwent frequent alterations at the hands sf liamses ll. and other later
kings, but owed its final form to the munarchs of the 22nd Dym, who
resided at Bubastis, and to Nektanchis (Nekht Hat ehbet) At this period
it consisted of four large halls, of an aggregate length of 600 ft.; and
in these were celebrated the joyous and licentir-us festivals in honour of
Bastet.'When the Egyptians travel to Bnhastis Hays Herodotus'they
