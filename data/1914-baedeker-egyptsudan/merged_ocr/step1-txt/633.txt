solstice, thus proving that Syene was situated under the tropic (which,
however, has now shifted somewhat to the S.). The report of its existence
led the learned Athenian Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.), attached to the Museum
at Alexandria (p. 13), to the discovery of the method of measuring the size

hands of the hiennuyes tp. 364), but became the seat of a Christian bishop,

Arab authors record that no fewer than 20,000 inhabitants died of the plague

close of the 12th cent. Assuiin suffered severely from the incursions of plundering Arab tribes, finally put a stop to by a Turkish garrison stationed

The landing-place of the steamers lies on the river opposite the
railway station. Thence the attractive Shari" el-Buhr, or riversidestreet, skirts the Nile to the N., passing the principal public buildings, the Summary Tribunal, the German Stuitin Pioneer Mission,
the Grand-llétel Assouau (beside a rock with inscriptions), and
the Mttdirtyoh or Government Buildings. Opposite the last a ruined
building, for which stones of earlier buildings have been used,
projects into the river. This, known to the Arabs as El-Hammc'un
(the bath) and as the Bath of Cleopatra, probably dates from the
Roman period and seems to have been a lock or a téte-de-pont.
Farther on rises the lofty minaret of the chief mosque, beside which
the Shirir el-Mehkemeh diverges on the right for the bazaars; then,
as we descend the river, we pass the Police Office (Markus), the
National Bank, the St. James Hotel, the Post Office, the Guvernment Hospital, and the Roman Catholic Church, with the school of
the Catholic Shdau Mission. Across the river appears the hill with
the rock-tombs and the Kubbet el-Hawe (p. 360). In the highly
picturesque inner town are the large Coptic church and the Coptic
school. - To the S. of the railway station the road leads to a hill,
now laid out as a public garden (view), with the ruins of the socalled Kay el-Mula (probably a content) and a sheikh's tomb. Opposite, on the E. side of the road, stands the English Church, built in

Coptic church, with a dome. The font is a gift of Queen Victoria.
Farther on the road reaches the Cataract Hotel.

Among the ruins of the ancient city to the E. of the station lies

of the Roman period, is an inscription of the reign ofAmenophis IV. t to the
