reliefs by Queen Hatshepsut. As in all other places, the names and
figures of the queen have been scratched out or replaced by those of
Thutmosis u. or Thutmosis 111. In the S. half are a room containing
a staircase leading to the roof, and a chamber with a granite altar
dedicated by Thutmosis III. Here is also a fine statue of Amenophis ll. (sitting beside a damaged flgure of Amen).

The Relief: of Queen Hatshepsm, in a room to the N. shut off by a black
granite door (key with N. Legrain, p. 264), are very fine and have retained
their colour well. The left wall, which originally adjoined the N. wall
of the second record hall, was removed thence and re-erected here.

We now descend to the E. to an open space, strewn with the
scanty relies of the earliest Temple ofthe Middle Empire. In front
of the chambers of Thutmosis m., which may he recognized on the
N. side, ran a path, on which the Pharaohs erected statues to the
grandees judged worthy of that honour. - We next reach the
Great Festal Temple of Thutmosis 111. We enter by the main portal
on the S.W. (PI. a), in front of which stand two statues of the king
as Osiris (the left one only complete) and the stumps of two sixteensided columns. We turn to the left, traverse the antechambers,
and find ourselves in the Great Fatal Hall, which has the aisles
and is 144 ft. wide and 52 ft. deep. The roof of the three central
aisle, which were higher than the others, was supported by 20 celumns in two rows and 32 square pillars. The tent-pole shaped
columns (p. clxi) are unique, and indicate that the architect conceived the central aisles as forming a huge festal tent. The pillars,
not so tall as the columns, were of the same height as the outer
walls and with the latter supported the pentagonal roofing slabs of
the lower side-aisles. At the same time they were prolonged to the
same height as the columns by means of imposts and architrave, in
order to assist the columns in supporting the roof of the central
aisles. The reliefs on the pillars show Thutmosis m. in presence
of the gods. The hall contains several torsos of statues found there.

At the S.w. corner of the hall is the chamber (P1. c) in which was
found the so-called Karnat- Table of the Kings, a list of the Egyptian monarchs from the earliest times down to the 18th Dyn. (transferred in 1813

to the Bihlioth√©que Nationale in Paris). The statues of the ancient kings
which were carried in procession by the priests were probably kept in
this room. - On the N. side of the three central aisles lie three Chapels;
the one on the W. (Plur) contains a colossal group ofThutmosis Ill. between
Amen and Nut. - From the N.W. corner of the hall we pass through an
antechamher (P s) into a narrow corridor, the N. side of which is adorned with fine reliefs: Thutmosis III. offering incense to the ithyphallic
Amen; the king pouring water over Amen, while on the right priests and
singing men and women approach; the king pouring water on an altar
in presence of Amen and burning incense. From the me. angle of the
Festal Hall a flight of steps ascends within a tower-like structure to a
chamber which was perhaps used for astronomical purposes and still centains an altar. - The rooms on the E. side of the Festal Hall are in a
very ruinous eonditiom On the N.E. is a chamber with two pillars, and
adjoining it lies a dilapidated chapel with a large granite altar. - The
central door in the E. aisle leads into three chambers, of which only the
lower part of the walls is now left. Adjoining, on the N., and reached by
steps, is a SMALL loom, with its roof supported lay d clustered papyrus
