Temple of Ms. Plume. 24. Route. 367

brick wall. It is embellished with reliefs of Ptolemy (on the lintel)
and Tiberius (on the jambs).

The *Ascrtwr or THE PXLON is recommended. The winding staircase
begins in the SE. angle of the forecourt (see Plan, p. 365). Several unadorned
and feebly lighted chambers are found within the towers. The view
from the top commands the whole island and its surroundings.

We now pass through the central gateway, within which, to the
right, is a French inscription Can 7 de la r√©publique') commemorating
Napoleon's Egyptian campaign and the pursuit of the Mamelukes
by General Desaix in 1799.

The Forecourt, which we next enter, is bounded on the S. by
Pylon I and on the N. by Pylon II. On the E. and W. are tydifices,
each with a colonnade on the side next the court.

On the W. (left) is the BIRTH House, dedicated to JIathor-1sis
and to the memory of the birth of her son Horus (comp. p. 250).
It is reached also by a doorway in the W. tower of Pylon I (see
p. 366); on the back of the pylon is a relief of four priests carrying
the boat of Isis, preceded by the king burning incense. The Birth
House is surrounded on all four sides by colonnades, the columns
of which have Mral capitals surmounted by sistrummapitals. The
columns on the W. side are unfinished. The walls, the columns, and
the stone screens between the columns are adorned with the conventional reliefs and inscriptions, mostly dating from Euergetes Il.,
Neos Dionysos, Augustus, and Tiberius. The reliefs in the last
chamber are especially interesting: Horus as a falcon in the marshes,
Isis suckling Horus in the marshes of the Delta, and other scenes
from the childhood of the god.

The EAST BUILDING, opposite the Birth House, was occupied by
the priests, partly for seientifio purposes. The eolonnade of plant
columns is very elegant. The reliefs and inscriptions date from Neos
Dionysos, the votive inscription on the arehitrave from Euergetesll.
At the N. end of the eolonnade is a Door (Pl. o, approached by
several steps, opening upon the inner passage round the temple.
The reliefs upon this show Neos Dionysos before the gods.

The Second Pylon is 105 ft. broad and 40 ft. high. The Portal
between the towers was embellished by Euergetes II. with reliefs
of the usual type. The large relief on the right tower represents the
Pharaoh Neos Dionysos dedicating the slaughtered sacrificial animals
to Horns and Hathor. Above are two small reliefs: on the right, Nees
Dionysos presenting a wreath to Horus and Nephthys; on the left,
Neos Dionysos offering incense and pouring water upon an altar, in
presence of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. The granite of the site at the foot
of the tower has been smoothed to form a stele, with a six-lined inscription and reliefs relating to a grant of lands made to the temple
of Isis by Philometor in the 24th year of his reign (15713.0). In
front of it are the foundations of a small Chapel (Pl. m) .--. _ On the
left tower are similar scenes (figures deliberately defaced). On
both towers are grooves for the flag-staffs.
