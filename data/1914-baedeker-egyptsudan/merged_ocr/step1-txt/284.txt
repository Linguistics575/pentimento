The "Egyptian Museum (Muséc Egyptiqn du Caire, Arab, ElAtuikkMaelU, containing Egyptian and Greek antiquities found in
the valley of the Nile, lies in the Shirir el-Antikkhéneh el-Godideh,
not far from the Kasr en-Nil Bridge. Founded by the French Egyptologist Aug. Mariette (1821-81) in 1857 and originally housed at
1mm, the Museum was greatly enlarged by later directors (thoaut,
De Morgan, Loret, and especially Maspero) and is by far the largest
and most important collection of its kind. Its growth is steady and
rapid, owing to the regular archaeological enterprises of the Egyptian
Department of Antiquities, to purchases, and to the proceeds of
foreign excavations, half of which have to be surrendered to the
Museum on request. - The present Director (and also DireetorGeneral of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities) is Sir Gaston
Maspero; the Conservators are Emil Brugsch-Pusha, A (tmed-Bey
Ii'umal, and G. Daressy. - General Catalogue (Y/aide to the Cum)
