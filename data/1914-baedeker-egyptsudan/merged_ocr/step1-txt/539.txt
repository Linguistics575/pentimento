two colossal statues of Thutmosis 111.; in front of the easternmost
of these stands the lower part of a large obelisk of Thutmosis Ill.

The East Tower in front of the N. fagade is adorned with a figure of
Osiris (on the front of which is an inscription of Ramses IL added at h
later date) and a colossal statue of Thutmosis lil. On the West Tower are
(enumerated from left to right) a colossal statue of Thutmesis III. with
the double crown, an Osiris figure of the same (its head on the ground
before it), a seated figure of a king of the Middle Empire, a seated figure
of Sehek-l1otep, a statue of Amenophis Ir, and the left half of a memorial
inscription of Haremheb.

Beside Pylon VII is a modern door, by which visitors usually
quit the temple-precincts (comp. p. 26-1) in order to inspect the reliefs on the S. exterior walls of the great hypostyle hall (p. 272).

Beside the easternmost of the two walls which unite Pylon VII
with Pylon VIII lies (to the left) a small ruined Chapel dating from
the reign of Thutmosis III. (in peripteral form; p. clxiii). Farther on,
on the same wall a representation (1' ] .c) of Ramses Ir. sacrificing.

Pylon VIII is in comparatively good preservation, although it
was built by Queen IIatshepsut and is thus the most ancient part
of the entire building. Hatshepsut's names were removed from the
reliefs by Thutmosis Ir. Sethos I. restored the reliefs which Amenophis IV. (p. 255) had destroyed; but in many cases he inserted his
own name instead of replacing those of the ancient kings.
