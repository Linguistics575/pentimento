is often used (e.g. at Karnak) for the insertion of windows with stone
tracery. Beyond the hypostyle hall lies the innermost Sanctuary, a
comparatively narrow and deep chamber. This contained the image
of the god, usually in a sacred boat, which was borne by the priests
in processions. Only the king or his representative, the high-priest,
might enter this chamber and'look upon the god'. When the
temple, as, e.g., the sanctuary of Ramses III. at Karnak (p. 267),
was dedicated to a triad of gods, the sanctuary of the chief god
(Amen) was flanked by the chapels of the other two (Hut and
Khons). Chambers of various sizes used for religious rites or for
the storage of temple property surrounded the sanctuary; staircases
led to the roof and to various rooms, which either served as dwellings
for the temple watchmen and servants or were used in the celebration of particular ceremonies, etc.

This form of Egyptian temple, which recurs in most of the larger
sacred buildings of the New Empire and lingered until after the
beginning of the Ptolemaic period, closely corresponds with the
ground-plan of the early Egyptian house or palace previously described. The open court of the house, accessible to every visitor, is
represented by the great temple-court; the pronaos of the temple
corresponds to the vestibule, the colonnaded (hypostyle) hall to the
broad hall of the dwelling; and the deep hall in which the master
of the house spent his time finds its analogue in the sanctuary, the
dwelling-plate of the god. And just as these apartments in the
dwelling-house were adjoined by chambers and rooms for various
purposes, so the sanctuary in the temple was adjoined by a series of
small apartments, store-rooms, etc. Thus the temple was literally
what the Egyptians called it, the House of the God.

In many temples the colonnaded hall is further separated from
the sanctuary by one or more Smaller Halls (with or without col Â»
unms) "narrower proportions and diminishing in height. Frequently also the sanctuary is followed by several other halls and
chambers; and not unfreqnently the temple proper is preceded by
two colonnaded courts instead of by one. The particular purposes of
all these various rooms are in most cases hard to determine.

Though many temples, such as the temple at Lusor and the
great temple of Anion at Karnak, exhibit a much more complicated form than that just described, the explanation is that they
were not built on one uniform plan but owe their construction to
various builders. In the descriptions of the particular temples concerned this matter is treated with due attention to detail.

Occasionally the nature of the site compelled further deviations
from the above-deseribed form. In Lower Nubia the sandstone cliffs
approach so close to the bank of the Nile that the temple had to be
partly or wholly constructed in the rock, the necessary rooms being
hewn out. At Gerf-Husein Cp. 394) the court is built as usual,
while the colonnaded hall and the sanctuary are hewn out of the
