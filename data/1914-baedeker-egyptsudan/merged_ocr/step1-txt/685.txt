windings of the Nile. During the Mahdist insurrection Korosko was
of considerable strategical importance and was held by a strong
garrison; now, however, the forts and barracks are deserted and
many houses are in ruins. In the valley behind the town is a
British cemetery with the graves of British soldiers. - The traveller may ascend (3,4-1 hr.; steep and stony) the hill of Awas

The E. bank of the Nile between Korosko (p. 398) and Armenna
(p. 403) is the most fertile portion of Nubia. The belt of cultivable
land along the river is enmparatively broad; and it is irrigated by
means of water-wheels Csilsiyeh) of curious construction, worked by
oxen. - Beyond Kerosko the Nile valley trends to the N., so that
the N. wind which prevails in winter frequently retards the sailingboats. On the l? bank is 5 M.) Abu yarrdut (steamboat station ].
On the W. bank lies the district of Areilea (Ehlliqu), in which, near

Thutmosis ill. and Amenophis IL and was extended under Thutmosis IV. The figures of Amen, which were defaced by Amenophis IV., were restored by Sethos I. In Christian times the temple
was used as a church and the reliefs were covered with whitewash,
which has had the effect of preserving the original colouring, as we

governor of Ethiopia under ltamsesH.- Beyond the pylon extended
originally a court enclosed by brick walls, while at the back stood a
