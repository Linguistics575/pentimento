The Egyptians consider themselves a highly musical people. The
Egyptian sings when indulging in his keif (i.e. dolce far niente), whether
sitting on his heels or stretched out on his mat, when driving his donkey,
when carrying stones and mortar up a seaColding, when working in the
fields, when at the sakiyeh and when rowing. He sings whether alone
m- in company, regarding his vocal music as a means of lightening his
labour and of sweetening his repose. A peculiarity of the Egyptian songs,
however, is that they have no tune, though they have a certain rhythm,
which is always dependent on the text. They are sung through the nose,
on seven or eight different notes, on which the performer wanders up and
down. The character of this so-called music is exceedingly monotonous
and, to a. European ear, displeasing. The songs (mawwdl or slauglel) are
generally of :1 lyrical, religious, or erotic description, though some of
them extol the pleasures of friendship and rational enjoyment, or express
derision of an enemy ur contempt for the rustic fellah. - 0011111'The
Songs of an Egyptian Peasant', by fr. Sclm'fer (English edition, Leipzig, 1904),

FEMALE SINGERS ('Atvélim, sing. Mlmeh; Le.'learned women')
of a good class are now very rare and perform only in the harems
of wealthy natives. - Good FEMALE DANCERS, or Cr'hatviizi (sing.
Ghdziyeh), were formerly one of the chief curiosities of Egypt, but
are now rare; the performances in the cafés ehiintants in Cairo are
very inferior. - The SNAKE CHARMERS (rlifirtveh, sing. 1tiftfi;
p. sci) exhibit performances of a very marvellous character, as
credible European residents in Cairo have testified; but the traveller will rarely come in contact with them except by lucky accident. The men and boys who exhibit small snakes in the streets
or at the hotels must of course not be confounded with the Rite iyeh.
- The performances of the BUFFooNs (sing. Haw?) are disgracefully indelieate.

Shadow Plays (Kha'iy61 ey-WO, formerly among the most popular spectacles in Egypt, the history of which can be traced hack
to the 13th cent., are still to be met with, though seldom, in the
larger towns, especially Cairo (comp. p. 42) and Alexandria.

The Kim 1111111, with his little stage of wood and canvas, may he
seen at the'm ids' (comp. pp. xcvi), important weddings, and in a
few cards. The plays, of which the most frequently performed are the
Comedy of the Convent flfh ed-deir) and the Comedy of the Ship (lib elmarkilO, are rather coarse, or even slightly indecent, farces in artificial
and long-winded verse. The figt1res are cut out of coloured translucent
leather an d, by means of small wooden sticks, are pressed against an illuminated cloth in front of the stage, so that their shadows are visible on
the other side of the cloth. The entertainer, generally supported by
several assistants and musicians, recites the text of the play while moving
the figures about by means of the sticks.

Arab Baths. The baths of Egypt, with their hot-air chambers,
are those commonly known as Turkish, but they are neither so clean
nor so well fitted up as some of those in the larger cities of EuroPe.
They are therefore seldom visited by Europeans. Those who wish
to try them once should do so early in the morning, and should
avoid Fridays, as numerous Moslems bathe on that day, which is
their Sabbath. When a cloth is hung up at the entrance to the
baths, it indicates that 11 omen only are admitted.
