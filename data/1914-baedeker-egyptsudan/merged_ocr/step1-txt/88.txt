were a simple continuance of previously existing elements of civilization, an advance to a kind of syneretisrn among the varied eivilizations of the Near East, and the spread of the Arab tongue and
the religion of Islam.

By-and-by the people that was nationally the strongest and
the most advanced in culture within the wide empire of the caliphs
began to assert itself. That people was the Persians, whose eivilization even in pre-Islamic days had permeated the Near East and
was, indeed, the chief factor in orientalizing it. It is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of the Persian element in
Islamic civilization, which is so often erroneously spoken of as
Arabian. If we are to connect that civilization with the name of
any one people, it must be with the name of the Persians; for all
the notable achievements of the period of the caliphs, the sumptuous buildings, the works of literature, even the higher developments of the religion of Islam, are utterly mr-Arabian and, so
far as they are not inspired by Greek intluenees, are due to the
Persian spirit. Only the domain of law, so intimately connected
with the beginnings of a religion, betrays the stamp of the Prophet's native land. The decisive ascendancy of the Persians is apparent enough in the facts that the Arabic language never established itself on Persian soil and that under the Abbaside caliphs
it was a matter of course that court and government, architecture
and literature, should be modelled after ancient Persian patterns.
Moreover, when the separate provinces developed into independent kingdoms, it was the Persian rulers alone that followed local
traditions, while, e.9., the Tnlunide Sultans of Egypt could only
imitate the Persianized Baghdad and the residence of the caliphs
at Samarra. Even the civilization of the Fatimite empire was
thoroughly Persian.

The transference of the imperial residence from Damascus to
Baghdad heralded a new era, and the Arabian military aristocracy
was simultaneously changed into an absolute despotism on the
ancient oriental pattern. This was the natural consequence of the
deposition of the Arabs as a ruling caste [ pt lxxxi). The Arab
aristocracy of birth was superseded by a bureaucratic aristocracy
of Persian offieials, the free warriors sank into the condition of
paid troops, and were finally replaced by an army of slaves.

With these slaves, who were a constantly growing factor in the
Islamic world from the 9th century onwards, the third great national
element powerfully affecting Islam enters upon the scene The
Turks, appearing at first in groups of slaves but afterwards as strong
tribes from Central Asia, introduced fresh traditions and new forms
"iuto the empire of the caliphs. This third phase in the development of Islam begins with the appearance of the Seljuks, the most
powerful of these Turkish tribes. The union of the empire had
long before begun to crumble, but the Seljuks for a time postponed
