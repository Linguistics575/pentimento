338 Route 21. SILSILEII. From Luxor

On the W. bank, 1/4 hr. above El-tIto and about 3/4hr. below
Silsileh, is a gorge known as Shatt er-Rigiueh ('Shore of the Men',
or es-sabra riyiilels,'the seven men'), which was perhaps the startingpoint for an ancient caravan-route through the desert. On the left
side of a cliff here, a few paces from the river-bank, is a most
interesting Relief representing the homage of an inferior king Entef
before King Neh-hepet-rrs Mentuhotep 111. (11th Dyn.) and before
the king's mother Yoh. Behind Entef is an official named Kheti. On
the same cliff-Gee, farther up in the valley, occur representations
and inscriptions from the Middle Empire and the beginning of the
Now Empire. - On the W. bank to the S. of Shatt er-'dgtleh are
other rock-inscriptions and quarries.

89 M. 1mm; (El-Kagog). On the river-bank, about 2 M. to the
SW. of the station, lie the extensive Quarries of Silsileh, worked
especially under the New Empire. The largest quarry is closed by a
gate, which the keeper will open. In the reign ot'Ramses IL no fewer
than 3000 workmen were employed here for the Ramesseum alone.
An Inscription of Amenophis III. records the transport of stones by
the Nile for a temple of Ptah. There are two Posts of the time of
Sethos 1., Demotic Inscriptions from Roman times, and an unfinished
colossal Sphinx (near the river-bank). - At the N. end of the quarries are found the scanty ruins of the ancient town Khenit and its
temple (fragmentary inscriptions of Ramses 11.). To the E., towards
the top of the rock, is a stele of AmenoPhis IV., recording that
Amenophis caused an obelisk for the temple of the sun at Karnak
to be quarried here.

To visit the more important monuments, situated on the W.
hank, we ferry to the steamboat landing-place, whence we turn to
the N. The well-beaten track skirts the river, passing a number of
small tomb-like recesses (cenotaphs) and memorial tablets. Beyond
some quarries we reach the
*Rock Chapel (Speos; unlocked by the keeper), which was hewn
in the rock under Haremheb, last king of the 18th Dyn., and in the
following centuries was embellished with inscriptions and reliefs of
great artistic as well as historical value in honour of kings and high
officials. In front are five doorways, separated from each other by
pillars (PI. a-d) at varying distances, and crowned with the torus
and concave cornice. We enter by the middle door, on the lintel of
which are chiselled the sun-disk and the names of Haremheb. The
interior consists of a wide but shallow vaulted hall (Pl. A), at the
back of which is an oblong room (Pl. B). All the walls are covered
with carving and inscriptions.

On the 8. Wall (PLf) is a tine relief of a goddess uttering the breast
tRe Haremheb, while Khnum stands behind her and Amon-RE behind

On EIthe Rcar Wall, at PL l, to our left as we enter, is a'Relief of
King Haremheb returning in triumph from his campaign in Ethiopia. The

Pharaoh is seated on his throne, which is borne by 12 soldiers adorned
with feathers. Behind and before him are soldiers with the long-handled
