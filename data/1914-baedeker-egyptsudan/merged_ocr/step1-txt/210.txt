1. HISTORY AND TOI'OGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ALEXANDRIA.

Alexandria was founded in 331 B.C. by Alexander the Great
and forms a magnrifieent and lasting memorial of his Egyptian campaign. He conceived the plan of founding a new and splendid Seaport town in Egypt, both to facilitate the flow of Egypt's wealth
towards Greece and the Archipelago, and to connect the venerable
kingdom of the Pharaohs with that widely extended Greek empire which it was his great ambition to found. The site chosen
was opposite the island of Pharos, near the ancient Egyptian village
of Rhakotis, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Mareotie Lake
(p, 27), which was connected with the Nile by several navigable
channels. The choice was both judicious and far-seeing. For the
older and apparently more favourably situated harbours at the E.
end of the Delta were exposed to the danger of being choked by the
Nile mud, owing to a current in the Mediterranean, beginning at the
Strait of Gibraltar and washing the whole of the N. African coast.
Deinocrutes, the architect, was entrusted with the planning and
building of the new city. After Alexander's death, when his empire
was', divided among his generals, Ptolemy f. Sum (323-285 11.00

Alexandria became a great resort of artists and scholars, including
Demetrius Phalereus, the orator, who suggested the foundation of
the famous library, Apelles and Autiphilus, the painters, Euclid,
the mathematician, and Erasistratus and H erophilus, the physicians.
This Ptolemy founded also the Museum o. 13), a splendid pile de-.
dicated to science and poetry, in which scholars dwelt as well as
studied and taught.

Notwithstanding the continual dissensions among the Ptolemies
with regard to the succession to the throne (p. cviii), which seriously disturbed the peace of the city, the fame of Alexandria, as
the greatest centre of commerce in the world and the chief seat of
Greek Jearning, steadily increased, and it had reached its zenith
in 48 Ill., when the ilomans interfered in the quarrels of Clem
palm and her husband and brother PtolemyXIV. After the murder
of Pompey at Pelusium Caesar entered Alexandria in triumph, but
was attached by the citizens and the army of Ptolemy AW. and
