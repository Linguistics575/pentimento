Gemi el- Irkkim (','3) ,1) egnu in OOO, 011 the plan of the
Mosque of 11111 11111111 1 (1). I71), by Caliph El-'Aziz, and completed
by his son EI-Iiiikim in 1002-1012. It was seriously damaged by the
earthquake of 1303, but was restored soon afterwards by Beybars H.
Under the French it was used as a fort. It now lies in ruins, with
the exception of the sanctuary, which has a modern ceiling. The
two minarets, at either end of the W. wall, are noteworthy. Originally round, they owe their present cubical shape to a surrounding
wall, built at a later date. In the case of the N. minaret, which is
incorporated in the town-wall (see below), the finely carved marble
windows and the Fatimite inscriptions in its original lower portion
may still be identified. The dome-shaped tops, resembling Arabian
ineense- burners (mabkhara), date from the above-mentioned restoration.The N. minaret commands a fine view.

At the end of the Shin" Bib el-Fntuh rises the Bah el-Fatrilt
tPl. E, 2), or'Gate of Conquests', which is connected by the ancient
iii-Tail with the Bib en-Naer (P1. 111,2), or'Gate of Victory',
165 yds. to the E. (reached by the Shirir el-Kassasin). These
two gates form the strong N.E. extremity of the old city-fortiiieations. Together with the mosque of Caliph Hakim, situated
between them (see above), they formed a strong position for the
troops of Napoleon in 1700. These solidly built gates are, along
with the 133111 Zuweileh (p. 60), the only survivors of the sixty
gates in the Fatimite walls of Cairo erected by the vizier Bad: clGamili at the end of the 11th century. Their plan resembles
that of ancient Roman gateways. Each has an outer and an inner
gate, flanked by square or round towers and united by means of a
vaulted inner court.

The *AseENT of the towers and town-wall is highly recommended
(min 2 pies.) We tirst ascend the B111) en-Nasr, on which an old
gallows is still standing, then walk along the wall, the battlements
of which are partly preserved, to the Bah e1-Futtoh, beyond which
the wall is continued for some distance. The view ranges over the
city and, on the W., to the Tombs of the Galiphs and the Gcbei elAlunar (p. 115). The return to the Bitb en-Naer should be made
through the casemates, the finely jointed masonry of which includes
blocks (some inscribed) from carly-Egyptian buildings.
