HISTORY OF CAIRO. At a very remote period a city lay on the
E. bank of the Nile, opposite the great pyramids, and was called by
the Egyptians Jrhere-ohe, or'place of combat', because Horns and Seth
were said to have contended here (p. cxliv). This formed a kind of
suburb of Heliopolis. The Greeks named it Babylon, probably in
imitation of the Egyptian name of the island ofRocla, viz. Per-ham-mOn or the'Nile City of On' (Heliopolis). The citadel of this town

headquarters of one of the three legions stationed in Egypt. In 641
A.D. Babylon was captured by'Amr ibn el-U.s, the general of Caliph
Omar, who established a new capital of the country to the N. of the
fortress, extending as far as the Gebel Yeshlrtsr (p. 71). This, named
Fus.tlt (Lat. fossatum == surrounded by trenches), was, like Egypt
itself also called Miser or New el- Fustét by the Arabs; its present
name of Old Cairo (Man elvhttya or May el- Kadimch) was of later
introduction. A mosque was built on the site of the conqueror's
tent. When, after the fall of the Omaiyades in 750 A.D., Fustet,
with the exception of the great mosque, was burned to the ground
a new residence was built still farther to the N. by the Abbaside
governors, and around this sprang up the new quarter of El-'Askar.
The town was extended to the N.E. as far as the base of the citadel
by Armed ibn Tum", who erected the quarter of El-irayi'iVlrayrfyeli). Aluned's splendour-loving son Khuméraweih embellished
the town with lavish magnificence. The modern city of Cairo was
founded by Géhar, the general of the Fatimite Caliph Muizz, after
the conquest of Egypt in 969 A. D. m erected a residence for the
Caliph and barracks for the soldiers commanded by him to the N.
of El-I.fatih". At the hour when the foundation of the walls was
laid the planet Mars, which the Arabs call Kahir or'the victorious',
