on the site of Chemmis or Panopotis, which was the capital of a
separate name The Egyptians named it Epu and also thnte-Min,
after its god, the ithyphallic Min (p. cli), whence proceed the Coptic
Shmin and the Arabic Akhmim.

Herodotus (ii. 91) distinguishes the citizens of Chemmis as the only
Egyptians who favoured Greek customs and relates that they erected a
temple to Perseus, worshipped him with Hellenic rites, and held games
in his honour. The citizens claimed Perseus as a native of their town
and told the garrulous Halicarnassian that he had visited Chemmis, when
on his way to Libya in pursuit of the Govgon's head, and had recognized
them as his kinsmen. A statue of him stood in the temple. From time
to time the hero revisited Chemmis, leaving, as a sign of his presence,
a sandal, two cubits long; the tinding of this was considered a portent of
good fortune. - Strabo mentions the weavers and stone-cutters of Panopolis.
- Chemmis still flourished in the Roman period, and its ancient and
famous temple was finally completed in the 12th year of Trajan. After
Christianity established itself here the vicinity of Panopolishecame crowded
with convents. Nestori us Bishop of Constantinople, who had been banished
to the oasis of 1rhtrzish (p. 379) on account of his disbelief in the divine
motherhood of the Virgin Mary, was attacked there by the plundering
Blemmyes and carried captive into the Thebaid, where he surrendered
himself to the prefect of Panopolis, to avoid a charge of wilful flight. He
died in Poopo1is-A1clunha tea. MO). Even after the conquest of Egypt
