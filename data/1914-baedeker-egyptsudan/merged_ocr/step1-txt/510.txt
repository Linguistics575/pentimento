256 Route 90. THEBES. History.

the period of the Ptolemies still attest. The town of Ptolernais
(p. 221), founded and endowed with many privileges by Ptolemy 1.,
soon became the capital of Upper Egypt, and rapidly proved a
dangerous rival to the ancient metropolis. For a brief interval
Thebes, though politically and economically weakened, recovered
its independence under native princes, by putting itself at the head
of the revolt in Upper Egypt under Epiphanes against the Macedonian domination. But the rebellion was speedily crushed and
Thebes once more reduced to the rank of a provincial town. Its
decline steadily continued and the great city gradually became a
mere congeries of villages. Under Ptolemy X. Soter H. it again rebelled, but after a siege of three years was captured and destroyed.
In spite of its evil fate it once more revolted, taking part in the
Upper Egyptian insurrection in 30-29 13.0. against the oppressive
taxation of the Romans. Cornelius Callus, the prefect (p. ox), overthrew the rebels and utterly destroyed the town. Strabo, who visited
Egypt in 24 B.O., found only scattered villages on the site of the
ancient city. Thenceforward Thebes is mentioned only as a goal of
inquisitive travellers, who under the Roman emperors were attracted
to the Nile by two monuments in particular - the pyramids and
the musical colossus of Memnon on the W. bank at Thebes.

The introduction of Christianity and the edicts of Theodosius
were followed by the destruction of many pagan statues and the
obliteration of many pagan inscriptions. The Nile, which annually
overflowed as far as the temple of Karnak, and the saline exudations
of the soil wrought harm; many tombs were converted into peasants'
dwellings; Christian churches and convents were erected in the
temple-halls, and houses were built between the columns of the
temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removed
from the monuments, which were used as quarries, and many limestone details were thrown into the furnace and reduced to lime.
