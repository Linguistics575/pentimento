Ixii n. GEOGRAPHICAL AND b. Modern Egyptians:

(JO. ARMENIANS AND JEWS. This section of the community is
somewhat less numerous than the last. The Armenians generally
possess excellent abilities and a singular aptitude for learning both
oriental and European languages, which they often acquire with
great grammatical accuracy. They often hold high positions in the
service of government, and many of them are wealthy goldsmiths
and jewellers.

The Jews (38,635 in 1907) are met with almost exclusively in
Cairo and Alexandria, and can hardly be reckoned as among the
natives of the country. Most of them are from Palestine, though of
Spanish origin, but many have recently immigrated from Roumania.
The latter are popularly caller ]'Shlekhti', in reference to the barbarous German idiom they speak. Most of the money-changers in the
streets (Â§arrdf), and many of the wealthiest merchants of Egypt, are
Jews, and notwithstanding the popular prejudice entertained against
them, they now form one of the most highly respected sections of
the community.

(10). EUROPEANS. The number of European residents and
visitors in Egypt was 147,220 in 1907, inclusive of the British army
of occupation. The Greeks are most numerously represented, then
the Italians, British [ including Indians and Maltese), French, Austrians [ including many Dalmatians), Russians, and Germans. Besides these nationalities, there are also a few representatives of
America, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia, and
other trountries.-The Greeks ofall classes are generally traders. They
constitute almost entirely the aristocracy of Alexandria, and, at the
other end of the scale, nearly all the small inn-keepers and vietualdealers { balt-Znil) in other towns are Greeks. The oigarette-industry
also is almost exclusively in the hands of Greeks. They are the
proprietors of the small steam-mills that abound in the villages, and
of the numerous small banks which lend money on good security,
both to the peasantry and the government-officials, at a rate of
interest sometimes amounting to 0 per cent monthly, the maximum
permitted by law. The Greeks are the only Europeans who have
established themselves permanently as merchants beyond the (ymflnes
of Egypt proper. Almost the entire trade with the Egyptian Stadin is
now in their hands. of recent years many Creeks have been active
as physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, and especially landowners, but they are conspicuous by their absence from the government-service. The Greeks have also the unenviable notoriety of
committing numerous murders, thefts, and other crimes, but it must
be borne in mind that they are by far the most numerous section of
the European community (62,973 in 1907), and that most of them
belong to the lowest class of immigrants. The commercial superiority of the Greeks to the Orientals is nowhere so strikingly manifested as in Egypt, where it affords a modern reflex of their ancient
success in colonization.
