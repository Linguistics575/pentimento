3. The Temple of Sethos I. at Kurna.

From the landing-place of the ferry-boat on the W. bank we
ride first in a southerly direction, then pass between the hamlets of
Naga' er-Rizlgeh and Naga' el-Ba'trit to the FÃ©diliyeh Canal, which
we cross to the N. at Naga' et-TM, where a light railway (for conveying sugar-cane) approaches it. In about 3/4 hr. we reach the
*Temple of Sethos L, which was founded in honour of Amen
by Sethos L, and at the same time was devoted to the worship of
the king and of his father, tainses I. Sethos left it unfinished and
Ramses II.'renewed' it, Le. embellished it with reliefs and inscriptions. The beautiful execution of these recalls the contemporary
sculptures at Abydos (p. 238). The original building was 518 ft. in
length, but of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 154 ft. in depth, remains, while there are but scanty
relics of the former courts and pylons.

The Colonnade ou the front of the temple originally displayed
10 clustered papyrus-columns with bud-capitals, but only S are now
left. On the architrave is the dedicatory inscription of Ramses II. In
its inner wall are three doors (Pl. a, b, i), which lead into the three
divisions of the temple. On this wall, to the left of PI. b, are representations of the provinces of Upper Egypt (a man and woman alternately), bearing dedicatory gifts; to the right, similar reliefs of the
provinces of Lower Egypt. The former have lilies on their heads,
the latter papyri - the floral emblems of the two regions. Above
the former the king offers incense to the bark of Amon carried by
priests; above the latter the king appears before various deities.

Passing through the middle door (PL b) we enter a Hypostyle
Hall with G papyrus-bud columns, flanked on each side by three
chambers (PLd-i). On the, slabs of the roof of the middle aisle appear
the winged sun-disk, flying vultures, and the names of Sethos 1.,
between two vertical rows of hieroglyphics. The low reliefs on the
walls show Sethos l. and Ramses IL sacrificing to various deities.
Those at Pl. 0. and at Pl. fl represent respectively Nut and Hathor of
Dendera nourishing Sethos. - Side Chambers. Chamber g is ruined;
the ceilings in Chambers d, f, and h are in good condition. The
finely executed reliefs in Chambers e, f, h, and i depict Sethos J.
offering sa0rifices or performing sacred ceremonies in presence of
various deities. In Chamber i: on the left wall, Thout before the
sacred bark of the king; on the right wall, (left) the king seated at
the banquet with the goddess of the temple behind him, and (right)
the king in priestly vestments performing ceremonies before himself; on the rear wall, the king as the god Osiris, seated in a chapel,
surrounded by other' gods. In Chamber d are sunk reliefs of Ramses H., showing (right) the king pacing off the temple (comp. p. 306)
before Amen and Amunet, and (left) the king burning incense
