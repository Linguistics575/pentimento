Alexandria, called fslcartderieh by the Arabs and Turks the seeond town of Egypt and one of the most important oornmereia1 cities
on the Mediterranean, is situated at the W. extremity of the Nile
delta, on the narrow sandy strip separating Lake Mareotis from the
sea, in E. long. 20" 5ty and N. lat 51°13'. In 1007 the population
amounted to 332, 240 (now estimated at 400,000), of whom about
60,000 were Europeans J'ranks), ehiefly Greeks (24, 600) and Italians
(15,015), but including also some Britons, French, and Austrians,
and a few Russians, Germans, etc. The Mohammedans live chiefly
in the N. and W. quarters of the city, the Europeans in the E. quarter
and at Ramleh. The town has a governor of its own (p. xlvii).

Alexandria has two HARBOURS. The Port Est, or E. harbour,
known in antiquity as the'Great Ilarbour' and then sheltered by
a massive mole, is new accessible only for fishing-boats. It is surrounded by quays (see p.'10). The Port Ouest, or W. harbour,
originally named Eunoxtos or'llarbour of the Safe Hetum', was not
freely used until the time of the later Roman emperors. Since
1371 it has been enlarged by the addition of all Outer Harbour,
aver 1700.1111-' in area. This is protected by a breakwater nearly
2 M. in length, constructed of solid masses of masonry. A second
pier, or Mole, nearly 1000 yds. in length, protects the InnerHurbour,
which is about470 acres in area and on an average'281't.deep. From
