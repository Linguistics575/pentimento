368 Route 24. PlllL/li. Temple of Isis.

An inner staircase ascends to the W. tower (camp, the Plan), whence
we proceed across the central portal to the E. tower. The ascent, however,
is not worth making except when the first pylon is inaccessible.

Within the doorway, at the top, to the right, are some much
faded early-Christian pictures.

The Temple of Isis proper, entered by this portal, consisted of
an open court (here very small), a vestibule or pronaos, several
antechambers, and a sanctuary, with smaller chambers adjoining.
The walls are covered both outside and inside with reliefs of Ptolemies (Philadelphus, Euergetes ll,, etc.) and Roman emperors (Augustus, Tiberius, Antoninus) performing the customary ceremonies
in the guise of Pharaohs; but the traveller will find detailed deeCIiptions ofsimilar scenes in our accounts of thetemples ofDendera
(p. 245) and Edfu (p. 314 ].

The Court had a small colonnade on each side, the roof of which
rested on a single column. The uncovered portion could be shaded
from the sun by means of a velarinm; the holes for the cords are
still visible in the upper part of the concave cornice turned towards
the second pylon.

The Vestibule, with eight columns, was originally separated
from the preceding court by stone screens between the first row of
columns. The colouring of this hall, which has been preserved on
the ceilings and the columns, must have been very brilliant. The
floral capitals of the columns both in the court and in the hall are the
most instructive of all the specimens that have come down to us of
the manner in which the Egyptians of the later period coloured their
columns. Comparatively little regard was paid to the natural colours;
rig. light green palm-twigs receive blue ribs, etc. Christian services
were celebrated in the court and vestibule, of which the numerous
Coptic crosses chiselled in the walls are memorials. A Greek inscription in the doorway to Room D, on the right, records that'this
good work' took place under Bishop Theodorus. That was in the
reign of Justinian (p. 365).

The small Antechambers (PLD, E, F) preceding the sanctuary
are adjoined by chambers lying in darkness. The Sanctuary, which
has two tiny windows, still contains a pedestal placed here by Euergetes I. and his wife Berenice, on which stood the sacred boat with
the image of Isis.

The other rooms in the inner part of the temple do not repay a visit.
Room: 7111, VII, and 71 contain fine large reliefs of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
some of which retain their vivid colouring. The small Court in which Baerifiees used to be made is embellished with reliefs of Philadelphus saerifieing and pouring water upon an altar. There are cellars beneath all these

rooms and the sanctuary, but the ceilings and floors have in many cases
fallen in.

To the W. ofAntechamber D is a small room (Pl. 1), embellished
with representations of the king before Isis. A door (P1. it; see
p. 369) here affords an exit from the temple. Here also is the approach to the STAIRCASE, ascending first to a chamber situated above
