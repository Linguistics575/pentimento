The head of another colossal Statue of Ramses 11., found in 1816, is
now in the British Museum.

The Second Court is entered through a gap in the wall to the
right of the colossus. It is in much better preservation than the
first court, and is mentioned with its caryatides in Diodorus's description of the tomb of Osymandyas. On all four sides were colonnades; those to the right and left (N. and s., almost wholly destroyed) had two rows of papyrus-bud columns, while those on the
front (E.) and back (W.) had each one row of square pillars with
statues of Osiris, that on the back having also a row of papyrus
bud columns. The W. colonnade or vestibule is raised on a kind
of terrace. Four of the Osiris-pillars in front are still extant, and
also four at the back. On the shafts of the columns and the sides
of the pillars are representations of Ramses Ir. sacrificing to the
gods. The figures of Osiris, most of which are headless, likewise
represent Ramses II.

The part of the front wall which is still standing is now supported on the side next the court by modern brick buttresses. Upon
it are two rows of interesting reliefs, bearing traces of colouring and
easily distinguishable with the aid of an opera-glass. Those in the
Lower Row once more refer to the Hittite war and commemorate
Ramses Ir.'s great exploits at the Battle of Kadesh. The king (to
the left), much larger than the other warriors, dashes along in his
chariot. The Hittites, pierced by his arrows or trodden down by the
horses, fall in confused heaps; crowds of them are hurled into the
Orontes. Farther to the right appears the battlemented fortress of
Kadesh, round which the river flows. Beside it, on the other side
of the river, are Hittite troops that have had no share in the battle;
some of them hold out helping hands to their drowning comrades.
The Upper Row contains scenes from the Festival ofMin (the harvestgod), which was celebrated when the king ascended the throne
(p. 325). To the left stands the king, awaiting the procession,
which is headed by priests carrying the images of the royal ancestors. Two tall poles erected in front of the king bear the god's
headdress. Adjacent are priests letting four birds fly, for the purpose
of carrying tidings to the four quarters of the globe that the Pharaoh
has attained the crown; to the right the king appears cutting a sheaf
with a sickle for presentation to the god.

This second court also contained colossal statues of the king.
