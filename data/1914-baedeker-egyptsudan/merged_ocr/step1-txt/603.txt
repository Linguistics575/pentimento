The Northern Colossus is the famous vocal statue of Memnon. To
the left of the king stands his mother Met-em-wee, to the right his
wife Teye; a third figure, between the leg 5 has been destroyed. On
each side of the seat two Nile-gods were represented in sunk relief,
twining the representative plants of Egypt (papyrus and lily) round
the hieroglyph for'to unite', a symbol of the union of Upper and
Lower E Tt.

Attention began to be directed to the Musical Phenomenon connected with the colossus about the beginning of the Roman empire, after it had been broken. When it became known that the N.
colossus emitted a musical note at sunrise, a new myth was invented to explain the fact. Memnon who had fallen at Troy appeared as a stone image at Thebes and greeted his mother lies
with a sweet and plaintive note when she appeared at dawn. The
goddess heard the sound and the morning-dews are the tears she
shed upon her beloved child. If' the sound was not heard, it was
taken as a sign that the god was angry. Strabo, who is the first
author to mention the phenomenon, expresses doubt as to its
genuineness; but Pausanias and Juvenal (p. 354) accept it as a
fact. The phenomenon ceased altogether after the time of Septimius
Severus, who caused the restoration of the upper portions, perhaps
with a view to propitiate the angry god. The restoration was not
very skilfully managed, with five courses of sandstone blocks.
Attempts have been made to explain the resonance of the stone as
due to the splitting off of minute particles from the surface, caused
by the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the cold nights. A
similar phenomenon has been observed elsewhere.

The numerous Greek and Latin Inscriptions, in prose and verse, inscribed upon the legs of the figure by travellers under the Roman empire,
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than on
the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the
foot of the statue. The earliest was carved in the 11th year of the reign
of Nero, the latest in those of Septimius Severus and Caracalla, and the
most numerous (27) in that of Hadrian. only one Egyptian (who is responsible for a short demotic inscription) is found among these seribhlers. The inscriptions were for the must part the work of men ofsome
eminence, including 8 governors of Egypt, 3 epistrateges of the Thebaid,
2 procurators, etc. A large number, though not all, are dated. Many of the
great officials who visited the marvels of Thebes were accompanied by their
wives. The colossus was frequently dumb, in which case the visitor
usually waited until a more favourable occasion. Some were so struck
with the phenomenon that they were not content till they had heard it
three or four times. Hadrian (130 A.DO spent several days here along
with his wife Sabina and a large retinue. In his reign a perfect flood of
Greek verses spread over the legs of the colossus, most of them by the
court- -poetess Balbilla. One of her eiNsions (on the left leg) relates in
12 hexameters that Memnon greeted Hadrian, as well as he could (u):
aumdv) when he perceived the emperor before sunrise, but that, a clearer
note, like that caused by a blow on an instrument of copper, was emitted
at the second hour, and that even a third sound was heard, so that all
the world could see how dear the emperor was to the gods.

By far the best verses are those on the front of the pedestal by Asklcpiodotus, who calls himself imperial procurator and poet. They may
be translated as follows:
