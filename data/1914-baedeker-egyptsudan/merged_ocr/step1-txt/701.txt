The Auglo-hlgyptian Siidkn (pp. xlvi, cxxiv, cxxv), occupying
an area (984,520 sq. M. including Darfiir) approximately equal to
that of Central Europe, extends from a line drawn at Fares (p. MI),
below wads Halfa, on the N., to the arm parallel of latitude on
the S. It includes the fourteen provinces (Mhdiriyeh) of Balnel- Ghastst (capital, Wan), Berber (capital, Ed-Dimer), Blue Nile
(capital, Wad Medani), Dongola (capital, Merowd), Haifa, Ka ssala,
khar.tttm, Kordofdn (capital, El-Obe'fd), Nuba Mountains (capital,
Talodi), Mongalla, Red Sea (capital, Port Sudan), Senndr (capital,
Singa), Upper Nile (capital, Kodak), and White Nile (capital, EdDueim). The population is now nearly 3,000,000. The British
and Egyptian flags fly side by side in the Strilin, and the rights of
the joint possessors are defined by a convention signed on Jan. 19th,
1899. The interest on the Sturin war-loan is guaranteed to the
British Empire. The cost of the civil administration is borne by
the Shl" an, which, until 1913, was assisted by a subvention from
the Egyptian government. Egypt bears the main cost of the army,
but the Btsdtm also contributes to its maintenance. Several regiments
of the Egyptian Army are stationed in the Sildin, and a detached
body of the British Army of Occupation in Egypt is quartered at
Khart.t1m, under the command of the Sirdir. The Governor-General
(Arab. Hakim'Arn) and 5mm of the Egyptian Army is a British
officer (since 1899, Lieut.-Gen. Sir Reginald Wingate, formerly
chief of staff to Lord Kitchener), appointed by the Khedive on the
recommendation of the British government, without whose consent
he may not be dismissed. The Marlin (p. xlvii ] of the provinces
