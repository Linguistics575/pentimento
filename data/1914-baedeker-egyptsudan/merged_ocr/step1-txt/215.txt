however, paganism received its death-blow, and Theophilns, the
patriarch of Alexandria, displayed the utmost zeal in destroying
the heathen temples and monuments. It was at this time that the
famous statue of Serapis was burned. The material prosperity
of the city also fell off so greatly that the municipality was no
longer able to defray the cost of cleansing the Nile and keeping
the canals open. The revenues of Alexandria were still further
diminished by the proceedings of the patriarch Cyril, who led the
armed mob against the synagogues and expelled the Jews from the
city; and in 415 the learned and beautiful pagan Hypatia, daughter of the mathematician Theou, was cruelly murdered by an infuriated erosrd. Under Justinian 3) all the still existing
heathen schools were finally closed.

111619 Alexandria was captured by Chosroes ff., hing of Persia,
but the Christians were left unmolested. Ten years later Heraclius
recovered possession of Egypt, but the troops of the Caliph Omar
soon afterwards invaded the country and t00luAlesandriir after a
prolonged siege. In October, 641,'Amr ibn el-'Ni, Omar's general,
entered the city; but he treated the inhabitants with moderation.
The decline of Alexandria now became rapid in the same proportion as the growing prosperity of the newly-food" capital on the
Nile, the modern Cairo, and its commerce received a death-blow
by the discovery of America and of the sea-route to India round
the Cape of Good Hope.

The decay of the once powerful seaport, which contained only
5000 inhab. in 1800, was at length effectually arrested by the
vigorous hand of Mohammad Ali (p. cxx), who improved the har-.
hours and constructed several canals. The chief benetit he conferred on Alexandria was the construction of the Jlayrmidtyeh Canal
(p. 12), begun in 1819 and named after the reigning Sultan Nab1ntoil H. Through this channel the adjoining tields were irrigated
anew and Alexandria was again connected with the Nile and the rest
of Egypt, the products of which had long found their only outlets
through the Rosetta and Damietta mouths of the river. Subsequent
viceroys also made great efforts to improve the position of the town
It suffered severely, however, duringArabrs rising in 1882 (p. cxxiii),
and a great part of the European quarter was laid in ashes; but all
traces of this misfortune have disappeared and the town is again
quite prosperous.
