We return hence to the Central Terrace and ascend the inclined
approach which brings us first to a much ruined HALL, the roof of
which was borne by pillars and sixteen-sided columns. A granite
doorway here gives access to the
Upper Terrace, The central part of the terrace was occupied by
a large HYPOSTYLE HALL, now in a state of complete ruin. Its walls
were adorned with reliefs of a festal procession, which have suffered
severely at the hands of the Coptic monk." Turning sharp to the
right (N), we reach a door (Pl. xl admitting to a VBSTIBULB, which
had three sixteen-sided columns. Opposite the door is a small
Recess (PI. y), with representations of Queen Hatshepsut, in good
preservation.

Rear Wall of the races: Hatshepsut (erased) before Amon. Side
Walls: Hatshepsut seated at table, with a priest clad like the god llorEnmetr in front of her. The figure of the queen is uninjured, contrary to
the usual practice; but the priest's figure was defaced by Amenophis IV.

To the left of the vestibule we enter an open COURT, in which is
an "Altar, approached by ten steps and dedicated by Hatshepsut to
the sun- god RÃ©-Harakhte. This is one of the very few altars that have
come down to us from Egyptian antiquity on their original sites.
In the W. wall of this court is a small recess with saerifieial scenes
on the walls (the figure of' Hatshepsut erased). - A door in the N.

To the right and left of the entrance: slaughter and cutting up of the
