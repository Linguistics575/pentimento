whole of the Gospels by heart. The Roman propaganda, which was
begun by Franciscans at the end of the 17th and beginning of the
18th cent, has been less successful among the CoptS. There are,
however, a few small lloman Catholic communities in Upper Egypt
(at (rugeli, Akhmim, and Naluideh), forming the'Church of the
Catholic Copts', whose patriarch, Cyrillos 11., consecrated in 1800,
is a native Copt. The present patriarch of the old Copts, at Cairo,
is likewise named Cyrillos.

(3). BEDUIxs. Beds (sing. beduwi) is the name applied to the
nomadic Arabs, and'Arab (sing.'Arasz to those who immigrated
at a later period and settled in the valley of the Nile. They
both differ materially from the dwellers in towns and from the
fullehin. The subdivisions of the Beduin tribes are called J.fabt" lelt.
Though differing greatly in origin and language, the wandering tribes
of Egypt all profess Mohammedanism. Again, while some of them
have immigrated from Arabia or Syria, partly in very ancient and
partly in modern times, and while others are supposed to be the
aboriginal inhabitants of the territories claimed by them (as the
Berbers of N. Africa and the Ethiopians and Blemmyes of Nubia),
or former dwellers on the Nile expelled from their homes by foreign
invaders, they all differ greatly from the settled Egyptian population;
and this contrast is accounted for by the radical difference between
the influenees of the desert and those of the Nile valley.

According to the census of 1907 there were 635,012 Beduins
in Egypt, of whom 537,631 were settled in towns and villages.

The Beduins may be divided into two leading groups: (1) Beduins
in the narrower sense, he. Arabic-speaking tribes, most of whom
have probably immigrated from Arabia or Syria, and who occupy
the deserts adjoining Central and Northern Egypt besides to a considerable extent settling in the Nile valley; (2) Beau, who range
over the regions of Upper Egypt and Nubia situated between the
Nile and the lied Sea, and extending to the frontiers of the Abyssinian mountains. These are the descendants of the ancient Blemmyes (p. 386; their territory being known as'Jidhai'j. The two principal races of the second group, ssith whom alone we have to deal
as inhabitants of Egypt, are the Eishiirtn and the'Abitbdeh. They
are widely scattered in the valleys of the desert (pp. 372 ei: ser),
between the tropics and the latitude of Keueh and Keg. I and lead
a poverty-stricken life with their very scanty stock of camels and
goats. Though closely resembling the other Bega tribes in appearance, the'Abibdeh (sing.'Abidi, probably the Gebadaei of Pliny)
possess an original language of their own C'to-bedyawiyeh0, which,
however, they have long since exchanged for bad Arabic. They
have adopted also the costume of the fellahiu, while the Bishirin
tend their large tl0eks of sheep and herds of camels in a half-naked
condition, girded with a leather" apron and wrapped in :1 kind of eot <
