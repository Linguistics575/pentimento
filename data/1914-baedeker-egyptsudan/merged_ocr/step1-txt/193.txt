level in technical ability as well as in ornamentation must be looked
for in the early collapse of the great empire of the Caliphs, in the
uncertain political circumstances of the period that followed, in
climatic and geological conditions, in the inihaenee of superstition,
and in the characteristic oriental tendency to adhere with obstinate
fidelity to ancient forms and to leavennaltered anythingonce accomplished. However much admiration the arabesque may excite, however great an influence it may exert on industrial art, we still miss'
in it the reproduction of living beings, the contemplation of which
invites, as it were, an intelligent and active sympathy.

In the period of the Tulunides, when Persian influence made
itself felt even in the religious conceptions of Egypt, portraits were
painted and coloured wooden statues erected in the palaces. But no
long period elapsed before the prohibition of the Sunna (p. lxxxv)
against the representation of any living being again came into force.
ttspresentatioms of this kind are therefore very rare, and are now to
be found preserved only in the low reliefs carved by Persian sculptors
of the Shiite sect. Statues and paintings have disappeared without
leaving a trace. Painting and sculpture in modern Egyptian art
have been reserved excln < ively for the decoration of wall surfaces
