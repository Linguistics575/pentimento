Ill, POPULAR FESTIVALS. xcvi

On this occasion every true believer in the prophet, it he possibly can
spends the whole day in the streets. The women don their smartest attire
Many of the harem windows are opened and the veiled inmates gaze into
the streets. The chief scene of the ceremonies is the Place Saladin (p. 68),
where a sumptuous tent of red velvet and gold is pitched for the reception
of the dignitaries. The procession is headed by soldiers, who are followed
by camels adorned with gaily coloured trappings and hearing on their
humps bunches of palm-hranches with oranges attached. Each section of
the cavalcade is preceded by' hand of Arab musicians, the largest section
being that which accompanies the Takhtarawdn, or litter of the Emir er.
Hagg, and the next in order that of the Dem et-Hagg, 0r leader of the
pilgrims, with his attendants. Next follow various detachments of pilgrims
and dervishes with banners, and lastly the llahma ].

On the J0tlt of DHUL-IJIGGEH, the twelfth month, begins the great festival of El-Ud el-irebie (Kurbdn Beiram), which resembles the lesser feast
tel-tid ey-s.ughaiysr0 already mentioned. On this day, if on no other
throughout the year, every faithful Moslem eats a piece of meat in memory
of the tsacrifice of Abraham, and the poor are presented with meat by
the rich.

With the Rising of the Nile also there are connected several interesting festivals, closely resembling those of the ancient period of the
Pharaohs, which even the Christian epoch was unable entirely to obliterate. As, however, they take place in summer, few travellers will
have an opportunity of witnessing them. As these festivals have reference to a regularly recurring phenomenon of nature, their dates are necessarily fixed in accordence with the Coptic solar reckoning of time, instead of the variable Arabian lunar year. - The night of the 11th of the
Coptic mouth Balina (June 17th) is called Leilet en-Nulrga, Le. the'night
of the drop', as it is believed that a drop from heaven for a bear of Isis,
according to the ancient Egyptian myth) falls into the Nile on this night
and causes its rise. The astrologers profess to calculate precisely the
hour 0 the fall of the sacred drop. The Cairenes spend this night on
the bangks of the Nile, either in the open air or in the houses of friends
near the river, and practise all kinds of superstitious customs. One of
these consists in the placing or a piece of dough by each member of a
family on the roof of the house; it the dough rises, happiness is in store
for the person who placed it there, while its failure to rise is regarded as
a. had omen. On the 2ist of June the river begins slowly to rise. On the
27th of the Coptic month Baiina (July 3rd) the Alumni; en-A'iz, or Nileuriers are frequently heard in the morning, announcing to the citizens the
number of inches that the river has risen. Each muniidi is accompanied
by a boy, with whom he enters on a long religious dialogue by way of
preface to his statements. which, however, are generally inaccurate. The
next important day is the Day of the Cutting of the Dam (ydm gebr et-balu', or
ydm wefa el-babr), about the middle of the Coptic month or Mina fie. the
middle of August), when the principal ceremonies are performed to the N.
of the former Fumm el-Khalig (p. IN). The Nile-erier, attended by boys
carrying flags, announces the Weft: en-M'l (Le. superfluity of the Nile), or
period when the water has reached its normal height of about sixteen ens
(p. lai). The actual cutting through of the dam can no longer take place,
but the festivities go on as heme
