264 Route 20. TIIEBES (E. BANK) q Karnak:

hieratic inscriptions, besides representations of foot-prints, placed here
by pilgrims to the temple.

Adjoining the temple of Khons on the S.W. is a Temple of
Epet, the hippopotamus-goddess, erected by Euergetes IL; the
building stands upon a basis about 10 ft. in height, crowned with
a concave cornice. The keeper of the temple of Khons will open it
on request. The main entrance is on the W. side; on the jambs
appears the king before Osiris and other deities. We enter first a
Rectangular Hall, with a "ell-preserved ceiling resting upon two
columns, with calyx-capitals and heads of Hathor above them. The
grated windows at the top of the S. wall should be noted. To the
right lie three side-rooms with crypts; the door on the left is built
up - We proceed through the central door into a Second Hall, 3
flanked by two side-rooms, of which that to the left contains a representation of the dead Osiris upon the bier. We then pass through'

r

a door, on the rightjamb of which appears the goddess Epet, and _
enter the Sanctuary, where a figure of the goddess stood in a niche.
The reliefs show us the king (usually Euergetes IL) before the gods.
- In the E. wall of the temple is a Chapel of Osiris (separate
entrance on the E. side), constructed by Ptolemy XIII., to which
belongs the shaft issuing from the sanctuary of the Temple of Epet,
in which perhaps a relic of Osiris was buried.

b. THE GREAT TEMPLE "Alumni

From the Temple of Khan: we proceed in the direction of the
Nile and soon reach the first pylon of the great temple of Amen.
To the W. of this is the house of the director of the excavations
(M. Georges Legrain). Direct route from Luxor, see p. 262. Donkeys
and carriages must be left at the door to the W. of the seventh pylon
(p.279). The rectangular terrace in front of the first pylon was even
in antiquity covered by the waters of the inundation, as is indicated
by marks on its front, recording the height of the inundations under
the 21st-26th dynasties. 0n the terrace rises a small Obelisk of Sethos 11., beside which is the base of its companion. An avenue of
recumbent rams, erected by Ramses 11., extended from this point
to the portal of the temple of Amen. The fragments of building
to the S.W. of the right pylon-tower belong to a Chapel, erected
about 390 B.0. by King Achoris and his successor Psamuthis. In
the interior Psamuthis appears on the right and left walls, offering incense to the boat of Amen.

i The Great Temple of Anion, like the temples on the left bank
(comp. p 280, is placed with its longer axis at right angles to the Nile.
According to the practice of Lepsius and other Egyptologists, we consider
the Nile as flowing from S. to N., and so use the simple expressions W.,
N., E., s., whereas geographical accuracy would require N.W., N.E., S.E.,
and s.w. The true N. is indicated on our plans by an arrow.
