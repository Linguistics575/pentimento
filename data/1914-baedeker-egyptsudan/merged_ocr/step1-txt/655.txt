l? raas a Silurian rock with onlcrappings of later granite.) In i hr.
more we reach the Bir J.rarnrmhndt, a well 16 it. in diameter, now,
however, containing no water. Near the well are the remains of a
Roman wall and ilve 1onilnished and now shattered sarcophagi. The
quarries contain numerous Egyptian inscriptions. The earliest expedition ta l.lammirnit of which we have any knowledge took place
in the reign of King ltsse (5th Dyn.). At a later period, especially
under the Middle Empire, the quarries were diligently worked, and
even under the New Empire they were in operation. We hear of a
great undertaking under Ramses IV. for the purpose of procuring
blocks for the temple of Amon at Thebes, in which no fewer than
8368 workmen and soldiers were employed. The quarries were
worked under Darius, Xerxes, and Artaxerxes also.

Just beyond the quarries the route turns from the N.E. to the S.
and passes the ruins of El-Ftrwdkhir ('the potsherds'), now in the
possession of a British mining-company. Traces of the ancient Open
workings and deep subterranean adits (now very difficult of access),
the foundations of hundreds of Workmen's cottages, and numerous
inscriptions, bear witness to the former importance of the place.

About i hr. beyond El-Faw√©khir we reach BET es-Sidd, a small
and picturesqnely situated spring, adjoined by settlements of the
Ubtbdeh. In 4 hrs. more we reach the top of the pass of RN, on
the other side of whir'h we descend through the midi Abu Sinm
to (3 hrs.) the Wadi lfu'yafu, containing a large well, the water of
which, however, is considered nnwholesome. The route now makes
a wide curve to the h. and at the plain of'Liteima' reaches the
dividing line between the ventral mountain range and the outlying
chains consisting of Cretaceous sandstone and tertiary rocks (white
limestone). After 91/2 hrs. we pass through the Wadi Beidu and
proceed to (3 hrs.) the Bitr et-hlpris (dug by English troops in 1800),
the cisterns of which are generally dry. Thence we go on through the
YTsdi Ambuyi, with a spring of but h Water, to (4 hrs.)
Iioysir (Qosseir), on the Arabian Gulf. Iioeeir is now an unimportant town of 1600 inhah., the seat of a Na'mfor o, xlvii), with
a quay, a long wooden mole, two mosques, several bazaars, government-buildings, and a telegraph-omce. In the Ptolemaie period the
desert-route ended here at the Leukos Limen or'White llarhour',
and in earlier times in the vicinity ofthe Wdd, near the village
of' Saute, a little to the N. of l.ios.eir. About 3-i M. to the N. of
lioysir lies Old Kay", with some scanty ancient remains. - An
interesting and very attractive visit may be made to the coral reefs
which here skirt the shore and are easily aecessible at ehh-tide.

On the return-journey towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route (therrcalled'Niila Route'), diverging
from the route above described at the Bir ei-Inglis (see above). This alternative route, which may be strongly recom'mended, leads at tirst through
the winding Wadi Kabr eVlihddim, afterwards passing the Gebel A'ul.ids and

through the pass 6f Ri'at el-Ghasdl into the Midi (Masdl To the right
