the deceased at a banquet, attendants with gifts, and the slaughtering
of cattle for an offering to the dead.

If not pressed for time the traveller may now ascend to the
Pyramid of Tali, to the E. of which lie the scanty ruins of the
mortuary temple. Farther to the E. lies a chaos of buildings, brought
to light during the excavations lately carried on by Mr. Quibell of the
Service des Antiquités de I'Egypte, and dating from various times
from the Ancient Empire down to the Greek period. The oldest
monuments are two large stone mas.stabas, belonging to the Ancient
Empire, surmounted by brick tombs added in the Middle Empire.
The brick wall by which these are surrounded is 30-33 ft. thick
and dates from the Greek period. - Close by is the House of the
Service des Anliguilés. In front of this, to the N. and PL, stretches
a cemetery recently excavated by Quibell, with Brick Mastabas ol'
the 2nd and 3rd Dynasties.

1'he mastaba of Ti is rivalled in beauty by the reliefs in the
'" Nas.taba of Ptahhotep, which lies between the Onnos Pyramid
and 3lariette's House, a few hundred yards from the latter. It
dates from the period of the 5th Dyn., under which the deceased
held one of the highest offices of state.

From the entrance (A on the Plan, p. 164), on the N. side, we
enter a CORRIDOR (B), on the right of which is the PILLARED HALL
(o), a large square apartment with its roof supported by four pillars.
A door in the SE. angle admits us to a vestibule (E), beyond
which is the
Touw-CarAsrmim OF PTAHHOTEP (F), adorned with mural reliefs
that are among the highest achievements of ancient Egyptian art at
its zenith (p. cixxiv). The colours are still well preserved, The ceiling imitates the trunks of palm-heirs.

Jn the Doorway: Servants with saerifieial gifts. N. Walt: over
the door, Ptahhotcp at his morning toilet, with his greyhounds
under his chair and a pet ape held by an attendant; in front of

players and a singer beating time with his hands (lowest row).
To the left of the door are servants with gifts; slaughter of the
saeritieial oxen. - w. Wall.- [ in the right and left angles are false
doors; that on the right, very elaborate, perhaps representing the
facade of a palace. Un the left door (at the foot) the deceased is
represented seated in a chapel (right) and home in a littcr0eft); in
front is the table of offerings. The wall-reliefs represent Ptahhotep
seated at a richly furnished banquet (left); before him are priests
making offerings (upper row) and servants bearing various gifts
