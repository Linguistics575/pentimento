thing in man, but man is nevertheless responsible, according as
he assents to or dissents from the operations of God. The Koran,
like the Logos of the Christians, is conceived of as uncreated and
co-existent with God from all eternity; but on the other hand the
Koran committed to the Prophet by the angel Gabriel is created.
The cardinal points which every Moslem is bound to hold are the
beliefs in God and the angels, in written revelation and the prophets, and in the last judgment and predestination.

Goo AND THE ANGELS. Ninetymiue of the different attributes of God
were afterwards gathered from the Koran, each of which is represented
by a. head of the Modem rosary. Great importance is attached to the fact
that the creation of the world was tetleeted by a simple etyort of the divine
will. (God said'Let there be', and there was.) The story of the creation
in the Koran is taken from the Bible, with variations from Rabbinical.
Persian, and other sources. God iirst created his throne; beneath the
lhi-one was water; then the earth was formed. In order to keep the earth
steady God created an angel and placed him on a huge rock, which in
its turn rests on the back and horns of the hull of the world.

In connection with the creation of the tirmament was that of the
Jinn (demons), beings occupying a middle rank between men and angels,
some of them believing. others unbelieving. When the jinn became
arrogant an angel was ordered to banish them, and he accordingly drove
them to the mountains of liiif by which the earth is surrounded, whence
lhey occasionally make incursions. Adam was then created, on the evening of the sixth day, and the Moslems on that account observe Friday as
their Sabbath. As the angel who conquered the jinn refused to bow down
hefore Adam, he was exiled aud thenceforward called lblis, or the devil
After this Adam himself fell and became a solitary wanderer, but was
afterwards retuuitert to Eve at Mecca, where the sacred stone in the Kaaba
derives its black colour from Adam's tears. Adam is regarded as the
tirat orthodox Moslem.

The Angel: are the bearers nr God's throne and execute his commands.
They act also as mediators between God and men. While there are legions
of good angels, there are also innumerable satellites of Satan, who seduce
men to error.

VVmI'rsx REVELATION AND TUE PROPHETS. The earliest men were all
believers, but they afterwards fell away from the true faith. A revelation
therefore became necessary. The prophets are very numerous, amounting
in all, it is said, to 124,000; but they differ very much in rank. They
are free from all gross sing and are endowed by God with power to work
miracles, which power forms their credentials; nevertheless they are
generally derided and 1111111111111. The greater prophets are Adam, Noah,
Abraham. Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, Jesus being the next greatest after
Mohammed. Noses and Christ prophesied the advent of mohammed, who
is the promised Paraelete, the Comforter (St. John xiv. 18), the last and
greatest of the prophets. He confirms previous revelations but his appearance has superseded them.

The Row (Karma) 1111 111111 of which signifies'rehearsal', or'reading', is divided into 114 chapters or parts called Sam: The tirst revelation vouehsafed to the Prophet took place in the'blessed night' in the
year 609. With many interruptions the hsending down' of the Koran
extended over twenty-three years, until the whole book was in the prophet"
possession. The earlier 0r Meecan st1rehs, olaced at the end of the book
on account of their brevity, are characterized by great freshness and vigour
of style. In the longer tshells of a later period the style is more studied
and the narrative often tedious. The Koran is nevertheless regarded as
the masterpiece of Arabic literature.

The best English translations of the Koran are those of E. Sale (1734;
obtainable in a cheap form or with a preliminary discourse and copious
notes, edit. by Rev. E. M. Wherry, 168236, l vols.) -, Radwell (London,
