The town of Berenike (Berenice), situated in the same latitude as
Assuiin, was founded in 275 B.C. by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who revived
the commerce of the Red See by the establishment of several new ports.
The town, which was named by Ptolemy after his mother, was the terminus of the main desert-routes from Egypt, and for 400 or 500 year! was
the entrep6t of a marine commerce carried on mainly with Arabia and
India. The ruins, still extant, surround the Temple, which faces the
F, E In front is a forecourt 281/2 ft. in width and 12 ft. in depth,
which was adjoined by the temple proper (inner length 31 it), comprising two rows of apartments. The representation on the left outside
wall shows an emperor appearing before a goddess, who seems to be,
from the legend, the tutelary deity of the green (5.2. emerald) mine.

The Emerald Mines, W' to the N. of Bercnike, were worked by the

Arabs down to the year 760 of the Hegira (1370 A.DO, after which they were
abandoned. Mohammed Ali made an unavailing attempt to re-open them.

temple, with a few Greek inscriptions.

Farther to the N. (25° 30' N. lat.), in the dei Umbdrek, lie the ancient
gold-mines of Umm Rus, reopened by the Um Rug Gold Mines of Egypt,
a British company. Hundreds of labourers' huts are still visible here
besides the ruins of about 300 houses dating from a Gra'ca-anan settlement (called by Ptolemy Nechesia). A light railway leads from Umm Bus
to (41/2 M.) the small port of Mina Umbdrek 0r Alarm Imbarak, on the
Red Sea.
