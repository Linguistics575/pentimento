a wooden sledge, which is drawn by four rows of workmen with
43 men in each. A priest precedes the statue scattering incense. On
the prow of the sledge stands a man pouring water on the ground to
prevent the heavily loaded sledge from taking fire by friction; and
on the lap of the figure is another man clapping his hands, probably

carrying water and a beam; and behind the statue are foremen and
other ot'iieials. At the top are companies of people with branches in
their hands, hastening to meet the procession. To the extreme left
stands Thuti-hotep, followed by his body-guard, observing the
spectacle.

Tombs of the Middle Empire, and numerous tombs of the Ptolemaic
period. Opposite, on the S. side of the valley, is a large Quarry,

When Amenophis IV. (p. cii) became converted to the exelusive worship of the sun and abjured the ancient gods, he quitted
Thebes, the capital until that time, and withdrew with his court to
a new sacred spot. This was situated in the Hermopolitan nome in
