G. The development of surface ornaments into geometrical
patterns of every kind (entrelacs) or conventionalized foliage (arabesques); the use of Arabic ornamental inscriptions on friezes and
medallions; and the treatment of wall-surfaces and ceilings in rich
polychrome hues, whether by painting, incrustation, or mosaic.

The chief monuments of Arabian architecture in Egypt are the
religious editiees (mosques), fountains, and tombs. The period
within which these were built extends from the accession of the
Tulunide sultans to the conquest of Egypt by the Turks. The earlier
mosques have lett hardly a trace behind, and our knowledge of them
depends upon the obviously exaggerated and often confused descriptions ot' the Arabic writers. The later mosques are of little
artistic value. Some of them display a union of Turkish-Arabic
architectural forms with Egyptiau-Arabic ornamentation.

The only existing building dating from the TULUNIDE PERIOD
(868-905) is the Mosque of Ibn Talon (p. 71). The oldest plaster
decorations in this mosque display a system of ornamentation, the
various elements in which remain, as in the antique, separate and
distinct, though some of them are so unusual in form as to defy
classification under any known style.

In the FATIMITE PERIOD $ 694171) that followed, the characteristic intertwined geometrical patterns, with spaces filled up by Arabic
ornamentation showing a tendency to the Byzantine style, begin to
appear. Bricks ceased to be the exclusive building-material and
hewn stone was used for portions of the editices; the mosque of ElA (smar (p. 76) showed the um example of a stone facade with
stalaetitos. The portals began to be placed in recesses, and small
enpelas made their appearance in the interior 01' the mosques. The
pointed arch of the mosque of Ibn Tum" gave place to the Persian
'keel' arch. Towards the close of this period forms began to be
adopted, especially in military architecture, that seem to have been
copied from the buildings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine.

The leading characteristic of the An'msnm PERIOD (1171-1950)
was the introduction of the ground-plan of the Persian medreseh,
which superseded the previously used ground-plan of the courts
until the first Mameluke period. Large domes began to be built
over the mausolea, which as founders' tombs were placed near the
sanctuaries of the mosques.

To the FIRST BAERITE MAMELUKE DYNASTY (1250-1382) we
owe a number of huge edifices, with ground-plans in both the abovementioned styles and exhibiting, especially in the fapades, the intluenre of the architecture of the Crusaders. Most of these structures date from the reigns of Beybars and Ipalitm, the latter of whom
raised the first minaret of stone. Under En-b% iir endeavours began
to be made to design facades independent of foreign influence.
