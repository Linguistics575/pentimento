inches, and are called ibrtmi, or sultk6ti, as they come from N. Nubia.
The most delicately flavoured are the dark-brown dates from Alexandria, known as amhiit, which are eaten fresh. The value of the
dates exported annually amounts to about one million francs only,
as they realize too high a price in the country itself to remunerate
the exporter. - The dum-palm (Hyphaena Thebaica) occurs principally in Upper Egypt and Nubia. It may be seen on the Nile above
Baliana (comp. p. 244). It is a broad-leafed palm of medium height,
and its timber and bast are of considerable value. Various objects
are made out of the hard kernel of the fruit, whilethe soft and fibrous
rind is edible and has a sweetish taste, not unlike that of gingerbread. _ The mango-tree (Mangifera Indica ] has recently been introduced into the Delta for the sake of its fruit.

The vine thrives admirably in Egypt, and grapes final) ) abound
from July to September. Wine was extensively made from them
in ancient times, and this might still easily be done, were it not
that Egypt is already amply supplied with cheap and excellent
wines from every part of the Mediterranean. The vine blossoms in
March and April, like the palm, and the grapes ripen in June and
July. Oranges tburtulciis0 are abundant and cheap (the harvest beginning in September), and so also are mandarins ('Yasuf Eftmdi')
and small lemons (tannin; the small and juicy fruit of the Citrus
limonium); citrons and eedros are of less frequent occurrence.
Among other fruit-trees we may mention also the pomegranate
(ramvufn), which yields a handsome return. The romuuou European
fruits likewise abound, but their flavour is generally very inferior.
Figs (tin) are very common in summer, but caprification is not
practised in Egypt.

The principal DECORATIVE PLANTS are roses board; of which
the Rosa Damascena moschata and Iloea sempervirens are specially
cultivated for the manufacture of attar of roses), oleanders of astonishing height, carnations, and geraniums, all of which have been
grown in Egypt from a very early period. A bushy tree, which in
its ha1f-leal1ess condition attracts the attention of every traveller on
landing at Alexandria in winter, is the Poinsettia (Euphorbia
pulcherrima). The insignificant blossom is surrounded by leaves
of the most brilliant red, presenting a very picturesque and striking appearance. Natural forests, or even solitary wild trees, are
never met with in the valley of the Nile or in the valleys of the northern deserts.
