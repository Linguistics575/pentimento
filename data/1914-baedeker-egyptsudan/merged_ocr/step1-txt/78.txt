lxxil II. GEOGRAPHICAL AND e. Agriculture:

supply falls below the requirements of the country, and, besides
drawing upon the supply of the reservoir, it then often becomes
necessary to restrict land-owners on different parts of a canal to
drawing water from it in rotation. Periods of watering alternate
with periods when the water is employed elsewhere. The intervals
become longer as the river falls, and the supply steadily diminishes
until the flood rises about the beginning of August.

Above Assit1t flood irrigation still continues. About Aug. 20th
the river has risen high enough to flow into the supply canals and
basins; in these, when full, the water stands for 40 days. At the
end of this period the clear water is allowed to flow back into the
river, or, in the case of years when the flood is exceptionally low,
into other basins at a lower level. On the mud thus left the seed is
sown and a crop is grown without further watering. In years of insufficient flood the higher portions of the land are not watered; these
lands are termed'sharttlsi' and pay no tax when nnwatered.

The irrigation is effected by means of: (t) The WRciyeli', or
large wheels (rarely exceeding 30 ft. in diameter), turned by cattle
or buffaloes, and sometimes by camels, and fitted with SCOOPS or
buckets (gammy of wood or clay, resembling a dredging-machine.
L2) The'8hidtf, an apparatus resembling an ordinary'well-sweep'
(with bucket and connter-weight), set in motion by one person only,
and drawing the water in buckets resembling baskets in appearance; as a substitute for the siliiyeh several shiiltifs are sometimes arranged one above the other. (3) Whewit is possible to store
the water in reservoirs above the level of the land to be watered,
it is allowed to overflow the fields whenever required. This is the
only method available in the oases, where fortunately the springs
rise with such force as to admit of their being easily dammed up
at a suffieiently high level. (i) Pumps driven by steam are used also,
particularly when a large supply of water is required, as in the ease
of the sugar-plantations on the banks (gefs) of the Nile in the N.
part of Upper Egypt, where they are seen in great numbers. (5) The
'Tiibiit', a peculiar, very light, and easily moved wooden wheel,
which raises the water by means of numerous compartments in the
hollow felloes, is used mainly in the Lower Delta in places where
the level of the water in the canals remains nearly the same. Archimedean screws also are found in the Delta, and in the Faiyt1m
there are undershot water-wheels. Occasionally irrigation is effected
by means of a basket (nugget) slung on a rope between two labourers.
In order to distribute the water equally over flat fields, these are
sometimes divided into a number of small squares by means of
embankments of earth, a few inches in height, which, owing to the
great plasticity of the Nile mud, are easily opened or closed so as to
regulate the height of the water within them. The efforts of government as mentioned on p. lxvi are directed towards the emancipation of agriculture from dependence upon the inundation,
