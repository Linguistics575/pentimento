4, Bib√©n el-Muluk. Tombs of the Kings.

The Tones OF THE KINGS AT BiBiN EL-N tJrdbrr belong to the 18-20th Dynasties, and, in contrast to the pyramids that mark the graves of kings up
to the beginning of the New Empire, consist of a series of passages and
chambers hewn in the rock. Like the corridors within the pyramids they
were intended only for the reception of the sarcophagus; the temples
dedicated to the manes of the deceased, in which the offerings to the dead
were made, were built in the plain.

The STRUCTURE of the tombs is practically the same in all. Three
Corridors placed one beyond the other, led into the innermost recesses.
Small iiiieiiifiriiUiiii sometimes opened "the first corridor, and recesses for the reception of the furniture of the dead were provided in
the second and third. The third corridor led into an Anteroom, beyond
which lay the Main Hall, where, in a hollow in the floor, the heavy
granite sarcophagus was deposited. The main hall, the roof of which was
frequently supported by pillars, was often adjoined by other chambers.

The WALLS of the tombs, from the entrance to the final chamber,
were covered with sacred pictures and texts, a knowledge of which was
essential for the deceased in the future life. The prevailing conception
at Bibin el-Muliik was that the deceased king, as companion of the sungod (or rather absorbed in the sun-god), sailed through the underworld
at night in a boat; thus those scenes and texts were preferred which described this voyage and instructed the deceased as to the exact route. These
texts were chiefly taken from two books closely related to each other.
One was called'The Back of him who it in the Underworld'. According to
this, the underworld CNet; p. cxlviii) is divided into 12 regions ('CavtsrnsO,
corresponding to the 12 hours of night; and the description: in the
book were therefore likewise in 12 chapters. In each of these the
river bearing the boat of the sun is represented in the middle; in the
boat stands the ram-headed sun-god, surrounded by his retinue, and
bringing for a short time light and life to the regions he traverses.
Above and below are shown the two banks of the river, througed hy all
manner of spirits, daemons, and monsters, which greet the sun and ward
"his enemies.

The second hook, known as the'Book of the Gates', reproduces the
same conceptions. The nocturnal journey of the sun through the 12 regions of the underworld is again represented. Massive gates or pylons,
guarded by gigantic serpents, separate one region from another; each
serpent bears a name known to the sun-god, and the deceased must know
it also. Two gods and two fhus-apitting snakes guard the approach and
greet the sun-god.

A third work, which may be called'The Sun's Journey in the Underworld', contains still more gloomy and unattractive representations. The
sun-god has arrived in the underworld and addresses a speech to the
spirits and monsters, which are carefully depicted in long rows.

Recourse was had to other works also for the decoration of the kings'
tombs. The chief of these were the'Praising of RE' and'The Book of
the Opening of the Mouth'. The former, which was used in the first carridors, contains a long-winded hymn to the sun-god, to be recited in the
evening as the sun entered the underworld. In the course of the hymn
the god is invoked under 75 different names and is depicted in as many
term. - The text and illustrations in the second of these works teach
the multifarious ceremonies which had to he performed before the statue
of the deceased king in order to ensure it the use of its organs, so as to
enable it to eat and drink in the tomb.

Strabo tells of to tombs'worthy of a visit', the scholars of the French
Expedition mention It, while at present 60 are known, but only 16 of
these are accessible, iElian, Heliodorus, Ammianus Marcellinus,
and other ancient authors refer to them as the Syringes (isutur tg) of
Thebes, from the resemblance of the long corridors to the rec s of a
