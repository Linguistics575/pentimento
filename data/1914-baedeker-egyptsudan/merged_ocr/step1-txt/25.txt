only in all the principal towns but also in the smaller towns of
the Delta and Upper Egypt. The addresses of letters destined for
Egypt should always be written very distinctly, particularly the
initial letters. They had better be directed to the hotel at which
the traveller intends to stay, or they may be sent to the head postoffiee (Post Office, Poste Restante) in Cairo, in which ease the
traveller should inform the officials at the Bureau de Renseignements by letter of his local address, and his letters will be for-.
warded thither. On leaving for Upper Egypt travellers should
notify the postal authorities at Cairo, so that letters may be Pune'

correspondence looked after by the steamboat-company. - Registered Letters are not delivered to the addressee unless he has a
