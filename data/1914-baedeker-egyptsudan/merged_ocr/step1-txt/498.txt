reign of Nero and other Roman emperors. The large scenes on the S.
rear wall show Ptolemy XVI. ihesar, son of Julius Caesar, and his
mother, Cleopatra, in presence of the gods of Dendera. In the
centre is the image of the goddess Hathor. The faces are purely
conventional and in no sense portraits. The projeetinglions' heads
on the sides of the building were intended to carry off therain-water.

To the right (N.WO ofthe entrance to the temple of Hathor lies
the so- called Birth House, a small temple not yet quite freed from
de'bris. Similar'birth houses' were erected beside all large temples
of the Ptolemaic period. They were dedicated to the worship of the
sons of the two deities revered in the main temple, in the present
case to Irar-sern-tewe (p. 245). This Girth house Was built by
Augustus and some of its reliefs were added by Trajan and Hadrian.
On the N. and S sides is a colonnade with flower-columns, the
abaei of which are adorned with figures of Bes, the patron deity of
women in labour.

INTERIOR. We first enter a vestibule, from which open on the right
a chamber with a flight of steps and a door to the colonnade, and on the
left two other apartments. A door in the middle admits to a wide space, out
of which open three other doors. Those at the sides lead to corridors,
while that in the centre Opens into the birth-chamber proper, the mural
reliefs in which represent the birth and nursing of the divine infant.

Buried in rubbish immediately to the S. of the Birth House is
a large Coptic Church.

Behind the temple of Hathor (to the S.W.) is a Temple of Isis,
consisting of a vestibule and three chambers. The unattractive and
uninteresting building owes its origin to the Emperor Augustus.

Beyond Keneh (p. 244) the steamer passes three islands. On the
W. bank lies the village of Balms, with clay-deposits from which
most of the'Keneh pottery' is made (see p. 223). Balélis (pl. of
ballés, named after the village), lrfilal (pl. of hulla), and other kinds
ofjars, some of considerable size, lie on the banks awaiting shipment. This village is situated in the district known to the Ch'eks
as Typhonia ('dedicated to Typhon', i.e. Seth).

inland, lies Kurt (p. 223). On the W. bank is the village of Truth
(p. 224). The village of El-mlleh (E. bank) is the steamboat station
for Kris (p. 223). Opposite lies Nalyideh, another steamboat station
(p. 224). The Nile describes a curve to the W. and forms the island
of Math. On the W. bank is Ed-Denr'd.c (Danfg). - At Shenhur,
which lies a little inland from the E. bank, about 3 M. to the s.
of 1.Os, are the ruins of a small temple of Isis, discovered by Prisee
d'Avennes. To the E. of Shenhur runs the Shenhur Canal, whim
begins a little above Thebes and extends on the N. to Keneh.
