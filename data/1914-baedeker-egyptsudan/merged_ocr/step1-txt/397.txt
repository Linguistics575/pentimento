Mangam { Mansonrah }, a thriving town with (19070-10, 270 inhab.
and numerous new houses in the European style, is the capital of
the province of Dal.tahltyeh and lies on the right bank of the ancient
Phatuitie arm of the Nile, now the Damietta branch, from which di-.
verges the Bahr ee.Sairhaiyar (Et-Babr el-Saghir), a canal emptying
into Lake Menzaleh. On the opposite bank of the river lies Talkha
(p. 175). Mans.rira is an emporium for the cotton and other products
ot' Lower Egypt.

HISTORY. Namphp (i.e.'the victorious') was founded by Sultan Malik
el-Kimil (p. cxvii ] in 1221, as an advantageous substitute forlraruietta0unup,
11.116) The first serious attack made on 11111511111. was by the Crusadevs
under Louis IX. of France in 1249. After encountering great diffieulties they
succeeded in crossing the Ushmtlrn Canal (the present Baht es Suuhaiyun,
but in the neighbourhood of Mansura they were defeated by the young
Sultan El-Nora-tt Ttirtinshiil1. Their fleet was destroyed and familiar
l'ever broke out. When the in fated Crusaders attempted to escape they
were intercepted by the Turks, who thinned their ranks terribly and
captured the king (Api-il 12501011 May 15111 1250, Louis was released on
payment of a heavy ransom and on surrendering Damietta.

The town is regularly laid out and the crowded Arab quarteris
gradually disappearing before modern streets. The main street
runs to the W. from the railway station to the Nile. In a square
near the police-station is the unassuming mosque of E1-Muwiflli.
An unfounded tradition points out an old house of Saladin's time,
close by, as the prison of Louis IX. (see above and p. cxvii). -. In
the quarter between the main street and the Nile are the consulates,
the former Palace of the Khedive, a large and unattractive building,
now used as a mixed tribunal, and the small mosque of Sanga. The
last contains columns brought from older ediMes, with Byzantine
capitals of Corinthian tendency, bearing Saraeenie arches. The
minbar (pulpit) and ceiling are still embellished with remains of
tine wood-carving, which was originally painted.
