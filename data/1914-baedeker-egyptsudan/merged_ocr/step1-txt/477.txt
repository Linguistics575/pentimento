18. Abydos.

The ordinary traveller, with the average amount of time at his disposal, will confine himself to the Temple of'Sethos I. and the sadly dilapidated Temple of Ramses IL, with possibly a visit to the tomb of Shflnet
er.Zebib. - Good donkeys, with European saddles, may be obtained at the
railway station and hotel of Baliana (p. 221; 15 Mas., with bakshish of
5 pies.) Carriage there and back, with stay of 2 hrs., SE l.

Abydos lies about 61/2 M. from Baliana, a ride of t-t% hr.
The track crosses the railway a little to the N. of the station and
follows the telograph-wires along an embankment. Beyond the
hamlet of El-pegs it crosses a canal, traverses a fertile district dotted with numerous villages, and reaches the village (2400 inhabi) of
Et-'Aniba orrAr0ba et-i1fudffsneh (Le.'buriedrAriba0, on the other
side of the Kasreh Canal. The view of the well-cultivated and populous plain, and of the mountains to the E., is very fine. On the
verge of the arable land lay the ancient Abydos, which extended
from'Artiba to EI-Kherheh o. 243).

Abydos (Egypt. Abotu) was one of the most ancient cities in
Egypt and played an important role under the first dynasty as the
burial-plaee of the kings and grandees. The town and its mwpropolis
were both devoted to the worship of the dog-formed death-god
Khente-Amentiu,'the first of the inhabitants of the Western Kingdom'. Even under the Ancient Empire, however, the cult of Osiris
(which originated in the Delta) made good its footing at Abydos.
Osiris took possession of the ancient temple and was raised to an
equality with Khente-Amentiu. The tomb of Osiris was transferred
to Umm el-Gn'Ã©b, and in the days of the 6th Dynasty it became
usual to inter the dead from all parts of Egypt at Abydos. Just as
the Shiite Mohammedan cherishes no dearer wish than to be buried
near the tomb of rJosein (p. M) at Kerbela, so the pious Egyptian
desired no better fortune than to have his corpse carried to Abydos,
there to find its last abode beside the tomb of Osiris. Those who
were unable to do this, or who had built tombs elsewhere, often
unused their mummies to be brought temporarily to Abydos, to receive the desired consecration and to spend some time at least
with Osiris. Many contented themselves with merely erecting a
memorial stone or a cenotaph in the necropolis, thereby assuring
to themselves the favour of Osiris, the lord of the underworld. Isis, the wife of Osiris, his son Horns, and, under the New Empire,
Ptah, Harakhtc, and Amen were likewise worshipped them.

Strain: gives an interesting account of Abydos:'Above it (Ptolerntrrs)
lies Abydos, the site of the Meumonium, a wonderful palace of stone, built
in the manner of the Labyrinth (p. 195), only somewhat less elaborate in its
complexity. Below the Memnonium is a spring, reached by passages with
low vaults consisting of a. single stone and remarkable for their extent
and mode of construction. This spring is connected with the Nile by a
canal, which flows through a grove of Egyptian thOrn-acacias, sacred
to Apollo. Abydos seems once to have been a large city, second only to
Thebes, but now it is a small place.' This spring may perhaps have been

a nilometer. Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of the oracle of the god Bes,
which flourished here.
