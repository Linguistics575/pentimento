COINAGE (comp. the illustrations on p. xvi and the tables before
the title-page and at the end ofthe book). The Egyptian Pound ('Livre
Egyptienne'; SE) is worth 20s. 61/4d., and is divided into 1000 Milliémes or 100 I'imtres. The Arabic name for the piastre is Firth (pi.
Ntsrish; pronounced in Cairo'irsh,'urtish), but the European name
is everywhere current. Travellers should note the distinction that
is still frequently made between the'great piastre' (fairsh ségh), worth
10 milWerues, and the'little (or halo piastre' (liirsh ta'rifa). worth
5 milliémes. - Egyptian gold coins are seldom met with, their place
being taken by the British sovereign [ Gincih inylfsi == 97 pias. 5 mill.)
and the French napoleon (20 fr.; Bintu .--- 77 pias. 2mill., but regularly reckoned at 77 pin), both of which are legally current. and
by the banknotes of the National Bank of Egypt (for M) pias., £ E I,
J) E 5, £13 10, .39, 50, and S. E 100). At Alexandria and Suez, and
a few other points, reckoning also in francs is still common. Where

lritish ini1uenety is strong, and especially in Cairo, the word Shilling
is used for the Rub' Riyal, which is equivalent to about is. 1/4d. Copper
coins (comp. p. if) are met with only in dealings with the natives.
All the Egyptian coins are minted at Birmingham.

A liberal supply of small change is more essential in the East than
anywhere else (comp. pp. xxiv, 37). When obtaining change, travellers
should be on their guard against counterfeit. or depreciated (i.e, worn or
perforated) pieces, which are cominnn enough.

PAssrowrs are not absolutely necessary; and one's visiting-card
practically serves all its functions in the interior. Bankers, however,
frequently require strangers to establish their identity by some such
document; and the countenance and help of consuls also must
depend upon the proof of nationality offered to them by the traveller.
- Travellers who intend to proceed to Turkey must be provided
either with a passport vise' by a Turkish consul at home or with a
teskereh (travelling permit) to be obtained through a consul.

Passports may he obtained in Great Britain direct from the Passport Department of the Foreign Office (fee 25.) or through any of the usual tunristagents, - In the United Sta1es application for passports should be made
to the Bureau of Citizenship, State Department, Wasshington, Di.

CUSTOM House. Tourists' luggage is subjected to a et1stomhouse examination at the port of entry. The objects chiefly sought
for are tobacco and cigars, on which a somewhat high tax is levied
(20 or 21/51bs.). Unused articles are subject to an ad valorem duty of 8 per cent; athlexandria an additional
1/2 per cent is charged for quay and paving dues. A similar duty is
levied on motor-ears, cycles, type-writing machines, and firearms
