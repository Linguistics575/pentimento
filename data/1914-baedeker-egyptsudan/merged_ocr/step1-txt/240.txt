Private Apartments (mostly unfurnished) are seldom to be obtained
for a shorter period than six months. Information as to rooms may be
obtained at the chief shops or from agents whose addresses may be best
learned at the consulates. A sunny aspect should be chosen in winter,
and a detailed written contract invariably drawn up. A bargain as to
food may be made with some neighbouring restaurant; for only those
conversant with tloelarcguagre should attempt to keep house for themselves
