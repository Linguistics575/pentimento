Port Su'id, "Port Said, the chief town of the Egyptian governorate of the same name, lies at the E. extremity of an island which
belongs to the narrow strip ef land separating Lake Menzaleh from
the Mediterranean. It owes its origin te the Suez Canal, and its
prosperity during recent year, has been marked. The population,
which in 1883 was only 17,000, was estimated at the end of 1911
at 55,400, including about 11,000 foreigners.

The Harbour occupies an area of abeut 570 acres and has been
excavated to a depth of 32 ft. by means of laborious dredging. It is
pretected by two massive piers: the eastern (Jete'e Est), running out
into the sea towards the N. for 11/4 M., and the western (Jete'e
Guest), running towards the N.E. for 11/2 M., now being eensiderably lengthened and intended to protect the harbour from the
mud-deposits of the Nile (camp. p. 12). On the landward end of
the W. pier and opposite the inner harbour pier (Digue Nouvelle,
550 yds. in length) rises the *Lighthouse (Phare), constructed of
cencrete, 174 ft. in height, and one of the largest in the world. Its
electric lights are visible te a distance ef 24 M. Abeut 300 yds. to
the N. of it, on the pier, is a statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps (p. 183),
by E. Frémiet, unveiled by the Suez Canal Ge. in 1899, thirty
years after the opening of the Suez Canal, his great achievement.
The statue, 221/2 ft. high, stands on a pedestal 341/2 ft. in height.

The Inner Harbour (220 acres) includes the Bassin Ismail and
three adjoining sheltered basins, vis. the cemmercial harbour (Bae
sin du Commerce) and the arsenal harbour (Bassin de l'Arsenal), en
each side of the handsome buildings of the Canal 00., and the
Bassin Che'rif. The last is flanked with fine buildings erected by
Prince Henry of the Netherlands as a factory for the Dutch trade,
but now used by the British government as a Marconi station (P1. 9).
Beyond these lie the ceal-harbeur (Bassin dee Chalands Clurrbonniers), the Bassin Abbas Hilmi 0r Bassin d'Afrique, and the new
petroleum harbour (Bassin d Pétrole).

A visit may be paid to the interesting Salt Works on the E. side
of the harbour (apply to the manager), where salt is evaporated in
large pans. The salt which is exported is of great purity.
