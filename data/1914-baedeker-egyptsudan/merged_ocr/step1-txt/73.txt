c. The Nile. POLITICAL NOTES. lxvii

slowly rising by deposit at an average rate of about ft inches per
century for at least 5000 years and for a long period before this at
some 11ndeterminable rate. One consequence of this is that temples,
which were built on the banks of the river, well above the annual
inundation, are now below it, and foundations which were originally
dry are now below the infiltration-level and in ronsequence have
deteriorated.

This remarkable river has exercised a unique influence on the
history of civilization. The necessity of controlling its course and
utilizing its water taught the ancient Egyptians the art of river
engineering and the kindred science of Mad-surveying, while in the
starry heavens they beheld the eternal calendar which regulated the
approach and the departure of the inundation, so that the river may
perhaps have given the first impulse to the study of astronomy. As
the annual overflow of the water obliterated all landmarks, it was
necessary annually to measure the land anew, and to keep a register
of the area belonging to each proprietor; and above all it became
an important duty of the rulers of the people to impress them with
a strong sense of the sacredness of property. Similar causes produced
a like result in Babylonia. Every succeeding year, however, there
arose new disputes, and these showed the necessity of establishing
settled laws and enforcing judicial decisions. The Nile thus led to
the foundation of social, legal, and political order.

F Subsequently, when the engineers and architects, in the service
of the state or in the cause of religion, erected those colossal structures with which we are about to become acquainted, it was the
Nile which materially facilitated the transport of their materials,
and enabled the builders of the pyramids and the other ancient
Egyptians to employ the granite of Assuin for the structures of
Memphis, and even for those of Tania, near the coast of the Mediterranean. As the river, moreover, not only afforded a convenient
route for the transport of these building-materials, but also an admirable commercial highway, we find that the Egyptians had acquired
considerable skill at a very early period in constructing vessels
with oars, masts, sails, and even cabins and other appliance;

From the earliest historical period down to the present time the
course of the Nile, from the cataracts down to its bifurcation to the
N. of Cairo, has undergone very tittle change. This, however,
is not the case with its Ihntovcumugs; for, while ancient writers
mention seven (the Pelusiac, the Tanitie, theMendesian, the Bucolic
or Phatnitic, the Sebcnuytie, the Bolhitinic, and the Canopic), there
are now practically two channels only through which the riveris
discharged into the sea. These are the months at Rosetta (Rashid)
and Damietta (Dllmyit), situated near the middle of the Delta, while
the Pelusiae and Canopie mouths, the most important in ancient
tim es, lay at the extreme E. and W. ends of the coast respectively,
