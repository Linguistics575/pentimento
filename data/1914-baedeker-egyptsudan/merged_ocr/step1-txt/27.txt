and Italy. Even cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian government are concerned are tried before this tribunal, which
includes courts of first and second instance. The courts of the first
instance are at Cairo, Alexandria, and Mane'a, and there is a delegation at Port Sand. The appeal-court is at Alexandria. Lists of
qualified barristers are exhibited in the anterooms of the courts. Important civil cases between natives, and all criminal cases, are
tried by the Native Courts (Central Tribunals), established in 1883,
situated at Cairo, Alexandria, Benisueif, Assiiit, Iieneh, Tanta, and
Zalrizili, These form also the tribunals of second instance for the
petty misdemeanours and civil suits dealt with by the Summary
Tribunals (47 in number). In addition there are 108 District Courts
(Marker. Tribunals), Which deal with civil actions and with criminal
cases not involving more than 3 months' imprisonment or a flue of
more than SE 10. The appeal-court for important cases is at Cairo
(at the Bab el-Khalk); about half the number of its judges are Europeans. The procedure is based upon the Code Napoleon.

(7). Egypt as a Health Resort. Medical Hints.
By Leigh Canney, M. D. (Land), F. R. Met. Sue.

The btyneiieial influence of the climate of Egypt (comp. p.1xxvi)
has been known since the Roman period at least, and of late years
an increasing number of visitors have flocked to the Nile to enjoy
the benefits of its remarkably dry winter-climate. Phthisis (if not
too far advanced and if the patient has a sound heart and little or
no fever), asthma, chronic bronchitis, Bright's disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, gout, and diseases of the kidneys are some of the most
important ailments that are at least alleviated by a visit to Egypt.
Invalids should remember that a stay of a few weeks only is not
sufficient, and should remain from the beginning of November to
the end of March. In deciding which of the health-resorts in Egypt
a given case should be sent to, the physician must of course consider
whether or not warmth must be secured along with dryness of air,
whether purity of air alone or also a bright stimulating climate is
to be specially sought, and whether cold winds and blowing sand
are harmful or not. It is advisable in all cases to secure the advice
of the physician resident at the spot selected.

Cairo itself cannot properly be considered a health-resort. The
presence of a large city with its noise and bustle, the higher relatix e humidity, owing to the N. wind and the neighbourhood of the
Delta, and other causes, all combine to compel those who seek health
from the climate of Egypt to look to other stations. There are, however, excellent health-resorts in the immediate vicinity of the capital, such as the Menu House Hotel, the Oasis of New Heliopolis, and
/felwiim Luxor and (still better) Aswan, in Upper Egypt, offer still
more favourable climatic conditions.
