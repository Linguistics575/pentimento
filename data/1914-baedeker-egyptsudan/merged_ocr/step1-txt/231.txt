nieum (sacristy), and numerous other chambers, including an elegant

1911031 iiElliG T0 Anusirt, 5 M. - From the station we ride in a

N. direction to the prettily situated village of Behig and thence to
the N.W. across deserts and fields to (ca. 11/: hr.) *Abusir, the
ruins of the ancient Taposiris Magnet. The remains of this town,
which lay on the plain, are very scanty. The EGYPTIAN TEMPLE,
however, situated on a limestone ridge rising from the seashore, is
in good preservation as far as its enclosing walls are concerned. To
judge from the Greek name of the place, it was probably dedicated
to Osiris. The sanctuary lay from E. to W. and was entered by a
handsome pylon, which, like the rest ot'the walls, is built of blocks
of limestone. In the interior of each of the two towers is an ancient
stairway; from the top we enjoy a magnifieent'i'View of the blue
sea, the desert, and the fertile land in the distance. The pylon is
adjoined by the temple, which was surrounded by lofty walls and
had a length of 295 ft. The rooms in the interior are destroyed. _
A few minutes to the N. of the temple lie the ruins of a Tower,
probably a lighthouse of the Roman period. The rocks in the neighbourhood contain many quarries and Roman tombs, and near the
temple a bath has been excavated which deserves a visit.

line is being prolonged via (1291/3 M.) Bir Fuka and Sidi el-Haggég
to Mirsa Mafrt'th, a seaport (sponge-fisheries) with a new mosque
