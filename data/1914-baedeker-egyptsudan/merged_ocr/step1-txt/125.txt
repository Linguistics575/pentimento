Ile exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews,
and he re-enacted and vigorously enforced the sumptnary laws
of Omar, Nutawakkil, Hakim, and En-Niisiir. Not only were
the colours to be worn by the Christians and Jews prescribed
(the costume of the former being dark-blne, with black turbans,
and a wooden ems we hing tUlm. hung round their necks;
that of the latter, yellow, with black turbans, and a black
hall hung from their necks); but the fashion of their dress and
length of their turbine, and even the costume of their women,

followers of the prophet.

Ili-Ashraf Bars Bey (Bursbey; pp. 53, 113), who had for a
time been the vicegerent of an infant sultan, ascended the
throne on April 1st, ih22. He waged successful campaigns
against Cyprus and the Mongols.

1.rkit Bey (pp. 73, 113) was one of the last independent

Mameluke sultans ongypt. Both as ageneral and a diplomatist he successfully maintained his position against the
