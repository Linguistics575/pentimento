Mariette' 6 House. Auguste Mariette, the famous Egyptologist
(see p. 80), Mst rose into notice by his discovery of the Apis'l'omhs
in 1851; and from 1858 till his death in 1881 was director of the

of the house, who supply coffee prepared in the Arab style. From
this point paths lead to the various points of interest.'

A few hundred yards to the W. of Marictte's House lies the
Egyptian **Serapeum, or subterranean Tombs of Apis, hewn in
the rock.

Apis (p. cxli), the sacred bull of the god Push (p.143), which was Worshipped in a special temple at Memphis, was after death embalmed like a
human being and interred with great pomp in the neevopolis of Memphis.
As early as the reign of Amenophis IU.., and probably still earlier, the Apis

shaft, over which a chapel was erected in honour of the bul1.Under
Iamses II. a large common grave was prepared for the Apis bulls by
Prince Khamu eset-, a subterranean gallery, over 100 yds.in length, wa:
hewn in the rock and flanked with chambers, which were walled 11p after
receiving the wooden eoffin containing the sacred remains. Psauunetiehos I,

to the first one. These vaults, which were added to at intervals down to
the Ptolemaie period., were much larger and more carefully constructed
than the previous series. They have an aggregate length of about 380 yds.
and are about loft. in width and 171/: n. in height. Above them rose

believed that like man (p. cxlviii) the deceased bull was united with Osiris,

became a kind of gud or me dead and was called, like Osiris,'Lord of
the western land'; pilgrims crowded to the tomb to pay their devotions
and to present votive offerings. The last were usually small memorial
tablets, which were inserted in the walls of the subterranean galleries.
The worship of the foreign god Serapis or Summit, introduced under
Ptolemy L, rapidly spread in Egypt, and it is my to understand how
the new Sm'api: was confounded with Osm'apis trad worshipped along with
the latter in the ancient temple in the ueeropolis of Memphis. The temple
itself came to he commonly known as the Sarapeion "Serapeum.

temples were connected by a path enclosed by walls, nn which stood Greek

Passing through the GATEWAY (Pl. a, p. 148 ], we enter a Chamber
(H. b) of considerable dimensions, with niches in the bare limestone walls, where many tombstones of deceased bulls and votive
tablets (see above) were found. Visitors light their candles here.
