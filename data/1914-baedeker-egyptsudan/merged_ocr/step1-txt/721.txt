Mahdi's Tomb. OMDURMAN. 34. Route. 431

Adjoining the Mosque Square on the E. lies the *Tomb of the
Mahdi (P1. rio). This was erected, at the order of the Khalifa, by
an Arab architect, and consisted of a rectangular building 85 ft.
high, surmounted by a lofty dome, and furnished with three arched
windows on each side. After the capture of Omdurrntm the tomb
was destroyed by the British and its contents scattered. - Opposite
the tomb, adjoining the great Mosque, is the *House of the Khalifa
'Abdalhih (P1. 16; see p. 430), a large enclosure, including several
courts and eolonnades, numerous chambers, and a bath-house (adm.
5 pias., including the Mahdi's Tomb). The roof of the tower commands a fine view of Omdurm√©n and its environs. Adjacent are
the House of the British Inspector (P1. 17), and the grave of the
lion. H. G. L. Howard, an English war-correspondent who fell here.
Farther to the E. stands the Military Hospital (191.18), formerly the
House of Sheikh ed-Din, the son of the Khalifa. To the N., on the
site of the walled inner town of El-Buh'a (p. 430), with the quarters
of the Khalifa's bodyguard, stands the Civil Hospital (Pl. B, 1).

We now skirt the N. wall of the Great Mosque, passing the
ruined Hume ofthe Muzitfa Ali Woled Helm, to the Mosque Square
and then follow the broad street traversed by the tramway. To the
right is the Government School (Pl. B, i, 2); to the left, in an open
space, is the Cattle Market (P1. 20). The street ends at the *LARGE
MARKET (P1. A, B, 1), on which the various bazaars converge and
which presents a busy and variegated scene of African life. All the
articles of consumption of Central Africa are to be seen here in
profusion: curious spices of a hundred different varieties, drugs,
and perfumes; soda, saltpetre, salt; betel, bead-nuts, seeds, and
wood of every kind; ostrich-feathers, glass beads, toilet-butter,'angaribs (bedsteads), the dried flesh of wild animals, etc. The Bazaar
of the Silversmiths (PI. 24) is especially interesting. Skilful smiths,
and saddlers dealing with hippopotamus hide, may be seen at work.
Many articles here, however, are manufactured specially for tourists.
The place of execution (P1. 23) under the Khalifa was in the Date
Market. The Stilt el-Harfm (formerly limited to women-dealers) is
devoted to fruit, mil ornaments, ointments, and basket-work. To the F is the Past Telegraph tWce (PI. 20).
