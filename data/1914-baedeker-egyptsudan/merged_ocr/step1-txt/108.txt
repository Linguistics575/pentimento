Amenophis IV. (1375-1358 13.0.) endeavoured to replace the old
religion by the worship of a single deity, vis. the sun, an
attempt perhaps to provide a god that should be worshipped in
common by all the peoples of the extensive empire o. cxlvi). The
movement was probably instigated by the priests of Heliopolis
and was directed at first only against the gods of Thebes, who,
during the New Empire, had thrown all others into the shade.
Many of the ancient deities, especially those of Thebes, were
fauatically'persecuted', their images and names being removed
from all monuments. For his own original name, in which the
name of Amon occurs, the king substituted that of Ekh-en-Aton,
'the disk of the sun rejoices'. Tell el-'Amarua (p.211) was
made the capital instead ofThebes. AmenophisIV. was buried at
Bibin el-Mul6k tp. 238). After his death internal commotion:
broke out and the new religion was abolished.

el-'Amarna, p. 216, and at Bibén el-Mul1tlr, p. 298) and Tutenkh-Amun, who transferred the royal residence back to Thebes.
