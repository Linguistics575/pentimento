lviii ll. GEOGRA 1'lll0hl, AND h. Modern Egyptians:

fine and almost Caucasian east of features, their very dark, bronze <
coloured complexion, and their luxuriant growth of hair, which they
wear loose or hanging down in numberless plaits. Their figures are
beautifully symmetrical, and more or less slender in accordance with
their means of subsistence, and their limbs are gracefully formed.
In other respects they resemble all the other children of the desert,
as in the purity of their complexion, the peculiar thinness of their
necks, and the premature wrinkling of the skin of their faces. Compared with their bold and quarrelsome neighbours the Jlishirtn, the
rAirahleir are generally gentle and inoffensive.

Besides the Bega there are numerous Beduins who inhabit the
steppes and deserts belonging to the region of the Nile, but beyond
the limits of Egypt, and range as far as the eonfines of the heathen
negro-raees on the left bank of the Nile, nearly to SP N. latitude;
but with these we have not at present to deal. As regards the
Beduins proper of the N., their common home, the desert, seems
to have exerted a unifying effect upon races that were originally
different, and the peculiar characteristics of each have gradually
disappeared before the uniform environment of all.

There are three important Beduin tribes in the peninsula of
Mount Sinai: the Tertibiytn; the Tiyaha, who occupy the heart of
the peninsula, between Suez and'Ahaha; and the SawÃ©rkeh or ElJAraytsh, to the north of the latter. In Upper Egypt, besides the
(Ahebdeh, the most important tribes who occupy the eastern bank of
the Nile are the Beni Weed and the Aiwtini, who, however, have now
settled on both banks of the 1'hoban Nile valley and are gradually
blending with the fellahin, and the Ma" z-eh, who dwell in groups
among the limestone mountains between Sue), and KenehY where
there are good pastures at places. Most of the Arabian Beduins, on
the other hand, who belong to Egypt, eonfine themselves to the
westernhank of the Nile. They occupy the whole of this side of the
river from the Faiytam as far as Abydos near Girgeh, and it is mainly
with their aid that communication is maintained with the western
oases, peopled by a totally different race, who till the ground and
possess no camels, being probably allied to the Berbers of Northern
Africa (one of the numerous Libyan tribes mentioned in ancient
inscriptions). A

The Beduins of the North, and especially the tribe of the Uldd
'Ali, have inherited with comparative purity the fiery blood of the
desert-tribes, who achieved such marvellous exploits under the
banner of the prophet, but the traveller will rarely come in contact
with them unless he undertakes a journey across the desert. The
Beduins who assist travellers in the ascent of the pyramids belong
to the Nag'ama tribe. Genuine Beduins are to be found nowhere
except in their desert home, where to a great extent they still retain
the spirit ofindepeudenee, the courage, and the restlessness of their
ancestors. As in the time of Herodotus, the tent of the Ileduin is
