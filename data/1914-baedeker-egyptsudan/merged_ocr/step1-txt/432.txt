From Ebshuai a carriage-road leads to the N., at Mst through
cultivated land, then crossing the ancient bed of the lake. Various
small water-courses and canals are crossed; and after a ride oft hr.
we reach the banks of the Birket Karim, which are covered with
reeds and tamarisk shrubs. Here lies the 115m Monte, which belongs to the owner of the Hotel Karoun in Medinet el-Faiytorn
(9.191) and consists of two ordinary bedrooms and of four sleepingtents with "f, beds each (pens. 80 pias.Y Boat on the lake 16

The Birket Karim, lie.'lake of Ken'm' (the Hebrew Korah), is
the Lake Mani: of the Greeks (comp. p. 190). It measures 25 M. in
length and, at its broadest part, is barely 6M. Wide. At the ferry
to Dimei the depth is not above 16 ft., but it is said to increase
towards the S.W. The greenish water is slightly brackish and is not
tit for drinking. The N. bank is sterile, but on the S. the cultivated
land often reaches as far as the lake. The right of fishing is let by
government, and the whole of the fishermen on the lake are in the
service of the lessee. Water-fowl are sometimes abundant but are
far too shy to be approached within gunshot.

The lake is crossed with a favourable wind in about 2 hrs. To
the E. appears a considerable peninsula, with rubbish-heaps. In
the lake lies the large island celled thilret el-/rurn, or'island of
the horn', On the N. bank of the lake are barren hills of considerable
height. From the landing-place a somewhat steep path ascends to
the (13/4 M.) ruins and temple of
Dimei (Dimay). The fortified position of this town, named in
antiquity Soknopaiou NÃ©sos, i.e.'island of 8okuopaiost (a form of
Sobek, the Faiytun deity), provided a secure point of departure
