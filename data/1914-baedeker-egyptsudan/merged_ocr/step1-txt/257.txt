Mr.Beadue11 in the Libyan desert. In the centre room are three skulls
(preserved entire) of the Arsinoi'therium Zittelii (a species of monster
rhinoceros; from the Faiyum); bones of the Paleeomastodon and Mozritherium, the oldest known representatives of the order of pachydermata; and
two complete specimens of a monster tortoise (Testudo Ammonia). In the
side-rooms are mineralogical and geognostic specimens ffine auriferous
quartz) and a complete collection of the fossils characteristic of the various
geological formations of Egypt.

Adjoining the Museum are the Institut Egyptian (p. 42) and the
Chemical Laboratory of the Survey Department; in the S.W. corner
of the grounds is the Geographical Society (p. 42); and in the NE.
angle, the Public Health Department Laboratory and the Bacteriological Institute. At the E. end of the ministerial building is the
tWee of the Department of Public Health (Services Sanitaire').

Farther on, on the left side of the Shtrir Ifas.r el" Aini, lie the
Education Offee (Minist√©re de I'Instruction Publique; Pl. A, 6) and
the Na.sr'iyeh Training College. Behind the latter, in the Shin" elMunira, is the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology (p. d'?.,). The
continuation of the Shin" Kasr el-tAini passes on the right side the
large Hospital aflfay el-'Ai' (Pl. A, 7; p. 40), with the small Mosque
of the same name. - Thence to the Midcin Fumm el-Khalig and to
Old Cairo, see pp. 104 et seq.

2. The Muski and its Side Streets.

A visit to the chief Bazaars (comp. p. 50), to which this section is devoted, is so full of novelty and interest that the traveller will scarcely have
time to combine with the first visit the inspection of the Mosques passed on
the way. - Both ladies and gentlemen, aided by the following description
and the plan of the town (p.;), may plunge fearlessly into the thickest of
the crowd, especially ifthey do not mind taking an occasional wrong turning.

The chief thoroughfare of the Arabian part of Cairo is the
*Muski (Pl. C, D, 3), which begins at the square of El-'Ataba el-.
Khadra (p. 51) and, with its continuations the Sikkeh el- Gedideh
(see below) and the Shari esh- Sharawini (PLE, F ,3), traverses the
entire breadth of the old town (nearly 1 M.). This street has now to
a great extent lost its external oriental characteristics. The 1111111erous tobacco and cigar stores and emporiums of clothing present
quite a European exterior. But the oriental features of the traftie
o. 46) that surges up and down the street from morning till night
are still unchanged. At the end of the Muski, a little short of the
square known as Silk el-Kanto (P1. D, 3), we enter the old city of
the Fatimites (p. M), the second wall of which, erected after 1074,
is still represented by the Bib en-liter (p. 77),
its N. gates, and the Bib Zuweilch (p. 60), its S. gate. Its W.
boundary was the old canal of El- Khalig, now the Shari Khalig elMatti (tramway No. 5, p. 38). - We follow the continuation of the
Muski, the SLKKBH E -+aDtmus (RUB NEUVB), to the insignificant
Gdrnir cl-Ashraf (Pl. E,' oomph p. 58), a mosque built by Sultan Bars
Bey in 1422. Here foot-passengers turn to the left (carriages go
