w. ANCIENT HISTORY.

Apries or Uaphris CWeli-eb-rii; the Hophrah of the Bible)
made another attempt to recover Syria, but was unable to
prevent the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in
586. A military rebellion in Libya dethroned Apries, and
his general Amasis was proclaimed king.

Amasis (Ahmose) secured his supremacy by marriage with
a daughter of Psammetichos 11. A campaign undertaken
by Nebuchadnezzar against Egypt led to the final abaudonment of the Egyptian claims upon Syria. Amasis assigned the city of' Naucratis (p. 32) to Greek colonists,

A who speedily made it the most important commercial town
in the empire. A friendly alliance was made with Polycrates, tyrant of Samos.

Psammetichos III. was defeated at Pelusium by the Persian
king Oambyses, and Egypt became a Persian province.

'XXVII. DYNASTY. PERSIAN DOMINATION.

The Persian monarchs appeared as successors to the native
rulers and by their moderation found favour with the greater
part of the population. The old religion was unmolested.

Gambyses led an unsuccessful expedition, via Khirgeh,
against the oases of the Libyan Desert and a campaign
against Ethiopia.

Darius L endeavoured to promote the prosperity of Egypt
in every possible way. The canal from the Nile to the
Red Sea was completed (p. 182). A strong garrison was
sent to the oasis of Ehirgeh and a temple was built there
to Amen (p. 381). After the battle of Marathon the
Egyptians, headed by Khabbash, revolted and expelled the
Persians. The insurrection, however, was queued by
Xerxes L, who appointed his brother Achaemenes satrap.

Artaxerxesl. During his reign the Egyptians again revolted.
Faroe (Ert-Har-erow), prince of Marea, aided by the
Athenians, defeated Ael1asmenes, the Persian satrap, but
the allied Egyptians and Greeks were in turn defeated by
the Persian general Megabyzos near Prosopitis, an island
in the Nile, and [ name was erueified.

Herodotus visited Egypt.

Darius II. The Persian power gradually declined. Under
Artaxerxes II. and his successor
Artaxerxes III. the Egyptians once more revolted and succeeded in regaining their independence for a brief period
under native rulers, whom Manetho assigns to the 2830th Dynasties.

*XXVIII. DYNASTY.
Amyrtaeos of Sais maintained his authority for a short time only.
In Lower Egypt several dynasties contended for sovereignty.
