effective ornamentation. Broad pilasters, only 3 inches in depth
and placed at wide intervals, project from the wall. Above each
are a gigantic falcon and serpent.

The W. side of the terrace is bounded by two raised colonnades,
that to the right named the Birth Colonnade, that to the left the
Punt Colonnade.

The BIRTH COLONNADE contains li pairs of square pillars supporting the roof. On all four sides of the pillars is the same scene:
Anion laying his hand in blessing upon the shoulder of Hatshepsut (figure defaced throughout) or Thutmosis III. The inscriptions
and representations on the walls of the colonnade refer to the procreation and birth of the queen CPI. e). Among these are two fine
figures of the queen-mother Ahmes, once in presence of the ramheaded Khuum and the frog-headed IIeket, and once in presence of
the ibis-headed Thout. -... Two steps at the N. end of this eolonnade
descend to a VESTIBULE with 12 sixteen-sided columns. On the
walls are fine reliefs.

In the S. Wall is a small Recess with representations of the queen (effuced) before various deities; above appears the queen (again scratched
out) before Osiris. To the left of the recess is Anubis, behind whom
stood the queen; to the right are Nekhbeyet and Harakhte, between
whom were the names of the queen.- In the N. Wall is a similar Recast.
Above it is Thutmosis m. making a lihation of wine to the falcon-headed
Soker, god ofthe dead; to the right, Anubis and the queen (scratched
out)', to the left, the queen (scratched out) standing in a chapel before the
symbol of Eme-wet. - On the W. (rear) Wall, the queen (scratched out)
sacrificing to Amen (to the hem and to Anubis (to the right), with the
sacrificial gifts heaped up before each god.

Three steps at the back of the vestibule lead to a CHAPEL OF ANUBIS.
consisting of three chambers with vaulted ceilings. The colouring of
the bas-reliefs is admirably preserved, though the figure of the queen is
invariably scratched out. They represent Hatshepsut before various deities,
especially Anubis. Thutmosis ILL occurs once on the E. wall of the second
chamber, pouring water before Saker.

On the N. side of the terrace is an tsntinished COLONNADE, the
roof of which is supported by 15 sixteen-sided columns. Behind
it are four chambers (now walled up).

We now turn to the COLONNADS ur PUNT, on the S. side of the
W. terrace, exactly corresponding with the Birth Colonnade. The
*Scenes on the walls, some of which are unfortunately much darnaged, commemorate a trading expedition to Punt (p. 223), undertaken during the queen's reign. On the 8. Wall we see a village
in Punt (Pl. f). The beehive huts are built over the water amongst
palms and incense-trees; ladders lead up to the entrances. In the
lower row, to the right, is the reception of the Egyptian envoy
and his suite by the Prince of Punt; above, the envoy in front of
his tent, looking at the gifts that have been heaped upon him. I On the W. Wall we see, to the left (Pl. g), the arrival of the
Egyptian fleet at Punt, where it is laden with precious merchandize; to the right is the return of the fleet. Above are the inhabitants
of Punt and the Egyptians with their gifts; while prostrate grandees
