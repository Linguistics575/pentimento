are British officers and offieialis, but the Ma'mirs are Egyptian officers. The revenues of the Stsdin Government in its first year (1899

amounted to g) E 126 ,596, its expenditure to 2 E 230,238; in
1912 the revenue and expenditure were respectively J) E 1,428,600
and SE 1490, 700, while for 1913 the anticipated revenue is
SE 1,631,000. The development of the railway system and the
2t'fid'i'ii" irrigation, now being actively carried out, by which cottongrowing especially is furthered (camp. pp. 432, 433), ensure a great
economic future for the Sudan. In 1909 the net profits of the
Sudanese railways were d) E 72 ,039, in 1912 £17: 133,753; in 1909
the value of the cotton crop was SE 63,000, in 1911 it was SE
267, 000. In 1912 over 2,000,000 acres were under cultivation as
against 1,235,500 acres in 1008. The total value of exports in
1909 was SE i, 377, 000, and in 1912 SE
1 ,373, 000, the value of imports in each of these years was £E
1,360,000, 570, 000, and SE 2,261,000. An ad valorem tax
of 20 per cent is levied upon the export of gum, india- rubber, and
ivory; certain articles of general consumption are taxed 10 per
cent of their value in the towns; and among the other sources of
revenue are taxes upon date-palms, boats, and irrigation wheels,
the house tax, the land sale tax etc. The considerable import trade
in cotton goods, sugar, liquors, iron goods, and machinery is in
the hands of Greek and Arab merchants (gellahe) The great bulk
of these goods comes via Port Sudan (p. 425). Beside the Egyptian
coins the Maria Theresa dollar, a reproduction of the Austrian
issue of 1780 (Arab. riyal Abu mea), equivalent to 81/2 or 9 pies,
is current in the districts adjoining the Abyssinian frontier (Senntr,
Kassala) and in Eritrea. It is not legal tender in the sham but is
the only coin the Abyssinians will accept. British sovereigns also
are current in the Sedan and are accepted by the government.

The CLIMATE resembles that of Upper Egypt (p.1xxvii), though
the maximum of temperature is higher and the occasional variations
have a greater range. At Khar.trim the maximum heat is reached
twice a year, in April or May (1130 Fahr.) and September (109°
Fahr.). Violent sand-storms (Arab. Jia60b) are frequent from May
to September, followed by deluges of rain, which are apt to cause
fever. A The best SEASON for a visit to the St1dtn is between Nov.
and Feb. inclusive, though March also is frequently suitable.
