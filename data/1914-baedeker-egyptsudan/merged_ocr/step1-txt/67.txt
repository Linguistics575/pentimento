guarantees the character and abilities of members when hired. Thefts
are very rarely committed by the Nubians, but in cases of the kind the
sheikh compels the whole of his subjects to contribute to repair the
loss, and cases have been known in which several hundred pounds
have been recovered in this way. The result is that there is a
strict mutual system ot'supervision, and suspected characters are
unceremoniously excluded from the fraternity. Nubian women are



CO). SGDAN NBGROES. Like the Nubians, most of the negroes in
Egypt are professors ofHslirn, to the easily intelligible doctrines
of which they readily and zealously attach themselves. Most of the
older negroes and negresses with whom the traveller meets have
originally been brought to Egypt as slaves, and belong to natives,
by whom they are treated more like members of the family than
like servants. The eunuchs, who also belong almost exclusively to
the negro races, very seldom avail themselves of any opportunity of
regaining their liberty, as their emancipation would necessarily terminate the life of ease and luxury in which they delight. - The
numerous negroes who voluntarily settle in Egypt form the dregs of
the people and are employed in the most menial offices

Most of the negro-raees of Central Africa to the N. of the
equator are represented at Cairo, particularly in the rank and file of
the negro regiments. In 1907 there were 65,162 natives of the
St1dtn settled in Egypt.

(7). TURKS. Although the dynasty of the vieeroys of Egypt is
of Turkish origin (see p. css), a comparatively small section of the
community belongs to that nation. According to the census of 1907
there were 27,591 genuine Turks in Egypt, besides 42,134 Turkish
subjects from other parts of the Ottoman empire (Syria, Arabia,
Armenia). The Turks of Egypt are chiefly to be found in the towns,
where most ot'them are government-officials, soldiers, and merchants.
The Turkish language is very little understood in Egypt.

(S). LEVANTINES, SYRIANS, etc. Alink between the various
classes of dwellers in Egypt and the visitors to the banks of the
Nile is formed by the members of the various Mediterranean races,
especially the Christian Syrians, known when of partly European
origin as Levantines, who have been settled here for several generations, and form no inconsiderable element in the population of the
larger towns. Most of them profess the Latin form of Christianity,
and Arabic has now become their mother tongue, although they
speak also French, Italian, or English. They are good men of
business, and are often employed as shopmen and clerks. Their
services have also become indispensable at the consulates and in
several of the government-om' A large, proportion of them are
wealthy. The Egyptian press is very largely in the hands of Syrian,
Levantines, a great many of whom are lawyers, physicians, and
chemists also.
