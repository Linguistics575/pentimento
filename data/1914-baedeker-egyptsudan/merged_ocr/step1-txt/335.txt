whence the Greek name llcliopolis) and the hnman-headed Atum, to
whom the sacred Mnevis Bull was consecrated. To these was dedicated the
famous temple,'the House of Re', built on the site of an earlier edifice
by Amenemhit f., first king of the 12th I) yn., in front of which bis son
and successor 8esostris l. erected two great obelisks (see below) in
celebration of an important anniversary A large section of the Egyptian religious literature was due to the priests of Heliopolis, and their
doctrines were widely disseminated throughout the country at a very
early period, so that Itrrrlariskhte was one of the most highly venerated
deities in Egypt. - Even during the Greek period these priests enjoyed
a high reputation for wisdom; Herodotus converged with them and Plato
is said to have spent thirteen years with them, in order to learn some
at least of their doctrines. - Under the New Empire the temple of
1leliopolis was the largest and most richly endowed in all Egypt, next to
the temple of Amen at Thebes. - When Straho (b. about 60 B.C.) visited
Egypt the city had been destroyed, but the temple was still intact, except for some minor injuries attributed to Camhyses; even the houses of
the priests and the apartments of Plato and his Friend Eudoxus Were
shown to the traveller. The priestly school, however, had ceased to exist,
and only a few officiating priests and guides for foreigners resided there.

The outer walls, rising in all directions from the fields, are
now the only vestiges of the city, while of the temple nothing is
left but a few scanty ruins and a solitary Obelisk (Arab. El-llIisalla).
The latter is of red granite of Syene (Assmin, p. 354) and is 66 ft.
high. It is surrounded by a wooden fence and rises picturesquely
amid mulberry-trees. Each of the four sides bears the same inscription in bold hieroglyphics, recording that Sesostris I. (Senwosret),
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the
sun, whom the (divine) spirits oiOn Uleliopolis) love, ete., founded
the obelisk on the first festival of Set Ca kind ofjubilee celebration).
The pyramidium at the top and the falcons which begin the inscriptions on each side were once covered with metal. The companion
obelisk (for these monuments were always erected in pairs) stood
down to the 12th century.

To the W. of the obelisk the remains of the temple may he recognized in a few blocks of granite, bearing inscriptions by Ramses II. On
one Ramses 11. appears offering a libation to Atum. - The A'etropolis of
Heliopolis lies about 3 M. to the E. of the obelisk.

The excursion may be extended to the villages of El-Mary or ElMerg (21/2 M.), with some ruins of the 13th Dym, and Ahdn.kdh, on the
