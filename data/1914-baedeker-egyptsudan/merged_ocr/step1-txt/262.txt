The Sanctuary (Ltwin el- Wuni0, with its nine aisles, now forming the principal lecture- hall, has 140 marble columns (100 antique)
and covers an area of about 3600 sq. yds. The front and older part
is low in the ceiling. The part at the back, to which we ascend by
a few steps, has considerably higher arcades (restored). The hall is
imperfectly lighted. A staircase to the right of'Abd er-Ralumtn's
pulpit (minbar) ascends to an upper story, which is assigned to
students from Mecca and Yemen. On the B. side is the Tomb of
'Abd er-Ral.unin (P1. 13). The N. side is bounded by the very
elegant little mosque of Zdtviyet Gahargiyeh (P1. 14; restored).

The ceilings of the Northern and of the Southern Liwan are
supported by double colonnades. The N. Ltwtn is adjoined by the
Court of solutions (P1. 16), with a basin in the centre.

The Lateral Ltwcme and many of the subsidiary buildings of
the mosque are set apart as sleeping or working apartments (riwilrs,
literally'galleries') for the use of students of particular countries or
of particular provinces of Egypt (tromp. the Plan and its reference
numbers 17-27, p. 57). From the W. angle of the Great Court we
proceed to the Small Mosque (Riw√©lt el-rAlduhi; Pl. 30), built by
'Abbis 11., the reigning Khedive. One of its doors brings us back to
the Shtrit el-Azhar.

Leaving the insignifioant Mosque of Mohammad Bey Abu Dahab
(p.carx) on the left, we follow the SHAH" msixmr (PLE, 3),
called also 8125: es-fits" or bazaar for wares from the SMin (gum,
dim- -pa1m nuts, etc.), which leads direct to the Shim" el-Ashrafiyeh,
opposite the Mosque of Ashraf (p. 53).

From the Shari el- -Ashrafiyeh, on the left side of the Mosque of
Ashraf, the 51mm u-szxw: es sheen; WI. E, 3), with the bazaar of the
same name, leads to the W The Suk e1 Hamziwi is the bazaar of the
Christian merchants (Syrians and Copts), who vie with their Mohammedan
fellow- tradesmen in the exorbitance of their demands, and whose chief
wares are European calico, porcelain, and drugs (which last are sold in
nearly all the bazaars). This narrow winding street is prolonged to the
S. by the SHAH" EL-Ksnin, to the left of which (approached
by a side- Jane) is the Orthodox Greek church of St. Nicholas (PI.D, E, d).
- Just at the beginning of the Shari el- Hamzawi es.M.leghtr, we observe
on the left the covered & Virf et-Tarbfyeh (Pl. E 3), with the Sitk el-'A.ttkrin,
or spice- market, which is easily distinguished by its aromatic odours.
The perfumes of Arabia, genuine and adultenterl iv-candies, and drugs
are the chief commodities here. Attar of roses is sold by weight at high
prices. The small bottles into which it is usually put contain only one
drop Then follow the weavers and tailors A small lane to the left
(named'A.tfet esh- Sharm) leads to the Ghuri Mosque (p. 59 9).

The 1t1 et- Tarbiyeh is continued to the S. by the Shari" el- PM.
Mmm (P1. E, 3,4), in which is the bazaar for wares from Tunis and
Algiers. We'iih observe drug-stalls and then magazines for light-coloured
woollen and other stuifa, Arabian rugs, ete. - We now proceed to the

sharp to the left and pursue the same direction, parallel with the Shari
