the upper floor (B), on each side of which is a semicircular recess with benches, we enter a Rowen », CO). In the middle of this,
covered by a kind of cupola, is a shaft leading to the lower stories.
To the right lie two SMALLER 1loous (D, E), with niches and sarcophagi. Above the latter are loculi or slie1r-iornhs. To the left
is the'I'RICLINIUM FUNEBRE (F), a large room with a ceiling home
by four pillars. Three wide platforms or divans have been hewn
out of the rock for the banquets held in honour of the deceased. The STAIRCASE (G), which commands a good view of the chief sepulchral chambers, divides farther down into two tr1ghts, flanking
the entrance to the lower story (11) and leading to the VESTIBULE (J)

The faqade of the vestibule is articulated by two Egyptian columns, with elaborate flower-capitals, which bear a cornice adorned
with the winged solar disk and with falcons; above this is the flat
arch of the pediment. Inside, in deep niches to the right and left,
are STATUES of the deceased and his wife in Egyptian dress, carved
in white limestone. The door in the rear wall of the vestibule is
surmounted by the winged sun's disk and a Urzeus frieze. To the
right and left, on pedestals, are two large serpents with the Egyptian
double crown, the caduceus of Hermes, and the thyrsus of Dionysos. Above are shields with heads of Medusa.

We now enter the SmuLcunAL CHAMBER (K). The sarcoPhagi
containing the remains stand in niches (a-c) and are hown, like
their lids, out of the solid rock. The fronts are adorned, after the
Greek fashion, with festotms, masks, heads of Medusa, buerania,
and bunches of grapes. On the middle one is a reclining figure of
