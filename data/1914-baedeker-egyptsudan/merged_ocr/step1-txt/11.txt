PREFACE. I f LI

Ever since the attention of the civilized world was redirected to Egypt at the beginning of the 19th century, the
scientific investigation of its innumerable monuments has
pointed with ever-growing certainty to the valley of the Nile
as the cradle of history and of human culture. At the same
time Egypt, like other Eastern countries, possesses high natural attractions, in the peculiar charms of its oriental climate, the singularly clear atmosphere, the wonderful colouring and effects of light and shade, the exuberant fertility of
the cultivated districts contrasted with the solemn desert,
and the manners, customs, and appearance ofa most interesting and most diversified population.

The HANDBOOK TO EGYPT'I', of which the present is the
seventh edition, is founded on the combined work of several
Egyptologists and other Oriental scholars. Among the former
must be specially mentioned Professor Georg 8teindorf, of
Leipzig University, who has edited the German Handbook
since the year 1897, and has also supervised the preparation
of the English editions. The Editor gratefully acknowledges
also the information received from numerous correspondents
and official sources Which has often proved most useful; any
further corrections or suggestions will be highly appreciated.

The Editor hopes, that by confining himself to essential
points and by carefully arranging his material, he has succeeded, within small compass, in supplying the traveller with
the necessary information regarding the country and the
people he is about to visit. An attempt has been made to indicate clearly the most important among the bewildering multiplieity of the monuments of antiquity, and the descriptions
of these have been so arranged that, assuming the traveller to
have previously read at his leisure our account of the origin,
history, and significance of a particular temple or tomb, etc.,

t The contents of the Handbook are divided into FOUR SECTIONS
fr. Introdnclnry Matter. Approaches to Egypt, pp. i-cxc and 1-6; Ir. Lower
