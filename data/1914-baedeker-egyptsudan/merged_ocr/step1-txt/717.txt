Ehartpim or Khartoum (1252 ft), the capital of the Sedan and
the residence of the Sirdar and Governor-General, is situated in N.
lat. 150 36' and E. long 320 32', on the left bank of the Blue Nile,
immediately above its confluence with the White Nile (comp. p. lxiv).
The name, meaning'elisphaut's trunk', refers to the shape of the
long peninsula that ends on the N.W. in the Mogren Point (p.429).
The town was built in 1823-30 by Mohammed Ali and quickly rose
to prosperity as the southernmost depot of the trade of Egypt, so that
it is said to have had 70,000iuhab. in 1882. During the rebellion
of the Mahdi (p. cxxiv) General Cordon, who was despatched hither
by the British government to withdraw the garrisons in the SMin,
entered the town 011 Feb. 18th, 1884, and defended it until Jan. 26th,
1885 (comp. p.428). The town was reduced to ruins by the Mahdists,
but has been rebuilt since the capture of Omdurm√©n in 1898.
Its ground-plan, designed by Lord Kitchener as a series of'Union
Jacks', somewhat recalls that of Washington, with its broad streets
and large squares. In 1909 the town, including Omdurman and the
suburbs, contained 1i0,682inhah. CKhar.tt1m 18,235; Omdrrnuin
42,779; Ehar.tilm North 35,285; Geili 14,383 ]; of these 106,286
were natives of the Stadtn, 1734 were Europeans, and 2662 were
Abyssinians, Egyptians, Indians, etc. Most of the houses have but
one story and are built of brick, though in the better ones free use
is made also of white Kerreri sandstone and limestone from Gebel
Auli; they are frequently surrounded by fine gardens.

The TREES and PLAN" that occur in the private and public gardens
at Khartam nearly all belong to the Sudanese flora, with the eonspieuous
exception of the date-palm. Among them the following may be specially
mentioned: the curious Sudanese Balaenites uEgyptiaca or soap-tree (Arab.
eI-heglig), the bark of which has the property of converting fatty substances
into soap', the Salvadora Persica (Arab. el-arak), by some supposed to be
the mustard-tree of the Bible; and the saccharine but poisonous Callotroyis
procera (Arab. el-ushar), a large-leaved Asclepiadea. Some specimens of Ihe
gigantic Adansonia digital", baobab, or monkey-bread-iree (Arab. el-homr),
may be observe. the town; the thick trunk of this tree is often hollowed
out by the natives and used as it stands as a cistern. There are also
several Pnrkinsonias, Sesbanias, and a few coffee-plants. - AGRICULTURE
is carried on by the Nubian fellahin in the primitive manner of the

Dongolese, without plough or harrow, but none the 1tty industriously.
Their sagiyeh, or water-wheels (p. lxxii), are sometimes 25 ft. and more in
