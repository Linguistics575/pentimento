Y. HIEROGLYPHICS. cxxvii

A great advance was made when words, for which there was

no special sign, began to be expressed by the pictures of other
and different objects, the phonetic significance of which, however,
happened to be the same. Thus, e.g., pr'to go out' was expressed by
the picture of a house [ 2'1 ], because a'house' also was called pr,
s"son' by a'goose' s'; tpy'first' by the sign I (p'dagger'.

Many of these characters gradually came to be used for so many
different words that their original word-signiistion was lost, and
they thenceforth were used as of purely syllabie value. Thus, the
sign p', originally'to fly', was afterwards used for the syllable p'

in any signifieation; "r, originally'pigeon' and afterwards also 1rr
'great', was used for any syllable um in this way word-signs also
came to be used as letters; mg. 0 r'rnoutV Was used for r;
(2:2) s"lake' for S, - "u-)'i-l'serpent' (t is the feminine termination) for 9, - etc.

These syllable and literal signs were probably used at first
for grammatical purposes only (as suiiihesj, but afterwards, owing
to frequent ambiguities in the significance of the verbal signs, they
were used to indicate the pronunciation in each particular case
and thus to render the reading easier. Thus to the sign Sits u-r

'great' a < ccz > r was frequently added, written thus' u-r,

in order to indicate the pronunciation; or'nl)'to live' was

followed by the two explanatory consonants MAW n and Â© I },
thus "iij"'nh; or U N:'lord' was preceded by tttoth n, thus
"at," nb. Frequently all the consonants in a word were written

instead of merely the verbal sign, thus, 2 Isl) s'tt'field' instead of Q Q, JY.

In addition to these there was another class of hieroglyphics,

known as Determinatives, which were placed after the word in
order to give some hint as to its meaning. Thus, e.g., saw'to

--F-drink' is written Stra' with the determinative' (a man with
0

his finger in his mouth) in order to indicate that the idea expressed
by swo- has something to do with the mouth. These determinatives,
which greatly facilitate the reading of inscriptions, were freely used,
especially in later hieroglyphic periods.

The hieroglyphic system, as we find it in the earlier Egyptian
inscriptions, is already complete; its development, briefly sketched
above, had already come to a close. The following different classes
of hieroglyphic characters were used simultaneously.
