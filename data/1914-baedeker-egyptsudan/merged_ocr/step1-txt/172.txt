rock. The larger temple of Abu Simbel (p. 404) is entirely a rock
building, the pylon and the colossiincluded. At Abydos the difficulty
of excavating the rock was avoided by placing the part of the temple
containing the slaughter-cout and other offices at right angles to
the main edifice, so that the whole new presents the form of a -n

Although many small temple-buildings of the LIBYAN Evocn
and the LATE PERIOD are still in existence, almost nothing has
come down to our day of the large temples, with the exception of
the temple of Hibis, in the Oasis of Khirgeh (p. 381), which was
erected in the time of the Persians. Nearly all the kings of that
period resided in the Delta (Bubastis, Sais), and therefore markedly favoured the North in erecting their monuments. There the
sanctuaries were built of limestone, and in medieval and modern times the blocks have either found their way into lime-kilns,
or, since the Delta itself yields but scanty building-materials, have
been utilized for new buildings, usually leaving only the more lefractory blocks of granite behind. It was not until the days of the
Ptolemies that attention was once more directed to the South. These
monarchs raised many large temples to the gods of the country,
usually on the site of earlier ruined buildings. All these temples
are built on one uniform plan, differing but slightly from the older
forms (comp. the Plan of the temple at Edfu, p. 344, with that of
the Ramesseum, p. 306). There is a difference in only one essential
point. The sanctuary for the boat is surrounded on three sides by
corridors, on which open smaller chambers. This innovation, which
is seen for the first time in the temple of Khons at Karnak (20th
Dye), provided the temple proper with a chapel closed all round.
The earlier temples were often altered to conform to this new plan,
and a separate boat-ehamber was inserted among the older rooms
(e.g. in the temple at Luxor, and in the great temple at Karnak).
The side-rooms also are numerous at this period and among these
special mention must be made of a small 8aerifeial Court situated
on the right side (see Plan of Edfu, p. 344) and an elegant Kiosque
adjoining it (ill). Rooms of this kind occur, however, even in some
of the older temples.

From the earliest known period all flat surfaces on pylons, interior walls, column-shafts, and ceilings were covered with representations and inscriptions. The external walls, the pylons, and
the walls of the courts, i.. those parts of the temple that were exposed to the vulgar eye, commemorated above all the exploits of
the king, campaigns, great festivals, or other important events of
his reign; the representations were intended to keep the power and
nobility of the Pharaoh constantly before his people. On the other
hand the representations in the interior of the temple were exclusively devoted to the religious proceedings that took place there.
