le, shown before Anson-Ile-Harald) ping a band of enemies
by the hair and smiting them with his club. The faleorehcadad god
hands him the curved sword and leads to him by a cord the captured
lands, which are represented in the accustomed manner (p. 272)
by circular walls enclosing their names and surmounted by bound
enemies. Beneath are two other rows of representations of conquered lands. Further to the left, between two grooves for the
tlag-staffs, is a similar but much smaller scene, and beneath is a
long inscription, describing in exceedingly exaggerated language
the victory won by Ramses m. oxen" the Lihyans in the 11th year
of his reign. At the foot Amon is seated to the left, with Ptah
standing behind, inscribing the years of the king's reign on a palmbranch. The king kneels before Amon, under the sacred tree, and
receives from the god the hieroglyphs for'jubilee ol' the reign',
suspended on a palm-branch, as a symbol oflong life. Thout writes
the king's name on the leaves ofthe tree, and beside him stands the
goddess Svshot. To the right of the portal, below, is a stele ol' the
12th year of the king (imitated from a stele of the 35th year of
Ramses II. at Abu Simbel, p. 408), representing the gifts made to
the god Ptah. The Left Tower (Pl. Jo) bears similar scenes and
inscriptions.

Through the Central Portal (Pl. d), embellished within and
without by representations of the king worshipping the gods, we
enter the First Court, forming an approximate square of 115 ft.
The inner side of the first pylon is adorned with scenes from the
Libyan campaign of Ramses (see above). To the S. (P1. c) is a
battle, in which the Egyptians are aided by mercenaries from among
the Shardana (p. 322), who are distinguished by their round helmets
ornamentcd with horns. To the N. (PLf) are the captured Libyans
Inarshallml before the king, and an inscription. - The court is
flanked 0n the right and left by severed Colonnades. The ceiling
of that to the right is borne by seven square pillars, against which
stand colossal statues of the king as Osiris, The left (S.) colonnade has eight papyrus-columns with ealyx-eapitals. These last
belonged to the facade ofa royal palace, which formerly stood to
the S. of the temple and communicated with the first court by
three doors and a large balcony-window. To the right and left of this
window the king is seen standing on a bracket formed of hostile
heads and slaying his foes. The scenes on the eoionnadt3-walls represent the wars, victories, and captives of the king. At the ends
the king is seen on his way to the feast of Amen, attended by his
fan-bearers.

The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon are still
more interesting. On the Right Tower (PI. E) is a long inscription
recording the triumph won by the king in the 8th year of his reign
over a league of peoples from the lands of the Mediterranean, who
menaeed Egypt by sea and by land from Syria. On the Left Tower
