notably the head, which is well preserved except for the nose. On
the throne are the names of Ramses IL, beside which Belzoni the
explorer (p.126) has immortalized his own.

The Vestibule, situated on a terrace, was reached by three flights
of steps, of which that to the N. is in excellent preservation. Only
the s, part of the Rear Wall (P1. a) is still standing; on it are three
rows of bas-reliefs. In the bottom row are eleven sons of the king;
in the middle row, to the left, is the king conducted by Atum and
the falcon-headed Mont, who holds the hieroglyph for'life' to the
king's nose; to the right is the king kneeling before the Theban
triad, while Thout, behind him, writes the king's name on a palmbranch; in the top row the king is shown sacrificing to Ptah, to
the left, and offering incense to the ithyphallic Min and a goddess,
to the right.

Beyond this vestibule is the Great Hypostyle Hall, which had
three entrances and, like the great hall at Karnak (p. 268), a have
of three aisles, which was higher than the side-aisles. The nave
has six couples of columns with calyx capitals and six couples with
hud-capitals. The latter were lower than the former, but upon
them rose a wall, with pillars and window-openings, to the height
of the others. Eleven columns of each kind still stand. Each of
the side-aisles had six couples of columns with hud-capitals; six
columns to the left are still erect. Part of the roofs of the have
and the left aisle still remains. 0n the smooth shafts of the columns
appears Ramses IL saeriileing to the gods.

On the N. Half of the E. Wall (PL a) the storming of the Hittite fort.
ress of Dapur is shown in the lower row. To the left is the Pharaoh dashing in his chariot against the enemy, some of whom are slain, while the
rest, horse, foot, and chariots, betake themselves to flight. To the right
is the fortress, defended by the Hittites, while the Egyptians are attack.
ing it on scaling-ladders or push up to the walls under the protection of
storming-sheds and shields. The sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom
are given, distinguish themselves in the battle. - In the upper row are
several representations of the king sacrificing to the gods.

On the W. Wall, in the lower row (P1. b, c), appear the sons of the
Pharaohs in the upper row, above Pl. b, is the king before Anion and
Khan, with the lion-headed Sekhmet behind him, and above Pl, c, the
king followed by a goddess, in presence of Amen and Nut.

The First Small Hypostyle Hall, with four couples of papyrus
bud columns, has a well-preserved roof decorated with astronomical
representations and pictures of the king before the gods.

The RELIEFS on the walls are not uninteresting. On the E. Wall
(Pl. d, e) are priests bearing the sacred boats of Anion, Nut, and Khons,
each decorated with the head of its god. On the N. part of the W. Wall
(PLf) the king is seated beneath the sacred tree of Heliopolis, on the
leaves of which his names are being written by Atum (seated on a throne
to the left), the goddess Seshet, and Thout (to the right).

Of the following Second Small Hypostyle Hall only the N. (ri)
half, with four columns, remains. The sacrificial representations
here are of little interest; at Pl. y the king is shown burning
incense to Ptah and the lion-headed Sekhmet.
