and bounded on either hand byhills. We hold somewhat to the right
and soon reach a road, which finally passes through a rocky ravine
near the Giyftshi eminence, the view from which (p. 116) forms an
admirable close to the day's excursion. Thence to the city, seep.116.

The following SHORTEJI Hur may be recommended. We ride as
described at pp. 117, 118 direct to the Little Petrified Forest and then
return to the Spring of Moses. Hence we ascend to the w. to the plateau
of the Mohegan; and ride across it toward the w. to the Giyiisbi mosque
(p. 116). FrOm the mosque we descend to the citadel.

A visit to the GREAT PETRIFIED FOREST near Bir el-Falun (l hrs.
to the E. of Cairo and 21/2 hrs. beyond the Little Petrified Forest) takes
a whole day, and is fatiguing, especially as the traveller bus the sun in
his face both in going and returning. The route mentioned on p. 117 is
not recommended for the outward journey, as the point for which we
are bound, not being conspicuous, is liable to be missed. It is better to
leave Cairo by the Bab zl-Km'zilet (PLEJ; p. 68), pass the Tombs of the
3lamelukes (p. 115) and the goods-railway to tlelwiin, leaving the village
of El-Basiitin on the right, ascend to the left by the Jewish Cemetery. After
reaching the top of the him we follow the midi et-Pit fp. 118) towards
the E. for 11/.41/2 hr. more. Above the gradual slopes of the desert,
about 1% N, to the left, we then perceive several reddish hills and
another of yellowish colour in front. hiding towards the latter we reach
on its E. slopes the d√©bris of the Bir el-Fahm ('coal well') and remains
of some walls, dating from the period (ISU) ) when an unsuccessful search
for coal was made here. The hills of the desert to the N., N.W., and
W. of the Bir el-Falun form the Great Petrified Forest, and are thickly
strewn with trunks and fragments of fossil timber. These are generally
brown and black, with a polished appearance and frequently contain chalcedony. A sand-hill, 1/2 hr. to the N. of Bir el-Fahm, to the base of
which the petrified forest extends, affords a good survey of the district.
To the N.W. are the Mohatthm. the'Red Mountain','hhb2siyeh, and the
plain of the Nile.

5. New Heliopolis (Heliopolis Oasis).

The most convenient route to the new suburb of Heliopolis Oasis is by
electric express railway or tramway (see p. NO. Carriage, see p. 39. The excursions to Old and New 1Ieliopolis may he combined by taking
(on the return from the former) the electric tramway from the railway
station of Palais de Kouhbeh (p. 120) to Ileliopolis Oasis.

New Heliopolis (hotels, see p. MO, or Heliopolis Oasis, known
also to theArahs ashlayr et-Geduee ('NewCairo'), is a modern suburb
founded by a Belgian company in 1906, in the desert to the N.E.
ofubbtstyeh and near the new English barracks. It occupies a
healthy situation and is intended to become a residential suburb for
British officers and officials and a health-resort for the inhabitants
of Cairo generally. It is laid out on an ambitious scale, with broad,
tree-planted streets and squares, with hotels, pleasure-resorts (Luna
Park, adm. Spins), a racecourse, a stadium, where shows of all
kinds are held, and the grounds of the Sporting Club (p. 4'O.
