The lower series of representations un the N. and N.E. walls are less
interesting. To the left (P1. 1) are the sacred boats of Khons, Nut, and
Amen, to which the king srusviticesy to the right (Pl. 2) priests bear the
boats out of the temple, while the king, behind a fourth boat, approaches
to meet them.

S. AND S.E. GOLONNADES. In the upper rows in these a Festival
of Ptah-Soker is displayed. It begins to the left of the door (Pl. 6)
with a train of priests, bearing sacred boats, images of the gods,
standards, and temple utensils. Behind stand the king and his
dignitaries. We next observe (l'l. 7; S. wall) a colossal symbol of
the god Nefertem, son of Ptah, borne by eighteen priests. The king
(Pl. S) holds a cord, which is being pulled by sixteen courtiers.
Two priests offer incense before the king. Then follow sixteen
priests (PI. l) bearing the boat of Soker, followed by the king.
The king [ P1.10_) sacrifices before the sacred boat; and finally the
hing before the ram-headed Khnum and two other gods, and before
the falcon-headed Soker-0siris, to whom he offers a platter with
bread. - Below are Warlike Iirlirfs. The In Scene { PL fi, on the
SIC. Wall) depicts the king attaching the Libyanswith his charioteers
and shooting with his bow. The infantry fight in wild confusion.
The Egyptians are assisted by the Shardana mercenaries (in the
lower row; p. 3'24). The 2nd Scene shows the return of the king
from the battle. Ile drives in his chariot, with three rows of fettered
Libyans in front of him and two fan-bearers behind him. 3rd Scene.
The king leads the Libyan captives before Amen and Nut. 0n the
S. wall is a relief (Pl. 7) showing the king seated in his chariot
(with his back to the horses) and receiving the Libyan captives
(light-red in hue), who are conducted to him in four rows by his
sons and other notabilities. The hands, ate, cut off from the slain
are being counted. The greater part of this wall is occupied by a
75-liue inscription, recording the conquests of the king.

The rear wall of the w. Common, on the terrace, has three
rows of representations. In the two upper rows Ramses III. is
shown worshipping various deities. In the lowest row (as in the
Ramesseum, p. 308) are royal princes and princesses. The names
beside these were added under Ramses VI.

The following chambers are all very dilapidated, and only the
lower parts of the walls and columns remain.

We first enter the Great Hypostyle Hall. The roof was formerly
supported by 24 columns in four rows of six, of which the eight eentral ones were considerably thicker than the others. On the walls are
representations of the king in presence of various deities. An interesting relief on the S. wall shows the magnificent gold vases presented by Ramses III. to Amon, Mut, and Khons.

Three Smaller Chambers (Pl. G, H, J) follow, two with four couples
of columns, and one with four pillars. In Room 11 are two groups
of red granite, one (left) representing Anion and Moat, the other
(right) the king and the ibis-headed Thout. - The other rooms at
