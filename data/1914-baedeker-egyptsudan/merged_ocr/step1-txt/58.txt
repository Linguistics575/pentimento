Iii Il. GEOGRAPHICAL AND b. Modern Egyptians:

1n the ancient representations women are painted yellow and men
red, merely because the former were paler owing to theirindoor life,
while the men were browned by laboring in the open air [ Virehowl

The dwelling of the fellah is of a miserably poor description,
consisting generally of four low walls formed of crude bricks of
Nile mud, and thatched with a roof of dune straw, on which the
poultry most. In the interior are a few mats, a sheepskin, several
baskets made of matting, a copper kettle, and a few earthenware
pots and wooden dishes. hit the railway-traveller, passing through
the Delta for the first time, must not suppose that the miserable,
ruinous huts that meet his eye are typical of all peasants' dwellings
in Egypt. In Central and Upper Egypt he will obtain a much more
favourable impression. The fact is, that beneath an Egyptian sky,
houses are not of the same paramount importance as in more northern
regions, all that is wanted being shelter for the night. The day is
spent in the open air, on the court in front of the hut, shaded by
acacia trees, among whose branches the pigeons coo. Here the fellah
spends his'keif or leisure, chatting with his neighbours and spinning wool from a spindle that he turns in his hand.

The poorer peasant's mode of life is frugal in the extreme.
llis meals may be summarily characterized as'short, scant, and
bad'. The staple of his food consists ofa peculiar kind of bread
made of sorghum flour in Upper Egypt, or of maize in the Delta,
Wheaten bread being eaten by the wealthier only. This poor kind
of bread often has a greenish colour, owing to an admixture of flour
made from the kernels of Feanum Graecum (see below). Next in
importance in the hill of fare are broad beans (fat). For supper,
however, even the poorest cause a hot repast to be prepared. This
usually consists of a highly salted sauce made of onions and butter,
or in the poorer houses of onions and linseed or sesame oil. Into
this sauce, which in summer acquires a gelatinous consistency hy
the addition of the universal bamyas [ the capsular fruit of the
Hibiscus) and various herbs, each member of the family dips pieces
of bread held in the fingers. Both in town and country, goats',
sheep's, or buffaloes' milk also forms a daily article of food, but
always in a sour condition or half converted into cheese, and in
very moderate quantities only. In the height of summer the consumption of fruit of the cucumber and pumpkin species, which the
land yields in abundance, is enormous In spring large quantities
ot'lettuee, radish-leaves, and similar green vegetables are eaten;
and the lower classes consume, for medical Purposes during January
andFebruary, considerable amounts of Feenum Grseeum, a clover-like
plant with a somewhat disagreeable odour (p.1xxiv). In the month
of Ramadan alone o. xcvi), when a rigorous fast is observed during
the day, and on the three days of the great Bairam festival Ofurbin
Beirim), even the poorest indulge in meat, and it is customary to
distribute that rare luxury to beggars at these seasons.
