1x 11. GEOGRAPHIUAL AND b. Modern Egyptians:

wise the European dress is superseding the oriental, though the
latter is far more picturesque and better suited to the climate. On
the whole, however, they are bigoted Mohammedan, and share
the contempt with which the fellahin regard all other religions.
Their daily intercourse with unbelievers and their dreadi (oCrtlse
power of the Christian nations tend, however, to keep their fanatieisrn, which otherwise would be unbounded, in check, and has even
induced them sometimes to admit strangers to witness the sacred
ceremonies in their mosques.

(ii). NUBIANS. The name Bar√©bm (sing. Berbcri) is applied to
the Nubian inhabitants of the Nile valley between the neighbourhood ofAssuan and the Fourth Cataract. The Egyptians and Nubians
are radically different, and the dislike between the two races is
carried to such all extent that Nubians, even in Egypt, never marry
Egyptian wives. The Nubians are inferior to the Egyptians in
industry and energy, especially in tilling the soil, and in physical
(and perhaps also in intellectual) vigour; and they are more superstitious as is indicated by the numerous amulets they wear round
their necks and arms They are, however, superior to the Egyptians
in cleanliness, honesty, and subordination, and possess a more highly
developed sense of honour. The traveller must not expect to find
them very sincerely attached or grateful, any more than the native
Egyptians, but as servants they are certainly preferable. The Nubian
language belongs to a special group of the African tongues; and
Dr. Brugsch was of opinion that it may afford a clue to the interpretation of the still 1anileeiphered Mero'itic inscriptions of the Nubia 11
part of the Nile valley. It is divided into three dialects: 1. Kentiz,
spoken between the First Cataract and Es-Sebiya; _ Et-OMF,
from Korosko to Hanuek (at the third cataract); 3. Dongola, prevalent in the province of Dougola from Hennek to Gebel Deiga
(near Korti) and resembling the Kentz dialect.

Those Nubians who do not learn Arabic grammatically never speak
it thoroughly well; but itis generally, though imperfectly, understood
in Nubia. The traveller must therefore not expect to learn good Arabic
from his Nubian servants. In their native country the Nubians till
the banks of the Nile, but their land is of very limited extent and
poorly cultivated; and as their harvests are scanty they are rarely able
to support large families. They accordingly often emigrate at an early
age to the richer lands of Egypt, tthiefly to the large towns, in quest of
employment. When the Nubian has succeeded in amassing a moderate fortune, he returns to settle in his native country, of which
throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight. They are
most commonly employed as doorkeepers (bauur0b), as house-servants
(lchadd0mJ, as grooms and runners (sdis), for which their swiftness
rend ers them unrivalled, as coa chmen ('arbdgi), and as eookstiablufklt).
