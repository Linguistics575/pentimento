six Chambers behind (the oldest part of the building). The colonnade is enclosed on the outside by a parapet upon whieh rise square
pillars, which support the roof along with the sixteen-sided columns
in the inner row. The representations show Thutmosis III. sacrifieiug or performing other sacred rites in presence of the gods. In
the inner chambers Thutmosis I. and Thutmosis II. also appear in

pillars on each side of the entrance refer to the restorations by
Haremheb, Sethos L. and l'inotem. The cella, the reliefs in which
were restored at a later period, had a door at each end (restored by
Euergetes IL). The last room on the right still contains a'naos'

the anterior colonnade were added at a later period. That to the N.
was erected with blocks taken from earlier edifices, bearing the
names of Ramses 11., and Aehoris. The small grated
windows and the rings on the upper part of the column-shafts should
be noticed.

We now return to the Second Court, which dates from the Saite
period. The granite gateway to the N. Was built by Peteameniipet,
a noble living at the beginning of the 26th Dyn. (comp. p. 305).
(In the E. the court is bounded by the Second Pylon, which was
erected by Shabako (p. av), the Ethiopian, and restored under
Ptolemy N. Soter 11. On the back of the Pylon appears Taharka
(p. av), grasping a hand of enemies by the hair and smiting them.
- The adjoining Court of Nelt, 2 ft. long and 2 () ft. wide,
was supported on each side by four clustered columns with bud-.
capitals (two restored), connected with each other by stone screens.
On the E. side was a portal. - About 13 ft. to the E. of the last
rises the large First Pylon, which was built in the later Ptolemaic
epoch, largely with blocks taken from earlier tHlifices Crsspecially

On the E. side of the pylon, facing the First Court, which was
130 ft. long and 83 ft. broad, was a Colonnade or Vestibule, which
had columns with rich floral capitals, connected with each other
by high stone screens. Only the two central columns are now left.
In front of one of the screens is placed a door-shaped stele of

pylon. The Gateways in the wall surrounding the court are now
built up; that on the S. (PLgT is adorned with inscriptions by

In the NE. angle of the great girdle-wall, near the small temple, lie;
the Sacred Lake, a basin about 60 ft. square, with two flights of steps. About 45 tn the N.W. of it is a Nilometer. A doorway, bearing the
name of Nektanetms, admits to a chamber beyond which is a corridor,
whence the staircase of the nilometer descends to a depth of 65ft.
