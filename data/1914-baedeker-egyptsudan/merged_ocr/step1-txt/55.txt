the circumstances and results of which we are better acquainted
than with the history of the other foreign immigrations; for, disregarding the Beduin tribes, who are entirely distinct from the
Egyptian population, we now meet with genuine Arabs in the towns
only, where the merchants, pilgrims, and other members of that
people form a class entirely distinct from the natives, and one that
is maintained only by means ofreinforcements from abroad. Another
proof of the transforming influences of the Egyptian climate is
afforded by the uniform character of the domestic animals. The
osen, in particular, though they have often been repeatedly exterminated in a single century by murrain, and have been succeeded
by foreign races from every quarter of the globe, almost invariably
after a few generations assume the well-known Egyptian type with
which the representations on the ancient temples render us so familiar.
There have been many hypotheses as to the origin of the Egyptians. In all probability the rise and development of that people
followed essentially the same course as those of other great races,
whose geographical positions exposed them to a similar variety of
external infhlenees. In the course of its history this people attained
a characteristic development of its own; but we have to inquire as
to the nature of the original prehistoric stock. In classical antiquity
the Egyptians were considered to be of African origin, and Diodorus
has given expression to this view by quoting a tradition of the
Ethiopians, according to which the Egyptians were originally an
Ethiopian colony, just as their country itself is a product of the
Nile. But the Greeks and Romans knew little of Central Africa,
and, more especially, they were acquainted with none of the peoples
of the Nile district except those whom we now distinguish as Hamitie (proto-Semitic). The term Ilamites or Hamitic races is used to
distinguish that great ethnographic group of peoples which has, in
the course of ages, altered the population of half Africa, ever pressing from E. to W. and driving out the primawal population before
them. The final stage of this migration, which, like those of the
horse and camel, falls partly within the historic period, was reached
when the Hamites came in contact with the later Semitic races.
When these liamitic peoples began to find their way from Asia
across the Red Sea into Africa, they no doubt pushed down the
Nile, after subduing the primawal inhabitants of the river-valley.
The Ethiopian tradition thus agrees with the Biblical, which describes 11am as the father of Mizraim and Cush - names under
which the ancient Hebrews used to personify Egypt and Ethiopia.
The civilization and culture of the Egyptians have been sueeessively affected by every race that has played a prominent part
in W. Asia, from the ancient Babylonians to the modern Arabs and
Turks. Maspero argues for a gradual infiltration from Libya also
in the earlier epochs. But the Libyans were themselves Hamitic,
no less than the Ethiopians who overtook them in their advance
