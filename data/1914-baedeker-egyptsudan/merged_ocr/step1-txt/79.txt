Seasons. POLITICAL NOTES. lxxiii

3. AGRICULTURAL SEASONS. In the time of the Pharaohs the
Egyptian agricultural year, which originally began on July 19th,
was divided into three equal parts, each consisting of four months
of 30 days: the period of the inundation, winter, and summer. At
the present day there are, strictly speaking, but two seasons: the
hot season lasting from May to September and a cooler one from
November to March, while October and April are intermediate
months; but the effect which the annual Nile flood has upon the
agriculture of the country rather than upon the climate has caused
the period from July to October to be considered as a third season.

(a) The Winter Cultivation, or'Esh-Shitwi', lasts on the flooded
lands of Upper Egypt from November till April; on perennially
irrigated land the winter-sowing takes place from October onwards,
while the grain-harvest is reaped in April in Middle Egypt and in
May in the Delta. In this season the principal crops are wheat,
barley, beans, and harsim (clover).

(b) The Summer Crops (E.s-feif) may be considered as growing
from May to August in the basin-lands and to October wherever
there is perennial irrigation. The principal crops are rice, which is
sown in March
and picked in September and October. Most of the latter is grown
from seed, but a limited amount is grown from two-year-old plants
which have been cut back. On basin-lands of Upper Egypt where
gufiicient water from wells is available a crop of durra (millet is
grown and harvested before the flood-water arrives.

(c) The Autumn Season ('En- Ntl', or flood) is the shortest,
lasting barely seventy days. On the rich land of the Delta maize is
grown. A large crop of dune is raised on the perennially irrigated
lands of Upper Egypt, and a considerable amount also grown on
those which are not reached by theinnndation. This crop is cut
about November.

The AGRiCULTuxAL IMPLEMENTS of the Egyptians are exceedingly
primitive and defective. The chief of these is the plough (miln'dt). the
form of which is precisely the same as it was 5000 years ago; and the
traveller will recognize it on many of the monuments and in the system
of hieroglyphies. It consists of e pole about (in. long, drawn by an ex,
hnffalo, or other draught-animal, attached to it by means of a yoke,
while to the other end is fastened a piece of wood bent inwards at an
acute angle and shed with a three-pronged piece of iron (man). Connected with the pole is the handle which is held by the fellah. These
rude and light plnughs penetrate .bnt slightly into the ground. The
barrow is replaced in Egypt by a. roller provided with iron spikes t? urnJud, literally'hedgehog'). The only tool used by the natives on their
fields, or in making emhankments of earth, is a kind of hoe or shovel
(migrafeh, (is, tortyebl. The process of reaping consists in cutting the
grain with a sickle (mingal), or simply upruoting it by hand. The nai-ay,
or'threshing-sledge', consists of a kind of sledge resting on a roller
provided with sharp semicircular pieces of iron, and drawn by oxen or
buffaloes. This primitive machine, being driven over the wheat, peas,
or lentils to he thrashed, crushes the stalks and em and sets free the
grain or seeds.
