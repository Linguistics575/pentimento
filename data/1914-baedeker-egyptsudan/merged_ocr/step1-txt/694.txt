right is the king in his chariot, inspecting his offieers, who count
the severed hands of the enemy and bring fettered prisoners.

REAR (W.) WALL. To the right (Pl. m) of the central door is
Ramses 11. leading two rows of captured Hittites before Harakhte,
his own deified figure, and the lion-headed Wert-hekew; to the left
(Pl. n) he leads two rows of negroes before Amen, the defiled
Ramses, and Mut. - Between the two last (so pillars stands a
Stelc (P1. p) dating from the 35th year of the reign of Ramses 11.,
on which is a long inscription recording in florid terms that Ramses
erected large edifices for Ptah of Memphis and presented rich gifts
to him.

Adjoining this large hall are eight CHAMBERS (Pl. F-N), probably used to store the temple utensils and furniture. Round
the walls of these, which are covered with inferior reliefs, run
stone tables.

We now enter a Hall (Pl. c), 36 ft. broad and 25 ft. deep and
supported by four pillars. On the S. wall the king, followed by his
wife Nefret-ere holding two sistra, appears offering incense before
the sacred boat with the shrine of Amen, which is carried by
priests; and on the N. wall is a similar scene before the boat of REHarakhte. Three doors lead from this hall into a long and narrow
Transverse Chamber (Pl. D), and thence three other doors admit to
three apartments, of which the two at the sides are very small. The
central apartment is the Sanctuary (Pl. E), containing a rock-hewn
support for the sacred boat, behind which are seated figures of the
four deities worshipped in the temple - Ptah, Amon-Re, the
deified Ramses, and the falcon-headed RÃ©-Harakhte.

Immediately to the S. of the great temple is a small ROCK TEMPLE,
discovered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia
B. Edwards, the well-known writer (d. 1892), who has described it
in her interesting'Thousand Miles up the Nile'. This is possibly a
Birth House (comp. p. 250). The first chamber, probably built of
brick and vaulted, has disappeared. The second chamber, hewn in
the rock, is the Sanctuary, and is embellished with well-preserved
reliefs.

Entrance Wall. On each side appears the king entering the temple. Left Wall. The king, followed by his guardian-spirit, offers incense to the
sacred boat of Thout. - Rear Wall. To the left, the king presents his own
cartouche to Amon-EE of Napata; to the right, he makes a libation of
wine to RiVHarakhte. - Right Wall. The king accompanied by his guardian-spirit, sacrifices to the boat of Amen Herakhte. The king's prenomen is represented behind by the goddess Man, who is equipped with
special symbols.

A Marble Tablet On the rock in front of this small temple commemorates the battle of Toshkeh (p. 403) in English and Arabic.

From the forecourt of the temple we pass through a stone gateway made by Ramses II. in the brick enclosure and proceed to the
N. by the path along the river-bank, which brings us In a few
minutes to the small
