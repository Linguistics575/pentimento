accordingly restored the ancient canal, the bed of which is said to
have been pointed out to him by a Copt, and used it for the transport of grain from Fustat (p. 44) to Kolzum (Suez), whence it was
exported by the Red Sea to Arabia. The canal again became unserviceable after the 8th century. At a later period the Venetians
frequently thought of constructing a canal through the Isthmus, with
a view to r'ecover the trade which they had lost owing to the discovery
of the route round the Cape of Good Hope. Leibnitz, too, in his proposal regarding an expedition to Egypt, made in 1671 to Louis XIV.,
the greatest monarch of his age, strongly recommends the construction of such a canaL Sultan Mustafa 111., the admirer of Frederick
the Great, Ali Bey, the enterprising Mameluke prince, and Bonao
pane all revived the scheme, and the last on his expedition tEgypt in 1798 (p. css) even caused preliminary works to be undertaken, but the actual execution of the project seemed almost as
distant as ever. LepEre, Bonaparte's chief road engineer. surveyed
the ground, but owing to a serious miscalculation he threw great
doubt on the feasibility of the undertaking. While in reality the
level of the two seas is nearly the same, Lepére estimated that of the
Red Sea to be nearly 33 ft. higher than that of the Mediterranean.

In 1836 Ferdinand de Lesseps (1805-94) came to Cairo as a
young consular dive, and there had his attention called to Lep? rre's
Mémoire regarding the scheme of connecting the two seas, which
led him to consider its great importance in spite of Lep'ere's doubts
as to its feasibility. In 1838 he made the acquaintance of Lieut.
Waghorn (p. 188), whose zealous advocacy of the establishment of
a route between Europe and India via Egypt stimulated his zeal
for a similar project. In 1841 and 1847 Linant-Bey, the vieeroy's
engineer of water-works, and Messrs. Stephenson, Negrelli, and
Bourdaloue demonstrated the inaccuracy of Leptre's calculations.
In ISM M. de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before
Sa'id Pasha, who was then Viceroy and determined to carry it out.
Difficulties were thrown in the way of the enterprise by the British
government during Lord Palmerston?, ministry, but on Jan. 5th,
1850, permission to begin the work was formally granted by the
Viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the necessary capital was raised, and it was not till April 22nd, 1859, that
the work was actually begun. The Viceroy undertook to pay many
of the current expenses and provided 25,000 workmen, who were
to be paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate and
were to be relieved every three months. Until the completion of
the fresh-water canal (p. 180) the supplying of these workmen with
water, which at first had to be transported on camels, cost the
company 8000 fr. per day. Later, however, fewer native hands were
employed, European labourers were engaged, and much of the
work was done by machinery, of 22,000 horse-power in all,
