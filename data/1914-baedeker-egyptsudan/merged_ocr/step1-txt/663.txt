a company which built the railway, to extend the area of cultivation
by boring artesian wells. About 40 such wells have already been
sunk, by which nearly 1000 acres have been reclaimed from the
desert. Cotton is the chief crop in summer, wheat and barley in
winter. Vines, bananas, and vegetables of various kinds are grown
also. But the main wealth of the oasis still consists in its date-palms,
about 40 000 in number.

Visitors who spend only one day in the oasis should visit the Christian
necropolis, the temple of'Hibis, the town of Khiirgeh, and 11111113 permit

IO min. to the S.W. of the station. This temple, built by Darius I
in honour of Amon (comp. pp. cvi, clxvi), was excavated by the
archaeological expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of New York in
1909-11 and has been restored by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities. The axis of the temple runs E. and w., and the building is
approached through four gateways. On the right wing of the second

of the Roman emperor Galba (69 A.D. ]. We enter the temple through
a Colonnade, built by Nektaneb√©s (378-361 11.0.), which is adjoiued
by a Colonnaded Court. Beyond these are a Vestibule (promos) and
the small Hypostyle Hall, borne by eight columns A staircase to the

of the N. portion of the oasis. - On a ridge about 1/2 M. to the N.
of the temple of llibis is the
"Christian Necropolis, in which are several hundred brick tombs.
Most of these are arranged on either side of a broad avenue. The

with pilasters or semi-e0lurnns and contain triangular recesses for
the reception of lamps. Few of the internal decorations are preserved; in one tomb is a representation of Daniel in the den of lions,
