V. IIIEROGLYPIIICS. Cxxxi

Cursive Style, which is usually termed Iliemtic Writing. In this

style the owl m, which in literary hieroglyphics (written from

right to left) bad the form d &, degenerates into }, an

outline scarcely recognizable as that of an owl. In hieratie writing
we possess literary works of almost every kind except dramas. Further abbreviations and arnalgamations of letters. developed another cursive style from the hieratie, vis. the Encharial or Demotic,
which was the ordinary character employed in the Graco-Reman
period. The sign of the owl, for example, was curtailed to D. This
writing was ehieily used for contracts, accounts. letters, and similar
documents, whence it was sometimes termed the Epistolographic,
or'epistolary character', by the Greeks.

During the second century after Christ Egyptian magical formula,
were frequently written in Creek characters; and after the introduction of Christianity it became the universal custom to write the
Egyptian translations of the Scriptures in the simpler Creek letters
instead of in the inconvenient hieroglyphiess, which were at the
same time more Jitliorlt to learn. But as the Greek alphabet was
not adequate to represent all the Egyptian sounds (e, g. sh, f, Ich, ete.1
seven supplementary symbols' were borrowed from the demotic.
Thus arose the Coptic Writing of the Egyptian Christians.

The use of hieroglyphics extended beyond the borders of Egypt,
especially into Nubia, where they were employed in the temples
built by the Pharaohs. And even after the Nubian-Ethiopian
kingdom beeame independent of Egypt in the b'th cent. BA).,
hieroglyphics still continued to be used there. At first, however,
only inscriptions in the Egyptian language were thus written; some
time elapsed before hieroglyphies were adapted to the native language, which was allied to the modern Nubian tongue. In the
course of this adaptation various formal modifications took place,
resulting in a Mero'itic Hieroglyphic System, which has not as yet
been fully deeiphered. In the post-Christian era a Merditie Cursive
Style also, probably based on the demotie, was developed (camp.
p. 386). This also has only partly been deciphered.

The following hints will be of service to those who may try to
decipher any of the kings' names with the aid of the foregoing
lists, consulting first the list of phonetic symbols, then that of
the verbal signs. The Egyptian kings frequently had several
names, the two most important of which, vis. the oiCfieial name
and the individual name, are enclosed within the carton che. The

iofiicial name is preceded by the title ta n-she bity,'king of
