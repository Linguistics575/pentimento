of Acirirs. PHILIE.. Pg. Route. o O

The RAILWAY (station, see p. 353) runs through the desert in
a wide curve round the N. and S. granite quarries (p. 356) and ends
at the station of Shellél (see below).

The DESERT ROUTE leads from the railway station past the
English church (p. 355) to the height with the Arab sheikh's grave
(p. 360) and then descends into the valley. Beyond the grove of
tamarisks (p. 356) we reach the old road described by Strabo, who
assigns it a length of 50 stadia. At the little British cemetery our
route is joined on the left by a railway constructed for the transport
of building-material for the dam. Beside the road lie large blocks
of granite, with ancient inscriptions carved by Egyptian officials,
now numbered with white numbers. About 1/2 M. beyond the cemetery is a ravine (telegraph-line) diverging towards the village of
El-Mahatta (see below). We, however, follow the railway and skirt
the remains of an ancient Brick Wall, which was probably erected
as early as the Middle Empire to protect the Nile traffie against the
predatory attacks of the E. desert-trihes. The wall is (Wert. thick
and, at places, 13-20 it. high, and consists of two faces of bricks
filled up with blocks of granite. It leads as far as Shetl01 Lsee below).

The RIVERSIDE ROUTE leads from the Cataract Hotel via Fort
Tagug on the hill o. 360) to the village of El-Mahatta, opposite
the island of Seheit.

The island of Seheil (men), reached from Assutn by boat, was
dedicated to Anukis, and contains over 200 rock inscriptions, besides the
ruins of two temples. One of the temples, near the village of Seheil on
the w. side of the island, dates from the 18th Dyn., the other (to the S.),
from the reign of Ptolemy IV. Philopator. High up on the SE. rocks of
the island is an important inscription of the Ptolemaic period, recording
that in the reign of the primeval King loser (p. 146) the Nile failed to
me during a period of seven years and that a famine arose in the land
in consequence.

The view of the stream with its 1u1mer0t1s darlsseoloarcil granite
rocks, covered with a smooth glaze, like enamel, is very fine, although the foaming rapids of the Great Cataract are now things of
the past. - From El-Ma1.lat.t.a the route leads through the dirty
village of Kortrr, wedged in among the granite rocks. It then passes
the hamlet of El-Khazctn, which has recently sprung up here, with
the tasteful white bungalows and pleasant gardens of the officials.
It then again turns to the E., passing a cemetery for Christian work-.
men, and joins the desert-route (see above) at the tomb of a sheikh,
near the ancient brick wall.

A shorter route, diverging from the desert-route beyond the
British cemetery, leads direct (in about 1/2 hr.) to El-lihazau and
the dam (p. 371). Thence to Shellél, see above.

The village of Shellal (Challal), where both the railway and the
desert-route end, lies on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Phila .-Good boats lie ready for the ferry (5 pias. there and back; tickets
at the hotels).
