1V. MODERN HISTORY.

Nisih, near Birejik, to the W. of the Euphrates, and on the
death of the sultan (ist July, 1839) Ahmed Pasha, the
Turkish high admiral, and the entire Turkish fleet declared
for Mohammed. The armed intervention of England and
Austria, however, obliged Mohammed to yield to the Ports
a second time. ly the so-ealled firman of investiture of'
1841 the sultan assured the hereditary sovereignty of
Egypt to the family of Mohammed Ali, according to the
Turkish law of succession (seniorate), and granted to the
pasha the right of concluding non-political treaties and
of appointing all Egyptian officials and of'fleers up to the
rank of colonel. In return the pasha was required to pay
to the Porte an annual tribute of 80,000 purses (318,930L).
During the last years of his life Mohammed fell into a
state of imbecility. He died on Aug. 2nd, 1849, in his
palace at Shuhra.

Ibrahim had already taken the reins of government, in Mn-.

sequence of Mohammed's incapacity, in Jan., 1848, but
he died in November of the same year, before his adoptive father.

'Abbkg L, a son of Tustin (p. cxxi), had all the dislike ofa true
son of the desert for European innovations. He, however,
maintained the strictest discipline among his off1eialiy.

Sa'id, his successor, was Mohammed Ali's fourth son. He
equalized the incidence of taxation, abolished monopolies,
completed the railways from Cairo to Alexandria and to
Suez, and, above all, zealously supported the scheme for
the Suez Canal. During the Crimean war he was obliged
to send an auxiliary army and considerable sums of
money to the aid of the Porte. He died in 1863 and was
succeeded by
Iame'il, the second son of Ibrahim Pasha o. 1830j. lsm√©'il
had received the greater part of his education in France
and had there acquired the strong preference for European
institutions which characterized him throughout his reign.
Most of his innovations, however, such as the foundation
of manufactories and the construction of canals, railways,
bridges, and telegraphs, were planned mainly in his own
interest, though of course the country shared in the advantage, while even in the establishmentof schools, the reorganisation of the system of justice (p.39, and the like,
he acted rather with an eye to produce an impression in
Europe than from real concern for the needs of his subjects.
As time went on he succeeded in appropriating for his own
use about one-fifth ofthe cultivableland ofEgypt. In 1866,
in consideration of a large sum of money, he obtained the
sanction of the Porte to a new order of succession based
