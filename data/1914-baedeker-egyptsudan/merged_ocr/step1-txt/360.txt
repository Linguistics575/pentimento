mostly covered up again; the locked chambers are opened by the
keeper of Ahueir. We first enter a large hall (only partly exeavated), with twenty square pillars. Thence a. door opens into another
hall, with three recesses containing statues; on the walls are reliefs
of goldsmiths and of workmen carving statues of the deceased in
wood and stone. A third hall, in which the lower parts of two lotuscolumns with bud-capitals, are still in 11111 (comp. p. 83), contains

remains of fine wall-reliefs.
