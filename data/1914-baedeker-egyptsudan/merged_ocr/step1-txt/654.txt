route at regular intervals and are of the utmost importance as
guide-posts showing the math The mahattas or halting-places are
6-9 M. apart and serve also as measures of distance. Here and there
we observe some of the semaphore-towe" of an optical telegraph
dating from the time of Mohammed Ali. The Kegeir caravans
usually pass the second night in the village of Lake a (El-Ghetu;
9 hrs.fron1 Bir'Amhar 121/ghrs.fron1 Keneh), which is chiefly inhabited by'Abdbdeh (p. 356). The small oasis has two wells, some
palms, a few mud-huts, and a half-ruinedArah caravanserai. Near the
chief well are some fragments of a Creek inscription containing the
name of Tiberius Claudius. The manners and customs of the primitive
desert-tribes in this region well repay observation; the way in which
the children wear their hair is especially notable.

About 21/21115. to the E. ofLa.keit.a we quit the plain and enter a
wtdi, flanked by abrupt terraces belonging to the upper cretaceous
formation and containing petrified oyster-shells. In 3/4 hr. more we
reach the Kay el-Bandi, or'Castle of the Maidens', a picturesque
rock of sandstone formed by atmospheric erosion and covered with
numerous graffiti in Greek, Coptic, Arabic, Himyar'1t'w, and Sinaitic
characters, engraved here by caravans. Adjacent lies a Roman watering-station (Hydreuma), forming an oblong 125 ft. in length and
102 ft. in breadth. The enclosing wall, formed of courses of sandstone
without cement, was 61/2 ft. high. Within the wall lie 20 small
chambers opening on a rectangular inner court, the only exit from
which is on the N. side. No water is now procurable here.

At a distance of about 2hrs. from Hydreuma the rocks close in
and form a winding pass named Mut.rali, es-Selftm. On the Gebel Abu
"('father of the elbow'), at the entrance to the pass, are more
graffiti, older than those at Kagr el-Bawit; in one of them Amenophis IV. is mentioned. Beyond the pass we approach the tine
mountain scenery through which the second part of the Kogeir route
leads. In the distance, to the right, rise the S. foothills of the Eamvutrru" it Mts., while nearer and in front are the S.W. spurs. These
mountains rise in terraces to the height of 4200 ft. and outvie in
impressive scenery the rocks of Assutn. The outliers of the range
consist of a yellow sandstone, belonging to the cretaceous formation, followed by the red'Nubian' sandstone, also of the cretaceous system.

Among these hills, to the N. of the caravan-route, lies a second
Roman station, with a filled-inwell. About2hrs. farther on the sandstone disappears and we reach the older (palaeozoic) formations of the
Wrnmirntt Mountains proper. The character of the scenery suddenly
changes; the hard, dark rocks riseperpendicularly and the mountains
assume an abrupt, Alpine appearance. Here begins the Whdi

hard dark stone for statues and iyoffins in the most ancient times.
