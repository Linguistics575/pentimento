built on a bridge over the Bahr Yitsuf (p. 190), has an ancient portal,
with bronze-mounted doors. The interior has been restored. At
the W. and of the town the Baht Yi1suf radiates through sluices
into numerous branches..

To the N. of the town, and intersected by the railway to Abuksa
(see below), are the rubbish-mounds known as Ktmtm Féris, or
riders hills', covering an area of 560 acres and rising to the height
of 65 ft. These mark the site of Crocodilopolis -Avsinoii, the most
extensive remains of any old Egyptian town.

The ancient Egyptian name of this town was Slum. It was the centre
of the worship of the erocodile-headed water-god Sobek (the Greek Such"),
under whose protection the entire lake-land stood. The crocodile was
sacred to Sobek, and the Greeks therefore named the city WocodutrpoO
or'erocodi1rtowu'. It never attained to any political importance. Ptolemy I1. Philadelphus seems to have converted it into an essentially
Hellenic city by adding new quarters, founding Greek temples and educational institutions, and introducing the Greek language. This monarch
also raised Queen Arsinoii to the dignity of patron-goddess, and the district
became known as the'Arsinoiye Nome' and the capital as the'City of
the dwellers in the Arsinoite Nome', or, more hriefly, as Arsinoé'. At the
time of its greatest prosperity it had over 100,000 inhabitants.

In the midst of the ruins rises a mound of rubbish known as
Kém Ftris (65 ft. high). The top commands .1 wide survey of the
modern town, the ruins of the ancient city, and the whole Ihriyrhn,
with the pyramids ofmahiln and 1.Tawira to the S.E. The rubbishheaps have recently been much diminished by briek-burners and
diggers for sabakh (p.1xxi). .-... During the last quarter of the 19th
nent. important discoveries of papyri were made here, especially in
the mound known as Ktrm el-frharydna. Most of these papyri are
now in the late Archduke Rainer's collection in Vienna, while others
are in the museums of London, Berlin, and other towns. They are
ehiefly Greek business-documents (records, receipts, letters, ete.),
but some literary specimens also have been found, containing fragments from Homer, Euripides, Thucydides, etc.

The best-preserved section of the ruins is that to the N., which
in Prof. Sehweinfurth's words,'to this day produces the impression
of a city but recently destroyed. The walls of the houses still stand
far and wide, but the narrow interlacing lanes, bewildering in their
ramifications and interrupted by countless trenches and holes in
the ground, render it impossible to obtain any clear idea of the
general plan'. On the extreme N. edge of the ruins, near the farm
of rEzbet Tarkhtt Effendi, are a few blocks of limestone marking
the site of the principal ancient temple, which was dedicated to
Sehek. This existed as early as the 12th Dyn. and was afterwards
rebuilt by Ramses II. Beside the temple lay originally the sacred
pond in which the crocodile of Sobek was kept.
