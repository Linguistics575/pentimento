valley of the Euphrates, otherwise it would not have been able to
introduce into Egypt, as it did, the knowledge of wheat and barley
and the art of cultivating them with the plough, the knowledge of
copper, bronze, and various metallurgical processes, and perhaps
also a religious system of, its own and even the art of writing. The
net result of the whole historical process was Egyptian civilization
as it existed under the Pharaohs. f

THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. The population otEgypt is composed
of the following ten different elements.

CI), the'tillers' or'peasants', with whom must be reckoned the Coptic peasants of Upper
Egypt, form the hulk of the population and may be regarded as the
sinews of the national strength.: l'hey are generally slightly above
the middle height; their bones, and particularly their skulls, are,
strong and massive; and their wrists and ankles are powerful and
somewhat clumsy. [ n'nll these respects the fellahin, like their 110mestin animals, contrast strongiywith the inhabitants of the desert.
Notwithstanding this largeness of frame, however, the l'eilah never
grows fat. The women and girls are particularly remarkable for
their slender build. The men generally keep their heads shaved,
but the hair of the soldiers and the long tresses of the girls, though
always black and thick, is smooth and wavy, seldom curly. The hair
on the faces of the men is scantier and more curly.

The chief peculiarity of the Egyptians is the remarkable closeness of their eyelashes on both lids, forming a dense, double, black
fringe, which gives so animated an expression to their almondshaped eyes. The very ancient and still existing custom ofhlackeuing the edges of the eyelids with antimony f'koN'), which is said
to serve a sanitary purpose, contributes to enhance this natural
expression. The eyebrows are always straight and smooth, never
bushy. The mouth is wide and thiek-lipperl, and very different
from that of the Beduin or inhabitant ofthe oases. The high cheekbones, the receding forehead, the lowness of the bridge of the nose,
which is always distinctly separated from the forehead, and the
flatness of the nose itself, are the chief characteristics of the
Egyptian skull; but, as the jaws project less than those of most
ol' the other African coloured races, it has been assumed that the
skull is Asiatic and not African in shape. The Egyptian peasantry
have a much darker complexion than their compatriots in the towns,
and their colour deepens as we proceed southwards, from the pale
brown of the inhabitant of the Delta to the dark bronze hue of the
Upper Egyptians. There is, however, a difference between the tint
of the Nubians and that of the Upper Egyptians, even where they
live in close contiguity, the former being more of a reddish-brown.

, Prof. G. Elliot Smith's study of the earliest remains has, however, led
him to essentially different views on the origin of the Proto-Egyptians.
