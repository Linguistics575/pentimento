Street Scenes.

CAIRO. J. Route. M)

Several times during the day and also at night the solemn and
souorous cry of the muezzin, summoning the faithful to prayer (see

p. lxxxvii), reverberates
from the tops ofthe minarets
(madna). When the shops
are shut the watchmen
(bauwdb) place their beds
(serif) of palm-twigs in the
streets outside the entrances
and prepare to spend the
night th ere; sometimes they
have only mats or rugs to
sleep on. The street-traffle
ceases in the Arab quarters
comparatively early, while
in the European districts it
goes on till nearly midnight. But during the
month of Ramadan it continues throughout the
whole night even in the
Arab quarters; the story


tellers (p. xxvi) in the cafes then have many listeners, while
shadow-plays (p. xxvii) and bread throes attract others.

The traveller will observe the Schools (kuUCth),
of which there are 193 in
Cairo, with 363 teachers
and 11,925 scholars, and
one of which is attached to
almost every public fountain (sehil; p. clxxxii). He
will tind it very amusing
to watch the Ikt, or schoolmaster, teaching his pupils with the aid of admonitions and blows, while
the boys themselves recite
verses of the Koran with a
swaying motion of their
bodies (a practice supposed
to'strengthen the memory')
or bend over their wooden
or metal writing tablets.
They do not fail, however,
to find time for the same
tricks as European school
