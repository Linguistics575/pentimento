and characteristic nose of Ramses II. are best preserved in the "ht
colossus on the S. (Pl. a). The second colossus has unfortunately
been deprived of its head and shoulders, which now lie on the ground
before it. The upper part of the third colossus was patched up under
Sethos If., who added the support under the right arm.

Upon his head the king wears the double crown; hishamis rest upon
his knees; and from his neck hangs a ring bearing the praenomen of
Ramses H., which is curved also upon the upper arms and between the legs.
To the right and left of each colossus and between their legs are smaller
tigures of other members of the royal family. To the left of the tirst
colossus (Pi. a) is Princess Neht-tewe, to the right, Hent-Anat, between the
legs an unidentified princess. To the left of the second colossus (Pl. b)
is Tue, the mother of Ramses 11., to the right is his wife Nefret-ere, and
between his legs, Prince Amen-her-khOpshef. On each of the thrones of

Upon the two S. colossi are a number of
Greek, Carian, and Phenician inscriptions, of
considerablephiiological
and historical interest.
These were carved by
mercenaries, who had
penetrated thus far in the
course of military expeditions. The most remarkable is a Greek inscription on the left leg
of the injured colossus
(Pl. b), written by Greek
mercenaries sent by
Psammetiuhos H. from
Elephantine to Nubia.
They had advanced to
the second cataract and
wrote this inscription
on their way back. The
