clxxx VIII. BUILDINGS OF THE MOIIAMMEDANS.

Under the SECOND CIRCASSIAN MAMELrKE DYNASTY (1382- 1517)
the mosque-Nader attained its zenith, and from this period date the
most elegant achievements of Arabic architecture in Egypt. The
facades assumed a more homogeneous character; the minarets, of
enhanced elegance ever since the days of Kalann, reached their
highest development; the domes, now also built of stone (see below),
were richly adorned with sculpture; and the walls, ceilings, pavements, and even domestic furniture were sumptuously embellished
with mosaics, panels, carvings, and stalactites. The first dome built
of stone was that of the mosque of Barlnilc (p. 112).

The use of written characters has played a prominent part in
the decoration of Arabic buildings at all times, and the art did not
deteriorate in the latest period. Under the Tulunii1es the closely
written C1ufie character was employed, while under the Fatimites,
and still more under the Aiyuhides, the letters became taller and
more slender. The letters themselves and the spaces between them
were embellished with arabesque, ornamentation. Under the Aiyuhides the cursive eharavter known as Nuskhi was used also; and the
friezes of intertwined letters dating from the period of the Mamelukes frequently rise to the dignity of works of art.

We "may now proceed to an examination of the special kinds of
buildings, beginning with the RELIGIOUS EDIFICES.

Mosques are of two kinds, the Gami', lit. an assembly for
prayer, and Mesgid, the place where the knee is bent for prayer.
The oldest mosques are very simple in plan (comp. the plan of the
mosque of lhn'l'nl6n, p. 72). Around a quadrilateral court (SaZm),
corresponding to the atrium of a Byzantine basilica, lie four flatroofetl colonuatles fthMsrs), used for prayers. The Chief Litctsn or
Sanctuary, placed on the side next Mecca, has usually four 01 tive
aisles, the others never more than two. The CRUCIFORM MOSQUE,
a new form invented in Persia, was introduced into Egypt about the
end of the 12th rent. by the Aiynbide Saladin. This was developed
from the previous simple form by the construction of additional
chambers at the four corners of the liwans, in such a way that the
llwans, now covered with massive waggon-vaults, formed the four
arms of a cross. Comp. the plan of the Sultan Hasan mosque (p. 67).
These liwans were used as school-rooms, whence arose the name
Medreseh, or'school-mosque'. - Towards the close of the Mameluke
supremacy still another form arose, used, however, only for small
mosques. The side-liwtns were shortened and the central court so
contracted that it could be roofed over and lighted from the top.
The four arms of the cross were covered with flat wooden roofs, like
the colonnades in the original form of mosque, while the Watt..N0n-vaulting was represented merely by a transverse rib on the side next
the court (comp. the plan of the mosque of Ka'it Bey, p .114).

With the conquest of Egypt by the Turks under Selim I. (1517),
the Turkish-Byzantine style of architecture also made its appearance
