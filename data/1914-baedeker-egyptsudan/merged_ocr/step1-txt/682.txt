reliefs on the outside and numerous inscriptions, chiefly Greek,
though some, added by visitors to the temple, are demotic and
Meroi'tie. Within the central gateway, on the left side, is a TPpresentation of the king making offerings to Them, Tefnut, and
Ilathor, and (below) to Isis.

The ASCENT or THE PILON is attractive. In each tower there is a stairI'ase, beginning in a guard-room at the foot and passing three other rooms
in the successive stories. On the platform at the top of the W. tower are
numerous inscriptions written by visitors and also carved representations
of footprints, indicating the spots where the worshippers stood. The roof
of the central portal may be reached from the w. tower.

No trace now remains of the court between the pylon and the
vestibule. The fagade of theVEsrmumeV or Pronaos, has two columns
with floral capitals, connected with the side-walls by means of
screens. On the walls are representations of the king before the gods
of Dakkeh. On the E. wall the Pharaoh proffers to the god Thout
a palette, which is borne by Isis and Nephthys and is, perhaps,
symbolical of Osiris. ileliefs of an Ethiopian king occur on the
rear wall (at the top, to the left). The pronaos was at a later date
used as a church, and the whole of the walls and the ceiling were
painted over with sacred subjects, traces of which are still visible.
- The doorway in the rear wall was originally the main entrance
to the earlier temple. On the jambs are a number of reliefs: to the
left, Philopator before Re, Khnum, and Isis; to the right, Philopator before Amou-RÃ©, Harendotes, and Isis. Within the portal an
emperor offers the figure of Meat to the god Thout of I'nubs and to
the lion-headed Tefnut.

We next enter the TRANSVERSB CHAMBER (restored). A staircase,
on the right, led hence to the roof of the temple in the imperial
period; at the top is a crypt in the thickness of the wall. - The
following CHAMBER was built by Ergamenes. Of its reliefs only one
is interesting (on the right wall): Ergamenes making a libation of
wine to a god described as'Pharaoh of Senmet' (Biggeh) and to the
goddess Anuket. - l small door (of later construction) in the E.
wall admits to Two CHAMBERS. On the back-wall of the second
are two lions sitting face to face; above them is a baboon (Thout)
worshipping the goddess Tefnut (in the form of a lioness); higher
up are two ibises.

The SANCTUARY, containing the granite shrine, is embellished
with reliefs by an unidentified emperor, who appears in them before various deities. An interesting relief represents the Nile gods
approaching the sacred fig-tree, beneath which sits Thout in the form
of a baboon. In the rear wall are a door (of later construction) and
two windows (surmounted by the winged sun-disk). On the outside of this wall was a large door-shaped recess, containing a relief
of Thout of Pnubs.

On the E. bank, nearly opposite Dakkeh, lies the commune ot
Athryit'Aaayi). A little to the N. of the stealiihoat station is the
