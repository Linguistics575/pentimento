The construction of the railway to Kharttm was undertaken in
1896-97 in order to support the advance of the Anglo-Egyptian army;
and in spite of the enormous difficulty of laying a railway line across
the sandy and stony surface of the desert, the work was so energetically carried on that it advanced almost a mile daily. As in the construction of the Suez Canal (p. 183) the one essential point was
the provision of an adequate supply of water for the workmen and
the machinery. A series of watering-stations (I-VI) wis accordingly
established, at which wells, sunk to a depth of 80 ft,, tap the subterranean water, which is found to flow from the S. -On the E. rises
the bare, violet-coloured chain of hills, beyond which lies (121 M.)
BET Murat and behind which runs the caravan-route from Korosko
to Abu Hamel! (comp. p. 399). The stony desert gradually gives
place to undulating sand-hills. As the train approaches Abu named
the dark-coloured ranges of hills, which border the left bank of the
Nile, become visible in the distance. Isolated dtom-palms, fields of
barley, conical sayal-acaeias, and finally a grove of palms announce
the proximity of the river.

232 M. Abu 1.Tamsd (baths at the railway station). From the
station we have a glimpse of the poor village, which takes its name
from a sheikh buried in the neighbourhood. The important position
at the hand of the river, which here turns abruptly to the S.W., was
captured from the dervishes in Aug., 1897, by General Hunter,
who had advanced from Dongola.

evades the difficult navigation of the Fourth Cataract and provides connection with the rich province of Dongola. - On the right bank, above
the cataract, lies Kirbekan, where General Earle fell in 1885.

About 21/2 M. below Kareima and 2 M. from the right bank of the Nile
rises the Gehel Barkal, the'sacred mountain' of ancient inscriptions. This
isolated rocky hill rises abruptly from the plain to a height of 302 ft. At
its base extend the ruins of the ancient Ethiopian city of Napata. Under
the New Empire Napalm was the southernmost town under Egyptian rule
and the chief iifrit of the trade with the Sims". It attained the zenith of
its prosperity in the 9th cent. B.C. when it became the capital of an independent Ethiopian kingdom (p.38é). Taharka and his successors (w)
resided here and built sumptuous temples for Amon-RE and other deities.
