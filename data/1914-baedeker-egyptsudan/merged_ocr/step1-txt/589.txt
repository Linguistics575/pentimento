to this day among these tribes). The procession is closed by ahrown and
a black Ethiopian woman, with pendent breasts. The latter carries a
child on her back, and each woman leads a boy behind her. In the second
and third rows are Nnbians bringing gold, panther-skins, a giraffe, and
oxen. Between the horns of the last, which are represented as arms, are
heads of supplicatiug negroes. More to the left are five rows of ships (the
lower rows much damaged). Five Ethiopian princes kneel upon the deck
of the second heat. Cattle and other goods are being brought to Egypt in
the smaller vessels below. - On the other side (Pl. e) appears the king,
seated near the comer pine before him stands Huye presenting the Syrian
tribute, which includes artistic gold vases. Amcnhotep brings pieces of
lapis lazuli on a dish; by his right hand hangs a breastplate, set with
precious stones. The other representations are almost entirely obliterated
- The sepulchral inscription, which should have occupied the RIGHT END
WALL (PI, o, was never executed. On each side of the vacant space are
offerings to lluye. The rest is destroyed.

The Tombs of the Queens, called by the Arabs ntbda zl-Ijanm

or Bibi" el-Bamil, and sometimes Btbtwt et-Hagpi Hammad, also
deserve a visit from those travellers who can afford the time (lights
should be taken).

On the way from Deir el-Mediueh to the [ 1,4 hr.) Tombs of the
Queens we pass a number of inscribed steles, formerly in niches.
The first of these shows Ramses Ill. before Amen and Ptah. On the
next Merit-seger, goddess of the West, offers the same monarch her
breast; behind is the sun-god Harakhte; to the right is Amon, investing the king with the siekle-shaped sword. The inscription refers
to the campaigns of the king. We then ascend through a mountain
valley with bare and lofty sides of limestone, pirturesqnely formed
and carved with inscriptions to the gods of the regions orthe dead.-Tile road from Medinet Habu (p. 322) to the (1/2 hr.) Tombs of the
Queens unites with that above described just before reaching the
tombs.

Both routes end in an enelosed Valley, which is of great beauty,
though not so imposing as that of Bibin el-Muliik (p. 284). From
the farther end of the valley, in particular, a splendid view is enjoyed ot' the Theban plain and the Uolossi of Memnon.

_ The tombs belong mainly to the 19th and 20th Dynasties. Altogether upwards of 70 have been discovered, most of which were
I excavated in 1903-4 by the Italian arehasologieal mission under
E. Schiaparelli. Many of them are unfinished and entirely without
decoration, and in their rough and blackened condition, resemble
mere caves in the rocks. It is rare to find either inscriptions or representations carved in the stone; even in the tines! tombs the limestone walls were more often covered with plaster, svhirh could be
adorned with paintings without much difficulty. The more important tombs are designated by tablets with Italian inscriptions,
and the best-preserved ones, which alone are hh orth visiting, must be
opened by the keeper.

commemorating the Italian excavations. The grave: we first, reach
