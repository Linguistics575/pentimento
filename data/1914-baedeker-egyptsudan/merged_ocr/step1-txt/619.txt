the towers served to admit light and air to the chambers and stairrases within (see p. 347).

A passage leads through each pylou-tower to the outside of the girdlewall, which is embellished with colossal reliefs (Ptolemy XI. before the
gods of Earn) and bears the inscriptions mentioned at p. MI. In front
of the pylon stand two colossal falcons in dark granite. One has the
figure of a priest in Roman costume before it.

The Court, between the pylon and the vestibule, is a spacious
enclosure, paved with broad flags and surrounded on three sides
by a covered colonnade of 32 columns. In this court rose the
great altar upon which offerings were made to the gods of Edfu
in presence of the assembled people. The columns supporting the
roof of the colonnade are embellished with rich floral and palm
capitals. The incised reliefs on the shafts show the king before
Horus and the other gods of ham; the name of the king has not
been inserted in the inscriptions. On the rear walls of the colonnades are three rows oflarge reliefs, showing the Pharaoh (Ptolemy
Soter II. or Ptolemy Alexander) in communion with the gods or
triumphing over his foes, as the earthly representative of Horus.
The same representations occur over and over again in wearisome
repetition throughout the temple.

On the S. wall (P1. a), to the left of the entrance: l, The king, wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, quits his palace in order to visit the
temple; a priest offers incense in front of him. 2. Horns and Thout pour
the water of consecration upon the king. - These scenes are repeated to
the right of the entrance tPl. h), where, however, the king wears the
crown of Upper Egypt.

The doors to the right and left of a and b load to the staircases
in the interior of the pylon (ascent, see p. 347). The E. and W.
exits (Pl. c) are built up.

The back of this court is formed by the front of the vestibule,
which is crowned by a concave cornice. On each side of the
large portal are three stone screens between the columns. Upon
these, facing the court, are reliefs representing Euergetes 11. with
pendent arms or offering sacrifice to Hathor of Dendera (on the two
central screens) or to the falcon-headed Horus of Edfn (on the
others). To the left of the entrance stands a colossal falcon with
the double crown; the corresponding falcon on the right lies on
the ground.

The Vestibule, or Pronaos, has 12 columns with elaborate floral
capitals. The ceiling is covered with astronomical representations,
now blackened almost beyond recognition. On the walls are four
rows of incised reliefs, showing Euergetes saerifleing to the gods
and performing other religious rites, such as the ceremonies at
the foundation of the temple, etc. Above are a row of astronomical
representations and a frieze consisting of the names of the king
guarded by two falcons. Close to the pavement we see Euergetes aml
his wife Cleopatra and a long procession of local deities bringing
savaifuyial gifts to the three chief gods of Edfu. - To the right and
