d. Geology. POLITICAL NOTES. lxix

The f1uvio-rnarimy deposits of Moghara (to the W. of the Widi
Natn'm) and the si1ieifled wood of the same district also belong to
these miocene times, as do also the marine limestones of the plateau
of Cyrenaica, to the N. of the Siwah Oasis and on the E. edge of the
Arabian Desert (at the foot of Gebel Geneifeh and Gebel'Atil.rO,
and on the shore of the Gulf of Suez near 62138 ] Zeit.

The'Petrified Forest' near Cairo consists of scattered fragments
of the silieified stems of trees; and these, together with the red
sandstone of Gebel eI-Ahmar and conical hills of the same material
in the N. parts of the Arabian and Libyan deserts, are connected
with the siliceous thermal springs which bubbled forth amid the
network of lagoons which existed in these parts in Oligocene times.
To the N.W. of the Birket liariin, in the Faiytun, these fossil trees are
even more numerous, while in the sands of Oligocene age innumerable bones of former terrestrial and marine mammals and reptiles
have been found, which were carried down by the river and buried
in its estuarine deposits. A tine collection of these fossil animals may
be seen in the Geological Museum at Cairo.

The cliffs of the Nile valley above Cairo consist of middle and
lower Eocene limestone, containing numerous nummulites (p. 110)
and other fossils. The strata are gently inclined to the N.N.W., so
that the strata increase in age as we go towards the S.

To the S. of Edfu begins the upper cretaceous formation, here represented by the sandstone which at Gebel Silsileh forms steep walls
of rock and coutiues the river in a narrow channel. This'Nubian
Sandstone' covers an area of many thousand square miles, extending
from the oases to the Siidin. At certain points, such as Assu√©n,
Kahibsheh, Whdi Halfa, and the third and fourth cataracts, ridges
of crystalline rocks (granite, gneiss, diorite, etc.) rise through it,
and form black or reddish hills in sharp contrast to the low tabular
masses of the sandstone.

2. In the ARABLAN or EASTERN DESERT (pp. 362, 372 er seq.) a
line of hills, some peaks of which are 7000 it. in height, runs parallel
to the Red Sea and at short distance from it. This is wholly formed
of crystalline rocks (granite, gneiss, diorite, hornblende-schist, micas: :hist, talc-schist and the andesites and allied rocks which form a
great series of very ancient volcanic rocks, the imperial porphyry of
Gebel Dukhin being a well-known representative). The E. and W.
slopes of this range are overlaid by sedimentary rocks, usually the
Nubian sandstone, but also (in the N. part) by limestones and mails.
These strctrh away toward the W., forming a great plateau of limestone in the N. and of sandstone in the S., in which the Nile Valley
forms a narrow trough. Numerous deeply eroded valleys give a characteristic appearance to the Eastern Desert. The open plains are
almost bare of vegetation, but numerous plants may be seen in the
valleys, especially after rain, while in the sheltered ravines among
the hill: where springs occur they grow luxuriantly.
