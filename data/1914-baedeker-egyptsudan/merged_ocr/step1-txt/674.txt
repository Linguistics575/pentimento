388 Route 27. TAFEII. From Shclldl

with with floral capitals, connected by stone screens, little now remains. The reliefs on the facade show Augustus or Tiberius in presence of various deities. The side-walls of the First Hall are decorated
with reliefs in two rows, exhibiting Ezelrher-Amun sacrificing to
various deities. Over the door is a votive inscription of the same
monarch. Thence we proceed through an Antechamber (without decoration) to the Sanctuary, which contains aTranite Naos, dating
from Euergetes II. and Cleopatra (p. cix). The adjoining chambers
contain nothing of interest.

At Dimri (W. bank) is an ancient wall; and on the E. bank
farther on is the fragment of a quay-wall, with a staircase. The
island of Morgos (Markos), next passed, has some picturesque ruins
of houses, apparently of medimval origin.

171/2 M. Dehmit (Dehmiet), on both banks, is a steamboat station.
- 25 ll. Ambarkah, with considerable hamlets on both banks.

To the right (W. bank) next appears the small temple of
Kertassi (Ginny), an attractive building on a rocky plateau, recalling the'kiosque' at Phila, (p. 370). It is only 25 ft. square.
Columns, connected by stone screens, once supported the roof, of
which only a single cross-beam now remains. Two Hathor-columns
(at the entrance, which faces N.) and four other columns with elaborate tlower-capitals (two on each side) are now standing.

To the S. is an embankment constructed to protect the valley
from inundation, and farther on are extensive'Sandstone Quarries,
which yielded the stone for the temples at Philae. They contain
numerous Greek votive inscriptions (and one demotic) dating from
the Roman imperial epoch (Antoninus, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Gordian } These are addressed to Isis and
to the Nubian deities Sruptichis and Pursepmunis. Two busts in
high relief and an empty niche, with an Egyptian doorway, also
deserve notice. .--- At the end of the quarries (3/4 M. from the
temple) is a Roman Fort (perhaps the ancient Tzitzi), with a
girdle-wall of large hewn stones, the inner core of which has disappeared, leaving only the outer shell. The gateway on the N. side
shows the Egyptian concave cornice. On the W. side we may trace
the ancient ditch.

Farther on the river-valley narrows and lofty cliffs approach
close to the stream.

Tafeh (Teifeh, Teifa; W. bank), the ancient Taphis. On the river
bank are the remains of a narrow quay, on the S. side of which is a
small nilometer. The little Temple, of the Roman period, was left
unfinished and has no mural reliefs. The entrance faces the S. The
facade is supported by two columns with elaborate floral capitals.
In the interior of the temple are four standing columns, with floral
capitals. - To the N. are the remains of some large structures,
perhaps the relics of a fortified camp. - To the S. of the village
