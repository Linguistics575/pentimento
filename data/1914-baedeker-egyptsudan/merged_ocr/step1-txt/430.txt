1. Railway Journey to f.Tawhra and mahtin. The railway,
following the same course as the highroad, leads at first along
the bank of the Bahr Yasuf, with the pyramid of Haw'ara to the
left, to the village of J.Nlitsfeh (Rohafa). Farther on it traverses
cultivated fields, with the heights of Gebel Sediment to the right,
and reaches the station of Hawdra, beside the village of Hawaret
el-Malcja', with its pretty mosque (route hence to the pyramid, see
below). To the left is a large cemetery, with the graves of sheikhs.
- The railway now again approaches the Baht Yt1snf. The remains
of old embankments which we see from the train date from the
period of the Caliphs. - Stat. Balm Seileh (Siala). We then cross
the Bahr Seileh el- chid, which diverges from the Baht 1Tssuf. The
pyramid of 1llahtln becomes visible on the left. The train approaches the margin of the desert. - The station of Bash-IMO
is the starting-point for the pyramid of Illaldr1 (p. 195). - The
train then traverses fertile land to 11laUn or Et-Lawn (Egypt.
Le-hrme, i.e.'mouth of the canal', see p. 190), a village with 3785
inhab., situated on the right bank of the Tinhr Ytssuf. Close to the
railway station is the sluice-bridge f'pont régulateur') through
which the Baht Ytlsuf enters the Faiytun. Beyond the bridge is the
village of f.fatvdret'Edlcin or'Eglan, a picturesque place situated
on the water. About 2M. to the S.W. of Illahtn, close to the edge
of the desert, is the ruined town of Medinet Guréb, discovered by
Professor Flinders Petrie. It owed its origin to Thutmosis m., who
built a temple here.

2. The Pyramid of IEawua, the tomb of Amenemhét 111., is
reached from the village of Hawaret el-Mafcja' (see above) in about
3/4 hr. The route leads to the N., through fields, to the desert
plateau on which the pyramid stands. We then cross a bridge over
the Balm Seileh el-Gedid, which intersects the plateau. The pyramid
consists of crude bricks, and, when its sides were perfect, covered an
area about 115yds. square. The limestone incrustation, however, had
disappeared even in the Roman period. The nucleus of the structure is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in height. The dilapidated
summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a well-worn path.
The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side (now impassable),
was discovered in 1889 by Prof. Flinders Petrie. An intricate
series of passages in the interior leads to the tomb-ehamber in which
Amenemhet III. and his daughter Ptah-nofru were interred.

On the S. the pyramid was adjoined by the large mortuary temple
of Amenemhgt. This edifice, however, which served as a quarry for
centuries after the Roman period, has completely vanished, with
the exception of an extensive space strewn with small splinters of
stone and fragments of fine granite and limestone columns. Traces
