746 ft., but was formerly (Pl. BB) about 756 ft.; the present perpendicular height (P1. E C) is 450 ft, while originally (Pl. E m,
including the nucleus of rock (Pl. CE), which has now disappeared, it is said to have been 481 ft.
The height of each sloping side (P1. A C) is now 568 ft. and was formerly (Pl. B E) (Hon. The angle at which the sides rise is 51" 50'.
The cubic content of the masonry, deducting the foundation of rock
in the interior, as well as the hollow chambers, was formerly no less
than 3,277,000 cubic yards and it still amounts to 3,057,000 cubic
yards. In round numbers, the stupendous structure covers an area
of nearly thirteen acres. The material of which it is constructed
is yellowish limestone quarried in the vicinity and containing
numerous fossils, chiefly nummulites (p. 116). The outer covering
was formed of blocks of a finer white limestone, which was obtained
from the quarries at ana o. 170) and other parts of the Mohattam.

Construction of the Great Pyramid. According to Borehardth, theory
this pyramid was not built on a single homogeneous plan (p. 126). It
was originally designed to contain only one sloping corridor hewn in the
rocky ground (a r) and leading through an anteehamher (l) to the tombcbamher (t). But before this design was completely carried out it was
exchanged for a more comprehensive plan, involving the construction of
another chamber, now called the queen's Chamber (g), reached by the corridor marked eef. Bat even this was not flntrl, for Kheops undertook
another and greater extension, resulting in the construction of the Great
Hall (h) and the King's Chamber (k).

The ASCENT of the Pyramid, though fatiguing, is perfectly safe.
The traveller selects two of the importunate Beduins (p. 124) and
proceeds to the N.E. corner of the pyramid where the ascent usually
begins. Assisted by the two Beduins, one holding each hand, and,
if desired, by a third (no extra payment) who pushes behind, the
traveller begins the ascent of the steps, which are each about 3 ft.
high. The strong and active attendants assist the traveller to mount
by pushing, pulling, and supporting him, and will scarcely allow
him a moment's rest until the top is reached. As, however, the unwanted exertion is fatiguing, the traveller should insist on resting
as often as he feels inclined. d Uskut walla mt fish baltshtsh' (be quiet,
or you shall have no fee) is a sentence which may often be employed with advantage. All requests for bakshish should be refused,
and it is as well to keep an eye upon one's pockets. - The ascent
may be made in 10-15 min. but, in hot weather especially, the
traveller is recommended to take nearly double that time, in order
to avoid the discomfort of arriving breathless and heated at the
summit. The space at the top at present is about 12 yds. square,
so that there is abundant room for a large party of visitors.

The "Irrrrw is remarkably interesting and striking. There is
perhaps no other prospect in the world in which life and death,
fertility and desolation, are seen in so close juxtaposition and in
such marked contrast. To the W., s., and N.W. extend yellowish
brown tracts of sand, interspersed with barren cliffs. The huge
