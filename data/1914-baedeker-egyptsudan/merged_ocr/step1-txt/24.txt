(no hot viands). At other stations refreshments are brought to the
carriage-windows (bargaining necessary; 2 oranges 1/2 pias.). The
water offered for sale should be abstained from. In most of the
express-trains there are dining-ears (B. 10, lunch 20, D.25 pias.).

Narrow Gauge Railways. The Egyptian Light Railways cover
the Delta and the Faiyiim (p. 190) with a network of lines, which,
though of little importance to the ordinary tourist, enable the business man, the explorer, and the specialist to reach various remote
points with comparative ease.

The Cabs (sing.'arab? yeh) in the large towns are generally very
good. The offleial tariffs are exhibited in the vehicles and are advertised in the'Indieateur des Chemins de Fer' (see p. xvii). At
Alexandria and Cairo there are also Taximeter Cuba and Tarimeter
Motor Pubs. The latter are not adapted for drives outside the city
except on good roads. The cab-drivers (comp. pp. xxiv, 39) are
unable to read the names of the streets, while many of them know
the various points only by names of their own. The hotel-portier
should therefore be employed as interpreter. The traveller should
keep his eye on the direction taken by the cab, as sometimes the
cabman drives straight ahead in complete ignorance of the way and
requires to be guided, e.g. by being touched with a stick on the right
or left arm according to the turning, or with the words yerntnak (to
the right), thimtlak (to the left), dughri (straight on). The cabs
usually drive rapidly, so that their use saves time and strength.

Donkeys (sing. hom√©r) are found everywhere. The better ones
belong to a finer race than the European breed. In Alexandria and
Cairo they are, however, not used by Europeans for riding within
the town. In the towns the donkeys are generally well bridled and
saddled; side-saddles are not always obtainable, and when they are
an extra charge of 5 pias. is sometimes made for them. The proelivities of the donkey-boys for prodding the animals with pointed
sticks and urging them to gallop should be sternly repressed. When
a slower pace is desired the rider shouts'ala mahluk 0r'ala mahlakum; if a quicker pace is wanted, yallah, yallah, or m1.el-.horrufr; if a halt is to be made,'andak, hush, or the English word
'stop' (camp. p. xxiv).

co Hotels.

In Cairo and its environs and at Inner and Assutm (corny. pp. xxi,
xxii) there are hotels quite of the first class, though perhaps not
equal to the most modern establishments in Europe and America.
There are good hotels also at Alexandria, Port 82%, and a few other
places. They are managed according to international methods; the
waiters and chamber-maids are chiefly German 01' Swiss, while the
'boots' are generally Nubians (Baribra) who in most cases understand one or several European languages. As on the American
system a fixed sum daily is paid for lodging and board, the latter
