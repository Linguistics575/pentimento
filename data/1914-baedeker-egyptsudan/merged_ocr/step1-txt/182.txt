clxxvi VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART.

developed the use of a correct profile representation. This is sometimes met as early as the 5th Dyn. but was not handled with perfeet certainty until the second half of the 18th Dynasty. At this
time the Egyptian art of drawing had attained its zenith. Nothing
of equal excellence is found of a later date. The traveller will find
the best opportunity to study the works of this period at Sheikh
'Abd'sl-liar" and Tell el-'Amarna (pp. 309, 212). - The animals, upon the realistic reproduction of which the artists bestowed great care and devotion, are shown in an almost correct profile position .--- Mention may be made also of another rule of
Egyptian composition which originated in the effort to represent
each object in the clearest and most complete manner. Thus per Â»
sons, animals, ete., supposed to be behind others are depicted in
rows above them, and objects intended to be lying upon tables are
depicted standing above the tables. At the same time the principle
that objects lying behind other objects are concealed was recognized
even at an earlyperiod. The principal personages in a representation
are indicated by the primitive device of delineating them on a much
larger scale than the other figures.

The art of drawing in Egypt was hampered from time immemorial by a number of designs that were copied again and again, though
some alterations were gradually introduced. In the course of centuries the ancient treasury of types was increased by the addition
of new and valuable motives. Thus, e.g., the Ancient Empire
furnishes numerous scenes from the life of the people on the large
landed estates, which are often marked by a charming naivete and
a delicate observation of nature. In the 5th Dyn. pictures of military import join the circle of representations used in the mortuary
temples, while under the Middle Empire we find scenes of the life
at the courts of the provincial princes, andvarious new burial scenes.
The supply of material, however, dates its greatest increase from
the period of the 18th Dyn., when Egypt became a world power
through its political relations with Asia Minor, and when the horizon
ofthe artists had consequently become much more extensive. Under
Amenophis IV. even the intimate life of the royal family and the
court, which no one had previously ventured to represent, was, for a
time, drawn into the field of art. Under the 19th Dyn. and under
Ramses Ill. new tasks were imposed upon the artists, who were called
upon to represent the warlike deeds of the king, and to execute huge
pictures of battles. The beginning of this new tendency may indeed
be recognized in the 18th Dyn., as in the reliefs on the chariot of
Thutmosis IV. in the Museum at Cairo (No. 2080, p. 90). With the
end of the New Empire the supply of types again shrinks and beeOmes inferior even to that of the Ancient Empire. In scenes of the
kind here referred to the artist found a free field for his powers of
invention. When, however, he had to reproduce ceremonial scenes,
he had naturally to adhere more or less rigidly to the ancient models.
