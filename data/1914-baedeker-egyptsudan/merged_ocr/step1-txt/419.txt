p. 181) no less than 45,000 cubic yds. of limestone, coloured red
and brown with iron, had to be removed in the course of the excavation of the canal. This stone contained teeth and vertebrae
of sharks, bivalve shells, and remains of Bryozoa. In the layer 01
sand above the limestone were found crocodiles' teeth and the remains of hippopotami and other large quadrupeds. The monument
of Darius near Fash-Shaljfeh is mentioned at p. 182.

We finally reach the Gulf of Suez, which is here so shallow that,
but for the canal, it might be crossed on foot at low tide. It contains several islands. On the w. bank rise the workshops and
magazines of the Canal Company. Passengers are landed in steamlaunches.
