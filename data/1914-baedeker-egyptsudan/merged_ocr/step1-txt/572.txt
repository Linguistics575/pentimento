middle is the entrance to the sanctuary. - In the left corner opens
the small Room B, in the right corner the so-called Hall of Amen,
both of which may be omitted by hurried visitors.

ROOM H. The ceiling is well preserved. On the right wall appears
Amon-Ré in front of a table of offerings, which replaces the eifheed figure
of Hatshepsut. Behind the table is the queen s guardian- spirit. On the
rear wall are Thutmosis Ill. end Thutmosis L (substituted for the queen)
making an offering of clothes to Amen. On the left wall Thutmosis ll.
(substituted for the queen), with his guardian-spirit, offers sacred oil to
the ithyphallic Amen.

HALL OF Anon. Part of the ceiling, decorated with stars on a blue
ground, still remains. Un the 1eftsidirwa11 we observe Hatshepsut pacing
out the temple-precincts, before Amen, before these same gods. On the end-wall is Thutmosis 11. (originally Hatshepsut) before Amen. The figures of the gods here were defaced by
Amenophis IV. and were not replaced at the restoration under Ramses II.

A granite Portal, reached by a porch dating from the 18th Dyn.,
with balustrades, forms the entrance to the SANCTUARY. The three
chambers (PI. E, F, G) are unfortunately much damaged. The first
two have vaulted ceilings and are adjoined by recesses. The scenes
in the let Chamber (PL E) show Hatshepsut (sometimes Thutmosis 111.) sacrificing to various deities, among whom figures the
deceased Thutmosis II. The 3rd Room was added under Euergetes 11.
and was dedicated to the saints Imhotep and Amenhotep, who were
revered in the Ptolemaic period. The reliefs and inscriptions of this
late period compare very unfavourably with the masterly sculptures
of Hatshepsut.

On the upper part of the right wall of the let Chamber is a noteworthy
scene: Hatshepsut, Thutmosis IH., and the princess Ra-nofru saerifiee to
the boat of Amen, behind which stood Thutmosis I. with his consort
Ahmes, and their little daughter Bit-nofru. A similar scene was repre
sented above the recess (PL a) on the left wall; the kneeling Thutmosis m.
and Princess Ramofru may still be distinguished.

Immediately to the S., adjoining the temple of Hatshepsut, lies
a smaller temple dating from the beginning of the Middle Empire.
This is the Mortuary Temple of Kings Mentuhotep III. and w,
(Neb-liepet-ré and Neh-khru-riij, begun by Mentuhotep 111., who
erected over his subterranean tomb (see p. 305) a terrace with coionuades and a pyramid, as well as tombs and chapels for the women
of his harem. The structure was extended and completed by his
successor Mentuhotep 1V., who also chose to have his tomb here.
This is the earliest Thehan temple known to us and it is of great
interest from the simplicity of its architecture. It was excavated by
the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1905-7. - Like the large temple
it is constructed in terraces. From the COURT, bounded on the W.
side by two COLONNADES with rectangular pillars (with the cartouche
of Neb-khru-ré), an inclined plane leads to a higher TERRACE, on
which stood the actual mortuary temple with the pyramid. Beyond
a vestibule which has almost completely disappeared, but which
formerly extended to the N. and s., lies the New CHAMBER, a large
hall with 140 octagonal pillars. In the middle of the hall rose a
