speeted. It consists of remarkably hard and Irnu-grauted limestone,
and before it was injured was about i'?. ft. in height, corresponding
to the measurement given by Herodotus (30 eubits of 11/3 ft. each).
The workmanship is excellent. The handsome and gentle features
of the king are admirably reproduced. A conventional beard is
attached to the chin. 1n the girdle is a dagger with two falcon's
heads. 01 ] the right shoulder, the breast, and the girdle appear the
praenomina of Ramses II. This eolossus is to be removed to the
Plate Ramses in Cairo (comp. p. 78). - In front of the hut are
several fragments of monuments, showing the name of Ramses 11.

Two routes lead from the colossi to the Neeropolis of Salilrtra.
One, turning to the N" passes the ruins of. the old Temple of Ptah,
situated below the village of Mit Rahineh and close by a cemetery
containing the picturesque tomb of a sheikh. Thence we ride through
the lanes of Mit Rahineh, beyond which we make for the Step Pyramid due w. (p. 146).

The other route, more usually followed. leads to the W. from the
colossi of Ramses, leaving the village of Mit Rahineh to the right.
011 quitting the palm-grove we obtain an attractive view; immediately to the right, shaded by palm-trees and lebbakhs, is a small
villa. About 11,5231. to the W. is another long palm-grove surrounding Salrlrlra and bordering the desert; beyond this, on the yellow
sand of the desert, rise eleven pyramids. The first of these, to the
left, is the S. brick pyramid, beyond which are the blunted pyramid,
the N. brick pyramid, and the great pyramid, all belonging to the
group of Dahshtlr (p. 16 (3). Not far from these we next perceive the
Masit.abat el-Farah, with the pyramid of Phiops IL; then, exactly
above the houses of Salilsira, two pyramids, the lesser of which is
that of Phiops I.; and, lastly, to the right, the pyramid of Onnos,
the great step-pyramid, and two smaller ones (to the right, that of
Teti). These last seven pyramids belong to the group of Sahh√©ra We ride along the embankment to the W. and then to the N., skirting a canal (Barr et-Libeinii, to the lock-bridge, where we join
the direct route (see below). We continue to follow the embankment across the plain towards the W. and arrive (20 min. from
the loek-bridge) at the R & el-Gisr ('head of the ombankmentr).

FROM anmsnmx TO THE Nsenoroms or SA Rh DIRECT. From the fork mentioned on p. Li3 we ride to the N, following the
telegraph-poles, traversing the entire palm-grove and passing among
the brick ruins of ancient Memphis. We then follow the embankment to the abowe-meutioned loek-bridge.

The united routes ascend to the plateau and bring us in sight

about 41/3 M. from N. to s., and I/r-tN. from E, to W. It contains
sepulehral monuments of almost every period of Egyptian history.
