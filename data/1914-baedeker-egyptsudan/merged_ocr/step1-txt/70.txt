c. The Nile.
By Captain H. a. Lyons.

From the sources of the Nyava'rongo, a tributary of the Kagera
River, to the sea the Kagera-Nile is the second longest continuous
waterway in the world (4037 M.), being surpassed only by the
Mississippi-Missouri, which is probably about 100 M. longer. From
the Ripon Falls at Lake Victoria to the sea the distance is 3473 M.,
so that the Nile proper is the longest single river in the world, the
Yang-tse-kia" probably coming next.

Rising to the N.E. of Lake Tanganyika, the waters of the Nyavarongo-Kagera flow into the great Victoria Lake, on the N. shore
of which, at the Ripon Falls, begins the true Nile. After a course
of 242 M. this enters the Albert Lake. From this point, under the
name of the Balm el-Gebel, it traverses a rocky channel as far as
Gondokoro, and it then flows for 470 M. through the swamps which
till the valley and provide the reeds and grasses of the'sudd', or mass
of vegetation which from time to time blocks the channel (p. 435).
In latitude 9Â° 30' N, the main stream receives two tributaries, the
Ruhr el-Ghatiil and the Bahr ess-Zartifeh, and a little farther on it is
joined by the important Sobat River, to which the annual flood of
the White Nile is due. From this point to Iihartiim the Bahr elAbyad or'White Nile', as it is here called, flows through a shallow
valley of considerable width, until it is joined by the Balir el-Asra.k,
i.e. the'blue','dark', or'turbid' Nile, so called in contradistinotion to the White Nile, the'oleac' water of which has been filtered
in its passage through the marshes of the Bohr el-Gebel or has deposited its silt in the upper reaches ofthe Sobat. Between Khartyim
and the Mediterranean, a distance of 1900 M., the Nile receives no
further addition to its supply except from the river Aibara, while
it is being continually diminished by evaporation, by percolation into
the sandstone of the desert through which it flows, and by the irrigation of its flood-plains in Egypt. - Between Wadi Halfa and
Assuin the average breadth of the Nile is about 550 yds., to the N.
of Assuan it varies from 550 to 980 yds.

As practically no rain falls within its limits, Egypt would cease.
to exist as a fertile country and would become a desert valley,
similar to those of the Sahara, were it not for its constant supply of
water from the Nile. Thus the all-important annual INUNDATION of
that river merits special notice as the great event of theEgyptian yeari

The heavy rains which fall from June to September on the Abyssinian tableland cause the Blue Nile and the Atbara to rise rapidly,
and their waters carry down in suspension vast quantities of the
mud which has during many centuries formed the fertile valley and
delta of Egypt, but of which very little is deposited now, however,
owing to the perennial irrigation (comp. p.13xi). The volume of
the Blue Nile flood, whit, h may reach and even exceed 360, 000 cubic
