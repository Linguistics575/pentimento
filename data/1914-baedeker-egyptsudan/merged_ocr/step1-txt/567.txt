5. From Bihan el-Muh'ik to Deir el-Bahri and El-Asasif.

To return from Bihiin e1-Mu1t11c to the plain we should take the mountain-path vit Deir el-Bahri. It is possible to ride to the top of the hill,
but walking all the way is preferable. - Another very pleasant route leads
from Bibtui e1-Nult1k up the steep hill and then, above Sheikh rAhd ellSurna, descends to Deir eHledineh (p. 316). - The morning or late afternoon is the best time to visit the temple of Deir el-Bahri, for during the
hotter hours of the day the oppressive rays of the sun are reflected from
he rocks he re with peculiar intensity.

The path begins at Tomb 16, ascends the hill separating Bibin
el-5luliik from Deir el-Balm" and El-Asasif, and descends in zigzags.
It is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in 3/4 hr. The
* View is most remarkable: first we look into the desolate valley of
the Tombs of the Kings; then, from the summit and as we descend,
we see the peculiarly shaped ravine of Deir el-Bahri, the steep
l projecting mountain-side with its tombs and buildings old and new,
, and the rich green of the fertile plain below, spread out on both

sides of the Nile, with its groups of palms and gigantic temples,
as far as Karnak and Luxor on the E. bank. The situation of the
temple of Deir el-Barri is remarkably tine; on the W. and N. it is
framed by precipitous rocks of a light-brown and golden colour,
against which the dazzling white walls of the temple stand out in
magnificent relief. - Below the temple lies a rest-house open only
to Cook's tourists and to patrons of the hotels of the Upper Egypt
Hotel Company (p. 251).

The great Temple of Deir el-Bahri was built and adorned with
reliefs and inscriptions by Queen Hatshepsut, the sister, wife, and
co-regent of Thutmosis III. Like the sanctuary of the 11th Dynasty
(p. 304) lying to the S. of it, it is constructed in terraces. The construction of the temple shared the chequered fortunes of its foundress (p. cii). When Ilatshepsut was expelled from the throne by
her brother and husband, after a brief reign, the building operations
came to a halt, and Thutmosis caused the names and tignre of his
sister to be obliterated in all the finished sculptures and inscriptions
at Deir el-Balm' as well as elsewhere throughout the country.
Thutmosis 11 who succeeded his brother, continued the work of
destruction by inserting his own name in place of that of liatshepsut.
When Thutmosis II. died, however, Hatshepsut regained the throne
and the building was resumed. Operations were not carried on
with any remarkable activity, for when the queen's long reign came
to an end the temple was still unfinished. Thutmosis 111., once
more on the throne, so far from supplying what was still wanting,
resumed his former tactics, destroying all allusions to his sister
and sometimes inserting his own name and figure in place of hers.
Amenophis IV. (p. 211) carefully destroyed all reference to Amen,
and the inscriptions and reliefs were left thus mutilated until the
reign of Ramses 11., who restored them, though with inferior workmanship. For centuries afterwards the temple remained unaltered;
but under Euergetes IL a few slight restorations were undertaken
