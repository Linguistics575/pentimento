before Anion, Khous, and Mut. - On the right and left walls
of the Sanctuary Sethos appears offering incense before the boat
of Amon.

We now turn to the RIGHT DIvrsrox of the temple, which is in a
very ruinous condition. It consisted of the large Court of the Altar
(Hall of Ramses II.) and of several rooms adjoining it. The sunk
reliefs of Ramses 11. sacrificing to various gods are inferior to those
of the central building and left-hand portion of the sanctuary.

We come out to the colonnade through Door c, and enter through
Door a to visit the LEFT DIVISION of the temple. In the small Chapel
of Ramses I. (borne by two papyrus-bud columns) are high reliefs,
which were probably'usurped' by Ramses ll.'. to the right the king
kneeling before Amon, Khous, and the deified Sethos, while behind him is Mat. - Adjoining are three Chambers (Pl. A, B, o.
On the side-walls of the central chamber (P1. A) Sethos I. offers
incense to the boat of Amon and anoints his father Ramses I.
with his finger. On the rear wall is a double door-shaped stele to
Ramses I., with a representation of the Osiris-coffin of the king, on
which Isis is seated in the form of a falcon. The two other rooms
(Pl. B and C) were built by Ramses 11. and contain rather rude
reliefs (the king before the gods). - A side-door (Pl. l) leads from
the chapel of Ramses I. to a narrow Corridor, the left wall of which
is now represented only by the lowest courses of masonry. Thence
we enter (to the right) Room D, with sunk reliefs dating from Ram-.
ses 11., showing that king and his father Sethos saerifieing before
various deities and performing other sacred rites. - A small Door
(P1. m) leads out of the corridor back into the colonnade.

To the N., among the spurs of the Libyan mountains, lies the Necropolis of Drab AbuU Negga, one of the oldest cemeteries of Thebes. The
treasures discovered here by JrarieueN Excavations were of extraordinary
value (comp. p. ES). Tombs of the 11th, 13th, and 17th Dynasties were
found, but they have all been destroyed. The Rock Tombs 0n the hillslope of Drah Aba'l Negga, dating from the time of the New Empire,
are comparatively uninteresting (opened by the keeper; small fee). Those
most worthy of inspection are: No. 11. Tomb of Thuti, a prince and president of the treasury, with long inscriptions; from this tomb a long passage in the rock leads to the next one (No. 12), on the left side-wall of
which funeral scenes are depicted. No.18 Tomb of Shurai, adorned with
beautiful funeral scenes. No. IT. Tomb of' Neb-Amun, chief physician and
secretary of Amenophis 111.; on the right half of the back-wall of the
vestibule are interesting representations of Asiatics; the beautiful ceilingornamentation also should be noticed. No. 19. Tomb of Amenmose, the highpriest of King Amenophis L; on the end-wall to the left are seen the
funeral procession and the burial ceremonies; on the right side of the
back-wall the sacred boat, containing the image of the deithed king Amenophis L, is being carried out of the temple of which the deceased was
high-priest. Similar scenes are depicted on the other walls. NIL 20. Tomb
ofMentu-her-khopshef, royal fan-bearer, with representations of the funeral.
No. 24. Tomb of A'eb-Amun, president of the royal chancery in the time of
Thntmosis m., with tasteful stucco reliefs (funeral scenes, fields of the
blessed, banquet). No. Tomb of Amenemopet, a high-priest in the time
of Ramses Il., with colossal statues and good reliefs representing the
deceased and his relatives.
