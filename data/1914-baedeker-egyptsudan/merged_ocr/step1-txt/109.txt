IV. ANGIEN I' HISTORY. uiii

aux. DYNASTY (1315-1200 13.0.).

Ramses I. (Ramessc) had a short reign. His tomb is at Bibin elMulilk (p. 291).

Sethos I.) fought against the Libyaus, the Syrians, and the
llittites (Kheta), a powerful people that under the 18thDyn. had
penetrated from Asia Minor into N. Syria and threatened the
Egyptian possessions in Syria and Palestine. Sethos built large
temples at Karnak, liurna, and Abydos. His tomb is at Bibin
el-Multik (p. 292), his mummy at Cairo (p. 96).

Ramses II. (Ramesse, ca. 1292-1925 11.0.), the most celebrated of
all Egyptian kings. He waged tedious wars against the Hittites
(battle of Kadesh, p. 307), finally making a peace with them in
the 21st year of his reign (p. 272), which left Palestine proper
in the possession of the Egyptians, while N. Syria was acknowledged to be tributary to the Hittites. Ramses developed an
extraordinary building activity in the course of his reign of
67 years. Perhaps one-half of all the extant temples date from
this reign; and the name of Ramses is found in nearly every
group of ruins in Egypt. His largest temples were those of Abu
Simbel (p. 404), KarnakCp.265l, Luxor (p.257), the Ramesseum
(p. 306), Abydos (p. 243), Memphis (p. lid), and Bnhastis
(p. 171). His tomb is at Bibim el-Multlk (p. 987), his mummy
at Cairo (p. 96). Ramses IL is frequentlyidentitied, but probably
erroneously, with the'Pharaoh of the Oppression' (Exod. i. 11).
Of his numerous sons only one survived him, viz.
Amenephthes (Merenptah), who carried on campaigns against the
Libyans and their allies (comp. p. 86). the peoples of the Mediterranean. Ilis mortuary temple is at Thebes (p. 309), his grave
at Bibin el-Urol; (p. 287), and his mummy at Cairo (pf 96).

Amen-meses are all buried at Bibi" el-Mah" (pp. 289, 298,

Siptah l 291). Their short reigns were followed by a period

Sethos II. of anarchy. Decline of the kingdom.

tcr. DYNASTY (i200-1080 B.CO.

Seth-nakht succeeded in restoring peace.

Ramses IO. (Ramesse, 1900-1179 13.0.) conquered the Libyans and
in two great battles repelled an invasion of barbarians who approached from Asia Minor by land and by water, threatening
Egypt. Bis reign of 21 years was thereafter an epoch of peace
and quiet, in which several large buildings (e.g. the temple at
Medinet Babu, p. 323) were erected. The king presented great
gifts to the gods, especially to the Theban Amon, who had
been richly endowed by former kings, also. The high-priest of
Amen gradually became the greatest power in the state. The
king's tomb is at Bibin el-Mult1kO. 28N, his mummy at Cairo
(p. W). His successors
