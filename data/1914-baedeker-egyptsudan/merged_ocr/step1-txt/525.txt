Temple ofAmon. THEBES (E. BANK). 20. Rank 265

The great "Temple of Amen was not built on any single uniform plan, but owes its present form to the building activity of
many successive rulers of Egypt. From the Middle Empire to the
Ptolemaic period most of the Pharaohs took some share in adding
to or adorning this shrine, rivalling each other in the magnitude of
their designs. The foundation of the temple must be dated not
later than the first monarchs of the 12th Dynasty. Amenophis I.
built a second sanctuary alongside the main temple of the Middle
Empire, but this was again removed at an early period (p. 278).
When Thutmosis I. made Thebes the capital of the New Empire
the original modest shrine seemed no longer worthy of the dignity
of the god, and the king therefore built round the temple of the
Middle Empire a large court which was bounded on the W. by a
pylon (tio.V), and was surrounded inside by colonuades with statues
of Osiris, At a later date he erected in front of this another pylon
(No. IV) with an enclosing wall, placed two obelisks in front of this,
and constructed a colonnade between the two pylons. In the reign
of Hatshepsut alterations and additions were made in the interior.
In front of the temple of the Middle Empire, in the court of Thutmosis 1., she constructed a special sanctuary, and in the colonnade between pylons IV and y she erected two obelisks, besides practically
rebuilding the eolonnade itself. Her brother Thutmosis III. continued
these alterations when he became sole monarch. He tore down most
of the colonnades in the court of Thutmosis I. and replaced them
with a series of small chapels. A new pylon (No. VI) was erected,
and the court between this and the building of Hatshepsut, which
had been embellished with a vestibule, was adorned with colonnades. The colonnade of Thutmosis I., between pylons 1V and Y,
was subjected to a thoroughgoing alteration, the main object of which
Was to withdraw the obelisks of Hatshepsut from the gaze of visitors
of the temple. Two new obelisks were raised in front of those of
Thutmosis I. About twenty years later the king continued his alterations of the temple by erecting the two Halls of Records and the
antechambers between pylons V and VI. To the reign of Thut-.
mosis III. is due also the Great Festal Temple (the so-called Tromemoir') which lies to the E., i.e. behind the main temple. Amenophis Ill. erected a new pylon (No. 111) on the main from of the
temple. All these buildings of the 18th Dynasty were thrown into
the shade by the erections under the Nth Dynasty. Ramses I.
raised still another pylon (No. H), and Sethus I. and Ramses 11.
created between this Mth pylon and the pylon of Amenophis Ill.
that gigantic Hypostyle Hall which has remained ever since as
one of the chief wonders of Egyptian architecture. Ramses If.
caused also a second girdle-wall to be built, outside the wall of
Thutmosis m. The temple now seemed to have received its final
form. The temples of Sethos H. and Ramses III. were separate
buildings, erected in front of the facade of the great sanctuary. But
