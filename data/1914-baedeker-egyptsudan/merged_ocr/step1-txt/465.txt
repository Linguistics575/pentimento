along an embankment leading through fields. In the, vicinity is the
vats' graveyard, in which the cats sacred to kahet, patron-goddess
of this region, were interred. Farther to the S.E. we reach a midi
er ravine, from the month of which an old cemetery of the 22nd25thDyn. stretches toward the plain. In the valley are several
quarries of ancient date, and on the right (S) side of the ravine,
nhout 600 paces from its mouth, lies the temple

The rock-temple of the goddess Pekhet, ralled Speos Art√©midos
('Grotto of Artemis') by the Greeks, is known to the Arabs as Izetabt
Antar ('Antar's stable'), after an ancient hero. It consists of a vestibule and of an inner chamber connected with the vestibule by a
short corridor. It was built in the joint reign of Queen Hatshepsut
and King Thntmosis Ill.; the latter afterwards erased the names
and representations of his sister (vamp. p.'? y.H, and Sethes 1.
[ 19th Dynf) inserted his own names in the blanks.

liver the Entrance to the temple is a long inscription in praise of the
reign of Hatshepsul. Of the eight pillars which supported the VESTIBULE
only three now remain; the < e bear on their sides the names OfThntmosis Ill.
and Sethos I. (originally Hatshepsut). The fronts seem to have been adorned
with sistra (antinished). Rear Wall. To the left of the door. Sethos 1. hetween Amou-RE (enthroned) and the lion-headed Pekhet: Thout delivering a speech to the nine great gods of Karnak and t0 the gods of Upper
and Lower Egypt. To the right of the door are three reliefs: Sethos
saerifieing to Pektusti Sethos receiving from Pekhet the hieroglyphic: hr
the word'life', hanging from two sceptres; Sethns blessed by Thout. To
the left in the CORRIDOR is a long, inscription of Sethos 1. and a representation of the king otrering wine to Pekhe to the right, he otl'ers her "
raynoceplsalus. In the rear wall at the INNER CHAMBER is a niche intended
for a statue of the goddess.

To the IN. (right) is a second grotto, on the outside ofwhieh, at
the entrance, are the (-arteuches of'Alexander ff., son of Roxana,
and six small scenes representing the king in the company of the
gods. The interior, which was supported by pillars, is now in min
perhaps it was never completed. In the vicinity are several rocktombs of the New Empire, in the form of rectangular chambers,
with deep shafts

We now return to the mouth of the desert-ravine and proceed
thence to the N., passing the ruins of Benihasan el-Nrdim ('0ld
L'euihasan'; see p. 226). In l, 2 hr. we reach a ruined tower, whence
the path ascends the hill-slope to the
*Rock Tombs of Benil.1asan (% hr.'s ride direct from the land-.
ing-plate). These were constructed during the Middle Empire by
the princes and grandees of the town of Monet-Khufu ('Nurse ot'
Khnfn'), and rank among the most interesting monuments in all
Egypt, not only on areount of their remarkable architectural features, but also for their important inscriptions and representations
of scenes from the domestic life of the early Egyptians. The latter
are painted in bright colours upon stucco, but many of them are
faded and injured.

The tombs, 30 in all, are arranged in a row in the rocks and are
now distinguished lay real numbers. The best examples are protected by
