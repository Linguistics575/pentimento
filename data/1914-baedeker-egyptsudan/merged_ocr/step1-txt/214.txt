with the Museum was the famous Alexandria" Library, which contained
400,000 scrolls as early as the reign of Ptolemy II. Philadelphus, while in
Caesars time, when it was burned, the number had risen to about 900,000.
The library lay to the N. of the Museum, near the harbour. Apart from the
revenues enjoyed by the Museum in its corporate capacity, a yearly sultry
was paid to each of the members, whose number in the time of the first
Ptolemies has been estimated at one hundred at least.

The Serapeum (Greek Sarapeion), or great temple of Serapis, whose
worship was introduced by the Ptolemies, was situated on the hill on
which stands Pompey's Pillar (p.16).

In 69 A.D. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor by the Alexandrians, his recognition having been to a great extent due to the
influence of the philosophers then resident at the Museum. In
Trajan's reign (98-117) the Jews, who constituted one-third of
the whole population, caused sanguiuary riots. Hadrian (117-138),
who visited the city in 130, held public disputations with the professors at the Museum. Marcus Aurelius (161-180) attended the
lectures of the grammarians Athenaeus, Harpoeration, Hephastion,
Julius Pollux, and others. Lucian also lived at Alexandria at this
period, in the capacity of secretary to the prefect of Egypt. In
100 Sepiimius Severus (193-211) visited Alexandria and established
a municipal constitution. A disastrous visit was that of Caracalla
(211-217), who revenged himself for the derision of the citizens
by a bloody massacre and also caused the academy to be closed.
Still more disastrous were the contests between the Palmyrenes and
the Imperialists (p. cxi), in which a large part of the population was
swept away by the sword, pestilence, and famine.

Christianity early found its way to Alexandria. According to
tradition the Gospel was first preached to the Alexandrians by St.
Mark (whose bones were removed to Venice in 820). The first
great persecution of the Christians, which took place in the reign
of Decius (9-50), was a terrible blow to the Alexanilrians. The city
had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and had
since 190 possessed a theological school, presided over by Pantamus
and Clement of Alexandria (beginning of 3rd cent), who endeavoured to combine Christianity with the Neo-Platonism which sprang
up about this period at Alexandria and was taught by Ammonius
Saecas, Herennius, Plotinus (p. 233), Porphyrius, Iamblichus, and
others. A second persecution took place in 257, during the reign of
Valerian; and shortly afterwards, in the reign of Gallienus, the
plague carried off a large portion of the population. Alexa dria,
however, still continued to be regarded as the chief seat of Christian
erudition and of the orthodox faith (Athanasian Creed), until it
was eventually obliged to yield to Constantinople its proud position as the centre of Greek thought and science. Sanguinary quarrehitook place between the Athanasian party and the Arians under
their unworthy bishop Georgius. On the accession of Julian the
Apostate (361-363) the pagans of Alexandria again instituted a
persecution of the Christians. In the reign of Theodosius (379-395),
