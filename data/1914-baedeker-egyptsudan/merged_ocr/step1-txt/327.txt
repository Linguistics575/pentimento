chose this high-lying situation that he might still, even after death,
be able to see the mausolea of his seven favourite wives in the
valley below.

The entrance to the mosque lies on the N.W. side in the lower part
of the minaret, which is built in the earlier style of architecture. It
leads to an open court adjoined by the vaulted prayer-room which is
decorated in the Byzantine-Persian taste. To the left of it is the tomb
of the founder.

Below the mosque are the Rocky Caves of Coptic monks, with Coptic
and Arabic inscriptions. Some of them may be reached by a steep path.

At the N. end of the plateau is an old Turkish Fort, whence a
bridge descends to the citadel. On the NE. and higher part of the
Mohattam, separated from the citadel by a large quarry, is a memorial stone, to the right, adjoining the summit, erected in 1874 by
the British party of seientiiity men who observed the transit of Venus
from this point. The projecting rock in front of this commands
the most extensive panorama in the neighbourhood of Cairo,
and should certainly be visited if time permit. The S. end of
these hills is skirted by the road to the smaller Petrified Forest,
which may be reached from this point in about 1 hr. (see p. 110)

On the steep slope of the Mokattam, to the S of the Giytishi
Mosque, lies the so-called Castle of the Mamelukes or mosque of El
L'halawifii, built in 1533. The ruinous interior may be entered from
below. A steep path, practicable for expert climbers only, ascends
hence through the above-mentioned Coptic caves to the plateau.

The route back to the town skirts the citadel on the S. and
leads via the Bill) el-Yard/eh and the Place Saladin (p. 68).

4. Spring of Moses and the Petrified Forest.

The geologist will certainly find it profitable to visit the Petrified
Forest (comp. p. lxix), but for other travellers its chief interest lies in
the fact that they here obtain their first glimpse of the E. desert. The
latter may therefore content themselves with an excursion to the Little
Petrified Forest, the outskirts of which may be reached in 11/2-2 hrs. The
expedition may be made in half-a-day 0n donkey-back (p. 39). Carriages
require extra horses and even then sometimes stick in the sand. - The
deviation to the so-ealled Spring of Moses adds rather less than an hour
to the expedition, and ifthe donkey-boy knows the route a guide may be
dispensed with. A visit to the Great Petrified Forest can hardly be Iteeomplished without the aid of u. well-informed guide.

Starting at the Bib ea-Nay (p. 77), or from the point where
the route to the Tombs of the Caliphs leaves the Muski (p. iii),
we ride by the Tombs of the Caliphs, pass between the Mohattam
(p. 116) and the'Ited Mountain' (p.115), and ascend a desert
valley, into which the E. spurs of the Mokattam descend. Farther
on an isolated hill of red and black sandstone resembling the'lled
Mountain' is visible in the desert on our left. W cross a watercourse (usually dry), where the paths separate That to the
