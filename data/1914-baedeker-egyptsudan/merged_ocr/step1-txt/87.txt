Heuenistic Christian civilization, which we must regard as the
hybrid product of Greek and Asiatic feelings and philosophy.

When that point is established Islamic civilization falls into its
natural position in the general scheme of the historical development of the world. From the days of Alexander the Great down to
the Roman imperial epoch the East had been forced to bow to
European ideas and to submit to European domination. But just as
in the days of the early emperors the Hellenic spirit was sutfocatml in the embrace of the Orient and the classical world hungrily
assimilated the cults and religions of the East; so an ethnical renaissance of the East began in the second century and the Semitic
element steadily asserted itself beneath the Hellenistic surface.
With the spread of the Arabs the Orient once more achieved an
independence in the political sphere, corresponding to that which
had slowly been growing in the intellectual sphere. The first result
of the political union of the whole of the Near East was that the
Greek intellectual impulses there, cut off from their original sources
of inspiration and operating only through Semites, were submerged
by orientalism. On the other hand the seeds of Asiatic civilization
found fresh nourishment in the new whole formed by the permanent
political connection between the Near East and Western Asia; and
the Asiatic reaction against the comprehensive expansion of the
Greek spirit operated until far on in the Islamic period. Thus Js-.
lamie civilization finds its organic connection with and place in the
general course of history. Further, we recognize another important
bond of connection; for, if Islam simply carried Christian civilization a step farther, we are no longer surprised by the profound
inner relationship between the mental outlook of medieval Christianity and that of Islam; both systems are based upon the common
foundation of the Greek-Oriental civilization of Christian antiquity.
The Arabs on the one hand consistently stressed the oriental elements in this civilization; while on the other hand, on European
soil, the Germanic spirit turned farther and farther away from these
and elaborated from its inner consciousness the typical western
forms of the middle ages.

From these fundamental principles it becomes clear why Arabia
could not permanently remain the seat of the Caliphate, Damascus
superseded Medium It was only in the agitated period of the Arab
empire, the period of expansion, that the artificial condition of
the political supremacy of the Arabs over subjects superior to them
in culture could he maintained. In the long run the economic
and intellectual intlueuee of the subjugated races was bound to
tell and the deposition of the Arab ruling class was inevitable.
The levelling influence of Islam, as it was understood by the overwhelming majority of its converts, destroyed the economic basis of
the Arab dominion and with it the prerogatives of the Arabs as
such. The net results of the Arab period of Islamic civilization
