126 Route 6. PYRAMIDS OF Gillan. Construction.

construction of the Pyramids has been opposed by Flinders Petrie,
who has sought to show that the initial plan of each pyramid praetically contemplated the full extent reached by the completed work.
But more recently Borchardt has demonstrated conclusively that
Lepsius's theory of the gradual growth of each pyramid is not incur Â»
rect, though it requires modification in some essential points. According to Borchardt, each pyramid builder began by planning a
monument of moderate size. In many Instances this original small
conception was permanently adhered to; but it not unfrequently
happened that kings who enjoyed long reigns or found themselves
in control of more extensive powers expanded their original designs
and enlarged their buildings, either by mere additions without
altering the passages or chambers (as in the step-pyramid at Salthara) or by revising the whole original design, including the chambers, ete., on anew and more extensive scale (as in the second
and third pyramids of Gizeh). Occasionally a second enlargement
took place, as in the case of the Great Pyramid.

The Pyramids were opened by sacrilegious robbers at a very early
period, probably under the 20th Dyn., when also the tombs of the
Theban kings were plundered, or even earlier. Attempts were made
to force an entrance into the inner chambers, and passages were
laboriously cut through the solid masonry in order to reach the
expected treasures. In the course of this mining and tunnelling the
passages and chambers sustained much damage. Somewhere about
the period of the 25th or 26th Dyn. these injuries were repaired
and the pyramids restored. But they seem to have been again invaded by the Persians; and also at later periods, under the Romans
and under the Arabs, renewed attempts were made to penetrate
to the treasures supposed to lie in the interior.

The first modern traveller who carefully and successfully examined
the Pyramids was Nicholas Shaw in 1721; hut he still entertained the
notion that the Sphinx had a subterranean connection with the Great
Pyramid. He was followed by Norden in 1737; Pococke in 1743, who
gives a plan and dimensions; Fourmontin 1755; Carsten Niebuhr in
1761; Davison in 1763; Bruce in 1768; Volney in 1783; Browne in 1792-98;
Denon, Coutelle, Jomard, and other savants of the French expedition
under Bonaparte in 1799-1801. Jomard in particular has the merit of
having taken very accurate measurements. Hamilton, in 1801, was a
dispassionate and critical observer. In 1817 Caviglia, a bold, but illiterate
and fanciful seamen, was fortunate in eliciting new facts regarding the
interior of the Great Pyramid, and excavated the Sphinx. In the same year
Belzoni thoroughly explored the interior of the Second Pyramid. Belzoni,
an intelligent explorer and accurate draughtsman, was originally a monk
at Rome, but when the French occupied that city he retired to London,
where he devoted himself to study in spite of many hardships. In 1815 he
reached Egypt, where, besides exploring the pyramid, he discovered the
tomb of Sethos I. at Thebes, etc. The next eminent explorer was Sir Gardner
Wilkinson in 1831. In 1837 and 1838 Colt Howard Vyse and Mr. Perring
made very thorough investigations and took careful measurements which
will always be considered authoritative. In 1842-45 Prof. Lepsius, the
distinguished German Egyptologist, made several very important discoveries and furnished us with much valuable information He found no
fewer than thirty pyramids which had been quite unknown to previous
