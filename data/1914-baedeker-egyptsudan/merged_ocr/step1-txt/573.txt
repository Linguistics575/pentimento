Pyramid, resting upon a substructure cased with fine limestone slabs.
in the W. wall of the hall were inserted the Sepulchrat Chapels of
the Favourites ofthe Royal Harem. On the W. we next reach a COURT
surrounded by colonnades. in the pavement of this court was the
entrance to a sloping passage 164 yds. long, leading to the subterranean tomh-chamher of Montuhotep IV. On the E. side of the
court are openings admitting to the shaft-tombs of the favourites
A large PILLARED HALL (only the bases of its 80 octagonal pillars
remain) and a SANCTUARY (hewn in the rock) terminated the temple.
- To the N.W. of this building stood a Sanctuary of Hathor built
by Thutmosislll., ofwhich no trace remains. The shrine, constructed
in the rock and containing the image of the deity as a cow, is now
in the Museum of Cairo O.85).

Numerous very important discoveries have been made in the Venue:
JF Item EL-BAl'HH. Thus, in 1881, the Royal Mummies mentioned at p. 93
were found in a shaft a little to the S. of the mortuary temple, while
in 1891 a Common Tomb for Theban Priests was discovered immediately
to the N of the lower terrace (contents now in the Museum of Cairo
and Alexandria, pp. 00, 22). Here is situated also the subterranean Tomb
of Mentuhotep lil. (see p. 304), known to the Arabs as Bab eI-Hosdn, which
was discovered by Mr. Carter in 1900, but has been covered in again.

By proceeding from Deir el-Bahri in the direction of Kurna, we
soon reach the small depression known as El-Asasif. This contains
a large
Necnoroms, the rock-tomhs in which date mostly from the beginning of the Suite period (25th and 26th Dyno. Various brick
buildings are noticed also. The large arched gateway belonged to
a great mortuary chapel built by the Theban prince Ment-em-het
(26th DynJ. The tombs usually consist of an open court, to which
a flight of steps descends and whence a door admits to a large hall,
beyond which are the inner passages and chambers.

Of especial interest is the Tomb of Ehe (No. 36), an omeial in the reign
of b'itocvis, daughter of Psammetichos L, which contains reliefs copied from
originals of the time of the Ancient Empire. A flight of steps leads into
the antechamher, where the deceased is represented sitting at the table
of offerings and receiving tsacrificial gifts. In the room adjoining this on
the right are tasteful reliefs of artisans and dances. Farther on we come
to what was originally an open court with arcades at the sides; the reliefs
on the walls represent sacrificial scenes, among which one of a hunt
should be noticed. The adjacent colonnade leads to several chambers
farther on. - Among the other tombs of the same epoch may be mentioned the fme but much injured tomb of Prince Harm: (No. 37; inaccessible
at present), an official of Queen Ameneriais, sister of the Ethiopian King
Shahako; the Tomb of Nent-em-hit (No. M., a Theban prince
of the time of the Assyrian domination (20th Dyn.ji and the Tomb of
Peieamenopet (No. 33), a high official under the Nils Dyn. (comp. p. 329).
This last tomb is larger than any of the kings' tombs at Bibiin el-Nuliik,
being 287 yds. in length and 2710 5: ]. yds. in area. The carefully executed
inscriptions and reliefs, now unfortunately much injured and blackened,
refer almost without exception to the fate of the soul after death.

On the N. slope of the hill of li2-Khtskha is the American House
