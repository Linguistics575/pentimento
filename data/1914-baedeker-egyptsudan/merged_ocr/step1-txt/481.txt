original doors corresponded to the seven sanctuaries of the temple.
Processions in honour of the king seem to have entered by the door
to the extreme left; the next served for processions to Ptah, the third
for Harakhte, the fourth for Amen, the fifth for Osiris, the sixth
for Isis, and the seventh for Horns. Ramses, however, walled up
six ofthese doors, leaving the central one alone as the main entrance
to the temple.

The present entrance is by the ancient main door. We first
oter the First Hypostyle Hall, which is about 57 yds. wide by
12 deep. The roof, part of which has fallen in is supportedby
24 clustered papyrus-ol-s, with bud-capitals. The columns
are so arranged that two pairs stand on each side of the five central
proeessional aisles, while the two outermost aisles are each flanked
on one side by the walls of the temple. The representations on the
shafts of the columns represent the king before the deity to whom
the aisle led, sometimes accompanied by the other deities of his
trial Thus in the Anion aisle we see Ramses II. before Amen,
Nut, and Khons; in the Ptah aisle, the king before Ptah, Sekhmet
(liathor), and Nefertem. The sculptures (reliet's'en trreuxO are
of mediocre workmanship; they date from Ramses IT., who here
forgot his filial piety so far as to chisel away his father's reliefs to
make room for his own, The only interesting MURAL REPRESENTATIONS are those in the lower row on the end-wall to the right. To
the right Thout and Horus pour over llamses H. the holy water in
the form of the hieroglyphics for'purity' and'life'; to the loft
Wepwawet, with a wolf's head,
'the avenger of his father', hold the hieroglyphic for'life' to the
king's nose close by, to the right, is Hathor of Dendera; farther
to the left, Ramses hands to Osiris and his companions, Isis and
Horus, a case for papyrus-rolls in the shape of a column held by
a kneeling king, with a falcou's head on the top as a lid.

Seven doors, placed in the axes of the built-up entrance-doors
and the sanctuaries, lead from this first hall into the Second Hypostyle Hall. The architrave, on which rest the roofing slabs, is supported by 36 columns, arranged on either side of the processional
aisles in pairs on the same system as in the preceding hall. The
'31 columns in the first two rows of columns have papyrus-bud
capitals. Beyond the second row the floor of the temple is considerably raised, forming a platform upon which stands the third
row of column These are tree-trunk columns (p'civiii), with
vylindrical shafts and no capitals, on which rust stone slabs forming an abacus for the support of the architrave. The inseriptions and representations on the walls and columns date from the
reign of Sethos and are of admirable workmanship, but their subjects
are oflittle general interest. The wonderful *Relicfs on the right end
of the hall (Pi. bl should not be overlooked. Here, to the right, we
see Sethos L standing before Osiris and Horus, holding a censer and
