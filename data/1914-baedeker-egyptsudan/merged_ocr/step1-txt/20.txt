not less than 25-303. (Steamboat and railway fares are of course
extra; pp. 1-6.) The traveller whose time is very limited, or who
is accompanied by ladies, will require also the services of a guide,
or'dragoman' (p. XXV; 5-103. per day). With modest requirements,
however, it is possible to live more cheaply.

MONEY. A small sum of money for the early part of the journey
may be taken in English or French gold, but large sums should
always be in the form of letters of credit or circular notes. These
are issued by the principal London banks and by Messrs. Thus.
Cook & Son. Travellers proceeding to Upper Egypt may deposit
these notes in Cairo and have supplies sent after them, as required,
by money orders. European bankers in Alexandria and Cairo, see
pp. 10, 37. The National Bank of Egypt has branches or agents in
most Egyptian towns and also in kharttun, Suiikin, and Port Sudan.
The cheques issued by the American Express Companies, the American Bankers' Association, and the International Navigation Co. are
convenient also. - For Money Orders, see p. xix.

EQUIPMENT. For all ordinary purposes a couple of light tweed
suits, a few flannel and soft cotton shirts, a supply of thin woollen
socks, one pair of light and easy boots, one of shoes, and one of
slippers, a moderately warm ulster or long travelling cloak, a pith
helmet and a soft felt hat or a straw hat, together with the most
necessary articles of the toilet, will amply suffiee. Evening dress is
usually worn at dinner at the principal hotels. Riding-breeehes
and gaiters are convenient for excursions. All articles should be
new and strongly made, as it is often difficult to get repairs properly
executed in Egypt. Few travellers walk in Egypt, except for very
short distances, but sportsmen should add a stout pair of waterproof
shooting-boots to their equipment.

Among the most important extras to be brought from Europe are a
drinking-cup of leather or metal, "flask, a strong pocket-knife, a thermometer, a pocket-compass, a fleld-glairs, and an electric, acetylene, orfmagnesium lamp for lighting cavern; and dark chambers. - Photographic
materials, dry plates, films, etc., can be obtained in Cairo, hut it is preferable to bring a good stock carefully packed (films in air-tight tin cases)
from home, taking can to attend the customs examination in..', person.
On account of the climate photographs should be developed'as soon as
possible; but the traveller should be chary of entrusting his negatives
(particularly in the case of rum) to small photograph dealers.

COMPANIONS. The facilities for travel in Egypt are now such
that even the inexperienced traveller will have 1ittleidiffieu1ty in
managing an independent tour, without recourse to the assistance
of tourist-agents or of dragomans (p. XXV), which add considerably
to the cost. - In spring and autumn TOURIST PARTIES are organized
for a visit to Egypt and the East by the tourist-agents Messrs. Thus.
Cook' Son (Ludgate Circus, London) and the Hamburg' AngloAmerican Nile Co. (15 Cockspur St., London, S.W.), programmes,"
which, with full information, may be obtained free on application.
Travellers who join such parties are enabled to inspect the principal
