lvi II. GEOGRAPHICAL AND b. Modem Egyptians:

government ot'tiees; but they were soon doomed to suffer persecutions
and privations of every description. These persecutions were mainly
due to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual conspiracies
against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries
even attributed to them the disastrous contraption: frem'which
the new capital of the country so frequently suffered. Their hopes
were doomed to bitter disappointment, and their national pride to
utter humiliation. Their conquerors succeeded in maintaining their
position, and though apparently at first inclined to moderation, were
at length driven by the conduct and the previous example of the
Copts themselves to persecute and oppress them to the uttermost.

In spite, however, of all these disasters a numerous community
of Copts has always existed in Egypt, a fact which is mainly to be
accounted for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual oppression
and contempt to which they have been subjected, they have degenerated in every respect, while their character has been correspondingly altered. Their divine worship will strike the traveller as
strange, and anything but edifying or elevating (comp. p. 1071.
It is true that the Copt is a regular attendant at church ('keniseh0,
but his conduct while there and the amount of benefit he receives
are somewhat questionable. In the service the Coptic language, Le.
the language of the Egyptians of the 3rd cent. A.l)., is used for praying and chanting. But as the majority even of the priests themselves,
though able to read this ancient speech, do not understand it, the
Arabic translation of the prayers is given at the same time, and
the sermon is delivered in Arabic. Since the 6th cent. the doctrine of the Jacobites has been in a state of deathlike lethargy which
has made even the slightest attempt at further development impossible. In no other religious community is fasting so common as
among the Christians of Egypt and Abyssinia. They still found their
creed upon Old Testament institutions, and so show pretty clearly
that had Christianity been confined to the East it would never have
become the chief religion of the world. The Coptic church has not
even training-colleges for its ministers.

The Copts are no longer distinguished from the Arabs by their
dress. Only the priests now wear the dark blue or black turban and
the dark-eoloured clothes, a costume that was originally prescribed
by their oppressors. A practised eye will frequently detect among
them the ancient Egyptian east of features. Towards strangers the Copt
is externally obliging, and when anxious to secure their favour he not
unfreqnently appeals to his Christie n creed as a bond of union. Many
Copts have recently been converted to Protestantism by American missionaries, particularly in Upper Egypt, ehiefly through the foundation
of good schools and the distribution of cheap Arabic Bibles. Even the
orthodox Copts have a great reverence for the sacred volume, and it
is not uncommon to meet with members of their seat who know the
