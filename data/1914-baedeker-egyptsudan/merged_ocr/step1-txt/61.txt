Copls. PULITHJA L NOTES. lv

lastly, their 00mplexion is fairer. These tlifferenees are sufficiently
accounted for by their mode oflife; for, when we compare those
Copts who are engaged in rustic pursuits, or the Coptic camel
drivers of Upper Egypt, with the fellahin, we thul that the two
races are not distinguishable from each other. This dualism of
type in bodily structure, common to all civilized lands of the South,
has been recognized also in the skeletons of the ancient mummies.

Few nations in the East embraced the Gospel more zealously
than the. dwellers on the Nile. Aeenstomed as they had long been
to regard life as a pilgrimage to death, as a school of preparation for
another world, and weary of their motley and confused Pantheon
of divinities, whose self-seeking priesthood designediy disguised
the truth, they eagerly welcomed the simple doctrines of Christianity,
which appeared so well adapted to their condition and promised
them succour and redemption. Like Eutyches, they revered the
divine nature of the Saviour only, in which they held that every
human element was absorbed; and when the Council of Chalcedon
in 451 sanctioned the doctrine that Christ combined a human with
a divine nature, the Egyptians with their characteristic tenacity
adhered to their old views, and formed a sect termed Eutychians, or
Monophysites, to which the Copts of the present day, and also the
Abyssinians, still belong.

The name of the Copts is an ethnical one, being simply an Arabic corrnption of the Greek name of Egyptians. The theory is now exploded that
they derive their name from a certain itinerant preacher named Jaeobus,
who according to Maigrizi was termed El-Beriidin, or'hlanket-hearer', from
the old horse-eloth Worn by him when he went about preaching. This
Jaeohus promulgated the monoPhysite doctrine of Eutyches, which had
found its most zealous supporter in Dioseurus, a bishop of Alexandria,
who was declared a heretie and banished after the Council of Chalcedon;
and his disciples were sometimes called Jacobites. If this name had ever
been abbreviated to Cobit or Uubt, it would probably have occurred
frequently in the writings of 31onophysites-, but there we find no trace
of it. It is, on the other hand, quite intelligible that the word Copt,
though originally synonymous with Egyptian, should gradually have come
to denote a particular religious sect; for, at the period when the valley
of the "It: was conquered by Amr, the native Egyptians, who almost
exclusively held the monophysite creed, were chiefly distinguished by
their religion from their in days, who brought a new religious system
from the East.

These Egyptian Christians strenuously opposed the resolutions of
the Council of Ghalcedon, and thousands of them sacrificed their
lives or their welfare in the fierce and sanguinary eonfliets of the
tith century, the causes of which were imperfectly understood by
the great majority of the beiligereuts. The subtle dogmatic differences which gave rise to these wars aroused such hatred among
these professors of the religion of love, that the defeated Monophysites readily welcomed the invading armies of IsWn, or perhaps
even invited them to their country.

After the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs (p. 44) the Copts were
at first treated with ienity, and were even appointed to the highest
