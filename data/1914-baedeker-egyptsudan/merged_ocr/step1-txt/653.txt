The most important harbours on the Red Sea, named from N. to S.,
were Myos Hormos (now Abu Shdr cl-KiLli), Lmkos Limen (now
Kowir), and Berenike.

FROM 1.iEsrm TO Anu SHAIR EL-KIBLI, 5- 6 days The route loads
to the N. E. from the l "ddi 11 eneh to the (3 days' march) mm Pamela,
on the N. side of which lies the Gelrel Fa.itreh (4920 ft.; Mons Claudianus). About 1/2 M. to the S. of the latter Wadi are the granite
quarries, known as Umm Ditat ('mother of columns'), which were
worked by eaptives and convicts, chiefly in the reigns of Trajan and
Hadrian. Traces have been found also of old gold-mines, the
exploitation ofwhich is again being attempted by the Fatirah Exploring Company. Here are situated also the ruins of the Roman settlement of Hydreuma Trajani. These consist mainly of a fort about
S?, yds. square surrounded by walls and towers. Outside the walls
lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found in the quarries. About two days'
journey farther to the N. is the Man: Porphyrites, now called Gebet
Dukh√©n ('smoke mountain'; 4460 (1), the ancient porphyry quarries
of which were worked by the Romans. Here are the ruins of an
Ionic temple of the time of Hadrian (never completed), remains of an
irregularly built town, and two large water-reservoirs. We follow
the ancient route hence to the plateau of Abu & dir el-Kibli, on the
E. slope of which lie the ruins of Myos Hermes (see above). On the
coast, 3 M. to the E., are the remains of a Roman fort.- A second
route, running farther to the s., along the ancient'Porphyry Road',
ascends the large Wddi Keneh, then proceeds to the Wddi (fatter,
and finally skirts the S. base of the Mons Porphyrites to the sea,

The JOURNEY FROM KENEH T0 KosEIB, (4-5 days; from Luxor,
see below) is much more interesting. The route from Keneh follows
the valley of the Nile for the first day and leads through the villages
of Shaikh Rehab, Dam, and hTvn Hmrtm, the first on the left, the
other two on the right side of the road. The first night is generally
spent at the caravanserai ofBir'Anlbar, about 31/; hrs. from Keneh.
This large earavanserai was erected at the expense of an Ibrahim
Pasha and comprises several separate buildings, covered with domeshaped roofs and surrounded by courts and colonnades.

on the second day we advance steadily towards the E., ascending
almost imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain intersected in
all directions by small undulating heights. All around us extend
the interminable yellowish-grey, snn-bleached rocks of the desert;
not a trace of organic life is visible. not a single green tree or shrub.
To the E. of the Gebel el-Karn ('the horn'), about midway between
Bir'Ambar and Laheita, the road from [ geneh is joined by that from
Luxor. The only variety is afforded by an occasional Mabwala or Maltatta. The mabwalas are the places where the camels are halted
from time to time to make water. They occur on every great caravam
