passage extending the whole length of the building and leading
first to a kind of vestibule and then to the tomb chamber. The new
empty sareophagus completely fills the niche in which it stands.

The Murat Relief: in the great court deserve no long tysamination; they are much injured by exposure and some have become
altogether unrecognizable. On the N.
Watt (P1. e) Ti is represented superintending the saerifiee and cutting
up of cattle, shown in the woodcut
at p. 151, and servants with giftst.
Behind the wall here was another
chamber (Sew'drib, PL D i p. clxviii), containing statues. On the E. Wall (PLf)
there are reliefs only to the left: Ti
home in a litter, preceded by attendants carrying fans, boxes, and chairs.
On the W. Wall (from right to left):
Ti and his wife (PI. h) inspect the
fattening of goose and the feeding of
cranes (Pl. g); a poultry-yard (Pl. i);
Ti receiving the accounts of his omhiuls, who stand in a house supported
by columns; li (upper part injured)
superintending the arrival of his Nile
boats, while herds of various kinds are
driven towards him (Pl. k); false door
dedicated to Ti's sou CPI. o.

We pass through the door in the
corner, noticing on each side three
iigures of Ti, represented as walking
from within, each time in a different
costume. The door admits to a CORRIDOR
(Pl. E). On each side-wall are servants
bearing of offerings into the tomb. l.) n
the right is also a false door dedicated
to? iefer-Uipes, the wife of Ti. Another door admits us to a SECOND
CORRIDOR. In the lower row on the Left Wall the slaughter of
cattle for saerifice is represented; in the upper row statues of the
deceased are being drawn to the tomb on sledges, in front of
which a man pours water to prevent the heavily laden sledges
from taking fire by friction. On the Right Wall appear ships in
which Ti has inspected his estates in the Delta. The curious



, We annex woodcuts of some of the best of these scenes, from photographs taken from impressions obtained by Dr. 1teil (d. 1880), and therefore almost facsimiles. With the exception of the large picture of Ti
engaged in hunting (p. 158), which is one-nineteenth the original size.
they are reduced to one-twelfth of the original size.
