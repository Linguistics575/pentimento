Port Sudan, with 4650 inhab., the flourishing port of the AngloEgyptian Stulsin and the principal outlet for its trade in gum (19,090
tons in 1912, valued at S' E 598,648) and for cotton, is the chief town
of the Red Sea province, situated in N. lat. 19°37' and E. long. 37014',
on a deep bay running inland in a N. direction. It was founded as the
terminus of the railway from the Nile to the Red Sea, constructed in
1904-5 and opened in 1906, as the dangerous harbour of Suékin
(see below) could not be adapted to the requirements of modern
shipping. The imports, excluding Government goods, amounted in
1912 to £13 631,177 and the exports to SE 900,158 as compared
to £13 418,088 and SE 342,987 respectively in 1000. The town
proper, with its clean streets and neat houses, lies on the W. bank
of the harbour, opposite the quays. Outside the town are settlements
of Siidtn negroes and of Hadendoa Beduins, a nomad tribe frequenting the mountains between the Nile and the Red Sea.

The interesting visit to Smihu (see below) is best made as a dayexcursion (provisions should be taken).

the foundation of Port Sudan (comp. above) and is still an important
harbour for the shipping of cotton from the Tokar district. The town w ith
its maze of alleys contains many tall Moorish-looking houses of white coral
stone, with carved doors and windows. From the railway station outside
the town a road, passing through two old gateways which form part of the
former fortifications, leads in 20 min. to the Government House, a battlemented building picturesquely overhanging the water's edge. This served
as the headquarters of both Gordon and Kitchener. On the mainland,
opposite the island, are seen traces of the old railway to Berber, begun
by the British government in 1885 but soon abandoned.
