Guides, Carriages, and Donkey }, see p. 252. - Hurried travellers should
see the Temple of Khons and the main portions of the great Temple of
Amen. Carriages and riding-animals, which the visitor quits at the Ist pylon
(p. 266), should be ordered to meet him at the 7th or, if the Temple of
hut is also to be visited, at the 10th pylon. The view from the first pylon
of the Temple of Amen (p. 266) and the survey of the great Hypostyle
Hall (p. 268) are wonderfully effective hy moonlight.

The main street of Luxor is prolonged to the N. of the Zabtiyeh
Square (p. 253) by a good road (comp. P1. D, 1), which we follow,
passing (right) the Summary Tribunal and the church and school of
the American Mission. Beyond a small bridge we skirt the Roman
Catholic cemetery (left). The road to the right, passing the sacred
lake of the Temple of Mut (p. 281) and crossing the railway, leads
to Medarm1t (p. 281), while that to the left runs direct to the village
of Kama }: with the great Temple of Amon and the house of the
director of the excavations at Karnak. The main road, straight
ahead, brings us to the Temple of Khons. On the way we pass the
pedestals of numerous recumbent rams (p. 261), while others ilank
also the old road to the Temple of Mut that diverges here.

a. TEMPLE OF KHONS AND SURROUNDING BUILDINGS.

A handsome Portal, erected by Euergetes I., with a winged sun-disk
in the concave cornice, forms the S.W. entrance to the templepreoinets of Karnak, which were enclosed by a brick wall. The
reliefs represent Euergetes praying and sacrificing to the Theban
deities. Beyond this portal another avenue of sphinxes, erected by
Ramses XII., the last of the Ramessides, brings us to the beautiful
Temple of Khons. This temple was dedicated to the Theban
moon-god Khons, son of Amon and Nut, and, like Ramses IIL's
temple to Amen (p. 267), may be regarded as a characteristic
example of an Egyptian sanctuary under the New Empire. Ramses m. reared the walls of this temple, but placed reliefs only in the
innermost chambers; the completion of the decoration was left for
his successors Ramses IV., Ramses XII., and the priest-king Herihor,
the last of whom built also the court (Pl. A).

The entrance is formed by a large Pylon (Pi. P-P), 105 ft. in
length, 33 ft. in breadth, and 59 ft. in height. Upon the front may
be seen the four vertical grooves, with the corresponding apertures
in the masonry, used in fastening the flag-staffs. The reliefs on
the towers of the pylon show the high-priest Pinotem 1. (21st Dyn.)
and his wife Hent-tewe saerifieing to various Thehan deities. In
front of each tower lay a porch, borne by columns and surmounted
by a wooden ceiling. The bases of the columns are still in situ..-mie
central portal (with reliefs of Alexander 11.) admits us to the
Court (Pl. A), which is surrounded on two sides by a colonnade
with a double row of papyrus-columns with bud-capitals. On the
