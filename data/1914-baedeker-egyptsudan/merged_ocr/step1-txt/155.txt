body at pleasure, provided, of course, that the latter did not decay.
Thus from ancient times everything was done in Egypt to prevent
the destruction of the body, and so to enable the soul to recognize
its mortal tenement. A prominent place in the belief of the ancient
Egyptians was taken by the Ka, a kind of guardian-spirit or genius,
which was born with the individual and accompanied him through
life as a'double'. The Ha did not expire with its protege but continued to live in order to protect the deceased in the future world.

In the earliest period the dead were buried in a crouching posture
with their knees drawn up and lying on their left side. In the Ancient Empire the custom of leaving the corpse at full length began
to be followed, probably at first in the case of the kings. At the
same time embalming was attempted. The bodies were treated with
saline solutions and bitumen and rolled in linen bandages and wrappings. The process of preparing the mummy was more elaborate at
later times. The brains were first removed through the nostrils by
means of an iron hook; the stomach was then opened with a Nut knife
and the viscera removed (Herodotus ii. 86) and placed in four jars,
known as Canopi. These were usually closed with lids, bearing the
heads of the four sons of Osiris, to whose protection the intestines
were committed. The heart also was removed from the body, and
was replaced by a stone searabaus, laid upon the breast of the deceased, beneath the wrappings. Herodotus states that at a later
period there were three methods of embalming, differing according
to the expense involved. So much care was given to the preservation of the corpses that to this day the features of many of the mummies may be clearly made out.
