Above the defile of Gebel Silsileh the landscape changes its
character. The mountains recede from the river, giving space to
the desert, which appears grey on the Arabian side and yellow on
the Libyan side. The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of
a distinctly darker complexion than the fellahin of the Thebaid.
Both land and people approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type.

On the E. bank lies Afclit. - At the village of Monilm (E. bank)
we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here encircles the
island of s1lunyiriyeh, with a village of, the same name.

On the E. bank are the large pumping-works of the Ktrn Ombo
Co. (p. 341). On a hill and conspicuous from a considerable
distance appear the ruins of the beautiful temple of Kthn Ombo,
especially picturesque by the light of the full moon. The islands
opposite the E. bank were, perhaps, in former times united with the
mainland, or separated from it only by a narrow channel; but in the
course of centuries the Nile has gradually extended its channel
farther and farther to the E.; and during the 19th cent. alone about
20 ft. were washed away from the E. bank, along with a large portion of the building. An embankment has been constructed to
prevent further mischief.

411/2 M. K6111 Ombo (railway station, see p. MI), the'Hill of
Ombos', lies about 50 ft. above the average surface-Ievel of the Nile.
The ancient Egyptian city of Ombos probably owes its foundation to
the strategic importance of its site, upon a hill commanding both
the Nile and the routes from Nubia to the Nile valley. Yet the town
attained no great prosperity until the Ptolemaie era, when it was
converted from an ordinary provincial town into the capital of the
separate nome of Ombitcs. It was at this era that the mighty temples
were built, which excite our admiration to-day; the earlier sanctuaries have left scarcely a trace. Ombos possessed two chief gods the crocodile-headed Sobek (Suchos) and the falcon-headed Haro√©ris.
With the former were specially associated Hathor and the youthful
moon-god Khons-Hor; with the latter, the'Good Sister' (T-mmtnofret, a special form of IIathor) and the'Lord of Both lands'
fP-neb-teure). The ruins of the town, now buried in sand, lie in
the N.E. corner of the plateau. In 1893 all the temple-buildings
in the S. part of the plateau were cleared of rubbish and restored
under the directions of De Morgan. A marble tablet on the right
door of the vestibule (p. 351) commemorates the fact.

From the 1andiug-plaec, to the S. of the hill, a road skirts the
river to (5 min.) a modern flight of steps, which ascends to the
principal entrance. Tickets of admission should not be forgotten.

The temple-precincts were enclosed by a brick girdle-wall.
The entrance is formed by a massive Pylon, erected by Ptolemy
Neos Dionysos. Only the right (13.) half is now standing; the
other has sunk in the river. The reliefs show Neos Dionysos presenting various offerings to the gods of Ombos. We enter the
