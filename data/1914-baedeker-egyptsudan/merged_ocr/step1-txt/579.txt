Behind the Ramesseum especially towards the N.W., are the remains
of a number of extensive brick Buildings, some of which were erected in
the time of Ramses li., as we learn from the stamps on the bricks. Among
the rest are aome well-constructed vaults, originally covered by a platform. From the fragments of wine-jars and the stoppers found here we
may reasonably conclude that these were store-rooms in connection with
the temple. Adjacent is an altar, resembling (p. 303).
- To the w., adjoining the brick vaults, me the mine are large rectangular
Hall, the ceiling of which was home by 32 columns (the stumps of twelve
of them still remain).

About 500 paces to the N.E. of the Ramesseum we reach the Mortuary
Temple of Thutmosis 111., protected by a modern enclosing wall. Its ancient
girdle-walls are partly hewn out of the rock and partly built of crude
bricks. The inner chambers are in a very dilapidated condition, but we
can still recognize traces of hypostyle halls, brick chambers, etc. Many of
the bricks hear the name of the royal builder. - Between the Ramesseum
and this temple of Thutmosis lay the Mortuary Temples of Amenophis ff.
(18th Dyn.) and 8iptah (19th Dyn.1 the scanty remains of which were
discovered by Flinders Petrie in fiid. - Farther to the N.E., not far from
Furaa, are the remains of the Mortuary Temple of Amenophis f.

To the S. of the Ramesseum were similar temples of Prince Wezmose
(18th Dyn.), Thutmosis IV... Queen Tewosret (wife of Siptah; p. 291), and
King Amenephthes (Merenptah; p. 2871, all of which were explored by Flinders Petrie in 1896; but the remains of these are very scanty.

To the W. of the Ramesseum, on the way to Deir el-Medtneh,
lies the German House (Arab. Kaer Alrndnvea), erected by Emperor
William 11. as a lodging for the German savants at Thebes.

T. The Tombs of Sheikh'Abd el-Kurna.

The ROCK Tomes OP Smmm'Asn EL-Kunm, situated in the hill behind
the Ramesseum belong almost exclusively to high dignitaries of the
period of the 133th Dynasty. The majority consist of two parts: a wide
Hall or Vestibule, with e roof frequently home by pillars Or columns, and
a Corridor, ending in a recess in which the statues of the deceased and
his favourite relatives were erected. Not unfreqnently there is a small
chamber on each side of the corridor. In front of the tomb was a kind
of forecourt, where offerings were made to the dead. As the limestone
of the hill of Sheikh rAbd engine is of poor quality, ill adapted for
sculpture, the walls of most of the tombs were covered with clay, then
whitewashed, and adorned with paintings. The representations on the
side-walls of the hall depict the deceased in his earthly circumstances
and duties, and thua shed a flood of light upon Egyptian life of the
New Empire in its heyday. The end-walls (to the right and left) of the
hall are, as a rule, shaped like huge grave-stones; one usually bears
prayers for the dead, while on the other is recorded the biography of the
deceased. The representations on the walls of the corridors illustrate the
various funeral rites.

The more important tombs, which lie on the Ti. and N. sides of the
hill, have been enclosed within a wall; they are numbered and are
provided with doors, which are opened by the custodian. Some of the
tombs are not accessible to the general public, and to visit these permission must be obtained from the Inspector General at Luxor. - Some
of the tombs that contain no inscriptions are inhabited by the poorer
fellahin, while the forecourts serve for their livestock. In front of most
of these cave-dwellings stand covered cylinders like gigantic mushrooms,
of Nile mud and straw kneaded together. These are primitive granaries,
while their flat roofs serve as sleeping places.

If time is limited, it will be sufficient to visit the tombs otReklunerrs,
Sennofer, Amenemheb, Enne, Remote. and Nakht.
