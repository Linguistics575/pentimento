the purpose. Processions of dervishes Cp. xvii parade the streets with tings
by day and with lamps by night. The Ddsek, or ceremony of riding over
the dervishes, which also took place on the twelfth of this month, was
suppressed by the Khedive Taufils, and the ceremonies are now eonflned
to the sheikh's walking over some dervishes, his procession, and the reading of the Koran in the Khedive's tent. At night a great zikr (p. sci) is
performed by the dervishes. On this festival, as on all the tother'msilids',

On the first, or sometimes on the second, Wednesday of SHA'BAN, the
eighth month, the illalid of Imtim zxA~Sltdei is commemorated, the centre
of attraction being the mosque mentioned at p. 115. This festival is
numerously attended, as most of the Cairenes belong to the school of Imam
Shiif'fi (p. lxxxvi)..

The month of BAMAPAN, the ninth, is the month of fasting, which
begins as soon as a Moslem declares that he has seen the new moon.
The fast is strictly observed during the day, but the faithful indemnify
themselves by eating, drinking, and smoking throughout the greater part
of the night. At dusk the streets begin to he thronged, the story-tellers in
the cafes attract numbers of visitors, and many devotees assemble at the
mosques. The eve of the 27th of the month is considered peculiarly holy.
It is called the Leilet el-Kadr, or'night of honour', owing to the tradition
that the Koran was sent down to Mohammed On this night. During this
sacred night the angels descend to mortals with blessings, and the portals
of heaven stand open, affording, certain admission to the prayers of the
devout.

days of which is celebrated the tirst and minor festival ot'reioieing, called
by the Arabs Et-'fd es-Sughaiyar tthe lesser feast), but better known by its

expression to the general rejoicing at the termination of the fast; and
as at our Christmas, parents give presents to their children, and masters
to their servants at this festive season. Friends embrace each other on
meeting, and visits of ceremony are exchanged. During this festival the
Khedive receives his principal officials, ambassadors, etc.

At this season the traveller may also pay a visit to the cemetery by
the Bath en-Nasr, or to one of the others, where numerous Cairenes assemble.

A few days after the Bairam, the pieces of the Kisweh, or covering
manufactured at Constantinople, at the cost of the Sultan, for the Eaaba
lp. lxxxiv), whither it is annually carried by the pilgrims, are conveyed
in procession to the citadel, where they are sewn together and lined.
The ceremonies which take place On this occasion are repeated on a
grander scale towards the end of the month of Shame: (generally the 23rd),
when there is a gay procession of the escort which accompanies the pilgrimage caravan to Mecca and also takes charge of the Mahmal (p. xcv).
