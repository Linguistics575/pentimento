124 Route 6. PYRAMIDS 0F GiZEH. Situation.

At the tramway-terminus is astand for donkeys and camel, (5 pias.
per hr.). The porters of the MenaHOuse Hotel also will procure ridinganimals at a fixed tariff.

TICKETS for the inspection of the Pyramids and other monuments are
sold in a small office beside the Ehedirial Kiasque (Pl. a), near the N.E.
angle of the Great Pyramid: for the ascent of the Great Pyramid 10 pias.;
for a visit to the Valley
or Granite Temples pias. For the entire expedition, including the ascent
of the Great Pyramid and the visit to its interior, the charge is 20 pias.
Guides (Beduins) are procured here through application to their sheikh.
Bakshish is entirely optional, though a gratuity of a few pias. is customary.
The inspection of the minor points of interest is free; our plan and description render the assistance of a guide entirely'superfluous. - No attention
should be paid to the begging of the Beduins, and visitors are advised
to have nothing to do with the vendors of so-called'antiquities' (almost
invariably spurious). The fossil sea-urchins (Clypeaster Ailgyptiaeus) offered
here are said to be found in e miocene deposit, on a hill named by the
Arabs Gebel ShelNl, on the edge of the desert, 2 Bl. to the S. of the
Sphinx. Other guides who press their services on the traveller should
be repelled, if necessary with the help of the police.

The "Pyramids of 6129 ]: form the second and most imposing
of the six groups of pyramids which stand on the margin of the
plateau of the Libyan desert. To the N. lies the group of Abu Roash
(p.139); southwards follow the groups of Ziiwiget el-Uryiin (p. 140)
and Abuyir (p. tdi), and Dahthtlr (p. 166). The
Arab word for a pyramid is hdram (p1. ahrdm).

The Pyramids of Gizeh rank among the oldest monuments of
human industry, and their colossal proportions extort from us today the same astonishment as was felt in antiquity by Greek
and Roman travellers. We marvel not only at the technical knowledge and ability of the Egyptians, but also at the might of their
kings, who must have had absolute control over thousands of
their subjects, to be able to rear such monuments. Some conception
of the enormous amount of labour involved may be obtained when
we learn that, according to Prof. Flinders Petrie's calculation, about
2,300,000 separate blocks of stone, averaging about 21/2 tons, were
required for the Pyramid of Kheops, and that some of them were
quarried on the E. bank of the Nile and had to be ferried across
the river and conveyed to the desert-plateau.

The Construction of the Pyramids has been admirably described
by Herodotus, the earliest writer on the subject, who visited Egypt

about 450 BAI

Herodotus states (ii. IN, 125) that there were about 100,000 men employed annually for three months in constructing the Great Pyramid otheops f.
'They first made the road for the transport of the stones from the Nile to
the Libyan Mts.; the length of the road amounts to tive stadia (1017 yds),
its breadth is ten fathoms (60 ft), and its height, at the highest places,
is eightfathoms (45 rt), and it is constructed entirely of smoothed stone

, According to Prof. Flinder: Petrie, these three months fell "" 85 the
inundation, when fleld-work was at a standstill end the services of 1 ,000
men for transporting the stones could be easily enough obtained. The
stone-cutters end mason: were probably engaged all the year round in
the quarries and on the pyramid itself.
