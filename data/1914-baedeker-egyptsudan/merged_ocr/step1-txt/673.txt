Christianity established itself at Phila: in the 4th cent., and
thence extended throughout Nubia, where the temples were converted into churches. In 640 Al). Egypt and the Upper Nile Valley
fell into the hands of the Mohammedans.'Amr (p. cxiii) penetrated
as far as Dongola and imposed tribute upon Nubia, but no enduring
subjugation .of the country was effected. Shams ed-Dila, brother
of Saladin, took possession of the fortress of [ brim (p. 402) in 1173
and plundered the ehnrch-treasuryi hut Christianity yielded to
Islam very gradually. and a Christian kingdom lingered at Siba
on the Blue Nile (p. 432) until the middle ages. We know little
of the Mohammedan principalities established at Don, Dongola,
5mm, and other points in Nubia. In 1821 Isrni'il Pasha conquered the whole of Nubia for his father, Mohammed Ali, Pasha of

At Et-Gudhi the river bends to the SAW, afterwards returning
to its S. direction. The scenery becomes less wild, and a narrow
strip of verdure appears on each bank. - To the W. is the Gebel
Shcimet el- way. From time to time we observe ancient dykes of

in favour of Ptolemy Philometor and his consort Cleopatra. About
4?. ft. beyond a third doorway (now ruined) is the temple proper.
