to the S. of the Shin" Mohammed'Ali. In the Shari' el-Wlmtyeb,
on the left, is the Monastery of the hfevleds ('Derviehes tourneurs';
Pl. D, 6), an order of dancing dervishes (p. xcii), whose'zilrr'
(comp. p. xci) may be witnessed on Frid. afternoons at two o'clock
(previous application through a dragoman necessary). At the intersection of the Shtur Siytfiyeh and the Shirir es-elalibeh is the rich
and effective marble Sebtt of the Mother oCAbbts J. (Pl. D, 6). To
the left, in the Shtrir Shekhth (leading to the Place Saladin), is
the Gitrnir Shekhiut, built by the emir of that name (1350-55), and
opposite, on the S. side of the street, is the KhGliillt or Convent of
Shekhilh, occupied by dervishes of the Kadiriyeh Order (p. xcii). We continue to follow the Shtrit er-Rukbiyeh and turn down the
SHAW IBN Tmsfm to the right, in which, after about 100 yds. more,
we observe 011 the right a lane leading to the E. entrance of the
now disused and sadly neglected
'Namir Ibn Tuliin CPI. D, 7; also pronounced Tahln). This
mosque, the oldest in Cairo but one, was erected in 876-879 by
Ahmed ibn Tulan, the founder of the dynasty of the Tulunides
(p. cxiv). It lies in the quarter of Karat cl-Kabsh, on a hill named
Gebel Yeshk0r, and occupies an area of 30,720 sq. yds., 20,320
of which are taken up by the mosque proper. The edifice is said
to have been designed in imitation of the Kaaba at Mecca, but
without columns, by a Christian prisoner, who, in return for his
release, constructed the whole of the building of entirely new
materials (th not taken from other buildings). The walls consist
of brick, coated with stucco. The older part of the ornamentation,
which is in carved (not moulded) stucco and wood, exhibits none
of the intricate forms of the Byzantine-Arabian style, which appear
in the later restorations. At a later period the mosque was used
as a magazine and as an asylum for aged men, which explains the
addition visible in the N.W. liwan, below the minaret.

From the main entrance (P1. i, p.72) we pass through the E. outer
court to the Chief Ltwtn (PI. 4) or sanctuary, and thence proceed
to the inner quadrangle or Sal", 99 yds. square. With the
exception of the ceilings, most of which have been restored, the
building has been preserved almost intact, though its fitting up has
been frequently altered. The most important renovations were carried
out by Ligin, afterwards Sultan El-Nanylr. It was he who erected
the mausoleum-like Dome (Pl. (O in the centre of the court, covering
an octagonal basin, on the site of an older hall which was destroyed
by fire. The court is surrounded by a double arcade, except on the
sanctuary side, where the arcade is quadruple, while a fifth row
of arches collapsed in 1875. Pointed openings above the pillars
lighten the weight of the masonry, and the facades are crowned by
a medallion-frieze and open-work balustrades. The pillars are of
plastered brick and have their corners rounded into quarter columns, with delicately ornamented capitals. The pointed arches
