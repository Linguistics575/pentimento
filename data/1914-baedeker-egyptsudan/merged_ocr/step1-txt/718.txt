height, and are worked by zebus. Wooden posts are oeeasionally placed
beside these wheels in such a way as to form a kind of sun-dial, by which
the hours of labour are regulated. The chief crop is Andropiiiron Sorghum,
the staple food of the country, but sweet potatoes (Ipomaea Batatas; Arab.
hombai), Maize (recently introduced), and the Sudanese angar-caue (Andrap6gtm Zaccharatum; Arab. el-Unicom'") are cultivated also. The last-named
ripens between February and May.

Along the bank of the Nile runs the EMBANKMENT; a promenade
about 3 M. in length, planted with lebbakh and other trees. The view
hence is very fine; on the opposite bank, beyond the sand-banks
in the Nile, which are covered when the river is high (in October),
lies the desert-town of Orndurrnin, with misty hills in the background; to the N. rise the hills of Kerreri and St1rlcah (p. Mi);
also to the N. is the island of Tuti, with its vegetable-gardens. On
this island are a number of conical grass-huts inhabited by natives,
and an old fort which offered a desperate resistance to the dervishes in 1885.

Following the Embankment to the E. from the Grand-HÃ©tel we
pass the Coptic Church (P1. 2), with its two towers, and a number of
attractive villas, including those of the Mmlir, the Financial Secretary, and the Commandant (Pl. 4; D, 3). We next reach the Post
f Telegraph tWee (PL 5; D, 3) and the War (P1. B; D, 3),
considerably enlarged in 1913, with most of the offices of the civil
administration. Adjoining the latter rises the Gothic Palace of the
Birddr and Governor-General (Pl. D, 3); before it stand a British
sentinel (on the river side) and two Sudanese sentinels (on the S.
side). A special permit is needed for a visit to the house or grounds.
The palace incorporates the lower story of Gordon's house, in which
he fell under the lances of the dervishes (memorial tablet in the
corridor). -.q-. Farther on are military stores and the workshops of
the Public Works Department. The gardens and villas of the British
off1eials, including that of Slatin-Pasha (P1. 10; E, 3), add a picturesque feature to the scene, many of the houses being built in the
bungalow style. At the corner of Mohammad Ali Street is the
attractive building of the Sudan Club (PL E, 3), situated in a
garden. Farther on is the Military Hospital.

We then reach the Gordon Memorial College (Pl. E, F, 3;
director, Mr. James Currie), for which Lord Kitchener obtained the
necessary funds by public subscription throughout the British Empire.
This is a large and substantial building in which native youths are
trained by English and Egyptian teachers for an official career. The
College contains a Higher Elementary School, a Higher School for
Technical Education (surveying and engineering), a Training College for Schoolmasters and Cadis, and a Military Cadet School.
Associated with it are Instructional Workshops, an Economic Museum
(with interesting archaeological, ethnographical, and natural history
collections), and a Bacteriological' Chemical Laboratory (adm. 9-1),
the last due to the liberality of Mr. Henry S. Wellcome of London.
