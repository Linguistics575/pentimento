the conditions remain uniform day after day, and are, in short, so
generally the rule that'the weather' ceases to be a topic of conversation. If from the top of the hills or cliffs bordering the Nile valley
to the S. of Cairo he looks out on the boundless deserts on either
side, the visitor will realize at once that Egypt is practically a part
of the Sahara, a verdant strip of fertile soil, 8-12 M. wide, dependent for its existence upon the Nile; and that the refreshing purity
of the atmosphere is essentially due to the proximity of the desert.

Strictly speaking there are but two seasons (comp. p.1xxiii).
During the summer-months (May-Sept.) there prevails throughout
the whole of Egypt dry and hot weather, tempered by steady northerly
winds, but in the other half of the year, and especially in December,
January, and February, the storms of the Mediterranean exercise
so much effect on the Delta that comparatively cold weather, with
cloudy days, is sometimes experienced as far as Cairo and even up
to Benisueif. The temperature is sometimes high even in winter,
but the dryness of the air prevents it from being trying, while as
soon as the sun gets low the temperature falls so rapidly as to
necessitate precautions against a chill.

The mean maximum and minimum temperatures at some of the
more important points are given in the following table:

In spite of the essential dryness of the climate, the rapid fall
of temperature at night causes morning-fog to be common in the
Nile Valley in winter. It is, however, rapidly dissipated when the
sun rises, and the rapid drying of the air as the day advances is
shown in the following table.'
