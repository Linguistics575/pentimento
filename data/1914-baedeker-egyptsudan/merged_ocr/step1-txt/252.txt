They endeavour to excite compassion by invoking the aid of Allah:
Ive Mohamnin ya Rabb' ('0 awakener of pity, 0 Master');'gatib
min Alldh (talclt tulcmet'eish' ('I seek from my Lord the price of a
morsel of bread');'ana deif' Allah toa'n-nehi' ('l am the guest of
God and of the Prophet'). The usual answer of the passer-by is
"al AWW, or'Alldh ychannin ealeik' ('God will have mercy on thee'),
or'Alldh yae.ttk' ('God give thee'; comp. p. xxiv).

The Safclta, or water-carrier, with his goatskin of water, carried
either by himself or by a donkey, still plies his trade in Cairo



although the water- works supply every house in the city, as
well as the public sebils (p. clxxxii ], with water, and though on
many of the houses there are brass tubes through which passers-by
may take a draught from the main pipes. The Hemali also, who
belong to one of the orders of dervishes (p. xci), are engaged in
selling water, which they flavour with orange-blossom { min }, while
others use liquorice (eerljutts) or raisins (zebib). There are also
numerous itinerant vendors of fruit, vegetables, and sweetmeats,
which to Europeans usually look very uninviting. The Rammdl or
soothsayer, squatting by the side of the road, offers to tell the fortune
of the passer-by by consulting the sand. Lastly,. there are itinerant
Coulee (tabbakhin, sing. .tabbtfkh), with portable kitchens, who sell
small meat puddings, fish, and other comestibles.

Most of the Arabian Barbers have their shops open to the street.
Besides cutting the hair of their customers they may be seen shaving their heads, an art in which they are very expert.
