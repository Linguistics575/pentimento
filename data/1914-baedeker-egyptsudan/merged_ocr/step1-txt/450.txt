212 Route 15. TELL EL-'AMARNA. From Cairo

sprang up, beside the imposing royal abode arose the dwellings of
the nobles, and hardly tombs were prepared for the king and his
favourites in the hills to the east. But after the death of Amenophis
the ancient religion once more obtained the upper hand, the court
returned to Thebes, and the new town rapidly decayed. Its life
had not lasted for more than 50 years, and the site upon which it
stood was never again occupied. Owing to this circumstance the
ancient streets and ground-plans have remained to this day and
may be traced with little trouble (comp. below). The religious revolution under Amenophis IV. was accompanied by a revolution in
art. The artists who worked in his reign, probably feeling themselves more independent of ancient traditions, attempted to lend
their creations a more natural expression. In many cases, however,
they fell into exaggeration, as, for example, in the representations
of the lean form of the king. The tombs ofEl-'Amarna contain the
best examples of this realistic tendency and are, therefore, of great
importance in the history of art.

About 1/2 hr. to the N. of Et-Till are the ruins of the city and
of the Palace of Amencphis IV. Its tine stucco pavements, discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1891-92, were' ruthlessly destroyed in
1912 (fragments in the museum at Cairo, see p. 86). - To the E.
lay the Archives, in which in 1888 the celebrated clay tablets of
Tell el-'Amarna with cuneiform inscriptions were found (now in
the British Museum and the museums of Berlin and Cairo; comp.
p. 89); these are letters written to kings Amenophis III. and IV.
by Babylonian and other kings of W. Asia and by Syrian and Phenician vessels, and are of the greatest historical value. - The portion of the city that has, so far, been excavated by the German Orient
Society lies 11/2 M. to the N. of the office (p. Mt), where permission
to visit the excavations is obtained. If time permit, the traveller
should see the well-preserved House of the High Priest Pe-woh,
affording as it does a typical example of the ground-plan of an
upper-class Egyptian dwelling-house (comp. pp. cixi, clxii). He
may visit also the House of a Farm-EailW, where the laying-out of
the garden is still recognizable, the House of the Sculptor Thutmose,
with workmen's dwellings, and lastly a large granary. Some of the
houses have well-preserved bathrooms and lavatories.

From the palace we proceed to the NE, passing the site of the

Great Temple, and in 3/4 hr. we reach the North Group of Tombs.
The roek-tombs of Tell el-rAmarara are essentially the same in point
of structure as the tombs of the 18th Dyn. at Thebes (p. 309). Each is im.
mediately preceded by a Forecourt, which was generally surrounded by a
brick wall. Thence a wide door admits to the Main Chamber, the roof of
which is in many cases supported by columns. The Chamber containing
the statue of the deceased is next reached, either by another door, or by
a corridor which frequently leads first to a narrow anteroom. Many of
the tombs are unfinished, in consequence of the death of Amenophis IV,
and the subsequent return of the court to Thebes. - The tombs (in both
groups ] are marked with black numbers (1115), running from N. to s.
