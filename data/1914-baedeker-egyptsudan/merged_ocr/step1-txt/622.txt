temple-buildings, but also ranging over the plain through which
the Nile flows, with its verdant crops and its villages fringed with
palms and mimosas, framed by the desert-mountains in the distance.

The Birth House lies to the W. of the entrance to the great
temple of Horus. It was built by Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, while
the interior decorations date from Soter II. It is surrounded by a
colonnade, supported by pillars bearing figures of Bes (camp p. 250).

of Sethos f., lying 37 M. to the E., has been named (see p. 376). Farther along the E. bank (12 M. from Edfu), on the mountainslopes approaching close to the river near the hill Es-flirt/r, are
the picturesque remains of a late-Byzantine fortified town (perhaps the ancient Thmuis), with a church or convent. In the neighbourhood are ancient quarries with inscriptions (one of Thutmosis 1110. The nummulite limestone of the hills here gives place
