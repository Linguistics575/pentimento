present lake is Ill it. below sea-level. The ancient Lake Moeris thus left
uncovered only a narrow strip of fertile land on the s., known As the'Lake1am, on which stood the casket! Shem (CrocodiIOpolis, p. 192), protected
by embankment, against inungation. Several rulers of the 12th Dyn. established their camps on the E. argin of the Lake-land, and Amenernhiit m.
seems to have shown a t) /lialTSilldtie' for it. Teye, the wife of Amenophis m. (18th Dyn.), fixed her residence near 111ahiin. In the Greek period,
chiefly in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, the lake-area was reduced by
means of emhankments, until its total size approximated to that of the
modern Birket 1iam1n. Attempts were made to reclaim land for agricultural
purposes by mining the marshes; and the success that has attended these
efforts is attested by the fertile fields and prosperous villages that have occupied for twenty centuries the erstwhile site of Lake Natrig. Strabo describes the lake in the following terms:'Owing to its size and depth Lake
meris is capable of receiving the superabundance of water during the inundation without overflowing the habitations and crops", but later, when
the water subsides, and after the lake has given up its excess through the
same canal (tie. the Bal." Yasur), both it and the canal retain water enough
for purposes of irrigation. At both ends of the canal there are lock-gates
by means of which the engineers can regulate the influx and efflux of the
water.' The method by which the distribution of the excess water was
accomplished is unknown. Near the modern Illahiin there is a lock to
this day. - The statement of Herodotus that Lake Moeris was an artificial
construction thus rests upon an error and is moreover in direct contradiction tu Strahu's account. For the pyramid and statues mentioned
by Herodotus as standing in the lake, see p.193

The Faiyiim forms a separate province. The Inhabitants are fellahin,
or tillers of the soil, and Beduins. To the latter race belong the poor
ilshermcn who inhabit the banks of the Birket Harlin. - Comp.'The Topography and Geology of the Fayum Province of Egypt', by H. J. I. Beadnell

The narrow-gauge railway to the Faiytm1 runs towards the W.,
across cultivated land (with the pyramid of Meidtim on the plateau
to the right; p. 205), to the village of ktm Abu Rddi, beyond which
it traverses a desert tract and crosses the low and bleak Libyan
chain of hills, attaining its highest point at 190 ft. above the sea.
On reaching the cultivated districts of the Faiytsm the train crosses
the Abdalla Wahbi Canal. The pyramid of I) is seen
to the left. Beyond (151/2 M.) is seen
to the left. Beyond (151/0 MO Seileh (Seila, Siala) we cross the Baltr
Seileh el- Ged'id and the Baler el- Wihli or El-Bats Canal (p. 195; now
reclaimed for tillage). - Near (18% M.) Edweh (Edwah; 69 n.) is
a cemetery. In the distance is the pyramid of Illahtin (p.195),
nearer is that of Haw√©ra (p. 104). We traverse rich arable land.
