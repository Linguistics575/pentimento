Antiquities. Luxor is noted for its spurious antiquities. Many of the
articles offered for sale in the streets are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are sometimes in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller seldom or never secures an authentic specimen, a fact which is
very amusingly illustrated in T. G. WakelingU'Forged Egyptian Antiquities'
(London, 1912-, Travellers should never buy antiquities without
the advice of a connoisseur. Purchases should not be made in presence
of the dragomans, as these individuals, by tacit agreement, receive a
percentage from the dealers, which is, of course, added to the price.
Specimens may be obtained from Mohareb Todrus, the German consular
agent, or from the dealers Motammed Muhasseb,'Abd eI-Megid, 3fanstlr
Malnmad, R. de 2ttutafiaell, ete. Prices vary greatly; 11., or even more,
must be paid for a good scarabeeus with fine colour.

Distribution of Time. Travellers by the tourist-steamers are more or
less committed to the prescribed programme (comp. p. 203). Those who
are at liberty to arrange their time for themselves will find the following
programmes convenient. (For day-excursions the hotels provide their
guests with It1neh-haskets-, travellers staying at the Winter Palace, Lune,
and Karnak Hotels can obtain a coupon for 5pm. entitling them to
lunch at cook's Rest House, p. 299.)
