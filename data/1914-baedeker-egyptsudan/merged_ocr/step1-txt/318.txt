broad. Indeed there is scarcely a building in Egypt that has so
frequently been destroyed by water, fire, and earthquake, and that
has been so regularly rebuilt.

The interior exhibits the usual plan of a court surrounded hy
colonnades, and in spite of its imperfect state (the N. and S.
colonnades are represented by the column-bases only) its mere size
produces a certain effect. The columns, all of marble of various
kinds, were once 366 in number. Their heterogeneous nature is
accounted for by the fact that they were brought from Roman and
Byzantine buildings in Cairo.

The facades of the Court (Saint) have no pretensions to antiquity; the arches are, of an unusually clumsy shape. In the centre
of the court, which is now planted with trees, is a hanefiyeh; the
deep well is popularly believed to have a connection with a well
in Mecca. The South-Eastern Lturiin is the sanctuary. In front
of the pulpit, within an iron railing, is a column of grey marble,
011 which, by a freak of nature, the names of Allah, Mohammed,
and Sultan Suleiman in Arabic characters, and the outline of the
prophet's'kurbatsh' appear in veins of a lighter colour. This
column is believed by the Moslems to have been transported miraculously from Mecca to Cairo by the Caliph Omar. In the N.E.
corner is the tomb of Sheikh Abdallah, son of Amr. In the N.W.
corner is a recess with two low columns; the blood-stains on the
top are caused by patients in search of health, who here rub their
tongues until they bleed. In the w, colonnade, which consists of
a single row of columns only, is a Pair of Columns, placed very close
together, and it is said that none but honest men could squeeze
themselves between them.

This mosque is almost disused. On the last Friday in the month of
fasting, however, a solemn service is annually held here, in which the
Khedive and his grandees take part. 0n the remaining Fridays throughout
the year a handful of poor Moslems, mostly of the working classes, assemble
for worship in the venerable hut poorly preserved sanctuary. - In 1808
this mosque witnessed a very remarkable scene. The whole of the Mohammedan priesthood, the Christian clergy of every seat, and the Jewish
rabbis, with one accord, assembled in the mosque of Arm to pray for the
rise of the Nile, which had delayed beyond the usual period.

Near the Mosque of Ann are several Kulla Manufaclories, in
which the process of making the porous water-jars (Arabic Kalle,
pl. Ku'lal) used throughout Egypt may be seen. The chief seat of
manufacture is, however, Keneh (p. 222). The material is a lightgrey clay; the remarkably delicate porosity of the vessels is produced by mixing the clay with ashes. The rapid evaporation caused
by the porosity of the lolla cools the liquid within to a temperature of 12-140 Fahr. lower than that of the surrounding air. - To
