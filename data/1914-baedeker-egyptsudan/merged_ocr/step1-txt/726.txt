large railway bridge mentioned on p. 432. We now enter the region
of the'Blacks'; at many of the stations war-dances are performed for
the benefit of the tourists. The forests often come right down to the
river-banks, and hippopotami, crocodiles, gazelles, and innumerable
water-fowl may be seen. On the E. bank is the territory of the Dinka
negroes. - About 246 M. from Kharttun we see on the E. bank the
ridge of Gebelein (Jebelein,'the two mountains'), with a government rubber plantation. Here the sert1t fly is met with for the first
time; though not poisonous, it is very troublesome. - 4TH DAY.

the French under General Marchand from July 10th to Dee. 11th,
1808, but was then ceded to the British. It has an evil reputation
for malarial fever; the climate is sultry and damp and mosquitoes
abound. In the vicinity is the capital of the Shilluks and the residence of their Wek' (from melek, i. e. king), or hereditary headman.
The tomb of the first king Nyikong at Kodak is an object of great
veneration among the natives. - Tra DAY. 487 M. Lul, a station
