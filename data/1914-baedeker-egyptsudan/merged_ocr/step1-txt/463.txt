E. bank, lies Ey-Far, a distriet-eapital with 2844 inhabitants. Opposite, at Et-Matc'inyeh (p. 205), lie the pyramids of Lisht o. 205).

On the W. bank the mountains recede a little, but on the E. bank
their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend down to the river in

need be mentioned. On the E. bank stands the Coptie convent of
Deir 3Idr Antonios, from which a caravan-route leads to the Red Sea.

the river in unbroken walls or rounded blues. Few villages are
seen on this bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side,
10-12 M. in width, is thickly populated and carefully cultivated,
exhibiting in profusion all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date
palms, votton, and b'ugar-eane. The sugar-factories, most of which
haveEuropean managers, followeneh otherinrapid Succcsaion. They
are connected by the railway, and short branch-lines, used in harvest-time only, run from them to the plantations lying farther to
the W. Their lofty brick and iron chimneys impart a very modern
industrial air to the ancient land of the Pharaohs. Large barges
with sugar-eanes or with fellahin'factory-hands' are met on the
river. The juice is expressed from the cane and then refined by
being boiled twice in closed vessels.

The boat passes several large islands. On the W. bank lie Thtn'inha and Bibeh, the latter a railway station (p. 206). The belltower of the Coptic convent, surmounted by a cross, is visible from
afar. On a promontory of the E. bank, opposite Bibeh, is the tomb
