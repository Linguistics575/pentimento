native town, whose daughter he married. He was sent to
Egypt in 1800 as a captain in the contingent from Kavala
and so distinguished himself in action against the French
that Kusa-uf Pasha, the new governor, appointed him bimbashi (colonel) of a corps of Albanians in the contests between the Turks and the Mamelukes. In this p man Mohammed adopted the policy of apparent impartiality, while
he workedjin secret for the destruction of both parties.
When the Turkish governor was expelled Mohammed Ali
became pasha, with the approval of the Porte, and on
Aug. 3rd, 1805, he took possession of the citadel of Cairn
(p. 46). The British meanwhile had occupied Alexandria
and, Damietta, but Mohammed, allying himself with the
1lamelukes, inflicted two defeats upon them, in consequence
of which the British fleet withdrew in autumn, 1807. The
pasha next disembarrassed himself of his now inconvenient
allies by inviting the Mameluke beys to Cairo, where they,
with their followers (480 in all), were treacherously massacred in the citadel by Mohammed's Albanians, on March

Porte against the Wahabis (p. xci), who had taken possession ofArabia, was brought to a successful close in 1810

Wahabis was suppressed in 1819 by Mohammed's adoptive son Ibrahim Paiha, a military genius of the first order.

Mohammed now turned his attention to military reforms. He

employed his lawless Albanians in Nubia and the Stodin
(whereihis son Ismiril perished, p. 422) and created a home
army of fellahin, which showed its prowess in 1824-27,
under Ibrahim, in helping the sultanIin the Creek war of
independence, until the Turkish-Egyptian fleet was armihilated at the battle of Navarino (15271

To increase the strength and resources of Egypt Mohammed

energetically encouraged agricultural improvements and
introduced various manufacturing industries (comp. p. lxv).
After the Russian victories over Turkey in 1828-29 he decided that the moment had come to free himself from the
suzerainty of the Porte. At the beginning of 1832 Ibrahim
