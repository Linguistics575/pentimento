The EXCURSION TO THEPYMAMHIS OP Anvgiu, to the S. of Gizeh,
is interesting. We take the electric tramway to the Men House Hotel
(p. 123) and proceed thence in IU-o, hrs. on a donkey (there and
back 10 pies), on a camel, or in a desert-carriage (we p.139 } Or a,
donkey may be taken direct from Cairo in 2% hrs., vit the villages,
of Gizeh, Tirsa, and Shobrement; or the excursion may be combined g
with that to Sakhara (p. 142; comp. Plan, p. 143).,

Quitting the Menu House Hotel we ride along the verge of the,
cultivated country, with several villages. After about 1 hr. we have 1
the large cemetery of the village of Zdwiyet Alia Musatlim on our,
right. A low mound of rubbish on the summit of the desert-plateau
marks the site of the stone pyramid of Zdwiyet el-'Ary6m. In the
desert, about 3/4 M. to the N.W., lies a second and Unfinished Pyramid, known as'Slzugl fskenrler', which seems to have been begun
by King Nebka L3H } Dyn.). This has been excavated by Barsanti,
and plainly shows the sloping passage cut in the rock and leading
to a large square shaft, in which the tomb-ohamber was to have been
made. The foundation and pavement of the last were completed

sarcophagus of the king, which was to have been half- embedded
in the pavement. - In 1% hr. we reach the rubbish heaps of Abu
Gurhb. [ Another, somewhat longer route leads via the village of

E. side, while in the posterior (W.) and main part of it rose the large
Obelisk of the Sun. From the entrance-gate a (once) covered passage, ornamented with fine reliefs, led to the left along the E. and S. sides of the
