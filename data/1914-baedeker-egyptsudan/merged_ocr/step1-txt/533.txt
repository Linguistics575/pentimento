In the adjoining Central Court we come Mst upon an Obelisk,
the last survivor of four erected in pairs by Thutmosis I. and
Thutmosis Ill. It is 751/2 ft. high and stands upon a base 6 ft.
square. On each face of the obelisk are three vertical inscriptions,
the central one being the dedicatory inscription of Thutmosis I.
and the other two additions by Ramses IV. and Ramses VI. The
bases of the three other obelisks are adjacent. The obelisks of Thutmosis I. marked the entrance to the temple in his reign.

Next follows Pylon IV, in a most ruinous condition. (According
to the inscriptions in relief the door was restored by Alexander the
Great.) Beyond it are the scanty remains of a -'-N

Colonnade, originally embellished with columns and with niches
containing colossal statues of Osiris (with arms crossed and the
symbol for'life' in each hand). Within this colonnade rose the two
great Obelisks of Queen Hatshepsut, made of fine pink granite from
Assuin and covered at the apex with electrum (a mixture of gold
and silver). The right obelisk has been overthrown and broken;
long inscriptions on the base celebrate the power of the queen. The
left *Obelisk, still standing, is 97 ft. high and its diameter at the
base is 81/2 ft.; it is the tallest ancient obelisk known, with the
exception of the Lateran Obelisk (in Rome), which is 105 ft. high.
On each of the four sides is a single vertical inscription recording
the dedication of the obelisks and the fact that they were made in
7 months. On the upper parts are reliefs, showing Hatshepsut,
Thutmosis L, and Thutmosis III. sacrificing to Amen. The names
and figures of Amen Were obliterated by Amenophis IV., but
restored by Sethos I. By the wall to the left is a granite statue
of Thutmosis m., kneeling and holding an altar in front of him.

This Colonnade underwent various transformations under the 18th Dynasty. When Thutmosis L built it originally it had a wooden roof borne
by wooden columns, afterwards replaced by stone ones, of which three
bases are still in aim. The two ohclisks were erected by Hatshepsut
to celebrate the 16th year of her reign. Thutmosis m. afterwards surrounded the obelisk: with a sandstone structure which concealed them
to a height of about 82 ft., portions of which still remain. The colonnade Was transformed by receiving a stone roof supported by two rows
or payyruercolnmns (six on the N. side, eight on the S.). The five old
columns were, however, retained. Niches were formed in the walls and
filled with statues of Thutmosis I., removed from the great court (p. 2510.
The decoration of the S. part was not concluded until the reign of
Amenophis It.

Through the Fifth Pylon, also erected by Thutmosis I., we reach
two small Antechambers, inserted by Thutmosis III. in front of the
sixth pylon, and now in a state of ruin. To the right and left of
these are two larger courts adorned with colonnades of sixteen-sided
columns and statues of Osiris. These form the last remnant of the
great court ofThutmosis L, which once surrounded the temple of' the
Middle Empire. In the passage leading to the N. court is a colossal
seated figure of Amenophis IL, in red granite. - The Sixth Pylon,
the last and smallest of all, an erection ofThutmosis m., is now in
