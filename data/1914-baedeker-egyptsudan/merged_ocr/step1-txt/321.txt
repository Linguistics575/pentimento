of Cairo. TOMBS OF THE CALIPIIS. 5. Route. 111

lem burial-ground and at a short distance in front of us the old
aqueduct (p. 116). A little to the right, on an eminence, rises an
old ruined mosque (G & mi' Abu Srs'ad), beyond it is the Citadel
with the mosque of Mohammed Ali, and farther distant are the
Mokattam Hills with the mosque of 6iytoshi (p. 116). This view is
very striking towards sunset. The road, which becomes bad farther
on, leads round the ruined mosque and ascends heaps of du'bris.
On the top of the hill it divides. The branch to the left leads hack
to the town. The road, first in a straight direction, afterwards inclining to the right, leads to the mosque of Irmtrn Shifi'i (p. 115).

2. The Tombs of the Caliphs and the Mamelukes.

The general effect is most striking towards sunset. The enjoyment of the
scenery is, however, greatly impaired by the dustiness ot the roads.

The mediaeval Arab mausolea of Egyptian rulers, which, under
the names Tomb, of the Caliphs and Tombs of the Mamelukes, stretch
along the entire E. side of the city, were erected mainly by the
Circassian Mameluke sultans. The name'Tombs of the Caliphs',
applied to the northernmost group, is historically a misnomer, for
the tombs have no connection with the Abbaside caliphs then resident in Egypt and treated as mere titled puppets. These mosquetombs were once each provided with a numerous staff of sheikhs
and attendants. The revenues of the mosques having been confiseated at the beginning of the 19th century, the tombs gradually
fell to ruin. Now, however, the Committee mentioned at p. 43 has
taken them into its keeping.

The usual route to the *Tombs of the Caliphs (Arab. Turab
el-Kluilafa or Turab Iitfit Bey) leaves the city via the Muski o. 53)
and its prolongations. It then traverses the mounds of potsherds
known as the Windmill Hills (p. 114) and reaches the still-used
cemetery iturtrtet el-gift/O, By the roadside lie large mausolea
(Arab. Hash), with courts and rooms occupied during certain festivals by the relatives of the deceased. We first reach the tombmos que of Cait Bey, to the N. of which is that of Bark.illi. Hence
we return to the city by one of the routes described below.

Those who wish to combine a visit to the Citadel (p..68) with
that to the Tombs of the Caliphs should select the route from the
Bib el-Attsiba (Pl. F, 5) to the Wit Bey Mosque (comp. p. 114).

It is, however, more convenient to begin with the N. group of
tombs. In this case we quit Cairo by the Btrl, en-Nay (Pl. E, 2;
p. 77) and pass the Mohammedan cemetery. To the right are the
Windmill Hills (p.114). Beyond the unimportant tomb of Shaikh
(r" ahit we have one of the finest *Views of the city of the dead.

The N.E. group of the mausolea, which is hardly worth visiting,
consists of the Tomb of an Emir ofSultan EI-G/shi (p. 59), a cube
