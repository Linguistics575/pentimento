blocks of stone and in plan resembles the two other gates of the
Fatimite period, theBab el-hhlttilt and the Bib en-Nasr (p. 77 ]. It was
erected at the end of the 11th cent. by Week builders from Edessa.
The S. side consists of two huge towers, surmounted by the elegant
minaret: of the Muaiyad Mosque. On the tower to the W. are a
number of stone and wooden balls, probably dating from the Mameluke period. roman Bey, the last of the Circassian sultans of Egypt,
was hanged on this tower by Sultan Selim 1., on April 15th, 1517
(p. 45). This gate is called also Bab et-Metwalli, from the old
tradition that the most highly revered saint lfutb el-Metwalli
(Mutawalli) has his abode behind the W. half ofthe gate, where he
sometimes makes his presence known by a gleam of light. On both
wings of the gate hang shreds of clothing, teeth, and other votive
offerings, placed here by sufferers in hope of cure. Opposite the
outside of the gate is the sebil of Sultan Fang, by the large grated
window of which executions by strangulation took place down to
the middle of the 19th century.

From the Zuweileh Gate the DERB EL-Antmn (P1. E, 4) leads
towards the E. About 200 yds. from the gate is (No. 36) the restored
*Mosque of the Emir Kijmas eI-Ishaigi, a small but handsome
building, erected in M81 in the style of 193% Bey. The mausoleum
which is large in proportion to the mosque, long remained empty,
as Emir Kijmas el-Tshirt, master of the horse to Bey, died
and was buried in Syria. In 1851, however, the pious Sheikh Abu
Hnreiba was interred here.

In the same street, farther on named Sairurrvv-TArusiNmr (Pi. E,
4, 5), lies the *rardini Mosque (( himi' cl-Marddni), one of the
largest in Cairo, built in 1338-40 by Emir Altuu Bogha el-Mirdstni,
tsup-bearer of Sultan Mohammed en-b% .sir. The building was in a
thoroughly ruinous condition in the 19th cent, buthas recently been
restored by Herz-Pasha. - The nearly square court is surrounded
by oolonnades. The prayer-niche and the walls on each side of it are
covered with costly mosaics. The new concrete dome in front of the
prayer-niche is borne by superb ancient Egyptian granite columns.
The side-colonnades also contain some ancient columns, probably
from a temple of the period of the Ptolemies. The sanctuary, or
main hall, is separated from the court by an ancient wooden railing,
much of which has had to be renewed. The 1Janefiyeh in the court
formerly stood in the mosque of Sultan Hasan and here occupies
the site of the original fountain. - The SHRRI' B313 EL-Wszin. goes
on to the gate of that name and to the Citadel o. 68). About half-.
way it passes the picturesque GAMI' Aysrrss.con or (7thnir Ibrahim
Agha (P1. E, 5), known also as Et-Asralc, or'the blue', from the rich
blue tiles on the walls. Built in 1346 by the Emir Aksunhor,
this mosque was restored in 1651 by Ibrahim Agha and again in
modern times.
