ly delined. Every Moslem is permitted to have four wives at a time,
though inouogauly is the rule, owing to economic conditions. A woman
has full rights under the law of property, but under the law of succession and as a witness she is regarded as equivalent only to half a man.
The practice of veiling women, usual in the higher circles, is a matter

divorce is a grave moral danger; in Mecca, for example, prostitution exists
under the form of marriage. Further details as to Islamie law may be
found in the'Handbueh des islan sehen Gesetzes', by Th. W. Juynholl ot
Leyden (Leipzig, 1908-10; 9 marks), a work adapted for the layman as
well as for the legal expert.

Dogma by no means plays such an important part in Islam as in
Christianity; for the simple Moslem creed is embodied in the words:
'There is no God but God (Allah) and Mohammed is the prophet
of God'. But all the same lively controversies over dogma have not
been absent in the development of Islam, mainly owing to the int1uenee of (haco-Christian modes of thought. Just as in the sphere
of law, we find here a literal and a speculative interpretation; and
in the sphere of dogma also orthodoxy triumphed by adopting the
speculative method in a modified form. The process of amalgamation is generally associated with the name of El-Ash'ari (d. 935).
The questions most eagerly canvassed were those relating to the freedom of the will, the attributes of God, and the nature of the Koran
(is. whether it is'eternal' or'created'). The orthodox solutions of
these problems are roughly as follows. There is but one'God, in
whom certain universal attributes inhere (knowledge, seeing, hearing, etc.), but who must not be conceived of under a human form.
He is all-mighty and has therefore created also evil, which serves
his purposes of salvation in a manner inconceivable by our limited
human intelligence. Above all, God is the Creator, who at every
moment re-creates all things. Causality is merely the creative operation of the divine will. In this connection man is not free, for everything is immutably foreordained by God's will. God operates every
