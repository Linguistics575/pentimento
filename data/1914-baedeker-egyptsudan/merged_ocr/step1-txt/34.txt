1. PRELIMINARY INFORMATION. JO. Arabic

C10). The Egyptian Dialect of Arabic.
By Dr. Curt Priifer.

The Tl-sts-vs- of Arabic vocal sounds, so intensely different
from our own, in the ordinary Latin alphabet is rendered additionally
difficult by the varied international relations of Egypt. In maps and plans,
in railway time-tables, and in other publications we find the transliteration
ditferine widely according as the French or the English view has been
adopted. In this Handbook we have transliterated the consonantal sounds
so far as possible according to English usage (e.g., an instead of the French
ch). The pronunciation of the vowels and diphthongs is as follows: a as a
in father, a usually as a in final; eh at
the end of a word as a in final; i as u in been, i as i in did, final i as u
in been; a as a in bone, a as o in on; a as ea in fool, u as u in full; at
as i in ice; an as aw in owl; ei as a in lane; oi as oy in boy. Thus:
emir, which is pronounced'emeer'; jams, pronounced'fu11oos'; Shaikh,
pronounced'shake' (with a guttural k), etc. - That of the article is
frequently unassilnilated; e.g. el-rais instead of er-rds (camp. p. xxx).

Arabic belongs to the Semitic group of languages and has no
relationship with the tongues of Europe. The classic language of
the Koran is still regarded as the unrivalled model ofliteraryArabie,
but side by side with it there have developed various colloquial
dialects, differing widely among themselves, of which that spoken
in Egypt is one. In the following brief sketch references to the
classic literary language are avoided as far as possible; for that, recourse must be had to the accepted grammars (see p. clxxxviii).
Even in Egypt there are variations in the dialects spoken, but
the following remarks apply especially to the language as spoken
in Cairo, which is generally understood throughout the country.

On p. xxix we give the Arabic Alphabet, with the sounds
corresponding to the different letters so far as it is possible to represent or describe them to the English reader. - Arab writing
runs from right to left. Long vowels are indicated by the letters
Elit', Wan, and Yei (comp. p. xxix), while short vowels are often
left out altogether or represented by special signs placed above or
below the consonants.

QUANTITY AND ACCENTUATION Of? VOWELS. Vowels with a eir1.mmflex accent e) are long; other vowels are short. The accent
falls on the last syllable when that contains a long vowel or a short
vowel followed by two consonants. It falls on the penultimate (f)
when that is long, (A) when it ends in a single consonant, and (N
when the preceding syllable is long or ends in a single consonant.
In all other cases the accent falls on the antepenultimate. Diphthongs (at, ei, an) must be reckoned as equivalent to long vowels.

The pronunciation of short vowels varies considerably according to the
consonants adjoining as well as according to the culture of the speakers;

e y. for imta (when). emteh also occurs, for yiktu6 the writes). what, (or
'm'rhm maids), ratu? seh.
