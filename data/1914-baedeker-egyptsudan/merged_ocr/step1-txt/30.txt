later, 6 Pun. (except in Jam), and S p.111. in March; and latest of
all at Assuin, - it being always understood that precautions as to
extra clothing have been taken. - Those who are not invalids, and in
some cases invalids also, may sleep with the windows open with safety.

Those who wish to take a small Medicine Chest with them, a proeeeding strongly recommended to anyone making long independent excursions, should consult their physician at home as to the best medicaments with which to stock it. The following suggestions may, however,
be useful: for fever, Quinine in pills or something of that nature; for diarrhea (0r dysentery), first an aperient then Bismuth (in cachets); for inflammation of the eyes, an Eye Lotion
(made from a doutor's prescription) and a glass for dropping it in; for
stings, Ammonia; for external injuries, Cotton Wool for bandaging, Sublimate Pastilles and Iodoform as disinfectants, and Collodion.

(O Intercourse with Orientals. Dragomans.

The average Oriental regards the European traveller as a Croesus,
therefore as fair game, and feels Justified in pressing upon him with
a perpetual demand for bakshish (balsshish), which simply means
'a gift'. The number of beggars is enormous, but they are not
nearly so importunate as those in Italy and elsewhere. Travellers
are often tempted to give for the sake of affording temporary pleasure
at a triiliug cost, forgetting that the seeds of insatiable cupidity are
thereby sown, to the infinite annoyance of their successors and the
demoralization of the recipients themselves. Bakshish should never
be given except for services rendered, or to the aged and crippled;
and the Government appeals to the tourist by public placards not
to encourage the habit of begging. A beggar may be silenced with
the words "at Allah or Allah yeliannin'aleik [ God have mercy on
thee "or Allah Irf.ttk (may God give theel). The best reply for
more importunate cases is mt fish, ma fish (I have nothing for you)
or mdttsh balcshfsh [ there is no present), which will generally have
the effect of dispersing the assailants for a time.

It is, ofeourse, inevitable that coachmen, guides, donkey-boys,
and the like should expect a gratuity in addition to the stipulated
fee for their services, and the traveller should therefore take care to
be amply supplied with small CHANGE at all times, and especially
with pieces of half a piastre (comp. pp. xv, 37). Payment should
never be made until the service stipulated for has been rendered,
after which an absolutely deaf ear should he turned to the protestations and entreaties which almost invariably follow. Even when
an express bargain has been made, and more than the stipulated
sum paid, they are almost sure to pester the traveller in the way
indicated. When no bargain has been made, the fees and prices
mentioned in the Handbook, all of which are ample, should be paid
without remark; and if the attacks Which ensue are not silenced by
an air of calm indifference the traveller may use the word nth or
imshi (be off!) or uskut (be quiet!) in a quiet but decided and im-.
