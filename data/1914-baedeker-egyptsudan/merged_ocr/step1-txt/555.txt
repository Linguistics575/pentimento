"No, II. Tomb of Ramses III.
(lighted). This imposing tomb, us
ally called'Brueds Tomb' (after its
discovered) or'The Harper's Tomb',
is inferior in size to Nos. 17 and 14
only. The execution of the sculptures is not the best, but their variety
is exceptional. This tomb possesses
a unique peculiarity in the ten sidechambers, opening off the first two
corridors. The tomb was begun and
finished as far as Room 111 by Sethnakht, father of Ramses 111.; his cartouches are still to be seen at various
places where the later stucco has
fallen off.

The entrance is approached by
the usual flight of steps with an inclined plane in the middle; on each
side of it are two pilasters adorned
with cows' heads. On the lintel of
the door is the usual representation
of Isis and Nephthys worshipping
the sun-disk, in which are a scarabteus and the ram-headed sun-god.

CORRIDOR 1. To the right and
left of the entrance are kneeling
figures of the goddess of truth,
sheltering those who enter with her
wings. On the Left Wall is the king
before 1larakhie, followed by the
title of the'praising of Ire', the sun
between a serpent, a crocodile, and
two gazetles' heads. Then follows
the text of the'praising of RE,
which is continued on the Right
Wall. - SIDE CHAMBER. 1 (to the
