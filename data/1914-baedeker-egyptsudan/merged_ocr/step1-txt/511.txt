A. THE EAST BANK AT THEBES.

L The Temple of Luxor.

The main entrance to the temple by the great pylon (p. 258) is now
closed. We therefore leave the pylon to the last and proceed from the
road on the bank of the river to the court of Amenophis III. (p. 260),
whence we visit the older parts of the sanctuary CHA; pp. 260, 261). We
then return to the court and proceed through the colonnade (p. 259) to
the court of Ramses 11. (p. 959). Admission-tickets (p. 200) must not be
forgotten, In the following description, however, the pylon is mentioned

To the S. of the town and close to the bank ofthe Nile rises
the imposing
*Temple of Luxor (Pl. A, B, 3, 4), which still contains the little
mosque of Abil [ lagging within its N. part. The temple was built
by Amenophis 111. (18th Dym; p. cii) on the site of an older
sanctuary of sandstone, and was dedicated to Amen, his wife or
daughter Mat, and their son, the moon-god Khons. Like all
Egyptian temples, it included the sanctuaries with their adjoining rooms, a large hypostyle hall, and an open peristyle court. The
last was to have been preceded by a large hypostyle hall with several aisles, but only the central rows of columns had been erected
at the death of the king. The temple was then 208 yds. in length,
while its greatest breadth was 60 yds. Opposite the temple was a
granite chapel, erected by Thutmosis 111. During the religious revolution under Amenophis IV. (comp. p. 255) the representations and
name of Amen were obliterated, and a sanctuary of the'Sun' was
built beside the temple. Tut-enkh-Amun (p. cii) transferred the
royal residence back to Thebes, and caused the 1uifinished great
hypostyle hall to be hastily completed and the walls to be decorated
with reliefs (p. 260), in which Ilaremheb afterwards substituted
his own name for that of his predecessor. The'Temple of the Sun'
was destroyed, and in the reign of Sethos the figures of Amen
were restored. Ramses IL, the greatest builder among the Pharaohs,
could not refrain from adding to the temple at Luxor. He added a
large colonnaded court in front of the completed temple; he'usurped'
the ancient chapel of Thutmosis III. and replaced the old reliefs
with new ones; and he erected a massive pylon, the entrance of
which was formed next the chapel of Thutmosis, so that the longer
axis of the main temple was altered. The total length of the temple
was now 284 yds. Later centuries brought few alterations to the
temple of Luxor. After the introduction of Christianity it was converted into a church. A modern wall on the side next the river
protects it against damage from inundation,
