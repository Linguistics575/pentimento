IV. MODERN HISTORY.

pearanee before Alexandria. In the middle of June serious
disturbances broke out in that town, in the course ofwhich
many Europeans were killed, while the others found refuge on board the ships. On July 11th and 12th Alexandria
was bombarded by the British fleet, and on Sept. 13th
the fortified camp of Arabi at Tell el-Rem o. 181) was
stormed by a British force under Sir Garnet Wolseley.
Arabi and his associates were captured and sent as exiles to
Ceylon. Since then British influence has been paramount
in Egypt. Arabi, who had been released and pensioned
in 1901, died at Cairo in 1911.

In 1883 Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer) be
came British diplomatic agent and eosul-general in
Egypt. In his hands lay the control of British policy in that
country and he has won high distinction as one of the
makers of modern Egypt. In the autumn of the same
year a widespread rebellion broke out among the Nubian
tribes of the St1din under the leadership of Mohammed
Ahmed, the su-called'Mahdi' o. sci), which proved fatal
to the Egyptian supremacy in the bidin. An Egyptian
force of 10,000 men under an Englishman named Hicks
Pasha was annihilated in Nov., 1883, by the Mahdi's forces (comp. p. 433), and a second expedition of 3500 regular troops of the Egyptian army, led by Baker Pasha,
was likewise vanquished at Tokar in February, 1884. On
the 18th of the same month General Gordon, who had
been Governor General of the Shilin in 1877-79, after a
perilous ride across the desert, entered Khartjim, which
he had undertaken to save from the Mahdi; while on
Jan. 29th and March 13th the rebels under the Mahdi's
lieutenant Osman Digna were defeated at Et-Teb and
Tarn/fi by the British under Graham. The Mahdi himself, however, still maintained his position near Ifharttlm,
and towards the closed the year a second British expedition (of 7000 men) was sent out under Wolseley to
rescue Gordon.

Wolseley selected the tedious and laborious Nile route for
this expedition in preference to the shorter but more dangerous desert route from Suikin to Berber. An advanced
brigade under General Stewart was, however, sent on from
Korti at the beginning of 1885, which accomplished its
march across the Bayada Desert with complete success,
gaining severely contested victories over large bodies
of the Mahdi's followers at Abu Klea (Jan. 17th) and at
Abu Ithrik, near Metemmeh (Jan. filth). Stewart, however, was mortallywounded at the latter engagement. The
British reached the Nile at Gubat, just above Metem
