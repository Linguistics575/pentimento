The dress ol' the Egyptian peasant calls for little remark, eshecially as he usually works in the fields divested of everything except
a scanty apron. The chief articles of his wardrobe at other times
are an indigo-dyed cotton shirt (lcamis), a pair of short and wide cotton
breeches, a kind of cloak of brown, home-spun goats' wool ('abc'tyeh),
or simply a blanket of sheep's wool (himm), and lastly a closefitting felt skull-cap (libdehi He is generally barefooted, but oceasionnlly wears pointed red (markttb) or broad yellow shoes (balghd).
The sheikhs and wealthier peasants wear wide, black woollen cloaks
and the thick red'Tunisian' fez (turbzish) with a blue silk tassel,
round which they coil a turban ('imma; usually white). They USUally carry a long and thick stick (n√©bat), made of ash imported from
Uaramania. All watchmen carry similar sticks as a badge of office.

The sole wealth of Egypt is derived from its agriculture, and to
the fellahiu alone is committed the important task of tilling the soil.
They are, indeed, neither fitted not inclined for other work, a circumstance which proves how completely the settled character of the
ancient Egyptians has predominated over the restless Arabian blood,
which has been largely infused into the native population ever since
the valley of the Nile was conquered by the armies of Islim. The
ancient Egyptian racial type has been preserved in extraordinary
purity in many fellah families, especially in Upper Egypt. This is
particularly evident in the case of the children and women, whose
features are not concealed and distorted by veils (which the ancient
Egyptians despised). Even among the Nubians (p. Is), between.

to think that some of the pictures "the period of the ohl Pharaohs
had come to life and stood before us in ilesh and blood. In Lower
Egypt, and especially in the Delta, the Semitic type has sometimes
prevailed over the African in consequence of the steady stream of
Arab immigration that has now been flowing for more than athousand
years. The modern Egyptians, moreover, resemble the ancient in
character and in the lot to whiuh they are condemned. In ancient
times the fellah, pressed into the service of the priests and the
princes, was compelled to yield up to them the fruits of his toil,
and his position is nearly the same at the present day, save that the
names of his masters are changed, and he has obtained some relief
owing to the almost entire abolition of compulsory work.

In early life the Egyptian peasant is remarkably docile, active,
and intelligent, but at a later period this freshness and buoyancy are
crushed out of him by care and poverty and his never-ceasing task
of tilling the pitcher of the Danaides. lle ploughs and maps, tails

him. His character, therefore, becomes like that ofa gifted child.
