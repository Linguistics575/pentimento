Outer Temple Court. PHIL/E. 24. 1mm, 365

(1151 A.D.), the priests of these tribes were permitted to offer sacrifice, to
Isis along with the Egyptian priests, and also obtained the right of removing the miraculous image of the mighty goddess from the island at
certain solemn festivals and of retaining it for some time. Even after all
Egypt had long been Christianized the ancient Isis-worship still held
sway in Nubia. In spite of the Edicts of Theodosius the temples of
l'hilse were not closed until the reign of Justinian (597-565), when some
of their chambers were used for Christian services. After the conquest of
Egypt by the Arabs Philae embraced Islam, but in the meantime a Coptic
town had been established on the island.

The island, which formerly ranked, with its stately temples and
rich vegetation, as one of the most beautiful points in Egypt, has
lost much of its charm since the construction of the Nile Dam. It
is only between Aug. and Vee., when the water of the Nile is allowed to flow freely through the gates of the dam and the surface
of the water regains about the same level it had before the construction of the barrier, that the whole island stands above water,
so that access may be obtained to all the temples. Formerly, during
the rest of the year also, certain portions of the ruins were accessible
(partly by boat), but since the raising of the dam (camp. p. 371)
this is no longer the case. Elaborate operations on Philae have
taken place to preserve the temples as far as possible from injury
during their annual submergence.

The traveller should visit the various points in the following order,
without lingering too long over any ofthem, if his time be limited. It is
better to obtain a good general impression from the whole than to examine
the details minutely.

At the S.W. end of the island lies the extensive Outer Temple
Court, which is bounded on the N. by the first pylon of the Temple
of Isis, en the S. by the Vestibule of Nektarusb6s, and on the E.
and W. by colonnades. This court dates from the 1atty-Pto1Brnaie,
period or from the reign of Augustus. Attention should be paid
to the remains of the strong Quay Wall that perhaps was carried
round the greater part of the island, with flights of stone steps at
various points.

The VESTIBULE or NBKTAxnhes was built by Nektanebés as the
vestibule for a temple, dedicated to'his mother Isis, revered at Abaton, mistress of Philae, and to the liathor of Senmet' (p. 370). The
temple was swept away by the floods of the Nile very shortly after its
completion; but Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the vestibule to be
thoroughly restored. The elegant little structure was supported by
id columns with varying floral capitals, above each of which was a
second sistrum-capital. Only six of the columns are now standing,
and the roof has disappeared. Between the columns were stone
screens, over 6 ft. in height, crowned with concave cornices and
rows of Uracus-serpents, and interrupted on the E., W., and N. by
exit-doors. These screens bore reliefs showing King Nektaneb6s
sacrifleing to the gods.

Before the river-front of the temple two 0betisks upon chest-shaped
bases were erected in the Ptolemaic period. These were made of sand
