Mohammedan Calendar. Festivals.

The Mohammedan era begins with July 16th of the year 622 AIL, being the day of Muhammed's so-callcd flight (Hegfra) from Mecca to Medina (p. lxxxiv). The Mohammedan year is purely lunar and has no reference or relation to the sun; it contains 35-1 days, or 355 in leap-rears,
eleven of which occur in each cycle of 30 years. There are 12 months,
the first, third, etc., of which have 20 days each, the second, fourth, etc.,
30 days. Their names are given at p, xxxi t

In order approximately to convert a year of our era into one of the
Moslem era, subtract W2, divide the remainder by 33, and add the quotient
to the dividend; or, subtract 622. multiply the result by 1.0307 and add
0.46. Conversely, a year of the Mohammedan era is converted into one of
the Christian era by dividing it by 33, subtracting the quotient from it,
and adding 623 to the remainder. Or, multiply the Mohammedan year
by 21171, divide the result by 100, subtract the quotient from the Mohammedan year, and add 621.569. On Nov. 29th, 1913, began the Moslem
year 1332.

The Gregorian calendar was introduced into Egypt in 1875, but is
observed by government in the finance department only For all other
purposes the Mohammedan calendar is used, and the dates even of fixed
festivais cannot easily be stated according to the European computation
of time. Calendars reducing the Mohammedan and Coptic reckoning of
time to the European system may. however, be obtained at any bookseller%
The Almanac issued yearly by the Government Publications Offlee in
Cairn may be recommended (price c, pias.P, it contains a number of other
useful details.

Religious Festivals. The first month of the Arabian year is the
MOIIIARREM, the first ten days of which ('ashar), and particularly the 10th
(yam rarmm), are considered holy, On these days alms are distributed
and amulets purchased. Mothers, even of the upper classes, carry their
children on their shoulders, or cause them to be carried, through the
streets, and sew into the children's caps the copper coins presented to
them by passers-by. On the 10th 31olyarrem, the highly revered'Ashm-a
day, on which Adam and Eve are said first to have met after their expulsion from Paradise, on which Noah is said to have left the ark, and on
which l.losein, the grandson of the Prophet, fell as a martyr to his religion
at the battle of Rerbeli, the Camir seiyidna'l-iJ0sein mm; is visited
about 8 p.m. by a vast concourse of noisy religious devotees. Troops of Persians in tong white robes parade the streets, cutting themselves with swords
in the forehead until the blood streams down and Mains their snowy garments. Two boys, representing time and IJosein, are led through the
streets on horseback, with blood-stained clothes.

At the end of SAME, the second month, or at the beginning of Rabir
el-Aum't. the third, the Jfecea Caravan (p. lxxxviii) returns home. Its approach
is heralded by outriders and some enthusiasts advance three days to meet it.
Detached groups of pilgrims occasionally return before the rest of the oval,
cade, and their arrival is always signalized by the blowing of trumpets and
heating of drums. A pyramidal wooden erection, called the Mabmal, hung
with beautifully embroidered sums, and carried by a camel, accompanies
the procession as e symbol of royalty. The interior of the Mahala ] is
empty and to the outside of it are attached two copies of the Koran. The
procession usually enters the city by the Bah enthgrUJ. 77). In 11/242 hrs.
it reaches the Place Saladin o, 68), the large open space in front of the
citadel, from which last twelve cannon-shots are tired as a salute. The
cort√©ge flnorlly enters the citadel through the Bath el-Wezir. The departure
of the pilgrims is attended with similar ceremonies (comp. p. xcvi).

The great festival of the Malia! en-Nebi, the birthday of the prophet,
is celebrated at the beginning of Rasttr EL-AUWIL, the third month The
preparations for it begin on the second day of the month, and the most
important ceremonies take place on the evening of the eleventh. The
