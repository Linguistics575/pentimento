A door in the Osiris Chapel leads to a series of chambers dedicated to
the special rites in honour of Osiris. We first enter the Western Hail,
the roof of which was supported by ten columns (without capitals). To
the right of this lay three small chambers, adorned with iine coloured
sculpture and dedicated respectively to Horus, Osiriq, and Isis, Behind
them lies another room (Pl. To the left on entering the

South Wing. This building consists of a series of rooms, a

visit should be paid even if all the others be omitted, is the long,
slightly ascending corridor known as the
*GALLERY OF THE KINGS, entered from the left side of the second
hypostyle hall, between the second and third row of columns. On
the right wall is the famous LIST OF KINGS. Sethos L, with the
censer, and the crown-prinee Ramses (with the side-loek of youth)
reciting hymns from a papyrus-roll, are seen reveriug their royal
ancestors, the names of 70 of whom are inscribed in the two upper
rows. The list begins with Menes, the first king of Egypt, and extends down to Sethos, the names of unimportant or illegitimate rulers
being omitted. Above the list is the inscription:'The performance
of the prayer for the dead - May Ptah-Stoker-Osiris, lord ofthe tomb,
who dwells in the temple ofSethos, increase the gifts for the kings
of Upper and Lower Egypt - by King Sethos; 1000 loaves ofhrcatl,
1000 barrels of beer, 1000 rattle, 1000 geese, 1000 incense-offerings, etc., by King Sethus for King Menes' etc. (here follows the
list). In the lowest row the phrases'by King Men-mir-re','by the
son of Re, Sethos' are repeated over and over again.

This list of kings is of great historical importance as partly by its

aid it has been possible to "the order of succession of the Egyptian
kings. Another similar list is mentioned at p. 275.
