boys. It is not advisable to watch the filii too closely, as he is

These schools, mostly founded by endowments of the Wald Administration (p.1xxxvi), are now managed by the Ministry of Education. The were
reading and recitation of verses from the Koran being in itself considered
a meritorious act, the great object of these schools is to teach the pupils
to recite the Koran by heart. Although the language is often antiquated
and obscure, no explanations are given, so that the boy who knows the
whole book by heart usually understands but little of it. After learning
the alphabet the pupil is taught to write a few simple words, such as the
names of his friends, and then learns the ninety-nine'beautiful' names
of Allah, a knowledge of which is necessary to enable him to repeat the
ninety-nine prayers of the Mohammedan rosary (sebha). The boy is next
made to learn the thha (p.1xxxvii), or first chapter (sureh) of the Koran,
after which he proceeds to learn the last, the last hut one, and the others
in the same inverted order, until he reaches the second, the reason being
that the chapters gradually diminish in length from the second to the last.
The course of study frequently takes 44% years and its completion is commemorated by the celebration of the Khatmeh, a family festival, to which
the schoolmaster is invited.

The Bazaars i of Cairo, though inferior to those of Damascus
and Constantinople, present to the European traveller many novel
features and many interesting traits of oriental character. As is
the universal custom in the East, shops of the same kind, with
their workshops, are congregated together in the same quarter,
named sometimes after a mosque but more usually after the wares
there sold, e.g. Stilt en-Na Mdsht, bazaar of the coppersmiths, Stilt
et-lrhordafiyeh, bazaar of the ironmongers. Most of the bazaars consist of narrow, and often dirty, lanes, generally covered over with
an awning to shade them from the sun, and flanked with shops about
6 ft. wide. These shops (dukkcin) are open towards the street, and
in front of each is a mastaba or seat on which the customer takes his
place and on which the shopkeeper offers his prayers at the appointed
hours. These lanes usually enclose a massive storehouse of cow
siderable size (khan), consisting of two stories. Several such kh√©ns
together form a quarter of the city (ham). These were formerly
closed at night by massive, iron-mounted gates, still in some cases
preserved, though no longer used.

The principal market-days are Monday and Thursday, when
the traffie in the narrow streets is so great that it becomes difficult
or impossible to traverse them. Pedlars are seen forcing their way
through the crowd, shouting at the top of their voices. So, too, we
observe eoffee-sellers, water-Barriers, sweetmeat-vendors, and others,
elbowing their way.

In walking through bazaars and other streets the traveller will
be interested in observing how industriously and skilfully the
ARTISANS work, with tools of the most primitive description. The
turners (Kharrmit), for example, are equally adroitwith hand and foot.



t deat is properly speaking a Persian word, the Arabic equivalent
for which is silk. The magazines of the wholesale merchants, with their
large courts, are called wakkdteh or wakkala, which the Franks have
corrupted to Occaleh or Okella (comp. p. Clxxxvi).
