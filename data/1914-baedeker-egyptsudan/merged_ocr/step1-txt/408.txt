a. Isthmus of Suez and History of the Suez Canal.

The Isthmus of Suez, a neck oflaud which connects Africa wi
Asia, is at its narrowest part TO M. in width. On the S. side it
washed by the N. part of the Gulf of Sues (Arab. Baler Kolmn
Greek fleroiipolite Bay), the western of the two arms of the R,
Sea, which separates Africa and Asia. The idea of a Suez Canal
no modern conception. The earliest authenticated attempt to co
meet the Red Sea with the Nile (and thereby with the Mediterranea
was made by echa Cp. av ], His plan was to extend towards t }
S., from Lake Tims√©h to the Red Sea, an earlier canal, in existen
even during the Middle Empire, which diverged from the Nile ue
Bubastis and flowed through the Widi Tamilzit (p. 180). Herodot
informs us that no fewer than 120,000 Egyptians perished whi
engaged in the work, and that the king abandoned the undertakil
when he was informed by an oracle that the barbarians (i.e. tl
Persians) alone would profit by it. The canal was completed a cel
tury later by Darius. Its course roughly corresponded to that of tl
present Fresh Water Canal [ cump. p. 180). Darius Commemorate
the completion of the great work by various monuments on i
banks, of which the remains have been found at different Silo
Ce.g. to the S. of Tell el-Maskhtt.a; to the W. of the Serapeu
station; to the N. of Esh-Shsiitarehi and to the N. of Suez). Under the Ptolemies the canal system was extended, and Ice ]
were erected at its efflux into the Red Sea.

The canal fell into disrepair during the first century B. (l, at
Trajan (98-117A.D.) seems to have restored it. At all events, a can:
beginning near Cairo and terminating in the Gulf of Suez, the pr

where described, was called the Amnis Trajanus (Trajan's river).

After the Arabs had conquered Egypt they must have' been
