on the law of primogenituro, and in 1867 he was raised to
the rank of Khedive, or Viceroy, having previously borne
the title of man, or governor of a province only. in 1869
the Suez Canal was opened (p. 184). In 1873 the Khedive obtained a new flrman confirming and extending his
privileges (independence oi'administration and judiciaries;
right of concluding treaties with foreign countries; right
of coining money; right of borrowing money; permission
to increase his army to 30,000 men). The annual tribute
payable to the Porte was fixed at 133,635 purses (about
700,000t0. The warlike successes of the Khedive resulted in the extension of his dominions to the borders
of Ahyssinia and, on the S., to the 2nd parallel ofN.latitude. - The burden of the public debt had now increased
to upwards of 100,000,0001., one loan after another having been negotiated. The Powers brought such a pressure
to bear on the Khedive that he was compelled to resign
his private and family estates to the state and to accept a
ministry under the presidency of Ntbar Pasha, with the
portfolio of public works entrusted to II. luignibres and
that of tinanee to Mr. Rivers Wilson. This coalition, however, soon proved unworkable; and early in 1879 the

accordingly took place on June 20th. He died at Constanti110p1e in 1895.

Ismi'il was succeeded by his son Tuning [ or Tewfilr, in the
Turkish pronunciation), under whom the government was
carried on in a more rational spirit. The debts were regulated, an international commission of liquidation was
appointed, and an extensive scheme of reform was undertaken. In Sept., 1881, however, a military revolution
broke out in Cairo, which had for its chief object the
emancipation of Egypt from European influences. The
Khedive was besieged in his palace and had to yield; he
appointed Sherifpresident of a new ministry and arranged
for an election of Notables, or representatives. As the
latter espoused the'national' cause, Sherif resigned in
Feb., 1882, and Maluniid Pasha formed a new ministry,
the soul of which was Arabi Bey, the energetic minister

the consent of the khedive, to pass several measures intended to diminish the European iuih1enee in the political and flnancial administration of the country. At the
