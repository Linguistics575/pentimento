cxlvi VI. EGYPTIAN RELIGION.

goddess Seshet inscribed the years of the coming reign on the leaves
of the sacred tree. At On stood also the Obelisk-like stone column
of Benben, the chosen seat of the sun-god. The local deity, strictly
speaking, was, however, Alum, - and the astete priests of On put this
god on a par with the god of the sun and asserted that he was only
another form, another name of 1lEirakhtis. This doctrine obtained
a wide currency throughout the country and all the local gods were
promptly identified with lie and invested with the symbol of RE,
vis. the sun-disk with the poisonous royal serpent (nrmns. p. elxxvii)
coiled round it. Thus even the crocodile-god Sobek and Amen of
Thebes became sun-gods. This amalgamation of local deities with
Re, which began under the Middle Empire and was carried to great
lengths under the New Empire, was a fertile source of confusion
in the Egyptian religion. Attempts indeed were made to draw a
distinction among the various forms of Re, Khepre for example
being regarded as the morning-sun and Atum as the evening-sun,
but nothing like a systematic scheme was ever achieved.

In the same way a number of female local deities, especially
when they were of a similar character, were welded into one. Thus
Hathor, the goddess of the sky, was identified with Isis; the cat-goddess Bum: with the lion-goddesses Sekhmet and Pekhet, while Sekhmet was identified also with the vulture-goddess Mut.

When the centre of the empire was carried farther to the S. under
the Middle Empire and THEMES became the capital in place of Memphis, a new phase began in the development of the Egyptian religion.
Amen, the Theban local god, who had been identified with the sungod under the name of Amon-RE, took precedence of all other gods,
and at the beginning ofthe New Empire became the head ofthe Egyptian pantheon. The great campaigns against Nubia and Asia were
waged in his name by the Theban kings, temples were erected to
him in the conquered lands, and the lion's share of the spoil fell to
his shrines in Egypt, especially to the temple at Thebes. Amen, in
short, became the national god, the successful rival of his predecessor
Horus (RÃ©-Harakhte). It was not to be expected that the priests of
Heliopolis should tamely submit to this weakening of theirinf1uenee.
They therefore eagerly seized the first opportunity of overthrowing
Amen and of restoring the sun-god to his former offieial dignity.
When Amenophis IV. succeeded to the throne the sun-god of Heliopolis [ Re-Harakhte) regained the position of supreme deity, and
shortly afterwards the sun itself (Egypt. Aton) was announced as
the one and only god. This revolution was doubtless to some extent
prompted by the king's desire to put a stop to the prevailing religious
confusion at a blow, and to make practice square with theory, for
theoretically all the numerous deities had long been explained as
in reality one with the great sun-god (comp. p. 211). The representations and names of Amon and his fellow-gods were everywhere obliterated. But after the death of Amenophis the partisans
