342 Ram: 22. ESNEIL From Luxor

The river-banks are picturesquely clad with extensive groves of
palms, but the smoking chimneys of the sugar-factories interfere
with the beauty of the scenery. The steamer passes the Barrage of
Esneh by means of a lock (262 ft. long) next the W. bank. The barrage was constructed in 1906-9 by Messrs. John Aird & 00. (p. 372)
at a cost. of "1,000,000. It is 955 yds. long, 20 ft. broad at the
top, and rises 30 ft. above the Nile at its lowest. Its 120 sluices
are intended mainly to regulate the irrigation of the province of
lieneh. On both banks of the river arelarge canals with sluices.

36 M. (W. bank) Esneh, or Ema (New Grand Hotel, modest, R.
8 pias., on the river-bank), is also a railway station (p. 333; steamboat to Luxor, see p. 2521. Esneh, which in antiquity adjoined the
town of Emil, was one of the most important places in Upper Egypt.
Its Egyptian name was Te-snEL whence came the Coptic Sne and
the Arabic Email. The Greeks called it Latopolis, after the latos,
a kind of fish venerated here. Esneh is now a district-capital with
19,103 inhab., and has post and telegraph oftiees, a druggist's shop,
and numerous coffee-houses. The hltittirtyeh, Post Office, Tribunal
Sommaire Lwith the telegraph office), and other public buildings
stand in the street skirting the Nile. On the old quay, near the
miid'iri.veh, are some fragmentary inscriptions and the remains of a
nilometer of the Roman imperial epoch. A road leading to the right
from the river-bank btings us to the chief object of interest, still to
a large extent buried in d√©bris, viz. the
*TEMPLE OF KHNUM, the ram-headed local deity, associated with
whom were Neith (identified by the Greeks with Athena) and Satet.
The extant edifiees were built in the Ptolemaie period and extended
and embellished with inscriptions and reliefs by various Roman
emperors. The fagade, 120 ft. wide and 50 ft. high, is turned towards
the E. and is crowned by a concave cornice, in which stand the
names of Claudius and Vespasian. On the architrave below, on each
side of the winged sun-disk, are the votive inscriptions of these emperors. Vespasian is referred to as lord of'Rome the capital'. The
vestibule, which belongs almost entirely to the Roman imperial
epoch, is the only portion that has been excavated as far as the pavement. It corresponds in arrangement to the pronaos of the temple
of Hathor at Dendera (p. 246); it is 108 ft. broad and "ft. deep.
The roof, Which is embellished with astronomical representations,
is home by 24 columns (in 4 rows), with elaborate horal capitals
and decorated with reliefs and inscriptions. Each column is 37 ft.
high and 173/4 ft. in circumference; the first six are connected by
stone screens. - The walls are covered with four rows of representations, showing emperors in the costume of the Pharaohs before the
various gods of Esneh. In the middle of the Rear Wall (W.) a pol"
tal (now built up), resembling a pylon and crowned with a concave
cornice, gave access to the inner parts of the temple. The reliefs and
inscriptions upon it date from the reign of Ptolemy VI. Philometor.
