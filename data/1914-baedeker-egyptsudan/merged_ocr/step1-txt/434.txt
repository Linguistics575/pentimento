two narrow passages, each of which is adjoined by three rooms. The anterooms also have adjacent chambers from which we may enter the cellars
or ascend by two flights of steps to the upper floor, with its diiTerent apartments, and thence to the roof, whence we obtain an extensive view of
the remains of the ancient city, of the lake, and the desert. Over the
doors leading into the second and third anteroomg and into the sanctuary,

kiosque of Phila (p. 370); the second and larger of the two is
situated 300 paces from the smaller. Its walls (18 ft. by til it.)

lying on the ground show, belong to the Ionic order.
