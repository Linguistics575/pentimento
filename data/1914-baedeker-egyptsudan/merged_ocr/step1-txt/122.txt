IT. MEDIIE VAL HISTORY.

The country was ravaged for seven years by pestilence and
famine, owing to the failure of the Nile inundation. Palestine and Syria were overrun by the Seljuks, who attacked
them from the E. There were reVolts among the Turkish
and Berber mercenaries. The palace and the library were
plundered.

Badr el-Gamdli, Mustanyir's Armenian vizier, restored order
in the capital, and governed with almost unlimited power,
to the great advantage of Egypt. His son
El-Afdal became vizier to the young caliphY H

El-Musta'li, son of Mustaxwir, who conquered
