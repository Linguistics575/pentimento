Week Rock Tombs. ALEXANDRIA. 2. Route. 19

Close by is Ct Graera-Iioman Catacomb of the 3rd or 4th cent. A.11., in
three stories (excavated in 1010). - Farther to the w. lie sumo other
tombs, of less interest and um. worth visiting.

The main portion of the ARAB QUARTER lies on the ancient
llcptnstadium (p. 13), between the E. and the W. harbours. It contains several bazaars. The, chief thoroughfare is the RUE n a FRANCE
(Pl. E, F, 3, 4), which begins at the N.W. corner of the Place Méhemet Ali (p. 15) and is prolonged by the Rue Mas uid Terbana
and the live HAS ET-TIN. The last diverges to the W. and intersects the Tunmsu QUARTER CPI. 0, D, 3), on what was formerly
the island of Pharos (p. 13), with less narrow streets and pieteresque houses and gardens. Both these quarters present interesting
scenes of oriental life.

To the N. of the Rue lies ct-Tin. near the shore of the Bay of
Anfiishi, lie two Greek Rock Tombs (P1. B, C, 3), dating from
ca. 900 11.0. Permission to visit them must be obtained thmu h

EASTERN BUItIAL PLACE. By means of a flight of steps and a terraced
slope we reach a. rectangular court (now uncovered) off' which open two
tenths, each consisting of a large vestibule and the tomb proper. The
ceilings consist of harrehvnulting. The walls of the vestibule of the East
Tomb hear numerous Greek inseriptiuns and drawings, including a cleverly
sketched ship with a tower. In the rear wall of the sepulchral chamber is a
niche in the Eg'tian sttlet The Worth Tomb is the finest of all. The
walls of the vestibule terminate in a concave cornice and are painted to
imitate alabaster and black and white marble. The painting of the ceiling
is intended to make it look as if divided into colters. The ceiling of the
sepulchral chamber seems to have been painted with great taste; in front
of the niche in the rear wall is an altar of limestone. - Close by is the
WESTERN BURIAL PLACE, which is very similar to that just described. The
vestibule of the w. Tomb served us a triclinium in which the banquet for
the dead was held. The tomb still contains its granite sarcophagus. In
the vestibule or the W". Tomb are three tombs of later date, constructed
of bricks. The wall-paintings here also imitate alabaster and limestone.

The Rue Ras et-Tin ends at the khtylivial Palace of Res et-Tin
(I'L A, I), 3), a name signifying'promontory ot' figs'. The palace
contains nothing of interest and is not accessible. The Harem, a
separate building, is built on the model of the seraglio at Constantinople. - The street skirts the N. side of the palace to the Lighthouse (PL A, 4; no adm.).

The best return-route to the Place Me'hu'met Ali lead: past the
Murtne Arsenal (Pl. C, D, 3), along the West Harbour (p. It), and
through the Rees Moutonch Paeha, de, do la Marine, Bat, and
Anastasi. To the left of the Rue de la Marine we see the For!
IYn/urclli (Pl. E, 5) or Fort anole'an, with a signal-station.

A visit should be paid also to the new quays of the East Har,
bum (p. It), which were constructed at a cost of £13 374,000.
These have been converted into an attractive boulevard. called the
Quai-Promenade Abbas-Deux, on which is situated the Government
Building (Pl. 1, 3). To the NW. of the harbour stands the
picturesque Fort Wit Bey (PL I), 1% ,1), on the site of the old
Pharos Lighthouse (p. 13).
