still his home. Where it is pitched is a matter of indifference to
him, it only the pegs which secure it be firmly driven into the earth,
it' it shelter his wife and child from the burning sunshine and the
chilly night-air, and if pasturage-ground and a spring be within
reach. At Ralnleh 0n the coast, near Alexandria, the traveller may
see numerous Betlnin families of the poorest class eneampetl in
their tents, where they live in the most frugal possible manner, with
a few miserable goats and the t'owls which subsist on the rubbish in
their neighbourhood. Though professors of islim, the Beduins of
Egypt are considerably less strict in their Observances than the fellahin ot' the valley of the Nile, who are themselves sufficiently lax,
and above all they sadly neglect the religious duty of cleanliness.
They do not observe the practice of praying five times a day, and
they are as a rule but slightly acquainted with the Koran. Relics
of their old star-worship can still be traced among their customs.

The traveller Will occasionally observe Beduins in the streets and
in the bazaars of the armourers and leather-merchants, and will be
struck with the proud and manlybearing of these bronzed children
of the desert, whose sharp, bearded features and steady gaze hetoken
tirmness and resolution In Egypt the traveller need not fear their
predatory propensities.

(4). ARAB DWELLERS IN Towns. Those Arabs with whom the
traveller usually comes in contact in towns are shopkeepers, officials,
servants, coaelm1en, and donkey-attendants. These are generally
of a much more mixed origin than the fellahin. It thus happens
that the citizens of the Egyptian towns consist of persons of every
complexion from dark-brown to white, with the features of the
worshippers of Osiris or the sharp protile of the 1leduins, and with
the slender figure of the fellah or the corpulenee ot the Turk.
Among the lower classes intermarriage with negro-women has sometimes darkened the complexion and thickened the features of their
offspring; while the higher ranks. including many descendants of
white slaves or Turkish mothers, more nearly resemble the European
type. As the inhabitants of the towns could not be so much oppressed by their rulers as the peasantry, we find that they exhibit
a more independent spirit, greater enterprise, and a more cheerful
disposition than the fellahin. At the same time they are not free
from the dreamy character peculiar to orientals, nor from a tinge of
the apathy of fatalism; and their indolenee contrasts strongly with
the industry of their European rivals in political, seioutific, artistic,
and all business pursuits. Of late years, however, they have begun
to occupy themselves with seientitic studies and to produce a considerable number of higher oflicials, barristers, doctors, architects,
engineers, etc. The townspeople profess 1slim, but, in their
youth particularly, they are becoming more and more lax in their
obedience to tho Koran. Thus the custom of praying in public, ont-.
side the house-doors am ] shops, is gradually falling into disuse. Like
