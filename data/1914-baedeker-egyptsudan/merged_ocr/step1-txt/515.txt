From the Birth Room we enter Room o, the roof of which is
supported by three columns, and thence, after glancing at the much
damaged reliefs, we pass through an arched doorway, of later insertion, into the so-called
Sanctuary of Alexander the Great (Pl. G). This chamber was
practically rebuilt in the reign of Alexander. The original four
supporting columns in the centre were replaced by a chapel (open
both front and rear), in which the sacred boat of Amen was preserved. The reliefs covering both the interior and exterior walls of
the chapel represent Alexander before Amon and his fellow-gods;
those on the walls of the chamber still show Amenophis m. before
the Theban deities. - A gap in the wall on the N. side of the sanetuary admits us to a small square Hall (PI. F), with four clustered
papyrus-columns. The wall-reliefs, which are in four rows, show
Amenophis III. before Amen and other Theban deities. The original door hence to the sanctuary has been built up.

The Rearmost Rooms of the temple are of comparatively little interest. From the Sanctuary of Alexander we pass through Room S (with
12 columns) into the Sanctuary (PI. X), the ceiling of which was borne by
four clustered papyrus-columns. A relief to the left of the entrance shows
Alum and Horus conducting the king into the sanctuary. The other reliefs
represent the king in presence of Amon. - The small Room V, which was
probably a store-room for saerifleial gifts, is now accessible only from
without the temple.

We now proceed to inspect the Pylon (p. 258). On the way thither
the traveller should not omit to cast a glance on the exterior w. walls
of the Court and Colonnade of AmenOphis 111. and the Court of Ramses [ 1.
(PI. b, c, d). These walls were embellished by Ramses li. with reliefs
of scenes from his Asiatic campaigns.

A paved street, flanked on both sides with figures of recumbent
rams, each with a small image of Amenophis 111. in front of it, led
to the N. from this temple to the temples of Karnak. The avenue of
splduses beside the temple of Khons at Kamak (p. 202) is a remnant of this street.
