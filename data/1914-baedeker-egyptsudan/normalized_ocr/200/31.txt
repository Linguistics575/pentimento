While much caution and iinnness are desirable in dealing with
the people, it need hardly be added that the traveller should avoid
heing too exacting or suspicious He should bear in mind that
many of the natives with whom he comes in contact are were
children, whose demands should excite amusement rather than
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliness
of disposition. The native communities hold together with remarks
able faithfulness, and the hand of a common religion, which takes
the place of'party' in other countries, and requires its adherents
to address each other as'ya akiniya' (my brother), is far more than
a mere name. On the other hand, iutiumte acquaintance with Orien-
tals is to be avoided, especially with the dragomaus, who sometimes
presume on their opportunities of social intercourse (comp. below).
In Lower Egypt travellers can usually make themselves understood
in French or Italian; in Upper Egypt llnglish is more useful.

'rlm dragoursns arc with few exceptions quite uneducated, without
the, least knowledge of the historic or wsthetic sigtdileanee of the
monuments; and their'explanations' of them are only too often
merely garbled versions of what they have picked up from guide-
books or from the remarks of previous travellers.

Those who wish to make long tours in the desert or hunting
excursions are advised to consult residents learned in these matters.
The tourist-agots also can sometimes give good advice, and the
necessary outiit (tents, kitchen utensils, etc.) may be bought or
hired through them. - For sporting and other expeditions in the

On the successful termination of the journey travellers are the apt
from motives of good nature to write a more favourable testimonial for
their dragoman than he really deserves: but this is may an act of in-

jnstiee to his subsequent employers. The testimonial therefore Should
