of its walls may be recognized also in the sloping banks of the
Bahr: eileh el-Uedid. There is no doubt that this editiee was the
famous Labyrinth, of which ancient travellers speak with such
unbounded admiration.

For the best description we are indebted to Strnbo, who visited the
Labyrinth in person, He says:'There is also the Labyrinth here, a work
Is important as the Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king
who built the Laby rinth After advancing about 30 KO stadih beyond iii;
first entrance of the canal we reach a tahle- -shaped surface, on which
rise a small trwn and a vast palace, consisting of its many royal dwellings
as there were formerly names. Furthere is that precise number otcourm
bordered with columns and adjoining each other, all being in the same
row, and forming one building, like a long wall having the courts in trout
of it. The entrances to the courts are on the opposite side from the wall. _
In from, of the entrances are numerous long covered passages, intersect-
ing each other and thus forming such a winding path that h stranger
cannot find his way into or out of each court Without a guide. It is .1
marvellous fact that each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of: t
single stone, and also that the passages are covered in the same way
with single sihhs of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building
material having been employed, On ascending to the roof, the height of
which is iueonsiderable as there is only one stnry, we have a survey of
the ilat stcue surface consisting of these large eiahs, On emerging from
the covered passages we have a view of them extending in one line, each
borne by twenty-scven monolithic columns. The walls also are constructed
of stones of similar size. At the end of this structure, which is more
than a stadium in length, is the tomb, comisting of a square pyramid,
each side of which is (our piethramoo ft.) in length, and of equal height.
The deceased Who is buried here is called Imandes. It is asserted that
so many palaces were built because ithts the custom for MI the homes,
represented by their mngnnles, with their priests and victims, to assemble
here to orer _sagritice and gifts to the gods, and to deliberate on the most
important concernsr Each name then took possession of the hall destined
or it.'

The remains of brick buildings, which still linger on themounds
of rubbish to the E. of the temple and were erroneously regarded
by Lepsius as remains of the Labyrinth, date from a. village of the
Roman period. - To the N. of the pyramid stretebes the large Ne-
eropolis used since the period of the Middle Empire by the rirher
inhabitants of Shetet- [ ir0eo1ily1rli? (p 192).
