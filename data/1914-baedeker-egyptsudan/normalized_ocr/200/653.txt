The mostimportant harbours on the Red Sea, named from N. to s.,
were Myoa Ilormos (now Abu Shdr cl-KiLli), Lrukos Limen (now
Kageir), and Berenike.

FROM KEYEH TD Amy SHAR GL- I (mm, 5- 6 days The route loads
to the N. E. from the l "ddi 11 eneh to the (3 days' march) Wadi Falireh
011 the N. side of which lies the G'dal Fatireh (4920 ft.: iMons Claud-
ianus). About tl/g Jr. to the S. of the latter Wadi are the granite
quarries, known as Cmm Difcal (% other of columns"), which were
worked by rapthes and oonvirts, ehief1yinthe reigns of Trajan and
Hadrian. Traces have been found also of old gold-mines, the
exploitation ofwhich is again being attempted by theFatirah Explor-
ing Company. Here are situated also the ruins of the Roman settle-
ment of Hydreuma'I'rujrmi. These consist mainly of a fort about
82 yds. square surrounded by walls aml towers. Outside the walls
lie a temple arul other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found in the quarries. About two days'
journey farther to the N. is the Man: Porphyrites, now called Gcbel
Ihtkhdn ('smoke mountain'; 4460 (1), thisaneient porphyry quarries
ot which were worked by the Romans. Here are the ruins of an
Ionic temple of the time oflladrian (never completed) 7 remains of a11
irregularly built town, and two large water-reservoirs. We follow
the ancient route hence to the plateau of Abu & ulr el-lfil/Li, on the
E. slope of which lie the ruins oUlyas Hormos (see above). On the
coast, 3 M. to the R., are the remains of a Roman fort.- A second
route, running farther to the s., along the aurient'i'orphyty Road',
ascends the large W6di Kemlz, then proceeds to the Wddi (fatter,
and iiitally skirts the S. basis of the Mons Porphyrites to the sea.

The JOURNEY FROM [ (2) 1311 TD lfoemn (4-5 days; from Luxor,
see below) is murh more interesting. The route from Keueh follows
the valley of the Nile for the first day and leads through the villages
of Sheik }: Ile/cob, Dam, and Kzim'lmwin, the first on the left, the
other two on the right side of the road. The first night is generally
spent "the caravanserai ofBir'Amber, about 31/; hrs. from Keneh.
This large caravansorai was erected at the expense of an Ibrahim
Pasha and comprises several separate huildings, covered with dome-
shaped roofs and surrounded by courts and colonnades.

on the second day we advance steadily towards the E., ascending
almost imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain intersected in
all directions by small undulating heights. All around us extend
the interminable yellowish-grey, snn-bleached rocks of the desert;
not a trace of organic life is visible, not a single green tree or shrub.
To the E. of the Gehel srHrisrr1 ('the horn'), about midway between
Bir'Ambar and Lakeita, the road from [ geneh is joined by that from
Luxor. The only variety is afforded by an occasional Mal/wala or IH..
llayn. The mahwalns are the places where the camels are halted
from time to time to make water. They occur on every great caravam
