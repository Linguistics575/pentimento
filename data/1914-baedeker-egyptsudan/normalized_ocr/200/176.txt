of the plan of the mortuary temples of the Middle Empire beside
the pyramids of Lisht, Dahsltr) r, Illahilu, and 1.lawirra. Most of these
are in a very ruinous condition, like the temple of Amenemhet 111.,
the gu-ealled Labyrinth (p.195), while others have not been fully
excavated. The only one in tolerable preservation ls the mortuary
temple of Mentuhotep Ill. and Mentnhorep IV. "Deir el-Bulni
[ p. 304), but that is built on a peculiar plan with terraces and can-
not be considered typical. For the way in which the pyramids were
built, comp. p. 124. At a later period the kings of Napata and Mero'e
(pp. 419, 422) re-adopted the pyramidal form for the royal tombs.

The custom of placing their tombs at the foot of a royal pyramid
was gradually abandoned by the nobles at the close of the Ancient
Empire; they preferred to be buried near their own homes. Like
the Pharaohs they built for themselves small BRICK Pvnemns upon
square or rectangular bases. The tomb-charnber was formed in the
thickness of the wall or dug out of the ground beneath; and a tomb-
stone was erected on the outside, before which the survivors recited
their prayers or presented their otrerings. But the high and steep
deelivity of the desert-plateau did not always offer space enough
for such free-standing tombs; and at various points graves were
hewn in the rock, a practice of which there were isolated examples
even under the Ancient Empire o. 139). In accordance with the
fundamental conception of the tomb as the House of the Dead, each
ot' these ROCK Tmms must contain the four principal divisions of
the ancient Egyptian dwelling-house. Thus a Farecourt, usually
surrounded with a brick wall, was provided in the open air in front
of the tomb, generally ending in a small Colonnade with two pillars
or columns hewn in the solid rock. Beyond this was a large Chamber
with columns or pillars, followed by a small Chamber or Recess,
which contained the statue of the deceased, frequently accompanied
by that of his wife, hewn out of the rock, and thus corresponded
to the serdib (p. clxviii) of the old maetabas.

This dwelling-house arrangement is most distinctly seen in the
roek-tombs of Benilrasan and Assuiu (comp. pp. 227, 358). The
inner walls are covered with inscriptions and representations, which,
though more varied in subject than those of the earlier tombs, agree
with them in being intended to provide for the enjoyment of the
deceased. The unembellished sareophagus-ehamber was reached
from the tirst hall by a perpendicular shaft hewu in the rock.

The Tones or THE New EMPIRE coincide in their general fea-
tures with those of the Middle Empire. At this date also both free-
standing tombs (mas.t.abas and pyramidal tombs) and g0ok-hewu
tombs occur, according to the nature of the site at ilifrerent places.
The former variety of tomb is now, however, represented by very
few examples. In the roek-tomts a narrow corridor is frequentiy
found between the tirst hall and the small inner chamber with the
statues; for their general arrangement and decoration, see the re-
