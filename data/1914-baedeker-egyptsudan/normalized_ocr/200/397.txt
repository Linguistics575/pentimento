The town is regularly laid oat and the crowded Arab quarteris
gradually disappearing before modern streets. The main street
runs to the W. from the railway station to the Nile. In a square
near the police-station is the unassuming mosque of m-hrrrwitit.
An unfounded tradition points out an old house of Snladiu's time,
close by, ps the prison of Louis IX. (see above and p. cxvii). - In
the quarter between the main street and the Nile arc the consulates,
the former Palace of the Khalive, a large and unattractive building,
now used as a mixed tribunal, and the small mosque of Sanga. The
last contains columns brought from older ediMes, with Byzantine
napitals of Corinthian tendency, hearing Snmeeuie arches. The
miabat (pulpit) and ceiling are still embellished with remains ot'
hrue wood-earving, which was originally painted.
