waters of Lake Timsilr, At [ 511/2 M.) Ne/Tsheh, the first station, the
railway to Suez diverges to the left (see p. 181). The line to Caiho
traverses the Arabian Desert, which is intersected from E. to W.
by the Wadi Tihnihit, and skirts the Fresh Water or Iam√©'myeh
Canal. The fertile tract Which we now traverse is part of the Goshen
of the Bible. During the Turkish regime it fell into a miserable
condition, and at the beginning of the 19th century afforded at very
scanty subsistence to barely 4000 Arabs; but the cultivation was
so rapidly improved by means of the fresh-water canal that it
now supports upwards of 12,000 prosperous farmers and peasants.
ileyom1 the canal, on the left, is a fertile strip, behind which rise

the desert hills.

The Fresh Water 0r Ismh'iliyeh Canhl, constructed in 1358-63 to
supply the villages on the Suez, Chnal with drinking-Watcr and enlarged in
1876 is in great part a restoration Of an earlier ehnal dating from the
Middle Empire. This ancient canal, which began at the Nile, watered the
land of Goshen with its hunches, and entering the Bitter Lakes (p.186),
changed their character, according to Strnbo, and connected them with
the Red Sea. The ehhnhel at the old canal, which was re- -discoverct1
hy the French expedition or 1708, is still Iraceehle trt pieces, and its
direction has frequently been { allowed by the engineers of M, de Leeseps.
The remains of scarps or masonry show it to have been about 50yds. in
width and Iirl71h, ft. in depth. According to Herodotus the eeuhl we:
mar days' journey, and according to Pliny 62 Roman miles, in leagth.
It is now chietly used mr irrigation purposes. At Shuhm, to the N. of
Cairo, the canal diverges from the Nile and thence traces to the N.E. the
huuhdhry between the Arabian plateau run the N.) and the land of Gosheu
{ on the so. To the E. of Ahu Hammad (p. 181) it intersects the ancient
tresh- water canal coming from Zakazik, and then runs to the F. "parallel

The Goshen of the Bible (Egypt. Gnnm) is first mentioned ill the
nouk oi Genesis, xlv. 10, where Pharaoh says to Joseph: -'And thou
shalt dwell in the land or Goshen, and thou shalt he nearlmtt) me, than,
and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy hacks, and thy
herds, and all that thou hast'. Mention is made of Goshen also in Genesis
xlvi. 28, 29; and xlvii. 1, 6, 27. Exodus i. 11 mentions the cities in
Goehen in which the Israelites were compelled to work at the tasks im-
posed on them by Pharaoh: -'Therefore they did set over them task-
1wrsters to affliet them with their burdens. And they bnilt for Pharaoh
