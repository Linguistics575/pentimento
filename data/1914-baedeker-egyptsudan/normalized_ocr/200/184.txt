VIII. Buildings of the Mohammedans.
Hy I'l'anz-Patha.

The Mohammedan style of architecture in the valley ofthe Nile
was founded upon the forms of art which the victorious Arabs
found in vogue among the Byzantine and theCopts, and upon those
of Persian art of the em of the Sassanides. The buildings in Egypt
exhibit a considerable variety coupled with a certain finish ofstyle,
but none of them dates hack to the tlrst period ofthe Arabic dominion;
for the professors of the new religion were for centuries content
merely to adapt the religious editiees of the conquered countries as
mosquest This was a process of little'limeulty, for the ceremonial
requirements of the new religion were comparatively simple, and
it took place in all parts of the great empire of the 0alip'hs. From
casual references hy the Arabian ehroniclers we learn that the
earliest prayer-houses built by the Arabs It ere merely enclosed co urts,
along the walls of which ran covered passages7 supported by palm
trunks, in order to shelter the worshippers from sun and min.
liven the large mosqut' built by the Khalifa'A1nlallilr in Omdurmin
(p. 430) is of this type. Costly mosques, with marble arcades, be-
gan to appear Tery gradually, under the iuiluenoe of the ancient
Mihoes and of the increasing wealth flowing from the military
successes of the Mohammedans. Columns from Greek and Roman
temples and even, in some cases, from'rarly-Egyptiirn buildings,
were freely employed in these later mosques. This employment of
ancient columns in the mosques, frequently without any regard to
harmony of style or size, brings it ahont that uniformity in the
architecture of the arcades is observed only when the abacus is
reached. No distinct Arabian order of nolumns was thus ever de-
veloped in Egypt A few Arabian forms of capital (one a curious
form of "alyx-oapital, another including a wreath of stalaetites as
the transition between the shaft and the abacus) are the only evi-
tlenee of any effort towards originality in this direction.

The most prominent characteristic peculiarities of Arabian archi-
tecture are the following: -

1. The use of the pointed arch (Mosque ot'lhu Tul; m, p. 71) and
the Byzantine stilted round arch, as well as of the round and pointed
horseshoe arch, the scalloped arch, the clover-leaf etwh7 and the
'keel' arch. These (except the sea1lopei1 and elover-leaf arches ]
were accompanied by corresponding forms of domes.

2. The development of the form of tower known as the minaret.

3. The refining of various forms of pinnacles that occur also in
early Egypt, Assyrian, Phumieia, and Persia.

4. The employment in facades of two colours, by alternate
r-ourses of red and white limestone or (in later examples) of black
and white marble.

J. The invention of the elegant wooden balconies and the
