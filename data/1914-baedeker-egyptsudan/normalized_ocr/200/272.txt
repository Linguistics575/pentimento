To the SE. of the mosque of Sultan Hasau extends the large
*Plaee Seledin Orutn Saladin; Pl. E, 6,7), the flmyst square in the
city, at Viscount Kitehener's instigation formed in 1913 out of the
Place Hmneileh and Plan Mohammed Ali by the demolition of several
small streets and buildings. At the N. end of the Place, on slightly
elevated ground, stand two mosques? the (himi'el-Jrarrntidiyeh and
the dei' Emir Aklu5r (P1. E, (O. On the E. side rises the citadel
(see below), with the Bab el-uzub (Pr. E/O, murked with its huge
towers. Along the E. side of the Place extends the Shari" Maytubet
el-Mahmal; in its S. part is the Salt slimy, the scene of a busy
afternoon market. Here also take place the festivities on the depart-
ure of the Mecca Caravan (comp. pp. xcvi, xevii). At the S. end
of the Place are the Prison and, farther on, the gate named Brib el-
/raraTeli (Pl. E, 7). _ Taking the Shari'Dtyir er-Rifi'i, which leads
round the (ramir Ilifg'iyeh to the square mentioned on p. 66, We
see on the right, on a rocky hill, the small (hfliar Mosque (Pl. E, 6).

From the N.E. corner of the Place Saladin the citadel is 11p-
proached by the Shstrir el-Mahgar, a "arriage-road, and then by the
winding Shirir Birb el-Gedid, whith a view of the Tombs of the

Pl. E, F, 6), built by Mohammed Ali in 1828, or, quitting the
Place Saladiu by the Bib el-'Azah (see above), proceed straight on
by a narrow and crooked lane, enclosed by lofty walls. It was in
this lane, formerly the chief approach to the citadel, that the mas-
sacre of the Mamelukes took place on March ist, 1811, by order of
Mohammed Mi (p. cxxi) Amie Bey, the only one who survived, is
said to have escaped by making his horse leap into the moat.

The Citadel (El-Kal'a,' Pi. E, F, 6) was built in 1179 by
Saladin o. 45), with stones taken, according to the very credible
statements of Arabian historians, from the small pyramids at Gizeh.
Of the original structure, however, nothing new remains except the
outer E.wa11 and a few towers in the interior. Although the fortress
commands the city, it is itself commanded by the heights of the
Mokattam, rising above it immediately to the S.; thus in 1805 Mo-
