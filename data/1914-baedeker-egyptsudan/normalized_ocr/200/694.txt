REAR (W.) WALL. To the right (Pl. m) of the central door is
liamses H. leading two rows of captured Hittites before Harakhte,
his own deifled tigructy, and the lion- headed Wect-hiskesr; to the left
(P1. n) he leads two rows of negroes before Amen, the dtyiiled
Ramses anti Mut. - Between the two last (so pillars stands a
8tete (Fl. p) dating from the 3hth year of the reign of Ramses IL,
0l1 which is a long inscription recording in tiorid terms that Ramses
erected large editiees for Ptah of Memphis and presented rich gifts
to him.

Adjoining this large hall are eight CHAMBERS (Pl. F-N), pro-
bably used to store the temple utensils and furniture. Round
the walls of these, which are covered with inferior reliefs, run
stone tables.

We now enter a Hall (Pl. 0), 36 ft. broad and 25 ft. deep and
supported by four pillars. 0n the S. wall the king, followed by his
wife Nefret-ere holding two sistra, appears offering incense before
the sacred boat with the shrine of Amen, which is carried by
priests; and on the N. wall is a similar scene before the boat of RE-
llarekhte. Three doors lead from this hall into a long and narrow
Transverse Chamber (Pl. D), and thence three other doors admit to
three apartments, of which the two at the sides are very small. The
central apartment is the Sanctuary (Pl. E), containing a roiA-htswn
support for the sacred boat, behind which are seated figures of the
four deities worshipped in the temple - Ptah, Amon-M, the
deified Ramses, and the fal0or1-headed RÃ©-Harakhte.

Immediately to the S. of the great temple is a small Rocx: TEMPLE,
discovered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia
B. Edwards, the well-known writer (d. 1892), who has described it
in her interesting'Thousand Miles up the Nile'. This is possibly a
Birth House (comp. p. 250). The ilrst chamber, probably built of
brick and vaulted, has disappeared. The second chamber, hewn in
the mek, is the Sanctuary, and is embellished with well-pres-d
reliefs.
