56 Route f, CAIRO. 2. The Muski m

The nationality of the various groups of students may be learned

from the guide.

No lecture, are delivered on Thurs. or during the fasting month of
Ramadan. When teaching, the professor (sneak) sits cross-legged on (L
straw-mat or chair and reads from a hook placed on a desk (I'aflle/I) before
him, explaining each sentence as Le proceeds; or he directs one of the
more advanced students to read aloud, adding his own explanations from
time to time. The students sit in a circle around the teacher, listening Ur
attentively taking notes. As soon as a student knows by heart and can
explain the whole of the hook that is being studied by the class, the
sheikh makes an entry (11mm, Le. permission) in the student's copy of
the work, whereby authority to lecture in the faculty concerned is con-
ferred. But the student cannot avail himself of this permission llnlil
he has passed the tiual examinaliun, to which he may suburit himself
after receiving an Igizeh in each of the subjects of examination.

The complete Cnnmcuwu at the Azhar now last: my 17 years. Irthe
student (nmgdwir) successfully passes the. tinrrl examination "the end of
this period be receives the Shemideh eb-'aHrrriyerr, "'diploma orleirrning',
Which lual'shes him to much at the Aattar or other institutions of similar
standing (By. the mosque uf Ahmed at Tanga, p. 33). At the end or
the elevenlh year a preliminary examination is held, success in which
secures the Shzhddeh cz-Awiyen, a diploma qualifying for the minor orlieeg
in the mosques and fur the past of elementary teacher. The subjects
taught at the university fall into two classes: preparatary studies and
professional studies. The former emhmee synlax (mm), grammar (gum,
rhetoric (Imlag/m), logic (mrmlilt), the art of poetry (mm; and l Jyeh),
algebra (gm), arithmetic (n tib), and the proper mode or rec g the
traditions (muyuluzt eVl.tttd't The professional subjects are theology
Ckakim), jurisprudence (JIM p. mum), the explanation of the Koran
(tafsir), ml the teaching of the traditions (Zladith; p.lxxxv). History,
geography, mathematics, and style are optional subjects, - The above'st
of the subjects will serve to convey an idea ofthe intellectual condition
of Orientals M the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
culture consists in the entire absence of independent thought, in conse-
quence of which they are the mere recipients of the knowledge or the
past. Their minds are thus exulusive1y occupied with the lowest grade of
intellectual work, their principal task consisting in the systematic arrange-
ment or eneyulopaui1% compilation ofthe knowledge handed down to them.

At the head of the university is the Shaikh el-det', with an admin-
istrative committee of live. Control, especially in matters of th1auce,
is exercised by a Conseil Supknenr. Instruction is free; the university
is supported by pious endowments, from Which also bread and spending
money are provided for the students. Within the last few years numerous
'strikes' have taken place among the students in consequence of the
alleged misappropriation of the endowments by government. The income
is now SF, 23,900 in cash annually, hesides 25,000 loaves of bread daily,
representing an annual addition of 2Et8,250.

The principal entrance (Pl. o, where strangers receive a guide,
is on the N.W. side, and is called Bith el-Jfusaivintn, or'Gate of the
Barbers', because the students used to have their heads shaved here.
To the right of this is the Jfesgid Taibarsiyeh CPI. 8), with a magai-
tieent milmib, or prayer-recess, of 1309, and to the left are the
office of the steward (PL 9), in a restored mausoleum, and the
Triwiyet et-0tigliCsuriyeh (P1. 10), now used as a library and eontain-
ing some rare MSS.

The long archway (Pl. 7), ending in a yortal added by lyWit Bey
(by whom the adjacent minaret also was built), leads directly into
the large Sal": el-. Gem", or mosque-court, enclosed by an arcade
