extent. The'Sherirs', or descendants of the prophet, how frequently
wear white turhalis, though originally they wore green, the culour
of the prophet. Green turbans are now worn by the Mecca pilgrims
of a year's standing. The various orders of dervishes are similarly
distinguished; the Ririfiyelt wear black, dark-blue, or bluish-green
turbans, the Ahmediyeh red, the Nidiriyeh white. The T) larni, or
clergy and scholars, usually wear a very wide, evenly folded turban
of light colour. The orthodox length of a lustiever's turban is seven
times that of his head, being equivalent to the whole length of his
body, in order that the turban may afterwards be used as the wearer's
winding-sheet, and that this circumstance may familiarize him with
the thought of Math. Many Mohammedans now, however, wear
European dress or adopt a semi-European, semi-oriental costume;
a common head-gear is the red turbash [ erroneously known as a [ es
by most Europeans). Little diitereuee is now observable between
the costume of the Gopts, Jews, and other oriental'uubelievers' am ]
that of the Moslem Egyptians, except that the Coptic priests usually
wear a black turban.

The Women of the poorer and rustic classes wear nothing but a
black gown and a veil.'their ornaments consist of silver, copper,
glass, or head bracelets, canings, and anklets, while their chins,
arms, and chests are often tatooed with blue marks. Similar tatooing
is common also among the mom In Upper Egypt nose-rings also
are frequently seen. The women of the upper classes are never so
handsomely dressed in the streets as at home. When equipped for
riding or walking they wear a silk cloak, with very wide sleeves
(Â£617 or sableh), over their home attire. They don also the barlm', or
veil, which consists of a long strip of muslin, covexing the whole
of the face except the eyes and reaching nearly to the feet. Lastly
they put on the haburu, a kind of mantle, which in the case of
married women cansists of two hreadths of glossy black silk. The
Coptic, Jewish, and Syrian women wear the same custume, but are
generally unveiled.'l'hc wealthier ladies, who drive in their car-
riages attended by euuuchs, usually veil their faces up to their eyes
with thin white gauze after the fashion of Constantinople. Egyp-
tian women colour their eyelashes and eyelids dark, and their tiuger
and toe nails with henna, which gives them a. brownish-yellow
tint, (Circumcision, weddings, and funerals, see pp. xciii et seq.)
