cixviii VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART,

into chambers by partition walls. Over the grave heaps of stories
were piled or a mound was formed of bricks made ot'Nile mud, on
the E. side of which a stele was set up; in front of this a small
court was made, which served as a place of worship, where the
gifts for the deceased were deposited. From this early form of
Egyptian tomb were developed the MAsnuAs, as the tombs of the
aristocrats of the Ancient Empire are nalied; these were erections
of limestone blocks or of bricks, with It rectangular gronnd- plan and
sloping walls. A Jia/iii/il, shaft (10 100 ft. in depth ] or a
staircase led down to the sepulehral chamber, containing the
corpse, Which frequently lay in a t3offin of wood or stone. A door-
shaped stone or stale, resembling a false door, set in a shallow
recess in the court on the E. side of the upper structure (the
court or place of worship, seldom discernible now), marked the
spot that was regarded as the entrance to the grave and to the
realm of the dead. In front of this the surviving relatives laid the
food, drink, and other oMriugs to the dead upon the flat Table of
CWerinys, or recited their prayers for the welfare of the departed.
After the close of the 3rd Dyn. a chapel was frequently built in
front of the recess or a regular ehamher of worship formed in the
masonry of the mas.taba, and the etele was then removed to its W.
side. In the time of the 5th Dyn. the inner chamber Was enlarged
and a number of additional rooms added. The extent to which these
'everlasting abodes' might be enlarged and developed is best illus-
trated by the mas.t.aha of Meremka at Sakk√©ra (p. 159), which, like
any ordinary well-to-do house, contains a suite of rooms for the
master, another (the harem) for his wife, a third. behind, for the
son, besides various store-rooms. The inner walls were embellished
with inscriptions and representations (usually in relief), depicting
the deceased at his favourite occupations. hunting and fishing, the
various activities on his estates, his workmen at work, etc. The
object of these representations was to enable the deceased to con-
tinue his occupations in the land beyond the grave (comp. pp. Ito
ct seq. and p. cxlvii). The deceased and the members of his family
were represented by statues, which were placed in one or more
special rooms (the so-eau" Serddbs, Le. cellars ], generally built
in the thickness of the. walls but sometimes separate structures.
These received light and air by means of small apertures only.
Most of the fine statues of the Ancient Empire now in the Museum
at Cairo (pp. 82 et seq.) were found in such serilibs.

Just as the streets of a town were arranged round the palace ot'
the king, so the rows of mastabas were grouped around the tomh
of the king. Originally the royal tombs Were large brick mastahas
like the others (comp. above), in or beneath which were chambers
for the body of the king, for those of his suite, and for the various
funeral gifts. Subsequently the royal ma.stabas were enlarged by
heightening them and surrounding them with several outer casings,
