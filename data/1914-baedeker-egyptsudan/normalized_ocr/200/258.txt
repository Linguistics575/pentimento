en to the next turning) into the long line of thoroughfare heginuing
with the 8hrhir el-khordagiyeh, and at the first cross-street on the
right we enter a large covered bazaar, known "the Khin eI-Khalili.

The Khan el-Khalili LPI. E, 3), still the centre of the market
trariie of Cairo, was founded in 1400 by Garkas el-Khalili, master
of the horse to Sultan Barlsti.k, on the site of a chateau of the Fati-
mites. It forms a distinct quarter of the city, and is intersected by
a main street and numerous cross-lanes, formed by long rows of
stalls of tradesmen and artisans, all covered over. Here are the
headquarters "the silk and carpet merchants and the vendors of
trinkets. We fallow the main avenue, the Smxs'r Eh-BADISTAN,
Which contains two graceful Arab gateways. la the tirst lane on the
left is the Bazaar of the Shoemaker', in which the red shoes of the
Arabs may be purchased. Farther on, to the right of the main street,
are some large Carpet Bazaars. T

The prices of Carpets, like those of uther oriehtal goods, are liable
to great ilruttutW1on. As sann as a purchaser appears the dealers spread
Iheir wares over the whole court for his inspection. Patience and time
are essential for a satisfactory bargain (crimp. p. 51). The black or white
tulle shawls, embroidered with gold and silver thread, are sold hy the best
dealers by weight; the prise varies from 3 to 6mm. yer dirhem (45,15 gr.
troy ]. Many of the so-ealled Dumascene silks, and particularly the lighter
kuirirelrs in pleasing colours, are manufactured at Lyons and Crefeld.

Taking the second cross-lane on the right and passing through
an interesting Arab Gateway, with stalactite vaulting, inscriptions,
serpentine ornamentation, and a few mosaics, we enter the attrac-
tive Brass Bazaar (Shari' Khan er-Khalili). From this bazaar we
enter the Shin" esh-Sharawini (p. 53) or go on through the Sikket
el~B§distéu. Opposite the end of the latter, in the Mashhad el-
1.loseini, is the -

11itmi' Seiyidms'HToseia or El-Hasauein (P1. E, 3), the mosque
of the youthful Ijosein, who fell at lierbela in 680 AD. in battle
against the enemies of his father Ali, son-in-law of the prophet,
who was slain in 661. Hosein is still highly venerated by Shiite
Mohammedans (p. xcii), particularly in Persia. The mosque [ in-
accessible to msrr-yroslems) is of no architectural importance, while
it has been almost completely modernized, even to the introduction
of gas-lighting. The chief attraction is the mausoleum, which 00R-
tains the head of Hosein, said to have been brought to Cairo in a
green silk bag. This mosque is ehieily frequented by men on Thurs-
days and by women on Saturdays.

From the mosque we turn to the s., cross the Shéri' esh-Shara-
wini obliquely, and enter the Suimr sm-IIs- (Pl. E, 3), which
is mainly occupied by the stalls of the Booksellers.

Most of the booksellers are also scholars, and their shops are the resort
of the learned world of Cairn. As the prices of books vary greatly in
accordance with the demand and other circumstances, and as there is no
such thing as a tized publishing price, purchasers should always endea-

Vour to ascertain heforehand the true value of any work they wish to
bar. As in the ease of many other wares, the line between new and
