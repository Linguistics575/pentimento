original doors corresponded to the seven sanctuaries of the temple.
Processious in honour of the king seem to have enturol by the door
to the extreme left; the next served for processions to Ptah, the thinl
for Hamkhte, the fourth for Amon, the M'tls for Osiris, the sixth
l'or Isis, and the seventh for Moms. Ramses, however, walled up
six ofthcse doors, leaving the central one alone as the main entrance
to the temple.

The present entrance is by the ancient main door. We first
oter the First Hypustyie Hall. which is about 57 yds, wide by
12 deep. The roof, part of which has fallen in is supportedhy
2i clustered papyrus-ol-s, with bud-capitals. The columns
am so arranged that two pairs stand on each side or the live central
processienal aisles, while the two outermost aisles are, each tlanked
on one, side by the walls of the temple. The representations on the
shafts of the columns represent the king before the deity to whom
the aisle led, sometimes aeeirupauiei1 by the other deities of his
trial Thus in thc Anion aisle we see, Ramses ll. before Amen,
hint, and Khons; in the Ptah aisle, the king before Ptah, Sckhmnt
(liathor), and Net'erteiu.'the, sculptures (reliet's'en trreuxO are
of mediocre workmanship; they date from Ramses IL, who here
forgot his filial piety so far as to chisel away his father's reliefs to
make room for his own. Tho only interesting MURAL RevruesEsTx-
TIONS are those in the lower row on the, tusd-wall to the right. To
the right Tlrout and Horus pour over Iiamse: ll. the holy water in
the form of the hieroglyphics for'purity' am ]'tire'; to the 1m
Wepwawet, with a wolf's head, and Horns, with a falcon's heal
'the avenger of his father', hold the hieroglyphic for'lire' to the
king's nose t-lose by, to the right, is Hathor of Deudera; further
tn the left, Ramses hands to Osiris and his oompanions, Isis and
Horus, a case for papyrus-rolls in the shape of a column held by
a kneeling king, with a falcou's head on the top as a lid.

Seven doors, placed in the axes of the bui1teup entrance-deors
and the sanctuaries, lead from this first hall into the Second Hypa-
atyle Hall. The aruhitrave, on which rest the rcofiug slabs, is sup-
ported by 36 columns, arranged on either side of the prosessional
aisles in pairs on the same system as in the preceding hall. The
'tr nolumns in the Jirst two TOWS of columns have papyrus-bud
capitals, Beyond the second row the floor of the temple is con-
siderably raised, forming a platform upon which stands the third
row of column These are tree-trank columns (p'civiii), with
rylindrii'al shafts and no capitals, on which rvst stone slabs form-
ing an abanus for the support of the an-hitrave. The inwrip-
tions and representations on the walls and rolumns date from the
reign of Scthos and are ofarhuirable workimruship, but their snhjccts
are oflittle general interest. The uondnl'ul'i'fletiefs on the right end
of the hall (Pi. bl should not be overlooked. lime, to the right, we,
see Sethos L standing before Osiris and Horus, holding a cause; and
