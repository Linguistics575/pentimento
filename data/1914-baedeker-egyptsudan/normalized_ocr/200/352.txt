Imme6istely before the latter is reached a tlight of seven steps leads to
the right to a chamber wngh recesses on the right end heck walls. The
tomtrelusmber "paved with blocks of granite, 21/2 ft. in thickness, and
its ceiling has been formed by placing the stones against each other at an
angle so asto resemble a roof and then hollowing them out on the inside
in the form of a Gothic arch. The richly decorated sarcophagus of Men-
kewre was found here hy Col. Vyse in a good state of preservation. It
was made or basalt and measured externally 2rt. 7 in. in height. The

The original intention of the builder was to cunstrnct a pyramid on
a small scale, containing only the sloping corridor ", leading to a chun-
her at e, smaller than that now existing. Butwhen a larger pyramid was
projected the corridor abed was formed, leading iirst to an antechamber
and then to a tomb-chamber at e, enlarged by deepening the earlier
chamber at that point. Under the New Empire the interior of the pyramid
was rained by the forcible entry or treasure-seekers; but probably during
tlie Saite period a restoration took place. To this restoration are due the
sloping shaft and the granite chamber (i) in which the stone sarcophagus
of Menkewre Was concealed, as well as the lower-lying room with the
recesses.
