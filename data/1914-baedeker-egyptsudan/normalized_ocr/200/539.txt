two colossal statues of Thutmosis 111.; in front of the easternmost
of these stands the lower part of a large obelisk of Thutmosis Ill.

The East Tgwer in front of the N. frrtade is adorned with a figums of
Osiris (on the front of which is m inse plinn of Ramses IL added at h
later date) and a eulosm statue ofThutmosi: 11L On the West Tower are
(enumerated front left to right) a colossal statue of Thutmnsis 111. with
the double Crown, an Osiris figure of the same (its head on the ground
before it), a Heated tigure 01 .1 king of the Middle Empire, a seated figure
of sebek-lurtep, n siatue of Amenophis II, and the left half of a memorial
inscription of Huremheb.

Beside Pylon V11 is a modcru door, by which visitors usually
quit the teruple-prerrrtw, ts (comp. p. 2IM) in order to inspect the TC'-
liet's on the S. exterior walls of the great hypostyle hall (p. 272).

Beside the easternmost of' the two walls which unite Pylon V11
with Pylon V111 lies (to the left) a small mined Chapel dating from
the reign of'l'hutmosisIII. (in peripteral form; p.clxiii). Farther on,
on the same wall a representation (1' ] .c) of Ramses Ir. saeritieing.

Pylon VIII is in comparatively good preservation, although it
was built by Queen 1ratslsepsut and is thus the most ancient part
of the entire building. 1Iatshepsat's names were removed from the
reliefs by Thutmosis Ir. Sethos 1. restored the reliefs which Amen-
ophis IV. (p. 255) had destroyed; but in many cases he inserted his
own name instead of replacing those of the ancient kings.
