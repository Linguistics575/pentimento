VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART. clxxiii

arrangement of the arms and legs. If a plane be conceived as de-
scending vertically from the top ofthe skull through the face, breast,
and back, it will be found to divide the trunk into two symmetrical
halves and to form a right angle with the line of the ground; the
trunk bends neither to the rightuor to the left. Thispriucipieoffuil-
face symmetry, or'law of fronta1ity', as Julius Lange named it, is
common to the art of all primitive races, and even the Greeks did
not finally emancipate themselves from it until their plastic art had
attained its zenith. - Personages who were meant to he invested
with a certain dignity are shown standing or sitting in a quiet
posture, or even seated on the ground with their legs folded
beneath them. They are often combined in family groups. The
attendants, on the other hand, whose statues Were placed in the
grave of the deceased, are represented as indulging freely, within
rennin limits, in their usual occupations. - The art of sculpture
showed rapid signs of improvem cut at the beginning of the 4th Dym,
and reached one of its highest points in this dynasty and the rob.
lowing. Among the works of this period preserved in the Museum
of Cairo, most of which are of limestone or wood, the best are in..
dicated at pp. 82-84. In all these statues the chief stress is laid
upon a faithful reproduction of the face; the rest of the body,
especially the hands and feet, are conventionally treated. The
artist frequently imparted a curiously striking effect to his statue
by inserting eyes ofhlaek and white quartz, with a wooden or copper
stud to represent the pupil.

After aperiod of decay the art of sculpture attained, in the
MIDDLE EMPIRE, what was probably its highest perfection in the
whole course of Egyptian history. Among its masterpieces were
the fine statue of Amenemhec III, at Cairo (No,284, p. 84), and
the statues and sphinxes which were formerly attributed to the
llyksos, but which probably also represent Amencmhet III. or other
kings of the close of the 12th Dyn. (p. 85). These are marked by an
emphatic rendering of the spiritual expression, and are permeated
by an appealing seriousness. The period, however, furnishes us
also with creations of much less intrinsic value, such as the con-
ventional statues from Lisht (No.30l, p. 84), with their vacant faces.

The comparatively large number of STATUES or THE New En-
1'le which have come down to us, most of which, it is true, were
intended merely for decorative purposes, present a striking contrast
to those of the Middle Empire. Iuplace of the melancholy earnest~
ness shown by the latter we find a certain placid and attractive
eheerfulness. Examples of incomparable verisimilitude, worthy to
rank with the best productions of the earlier period, are not want-
ing. Among these may be mentioned the statue of Thntmosis Ill.
(No. 400, p. 85), the heads of Amenophis 1V. (Nos. 3610-36t2,
p. 93), tho busts of a married couple (No.745. p. 87), the heads
of King Haremheh, of the god hhons, and of the goddess Mut in
