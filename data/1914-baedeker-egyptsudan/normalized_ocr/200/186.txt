clxxx VIII. BUILDINGS OF THE MOIlAMMEDANS.

Under the Secoxn Cmcusuw Mmmmm: DYxAs'rv (i382- [ 517)
the mosque-Nader attained its zenith, and from this period date the
most elegant achievements of Arabic architecture in Egypt. The
facades assumed a more lromogeneous character; the minarets, of
enhanced elegance ever since the days of Iprhttsn, reached their
highest development; the domes, now also built of stone (see below),
were richly adorned with sculpture; and the walls, ceilings, pave-
ments, and even domestic furniture were sumptuously embellished
with mosaics, panels, carvings, and stalactites. The first dome built
of stone was that of the mosque of Barlnilc (p. 112).

The use of written characters has played l prominent part in
the decoration of Arabia buildings at all times, and the art did not
deteriorate in the latest period. Under the Tulunitles the closely
written Cufit: "baraeter was t-mployml, while under the Fuimites,
and still more under tho Aiyullitles, the letters became taller and
more sll'nder. The letters themselves and the spares between them
were embellished with aruhesquc ornamentation. Under the Aiyu-
hides the cursive eharartec known as Nuxkhi was used also; and the
t'riezes of intertwined letters dating from the period of the Mame-
lukes frequently rise to the dignity of works of art.

We "may now proceed to an examination of the special kinds of
buildings, beginning with the RELIGIOUS EDLFICES.

Mosques are of two kinds, the Gami', lit. an assemlnly for
prayer, and Meagid, the place where the knee is bent for prayer.
The oldest mosques are very simple in plan (comp. the plan of the
mosque of lhn'l'nl6n, p. 72). Around a quadrilateral court (SaZm),
corresponding to the atrium of a Byzantine basilica, lie four flat-
roofetl colonuatles fthMsrs), used for prayers. The Chief Lttctn or
Sanctuary, placed on the side next Mecca, has usually four OI tie
aisles, the others never more than two. The Cnvmmmi Mosqun,
A new form invented in Persia, was introduced into Egypt about the
end of the 12tll rent. by the Aiyuhide Snlatliu. This was developed
from the previous simple form by the construction of additional
chambers at the four corners of the liwins, in such a way that the
liw√©ns, now covered with massive Waggon-vaults, formed the four
arms of a cross. Comp. the plan of the Sultan FJasan mosque (p. 67).
These liwins were used as selurol-rooms, whence arose the name
Nedreseh, or'school-mosque'. - Towards the close of the Mameluke
supremacy still another form arose, used, however, only for small
mosques. The side-liwins were shortened and the central court so
contracted that it could be roofed over and lighted from the top.
The four arms of the cross were covered with Mt wooden roofs, like
the celonnades in the original form of mosque, while the Wl1ggori-
vaulting was represented merely by a transverse rib on the side next
the court (comy. the plan of the mosque of Iprit Bey, p. IU),

With the conquest of Egypt by the Turks under Selim I. (1517),
the Turkish-Byzantine style ofarehitaeture also made its appearance
