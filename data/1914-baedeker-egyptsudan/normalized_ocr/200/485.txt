Temple of Ramvs 11. ABYDOS. M, Route. 243

A few minutes to the N. of the Temple of Snthos 1., partly
beneath the modem village, lies a Temple of Ramses L, and close
by is the Temple of Ramses IL, which also was dedirated to Osiris
and the cult of the deceased king. The latter temple is in'd very
ruinous state but still presents many futures of interest. The
scanty traces of a spacious court may he made but in front of the
present entrance. Within, the grouml- lan of a peristyle roun
(dvcorated with pillars and figares ot" Osiris, like the lhuuesseum,
p. 307), two balls, the saiuytnativs beyond them, and various other
rooms can still be traced; but the average height of the remaining
walls is only 5-6 ft. To judge by the extant remains, this temple
was a much more sumptuous aml more carefully built structure
than any of the other buildings of Ramses ll. known to us, Not
only thrs-grained limestone, but also red and black granite (tor the
vloor-frames), sandstone (for the columns) 7 and alabaster tfor the
innermost shrine) were used. The still brilliantly coloured mural
decorations in tho rear rooms tICC, in'lelieate low relief recalling the
admirable sculptures under Sethos 1.; the ruder reliefs'en ereux'
occur only in the, court and the tirst hall, with the adjoining won Â»:

On the outside of the temple (N. andW. sides) is an inscription relating
to the war waged by anse: TI. against the Jlittites; unfortunately Only the
lower parts of the lines are preserved. Adjacent (the representations nf

the building of the temple ttad its endowments.

To the N.W. of the Temple of Ramses H. lies the ruin of Shrine!
ea-Zebib, surrounded try two walls. It has been supposed to be an
ancient fortress but is more probably a tomb.

A few hundred yards to the NE. of'Rluinet cz-Zebib, near the
village of F2-klserbels, lie the ruins of the ancient city of Abydos
and of the Sanctuary of Osiris, dating back to the beginning of Egyp-
tian history. The enclosing walls, built of brick in the Middle Em-
pine, and some smuty traces of the tmnplo are extant.
