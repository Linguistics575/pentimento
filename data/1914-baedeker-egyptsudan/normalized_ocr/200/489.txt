DENDERA. m. Route. 245

Derulera, the Tmlym of the Greeks, is one of the most ancient
and most famous cities of Egypt, and was the capital of the sixth
name ofUpper Egypt. Its ancient name was End, or Eneb-te-ntiire,
'Erset oftlxe Goddess' (i.e. of Hathor), of which the Greek and mod-
em Arabic names are eotcuptions. Enet was the chief seat of the
worship of liathor (the Egyptian Aphrodite), goddess of love and
Joy. Along with her husband. the falcon-headed Horus of Edfu.
and her son, the youthful Ehi or Har-sem-tewe t'Horas, unite: of
both Jamis'; Cr. Harsomtus; comp. p. Md), she was worshipped in
the magnifieent temple which remains here to this day. Her chief
festival synchronized with the great feast of the New Year.

The gate, to which our road leads and where the cards of ad-
mission (see p. 200) are shown, forms the N. termination of the
wall of Nile bricks enclosing the temple. The total enclosure is
317 yds. long and 306 yds. wide, and besides the large Temple
of Hathor contains a small Temple of Isis and a so-ealled Birth
House (p. 250). The N. Gale was built under the Emp. Domitian,
who is here named Germanicus. On the side next the temple
appear the names of Nerva and Trajanus, also with the epithet of
Germanicus (Trajan is here also called Dacicus). There is another
similar gate (now much sanded up) on the E. side; while beyond
the temple-preeincts, also to the E., is a third gate, dating from
the Roman Imperial epoch. _ Straight in front of the N. gate
lies the -

"Temple of Hathor, the orientation of which is praetieally N.
and s. Though still partly buried in the accumulated rubbish ot'
aenturies, this temple is in better preservation than any other an-
cient Egyptian trunple except those of 1hlfu and Philm. It was
built in the first century ll.CI. during the reigns ot the later i'tolemies
and of Augustus; but it occupies the site of an older ediiiee, going
back traditionally to the period of the Ancient Empire, and added
to or altered not only by the kings of the 12th Dyn., but also by
the great monarchs of the New Empire, such as Thutmosis Ill.,
Ramses Ir., and Ramses III. The decoration of the temple-walls
with reliefs went on to a still more recent date. In accordance
with the plan of other temples (comp, Plan of MIN, p. 344) a
colounade and two large pylons should stand in front of the great
vestibule; but perhaps the means to add these were not forth-
"orning. If we compare the temple of Dendera with a similar strue-
ture of the earlier period, such as the temple of Abydos L1). 238)
or the great national saaetuary of Karnak (p. 265), we rind it not
less beautiful in its own way, though of course far from competing
with these gigantic structures in magnitbrerree or extent. Its chief
characteristics are a line symmetry of proportions and dignified adap-
tation to its purposes. Neither the figures nor the inscriptions
sculptured on the walls compare in mastetly execution with those
in the tombs of the Antient Empire or with those in temples dating
