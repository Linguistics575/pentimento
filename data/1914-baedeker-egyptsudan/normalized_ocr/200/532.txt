272 Route 20. THEBES (M. BANK). 2. Ix'ttmuk:

The reliefs on the outside of the s. WALL (Pl. g, h) commem-
orate in similar Fashion the Syrian campaigns of Ramses IL, ohieily
those against the Hittites, but they are best visited after seeing
the rest of the temple buildings, from the door beside the seventh
pylon (comp. p. 279). At the W. ead of this Wall, on the outside of
the S. tower of the second pylon, is the TRIUMPHAL INSGRIPTION op
SEOSEENK 1. (the Shishult of the Bible). This commemorates the
victory won by Shishak mer Rehoboam, son of Solomon, King of
Judah. The large form of Amen appears to the left, grasping in
his right hand the sword of victory and in his left cords binding the
rows of captured towns in Palestine, each of which is represented
by a circular wall enclosing its name, beneath the upper part of a
lettered prisoner. The curved noses, prominent clmsk-bones, and
pointed beards of the captives clearly identify them as Semitic.
Beneath Amon appears the goddess of the Theban Home, with the

name of the name [' upon her bead. She holds a club, bow, and

quiver, and leads iiviy rows of captives with cords. To the right
Shishak is seen grasping a group of cowering Semites by the hair
and smiting them with his club. The figure of Shishak was left 110-
ihtislyad.

The Biblical passe es referring to the campaign are 1 Kings xiv. 25, 26
and 2 Chron. xii. 2- 2 9. or the name-lahels only a few can be
identified with certainty with otherwise known names or places in Pal,
estine, such as Rahbath (last ring of the iirst cow), Taauauls, Shnuem,
Rehab, Haphraim, Mehenaim, Gibson, Bsth-Horuu, Kedsmoth, Ajalon
tin the second row). The rest of the inscriptions, which are couched
in the usual bombastic style, give no further information as to the
ciuupaign.

0n the projecting wall to the E. of the S. side-door is an in-
scription containing the Treaty of Peace concluded with the prince
of the Hittitcs hy Ramses H. in the 2lst year of his reign. -At
PL i, beyond the projecting wall, we see Ramses II. leading two
rows of captives before Amen. Beneath is the poetical account of
the Hittite campaign (the se-called Epic of Peutanr). At Pl. k, on
the end of the wall (beside the closed S.E. door of the hypostyle
hall), we tind a relief of Ramses II. presenting to Amon the cap-
tives and costly vessels taken in the Syrian campaigns.

The Third Pylon, built by Ameuophis III. and now completely
ruined, forms the rear wall of the great hypestyle court, into which
its Vestibule still projects. 0n the rear of the S. tower (Pl. o is a
long inscription (unfortunately imperfect at the top), recording the
gifts of Amenophis m. to the god Amou; and on the rear of the
N. tower (Pl. m) are seen the last remnants of a larger represent-
ation "a festal voyage, in the shape of a sacred bark of Amou
With the king on board and another fully manned ship.
