the deceased and his wife seated at a meal in an arbour, with their
son before them. On the left wall of the tomb of Khunes are inter-
esting representationsoiEgyptian craftsmen, bakers, putters, metal-
workers beside a furnace, brewers, leather-warkers, etc. The two
last-named tombs were used as dwellings by Coptic monks, who
have added various inscriptions. - Then follow the tomb of Klie-
nuszw (sanded up) and the Tomb of Hnrhhuf, with inscriptions of
great historical importance. These inscriptions appear outside the
tomb, on each side of the entrance, above and beside iigures of the
deceased (to the left, Harkhuf leaning on a long staff with his
son holding a censer in front of him). The inscriptions form an
extract from the biography of Iiarkhuf, recording especially four
successful trading expeditions to Nubia, three of which were made
in the reign of Merenre (6th Dyn.) and one in that of King Nefer-
ke-ré (Phiops IL), the successor of Merenré. Among the goods
brought back on the fourth journey was a dwarf.

_ Adjoining is the small tomb of Pyopi-nakht (No. 35; sanded up),
with important inscriptions on each side of the doorway. These
extol the exploits "the deceased in the campaigns led by King
Neier-1re-Nii (Phiope H.) against Nubia and the Bedlrins dwelling tn
the E. of Egypt. Farther on are the grave of Semnase and flnally
the interesting tomb CNo. 336) of Si-nnpowet, son of Sat-zeni, who
flourished in the reign ofSesostris I. (12th Dym). A doorway of fing
limestone, with portraits of the deceased, admits to the Court. The
shafts of the six pillars, whieh here supported the roof ofa colonnade,
hear inscriptions and figures of the deceased. 0n the Rack Wall, to
the left of the door, is a large ilgisris of the deceased followed by his
sandal-bearer and two dogs; cattle are being brought to him (notice
the enraged bulls); he appears in a boat spearing tish. To the right
of the door is a large ilguris of the deceased fallowed by his bow-
hearer, a dog, and his three sons. Above, the deceased is shown
seated in a calonnade, with fourwomen with flowers in front ofhim;
below are a woman and two men gambling. Within the tomb is a
small Hall, with four pillars. The mural paintings on stucco are
unfortunately much injured. At the foot ofthe walls river-scenes are
shown and on the pillars are grannies (with scribes registering the
amount of grain), brewing, and weaving. A vaulted corridor leads
hence to a second Hall with pillars and a recess. - From this tomb
we may descend to the river-bank, passing several small tombs. _
Higher up than the tombs are the remains of a Coptic convent.

The summit of the hill, which, however, is not reached without
some dimeultr, is crowned by the Kubbet el-Hawa, the small tomb
of a sheikh. It commands a very i1niy view (especially by full
moon) of the Nile valley, the district of the cataracts, and the
desert. - From this point we mar reach the convent of St, Simeon
in M) min., by a route leading to the S.S, W.
