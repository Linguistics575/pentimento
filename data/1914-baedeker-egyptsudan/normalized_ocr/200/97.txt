which are considered sacred, having been placed there by devout
persons or by those who have made vows. About the end of the,
18th century a reaction against the abuses of Islam sprang; up in
Central Arabia. The Wahabis, named after their founder Ulbd
el- 11Uld/tb, endeavoured to restore the religion to its original pur-
ity; they destroyed all tombs of saints, including even those of
Mohammad and 1Josein, as objects of superstitious reverence, and
sought to restore the primitive simp|icity of the proplrer's code of
morals. As a political power, however7 they were suppressed by
Mohammed Ali o. cxxi).

Another development quite foreign to the original spirit of
lslim is that of the RELIGIOUS Ummns ('J'urulc, sing. Turtlcu), or
Orders of Dervishes. Starting with the Christian doctrine of as-
enticism Unence Danvish, litkir, poor man, 512/2, man in a woollen

yagita) and subsequently also Buddhist ideas. Even the Buddhist
nirvana was adopted under the form of fund, the destruction of
individuality. As a natural consequence pantheistic and other
hcresies found their way into Islirn. The orthodox party long
opposed the recognition of tho mystics, and mysticism did not effect
its footing until the time of the celebrated philosopher (nuszsi'sri.
To-day all those orders that accept the formula, of the faith and the
received doctrine of religious duties are recognized as orthodox.
Each order has its own fixed system, with an ascending series of
degrees. A man may reach the lower degrees in several different
orders, the higher degrees in one only. A member enters an order
with a view to obtain a share in the blessings of eertain forms,
which have been consecrated by the founder of the order and are
maintained in its traditions, The: iltrs, or religious exercises, are

represent in the East the religious and other associations of Europe;
and this fart is the key to their signiiieanee. They are more im-
portant economically than politically, though great political move-
ments, even in rerent thues, have been brought about by organi-
zations resembling these orders, as, age, the insurrection of the
Mahdi at Khartysin. The original orders Were few, but numerous
subdivisions have in course of time established themselves on an
independent footing. In Egypt all the, orders are under the control
of the Shah ]: el-Bekri, who is the political representative of their
interests and presides at public iumstiotts.
