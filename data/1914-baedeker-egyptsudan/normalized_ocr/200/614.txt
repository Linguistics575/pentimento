The river-banks are picturesquely elm } with extensive groves ol
palms, but the smoking chimneys ot' the sitvr-faetories interfere
with the beauty of the scenery. The steamer passes the Barrage of
Esneh by means of a lock (262 ft. long) next the W. bank. The bar-
rage was constructed in 1906-9 by Messrs. John Aird & 00. (p. 372)
at a cost. 0fÂ¥E 1,000,000. It is 955 yds. long, 20 ft. broad at the
top, and rises 30 ft. above the Nile at its lowest. its 120 sluices
are intended mainly to regulate the irrigation of the province of

boat to Luxor, see p. 2521. Esueh, Which in antiquity adjoined the
town ofEnil, Was one of the most important places in Upper Egypt.
Its Egyptian name was Te-snEL whence name the Coptic Sne and

a kind of fish venerated here. Esneh is now a distriet-capital with

and numerous e0ffee-houses. The hltittirtyeh, Post Office, Tribunal
8ortvnaire (with the telegraph oftiee), and other public buildings
stand in the street skirting the Nile. On the old quay, near the
mmliriyeh, are some fragmentary inscriptions and the remains ol a
uilometer of the Roman imperial epoch. A road leading to the right
from the river-bank br.ings us to the chief object of interest, still to
a large extent buried in dibris, viz. the i

*TEMPLE DP KuNUM, the ram-headed local deity, associated with
whom were Neith (iderrtuled by the Greeks with Athena) and Satet.
The extant edifiees were built in the Ptoiemaie period and extended
and embellished with inscriptions and reliefs by various Roman
emperors. The fagade,120 ft. wide and 50 ft. high, is turned towards
the E. and is crowned by a concave cornice, in which stand the
names of Claudius and Vespasian. On the aceltitrave below, on each
side of the winged sum-disk, are the votive inscriptions of these em-
perors. Vespasian is referred to as lord of'llome the capital'. The
vestibule, Which belongs almost entirely to the Roman imperial
epoch, is the only portion that has been excavated as far as the pave-
ment. It corresponds in arrangement to the promos of the temple
of Hathor at Dendem (p. 246); it is 108 ft. broad and "ft. deep.
The roof, Whirh is embellished with astronomical representations,
is home by 24 columns (in 4 rows), with elaborate horal capitals
and decorated with reliefs and inscriptions. Each column is 37 ft.
high and IT'h ft. in circumference; the first six are connected by
stone screens. - The walls are covered with four rows ofrepresenta-
tions, showing emperors in the costume of the Pharaohs before the
various gods ofEsueh. In the middle of the Rear Wall (W.) a pol"
tal (now built up) 7 resembling a pylon and crowned with a concave
cornice, gave access to the inner parts ofthe temple. The reliefs and
inscriptions upon it date from the reign ofPtolemy VI. Philometor.
