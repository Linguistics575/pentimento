marks on p. 284. After the beginning of the 18th Dyu. the Pharaohs
also ceased to build pyramids as theiriast resting-piaces, and pre-
pared their tombs in the slopes of a sequestered mountain-valley
on the W. bank of the Nile near Thebes. These ROYAL Tomas "
THE thsw EMPIRE comprised long corridors and hails, the walls of
which were occupied by religious inscriptions and scenes (comp.
p. 284). Like the passages within the pyramids, these were exclu-
sively destined for the reception of the sarcophagus, while the
rock itself represented the pyramid built over the grave. Since
there was no room among the mountains for mortuary temples, the
latter were built (usually on a large scale) on the plain, where their
ruins remain to this day.

The grandees "the late period followed the example of their
predecessors under the Middle Empire by imitating the tombs of
the Pharaohs in preparing their own private graves. This was the
case in Thebes at least. At Asasif (p. 305) near Thebes we find in
their tombs a complicated series of corridors and hails, the walls of
which are decorated with nothing but religious texts and representa-
tions. Unfortunately none of the royal tombs of the last native
dynasty have as yet been discovered; these musthave lain near the
large capitals in the Delta. liren of the larger private tombs of this
epoch few have been found, with the exception of those at Thebos
and a few others at Gizeh and Salclpirs.

The Tosum or THE "UMBLBK CLASSES must, of course, have
largely outnumbered those of the grandees; but beyond the pits
which contained the bodies, and some gravestoues, they have iei't
no traces. From pictures we know that under the New Empire they
were frequently in the form of small brick pyramids; but nearly
all have fallen victims to time. The poorer classes were frequently
buried in Comm): Tomts, constructed by speculators in ruined tem-
ples or in long corridors underground. In these the corpses were
laid in plain eofthrs (sometimes merely on planks or mats made of
the iiinms of palm-leaves), accompanied by simple gifts for their use
in the future world. But these common graves are now almost all
covered by drift sand, and all trace of them is lost.

2. Sculpture and Painting.

Na fair estimate of the achievements of Egyptian sculpture
or of its masters can be obtained from a study of the ordinary co-
lossal statues, sphinxes, and temple-re1ieis; for these, though they
are now the most conspicuous examples of Egyptian sculpture,
were, with few exceptions, exclusively decorative and were exe-
rutcd by artisans rather than by artists. For such an estimate an
acquaintance must be obtained with works produced by genuine
artists, such as the portrait statues and reliefs now preserved in the
Museum of Cairo, and the reliefs on the walls of maetahas, of rock
