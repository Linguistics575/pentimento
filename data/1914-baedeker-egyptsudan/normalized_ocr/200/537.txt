Northern Buildings. THISBES (k. BANK). 20. Route. 277

The southernmost and Ingest of these ehnpetswas built towards the
close or the 26th Dyn. by the majordomo Peteneit. In the doorway we
see Psammetichos UL and Princess 1s'ukh-rsernefer-ebiCs in presence of
Anion and other gods. Beyond is a hall built of brick, with (our stone
columnst To the right or the entrance to the eauctnnry it Nitoeris, wife
at Parrmmeriehog IL, to the left is Amasis. - The central chapel watt
erected by a court of6cial named Shoshenk in the reign of Amasis, who
is represented on the left jamh or the esstrance-door. On the right jam }.
is Princess Eilkhoertuster-eb-rre, to whose household Shushenk belonged.
The walls or this chapel are of brick, with the exception of the gates,
the eoiumns or the court, and the sanctuary, which are of stone, - The
northern chapel, the oldest, was built in the reign of Tlharkl (25th Dru.),
who, along with the princess 8uepenupet, appears on the walls.

The *Temple of Ptah, patron-god of Memphis, was built by
Thutmosis III. and enlarged and restored by Shahako the Ethiopian
and by several of the Ptolemies.

As we lpproach mm the w., we reach live successive t7etetsays, of
which the second and fourth CPI. a and b) Were built by Shabako, whose
names have been scratched out, the others by' Ptolemy. Farther on is a
Porch, enclosed by two columns (with rich foliage capitals) connected
by a stone acreeni The small Pylon beyond the porch has a portal hearing
the name of Thutmosis Ill, restored in the Ptolemaic period. This
admits to a Caurt (PL cl, em'heuished at the back with a porlicus sup-
ported by two sixteen-sided columns. Two altar-bases or red granite smut
here, dedicated by Amenetht I. and Thntmosis m. In the walls are
ancient recesses. A staircase ascends to the upper story. A doorway
(with restored reliefs of Thutmosia IH.) in the main axis of the temple
leads into the Sanctuary, which retains the original reliefs or Thutmosis 111.
Here stands the image of Ptah, which is illuminated with weird ethtet
through an aperture in the ceiling (the modern wooden door should he
closed) To the right is a. room with a. statue of the lion-headed goddess
Sekhmet; to the left, another with a well-preserved ceiling and ancient
relief: of Thutmosis HI. - It is instructive to observe the diffetrenee in style
between the ancient and the restored reliefs.

To the SE. of the Temple of Ptah, on the way to the Temple
of Osiris (p. 276), is a Storehouse, built by the Ethiopian Shabako,
consisting of a single hail home by 12 columns. Round the brick
walls run stone tables on which the gaerificial gifts were laid.

From the Temple of Ptah we pass through a gatcin the N. girdle
wall of the Temple of Anion and reach the North Temple Pre-
cincts, which are surrounded by a girdle-wall of brick. Hero stands
the Tmu-Lh or MONT, which is now so ruined and covered with
rubbish that its ground-plan can scarcely be made out. The temple
was built for the war-god Mont by Amenophis 111. (18th Dyno,
though it was subsequently several times enlarged and restored
between the reign of Ramses II. and the epoch of the Ptolemies.
The earlier sealpturiss and architectural fragments are of great
beauty. Two ohelisks of red granite once stood in front of the N.
entrance, of which the bases and some fragments are still extant.
The N. gateway of the N. temple-precincts, built of sandstone,
dates from Ptolemy Euergetes. - In the girdle-wall to the S. of
the Temple of Mont is a gate adorned with the name of NektartetCcs
(Nekht-llar-eh1m; y. cvii).

From the sandstone gateway we proceed to the 8.W., passing the
remains of a Ptolemaie Temple (not yet freed from subbish), of
