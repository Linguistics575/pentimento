Behind the anessenm especially towards the N.W., are the remain:
or a number of extensive In-iek Buildings, eome of which were erected in
the time ufRameee Ir., "we learn from the ethmpe on the bricks. Among
the reet are hhme weH-constructed vaults, originally covered by e plat-
form. From the fragments or wiue-jm and the stoppers found here we
may reasonably conclude that these were store-i-unms in connect' ll with
the temple. Adjacent is an altar, resembling (hal eineii- sl-Bat i (p, 303).
--To the w., adjoining the brick vaults, me the mine are large rectangular
Hall, the ceiling ofwhich was home by 32 Columns (the stumps of twelve
of them still remain).

About 500 paces to the N.E, of the b'amesseum we reach the Marlutzry
Temple of Thutmosi, 111., protected by It modern enclosing wall. Its ancient
girdle-walls are partly hewn out of the rock and partly built of crude
bricks. The inner chambers are in a vei-y dilapidntud cundition, hut we
can Mill recognize traces ofllypostyle halls, brick chambers, etc. Many of
the bricks bear the name of the royal builder. - Between the aneaseum
and this temple of Thutmneie lay the Horluary Pemples "Arnerurphis fl.
(18th Dyn.) and Siplah (19th Dyn.1 the scanty remains of which were
discovered by Flinders Petrie in'iigf. - Farther to the N.E., not far from
Furaa, are the remains of the Morltmry Temple of Arneaophis f.

To the S, of the Ramenseum were similar temples of Prtnl: Wezmtzu
(18th Dyn.), Thutmotit m, Queen Tewmet (wire at Siptah; p. 291), and
King Amencphthes (3ferenptah; p. 2871, an of which were explored by Flin-
ders Petrie in 1896; but the remains of these are very scanty.

To the W. of the Ramesseum, on the way to Deir irl-Meiltneh,
lies the German House (Arab. Kaer Alrndnvea), erected by Emperor
William II. as a lodging for the German savants at Thebes.

T. The Tombs of Shaikh'Abd eLKnrna.

The Rom Tamil OF SHEIKH'Ama ee-Kmm, situated in the hill behind
the Ramesseum belong himnst excluet'veiy to high dignitaries of the
period of the t√©th Dynasty. The majority ceneiet of two parts: a wide
nan "Festibuk, with e roof frequently home by pillars "columns, and
a Corridor, ending in a recess in Which the statues "the deceased and
his favourite relatives were erected. Not unfreqnemly there is a small
chamber on each side of the corridur. In front at the tomb Was it kind
of forecourt, where oifering8 were made to the dead. As the limestone
of the hilt of Sheikh rAbd engine is of poor quality, ill adapted for
sculpture, the walls of most of the tombs were covered with clay, then
whitewtrshed, and adorned with paintings. The representations on the
side-walls cf the hall depict the deceased in his earthly circumstances
and duties, and thua shed a Mod of light upon Egyptian life of the
New Empire in its heyday, The end~walla tto the right and left) of the
hall are, as a rule, shaped like huge grave-strmer, one usually bears
prayers for the dead, while on the otherig recorded the biography of the
deceased. The representations on the Walls of the corridors illustrate the
various funeral rites.

The more important tombs, which tie on the n. and N. sides of the
hill, have heen enclosed within a wall; they are numbered and are
provided with doors, which are opened by the custodian. Some o? the
tombs are not accessible to the general huhiie, and to v it theee per-
mission must he ubuined from the Inspector General at Lllxor, - Some
of the tomhe that contain no inscriptions are inhahitetl by the poorer
tenahtn, while the forecourls serve for their 1tvestoek. In front of most
of theee cave-dwellinga eteha covered cylinders like gigantic mushrooms,
of Nile mud and straw kneaded together. These are primitive grauaries,
while their tlat roofs serve as sleep' g places

If time is limited, it will be sufficient to visit the lambs ormsktunerrs,
Seunofer, Amenemheh, hhhe, Remote. and Nehht.
