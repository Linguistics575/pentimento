broad. Indeed there is scarcely a building in Egypt that has so
frequently been destroyed by water, tire, and earthquake, and that
has been so regularly rebuilt.

The interior exhibits the usual plan of a court surrounded hy
eolonnades, and in spite of its imperfect state (the N. and S.
colonnades are represented by the column-bases only) its mere size
produces a certain effect. The columns, all of marble of various
kinds, were once 366 in number. Their heterogeneous nature is
accounted for hy the fact that they were brought from Roman and
Byzantine buildings in Cairo.

The faqades of the Court (Saint) have no pretensions to an-
tiquity; the arches are, of an unusually clumsy shape. In the centre
of the court, which is now planted with trees, is a l.uurrrh" yels; the
deep well is popularly ht-liexcd to have a connection with a well
in Mecca. The 8otttlv-Eattern Lhvuhs is the sanctuary. In front
of the pulpit, within an iron railing, is a column of grey marble,
on whiclt, by a freak of nature, the names ofAllah, Mohammed,
and Sultan Suleiman in Arabic characters, and the outline of the
prophet's'kurbatsir' appear in veins of a lighter eolour. This
column is believed by the Moslems to have been transported mi-
raculously from Mecca to Cairo by the Caiiph Omar. In the N.E.
corner is the tomb of Sheikh Abdallah, son of Amr. In the N.W.
center is a recess with two low columns; the blood-stains on the
top are caused by patients in search of health, who here rub their
tongues until they bleed. In the W. eolonnade, which consists of
a single row of columns only, is a Pair of Columns, placed very close
together, and it is said that none but honest men could squeeze
themselves between them.

This moique is almost disusedt On the mt Friday in the month of
fasting, however, a solemn service is annually held here, in which the
thdive trad his grandees take part. 0n the remaining Fridays throughout
the year a handful of poor Moslcms, mostly of the working classes, hssemhle
for worship in the venerable bat poorly preserved summery. - In JSOB
this mosque witnessed a very remevkabie scene. The whole uf the Me-
hammedau priesthood, the Christian clergy of every seat, and the Jewish
rabbis, with one accord, assembled in the mosque qumr to pray for the
rise of the Nile, which had delayed beyond the usual period.

Near the Mosque of Amr are several Kulla Manufaclories, in
which the process of making the porous water-jars [ Arabic Kulla,
pl. Ku'lal) used throughout Egypt may he seen. The chief seat at
inanuhw, tnre is, however, Keneh (p. 222). The material is a light-
grey clay; the remarkably delivate porosity of the vessels is pro-
duced by mixing the clay with ashes. The rapid evaporation caused
by the porosity of the hulla cools the liquid within to a tempera-
ture of 1'2-1iorahr. lower than that of the surrounding air. _ To
