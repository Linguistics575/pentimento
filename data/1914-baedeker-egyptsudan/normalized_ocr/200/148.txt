revealed themselves. Thus Saba ]: appears as a man with a erocodile's
head, Kfmum with a rarn's head, Thom with an ibis's head, Ilorm
with a faleon's head, etc. The various Cow Goddesses have a
human head with cow's horns, while over the vulture goddess
Mut (worshipped in Thebes)'d vulture spreads its wings, and the
head of Neith of Sais was adorned with a bundle of arrows, which
was the form in which she was worshipped. Though such a device
cannot but appear strange to us as it did to the Greeks, it must
