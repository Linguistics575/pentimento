ftrle and almost Caucasian cast uf features, their very dark, bronze <
coloured complexion, and their luxuriant growth of hair, which they
wear loose or hanging down in numberless plaits. Their figures are
heautifnllysg mmetrieal, and more or less slender in accordance with
their means ofsubsistenee, and their limbs are gracefully formed.
In other respects they resemhle all the other children of the desert,
ns in the purity of their complexion, the peculiar thinness of their
necks, and the prematum wrinkling of the skin of their fates. Cem-
pared with their bold and quarrelsome neighbours the Wishirin, the
rAirahleir are generally gentle and iuofltmsive,

lesides the Bega there are numerous i'mduins who inhabit the
Steppes and deserts belonging to the region of the Nile, but beyond
the limits of l'lgypt, and range as far as the eouiines of the heathen
negre-ruees on the left bank of the Nile, nearly to SP N. latitude;
but with these we have not at present to deal. As regards the
Iletluins proper of the N., their common home, the desert, seems
to have exerted a unifying effect upon races that wore originally
different, and the peculiar characteristics of each have gradually
disappeared before the uniform environment of all.

There are three important Beduin tribes in the peninsula of
Mount Sinai: the Terribiyin; the Ttyo/ur, who occupy the heart of
the peninsula, between Suez and'Ahaha; and the Suwrirlceh er It'l-
"Amyish, to the north of the letter. In Upper Egypt, besides the
r \bihdeh, the most important tribes who occupy the eastern bank or'
the Nile are, the Beui Wart and the Atwtni, who, however, have now
settled on both banks of the 1'hoban Nile valley and are, gradually
Mending with the fellahin, and the Mu'tizch. who dwell in groups
among the limestone mountains between Sue), and KenehY where
there are good pastures at plaees. Most of the Arabian Beduins, on
the other hand, who belong to Egypt, eoniine themselves to the
westemhank of the Nile.'l'hey occupy the whole of this side of the
river from the Faiyrim as far as Abydos near Girgeh, and it is mainly
with their aid that e0nurrur1ieati0n is maintained with the western
oases, peopled by a totally diremyut race, who till the ground and
possess no camels, being probably allied to the Berbers of Northern
Africa (one of the numerous Libyan tribes mentioned in ancient
inscriptions). A

The Beduius of the North, and especially the tribe of the Ullld
'Ali, have inherited with comparative purity the tiery blood of the
rlcsert-tribes, who achieved such marvellous exploits under the
hanuer of the prophet, but the traveller will rarely come in contact
with them unless he undertakes a journey across the desert. The
Beduins who assist travellers in the ascent of the pyramids belong
to the Nag'ama tribe. Genuine Beduins are to be found nowhere
except in their desert home1 where to a great extent they still retain
the spirit of independenee, the courage, and the restlessness of their
ancestors. As in the time, of Herodotus, the tent of the Ileduin is
