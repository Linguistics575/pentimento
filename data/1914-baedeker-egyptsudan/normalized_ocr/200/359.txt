The three largest Pyramids of Abugir, erected by kings of the
5th Dyn., stand close together, about 1 M. to the SAV. of the sauc-
tuary of Abu Gur√©b (comp. the Inset Plan II at p.145). They wexe
explored in 1002-8 by the German Oriental Society under Dr. Boe
chanlt. The masonry of these monuments, having originally been
constructed with no great care' is now much damaged. The entran-
ces are on the N. sides, and the interior chamhers are almost Corn-
pletely in ruins.'

The northernmost of the pyramids is the PYRAMID or KING
SEIIUEE. Its perpendicular height was 1623/4ft. (uow11e1), its
sides were 257 ft. (now 216 ft.) in length, and they were inclined
at the angle of 5i" 42'l35". (In the R. side of the pyramid lie
the extensive remains of the Mortuary Temple, to which a slightly
sloping causeway ascended from the small temple in the valley. The
long vestibule oh the R. side of the temple opens into a passage,
which surrounds the following court on the ll, N., and S. sides.
The large C'olonnaded Cami, the centre of the building, possesses
a well-preserved pavement ofbleck basalt. Fragments of the sixteen
granite palm-columns (p. clxi l, whielt once supported the roof of the
colonuade around the walls of the court, are scattered about. The
court is arljoined by a Transverse Room, which practically forms the
W. side of the above-mentiouvd pits. ge, and by a Room with Five
Recesses, in which stood statues of the king. A sirle-0or on the left
admits to the narrow passages leading to the Sanctuary, in which, at
the foot of the pyramid, stood the large door-shaped stele. Among
the other apartments we may note the Storerooms (or the Saerifre'urb
rrfferings, .1 series or two-storied chambers on the s. side, and um
two-storied Treasuries on the N. side. At the SE. angle of the
pyramid, in a separate court with a side-entrance ilauled by two
tree-tmnk columns (p. clviii), stands the small Queen's Pyramid.

Next, to the S., is the PYRAMID OF NvsmtRrr., to which an easy
winding path ascends Cline panorama). It, too, had a mortuary temple
ou the Fl side. From the plain a sloping causeway ascends to the
main entrance and the foreman", on eanh side of which lie store-

about. The following chambers, extending to the N. at the base of
the pyramid, are in a very ruinous state. To the N. of the temple are
some large Mceyshas of the time of the 5th Dynasty. At the SE.
corner of the pyramid is a smaller pyramid, perhaps that ot' the
