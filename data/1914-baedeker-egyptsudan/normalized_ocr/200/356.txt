138 Route & PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH. Campbell's Tomb.

connected with it (p. 132). We follow the W. side of the Pyramid.
0n the rock to the right is another hieroglyPhie inscription (Pl. f)
by the above-mentioned Me'i, near Which are several mek-tomhs.
One of these (Pl. "that of sYeb-errt-yekliet, nearly opposite the
SW. angle of the Pyramid, has a tine ceiling hewn in the rock in
imitation of palm-steals.

Our route now leads towards the S.W. to the Third Pyramid
(p. 133). To the s. of it stand three small Pyramids, belonging to
near relatives of King Mykerinos.

We now turn to the remains of the mortuary temple to the E. of
the Third Pyramid and descend towards the E. by the ancient trailse-
way o. 124). Here, on the left, is another series of roek-tomhs dat-
ing from the 4th and 5th Dynasties. Among these is that of Tebehm
LPI. b), with several chambers and recesses. This is now closed by
a wooden door and is regarded as the sacred tomb of Sidi Hamed
Sam'Ã©n. Numerous villagers assemble here an Friday for religions
exercises.

In the valley before us, to the right, rises a projecting ridge of
rock containing tombs of no interest. Adjoining this rock, on the
left, is a picturesque Arab cemetery. Still farther to the E. we ob-
serve the remains of a wall (perhaps the ancient town-wail), with
a gateway. - After passing a high mound of dibris, consisting
of a pyramidal mess of masonry on a projecting rock and supposed to
be the remains of an Imeompleted pyramid, we come to other tombs
on the left, likewise covered with sand. Among these is the tomb
of Wer-khewew CPI. k), a judge under the 5th Dynasty.

We now proceed to the left (N.) to Campbell's Tomb, a family
tomb of the 26th Dyn., discovered by COLVyse in 1837 and named
by him after Colt Campbcil, the British consul-general in Egypt at
that period. The upper part, the magtaha proper, has been entirely
destroyed, and the shaft (53 ft. deep), at the bottom of Which is
a tornb-rthamber vaulted with an arch having a span ofll ft., is now
uncoveredt The sides of the shaft are separated from the surround-
ing rock by a trench, which is spanned by bridges of stone at only a
few points. The sarcophagus which stands in the tomh-ehamher
contained the remains of the royal scribe Pe-kop "hh-eb-rg-em-
yelthet, 2t contemporary of King Apries. Beside the saeophagus
lies a stone lid shaped like a mummy. In niches in the S. and W.
sides of the shaft are two other sarcophagi; a fourth sarcophagus
found here is now in the British Museum. All these sarcophagi had
been opened and plundered. For a description of the similar tombs
from the Persian period, see p. 166.

We return past the Sphinx (p. 135) and the Valley Temple Of
Ekephrets (p. 1351 to the Great Pyramid and the three small pyra-
mids lying in front of it to the E.

We may now proceed to the E. to the verge of the desert-plateau,
in the direction of the Arab village of Kafr el-Haram, in order to
