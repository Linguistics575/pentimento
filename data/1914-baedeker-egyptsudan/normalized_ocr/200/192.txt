than those of the liwisus, is provided with a wooden eupola or lantern,
with coloured-glass windows ofthe kind known as J.Fartusrtyehs. These
tamariyebs are plaster-slabs, about 11/4 inch in thickness, per-
forated, while still soft, with patterns representing vases of flowers,
houses, geometrical figures, writing-characteis, eta, the openings
being afterwards filled in with coloured glass. Owing to the abm ty-
mentioned difference in the height of the ceilings, two of the walls
of the dur.kire rest upon supports which are based upon massive
brackets reaching far down on the main side-walls. This irrrMge-
ment results in a curious kind of tlat arch, against which some of
the beams of the liwirreeiling lean. The durWa is paved with
coloured marbles and frequently has a fountain in the centre. The
liwims are paved with ordinary stone slabs, conceaied by rugs or
carpets. On one wall of the durlrira there is always a fiuifa, a shelf
on which are placed the, cups, ete. used in entertaining guests.
The walls of the liwias are panelled to the height of 6-10 ft., and
against them are placed divans, above which is a broad eoriliee-shelf,
on which are arranged porcelain, chased metal-work, and similar
ornaments. Instead ofpanelling, thewulls of the du -ci'a have marble
mosaics. The upper part of the walls is usually cov red with smooth
plaster or, in exceptional cases, with plaques of coloured fayence.
The expanse of white wall is usually broken by a grated recess in-
tended for female singers and accessible from without. At the very
top of the wall is a broad conrave frieze, embellished with inserip-
tions "stalactites, and forming the transition to the usually elab-
orate ceiling-xlecorations. Light and air are admitted to thexroom
from one of the ends, where mashrabiyehs are inserted in the lower
part of the wall and kamariyehs in the upper part.

The Public Baths, usually of quite unpretending exterior, are
frequently very large erections in which marble is not spared; in
their heating arrangements they are modelled on ancient Roman
vapour-baths (comp, p. xxvii),

The Okellas (p.50) were important editices when the caravan
trade, especially the varavan-trade with the lied Sea, flourished.
Their often extensive facades am "a peculiar type. The portals
resemble those of the mosques, and the doors and shutters of the
outer shops are sometimes carved, The central open couit "'00ule
modated the caravan, the goods brought by which were deposited in
vaulted chambers on the grouai1f1oor, while the rooms in the upper
stories, opening off galleries, were used as lodgings by the merchants.
The centre of the court seems in each case to have been occupied
by a simple prayeI-room (rnoyalld).

When we come to analyse the impressions produced by a study
of Arabic buildings in Egypt, we tind that our admiration of the
harmonious and tasteful ornamentation, unsurpassed by any school
of architecture, is counterbalanced by a certain feeling of aesthetic
dissatisfaction. The main reason why Arabian art failed to reach a high
