The Northern Colossus is the [ humus vocal statue of Memnon. To
the left of the kingstands his mother Met-ern- weye, to tho right his
wife Teye; a third tigurrs, between the leg 5 has been destroyed. On
each side of the sent two Nile-gods were represented' in sunk relief,
twining the representative plants of Egypt [ papyrus and lily) round
the hieroglyph for'to unite', a symbol of the union of Upper and
Lower E Tt.

Attention began to be directed to the Musical Phenomenon con-
llt'cled with the colossus about the beginning of the Roman 8ltt-
pire, after it had been broken. When it became known that the N.
colossus emitted a musical note at sunrise, a new myth was itt-
vented to explain the fact. Memnon who had fallen at Troy ap-
peered as a stone image at Thebes and greeted his mother lies
with a sweet and plaintive note when she appeared at dawn. The
goddess heard the sound and the morning-des" are the tears she
shed upon her beloved ehild. Ir the sound was not heard, it was
taken as a sign that the god "as angry. Straho, who is the first
author to mention the phenomenon, expressvs doubt as to its
genuineness; but Pausanias and Juveual (p. 354) arcept it as a
fact. The phenomenon ceased altogether after the time of Septimius
Severus, who caused the restoration of the upper portions, perhaps
with a view to propitiate the angry god. The restoration was not
vt-ry skilfully managed, with tire courts of sandstone blocks.
Attempts have been made to explain the resonance of the stone as
due to the splitting "of minute particles from the surface, caused
by the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the cold nights. A
similar phenomenon has been observed elsewhere.

The numerous Greek and Latin fnssriptmas, in prose and verse, iu.
scribed upon the legs of the figure hy travellers under: the Roman empire,
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than uh
the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the
foot of the statue. The earliest was carved in the 11th year of the reign
of Nero, the latest in those of Septimins Severus aud Uzmcalla, and the
most numerous (27) in that of Hadrian. only one Egyptian (Who is re-
sponsihle tor a short demotic inscription) is tonnd among these scrib-
hlers. The inscriptions were for the must part the work of men ofsome
eminenee, including b' governors of Egypt, .i epistrateges of the Theha'td,
2 proeurators, etc. A large number, thuugli not all, are dated. Many of the
great offioials who visited the marvels at Thehes were accompanied by their
wives. The colossus Was frequently dumb, in whit-h cast: the visitor
usually waited unti| a more favourable occasion. Some were so struck
with the pl1eurmsenon that they were not muteut till they had heard it
three or tour times. Hadrian (130 Ah.) spent several days here. along
with his Wife Sabina and a large retinue. In his reign at perfect Hood of
Greek verses spread Over the legs 0f the colossus, most of them by the
court- poetess Bawma. One of her etrnsions (on the left leg) relates in
t? hexameters that Memnon greeted Hadrian, as well as he could (t5:
aumdv) when he perceived the Emperor before sunrise. but that a. clearer
note, like that caused by a blow on an instrument or Copper, was emitted
at the second hour, and that even a third sound Was heard, so that all
the work! could see how dear the emperor was to the gods,
