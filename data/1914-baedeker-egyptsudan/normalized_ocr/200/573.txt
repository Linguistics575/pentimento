Pyramid, resting upon a substructure cased with Me limestone slabs.
in the W. wall of the hall were inserted the Sepulchml Chapels of
the Favourites ofthe Royal Harem. On the W. we next reach a COURT
surrounded by eolonuades. in the pavement of this court was the
entrance to a sloping passage 164 pls. long, leading to the suh-
tertangan totuh-eharnber of Moutuhotep IV. On the E. side of the
court are openings admitting to the shaft-tombs of the favourites
A large PILLARED HALL (only the bases of its 80 octagonal pillars
remain) and a Sexc'wnn' (hem; in the rock ] terminated the temple.
- To the N.W. of this building stood a Sanctuary of Hathor built
tryThutmosislll., ofwhich no trace remains. The shrine, constructed
in the rock and containing the image of the deity as a cow, is now
in the Museum of Cairo O.85).

Numerous very important discoveries have been made in the Venue:
JF Item EL-BAl'HH. Thus, in 1881, the Imynl Mummm mentioned at p. 95
were { aunt } in a shaft a little to the s. at the mortuary temple, while
in 1891 a Common Tomb far Theban Priests was discovered immediately
to the N of the lower terrace (contents now in the Museum of Cairo
and Alexandria, pp. $ 0, T2). Here is situated also the subterranean Tomb
n/ Menluhnlep Ill. [ see p. 304), known to the Arabs "Mb eumdn, which
was discovered by Mr. Carter in 1900, but has been covered in again.

By proceeding from Deir el-Bahti in the direction of Ifurna, we
soon reach the small depression known as El-Asasif. This contains
a large -

Necnoroms, the rock-tomhs in which date mostly from the be-
ginning of the Suite period (25th and 26th Dyno. Various brick
buildings are noticed also. The large arched gateway belonged to
a great mortuary chapel built by the Theban prince Ment-em-het
(26th DynJ. The tombs usually consist of an open court, to which
a flight of steps descends and whence a door admits to a large hall,
beyond which are the inner passages and chambers.

of especial interest is the Tomb of Ehe (Nu. 36), an oraiat in the reign
of Nitoei-is, daughter at Psammetiehae L, which contains reliefs copied from
originals 0f the time of the Ancient Empire. A ilight of steps leads into
the antechamher, where the deceaied is represented sitting at the table
or "etrings and receiving siigrificial gifts. In the room adjoining this on
the right are tastefui mien or nrtieane and deneew. Farther on we come
to what was originally'an open court with arcades at the sides; the retiere
on the walls reytreaent sacrilltsial scenes, among which one of a hunt
should he noticed. The adjacent colnnnade leads to several chambers
farther on. - Among the Other tombs 0f the same epoch may he men »
tioned the fine but much injured tomb ofPeivce Hartm (No. 37t inaccessible
at present), an vnu/ral nf klaeenAmeneNars, sister of the Ethiopian King
Shahake; the Tomb n/ 3hmt-em-h2t (Ne. M; inaccessible), a Thehim prince
of the time of the Assyrian dmnintttion (25th I) yn,); and the Tomb of
I'eteumenépet (N043), a high omeiat under the Nils Dyn, (epmp. p.329).
This last tomh is larger than any of the kings' tombs at Ih'bin el-Mumh,
heing 287 yds. in length and 2710 5: ]. yds. in ma. The carefully executed
inscriptions and reliefs, now unfortunately much injured and blackened,
refer almost without exceptinn to the fare at the soul after death.

On the N. slope of the hill of El-Khékha is the American House
(Arab. Beit Morgan ], belonging to the expedition sent oat by the
Metropolitan Museum of New York.
