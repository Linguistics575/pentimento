most severely tried, although the homogeneous soil of the valley of
the Nile requires less careful tilling and ploughing than ours. As
the dung of the domestic animals is used as t'nel throughout Egypt,
where wood is very scarce, while that of the numerous pigeons (comp.
p. 235) is mainly used for hortiaultural purposes, resource must be
had to other manures. One of these is afforded by the rains of an-
cient towns, which were once built of unbakerl tslay, but now eon-
sist of mounds of earth, recognizable only as masses of ruins by the
fragments of pottery they contain, Out of these mounds, Which
conceal the rubbish of thousands of years, is dug a kind of earth,
known as Sabakh, sometimes containing as much as 12 per cent "
nitrate of soda, potash, and chloride of soda. The valuable nitrates,
however, usually form a veiy small proportion. So largely have
these ancient sites been worked of late years, since intensive cul-
tivation began, that they will be exhausted at no very distant date.
So long as the inundation deposited a thick deposit of fresh mud
on the basin-lznds every year, and a single crop was raised off the
greater part of the area, the land could go on producing crops iude-
Iinitely, but now that most of the land is irrigated throughout the
year a very small amount ofthe mud is deposited, while two or more
crops are raised annually. To meet this, rmururing in a much more
systematic manner than hitherto has now become necessary, but as
yet few Cultivators have fully realized this.

2. lummnox. As a consequence of the works described on
P. lxvi, the whole orEgypt from Assitct to the Mediterranean, with
the exception of a strip oflanrl along the edge of the Western Desert
and the right bank of the Nile above Cairo, has had its old system
of i1oodArrigation, Le. a single watering by the annual inundation,
replaced by a perennial supply furnished by innumerable canals
and watercourses. In the inundation season (p.1xiv) the sluice-gates
of the dams are open annl the red-brown Mod rushes through them
towards the plains of llgyptl When the irrigation-basins are tiiled
up to a suflieliynt level, the water is left in them for about 40 days,
to deposit its suspended mud and to soak the ground thoroughly.
The perennially irrigated lands of the provinces of Middle Egypt
and the Delta receive only so muuh water as the standing amps
require, since these districts eannot be inundated. They, therefore,
under the prissisntir1tisnsive cultivation ] receive a very much smaller
amount of mud from the tlood-water than the land which has basin-
irrigation, and this has to be compensated by extensive manuring.

Briefly stated, the animal routine after the end of the inundation
is as follows. In November, when the Nile is falling and the whole
country is amply supplied, the sluice-gates of the Assuin Dam are
gradually closed, so as to iill the reservoir slowly. This is usually
aneomplishevl about the end of January The gates of the Esmsh,
Assitit, and Delta barrages are similarly manipulated so as to main-
min tho nerossary depth oi'watet in the supply-canals. In April the
