184 Route 12. THE SUEZ CANAL. Statistics.

On March 18th, 1869, the water of the Mediterranean was at
length allowed to flow into the nearly dry, salt-enctusted basins of
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of which lay 26MO ft. helew the
level of the Mediterranean, while the S. parts required extensive
dredging operations. The opening of the Suez Canal was inaugurated
on Nov. 17th, 1869, with magnifieent festivities in the presence
of many European princes.

The cost of constructing the canal amounted to 1111011119 million
pounds sterling, of which 12,800,0001. was paid by the shareholders,
while the rest of the sum was almest entirely contributed by the
Khedive. In 1875, however, the British Government acquired
177,000 of the Khedive's shares for a sum ofg,000,0001. The canal
belongs to the Suez Canal Company (Compagnie Universelle du Canal
Maritime de Sues), founded in 1851, which possesses also lands,
buildings, and other property, valued at nearly 3,000,000t.

The canal is 1111 kilom? stres (100 M.) in length, and the E,
bank is furnished with distanee-posts at intervals of 5 kilometres.
Near the stations are passiug-plaees for the large steamers, named
'Gare da Nord' and'Gare du Sud' respectively. The canal is now
throughout 36 ft. in depth, admitting vessels drawing 28 it. of water.
The surface varies in breadth from 2601044511., whilethe minimum
width of the tottomisi47ft.

The great mercantile importance of the Suez Canal is apparent from
the renewing data. The distance from London to Bombay vit the Capo
or Good Hope is 12,515 English miles, and via the Canal 7028 m. oaly.
