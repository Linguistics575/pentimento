Excvnsmx TO THE SPRINGS or MOSES (7-8 his). - Boats (p. 157)
and Donkey; (there and back about 20 pins.) should be ordered a day in
advance, and an early morning start should be made (about 6 em.) A
steam-launch, for which application should he made to a consul or to a
steamship agent, is preferable to a rowiug-boat. Calm weather is very
desirable for this excursion also, ant only for the passage in the heat (by
which the donkeys also must he conveyed) but em because the driving
sand in the desert is very disagreeable in a high wind. About 2 best
should be Allowed for the stay at the springs, iaeludingtimrs for luncheon
(hmught by the traveller) and for a walk on the heath.

The distance from the usual 1aru1ing-platre of the heats, in the
entrance to the Suez Canal (comp. the Map, p. 187), to the Springs
is about 6%, ul? hrs.' ride). The whole of the route thence by
land traverses the sand of the desert, skirting the sea, which lisa

return-route. To the left rise the yellowish ranges of the Gebct
er-ROI/a, belonging to the long chain of the Gebel et-TM, and
facing tho 8.141. We are now traversing Asiatic soil, while at the
same time the eye ranges ever part of the African continent.

In favourable oeather the expedition is usually made by sea
to the pier at the quarantine-station (Esh-Shatt ], about CIM. to the
N.W. of the Springs, which are thence reached on foot. This part
of the Red Sea Was long regarded as the'reedy sea' across which the
Israelites fled from Pharaoh; now, however, this is generally located
farther to the N., in the vicinity of the Bitter Lakuss, which at that
epoch may have been connected with the Red Sea.

The Springs of Moses (Hytm Mam) form an oasis of luxuriant
vegetation, about tire furlongs in circumference. Some of the
springs, which vary in temperature from 70Â° to 8i' Fahr., are only
slightly brackish, while others are undrinkably bitter. The largest,
in the garden farthest to the s., is said to have been the bitter
spring which Moses sweetened by casting into it a particular trec
(Exod. xv. 23 et seq.)

A mound, ea. 10 min. to the S.E. of the gardens, which is
about 15ft. high and is marked by e solitary palm-tree, commands
a tine view. The pool on the top of the mouud-is one of the most
characteristic of the springs, and is full of animal life. _ Conchel-
ogists will iiml a number of interesting shells on the beach at low
tide, but the best places are farther to the S.

An interesting boating-excursion may be made in good weather to the
Submarine Coral Gardem. We skirt the slope of the coral rock Whardb',
which stretches along the coast, becoming better developed the farther S
we go. Those who are interested in marine biology should land on the
rock, which is nearly dry at low water.
