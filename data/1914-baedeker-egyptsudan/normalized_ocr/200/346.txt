746 ft., but Was formerly (P1. BB) about 756 ft.; the present per-
pendicular height (Pl. E C) is 450 ft, while originally (Pl. E m,
including the nucleus of rock (Pl. PF) at the bottom and the apex
Cpl. CE), which has now disappeared, it is said to have been 48tt't.
The height of each sloping side (Pl. A C) is now 568 ft. and was for-
merly (P1. B E) (Hon. The angle at Which the sides rise is 51" 50'.
The cubic content of the masonry, deducting the foundation of rook
in the interior, as well as the hollow chambers, was formerly no less
than 3,277, 000 cubic yards and it still amounts to 3,057,000 cubic
yards. In round numbers, the stupendous structure covers an area
of nearly thirteen acres. The material of which it is constructed
is yellowish limestone quarried in the vicinity and containing
numerous fossils, chiefly narurrittlites (p. 116). The outer covering
was formed of blocks of a finer white limestone, which was obtained
from the quarries at ana o. 170) and other parts of the Mohattam.

Comtruction of the Great Pyramid. According to Borehardt's theory
this pyramid was not built on a single homogeneous plen (p. 126), It
was originally designed to contain only one sloping corridor hewn in the
tacky ground (a r) and Ietding through an antethnmher (n) to the tomb-
themher (t). But before this design Wes completely carried out it was
exchanged for a more comprehensive plan, involving the construction of
another chamber, now called the Queen', Chamber ie), reeched by the tor-
ridnr marked cet. Bat even this With not fbutl, for Kheops undertook
another 1nd greater extension, resulting in the construction of the Great
Hall (h) end the Eing's Chamber (k),

The AscBNT of the Pyramid, though fatiguing, is perfectly safe.
The traveller selects two of the importunate Beduins o. 124) and
proceeds to the N.E. corner of the pyramid where the ascent usually
begins. Assisted by the two Beduins, one holding each hand, and,
if desired, by a third (no extra payment) who pushes behind, the
traveller begins the ascent of the steps, which are each about 3 ft.
high. The strong and active attendants assist the traveller to mount
by pushing, pulling, and supporting him, and will seareely allow
him a moment's rest until the top is reached. As, however, the un-
wanted exertion is fatiguing. the traveller should insist on resting
as often as he feels inclined. d Uskut walla md fish balsshisrs' (be quiet,
or you shall have no fee) is a sentence Which may often he em-
ployed with advantage. All requests for hakshish should he refused,
and it is as well to keep an eye npon one's pockets. - The ascent
mar be made in 10-15 min. but, in hot weather especially, the
traveller is recommended to take nearly double that time, in order
to avoid the discomfort of arriving breathless and heated at the
summit. The space at the top at present is about 12 yds. square,
"that there is abundant room for a large party of visitors.

The "Irrrrw is remarkably interesting and striking. There is
perhaps no other prospect in the world in which life and death,
fertility and desolation, are seen in so close juxtaposition and in
such marked contrast. To the W., S., and N.W. extend yellowish
brown tracts of sand, interspersed with barren eliirs. The huge
