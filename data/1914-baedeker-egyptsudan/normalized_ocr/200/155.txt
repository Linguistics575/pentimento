body at pleasure, provided, of course, that the latter did not decay.
Thus from ancient times everything was done in Egypt to prevent
the destruction of the body, and so to enable the soul to recognize
its mortal tenement. A prominent place in the beliefofthe ancient
Egyptians was taken by the Ka, a kind of guariliaa-spirit or genius,
which was born with the individual and accompanied him through
life as a'double'. The Ha did not expire with its protégé but con-
tinueil to live in order to protect the deceased in the future world.

In the earliest period the dead were buried in a crouching posture
with their knees drawn up and lying on their left side. In the An-
cient Empire the custom ofleaving the corpse "full length began
to be followed, probably at first in the case of the kings, At the
same time embalming was attempted. The bodietwere treated with
saline solutions and bitumen and rolled in linen bandages and wrap-
pings. The process of preparing the mummy was more elaborate at
later times. The brains were tirst removed through the nostrils by
means of an iron hook; the stomach Was then opened with a Nut knife
and the viscera removed (Herodotus ii. 86) and placed in four jars,
known as Canoyi. These were usually closed with lids, bearing the
heads of the four sons of Osiris, to whose protection the intestines
were committed. The heart also was removed from the body, and
was replaced by a stone searsbasus, laid upon the breast of the de-
ceased, beneath the wrappings. Herodotus states that at a later
period there were three methods of er11balu1ing, dimsring according
to the expense involved. So much care was given to the preserva-
tion of the corpses that to this day the features ofmany ofthe mum-
mies may be clearly made out.
