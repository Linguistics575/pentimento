which the staircase is still to be seen, to Six Small Chapels, each
of which is entered by a sandstone gateway in the girdle-wall. Only
the two chapels farthest to the W. have left any considerable rc-
mains. The second from the W. contains the name of Amenertiis,
with that of her brother Shabako. The line alabaster statue of the
queen now in the museum at Cairo (p. 88) was found here. -
Farther on towards the river are numerous brick houses of a later
date, whinh have been largely demolished. Among them are the
remains of a small temple dedicated by Phiiopator to Thout. - To
the extreme N., amidst the houses of the village of Karnak, stands
a Small Temple, erected by Shepenupet, the daughter of the Ethio-
pian King Piankhi, and adorned with palm-columns.

Situated to the S. of Ramses IVs girdle-wall (p. 276) is the
Sacred Lake, named try the Arabs Birket et-ofa/ICOS or Lake of the
Salt Pit, as the water has become saline and undrinkable through
inhltration. The banks were anciently faced with hewu stones, and
traces of these are still to be seen on the W. and s. sides, and
even better on the N. On the N. bank of the lake stands a structure
of Thutmosis III. Near the N.W. corner are the ruins of a building
of Taharka, and on the bank of the lake is a colossal *Gram'te 1ara-
baeus, Which was dedicated byAmenophis Ill. to the sun-god Atum-
Khepre, who was pictured in the form of a searabams.

We now proceed to visit the Connecting Buildings between the
Temple of Amon and the Temple of Mut.

Quitting the central court of the Temple of Amen, we enter a
court enclosed on two sides by walls and on the rear by Pylon VII,
all of which are in ruins. Here stood a temple erected try Amen-
ophis I. and taken down under Thutmosis HI., the limestone blocks
of Which have been recently rediscovered; they are adorned with
fme reliefs. Adjacent is the so-talle)'Karnak Cachette' (now closed
up again), a large pit in which a profusion of statues of all periods
was discovered (779 of stone, 17,000 of bronze; now mostly in the
museum at Cairo, see p. 84); they came from the Temple of Amen
and were probably buried here when no longer used. - 0n the
exterior of the w. wall was inscribed the famous treaty made by
Ramses II. with the Hittites (p. 272). On the E. wall is a long
inscription (P1. a), describing the contests of King Ameuephthes
(Merenptah) with the Libyans and the peoples of the Mediterranean
(Etruseans, Achzans, etc.), and a triumphal relief (Pl. b) of Ame-
nephthes, in the presence of Amen, smiting his enemies.

Pylon VII, built by Thutmosis 111., whose victories axe celebrat-
ed on it, originally sisrved, like the following Pylon VIII, as the S.
entrance to the Temple of Amenophis 1. (see above). In front of

and New Empires; in front of the S. facade are the lower parts of
