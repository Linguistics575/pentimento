We return to the first anteehamber (p. 247) and ascend one
of the stnimuas which lead thence to the roof of the temple.
The FUST Snmuse, which ascends straight to the roof with easy
steps, is dark. The WEST STAIRCASE is a kind of spiral staircase,
with ten rectangular bends, lighted by several windows, with
tasteful syrnboliea1 representations of the sun shining through
them. The walls of both staircases are embellished with reliefs of
the ceremonial procession of the priests with the images of Hathor
and her fellow-gods at the great new year's festival. The left wall
presents us with a view of the procession ascending from the lower
rooms of the temple to the roof, in order that'the goddess Hathor
might be united with the beams of her father Re' (the sun-god); the
right wall shows the procession descending. The priests are headed
by the king; some of them wear masks representing the lesser deities.
- The W. staircase passes a small room [ situated above the store-
room adjoining the second anteehamber) with three windows look-
ing into the court. Highex up is a small court with two rooms
opening "it, corresponding to the chambers on the E. side of the
terrace (see below) and likewise dedicated to the cult of Osiric.
The reliefs in the second room represent the resuscitation of Osiris,

We now reach the Temple Rnof. which has various levels, the
highest being above the great vestibule or pronaos (p. 246). At
the S.W. angle of the lower terrace, which we reach first, stands a
small open Pavilion, supported by 12 sistrruu-eolamns with heads
ofHathon Adjoining the terrace on the N. is a small Shrine of Osiris,
situated above the chambers to the left of thehypostyle hall and used
in the worship ofthe slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations
and numerous inscriptions indicate. The second room is separated
from the first (an open court) by pillars, and formerly contained the
famous Zodiac of Dendera (now in the Biblioth√©que Nationale at
Paris), the only circular representation ofthe heavens found in Egypt.
The remaining portion of the ceiling still shows two tigares of the
goddess ofheaven. The window in the last room, with represent-
ations of Osiris resting upon a bier, deserves attention. - A ifight
of steps ascends from the N.W. end of the terrace to the roof of the
first antechamber and thence to the still higher roof of the hypostyle
hall. Thence a modern iron staircase leads to the roof of the
promos, which commands a beautiful view of the valley of the Nile
and the hills of the desert.

Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found
interesting. The exterior walls are covered with inscriptions and
representations. The reliefs on the E. and W. walls date from the
