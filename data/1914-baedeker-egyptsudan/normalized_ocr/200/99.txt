Remarks on Mohammedan Customs.

The rite of circumcision is performed on boys up to the age of
six or seven, or even later, the ceremony being attended with great
pomp. Theehiid is previously eoudmstedrhr0ugh thestreets iuholiday
attire; in unim- to diminish the expense of tho proceedings, the
procession is frequently united with some bridal party, or two or
more boys are driven together in a carriage. The boy generally
wears a turban of red cashmere, girls' clothes of the richest poss-
ible description, and conspicuous female ornaments, which are
designed to attract attention and thus avert the evil eye from his
person. He half covers his face with an embroidered handkerchief;
and the barber who performs the operation and a noisy troop of
musicians head the procession, The first personage in the procession
is usually the barber's boy, carrying the'lrernl', m- barher's sign, a
kind of cupboard made ofwood, in the form "a hVisylruder, with
four short legs.

Girls are generally married in their 19th or 13th, and sumo-
times as early as their 10th year. A man in search of a bride
employs the services of a relative or of a professional female match-
maker, and he never has an opportnuity of seeing his bride until
the wedding-day, except when the parties heioug to the lowest
classes. When everything is arranged, the "ianeerl bridegroom
has to pay a bridal-portion (mahr) amounting to about 25L, less

the wife, being payable on the death of the husband or on his
divorcing her against her will. Before the wedding the bride is
comiucted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the bath. This
procession is called'Zefet el-r.hvttrruirrt'. It is headed by several
musicians with hautbois and drums; these are followed by several
muriml femaie friends Mid relatives of the bride in pairs, and after
these came l number of young girls. The bride follows, under "
silken canapy open in front. In Cairo, however, this canopy is now
generally replaced by a carriage of some kind. The shrinks of joy
Which women of the lower classes utter on such occasions am called
zuyiuirf; (sing.: aglm'zgaj. The bride is afterwards conducted with
the same fornmiities to the house of her husband.

The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable
than those that attend weddings. Ifthc death occurs in the morn-
ing, the funeral takes place the same day; but if in the evening,
it is postponed till next day. The body is washed and mourned
over by the family and the professional mourning women (neddd-
