to the river, which must have made great encroachmcnts here since
the end of the 18th century. Between MiMaltat and Assi0t. (27 M.
by river, only 17 M. by land) the Nile makes mnny curves.

We next observe Shilcellpil, on the E. bank, 11/4 M. to the S. of
Fh-Mitbdeh (p.219), Ir'l-l.htwtitkelt, a pretty village among palms,
on the W. bank, and Betti Mohammad, on the E. bank. The
mountains to the N. (E. hank) recede farther and farther from the
river, leaving a broad strip of fertile land at their feet. Close to the
mountains lie'Arab eb-'Aliycit and Deir et-Cr'ubrthci (p. 219).

Above lieni Mohammad the Nile makes several great bends and
is divided into two arms by the large island (7edret Ilehtg. On the
E. arm lies t233 sAr0Ebnitb (Abnub), rt district-capital, with 6878 "m-
hab. (4291 Gopts ] and line palm-groves.

The foot-hills of the Libyan chain on the W. bank approach the
river, whieh is here, near the village of Ir't.. Wrtladiyelt (Walidia; W.
bank), hridled by the Assiii.t Barrage, an imposing work intended
to regulate the amount of water in the Ibrihtmtyeh Canal whiz'h
irrigates the provinces of Assirht, Miuyeh, Ihmisueif, and Gizeh,
and (through the Bah: Yfssur, see p. 231) the Faiyi" lin. The bar-
rage, which is 910 yds. long and 41 it, high, was constructed in
1898-1902 by Aird & Co. (p. 372) from the original design of Sir
W. Wiilcovks and plans by Sir Benjamin Baker (d. 1007) and Sir
w. Garetin. It consists of thirteen sections, the first of which (W.)
has three arches and a lovak, while the others have nine arches
each. Each opening (111 in all) can he shut by an iron door. The
barrage is crossed by a "arriage-roiul. A Innnvdintely above the
harrage, on the W. bank, are the regulatiou-works (a bridge with
nine arches and a 100k) at the mouth of the Ibrt" slmrtiyeh Canal, the
S. prolongation of the, liahr YC1snt' (p. 231). Close by are the neat
houses and pretty gardens of the ofticiais.
