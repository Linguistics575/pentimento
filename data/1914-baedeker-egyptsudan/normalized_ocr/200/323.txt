stature of the deceased. The W. liwén (Pl. O), opposite the sanctu-
myl had three aisles also, but the arcade next the court has collapsed
The two side-liwéus (PI. 10 & 11) have one aisle only. Behind that
to the N. are cells for dervishes, students, and pilgrims, and a hall
(P1. 12; new very dilapidated), Which forms an out-building to the
mosque and connects the khia.kth with the small mausoleum of Bar-
; father, Sham," ed-Dln Arms, who died in i382. To the W. of
th s hall was the old ehiefentrance (Pl.14j, adjoined by a "til With
a medreseh or school (PL "Behind the S. liwén is a court of
ablution (Pl. 13), with a water-basin (rneh!" a). - One "the two
Minerals was restored in i000. Both had originally three stories.

To the W. (right) of this tomb-rnosquis, within a walled court,
is the Tomb orSuteirrvfn, a contemporary of the sultan of that name
(first half of the 16th cent.) This contains interesting sculpture
in the dome and inscriptions in blue fayenee, now partly destroyed.
To the E. of this tomb (and to the S. orhrlitoli's mosque) is another
handsome dome-eovered tomb ('Mausolée de Ganem Bey'). On the
right of the road leading from the mosque of Baikal; to the S.W. to
the tomb of [ gait Bey (see below) is the Mibed erl'/Td? yeli, a large
depressed dome of the Turkish period.

Opposite, to the E. (left), is the Tomb Mosque (tIrish) of Bars Bey
(p. cxix), completed in 1432. It includes a mausoleum and the
ruins of a convent, Within the enclosing Walls are the tombs of
some relatives of Bars Bey. The liwin contains good mosaics. The
dome of the mausoleum is interesting. The remains of a sebil also
are extant. - Farther on, to the right, is the Tomb of the Mother
of Bars Bey, a small dome with pentagonal and hexagonal openings.

In the same street, a few hundred paces farther to the s., we
observe on the right the RW "House of JiWit Beg, 260 ft. long,
completed in MN, but now in ruins The facade is plain but the
gateway is very tasteful. A little farther to the s., in an angle,
is a Water Trough [ Pl.15, p. 114), now in rains, with its once
beautiful rear wall protected by a roof. The cab', the trough, and
the mosque (see below) all belonged to the barial-plaee (rp5sh) of
Ifirit Bey, which covered an area 330 yds. long. Its exact limits
eannot now be determined, and a number of modern buildings have
been erected within them.

The *Tomb Mosque of 151m Bey (pp. 73, cxix ], built in 1463
and restored in 1898, is the finest editiee among the Tombs of the
Caliphs. It is distinguished by its beautiful dome, its slender
nsinaret (i30n. high), its harmonious proportions, and its hand-
some ornamentation, in which stalaetites are profusely used. In
the interior we notice the beautiful marble mosaic, the tasteful eeil-
ings, the pulpit, and the lattice windows of stucco (partly modern).
Within the mausoleum (Pl. 8, p. lid) are shown a iluely carved
desk and two stones, which are said to have been brought from
1lecea by h'é'itBey and to bear impressions of the feet of the prophet
