xciv III. MOHAMMEDAN CUSTOMS.

eession. Tlu: foremost persons in the cort√©ge are usually six or more
poor, and generally blind, men, who walk in twos "threes at a
slow pace, chanting the creed _'There is 110 God but God; Moham-
med is the ambassador of God; God be gracious to him and preserve
him l.' These are followed by several male relatives of the deceased,
and sometimes by a number of dervishes with the flags of their
order, and then by a few boys, one of whom carries a copy of the
Koran. The boys usually chant in a loud and shrill voice several
passages from the U.hssEriyeh', a poem describing the last judgment.
The bier, with the head of the deceased foremost, comes next,
being borne by three, or four of his friends, who are relieved from
time to time by others. After the bier come the female relatives,
with dishevelled hair, sobbing aloud, and frequently accompanied
by professional mourning Women, whose business it is to extol the
merits of the deceased. If the deceased was the husband or father
of the family one of the cries is:'0 than camel of my house', the
camel being the emblem of the bread-winner of the household.
The body is first carried into that mosque for whose patron saints
the relatives entertain the greatest veneration, and prayers are
there offered on its behalf. The body is then home to the cemetery,
where it is laid in the tomb in such a position that the face is
turned towards Mecca.

Among the women are the relatives and friends of the deceased,
distinguished by a strip (usually blue) of linen, cotton, or muslin
bound round the head, with the tend hanging down behind. Mer,
wear t10 mourning clothes. The women, especially in the country,
frequently put dust on their brows and breasts, a practice Which is
l survival from antiquity, as may be seen 011 comparing the re-
presentations of ancient funerals at Thebes and elsewhere. Rich
men 01 pious sheikhs anti rularmis are buried with greater pomp,
to Which religious fraternities and dervishes with their flags (wittri-
bute; water is distributed; and the riding-horse and a bufhtlo are
led in the procession. The buffalo is slaughtered at the tomb end
its Ilesh distributed among the poor.

Another custom peculiar to the Moslems is the separation of
the sexes even after death, In family-vaults one side is set apart
for the men, the other for the women (comp. p. clxxxiii). Between
these vaults is the entrance to the tomb, usually covered with a
single large slab. The vaults are high enough to admit of the
deceased sitting upright in them when he is being examined by
the angols Munkav and Nekii 011 the first night after his interment.
