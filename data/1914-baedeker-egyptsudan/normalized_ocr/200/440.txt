Holders of Cook's or the Hamburg & Anglo-American Nile Cofs
tickets may break their Journey at Luxor or Assnin either on the
way up or the way down (after previous arrangement in Cairo), and
proceed by the next steamer, if there are vacant berths. la all these
deviations from the usual tours very strict adherence to the terms
of the special arrangement is exacted.

Dahablyehs. Travellers to whom independence of action and
economy of time are more important than economy of money may
charter for themselves steam-dahabiyehs or private steamboats (6-
20 berths), which are not much slower than the large tourist-
steamer?. But in a sailing-tlahabiyeh (4-16 berths), which has to be
towed upstream when the wind is unfavourable, not less than 2 or
3 mouths must be allowed for the voyage to Assuan and back. In
Cairo the best dahabiyehs, comfortably and even luxuriously fitted
up, are those belonging to Messrs. Cook f Son (9 steam-dahabiyehs,
13 sailing dahabiyehs) and the Hamburg'Anglo-American Nile Co.
(2 stisarn-dahatriyahs, several sailing-dahahiyehs). Dahabiyehs are
not usually let for less than a month. The inclusive charge for a
steam-dahabtyrsh is about 400-750t. per month according to the
number of passengers. These prices include not only the hire of the
dahabiyeh and its full equipment and the wages of the raiyis or
captain and the crew, but also the services of a dragoman and atten-
dants, as well as provisions (except liquors), donkeys, saddles, and
all the incidental expenses of excursions (excluding bakshish). The
charge for a sailing-da/yeh, excluding provisions and all inciden-
tal expenses, is 35-50l. per mouth. In the case of head-winds
small steam-tttgs may be hired for 6-8l. per day. Further details
will be found in the programmes issued In! the companies.

The traveller may also hire a dahabiyeh directly, tie. indepen-
dently of the agents, and take the eoi11a1issariat into his own
hands; but this is not recommended to inexperienced travellers. A
dragomau (p. xxv) is essential, A contract with him mast be drawn
up stipu lating for the price and duration of the voyage, the style of
living, the maintenance of the dahahiyeh in a good and ertioient
condition, and the providing of a small boat to be at all times at
the disposal of the traveller, A clause should be inserted relieving
the travellers from all responsibility for any damage to the daha-
biyeh orits contents, not due to their fault; and finally both parties
should expressly agree to submit all disputes as to the carrying out
of the contract to the arbitration of the consul in whose presence
it has been signed.
