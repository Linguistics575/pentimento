430 _ 34. OMDURMAN. Arsenal.

The native town of DmilurrMa, which was the capital under the
new Mahdi regime, was founded in 1883-84 by the Mahdi Moham-
med Ahmed (p. g27), and after his death in 1886 it was the resi-
dence of the Khalifa'Ahdalléh et-TaWishi for "years, daring Which
it became the scene of the most atrocious cruellies and the most
extravagant orgies. It extends for about 31/2 M. along the left bank
of the united Nile, and has room for upwards of100,000 inhabi-
tants. The name is said to be derived from an old woman who
once spent a solitary existence here. The S. part is the Umm
ed-Durm6n proper, The central part, including the holy buildings
and the walled inner town inhabited by the Baggéxa (Balghira)
tribe, to whom'Abdalléh belonged, is called by the natives Er-mr.
ya, in.'the (holy) plaee', a name always given to the wandering
headquarters of the Mahdists. To the N. is the I.htret en-Nardra
or el-ue.silyn, the Christian quarter, inhabited by Abyssiniaus,
UOPtS, and Greeks.

The warlike oppression before 1899, the fanatical enthusiasm
for pilgrimages, the desire for plunder, and the devastation of whole
provinces have assembled here a confused medley ot' the most diverse
races and stocks: Bautus and grotesque dwarf negroes from the W.
t% dr" ur, Semitic and Hamitic tribes from the desert, such as Ntoa,
Baggéra, kabiuibtsls, Gowameh, and Kowéhleh Arabs; Nubians, Fel-
lahin, Ja'ilin (p. 423). To these must now be added Egyptians,
Syrians, and a few Greeks. The shoykeepers are mostly Dangolese.
The fashions prevalent among the natives are very curious, such as
their methods of shaving, tattooing, and permming themselves, and
otherwise altering their personal appearance.

The steam-ferry lands its passengers at Abu Anya, near the large
and picturesque Mamda, or Boat Harbour, which is adjoined by
the markets for ivory, it1dia-rubher, and grain. From this point we
may proceed into the town either by the ateam-tramway (p.426) or
(preferably) by donkey. - Following the tramway-line, we emss one
of the markets (say) and reach the lofty walls surrounding the Beit
el-Amdna (P149; B, 2), the former arsenal of the dervishes, which
still serves as a military magazine and contains memorials of Gordon's
time and trophies of weapons. For a visit to it, which, however,
is hardly worth while, a permit must he obtained from the As-
sistant Secretary, Stores Section in Kharttun (p. 429). The Prison
(PL B, 2), where many Europeans languished, is situated 500 yds.
farther E., at the S. angle of the ruinous town-wall. It is sometimes
known as the'Saier Prison', from the name of the Flor under the
Mahdi and Khalifa. - Farther on, to the left, is the Jrorrvsnddn'iyeh
or Guard House of the Sudanese, formerly the House of Emir Yakri6
(P1. 21). On the large Mosque Square (Pl. B, 2), in which the der-
vish army was reviewed, lie (1.) the Zab.ityelr "oNire of the ma'mtlr
(Pi. 22) and (r) the Mosque of the Khalifa, a large rectangular court
sun'mulded by a brick wall (comp. p. olxxviii).
