cxlvi VI, EGYPTIAN RELIGION.

goddess Seshet inscribed the years of the coming reign on the leaves
of the sacred tree. At On stood also the obelisk-like stone column
of Bcnben, the chosen seat of the sun-god. The local deity, strictly
speaking, was, however, Alum, - and the astete priests of On pat this
god on a par with the god of the sun and asserted that he was only
another form, another name of 1lEirakhtis. This doctrine obtained
a wide currency throughout the country and all the local gods were
promptly identified with lie and invested With the symbol of RE,
vis. the sun-disk with the poisonous royal serpent (urmus. p.01xxvii)
coiled round it. Thus even the crocodile-god Sobel: and Amen of
Thebes became sun-gods. This amalgamation of local deities with
Re, which began under the Middle Empire and was carried to great
lengths under the New Empire, was a fertile source of confusion
in the Egyptian religion. Attempts indeed were made to draw a
distinction among the various forms ot' Re, Khepre for example
being regarded as the morning-sun and Atum as the evening-sun,
but nothing like a systematic scheme was ever aehiewed.

In the same way a number of female local deities, especially
when they were of asimilar character, were welded into one. Thus
Mather, the goddess of the sky, was identified with Itis; the cat-god-
dess Bum: with the lion-goddesses Sekhmet and Pelthet, while Sekh-
met was identified also with the vulture-goddess Mut.

When the centre of the empire was carried farther to the S. under
the Middle Empire and THEMES became the capital in place of Mem-
phis, a new please began in the development of theEgyptian religion.
Amen, the Theban local god, who had been identified with the 8rrti-
god under the name of Amon-RE, took precedence of alt other gods,
and at tl1ebeginitir1g ofthe New Empireheeame the head ofthe Egyp-
tian pantheon. The great campaigns against Nubia and Asia Were
waged in his name by the Theban kings, temples Were erected to
him in the conquered lands, and the lion's share of the spoil fell to
his shrines in Egypt, especially to the temple at Thebes. Amen, in
short, became the national god, the successful rival ofhispredecessor
Horus (rtrs-Haralrhte). It was not to be expected that the priests of
Heliopolis should tamely submit to thisweakeningof their influence.
They therefore eagerly seized the first opportunity of overthrowing
Amen and of restoring the sun-god to his former ofiieiM dignity.
When Amenophis IV. succeeded to the throne the sun-gud of Helio-
polls (Rts-Harairhte) regained the position of supreme deity, and
shortly afterwards the sun itself (Egypt. Alon ] was announced as
the one and only god. This revolution was doubtless to some extent
prompted by the king's desire to put a stop to the prevailing religious
confusion at a blow, and to make praetiee square with theory, for
theoretically all the numerous deities had long been explained as
in reality one with the great sun-god (comp. p. 211). The repre-
sentations and names of Amon and his fellow-gods were every-
where obliterated. But after the death of Amenophis the partisans
