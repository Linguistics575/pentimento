(ibi A.D.), the priests of these tribes Wen: yermitmd to offer saeriiiee8 to
Isis along with the Egyptian priests, and also obtained the right or re-
moving the miraculous image of the mighty goddess from the island at
certain solemn festivals and of retaining it for some time. Even after all
Egypt had long been Christianized the ancient 1sirwurship still held
sway in Xubia. la spite of the edicts of Theodosius the temples of
Phiiie were not closed until the reign of Justinian (lm-NIO), when some
of their chambers were used for Christian services. After the conquest of
Egypt by the Arabs Philm embraced Islam, but in the meantime a Coptic
town had been established on the island.

The island, which formerly ranked, with its stately temples and
rich vegetation, as one of the most beautiful points in Egypt, has
inst much of its charm since the construction of the Nile Dam. It
is oniy between Aug. and Vee., when the water of the Nile is allow-
ed to flow freely through the gates of the dam and the surface
of the water regains about the same level it had before the con-
struction of the barrier, that the whole island stands above water,
so that access may be obtained to all the temples. Formerly, during
the rust of the year also, certain portions ofthe ruins were accessible
(partly by boat), bat since the raising of the dam (camp. p. 371 ]
this is no longer the case. Elaborate operations on Phila, hare
taken place to preserve the temples as far as possible from injury
during their annual sutunargenee.

The traveller should visit the various points in the following order,
without lingering too long over any ofthem, if his time be limited. It is
better to obtain a good general impression from the whole than to examine
the details minutely.

At the sm end of the island lies the extensive Outer Temple
Court, "hich is bounded on the N. by the first pylon of the Temple
of Isis, en the S. by the Vestibule of Nektarusb6s, and on the E.
and W. by colomiades. This court dates from the 1ata-Ptoliunaie,
period or from the reign of Augustus. Attention should be paid
to the remains of the strong Quay Wall that palhaps was carried
round the greater part of the island, with flights of stone steps at
various points.

The \'Esrmum'. or NBKTANEBES was built by Nektauehfys as the
vestibule for a temple, dedicated to'his mother Isis, revered at Atne
ton, mistress of Philas, and to the Mather of Senmet' (p. 370). The
temple was swept away by the floods ofthe Nile very shortly after its
completion; but Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the vestibule to be
thoroughly restored. The elegant iittle structure was supported by
14 columns with varying ilor81 capitals, above each of which was a
second sistnim-capital. Only six of the columns are now standing,
and the roof has disapyeared. Between the columns were stone
screens, orer 6 ft. in height, crowned with concave cornices and
rows of Urte11s-serpisnts, and interrupted on the E., W., and N. by
exit-doors. These screens bore reliefs showing King Nektanch√©s
saerifleing to the gods.

Before the riverfront ot the temple two 0betisks upon chest-shaped
bases were erected in the Ptolcmaic periud. These were made at sand-
