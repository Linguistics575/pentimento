At the S. end of the garden is a N1Losrmam (M'v? vyiis), Con-
strueted in 716 A.D. by order of the Omaiyade aaliph Suleinuiri.
It consists of a square well, 16ft. in diameter, having in the centre

measures. The dint', or old Arabian cl }, is 54 v'entimitres, or about
'21!" inches long, and is divided into 24 kirftt, The Guiie ittsk1p-

walls refer to restorations of the nilometer in the 9th eeut., under
the Abbaside ealiphs Ma'uvin and Mntawakk. Numerous later
restorations have taken place, the last in 1803. The ofticuy of
measuring the water is entrusted to a sheikh.

column is nearly 59 ft. ehuve sea-level. The water of the Nile, when at
