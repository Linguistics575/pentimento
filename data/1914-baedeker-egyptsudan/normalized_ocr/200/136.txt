UXEX Y. HIEROGLYPHICS

3. Determinatives.

E.g. man; woman; () tree; m house; Â© town;

23:1 abstract idea. To this rlass belong also the sign of the plural

lil (i) and the osal ring a (the so-ealled'eartoucheO placed

round the namos'of kings.

These various classes of signs, which were used in accord-
ance with certain tixed rules of orthography, were employed in
writing Egyptian words; e41.'tSC?,, nut,'to remain' (syllabic
sign eeey mu, sound WM n, determinative for an ahstraut
idea cess); 66 SIR'tirne' (+ s, C ] p, C) word-sign sp). We
cannot, of course, pronounce these words that an: written without
vowels; but in many instances, by the aid of Coptic o. cxxxi) or of
Cuneiform or Greek transliterations (especially in the vase of proper
names), we learn what was the pronunciation "latttrperio4s, and are
thus able to supply vowels to the eonsonantal skeletons. We know,
cr, that the Coptic for'time' is ear, and we therefore read the
above hieroglyphic as sop. When, however, no such guide is
obtainable it is the custom of Egyptologists to render the words
articulate by inserting an e; thns m It','hull', is read ke'.

Hieroglyphics are usually written from right to left, sometimes
in perpendicular rows, sometimes in horizontal rows; occasionally,
but quite exceptionally and only for decorative purposes, they
are written from left to right. For the sake of convenience modern
reproductions of hicroglyphies are written or printed from left to
right. It was almost a matter of course that both the shapes of the
hieroglyphics and the orthography ot' the words should vary very
greatly in the course M' the thousands "years (luring which the
system was used; and with a time trouble the traveller will soon
learn to distinguish the simple and bold characters of the Early
Empire from the ornate symbols ofthe 18th Dyn. (6.9. inthe temple
at Abydos) and from the small crowded hieroglyphies ot' the Ptole-
maic period.

When the picture characters instead of being curved by the
chisel were written with a reed-pen upon papyrus, fragments ot'
limestone, or wooden tablets, they generally assumed a simpler and
more rounded form. la this way arose a system of Literary Hiero-
glyphic, Which we meet with mainly in carefully-executed religions
manuscripts.

For the purposes of ordinary writings this system was still
further sirnpliiied and abbreviated and for the sake of speed the
separate characters were often united, thus forming a Writing or
