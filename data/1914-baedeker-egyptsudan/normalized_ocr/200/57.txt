of the following ten different elements.

sants', with whom must be reckoned the Coptic peasants of Upper
Egypt, form the hulk of the population and may be regarded as the
siuews of the national strength.: l'hey are generally slightly above
the middle height; their honos, and particularly their skulls, arc,
strong and massive; and their wrists and ankles arc powerful and
sommhnt clumsy. [ n'nll these respects the iellahiu, like their 110-
mestin animals, contrast stmnglywith the inhabitants of the desert.
Notwithstanding this largeness of frame? however, the l'ellah nevm-
grows fat. The women and girls MP parti0ularly remarkable for
their slender buihL The men gennmily keep theirheads shaved,
but the hair of the soldiers and the long tresses o? the girls, though
always black and thick, is smooth and wavy, seldom curly. The hair

The chief peculiarity of the Egyptians is the remarkable close-

bones, the receding forehead. the iowness of the bridge oi' the nose,
which is always distinctly separated from the forehead, and the
flatness of the nose itself, are the chief characteristics of the
Egyptian skull; but, as the jaws project less than those Dfmost
ol" the other African coloured rates, it has been assumed that the
skull is Asiatic and not African in shape. The Egyptian peasantry
have a much darker complexion than their compatriots in the towns,
and their colour deepens "we proceed southwards, from the pale
brown of the inhabitant of the Delta to the dark bronze hue of the
Upper Ee gyptians. There is, however, a difference between the tint
