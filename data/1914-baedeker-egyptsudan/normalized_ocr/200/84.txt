At Cairo rain usually falls on 4-6 days in the year, the average
amount being about one ineh. In some years, however, "much as
two inches are recorded, while in others hardly any rain falls.

At Alexandria and on the coast the regular winter-rains of the
Mcditertcan 00inlr, and the avcrage annual rainfall is 8-10 inches,
most of which falls in November-February.

From Assitit. southwards the prevalent winds blow from the N.
throughout tlw year, being slightly to the R. of N. in the spring-
months and more to the W. in the late summer. In winter and spring
dry S. winds occur oiieasi0aally. Jn the N. portion of the country
the winds are more variable, for although N. winds prevail, S. and
S.W. winds may continue for several days in the winter and am a
great hindrance to the sailing craft 0n the Nile at this season. These
ti. winds nrr duv to the Ilerliterrauean winter-storms, which sweep
by from w. to bl., and if they follow a track h ('tww-n Crete and
Egypt produce S. winds blowing from the Egyptian'losrrts towards
the storm-centrr'. The winds blowing from the open desert are cold
and by their dryness sm-m to be even colder than they really are,
so that visitors to Cairo in tho winter-months may experience the
sensation of a somewhat greatr'r degree of rnltl than would be ex-
pected from the tem1perMur0s quotu-d ahovc.

The spring-storms of the Mediterranean are also primarily the
cause of the Kham0fm or hot S. wind which occasionally blows for
two "three Jays at a time in March, April, and May. This wind
blows from the heated "csorts and often attains considerable strewgih,
carrying with it saml and dust until a thick yellow fog may prevail,
sufiieiently dense to hide the sun, The shade trrmperairrrc under
thew conditions frequently exceeds I00" Fahr.

On the Jesert-plateau thl' range of temperature is at all times
of the year considerably greater than in the valley, while the dryness
is much greater. 1n the valley the temperature varies comparatively
little and sinks to freezing point only for very briefperiods. 0n the
desert-plateau, however, the thermometer often stands at the freez-
ing point and may even fall several degrees below it.
