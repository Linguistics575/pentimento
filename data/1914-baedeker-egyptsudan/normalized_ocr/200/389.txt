is shown'eontemplating all the pleasant diversions that take place
throughout the country'; in the top row a herd of cattle is being
driven through a marsh, and men are engaged in phurking papyrus
plants, tying them in bundles, and carrying them away; in the

We now return to the Pillaretl Hall and pass through a door in
the W. wall into the CHAPEL op Eiuter-norer (D), a son of Ptah-

From the magtaba of Ptahhotep a path leads to the S E. to
(1/3 li.) the *Pytamid of King Onnos or Unis (p. cl, which may
easily be climbed without assistanec. The view from the top repays
the exertion: to the N. are the Pyramids of Abus.ir and Gizeh; to the
s., those of Sakkéra and Dahshttr; and to the E., the Step Pyramid
and the palm groves and fields of Sahhém and Nit Raliineih

Isretziox. The pyramid was npencd in 1381 and is accessible to visit,

Corridor, originally Hooked at the further End by three trap-doors, iends

The small Mortuary Temple, whirh stood on the E. side of the
pyramid, has recently been excavated by the Egyptian Service des
Antiquités, but is much dilapidated. It contained a court with

are some vestiges of a false door of granite,
