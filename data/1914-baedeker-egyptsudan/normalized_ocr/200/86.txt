Ixxx 111. EL-ISLAM.

hostility between Byzantium and Persia had many times led to
incursions into the settled districts by the savage horder-trihes of
both empires. The tide had thus begun to flow long before Isliun
gave the movement a unifying wat0h-wort1 and an organization.
Universal dominion for the Arabs was the watch-word; that was the
interpretation put upon Islirn by the conquerors, in sharp contrast
with the initial position of their prophet. They had no thought
of converting the defeated nations by force; so long as tribute was
paid and Arab supremacy recognized, every religious and civil
right was "orAirrned to the conquered. At first conversion to Islam
Was possible only by connecting the convert with the Arab tribal
system as a client; then, as a Moslem, he became, in theary at
least, a fully qualiged burgess of the Islamic theocracy and no
longer required to pay tribute. Thus the ti00d of converts to Isiéun
soon became larger than was altogether pleasing to the Arabs;
but the impeiling force Was not terror of the sword but the great
economic advantages that attended the transition of a more subject
into even the lowest rank among the rulers.

The key to a proper appreciation of Isiamic civilization lies in
a due understanding of the relations existing between the thin
Amh upper layer and the huge underlying mass of their subjects.
In the case of kindred peoples at least, it was easy for the Arabs to
impose their language as the language of common intercourse; and
for the reasons given above their religion also was bound to spread.
'mt for the rest the Arabs, eomparetively few in number and on a
lower stage of culture, could hardly hope to stamp anew civili-
zation upon the highly-developed inhabitants of the ancient empire
la each t1eW-Won province, therefore, they simply took over the
arrangements for governing as they found them, and with them
all the problems of economic and intellectual life. Even their reli-
gion, in order to he elfeotive, was forced to come to an under-
standing with the existing ecclesiastical conceptions of expiring
antiquity. The religion of Islém, born of the religious-spirit of W.
Asia, did not of its own strength impose upon a population of a
widely different nature that religious temper which is to this day
characteristic of the Islamic world, permeating state and society,
family and individual. On the contrary; it was by the people of
the conquered lands that Islam itself was converted to that view of
existence, as We now see it, which infuses religion into everything;
for these new converts, in contrast with the religiously-indifferent
Arabs, could neither do anything nor leave anything undone without
bringing it into direct relation with God and the future life. We
must therefore think of the early Islamic civilization, not as some-
thing quite new, introduced from elsewhere by the Arabs, but as
the self- assertion of the remarkable mixed civilization of the
Near East which had developed in the course of the first six
Christian centuries. In other words, Islam is the heir of the late..
