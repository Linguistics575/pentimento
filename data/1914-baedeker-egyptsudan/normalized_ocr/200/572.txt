shepsut) before Amen. The figures at the gods here were defaced by
Amenophis IV. and were not replaced at the restoretihh under Ramses II.

A granite Portal, reached by a porch dating from the 18th Dyn.,
with baiustrades, forms the entrance to the SANCTUARY. The three
chambers (PL E, F, G) eie unfortunately much damaged. The tirst
two have vaulted ceilings and are adjoiued by recesses. The scenes
in the let Chamber (PL E) show Hatshepsut (sometimes Thut-
mosis III.) saeriticing to various deities, among whom figures the
deceased Thutmosis II. The 3rd Room was added under Energetes ll.
and was dedicated to the saints Imhotep and Amcnhotep, who were
reiered in the Ptolemaic period. The reliefs and inscriptions of this
late period compare very unfavourahly with the masterly sculptures
of Ilatshepsut.

0n the upper part of the right wall of the let Chamber is a, noteworthy
scene: Hatehepsut, Thntmosis 111., and the princess Iia-horru sarpciliee to
the boat of Amen, behind which stood Thutmosis I. with his consort
Ahmes, and their little daughter Bit-norcu. A similar scene was repre-

sented above the recess (PL a) on the left wall; the kneeling Thutmosis m.
and Princess Ramofru may still be distinguished.

Immediately to the S., adjoining the temple of Hatshepsut, lies
a smaller temple dating from the beginning of the Middle Empire »
This is the Mortuary Temple of Kings Meutuhotep III. and w,

erected over his subterranean tomb (see p. 305) a terrace with coi-
onuades and a pyramid, as well as tombs and chapels for the women
of his harem. The structure was extended and completed by his
successor Mentuhotep IV., who also chose to have his tomb here.
This is the earliest Thehan temple known to us and it is of great
interest from the simplicity of its architecture. It was excavated by
the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1905-7. - Like the large temple
it is constructed in terraces. From the COURT, bounded on the W.
side by two COLONNADES with rectangular pillars (with the cartouche
of Neh-khru-réJ, an inclined plane leads to a higher Teanece, on
which stood the actual mortuary temple with the pyramid. Beyond
a vestibule which has almost completely disappeared, but which
formerly extended to the N. and fi., lies the New CHAMBER, a large
hall with 140 octagonal pillars. 1n the middle of the hall rose a
