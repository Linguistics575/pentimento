368 Rouic 2f. 1'11lLdi. Temple of 1m.

An inner staircase ascends to the W, tower (camp, the Plan), whence
we proceed across the central portal to the E. tower. The ascent, however,
is not worth making except when the iirst pylon is inaccessible.

Within the doorway, at the top, to the right, are some much
faded isarly-0hristian pictures.

The Temple of Isis proper, entered by this portal, consisted of
an open court (here Very small), a vestibule or promos, several
auteehambers, and a sanctuary, with smaller chambers adjoining.
The walls are covered both outside and inside with reliefs of Ptole-
mies CPhiladislphns, liuergetas IL, etc.) and Roman empemrs (Au-
gustus, Tiberius, Antoniuus) performing the customary ceremonies
in the guise of Pharaohs; but the traveller will iirrd detailed de-
eCIiptions ofsimilar scenes in our accounts of thetemples ofDemiera
(p. 245) and Fulfil (p. 314 ].

The Court had a small eolonuade on each side, the roof ofwhich
rested on a single column. The uncovered portion could be shaded
front the sun by means of a velariuin, the holes for the cords are
'still visible in the upper part of the C0i1ClWty cernice turned towards
the second pylon.

The Vestibule, with eight columns t was originally separated
from the preceding court by stone screens between the ti1st row of
columns. The colouring of this hall, Which has been preserved on
the ceilings and the columns, must have been Very brilliant. The
floral capitals of the columns both in the court and in the hall are the
most instructive of all the specimens that have come down to us of
the manner in which tho Egyptians of the later period coloured their
columns. Jympirrativisly little regard was paid to the natural colours;
rig. light green palm-twigs receive blue ribs, etc. Christian services
"ere celebrated in the eourt and vestibule, of which the numerous
Coptic crosses ohisalled in the walls ale mernorialg. A Greek iu-
scription in the doorway to Room D, on the right, recm-de that'this
good work' took place under Bishop Theodorug. That was in the
reign of Justinian (p. Mm).

The small Anteetuunhers (PLD, E, F) preceding the sanctuary
are adjoined by chambers lying in darkness. The Sanctuary, which
has two tiny windows, still contains a pedestal placed here by Euer-
getes I. and his wife llerenice, on which stood the sacred boat with
the image ol'lsis.

The other moms in the inner part of the temple do notrepay a visit.
Room: 7111, VII, and VI contain fine large reliefs ofPtolcmy Philadelphus,
some of which retain their vivid colouring. The small Court in Which sa-
'yriiiees used to be made is embellished with reliefs of Philadelphus saevilie
ing and pouring water upon an aim. There are cellars beneath all these

mums and the sanctuary, but the ceilings and floors have in many cases
fallen in,

To the W. ofAntcchamher D is a small room (Pl. 1), embellished
with representations of the king before Isis. A door (Pl. it; see
p. 369) hela affords an exit from the temple. Here also is the ap-
proaeh to the Sumclssu, ascending first to a chamber situated above
