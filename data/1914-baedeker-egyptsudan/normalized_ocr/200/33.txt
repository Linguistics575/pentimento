labour and of sweetening his rephse. A peculiarity orthe Egyptian songs,
however, is that they have 110 lune, though they have u certain rhythm,
which is always dependent on the text. They are sung through the nose

and, to th Eumpczui e11; displeasing. The songs (muwwdl m" slmyhl) are

Shadow Plays (Kha'iy61 ey-WO, formerly among the most pop-
ular spectacles in Egypt, the history of which can be traced hack
to the 13th cent., are still to he met with, though seldom, in the
larger towns, especially Uairo (eomp.p. 42) and Alexandria.

Comedy of the Cmeent (WI) ee-tieir) and the Comedy of the Ship (11w 11-

and long-winded verse. The frgures are cut out of coloured trauslurent
leather and, by means ufsruall wooden sticks, irrepressed againstan illu-
minated cinth in front of the Mage, so that theh- shadows are visible on
the other side of the cloth. The entertainer, generally supported by

Arab Baths. The haths of Itr, ypt, with their hot- is chambers,
are those commonly known as Turkish, but they are neither so clean
nor so well iltted up as some of those in the larger cities of Europe.
They are therefore seldom visited by Europeans. Those who wish
to try them once should do so early in the morning, and should
avoid Fridays, as numerous Moslems bathe on that day, which is
their Sabbath. When a cloth is hung up at the entrance to the
baths, it indicates that 11 omen only are admitted.
