1. PRELIMINARY INFORMATION, IO, Arabic



(IO). The Egyptian Dialect "Arabic.
By Dr. Curt Priifer.

The Tl-sts-vs- of Arabic vocal sounds, so intensely JiOrent
lrom our own, in'the' ordinary Latin alphabet is rendered additionally
d'rt'lieult by the varied international relations of Egypt. In maps and plans,
in railway time-tables, and in other publications we find the transliteration
ditreriaq widely according as the French or the English view has been
adopted. In this Handbook we have transliterated the consonantal sounds
so far as possible according to English usage (e.g., an instead of the French
ch). The pronunciation of the vowels and diphthongs is as follows: a as a
in caches, a usually as a in final; 5 as e in belong oi- as a in fuoal,. eh at
the end of a word as a in final; i as u in been, i as i in did, final i as u
in been; a as a in bone, a as o in on; a as ea in fool, u as u. in full; at
as i in ice; an as aw in owl; ep' as a in lane; oi as oy in boy. Thus:
muir, which is pronounced'emeer'; fums, pronounced'fauoos", sheikli,
pronounced'shake' (with a guttural k), etc. - The; of the article is
lrcqueutly unassimiiated; e.g. el-rais instead of er-rds (camp. p. xxx).

Arabic belongs to the Semitic group of languages and has no
relationship with the tongues of Europe. The classic language of
the Koran is still regarded as the unrivalled model oflitetaryArabio,
but side by side with it there have developed various colloquial
dialects, (littering widely among themselves, of which that spoken
in Egypt is one. In the following brief sketch references to the
classic literary language are avoided as far as possible; for that, re-
course must be had to the accepted grammars (see p. clxxxviii).
Even in Egypt there are variations in the dialects spoken, but
the following remarks apply especially to the language as spoken
in Cairo, which is generally understood throughout the country.

On p. xxix we give the Arabic Alphabet, with the sounds
1orresportding to the different letters so far as it is possible to re-
present or describe them to the English reader. - Arab writing
runs from right to left. Long vowels are indicated by the letters
Elit', Wan, and Yei (comp. p. xxix), while short vowels are often
left out altogether "represented by special signs placed above or
below the consonants.

QUANTITY AND ACCENTIIATIDN 01v Vowmis. Vowels with a "
eI1iut1ex accent e) are long; other vowels are short. The accent
falls on the last syllable when that contains a long vowel or a short
vowel followed by two consonants. It falls on the penultimate Cl)
when that is long, (2) when it ends in a single consonant, and (N
when the preceding syllable is long or ends in a single consonant.
In all other cases the accent falls on the antepenuitimatc. Diph-
thongs (ai, ei, an) must be xeckoned as equivalent to long vowels.

The pronunciation of short vowels varies rumsirlerably according tothe
consonants adjoining as well as according to the culture of the speakers-,
