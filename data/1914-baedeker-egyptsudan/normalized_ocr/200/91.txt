The foundation is the Koran (p. Ixxxixl, the YU'ry word of God,
which was collected and published as early as 650AJ). This 1',00-

fellow this example in all its details became, doubtless lllltlel the
itotenee or the Jewish spirit, the aim of every believer. The Hunmt

vehicles of religious controversy. To sift them and to harmonize
their contradictory sayings has given rise to a science of itself. In
this process the consensus or agreement of the learned (1guu'f) uae

Suunu, and indeed over the Koran itself, for only the lgmft' was able
rightly to interpret the Koran. The ew/scholars of Islim too re-

When the Arabs became masters of the ancient civilized countries
ot' the Near East, there arose at once a crop of unforeseen legal pro-
blems, which had to be solved according to the Snnna, or at least in
their spirit. The impulse to independent legal activityin the newly-
eonqnewd lands was given (as in the'Irdl: by Abu Hanffa, d.767)
by the prB-Justinian Roman law that had been accepted by the
Christian church. Against this intellectual independence, which
allowed room for differenegs of opinion, arose the orthodox party at
Medina (Mam.- ibn Anus: d. 795), who admitted only the letter or
