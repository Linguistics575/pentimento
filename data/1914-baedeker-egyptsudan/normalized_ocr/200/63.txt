begun by Franciscans at the end of the 17th and beginning of the
18th cent, has been less successful among the Gopts. There are,
however, tt few small Roman Cathoiie communities in Upper Egypt

Catholic Copts', whose patriarch, Cyrillos il., consecrated in fty29,

is likewise named Cyrillos.

nomadic Arabs, and'Arab (sing.'Arasz to those who immigrated
at a later period and settled in the valley of the Nile. They
both differ materially from the dwellers in towns and from the
fullehin. The subdivisions of the Beduin tribes are called { (abilcli.
Though differitrg greatlyin origin and language, the wandering tribes
of Egypt all profess Arol1iuuu1elutism. Again, while some of them
have immigrated from Arabia "Syria, partly in very ancient and
partly in modern times, and while others are supposed to be the
aboriginal inhabitants of the territories claimed by them (as the
Berbers of N. Africa and the Ethiopians and Blemmyes of Nubia),
or former dwellers on the Nile expelled from their homes by foreign
invaders, they all diiter greatly from the settled Egyptianpopuiation;
and this contrast is accounted for by the radical difference between
the iiti1ueuees ofthe desert and those of the Nile valley.

According to the census 0 (1907 there were (335,019, Beduins
in Egypt, of whom 537,631 were settled in towns and villages.

The lieduins may be divided into two leading groups: ft ] Beduins

have probabl immigrated from Arabia or Syria, and who occupy
the deserts adjoining Central and Northern Egypt besides to a C0tl-
siderable extent settling in the Nile valley; (2) Beau, who range
over the regions of Upper Egypt and Nubia situated between the
Nile and the lied Sea, and extending to the frontiers "the Abyssi-
nian mountains, These are the descendants of the ancient Blem-
inyes (p. 386; their territory being known as'Jidhai'j. The two prin-
cipal races of the second group, oith whom alone we have to deal
as inhabitants of Egypt, are the BisWsria and the'Abdbtlelt. They
are widely scattered in the valleys of the desert (pp. 372 ei: ser),

possess an original language of their own C'to-bedyawiyeh0, which,
however, they have long siure exchanged for bad Arabic. They
