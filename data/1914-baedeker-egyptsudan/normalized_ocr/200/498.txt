reign of Nero and other Roman emperors. Thelarge scenes on the s.
rear wall show Ptolemy XVI. Cresar, son of Julius Caesar, and his
mother, Cleopatra, in presence of the gods of Dendera. In the
centre is the image of the goddess Hathor. The faces are purely
conventional and in no sense portraits. The projeetinglions' heads
on the sides of the building were intended to carry off therain-water.

To the right (N.WO ofthe entrance to the temple of Hathor lies
the so- called Birth House, a small temple not yet quite freed from
de'bris. Similar'birth houses' were erected beside all large temples
of the Ptolemaie period. They were dedicated to the Worship of the
sons of the two deities revered iu the main temple, in the present
case to Har-sem- tewe (p. 245). This Girth house Was built by
Augustus and some of Its reliefs were added by Trajan and Hadrian,

ahnui of which are adorned with figures of Bes, the patron deity of
women in labour.

INTERIOR. We first enter a vestibule, from which open on the right
a chamber with a flight of steps and a door to the Colonnade, and on the
left two other apartments. A duur in the middle admits to a wide space, out
of which open three other doors. Those at the sides lead to corridors,
while that in the centre opens into the birth-ehamher proper, the mural
reliefs in which represent the birth and nursing of the divine infant.

Buried in rubbish immediately to the S. ot' the Birth House is
a large Coptic Church.

Behind the temple of Hathor (to the S.W.) is a Temple of Isis,
consisting of a vestibule and three ehambers. The unattractive and
uninteresting building owes its origin to the Emperor Augustus.
