1. Railway Journey to f.Tawhra and mahtin. The railway,
following the same course as the highmad, leads at first along
the bank of the Barr Ytistsf, with the pyramid of Hawira to the
left, to the village of f.fuluYeh (Kohafa). Farther on it traverses
cultivated tielrls, with the heights of Gebel Sediment to the right,
and reaches the station of Hawdra, beside the village of Hawaret
el-Malcja', with its pretty mosque (route hence to the pyramid, see
below). To the left is a large cemetery, with the graves ofsheikhs.
- The railway new again approaches the Baht Yt1suf. The remains
of old embankments which we see from the train ilate from the
period of the Caliphs. - Stat. Balm Seileh (Siala). We then cross
the Ruhr Seileh el-Gedfd, which diverges from the Bah: Ytsuf. The
pyramid of Illahtul becomes visible on the left. The train cp-
proaches the margin of the desert. - The station of Bash-IMO
is the starting-point for the pyramid of Illalr0n (p. 196 ]. - The
train then traverses fertile land to Illahnn or El.ujahtia (Egypt.
Le-h6ne, i.e.'mouth of the canal', see p. 190), a village with 3785
inhab., situated on the right bank of the Tinhr Ytssuf. Close to the
railway station is the sluice-hridge ('pont régulatcur') through
which the Bath: Yrisuf enters the Faiytam. Beyond the bridge is the
village of Human:'Edhtn or'Eglan, a picturesque place situated
on the water. Ahout 2M. to the S.W. of Jllahton, close to the edge
of the desert, is the ruined town of Medina! (hsr6b, discovered by
Professor Flinders Petrie. It owed its origin to Thutmosis m., who
built l temple here.

2. The Pyramid of ITawua, the tomb of Amemtht IH., is
reached from the village of Hawéret el-Malqa' [ see above) in about
3/4 hr. The route leads to the N., through fields, to the desert
plateau on which the yyramid stands. We then cross a bridge over
the Balm Seileh el-Gedid, which intersects the plateau, The pyramid
consists of crude bricks, and, when its sides Were perfect, covered an
area atroutH5yds. square. The limestone inerustation, however, hai1
disappeared even in the Roman period. The nucleus of the struc-
ture is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in height. The dilapidated
summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a well-wom path.
The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side (now impassable),
was discovered in 1889 by Prof. Flinders Petrie. An intricate
series ofpassages in the interior leads to the tomb-eharnber in which
Amenemhet III. and his daughter Ptah-uofru were interred.

On the S. the pyramid Was adjoiued hythe large mortuary temple
of Amenemhét. This edifiee, however, which served as a quarry for
eenturies after the Roman period, has completely vanished, with
the exception of an extensive syace strewn with small splinters of
stone and fragments of fine granite and limestone columns. Traces
