PLAN. The intending visitor to Egypt may make an outline of
his tour at home with as great ease as for any of the countries of
Europe. A glimpse of the country may be obtained ind or5 weeks
(exclusive or the journey out) as follows: 2 days may be devoted
to Alexandria and the journey thence to Cairo - travellers landing
at Port Sa'id should take the tirst train to Cairo, as the town is
uninteresting--10 days may he spent in Cairo and its neighbour
hood (pp. 35 et seq.), f2 days sufiiee for the rtrilwtry-jouruey to As-
suin and back (or'20 days by a tourist-steamer), and 3 days may be
given to Assuén (p. 353), while a few days must be set aside for
resting. An exclusion to the Faiyrirn (R. 14) or to the oasis of
Khérgeh (y. 379) takes 3-4 days. - An expedition to Upper Nubia
(from Assuin tu wam lllalfa and back) requires 7 days by tourist »
steamer (see 11.384); but if the quicker government steamer (p. 383 ]
is used and the railway from l Tuii Balm, the excursion can be ex-
tended to liharthn (p. 4'li0 within almost the same period. A month
should be allowed for the steamer-trip from Ifharyim to Gondohoru
(Kejaf) and bark o. 434), and k days for the return from Klrarttun
to Suez vii Port Sudan (ll. 33)..

Smsox. The best time for a tour in Egypt is between Nov. lst
and May ist, Jan. to March luring the most crowded period. In
Alexandria stormy and rainy weather very often prevails trom
December to March, but in the interior of Iigygt, to the S. of
a line joit. lg Danrauhtar, Tants, and Jl; 1nyira, the case is con-
siderably tered. liven in the Delta, however, marked falls in
temperature (sometimes tu 43° Fahr.) occur between the end of
November and the am } of March, and rain-storms, rendering the
roads almost. impassable, are not infrequent. la Cairo December,
January, and sometimes February are distinctly chilly, which is the
more inconvenient as there are no adequate heating-arrangements
in the houses; but November and March are very tine, as also
usually are October, April, and May, especially for travellers who
do not object to a little heat. In Upper Egypt, from the beginning of
November till the middle or end of April, the prevalent weather is
that of a delicious spring ox moderate summer. Those who intend to
winter in Egypt should spend November in Cairo, move on thence in
December, on the approach of cold weather, to Upper Egypt0ssor,
Assuin), and retnm to Cairo in February. - In summer prices are
naturally much lower, but most of tlw, larger hotels are closed.

Exmcigms. The cost of a tour in Egypt, and in oriental coun-
tries generally, a greater than that ot'a visit to most parts of Europe,
and the traveller should estimate his average daily expenditure at
