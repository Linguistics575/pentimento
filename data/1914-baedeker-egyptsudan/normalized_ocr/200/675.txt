vestibule, and elsewhere. It "as converted into a church on the
introduction of Christianity. The building is in comparatively good
preservation and has recently been restored.

The approach to the temple (comp. the Plan, p. 390) is formed
by a Causeway, about 100 ft. long and 25 ft. broad, constructed of
hewn stones and still in excellent preservation. At the end next

the landward end a flight of low steps ascends to a long and narrow
platform immediately in front of the pylon.
