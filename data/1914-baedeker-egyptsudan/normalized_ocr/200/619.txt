the towers served to admit tight and air to the chambers and stair-
vases within (sen p. 347).

A passage leads through each pylou-tower to the outside of the girdle-
wall, which is embellished with colossal reliefs (Ptolemy XL before the
gods of Earn) and bears the inscriptions mentioned at p. Mt. In front
of the pylon stand two colossal falcons in dark granite. One has the
figure of a. priest in Roman costume before it,

The Court, between the pylon and the vestibule, is a spacious
enclosure, paved with broad flags and surrounded on three sides
by a 1yovisriu1 Colonnade of 32 columns. In this court rose the
great altar upon which offerings were made to the gods of Edfu
in presence of the assembled people. The columns supporting the
roof of the tolonnade are embellished with rich floral and palm
capitals. The incised reliefs on the shafts show the king before
llorus and the other gods of ham; the name of the king has not
been inserted in the inscriptions. On the ten walls of the colon-
nades are three rows oflarge reliefs, showing the Pharaoh (Ptolemy
Soter II. or Ptolemy Alexander) in communion with the gods or
triumphing over his foes, as the earthly representative of Horus.
The same representations occur over and over again in wearisome
repetition throughout the temple.

exits (Pl. c) are built up.

The back of this court is formed by the front of the vestibule,
which is crowned by a concave cornice. On each side of the
large portal are three stone screens between the columns. Upon
these, facing the court, are reliefs representing Euergetes 11. with
pendent arms or offering saeritiee to Hathot of Dendera (on the two
central screens) "to the faleor1-hrsaded Horus of Edfu (on the
others). To the left of the entrance stands a colossal falcon with
the double crown; the corresponding falcon on the right lies on
the ground.

The Vestibule, or Pranaos, has t2 columns with elaborate t1oral
capitals. The ceiling is covered with astronomical representations,
now blackened almost beyond recognition. 0n the walls are four
rows ofincised reliefs, showing Euergetes saeriileiug to the gods
and performing other religious rites, such as the ceremonies at
the foundation of the temple, etc. Above are a row of astronomical
representations and a frieze consisting of the names of the king
guarded by two falcons, Close to the pavement we see Euergetes aml
