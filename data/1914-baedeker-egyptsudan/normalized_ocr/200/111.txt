ekiah of Judah) against the Assyrians.

700688. Sehiehoa (Shubatuhu).

638-603. Tahnrka [ the Tirhukah of the Bible) also assisted the princes

of Syria and Palestine against the Assyrians t but was

1 defeated in 070 by Esarhadden, King of Assyria, and after

the capture afhlemphis compelled to take refuge in Ethio-
pia. Bath Upper and Lower Egypt became subject to the
Assyrians, the various lanai princes [ surh as Necho of
Sais, etc.) becoming vassals of the invaders. Various at-
tempts to expel the latter failed.

663. Tanutamun. son of Shabako, succeeded in recevering Egypt
for a brief period, but was finally defeated by the Assyr-
ians and driven back into Upper Egypt.

The Assyrian rule in Egypt was, however, approachingits
end. The absence of the main Assyrian forces, which were
engaged in distant wars in Babylon and Elam, airorded
an opportunity of shaking oif the yoke, which was seized
by Psarnmetiehos of Sars, son of Necha (see above), with the
help of Gyges, King of Lydia. The foreign garrisons were
expelled; the authority of the small native princes was
gradually curbed; and Egypt was again united. Since then
Ethiopia has been separate from Egypt.

-xxv1. DYNASTY (663-55 15.0.).

Egypt now enjoyed another period of prosperity. Trade began to
flourish owing to the new relations with Greece. Art also received
a fresh impetus; even before the Ethiopian kings artists had begun
to imitate the models of the classic period of Egyptian art under
the Ancient Empire. This reversion to an earlier era appeared also
in other departments, such as literature, the spelling ofinscriptions,
and even the titles of "litsials, so that the period of the 26th Dyu.
may he styled the Egyptian Renaissance.

609-593. Necho (Ntkaw). While the Assyrians were engrossed in a
deadly contest with the Babylonians and Medea Nacho

however, defeated at Carchemish by Nehnol1sdneazar, King
of Babylon, and thus lost their possessions in Syria and
