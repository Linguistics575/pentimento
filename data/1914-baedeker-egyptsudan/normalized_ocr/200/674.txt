with with floral capitals, connected by stone screens, little now re-
mains. The reliefs on the facade show Augustus or Tiherins in pres-
ence of various deities. The side-walls efthe Firstllall are decorated
with reliefs in two rows, exhibiting Ezekher-Amnn saeriiieing to
various deities. Over the door is a votive inscription of the same
monarch. Thence we proceed through an Anteelwmber (without de-
coration) to the Sanctuary, whioh contains afGranite Naps, dating
trom Euergetes ll. and Cleopatra (p. cis). The edjaining chambers
contain nothing of interest.

At Dimri (W. bank) is an ancient wall; and an the E. bank
farther an is the fragment of a quay-wall, with a staircase. The
island ofiilorgos (Marlene), next passed, has some picturesque ruins
ol' houses, apparently of medimval origin.

Ctr/ell. nehmil (lrelrmiet), on both banks, is a steamboat station.
- 25 M. Ambarkub, with considerable hamlets on both banks.

To the right (W. bank) next appears the small temple of
Kertassi (Ginny), an attractive building on a tacky plateau, recall-
ing the'kiosyre' at Phila, (p. 370). It is only 25 ft. square.
Columns, connected hy stone screens, once supported the roof, of
which only a single eross-beam now remains. Two IIath0r-rr0lumns
(at the entrance, which faces N.) and four other columns with elab-
orate 11ower-eapitals (two an each side) are now standing.

To the s. is an emhankment constructed to protect the valley
from inundation, and farther on are extensive'Sandstone Quarries,
which yielded the stone for the temples at Philze. They contain
numemus Greek votive inscriptions (and one demotie) dating from
the Roman imperial epoch (Antoninns, Marcus Aurelius, Septi-
min: Severus, Caracalla, Gordian } These are addressed to Isis and
to the Nubian deities Smptichis and Pursepmunis. Two busts in
high relief and an empty niche, with an Egyptian doorway, also
deserve notice. .- At the end of the quarries (3/4 M. from the
temple) is a Roman Fort (perhaps the ancient Tzitzi), with a
girdle-wall of lame hewn stones, the inner core of which has dis-
appeared, leaving only the outer shell. The gateway on the N. side
shows the Egyptian ronceve corniee. On the W, side we may trace
the ancient ditch.

Farther on the river-valley narrows and lofty eliffg approach
close to the stream.

Tafeh (Teifeli, Teifa; W. bank), the ancient Taphis. On the river
bank are the remains of a narrow quay, on the s. side of which is a
small uilometer. The little Temple, of the Roman period, was left
unfinished and has no mural reliefs. The entrance faces the S. The
facade is supported by two columns with elaborate floral capitals.
In the interior of the temple are four standing columns, with I1oral
capitals. - To the N. are the remains of some large structures,
perhaps the relics of a t'ortitied campt - To the S. of the village
