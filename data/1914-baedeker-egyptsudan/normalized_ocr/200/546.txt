3. The Temple of Sethoe I. at Kumat

From the Ianding-place of the ferry-boat on the W. bank we
ride first in a southerly direction, then pass between the hamlets ol'
Naga' or-Hizlgeh and Nagar al-Ba'ir√©t to the Fitriliytsh Canal, which
we cross to the N. at Naga' et-TM, where a light railway (for cen-
Verlag sugar-eane) approaches it. In about 3/4 hr. we reach the -

*Temple of Sethos L, which was founded in honour at Amen
by Sethos L, and at the same time was devoted to the worship of
the king and of his father, ltamses I. Sethos left it unfinished and
Ramses II.'renewed' it, Le. embellished it with reliefs and inserip-
tions. The beautiful execution of these recalls the contemporary
sculptures at Ahydos (p. 238). The original building was 518 ft. in
length, but of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 154 ft. in depth, remains, while then are but scanty
relics of the former courts and pylons.

The Colonnade ou the frant of the temple originally displayed
10 clustered papyn1s-eohunns with bud-capitals, but only S are now
left. 0n the architmve is the dedicatory inscription of Ramses II. In
its inner wall are three doors (Pl.a, 11,0), which lead into the three
divisions of the temple. On this wall, to the left of Pl. b, are Tepre-
sentations of the provinces of Upper Egypt (a man and woman alttyr-
nately), hearing dedicatory gifts; to the right, similar reliefs of the
provinces of Lower Egypt. The former have lilies on their heads,
the latter papyri - the il0tal emblems of the two regions. Above
the former the king offers incense to the bark of Amou carried by
priests; above the latter the king appears before various deities.

Passing through the middle door (PL b) we enter a Bypostyle
Hell with G papyrus-bud columns, f1ar1lrtyd on each side by three
uhambers (PLd-i). On the, slabs ofthe roorof the middle aisle appear
the. winged sua-disk, flyiug Vultures, and the names of Sethos 1.,
between two vertical rows of lderoglyphies. The low reliefs on the
walls show Sethos l. and Ramses IL sacrificing to various deities.
Those at Pl. ty. and at Pl. v3represent respectively Nut and Hather of
Dendera nourishing, Sethos. - Side Chamberst Chamber y is ruined;
the ceilings in Chambers d, f, and h are in good condition. The.
finely executed reliefs in Chambers e, f, h, and i depict Sethos J.
offering saryrifiees or performing sacred ceremonies in presence of
various deities. 1n Chamber i: on the left wall, Thaut before the
sarred bark of the king; on the. right wall, (left) the king seated at
