series of rapids, over rocks of greywacke, greenetone, and granite,
forming numerous rocky islands in its course. The best point of
view is the abrupt rocky hill of Aburh, on the W. bank. At the
foot of the bill, contrasting strongly with the green of the tarnarisk-
trees, lies a chaos of glistening black boulders, through which the
river forces its way in foaming cataracts, especially tim, at the time
of the inundation. In the distance to the N, are the white houses
anti slender minaret of Whit H_alfa on the E. bank, and the great
sycamore and the pylon ofthe S. temple of Buhen (p.412) on theW.
bank; to the W., beyond the broad river, rise the mountains of the
desert; to the S. lie the rocky islets among the rapids. Numerous
modern hevellers (including Champollion, p. cxxvi) have left irt-
scriptions on the rock of Aburir.

Thence the route leads through the desert to (1 hr.) the village of
Afat0ya, on the river. In another hour we reach Mirgisseh, a fortress
of the Middle Empire, situated on a steep rock close to the Nile.
Within the gird1s-wall, which is built partly of sumdried bricks and
partly of rubble, are the scanty ruins of a small temple erected by
Sesostris III. On the island of Dabeh, nearly opposite, are some
antient Egyptian fortiiieatiotts. - The route leads round the steep
rocks lying to the S. of Mirgisseh and returns to the river-hank
through a picturesque deiile. 0n the opposite (W) bank lies'Abkeh.

rained Christian domed tombs, several of which contain remains
of frescoes end inscriptions.

The second day's march leads through the desert for the first
six hours. We regain the river opposite Sanas. Numerous rocky
islets interrupt the stream; on one of those, to the S., are the ruins
of an Arab castle, perched upon a rock. Alternately skirting the
river and traversing the desert for another hour, we next reach Shal-
