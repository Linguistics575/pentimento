not less than 25-30s. (Steamboat and railway fares are of course
extra; pp. 1-6.) The traveller whose time is very limited, or who
is accompanied by ladies, will require also the services of a guide,
or'dragomwn' (p. xxv; 5-103. per day). With modest requirements,
however, it is possible to live more cheaply.

MONEY. A small sum of money for the early part of the journey
may be taken in English or French gold, but large sums should
always be in the form of letters of credit or circular notes. These
are issued by the principal London banks and by Messrs. Thus.
Cook & Son. Travellers proceeding to Upper Egypt may deposit
these notes in Cairo and have supplies sent after them, as required,
by money orders. European bankers in Alexandria and Cairo, sec

most Egyptian towns and also in kharttun, Suékin, and Port Sudan.
The cheques issued by thcA'merican Express Companies, the Ameri-
can Bankers' Association, and the International Navigation Co. are
convenient also. - For Jimmy Orders, see p. xix.

suits, a few flaunel and soft cotton shirts, a supply of thin woollen
socks, one pair of light and easy boots, one of shoes, and one of
slippers, a moderately Warm ulster or long travelling cloak, a pith
helmet and a soft felt hat or a straw hat, together with the most
necessary articles of the toilet, will amply suftiee. Evening dxess is
nsnany worn at dinner at the principal hotels. Biding-trreetybes
and gaiters are convenient for excursions. All articles should be
new and strongly made, "it is often diffityttlt to get repairs properly
executed in Egypt. Few travellers walk in Egypt, except for very
short distances, but sportsmen should add a stout pair orwaterproof
shooting-boots to their equipment.

drinking-cup of leather or metal, n flask, a strong poelret-kniN, a thermo-
meter, A pocket-compass, a Iield » glass, and an eleclric, acetylene, nrimag-
nesium lamp for lighting cavern; and dark chambers. - Photographic

that even the inexperienced traveller will have Jittle,'diriieulty in
managing an independent tour, without recourse to the assistance
of toul" rst-agents or ot dragonmns (p. XXV), which add considerably
to the cost. - In spring and autumn Tnums'r PARTIES are organized
