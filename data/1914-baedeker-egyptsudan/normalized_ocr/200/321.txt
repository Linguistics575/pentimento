lem burial-ground and at a short distance in front of us the old
aqueduct o. 116). A little to the right, on an eminence, rises an
old ruined mosque (G & mi' Abu Srs'ad), beyond it is the Citadel
with the mosque of Mohammad Ali, and farther distant are the
Mokettam Hills with the mosque of Giytsshi (p. 116), This view is
very striking towards sunset. The road, which becomes bad farther
on, leads round the rained mosque and ascends heaps of du'bris.
On the top of the hill it divides. The hunch to the left leads hack
to the town. The road, tlrst in a straight direction, afterwards in-
clining to the tight, leads to the mosque of [ mint Shityi (p. 115).

The meditevai Arab mausolea of Egyptian rulers, which, under
the names Tomb, of the Caliphs and Tombs of the Mamelukes, stretch
along the entire E. side of the city, were erected mainly by the
Circassian Mamehlkc Sultans. The name'Tombs of the Caliphs',
applied to the northernmost group, is historieally a misnomer, for
the tombs have no connection with the Ahhasidc caliphs then re-
sident in Egypt and treated as mere titled puppets. These mosque-
tomhs were once each provided with l numerous staff of sheikhs
and attendants. The revenues of the mosques having been eor1-
tiseated at the beginning of the 19th century, the tombs gradually
fell to ruin. Now, however, the Committee mentioned at p. 43 has
taken them into its keeping.

The usual route to the *Tomhs of the Celiphs (Arab. Turab
el-Kluilafa or Turab JiWit Bey) leaves the city vii the Muski o. 53)
and its prolongations. It then traverses the mounds of potsherds
known as the Windmill Hills (p. 114) and reaches the still-used
cemetery iturtrtet el-gift/O, By the roadside lie large mausolea
(Arab. Â£16511), with courts and rooms occupied during certain festi,
vals by the relatives oi the deceased. We tlrst reach the tosab-
mosque of Cait Bey, to the N. of which is that of Bark.illi. Hence
we return to the city by one of the routes descrihed below.

Those who wish to combine a visit to the Citadel (p438) with
that to the Tombs of the Caliphs should select the route from the
Bib el-Attsiba (P1. F, 5) to the Iptit Bey Mosque (comp. p.114).

It is, however, more convenient to begin with the N. group of
tombs. In this case we quit Cairo hy the Ihih en-Na/r (Pl. E,'Y,
p. 77) and pass the Mohammedan cemetery. To the right are the
Windmill Hills (p.114). Beyond the unimportant tomb of Shaikh
(r" ahit we have one of the th1est *Views of the city of the dead.

The N.E. group of the mausolea, which is hardly worth visiting,
consists of the Tomb of an I'Tmfr ofSulhrn F2-GMiri (p, 59), a cube
