The Island of Philm.

Philae, once the'pearl of Egypt', is 500 yds.iu length and 100 ytls.
in breadth, and consists of a crystalline granite mixed with horu-
blende, beneath the alluvial deposits of the Nile. The modern name
is borrowed from the Greeks, and is derived from the ancient Egyp-
tian I'i-lak, or the'island of Lak'. The Copts called it I'ilakh, Le.
"the tome )", and the Arabs used to call it Bilah.

Now-a-days the island is called pl-yet?" or GezirelAn/u elJI'ognd, after
the hero of one of the taies in the Thousand and One Nights, which has
its scene transferred to Philm in the Egyptian version, The name Philae
is known to the natives only through its use by tourists,

The boatmeu relate it as follows, Once upon a time there wit: a.
king, who had a handsome favourite named Ana: el-Wogad, anti avisier,
whose daughter was named Zulrr el-Wm'd, Le. Flower of the Rose. The
two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found oppor-
tunities of meeting secretly, until they Were discovered through the ine
prudence of the maiden'a attendant. The vizier was violently enraged
end, in order to secure his daughter from the Further pursuit of the
yvnng man, despatched her to the island or Philw, where he caused her
to be imprisoned in a strong castle (the temple of Isis) and closely
guarded. But Anas el-hroggd eahld hot forget his love. He forsook the
court and wandered far and wide in search of her, and in the course of
his travels showed kindness to various animals in the desert and else-
where. At last a hermit told him that he would iiud Zahr eI-Ward oh
the island otPhiie Â», He arrived on the bank of the river and beheld the
walls of the castle, but was nimble to reach the island, for the water all
around it was alive with tycoeodilem. As he stood lamenting his fate one of
the dangerous monsters ntrered to convey him to the island on his hank, out
of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness to animals. Thelover
was thus able to reach the prison of his mistresg, and the guards suffered
him to remain on the island, as he represented hlmsclfto be a persecuted
merchant from a distant land. Birds belonging to Zahr el-Ward assured
him that she was on the island, but he could never obtain sight of her.
Meanwhile the htdy also became 11nahlrslm1ger to endure her fate. Letting
herself down from her prison-window by means of a rope made of her
clothes, she found a compassionate ship-master, who conveyed her from
the island in which the lover she sought then was. Then Followed another
period of search and tiually the meeting of the lovers. A marriage, with
the consent of the father, ends the tale.

The name ofPhila does not occur in any of the earlier inscrip-
tions, and even Herodotus, who visited Elephautiue during his
journey on the Nile (ca. 460 Bt.), makes no mention of this island.
The first mention of Phila, dates from the reign of NektamMs
tea. 350 BAI; p. Cvii), to which the oldest temple buildings on the
island belong. But there is little doubt that Philae was inhabited
and adorned with temples at an earlier period than that.

The chief deity of Phila, Was the goddess Iain; but Osiris audWephthys,
Hath" (p. 370), Khrmm and Satet, the gods of the cataracts. and other
deities were likewise worshipped here. The imposing buildings which
tend the island its ehameterietie appearance were erected by the Ptole-
mies during the last two centuries 3.0. and the Roman emperors during
the first three Christian centuries. Numerous inscriptions inform us that
Greek ttnd Roman pilgrims Meked in crowds to the shrine of the mysteri-
ous, benign, and healing goddess Isis. We know also that the goddess of
Phila? was worshipped hy the predatory Nubiens and by the Biemmycs
(p. 386), and that, even after their battle! with the Emperor Marcian
