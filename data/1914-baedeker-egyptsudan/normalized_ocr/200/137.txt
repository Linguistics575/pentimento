Cursive Style, which is usually termed Ilierutic Writing. In tlris

style the owl m, which in literary hieroglyphics (written from

right to left) bad the form 2/ d, 1legerursates into } an

outline scarcely recognizable as that or an owl. In hieratie writing
we possess literary works of almost every kind except dramas. -
Further abbreviations and atnalgamatiorrs ot' letters developed an-
other cursive style from the hierntiu, viz. the Enchoriut or Demotic,
which was the ordinary vharacter employed in the Grmeo-Roman
period. The sign of the owl, for example, was curtailed to D. This
writing was el1iefly used for contracts, accounts. letters, and similar
documents, whence it was sometimes termed the Epistolographiu,
"'epistolary eharaeter', by the Greeks.

During the seeoud century after Christ Egyptian magical formuln'
were frequently written in Greek characters; aml after the intro-
duction of Christianity it became the universal custom to write the
Egyptian translations oi the Scriptures iu the simpler Greek letters
instead of in the inconvenient ltieroglyphies, which were at the
same time more Jitliorlt to learn. But as the Greek alphabet was
not adequate to represent all the li'ryptian sounds (e.g. sh, f, lch, ete.1
seven supplementary symbols'r were borrowed from the demotie.
'l'hns arose the Coptic Writing of the Egyptian Christians.

The use of hicreglyphies extended beyond the borders of Egypt,
especially into Nubia, where they were employed in the temples
built by the Pharaohs. And even after the Nubian-Ethiopiau
kingdom berame independent ot' Egypt in the b'th cent. 13.0.,
hieroglyphies still continued to be used there. At tirst, however,
only inscriptions in the Egyptian language were thus written; some
time elapsed before hieroglyphins were adapted to the native lan-
guage, which was allied to the modern Nubian tongue. In the,
course of this adaptation various formal modifications took plate,
resulting in a Mero't'lic nieroytypbie System, which has not as yet
been fully deeiplwred. In the pcst-Ghristiau em .1 Mertiitie Cursive
Style also, probably based on the vlemotic, was developed (camp.
p. 386). This also has only partly been deuiphered.

The following hints will he of service to those who may try to
decipher any of the kings' names with the aid of the foregoing
lists. consulting first the list of phonetic symbols, then that of
the verbal signs. The Egyptian kings frequently had several
names, the two most important of which, vis. the ar'fieial name
and the indisidual name, are enclosed within the cartouche. The

iofiicial name is preceded by the title Li; n-shn Lily,'liing of
