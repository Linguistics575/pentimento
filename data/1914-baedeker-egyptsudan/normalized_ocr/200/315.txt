is built within the still partly preserved girdle-wall of the ancient
Roman citadel of Babylon [ pt 44). - To the right of the railway, at
the S E. angle of the citadel, stands the Coptic church El-Jforalla.ka
(Pl. C, 2;'resting upon columns'), the oldest in Babylon and re-
cently restored. Beyond a vestibule we enter a garden and a court,
whence a broad ilight of steps ascends to the church At the top
are an auteioom and an open court. Wis enter the double-aisied and
handsomely fitted up church through a colonnade. - Beyond the
angle, on the S. side of the citadel, is a massive Roman Gateway
with tho projecting towers, in which fragments of early-Egyptian
masonry have been used [ key from the porter of the Moralla.ka
church). - Just beyond the station the road leads past the Creek
Convent of St. George (Convent gree; P1.C,1,2), the circular domed
church of which rests on the foundations ofa Roman tower (a on
the Plan), to the Coptic church ot--

*Abu Sergei: (St. Sergio; Pl. C, 1, 2), enclosed by a dense mass
of houses. This Clyurisl1 is believed to have been built before the
Mohammedan oonquest, bat this can be true of the crypt only. Ao-
cording to tradition the Virgin and Child after their flight to Egypt
spent a month in this crypt. The church is now being restored.

This church, which has suffered at various times from alterations
am ] additions, now partly removed, may he regarded as the original
model ofthe older Egyptian-Byzaniine churches in which the Coptic
Christians now worship t. The basilica consists ofa have and aisles,

t thrptie Worship. On entering the church We members of the con-
gregation first pay their homage to a number of pictnxes of saints hanging
on the walls (the veneration orsaintsand orthe Virgin being a pxominent
feature of the Coptic system) and then kneel before the altar and kiss the
hand of the priest. They then take their stand (for there itre BI) seats) in the
part or the church allotted to them, the feeble leaning on crutches which
they bring for the purpose, as the service often lasts for more than three
hours The service begins with the reading "chanting of prayers and
passages from the Gospels, partly in the Coptic language and partly in
Arabic, in Which the priest is assistedhy a schoolmaster and a. choir of
boys. During this performance the worshippers, with very few exceptions,
engage freely in conversation. After a time the burning ofincensc begins.
The priest, swinging his eenser, leaves the heikal and jniiis the cou-
gregalion, each member of which he blesses, placing his hand on their
heads. - The Celebration "the Eucharist is Very frequent in the Coptic
churches, immediately following the Ordinary service. - On January 19th,
the anniversary of the Baptism of Christ ('td gHlittts), men and boys
plunge into the large font or bath Which is lo he found in most Coptic
ehurehes, the water having been tirstb1eped by the priest. Or they per-
form the same ceremnny in the Nile, into which they tlrstpoar some U0tl-
seerated water. On the eve of this festival, as well as at Epiphany, on
Iraumly Thursdhy, and on the festival of the Apostles, the priest washes
the feet of the Whole ofhis congregation - On Palm Sunday wreaths or
palm are blessed by the priest, which are then worn by the Capt: under
their .tirrinishes during the whole of the Following year as hmnlets against
every misfortune that can befall body or soul, - An external form to
which the Copts atteeh great weight is the observance offnsts and a Copt
who is negligent in this respect win rarely be met with. bi these oe-
eisimis tsll kinds of animal food, not excepting fat, eggs, butter, and
cheese, are prohibited. - Comp. Butler's ioptie Churches orEgypt'Ct881J.
