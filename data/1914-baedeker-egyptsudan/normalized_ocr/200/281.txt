Gemi' el-Hkkim (H, Fl, 2), begun in 090, on the plan of the,
Mosque of ihu Tuliin (p. 71), by Caliph El-'Aziz, and completed
by his son EI-Iiiikim in 1002-1012. It Was seriously damaged by the
earthquake 0f1303, but was restored soon afterwards by Beybars H.
Under the French it was used as a fort. It now lies in ruins, with
the exception of the sanctuary, which has a modern ceiling, The
two minarets, at either em ] ot' the W. wall, are noteworthy. l) rip-
inally round, they owe their present euhieai shape to a surrounding
wall, built at a later date. In the vase of the N. minaret, Which is
incorporated in the town-wall (see below), the finely carved marble
windows and the Fuimite inscriptions in its original lower portion
may still be ideuttiied. The dome-shaped tops, resembling Arabian
iru3etise-burners (mabkhara), date from the above-mentioned restor-
ation. The N. minaret commands a tine view.

At the end of the Shin" Bib el-Futt1b rises the Bah el-Fatrilt
tPl. E, 2), or'Gate of Conquests', which is connected by the ancient
eity-wall with the Bib en-Naer (P1. 15,2), or'Gate of Vietory',
165 yds. to the E. (reached by the Shirir el-Kassasin). These
two gates form the strong N.E. extremity of the old eity-forti-
iiiatious. Together with the mosque "Caliph Ijikim, situated
between them [ see above), they formed a strong position for the,
troops of Napoleon in 1700. These solidly built gates are, along
with the l,'ib Zuweileh (p. 60), the only survivors of the sixty
gates in the Fatimite walls of Cairo erected by the vizier Bad: ci-
Crauuili at the end of the ilth nentury. Their plan resembles
that of ancient Roman gateways, Each has an outer and an inner
gate, flanked by square or round towers and united by means "a
vaulted inner court.

The *Aseexr of thetowers and towmwall is highly recommended
(min 2 pias.). We tirst ascend the Bti, en-Na.sr, on which an old
gallows is still standing, then walk along the wall, the hattlemeuts
"which are partly preserved, to the Bah el-r'uttslr, beyond which
the wall is continued for some distance. The view ranges over the
city and, on the w., to the Tombs of the Oaliphs and the Gcbei el-
Alunar (p. 115). The return to the lialh an-Nagr should be made
through the casemates, the Jirrely jointed masonry of which includes
blocks (some inscribed) from v'arly-rlgyptian buildings.

In the Moslem cemetery outside ihc wo em-Barr is lraried Johann

We return from the, lit") Pl Nay by the SHAJLI'IEAH 1sw-rNstsu,

on, in the SIIRRL' cL-Gssr.tr, isunr fl'l. E, 2, 3), to the left, is the
Conventual Mosque ofSuthm lleybars 11, J306-9), with the domed
