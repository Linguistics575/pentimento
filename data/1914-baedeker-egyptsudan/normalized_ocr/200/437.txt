Information. UPP E R EGYPT, 201

An easier plan is as follows. Quitting Cairo by the night-express
we reach Bulimia (p. 2'21) next morning, and ride thence on
dorrlrey-trairk to Abydoa o. 237). Provisions for this expedition
must be brought from Cairo. We have snfiicietlt time to explore
the ruins at Ahydos before catching the evening-train for Luror
(p.251). At least four days should be devoted to an inspection
of the temples and tombs at Thebes. On leaving Luxor we may
either stop over a train at Ed/ls (p. 343; which, however, may be
just as well visited on the way back ] or proceed straight through
to Assudn (p. 353), where not less than two days should be spent.
If possible, one should devote a day to an excursion to K6rn Ombo
(p. 349). We leave Luxor on our return by the first morning-train
and break the journey at Ifmeh (v. 222), whence We ride to the
temple of Demicra (p. 944). Provisions musthe brought from Luxor
for this expedition. From Iieneh we go on to Giro by the north
express. We may visit Dendem also as a day's ewursion from Luxor
and take Abydus instead on the return-journey (comp. below).

A Town or Tums WEEss may be arranged somewhat as follows.
We proceed by railway to Luror and spend a week there, one day
of which may be devoted to an excursion to Dendera (by train to
Keneh and back). From Luxor we go on by steamer (2 days) or by
railway (1 day) to Assufn, where we spend 5 days, including one
day's excursion to Ktsm Ombo. We may then return by steamer to
Cairo, or we may take the steamer to Luxor, make another short
stay there, and go on by train in the morning to Baliana (visit to
the ruins of Abvdos) and take the evening-train thence to Cairo.

The railway may be atilized fur other excursions by travellers who
are to some extent familiar with the customs and language or the country.
The nights may be spent in the station warring-rooms (with permission
of the station-master) or at the houses nf the local heudmen ('Dmdeh).

Steamboat; The steamboat service to Upper Egypt is main-
tained by two companies: Messrs. Thomas Cook & San, the more im-
portant, and the Hamburg'ArWo-Arneriears Nile Co. - Passengers
by steamer who sleep with the eabin-wiadow cpen should take care
to have sunieient bedelothes; and it is well to remember (sr when
shaving) that the steamers sometimes run aground, especially above
Luxor. Delay through this last feet occasionally necessitates the
completion of the journey to Cairo by railway in order to make
connection with the ocean-Steamers.

The best boats of THOMAS Coo: & Soy are the'Ururist-steamers'
Arabia (80berths), Egypt (80 berths), Rameses the fireat (80 berths),
Rumeses (79 herths), and Rameses III. (70 berths), after which
rank the Amasis (44 berths) and the Tewflc (40 berths). One ot'
the above steamers starts once a week during the season, spending
20 days on the voyage to Assmin and hack. The fare is 521.; for
