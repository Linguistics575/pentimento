the truth, they eagerly welcomed the simpleductrines of Christianity,
which appeared so well udapted to their condition and promised
them succuur and redemption. Like Eutyches, they revered the
divine nature of the Saviour only, in which they held that every
human element was ahsurhetl; and when: the Council of Chalhedun
in 451 sauetiuned the doctrine that Christ combined a human with
a divine nature, the Egyptians with their characteristic tenacity
adhered to their old views, and formed a sect termed Eutychians, or
o1fonoplipites, to wldeh the Copts of the present Jay, and also the
Abyssiniaus, still belong.

The name ofthe Copts is an ethnicul one, being simply an Arabic cor-
mption of the Greek name of Egyptians. The theory is now exploded that
they derive their name from a certain ilinerantpreacher named .laeohus,
who according to Muhrizi was termed El-Berirdi'i, m-'hlsrrslret-beaver', from
the old horse-eloth Worn by him when he went about preaching. This
.lncohus promulgated the monophysite doctrine of Eutyehes, which had
found its most zealous supporter in Dioscurns, a bishop of Alexandria,
who was declared nherelic and banished after the Council of Chalcedon;
and his disciples were sumetimes called Jacohiles. If this name had ever
lieen abbreviated to Cubit 0r Cobt. it would probably have occurred
frequently in the writings hr Jluno0ysites-, but there we tlad no trace
at it. It is, on the other hand, quite intelligible that the word Capt,
though originally xyuunymuus' ivitll Egyptian, should gradually have come
to denote a partieaitu, religious seet; thr, at the period when the valley

Those Egyptian Christians strenuously opposed the resolutionsof
the Council of Chainedon, and thousands at them saeriticed their
lives ur their welfare in the iieree and sanguinary t30nflityts of the
(ith century, the causes at which were imperfectly understood by
the great majority of the beiligerents. The subtle dogmatic dif-
ferences whieh gave rise to these Wars aroused such hatred among
these professors of the religion of love, that the defeated Mouophy-

even invited them to their muntry.
