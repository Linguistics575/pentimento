crtielly in the reign ofPto1emyPhi1ar1elplltts, the lake-area was reduced by
means of mntrvvnkausnts, until its total size approximated to that of the
lunderu liirket FaNir1. Attempts were made to reclaim land for agricultural
purposes by mining the marshes; and the success thathas attended these
efforts is attested by the fertile fields and prosperousvillages that have oc-
cupied for twenty centuries the erstwhile site of Lake llmris. Strathn de-
mines the lake in the following terms:'Uwing to its size and depth Lake

by means of which the engineers can regulate the iullax and efilux ofthe
