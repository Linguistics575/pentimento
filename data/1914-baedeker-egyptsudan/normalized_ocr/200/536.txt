is the ALEXANDER R0011, built by Thatmosis m, and embellished with re-
licfs 11nd inscriptions by Alexander the Greett The reliefs show Alexander
(or occasionally Thutmasis) strcrirusingr. Farther m1 is ts Hara with 3 six-
teen-eided columns (7 still erect) and to the E. or it are rooms with pillars
in two stories; beyond that, forming the end of the temple on the S. side,
mus aCoxmnox, opening "o'd which are two small roams with pillars and
1eve11 other chambers with reliefs or Thntmasis Ill.

The central and E. portions of the Temple of Amon (mm
Pylon Ill onwards) were surrounded by a GIRDLE WALL, the ex-
tent remains of which are covered with reliefs of Ramses II. sacri-
fieing to the gods. On the E. side of this girdle-wall and to the E.
of the Festal Temple of Thutmosis IU. lies a second Sanctuary tr/
Thulmoais 111., which was probably dedicated to the cult of that
king and his sister Hatshepsut after their death. In the central
chapel (P1. a) are colossal seated figures at the royal pair; in front
of it, to the E., is a yillared hall, containing six gigantic statues
of the king, which were'usurped' by Ramses ll. - Farther to
the E., in the same mair1 axis, lie the scanty ruins of a Temple
of Ramses 11., which interrupts an old brick girdle-wall. Beyond
the entrarule-gateway, which is situated on the E. side, we enter
a court with eades formed of columns and of pillars embel-
lished with Osi -statuesi beyond that is a hypostyle hall. To the
E., in front of the portal, lay an arcade with 20 columns, of the time
of Taharka. To the N. of this are the remains of another Temple of
Ramses 11., which was restored in the reign of the Ptolemies and was
perhaps dedicated to the cult of King Mentuhotcp HI. (11th Dyu.);
to the s., to the E. of the Sacred Lake, are the remains of a Brick
Building dating from a period anterior to the Middle Empire.

Farther on is the well-preserved E. Gateway (now closed) of the
great brick girdle-wall which enclosed the whole area of the temple.
It was built by one of the Ptolemies and is 62 ft. in height. It
lies 510 yds. distant from the first pylon (p. 266.

Agiinst the irrne- wall stands a small Temple of Osiris (key with
N. Legrrtin 11.36:, erected by Osorkon 111., his son and co- regent Take-
Iothis IU., and his daughter Shepenupet. The 111st chamber was added
later by Amenertels, sister of Shahako (25th Dyn) and mother- ia-law of
Psamm'etiehos I. hear it are several small chapels of the same periml
(26th Dyn ]. - If We turn to the right W.) outside the gateway, we soon
reach a small building bearing the cartouches of Ramses m and RamsesIV.





c. THE Nommmx Hummus AT KARNAK.

0f the hnildings to the N. of the Temple of Amen the Temple of
Ptah alone is worth a visit; the others are in such bad preservation that
hurried travellers may emit a visit to them altogether..

From the N. side- door of the hypastyle hall an ancient paved
road leads N.E. to the Temple of Ptah, within the precincts of the
Temple of Amon, passing (left) a small brick fortress and three
small Chapels ofthe Late Period, all entered from the FD.
