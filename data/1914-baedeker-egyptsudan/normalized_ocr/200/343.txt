Construction. PYRAMIDS OF aizrorr. 6. Route. 125

With trgures engraved on ite Tea years were thus consumed in making
this rum } and the subterranean chambers [ fur the enmus). The eun-
struction of the Pyramid itscif uecupied twenty yeiu-s. Each of the
four sides measures eight plethrn (820 ft.), and the height is the same.
It is covered with smoothed stones, wen jointed, none or which is less
than thirty feet long. This pyramid wls lirst built in the form m" a
ttight of steps. After the workmen had completed the pyramid in this
form, they raised the ether stones (nsed for the iam: usution) by means
of machines, made or shut. beams, from the ground to the iirst tier of
steps; and nfter the stone was placed there it was raised to the second
tier hy another machine; for there were as many machines as there Were
tiers of steps; or perhaps there was bat one machine, easily moved, that
was raised from one tier to the other, as it was required fur lifting the
stones. The highest part of the pyramid was thus tinigl1ed rrrst tby
smoothing), the parts adjoining it "ere taken next, and the luwest part,
next to the ground, was completed last. It was recorded on the pyramid,
in Egyptian writing, how much was spent on radishes, onions, and roots
of garlic fur distribution among the workmen and, iil rightly remember
what the interpreter who read the writing told me H, the money they
cost amounted to sixteen hnndred (slents of silver (upwards of 550,000L).
If this was really the case, how much more must then have been spent
on the iron with Which they worked, and on the food and clothing of
the workmen.'

In modern times many eager discussions have been held as to
the mode in which the Pyramids were erected and the meaning of
the account given by Herodotus. The most important questions
seem to be: Cl) How could Kheops, when he ascended the throne
and chose an area of 82,000 sq, yards for his monument, know
that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to Bom-
plete it? L2) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had died
in the second or third year of his reign, how could their sons or
successors, however willing to carry out the plan, have succeeded in
completing so gigantic a task and in erecting monuments for them-
selves at the same time? (3) And how comee it that many other
kings did not, like Kheops, boldly anticipate a reign of thirty years
and begin a work of the same kind, the design for which might so
easily have been drawn, and might so readily have been carried
out by his subjects? - To these questions Lepsius, Erbksm, and
Fibers answer.'Eaeh king', says Lepsius in his letters from Egypt,
'began to build his pyramid when he ascended the throne. He began
it mi 3 small scale, in order that, if a short reign should be in store
for him, his tomh might he a complete one. As years rolled on,
however, he continued enlarging it by the addition of outer coatings
of stone, until he felt that his career was drawing to a close. If
he died before the work was completed the last coating was then
finished, and the size of the monument was accordingly proportioned
to the length of the builder's reign.' - This'iayer-theory' of the

' This causeway is still traceable, It terminated en the e side at
the Pyro id at Kheops (see Plan and p. 138).

"It is unlikely JM the interpreters, who attended travellersiike the
dragumeus of the present day, were able to read hieroglyphics. They
probably repeated mere popular traditions regarding the pyramids and
other monuments, with embellishments and exaggerations of their own.
