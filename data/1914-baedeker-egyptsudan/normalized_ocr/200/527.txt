tive broken shafts on the left side and one complete column (with
calyx-capital and abacus) on the right. This structure had a door on
each of its four sides; in front of theW. door is a recumbent sphins.

Upon the complete column, on the right, Psammetiuhne n. (26th Dru.)
has placed his name over that of the Ethiopian Taharka (25th pm); he-
side it is the name of Ptolemy IV. PlH1opator, which appears also on the
abacus. The shaft is composed of 25 courses oi'camfuily hewn stone, the

capital 16 IL, the circumference at the top M) it The columns were united
by means of stone screens, dating from the. reign at Pltilopator.

A door in the N. walk of the coinnnade surrnundiug the great cnurt
leads out of the temple, and from this point we may shirt the outer wall
to the left to the steps leading to the toll of the First Pylon (see p. 266).

To the right, facing the great court, is the'i'TBsrrrm OI" 1ta.w.
ses 11L, which was dedicated to Amen. It is perhaps the best ex-
tant specimen of a simple Egyptian temple, built throughout on a
single homogeneous plan. Its total length is 170 ft.

The Pylon with the entranee-door, which has two statues of the
king, is much injured, especially at the top. On the exterior of the
left tower (E.) Ramses 111., with the double crown, smites a band
of prisoners with his club. Amen, in front of him, hands him the
sword of victory and delivers to him chained together the repre-
sentatives of the vanquished peoples, who appear in three rows. In
the two upper rows are the conquered nations of the south, in the
third row those of the north. On the right wing are similar repre-
sentations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower Egypt. In the
doorway Ramses 111. receives from Amos the symbol of life, etc.

Beyond the pylon is an open Court, flanlrBd by covered passages.
The roofs of these yassages are each supported by eight pillars,
against which lean colossal figures of ltemses III. as Osiris.

On the rearwails ot" the pylon-towers, facing the court, arisrepresent-
ations of Ramses in. receiving from Amen the hieroglyphic for'jubilee',
as a sign that the king would yet cciebmte many jubilees. - The walls
Of the Colonnade: arc embellished with reliefs: in the E. arcade, the pro-
cession or the eacred boat at Amour in the w. made, a. procession with
the statue of the ithyphailic Anton, borne by priests and accompanied by
standard-bearers. - The arehitraves bear tliarid dedicatory inscriptions,
recording that Ramses m. erected this monument in honour of his father
Anion. - A door in the left colouuzde opens into the Portico "the
Buhastides (p.253); and (me in the right taolustnade mow built up) ad-
mitted to the S. coitmnade of the great tpoart.

The court is mijoined by the Vestibule or Prontros of the temple,
which latter is on a higher level. it is supported in front by four
Osi is-pillars, and in the rear by four columns with bud-capitals.
The pillars are united by stone screens adorned with reliefs.

From the vestibule a 1loor leads into a Ilypostyle Hull, with eight
columns with bud-capitals. Adjoining are three Chapels, dedicated
respectively to Amen (in the middle), Mut (left), and Klrons (right),
and each containing representations of the king sacrificing to the
boat of the respective god, Beside the chapel of lihons is another
chamber, and beside the chapel ofMut is .1 staircase, while beyond
the chapel of Amen, on each side, is a chamber.
