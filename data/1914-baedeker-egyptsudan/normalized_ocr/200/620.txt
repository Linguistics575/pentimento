left oi' the eutlanee are two small Chapetr One CPI, d) is the'Con-
> ecrati0n Chamber', as is indicated by the reliei'on the rear wall, Toe
presenting Horus (L) and Thont (1.) pouring consecrated water upon
the king. The chapel to the right (PI. e ] was the library; upon its
walls is a catalogue of the books preserved here. On the left wall
Seshet, goddess of literature, appears writing upon a palm-braneh.
k A side-door (PLf) in the E. wall of the hall admits to the inner
passage o. 347) round the temple. - Above the door in the N.
wall of the vestibule is a curious representation. Ptolemy Philo-
pator offers an image of the goddess of truth to the heat of the sun,
which appears Vuided by two iig11res of the falcon-headed Horus as
pilot and helmsman. In the boat the sun is adored by Thout (1.) and
Neith (L). In an attitude of worship, at the sides, are Four Senses: I
to the right sight and hearing, to the left taste and reason.

Next follows the Hypoet-yle Hall, the roof of which is borne
lry 12 columns with rich floral capitals. Apertures near the top of
the walls and in the ceiling admit iight to this hall. The represent-
ations on the walls resemble those of the preceding great vestibule.
Of the adjoining sHe-ebambers, two (Pl. XVIII and six) served as
accesses to the inner passage round the temple, one (Pl. xvu) was a
laboratory, while from another (PL xx the great R. staircase ied up
to the roof of the temple (comp. p. 3 7).

On each side of the adjoining 1hawvAxyrsmsxumm is an approach
to one of the Staircases leading to the temple-roof. The mural re-
liefs 0n the staircases resemble the corresponding reliefs at Den-
dera (p. 249). On that on the E. (P1. XVI) is a procession of priests
ascending, headed by the king; on that on the W. CPI, XIV) is the
same descending. The corridors and chambers on the roof contain
nothing ofinterest, those to the E. were probably intended for the
cnit of Osiris. - On the E, of the SECOND ANTECHAMBER we enter
a small Sacrificial Court, in which (to the N.) is an elegant little
Kinsque, with two columns with floral capitals supporting the roof.
Upon the ceiling is Nut, goddess of the sky, beneath whom appear
various forms of the sun in boats. _ To the left of the Second Au-
techamher is a small Room (P1. x1) dedicated to the god Min.

In the Sanctuary the most interesting Beliefs are those in the
lower row on the right (E.) wall. l. The king (Philopator) removes
the lock from the shrine ot'Horus. 2. He opens the door of the
shrine. 3. He stands in a reverential attitude, with pendent arms,
before the god. 4. He offers incense to his deified parents, Euergetesl.
and Berenice. b. He offers incense before the sacred boat ofHathor.
By the rear wall is a granite shrine (Pl. o, with a pointed roof,
dedicated to Horus by King Nekht-IIar-ehbet. This is a relic of
the original pre-Ptolernaio temp1e (p. Mi). In front of the shrine
is a pedestal of dark granite (found in another part of the temple),
intended to support the sacred Mat and indicated by an inscription
as the votive gift of a private citizen.
