Nubia continued to be a dependency of the Pharaohs until about
11001: .0, But when the power ongypt waned under the 21st Dyu.
(p, civ) Nubia, shook "her allegiance and a native ETHIOPIAN
MONARCHY was Established, with Napata as its capital (p. MO). But
the civilization of this kingdom continued to be Egyptian; and its
monarchs, who were dependent on the priests, regarded themselves
as the true protectors of the Egyptian religion and as the legitimate
rulers of Egypt. About 730 Bhl. the Ethiopian Piankhi (p. civ)
temporarily overrun all Egypt, and shortly afterwards an Ethiopian
dynasty (the25th; p. cv) establish" itself tirmly on the Egyptian
throne. But in little more than A century (about 663110. ] these
Flth'wpiarr Pharaohs were forced to give way before the Assyrians,
and their kingdom was restricted to Nubia, of which the N. border
then lay near Phila, (Konossa, p. 371).

The Egyptian "lization gradually declined in Nubia. The
Egyptian hieroglyphic writing became corrupted and a native Merel-
Lit; hieroglyphic and cursive character was developed (p. cxxxi),
which, about the beginning of the Christian era, began to be used
for writing the native Nubian language even in ot'iioia1 documentst
About (300 ILO. the royal residence was tra rred from Napata to
Arero'e' (p. 422), which lay farther to the S. Comparatively full
information has come down to us concerning the earlier kings who
dwelt at Meroé. We know also of the uusuccessful campaign of the
army otU'sarnrnetieho H. against Lower Nubia (about 590 ILC.) and
of the attempts of Cumbyses C525 Bl).) to conquer Ethiopia, which
were foiled mzliuly by the energeti Ethiopian King Nuslcsen.
After that an almost impenetrable veil falls over the history of the
country.

During the Promexc AND I'mMAN IMPERIAL Eeocns the S.
boundary of Egypt was near Hierasykarninos (p. 397), and it was
occasionally pushed farther S. as far as Primis o. 402), On the
other hand the Nubians sometimes succeeded in extending their
power as far N. as Philm, and perhaps even occupied part of Upper
Egypt. When the Romans first came to Egypt Ethiopia was gov-
erned by a succession of queens named Candace. One of these
attacked the lloiuan province, but was repulsed by the Roman gov-
ernor Petmnius in 23 Bi. The Ethiopian kingdom seems soon
afterwards to have fallen into disorder and to have split up into a
number of small principalities. About this time also the Blem-
myes, a nomadic race of the E. desert, who had previously ackrTow-
ledged the suzerainty of Ethiopia, assumed an aggressive attitude.
Not content with harassing the N. parts of Lower Nubia, they tar »
ried their deptedations also into the Roman territory in S. Egypt,
until tinaily the Romans gave way before them. Diocletian (about
300 Am.) withdrew from Nubia altogether, retiring within the
bounds of Egypt proper, to the N. of Phila. The Blemmyes, how-
ever, in alliance with the Nubians, continued their attacks on Upper
