brick wall. It is embellished with reliefs of Ptolemy (on the Iintel)
and Tiberius (on the jamhs).

The'AticesT or THE Puus is recommended. The winding staircase
hl'gine in the S.E. angle or the forecourt (see Plan, p. 385). Several unadnrned
and feebly lighted chambers are found within the toweps. The view
from the top commands the whale island and its surroundings.

We now pass through the central gateway, within which, to the
right, is a French inscription ('an 7 de la rifpubtique') commemorating
Napoleon's Egyptian campaign and the pursuit of the Mamelukes
by General Desaix in 1799.

The Forecourt, which we next enter, is bounded on the S, by
Pylon I and on the N. by Pylon II. On the E. and W. are oditices,
each with a colonnade on the side next the court.

On the W. (left) is the Bm'm HOUSE, dedicated to Jrathor-Isis
and to the memory of the birth of her son Horus (comp. p. 250).
It is reached also by a doorway in the W. tOWeI of Pylon I (see
p. 360); on the back of the pylon is a relief of four priests carrying
the boat of Isis, preceded by the king burning incense. The Birth
House is surrounded on all four sides by colonnades, the columns
of wh l have Mral capitals surmounted by sistrummapitals. The
columns on the W. side are uutinished. The walls, the columns, and
the stone screens between the columns are adorned with the con-
ventional reliefs and inscriptions, mostly dating from Euargetes Il.,
Ncos Dionysos, Augustus, and Tiberius. The reliefs in the last
chamber are ssspeciallyinteresting; Horus as a falcon in the marshes,
Isis suckling Horus in the marshes "the Delta, and other scenes
from the childhood of the god.

The EAST annme, opposite the Birth llouse, was occupied by
the priests, partly for seieutihe, purposes. The eolunnade of plant
columns is very elegant. The reliefs and inscriptions date from Neos
Dionysus, the votive inscription on the arehitrave from EuergrstesH.
At the N. end of the eolmmede is a Door (Pl. o, approached by
several steps, opening upon the inner passage round the temple.
The reliefs upon this show Neos Dionysus before the gods.

The Second Pylon is 105 ft. broad and M) ft. high. The Portal
between the towers was embellished by Euergetes II. with reliefs
of the usual type. The large relief on the right tower represents the
Pharaoh Neos Dionysus dedicating the slaughtered sacrifleiar animals
to Horus and Hethox. Above are two small reliefs: on the right, Neos
Dionyscs presenting a Wreath to Horus and Nophthys; on the left,
Neos Dionysus offering incense and pouring water upon an altar, in
presence of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. The granite efthe site at the foot
of the tower has been smoothed to form a stale, with a six-lined in-
scription and reliefs relating to a grant of lands made to the temple
of Isis by Phi1ometer in the 24th year of his reign (167110.). la
front of it are the foundations of a small Chapel (Pl. m). _ On the
left tower are similar scenes (tigures deliberately defaced). On
both towers are grooves for the Mg-stairs.
