inches, and are called ibrhni, or sulcMti, as they come from N. Nubia.
The most delicately Mvoured are the dark-brown dates from Alexan-
dria, known as otrhit, which are eaten fresh. The value of the
dates exported annually amounts to about one million francs only,
as they realize too high a price in the country itself to remuneratc
the exporter. - The drim-paltn (Hypluzma Thebuica) occurs prin-
cipally in Upper Egypt and Nubia. It may be seen on the Nile above
Baliana (comp. p. 244). It is a broad~lcafed palm ofmcdium height,
and its timber and hast are of considerable value. Various objects
are made out ofthe hard kernel of the frtiit, whilethe soft and fibrous
rind is edible and has a sweetish taste, not unlike that of ginger-
bread. _ The mango-tree (Mangifera Indica ] has recently been in-
troduced into the Delta for the sake of its fruit.

The vine thrives admirably in Egypt, and grapes ('inab) abound
from July to September. Wine was extensively made from them
in ancient times, and this might still easily be Jone, were it not
that Egypt is already amply supplied with cheap and excellent
wines from every part of the Mediterranean. The Vine blossoms in
March and April, like the palm, and the grapes ripen in June and
July. Oranges tburtulciis0 are abundant and cheap (the harvest he-
ginning in September), and so also are mandarins ('Nsts/' Etrendi't
and small lemons (tannin; the small and Juicy fruit of the Citrus
limonium); citrons and cetiros are of less frequent occurrence.
Among other fruit-trees we may mention also the pomegranate
(rummrin), whieh yields a handsome return. The romuuou European
fruits likewise abound, but their flavour is generally very inferior.
Figs (tin) are very common in summer, but eapriiieation is not
practised in Egypt.

The principal DECORATIVE PLANTS are roses (ward; of which
the Rosa Damasccne moschata and Iloea sempervirens are specially
cultivated for the manufacture of attar of roses), oleanders of aston-
ishing height, Carnations, and geraniums, all of which have been
grown in Egypt from a very early period. A bushy tree, which in
its baK-lealless condition attracts the attention of every traveller on
landing at Alexandria in winter, is the Poinsettia (Euphorbia
puicherrima). The insignitieant blossom is surrounded by leaves
of the most brilliant red, presenting a very picturesque and strik-
ing appearance. Natural forests, or oven solitary wild trees, are
never met with in the valley orthis Nile or in the valleys of the "or-
them deserts.
