Arabian Cafes (sing. (cahwa) are frequented by the lower classes
almost exclusively. The front consists of woodwork with a few open
ttrehest Outside the door generally runs a magma, or raised seat
of stone or brick, covered with mats, and there are similar seats
in the interior. Coffee is served by the (cahtvdgt at W-l pias. per cup
(fngttU, and several nargileh or sluishch and gazeh (water-pipes)
are kept in readiness for the use of customers. The tumbdk (Per-
sian tobacco) smoked in the g6zeh is sometimes mixed with the
intoxicating Zmahfsh (hemp, Cannabis ludica), which has an un-
mistuhuhle smell. The importation and sale of hashish am 1mrlu-
bited in Egypt; it is therefore smuggled in in the most artful ways',

Story Tellers [ who in private domestic circles are generally
women) are still a characteristic oriental institution. Wherever
they make their appearance, whether in the public streets or the
'soften-horse, in the densely peopied alleys of the large towns or in
the smallest eootry-villages, they are sure to attract an attentive,
eusilypieased, nud srvuredinglygrateful erowxi. Themoreseusationai
the tale, the better, and the aftener is the narrator applauded with
protracted cries of'Aish', or'All'ib', or'Allihu akharl'. -htost
of the story-teiiers belong to the so-called 8lWara (sing. Shd'ir),
literally'siwpms'. They are known also as'Ana'tireh (sing.'Antari)
oi Abu Zeidiyeh, according as their theme consists of tales and
romances from the history of'Antar, a Betluiu hero, or from that of
Abu Zeid. Others again are called Jlil/addihiti, i.e. uanators of
history, their province being the recital in prose of passages from
the history of Sultan lieyhars (p. cxvii) and other historical heroes.
The entertainments of the alf teiteh u leileh [ thousand and one
nights) are, however, no longer heard, as popular superstition has
branded this eollectiou of tales as'uulucky' The themes of the
"hole fraternity are too often of an immoral character.

Musicians by profession, called Atatyeh (sing. Al√©ti), ate in.,
dispensable on every festive occasion. The usual instruments are
the or tambourine with little bells, the nakklinh or semi-
spherical tambourine, the zemr oi hauthois, the' tabl beledi or
drum, the .tabl shami or kettle- drum, and the dardbtikeh, a kind
of funnel-shaped drum (generally made of earthenware, but some-
times of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell, with
a tish-skin stretched over the broad end), which last is accompanied
by the zummdra, a kind of double tlute. A better class of instru-
ments, used for chamber music, includes the nti, a kind of flute, the
kemengeh or two-stringed violin, the body of which consists ofa cocoa
nut shell, the reirtibels, or one-striuged violin with a square wooden
body, the J.aim2n, a kind of zither with strings of sheep-gut, and
astly the'ud, theluteor mandoline, the oldestofall theinstruments.
