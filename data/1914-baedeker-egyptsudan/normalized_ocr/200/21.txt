COINAGE (comp. the illustrations on p. xvi and the tables before
the title-page and at the end ofthe book). The Egyptian Pound ('Livre
Egyptienne'; s E) is worth 20s. 61/4d., and is divided into 1000 Wrt-
tremes or 100 I'imtres. The Arabic name for the pinstre is Kink (pi.
Ntsrish; pronounced in Cairo'irsh,'urOh), but the European name
is everywhere current. Travellers should note the distinction that
is still frequently made between the'great piastre' { lcirsh ga'zgh), worth
10 milWerues, and the'little (or halo piastre' (ltirxlt lu'rifzt). worth
c, milliéuies. - Egyptian gold coins are seldom met with, their place
being taken by the British sovereign (Gimih ingllm': 97 pias. c, mill.)
and the French napoleon (20 fr.; Bintu .--- 77 pias. 2mill., bat reg-
ularly reckoned M 77 pin), both of which are legally current. and
by the banknotes of the National Bank of Egypt (for M) pias., £ E I,
J) E 5, £17.10, £11.50, and S. E 100). At Alexandria and Suez, and
a few other points, reckoning also in francs is still common. Where
British irttluenery is strong, and especially in Cairo, the word Shilling
is used for the thb' lfiyi'll, which is equivalent to about ls. I/ed. Copper
coins (comp. p. ii ] are met with only in dealings with the natives.
All the Egyptian veins are minted at Birmingham.

A liberal supply at small change is more essential in the East than
anywhere um (comp. pp. xxiv, 37). When obtaining change, travellers
should he on their guard against counterfeit 0r depreciated (i.e, worn or
perfnntted) pieces, which are cmmnun enough.

l'Assrom's am not absolutely necessary; and one's visitiug-canl
practically serves all its functions in the interior. Bankers, however,
frequently rorluire strangt-rs to cstablish their identity by some such
document; and the uountellaut'e and help of consuls also must
depend upon tho. prnorof nationality offered to them by the traveller.
- Travellers who intantl to proceed to Turkey must be provided
either with il passport visd by a Turkish consul at home or with a
teskerels (travelling permit) to be obtained through a consul.

Passports may he obtained in Grrm Britain direct from the Passport De-
partment of the Foreign 0ffico (fee 2sO 01' through any ofthe usual tunrist-

housr' examination at the port of entry. The objects ohiM1y sought
for are tnhacco and cigars, on which a somewhat high tax is levier1
