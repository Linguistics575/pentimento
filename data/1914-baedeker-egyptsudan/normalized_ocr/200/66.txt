wise the European dress is supersediug the oriental, though the
latter is far more picturesque and better suited to the climate. On
the whole, however, they are bigoted Mohammedan, and share
the contempt with which the fellahin regard all other religions.
Their daily intercourse with unbelieVers and their dreadi (oCrtlse
power of the Christian nations tend, however, to keep their tana-
tieism, which otherwise would be unbounded, in check, and has even
induced them sometimes to admit strangers to witness the sacred
ceremonies in their mosques.

"NUEIANE. The name Bardbru (sing. Bcrbcri) is applied to
the Nubian inhabitants of the Nile valley between the neighbour-
hood ofAssuz'tn and the Fourth Cataract. TbeEgyptians and Nubians
are radically different, and the dislike between the two races is
carried to such an extent that Nubians, even in Egypt, never marry
Kgyptian wives. The Nubians are inferior to the Egyptians in
industry and energy, especially in tilling the soil, and in physical
(and perhaps also in intellectual) vigour; and they are more super-
stitious as is indicated by the numerous amulets they wear round
their necks and arms They are, however, superior to the ligyptians
in cleanliness, honesty, and subordination, and possess a more highly
developed sense of honour. The traveller must not expect to tiud
them very sincerely attached or grateful, any more than the native
Egyptians, but "servants they axe certainly preferable. The Nubian
language belongs to a special group of the African tnugues; and
Dr. Brugsch was of opinion that it may afford l clue to the inter-
pretation of the still undeeiplsered Mero'iticinscriptions "the Nubian
part of the Nile valley. It is divided into three dialce i'. l. Kemhs,

Those Nubiaus who Jo not learn Arabic grammatically never speak
it thoroughly well; but itisgenerally, though iinperfoet1y, understood
in Nubia. The traveller must thereforenot expecttolearn goodAralrie
from his Nubian servants, In their native country the Nubians till
the banks of the Nile, but their land is of very limited extent and
poorly cultivated; and "their harvests are scantythey are rarely able
to support large families. They accordingly often emigrate at an early
age to the richer lauds ongypt, chieily to the large towns, in quest of
employment. When the Nubian has succeeded in amassing a mod-
erate fortune, be returns to settle in his native country, of "hich
throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight. They are
most commonly employed as doorkeepers (bauu-ab), as l1ouse-ser7auts
(lchadd0mJ, as grooms and runners (sdis), for which their swiftness
