340 Route 21. 911.311. } 311. From Luxor

The route goes on to the S. from the Rank Chapel, sometimes
skirting the rivor-bsnk, sometimes leading through the ancient
quarries, which were probably exhausted during the Roman period.
It passes a number of rorsk-inseriptions and chapel-like recesses
(eenotaphs).

We tirsr reach a rock facing the river, with three Jlemar'ial Inscriptions
upon it: to the left, lthmsesll ]. before Amen, Nat, and Khnns; in the
middle, Shoshenk I. (Erector of the tablet) conducted by the goddess Nut
before Amen, Mitrakhte, and Ptah, while behind the king is his son,
Yewpet, high-priest of Amon-PN, and generul-In-ehief; m the right,
Ilamses TN., wnrshipping Amon, Mat, Khons, tusd Sohek.

Further on is .1 Uenulltph Recess With a painted ceiling, 0n the left
dnnrrjamh of which is the praying figure at Thutmusis, scribe of the
treasure-l10use. Another Recess, with a ceiling iinely painted with spiral
patterns etc., has the cilrtanl'hxx or Thutmosis Ill. and of Hatshepsut
(destroyed) on the liutel.

Farther m the s, close to the river, are. three Cenotaph Recesses side by
side. The northernmost Of these lvclongcd II) Sekht-Min, royal scribe and
overseer rd the pvauaries of Upper and Lower P_ypl; Ott the left wall is
a ilne relief showin-I the deeeastyt nntl it companion at table; 0n the rear
wall are three seated firguces. - Another Tomb 1mm, belonging to Amen-
ambit, priest nf Auron, has fine reliefs and welhprvservcd colouring;
in the rear wall appear: Ihe deceased, In whom attendants hring0md and
tlrink, and on the side-wall; are the deceased and his wife Mimi, etc.

After skirting the bushy riser-bank for atrouti/shr.we reach the
Sour" Mos t ENTs, offering a picturesque appearance as seen from
the Nile. The chief of th _ are two Raceway trenotaphs) about (3 ft.
deep, which lie rlnse beside each other. The architraves over the
entrances are adorned with concave eontim-s and Uramrserpents
and are borne hy clustered columns. That to the N. (right) was con-
structed by Amenephthes (Merenptah), in the first year afhis reign;
it represents the king sacrificing to Ilarakhte, Ptah, and the Nile-
god (on the right), and to Amen, Mitt, and Khons (on the left).
Beneath is a Ion: hymn to the Nile and lists ofofferings to be made
to the river-god. On each of the narrow side-walls are injured
reliefs of the king saeritleing to the gods. - The scenes in the s.
recess are repetitions ofthese, except that Amenephthes is replaced
by Ramses IL, who constructed the reress in the first year of his
reign.--( ht the rock between these rere < ses is a tloor-shaped Stale,
on which King Amenephtlws is shown presenting a fisr, uriy of the
goddess of truth to Amon; the king is followed by a prince and by
the vizier Penehsi, who erected this stale to his master. - Farther
to the S. is another Stale, on which Amenephthes saeriiires to Amon,
while behind him is Roi, high-priest of Amen, who dedicated this
monument.

On a curious isolated sandstone rock, to the right, is a Stelt of
the 6th year of llamses HL, showing the king sacrificing to Amen,
Harakhte, and the god of' the Nile. 0n the same rock, to the left,
appears a priest Havering the names of Sethos J. - Farther to the s.,
and at a lower level than those steles, is another and much ruined
recess, dating from the reign of Sethos I. On the river-bank are
traces of an ancient tlight of steps descending to the stream.
