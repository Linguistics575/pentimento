and bounded on either hamlhyhills. We hold somewhat to the right
and soon reach a road, "hich tirrally passes through a rocky ravine
near the Giyftshi eminence, the view from which (p, H6) forms an
admirable close to the day's excursion. Thence to the city, see p. 116.

The following SHORTEJI Hur may be recommended. We ride as
described at pp. IIT, 118 direct to the Little Petrified Forest and then
return to the Spring of Mosest Hence we ascend to the W. to the plateau
of the Mohegan; and ride across it toward the W. to the HiyC1sbi mosque
(p. ttio. From the mosque we descend to the citadel.

A visit to the Gun Penman Foxesw nem- 1lir el-Fahm (l hrs.
to the E. of Cairo and 21/s hrs. beyond the Little Petriiied Forest) takes
a whole day, and is fatiguing, especially as the traveller bus the sun in
his race both in going and returning. The route mentioned on p. 117 is
not recommended for the outward journey, as the point for which we
are bound, not being crmspicaous, is liable to be missed. It is better to
leave Cairo by the Bab zl-Km'zilet (PLEJ; p. 68), pass the Tombs of the
Jlaaselukes (p. 1 l5) and the g'oudi-vauway to tlelw? ur, and, leaving the village
at m-Bastitin an the right, ascend to the left'hy the Jewish Cemetery. After
reaching the top of the him we follow the midi et-Pit fp. 118) towards
the E. for 11/.41/2 hr. more. Above the gradual slopes of the desert,
about 1% N, to the left, we then perceive several reddish bills and
another of yellowish colour in front. hiding towards the latter we reach
(In its E. slopes the d√©bris of the Bir el-rehm ('wal well') and remains
of some walls, dating from the period (1SJO) w1\en an unsuccessful search
for coal was made here. The hills of the desert tothe N. Irnv, and
W. of the Bir el-Falun form the Great Petrified Forest, anti are thickly
strewn with trunks and fragments of fossil timber. These are generally
brown and black, ith a polished appearance and frequently contain chal-
cedonyt A sand-hill, 1/; hr. to the N. of Bir el-Fahm, to the base of
which the petrified Forest extends, Mioriis a good sm-vey of the district.
