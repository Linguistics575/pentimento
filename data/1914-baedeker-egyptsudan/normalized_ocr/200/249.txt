the place Er-ritshira. Its N. and its S. limits are to-day marked by

In 973 Mu'izz took up his permanent residence in the new city of
Cairo. A new period of prosperity began under the Aiyubides.
Saladin endeavoured to unite the still separated cities of Cairo and
Fustit by means of a comman wall, which, however, was never
flirislued, and in 1179 he founded the citadel. Under his luxurious
and extravagant successors Cairo was greatly extended and mag-
niiiirently embellished, and in the 14th cent. it reached its Tenith.
At that period, however, it was fearfully devastated by the plague,
as it had been on former accasions (Lg. in 1065 and in 1295 ] and
was also several times subsequently (especially in 1402, when
about 12,000 people are said to have been carried off by it in one
day). The town suffered severely in other ways also, and indeed its
whole history, so far as recorded, like that of the sultans and the
Marnelukes themselves, seems to hare presented an almost Coit-
tinuous succession of revolutions, rapine, and bloodshed. As most
of the Mameluke Sultans who resided in the citadel died a violent
Math, so the reign of almost every new potentate began with bitter
and sanguinary contests among the emits for the oftiee of vizier,
while but few reigns were undisturbed by ittsrtrreetior1s in the
capital. During the third regime of Eh-N1sir (1293-1340), who had
been twice deposed and as often recovered his throne, a persecution
of the Christians took place at Cairo. The churches which had been
built in the capital and elsewhere were closed or demolished,
while the Christians themselves were so ill-treated and oppressed,
especially in the reign ofSultun Sililt Ci351-50, that many "them
are said to have embraced Islamism. 1111306 and 1307, in the reign
of Sultan 8lufbts, sanguinary e0aflicts took place in the streets of
Cairo between hostile parties of Mamelukes, and in 1377 8harbin
himself was tortured and strangled in the citadel. Even greater
disorders attended the dethrouement ofSultrm Barlnllt (1339), when
the wildest anarchy prevailed at Cairo, the convicts escaped from
their prisons, and in concert with the populace plundered the houses
of the emirs and the public magazines. The following year another
rebellion among the Mamelukes restored Jlarlrfrlr to the thranv.
Scarcely, however, had he closed his eyes and been succeeded by
l'arag (1399), when the Mamelukes again xevolted and renewed cou-
Mcts took place far possession of the citadel, during which the city
was partlypluudered. Similar scenes Were repeated on almost every
vhange at government. The turbulence of the Mainelukcs, who
were always treated with too much consideration by the Sultans,
became more and mute unbearable; they robbed the people in the
markets and assaulted citizens in the pyblie streets.

On Jan. 26th, 1517, the Osman sultan Selim 1., after having
gained a victory in the neighbourhood of Ileliopolis (p. 120), eu-
tered the city. Ttirniin Bey, the last Mameluke sultan, was taken
