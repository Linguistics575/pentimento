and Grand Hotels.

To the N. of Luxor extend the immense rains of Karnak (p. 262),
connected with it formerly by the lanes of the city, now by a broad
street planted with trees (PL Cl, D, 2, o. Even under the Pharaohs
the Temple of Amon, the chief god of Thebes, was considered the
most striking creation of an age peculiarly famous for architectural
achievements. To this day few ether buildings in the world can
match its dimensions. Farther to theN. is another extensive temple-
site at Medarntit (p. 281), which must be regarded as occupying the
site of a suburb of Thebes.

On the left (W.) bank o. 281) was the Necropolis, with vaults in
the rock and tombs on the desert-soii, adjoined by many temples
and dwelling-houses. Even in antiquity the Tombs of the Kings
(p. 284) were reckoned among the chief sights of ancient Thches.

The HISTORY of Thebes under the Ancient Empire is veiled in
uncertainty. The Egyptian name for the town was Wésel, or more
shortly Newt,'the city', whence the Scriptural name No or No-Amon
i'eity','city of Amun'). The W. bank was known as'the West of
Wgset' or'the West of the city'. No satisfactory explanation has
been offered of why the Greeks called it ThehesNiv3z0, a name
they frequently bestowed upon their own cities. Among the Greeks
the town was known also as Aw'ermhl;,'city of Zeus' (Amen),
also called Diospolis h? meyalE or Dioxpolis Magna to distinguish it
myrn Diospolis Parva or Him (p. 944). WEset was the capital of a
Home, and it was ruled by princes of its own, whose tombs (6th Dyn.)
were discovered at Drah Ahu'l Negga (p. 283). The local deity was
the falcon-headed Mont, a god of war, who Was worshipped also in
the neighbouring town of Ilerrnonthis. Several other places lay near
Wéset on the E. hank; among these were Eyec-Esowet (the modern
Karnak) and South Ape! (Luxor), which were afterwards incorporated
with the great'eity' and subjected to the same governnrs.

When Thehan princes assumed the royal dignity during the
Middle Empire Thebes rose to a more commanding position. The
city was adomed with temples, amongst which the large shrines
raised in Epet-Esotvet and South Apet to the god Amen Were con-
spicuous. But the greatness of Thebes dates only from the begin-
ning of the New Empire. The liberation of the country from the
Hyksos and the reunion of the empire was directed from Thebes,
and that city continued for centuries to be the favourite seat of the
Pharaohs, and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures
exacted as tribute or brought as booty from conquered nations. A
large share of this wealth was bestowed upon Anion. The mag-
nitieent and gigantic temples erected at this period to the god are
still among the chief sights of Thebes. The grandees ofthe kingdom
esteemed it an honour to become priests of Amen, the schools be-
