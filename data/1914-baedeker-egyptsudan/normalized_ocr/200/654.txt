(5-9 M. apart and serve also as measures of distance. Here and there
we observe some of the semaphore-towe" of an optical telegraph
dating from the time of Muhammad Ali. The Igoseir caravans

palms, a few mud-huts, and a half-ruinedAraty caravanserai. Nearthe
chief well are some fragments of a Creek inscription containing the
name of Tiberius Claudius. The manners and customs of the primitive
desert-trihes in this region well repay observation; the way in which
the children wear their hair is especially notable.

About 21/21115. to the E. ofLa.keit.a we quit the plain and enter a
whli, flanked by abrupt terraces belonging to the upper eretaceaus
formation and containing petrified oystet-shells. In 3/4 hr. more we
reach the r el- Bani! or'Castle of the Maidens',: t picturesque
rock of sarriis one formed by atmospheric erosion and covered with
numerous grafiltii 111 Greek Coptic, Arabic, Himyar'1t'w, and Simutie
characters," engraved here by caravans. Adjacent lies a Roman water-
'1irg-statron (ffydrettrnaj, forming an oblong 125 ft. in length and
i02ft. in breadth. The e11closh1gwall, fotmed of courses of sandstone
without cement, was 61/2 ft. high. Within the wall lie 20 small
chambers opening 011 a rectangular inner court, the only exit from
which is on the N. side. No water is now procurahle here.

At a distance of about 2hrs. from Hydreuma the rocks close in
and form a winding pass named Mugml; es-Set/im. On the Gebel Abu
"('father of the elbow'), at the entrance to the pass, are more
grafilti, older than those at Kagr el-Bawit; in one of them Amen-
ophis 1V. is mentioned. Beyond the pass we approach the tine
mountain scenery through which the second part of the Kogeir route
leads. In the distance, to the right, rise the S. foothills of the f.hrm-
"uhniit MU., while nearer and in front are the S.W. spurs. These,
mountains rise in terraces to the height at d200ft. and outvie in
impressive scenery the rocks of Assutu1. The outliers of the range
consist of a yellow sandstone, belonging io the Cretaceous form-
ation, followed by the red'Nubian' sandstone, also of the crate-
ceous system.

Among these hills, to the N. of the earavan-routis,1ies a second

changes; the hard, dark racks riseperpetuli0ularly and the mountains
assume an abrupt, Alpine appearance. Here begins the Wadi

hard dark stone for statues and i30ffins in the most ancient times.
