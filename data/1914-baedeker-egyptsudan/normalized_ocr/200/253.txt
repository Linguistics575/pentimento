Slrul Scenes,

CAIRO. J. Route. 49

Several times during the day and also at night the solemn uml
sunorous cry of the muezzin, summoning tho l'aithl'ul to prayer (sou

ll. lxxxvii), reverberates
from the tops ofthe minarats
(mddna). When the shops
are shut the watchmen

streets outside the entrances

ceases in the Arab quarters
comparatively early, while
in the European districts it
goes on till nearly mid-

month of Ramadan it cou-
tiuues throughout the
whole night even in the
Arab quarters; the story-



tellers (p. xxvi) in the cafes thvu have many listeners, while
shadow-plays (p. xwii) and bread throes attract others.

of which there are 193 in
Cairo, with 363 teachers
and 11,925 scholars, and

pils with the aid of ad-
monitions and blows, while
the boys themselves recite
verses of the Koran with a
swaying motion of their
bodies (a practice supposed
to'strengthen the memory')
or bend over their wooden
or metal writing tablets.
They do not fail, however,
to tind time for the same
tricks as liuropeau school-
