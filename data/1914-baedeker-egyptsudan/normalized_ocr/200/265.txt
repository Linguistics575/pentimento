Fatimite period, theBib el-Futrils and the Bib en-Na.sr (p. 77). It was
erected at the end of the 11th cent. by Week builders from Edessa.
The S. Mile consists of two huge towers, surmounted by the elegant
minaret: of the Muaiyad Mosque. On the tower to the W. are a
number of stone and wooden balls, probably dating from the Mame-
luke period. Thnin Bey, the last of the Circassian Sultans ongypt,
was hanged on this tower by Sultan Selim 1., on April 15th, 1517
(p. 45). This gate is called also Rab el-Metu'ulli, from the old
tradition that the most highly revered saint lfuth el-Metwalli
(Hutawalii) has his abode behind the W. half efthe gate, where he
sometimes makes his Presence known by a gleam of light. Onboth
wings of the gate hang shreds of clothing, teeth, and other votive
offerings, placed here by suilesers in hope of cure. Opposite the
outside of the gate is the sebil of Sultan Fang, by the large grated
window of which executions by strangulation took place down to
the middle of the 19th century.

From the aneileh Gate the DER }! sL-Agmex Pl. E, 4) leads
tow 1rds the K. About 200 yds. from the gate is (No.,' 6) the restored
*Mosque of the Emir Kijmes eI- Ishaki. a small hut handsome
building, erected in M81 in the style of ipm Bey. The mausoleum
which is large in proportion to the mosque, long re ined empty,

and was buried in Syria. In 1851, however, the pious Sheikh Ahn

In the same street, farther on named Sairurrvv-TArusiNmr (Pi. k,
4, 5), lies the *rardini Mosque (( himi' et-Mdrdtni), one of the
largest in Cairo, built in 1338-40 by Emir Altuu Bogha el-1nsdirli,
cnp-bearer of Sultan Mohammed en-b% .sir. The building was in a
thoroughly ruinous condition in the 19th cent, buthasrecently been
restored by Herz-Pasha. _ The nearly square court is surrounded
by rr0lor1nades. The prayer-niche and the walls on each side of it are
covered with costly mosaics. The new concrete dome in front of the
prayer-niche is borne by superb ancient Egyptian granite columns.
The side-coimmades also contain some ancient columns, probably
from a temple of the period of the Ptolemies. The sanctuary, or
main hall, is separated from the court by an ancient wooden railing,
much of which has had to be renewed. The 1Janeiiyeh in the court
formerly stood in the mosque of Sultan Iiasan and here occupies
the site of the original fountain. _ The Smhur BX); EL-WEZiR goes
on to the gate of that name and to the Citadet (p. 68). About lutlt'-
way it passes the picturesque C.Urr' Mfsuss.cost or (hhair IbrOtrn
Ayha (P1. E, 5), known also as El-Axralt, or'the blue', from the rich
blue tiles on the walls. Built in 1346 by the Emir Aksunhor,
this mosque was restored in 1651 by Ibrilrim Agha and again in
modern times.
