side his temples tlonrishsd, and the kings offered their richest gifts
to this god. The fame of the huge city early reached the ears
even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated passage of the Iliad
(ix. 379-384), Achilles, enraged with Agamemnon. assures Ulysses
that he will never more unite in council or in deed with the great
Atridas: -

"Ten times as much. and twenty times were vain; the high pil'd store

or rich Nyeenar, and if he ransack wide earth for more,

Search old Orchomeuus { or gold, and by the fertile stream

Where, in gyptian Thehcs, the heaps of precious ingots gleam,

The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state

or valiant men with steeds and ears march through each massy gate."

The epithet ix t√©pmuhog, tle.'hundredlgated', here used by

llomer, was applied also by later classical authors to Thebes. Diodoms,
Sttabo, Pliny, and stephanus of Byzantium all make use of it, refer-
ring to the gates of the town as symbols of its size aud power. The
persecution of the god Amen by Amenophis IV. (p. cii) and the
temporary transference of the royal residence to Tell el-'Amama
(p. 211) Mreeted Ihebes bat slightly. Its ruined temples were re-
built under Haremheh, Sethos I., and Ramses 11., and the wealth of
the god became greater than ever. An idea of the endowments of
the temple of Amen may be gleaned from the fact that under
Ramses Ill. more than 2/3 of the landed property possessed by the
temples of Egypt belonged to it, and that 3/4 ofthe gifts lavished by
Ramses m. upon the gods of Egypt fell to the share of Amen, so
that, for example, "113,433 slaves, no fewer than 86,486 were
presented to the Theban deity. Under these circumstances it was
natural that the aroh-priests of Amon should gradually grow to
regard themselves as the chiefpersons in the state; and they tirsally
succeeded in usurping the throne and in uniting { or a time the
royal title with the priestly ofiiee. But the sun of Thebes began
to set when the royal residence was transferred to the Delta under
the yrinees of the Met Dynasty. For a long time, however, Thebes,
with a large part of Upper Egypt, formed a distinct political entity,
governed by the high-priests of Amen and more or less indepen-
dent of the kings residing in the N. In the 7th cent. B.C. the armies
of the Assyrians penetmted as far as Thebes and plundered it;
the Ethiopians planted their rule here and honoured Amen with
buildings and inscriptions; the princes of the 26th Dyn. did for
Sais what the princes of the i8th and 19th Dyn. had done for the
city of Amen. The invading army of Camhyses ascended as far
as Upper Egypt, but seems to have done little or no damage at
Thebes. Nektauehes, one of the native Egyptian princes who main-
tained themselves against the Persians, added a gate to the temple
of Mont. Alexander the Great and the princes of the house of the
Lagidae probably found Thebes still a great though decadent city,
and they assisted to embellish it, as many buildings dating from
