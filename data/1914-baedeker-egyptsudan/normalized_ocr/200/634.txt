right is Men,'superintendent Ufworke', heron: the figure of Amenophis 111.;
to the left is Men's son Bet, chief architect at Tell el-" Amarna (p. 211),
hefore the O'garre (defaced) of Amenophis IV., upon which the sun's rays
descend.

0n the hill above the Cataract Hotel is Fort Tagug, whence a
beautiful View is enjoyed, especially towards evening. Visitors
should prolong their walk along the hilt, to the S., for the sake of
the views of the Nile valley, the islands, and the dam, and descend,
to the right, to the village of El-i1hr.Ea.tys (p. 363).

A ride (donkey or carr. there and back 5 pies.) may be taken to
the CAMP OF THE IhsirHis, situated within an Arab cemetery, 3/, M.
to the E. of the town. These Beduins with their families live in
wretched tents covered with mats. Beduius of the'Abibdeh tribe,
differing both in type and dress from the Bishérin, also have tents
here. Both tribes speak a curious language, allied to Egyptian and
other E. African dialects. They support themselves by tsattle-rtraring
and by trading, especially with Senna-leaves, which they collect in
the desert and sell "good prices. - A tine *View is commanded
by the Tomb of Sheilch JIartin, above the camp, to the right.

We may return via the ancient Ann Cmm'rnms, which are
situated in the desert to the S. of the railway. From the railway
station these may be reached vii the Shin" esh-Shellil. Each grave
was marked by a rectangle of unhewn stones and a slab bearing an
inscription. The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections.

0n the hills to the right or the road are some large mosqueJike
Cenotaph: of famous saints, such as the hheikh Nayuuid, the Sheikh'Ali,

the Lady (Saiyideh) Zeimtb, etc., whose memory is celebrated by Festivals
uu their birthdays (auilid), etc.

The Granite Quarries (Arab. MrVttrir), from which the ancient
Egyptian builders and sculptors drew their supplies (comp. p. 364),
are situated in the hills to the S., and may be reached in 1/4 hr. either
direct from the Bishérin camp or from the town by a route leading
via? the Arab cemeteries (see above) and then to the E., passing
a grove of tamarisks. Numerous blocks of granite lie where they
were left when the works were given up; 6.9. the huge block (marked
'Obelisk' on the Map) in the N. Quarry, measuring 92 ft. in length
and low, ft. in breadth at the broadest part. A moderately lofty
cliff shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient stone-
cuttersr The blocks were detached from the cliffs by boring nu-
merous holes along a prescribed line, driving wedges into these, and
then wetting the wedges. By this process tolerably smooth and
even fractures were obtained. Frequently the blocks were finished
on three sides before being iinally detached. Statues, sarcophagi,
obelisks, eta, were also roughly dressed by the stone-cutters in the
quarries in order to lessen the weight for transport. The hill above
the N. quarry commands a wide prospect, including the convent of
St. Simeon (p. 361) in a'1issert-valley, to the W., beyond the Nile.
A massive Causeway, by which the huge blocks were conveyed to
the Nile, mus from the quarries to Assufm and is used to this day.
