custom adopted by the kings of Egypt of wearing the urmus serpent
as a diadem or as an ornament in their crowns. - Another concep-
tion identified the sun with the sun-god RE, who, in the guise of an
Egyptian tfshermaa. sailed in a boat on the waters ofthe sky hy day,
and in the evening stepped into another boat and continued his voyage
through the underworld. As the sun-god r'i-Harakhte was a falean
the sun Was sometimes regarded as a brilliantlyplumaged falcon
soariugin theiirmament; or like Horus the sun was a powerful young
hero, waging a ceaseless combat with the hostile powers "darkness.
It was conceived of also under the form efe Scurubneus ox beetle
(p, clxxvii); the sun-god was represented in the form ofa Fear"
hams rolling the round disk of the SUT1 in front of him, in the same
way as a scarabmus rolls the small ball in which it has laid its egg.
The Egyptians of course did not believe that the world, the gods,
and human beings had always existed, but that they were created.
The most widespread belief was that Keb, the god of the earth, and
Nut the goddess of the sky, lav in clase nniau in Nun, the primeval
acean, until Show, the god of the air. separated them by raising Nut
aioft in his arms. The sun-god RE also was supposed to have arisen
from Nun; another view, however, made him the child of Rat) and
Nut, newhom every morning. These ideas of course conflict with the
other cenceptien that Re himself created the world (see p. csliv),
In the course "its history the religion of Egypt underwent
many transformations, The dominant position in the Egyptian pau-
thean shifted from one god to another, either through theological
speculation and the growth of legends, or through the naming into
prominence of royal houses and oi as that were devoted to the cult
of particular gods. In the primitive period two independent king-
doms were formed in Upper and Lower Egypt, and Seth, ot' Ombos,
and Hrsrus, of Buto, the local deities of the two capitals, were re, -
cognized as guardians of the two states. After the first union of the
two kingdoms had been operated from Lower Egypt, presumably
with Heliopolis as the capital, Horns became reeoguizerl as the sole
royal god, and henceforth remained the patron of the Pharaohs and
god of the empire. In the latest period of the prehistoric epoch Egypt
was again divided into the kingdoms, the capitals being El-kib (in
Upper Egypt) and I; utoi the patron deity of the former was the vul-
ture-goddess Nekhbeyet, of the latter the sisrpent- YotldeFSBulo. These
thus became the royal goddesses of Upper and Loner Fgypt. 1n the
same way at the end of the Ancient Empire I'lah, the local deity of
the capital Memphis, became the patron deity of the whole of Egypt.
An important niie in the religious history of Egypt has been played
by the city of Ox-Heuoroms (p. loo), which was probably the
religious centre of Lower Egypt in the earliest period, and in all
likelihood was for a time the capital of the united kingdom at'Egypt.
The Coronation ceremonies of the sovereign seem to have taken place
in the temple of this city, and here, too, according to legend, the
