ruins of the ancient Tapasiris Mayne, The remains of this town,
which lay on the plain, are very scantyi The EGYPTIAN TEMPLE,
however, situated on a limestone ridge rising from the s ashore, is
in good preservation as far as its enclosing walls are concerned. To
judge horn the Greek name of the place, it was probably dedicated
to Osiris. The sanctuary lay from E. to W. and was entered by a
handsome pylon, which, like the rest ot'the walls, is built ofhhieks
of limestone, In the interior of each of the two towers is an ancient
smiruay; from the top we enjoy a maguifieent *View of the blue,
sea, the desert, and the fertile lanxl in the distance. The pylon is
udjuined by the temple, which was surrounded by lofty walls and
had a length of 295 ft. The rooms in the interior are destroyed. _
A few minutes to the N. of the temple lie the ruins of a Tower,
probably alighthouse ot' the Roman period. The rocks in the neigh-
bourhood contain many quarries and Roman tombs, and near the
temple a bath has been excavated which deserves a Visit,
