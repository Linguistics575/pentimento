186 Route :2. 11111111: LAKES. Sues Canal.

A moderate any A journey Con camels ] to the N. E. of FI Kantam are
situated the ruin-5|rewn Tell Farama and Tellel Fadda, liccnpying the site
ur Peiusium, the celebrated eastern seaport and key to Egypt (comp.
p. cvi), which now contains no objects of interest.

The canal traverses Lake Buslt, now almost entirely drained.
At Et-F'erd0n (p. 179), at the S. end of the lake, the canal passes
rhrough the first cutting. At the next passing-place we obtain a
glimpse of the desert.

The hills ofEI-W1sr ('the embankment'), which cross the course
of the canal at an average height of 52 ft. above the sea-level,
presented the most serious obstacle to its construction. In order to
form a cutting through it about 18,800,000 cubic yds. ofearth had
to he removed. At the top of the hill is the deserted village of
F2-Gisr, with a chapel to the Virgin of the Desert and a ruined
mosque. A flight of steps ascends to this point from the canal,
The view hence embraces a great part of the Isthmus, the frowning
'Atilia Mts, (p. 181) above Suez, the mountains of the Peninsula
of Sinai, the course of the canal, and the green expanse of the
'dtter Lakes.

At the end of the cutting the canal enters Lake Timsah, or the
Croeodite Lake, the dredged channel through which is indicated by
stakes. As we enter the lake We see the khedivia ] chalet (see
p. 179) above us to the right, and to the s. the mountains of Gehcl
Ahn Bsiab. The lake, Which is now about 51/2511. M. in area and
of a beautiful pale-blue colour, was, before the construction of the
canal, a mere pond of brackish water, and full of reeds. On its N.
hank lies the town of 1saWtliyeh (p. 179 ].

After quitting Lake Timsah "0 pass (r., the foot of the Gebel
JIaryum which an Arabian legend points out as the place where
Miriam, when smitten with leprosy for her disapproval of the mar-
riage nt' Moses with an Ethiopian woman, spent seven days, beyond
the precincts of the camp of the Israelites (Numbers xii). - At
the 35th kilometre is situated (L) the small village of Tustin, which
is easily recognized by the whitewashed dome of the tomb of a
sheikh. Excavations near Tuson have led to the discovery of many
interesting fossil remains oflarge animals belonging to the miocehe
tertiary fomsatiou, and pieces of fossil wood also have been found
here (corn?. p. filo.- A little farther on (near the 90th kilo-
notre) is the cutting Which conducts the canal through the rocky
barrier of the Serapeum (comp. p. t82).

The canal now enters the Large Basin of the Bitter Lakes.
Brugseh identities the Bitter Lakes with the Marals of the Bible
Uhod. xv. 23). At each end of the large basin rises an iron light-
house, 05 ft. in height, The water is of a bluish-green colour. The
banks are flat and sandy, but a little to the S.W. (r.) rises the
not unpicturesqne range of the (label Genei/'ch (p. 18t). The hed
