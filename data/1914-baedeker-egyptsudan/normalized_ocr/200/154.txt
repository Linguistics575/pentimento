cxlviii VI. EGYPTIAN RELIGION.

to content themselves with simpler tombs, in whieh the necessaries
for the future life were buried with the bodies. But at a later period
even the ordinary citizens built'everlasting houses' for themselves,
at least so far as they possessed the means to do so.

The dead were undei the protection of the local deities, whose
duty it was to superintend the funeral ceremonies and afford Be-
curity in the tomb. There was also in many towns a special god of
the dead, named Kliente-rtmentiu,'the first of the inhabitants of the
Western kingdom' (ix. of the deb d), who was represented in the form
of a dog. At a later date these local gods retired in favour of Osiris.
He was gradually recognized as the ruler ofthe dead by all Egypt, and
dominion ovex the departed was assigned to him almost exclusively.
Abydos became the chief religious centre of his cult. The death
which, according to the legend (p.oxliii), Osiris suffered wasthe b0IM-
mon lot of mortals; hutjust as Osiris rose again, so a man also could
begin a new life, provided that the same formula were pronounced
for him by some faithful son; he went to Osiris, became united with
the slain god, in fact was himself Osiris. Admission to the realm of
Osiris depended upon the recitation of magical formulas and ineanta-
tions, a knowledge ofwhich must be communicated to the deceased.
A virtuous earthly life was required to assure the deceased eternal
happiness, and he had therefore to undergo a trial before Osiris and
to prove before k'?, judges that he was free from mortal sin. Before
this, and before his heart had been weighed by Thoutin the scales of
righteousness and found perfect, he might not enter the future land.

Opinions differed as to the abode of the blessed dead. Their
dwelling was usually located in the West, among the mountains,
and in the desert where the sun set. Some believed that they in-
habited the heavenly fields of Earn, a fruitful country where plough-
ing and reaping were carried on as upon earth, and where the corn
grew seven ells high, forming a veritable paradise for the Egyp-
tian peasant. As the labour in this future land might often be
too great for the strength of the deceased, it became the custom at
the period of the Middle Empire to place Ushebtis in the tomb along
with him. These little tip1res of men Were imbued with life by a
magic spell written upon them and assisted the deceased when
he was called to work beyond the tomb. Another doctrine sought
to unite the different conceptions of the future life and placed the
ahodes of the blessed in Twat, the underworld (see p. cxliv ]. This
was divided into twelve parts, corresponding to the twelve hours
of night, and, according to a certain view, separated from each other
by massive gates (comp. pp. 284 et seq.).

In flat contradiction to these doctrines Was the popular belief
that man possessed not only a body but also a soul (ba'i), which lived
after death. T s was originally conceived of as a bird; at a later
period as a bird with a human head. It was believed that the spirit
left the body at death and flew Freely about, but could return to the
