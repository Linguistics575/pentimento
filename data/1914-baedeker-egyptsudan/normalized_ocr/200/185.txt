The chief monuments of Arabian architecture in Egypt are the
religious ryliiiees (mosques), fountains, and tombs. The period
within which these were built extends from the accession of the
Tulurile Sultans to the conquest of Egypt by the Turks. The earlier
mosques have lctt hardly a trace hehindI and our knowledge of them
depends upon the obviously exaggerated and often confused de-
seriptions ot' the Ambic writers. The later mosques are of little
artistic value. Some of them display a union ot Turkish-Arabic
architectural forms with JJgyptian-Arabie ornamentation.

The only existing building dating from the TULUNIDB PERIOD
(868-905) is the Mosque of Ibn Tutrin (p. 71). The oldest plaster
decorations in this mosque display a system of ornamentation, the
various elements in which remain, as in the antique, separate and
distinct, though some of them are so unusual in form ms to defy
t0ssitioation under any known style.

In the FATIMITE PERIOD $ 694171) that followed, the eharaetee
istic intertuined geometrical patterns, with spaces tilled uphy Arabic
ornamentation showing a tendency to the Byzantine style, begin to
appear. Bricks ceased to be the exclusive building-USM/l and
hewn stone was used for portions of the editiecs, the mosque of El-
A (tmar (p. 76) showed the um example of a stone facade with
stalaetitcs. The portals began to be placed in recesses, and small
nnpelas made their appearance in the interior ot'the mosques. The
pointed arch of the mosque of Ibn Tum" gave place to the Persian
'keel' arch. Towards the close of this period ttmus began to be
adopted, especially in military architecture, that seem to have been
copied from the buildings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine.

The leading characteristic of the An'msnm PERIOD (1171-1250)
was the introduction of the ground-plan of the Persian medrcseh,
which superseded the previously used ground-plan of the courts
until the tlrst Mameluke period. Large domes began to be built
over the mausolea, which as founders' tombs were placed near the
sanctuaries ot' the mosques.

To the FIRST Bxr.uuTr: MAMELUKI; DYNASTY CI250-1382) we
owe a numberof huge editiees, with ground-plans in both the above-
mentioned styles and exhibiting, especially in the faeades, the in-
tluenre of the architecture of the Crusaders. Most of these struc-
tures date from the reigns of Beyhars and Ifalish1, the latter of whom
raised the first minaret of stone. Under En-Nitrir endeavours began
to be made to design iapades independent of foreign influence.
