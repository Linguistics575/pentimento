350 Routt23. K611 OMBO. From Edfu

*Great Temple of Sohek and Eareeris. This temple was built on
a uniform plan in the Ptolemaic period and embellished with re-
liefs by Philometor, Euergetes IE, and Neos Dionysus, The relief:
in the court end on the outer walls, however, were added under the
Roman emperors, more especially under Tiberius. The Ptolemaic
reliefs are easily distinguished from those of the emperors, as they
are in low relief while the latter are'en crenx'. In its general
arrangements the temple of Ombos resembles other temples of the
same period tat Dendera, Edfu, and Phila), but it timers from
them in being dedicated to two deities instead of to one only. Each
of these two deities had his own special worship and festivals, so
the entire building is bisected longitudinally by an imaginary line,
each half having its own gateways, doorways, and chapels. The S.
or right half was dedicated to Sobelt, the N. or left half to HaraE'ris.

The PuoN, at the entrance to the tatnpla-eor1rt, had two doors.
The left wing has completely vanished; while only the lower part
of the central pillar (between the doors) and of the right wing
remain.

On the outer side (facing the river) of the right wing arc the follow-
ing representations, from left to right: Pl. a. Snbek, Ilathm- and Khan; -
Har, the gods worshipped in the right half of the t'empte.'pirciiiirii,
glyphie text of 52 lines. Pl. c. Emp. Domitian, with the crown of Upper

Egypt, accompanied by u gods and goddesses, offering gifts to the above
mentioned deities.

At the corner to the right (above Pl. c) the upper row of risprenmtatlous
also has been preserved: six demi-gods (the lastthree, the'Sonls orHierat
koapolis', wilh ilnge' heads) carry the newly crowned king (defaced) to
his palace, on a portable throne; they are followed by the symbols

Clie') and ('happirsess'), hearing images of the gods on long poles;

finally a large figure of the king, preceded by a priest oMriag incense antl
followed by his guardian-spirit (with a king's head upon a Sceptre)

The COURT, as at Edfu, was surrounded on three sides by colon-
nades. Only the lower portions of the 16 columns are newleft.
The reliefs on these, the colouring of which" Is in places admirably
preserved, represent Tiberius saeritieing to the gods. On the inner
side of the right wing of the pylon are two doors, one of which
(Pl. d) admits to a small apartment, while the other (Pl. e) leads to
a staircase by which the roof of the pylon was gained. The square
base in the centre of the court was probably an altar; let into the
ground beside it are two small granite troughs. In this, as in all
the other rooms of the temple, the ancient pavement is in excellent
preservation. The rear of the court is separated from the adjoining
pronaos by stone screens, which are pierced by two large portals
and two smaller doorways. On the screen to the right (PLf) is a
relief of the faleon-haadtsd Horns and the "1his-headeil Thout pour-
ing the water of consecration upon King Nees Dionysos, to the left of
whom is the crocodile-headed Sohek, the lord of the right half of
the temple. 0n the left screen (PI. 9) the same scene takes place
