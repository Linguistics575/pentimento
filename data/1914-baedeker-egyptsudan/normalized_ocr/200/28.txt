xxii L PRELIMINARY INFORMATION. 7. Health Resortn.

Mme House Hotel (p. 36), S M. to the W. of Cairo, stands near
the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, on the verge of the Libyan Desert.
The mean maximum temperature is (XP Fahr. in Dee., 66° in Jam,
TP in Feb., 74° in March, and 800 in April. The mean minimum
for the four months Dec. to March is 5 (P. The daily range of tem-
perature is 21". The relative humidity (u. the amount of moisture,
in relation to the temperature at the time, that the air holds out of
a possible too per cent) from Dec. to March is 58 per cent by day
(8 mm. to 6 p.m.) and 80 per cent at night (8 p.m. to (5 ann.).
Dew falls in winter on about two nights out of three. At both Mena
House and l.lelwin the prevailing winds and the amount of min are
probably much the same as in Cairo. The purity of the air at both
places is marked; the medical and sanitary arrangements are eh-
rellentt - The Oasis of New Helinpolis (p119), founded as a health-
resort a few years ago, possesses similar advantages.

I/eluuht (p. 167), 17 M. to the S of Cairo and 3 M. from the
.-u1tivated land, is 115 ft. above the river. The mean maximum
temperature is 70" in Dec., 67" in Jam, 73" in Feb.. and 76° in
March. The mean minimum for these four months is YP. The daily
range of temperature is here also 21". The relative humidity from
Deo. to March is 47 per cent by day, 66 per cent at night .--r.relwim
has the advantage of being in the desert in a pure atmosphere.
It also has warms; mutated and saline springs, richer in natural
vonstituents thart' corresponding springs at Aix-les-Bains, Harm-
gate, Buxton, u The cases suitable for the baths here are such
as would derive -. "e) it from bydro-thecapeutio treatment as carried
on at Harrogate, Aiith, Aix, etct; of late years I'lelwin has been
especially recommended to sufferers from kidney- diseases, and
suitable diet is provided at all the hotels and pensions.

Luxor (p. 251) is situated about 400 M. to the S. of Cairo, in
the Thehan plain on the right bank of the river. The prevailing
winds are N.W. and N., as in the whole country. The mean maxi-
mum temperature is 7 (P in Dee., 7i' in Jan., 78" in Feb., and 85"
in March, The mean minimum for these four months is MP. The
relative humidity is Et per cent hy'day, 64 per cent at night. - In
addition to the advantage of its warm and dry climate Luxor has an
almost inexhaustible interest in its 110il1er0us antiquities, temples,
and tombs. - The temperature is 7-9" warmer than at Mena House
and Wlwin. The importance of the extra warmth of Upper Egypt
must not be lost sight of, in cases where it is imperative that the
action of the skin should be at its highest level - especially as with
this warmth a bracing effect is obtained from the dryness of the air.

Aswan (p. 353 ], situated at the First Cataract, also "the right
bank of the river, is the dryest of the Egyptian health-resorts and
may be speeially recommended in winter, when N. Egypt is often
decidedly chilly. The prevailing winds are, as at Luxor, N.W. and
"d. in winter. The mean maximum temperature is 780 in Dee., 741/2"
