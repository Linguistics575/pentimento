130 Route th PYItAMIDS 0F GiZEH. Great Pyramid.

Immediately in front of the entrance to the latter a formerly con-
healed opening in the pavement gives access to the horizontal passage ef,
which terminates in the so-caiied Chamber of the Queen (P1. 9). This
passage is at iirst 3 ft. il in. only in height, but at a distance of 61/2de.
from the chamber the paving has been removed so that the height increases
to 5 ft. Eiuehes. The N. and S. sides of the chamber are each 17 ft. in
length, and the E. and W. sides 18 ft. 10 inches. The height is 20 ft. Aim,
including the pointed root, which rises 51/:, ft. above the top or the walls
and consists of et10rm0T1i1 blocks with their ends sunk into the surrounding
masonry.

The jointing and polish of the tine-grained Mohattam limestone
in the Great Hall (Pl. h) form an nnsurpassahle marvel of akilful
masonry, of which the Arab historian'Abdellatif accurately re-
marks, that neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the
joints of the stones. The Great llall is 28 ft. high and 155 ft. long.
The lower part is 3 ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, above
the stone ramps on each side, which are 1 ft. 8 in thick and 2ft.
high, is 63/4 ft. in width. The roof is formed of seven courses of
stone projecting one above the other and crowned by horizontal
slabs. The incisions en the walls were used to facilitate the intro-
duction of the sarcophagus. On the smooth floor are irregularly hewn
hollows, which now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At
the end of the Great Hall is a small horizontal 2aoage, 22 ft. long
and 3 ft. 8 in. high, expanding about the middle into an Antecham-
her (P1. ij, which Was once closed by four trap-doors of granite, The
remains of one of these slabs, in its pendent position, should be
noticed. We next enter the Tomb Chamber proper, commonly called
the King's Chamber (Pl. h). The N. and S. sides are each 17 ft. in
length, the E. and W. sides 341/2 ft., and the height is 19 ft.; the
t1uor of the chamber is 1391/2 ft. above the plateau on Which the
Pyramid stands. The chamber is entirely lined with granite and
is roofed with nine enormous slabs of granite, each 18% ft. in
length, above which five chambers (l, m, n, 0,11) have been formed,
which may be reached from the Hall h by means of laddexs.

In constructing these hollow chmnhers the over-cautious builders made
an error in their calculations' for as a matter of fact the uppermost
chamber by itself would have been sumcieut to prevent the roof of the
King's Chamber being crushed by the superincumbent weight. The name
of thops was found in the two highest chambers (P1. 0.12).

The King's Chamber now contains nothing but an empty and
mutilated 8areophagus of granite, bearing no trace of an inscription,
the lid of which had disappeared before the time of the French
expedition (p. 126). The sarcophagus is 7% ft. long, 3 ft. 3 in.
wide, and 3 ft. 4in. high. The very massive sides ring with a clear
tom: when struck. Curiously enough, the Eing's Chamber does not
lie exactly in a line with the diagonal of the Pyramid but is 16 ft.
dim to the S. of it.

The Air Shafts (Pl. G, ri), the ends of which are seen about
3 ft, above the tloos of the chamber, were perhaps constructed from
religious motives. They are about 6 in. in height and S in. in width
