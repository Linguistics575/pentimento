10. The Golossi of Memnon.

The *Colossi of.Memnon (halted by the Arabs Es-8vrutmtt, and
also, of late, F2-yolosstu, Le.'the Crrlossi'), about 1/2 ll. to the F..
of Medinet Hahn and about the same distance to the S. of the
ltamesseum, are the most prominent landmark on the W. bank at
Thebes and are visible from a great distance on all sides. These
two colossal statues have suffered severely from the hand of time
and have lost their artistic value, but they still exert all their old
attraction in virtue of the innumerable associations that cling to
them. The two immense tigun-s and the mthitaal thrones on which
they are seated are carved out of a pebbly and quartzose sandstone-
conglomerate found in the sandstone mountains beyond Edfu, of a
yellowish-brown colour and very'limeuit to work. Both represent
Amenophis Ill. and they originally stood in front of the mortuary
temple erected by that monarch, of which only the seentiest relive
are now left. In the ltoman imperial epoch they were taken for
statues of Memnon, son at Eos and Tithonus, who slew Antilochus,
the brave son of Nestor, tlurin! the Trojan war, fo: which he was
himself slain by Aehilles.

The S. Colossus is in better preservation than the N. one, but
there is littlediffercntze between them in point of size. The dimen-
sions of the former, in which the original form is more easily seen,
are as follows: height of the figure, 52 ft, height of the pedestal on
which the feet rest, 13 ft., height of the entire monument, "ft.
But when the figure was adorned with the 1ong-sirr0e vanished
crown, the original height may have reached 69 ft. The legs from
the sole of the foot to the knee measure 19%, ft., amt each foot is
101/2 ft. long. The breadth of the shoulders is 20 ft.; the middle
linger on one hand is 41/2 ft. long; and the arm from the tip
of the finger to the elbow measures 151/g ft.
