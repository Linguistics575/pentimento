tombs, and of a few special temples (notably the temples of Deir
ehBahri and Luxor and the temple of Sethos at Ahydos). Ce uuine
art-works, it is true, are but thinly sown in Egypt, and, owing to
the enormous mass of sculpture that has been preserved, it is per-
haps more diftieutt in this than in any other branch of art for any
one but an expert to discriminate the good and artistically worthy
from the inferior and mechanical; and the diffieulty is increased
by the Get that even the best artists were unable to emancipate
themselves from certain traditional peculiarities of representation.

Our unbounded admiration is commanded by the wonderful skill
with which both artisan and artist could work the hardest stone
with comparatively primitive tools. This extraordinary technical
skill is apparent in all the productions of Egyptian sculpture But

others are an admirable fidelity in portraiture and a charming sym <
pathy with nature, which is specially apparent in the represents-

Statues. We possess specimens of the art of even the EAansT
PERIOD of Egyptian history in the shape of primitive fWIriss of men
and animals, mostly carved in bone or ivory, some of Which (especially
among the animal tigures) display a high degree of fiuigh. The
statues dating from the end of the 2nit Dyn. and the beginning of
the ANCIENT EMPIRE already possess alt the merits of Egyptian

'seulptt1re, though they still show traces of archaic stiffness. They
are mostly seated tigares of moderate size, with a constrained ar-
rangement of the limbs; the right hand usually rests on the breast,
the left hand upon the thigh. When an inscxiption occurs it is usu-
ally given in relief. But the facial features even in these primitive
works are handled with a portrait-like firmness.

In all Egyptian statues the head and trunk are carved with a
strict regard to symmetry, the only freedom ever taken being in the
