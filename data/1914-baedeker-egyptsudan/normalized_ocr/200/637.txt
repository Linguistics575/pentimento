Rook Tombs, Assufm. N. Route. 359

We noes the river in a small boat [ there and back, 6 piss. each
person). From the iaudiug-place we ascend a sandy path, which
reaches the top at Teuih 31. The ancient staircase, hewn in the
rock and consisting of two parallel flights of stops with an inclined
plane between them up which the sarcophagi were drawn, is more
fatiguing. The view from the tombs is ttne.

We begin with'romb No.'25, belonging to Mehhu. This dates
horn the 6th Dyn.; and both its construction and decoration are
somewhat crude. It contains 18 roughly worked columns in 3 rows.
Between two columns opposite the entrance is a stone table with
three legs, which was perhaps used as an altar. 0n the rear wall,
opposite the entrance, is a false deer within a recess approached
by steps and closed by a stone screen The representations on the
walls and columns show the deceased receiving various votive gifts.
To the right of the entrance sacriiieM are being made to the de-
ceased; to the left of this are agricultural scenes (ploughing; har-
vest; asses bringing home the huvest } - Adjoining is Tomb
N.'20, belonging to Sebni, son of Mekhu. The remarkable entrance
is divided by a cross-beam into two parts, the lower of which is
iillad up with rubbish. The toinb-ghaiubor contains 14 square pil-
lars. The Ilear Wall represents the deceased in ahoat, accompanied
by his daughters, hunting in the marshes: to the left he appears'
holding the throw-st'tck in one hand and the slain birds in the other;
to the right he appears harpoaning two tish at a blow; in the middle
is a papyrus-thicket with birds hovering about it.

Climbing up to the sight (N.) from this double tomb we pass
several others (Nos. 27, 29, 30), whieh axe sanded up, and reach -

No. 28, that of Keke-Â§eb (locked). in the small chamber is a
representation of the deceased as a negro, with a dark-brown skin.
- Farther on is -

"No. 31, the Lu, tomb of Sl-renyowet, son of Satet-hotep, and
a prince under Amenemhet II. Beyond a narrow Passage follow a
Hall with 6 square pillars (without decoration) and then a Corridor
with three recesses on each side. Each of these Iecesses contains
a statue of the deceased in the guise of the Osiris mummy. To the
left of the first recess is a tigurts of the deceased, followed by his
soil. At the end of the corridor is a small Hall, with four pillars,
on each of which appears the deceased. The lines dividing the scene
into squares for the guidance of the artist's hand may still be seen
in several of these designs. At the back of this hall opens a Recess
with good reliefs and delicately executed hieroglyphies. On the
baiyk-wall of the recess the deceased is shown at table, with his son
before him carrying tlowers; on the right wall the mother of the
deceased sits at table, the deceased standing to the right; on the
left wall is the deceased with his wife and his son.

Farther on are the tombs oi'Aku (No. 32), Khu'i (sanded up),
and klumes. Tho fivst contains a recess with a representation of
