ing a eatafalque above the vaulted tombs in which the deceased
are placed with due attention to the separation of the sexes. The
chapel is covered by a dome, the transition to which from the
square ground-plan is effected by means of a delicately articulated
intermediate construction. tapering gradually to an octagon. 1n
the examples dating from the Fatimite period, the pendeutives
corresponding to the four hmelled angles of theintermediate struc-
ture retain the large spherical niches borrowed from Roman and
: yzantine models. These were replaced, under the Aiyuhides, by
several rows of prism-shaped niches, and i1t1ally, under the Mame-
Iukes, by more or less complicated arrangements of stalactit -llei"
deutivee. These last are formed by a system of gradually projecting
courses of stone, embellished by dwarf domes and niches exhibiting
a very great variety of profile-outline.

The oldest mosques seem to have had no Minerals (Mixing).
The earlier examples of these towers were square throughout, tsper-
ing upwards, and were covered by a simple conical roof. The later
examples are square at the base but assume a cylindrical "poly-
gonal form in the upper stories, and are embellished with galleries
supported by stahustite-eornices and with balconies; the top story is
formed of columns or pilasters bearing a roof consisting of a dome-
shaped protuberance. The minarets contain winding staircases, two
being sometimes arranged round the same newe ] for the convenience
of the blind men who are preferred as Mtsevutts (Utdedditt, p.Ixxsvii).
The wooden rods and hooks on the galleries and top stories are used
for hanging up the lamps during the fasting month of Ramadan.

Since the end of the 14th cent., following the example set by
the mosque of the Emir GG el-Ytiseti at Cain (1366), every mosque
has possessed a Sebfl, or public fountain, except in cases when a
separate building is erected for this. The sehils are rooms with
bronze railings at which passere-by may obtain water. The upper
story of the sebil is a kind of Ioggta, supported by columns and COT-
ered with a tent-roof, frequently in elegant timher-ihitinyture.
This is the Krstuib, or elementary school. The detached columns that
often embellish the exterior of these buildings differentiate them
from an the other parts of the mosque-fayri1e, in which columns
appear only built into the angles or immured in the masonry.

Tombs. The tombs of Sultans and emire and of their families
are invariably built in connection with mosques (p, clxxxi ]. 0n the
other hand the Shaikh Tombs or tombs of saints (p. x0), which are
found in all parts of the country, are independent structures, usually
built on the spot on which the revered deceased ended his days.
These closely resemble the mortuary chapels of the mosques and are,
like them, covered with domes. The ordinary tombs of the Moslems
are generally situated on high ground, beyond the iuflt1eIiee of the
moisture of the river, and preferably in therlesert. The subterranean
vaulted ehambers are generally large enough for four or more bodies,
