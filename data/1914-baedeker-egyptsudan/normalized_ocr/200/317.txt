of Cairo.. OLD CAIRO. 5. name 109

the church is crowded. Beyond the nave, and raised by a few steps,
is the choir (P1. k) where the priests ofMiate, and which is adjoincd
by the Heikal, or sanctuary (PLI), containing the altar, and by two
sivle-chapels, that on the left (Pl. m) surmounted by an Arabian
dome. In the apse of the sanctuary rise several steps, in amphi-
theatrical fashion, towards the place which in lu'uropeirn churches
is occupied by the episcopal throne, and in the present case by',1
picture of Christ. The Sanctuary and the eide-chapels are shut "
by wooden screens, panelled and richly adorned with carvings in
wood and ivory. The finest and oldest of these are on the screen
to the left of the sanctuary; besides ornamental designs they have
representations of the Nativity, St. Demetrius, St. George fhittrt
Girgia), St. Theodore ('0, and the Eucharist. Above the door to the
right sidc-chapcl (Phn), engraved in wood, is the Coptic inscription,
'Greetings to the Temple of Cod, the Father "Below it is an Arabic
inscription with the date 112. The church routains also some
interesting Byzantine carving and mosaics in ivory, now blackened
and discoloured with age. Anumher of oldpictures of saints, some
of them on a gold ground and with well-preserved colours, possess
no artistic value. The guide expects a fee of 1 pias.frorn each
visitor, who places also 1 pias. in the (solleetion-plate.

Steps (Pl.q, r) descend to the Crypt [ often flooded), .1 small
vaulted chapel with marble columns under the choir, consisting of
nave and aisles. At the end of the nave is an altar in the form of
an early-Christian tomb-niche, which tradition indicates as the spot
where the Virgin and Child reposed; in the centre of the aisles are
apses. The right aisle contains the font, into which, according to
the Coptic ritual, the child to be baptized is dipped three times.

The citadel contains several other hasilicns, used by Coptic and
Jewish congregations, but interesting only to those who are making
a special study of this kind of architecture. Among them we may
mention the churches of St. Barbara (Sitleh Burbtra; Pl. 0," d',
restored), containing good carvings and paintings, Mari Girgia
(St. George), and hq-'Ayra (P1. C i). The Jews say that Elijah
once appeared in the modern Synagogue (Esh-Shamyun or Keritset
Ilizihu), and show a place in it where Moses is said to have pray ed.

About 20 yds. to the right of Ahu Sergeh we eater a piotur-
esque lane on the left, which leads to a low-lying iron-bound door
(Entree on the Plan, p. 106). Thence a road leads to the N., past
the rubbish heaps of the ancient Fusgdt (p. 44), and after cat 1/2 M.
reaches the white and ted striped W. facade of the externally in-
signiiisrnt mosque ofAm: (comp. Pl. C, i), which has three entrances.
Visitors usually enter by the s. fr.) entrance, below the minaret.

The Gemi''Amr ibn or-fu., or Mosqu: of AIM, owes its name
to the general of the Caliph Omar, though not a trace now remains
of the original mosque, which was only 50 ells long and 30 eiis
