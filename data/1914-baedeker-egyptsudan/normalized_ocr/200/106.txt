0 w. ANCIENT HISTORY.

V. DYNASTY (2750-2625 13.0.).

Egypt now rearhed the zenith of her civilization; art, in partic-
ular, attained a perfection never again reached. The pyramids of
the kings are mostly near Abusir (p.141), where special sanctuaries
were built also for the sun-god Re.

Nuaerri built the sanctuary of Abu Gur'ab (p. 140) and the yyr-

amid and mortuary temple at Ahusir (p, 141).

Sehuré, whose pyramid and mortuary temple are at Ahusir (p.141),
carried on wars against the Libyans and Asiatics.
Onnos (Unis), the last king of the 5th Dyu., built his pyramid near

Sahhéta (p. 165 ]. After his death internal dissensions seem to

have broken out, resulting in the accession of a new dynasty.

VI. DYNASTY (ca. 2625-2l75 BAJO.

Under this dynasty the power of the kings was more limited,
and the small principalities recuvered some of their independence.
Far-reaching commercial relations were entered into with the Upper
Nile, Punt (the S. coast of the Red Sea), Syria, etc.

Towards the end of the 6th Dyn. the monarchy fell and civil
strife broke out. While the successors of the 6th Dyn. (VIII. Dynasty)
may have maintained themselves at Memphis, a new race of in-
dependent kings established themselves "1Ieriualeopolis (IX.
r? X. Dynasties) and for a time ruled the whole of Egypt. 0n the
other hand the chief power in the S. was seized by Theban princes
(XLDynaxty), most of whom were named Mentnhotep. The mortu-
ary temple of two of these has been found at Deir elvBahri (p. 304).
Dependent on these sovereigns Were the Thehan sub-kings named
Entef (Euyotef), whose small tombs lay near Drah Atnfq Negga
(p. 283). The Mentuhoteps finally overthrew the kings of Beriu3leo-
polis and gradually succeeded in reuniting the whole country. The,
first ruler over reunited Egypt was Amenetht 1., with whom begins -

4. The Middle Emyire (2000-1580 B.00.
'XIL DYNASTY (9000-1788 B.00.

This was Egypt's most prosperous period, and an epoch of great
buildings. There is hardly a considerable town in Egypt without some
traces of the building activity of the kings of this dynasty. Literature
and art flourished. The kingdom Was organized as a feudal state.
