Amenophis IV. (i375-1358 BIL ] endeavoured to replace the old
religion by the worship of a single deity, vis. the sun, an
attempt perhaps to provide a god that should be worshipped in
r'ommon by all the peoples of the extensive empire (p. cxlvi). The
movement was probably instigated by the priests of lIeliopolis
and was directed at tirst only against the gods of Thebes, who,
during the New Empire, had thrown all others into the shade.
Many of the ancient deities, especially those of Thebes, were
fauatically'persecuted', their images and names being removed
from all monuments. For his own original name, in which the
name ofAmon occurs, the king substituted that of Ekh-en-Aton,
'the disk of the sun rejoices'. Tell el-" Amarna (p.111) was
made the capital instead ofThebes. AmeuophisIV. was buried at
Bibin el-Mul6k tp. 238). After his death internal commotion:
broke out and the new religion was abolished.

Among his successors (1368-1350110) were Eye (tombs at Tell
el-'Amarna, p. 216, and at Bibin e1-uuhik, p. 298) and Tut-
enkh-Amnn, who transferred the royal residence back to Thebes.
