By Captain Ir, t7. Lyons.

EGYPT proper, the country between the mouth of the Nile and
the First Cataract, is a small region with well-detined na toral bound-
aries on three sides. On the N. is the Mediterranean Sea, on the lit
the Anhian Desert and the Red Sea, and on the W. the Libyan Des-
eat. The S. boundary is not marked by any natural feature, and has
therefore at all ages been liable to alteration. Its flugtaati0ns to the
N. and S. form a hind of standard 0f the political power of Egypt,
and the causes of the variations involve a great part of Egyptian
history from the most ancient times down to the present day.

When Mohammed Ali, the founder of the modern vassal king-
dom of Egypt (comp. pp. cxx at ser), died in 1849, he bequeathed
to his successor a power extending far to the s. at the First Cataract
and including not only the Nubian Valley of the Nile, with the Nu-
bian desert-regions, but also the so-called Egyptian ST1dirt (Bilid
es-anlin,'land of the blacks' ], consisting of the districts of mm,
Sennfr, and Kowlofén. The Khedive Ismkril o. cxxii) pushed his
boundaries towards the S. until they comprised the whole cnuree of
the White Nile and the greater part of the basin of the Bohr el-
Ghazai, and fmally extended to ahout2°N. latitude. Battherebel1ion
of the Arab tribes that broke out in 1883 under the Mahdi (p. cxxiv ]
utterly destroyed the new Egyptian power on the White Nile and
caused the frontier to be withdrawn to Wadi Halfa. The cam-
paigns of 1896-95 and the capture of 0tndurmia (p. cxxv), how-
ever, tinally united the Stdin with Egypt, though under totally
altered conditions. Thus Egypt strictly so called now includes the
valley ofthe Nile up to a point 27 M. to the N. of Wédi lialfa, the
dissect-strip along the Red Sea, the coast to the W. of Alexandria
as far as the Gulf of Solum, the Libyan Desert with the five Oases,
the greater part of the Sinai Peninsula, and the region of El-'Arish
(comp. Ihsedeker's Palestine). Its extreme length is 630 M. (N. Int,
3155' to 22°), its breadth 596 M. (E. 1ong.25" 2r to 34'756'), and its
area, inclusive of the deserts, ca. 400,000 sq. M. The area of
Egypt proper, excluding the deserts, the oases, and the districts of
Ii'ul-'Arish, Sinai, Maryr) t., Mirsa Mat.rtht, Ed-Dabs', and Kogeir, is
about 12,000 sq. M. The Sturau, which begins on the Nile a little
to the N. of midi IJalfa and on the Red Sea at 22° N. lat., is under
a special Anglo-llgyptian administration (comp. p. M5).

From the earliest times Egypt has been divided into two parts
of very unequal size, known as Lower and Upper Egypt. The
boundary between these is still, as in antiquity, to the S. of Cairot
