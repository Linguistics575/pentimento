126 Route 6. PYRAMIDS OF Gillan. Construction.

construction of the Pyramids has been opposed by Flinders Petrie,
who has sought to show that the initial plan of each pyramid Ieti-
cally contemplated the full extent reached by the completed work.
But more recently Borchardt has demonstrated conclusively that
Lepsius's theory ofthe gradual growth of each pyramid is not incur Â»
rect, though it requires modiMation in some essential points. Ae-
cording to Borehardt, each pyramid builder began try planning a
monument of moderate size. In many instances this original small
conception was permanently adhered to; but it not nnfrequently
happened that kings who enjoyed long reigns or found themselves
in control of more extensive powers expanded theiroriginal designs
and enlarged their buildings, either by mere additions without
altering the passages or chambers [ as in the step-pyramid at Sah-
lara) or by revising the whole original design, including the cham-
hers, etc., on anew and more extensive seale (as in the second
and third pyramids "Gizeh). Occasionally a second enlargement
took place, as in the case of the Great Pyramid.

The Pyramids were opened by saerilegious robbers at a very early
period, probably under the 20th Dyn., when also the tombs of the
Thehan kings were plundered, or even earlier. Attempts were made
to force an entrance into the inner chambers, and passages were
laboriously cut through the solid masonry in order to reach the
expected treasures. In the course of this mining and tunnelling the
passages and chambers sustained much damage. Somewhere about
the period of the 25th or 26th Dyn. these injuries were repaired
and the pyramids restored. Bat they seem to have been again in-
vaded hy the Persians; and also at later periods, under the Romans
and under the Arabs, renewed attempts were made to penetrate
to the treasures supposed to lie in the interior.

The tirst modern traveller whn carefully and successfully examined
the Pyramids was Xichulae Shaw in 1721; hut he still entertained the
notion that the Sphinx had a subterranean connection with the Great
Pyramid. He was followed by Norden in 1737; Pecocke in 1743, who
gives a plan and dimensions; Founnout in 1755; Cereten Niehnhr in
1761; Davison in 1763; Bruce in 1763; Vulney in 1783; Brownein179 98;
veuon, Cuntene, Jomarrl, and other: avants of the French experl ion
under Bonaparte in 1799-1801. Jomard in particular hes the merit or
having taken very accurate measurements. Hamilton, in Moi, was a
dispussiouate and critical observer. 1111817 Caviglizt, a bold, but illiterate
and feneit'n ] seamen, was fortunate in eliciting new facts regarding the
interior of the Great Pyramid, and excavated the Sphinx. In the same year
Belzoni thoroughly explored the interior of the Second Pyramid. Belzoni,
an intelligent explorer and accurate drat1ghtssmuy, was originally a monk
at Rome, but when the French occupied that city he retired to London,
Where be devoted himself to study in spite of many hardshipst 11:1815 he
reached Egypt, where, besides exploring the pyramid, he discovered the
tomb otSethus L atTI1ebes, etc. The next eminer1texpIorecwas Sir Gardner
Wilkinson in 1831. In 1837 end 1838 Colt Howard Vyse and Mr. Perring
made very thorough investigations and took careful measurements which
will always be considered authoritative, In 18l2A5 Prof. Lepsine, the
distinguished German Egyptologist, made several very important discov-
eries and furnished us with much valuable information He found no
