consisting generally of four low walls formed of crude bricks of
Nile mud, and thatched with (l roof of durm straw, on which the
poultry most. In the interior are a few mats, a sheepskin, several
baskets made at matting, a copper kettle, and a few earthenware
pots and wooden dishes. hit the railsvay-tcaveller, passing through
the Delta for the iirst time, must not suppose that the miserable,
ruinous huts that meet his eye are typical of all peasants' dwellings
in Egypt. In Centre! and Upper Egypt he will obtain a much more
favourable impression. The fact is, that beneath an Egyptian sky,
houses arenotofthe sauiepararnotint importance as in more northern
regions, all that is wanted being shelter for the night. The day is
spent in the open air, an the court in front of the hut, shaded by
acacia trees, among whose bmnthes the pigeons coo. Here the fellah

always in a sour condition or half converted into cheese, and in
very moderate quantities only. In the height of slimmer the con-
