c. The Nile.
By Captain ll. G. Lyons'

From the sources of the Nyavaranya, a tributary of the Kagera
River, to the sea the Kagera-Nile is the second longest rontinuons
"aterway in the world (4037 M. J, being surpassed only by the
Mi: sippi-Missouri, which "probably about 100 M. longer. From
the P. ipon Falls at Lake Victoria to the sea the distance is 3473 M..
so that the Nile proper is the longest single river in the world, the
Yang-tse-kia" probably coming next.

Rising to the N.E. of Lake Tanganyika, the waters of the Nya-
varongo-Kagtyr'a flow into the great Vietoria Lake, on the N. shore
of Which, at the Itrpon Falls, begins the true Nile. After a course
of 242 M. this rnters the Albert Luke. From this point, under the
name nf the Ballr el-Gcbel, it traverses a rocky channel as far as
Gondokoro, and it then flows for 470 M. through the swamps which
till the valley and provide the reeds and grasses of the'sudd', or mass
of vegetation which from time to time blocks the channel (p. 435).
In latitude 9° 30' N, the main stream receives two tributaries, the
Bultr el-Ghau'il and the Balm ez-ZarJ/'eh, and a little farther on it is
joined by the important Sobat River, to which the annual Mod of
the White Nile is due. From this point to Khartim the Ruhr el-
Abyad or'White Nild, as it is here called, tlows through a shallow
valley of considerable width, until it isjoinetl by the Barr el-Azmk,
i. e, the'blue','dark', or'turbrd' Nile, so called in o0ntradistine
tion to the White Nile, the'oleac' water of Which has been filtered
in its passage through the marshes of the Bahi- el-Gehel or has de-
posited its silt in the upper reaches of the Sohat. Between Khartpim
and the sueditcrranean, a distance of 1000 M,, the Nile receives no
further addition to its supply except from the river Aibam, while
it is being rontinnally diminished by evaporation, by percolation into
the sandstone of the desert through which it tlows, and by the irri-
gation of its flood-plains in Egypt" _ Between Wadi Halfn and
Assuén the average breadth of the Nile is about 550 yds., to the N.
of Assuén it varies from 550 to 980 yds.

As practically no rain falls within its limits, Egypt would uease.
to exist as a fertile country and would become a desert valley,
similar to those of the Sahara, were it not for its constant supply of
water from the Nile. Thus the all-important annual INUNDATION of
that river merits special notice as the great event of theEgyptian yeari

The heavy rains which fall from June to September on the Abys-
sinian tahleland cause the Blue Nile and the Athara to rise rapidly,
and their waters carry down in suspension vast quantities of the
mud which has during many centuries formed the fertile valley and
delta of Egypt, but of which very little is deposited now, however,
owing to the perennial irrigation (comp. p.1xxi). The volume of
the Blue Nile flood, whit, h may reach and even exceed 350, 000 cubic
