which were built on the banks of tho river, well above the annual
inundation, are now below it, and foundations which were originally
dry are nov below the infiltration-level and in I'oIIschIOIIce haw-
deteriorated.

This remarkable river has exercised a unique tufluuitee on the
history "cixilization. The necessity of oontrol0g its course and
utilizing its water taught the ancient Rpyptians the art of river
engineering and the kindred science of Mad-surveying, while in the
starry heavens they behold the eternal calendar Which regulated the
approach and the departure of the inundation, so that the river may
perhaps have given the f1rstirnpulse to the study ofastronomy. As
the annual overflow of the water obliterated all Jandmarlrs, it was
necessary annually to measure the land anew, and to hoop a register
of the Men belonging to each proprietor; and above all it became
an important duty of the rulers of the people to impress them with
a strong sense ofthe sacredness of property, Similar causes produced
a like result in Babylonin. Every succeeding year, however, there
arose new disputes, and these showed the necessity of estahlishing
settled laws and enforcing judicial Me ions. The Nile thus led to
the fnundatiou of social, legal, and political order.

Subsequently, when the engineers and architects, in the service
of the state "in the cause of religion, erected those e0l0ssal strtte-
tures with which we are about to become acquainted, it was the
Nile which materially facilitated the transport of their materials,
and enabled the builders of the pyramids and the other ancient
Egyptians to rmploy the granite of Assuin for the structures ot
Memphis, and even fur those of Tania, near the coast of the Medi-
terranean. As the river, nurroover, not only afforded a convenient
route for the transport "these trMlding-rnaterials, but also an ad..
mirable commercial highway, we find that the Egyptianshad acquired
considerable skill at a very early period in constructing vessels
with oars, masts, sails, and even cabins and other appliance;

From the earliest historical period Jowp to the present time the
course of the Nile, from the cataracts ilown to its bifurcation to the
N. of Cairo, has undergone very little, change. This, however,
is not the ease with its Enmovmwmzs; for, while ancient writers
mention seven (the Pelusiac, the Tanitie, theMertdesian, theBueolir,
or Phatnitic, the Sebcunytio, the 1lolbitinie, and the Canopic), there
are now practically th channels only through which the rivetis

and DaIIIietta (1) IIIIIv'), situated near the middle ofthe Delta, while
the Peluxiar and Canopil mouths, the most important in ancient
tim es, lay at the extreme E. and W. ends of the coast respectively,
