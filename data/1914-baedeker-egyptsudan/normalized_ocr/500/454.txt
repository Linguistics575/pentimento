216 Route M. TELL ELVAMARNA. From Cairo

In the rear wall is a false door. To the right a winding staircase of

46 steps leads to a chamber in which opens the mummy-shaft.

TOMB 10, of Epei, is unfinished. To the left, in the entrance, are the
king and queen offering two pictures to the sun, the king presenting two
princesses who worship the names of the sun, while the queen presents her
own portrait, also adoring the names of the sun; behind them are three
princesses with sistra; the sun darts his rays upon an altar loaded with
food and vessels. - TOMB 11, of Ramose. To the left, in the entrance,
are the royal pair accompanied by a princess, receiving the symbol of
'Life' from the sun's rays, which are shaped like hands. In the niche
are seated fhipsres of the deceased and his wife. - Tomes 12 and 13, though
unfinished, are of interest as illustrating the method in which these rock-
tombs were hollowed out. - Tour, ll belonged to Mei, a'military cem-
mander and fan-bearer on the king/s right hand', whose name has every-
where been carefully obliterated, while the names of the king and queen
have been left uninjured. The tomb is unfinished. On the right portion
of the entrance-wall are preliminary sketches in black of the quays of the
City of the Sun, with ships, gardens, and the palace in the baekground. -
Tom; 17, though a fine specimen, has no representations or inscriptions. -
TOMB 19, of fhsti, had just been begun.

TOMB 23, belonging to Enei, a royal house-steward and scribe, differs
from the other tombs in its arrangement. A flight of limestone steps as-
cends to the entrance, which is crowned with a concave cornice, and in
front of which a colonnade was intended to be erected. On each side of
the lintel are the king and queen and three princesses praying to the sun;
on the left side in the entrance is the deceased praying, with the text
of his prayer in front of him? on the right side he appears with a staff
and nosegay (painted on stucco). The walls of the MAIN CHAMBER are
coated with stucco, but with the exception of the concave cornice at the
top are unpainted. In the NiCHE is a eolossa1 statue of the deceased. Un
the right wall are the deceased and his wife seated before a worshipper;
0n the left wall, the deceased seated at table and receiving flowers train
a priest. These Scenes also are painted on stucco but are much faded.

TOMB 25, the farthest to the S. in this group, belonged to Eye
(AI), the successor of Amenophis IV. (p. cit), and perhaps his father-.
in-law. This tomb, like so many of the others, was leftunfinished,
because Amenophis died during its construction and the court was
soon afterwards removed back to Thebes, where Eye caused a new
tomb to be made for himself (p. 298). On the Doon POSTS, to the
right and left, are Eye and his wife Teye, kneeling below inscrip-
tions. In the ENTRANCE, to the left, are the king and queen, followed
by the princesses and the court, praying to the sun, which directs
its arm-shaped rays towards the altar; below are Eye and his wife in
prayer. To the right are Eye, in his offieial costume, and Ms wife
praying, their prayers being inscribed beside them. - The MAIN
CHAMBER was designed to be supported by'bi papyrus-columns
with bud-capitals, but only 15 have been hewn out, and of these
only 4 are finished. The remainder (to the S.) have just been begun
in the living rock at the top. On three of the columns appear the
deceased and his wife, adoring the names of the sun and of the
king and queen. In the centre of the rear wall and in the tCW.
angle are unfinished doors; in the N.E. angle is a flight of steps
intended to lead to the sarcophagus-chamber, which has not even
been begun. The representation on the left portion of the Entrance
Wall, the only one finished, deserves notice. To the left are the
