Trees. POLITICAL NOTES. lxxv

h. Trams AND 1-'I.ANTAT10NS. The extensive planting of trees
since the middle of the 19th cent. has introduced a new feature into
the Egyptian landscape. In ancient times most of the timber re-
quired for ship-building and other purposes seems to have been
imported from abroad. Mohammed Ali, a great patron of horti-
culture, at one time offered prizes for the planting oftrees, but his
efforts were unattended with success, as the climatic and other difti-
oulties attending the task were then but imperfectly understood in
Egypt. Ibrahim followed the example ofhis predecessor, but'Abbiis I.
and Sa'id were sworn enemies to trees of every kind, and they were
content that their palaces should be exposed to the full glare of the
sun. A new epoch, however, began when the Khedive Ismifil sum-
moned to Egypt M. Barillet (1869), superintendent of the gardens
of Paris, one of the most skilful landscape-gardeners of the day.
The finest of the shade-trees, both on account ofits umbrageominess
and the excellence of its wood, and one which thrives admirably, is
the lebbakh (Albizzia Lebbek), Which has long been erroneously
called by travellers the acacia of the Nile (the latter being properly
the gun; tree). Within forty years the lebbakh attains a height of
St) ft. and a great thickness, while the branches project to a long
distance over the roads, covering them with a dense leafy canopy
within a remarkably short time. Among the most important of the
other kinds of trees thus planted are the magnificent'Flarnhoyer
des Indes' (Poinciana puleherrima), the rapidly-growing Jacaranda,
Casuarina, and Eucalyptus, tropical fig-trees, and several rare
varieties of palms.

The commonest TREES OF AN EARLIER PERIOD which the trar-
eller will encounter in every town in Egypt are the following: -
The Acacia Nilotica (eunt), the thorn-tree of antiquity, the pods
0iariu.1) of which, resembling the beads of a rosary, yield an excel-
lent material for tanning purposes. Gest to the palm, this is the
tree most frequently seen by the wayside and in the villages. Then,
the Acacia Farnesiana ffu.fneh), with blossoms of delicious perfume;
the sycamore (gemma's), anciently considered sacred; the Zizyphus,
or Christ's thorn- tree (ncblt'); tamarisks (utl); the Parkinsouia
(seiseban); mulberry-trees (tilt); and oarob-trees, or bread of
St. John (Iclmrrab).

Among the FRUIT Terms the most important is the date-palm
(Phoenix dactylifera, nakhla; the date, balaft; the ribs of the leaf,
gertd; the points of the leaf, sa'af; the terminal bud, gummdr; the
hast, Hf). In 1007 there were 6,966,010 date-palms in Egypt.
The date-palms blossom in March and April, and the fruit ripens
in August and September. Fre: ,h dates are rough in appearance.
blood-red or pale yellow in colour, and harsh and astringent in
taste. Like the medlar they become more palatable after fermen-
tation has set in. There are no fewer than twenty-seven kinds of
date commonly offered for sale. The largest attain a length of three
