SIDE R0031 XI. Here is represented the gate of the underworld
and the sun's journey through the 3rd region (from the'Book of the
Gates', p. 284). - SIDE ROOM XII. The interesting texts in this
room contain a very ancient myth of a rebellion of mankind against
the sun-god, their punishment, and the final rescue of the survivors.
The scene on the rear wall is an illustration from this myth: the
heavenly cow, supported by the god Show and other spirits, with
two boats of the sun floating on its body.

SIDE Roost XIII (the saerifleia1 chamber) contains two pillars,
one of which has fallen. On the other appears the king before Ptah
and Osiris. Round the three main walls runs a bench, decorated with
a concave cornice; the small pillars which originally supported it
have been destroyed. The representations upon it are almost entirely
obliterated. On the Entrance Wall (to the left) and the Left Walt
appears the sun's journey during, the 7th hour of night (from the
'Book of him who is in the Underworld').

Middle Row. The eun-god once more is shown in his boat, on the
prow of which stands Isis, to drive away evil spirits with her spells. In
front of the boat a large serpent has been overcome by the goddess Selket
and a god. Farther on are four goddesses with swords, and the graves,
adorned with human heads, of the gods Atom, Khepre, RE, and Osiris.
Top Row. Spirits and daemons; human-headed serpent-, a god ('Flesh
of Osiris') seated upon a throne beneath a serpent; three foes of Osiris,
beheaded by a lion-headed god; a god holding a cord binding three foes
lying on the ground; three human-headed birds wearing crowns, etc.
Bottom Row. Horus, before whom are the twelve star-gods who con-
duet the sun at night; twelve starr-goddesses approaching the grave of

Osiris, upon which a crocodile rests. The god's head projects from the
grave-mound.

0n the Rear Wall is the sun's journey during the 8th hour of
night (from the'Book of him who is in the Underworld').

Middle Row. The boat of the sun towed by eight men, preceded by
nine followers of RE, who are represented by the hieroglyph for'follow',
with a head attached to it in front. Four rams (forms of the god Tenen)
head the procession. Top and Bottom Rows. Dwellings of deceased gods
and spirits, the doors of which open as the sun-god approaches, showing
the occupants restored to life. In each house in the top row are three

gods (first the nine gods of Heliopolis), in the bottom row snakes and
other spirits.

On the Entrance Wall (to the right) and Right Wall is the sun's
journey during the 6th hour of night (from the'Book of him who is
in the Underworld').

Middle Row. The boat of the Sun is here preceded by Thout with the
head of a cynocephalus (his sacred animal), holding in his hand an ibis
(also sacred to him), and by a goddess carrying the pupils of the eyes of
Horus. The remainder of the row is taken up by a house, in which stand
sixteen spirits together with the recumbent figure of the god Khepre, sur-
rounded by a Serpent with five heads. Four of the sixteen spirits represent
the kings of Upper Egypt, four the kings of Lower Egypt, while the rest
are in the guise of mummies. In the Top and Bottom Rom are other spirits.
In the latter is a serpent, with the heads ofthe four genii of the dead upon
its back, also nine fiery serpents with swords, all intended to annihilate
the foes of the sun-god.

The second side-ehamher on the right is unnumbered and has 110

decorations. - Room XIV has no decorations and is inaccessible.
