h. of the court is the Tomb of Userhét (No. 61), the tirst prophet
of Thutmosis 1. This tomb was constructed in the time of llamses II.
A charming scene on the right end-wall represents the deceased and
two women under a tree, with their souls shown in the form of birds.
Other birds sit in the branches, while to the right stands a goddess
giving water to the deveased. Some of the other details also are
very attractive. On the rear uall, to the right of the door to the
corridor (blocked up), the deceased and his sisters are shown saeri-.
ticing to Osiris at the top, while below they stand in the presence of
Thutmosis. - To the E. is the Tomb of Amen-wehsu (No. Ill),
a painter who has decorated the walls with his own hands with
well-preserved scenes on stucco and texts ot religious import. -
The Tomb of Khensumes (No. 30), on the W. side of the court, is
much dilapidated and not accessible.

A little to the N. of this court is the Tomb of Khonsu (No. 31),
the first prophet of Thutmosis 111., with beautiful paintings. On
the rear wall to the left are represented the pylons of the temple
of Hermonthis, in which the deceased oftieiated.

Among the mounds of rubbish between the Ramcsseum and the
large enclosure (p. 310) is the *Tomb of Ramose (No. 55), a vizier,
who flourished in the reign of the heretical king Amenophis IV.
(p. cif). As one of the few monuments dating from the begin-
ning of the reign of Amenophis IV., the period at which the transi-
tion from the ancient religion to pure sun-worship was accomplished,
this tomb is. of great historical importance. The tomb consists of
an open Court surrounded by colonnades and a Hall. Some of the
scenes are executed in delicate reliefand some are painted in bright
eolours orjust sketched in in black pigment. The pillars of the court
are no longer standing,, and the N. part is still covered with rubbish.
The ABCADES OF THE Covwr have been shut off by modern walls
and are protected by a wooden roof. 0n the E. Wall we see Ramose
at table with his wife Merit-Ptah and his relatives, very delicately
executed in relief. On the S. Wall are painted burial-sceues. 0n
the lefthalfot'the W. M'all is Amenophis IV., stii1 represented in the
old conventional manner, seated below a canopy with Meat, the god-
dess oftruth, whilellamose is represented Write; on the righthalfthe
king and his consort are shown on a balcony of the palace, watch-
ing Ramose being adorned with the golden chains they have thrown
down to him. The unattractive tigure of the king is here repro-
duced with great iitlelity to nature; the figure of Ramose is merely
sketched in. Above are the sun and its beams; behind, the royal
body-guard. Farther to the right is Ramose leaving the palace with
his decorations and receiving the eoneratulations of the populace.
1n the doorway, to the left, llamose appears standing; on the right
liarnose and his wife, followed by three rows of servants, are bring-
ing a satt1fiee.

Adjoining this tomb on the S. is the Tomb of Userhét (No. 56),
