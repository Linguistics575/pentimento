entrances to the recesses (Pl. t, u) Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III
offer milk and wine to IIathor.

We return hence to the Central Terrace and ascend the inclined
approach which brings us first to a much ruined HALL, the roof of
which was borne by pillars and sixteen-sided columns. A granite
doorway here gives access to the -

Upper Terrace, The central part of the terrace was occupied by
a large HYPOSTYLE HALL, now in a state of complete ruin. Its walls
were adorned with reliefs of a festal procession, which have suffered
severely at the hands of the Coptic monks. - Turning sharp to the
right (N.), we reach a door (Pl. a/) admitting to a VBSTIBULB, which
had three sixteen-sided columns. Opposite the door is a small
Recess (PI. y"), with representations of Queen Hatshepsut, in good
preservation.

Rear Wall of the reces: Hatshepsut (erased) before Amon. Side
Walls: Hatshepsut seated at table, with a priest clad like the god Hor-
En-metf in front of her. The flgure of the queen is uninjured, contrary to
the usual practice; but the priest's figure was defaced by Amenophis IV.

To the left of the vestibule we enter an open COURT, in which is
an *Altar, approached by ten steps and dedicated by Hatshepsut to
the sun- god RÃ©-Harakhte. This is one of the very few altars that have
come down to us from Egyptian antiquity on their original sites.
In the W. wall of this court is a small recess with saerifieial scenes
on the walls (the figure of' Hatshepsut erased). - A door in the N.
wall of this court admits to a Chapel, comprising two chambers.
With a few unimportant exceptions the reliefs on the walls have
been chiselled away by Thutmosis III. and Amenophis IV.

On the side-walls of the Is! Chamber (Pl. D) Hatshepsut oll'ers sacri-
fices to various deities, mainly deities of the dead, such as Anubis, Soker,
Osiris, and Eme-wet, and also to Amon. Above a bench against the
end wall is a representation of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis I. before the
symbol of Eme-wet. 2nd Chamber. On the right wall: Thutmosis I. (ori-
ginally Hatshepsut) and his mother Seniseneb, sacrificing to Anubis. On
the left wall: Hatshepsut and her mother Ahmes saeriiicing t0 Amen.
On the end-wall: Hatshepsut and Anubis. 0n the ceiling are represent-
ations of the stars.

On the S. side of the upper terrace are several chambers now in
ruins and a well-preserved SACRIFICIAL HALL, with a vaulted roof,
which was used for the cult of the manes of Hatshepsut and is
adorned with reliefs.

To the right and left of the entrance: slaughter and cutting up of the
"erifieial beasts. On the side-walls are shown three rows of priests and
officials bringing swHficial gifts to Hatshepsut, and above are sacrificial
objects of various kinds. Hatshepsut herself0efl'aced) is seated with a list
of the offerings before her, while priests offer incense 0r perform other
rites. 0n the end wall is represented the door that led into the realm
of the dead.

In the W. wall of the large hall in the middle of the terrace is
a series of large and small Recesses, containing representations
of Thutmosis III. and IIatshepsut in presence of the gods. The
larger recesses were occupied by Osiris-statues of the queen. In the
