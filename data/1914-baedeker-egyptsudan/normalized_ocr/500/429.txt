The village of Biehmu or Bihamu, which lies 0n the railway lo
tienfires (p. 192), 41/2 M. to the N. of Medinet tsl-Fai) is usually
visited on donkey-back (il/s hr.; there and back 15 pies.) or by carriage

past the Government School, the Government Hospital, and several country-
houses. It then traverses fertile tields and passes palm groves and fig-
Orehards, aif'ording an insight into the fertility of the district. - By the
railway-cmhankmeut, about 1/2 M, to the N. of the station of Biahmu,
rise two large stone Piles, which present the appearance of ruined
pyramids and are called by the natives Eursi Fara'an. ('Pharaoh's chair')
or Es.-tiattum ('the idol'). These were the pedestals of two Colossal sandstone
Statues of King Amenemh√©t 111., remains of which have been found by
Lepsins and by Prof. Flinders Petrie, who estimates their original height
at M) ft. The learned Father Vansleh of Erfurt saw the lower portion of
one of these figures in 1672. The pedestals were Once washed by the
waters of Lake Marie, and there is little doubt that they are the two
pyramids described by Herodotus as standing in Lake Moeris, each with
a eolossal seated human figure upon it.

Near Ebglg (railway station, see above), 2 M. to the s.w. of Medinet
el-Faiytun, lies a red granite obelisk, now broken, which must once have
been at least M) ft. in height. The natives call it'Amad, or the column.
