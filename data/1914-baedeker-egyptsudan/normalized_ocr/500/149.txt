name of Ri'-Harakhte, i.e.'the sun, the Horus who is on the horizon'.
The tow-goddess Hathor (whose name means'House of Horns') be-
came a goddess of the heavens. Many local deities came to be fvor-
shipped all over the country under these particular characteristics.

Finally there was also a considerable number of lesser deities,
daemons, and spirits, who exereisedinfluenee over human beings,
helping or harming at particular junctures, and who therefore
must be propitiated. Among these rank, for example, the different
Goddesses of Childbirth, who assisted women and could either cut
short or protraet their pangs; the grotesque god Bes, the protector
of the marriage chamber and of' women in childbirth; various God-
desses of the Harvest, etc. At a later period unusually distinguished
mortals, revered after death as saints, gradually came to be included
among the gods, as, e.g., Imliotep of Memphis (p. Cii), Amenhotep,
the son of Ilapu, etc.

Like human beings the god frequently had a wife and a son,
and in that case this so-called Triad dwelt and was worshipped in
one temple. Divine families of this kind are exemplified in Ptah,
with his wife Sekhmet and his son Nefertem, and by Osiris, Isis,
and Horus. The theologians of the holy city ofOn (Heliopolis) even
created a ninefold group (Ennead) of gods, at the head of which
stood Alum, the local deity of the city. Atum was attended by the
four eosmogonie deities Show, his wife Tefnut, Keb, and Nut (p. exlii).
The number nine. was made up by Osiris, his wife Isis, Seth (the
ancient god of Upper Egypt and the legendary antagonist of Osiris;
see below), and his wife Nephthys. The worship of the nine gods be-
came so popular that it was adopted in many different localities,
the place of Atum being taken by the chief local god in each.

Iluman passions and virtues were attributed to the gods; and
numerous tales were told by the faithful of the divine exploits and
adventures. Unfortunately most of' these myths have perished; of
the few that have rome down to us the best known is the story of
Osiris, which in antiquity also was one ofthe most widely spread.
Osiris ruled as king over Egypt and the country enjoyed the blttss-
ings of prosperity. But Seth, his wicked brother, conspired against
him, and at a banquet persuaded him to enter a cunningly wrought
chest, which he and his seventy-two accomplices then closed and
threw into the Nile. The river carried the chest down to the sea,
and the waves at length washed it ashore near the Phenieian Byblos.
Meanwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the world, seeking
her lost husband; and she at length succeeded in discovering his
troffin, which she carried to Egypt and there mourned over her hus-
band in solitude. She then buried the coffin before going to visit
her son Horus, who was being brought up at lluto. During her
absence Seth, while engaged in a boar-hunt, found the body of his
brother, cut it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them in every
direction. As soon as Isis learned what hail happened she songht
