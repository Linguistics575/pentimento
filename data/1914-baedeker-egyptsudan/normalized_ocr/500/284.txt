the so-called Pant des Anytais, spanning the W. arm of the Nile,
and, under the name of Shari" et-Gizeh, skirts the river through

the Survey Department (director, E. Gr. Dowson), and opposite is
the Mi1dtrtyeh of the province of Gizeh. Farther on are the public
Gizeh Gardens, behind which lie the Polytechnic School and the -

Zoological Gardens (open daily, o till sunset; adm. 1/2, on.
Sun., when a military band plays, 5 pies; café-telse), which are
rich in rare African animals and birds. The beautiful park itself,
52 acres in extent, is worth visiting for the magnificent royal palms
(Oreodoxa regia), papyrus reeds, lotus plants, and other character-
istic Egyptian vegetation. - The road next reaches the N. end of the
little town of Gizeh, Where. at the station known as Gizeh Village,
it joins the tramway to the Pyramids (No. 14, p. 38). To the right

The "Egyptian Museum (Muséc Egyptiqn du Caire, Arab. El-
Antikkhéneh), containing Egyptian and Greek antiquities found in
the valley of the Nile, lies in the Shari' el-Antikkhineh el-Gedideh,
not far from the Ifatr en-Nil Bridge. Founded by the French Egypt-
ologist Aug. Mariette (1821-81) in 1857 and originally housed at
B61515, the Museum was greatly enlarged by later directors (thoaut,
De Morgan, Loret, and especially Maspero) and is by far the largest
and most important collection of its kind. Its growth is steady and
rapid, owing to the regular archaeological enterprises of the Egyptian
Department of Antiquities, to purchases, and to the proceeds of
foreign excavations, half of which have to be surrendered to the
Museum on request. - The present Director (and also Direetor-
General of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities) is Sir Gaston
Jfaspero; the Conservators are Emil Brugsch-Pusha, Alyned-Bey
kamat, and G. Daressy. - General Catalogue (Y/aide to the Cairo
Museum'; 1913), by Sir G. Maspero, 20 pias. Comp. also L. Borehardt,'s
