THEBES (E. BANK). l. Temple

111 front of the principal Pylon
(H. P-P) of the temple were six
Colossal Statues of Ramses IL, two

I sitting and four standing, of Which

only the two sitting and the western-
most of the others are now in position.
The sitting figures are about 45 ft.
in height; that on the E. is buried
breast-high in rubbish. In front
of these seated figures rose two
Obelisks of pink granite, erected
on the occasion of a jubilee of Ilarn-

the left, the king on his throne
holds a council of war with his
princes; in the middle is the camp,
fortified by the shields of the sol-
diers arranged side by side and
attached by the Hittites; to the
right, the king in his chariot dashes
into the fray. - The scenes on the
Left (E) Tower plunge us into
the battle; the king in his chariot
dashes against his foes who have
surrounded him, and launches his
arrows against them. The field is
strewn with the dead and wounded,
while the Hittites flee in wild con-
fusion to the fortress of Kadesh,
whence fresh troops issue. Farther
to the left Kadesh, girt with water,
appears, with the defenders on the
