adorned with plants, from which hang rings and skins. Behind
these are two fettered negroes, after whom come negroes with offer-.
ings (monkeys, greyhounds, a panther, a giraffe, cattle, an ostrich)
and women with their children (one carrying her children in a basket
held on her back by a strap round her forehead). One of the oxen
has horns represented as arms, between which is the head of a negro
suing for mercy. In the upper row we see the above-mentioned tablet
placed before theking, while the governor ofEthiopia is being adorned
with gold chains of honour; farther on are rings of gold, chairs, ele-
phants' tusks, bows, shields, panther-skins, ebony, fans, and other
articles brought as tribute; negroes approach with their offerings
(cattle, antelopes, a lion, ete.). - In the second relief the king and
his sons appear in chariots dashing against the negro foe. The ne-
groes flee to their village, which lies among dilrn-palms. A wounded
negro is led by two comrades to his wife and children, while another
woman ("touches over a tire and cooks a meal.

The reliefs on the right wall refer to the wars against the Syrians
and Libyans. In the first scene (beginning to the right) the Pharaoh
stands upon two prostrate enemies, grasping three others (Syrians)
by the hair, while a prince leads fettered prisoners before him. -
In the second relief the king appears before a Syrian fortress; on
the battlements are men and women suing for mercy (notice the
woman holding her rhihl by the arm); the king seizes one of the
enemy (who holds a broken took) by the hair to kill him; below,
one of the royal princes is beating in the doors with an axe.... - The
third relief shows the king in his chariot, dashing against the Meiug
Syrians; he kills two of the foes, while two others are bound to his
chariot. .- In the next scene the king smites a Libyan, while his dog
seizes the foe. - In the lifth relief we see King Ramses II. euthroned
beneath a nanOpy, with his lion at his feet. His son Amen-her-wmmf
leads Syrian prisoners to him.

Three doors lead from the vestibule into the HYPOSTYLE HALL,
which was hewn in the rock. The veiling of the hall is borne by
two'proto-Dork columns (p. clvii), earh with four plain sides on
which are inscriptions. The mural reliefs are well executed, but
their subjects are of no special interest. They represent the king
before the gods and (on each side of the side-doors) smiting his
enemies (a. Syrian and an Ethiopian). - The SANCTUARY has
similar reliefs. By the rear wall are three statues of the gods, now _
defaced beyond recognition. Both these roelr-ehambers also were I
used as Christian churches.
