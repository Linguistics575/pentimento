Adjacent is -

"No. tre, the Tomb of Nefret-ere Mi-en-Mut, wife ofRamses IL,
the arrangement of which differs from that of' the other tombs of
the queens. Its beautiful pivtures take the form ofthe finest painted
stueeo reliefs, which have, however, suffered in places from the in-
filtration of water; the portraits of the queen deserve particular
attention. The ceiling is adorned with the stars of the firmament.

A stair leads down to the First Room (Pl. 1), along the left It'allenf
which runs a bench for the reception of sacrificial gifts, crowned with
a concave cornice. The inscriptions comist of religious texts from the
17th chapter of the Book of the Dead. The aceoutpauying, pictures
represent the queen, seated under a canopy, playing draughts; the soul
of the queen, represented as a bird with
at human head; the queen, kneeling, wor-
ships the sun borne by two lions; the
god Thout as an ihis; the mummy on
the funeral couch; various divinities.

Isis and Nephthys: the queen. worshipping the sacred bull and seven sacred
cows; the queen before Atum and (farther on) before Osiris; the queen
offering writing-materials to Thout and saerifieing to Ptah. - On the
side-walls of the Staircase (Pl. 3) leading from Room 1 we see above, [ to
the right and left, the queen in presence of various divinities; below are
Isis and Nephthys kneeling and mourning. 0n the architrave ofthe door,
the goddess of truth with outstretched wings. - We now enter the Pillared
Hall (Pl.4), containing the coffin of the queen, who is represented on the
