puted possession of the Arabs and the base for their naval
campaigns against Byzantium and for their conquest of
N. Africa.

Civil war between Caliph'Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed,
and Mikwia, the founder of the dynasty of the Omai-
yades. Egypt belonged at first to'Ali, but after 658 to
the Omaiyades.

Omaiyades. 658-750.

This illustrious Arabian dynasty had its residence in Da-
mascus. Arabian tribes were settledein the Nile valley
and the system ofgovernment was based on Arabiangnodels.
Many Copts embraced Islam. Egypt was ruled by gover-
nors, who were often princes ot' the house of the ealiphs.

Merwan IL, the last of this dynasty, fled to Egypt, and was
put to death there. His tomb is atAhusir el-Melee o. 206).
The Omaiyades were then exterminated, with the excep-
tion of'Abd er-ltalunin, who fled to Spain, and founded
an independent caliphate at Cordova.

Abbasides. 750-868.

The new dynasty, which had risen to power on Iranian soil
and with Persian assistance, transferred the royaliresi-
dence and seat ofgovernment from Syria to the'lrili. Bagh-

l dad was founded and the ealipha'te reached its zenith.

t'Egypt was ruled by frequently changing governors.: The

t Copts were oppressed and frequent revolts occurred.

'Ma'miin, the son of 1Itrtm er-Rashid, visited Egypt and
quelled the resistance of the Copts and the Beduin itribes
that had settled in Egypt. The fusion between Lthe'Arabs
and the Copts began and Arabic became the language of
the fellahin.

Under Ma'mtn's successors the power of the caliphs began
to decline; the government became dependent upon Turk-
ish Mamelukes, and the provinces regained their inde-
pendence.



Tulunides. 868-905.

Egypt became again for a short time independent.

Ahmed ibn p1Itin, governor of Egypt, declared himself an
independent sultan, and extended the boundaries of
Egypt beyond Syria and as far as Mesopotamia. Numerous
buildings were erected during his reign (pp. "'li, et seq.)

Rhumkraweih o. 44). The latter and his suecessors were

I unable to preserve their independence.
