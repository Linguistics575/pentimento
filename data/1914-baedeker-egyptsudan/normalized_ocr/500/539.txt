two eolossal statues of Thutmosis IH.; in front of the easternmost
of these stands the lower part of a large obelisk of Thutmosis Ill.

The East Tower in front of the N. fagade is adorned with a figure of
Osiris (0n the front of which is an inscription of Ramses II. added at tt
later date) and a colossal statue of Thutmosis lil. On the West Tower are
(enumerated from left to right) a colossal statue of Thutmesis III. with
the double crown, an Osiris figure of the same (its head on the ground
before it), a seated figure of a king of the Middle Empire, a seated flgure
of Sehek-l1otep, a statue of Amenophis Ir, and the left half of a memorial
inscription of Haremheb.

Beside Pylon VII is a modern door, by which visitors usually
quit the temple-precincts (comp. p. 26-1) in order to inspect the re-
liefs on the S. exterior walls of the great hypostyle hail (p. 272).

Beside the easternmost of the two walls which unite Pylon VII
with Pylon VIII lies (to the left) a small ruined Chapel dating from
the reign of Thutmosis III. (in peripteral form; p. clxiii). Farther on,
on the same wall, is a representation (Phe) of Ramses II. sacrificing.

Pylon VIII is in comparatively good preservation, although it
was built by Queen IIatshepsut and is thus the most ancient part
of the entire building. Hatshepsut's names were removed from the
reliefs by Thutmosis II. Sethos I. restored the reliefs which Amen-
ophis IV. (p. 255) had destroyed; but in many cases he inserted his

own name instead of replacing those of the ancient kings.

into the temple by the lion-headed goddess Wert-hekew, followed by
Hathor; behind the king are priests carrying the sacred boat of Amen;

in front of this king refers to the accessiOn of Hatshepsut. - Right Tower

the right). Thntmosis 11. (originally Hatshepsut) before Amen and Khons;
behind the king are the goddess Wert-hekew and Thout, the latter writing
upon a palm-branch; beneath fin two rows), Ramses III. before various
gods. - On the Jambs of the Central Doorway are inscriptions of Thutmnsis II.
(originally IIatshepsut) and Thutmoais III.

On each side in the GATEWAY is Ramses 11. before various deities.

S. SIDE. Left Tower (Hi). AmenOphis II. seizing fettered enemies by the
hair and smiting them with his club; before him is Amon (inserted later
by Hethns 1.). Right Tower (E.). A similar scene. - On the Door Jumbs
are inseriptitms of Thutmosis Tr. (left; originally IIatshepsut) and Thin-
inosis IH. (right). - Leaning against the right door-post is a red granite
stele, unfortunately much damaged, recording the Asiatic campaigns of
Amenophis II. - 0n the E. side of the right tower are reliefs and in-
seriptinns "high-priests of Amon in the reign of Sethos ll.

Four colossal seated ilg, mrcs ofki ngs were originally placed before
the S. side of this pylon, the best-preserved of Which is that of
AmenoPhis I. (to the W.; of limestone). The two figures of Thnt-
mosis II. retain their lower part only; the one to the W.is of reddish-
brown silieious sandstone and bears an inscription on the back record-
ing that Thntmosis Ill. restored it in the d2nd year of his reign.

The following Pylon IX, built by King Haremheb, partly with
the remains of a temple of Amenophis IV., has collapsed.
