of Horus. EDFU. 22. Route. 347

The sanctuary is surrounded by a CORRIDOR from which ten small
SIDE CHAMBERS (Pl. r-x) open. These, used for various religious rites and
for store-rooms, are adorned with reliefs and are faintly lighted by holes
in the roof. In the flooring of each of the corner-rooms (P1. 111 and VIII)
is the entrance to a crypt, formerly closed by a stone slab.

We return to the hypostyle hall and pass through Room xxx
to the Inner Passage between the exterior of the temple proper
and the interior of the girdle-wall. On the outside of the temple
walls are lions' heads as water-spouts and four rows of religious
reliefs. At the foot of the wall appear the king, the queen, and
a procession of local deities approaching the three chief gods of
Edfu. On the inner side of the E. girdle-wail (Pl. hh) the king ap-
pears before the various gods of Edfu; on the N. wall (P1. 99) are
similar scenes and long hymns to the god of Edfu. On the W.

l.. a
wall (PI. mm) are more important reliefs representing the contests
of the god Horus with his enemies, who are depicted as crocodiles
and hippopotami.

The chief are the following: Ist Scene (below, to the right). The king,
standing 0n shore, attempts to transfix a hippopotamuss which bends its
head aside. Horus Mes the same; in his left hand he holds a chain, and
in his right a javelin; beside him is his mother Isis, and behind, at the
helm, is a small Horus. - 2nd Scene. The king appears on land (to the left),
before two ships, in each of which are a Horus and an assistant. Horus
holds the hippopotamus with a chain and pierces its head with a javelin. -
5th Scene. The hippopotamus lies on its back, with a chain fastened to
its hind-feet. - 7th Scene. Horus, in a ship with expanded sail, aims a
blow at the head of a hippopotamus, the hind-foot of which is caught in
a. line held in the god's left hand. Isis kneeling in the bow of the boat
holds the head of the animal by a cord. The king, standing on the bank
with two attendants, seeks to pierce the skull of the hippopotamus. -
Farther to the left (opposite the pylon): The king, the ram-headed Khuum,
the falcon-headed Horus, and the ibis-hcaded Thout are dragging a net,
in which are not only water-fowl, fishes, and a stag, but also two Asiatics
and some negroes, the ancestral foes of Egypt.

A subterranean staircase leads from the E. part of the passage
round the temple to an ancient Gilometer, a round well situated
outside the temple, and encircled by a spiral staircase which was
formerly also reached from without. On the walls.of the latter is the
scale, with demotic numbers. The subterranean communication with
the river has been interrupted.

Finally, an *ASCENT TO THE T01- OF THE PYLON is recommended.
The doors on the S. side of the Court (to the right and left of PI. a
and b) lead into dark chambers, from each of which an easy staircase
of 242 steps in 14 flights ascends to the platforms of the towers.
Doors on the landings of the staircase admit to small chambers,
constructed in the solid masonry and lighted, like the staircases, by
means of small window-openings [ see pp. 344, Mii). The stair-
cases in the two towers are connected with each other by a pass-
age running above the central portal; and in each tower there is a
door affording access to the roof of the colonnade in the court. On
the roof of the W. colonnade are the workmen's drawings for the
concave cornice of the pylon. The view from the top is unusually
