by the Mohammedans the temples of the'great town' of Akhmim were,
as Abtltidii (1273- 1331) and other Arabs relate, among the most important
remains of the days of the Pharaohs. But the ruins of these temples are
now very scanty.

In 188-1 an extensive Neev0polit was discovered among the low hills
about 3 M. to the N .E. of Akhmim. The route thither leads via (21/4 N.)
El- Wtodurish, in a hill beyond which are numerous tombs of the NewEmpire
mingled with some of the Ancient Elmpire. To the N. and w. is a Christian
cemetery, of the 5- 15th cent., andi 1n the vicinity is a Coptic cement. The
tombs to the N., Which are the oldest, date from the Poman, Ptplemaie, and
Egyptian pe1iods. Farther up the mountain are tombs of the 6th Dynasty.
- To the S. of Akhmim is a rock- chapel constructed under King Eye

tiSih Dyn.).

The railway crosses the 8soht1gtyeh Canal, Which joins the Ibrt-

200 M. El-Menshiyeh or Et-Minsk (El-Memo, Jfenchah) is
merely a peasants' town, with 10,810 inhab. and very few houses
of a better class. It occupies the site of Ptolemafs Hermiou, a
town founded by Ptolemy Soter I. and described by Strabo as'the
largest town in the Thebaid and not inferior in size to Memphis,
with a constitution drawn up in the Hellenic manner'. Its Egyp-

tian name was Psdi.

About 71/2 M. to the W. of El- -Menshiyeh, near the village of Kawdnn'l,
are large cemeteries of the earliest period.

312 M. Girgeh (Girga, Guerga) is a district-eapital with 10,803
inhab., of whom 54-13 are Copts. A large weekly market is held 011
Tuesday. Many of the houses are built of burnt brick and decorated
with glazed tiles. Outside the town lies a convent of the United
Cepts, which is probably the oldest but one in Egypt.

About 31/2 M. to the w. of Girgeh, near Beit Ehatldf, is a large
brick mastaba of the time of King Zoser (31-11 Dyn.), excavated by Prof.
Garstang. - The village of Et-Birba, 31/2 M. to the N. of Girgeh, per-
haps occupies the site of This (Egypt. Tine), the capital of the first two
dynasties (p. xcix) and of a Itome ot the same name.

Upon the E. bank opposite Girgeh, near Nag ed- Deir, lie several cem-
eteries, some of them of the prehistoric period, which have been excavated
by Dr. Reisner at the cost of the University of California (comp. p. 98). -
Farther to the s. is the old Coptic convent of Deir el- Meldk, the large ceme-
ten of which is still used by the Christian inhabitants of Girgeh. The
Arabian mountains, which approach close to the river beyond the village,
eontainnumevoustdmbs, four ofwhich, ataeonsiderable elevation, belonged
to grandees of the ancient This (see above). Their inscriptions and repre-
sentations are now scarcely visible. - At Mesheikh, about 3 N. farther to
the s.. are remains of a temple built by Ilamses II. and restored by Ame-
nephthes. Mesheikh is a village of the Aultid Yehyat, on the site of the
ancient Lepidotonpolis. Above the village are some ancient ruck-tombs,
the chief of which belonged to linher-mose, a high-priest of This in the
reign of Amenephthes (19th Dyn.).
