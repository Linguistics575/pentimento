334 Route 21. EL-KO. From Luxor

The "Rams OF THE ANCIENT TOWN OF NEKHAB, which are sur-
rounded by a massive girdle-wall of sun-dried bricks, lie near the
river. The wall, which probably dates from the Middle Empire, is
damaged only on the S.W., by the Nile. It is of immense thickness
(37 ft.) and encloses a rectangle, 620 yds. long by 590 yds. broad,
with gates on the E., N., and S. sides, beside which broad ascents
lead to the top of the wall. The N. wall intersects a necropolis of
the Ancient Empire, excavated by Quibell in 1897. The city itself,
enclosed by another double wall, of which distinct traces are still
to be seen, occupied only about one-fourth of the space within the
girdhr-wall. Very scanty ruins 110w remain of the temple, built
during the 18th Dyn. on the site of an earlier sanctuary and en-
larged by Nektauebos and others.

Visitors should not omit to ascend to the top of the N. wall, for the
sake of the admirable view: to the E., at the head of a desert-valley,
appear the isolated rock with the inscriptions, the temple OfAmenophis m.,
and, a little nearer, the chapel of Ramses II. (comp. below); to the N. is
the hill with the rock-tombs, and a little farther away is a mushroom-
shaped rock, with the quarries that yielded the stone for the city temple.

We follow the route leading due E. from the E. gateway in the
girdle-wall and cross the dazzlingly white sand, past a small ruined
Sandstone Chapel (no inscriptions) close to the wall. In rather more
than 1/2 hr. we reach a Chapel ofRamses 11., known to the Arabs as
El-/fammdtn, Lee.'the bath".

This temple was built in the reign of Ramses 11. by Setaw, governor
of Ethiopia, represented in the entrance-doorway and on the interior walls
on each side of the entrance. Other reliefs show Ramses II. sacrificing
to Thout and Horus. On the upper part of the rear wall (right) are cyno-
cephali, sacred to Thout; below are praying men.

We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple of the Ptolemies
on the left, and soon reach two Rocks projecting from the plain, at
the point where the road turns N. towards the desert, halfway be-
tween El-lJarnrmhn and the E. temple of Amenophis m. Both
rocks bear numerous inscriptions and figures of animals. Most of
these date from the (ith Dyn. and were probably placed here by
priests of E'l-h'ltb.

The charming small temple or *CHAPEL 0F AMENOPHIS III. lies
fully 1/4hr. to the E. It may be reached direct in about an hour
from the Nile. The little temple, which is about 50 ft. deep, was
dedicated to Nekhbeyet,'mistress of Ile-yant' (Le. of the entrance to
the desert-valley). It consists of a ruined Vestibule of the Ptolemaic
period, with papyrus-columns (the capitals of which strew the
ground), and of a Chamber the roof of which was' borne by four six-
teen-sided columns embellished with heads of Hathor. The names
of the king, Amon, and Nekhbeyet, and several representations
of the gods were defaced under Ameuophis IV. and restored under

Sethos I. Many of them were again renewed in the Ptolemaie period.

On the Entrance Door of the chamber are a votive inscription and a
representation of Amenophis III. The exterior walls bear only a few in-
scriptions and representations (ships) which were added at a later date;
