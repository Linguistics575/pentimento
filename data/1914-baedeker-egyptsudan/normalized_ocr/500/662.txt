380 Route 26. KIIARGEII. Western Oates.

There are two trains weekly in each direction in 9-91/2h1's.: from Khar-
geh Junction on Tues. a Frid., returning from El-Khirgeh on Mon. & Thurs.
(ist el. fare to Headquarters 78 Pitts.). The evening express train from
Cairo cennects at Khargeh Junetion with the oasis train (from Cairo to the
junction, 3341/2 M., fares 173, 861/2 pias.). Previous notice should be given,
as the rest- house at Headquarters) "often overcrowded. - Those who reach
the junction at other times (e. tr. coming from Luxor) proceed by a trolley,
which must be ordered in advance, to El- Kara (see below) and spend
the night there.

Diverging from the Cairo and Luxor line at Khargeh Junction or
Oasis Junction (Muaslet el-Khargeh; p. 222), the Oases Railway runs
to the W., at first through cultivated land but afterwards ascending
towards the desert, to (3W, M.) El-Kcim (0ara; good nightquarters
and entertainment in the railway rest-house, 4 beds, pens. 70 pies).
A halt for breakfast is made here. The line follows the edge of
the cultivated land a little farther, then strikes off into the desert,
gradually ascending through a valley narrowing as we ascend and
flanked by picturesque rocks. At 25 M. the plateau is reached, and
a boundless sea of gravelly desert extends 011 every hand, giving
place farther 011 to a rocky waste. After 90 M. the railway begins
to descend through a rocky valley of peculiar beauty. It then crosses
a wide plain and at (106 M.) Mehertii (Mahariq), where the first
vegetation appears, reaches the level of the oasis. - 112 M. Head-
quarters (Markus esh-Sharikeh), with a good rest-house (8 It., pens.
70 pias.), is the seat of the Corporation of Western Egypt (see
below). The Gehel Ghenneima (p. 382) is seen in the distance, about
51/2 M. to the E. - Near (119 M.) Nadara are the most important
ruins of antiquity (see p. 381). - 122 M. Khargch (Kharga), or
El- KMrgeh (190 ft.), with 5362 inhab., tine palms, and two
mosques, ig the chief town in the oasis. The government building
(markaz) and the post -offiee are situated in the principal square.
Part of the town is a labyrinth of narrow dark lanes, roofed over
with pahn-truhks or palm- -brauches dauhed with mud.

Donkeys (12 pias. per day) and Camels (20 pias; per half-day i2 pias.)
may be hired at Headquarters. Tr alleys running on the railway line, cost
for the journey from Headquarters to El- -Khargeh and back 15 pies. when
drawn by mules or 25 pias. when pushed by men.

The Oasis of Khargeh, the'Southern Oasis' of the ancient Egyp-
tians, the'Great Oasis' of the Greeks, forms a district of the pro-
vince of Assitot.. It is about 185 M. long and 20- 50 M. broad, and
is situated in N. lat. 25026' and E. long. 30033'. The population
numbers 8383. Like all the oases Rhtrgeh is surrounded by a toler-
ably steep chain of cretaceous limestone hills, which rises in terraces
to the height ofbiiOft. on the side next the desert. Thanks to numer-
ous springs issuing freely from clefts in the cretaceous marl, the oasis
was extremely fertile in antiquity and contained many towns and
settlements, whose ruins exist to this day. Even in ancient times
Kh√©rgeh was connected by a caravan-road with Abydos (p. 237).
In the middle ages, however, its prosperity waned. At the present
time an effort is being made by the Corporation of Western Egypt,
