(see p. 80), Mst rose into notice by his 11131.0101-3' ofthe Apis Tombs

(brought from Cairo) on the terrace. A fee of 21/13 pies. 01111010, ae-
cording to the number of the party, is given to the keepers in charge
of the house, who supply coffee prepared in the Arab style. From
this point paths lead to the various points of interest.'

A few hundred yards to the W. of Marictte's House lies the
Egyptian **Serapeum, or subterranean Tombs of Apis, hewn in
the rock.

Apis (p. cxli), the sacred bull of the god Ptah (p.143), which was wer-
shipped in a special temple at Memphis, was after death embalmed like a
human being and interred with great pomp in the neevopolis of Memphis.
As early as the reign of Amenophis IU.., and probably still earlier, the Apis
111111113 consisted of a subterranean toPtye.har, nuer, reached by a sloping
shaft, over which a chapel was erected in honour of the bul1.Under
Iamses II. a large common grave was prepared for the Apis hulls by
Prince Khamu eset-, a subterranean gallery, over 100 yds.in length, W115:
hewn in the rock and flanked with chombers, whieh wore walled 11p after
receiving the wooden eoffin containing the sacred remains. Psauunetiehos I,

to the first one. These vaults, which were added to at intervals down to
the Ptolemaie period., were much larger and more carefully eonstrueted
than the previous series. They have au aggregate length of about 380 yds.
and are about 10 ft. in width and 171/: n. in height. Above them rose
"large temple for the cult of the dead god. - The ancient Egyptians
believed that like man (p. cxlviii) the deceased bull was united with Osiris,
and became the'Osiris- Apia" (Egypt. Oser-lutpet Gr.0sorapis). lie thus
became a kind ot god of the dead and was called, like Osiris,'Lord of
the western land'; pilgrims crowded to the tomb to pay their devotions
and to present votive offerings. The last were usually small memorial
tablets, which were inserted in the walls of the subterranean galleries.
The worship of the foreign god Serapis or Sarapr's, introduced under
Ptolemy L, rapidly spread in "id, gypt, and it is easy to understand how
the new Smapis was confounded with Osarapis aml worshipped along with
the latter in the ancient temple in the ueeropolis of Memphis. The temple
itself came to he commonly known as the Sarapeion "Serapeum.

stone walls, where many tombstones of deceased bulls and votive
tablets (see above) were found. Visitors light their candles here.
