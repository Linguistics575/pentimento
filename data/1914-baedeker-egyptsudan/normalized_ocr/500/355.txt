Circuit. PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH. 6. Route. 137

Between the Valley Temple and the Sphinx is a series of brick
walls, of the Ptolemaic or the Roman period, intended to protect the
Sphinx from the shifting sand.

The tombs surrounding the different pyramids, where the rela-
tives and tytate-off1eials of the kings and also the priests and offleia1s
of the various mortuary temples of the necropolis were interred, are
far inferior in interest to the tombs that have been excavated and
rendered accessible at Salrlrira o. 149). Yet the manner in which
they are laid out in streets and lanes, especially in the area to the
W. of the Great Pyramid (recently excavated by German, Austrian,
and American explorers), affords the best extant picture of an Egyp-
tian necropolis. The so-called Tomb of Numbers (p. 139) and
Campbell's Tomb (p. 138) are usually visited also.

Travellers who are not pressed for time and who desire to ob-
tain a closer view of the Second and Third Pyramids are recom-
mended to make the following *Circuit of the Pyramid Plateau
(comp. p. 123).

After having inspected the Great Pyramid (p. 127), we turn
(following the dotted line on the Plan, p. t23) to the left (W.) of
the entrance and descend as far as the N.W. angle of the Pyramid,
where the levelled space on the ground (b on the Plan), intended
for the reception of the eorner-stone, has been exposed to view.
Towards the W. and S.W. lie numerous ma1staba--tornbs presenting
an impressive appearance.

Those, however, who are not deterred by difficulty will find the tomb
(5th Dyn.) of 8hepteekef-tmekh and his son Imeri, almost due N. of the
Second Pyramid, the least inconvenient. This tomb, called by the Beduins
Turba Larsitss (Le. Lepsius's Tomb), is half- buried in sand, and visitors
have to crawl through the low entrance in order to reach the long
vaulted corridor, which is covered with reliefs and inscriptions. - The
beautiful tomb of Kefer-bev-Ptah (Pl. c), a. grandson of Shepses-kef-onekh,
lies to the left (8.), but is unfortunately quite buried.

We now skirt the N. and W. sides of the vast necropolis, and
reach the N.W. angle of the rocky enclosure of the court of the
Second Pyramid. A natural cleft in the rock CPI. d) here facilitates
our descent from the top of the rock, which is over 16 ft. in height.
At the foot of' it we reach the levelled plateau prepared for this
pyramid (p. 131). On the surface are a number of regularly arranged
square incisions, separated from each other by furrows about 2 ft.
wide. These date from the quarrying operations (comp. p. 356)
carried on here during the building of the pyramid.

On the rock above is an inscription in honour othei', chief architect
in the temple called'Ramses li. shines in the Great House of the Prince'
(Le. Heliopolis) and son of Bek-en-Amun, chiefarchitect of Thebes. In the
reign ofRamses 11. Mei systematically demolished the temple of Khephren
or part of the facing of the pyramid to obtain materials for building a
temple at Bts1iopo1is.

0n the E. side of the Pyramid are remains of the mortuary temple
