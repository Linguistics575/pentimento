windings of the Nile. During the Mahdist insurrection Korosko was
of considerable strategical importance and was held by a strong
garrison; now, however, the forts and barracks are deserted and
many houses are in ruins. In the valley behind the town is a
British cemetery with the graves of British soldiers. - The tra-
veller may ascend (3,4-1 hr.; steep and stony) the hill of Awas

The E. bank of the Nile between Korosko (p. 398) and Armenna
(p. 403) is the most fertile portion of Nubia. The belt of cultivable
land along the river is enmparatively broad; and it is irrigated by
means of water-wheels Csilsiyeh) of curious construction, worked by
oxen. - Beyond Kerosko the Nile valley trends to the N., so that
the N. wind which prevails in winter frequently retards the sailing-
boats. On the Fl. bank is (3 M.) Alia [ landul (steamboat station ].
On the W. bank lies the district of Areilea (El-ltiqu), in which, near
lil.-G'estreh, is a ruined fortress of the time of Thutmosis HI. About

Temple of'Amada, which dates from the 18th Dyn. and was
dedicated to RÃ©-Harakhte, the sun-god. It was erected under
1hutmosis III. and Amenophis IL and was extended under Thut-
mosis IV. The figures of Amon, which were defaced by Amen-
ophis IV., were restored by Sethos I. In Christian times the temple
was used as a church and the reliefs were covered with whitewash,
which has had the effect of preserving the original colouring, as we
see now that the whitewash has peeled off.

We enter by a stone PORTAL, which was originally flanked by
pylon towers of brick. On the right side of the doorway appears
Thntmo~is 111., to the left Amenophis H., in the presence of 126-
liarakhte. On the inside of the doorway, to the left, is an inscription
referring to a campaign of Amenephthes (p. ciii) against the Ethi-
opians; farther en appears the praying figure of Setaw, who was
governor of Ethiopia under Ramses 1I.--iotl the pylon extended
originally a court enclosed by brick walls, while at the back stood a
colonnadc with four proto-Dario (p.clvii) columns. This court was
