civ IV. ANCIENT HISTORY.

Ramses IV.-Ra.mses XII. gradually fell more and more under the
control of the priests of Amon. Their tombs are at Bihin el-
Muhik (pp. 285 et seq.).

6. Period of Foreign Domination (1090-663 B.C.).
XXI. DYNASTY (TANITES; 1090 N6 B.00.
Herihor, high-priest of Amon, occupied the throne for a short time
after the death of Ramses XII.

The empire 110w fell to pieces. At Tanis a new dynasty arose
(Psusennea, Amcnemopet), which contested the rule of the high-priests
at Thebes. Pinotem 1., a 1'heban priest-king, became king of all
Egypt through marriage alliances with the Tanite dynasty, while his
sons obtained the influential and lucrative dignity of high-priests
of Thebes. Nubia recovered its independence; and the Egyptian
dominion in Palestine terminated.

XXII. DYNASTY (9-15-7115 B.C.).

The kings of this dynasty were of Libyan origin. Their ancestors,
like the Mamelukes of later days, had come to Egypt as the leaders
of mercenary troops. Settling in the ll. Delta, they grew in power
as that of the monarchy declined. The royal residence under this
dynasty was Bubastis (p. 171); Thebes steadily declined in import-
ance. Royal princes assumed the office of high-priests of Amon.

Shoshenk L (Sesonchis; the Shishak of the Bible) overthrew the Tan-
ites. In the 5th year of Rehoboam of Judah he captured Jerusa-
lem and plundered the Temple of Solomon (ca. 930 13.0.). For
his monument of victory, see p. 272.

Under his successors (Osorkon, Takclothis, Shoshenk, etc.) the
thr01fe once more lost power, and the country was subdivided into
small independent principalities. Among these are reckoned the
members of the -

who reigned in Tanis, but of whom we know little. The
kings ofEthiopia, whose capital was Napata (p.419), made
themselves masters of Upper Egypt,

B.C. 730. Tefnakhte, Prince of Sais and Memphis, attempted to seize
the sovereignty of Lower Egypt, but was defeated by
Piankhi, King of Ethiopia, who captured Memphis. (For
Piankhi's monument of victory, see p. 88.)

"XXIV. DYNASTY.

Boeehoris (Bekenran/y, son and successor of Tefnakhte, se-
cured the sovereignty of Lower Egypt, while Upper Egypt
remained subject to the Ethiopians. Sabakon of Ethiopia,
son of Kashta, overthrew Boeehoris and burned him to
death. All Egypt fell into the hands of the Ethiopians.
