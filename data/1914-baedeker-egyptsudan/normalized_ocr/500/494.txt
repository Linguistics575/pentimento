248 Route 19. DENDERA. Temple

We return to the second anteehamber in order to visit thence
the innermost part of the temple,'the hidden secret chambers', as
they are called in the inscriptions.

The central door leads to the profoundly dark Sanctuary,'the
great seat', in which the sacred boats with the images of the gods
formerly stood. The king alone, or his sacerdotal representative,
might enter this sacred precinct and in solitude commune with
the deity. Only Once a year was this permitted even to him, at the
great festival of the new year. The reliefs on the walls depict the
rites which the king had to perform on entering the sanctuary, and

the saerifiees which he had to offer.

There are three rows of BELIEFS, but Only the lowest can be distinctly
seen even with the aid _uf an electric or a magnesium lamp. The reliets
are so arranged that each scene on the Left Wall (Pl. k), beginning at
the entrance, is followed in historical sequence by the corresponding scene
on the Right Wall (Pl. l). 1 (left) The king ascends the steps to the shrine
of the gods; 2 (right) removes the band fastening the door; 3 (1.) breaks
the seal on the door; 4 (r.) opens the door; 5 (1.) gazes upon the god-
dess; 6 (r.) prays to her with his arms hanging down; 7 (1.) offers incense
before the sacred heats of Hathor and Horus of Edfu; and cr, r.) before
the boats of Hathor and Har-sem-tewe. - Rear Wall (Pl. m). To the left,
the king, before whom is the youthful son of Hathor with sistrum and
rattle, presents an image of the goddess Maat to llathor and Horus of
Edfu; to the left, the same ceremony before Hathor aud Har-sem-tewe.

The Sanctuary is surrounded by a CORRIDOR, lighted by aper-
tures in the side-walls and in the ceiling, and entered from the
second anteehamber by means of two side-doors. Opening off this
corridor are 11 SMALL CHAMBERS (P1. I-XI), which were used as
chapels dedicated to various deities, as store-rooms, and for different
religious purposes. Room I, which is embellished with reliefs like
those in the Sanctuary, contained a shrine with an image of Hathor.
A modern iron staircase in this room leads to a small Niche in the S.

wall, containing a relief of Hathor.

Before ascending to the roof of the temple, we should visit the
subterranean chambers, or Crypts, in which were preserved such
satyrifleial vessels and images of the gods as were no longer in uSe.
They claim attention not only for their remarkable construction but
also for the fresh tints of their paintings. The temple contains no
fewer than 12 crypts, constructed in the thickness of the temple
walls in different stories and entered by narrow flights of steps or by
openings concealed by movable stone slabs. Their elaborate mural
reliefs date from the reign of Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysos, and are
therefore the oldest as well as the best executed decorations in the
temple. The custodian will open, on request, the locked crypts
(Nos. 4 and 7), both of which are worth a visit (magnesium wire or
a lamp desirable). Comp. the accompanying Plans.

In Crypt Na. 4, which we enter through a square opening in the payed
ment, are several narrow chambers, on the walls of which are depicted
the objects that used to be preserved here. The colouring of the admirably

executed reliefs is remarkably fresh. On the right wall of the second
room to the right is an interesting relief of Ring Phiops (6th Dyn.) kneel
