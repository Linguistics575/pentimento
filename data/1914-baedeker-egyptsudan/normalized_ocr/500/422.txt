Situation and History of the Faiyiim. 1n the great plateau of the
Libyan Desert, which rises 300-400 ft. above the sea-level, is situated the
province of the FAIYfIM (from the ancient Egyptian'Phiom', i.e. the lake),
the first of the oases, which is usually considered to belong to the valley
of the Nile, and is justly celebrated for its extraordinary fertility. This
tract is in the form of an oval basin and is enclosed by the Libyan hills,
which are here of moderate height, and lies about three-iifths of a degree
to the S. of Cairo. It enjoys a remarkably fine climate. Even at the period
of the Ptolemies and the Romans the products of the Faiytirn were much ex-
tolled.'The Arsinoi'te Nome', says Strabo, Hs the most remarkable of all,
both on account of its scenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it
alone is planted with large and richly productive olive-trees, and the oil is
good when the olives are carefully gathered; those who are negleetNI may
indeed obtain oil in abundance, but it has a bad smell. In the rest of
Egypt the olive-tree is never seem, except in the gardens of Alexandria,
where under favourable circumstances it yields olives but no oil. Vines,
corn, podded plants, and many other products also thrive in this district
in no small abundance.' The Baiytm is entirely indebted for its fertility
to the Balzr Yasuf ('0anal of Joseph'), which diverges from the Ibrahi-
miyeh Canal at Deirit (see p. 231), and flows at I11ahtln (p. 194) through a
narrow opening in the Libyan chain into the Faiyiim, where it divides
into numerous ramifications, abundantly watering the whole district. At
the point where the Baht Yiisuf enters the Faiythn the district forms a
plateau of moderate height, descending towards the W. in two gradations
towards the Birket Fartin (p. 196). Method of irrigation, seep. lxvi.

1n antiquity the Faiyiim was known as Te-shc or'lake-land' (Gr. Limni,
lake), from the great inland lake frequently mentioned and described by
Greek travellers and geographers under the name ofLake Moerit (from Egypt.
me (1-) -wér, mwér, great lake), of which the last trace must be recognized in
the present Birketlrariltt (p.196). At the most remote period the lake occupied
almost the entire basin of the Faiytirn, but within thehistorical period its
circumference seems to have been about 140 M. (though Herodotus says 3600
stadia, i.e. M5 M.) and its area about 770 sq. M. According to recent caI-
culations it lay 73 ft. above the level of the Mediterranean, whereas the
