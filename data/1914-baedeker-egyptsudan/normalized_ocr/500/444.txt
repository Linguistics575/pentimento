206 Route lg. BENISUEIF. From Cairo

ebrity from St. Anthony, who fixed his hermitage in the mountains to the
E. of the town, beside a well and a group of palms. So many pilgrims
of every class, age, and sex sought out the holy man, that a regular post-
ing route, with relays of camels, was laid out across the desert. St. An-
thony, however, fled from his admirers and buried himself deeper in the
mountains. But while he thus shook off his earthly visitants, he could
not so easily escape those extraordinary tempters from spirit-land, at which
Callot has taught us to smile, though to St. Anthony himself, as well as
to St. Hilarion and other anchorites, the contest was one of bitter earnest.

57 M. EI-Wasta (p. 225; short halt). Passengers bound for
the Faipthn change carriages here (p. 191). El-Wasta, a district-
capital with 2644inhab., is pleasantly situated in a grove of palms
and is surrounded with fields of clover. To the right is the great
barrage of Iprsheisheh. - 63 M. Beni Hodeir. - Near (67 M.) Ashment
(Achemant), to the right, appears the small black pyramid of Illalnin
(p. 195). The Arabian hills rise on the left.

About 3 hrs. to the N.W. of Ashment is the village of Abusir el-Meleh,
the'Northern Aby.dos' of the Egyptians, containing extensive ancient
cemeteries. In the vicinity is the tomb of Nerwiin II. (p. cxiv).

721/2 M. Bash (Bouche; p. 225), inhabited by Copts.

77 M. Benisueif or Beni Suef (Continental Hotel, kept by a
Greek, R. 10 pies, very fair, tolerable restaurant opposite) is a
town of 23,357 i11hab., pleasantly situated between the railway
and the river. It contains a post and telegraph offioe and is the
capital of a province, which contains 171 villages and 372,412 in-
habitants. To the left of the rail. station is the M1idir1Ayeh. The
linen-manufacture for Which this place was celebrated in the middle
ages has greatly declined, but several factories, numerous 611gar-
plantations, and a small bazaar still lend the town a certain im-
portance. To the left of the railway is a fine grove of palms.

On the right bank of the Barr Yttsuf, 10 M. to the W. of Benisueif,
lies the village of Ahndsia el-Jlledineh (vulgo, Ahndsia Umm el-Kimdn,
'rubbish-heaps of Ahnasia'), beside the mounds of debris, covering an
area of 1/2 sq. 131., which mark the site of the ancient 1Lsrae1eopolis.
The Egyptian name of the town was Henen-nesut, from which are derived
the Coptic Hares, and the Arabic Ahntis and Ahnasia. It was the capital
of a nome (the Graeco-Roman Heracleopolites) and the chief seat of the
worship of the ram-headed god Herishef, identified by the Greeks with
Heracles (whence the name of the town). The ichneumon also was re-
vered here. Among the chief shrines were a temple erected under the Middle
Empire and a new building by Ramses II., but all have practically van-
ished; four columns of a late period, probably dating from a Byzantine
church, are all that projects above the rubbish-heaps. The ancient necro-
polis lies on the W. side of the Bahr Yttszaf near Sedment el-Gebel.

A road beginning at the village of Bidd (Bidd ea-Nayira), on the
E. bank of the Nile, opposite Benisueif, leurs through the desert (36 hrs.
by camel) to the very ancient Convents of SS. Anthony and Paul (p.1iv),
situated about 25 N. from the Red Sea.

901/2 M. Bibeh (Bela), a district-capita1 (10,156 inhab.) with
large sugar-factories (comp. p. 225), is the junction of a secondary
line running parallel with the main line on the W. bank as Gr as
Magugha. At Bibeh is a Coptic convent with a tall bell-tower.
Our railway is skirted on the right by the Ibrthtmtyeh Canal.
