four tombs. To the S. is the *Tomb of Neferhotep (No. 50), a priest
who lived under King Haremheb (18th Dyn.). The first Large Room
contains some beautiful and well-preserved ceiling-paintings. On
the left end-wall we see the deceased being decorated with chains of
honour in the presence of the king. On the rear wall, to the left ot'
the door to the corridor, we see the deceased and his family, with
a son bringing food to them. Below this, to the left, is a harper,
with the text of the song he is singing in front of him. On the right
wall of the corridor, where the deceased and his wife are seen sit-
ting at the table of offerings, is a second copy of this song, which
encourages us to leave all cares behind and think of the joys of life.
In the recess are statues of the deceased and his family. - To the
