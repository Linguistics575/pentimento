The nationality of the various groups of students may be learned

from the guide.

No lectures are delivered on Thurs. or during the fasting month of
Ramadan. When teaching, the professor (sheikh) sits cross-legged on a
straw-mat or chair and reads from a hook placed on a desk (t-aleeh) before
him, explaining each sentence as he proceeds; or he directs one of the
more advanced students to read aloud, adding his own explanations from
time to time. The students sit in a circle around the teacher, listening or
attentively taking notes. As soon as a student knows by heart and can
explain the whole of the hook that is being studied by the class, the
sheikh makes an entry (Igdzeh, t.e. permission) in the student's copy of
the work, whereby authority to lecture in the faculty concerned is con-
ferred. But the student cannot avail himself of this permission until
he has passed the final examination, to which he may submit himself
after receiving an Igtszel1 in each of the subjects of examination.

The complete CURRICULUM at the Azhar now lasts for 17 years. If the
student (nmgdwir) successfully passes the, final examination at the end of
this period he receives the Shehddeh el-'Alimtyeh, or'diploma of learning',
which qualifies him to teach at the Azhar or other institutions of similar
standing (e.g. the mosque of Ahmed at Tanta, p. 33). At the end of
the eleventh year a preliminary examination is held, success in which
secures the Shehddeh el-Ahliyeh, a diploma qualifying for the minor offices
in the mosques and for the post of elementary teacher. The subjects
taught at the university fall into two classes: preparatory studies and
professional studies. The former embrace syntax (native), grammar (emf),
rhetoric (baldgha), logic 0rum.ti.kJ, the art of poetry Carth.1 and'ttttyeh),
algebra (gibr), arithmetic (ltisdb), and the proper mode of reciting the
traditions (mustalalz el-hadfth). The professional subjects are theology
(kaldm), jurisprudence (./i.kht p.1xxxvi), the explanation of the Koran
(tafsfr), and the teaching of the traditions (hadith; p.1xxxv). History,
geography, mathematics, and style are optional subjects. - The above list
of the subjects will serve to convey an idea of the intellectual condition
of Orientals at the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
culture consists in the entire absence of independent thought, in conse-
quence of which they are the mere recipients of the knowledge of the
past. Their minds are thus exclusively occupied with the lowest grade of
intellectual work, their principal task consisting in the systematic arrange-
ment or er1eyelopaet1ie compilation of the knowledge handed down to them.

At the head of the university is the Sheikh el-thimf, with an admin-
istrative committee of five. Control, especially in matters of finance,
is exercised by a Conseil Supérienr. Instruction is free; the university
is supported by pious endowments, from which also bread and spending
money are provided for the students. Within the last few years numerous
'strikes' have taken place among the students in consequence of the
alleged misappropriation of the endowments hy government. The income
is now SE 28,900 in cash annually, besides 25,000 loaves of bread daily,
representing an annual addition of SE18,25.

The principal entrance (P1. I), where strangers receive a guide,
is on the N.W. side, and is called Bab el-dUusaiyirtitt, or'Gate of the
Barbers', because the students used to have their heads shaved here.
To the right of this is the Msgid Taibarsiyeh (P1. 8), with a magni-
fieent mihrab, or prayer-recess, of 1309, and to the left are the
office of the steward (Pl. ff), in a restored mausoleum, and the
Zéwiyet el-1btights1blyeh (Pl. 10), now used as a library and contain-
ing some rare MSS.

The long archway (P1. 7), ending in a portal added by liiit Bey
(by whom the adjacent minaret also was built), leads directly into
the large Safm el - Game", or mosque-court, enclosed by an arcade
