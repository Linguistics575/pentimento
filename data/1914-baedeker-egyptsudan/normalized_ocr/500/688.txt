island known as Gesiret [ brim or Gestret Abu Ras. Farther on is the
prosperous village of Ibrim (lbreeu1), with fiue groves of palms and
two mosques. In the N. part of the village, near a cemetery with a
picturesque sheikh's tomb, are the rock-grottoes of IhaEstsusr (h't-.

Beside the entrance and on the rocks farther on are numerous
Memorial Inscriptions; on each side of the entrance are inscriptions
of Thutmosis Ill. Ibrim is a steamboat station.

Opposite Ibrim, on the W. bank, lies the village of'Anibeh
(Aneiba), prettily situated amidst verdant surroundings and shaded
by palms. It occupies the site of the ancient Mem, the capital of
Nubia and residence of the Eg Ttian Viceroy under the New Eur-

cemetery of the New Empire, with the remains of pyramidal and
other Brick Tombs.

ruined fort of *Kaer Ibrim (Qasr lbrim), dating from lloman times.
A visit to it is interesting.

in the same year Ibrahim Pasha (p. cxxi) re-captured and destroyed the
fortress.

An easy path ascends on the N. to the only Gate of the fortress,
which lies on the N. side. This is embellished with the Egyptian
concave cornice and the sun-disk. The Girdle Wall of rough stones
is supported on the S. side by an older substructure of carefully
hewn blocks. The interior of the fortress is occupied by a confused
group of houses of the Turkish period, built of rough stones, but
