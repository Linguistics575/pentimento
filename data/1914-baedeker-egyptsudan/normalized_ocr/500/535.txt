reliefs by Queen llatshepsut. As in all other places, the names and
figures of the queen have been scratched out or replaced by those of
Thutmesis II. or Thutmosis III. In the S. half are a room containing
a staircase leading to the roof, and a chamber with a granite altar
dedicated by Thutmosis III. Here is also a fine statue of Ameno-
phis ll. (sitting beside a damaged flgure of Amen).

The Relief: of Queen Hatshepsm, in a room to the N. shut off by a. black
granite door (key with N. Legrain, p. 264), are very ilne and have retained
their colour well. The left wall, which originally adjoined the N. wall
of the second record hall, was removed thence and re-erected here.

We now descend to the E. to an open space, strewn with the
scanty relies of the earliest Temple ofthe Middle Empire. In front
of the chambers of Thutmosis m., which may he recognized on the
N. side, ran a. path, on which the Pharaohs erected statues to the
grandees judged worthy of that honour. - We next reach the -

Great Festal Temple of Thutmosis III. We enter by the main portal
on the S.W. (PI. a), in front of which stand two statues of the king
as Osiris (the left one only complete) and the stumps of two sixteen-
sided columns. We turn to the left, traverse the antechambers,
and find ourselves in the Great Festal Halt, which has five aisles
and is 144 ft. wide and 52 ft. deep. The roof of the three central
aisles, which were higher than the others, was supported by 20 cel-
umns in two rows and 32 square pillars. The tent-pole shaped
columns (p. clxi) are unique, and indicate that the architect con-
ceived the central aisles as forming a huge festal tent. The pillars,
not so tall as the columns, were of the same height as the outer
walls and with the latter supported the pentagonal rooting slabs of
the lower side-aisles. At the same time they were prolonged to the
same height as the columns by means of imposts and architrave, in
order to assist the columns in supporting the roof of the central
aisles. The reliefs on the pillars show Thutmosis III. in presence
of the gods. The hall contains several torses of statues found there.

At the snv. corner of the hall is the chamber (P1. c) in which was
found the so-called Karnat- Table of the Kings, a list of the Egyptian mon-
archs from the earliest times down to the 18th Dyn. (transferred in 18-13
to the Bihlioth√©que Nationale in Paris). The statues of the ancient kings
which were carried in procession by the priests were probably kept in
this room. - On the N. side of the three central aisles lie three Chapels;
the one on the W. (Plur) contains a colossal group ofThutmosis Ill. between
Amon and Nut. - From the N.W. corner of the hall we pass through an
antechamher (P1. s) into a narrow corridor, the N. side of which is adorn-
ed with fine reliefs: Thutmosis III. offering incense to the ithyphallic
Amen; the king pouring water over Amen, while on the right priests and
singing men and women approach; the king pouring water on an altar
in presence of Amon and burning incense. From the N.E. angle of the
Festal Hall a flight of steps ascends within a tower-like structure to a
chamber which was perhaps used for astronomical purposes and still cen-
tains an altar. - The rooms on the E. side of the Festal Hall are in a
very ruinous eonditiom On the N.E. is a chamber with two pillars, and
adjoining it lies a dilapidated chapel with a large granite altar. - The
central door in the E. aisle leads into three chambers, of which only the
lower part of the walls is now left. Adjoining, on the N., and reached by
steps, is a SMALL loom, with its roof supported lay d clustered papyrus-
