If not pressed for time the traveller may now ascend to the
Pyramid of Teti, to the E. of which lie the scanty ruins of the
mortuary temple. Farther to the E. lies a chaos of buildings, brought
to light during the excavations lately carried on by Mr. Quibell of the
Service des Antiquités de I'Egypte, and dating from various times
from the Ancient Empire down to the Greek period. The oldest
monuments are two large stone mas.stabas, belonging to the Ancient
Empire, surmounted by brick tombs added in the Middle Empire.
The brick wall by which these are surrounded is 30-33 ft. thick
and dates from the Greek period. - Close by is the House of the
Service des Anliguilés. In front of this, to the N. and Tl., stretches
a cemetery recently excavated by Quibell, with Brick Mastabas ol'
the 2ud and 3rd Dynasties.

1'he mastaba of Ti is rivalled in beauty by the reliefs in the
**Mastaba of Ptahhotep, which lies between the Onnos Pyramid
and 3lariette's House, a few hundred yards from the latter. 1t
dates from the period of the 5th Dyn., under which the deceased
held one of the highest offices of state.

A door in the $ .14). angle admits us to a vestibule (E), beyond
which is the -

Touw-CarAsrmim OF PTAHHOTEP (F), adorned with mural reliefs
that are among the highest achievements of ancient Egyptian art at
its zenith (p. cixxiv). The colours are still well preserved, The ceil-
ing imitates the trunks of palrn-treiss.
