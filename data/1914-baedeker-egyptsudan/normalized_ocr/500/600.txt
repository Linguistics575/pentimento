On the N. side of the outer court between the Pavilion of
Ramses III. and the main temple (p. 323) stands the small but
elegant peripteral -

Temple of the 18th Dynasty, the oldest building at Medinet
Habu. This was begun in the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and Thut-
mosis III. and finished by the latter when sole monarch. The figures
and inscriptions of the queen, in the first completed (inner) chambers,
have been chiselled out here also or replaced by those of others.
The figures and names of the gods defaced by Amenophis IV. were
restored under Haremheb and Sethos I. The entrance was originally

periods were so extensive that little of the ancient ground-plan
is distinguishable. The reliefs on the outside date from the reign
of Ramses III.
