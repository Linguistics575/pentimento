of Cairo. TOMBS OF THE MAMELUKES. 5. Route. 115

The return-route leading to the S. from the Tombs passes the
cemetery of lx'arafet Bdb el- West" r to the gate och'ib el-Atttha (IMI)
el-Atabey; Pl. F, 5), which marks the end of the city of the dead 0n
the S. side, towards the citadel. Just to the E. is a fountain (sehil)
hewn in the rock by Emir S.hekhilh in 1349. As soon as we have
passed the gate we find ourselves once more in the midst of the
animated life of the city.

Suon'r WALKS IN THE DESEBT.T11086 who enjoy the silence and pure
air of the desert may proceed from the Tombs of the Caliphs (or from
'Ahhttsiyeh, p. Til) into one of the small lateral valleys to theS v'. of the
Gebel el- Ahmar (see below). A small round hill of red sandstone in this
vicinity, known by the Germans as'Rennebaum's Volcano', commands a
superb panorama of the Arabian desert, the suburb of'A.hbtsiye1yy1i?:
polis Oasis, and the extremity of the Delta. - We may return to the S. via
the Gebel Giyzishi (p.118) or to the N. via the Gehel el- Ahmar, or Red
Mountain, vising to the E. of rAbbasiyeh. The mountain consists of a
very hard conglomerate of sand, pebbles, and fragments of fossil wood,
coloured red or yellowish brown by oxide of iron. Centuries ago the
quarries here yielded material for statues as they now do for excellent
and durable mill-stones and road-material.

The Tombs of the Mamelukes, to the S. of the Citadel, includ-
ing monuments of various periods, are most conveniently visited vii
the B6b cl-Karéfeh (P1. E, 7; p. 68). The tombs, both old and
new, approach ciose to the city and extend as far as to the slopes
of the Mokattam. The older tombs are in much poorer preservation
than the Tombs of the Caliphs, owing to their conversion into
modern burial-places. Some are now represented only by their
minarets. A few are of architectural and artistic interest. The
extant inscriptions upon them are almost exclusively verses of the
Koran. To the left, halfway up the Moliat.t.am, is the Convent of the
Bektashi (p. 70).

Outside the Bib el-diarifeh we turn to the right, short of the
railway, and follow the Shttrir el-Nirdiriyeh and the Shtrir Imam
Shtfiq towards the conspicuous blue-grey dome of the Tomb Mosque
of Lnkm Shkfi'i, the founder of one of the four orthodox schools of
FDl-Ishim (p. lxxxvi). The mausoleum, erected in 1211 by Maliku
Shemseh, the mother of the Aiyubide sultan Eimil, is a great place
of pilgrimage and consequently inaccessible to unbelievers.

Near the mosque of Irntrn sum, in a lane passing beneath
vine-trellises, is the H6311 el- Bésha, or family burial mosque, built
by Mohammed Ali. The monuments (including those of Ibrahim
and'Abbés 1.; p. cxxii) are in white marble and were executed
by Greek and Armenian sculptors. l he inscriptions and ornament-
ation are richly gilded and painted. - About 1/2 M. to the W. of
the mosque of Imam 8htWi lie the sulphur-baths of'Ain cs- -Sira,
frequented by the Egyptians (traini 111 14 min. from the Bab el- Luk:
p. M, on Frid. and holidays only) Thenee to the mosque of Arm
and Old Cairo, see pp.111, 110
