the small square and mosque ofEs-Seiyideh Zeinab. On the way it
passes the high-lying thhni'Sang0r el-6tauli (1303), with two stiited
domes and a minaret resembling that of' the Hakim Mosque. To the
N. of this street lies the quarter of Birket el-Fil ('lake of the ele-
punts'), on the site of a former lake.

The Gtirnir es-Seiyideh Zeinab (Pl. c, 6, T) was completed in
1803 and enlarg, ed and restored in 188.i. The interior (not open
to foreigners) contains the tomb (restored) of Zeinah, daughter of
Imiun Ali and granddaughter of the Prophet; the bronze railing
enclosing the sarcophagus bears the date 1210 (of the Hegira). In
front of this mausoleum are the eenotaphs of three saints, beneath
a stone Canopy.

From this point the, tramway (No. 5, p. 38) leads to the N., along
the course of the former Khalig Canal (p.104), to the Bath el-khalli
and the Muski. 1loughly parallel with it goes a series of tortuous
streets, called successively Shirir Seiyideh Zeinah, Shiri' el-Lobt-
diyeh, Derb el-Crarntrniz, Shin" er-flabbaniych, and Shin" Bib el-
Khalli, leading to the (j1/4 M.) Sherir Mohammed'Ali and the Place
Bib el-Khalls. In the SHARI' ous-FI-sive," is the former Dervish
monastery of Tekkfyeh es-Sultdn Milnm'td or Tekktyeh Habban'lyeh
(Pl. D, 5). it was erected in the Turkish-Arabian style about.the
middle of the 18th cent. by Mustafa Agha, vizier of Sultan Selim,
and is now occupied by students of the Azhar Mosque (p. NO. The
building possesses a large court, with a fountain and a few palm-
trees. Around the court are the cells of the students, and adjoining
it is a small mosque. lluiit on to the monastery is the highly inter-
esting Sebil of Sultan Jlalimild, with its prominent rotunda and
elaborate facade, its projecting blinds, and its coloured marble and
porcelain interior embellishment.

4. The Northern Quarters.

The following section deals principally with the interesting edifiees in
the N.E. part of Cairo, to the N. of the Sikkeh el-0edtdeh, the continua-
tion of the Muski (p. 53), and with the N.E. suburb of'Abbdsiyeh. The
route here described is thus a direct continuation of that described in
Section 2. - The N.W. portion of Cairo (p. 78) contains little of interest.

From the Sikkeh el-Gedideh (p. 53), opposite the Gzimi' el-
Ashraf (P1. E, 3; p. 53), we enter the Smhu' EL-KHORDAGiYBH (P1.
E, 3), which begins at the Sebil of Sheikh Motahhar, dating from
1700. This street is the continuation of the great line of thorough-
fares Which runs from the Bib aneileh on the S. to the Bib el-Futnllt
(p. 77) on the N.

To the right lies the entrance to the Khin el-Khalili o. 54),
nearly opposite Which is the St ]; es.Ai.Wigh (p1. Siydgh), or bazaar
of the goldsmiths and silversmiths, which consists of several crooked
lanes, barely a yard in width. The stalls present a very poor ap-
pearance, but the filigree-work is sometimes very good. The articles
