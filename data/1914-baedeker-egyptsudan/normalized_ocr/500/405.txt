Ismd'iliyeh (Isma'ilia), situated on the N. bank of Lake Timsdh
(p. 186), was the main centre of operations during the construction
of the Suez Canal, but has to a large degree lost its importance. It
has a governor of its own and contains 10,373 inhabitants. The
pretty gardens and plantations and the view of the blue lake lend the
town the appearance of an oasis, with both European and Arabian
cultivation. - The Avenue de JUmpérairice and the Avenue Guichard
lead from the station to the shore of Lake Timsilt (station of the
steam-launches). Thence we may follow the Rue de Chancel and
