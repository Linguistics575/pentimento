"'Rock Tombs of Ancient Assit1.t, We dismount at the slaughter-
house, near which the keeper of the tombs lives, and follow a steep
path leading to a -

Large Bock Tomb, which belonged to Irap-sefii, prince of the
nome in the reign of Sesostris I. The Arabs call it fltabluntar,
or the stable of Autar, a hero of tradition (comp. p. 227).

Entering the tomb we tirst find ourselves in a vaulted PASSAGE, on
the right wall of which is the deceased, with a long and now scarcely
legible inscription in front of him. A doorway, on each side of which
is a figure of the deceased holding a Staff, leads hence to the wide MAIN
CHAMBER, which has a finely decorated ceiling. 0n the right half of the
Entrance Wall is a long inscription containing the text of ten contracts
concluded between the deceased and various priesthonds of his native
city to secure the proper sacrificial offerings to himself and to his statues,
and to provide for the performance of other ceremonies. The corresponding
inscription on the left side of the same wall contains addresses to visitors
to the tomb and an account of the merits of the deceased. A door between
two recesses in the rear wall admits us to a second vaulted passage, leading
to a SECOND Room with three recesses. On the rear wall of the central
recess appeared the deceased, four women with lotus-flowers standing be-
fore him; on the side-walls he is shown at table, while three rows of
priests and servants bring gifts to him or perform sacred ceremonies.
The left recess leads to the mummy-shaft.

The *View from this tomb is very fine. The fertile land and
the Nile, enclosed by tho. limestone hills of Libya on the W. and the
Arabian mountains in the distance to the 19., form a quiet but by no
means monotonous setting for the beautiful town of Assiht, with its
minarets and its environment of palm-gardens. The view is still
grander from the higher tombs. Here there is a row of three tombs
close to each other, dating from the obscure period before theMiddle
Empire. The northernmost has been destroyed.

The, second is the Kahf et-'Asakir. or Soldiers' Tomb, so named
from the rows of warriors armed with spears and large shields on
its S. wall. On the right side of the vestibule appear Rhett, the
owner of the tomb, and his wife Tef-yeb, with a long and partly
effaced inscription, referring to the otherwise little-known King
Meri-ke-Ni of Heracle0polis (9th Dyn.). Only a single column is left
standing in the main chamber, in the rear wall of which is a recess
for the statues of the deceased. - A passage has been made from
this tomb to that adjoining it on the s., which belonged to Tef-
yeh, a prince of the nome.

A large *Arab Cemetery stretches across the plain to the N. of
the hill of tombs, with hundreds of domed tombs among its palms.

At the foot of the hill, behind the slaughter-house, is the tomb of
another Hap-zefai, unfortunately much destroyed. It contains some ceiling
ornaments and tasteful paintings of harvest-scenes, ete., up0n stucco.

About 11/2 M. to the S. of the rock-tombs, on the slope of the Libyan
Mts., is the village of Droakeh, and 2 M. farther to the S. is the Coptic
convent of Ed-Deir (Deir Rifeh), near which are several tombs of the
Middle and New Empires. These belong to princes and grandees of the
neighbouring town of Shes-hotep (p. 235), but beyond some inscriptions
contain nothing of interest. - About 41/2 M. to the S.E. of Assit1.t, on the.
railway to Upper Egypt, lies the village of Shot!) (Chatb), the Egyptian
