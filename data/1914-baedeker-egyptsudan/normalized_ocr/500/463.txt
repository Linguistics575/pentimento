EL-WNSTA. 10. Route. 225

for the night, are some ancient constructions. To the left, on the
E. bank, lies Es-Sa/f, a distriet-eapital with 2844 inhabitants. Op-
posite, at Et-Matc'inyeh (p. 205), lie the pyramids of Lisht o. 205).

Rilclca (rail. station), on the W. bank, is a starting-point for the
excursion to the Pyramid of hfeitltsm (p. 205).

Passing a few islands we reach (W. bank) E1 -was.ta (rail.
station, see p.206; branch-line to the Faiytsm, p. 191; post-office
and Arab telegraph at the rail. station, 1,4 M. from the Nile).

On the W. bank the mountains recede a little, but on the E. bank
their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend down to the river in
rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile-villages before Benisueif
need be mentioned. On the E. bank stands the Coptie convent of
Deir 3Idr Antonios, from which a caravan-route leads to the Red Sea.
- On the W. bank lies Ashment (p. 206), and about 231. inland is
the village of Bash (Bouehe; rail. station, p. 206).

711/2 N. (W. bank) Benisueif (rail. station, see p. 206).

The next villages are Tesment and El-l.lalal/'iyeli, picturesquely
situated among palms on the W. bank, and Benz" Solimiin, on the E.
bank. As far as Minyeh (p. 208) the space between the E. bank and
the hills remains narrow, the limestone rocks frequently abutting on
the river in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are
seen on this bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side,
10-12 M. in width, is thickly populated and carefully cultivated,
exhibiting in profusion all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date
palms, eottou, and b'ugar-eane. The sugar-factories, most of which
haveEuropean managers, follow each otherin rapid sucecse, ion. They
are connected by the railway, and short branch-lines, used in har-
vest-time only, run from them to the plantations lying farther to
the W. Their lofty brick and iron chimneys impart a very modern
industrial air to the ancient land of the Pharaohs. Large barges
with sugar-eanes or with fellahin'factory-hands' are met on the
river. The juice is expressed from the cane and then refined by
being boiled twice in closed vessels.

The boat passes several large islands. On the W. bank lie Tht-
n'inha and Bibeh, the latter a railway station (p. 206). The bell-
tower of the Coptic convent, surmounted by a cross, is visible from
afar. On a promontory of the E. bank, opposite Bibeh, is the tomb
of a sheikh; in the river lies the GeWet el-Btheh, an island ot' some
size. The channel new contracts and the picturesque hills on the
E. approach the river. Numerous islets. 05 M. Feshn trail. station,
p.'207), on the W. bank, is 11/2 M. from the river. Above Feshn are
the island and village (E. bank) of El-Hibeh (p. 207).

On the W. bank lies Fant (rail. station, p. 207), and on the E.
bank are several palm-shaded villages. The Gebel Sheikh Emb√©rak
(Gebcl esh-Sheilth) and the Gebet Kardra approach the E. bank.
