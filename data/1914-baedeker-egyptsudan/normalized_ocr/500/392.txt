f.leluMn, French Hélouan-les- Bains, an artificial oasis in the
desert, 3 M. to the E. of the Nile and 115 ft. above the average
water level, is situated on a plateau enclosed by steeplimestone
hills from N.W. to SE. and has about 8000 inhabitants. I.le1wiin
has hitherto had a very prosperous existence. This it owes partly
to its thermal springs, partly to its climate. The sulphur and saline
springs, Which were made available for sanatory purposes in 1871-72,
have a temperature of 91° Fahr. and resemble those of Harrogate
and Aix-les-Bains in their ingredients. They are efficacious in
cases of rheumatism, lumhago, sciatica, neuritis, and gout. The dry
and warm climate is specially adapted for rheumatic and kidney
diseases, and for all cases in which cold and damp should be
avoided (comp. also p. xxii). Between Nov. and Feb. rain falls for a
few hours only at lielwén, and the atmosphere is free from all Iler-
ceptible moisture. The mean temperature in winter is (Ho 5' Fahr.,
with a daily range of 21° (51-720). The amount of daily sunshine
averages 8 hrs. and the fall of temperature after sunset is very slight.
In consequence of the rocky soil and the powerful rays of the sun,
the air is extraordinarily pure, dustless, and bracing.
