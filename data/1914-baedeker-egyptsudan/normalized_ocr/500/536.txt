276 Route 20. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Karnak:

columns with bud- -capitals (still in good preservation); on the lower part
of the wall are representations of the plants and animals brou ht from
Syria to Egypt by Thutmosis Ill. in the 25th year of his reign. o the S.
is the ALEXANDER R0011, built by Thutmosis m. and embellished with re-
liefs and inscriptions by Alexander the Great. The reliefs show Alexander
(or oeeasionally Thutmosis) sacrificing. Farther on is a HALL with 8 six-
teen-sided columns (7 still erect), and to the E. of it are rooms with pillars
in two stories; beyond that, forming the end of the temple on the S. side,
runs a CORRIDOR, opening'i', d which are two small rooms with pillars and
seven other chambers with reliefs of Thutmosis III.

The central and E. portions of the Temple of Amen (from
Pylon Ill onwards) were surrounded by a GIRDLE Warm, the ex-
tant remains of which are covered with reliefs of Ramses II. sacri-.
ficing to the gods. On the E. side of' this girdle-wall and to the E.
of the Festal Temple of Thutmosis 111. lies a second Sanctuary 0/
Thutmosis 111., which was probably dedicated to the cult of that
king and his sister Hatshepsut after their death. In the central
chapel (P1. a) are colossal seated figures of the royal pair; in front
of it, to the E., is a pillared hall, containing six gigantic statues
of the king, which were'usurped' by Ramses ll. - Farther to
the E., in the same main axis, lie the scanty ruins of a Temple
of Ramses 11., which interrupts an old brick girdle-wall. Beyond
the entrance-gateway, which is situated on the E. side, we enter
a court with arcades formed of columns and of pillars embel-
lished with Osiris-statues; beyond that is a hypostyle hall. To the
E., in front of the portal, lay an arcade with 20 columns, of the time
of Taharka. To the N. of this are the remains of another Temple of
Ramses If., which was restored in the reign of the Ptolemies and was
perhaps dedicated to the cult of King Mentuhotep 111. (11th Dyn.);
to the s., to the E. of the Sacred Lake, are the remains of a Brick
Building dating from a period anterior to the Middle Empire.

Farther on is the well-preserved E. Gateway (now closed) of the
great brick girdle-wall which enclosed the whole area of the temple.
It was built by one of the Ptolemies and is J) ft. in height. It
lies 510 yds. distant from the first pylon (p.2

Against the irdle- wall stands a small Tenfpl? of Osiris (key with
M. Legrain, p. iid) erected by Osorkon III., his son and co- regent Take-
lothis HI., and his daughter Shepenupet. The first chamber was added
later by imiiiiiiriifi, sister of Shabako (25th Dyn.) and mother- in-law of
Psammistichos I. Near it are several small chapels of the same period
(26th Dyn.). - If we turn to the right (8.) outside the gateway, we soon
reach a small building bearing the cartouches of Ramses IH. and Ramses IV.

0. THE NORTHERN BUILDINGS AT KARNAK.

Of the huildings to the N. of the Teniple of Amon the Temple of
Ptah alone is worth a visit-, the others are in such bad preservation that
hurried travellers may omit a visit to them altogether.

From the N. side- door of the hypostyle hall an ancient paved
road leads N. E. to the Temple of Ptah, within the precincts of the
Temple of Amon, passing (left) a small brick fortress and three
small Chapels of the Late Period, all entered from the E.
