274 Route 20. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Kamak:

ruins. On the walls to the right and left of the granite gateway are
representations in the usual style of the cities and tribes subdued
by Thutmosis III. (comp. p. 272); to the right are the tribes of the
s., to the left'the tribes of the Upper Retenu (Le. Syria), which
His Majesty took in the wretched town of Megiddo'.

Beyond the sixth pylon lies the First Hall of Records, erected
by Thutmosis IH., in a court which he had constructed some time
previously. Here stand two large Granite Pillars, which once support-
ed the roof. The S. (right) pillar bears the lily of Upper Egypt, the
N. pillar the papyrus of Lower Egypt. Here are also the remains
of wonderful Colossal Statues of Amon (much restored ] and of the
Goddess Amunet, in reddish sandstone, dedicated by King Tut-
enkh-Amun, whose name was later replaced by that of Haremheh.

To the left and right of this Hall of Records are the court and eolon-
nades of Thutmosis IH., the ceiling of which was borne by clustered
papyrus-columns with 16 shafts. On the back of the entranee-door to the
S. part are representations of Sethos II. On the E. wall, in the fagade
of the building of Hatshepsut, is a false door which was once lavishly
adorned'with gold and lapis 1azuli'. On the S. side are five chapels for
the worship of Amenophis I.

The Chapel in which the sacred boat stood 011 a pedestal (still
in situ) was built in the time of Philip Arrhidams, probably on the
site of an earlier chapel of Thutmosis III. the granite reliefs of which
were used as paving-stones (two reliefs are now standing in the
NE. and SE. corners, a third in the chamber to the S. of the Hall
of Records). The chapel is built entirely of pink granite and is
divided into two chambers. The front chamber, opening to the W.,
is 20 ft. long, the hinder one is over 25 ft. long and has in the E.
wall a double window reached by four granite steps. The walls both
outside and inside were covered with reliefs, the colouring of
which is still in good preservation at some points.

Interior Walls. In the first chamber Philip appears offering sacrifices
to various forms of Amen and performing other religious rites. The
figures and inscriptions are picked out with bluish-green pigment. The
reliefs in the second chamber are larger, but in poorer preservation. Here,
to the left, Philip is seated at a banquet. - Exterior Walls. On the S.
side of the first chamber are four rows of reliefs, the lowest of which is
destroyed: 1. Rites attending the entrance of the chapel by the king; the
goddess Amunet gives milk to the king. 2, 3. The sacred boats of Amen,
borne by priests, going and returning on a festal occasion. On the S. wall
of the second chamber are four sadly damaged reliefs, side by side, re-
presenting the king sacrificing to various forms of Amen or performing
religions ceremonies. On the N. wall of the first chamber the king offers
two small trees to Amou-Kametf. On the N. wall of the second chamber
are representations of foundation ceremonies and of saevifleiat scenes.

On the N. wall of the second Hall of Records of Thutmosis III.
(enclosing the chapel) are long inscriptions detailing the military
achievements of that monarch. The relief above the inscription to
the right of the black granite door depicts Thutmosis III. conferring
gifts on the temple (two obelisks, vases, necklaces, chests). - Open-
ing off the Hall of Records to the N. and S. are a number of rooms,
all more 01' less in ruins, which were built and embellished with
