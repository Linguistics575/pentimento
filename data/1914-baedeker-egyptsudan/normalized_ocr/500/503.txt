Situation. LUXOR. 20. Route. 253

THREE Darts' V1511". 1st Day. Start early and ride to Karnak (p. 262).
The traveller who visits the Great Temple of Amon, the most gigantic of
the monuments, on the first day proceeds then to view the other lions with
the satisfactory feeling that Thebes has fulfilled his highest expectations;
and he will not fail to take a later opportunity to return to refresh and
confirm his iirgh impression. A visit by moonlight is exceedingly attrac-
tive. In the afternoon visit the temple of Lazar (p.257), reached in a
few minutes from the hotels .--2nd Day. Cross the river early, visit the
Temple of Sethas J. (p. 282), ride to the Tombs of the Kings at Btbdn
el-3fultlk o. 984), then cross the ridge to visit the terrace-temple of Deir
el-Balari (p. 299; an excursion of q hrs.). - 3rd Day. Cross the river
early, visit the Colour: of Memnon (p. 330), Medinet Habu (p. 322), the
Tombs of the Queens (p. 319), and Deir el-Medineh (p. 316). On the way back
(after lunch) visit the Rameeseum (p. 306). and finally some of the tombs
of Shaikh'Abd ebh'uma (p. 30N, another'7 hrs.' day).

On a LONGER STAY the traveller will wish to revisit several points,
especially the temple of Amon at Karnak, and will be glad to devote
more time to the monuments on the W. bank, particularly the interesting
tombs of Karma. Madame?! (p. 281) also may he visited, or a half-day trip
by the railway (11/2 day by the steamboat mentioned at p. 252) may be
taken to the barrage and temple of Ewell (p. 342) and the temple of Edfn
(p. 343). Keneh and the temple of Dendera as well as Abydos also may each
be visited in one day from Luxor by the railway. To Foysir, see p. 373.

Map. The best map of this district is Prof. Schwetnfurth's Map of the
Western Environs of Luxor and Karnak (1:25pm; Berlin, i909; NO.

On each side of the Nile stretches a wide belt of fertile land,
bounded both on the E. and W. by ranges of hills, overtopped by
finely shaped peaks, especially on the E., where the ridge retires
farther from the stream than on the W. The verdant crops and
palms which everywhere cheer the traveller as soon as he has quitted
the desert, the splendid hues that tinge the valley every morning
and evening, the brilliant, unclouded sunshine that bathes every
object even in the winter-season, lend to the site of ancient Thebes
the appearance of a wonderland, richly endowed with the gifts of
msver-failing fertility. Most of the ruined temples are situated in
the level district and are reached by the waters of the Nile when
the inundations are at their highest; while the tombs are hewn in
the flanks of the hills, where their dark openings are so numerous,
that the E. slope of the Libyan range might be aptly compared to
a piece of cork or to a honeycomb.

0n the right (E.) bank lies Luxor (Luqsor). now a town of
13,908 inhab. (incl. 4598 Copts), the chief tourist-centre in Upper
Egypt. The name is derived from the Arabic El-/ru.eiir (pl. of El-
qu) and means'the eastles', having reference to the extensive
temple within which part of the place once lay. Near the temple
traces of antique embankments on the river (PI. A, 4) and of a
nilometer may still be seen. The most frequented part of the town
is the new Quay extending along the bank of the Nile in a S.
direction from the temple; here are the Winter Palace Hotel, the
116th du Nil, and many shops. On the E. the Sh√©ri' el-Mahatta,
with the post-tie, runs straight to the railway station (p. 251).
To the N. of the town lies the Zabtiych Square (Pl. 0, 2), an open
space adorned with gardens, which contains the Police Station (Zab-
