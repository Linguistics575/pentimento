Egypt; but in 451 A.D. they were defeated by Jhtreiatr, who con-
cluded a peace with them (p. 364).

Christianity established itself at Phila: in the 4th cent., and
thence extended throughout Nubia, where the temples were con-
verted into churches. In (W) A.D. Egypt and the Upper Nile Valley
fell into the hands of the Mohammedans.'Amr (p. cxiii) penetrated
as far as Dongola and imposed tribute upon Nubia, but no enduring
subjugation .of the country was effeeted. Shams ed-Dila, brother
of Saladin, took possession of the fortress of [ brim (p. 402) in 1173
and plundered the chnrch-treasury; but Christianity yielded to
Islam very gradually. and a Christian kingdom lingered at Siba
on the Blue Nile (p. 432) until the middle ag'es. We know little
of the Mohammedan principalities established at Derr, Dongola,
Sennér, and other points in Nubia. In 1821 Tsinh'" Pasha con-
quered the whole of Nubia for his father, Mohammed Ali, Pasha of
Egypt. For the later history of the country, the Mahdist rebellion,
and the reconquest by Kitchener, see pp. cxxiv. cxxv.

Quarriee and fort at Kertassi and the temples at Tafe/a and Katribsheh will

As we leave Sheila! (p. 363) we have a fine view of the ruined
temples of Philae (p. 365) and of the rocks of Biggeh (p. 370). To the
S.W. of Biggeh lies El-ffesseh (Hem), the largest of the cataract-is-
lands, where the cemetery ot'the priests of Philre was discovered. 0n
the E. bank are the villages of EI-IMI, and Bellél (El-Mes/thed), with
picturesque ancient mosques. On the rocks above Bellzil is a sheikh's
tomb. - On the E. bank, opposite the 8. end of fiu'l--Hesseh, is a
roek-inseription of Phiops L, relating to hisvictnry over the Nnbians.

At Et-Gudhi the river bends to the SAW, afterwards returning
to its S. direction. The scenery becomes less wild, and a narrow
strip of verdure appears on each bank. - To the W. is the Gebel
Shcimet el- way. From time to time we observe ancient dykes of
huge stones (on both banks), and on the summits of the higher hills
are ruined guard-houses, dating from the Mahdist insurrection.

TEMPLE or Dmstm, situated near the river. This temple was
built by the Nubian king 1u" zeklier-Amun, a contemporary of the
earlier Ptolemies, and it was enlarged by Ptolemy Philometor. From
a modern flight of steps we pass through two Doorways, on the
second of which appear the winged snn-disk and a Greek inscription
in favour of Ptolemy Philometor and his consort Cleopatra. About
4?. ft. beyond a third doorway (now ruined) is the temple proper.
