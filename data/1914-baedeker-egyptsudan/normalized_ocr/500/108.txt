Thutmosis III. reigned alone. He was one of the most notable
Egyptian kings, conquered Syria, and established the influence
of Egypt in W. Asia. His roek-tomb is at Biban el-5lultsk

Thutmosis IV. (1420-1411 B.C.) excavated the Sphinx at Gizeh
(comp. p. 135). Tomb at Bibin el-Multi; (p. 298).

Amenophis III. (rM1-i375 B.0.; called Memnon by the Greeks),
whose wife was named Teye, maintained intercourse with the
kings of Babylon, Assyria, Mitini (on the upper Euphrates), etc.
(see cuneiform tablets from Tell el-'Amarua, p. 212), and built
temples in Nubia, Luxor, Medinet Habu (fklossi of Memnon,
p. 330), and elsewhere. His tomb and that of his wife are both
at Biban el-Multok (p. 298).

Amenophis IV. (1375-1358 13.0.) endeavoured to replace the old
religion by the worship of a single deity, vis. the sun, an
attempt perhaps to provide a god that should be worshipped in
common by all the peoples of the extensive empire o. cxlvi). The
movement was probably instigated by the priests of Heliopolis
and was directed at first only against the gods of Thebes, who,
during the New Empire, had thrown all others into the shade.
Many of the ancient deities, especially those of Thebes, were
fauatically'persecuted', their images and names being removed
from all monuments. For his own original name, in which the
name of Amon occurs, the king substituted that of Ekh-en-Aton,
'the disk of the sun rejoices'. Tell el-'Amarua (p.211) was
made the capital instead ofThebes. AmenophisIV. was buried at
Bibin er-MuItok (p. 298). After his death internal commotions
broke out and the new religion was abolished.

Among his successors (1358-1350 13.0.) were Eye (tombs at Tell
el-'Amarna, p. 216, and at Bibén el-Mul1tlr, p. 298) and Tut-
enkh-Amun, who transferred the royal residence back to Thebes.

Haremheb [ Harma'is; 1350-1315 B.C.) restored peace and founded
the 19th Dynasty. Tomb at Bibtm eI-MuItk (p. 298).
