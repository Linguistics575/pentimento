in that country. The four liwéns were superseded by a single sanc-
tuary, consisting of a main building covered with domes and usually
preceded by a second court (comp. the plan on p. 69).

The smaller prayer-rooms, frequently added to private houses
and not unlike the Christian chapels, are known as Ztiuriyeh.

The EXTERIOR of the earliest mosques was absolutely plain. The
court was enclosed by a simple battlemented wall and was entered
by an nnadorned doorway. It was not until the Egyptians beheld
the buildings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine that they began
to elaborate the facades of their mosques. The hitherto smooth
walls were now interrupted by panels or fields, receding about 8 or
10 inches, but again brought forward to the level of the facade by
smooth slanting surfaces immediately below the unobtrusive bat-
tlemented main cornice. In these panels were placed the windows
(rectangular or arched), frequently arranged in pairs with a smaller
circular or star-shaped window above usually closed with liamariyeh
(p. clxxxvi). The main portal was a deep rectangular recess, with a
stone bench on either side, and terminating at the top in a half-
dome, embellished with stalactites. The doorway at the inner end
of the recess was surmounted by an architrave-arch and a relieving
arch. The door itself, often richly panelled, is usually adorned 011
one side with embossed or chased bronze decorations. The threshold
generally consisted of a block of granite taken from an Egyptian
monument. The low railing here (or on the steps below) marks the
boundary to which the visitor may penetrate without removing his
shoes or sandals.

We now turn to inspect the INTERNAL EQUIPMENT of the mosque.
The centre of the Court was originally occupied by a fountain, be-
neath a canopy supported upon columns. This was intended for
ornament only, for the prescribed ablutions were performed at a
special basin (Meititr) in an adjoining court. Under Turkish rule
the fountain was frequently replaced by an apparatus provided
with taps and known as the f.lanefiyeh.

The Sanctuary contains the Iiibla or Jfily%, the prayer-niche
turned towards Mecca. Here we further observe: (t) the Minbar, or
pulpit, to the right of the Kibia, usually embellished with orna-
mental panels and incrustation; (lg) the Kursi, the seat of the
Imam, together with a desk forithe Koran; (3) the Dikkeli, a podium
borne by columns, and surrounded by a low railing, from which the
Muballighin (assistants of the celebrant) repeat the words of the
Koran and the ritualistic gestures for the benefit of the. more dis-
tant worshippers; (4) the lamps and lanterns (Tanntfr, large chan-.
delier; Toreiya, lit.'seven stars', small chandelier; Ftnils, lamp,
Jiandil, small oil-lamp) which hang by wires from the iron braces
and'ceillngs of the arcades as in all the liwéns.

The sanctuary is frequently adjoined by the Turba or Mortuary
Chapel of the founder. This is usually a square chamber, Contain-.
