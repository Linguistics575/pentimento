3. Determinatives.

E.g. man; woman; / tree; Er= house; C) town;

tit! abstract idea. To this class belong also the sign of the plural
I

III (I) and the oval ring C Di (the so-called'eartouehe') placed
l

round the names'of kings.

These various classes of signs, which were used in accord-
ance with certain fixed rules of orthography, were employed in
writing Egyptian words; e41. i),:, ?,:, ?,:? ,, mn,'to remain' (syllabic
sign eeeh mn, sound waM n, determinative for an abstract
idea :21); BE) Sp,'time' ir---- s, Up, Â© word-sign sp). We
cannot, of course, pronounce these words that are written without
vowels; but in many instances, by the aid of Coptic (p. cxxxi) or of
Cuneiform or Greek transliterations [ especially in the case of proper
names), we learn what was the pronunciation at 1 ater periods, and are
thus able to supply vowels to the consonanta ] skeletons. We know,
6.9., that the Coptic for'time' is sop, and we therefore read the
above hieroglyphic as sop. When, however, no such guide is
obtainable it is the custom of Egyptologists to render the words

articulate by inserting an e; thus Ra) Ic', lull', is read ke'.

Hieroglyphics are usually written from right to left, sometimes
in perpendicular rows, sometimes in horizontal rows; occasionally,
but quite exceptionally and only for decorative purposes, they
are written from left to right. For the sake of convenience modern
reproductions of hicroglyphies are written or printed from left to
right. It was almost a matter of course that both the shapes of the
hieroglyphics and the orthography of the words should vary very
greatly in the course of the thousands of years during which the
system was used; and with a little trouble the traveller will soon
learn to distinguish the simple and bold characters of the Early
Empire from the ornate symbols of the 18th Dyn. Ce.g. in the temple
at Abydos) am ] from the small crowded hieroglyphics of the Ptole-
maic period.

When the picture characters instead of being carved by the
chisel were written with a reed-pen upon papyrus, fragments of
limestone, or wooden tablets, they generally assumed a simpler and
more rounded form. In this way arose a system of Literary ITiero-
glyphic, which we meet with mainly in carefully-executed religious
manuscripts.

For the purposes of ordinary writings this system was still
further simplified and abbreviated and for the sake of speed the
separate characters were often united, thus forming a Writing or
