1. Ezbckiych. CAIRO. d. Route. 51

European travellers who purpose making large purchases iu the ba-
zaars must arm themselves beforehand with the most inexhaustible pa-
tience. Time has no value for an Oriental, and that fact must be taken
into the calculation. Everything must he haggled for, sometimes in the most
obstinate fashion. When the customer knows the proper price and offers
it, the dealer will remark'shuraigeN (it is little), but will close the bar-
gain. Sometimes the shopkeeper sends for coffee or tea from a neighbouring
coffee-house in the course of the bargaining. If no satisfactory agreement
can be reached, the customer should calmly proceed on his way. Every step
he takes will lower the demands of the obdurate dealer. It is advisable
to offer at first rather a lower sum than the purchaser is willing to pay,
in order that the offer may he raised. A common phrase in the cere-
m0ni0us East is'khuduh baldsh' (take it for nothing), which, of course, is
never seriously meant. Foreigners, however, must be prepared to pay
more than natives, Dragomans and commissionnaires usually have a private
understanding with the dealer, so that to make purchases in their company
ls to add 10-20 per cent to the price. The street-hawkers often ask as much
as 5, 10, 15, or even 20 times the value of their wares. Skill in getting
the better of a purchaser is in the eyes of an Oriental merely a desirahle
business accomplishment.

I. The Ezbekiyeh and the New Quarters.

The central point of the foreign quarter, between the old Arab-
ian Cairo and the new town built in the European style within
the last 50 years, is the -

*Ezbekiyeh Garden (P1. 0, 3), or simply the Esrbekfyeh, on the
site of the former Ezbekiyeh Lake and named after the heroic Emir
Ezbek, the general of Sultan Iprit Bey (i468-0ir, p. cxix), who
brought the general and son-in-law of Bayazid I. as a captive to
Cairo. A mosque, now vanished, was erected here in 1495 in honour
of his victory. The fine gardens, Which have several entrances (adm.
tho. pias.), were laid out in 1870 by M. Barillet, formerly chief gar-
dener to the city of Paris. They cover an area of 201/2 acres and
contain a variety of rare and beautiful trees and shrubs. Crows and
kites are here very numerous. In the centre of the gardens is a
roller skating rink. Military bands, see p. 42.

To the S. of the Ezbekiyeh lies the Opera House (p. 41), between
which and the Hétel Continental stretches the PLACE DE L'0PimA
(Midc'm, et-Teatro; Pl. B, G, 3), with an equestrian statue of Jbrtlttm
Pasha (Arab. El-Husa'n). Thence the Shirit'Abdin leads to the
S. to the jU" uitht'Aldln, on the left side of which lies the Khedivial
Palace (PL 0, 4, 5), and on the right the Egyptian Army Barracks.

Between the Ezbekiyeh and the Opera House the Shéri' et-Teatro
leads to the small Midén Ezbek, with the building of the Jnter-
national Tribunal (Tribunaux Mixtes; Pl. 0, 3) and the CréditLyon-
nais (p. 37). Parallel with this street runs the Shirt" Tzihir, on the
right side of which are the building of the Caisse de la Dette Pub-
lique, the General Post Mee (P1. C, 3, p. 37), and the Headquarters
of the Fire Department. Both these streets end at the" ATABA EL-
KHApRA, a point of intersection of many tramways (p. 38), whence
the Muski (p. 53) leads to the E.
