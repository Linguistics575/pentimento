Quarters. CAIRO. J. Route. 73

The Prayer Recess (H.'3) has fine Byzantine capitals and remains
of gilded mosaic. The wooden eupoia over it has lately been restored.
The Pulpit erected by Sultan Ful-Mansitsr (p. 71) in 1298 is still
noticeable, though it has been robbed of its characteristic panels
carved in ebony and ivory. These were sold in Europe and some
of them are now in the South Kensington Museum.

The large Minaret [ PL T), in the N.W. outer court, dates from
a later period and is perhaps a reproduction of a tower at Samarra
on the Tigris. It is built of stone, instead of brick, and also shows
peculiarities in its square lower section and elsewhere. The horse-
shoe arches at the entrance are particularly fine. The ascent is easy,
and the top commands an admirable *View. To the S. are the pyra-
mids of Dahshftr and to the W. the huge pyramids of Gizeh; the
valley of the Nile as far as the Delta lies before us; to the E. rise
the picturesque slopes of the Moliattam and the Citadel; in the
foreground all round lies Unite, with its houses, mosques, palaces,
and gardens; to the N., at the foot of the minaret, is the Medreseh
Farghutmash. - From the minaret access is gained to the concrete
roofs of the ltwtns, protected by elegant balnstrades; a walk round
these is recommended for a full appreciation of the view.

We return to the Shtri' Ibn Tulto, turn to the right by the
Shari' ez-Ziyadeh, on the S.W. side of the, iiioSLlue, and follow
the winding Shhir eleabsh and the Slririr er-Rahaba, all in the
quarter of Iial'at el-Kabsh (p. 71 ], to the -

*Medreseh met Bey CPI. C, 7), which was erected in 1475 and
has been recently restored by llerz-Pasha. It is cruciform in ground-
plan, and its rich and elegant forms afford a good example of the
style current under the second Mameiuke dynasty (p. clxxx). The
minaret is one of the most graceful in Cairo. The pulpit is richly
embellished with wood-earving. The mosaics 011 the pavement and
the fine ornamentation of the walls also are worthy of notice. The
dome is modern.

The Sheri Bir el- Wat√©wit leads to the E. from the Shari Ibn
Tuiun, at the Mosque ofTnlto, to the Smkm'riTt-lcmTmrtr LPI. D, 7),
the W prolongation of the Shari P.S- -Salibeh (p. 71). Here, just to
theN. otthe'l'nlun Mosque stands the small iirlifiUeuUiii'ui'if2sif,'
built by one of Sultan l.lasau's Mamelukes in 1357 in the style of
the mosque of Sultan I.lasan. The four 1iwitns form a cross with
the court in the centre. Ou the walls to the right and left of the
prayer-niehe are the arms of the builder. A door in the S.W. corner
of the W. liwtu leads to the mausoleum, covered by a stately dome.
- 1n the Shirir Ezbek, a side-street, lies the beautiful Mosque of

huek, el-liiee/i (Pl. D ,6), built in hiii in the style of liait Bey
and recently restored.

The W. continuation of the Sherir el-Khedeiri expands into
the Snfim' 1cL-MAnfisiN tPl. C, 7), which leads almost straight to
