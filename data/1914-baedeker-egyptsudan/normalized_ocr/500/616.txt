ofBehtet', Behtet being probably a district of ancient Edfu; he was
represented as a flying falcon, as a man with a faleon's head, or as
the sun with outspread wings.

The way from the landing-place to the (20 min.) Temp1e of
Horus leads almost due w., then, turning to the N. (right), skirts
the Canal of Edfu and crosses it by a bridge. It then proceeds to
the W. through several streets and finally turns N. again for a short
distance. - The bridle-path ends at the N. gate of the later girdle-
wall. Route from the railway station of Edfu, see p. 337.

The "Temple of Horus, built of sandstone, stands in wonderful,
almost perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian
temple or even of any antique building in the world, in spite of the
2000 years that have passed over it. Unfortunately the faces of the
kings and gods in the reliefs all over the temple were scratched out
in the Christian period. The present temple occupies the site of an
earlier sanctuary and was dedicated to the sun-god Horus, Hathor of
Dendera, and the youthful Horus,'Uniter of the Two Lands' (llar-
sem-tcwe, Hareorntus). The history of its construction and a de-
scription of the entire structure are detailed in lengthyinscriptions
on the exterior of the girdle-wall (at Pl. i and k). The temple proper
was begun in 237 B.0. by Ptolemy IlI. Euergetes I. and com-
pleted, so far as the masonry was concerned, by his successor
Philopator in 212 B.O. The decoration of the walls with reliefs
and inscriptions, postponed by the death of PhiloPator and the
disturbed reign of Epiphanes his Successor, was resumed in
176 BA). under Philometor and completed in 147 BA). (under Euer-
getes IL), Le. 90 years after the laying of the foundation-stone.
Euergetes II. built the great vestibule (completed 122 B.C.) and
embellished it with reliefs, and under Ptolemy X. Soter II. and
Ptolemy XI. Alexander I. the colonnaded court, the girdle-wall,
and the pylon were added, though the reliefs on the latter date frorh
Neos Dionysos. The final touch was given in 57 B. C.

The temple was originally surrounded by a lofty Brick Wall,
still partly preserved, pierced by a large gateway on the S., in the
axis of the temple, and by a smaller gateway to the W.

The great Pylon stood in an inner girdle-wall of brick, and its
entrance was closed by a double door. It is covered on all sides
with reliefs and inscriptions. On the front of each of the towers
the colossal figure of the King Neos Dionysos is conspicuous, smiting
his foes, whom he holds by the hair, in presence of the falcon-
headed Horus of Edfu and Hathor of Dendera. In two rows, above,
the king appears praying and offering sacrifices before Horus, before
Hathor and Horus,'Uniter of the two lands', and before other gods
of Edfu. The four wide incisions, two on each side of the central
portal, were intended to support large flag-staffs, which were further
secured by means of clamps fastened in the holes still to be seen
in the masonry directly above. The small rectangular apertures in
