occupied with victorious campaigns against his unruly Sy-
rian vassals, in which he was greatly aided by the military
talents of his son Ibrahim.

Ile exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews,
and he re-enacted and vigorously enforced the sumptnary laws
of Omar, Nutawakkil, Hakim, and En-Niisiir. Not only were
the colours to be worn by the Christians and Jews prescribed
(the costume of the former being dark-blne, with black turbans,
and a wooden crass weighing, 5lbs. hung round their necks;
that of the latter, yellow, with black turbans, and a black
hall hung from their necks); but the fashion of their dress and
length of their tnrbans, and even the costume of their women,
were so regulated as entirely tn distinguish them from the
followers of the prophet.

Ili-Ashraf Bars Bey (Bursbey; pp. 53, 113), who had for a

time been the vicegerent of an infant sultan, ascended the
throne on April 1st, ih22. He waged successful campaigns
against Cyprus and the Mongols.

1.rkit Bey (pp. 73, 113) was one of the last independent

Mameluke sultans ongypt. Both as ageneral and a diplo-
matist he successfully maintained his position against the
Turks (Sultans Mohammed and Bayazid), and even inflicted
serious losses on them; but the refractory Mameiukes ob-
strueted his undertakings and in 1496 eompelled him to
abdicate in favour of his son Mohammed, a boy of fourteen.

El-Ghuri, Kc'in'szih el-Ghi'tri o. 59), once a slave of I.fiit

Bey, was upwards of sixty years of age when he ascended
the throne, but he, still possessed sufficient vigour to keep
the unruly emirs in check. Already seriously injured by
the discovery of the Cape route to India byithe Portuguese,
the trade of Egypt was terribly depressed by high taxes
and by the accompanying debasement of the coinage. At
the instigation of the Venetians, El-Crum" equipped a fleet
against the Portuguese in India, and in 1508 he gained a
naval victory over Lorenzo, son of the Viceroy Francisco
d'Almeida, at Chaui, uearlBruubay; but, tin 1509 his fleet
was compelled to retreat to Arabia. Itu'l-f1hihi fell, while
lighting against the army of the Osman sultan Selim I. on
the plain of Merj Dibilr (N. of Aleppo).

Tainan Bey (p. 61) was dethroned by the Osman Sultan

Selim I. of Constantinople (pp. 45, 1'20). Cairo was taken
by storm. Egypt theneefortll became a Turkish Pashalic.
Selim compelled Mutawakkil, the last scion of the family
of the Abbaside caliphs, to convey to him) his nominal
supremacy, and thus became Khalif (Caliph), the spiritual
and temporal sovereign of all the professors ot'El-Islthn. +

+ The Osman snltans' claim to the culiphate is based upon this'aet.
The caliph is not in any sense the'pope' of the Mohammedan, asjhe
claims no Spiritual power. He is the temporal head of the true believers
and their champion in the holy war. The euliphate of the Osmans is only
