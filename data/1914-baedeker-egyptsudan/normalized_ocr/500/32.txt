L9). Arabian Cafés. Story Tellers. Musicians. Singers.
Shadow Plays. Baths.

Arabian Cafés (sing. lcahwa) are frequented by the lower classes
almost exclusively. The front consists of woodwork with a few open
arches. Outside the door generally runs a ma.s.taba, or raised seat
of stone or brick, covered with mats, and there are similar seats
in the interior. Coffee is served by the { cahwdgi at I/rd pias. per cup
(/ingdn), and several narg'ileh or shisheh and giiseh (water-pipes)
are kept in readiness for the use of customers. The tumhdk (Per-
sian tobacco) smoked in the gtrzeh is sometimes mixed with the
intoxicating hashi'sh (hemp, Cannabis lndica), which has an utr-
mistakable smell.'l'lse importation and sale of hashish are prohi-
bited in Egypt; it is therefore smuggled in in the most artful ways.

Story Tellers (who in private domestic circles are generally
women) are still a eharaeteristie oriental institution. Wherever
they make their appearance, whether in the public streets or the
coffee-house, in the densely peopled alleys of the large towns or in
the smallest country-villages, they are sure to attract an attentive,
easilypleased, and exceedingly grateful crowd. The more sensational
the tale, the better, and the oftener is the narrator applauded with
protracted cries of'hah', or'Allih', or'Allihu akbar!' .--Most
of the story-tellers belong to the so-calied 8lWara (sing. 8htrd),
literally'singers'. They are known also as'Amttireh (sing.'Antari)
or Abu Zeidtyeh, according as their theme consists of tales and
romances from the history ofVAntar, a Beduiu hero, or from that of
Abu Zeid. Others again are called Jfiliaddiitsti, i.e. narrator's of
history, their province being the recital in prose of passages from
the history of Sultan Beyhars (p. cxvii) and other historical heroes.
The entertainments of the'alt leiteh u taileh' (thousand and one
nights) are, however, no longer heard, as popular superstition has
branded this collection of tales as'unlucky'. The themes of the
whole fraternity are too often of an immoral character.

Musicians by profession, called Attttyek (sing. Aldti), are in-.
dispensable on every festive occasion. The usual instruments are
the rilhk, or tambourine with little bells, the rueutreh or semi-
spherical tambourine, the germ or hautbois, the tabl beledi or
drum, the tabl shtmi or kettle-drum, and the darab0keh, a kind
of funnel-shaped drum (generally made of earthenware, but some-
times of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell, with
a fish-skin stretched over the broad end), which last is accompanied
by the zumméra, a kind of double flute. A better class of instru-
ments, used for chamber music, includes the ndi, a kind of flute, the
kemengeh or two-striuged violin, the body of which consists ofa eocoa
nut shell, the reblibeh, or one-stringed violin with a square wooden
body, the letmiin, a kind of zither with strings of sheep-gut, and
astly the'ud, the lute or mandoline, the oldest ofall the instruments.
