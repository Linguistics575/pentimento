HISTORY OF CAIRO. At a very remote period a city lay on the
E. bank of the Nile, opposite the great pyramids, and was called by
the Egyptians Jrhere-ohe, or'place of combat', because Horns and Seth
were said to have contended here (p. cxliv). This formed a kind of
suburb of Heliopolis. The Greeks named it Babylon, probably in
imitation of the Egyptian name of the island ofRocla, viz. Per-ham-m-
On or the'Nile City of On' (Heliopolis). The citadel of this town
fp. 106) was fortified by the Romans and under Augustus became the
headquarters of one of the three legions stationed in Egypt. In 641
A.D. Babylon was captured by'Amr ibn el-U.s, the general of Oaliph
Omar, who established a new capital of the country to the N. of the
fortress, extending as far as the Gebel Yeshlrtsr (p. 71). This, named

with the exception of the great mosque, was burned to the ground
a new residence was built still farther to the N. by the Abbaside
governors, and around this sprang up the new quarter of El-'Askar.
The town was extended to the N.E. as far as the base of the citadel
by Ahmed ibn Tuli'm, who erected the quarter of El-irayi'iVlrayr-
fyeli). Aluned's splendour-loviug son Khuméraweih embellished
the town with lavish magnificence. The modern city of Cairo was
founded by Géhar, the geneia ] of the Fatimite Caliph Muizz, after
the conquest of Egypt in 969 A. D. m erected a residence for the
Caliph and barracks for the soldiers commanded by him to the N.
of El-I.fatih". At the hour when the foundation of the walls was
