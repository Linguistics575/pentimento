stands on the site of an older Coptic church; it was arteruards used
as a mosque, but a dedicatory cross is still to be seen on one of the
columns. The temple has no inscriptions. Steep ilights of steps, cut
in the rock, descended on the W. side to the river. The view from
the castle-hiil is very line; to the E. rise the hills of the Arabian
desert (one eminence crowned by the tomb of a sheikli). while the
Nile tlows far below; to the S. are the rocks near Abu Simbel; to
the W. lies the tawny desert with its pyramidal hills, contrasting
with the verdant cultivated land and the grey houses of'Aniheh.

Clme io the S. slope of the castle-hill lie the ruins of a small Town,
surrounded hy a wall. Farther up the valley is a large Cemetery, with
simple Chrietiam graves and some brick tomhs on a more ambitious scale.
There is a similar cemetery in the valley to the N. of the castle.

In the steep W. slope of the castle-hill are several large Memorial
Recesses, dating from the New Empire. These now lie at some
height ahme the river-bank and some are very difficult of access, but
originally they "are reached by means of steps from a path skirting
the river at a higher level than the present path. The first (on the S.)
was constructed in the reign of Thntmosis Ill. by Nehi, governor
of Ethiopia. The second was constructed in the reign of Ramses II.
by Setaw, governor of Ethiopia, who is represented in it with his
ofticials, The third recess dates from the joint reign of Thut-
mosis III. and Hatshepsut, but the name of the latter is every-
where defaced. Both rulers, em-h becide a deity, are represented
on the rear wall. The fourth recess, the most important, belongs
to the reign of Amenophis II. On the right side-wall the king re-
ceives tribute of all kinds (including Panthers) from two officials.
Ch, the left wall the king appears conducted by Horus, lord of Buhen
(Widi Balfa), before a row of gods. In a niche in the back-wall
is the statue of the king, embraced by Horus of Mem ('Anibeh),
on the right, and by the goddess Satet, on the left. The walls are
further adorned with 1leroitie paintings. The fifth recess has no
sculptures.

On a steep cliff facing the river, to the S. of liaer Ihrim, are a
Relief and Inscription of Sethos h, commemorating a victory. Beside
it are very early graffiti of elephants, giralfes, etc.

The mountains on the E. bank presently retire, leaving room
for a strip of cultivated land. Numerous siilgiyehs or water-wheels
are seen. - 30 M. Geneineh (El-Geneina; E. bank); 33% M.

bank here, 7 M. from the river, a large force of dervishes was

river, and the banks often rise steeply from the water. The large
ruined building on the W. bank was, perhaps, a storehouse dating
