to Aswan. EL-XIV,. 21. Route. 635

to the right of the door is lihamweset, in presence of Ramses IL, his
father, in eonimeutoration of the king's iil'th jubilee, in the 4ist year of
his reign. Another hieroglyphic inscription here ('In the 13th year of his
majesty, lord of the world, Napoleon IH.') is certainly the latest in Egypt,
with the exception of that added to Celebrate'king Henri V.' (i.e. Count
Chambord). On the pavement outside the chapel representations of foot-
prints have been scratched by pilgrims (see below).

The representations within the Chamber have retained their colouring
in good condition. On each side of the entrance, Amenophis 111. and his
father Thutrnosis IV. seated at banquet-tables. Left Wall. Amenophis III.
saerithointg tn the sacred boat, which is decorated with falcons' heads;
Amenophis Ill. presenting incense and water to Nekhheyet; Amen (blue)
embracing the king and holding the hieroglyph for'life' to the kiug's
nose. Rear Wall. On each side of the recess, Auienophis III. sacrificing
to Nekhbeyet. Right Wall. The falcon-headed Horus handing the hiero-
.g1yph for'life' to the king, who stands before him; the king presenting
two wine-jars to Nekhbeyet; the king sacrificing, to the sacred boat.
Adjacent are demotic inscriptions in red, written by visitors to the chapel.
The names of Amen0phis alternating with heads of Hathor are arranged
.as a frieze in this hall and as an embellishment on the architrave; at
the base of the walls are bulls in a marsh.

Turning at this little temple we direct our steps towards the Nile
and in 1/4 hr. reach the R001; TEMPLE, on the right side of the val-
ley, recognizable from a distance by the Stair leading up to it. The
latter consists of 41 steps hewn in the rock, with a massive bal-
ustrade on each side. The temple, dedicated to Nekhbeyet, was con-
structed under Ptolemy IN. Euergetes II. (Physkor (), and provided
with reliefs and inscriptions by him and by Ptolemy X. Soter 11.

On reaching the platform at the top of the stair we pass through a
doorway to a Vestibule, not quite 33 ft. wide, which was supported by
columns with elaborate floral capitals, while the exterior sides were
bounded by stone Screens built between columns. Thence another door, the
right half of which is still standing, leads into a smaller Hall (only 20ft.
wide), which also was bounded by screens between columns. The floor
is covered with ruins. Behind this is the Rock CHAMBER. This chamber"
which was originally a tumb-ehumher dating from the New Empire. has
a vaulted ceiling, with vultures hovering in the centre. At the top of the
walls is a frieze made of the name of Ptolemy N. between heads of
Hathor. Below are inscriptions and much injured representations of the
king and queen before various deities.

On an isolated hill, about 1 M. from the steamboat landing-place,
are a number of *ROCK Tosuvs, placed side by side on the S. slope.
Most of these date from the end of the Middle Empire or from the
beginning of the New Empire. There are 31 tombs in all, but only
6 repay a visit. These tombs, like all the monuments at El-li√©b, are
of small dimensions, but their distinct pictures of ancient Egyptian
domestic life will interest even those, travellers who have already
seen the tombs of Benihasan (p. 227) and Sheikh'Abd el-Kuma
(p. 309).

We first enter the tomb of Peheri (Pehrdi), nomarch of El-kilo,
which is conspicuous by its wide opening. It dates from the reign of
Thutmosis 111., and is distinguished by a series of representations
from the life of the deceased, with well-preserved colouring.

In front of the entrance is a platform in which is the opening of a
deep mummy-shaft. We enter the vaulted Toms by a maeh damaged door.
