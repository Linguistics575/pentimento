DAM 0F ASSUAN. N. Route. 371

Biggeh was the site also of the famous sanctumy of Abaton, with a
tomb of Osiris (comp. p. cxliv ]. Active travellers are recommended
to climb to the top of one of the rocks ofBiggeh, fer the sake of the
remarkable view over the whole cataract district.

The rocky islets off the N. end of Philas, now called Konosso
('great roek'), were formerly the S. limit of Egypt [ see p. 380).
They are new generally submerged. The islets contain numerous
roek-iuseriptions, among which the carteuches of Psammetiehos ll.
are conspicuous on a massive double rock.

The Nile Dam at Agsuirm

Those who wish to visit the Dam only may go by the sherter route
described at p. 363, and return by the rather longer route along the bank.

The *Dam of Assudn (Barrage, Arab. Es-Sadd, Le.'the Dam', er
El-Ehasutn, i.e.'the Reservoir'), built in 1898-1902 below Phila, is
the largest structure of the kind in the world and ranks among the
most wonderful sights ofEgypt. It was constructed in erder to dam
up the water of the Nile so that a regular supply could be furnished
during time of low water. By this means the country can be regularly
irrigated all the year round, and many irrigation canals that used
formerly to run dry periodically now receive a constant supply of
water. l'pwards of 500,000 acres were added in 1002 to the. area of
land cultivable in summer, and it is estimated that this increased the
national wealth by 15,000,000l. The dam is built of granite blocks
brought from the old quarries at Assuén (p. 356) and runs straight
across the river-channel for a distance of 2150 yds. (11/4 M.). The
original height of the dam was 130 ft. above the foundation, While
its thickness varied from 23 ft. at the top to 98 ft. at the bottom.
In 1907-12, however, it was raised about 101/2 ft. higher and its thick-
ness increased by about as much; so that the storage-lake formed
above the dam has new a capacity of 2,420,000,000 cubic métres
(instead of 980,000,000), a depth, when full, of 88 ft. (instead
of 65 ft.), and an extent upstream of 185 M. (instead of 140 M.).
The masonry is penetrated by 180 sluice gates for regulating the
flow of the water. These include 14010wer sluices (each measuring
23 M 01/2 ft.) for the distribution of the water and 40upper sluices
(each 61/2 M 11 ft.) to permit the escape of surplus water. The iron
gates of the sluices ('Stoney patent') are regulated by the help of
electrical winches standing on the top of the dam. When the Nile
commences to rise at the beginning ofJuly all the sluices are opened.
After the end of November, when practically all the suspended
mud has passed through and the water has become comparatively
clear, the gates are gradually closed, one after the other in regular
order. The lake above the darn is thus formed and becomes quite
full about Feb. ilst. When the want of water in Egypt begins to be
noticeable (about the om) of March) the quantity required for culti-
