386 LUWElt NUBIA.

Nubia continued to be a dependency of the Pharaohs until about
1100 B.0. But when the power of Egypt waned under the 21st Dyu.
(p. civ) Nubia shook off her allegiance and a native ETHIOPIAN
MONARCHY was established, with Napata as its capital (p. MO). But
the civilization of this kingdom continued to be Egyptian; and its
monarchs, who were dependent on the priests, regarded themselves
as the true protectors of the Egyptian religion and as the legitimate
rulers of Eg, ypt. About 730 B.0. the Ethiopian Piankhi (p. civ)
temporarily overran all Egypt, and shortly afterwards an Ethiopian
dynasty (the25th; p. cv) established itself firmly on the Egyptian
throne. But in little more than a century (about 66313.0.) these
Kthiopian Pharaohs were forced to give way before the Assyrians,
and their kingdom was restricted to Nubia, of which the N. border
then lay near Philie (Kouosso, p. 371).

The Egyptian civilization gradually declined in Nubia. The
Egyptian hieroglyphic writing became corrupted and a native Mero'i-
tic hieroglyphic and cursive character was developed (p. cxxxi),
which, about the beginning of the Christian era, began to be used
for writing the native Nubian language even in offieial documents.
About 600 13.0. the royal residence was transferred from Napata to
Meroé' Cp. 422), which lay farther to the S. Comparatively full
information has come down to us concerning the earlier kings who
dwelt at Meroé. We know also of the unsuccessful campaign of the
army of Psammetichos If. against Lower Nubia (about 590 15.0.) and
of the attempts of Cmnbyses (525 B.0.) to conquer lithioPia, which
were foiled mainly by the energetic Ethiopian King Nastcsen.
After that an almost impenetrable veil falls over the history of the
country.

During the PTOLEMAIC AND ROMAN IMPERIAL EPocns the S.
boundary of Egypt was near Hierasykaminos (p. 397), and it was
occasionally pushed farther S. as far as Primis (p. 402). On the
other hand the Nubians sometimes succeeded in extending their
power as far N. as Phila, and perhaps even occupied part of Upper
Egypt. When the Romans first came to Egypt Ethiopia was gov-
erned by a succession of queens named Candace. One of these
attacked the Roman province, but Was repulsed by the Roman gov-
ernor Petronius in 23 13.0. The Ethiopian kingdom seems soon
afterwards to have fallen into disorder and to have split up into a
number of small principalities. About this time also the Elem-
myes, a nomadic race of the E. desert, who had previously acknow-
ledged the suzerainty of Ethiopia, assumed an aggressive attitude.
Not content with harassing the N. parts of Lower Nubia, they car-
ried their depredations also into the Roman territory in S. Egypt,
until finally the Romans gave way before them. Diocletian (about
300 A.D.) withdrew from Nubia altogether, retiring within the
bounds of Egypt proper, to the N. of Phila. The Blemmyes, how-
ever, in alliance with the Nubians, continued their attacks 011 Upper
