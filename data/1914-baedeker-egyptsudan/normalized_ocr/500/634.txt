to the left is Men' 8 son Bek, chief architect at Tell eI-'Amarna (p. iiii',
before the tigure (defaced) of Amenophis IV., upon which the sun'g rays
descend.

0n the hill above the Cataract Hotel is Fort Tagug, whence a
beautiful view is enjoyed, especially towards evening. Visitors
should prolong their walk along the hill, to the S., for the sake of
the views of the Nile valley, the islands, and the dam, and descend,
to the right, to the village of El-Mrlia.t.ta (p. 363).

A ride (donkey or carr. there and back 5 pies.) may be taken to
the CAMP or THE BISHABiN, situated within an Arab cemetery, 3/4 M.
to the E. of the town. These Beduins with their families live in
wretched tents covered with mats. Beduins of the'Abtbdeh tribe,
differing both in type and dress from the Bishtrin, also have tents
here. Both tribes speak a curious language, allied to Egyptian and
other E. African dialects. They support th emselves by cattle-rearing
and by trading, especially with senna-leaves, which they collect in
the desert and sell at good prices. - A fine *View is commanded
by the Tomb of Shaikh Harlin, above the camp, to the right.

We may return vit the ancient ARAB CEMETERIES, which are
situated in the desert to the S. of the railway. From the railway
station these may be reached via the Sherir esh-Shelltl. Each grave
was marked by a rectangle of unhewn stones and a slab bearing an
inscription. The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections.

On the hills to the right of the road are some large mesque- -like
Cenotaphs of famous saints, such as the Sheikh Ma1srni'ld, the Sheikh'Ali,

the L-1dy (Seiyideh) Zeinab, etc., whose memory is celebrated by festivals
on their birthdays Jiiiiiiri,' etc.

The Granite Quarries (Arab. MrliOir), from which the ancient
Egyptian builders and sculptors drew their supplies (comp. p. 354),
are situated in the hills to the S., and may be reached in 1/4 hr. either
direct from the Bishirin camp or from the town by a route leading
vii the Arab cemeteries (see above) and then to the E., passing
a grove of tamarisks. Numerous blocks of granite lie where they
were left when the works were given up; thy. the huge block (marked
'Obelisk' on the Map) in the N. Quarry, measuring 92 ft. in length
and 101/; ft. in breadth at the broadest part. A moderately lofty
cliff shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient stone-
cutters. The blocks were detached from the cliffs by boring nu-
merous holes along a prescribed line, driving wedges into these, and
then wetting the wedges. By this process tolerably smooth and
even fractures were obtained. Frequently the blocks were finished
On three sides before being finally detached. Statues, sarcophagi,
obelisks, etc., were also roughly dressed by the stone-cutters in the
quarries in order to lessen the weight for transport. The hill above
the N. quarry commands a wide prospect, including the convent of
St. Simeon (p. 361) in a desert-valley, to the W., beyond the Nile.
h massive Causeway, by which the huge blocks were conveyed to
the Nile, runs from the quarries to Assuin and is used to this day.
