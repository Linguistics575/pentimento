268 Route 20. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Karnak:

From the court of the Temple ofRamses we pass through the E.
door to the Portico of the Bubastides, situated at the S.E. corner of
the great court. This portico was embellished with reliefs and in-
scriptions by the kings of the 22nd Dynasty.

The following reliefs may be particularized. To the left (E.; on the
projecting wall), above: Amen hands King Osorkon I. the curved sword
and the palm-branch (symbol of long life); below: Khnum holds the hiero-
glyph for'life' to the king's nose; Hathor gives milk to the king, -Right
(W.) Wall: Takelothis II. and his son Osorkon, the high-priest of Amen,
before Amen. Below is a long inscription.

We return to the great court and proceed to the dilapidated -

Second Pylon of Ramses I. The tower on the right, with f'our
long grooves for the tlag-staffs, has been freed from the ruins of
later buildings.whieh were erected in front of it out of the materials
of a temple of the heretical period (comp. p. oii). The left tower is
to be laid bare later. In the centre is the huge portal. On the S.
side of the right tower appears Ramses II. defeating his foes in pre-
sence of Amen. In front of the portal was a kind of small Vestibute,
the entrance to which was flanked by two statues of Ramses II. The
figure on the right side still stands; only the legs of the other figure
remain. In the doorway, where the cartouches of Ramses 1., Sethos L,
and Ramses II. are found, an intervening door was erected by Pttr.
lemy VI. Philometor and Ptolemy IX. Eiaergetes IL, during theirjoint
reign. The lintel of this doorway is wanting, but the jambs are in
good preservation, with reliefs showing the king sacrificing to the
gods of the temple. On the inner side (left) of the earlier doorway,
at the foot, are the sacred boat of Amon and the king entering the
temple. In the second row from the foot appears Ramses II. kneeling
before Amon and holding the symbol of jubilee, indicative of long
reign. Behind stands the goddess Mut, whilekhons, with the moon's
disk on his head, conducts Philometor to behold the god Amon. Prob-
ably the representation is a restoration by Philometor of an older work
on the same spot. The other rows exhibit the king in presence of
various deities. - We next enter the -... -.-

**Great Hypostyle Hall, which was justly considered one of the
wonders of the world. It has recently been restored and freed from
rubbish by the Egyptian Service des Antiquit√©s, under the direction
of M. Legrain. Though a certain picturesque effect due to the former
ruinous condition has necessarily been lost, the huge hall is still
extraordinarily impressive as we look southwards from the N. side
through the rows of columns. This is especially the case in the
morning or evening, or by moonlight, when the columns east pi-
tense black shadows.

The breadth of this great hall is 338 ft., its depth 170 ft., and
its area 6000 sq. yds., an area spacious enough to accommodate the
entire church of Notre Dame at Paris. The roof was supported by
134 columns arranged in 16 rows, of which the two central rows
