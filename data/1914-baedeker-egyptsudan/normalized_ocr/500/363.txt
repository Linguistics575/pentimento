mark the ancient -

Site of Memphis.

Were it not for the vast Neeropolis to the W. of the ancient
city, no one would imagine that one of the most famous and pop-
ulous capitals of antiquity had once stood here. The Egyptians,
from the earliest period down to the Roman imperial epoch, built
their private houses of large sun-dried bricks of Nile mud, reserv-
ing, better material, such as limestone, sandstone, or granite, for
palaces and temples. But even the public buildings of Memphis
have almost disappeared, as the stones were early carried off to build
other mlifises elsewhere. Excavations have been going on here
since 1008 under Prof. Flinders Petrie.

llls'rom'. The story of Memphis stretches hack to the beginning of
Egyptian history. According to a very probable tradition, Memes, the
first historical ruler in Egypt, is said to have founded the'White walls'
of a fortress in a reclaimed district on the borders between the two
ancient kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt fy, xcix), in order to keep
the conquered inhabitants of Lower Egypt in subjection. To the S.
of this he is said to have built also the temple of Ptah trrephtesurO, the
patron-god of the city. The new settlement rapidly became of importance;
it was made the capital of a separate district, and the kings of the early
dynasties sometimes planted their court here. Under the (5th Dyn. a new
quarter was founded, in which King Phiops I. lixed the residence of his
court and near which the scpulchral pyramid of the ruler was situated.
