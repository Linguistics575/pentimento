the doors, is a tlne relief: Philometor, clad in a white mantle and
accompanied by Cleopatra, stands before the falcon-headed moon-
god Khons, who writes the name of the king upon a palm-branch,
from which hangs the symbol for length of life; behind are Sobek
and Haroéris, the chief gods of Ombos.

Two doors lead from Antechamber III to the two SANCTUARIES, of
which that to the left (Pl. H) was dedicated to Haroérie, that to the
right (Pl. S) to Sobek. In each is a pedestal of black granite on which
the sacred boat with the image of the god was placed. Beside and
behind these sanctuaries are smaller apartments with crypts.

Two small side-doors lead from the pronaos to an INNER PASS-
AGE round the temple proper, at the innermost part of which are
seven doors opening into as many Chustmorts (Pl. I-Vll). These
contain unfinished reliefs and inscriptions, which are interesting
011 account of their various stages of eorripletion. In the central
room (Pl. 1V) is a staircase to the upper story.

On the terrace in front of the great temple lies a small Birth
House, facing towards the S.E., and now in a most ruinous con-
dition. It was built or restored by Euergetes 11. Among the extant
reliefs one (at Pl. o) deserves notice. It represents Euergetes II.
with two gods sailing in a boat through the marshes, which are
bordered with papyrus-plants thronged with birds; to the left is the
ithyphallie god Min-Amon-Wi. - On the S. side is a st1bter-.
ranean staircase (P1. p) leading to the river, on the bank of which
is a nilometer (much damaged), like that at Edfu.

Finally we visit the small unfinished CHAPEL OF HATHOR, built
of red sandstone under the Emp. Domitian. In one of its rooms
are mummies of sacred crocodiles found in the vicinity.

The terrace in front of the temple commands a beautiful *View
of the Nile and the districts on the W. bank, while from the rubbish-
mounds beside the temple we may survey the new irrigated region
beside Iitrn Ombo, the villages of Shath and Daraw, the island of
Mansitrtrsh, and the desert to the W.

Above K6m Ombo the channel of the river narrows. - Daraw
a railway station (p. 341), lies on the E. bank. - On the W. bank,
near Rakdbeh, are the ruins of the ancient Contra-Ombos.

The scenery becomes tamer beyond the village of A5abdn'lyeli, 011
the W. bank, near which are early-Egyptian cemeteries.

Opposite rises the Gebcl et-f.Tammtm, with quarries which
yielded stone for the old temple at Ombes as early as the reign of
Hatshepsut (/18th Dyn.). To the W. the yellow sand of the desert
often extends right down to the river. At El-8lta.i.t8ra (railway
station, p. 341) granite appears for the first time.

We now pass the large and well-tilled island of Eahr't/' (p. 362),
with its palm-groves and fields. Opposite, near Et- Wiireytb, on the
W. bank, are some quarries (with graffiti).

As we approach Assain (E. bank) the scene presented to us is
