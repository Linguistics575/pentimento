lay a second temple, which, however, was entirely destroyed in the
latter half of the 19th century. To theW. is a Mohammedan cemetery
of an early period, with many Cufle inscriptions. On the hill above
is a castellated building.

Beyond Tafeh the dark shining rocks advance close to both river
banks, forming a kind of rocky gateway, known as the BER) el-
Kaldluyheli. At a few isolated points a narrow strip of cultivated
land with palms borders the river; and on the E. bank lies a small
village. The navigation of this reach is somewhat intricate, owing
to the numerous rocky islands. At the point where the valley 8S-
pands again lies a small island, with some mined buildings.

31M. KaldbsheMKalabsha) forms a large commune on both banks
of the Nile .--.- From hniarytrn, a small village on the W. bank, a
desert-route leads round the Bib el-Kali/heh to Tafeh (p. 388).
On this route, about / M. from the village, is a rock-inseription,
dating from the 10th year of King Taharka (p. cv). About 11/4 M.
farther on, 011 a small plateau, is the ruined church of Sitteh Gasma,
built of rough stones.

Hard by the river, as we proceed to the s., lie the ruins of the
ancient town of Talrnis. Closely hemmed in by modern houses
appears the large and picturesque -

*Temple of Ealkbisheh, built in the reign of Augustus on the
site of an earlier sanctuary founded by Amenophis II. and refonnded
by one of the Ptolemies. It was never completely adorned with
reliefs and inscriptions; and the reliefs that are finished are very
crude, while the subjects of the representations are frequently
misunderstood. The temple was probably dedicated in the first place
to the god Mandulis (p. 366), to whom are addressed most of the
dedicatory inscriptions to he found on the pylons, the walls of the
vestibule, and elsewhere. It was converted into a church on the
introduction of Christianity. The building is in comparatively good
preservation and has recently been restored.

The approach to the temple (comp. the Plan, p. 390) is formed
by a Causeway, about 100 ft. long and 25 ft. broad, constructed of
hewn stones and still in excellent preservation. At the end next
the river is a rectangular projection, below which passes a road; at
the landward end a flight of low steps ascends to a long and narrow
platform immediately in front of the pylon.

The PYLON (Pl. AA), the principal entrance to the temple-pre-
eincts, stands at a slight angle with the axis of the temple and
causeway. Only the top of it has been destroyed, but it has no reliefs
whatever, with the exception of two representations of gods in the
doorway. Each tower of the pylon has a groove for a flag-staff
comp. p. 344).

The COURT (P1. B), between the pylon and the vestihnle, "as
surrounded on three sides by colonnades, of which four columns
(with rich floral capitals) on each side (N. and S.) are now erei-t.
