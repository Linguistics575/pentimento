116 Route 5. M0ly" AT'.l'AM. Environs

From the Bib el-Kar√©feh the AQUEDUCT (Arab. El-Kandtir), built
by Sultan El-Ghilri and formerly ascribed to Saladiu, runs in a wide
sweep towards the Nile (see p. 104). It supplied the citadel with
water before the construction of the new water-works.

3. The Mohattam Hills.

An excursion to the Mohattam Hills is best made from the citadel (tram
ways Nos. 2, 6, and 13, to the Place Saladin, see p. 38). The route from
the Tombs of the Caliphs is to be avoided on account of the intolerable
dust. The excursion may be combined with the visit to the smaller Petrified
Forest in the manner indicated at p. IN. The View is one of the most
beautiful that Egypt has to offer, and no energetic traveller should be
satisfied with the substitutes afforded by the citadel (near the mosque of
Mohammed Ali, see p. 69) or the Windmill Hills (p. ilk). It is best at
sunset or in the morning between 8 and 9 o'clock. A visit at the time of
the full moon is attractive also.

From the Citadel (p. 68) the route ascends in an almost straight
direction, passing through the Btl, cl-G'ebel (P1. F, (r, p.'70) and
over the railway-bridge. About 1/2 hr. brings us to the top.

The Mohattam or Moqattam Hills (666 ft. high), to the E. of
Cairo, also called Gebel Gigashi, after the conspicuous mosque situat-
ed on the summit, belong to the great range of nummulitie lime-
stone mountains which extend from N.W. Africa, across Egypt and
India, to China. This nummulite formation is one of the eoeene, or
oldest deposits of the tertiary period. It yields a favourite building-
stone, and there are numerous quarries on the slopes of the hills.

Nummulitic limestone is remarkably rich in fossils, the chiefmass of
which consists of millions of nummulites or rhizopods of the polythala-
mia group. The larger kinds are about an inch and a half in diameter
and the smaller about 1/5 inch. They are frequently seen also in the
stones of the Pyramids, part of the material for which was taken from
the quarries of the Mohattam. The quarries yield also a profusion ofsea-
urchins (clypeaster, cidaris, echinolampas, ete.), various kinds of bivalves
{ including many oysters), cerithium, ovula, strombus, nerita, turritella,
nautilus, sharks, teeth, and bones of the halicore. Beautiful crystals of
isinglass-stone and of strontian also occur.

The wVIEW from the top is magnificent and in a good light is
finer than any other in the neighbourhood of Cairo. The citadel,
the mosque of Mohammed Ali, and the grand burial-grounds of the
desert form a noble foreground; the venerable Nile dotted with its
lateen sails flows below us in its quiet majesty; to the W., on the
borders of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous
old Pyramids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. The thousand
minarets of the city and the citadel are then also tinted with a
delicate rosy hue. A still more varied view is commanded by a
steep projection to the S. of the mosque, the foreground being
especially picturesque, while the horizon to the S. seems more open
and tempts our fancy to visit the wonders of Upper Egypt.

The Giyiitshi Mosque, one of the oldest in Cairo, was built in
1085, during the Fatimite period, by the Emir Badr el-thrmtli, the
grand vizier of Sultan El-Mustansir. According to tradition he
