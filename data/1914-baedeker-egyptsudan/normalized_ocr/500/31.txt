perative tone. At the same time it must be admitted that the in-
creasing number of visitors to Egypt tends to raise prices during
the chief travelling season, so that a larger bakshish than is men-.
tioned in the Handbook may sometimes be necessary.

While much caution and firmness are desirable in dealing with
the people, it need hardly be added that the traveller should avoid
being too exacting or suspicious. He should hear in mind that
many of the natives with whom he comes in contact are mere
children, whose demands should excite amusement rather than
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliness
of disposition. The native communities hold together with remark-
able faithfulness, and the bond of a common religion, which takes
the place of'party' in other countries, and requires its adherents
to address each other as'yd akho2ya' (my brother), is far more than
a mere name. On the other hand, intimate acquaintance with 0rien-
tals is to be avoided, especially with the dragomans, who sometimes
presume on their opportunities of social intercourse (comp. below).
In Lower Egypt travellers can usually make themselves understood
in French or Italian; in Upper Egypt English is more useful.
A good deal can usually be done by signs.

Notwithstanding all the suggestions we have ventured to offer,
the traveller will to some extent have to buy his experience. In
most cases the overcharges to which he will be exposed will be
comparatively trifling; but if extortion is attempted on a larger
scale he had better refer the matter to his consul or the police.

For the tours described in this book the services of a Drageman
[ .Arah. Turgumcin) may easily be dispensed with, evenby those less
accustomed to travelling. They are useful, however, for those who
wish to see as much as possible in a very short time. Only well
recommended dragomans should he engaged, preferably those for
whom the hotels assume some responsibility. They must he treated
from the first as servants and all familiarity should be discouraged.
The dragomans are with few exceptions quite uneducated, without
the least knowledge of the historic er msthetie significance of the
monuments; and their'explanations' of them are only too often
merely garbled versions of what they have picked up from guide-
books or from the remarks of previous travellers.

Those who wish to make long tours in the desert or hunting
excursions are advised to consult residents learned in these matters.
The teurist-agents also can sometimes give good advice, and the,
necessary outfit (tents, kitchen utensils, etc.) may be bought or
hired through them. - For sporting and other expeditions in the
Anglo-Egyptian St1dtn, see pp. 417, 418.

On the successful termination of thejourney travellers are too apt
from motives of good nature to write a more favourable testimonial for
their dragoman than he really deserves; but this is truly an act of in-

justice to his subsequent employers. The testimonial therefore should
not omit to mention any serious cause for dissatisfaction.
