68 Route d. CAIRO. 3. oSouth-Eaetern

To the S.E. of the mosque of Sultan Hasan extends the large
*Place Saladin (Middn Saladin; Pl. E, (l, 7), the finest square in the
city, at Viscount Kitehener's instigation formed in 1913 out of the
Place Rumeileh and Place M ohammed Ali by the demolition of several
small streets and buildings. At the N. end of the Place, on slightly
elevated ground, stand two mosques, the dei' el-j1falyntdtveh and
the Gtrnir Emir Akhér (P1. E, (O. On the E. side rises the citadel
(see below), with the Bitt, cl-'Azab (P1. E,0), flanked with its huge
towers. Along the E. side of the Place extends the Shtrrf Mastabet
el-Mahmal; in its S. part is the Stilt el-fray', the scene of a busy
afternoon market. Here also take place the festivities on the depart-
ure of the Mecca Caravan (comp. pp. xcvi, xcvii). At the S. end
of the Place are the Prison and, farther on, the gate named BCsh el-
Iiart1feh (P1.E,7). - Taking the Shtm" Dstyir er-Rifri, which leads
round the Gimir Itiftfiyeh to the square mentioned on p. 66, we
see on the right, on a rocky hill, the small Géhar Mosque (P1. E, 6).

From the N.E. corner of the Place Saladin the citadel is ap-
proached by the Shari' el-Mahgar, a earriage-roail, and then by the
winding Shtri' Bib eI-Gedid, whith a view of the Tombs of the
Caliphs (to the left). Foot-passengers ascend by the Shari' ed-
Defterkhineh, passing the Government Archives (Defterkhinehi
Pl. E, F, 6), built by Mohammad Ali in 1828, or, quitting the
Place Saladin by the Bib el-'Azab (see above), proceed straight on
by a narrow and crooked lane, enclosed by lofty walls. It was in
this lane, formerly the chief approach to the citadel, that the mas-
sacre of the Mamelukes took place on March 1st, 1811, by order of
Mohammed Ali (p. cxxi) Amin Bey, the only one who survived, is
said to have escaped by making his horse leap into the moat.

The Citadel (El-Kal'a; Pl. E, F, 6) was built in 1179 by
Saladin (p. 45), with stones taken, according to the very credible
statements of Arabian historians, from the small pyramids at Gizeh.
Of the original structure, however, nothing new remains except the
outer E.wa11 and a few towers in the interior. Although the fortress
commands the city, it is itself commanded by the heights of the
Mokattam, rising above it immediately to the S.; thus in 1805 Mo-
hammed Ali was enabled, by means of a battery planted on the Gebel
Giytishi (p. 116), to compel Khurshid Pasha to surrender the Citadel.
- We enter the outer court of the Citadel by the Btib el-Gedid
CPI. F, tr,'New Gate'), and then pass through the Bdb el-Mrasttrni
('Middle Gate') into the main court, where the Alabaster Mosque
rises in front of us, with the Err-Fir Mosque to the left.

The *triunir Mohammed'Ali (P1. E, F, (r, tickets, see p. 43;
slippers i pias.), or'Alabaster Mosque', the lofty and graceful
minarets of which are so conspicuous from a distance as to form
one of the landmarks of Cairo, was begun by Mohammad Ali, the
founder of the present Egyptian dynasty, on the site of a palace
which was blown up in 1824; and in 1857 it was completed in its
