whole neeropolis has been repeatedly explored by the Byzantines
and the Caliphs, as well as by modern explorers.

On a hill close to the fl, is el-0isr lie the ruins of the large
Convent of St. Jeremiah, resembling; a deserted village. T hey were
excavated in'1007-0 by J. E. Quibell for the Egyptian authorities.
The convent, founded in the second half of the 5th cent. and de-
stroyr-d by the Arabs about 060, includes two churches, a refeetOry,
a bake-house, oil-press, winc-eellars, etc. The cell of St. Jeremiah
also is preserved. Many of the monks' cells have remained intact,
each with a recess in the E. wall, which served as an oratory and
was sometimes adorned with paintings of the Madonna, the arch-
angels, and the founder of the convent. These paintings, like the,
fine capitals and reliefs from the churches, are now in the museum
at Cairo (comp. p. 89 ]. On the walls are numerous Coptic and
Arabic inscriptions. The tombstones embedded in the pavement
were brought from the convent-eenietery. The best general survey
is obtained from the rubbish-heap.

From this convent we ride to the N.W., straight towards the
Step Pyramid.

The *Step Pyramid of b'alilsira (Arab. Et-Hurum el-gUttdarrag,
Le.'the pyramid provided with stops'; Comp. the illustration on
[ t, t'lxix'), a very conspicuous feature in the landscape, may be
regarded as the'0ognizanee of Salilrira'. it was tlw tomb of the
ancient king Zoser (3rd Dyn.) and is one of the oldest stone
buildings in ligypt that hare come down to our days. The pyramid
consists of six stages, the lowest of which is about 371/2 ft. in height,
the next 36 ft., the third 341/4 ft., the fourth 321/2 ft., the fifth
303/4 ft., and the sixth 29 ft., while each stage recedes about 61/2 ft.
as compared with the one below. The perpendicular height is
200 ft. For the graduated construction, comp. p.clxix. The pyramid
is built of an inferior clayey limestone quarried in the neighbour-
hood. The original entrance was on the N. side, at the foot of the
lowest step. The interior (inaccessible) contains a complicated
series of passages and chambers, which, however, are due to
treasure-hunters and to later attempts at restoration; for the orig-
inal construction of King Zoser had only one sloping entranee-shaft
(Pl. a b, p. clxix), with ramps at the sides, and a single tomb-cham-
her (Pl. b). The pyramid is seldom climbed as the stone of which
it is composed is very friable, but the top commands an interesting
view.--- There are still some remains of the stone wall that en-
closed. the pyramid; it was decorated with door-shap'ed ornaments.

About 300 yds. to the S.W. of the Step Pyramid is the Pyramid
of Onnos (p. 165). Beyond the Step Pyramid, in the direction of
Mariette's House, a striking view opens towards the N. In the fore-
ground lies the green valley of the Nile, bordered by palm-trees,
and framed on both sides with the yellowish-grey desert; in the
distance the alabaster mosque of Mohammed Ali at Cairo. On the
