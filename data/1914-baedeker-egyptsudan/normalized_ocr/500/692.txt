the 34th year of the reign of Ramses H., commemorating the mar-
riage of the Pharaoh with the daughter of the King of the Hittites,
who was brought to Egypt by her father. At the top the king appears
seated between two gods beneath a canopy, while the prince of the
Hittites and his daughter worship him. - The space between the
southernmost colossus and the face of the cliff has been converted
into a small open Court (P1. f) by the erection of a doorway. 0n the
W. wall of the court is a long poetic inscription placei here by
Ramses II. - In the space between the northernmost colossus
(Pl. d) and the face of the cliff, on the W. wall, is a large memorial
inscription, also erected by llamses IL, and representing him in
the presence of' Itg-llarakhte.

In Court f is the tomb of Major Tidswell, a British officer who died
in 1884, during the Nile Expedition.

The terrace is adjoiued on tho N. by an OPEN COURT dedicated
by Ramses li. to the worship of the sun, which was excavated in
1000. The walls surrounding it rise on the E. side to form a sort of
pylon. To the left of the entrance is a memorial inscription of
Ramses II, on which he. is represented burning incense to the gods
Amon-RE, Mut, Wé-lfarakhte, Seth, and the Asiatic Astarte. In
the court are two pedestals with concave corniccs. On the one on
the s., to which steps ascend, stood four cyr1oeephali; the one on
the N. bore a chapel containing the images of a searabmus (the sun-
god Khepre) and of a cynocephalus (the moon-god Thout; see p. 87).
On the N. wall of the court we see the boat of the sun, in which

lamses is sacrificing; to Rri-llarakhte.

The FAgAnE, which here represents the pylon of the ordinary
temples, is crowned by a concave cornice, above which is a row of
cyntwephali worshipping, the rising sun. Within the cornice are the
cartouches of' Ramses 11., surrounded by Uraeus-serpeuts, and inter-
rupted by figures of Amon (to the left) and lui-Harald; (to the
right). Then follows the dedication-inscription of the king to
Amon-Ré and RE-IIarakhte, In a niche above the ENTRANCE DOOR
(P1. si) the przenomen of the king is represented by large figures
in low relief, amongst which that of the falcon-headed sun-god is
conspicuous. To the right and left the king presents an image of
Maat to this god and to his own deified name. On the lintel of the
door Ramses is shown laying the foundation-stone of the temple
before Amon and Met, on the left, and before Itg-Harakhte and
the lion-headed Wert-hekew, on the right. Within the portal a
smaller doorway was built by Ramses II.

We now enter the rock-temple, the interior of which measures
about 180 ft. from the threshold to the back of the innermost cham-
ber. The first room, the Great Hypostyle Hall (P1. B), correspond-
ing to the open court with covered eolonnades in temples built in
the open air, is 54 ft. broad and 58 ft. deep. The ceiling is snp-
ported by sight square pillars, against which stand Osiris-figures of
