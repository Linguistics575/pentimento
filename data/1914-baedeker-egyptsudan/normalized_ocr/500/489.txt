DENDERA. M. Route. 245

Dendera, the Tenigra of the Greeks, is one of the most ancient
and most famous cities of Egypt, and was the capital of the sixth
nome of Upper Egypt. Its ancient name was Enct, or Enei-te-ntiire,
'Enet of the Goddess' (i.e. of Hathor), of which the Greek and mod-
ern Arabic names are corruptions. Enet was the chief seat of the
worship of Hathor (the Egyptian Aphrodite), goddess of love and
joy. Along with her husband, the falcon-headed Horns of Edfu,
and her son, the youthful Ehi or Har-sem-tem, CHorus, uniter of
both lands'; Cr. Harsomtus; comp. p. 344), she was worshipped in
the magnificent temple which remains here to this day. Her chief
festival synchronized with the great feast of the New Year.

The gate, to which our road leads and where the cards of ad-
mission (pee p. 200) are shown, forms the N. termination of the
wall of Nile bricks enclosing the temple. The total enclosure is
317 yds. long and 306 yds. wide, and besides the large Temple
of Hathor contains a small Temple of Isis and a so-called Birth
House o. 250). The N. Gate was built under the Emp. Domitian,
who is here named Germanicus. On the side next the temple
appear the names of Nerva and Trajanus, also with the epithet of
Germanicus (Trajan is here also called Dacicus). There is another
similar gate (now much sanded up) on the E. side; while beyond
the temple-precincts, also to the E., is a third gate, dating from
the Roman Imperial epoch. - Straight in front of the N. gate
lies the -

"Temple of Hathor, the orientation of which is practically N.
and S. Though still partly buried in the accumulated rubbish of
centuries, this temple is in better preservation than any other an-
cient Egyptian temple except those of Edfu and Phila. It was
built in the first century n.0, during the reigns of the later Ptolemies
and of Augustus; but it occupies the site of an older edifice, going
back traditionally to the period of the Ancient Empire, and added
to or altered not only by the kings of the 12th Dyn., but also by
the great monarchs of the New Empire, such as Thutmosis IH.,
Ramses IL, and Ramses III. The decoration of the temple-walls
with reliefs went on to a still more recent date. In accordance
with the plan of other temples (comp. Plan of Edfu, p. 344) a.
colonnade and two large pylons should stand in front of the great
vestibule; but perhaps the means to add these were not forth-
coming. If we compare the temple of Dendera with a similar struc-
ture of the earlier period, such as the temple of Abydos (p. 238)
or the great national sanctuary of Karnak (p.'265), we tind it not
less beautiful in its own way, though of course far from competing
with these gigantic structures in magnifieenee or extent. Its chief
characteristics are a fine symmetry of proportions and dignified adap-
tation to its purposes. Neither the figures nor the inscriptions
sculptured on the walls compare in masterly execution with those
in the tombs of the Ancient Empire or with those in temples dating
