Room V, the main chamber, contains the Granite Sarcophagus of the
King, which is 101/2 ft. long, 7 ft. broad, and 8 ft. high, and is adorned
with inscriptions and designs. On the Left Walls are shown the firu two
chapters of the'Book of the Gates' (p. 284). Chapter 1
(beginning at the left of the entrance) shows the portal
guarded by the serpent Senekht. Next follows the first

T G, region of the underworld. In the middle floats the boat,

if l in which the Iam-headed sun-god stands beneath a canopy
-l, La with a coiled serpent above it; before him kneels the
"king, presenting to him an image of the goddess of truth.
. Cl Four inhabitants of the underworld tow the boat by a
cord, while various gods come to meet it. In the upper

--T row appear the blessed dead, while in the lower row are

[ t the condemned, some lying 0n the ground dead, others

t fettered, while the god Atum watches them, leaning on
1 4 his staff. Chapter II shows the gate of the second region,

? guarded by the serpent Ekebi. In the middle appears
the boat of the sun-god, towed by 8 men; the cord passes

,'r-i through a hollow beam with a bull', head at each end,
'IV on which rest 7 small figures of gods, while 8'bearers of
l l the gods' carry the beam on their shoulders. In the upper

which open as the sun-god approaches; above them coils
at huge snake. Farther to the right gods peep forth from
a lake of fire. In the lower row, to the left, Atum leans
upon his staff; by spells he has rendered the snake
Apophis, the foe of the sun-god, innocuous, and it now
lies before him, watched by 9 gods,'who ward "the
snake'. To the right are Atum and other gods.
