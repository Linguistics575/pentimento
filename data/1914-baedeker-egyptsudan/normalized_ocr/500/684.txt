398 Route 28. 1gS-seBtyA.

The village of Es-sebii'a ('the lions'), also called Siboo, consists
of two parts, one on each bank of the Nile. The steamboat touches
at the E. bank. On the W. bank, amid the tawny desert-sand, lies
the TEMPLE OF Es-SEBI'J'A, called by the Egyptians Per-Amo ('House
of Amon'). This temple was dedicated to Amon and lie-Harakhte
by Ramses IL, and is constructed on the same plan as the temple at
(2erf-f.lusein (p. 394 ]. Ramses himself also was worshipped here as
a god. An avenue of Statues of Ramses II. and Sphina'es leads from
a ruined brick pylon to the temple. The modern name of the place
is derived from these Sphinxes. The entrance to the temple is
termed by a well-preserved stone PYLON [ 32 ft. high, 42 ft. broad),
in front of which stood several colossal statues of Ramses II. (one
of which is still erect). The sadly weatherworn reliefs on the front
of the pylon-towers represent the king smiting his foes, in presence
of Itre-Harakhte and Amon-RO. The reliefs embellishing the
jambs of the central doorway show the king sacrificing, to various
deities. The large COURT, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. To
the right and left are colonnades, each with 5 pillars, against which
stand colossal figures of the king. The reliefs on the walls, reple-
senting the king in the usual scenes of intercourse with the gods, are
poorly executed and offer no special interest. The stone basins for
the ceremony of purification should be observed.

The following GREAT HALL begins the rock-hewn portion of the temple.
The ceiling of this is supported by 12 pillars, of which six are adjoined
by colossal figures of Ramses. The following TRANSVERSE ROOM is adjoined
by two side-chamhers and three other chambers in the hack-wall. On its
walls we see Ramses H. worshipping and presenting offerings to various
deities, among Whom the deiOd king himself appears. The central cham-
her behind is here, as at Gerf-Ijusein, the SANCTUARY. 0n the right
wall the king offers tlowers before the sacred boat of Harakhte, which
is decorated with falcons" heads. On the left wall he oti'ers gaeritiees
before the boat of Amon, which is adorned with rams' heads. On the
rear wall appears the boat of the sun, in which the ram-headed sun-god
Re-llarakhte sits beneath a canopy, worshipped by the king (0n the left)
and three apes (on the right). Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines
of statues of the three gods of the temple (Amen, Ramses Il., and RE-
Harakhte) may still be made out, although a figure of St. Peter, with a
halo and a large key, has been painted over that in the centre; for this
temple, like many others, was at one time used as a Christian church.
The king appears on the right and left of the receSs, with flowers. - To
the S. of the temple we: a SLAUGHTER COURT, with loop-shaped stones
to which the saerOeial animals were fastened. - Within the brick girdle-
wall lay another small brick temple (tn the S.) and a chamber with round
store-rooms.

among palms on the E. bank. The Nile now bends to the S., and
the mountains approach close to the E. bank, their steep slopes
lending a peculiar charm to the scenery.
