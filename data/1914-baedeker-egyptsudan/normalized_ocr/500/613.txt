to Assutsti. K631 OMBO. 21. Route, 341

A wider curve through the desert carries the railway past the
river-detile of Silsileh. The train then again approaches the river and
traverses a district which has only lately been brought under cultiva-
tion: (see below).

1021/2 M.Ken1 Ombo (Hét. Kom Ombo, at the station, the pro-
perty of the undermentioned company, pens. 40-50 pias., good) is
a recently founded village, with the headquarters of the Egyptian
company of the Domaine du Wadi Kom Ombo. On the bank of the
Nile are the large pumping-works of the rompany, conspicuous for
miles around by their tall chimney, by which the waters of the Nile
are raised to a height of about 80 ft. and used on land that has
hitherto been absolutely barren. Nearly 23,000 acres have already
been brought under cultivation, and when all the new machinery is
at work it is estimated that 31,000 acres can be laid under water.
The pumping-works are connected by a trolley-iine with the railway
station, where a factory deals with the sugar-cane raised in the
reclaimed area. w The Temple of ATvn Ombo (p. 349) may be
reached in 1/2 hr. on donkey-hack (5 pias. with bakshish of 3 pies.)
- The train next traverses a reclaimed district, intersected by em-
hankments and canals.
