IV. Outline of the History of Egypt.

I. ANCIENT HISTORY.
By Professor a. 8teindor.tr.

a. From the Earliest Times to the Macedonian Conquest in 332 3.0.

Exact systems of chronology were as little known to the ancient
Egyptians as to the other peoples of antiquity. The events they
desired to record were dated according to the years of the king
reigning at the time. To determine at what period a particular king
had reigned, the priests drew up long lists of monarchs, fragments
of which have survived to the present day (comp. pp. 87, 241, 275).
The chronological epitomes, moreover, which are all that has been
transmitted to us of the'Egyptian History' written in Greek by the
priest Manethot, were founded.on these native registers. Manetho
arranged all the rulers of Egypt, from Menes, the first king, to
Alexand er the Great, in 31 Dynasties, which correspond, generally
speaking, to the various royal houses that held sway in Egypt suc-
cessively or (at certain periods) contemporaneously. This arrange-
ment has been generally adopted by writers on the subject; but at
the same time, for the sake of convenience, several dynasties are
frequently grouped together under the name of a'period','empire', or
'kingdom'. It is impossible to assign anything like exact dates for
the kings before Psammetichos I. The dates, therefore, in the
following outline are given as approximate merely, and in the
earliest period may sometimes be even a century or more out.

I. Prehistoric Period (before 3400 B.C.).

The dark prehistoric period, which later traditions fill up with
dynasties of gods and demigods, is illumined by a few scattered
rays of light only. It may be taken as certain that the country
did not originally form one single kingdom, but was divided into
two states - the'Northern', corresponding to the Delta, and the
'Southern', stretching from the neighbourhood of Memphis (Cairo) to
the Gebel Silsileh, and afterwards to the First Cataract. Each of
these states was subdivided into a number of small principalities,
originally independent but afterwards dependent, which still existed
in historic times as'nomes' or provinces. The two Egyptian king-
doms were for a time hostile to each other. Their final union seems
to have been operated from Upper Egypt by King Menes, Just how
is unknown. The memory of the division subsisted beyond the
dawn of the historic period; the arms of the united empire were
formed by the union of the lily and the papyrus, the symbolical

, Manetho of Sebennytos (p. 174) flourished in the reigns of Ptolemy I.
and Ptolemy II. He was, probably a priest at Heliopolis and wrote his
three books of Atyomum'Tmswvr'wara in the reign of Ptolemy II.
