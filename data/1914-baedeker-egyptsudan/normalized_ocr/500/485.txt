Temple of Ramses H. ABYDOS. 18. Route. 243

A few minutes to the N. of the Temple of Sethos l., partly
beneath the modern village, lies a Temple of Ramses f., and close
by is the Temple of Ramses IL, Which also was dedicated to Osiris
and the cult of the deceased king. The latter temple is in a very
ruinous state but still presents many features of interest. The
scanty traces of a spacious court may be made but in front of the
present entrance. Within, the ground-plan or a peristyle court
(decorated with pillars and figures of Osiris, like the ltaluesseum,
p. 307), two halls, the sanctuaries beyond them, and various other
rooms can still be traced; but the average height of the remaining
walls is only 5-0 ft. To judge by the extant remains, this temple
was a much more sumptuous and more carefully built structure
than any of the other buildings of Ramses ll. known to us. Not
only fine-grained limestone, but also red and black granite (for the
door-frames), sandstone (for the columns), and alabaster (for the
innermost shrine) were used. The still brilliantly coloured mural
decorations in tho rear rooms are in delicate low relief recalling the
admirable sculptures under Sethos 1.; the ruder reliefs'en ereux'
occur only in the court and the tirst hall, with the adjoining room:.
The reliefs in the tirst court depict a grand procession.

(h, the right (N.) Wall peasants are shown bringing oxen, autelopes,
geese, and other animals to four priests, of whom the first records the
gifts, while the secmtd offers incense; farther to the right, the animals are
being slaughtered. Un the 1eft (F.. and S.) walls are similar scenes. To the
left as we enter are persons with saerificial gifts, who are met by a pro-
cession of priests, soldiers, the royal war-charint, captive negroes and
Asiatics, etc. The colouring ot' the figures is surprisingly well preserved.
- in the rooms behind are much damaged religious representations.

Un the outside of the temple (N. and W. sides) is an inscription relating
to the war waged by Ramses 11. against the Hittites; unfortunately only the
lower parts of the lines are preserved. Adjacent are representations of
events in the war, similar to those of the Ramesseum at Thebes (comp.
p. 306). The exterior of the S. wall bears a long inscription, recounting
lhe building of the temple and its endowments.

To the N.W. of the Temple of Ramses H. lies the ruin of Shimet
tyar-Zebib., surrounded by two walls. It has been supposed to be an
ancient fortress but is more probably a tomb.

A few hundred yards to the N.E. of Slntnet ez-Zebib, near the
village of El-W/it/eh, lie the ruins of the ancient city of Abydos
and of the Sanctuary of Osiris, dating back to the beginning of Egyp-
tian history. The enclosing walls, built of brick in the Middle Em-
pire, and some scanty traces of the temple are extant.

To the w. of this point lies the Coptic ennvent of Deir es-Sitteh
Oamidneh, or Anbu Mzisa, which looks more like a village than a couvent.
Although the church is interesting for its seven contiguous chapels, the
convent. scarcely repays a visit.

The ruhbis1riuouttdt, at the foot of the hills, 1 M. to the S.W. of'the
temple of Ramses ll., called by the Arabs Umm el-Ga'z'th ("mother of pots'),
contain tombs of kings of the let and 2nd Egyptian dynasties, including
those of Zee (p. 98; regarded even under the Middle Empire as the tomb of
Osiris), Usaphais, and Miebis (lst Dyn.). They were explored by Amelinenu
and Flinders Petrie, but there is now practically nothing to be seen.

Near the village of Gimbnt, to the S. of Aliytlmt. is an ancient quarry.
