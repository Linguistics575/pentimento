Royal Mummies.

Towards the close of the New Empire the power of the Egyptian state was
no longer in a position to protect even the last resting-places of the dead.
Not only the necropolis at Drah Abu'l Negga (p. 283), but even the secluded
tombs in the'Valley of Rings' (p. 984) were plundered. The authorities
eontented themselves with rescuing the mummies of the ancient Pharaohs.
Thus the bodies of nine kings were walled up in a side-ehamher of the
tomb of Amenuphis Il. Fore the same reason the mummy of Ramses II. was
transferred from its tomb at Bibiin el-Muliik (p. 287) to that of Sethos 1.,
and when that refuge ceased to be deemed secure it was removed to the
tomb of Amenophis l. Finally, under the flistDyn., it was resolved to
protect the royal mummies from further profanation by interring them all
together in a rocky cleft near Deir el-Bal.oritp. 305), which was artificially
widened for the purpose. The corpses of the ruling dynasty also were
placed here. Thus at last the remains of the great monarchs of the New
Empire - Amosis 1., Thutmosis m., Sethos I., and Ramses H. - were left
in peace until in 1875 the fcllahiu once more discovered their secret resting-
place and the plundering of the mummies began again. In 1881 the modern
thieves Were traced and their finds secured for preservation in the museum
at Cairo. It was not till 1898 that Loret discovered the group of mummies
in the tomb of AmenOphis H.: and these were transferred to the Museum
in 1901. Other royal tnmhs (0f Thutniosis l. and II.) have since been
excavated by Luret and, in 1003-i2, by the Egyptian Department of Anti-
quities, at the expense of Theodore M. Davis, of America. Comparatively
few mummies of kings or their relatives have been discovered in thelr
original tombs (comp. Itoom Il).
