Mosluighit' (6 hrs. from Bit el- Inglis), the ascent of which from the E. is
easy and well worth while, as it cmnmands an excellent survey of the
abrupt peaks of the 1JarnmiimM. We next follow the Wddi Homada, which
farther on takes the name of Wddi el- -Ilomr, with the iihe Gebejl Homr

The JOURNEY TO BEREVIKE through the territory of the'Ahahdeh Ile-
duins is seldom undertaken, W It may Mart from Keneh 0r huft, diverging
at Lakeita (11.3711), 111 from Edfu (Itedesiyeh; see below). G, 110th routes
traces' of old watering-stations are discernible. The Itinerary of Antoninus
(3rd cent. A.D.) gives a list of the ancient stations (starting from Koptos)
with their distance from each other in lt oman miles, as follows: Pheni-
con 24, Didyme 2/i, Afrodiio 20, Kompasi 22, Jovis 23, Aristonis 25, Pha-
iacro'25, Apollonos iii,"'iraTaiii'i' 27, Eamon Hydrenma 27,'iiiiiii'iii" i' 18 -
in all 258 Roman miles = about 236 English miles. - A third route,
established by Hadrian, led from Antinoupoiis (p. 209) to the Red Sea,
and then southwards along the coast to Berenike.

thrlenithedr, the Russian Egyptologist, who described his journey in
the'Reeueil de travaux reiatifs a la philologie et a. larchéologie égyp-
tiennes et assyriennes' (xiii,1890), took 11 days from Redesiyeh (p. 348)
to Berenike, and returned thence to Assuan in 8 days. One day may be
saved on the outward journey hy starting from Edfu (p.343). The temple of
Sethos I. is then reached late in the afternoon of the first day.

lst Day. From liedesiyeh to BIT Abbrid (3 hrs.), in the midi Jfidl/.
In the Wiidi Niiili, which is entered opposite the mouth of the Wddi Am-
mar ikbeh, is an ancient station with masons' marks like those at El- I.T0sh,
near Silsileh (p. 337). Lepsius mentions a ruin here, na1ned Herhnsh (116.
sandstone), dating from some ancient settlement.'

2nd Day. The Temple of Sethos I. is reached in the afternoon. This
temple, about 37 M. from Redesiyeh, after which town it is sometimes
called, was discovered in 1816 by Cailliaud. It was built by Sethos I. beside
an ancient watering-station, and was dedicated to Amou-R'é. The vesti-
bule is built of blocks of sandstone and has four papyrus-columns with
bud-capitals. The reliefs represent the king as victor over negroes and
Asietics. The following hall, hewn out of the rock, contains four square
pillars, reliefs of the king at sacrifice, and long inscriptions recording the
sinking of the wells and the building of the temple. In the rear wall
are three niches, with statues of the king and various gods. - A Small
Building beside the temple perhaps marks the site of the well. On an
adjoining rock, to the E., are three steles. On one of these is an Asiatic
goddess on horseback, with shield and spear; the second is dedicated to
the oiheia1 entrusted with the sinking of the well; and on the third is
Eni, Viceroy of Ethiopia, kneeling before the king. Higher up on the
rock are rude figures of gazelles, Greek graffiti, and an inscriptiOn of a
Prince Mermes, dating from the reign of Amenophis III.

3rd Day. More masons' marks disc0vered on small rocks. Ancient
station of Abu Greta, with two cisterns and chambers (not to be confounded
with the place of the same name near Berenike, see p. 377).
