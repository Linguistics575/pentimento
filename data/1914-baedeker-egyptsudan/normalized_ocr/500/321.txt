of Cairo. TOMBS OF THE CALIPIIS. 5. Route. 111

16m burial-ground and at a short distance in front of us the old
aqueduct (p. 116). A little to the right, on an eminence, rises an
old ruined mosque (Gtsmi' Abu 8diid), beyond it is the Citadel
with the mosque of Mohammed Ali, and farther distant are the
Mokattam Hills with the mosque of 6iytoshi (p. 116). This view is
very striking towards sunset. The road, Which becomes bad farther
on, leads round the ruined mosque and ascends heaps of dgbris.
0n the top of the hill it divides. The branch to the left leads hack
to the town. The road, first in a straight direction, afterwards in-
clining to the right, leads to the mosque of Irmtrn Shifi'i (p. 115).

2. The Tombs of the Caliphs and the Mamelukes.

The general effect is most striking towards sunset. The enjoyment of the
scenery is, however, greatly impaired by the dustiness ot the roads.

The mediaeval Arab mausolea of Egyptian rulers, which, under
the names Tombs of the Caliphs and Tombs of the hlametukes, stretch
along the entire E. side of the city, were erected mainly by the
Circassian Mameluke sultans. The name'Tombs of the (Jaliphs',
applied to the northernmost group, is historically a misnomer, for
the tombs have no connection with the Abbaside caliphs then re-
sident in Egypt and treated as mere titled puppets. These mosque-
tombs were once each provided with a numerous staff of sheikhs
and attendants. The revenues of the mosques having been con-
fiseated at the beginning of the 19th century, the tombs gradually
fell to ruin. Now, however, the Committee mentioned at p. 43 has
taken them into its keeping.

The usual route to the *Tombs of the Caliphs (Arab. Turab
el-h% flafa or Turab Iitfit Bey) leaves the city via the Mushi (p. 53)
and its prolongations. It then traverses the mounds of potsherds
known as the Windmill Hills (p. 114) and reaches the still-used
cemetery (Kardfet el-Aft/O. By the roadside lie large mausolea
(Arab. Hash), with courts and rooms occupied during certain festi-
vals by the relatives of the deceased. We first reach the tomb-
mos que of Jitm Bey, to the N. of which is that of Barlctlc. Hence
we return to the city by one of the routes described below.

Those who wish to combine a visit to the Citadel (p..68) with
that to the Tombs of the Caliphs should select the route from the
Bit, el-Atttba (Pl. F, Ci) to the Wit Bey Mosque (comp. p. 114).

It is, however, more convenient to begin with the N. group of
tombs. In this case we quit Cairo by the Btrl, en-Nay (Pl. E, 2;
p. 77) and pass the Mohammedan cemetery. To the right are the
Windmill Ilills (p.114). Beyond the unimportant tomb of Shaikh
Galdl we have one of the finest *Views of the city of the dead.

The N.E. group of the mausolea, which is hardly worth visiting,
consists of the Tomb of an Emir ofSultan EI-G/shi (p. 59), a cube
