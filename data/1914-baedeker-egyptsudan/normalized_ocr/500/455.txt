king and queen at the balcony of' the palace throwing down de-
corations to Eye and his wife (upper parts of their bodies in the
Museum at Cairo). Beside the queen are the three youthful princesses,
one of whom strokes her mother's chin; above shines the sun. In the
courtyard of the palace wait the royal retinue (charioteers, scribes,
fan-bearers, and soldiers), raising their hands in respectful homage
to the royal pair. The curious bent attitudes of the courtiers should
be observed. Below are boys frisking for joy. To the right Eye
leaves the palace, reeeising the congratulations of' his retainers,
who raise their hands in exultation; servants carry the gifts away.
In the top row are the door-keepers sitting and conversing with their
yemnen about the sounds ofjubilation that reach their ears.

About 61/2 M. from Tell el-'Amarna, in a mountain-valley stretching
towards the E. between the N. and S. groups of tombs, and known by
the Arabs as'Darb el-yarnztitri or Darb eI-Melek, are a number of un-
inscribed roek-tumhs and one (No. 26) which, though greatly damaged,
cnntnim many interesting deemrations. This is the -

Family Tomb of Amenophis IV. (closed; keeper at I.tagg-liamlil). A
tlight of 20 Steps (PI. a), with a smooth inclined plane in the middle for
the transportation of the sarcophagus, leads to the Entrance IPI. b), whence
a sloping Corridor (Pt. c) leads to a second flight of [ ti Steps (Pl. d), beyond













which is an Autechamber (Pl. e), with a shaft, now filled up, and damaged
mural reliefs. Beyond this lies the Tomb Chamber (P1. f), in which the sarco-
phagus once stood. All the pillars but one have disappeared. The mural
representations were carved in stucco, but all are much damaged with the
exception of those on the left portion of the entrance-wall (king, queen, and
princesses adoring the sun) and the left wall (king, queen, princess, and
professional mourners beside a hier .0. In the right wall is a small recess
(Pt. tr). - We now retrace our steps towards the entrance. To the left of
the steps at d lie three rooms Wh h, i, k), embellished with reliefs and in-
scriptions, forming perhaps the GRAVE OF THE PRINCESS MEKET-ATON. Both
the main walls of the First Room (Pl. h) show almost exactly the same
scene: the king and queen, four princesses, and the royal retinue presenting,
offerings to the sun, which is seen rising over the mountains behind the
pylon of the temple (on the left); at the foot of the mountains are various
animals. To the left (Le. on the left part of the entrance-wall and be-
tween the doors on the rear wall) the king's non-Egyptian subjects, in-
cluding negroes and Asiatics in their distinctive costume, worship the
