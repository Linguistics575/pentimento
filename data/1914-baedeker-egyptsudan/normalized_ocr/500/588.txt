318 Route 20. THEBEti (w. BANK). b'. Tombs of

reliefs in the flight Chapel (Pl. E), which show the king before
different gods, are of little interest.

To the S. of the temple lie the remains of a town of the Ptole-
maie period; beyond are numerous Tombs of the 20th Dynasty,
most of them in ruins.

Two only, both marked by the admirable freshness of their paintings,
repay a visit (key kept by the Inspector General at Luxor). No. 1. Tomb of
Sennutem, an official of the necropolis (comp. p. 982), with a vaulted tomb-
chamber and well-preserved mural scenes and inscriptions of religious
import (fine representation of a banquet of the dead). - No.3. Tomb of
Peshetu, another necropolis official. The vaulted tomh-chamber contained
a sarcophagus made of blocks of limestone. The walls are covered with
religious texts and scenes. To the left of the door is the deceased, lying
on the ground below a palm-tree and praying; to the right, his father
(with white hair) and other relatives.

Farther along the valley is a tomb with a wide entrance from
which there is a tine view ot'Deir el-Medineh and of the fertile
plains to the E., traversed by the Nile and bounded by the distant
Arabian mountains. In the foreground are seen the temple of Me-
dinet ltabu, the Colossi of Memnon, and the Ramesseum, and on
the other side of the river the gigantic ruins of Karnak. - From
the valley of Deir el-Medineh to the Tombs of the Kings, see p. 299.

The tMI of Kurnet M1irral' (Mar'di), which separates the valley of
Deir el-Medineh from the arable district, is occupied by a number of
fellah huts. Scattered among these are several tombs of the 18th Dyn.,
most of which are oflittle interest. The only one that need be men-
tioned is the -

Tomb ofHuye (Amenhotcp; No. 40), who was governor of Ethiopia.
(Nubia) under Tut-enkh -Amun. The key is kept by the Inspector
General at Luxor.

ENTRANCE WALL. To the right (P1. a) appears the ceremonial investi-
ture of Huye as governor, in presence of the king; his relatives and officials
congratulate him. To the left (Pl. b) stands Huye, with his relatives,
and in front of him are two gaily decorated
Nile-boats; to the right is Huye as governor
of Ethiopia, with five rows of people bringing
tribute, etc. - On the LEFT END WALL (P1. e)
appears the deceased, sacrificing to the dog-

including a Nubian landscape standing upon a
table covered with panther-skins and cloths: in the centre is a conical
hut, with dfim-palms, giraffes, and negroes at the sides. Higher up are
bowls of jewels, rings of gold, sacks of gold-dust, shields covered with
golden plates and gay skins, footstools, chairs, benches of ebony, a chariot,
etc. The Nubian chiefs, dressed (with a few exceptions) in the Egyptian
style, are received by Huye and his brother Amenhotep. In the top row,
behind the chiefs, their princess, shaded by an umbrella, approaches in a.
chariot drawn by oxen, and is followed by chiefs wearing ostrich-feathers
in their hair, which is platted into a kind of hood (as is the cuqtnm
