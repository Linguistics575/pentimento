The southernmost and largest of these chapels was built towards the
close of the 26th Dyn. by the majordomo Peteneit. 1n the doorway we
see Psammetichos III. and Princess Enkh-nes-nefer-eb-ré in presence of
Amon and other gods. Beyond is a hall built of brick, with four stone
columns. To the right of the entrance to the sanctuary is Nitocris, wife
of Paammetichos IL, to the left is Amasis. - The central chapel waa
erected by a court official named Shoshenk in the reign of Amasis, who
is represented on the left jamb of the entrance-door. or, the right jamh
is Princess Enkh-nes-nefer-eb-ré, to whose household Shoshenk belonged.
The walls of this chapel are of brick, with the exception of the gates,
the columns of the court, and the sanctuary, which are of stone. - The
northern chapel, the oldest, was built in the reign of Taharka (25th Dyn.),
who, along with the princess Shepenupet, appears on the walls.

The *Temple of Ptah, patron-god of Memphis, was built by
Thutmosis III. and enlarged and restored by Shabako the Ethiopian
and by several of the Ptolemies.

As we approach from the w., we reach five successive Gateways, of
which the second and fourth (P1. a and b) were built by Shabako, whose
names have been scratched out, the others by a Ptolemy. Farther on is a
Porch, enclosed by two columns (with rich foliage capitals) connected
by a stone screen. The small Pylon beyond the porch has a portal hearing
the name of Thutmosis 11L, restored in the Ptolemaic period. This
admits to a Court (Pl. c), embellished at the back with a porticus sup-
ported by two sixteen-sided columns. Two altar-bases of red granite stand
here, dedicated by Amenemhét I. and Thntmosis III. In the walls are
ancient recesses. A staircase ascends to the upper story. A doorway
(with restored reliefs of Thutmosis III.) in the main axis of the temple
leads into the Sanctuary, which retains the original reliefs of Thutmosis m.
Here stands the image of Ptah, which is illuminated with weird effect
through an aperture in the ceiling (the modern wooden door should be
closed). To the right is a room with a statue of the lion-headed goddess
Sekhmet; to the left, another with a well-preserved ceiling and ancient
reliefs of Thutmosis III. - It is instructive to observe the difference in style
between the ancient and the restored reliefs.

To the S.E. of the Temple of Ptah, on the way to the Temple
of Osiris (p. 276), is a Storehouse, built by the Ethiopian Shabako,
consisting of a single hall borne by 12 columns. Round the brick
walls run stone tables on which the isaerificial gifts were laid.

From the Temple of Ptah we pass through a gate in the N. girdle
wall of the Temple of Amen and reach the North Temple Pre-
cincts, which are surrounded by a girdle-wall of brick. Here stands
the TEMPLE OF MONT, which is now so ruined and covered with
rubbish that its ground-plan can scarcely be made out. The temple
was built for the war-god Mont by Amenophis III. (18th Dyn.),
though it was subsequently several times enlarged and restored
between the reign of Ramses II. and the epoch of the Ptolemies.
The earlier sculptures and architectural fragments are of great
beauty. Two ohelisks of red granite once stood in front of the N.
entrance, of which the bases and some fragments are still extant.
The N. gateway of the N. temple-precincts, built of sandstone,
dates from Ptolemy Euergetes. .-_ In tho girdle-wall to the S. of
the Temple of Mont is a gate adorned with the name of Nektanehés
(Nekht-llar-ehbét; p. cvii).

From the sandstone gateway we proceed to the SW., passing the
remains of a Ptolemaie Temple (not yet freed from rubbish), of
