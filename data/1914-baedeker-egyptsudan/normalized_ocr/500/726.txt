(see p. 433). - 3111) DAY. 151 M. Kawa (E. bank), the chief town
of a district, with houses (tukuls) the curious straw roofs of which
arrest our attention .--The steamer now reaches the N. end of the
densely wooded Island of Abba or Aba (281/2 M. long), the base of
the Mahdi in his religious war of 1883 (p. cxxiv). - 181 M. Fashi
Shoya, on the W. bank, was the home of the Mahdi. - 199 M. Kosti
(W. bank; see p. 433), opposite the S. end of Abba Island; on the
opposite (r?.) river-bank lies the village of Géz Abu Gum'a.

FROM Kuawptor T0 GONDOKORO AND REJAF, 0n the Balu' el-6ebel,
1096 M. On the 6th and 2ist of each month starts a government-
steamer, which occupies 15 days for the voyage upstream and ii days
for the return (return-fares J? E 38, 50 pias., 4) E 19, 25 pias.; meals
60 and 45 pias. per day). In addition to these steamers a tourist-
steamer leaves on Feb. ist (return-fare, incl. meals, £ E (MI, 10 pias.,
servants J?, E 40, 70 pies; particulars from the tourist-agents in
Cairo, p. 38). - From Irhar.rtirn to Kosti (Ute, Abu Gum'a), see p. 433
and above. About 4 M. beyond Kosti the steamer passes through the
large railway bridge mentioned on p. 432. We now enter the region
of the'Blacks'; at many of the stations war-dances are performed for
the benefit of the tourists. The forests often come right down to the
river-banks, and hippopotami, crocodiles, gazelles, and innumerable
water-fowl may be seen. On the E. bank is the territory of the Dinka
negroes. - About 246 M. from Kharttun we see on the E. bank the
ridge of Gebelein (Jebelein,'the two mountains'), with a govern-
ment rubber plantation. Here the sert1t fly is met with for the first
time; though not poisonous, it is very troublesome. - 4TH DAY.
305 M. Rank (E. bank). - 5TH DAY. At a point 364 M. from
Klrarttun we pass the Gebel Ahmed Agha, a cliff 345 ft. in height. -
408 M. Kaka (W. bank), to the N. of which is a government rubber
plantation. Kaka consists of a group of settlements of Shilluknegroes,
who live partly by hunting and fishing and who build ingenious boats.
The river sweeps round towards the E., separating the Dinka negroes
on the E. bank from the Slsilluk negroes on the W. bank. Neither of
these tribes wear clothes but both adorn themselves with all kinds of
ornaments; they carry long spears. The Shilluks are much superior
to the Dinkas. - (hn DAY. Ml/t M. Mclut (E. bank). The river again
bends towards the S.'--469 M. Kodak (Fashoda; 1035 ft.), on the
W. bank, capital of the province of the Upper Nile, was occupied by
the French under General Marchand from July 10th to Dee. 11th,
1808, but was then ceded to the British. It has an evil reputation
for malarial fever; the climate is sultry and damp and mosquitoes
abound. In the vicinity is the capital of the Shilluks and the resi-
dence of their'Mek' (from melek, i. e. king), or hereditary headman.
The tomb of the first king Nyikong at Kodok is an object of great
veneration among the natives. - Trr, DAY. 487 M. Lul, a station
of the Austrian Roman Catholic Mission (p. 427). The scenery be-
comes very dreary. The W. bank is lined with Shilluk villages,
