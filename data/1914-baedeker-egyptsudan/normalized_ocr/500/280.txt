76 Route d, CAIRO. J. Northern

Adjacent to the Muristzin is the Medreseh and Tomb of En-
NMir, dating from about 1303, now almost a total ruin.

We enter it from the street by a marble portal in the Gothic style,
brought by Sultan El- Ashraf Khalil, the elder brother of Erva% .sir, from
the church of Acre, which he destroyed. in 1291. The door leads into
a corridor, on the right side of which is the tomb of En-Nasir (dome
collapsed), while to the left IS the sanctuary of the medreseh. In' front are
1I1e ruins of the main building, now containing coppersmiths' workshops.

The third large building is the *Barliiitiyeh, the medreseh of
Sultan Ihrrl.ci1lt, (ro'82-00; p. cxviii), built in 1384. It possesses an
interesting marble portal and a bronze-mounted door. The greater
part of it has been thoroughly restored, and the colouring and gild-
ing applied to the sanctuary and mausoleum (in which a daughter
of Barlr1ll.t rests) are, unfortunately, much too loud. - Opposite is
a modern sebil. _

The N. continuation of the (hihargiyeh is the busy SHARI' EN-
NAyrptstN, with the market of the eoppersmiths. To the right, be-
tween the I.litrtrt Beit el-liitli and the Derb Kermez, are the remains
(stone below, brick above) of the huge facade of the palace of Dar
L'eshtfk (Pl. 143,3 3, p. clssxiii), which was erected 11113 30by the Emir
Besht√©k on the foundations of a palace of the Fatimite caliphs (entr.
from the Derh Kermez). The interior still retains traces of its ela-
borate decorations, while the main room of the harem (1.ft'ai inacces-
sible) is well preserved. - At the intersection of the street with the
Shari' e1-Tombakshiyeh (p. 77) stands the Sebil'Abd er-Rahmdn, one
of the prettiest structures of its sort in Cairo (18th cent.) On the
gronndfloor is the chamber for the distribution of the water, taste-
fully decorated with fayence. Upstairs is the hall of an elementary
school, commanding a striking retrospect of the busy street.

At the corner of the Haret es- -Sannannin, farther on, to the
right, stands the Gittnie e1-Akmar (Pl E, 2), hui1t in 1125 by El-
Ma mun, the grand vizier of El- Gnir, the Fatimite. The facade,
now laid bare for the greater part, is the oldest mosque-fagade in
Cairo and therefore of considerable architectural interest (comp.
p. Clxxix); it is built of hewn stone, with tall pointed arches in
rectangular frames alternating with small recesses in two stories. -
The street now becomes the thduur EL-NARGUSH Ev-BAvtiNs. On
the left, beside the modern mosque of Es-Selabdir, with its Turkish
minaret, the Heiret Bir Gauau diverges through an archway and
leads in a zigzag to the Mosque of'iii, Bekr Mazhar eb. Antskri
(Pl. E, 2).

This mosque was built in 1480 by Abu Bekr, director of the Chancery
of Sultan Kait Bey, in the style of the small mosques of the later Mameluke
period, and has been thoroughly restored. The walls and ceiling illustrate
the characteristic decoration of its date. Other noteworthy "iiiUiiiiCs' are
the columns in the E. and w. liwans the carved pulpit and the pretty
doors. The central portion is domed. The coloured stucco window-
traeeries are modern.

Farther on the street assumes the name SHARI' BAP. sm-yur/nr
On the right we soon reach the entrance of the ruinous--
