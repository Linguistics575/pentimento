VI ]. HISTORY or' liGYP'l'IAN ART. Clxxvii

Among the subjects thus stereotyped were scenes relating to the
intercourse of the king with the gods (in prayer or saerifiee), the
celebration of certain festivals, and the slaughtering of animals for
saerifiety..

In the practice of the Artistic Handicrafts, such as cabinet-
making, glass-blowing, and the production of' coloured t'ayeuee,
Egypt was perfect. The goldsmiths and workers in metal in parti-
cular had attained the most complete mastery of their craft; they
thoroughly understood all its ancillary arts, such as enameHiug and
damascene work, and they were thus able to produce, especially with
the aid of coloured gems and fayenee inlays, works of a degree of
tiuish and brillianey such as a highly civilized nation alone could
execute and appreciate.

The traveller should note the siguificatiou of some of the
SYMBOLS and SIGNS most commonly used in sculpture and as

architectural ornamentations. Thus, is the creek or shepherd's

staff, the emblem of the prince or monarch; A a fan, the

symbol of hiugly power;% the sign of life; i (p. 369) the

sign of steadfastness; l/ the red crown of Lower Egypt;
the white crown of Upper Egypt; tir the united crown of
Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt; the blue crown of the king;
and a the Uranus or royal serpent, represented on diadems

and suns by 105. Its function was to avert hostile influences,
just as the Urreus serpent had once destroyed with its poison the
enemies of the sun-god. The winged sun-disk, CSi2? Z5 the emblem
of Horus of 1hlfu, was frequently placed over the doors of temples

to avert everything evil. The sceptre, wcser, denoted wealth;
, meat, an ostrieh-feather; truth and justice; khepre, the
searabteus or beetle, is a form of the sun -god and was frequently
worn as an amulet. The symbol (originally meaning a lung) slits-.

nifles union. It is frequently entwined wi h lilies and papyrus-
plants, when it is symbolieal ot' the union of Upper and Lower
Egypt and is equivalent to the national arms of Egypt. The lock

on the temple of a figure marks it as a child, at a later period
generally the offspring of the gods or of the kings.
