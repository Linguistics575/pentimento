From Aha.tdlbeh (see above) a private railway of the Egyptian Salt &
Soda Co. leads to (34 Mc, 3 hrs.) Air Hooker, rm the E. edge of the Widi
Natrixn ('Nairon valley'). This valley (ca. 20 M. long) in the Libyan desert
contains ten salt-lakes, which are supposed to be connected with the Nile
and which dry up almost entirely in summer. These lakes and the sur-
rounding soil yield salt and soda (matron), which are used in Egypt for
bleaching and in the manufacture of soap and glass. The wiidi Ilat.riin
is celebrated for its hermitages and cunvents, which were established here
as early as the 4th cent, and had great influence in the development of
Christianity. Only four of them are still inhabited, and these are most
conveniently visited from Bit Hooker. Close to Bir Hooker are the Deir
es-8urydn ('convent of the Syrians0 and, 10 min. from it, the Deir Abu Bshoi
('convent of St. Pshoi0; farther to the N. is the Deir Bavamtls, while the
Deir AbuNakyir ('convent of St. Maeariuq') lies at the S. end of the valley.
