266 Route 20. THEBES (E. BANK). f?. Karnak:

the Libyan kings of Bubastis (22nd Dyn.) revived the traditions of
the ancient Pharaohs. A huge court, with colonnades on two sides
and incorporating half of the temple of Ramses m., was built by
Shosheuk in front of the pylon of Ramses I. Taharka, the Ethio-
pian (25th Dyn.), afterwards reared a kiosque-like building with
colossal columns in this court. The temple was now left unaltered
for some time, but under the Ptolemies it underwent fresh alter-
ations (including the erection of the granite Chapel of Philip) and
received its final great pylon (No. I). Its decay began in the time of
the Roman emperors (p. 256). - Extensive excavations and restor-
ations have been very successfully accomplished since 1895 by the
French archaeologist, M. Georges Legrain (p. 264), working under
the auspices of the Egyptian Service des Antiquit√©s.

The *First Pylon is still 370 ft. wide, with walls 49 ft. thick
and 1421/2 ft. high. This gigantic portal, which dates from the
Ptolemies, was never completed; and portions of the scaffolding,
constructed of crude bricks, remain to this day. -.. The inscrip-
tions on the door of the pylon merit notice. The one on the right,
high up, placed there by the savants who accompanied the army of
Napoleon to Egypt in 1799, records the latitude and longitude of
the chief temples of the Pharaohs, as calculated by them; opposite,
on the left, is one erected by an Italian learned society (Feb. 9th,
1841), showing the variation of the compass as 10'56".

A magniticent*View is enjoyed from the top, which is reached
by a staircase on the N. tower (comp. p. 267). It is interesting to
seek to identify, with the aid of the accompanyingplan, the various
columns, obelisks, and pillars, though at first we seem to see noth-
ing but a confused system of ruins.

The *Great Court, built by the rulers of the 22nd Dynasty, is
276 ft. deep and 338 ft. wide. On each side is a row of columns,
that on the right Cs.) being interrupted by the temple of Ramses IH.
(see p. 267). To the left stands the small -

TEMPLE OF SETHOS IL, built of grey sandstone, with the ex-
ception of the door-frames and the lower part of the walls, for which
a reddish qi1artzose sandstone has been used. The temple has three
chapels, of which that in the centre, dedicated to Amon, and that
on the left, dedicated to Mut, are filled with rubbish. The third
chapel is that of Khons; on the walls the king is represented before
the boat of Khons, which is decorated with falcons' heads, and
before Amen, hint, and Khons.

Beside the Temple of Sethos IL, on the N.W. side of the court, are
a number of recumbent rams, which were stored here in antiquity. They
belonged to the Sphinx Avenue of Ramses II. (p. 264), which led to the
second pylon, and were removed on the erection of the various buildings
in the great court.

In the centre of the great court are two large Pedestals for sta-
tnes (that on the right retains its base only). Behind was the
Kiosque of' Taharka; of the original ten columns there still stand
