Assiii.t, see p. 232. The voyage to Akhmim leads through an ex-
tremely fertile and well-cultivated district. Well-tilled fields, broader
on the W. than on the E., adjoin both banks of the river, and are
shaded by fine palms and Nile aeacias, especially near the villages.
Here, as in most of' Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, chiefly for the sake of their droppings, which form 3.
valuable manure (romp. p. lxxi), the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike forts or pylons,
and built of unbaked bricks, clay, and pottery, are visible in all

of Jfamarnt" peh, with rock-tombs of the Ancient Empire; 1/2 hr. to
the s., on the hill-slope, lies the large Necropolis of Antaeopolis
(p. 236), containing rock-tombs of the Middle Empire and of later
