the ancient tradition. Afterwards a compromise was attained by the
admission of analogous decisions (Kiyc'zs), as a legal-theologieal prin-
ciple (Esh-sht1fi" t, d. 820j. A considerable number of schools of
jurisprudence (madhhab, pl. madhthib) arose, named after their

the Shifirites and Malikites are most influential to- -day; in Turkey,
the 1.laneiites; in West Africa, the Milikites. The llanbalites, l'e-
strieted to Arabia, are of inferior importance. Every believer must
belong to one or other of these rites 01' schools (which are not
sects). They mutually recognize each other as orthodox and differ
only in their distribution of actions among the five recognized classes
of'commanded','recommended','indifferent','blameworthy', and
'forbidden'. The science of law is known as Fiyiecognition). It
forms practically the entire sphere of Islamic mental activity. Its
results, varying slightly acrerding to the rites and adapting them-
selves to the interpretation of each, constitute the Shari'a, or Shar',
the holy law. It contains the collection of those precepts from the
Koran and the Sunna that have been approved by the Igma' and are
therefore authoritative. Certain later text-books also have attained
a certain canonical authority. The theologian who is oifieially en-
trusted with the exposition of the law is called Mufti, his decision
Fetwt. Tho chief mufti bears the title Sheikh u'l-lslihn. These ex-.
perts are necessary, for only the learned ('all grasp the entire com-
plicated system. These learned men ('lhamt, sing.'Alim) and
jurists (Fulcahri, sing. Fal.itlt) resemble Jewish scribes rather than
Christian priests. A sinner may reckon upon divine pardon even if
he transgress the precepts of the Sherfa daily 01' hourly, but if he
doubt their theoretical authority he is an infidel. This is why Moharn-.
medans are always ready to fly to arms when the Sheri'a is threatened.
In practice they trouble themselves little about its precepts.

The five pillars (i. e. chief duties) of Islam are the profession of the
true faith (p.lxxxvii0,'the repetition of the daily prayers, the pay-
ment of the charitable tax, the fast during tamadan, and the pilgrim-
age to Mecca. Other matters dealt with by the Shel'i'a are the Jaws
relating to family duties, inheritance, and marriage; the manage-
ment of religious endowments (Walcf, pl. Aulylf), which occupies a
ministerial department in Egypt; and the regulation of ceremonies
and custom. The precepts of the Jaw as regards these, being regarded
as religious in the narrower sense, are carried out in practice as far
as possible. In other matters, regarded as more theoretical (such as
constitutional law, criminal law, the Jaw of real property, and the
law of obligations), local customary law ('Ada) has from the very
first outweighed the Sherpa. The distinction between the'Ada, the
commands of custom, and the Sheri'a, the commands of religion, is
recognized in every sphere of Islamic life. The extent to which the
Sheri'a prevails in any country is a measure of the real strength of
