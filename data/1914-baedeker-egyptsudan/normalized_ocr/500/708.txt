422 Route 39. MEI-tot'z.

About 3/4 M. to the N. of the station of Kaldashiyeh the railway inter-
sects the extensive Ruins of Meroé, capital of the EthiOpian empire (p. 419),
which have been excavated since 1000 by Prof. J. Garatang (com. his
annual Interim Reports in the'Liverpool Annals of Archaeology", 1510 et
seq., and'Meroii, the City of the Ethiopians', Oxford, 1911). About 1/21".
to the E. of the railway-iine is the large Temple of the Sun, mentioned by
Herodotus, which seems to have been built by King Espelut (630 B.C.).
1t rises in several terraces, the lowest of which is surrounded by an arcade.
On the highest terrace is the sanctuary, with the remains of an obelisk,
the symbol of the sun-god. The pavement was of blue and yellow tiles.
(in the exterior of the walls are interesting reliefs, commemorating the
victories of the king. Also to the E. of the railway, among ancient ceme-
teries, stand two small Chapels, one dedicated to the Ethiopian lion god,
the other probably to a sacred cow. - To the W. of the railway are the
ruim of several houses and the large Temple of Amen, built ca. 350 B C.
The entrance to the latter, which is formed by a pylon. gives access to
several columned halls, beyOnd which are the sanctuaries. The axis of
the temple is about 430 ft. in length. Among the objects of interest here
are a stone throne, whence the god Amon pronounced his oracles, a place
for the saerifiee of animals, and an altar embellished with reliefs. We
cross the town-wall to the, W. of the temple to the ruins of two Royal
Palaces. Near these is a hypostyle hall (opened by the custodian), the
wells of which are decorated with coloured frescoes of the king and royal
family in rich costumes and of captive foes. In 1912 were discovered the
ruins of a small Roman temple and, near the river, the interesting remains
of the Royal Baths, supposed to date from about the 2nd cent. B.C.; the
statues and frescoes of the latter are protected by wooden structures (opened
by the custodian). In 1013 a large portion of the Royal City to the N.E.
was laid bare, including several streets and a palace supposed to be that
of King Neteg-Amun.

About 3 M. to the N.E. of Irabiisl1iyeh and visible from the railway
rise the Pyramids of Mero'e', on two chains of hills separated by a valley.
Like the earlier pyramids of Napata (p. 419) these Neroitie pyramids are
distinguished by their slender form. Many of them are still adjoined on
the E. by mortuary chapels decorated inside with religious reliefs in the
peculiar Egypto-Ethiopian style and with hieroglyphic inscriptions. The py-
lon-shaped portals are usually embellished, after the Egyptian fashion,
with figures of kings grasping their foes by the hair and smiting them with
the sword. - About 3/4 M. to the IV., in the plain, lies a third group,
in which, however, the mortuary chapels are in a very ruinous condition.

474 M. Shendé, one of the principal towns in the ancient
Fung empire, is an industrial centre of some importance, with
cotton factories, dye-honses, and iron-works. - On the left bank,
opposite Shendi, lies J1fetemmeh, captured by Wolseley 011 J an. 21 st,
1885, after the battle of Abu mea. This was the final act in the
campaign (comp. p. 420).

The Fung tribes distinguished themselves by their warlike ability in
the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries. Their emirs wore shirts of
chaiu-mail and helmets with nose-pieces; specimens of both were captured
as late as 1897. 1smit'il, son of Mohammed Ali, was treacherously captured
and burned at Shendi in 1822, though his army was rescued by the hasty
advance of the Defterdar from Eordof2n.

At (497 M.) Wad Benttpa are the scanty remains of several late-

Ethiopian temples.

In the fertile Wddi Aurateib, about 22 M. to the S.E. of Ben'aiga, are
the ruins of Naga (Rest House), reached in 7-8 hrs. on camels 0r ponies,
which must be ordered five days in advance from the ma'rntar (p. xlvii) of
Shendi. Among the ruins are several ancient houses, three well-preserved
late-Ethiopian temples, a graceful Roman chapel, and also the remains of
several smaller sanctuaries and two ancient reservoirs. The Bednins water
