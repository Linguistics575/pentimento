on the law of primogenituro, and in 1867 he was raised to
the rank of Khedive, or Viceroy, having previously borne
the title of wan, or governor of a province only. in 1869
the Suez Canal was opened (p. 184). In 1873 the Khe-
dive obtained a new flrman confirming and extending his
privileges (independence oi'administration and judiciaries;
right of concluding treaties with foreign countries; right
of coining money; right of borrowing money; permission
to increase his army to 30,000 men). The annual tribute
payable to the Porte was fixed at 133,635 purses (about
700,000t0. The warlike successes of the Khedive re-
sulted in the extension of his dominions to the borders
of Ahyssinia and, on the S., to the 2nd parallel ofN.1ati-
tude. - The burden of the public debt had now increased
to upwards of 100,000,0001., one loan after another hav-
ing been negotiated. The Powers brought such a pressure
to bear on the Khedive that he was compelled to resign
his private and family estates to the state and to accept a
ministry under the presidency of Ntbar Pasha, with the
portfolio of public works entrusted to M. 1lligr1i'eres and
that of tinanee to Mr. Rivers Wilson. This coalition, how-
ever, soon proved unworkable; and early in 1879 the
whole cabinet was replaced by a native ministry under
Sheri? Pasha. The patience of the Great Powers was new
at an end; and on the initiative of Germany they de-
manded from the Porte the deposition of Ism√©'il, which
accordingly took place on June'26th. He died at Constan-
ti110p1e in 1895.

Ismi'il was succeeded by his son Taufilr (or Tewfilr, in the

Turkish pronunciation), under whom the government was
carried on in a more rational spirit. The debts were reg-
ulated, an international commission of liquidation was
appointed, and an extensive scheme of reform was tinder-
taken. In Sept., 1881, however, a military revolution
broke out in Cairo, which had for its chief object the
emancipation of Egypt from European influences. The
Khedive was besieged in his palace and had to yield; he
appointed Sherifpresident of a new ministry and arranged
for an election of Notables, or representatives. As the
latter espoused the'national' cause, Sherif resigned in
Feb., 1882, and Maluniid Pasha formed a new ministry,
the soul of which was Arabi Bey, the energetic minister
of war. This cabinet at once proceeded, without receiving
the consent of the Khedive, to pass several measures in-
tended to diminish the European iuih1enee in the politi-
cal and flnancial administration of the country. At the
end of May the British and French fleets made their ap-
