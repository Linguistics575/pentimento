in 1298. Once more expelled in the same year, he re-
gained his throne in 1309 and retained possession of it till
his death in 1340. Distrust, vindictiveness, and cupidity
soon showed themselves to be prominent characteristics
of En-Nis.sir, who treated his emits with the utmost capri-
eiousness, loading them with rich gifts or ordering them
to execution as the humour seized him. The emit Ismtftt
Abtdfidd, known also as a historian, succeeded, however,
in retaining his master's favour until his death (1331).
Towards the mass of the population En-Nasir was liberal and
condescending, and towards the 01ergy indulgent. In order
to provide the enormous sums required for the expenses of
his court and his love of building he appointed Christian
officials in the custom-house and finance departments, as
they were considered especially clever and cunning.

Hasan tsn-NL/ir (p. 66), the sixth son ofEn-Nasir, was still a
minor when he ascended the throne. The lawless indepen-
dence of the Mamelukes and emits was aggravated by a
plague in 1348-49 which exterminated whole families,
whose property was immediately seized by the government.

usurping the throne by treael1erously setting aside Haggi, a
boy of six years and great-grandson ofEn-Nisiir. The tyxas-.
perated emirs dethroned him in 1389; buthe triumphantly
rc-entered Cairo in 1300. He fought successfully against
the Mongols under Timur and the Osmans under Baya zid.

Farag (pp. 45, 112), his son, had scarcely ascended the
throne, as a boy of thirteen years of age, before the Osmans,
and a little later the Mongols, again began to threaten the
Egyptian dominions. Farag proceeded Victoriously as far as
Damascus; but owing to dissensions among his emits he
was obliged to return to Cairo. After the defeat of the Turks
by the Mongols under Timur at the battle of Angora, Farag
had to enter into negotiations with Timur. The latter years
of I? arag's reign were constantly disturbed by the rebellions
of' his emits, particularly Shaikh el-Afarmiidi, who after-



wards became Sultan Et- Muaiyad. Farag was at length

compelled, by the insurgents to eapitulate at Damascus,

and his execution was followed by the accession of -
