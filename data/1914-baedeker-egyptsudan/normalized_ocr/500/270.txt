From the Bah el- -Khall.r Square we continue to follow the Shtrir
Mohammed'Ali. About 1/4 M. farther on a side-street leads to the
left to the Gémi' el-Malika Safiya (P1. D, 5), a Turkish-Arabian
mosque of 1611, with a dome borne by six monolithic antique eol-.
umns and ornamentation in the Byzantine-Arabian style. Behind
it, in the Shtm" ed-Daridtyeh, lies the small *Mosque of El-Burdeini
(Pl. D, 5), built in 1630 and restored in 1885, lavishly adorned
with mosaics, and adjoined by an elegant minaret. The beautiful
wooden ceilings and the elaborate pulpit are especially notable.

Farther on the Shari Mohammed'Ali passes the much altered
mosque of Et-k eisun 0113111121) an and leads to a large square
adorned with gardens in front of two large mosques. That on the
left is the (itimir Riféfiyeh, a handsome columned editlee com-
pleted in 1912. It stands on the site of the tomb of Sheikh'Ali
Rifé'i and contains the family b11rial-.vault of the Khedive 1srntt'il
Ld. 1895) .--. On the right rises the -.

*'i't1gmir Sultan Hasan (Pl. E, 6), the'superb mosque', and the
finest existing monument of Egypto-Arahian architecture. It was
built in 1356-59 for Sultan Uasan o. cxviii), perhaps by a Syrian
architect, and has been restored by Herz-Pasha. The huge proportions
of the building, which occupies a shelving rock below the citadel,
taken in conjunction with the masterly execution of its details, pro-
duce an effect of great majesty. Admission, see p. 43

The exterior recalls the broad surfaces of the early-Egyptian
temples. All the facades are crowned by a unique and boldly pro-
jecting cornice of'stalaetite' formation and furnished with pinnacles
(restored). The broad wall-surfaces are relieved by blind recesses
and round-arched windows in couples. The mausoleum, which pro-
jects boldly from the S.E. facade, is covered by a dome (180 ft, high),
said to have been originally egg-shaped but reconstructed after 1616
in the Turkish-Arabian style. The N.W. facade is unfinished. -
The massive **Gateway (Pl. 1), 85 ft. high, though its ornamen-
tation was never fully carried out, has been more or less imitated
in many other Egyptian mosques. The original magnificent bronze
gate now adorns the mosque of Muaiyad (p. 59) .---. Tri & Minaret
(P1. 11a; 285 ft. high) is the highest minaret in Cairo (that of
El-. Ghuri 213 ft., Kalaun 193 ft., El- -Muaiyad 167 ft., El-Azha1
167 ft., Ka'1't Bey and Barkuk iii" ft., Tulun 131 ft.,'Ann: 105 ft.).

quake, but was afterwards rebuilt on a smaller scale.

The building is in the form of an irregularpentagon, 85,000 sq. ft.
