The iso-called *Windmill Hills: afford one of the best views in
the environs of Cairo. A fine effect, especially by evening-light, is
produced by the domes and the peculiar colouring of the valley
and the Molrattarn. To the W. are the city, the plain of the Nile,
and the Pyramids; to the N. lies the straggling suburb of'Abb3si-
yeh; to the N.E., in the distance, is the new suburb of Heliopolis
and at our feet are the Tombs of the Galiphs.
