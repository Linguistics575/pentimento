second-hand books is not so strictly drawn in the East as in Europe
The booksellers generally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to re-
fresh their memories regarding the state of their stock. The Koran, which
is shown very reluctantly to non-Noslems, is kept separate from the other
books. The books are piled up in a very inconvenient fashion. Many of
them are sold in loose sheets, in which case the purchaser should see that
the work is complete, as gaps are of frequent occurrence. The bindings
usually consist of leather or pasteboard. Valuable books are often kept
in cases of red sheepskin. - The workmanship of the bookbinders, who,
like other oriental artisans, work in the open street, is far inferior to
that of European productions. Red is their favourite colour.

We now follow the Shzlri' tsl-Azhar, which leads to the left to

the main entrance of the Azhar Mosque.

The $ Gimi' el-Azhar (P1. E, 3, 4), the'most blooming', the most
important monument of the Fatimite period, was completed in 970
Al). by G'tohar, the vizier of the Fatimite Sultan El-Murizz, and here,
three years later, E1-Mtfizz offered his first prayer after his entry
into Cairo. Admission, see p. 43; cameras are forbidden and the
visitor should carefully abstain from any manifestation of amuse-
ment or contempt. The mosque was converted into a University in
988 by Caliph El-UW, (p. cxv). The rectangular ground-plan of
the original building, almost entirely rebuilt by the Emir Salar
after an earthquake in 1303, is easily recognizable, but it has been
so frequently restored that no part of it can be said to date actually
from the Fatimite period except the central part of the sanctuary,
with its cupolas. Everything outside this rectangle is known posi-
tively to be of later date. The characteristic old ornamentation of
the arcades and cupolas in the sanctuary deserves special attention;
that of the walls has been for the most part renewed after vanished
patterns. The arcades of the court (Â§alm) were rebuilt under the
Khedive Tanfik with scrupulous reproduction of the old style and
the retention of the old columns. - The successive rulers of Egypt
have emulated each other in maintaining and enlarging this vener-
able building. In the 18th cent. the wealthy'Abd er-Psaltrnhn Kihya
added four aisles to the sanctuary, and in more recent days Sa" id
Pasha and the Khedives Taufils and'Abbis ll. have been notable
henefaetors of the mosque. rAbbis II. erected a new building in
place of the dilapidated N.W. side, of the mosque, and his neo-Arah
fagade is practically the only one the mosque boasts, the other sides
being all quite unpretentious and concealed in narrow lanes.

The university is considered the most important in the territory
of Islam. Before the British occupation the average number of
students was 7600-7700, taught by 230 professors. After that
the numbers sensibly diminished, as no students came from the
former equatorial provinces of Egypt during the domination of the
Mahdi. In 1912, however, the numbers had again risen to 14,959
students and 587teaehers. Most ot'the students are natives ofEgypt,
so that the Egyptian riwtlss (p. 58; Upper Egypt, Lower Egypt,
Eastern Egypt) are the largest, each having several hundredstudents.
