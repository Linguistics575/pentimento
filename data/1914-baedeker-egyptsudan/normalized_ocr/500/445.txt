About 91/211. to the w. of Beni Nazar, on the Balm ram } (most cou-
veniently reached by the branch-line to Sandafa in about 1 hr.), lies the
town of Behnesa (Balmasa), on the site of the ancient Oryrhynchos (Egypt.
Permezet, Coptic Pemje, Greek HépJu-n), Once the capital of a nome but now
represented only by a few desolate heaps of debris. The fish Oxyrhyu-
chus, a. species of mormyrus (Arab. 3lizdeh), was worshipped here. In the
neighbouring town of Cynopolis the dog was held in equal honour, and
Plutarch relates how a'very pretty quarrel', the settlement of which
required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
because the citizens of each had killed and dined on the sacred animals
of the other. On the introduction of Christianity Oxyrhynchos became
a veritable town of monks. In the town itself were 12 churches and all
round it convent jostled convent. In the 5th cent. the diocese of Oxyrhyn-
chos is said to have contained 10,0J0 monks and 12,000 nuns. In the
Mameluke period it was still of some im ortance, but it has since steadily
declined. Excavations begun here in 1897 by Grenfel ] and Hunt have
yielded large quantities of Greek, Coptic, and Arabic papyri. - From
Behnesa a desert~route leads in 4 days to the oasis of Bagu-tyeh (p. 379).
