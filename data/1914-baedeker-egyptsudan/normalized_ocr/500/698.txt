412 Route 31. SECOND CATARAGT.

On the W. bank, opposite Widi Halfa, a little to the N. of a large
and conspicuous sycamore-tree, lay the ancient town of Buhen, the
site of which may be reached by boat from the town of Haifa in
i-2 hrs. (according to the wind). The remains of two temples are
still extant. The NORTH TEMPLE, dating from the beginning of the
12th Dyn., was built of brick, with the exception of the pillars in
the first ball and the jamhs of the entrauce-door, which were of
sandstone. It is much damaged and sanded up. The inscriptions
found here date from the time of AmenoPhis II. and Sethos I. The
SOUTH TEMPLE, about 50 yds. distant, was exhumedinf887 by
Col. (now Maj.-Gen. Sir Ch. H.) Smith and is now protected by a
wooden structure (adm. 10 pias.) It is in better preservation than
the other, its sandstone walls and pillars still rising to the height
of 5-6 ft. This S. temple was built by Thutmosis III. and Bat.-
shepsut and dedicated to Horus of Buhen. The cartouches and
figures of Hatshepsut have been systematically defaced or con-
verted into those of Thutmosis II. (p. cii). The temple stands from
E. to W. Close to the river-hank, where traces of a quay may be
made out, is a brick Pylon, the S. tower of which rises like a mas-
sive pillar. Behind is a large Hall, the present form of which is
due to a reconstruction, probably at the beginning of the 20th Dyn-
asty. The pillars and columns on which the roof rested bear not
only the original reliefs and inscriptions of Thutmosis Ill. but also
numerous hieroglyphic inscriptions added by officials of the New
Empire. There are also Greek, Carian, and Mero'itic inscriptions.
On one pillar is a long and pompous inscription celebrating the
deeds of Thutmosis III. Behind this hall lies the Temple Proper,
the back of which adjoined the cliff, while on the other three sides
were colonnades with'proto-Dork columns. Within are a Trans-
verse Hall, communicating with the Sanctuary, and several other
chambers. The admirable mural reliefs, many of which retain their
colouring, represent the Pharaoh in presence of the gods. - Beside
the temples lie the ruins of the ancient town, and on a hill to the
W. are graffiti of the Middle Empire. In the desert close by are
ancient graves.

*EXCURSION TO THE SECOND CATARACT (5-9 hrs.) - The camels
or donkeys should be sent in advance to the ruined temples of Buhen,
whither the traveller proceeds by boat (see above) -, or the start may he
made from the W. bank immediately op osite Wtdi Haifa. The ride
from Buhen to the rack of Abusir takes 11, hr. by donkey.

After leaving the ruined temples the route at first skirts the
stream, then turns inland towards the desert, and finally, gradually
ascending, returns to the stream shortly before the cataract is reached.

The Second Cataract is superior in scenic beauty to the First
Cataract at Assufm. It lies at the N. end of the gorge of the Ba.tn
eHTagar ('belly of stones'), which begins at the island of Dil,
about 90 M. to the 8., and through which the river descends in a
