capital of 7875 inhab., is a steamboat station (p. 236) and the
starting-point for the highly interesting excursion to Abydos (p. 237).

3261/2 M. Abu Sluisheh (Abou Choucha), the ancient Egyptian
Ptlr) -su5s. About 3 M. to the S. lies Samhad. on ancient rubbish-
mounds. - 332 M. Abu Tisht. - 3341/2 M. Khargeh or Oasis June-
tion { Muaslet el-. Khdrgeh), for the oasis railway to El-khirgeh
(p. 380). Beyond (3381/2 M.) Farshtt the railway approaches
the Nile.

3431/2 M. Nag' 1iarniii1i is a district-capital with 3867 inhab.
and a large sugar-factory. The railway crosses the Nile here by a
large iron bridge and remains on the E. bank as far as Assuin.

M7% M. Ed-Dribeh (Dabbeh).

A little to the N. of the railway station, near some large quarries
amnng the Arabian hills, are the tombs of Jias.r ts.-b'itiyikd, belonging to
princes of the seventh nome of Upper Egypt. under the 6th Dynasty.

The large tomb situated farthest tn the left is that of the nemarch
Zauti. It consisted of two chambers, the partition-wall between which
has almost wholly disappeared. Its vaulted ceiling was hewn out of the
living rock. The representations in the interior have been largely destroyer ].
In the first (S.) chamber, to the right of the entrance, ships. In the rear
wall is a niche, whence a mummy-shaft descends obliquely. Farther tn
the left, in the s.w. corner, is a room with four niches, probably intended
for the coffins. In front of them is a bench. On the N. wall of the
secmid (NJ cha-mher are figures bearing funeral gifts and a large sacri-
fieial table, with a list of the gifts. On the W. wall is a niche with a
figure of the deceased. This tumh contains also inscriptions of the Middle
Empire, recording its restoration hy a descendant of Zauti.

The next tomb, farther tn the right, is that of a prince named Etu.
The interior is in the form of a rectangle, with the mummy-shaft opening
in the back-wall. The representation of Etu, to the left of the entrance,
is very lifelike and derives peculiar interest from the fact that the grandees
of the early period are seldom represented, as here, in full military
activity. Our hem lifts his arm vigorously to strike his foe. The mode
of wearing the hair and headdress, seen both in this figure and that of
Etu's wife, is unusual. Etu was a rich man, possessing, according to the
inscriptions, 2350 oxen. On the left side of the rear wall are several
scenes from the private life of the deceased. Cattle are being slaugh-
tered, cooks are busy at their work, etc. Above the door leading to the
mummy-shaft we see an unusually large table, adjoining which is along
but much damaged inscription.

The smaller tombs in the vicinity are less interesting. Several Coptic
inscriptions testify that onehorites found retreats in these tombs during
the Christian period.

355 M. Fen (Faou), with 15,448 inhab., is the Coptic Phbow1
where, at a large convent founded by Pachomius, the monks of all
the convents in Egypt used to assemble twice a year. A little farther
to the S., on the E. bank, lay Tabennésé, where Pachemius founded
the first convent about 320 A.I).

inhah., is situated on the ruins of an ancient town. - 363 M.
