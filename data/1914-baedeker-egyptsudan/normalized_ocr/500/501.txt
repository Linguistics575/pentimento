rebellion ot' Sheikh Ahmed in 1824, the residence of'Ali lizishit
Abu-Tarbtuh, who defended it against the insurgents.

On the left bank, as we draw near Thebes, rise high limestone
hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from which, however,
they are separated by a strip of fertile land. The right bank is tlatter,
and the Arabian hills retreat farther into the distance. Before
reaching the point where the W. chain projects a long curved mass
of rock towards the river, we see to the left first the great obelisk,
then the pylons of the temple of Earnak, half-concealed by palm
trees. When we clear the abrupt profile of the W. cliffs and new
formations are visible at its foot, we may catch a distant view of
Luxor towards the S.E. None of the buildings on the W. bank are
visible until the steamer has ascended as high as Karnak; then tirstthe
Colossi of Memnon and afterwards the Ramesseum and the Temple
of Deir el-Balm' come into view. As we gradually approach Luxor,
we distinguish the flags flying above the consular dwellings. The
Winter Palace Hotel and the castellated villa of a Dutch resident
are conspicuous in the background.
