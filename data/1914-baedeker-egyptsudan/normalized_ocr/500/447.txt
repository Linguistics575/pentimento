destroyed by violence. The most interesting are those of Khunes
and of Neter-sekheru, superintendent of the stereheuses of Upper
and Lower Egypt, under the New Empire.

At Nueirtd (El-Neweirat), a village farther to the s., are some
small rock-tombs belonging to the beginning of the Ancient Empire.

EXCURSION TO BENIUASAN, 15 M. (see p. 226). The traveller hires an
ass at Minyeh (ea. 20 pins.) and, making an early start (not forgetting
provisions and water), ferries to the right bank of the Nile (fare, incl. ass,
ea. 20pias.), which he ascends vi2 ffduriyet el-Jleitin (p. 208) and Ethn el,.
Al) mar (p. 208). Instead of returning the same way he should continue to
follow the right bank of the Nile to the (101/2 M.) Ruins of Antinottpolis
[ see below), visit the temple of Ramses there, and cross the river thence to
Raga (see below), whence the train may be taken to Minyeh. This is a
long but interesting day's journey.

On the bank of the Nile rises a lofty grove of palms. The vegeta-
tion is luxuriant. To the Th appear the hills of Ztrwiyet el-Meitin
and Ktun el-Alunar (p. 203), with a sheikh's tomb at the farther
end. Low rugged hills are seen on the left and a plain en the
right. - 160 M. Jlansalis. - From (166 M.) Abu'fer.kits (Abu
Ourgas), a distriet-eapital (6855 inhab.) with a sugar-faetory, we
obtain a view of Benil.1asan (p. 22C). - 170 M. Etlidem.

177 M. Rhea. is a considerable place (8263 inhah.), with post
and telegraph offiees and a sugar-factory. The nearest night-quar-
ters, however, are at Mellawi (p. 210) or Minyeh (p. 208; branch-.
rsilway) AboutaiM. inland, between the Ibréhimiyeh Canal and the
Baht Yt1snf and on a narrow-gauge line from Réda (which may be
used in one direction at least), is the village of El-Aslimunein
(accessible also from Mellawi). Close to the station of the light
railway lie the ruins of the once famous city of Khmunu (Coptic
Shmun), the HermOpolis of the Greeks, which from a very remote
period was the chief seat of the worship ofThout, the god of writing
and science. Numerous papyri of the Roman and Byzantine periods
have been discovered here. This town was also the capital of the
hare-nome, in Upper Egypt, whose princes under the Middle
Empire were buried on the E. bank ofthe Nile near Deir el-Bersheh
(see p. 210).

Several granite columns, probably belonging to the colounade of the
Greek Agora, are still standing. To the NARC, beyond the grove of palms,
are the considerable. relics of the pylon and the court of a sanctuary built
by Amenephthes. Still fartherto the N. are the ruins ofa temple of Philippus
Arrhidaeus. - At Tuneh el-aehel, on the opposite bank of the Barr Yrisuf,
are the extensive neeropolis of the ancient city and two rock-inscriptions
(much dilapidated) of Amenophis IV. (comp. p. 211).

Opposite lléda, on the E. bank, amid palms, lies the village of
Sheikh'Alutdeh, to the E. of which are the ruins ofAntinoupelis or
Antinoii, the town erected by Hadrian in 130 AD. in honour of his
favourite Antinous. The handsome youth is said to have drowned
himself here, to fulf11 the oracle which predicted a heavy loss to the
emperor and so to prevent a more serious disaster. The remains of
a Temple of Ramses II., the relic of an earlier foundation on this
site, may be traced to the N. of Sheikh'Abtdeh; of this only the
