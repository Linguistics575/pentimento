Mosque of' Mohammad el-'Abbési, with a tasteful minaret. An attrae-
tive excursion may he made to the Mosque of Abu Jlandftr, to the
S. of the town, beside the river; visitors should go by boat if the
wind is favourable, otherwise by donkey (1/9 hr.; 6 pies.) The hill

The railway crosses the Farkha Canal (p. 20) and soon comes
into sight of Lake Marcotis (p. 27), the water of which washes the
railway-embankment at places during the period of the inunda-
tion. Beyond Hadm (p. 20) and Stdi Gtrber (p. 25) our line diverges
to the right from that to Rosetta (p. 30). We cross the Jlalymutyeh
(? anal (p.15) by a drawhridge, and the triangular sails of the boats
which appear above its banks enable its course to be traced for
quite a distance. Cjottou-fields now appear to the left. - 17 M.

rejoins the main line at Damanlnh. (see below).

We pass several unimportant villages, with the ciay-built grey
houses, crowned by cupolas, Which are so characteristic a feature
of the whole Delta landscape. - 28 M. Aba 1.lotrururr

paration of the cotton from the seeds. The Arab cemetery lies close
