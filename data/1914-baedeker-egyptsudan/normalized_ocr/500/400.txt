Levantines). The industries to Which the town owed its former
prosperity still exist to some extent. There are, for instance, several
cotton mills and silk factories, the latter of which produce the black

silk of the'liabara' worn by Moslem women (comp. p. 47).

HISTORY. Little or nothing is known of the early history of Damietta.
During the Arabian era Damietta attained a great reputation on aeeount
of the resistance it offered to the Crusaders; but the town of that period
stood farther to the N. than its modern successor (see below). In 1218 it
was besieged by King John of Jerusalem. With the aid of an ingenious
double boat, constructed and fortified in accordance With a design by
Oliverius, an engineer of Cologne, the Frisians, Germans, and others
nt' the besiegers succeeded after a fight of twenty-iive hours in capturing
the tower to which the chain stretched across the river was attached.
The success of the Christians was, however, considerably marred by the
interference of the ambitious though energetic, Pelagius Galvani, the
papal legate, and by the vigilance of the Egyptian sultan Malik el-Kftmil.
At length, after various vicissitudes, the Christians captured the place.
They obtained valuable spoil, sold the surviving townspeople as slaves,
and converted the mosques into churches, but in 1221 they were compelled
by a treaty to evacuate the town. In 1249, when Louis IX. lauded near
Damietta, it was abandoned by its inhabitants. Without striking a blow
the Crusaders marched into the deserted streets of the fortress, but in the
course of the following year they were obliged to restore it to the Saracens
as part of the ransom of Louis IX., who had been taken prisoner at Mantsiira
fp. 173). During the same year, by a resolution of the Emirs, the town was
destroyed, and was re-ereeted on the E. bank of the river, farther to the S.
The new town soon became an important manufacturing and commer-
cial place. Its staple products were leather-wares, cloth, and oil of sesame,
for which it was famous, and its harbour was visited by ships of many
different nations. Owing to the construction of the 3ltWmtldiyeh Canal
Damietta lost most of its trade, which, however, is now on the increase,

Seen from the railway station Damietta still presents an im-
posing appearance, with its lofty houses flanking the river; but this
by 110 means corresponds with the interior of the town, where the
buildings are mostly humble brick erections. The European quar~
ter lies upstream, with the spacious Government Hospital and the
Coastguards' Barracks. Here is also the principal Mosque (Girrn"
el-Bahr), with two lofty minarets and a spacious dome. Connected
with it is a university (223 students, 46 professors). In the vicinity
are a Roman Catholic and a Greek church. Close to the river stands
the mosque of El-f1fatbultyeh, founded by Sultan Wit Bey in 1475
along with its institute (Ashrafigeh). The principal street, upwards
of 1 M. long, forms the busy bazaar of the town. Many of the houses
are provided with handsomely carved wooden jutties and lattice-
work, which are in most cases very ancient and differ materially
in style from the mashrabiyehs of Cairo.

To the N. of the town, in the suburb of El-6'ehiAmeh, is the
dilapidated mosque of Abu'l Ma'Ã©teh. The building appears to date
from the period of the old town of Damietta and has Cmiie inserip-
tions in front. The interior contains numerous antique columns,
two of which, standing on the same base, offer a test of honesty,
like those in the Mosque of Amr at Cairo (p. 110). Another column
