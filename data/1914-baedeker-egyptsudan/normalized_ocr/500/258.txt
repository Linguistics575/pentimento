on to the next turning) into the long line of thoroughfare beginning
with the Shin" el-Khordagiyeh, and at the first cross-street on the
right we enter a large covered bazaar, known as the Khan er-Khalili.

The Khan el-Khalili (Pl. E, 3), still the centre of the market
traftie of Cairo, was founded in 1400 by Garkas el-khalili, master
of the horse to Sultan Barlirilr, on the site of a chateau of the Fati-
mites. It forms a distinct quarter of the city, and is intersected by
a main street and numerous cross-lanes, formed by long rows of
stalls of tradesmen and artisans, all covered over. Here are the
headquarters of the silk and carpet merchants and the vendors of
trinkets. We follow the main avenue, the SIKK'BT EL-BADISTAN,
which contains two graceful Arab gateways. In the first lane on the
left is the Bazaar of the Shoemakers, in which the red shoes of the
Arabs may be purchased. Farther on, to the right of the main street,
are some large Carpet Bazaars..

The prices of Carpets, like those of other oriental goods, are liable
to great fh1etuation. As soon as a purchaser appears, the dealers spread
their wares over the whole court for his inspection. Patience and time
are essential for a satisfactory bargain (comp. p. 51). The black or white
tulle shawls, embroidered with gold and silver thread, are sold by the best
dealers by weight-, the price varies from 3 to 6 mill. per dirhem (48.15 gr.
troy). Many of the so-called Damascene silks, and particularly the lighter
Kuff'tyehs in pleasing colours, are manufactured at Lyons and Crefeld.

Taking the second tross-lane on the right and passing through
an interesting Arab Gateway, with stalactite vaulting, inscriptions,
serpentine ornamentation, and a few mosaics, we enter the attrat-.
tive Brass Bazaar (Shiri' Khan el-Khalili). From this bazaar we
enter the Shirir esh-Sharawtni (p. 53) or go on through the Sikket
cl-Bidisttn. Opposite the end of the latter, in the Mashhad el-
l.loseini, is the -

Gan" Seiyidna'IWosein or El-Hasanein (Pl. E, 3), the mosque
of the youthful Hosein, who fell at Kerbela in 680 A.D. in battle
against the enemies of his father Ali, son-in-law of the prophet,
who was slain in 661. Hosein is still highly venerated by Shiite
Mohammedans (p. xcii), particularly in Persia. The mosque (in-
accessible to non-Moslems) is of no architectural importance, while
it has been almost completely modernized, even to the introduction
of gas-lighting. The chief attraction is the mausoleum, which con-
tains the head of Hosein, said to have been brought to Cairo in a
green silk bag. This mosque is chiefly frequented by men on Thurs-
days and by women on Saturdays.

From the mosque we turn to the s., cross the Shtrit esh-Shara-
wani obliquely, and enter the SHAEI' Err-WrswAtor (Pl. E, 3), which
is mainly occupied by the stalls of the Booksellers.

Most of the booksellers are also scholars, and their shops are the resort
of the learned world of Cairo. As the prices of books vary greatly in
accordance with the demand and other circumstances, and as there is no
such thing as a fixed publishing price, purchasers should always endea-
vour to ascertain beforehand the true value of any work they wish to
buy. As in the case of many other wares, the line between new and
