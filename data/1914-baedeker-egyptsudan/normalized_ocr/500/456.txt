deceased princess on the bier, beside which stand the king and queen
and professional mourners; in the upper row the royal pair, the nurse
with a little princess, and the mourners loudly lament the deceased. The
Second Room (P1. o contains no representations. On the rear wall of
the Third Room (P1. k) the mummy of the princess is shown (on the left)
standing under a canopy, while in front of it the royal family and court
are mourning. This scene is continued on the right wall. On the left
wall we see the mummy lying below the same canopy; in front is the
mourning royal family, while farther to the right is the nurse with a
young princess at her breast. On the entrance-wall are objects with which
the tomb was furnished (much injured). - We return to the steps at d.

quarries oflimestone and alabaster. The most important are the Ala-
butter Quarries of flet-nub, about 15 M. distant, to Which a path run-
ning eastwards to the S. of the S. group of tombs leads. These
quarries are ascertained from inscriptions to have been worked under

the Ancient Empire and at the beginning of the Middle Empire.
