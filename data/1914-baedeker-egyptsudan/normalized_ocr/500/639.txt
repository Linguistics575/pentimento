Convent of S". Simeon. ASSURN. N. Route. 361

The ruined *Convent of St. Simeon (Deir Anba Samtft" on) is situ-
ated on a hill in the desert 0n the W. bank of the Nilo. Landing
opposite the S. end ofElephautine, we follow a desert-valley, passing
several roclr-tombs, and in 20 min. reach our goal, Nothing ter-
tain is known as to the date of the origin of the convent which was
destroyed by the expedition sent to Nubia by Saladin in 1173. It
stands surrounded by a wall, over'20 ft. high, the lower part of
which is built of rough stone, the upper part of crude bricks; the
lower W. portion is hewn out of the rock. The MAIN BUILDING has
two stories. The lower story contains a large central vaulted corri-
dor, with cells opening off it on each side. On the W. wall of the
corridor is a painting (much defaced) of Christ enthroned, with the
Archangel Minhael and six Apostles beside him. Each of the small
cells contained six 01' eight beds, some of which still remain. At
the N.W. angle is the refectory. The dilapidated staircase is con-
tinued in the S. angle to the next story, and thence to the roof. -
Below the main building are several rock-hewn cells and a rock-
chapel, with a painted ceiling and pictures of saints.

To the SE. of the main building, between it and the girdle
wall, is the CHURCH, comprising nave and aisles and a choir with
sacristies on each side. The roof was vaulted throughout. In the
semi-dome of the choir is a fine painting of Christ enthroned, be-
tween four angels. At the W. end of the nave, opposite the choir,
is a domed recess with a fresco of Christ with two angels bowing
before him. There are numerous Coptic inscriptions in the sa-
cristies. - A Coptic service (comp. p. 107) is occasionally held in
this church.

From the convent we may go along the ridge in a S. direction to
(1/2 hr.) two High CIWS, one of which, looking from the Cataract
Hotel like a gigantic pig, is covered with inscriptions. In 10 min.
more we reach a hill of dark stone, which affords a superb *VIEW
of the cataract district, extending on the S. to Phila, and on the N. to
(hezireh (p. Mi). A similar view is obtained from the tomb of
Shaikh Osman. - The direct route from the convent to the Nile
passes an extensive neeropolis, on a plateau strewn with dark stones.
0n the river-bank are numerous rock-tornbs.

Another very interesting exmlrsion may be made through the
Western Desert to the Quarries to the N. of the Convent of St. Simeon
(there and back 2 hrs.). From the Rock Tombs (p. 358) we first
follow the telegraph-posts and then a route, indicated by heaps of
stones, which runs to the N. to a Sandstone Quarry, still containing
the upper part of an obelisk with a representation and inscription
ofSethos I. We return vii the village of Gharlr-As8udn (West Assu√©n)
to the landing-stage at the Rock Tombs (p. 359).

A favourite afternoon excursion leads to the N. from the station
