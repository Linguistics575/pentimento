of Hathor. DENDERA. 19. Route, 247

all the following rooms of the temple, with the exception of the
second store-room to the left of this hall and the crypts (p. 248), the
eartouches of the king are left empty, probably because the priests
were in doubt as to which ruler should be selected for honour in
the unsettled times during which the temple was built.

Some of the RELIEFS in the lower row, representing the ceremonies
performed by the king at the foundation of the temple, deserve notice. To
the right of the Entrance (P1. g): the king, wearing the crown of Lower
Egypt, quits his palace, preceded by a priest oCering incense; to the left
the king cleaves the earth with a hoe on the site of the temple - turns
the firgt sod, as we should express it; in front of him is the goddess
Hathor. - To the left of the Entrance (Pl. h): the king, with the crown
of Upper Egypt, quits his palace (as above); to the right he presents
Hathor with bricks, representing the building-material for the new temple.

On each side of this hall are three CHAMBERS, used as laboratory,
treasury, and store-rooms for the saeritieial incense, etc. The in-
scriptions and representations show the Pharaoh in presence of
Rather, the lion-headed Horus of Dendera, and other gods.

We next enter the First Antechamber C'Saerifieial Chamber),
which is lighted by apertures in the roof and walls and is decorated
with four rows of mural reliefs. The latter, with reference to the
purpose of the chamber, represent the king presenting different
offerings to Hathor and other deities. To the right and left are pass-
ages, leading to the staircases which ascend to the roof of the
temp1e (p. 249). On the left is also a small chamber used for saeri-
ticial offerings.

The Second Antechamber (% entral Hall'), which we next enter,
is lighted by means of apertures in the side-walls and has four
rows of bas-reliefs on the walls. A door to the left opens into a
small room used as a Wardrobe, in which perfumes were preserved
as well as the sacred garments with which the images of the
goddess were embellished at festivals .--- The corresponding door
on the right side of the hall leads to three connected Rooms, which
to a certain extent form a special enclosed sanctuary, within the
large temple. We see here first a small store-room, connected by
a Corridor (Pl. i) with the W. staircase (p. 249). Thence we enter
an open Court, beyond which is a charming KIOSQUE, approached
by steps and supported by two sistrum-columns. These are con-
nected with the side-walls by two stone screens rising to half the
height of the columns. Here the priests assembled to celebrate
the birthday of [ lather and the immediately following great new
year's festival. The saeriileial gifts were offered in the court, as
represented on the 1eft (E.) wall. The walls of the kiosque are em-
bellished with three rows of representations, showing the king and
various deities in presence of the gods of Deudera. Just above the
floor is a procession of local deities (1., those of Upper Egypt, r.,
those of Lower Egypt) bearing gifts. On the ceiling the sky-goddess
Nut is depicted with the sun rising from her lap and shining upon
a head of Hathor, that typifies the temple of Dendera.
