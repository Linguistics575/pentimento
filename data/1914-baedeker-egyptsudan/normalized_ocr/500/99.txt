m. MOHAMMEDAN CUSTOMS. xciii

Remarks on Mohammedan Customs.

The rite of circumcision is performed on boys up to the age of
six or seven, or even later, the ceremony being attended with great
pomp. The child is previously conducted through the streets in hot iday
attire; in order to diminish the expense of the proceedings, the
procession is frequently united with some bridal party, or two "
more boys are driven together in a carriage. The boy generally
wears a turban of red cashmere, girls' clothes of the richest poss-
ible description, and conspicuous female ornaments, which are
designed to attract attention and thus avert the evil eye from his
person. He half covers his face with an embroidered handkerchief;
and the barber who performs the operation and a noisy troop of
musicians head the procession. The first personage in the procession
is usually the barber's boy, carrying tho'lieml', or barber's sign, a
kind of cupboard made of wood, in the form of a half-eylimler, with
four short legs.

Girls are generally married in their 12th or 13th, and some-
times as early as their 10th year. A man in search of a bride
employs the services of a relative or of a professional female mateh-
maker, and he never has an opportunity of seeing his bride until
the wedding-day, except when the parties belong to the lowest
classes. When everything is arranged, the affianeed bridegroom
has to pay a bridal-portion frnahr) amounting to about 25 L, less
being paid when the bride is a widow. Generally speaking, about
twe-thirds of the sum, the amount of which always forms a suhjeet
of lively discussion, is paid down, while one-third is settled upon
the wife, being payable on the death of the husband or on his
divorcing her against her will. Before the wedding the bride is
conducted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the bath. This
procession is called'Zeffet el-llamrtu" un'. It is headed by several
musicians with hautbois and drums; these are followed by several
married female friends and relatives of the bride in pairs, and after
these come a number of young girls. The bride follows, under a
silken eanoPy open in front. In Cairo, however, this emmpy is now
generally replaced by a carriage of some kind. The shrieks of joy
which women of the lower classes utter on such occasions are called
saghi'crit (sing. zaglmita ]. The bride is afterwards conducted with
the same formalities to the house of her husband.

The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable
than those that attend weddings. If the death occurs in the morn-
ing, the funeral takes place the same day; but if In the evening,
it is postponed till next day. The body is washed and mourned
over by the family and the professional mourning women { nedda-
beh); the /ilyh, or schoolmasters, read several strehs of the Koran
by its side; after this, it is wrapped in its white or green winding
sheet, placed on the bier, and then carried forth in solemn pro-
