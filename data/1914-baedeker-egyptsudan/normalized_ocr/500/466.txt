iron doors. Travellers whose time is limited may content themselves
with a visit to the four chief tombs (Nos. 17, 15, 3, 2). For remarks 0n
the construction of the tombs, see p. clxx.

The path that ascends to the tombs brings us first to No. 32.
Here we turn to the N. (left) and proceed to -

*Tosnt 17, which belonged to Kheti, son of Beket and nomarch
of the gazelle-nome (tith Dyn.). The facade is simple. We enter
the Rock Chamber, the roof of which was originally borne by six
1otns-eolurnns with bud- capitals, though only two, with well-
preserved colouring, are now standing. The wall-paiutings are in
good condition. Left Wall (N.). In the top rows is a hunt in the
desert, in the lower rows, male and female dancers, the statue of
the deceased. being borne to its place, carpenters, etc. Rear Wall
(FI.). Above are wrestlers in various attitudes; below, military
scenes, attack on a fortress. Right Wall (8.). From left to right:
the deceased and his wife; the deceased accompanied by his fan-
bearer, sandal-bearer, two dwarfs, etc; the deceased receiving offer-
ings (notice the barn on the right). - Farther to the N., at the end
of an ancient path ascending from the plain, is -

*TOMB 15, belonging to Beket (or Bulcet), uomarch of the gazelle-
nome (11th Dyn.). The two columns which supported the roof of the
rectangular chamber have been destroyed. In the S.E. angle is a
small niche (serdib; p. Clxviii). Left Wall (N). Above, hunting in
the desert; barber, washermen, painters, etc. Below, the deceased
and his wife, with four rows ofwomen spinning and weaving, female
dancers, girls playing at ball; herdsmen bringing animals for sacri-
fiee to the dead; goldsmiths; fishing; various birds, with their
names inscribed beside them.' Rear Wall (E.). Above, wrestlers;
below, military scenes (resembling those in Tomb ro. Right Wall
(S.), The deceased, in front of whom, in several rows, are men
drawing a shrine containing a statue of the dead; in front are fe-.
male dancers and attendants bearing ornaments, etc., for the statue;
peasants bringing their f1oeks and herds; peasants forcibly brought
to testify as to taxes, while scribes note down the amounts; potters
with wheels; men carrying slaughtered birds; men gambling.

TOMB 3 is that of Khnemhotep, the son of Neheri, a scion of a
princely family with hereditary jurisdiction over the gazelle-nome
and over the E. districts, the capital of which was Monet-KI.
Khnemhotep was invested by King Amenemhtit II. with the latter
districts and married a daughter of the governor of the ilog-nome
(Cynopolis, p. 207), which was inherited by a son of this marriage.

The VESTIBULE, which formerly stood behind an open court, is
borne by two sixteen-sided columns tapering towards the top. The
cornice projects considerably above the architrave and is ostensibly
supported by tine laths, hewn, like all the rest of the structure, out
of the living rock. The resemblance of these laths to the mutules
of the Lorie, order is worthy of mention.
