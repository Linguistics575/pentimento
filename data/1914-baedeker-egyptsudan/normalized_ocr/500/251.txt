extent. The'Sherifs', or descendants of the prophet, now frequently
wear white turbans, though originally they wore green, the colour
of the prophet. Green turbans are now worn by the Mecca pilgrims
of a year's standing. The various orders of dervishes are similarly
distinguished; the Rifa'iyeh wear black, dark-blue, or bluish-greeu
turbans, the Ahmediyeh red, the KÃ©diriyeh white. The'Ulami, or
clergy and scholars, usually wear a very wide, evenly folded turban
of light colour. The orthodox length of a believer's turban is seven
times that of his head, being equivalent to the whole length of his
body, in order that the turban may afterwards be used as the wearer's
winding-sheet, and that this circumstance may familiarize him with
the thought of death. Many Mohammedans now, however, wear
European dress or adopt a semi-Europeau, semi-oriental costume;
a common head-gear is the red .tarbibsh (erroneously known as a fer,
by most Europeans). Little difference is now observable between
the costume of the Copts, Jews, and other oriental'unbelievers' and
that of the Moslem Egyptians, except that the (Joptiepriests usually
wear a black turban.

The Women of the poorer and rustic classes wear nothing but a
black gown and a veil. Their ornaments consist of silver, c0pper,
glass, or bead bracelets, earrings, and anklets, while their chins,
arms, and chests are often tatooed with blue marks. Similar tatooing
is common also among the men. In Upper Egypt nose-rings also
are frequently seen. The women of the upper classes are never so
handsomely dressed in the streets as at home. When equipped for
riding or walking they wear a silk cloak, with very wide sleeves
(ttslr or sableh), over their home attire. They don also the bar.ku', or
veil, which consists of a long strip of muslin, covering the whole
of the face except the eyes and reaching nearly to the feet. Lastly
they put on the habam, a kind of mantle, which in the case of
married women consists of two breadths of glossy black silk. The
Coptic, Jewish, and Syrian women wear the same costume, but are
generally unveiled. The wealthier ladies, who drive in their car-
riages attended by eunuchs, usually veil their faces up to their eyes
with thin white gauze after the fashion of Constantinople. Egyp-
tian women colour their eyelashes and eyelids dark, and their finger
and toe nails with henna, which gives them a brownish-yellow
tint. (Circumcision, weddings, and funerals, see pp. xciii et seq.)

Amid this busy throng of men and animals resound the Warm-
ing shouts of coachmen, donkey-attendants, and camel-drivers.
The words most commonly heard are -'riglalc, riglak','shirntlak',
'yemfnak','ti'tt, trd'. As a rule, these warnings are accompanied
by some particularizing title. Thus,'rigluk git rntfsyu' (monsieur),
