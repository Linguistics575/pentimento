Tl. EGYPTIAN RELIGION. Cxlv

custom adopted by the kings of Egypt of wearing the urzeus serpent
as a diadem or as an ornament in their crowns. - Another concep-
tion identified the sun with the sun-god Re, who, in the guise of an
Egyptian tisherman, sailed in a boat on the waters of the sky by day,
and in the evening stepped into another boat and continued his voyage
through the underworld. As the sun-god RÃ©-liarakhte was a falcon
the sun was sometimes regarded as a brilliantly plumaged falcon
soaringin the firmament; or like Horus the sun was a powerful young
hero, waging a ceaseless combat with the hostile powers of darkness.
It was conceived of also under the form of a Scarabneus or beetle
(p.01xxvii); the sun-god was represented in the form of a seara-
bteus rolling the round disk of the sun in front of him, in the same
way as a scarabzeus rolls the small ball in which it has laid its egg.
The Egyptians of course did not believe that the world, the gods,
and human beings had always existed, but that they were created.
The most widespread belief was that Kel', the god of the earth, and
Nut, the goddess of the sky, lay in close union in Nun, the primasval
ocean, nntii Show, the god of the air. separated them by raising Nut
aloft in his arms. The sun-god RE also was supposed to have arisen
from Nun; another view, however, made him the child of Keh and
Nut, newborn every morning. These ideas of course conflict with the
other conception that Re himself created the world (see p. cxliV).
1n the course of its history the religion of Egypt underwent
many transformations. The dominant position in the Egyptian pan-
theon shifted from one god to another, either through theological
speculation and the growth of legends, or through the coming into
prominence of royal houses and cities that were devoted to the cult
of particular gods. In the primitive period two independent king-
doms were formed in Upper and Lower Egypt, and Seth, of Omhos,
and Horus, of Buto, the local deities of the two capitals, were re-
eognized as guardians of the two states. After the first union of the
two kingdoms had been operated from Lower Egypt, presumably
with Heliopolis as the capital, II0tus became recognized as the sole
royal god, and henceforth remained the patron of the Pharaohs and
god of the empire. In the latest period of the prehistoric epoch Egypt
was again divided into two kingdoms, tho capitals being El-kilo (in
Upper Egypt) and liuto; the patron deity of the former was the vul-.
ture-goddess Nekhbeyet, of the latter the serpent-goddess Buto. These
thus became the royal goddesses of Upper and Lower hgypt. 1n the
same way at the end of the Ancient Empire Ptah, the local deity of
the capital Memphis, became the patron deity of the whole of Egypt.
An important rile in the religious history of Egypt has been played
by the city of ON-HBLIOPOLIS (p. l'20), which was probably the
religious centre of Lower Egypt in the earliest period, and in all
likelihood was for a time the capital of the united kingdom of Egypt.
The eoronation ceremonies of the sovereign seem to have taken place
in the temple of this city, and here, too, according to legend, the
Raspexsn's Egypt. 7th Edit. k
