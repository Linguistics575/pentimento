the W. bank, the desert advances clear up to the river-brink. The
population is in consequence very scanty, viz. 96,500 in 1897.
Comp. p.11. - All the countries on the Upper Nile, from the
borders ongypt southwards, were included by the ancient Egyptians
under the single name of Kosh, the Cash of the Bible. The Greeks
and Romans called them Ethiopia. Lower Nubia was more particularly
known to the Egyptians as the land of Scti and consisted, as it does
to-day, of a number of separate districts (e.g. the land of Weird).
The present inhabitants of Nubia are more faithful to their ancient
manners and customs than the Egyptians. When the huge storage-
lake, extending far into Northern Nubia, was formed by the dam at
Assuin, the villages within its basin were either deserted or rc-
moved to the heights. This fact accounts for the numerous ruined
villages seen under water or on the edge of the lake (comp. p. 384).

History. Lower Nubia, whence the Egyptians procured their
supplies of incense and other products of the sedan, is mentioned
in some of the earliest Egyptian texts. Its relations with Egypt were
still closer under the kings of the 6th Dyn., who there enlisted negro
mercenaries, while the princes of Elephantine dispatched great
trading expeditions to the lands of the Upper Nile. But it was not
until the period of the 12th Dyn. that the conquest of Nubia was
undertaken and the borders of Egypt advanced to Semneh (p. 413).
in order to guard the newly acquired possessions against the attacks
of the negroes a chain of forts was erected in the rocky valley of Batu
ol-Oat'," (p. dill), with its numerous cataracts, between I.lalfa and
Semneh. From this base the Pharaohs of the 18th Dyn. penetrated
still farther to the S. and made themselves masters of the land of
Kosh as far as Napata (p. 419), which then became the southernmost
city of the empire. The conquered regions were incorporated with
the southernmost department ofEgypt proper, which began at El-Eib
(p. 333), and the whole of the great province thus formed was placed
under an official who bore the title of'Prinee of Kosh and Governor
of the Southern Lands'. Under the established rule of Egypt Nubia
rapidly prospered; new towns were founded, and beautiful temples,
little inferior ill size and embellishment to those of the motherland,
arose in profusion, especially on the W. bank of' the Nile, which
was safer from the attacks of the E. Beduins. Most of these temples
M ere dedicated to the great Egyptian gods, Amen, Ré-liarakhte,
and Ptah; but in some of them other deities also were worshipped,
such "Isis and others of the Egyptian gods, the local Nubian god
Teiun, the deceased King Sesostris 111., who united the réles of
first conqueror and patron-saint of Nubia, and occasionally also the
reigning king and queen (pp. 305, 398, dog, 408, 409). The temple
inscriptions were composed in the Egyptian language and written
in the Egyptian character, and Egyptian became the official lan-
guage, although the great mass of the people adhered to their native
Nubian tongue.
