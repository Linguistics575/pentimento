Clxxxvi VIII. BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEI) ANS.

than those of the liwéus, is provided with a wooden cupola or lantern,
with coloured-glass windows of the kind known as Famttrtyehs. These
tcamartyehs are plaster-slabs, about 11/4 inch in thickness, per-
forated, while still soft, with patterns representing vases of flowers,
houses, geometrical figures, writing-characters, etc., the openings
being afterwards filled in with coloured glass. Owing to the above-
mentioned difference in the height of the ceilings, two of the walls
of the ilurliifa rest upon supports which are based upon massive
brackets reaching far down 011 the main side-walls. This arrange-
ment results in a curious kind of tlat arch, against which some of
the beams of the liwén-ceiling lean. The durWa is paved with
coloured marbles and frequently has a fountain in the centre. The
liwiins are paved with ordinary stone slabs, concealed by rugs or
carpets. On one wall of the durlrira there is always a Suffa, a shelf
on which are placed the cups, ete. used in entertaining guests.
The walls of the liwéns are panelled to the height of 6-10 ft., and
against them are placed divans, above which is a broad cornice-shelf,
on which are arranged porcelain, chased metal-work, and similar
ornaments. Instead of panelling, the walls of the durlpi'a have marble
mosaics. The upper part of the walls is usually covered with smooth
plaster or, in exceptional cases, with plaques of coloured fayence.
The expanse of white wall is usually broken by a grated recess in-
tended for female singers and accessible from without. At the very
top of the wall is a broad concave frieze, embellished with inserip-
tions or stalactites, and forming the transition to the usually elab-
orate ceiling-decorations. Light and air are admitted to theiroom
from one ofthe ends, where mashrabiyehs are inserted in the lower
part of the wall and tamariyehs in the upper part.

The Public Baths, usually of quite 1anpretending exterior, are
frequently very large erections in which marble is not spared; in
their heating arrangements they are modelled on ancient Roman
vapour-baths (comp. p. xxvii).

The Okellas (p. 50) were important ediflces when the caravan
trade, especially the earavan-trade with the Red Sea, flourished.
Their often extensive facades are of a peculiar type. The portals
resemble those of the mosques, and the doors and shutters of the
outer shops are sometimes carved. The central open court accom-
modated the caravan, the goods brought by which were deposited in
vaulted chambers on the groundfloor, while the rooms in the upper
stories, opening off galleries, were used as lodgings by the merchants.
The centre of the court seems in each case to have been occupied
by a simple prayer-room (mosalla).

When we come to analyse the impressions produced by a study
of Arabic buildings in Egypt, we find that our admiration of the
harmonious and tasteful ornamentation, unsurpassed by any school
of architecture, is counterbalanced by a certain feeling of wsthetic
di ssatisfaotion. The main reason why Arabian art failed to reach a high
