PHAGUS CHAMBER (It) of later construction. From the entrance to
the upper floor (B), on each side of which is a semicircular re-
cess with benches, we enter a1loaavsDA (C). In the middle of this,
covered by a kind of cupola, is a shaft leading to the lower stories.
To the right lie two SMALLER 1loous (D, E), with niches and sar-
cophagi. Above the latter are loculi or slie1r-iornhs. To the left
is the'I'RICLINIUM FUNEBRE (F), a large room with a ceiling borne
by four pillars. Three wide platforms or divans have been hewn
out of the rock for the banquets held in honour of the deceased. -
The STAIRCASE (G), which commands ll good view of the chief se-
pulchral chambers, divides farther down into two tr1ghts, flanking
the entrance to the lower story (11) and leading to the VESTIBULE (J)
of the grave-chamber proper.

The faqade of the vestibule is articulated by two Egyptian col-
umns, with elaborate flower-capitals, which bear a cornice adorned
with the winged solar disk and with falcons; above this is the flat
arch of the pediment. Inside, in deep niches to the right and left,
are STATUES of the deceased and his wife in Egyptian dress, carved
in white limestone. The door in the rear wall of the vestibule is
surmounted by the winged sun's disk and a Urzeus frieze. To the
right and left, on pedestals, are two large serpents with the Egyptian
double crown, the caduceus of Hermes, and the thyrsus of Diony-
sos. Above are shields with heads of Medusa.

We now enter the SEPULCHRAL (hrAMnmt (K). The sarcoPhagi
containing the remains stand in niches (jv-c) and are hown, likc
their lids, out of the solid rock. The fronts are adorned, after the
Greek fashion, with fest0011s,1nasks, hea11s of Medusa, buerania,
and bunches of grapes. On the middle one is a reclining figure of
the deceased. The walls of the niches are den orated with represent-
ations of religious import.

Round the sepulchral chamber runs a GALLERY (L), entered from
the passage in front of the vestibule, with two rows of shelf-tombs
(01 in all). Each of these contained at least three mummies. The
names and ages of the deceased, in red paint, are still visible on
some of the slabs. -.. At the back of the gallery is a SARCOPHAGUS
CHAMBER (M), with three tomb-niches and plain pillars. Adjoining
the W. part of the gallery are four LATER Rooms (N-Q), with shelf-
tombs and sarcophagns-niches.
