stene instead of the usual granite. The w. obelisk, bearing a Greek and
several Arabic inscriptions, is still standing, though it has lost its apex;
the E. obelisk is represented by its base only.

The WEST COLONNADE, which follows the line of the shore of the
island, is 100 yds. in length and has a row of31 (formerly 32) plant
columns, each lil ft. high, no two capitals of which are alike. Most
of the columns have reliefs showing Tiberius offering gifts to the
gods. The ceiling, which is partly destroyed, is decorated with stars
and flying vultures. The rear wall is embellished with two rows
of bas-reliefs, representing the Pharaoh. (usually Augustus or Ti-
berius) offering various gifts to the gods .--- A subterranean stair-
way leads outside this colonnade to a small Nitomcter.

The EAST COLONNADE is unfinished; only six of its 10 columns
are completed, the remainder were left merely rough-hewn. The
11nfinished capitals should be noticed. In the back-wall are five
doors, which led to various chapels.

This olennade is adjoined at its S. end by the now very ruinous TEMPLE
ob" Ithu-mgMs-NUFErt, (Irarettsrtuphit), erected by PhilopatOr and Ergamenes,
his Nubian eonternpmratry, and extended by Epiphanes. Upon the existing
walls, some of which have been rebuilt, are representations in raised and
incised reliefs of the customary scenes. in which Philopator, Ergamenes,
Epiphanes, and Tiberius figure as the Pharaoh .--Behind the central part
of the colonnade lay the email CHAPEL orr MANDULIS, a Nubian deity, now
in a very fragmentary condition; and at the N. and of the colonnade is
a well preserved little TEMPLE OF IMHOTEP (zEsculapz'm; p. cli), built by
Philadelphus.

The *Temple of Isis, dedicated to Isis and her son Harpocrates,
was the principal sanctuary on the island and probably occupies
the site of an earlier shrine. Its erection, begun by Ptolemy Phila-
delphus, was completed in its essential details by Euergetes L, but
its embellishment with inscriptions and reliefs was a very gradual
process, and at not a few points was never finished.

The First Pylon, 150 ft. broad and 60ft. high, consists of two
towers and a central portal, decorated by Nelrtanebi5s with the custom-
ary reliefs. On the front of the right (E.) tower appears a huge
figure of the Pharaoh (Ptolemy Neos Dionysos) in the usual atti-
tude, grasping a band of enemies by the hair, and raising his club
for the fatal stroke. To the left stand Isis, the falcon-headed
Horus of Edfu, and Hathor. Above are two reliefs: to the right,
the king (Neos Dionysos) presents the crown of Upper and Lower
Egypt to Horus and Nephthys; to the left, he offers incense to Isis
and IIarpoerates. 0n the left (W.) tower are similar representations,
and at the foot are numerous demotie and Greek inscriptions. A
doorway, embellished with reliefs by Philometor, leads through the
left tower direct to the entrance of the Birth House (p. 367). In
front of the pylon formerly stood two obelisks, erected by Euer-
getes IL, and two lions, all of granite. The obelisks are now in the
possession of Mr. Bankes, Kingston Hall, Dorsetshire.

Adjoining the E. py1on-tower, to the right, is an elegant Gateway,
which was built by Ptolemy Philadelphus and originally stood in a
