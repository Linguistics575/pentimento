No. JO is the Tomb of Amen-rneses, one of the claimants of the
throne at the end of the 19th Dyu. (p. ciii). His mother Takhat

and his wife Beket-werer also were
buried here. The representations in
this tomb have been deliberately
destroyed.

**No. ff. Tomb of Ramses III.
(lighted). This imposing tomb, 11tirl-
ally called'Bruee's Tomb' (after its
discovered) or'The Harper's Tomb',
is inferior in size to Nos. 17 and 14
only. The execution of the sculp-
tures is not the best, but their variety
is exceptional. This tomb possesses
a unique peculiarity in the ten side-
chambers, opening off the first two
corridors. The tomb was begun and
finished as far as Room 111 by Seth-
nakht, father of Ramses 111.; his car-
touches are still to be seen at various
places where the later stucco has
fallen off.

The entrance is approached by
the usual flight of steps with an in-
clined plane in the middle; on each
side of it are two pilasters adorned
with cows' heads. On the lintel of
the door is the usual representation
of Isis and Nephthys worshipping
the tmn-disk, in which are a scara-
bteus and the ram-headed sun-god.

CORRIDOR 1. To the right and
left of the entrance are kneeling
figures of the goddess of truth,
sheltering those who enter with her
wings. On the Left Wall is the king
before 1larakhie, followed by the
title of the'praising of Ire', the sun
between a serpent, a crocodile, and
two gazetles' heads. Then follows
the text of the'praising of RE',
which is continued on the Right
Wall. - SIDE CHAMBER. 1 (to the
left): Baking, slaughtering, and
cooking scenes. - SIDE CHAMBER 2
