Abu Tarfa (W. bank). About l M. to the S. is a. rock-cave with

At KubNshNs (Kobosh), on the W. bank, are ancient quay-wails with

On the W. bank, opposite the village of Dendtr (E. bank), ap-
pears the small -

Temple of Dendiir, built by Augustus and dedicated to various
gods, including Pete-ite and Pe-Hor, the sons of Kuper, two local
deified heroes. The temple stands upon a platform, immediately at
the foot of the mountains, and is preceded by a broad terrace. Of the
PYLox, whieh formed the entrance to the temple, only the stone il00r-
way remains; the towers, probably built of'brick, have disappeared.
At the top of the portal is, the winged sun-disk, and within and
on the front (13.) and back (IC) is the emperor saerifleing to various
gods. Beyond the portal we enter an open COURT, which was ori-.
ginally enclosed by brick walls. The facade of' the TEMPLE is adorned
with two fine columns with floral capitals, once connected with the
side-walls by stone srreens. The temple comprises a Vestibule and
two Smaller Chambers. The former is embellished with reliefs of
the emperor in presence of the gods, which in the Christian period,
when the hall was used as a church, were covered with stucco bear-
ing pictures of saints. The smaller rooms have no decoration. In
the rear wall of the innermost is a False Door, surmounted by ser-
pents, with representations of the local saints Pete- Tise and Pe-Hor
praying to Isis and Osiris. The N. and S fUterior W alts of the
temple are adorned with interesting reliefs. Un the N. wall, to the
left of the door from the vestibule, appears the emperor offering a
piece of cloth to Pe-Hor, on the S. wall, below, to the left of the
door, he sacrifices to Pete-gsm, who is accompanied by a woman,
probably his wife.

Among the various Inscriptions placed on the walls by visitors to the
temple is one in Coptic, in which a certain Preshyter Abraham records
