only, expandin by a fw i. ches at the outer extremities. The N.
shaft is 233 ft., and the S shaft 174 ft. lorry.,

We now retrace our steps and, on emerging from these awe
inspiring recesses, hail the light and air with no little satisfaction.

The other chambers as yet discovered in the interior of the Great
Pyramid are inaccessible. The first passage a b f', which is blocked at b,
leads downwards in a straight line, 293 ft. in length, and terminates in a
horizontal corridor, 27 ft. in length, 3ft. in height, and 2 ft. in width,
which leads to the tutf1nished subterranean chamber s, hewn in the rock.
The E. and W. sides of this chamber are each 46 ft. in length, the N.
and S. sides 27 ft., and the height 101/2 ft. It does not lie in a. line
with the diagonal of the Pyramid and its floor is 1011/2 ft. below the
level on which the Pyramid is built. The subterranean horizontal pass-
age t, (JO ft. long, ends in a cal-de-sae. The statement of Herodotus, that
the subterranean chamber planned by Kheops for the reception of his
body was surrounded by a canal conducted hither from the Nile, is er-
roneous, as the chamber lies above the highest level of the overflow of
the river, and it has, moreover, been ascertained that no channel from the
river ever led in this direction. - From the lower end of the Great Hall
a shaft, discovered by Davison in 1763, descends to the lower passage.
The enterprising Caviglia (p. 126) found that it terminated in the passage (1')
leading to the subterranean chamber fs). To all appearance it was bored
through the masonry after the latter had been finished.

To the E. of the Pyramid stood the Temple for the worship of
the deceased (p. clxix), such as was erected in the case of every
pyramid. Nothing of this now exists, however, except some rem-
nants of the basaltic pavement. The neighbouring depressions known
as'mortar-pits' (marked m on the Plan at p. i23) are natural clefts
in the rock, some of which have been lined with slabs of stone .--
On the E. side lie also Three Small Pyramids intended for relatives
of the king. The middle one of these (l on the Map) is said by
Herodotus to have been the tomb of a daughter of Kheops. That to
the S., according to an inscription in the Museum of Cairo, likewise
belonged to a daughter of Kheops, named Henwetsen. - At the E.
base of the small pyramid to the S. lies a small Sanctuary of Isis
(o on the Map), the'mistress of the Pyramid', which was erected by
King Psusennes (2ist Dyn.). It is in a very ruinous condition,
nothing remaining except a few stumps of columns.

The Second Pyramid, called by the Egyptians Wer-Ache/Fe-
('Great is Khefr√©"), was erected by Elie/ri?, who was called Khephren
by the Greeks o. xcix). Owing to the greater height of the rocky
plateau on which it stands, it appears higher than its larger neigh-
bour. The perpendicular height of this Pyramid is now 4471/2 ft.
(originally 471 ft.), each side of the base measures 6901/2 ft. Cori-
ginally 7073/4 ft., and the height of each sloping side is 5631/2 ft.
(originally 5721 2ft.), while the sides rise at an angle of 52020',
The solid content of the masonry is now 2,156,960 cubic yds., equi-
valent to 4,883,000 tons in weight (originally 2,426,710 cub. yds.,
equivalent to 5,309,000 tons). As the rocky site rises towards the
W. and N., a considerable part ofit required to be removed in or-
der that a level surface might be obtained (see p. 137), while the
