To the E. is the ruiudus pyramid of Amenemhéi fl. (12th Dyu.), while
to the E. and S. are remains of several other pyramids. Still farther to
the S. rises a pyramid of peculiar form, sometimes called the Blunted
Pyt' amid or Pyramid of the Two Angles, the lower part rising at an angle
of 54° 4.1', while the sides of the apex form an angle of W' 59'. This pyr-
amid is 618%, ft. square and 319 ft. in height. The exterior coating is
in good preservation and gives a very good notion of the former super-
ficial appearance of the pyramids. The interior was explored as early :13
the year 1660 by an English traveller named Melton. In 1800 Le Brnn
found a small chamber in the interior. No clue to the name of the builder
has been discovered. To the S. is the pyramid of the queen.

To the E. of the Blnnted Pyramid and a few kilometres to the S. of
the N. Brick Pyramid. near the village of 3Iertshtyeh, which lies on the
edge of the desert to the N. ofDal1shiir, rises the S. Brick Pyramid. This,
which was originally covered with limestone slabs, was perhaps built by King
Amenemhet HI. (12th Dyno. To the N. of it, but enclosed by the former
