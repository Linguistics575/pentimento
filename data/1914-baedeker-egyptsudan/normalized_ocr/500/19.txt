PLAN. The intending visitor to Egypt may make an outline of
his tour at home with as great ease as for any of the countries of
Europe. A glimpse of the country may be obtained in 4 or 5 weeks
(exclusive of the journey out) as follows: 2 days may be devoted
to Alexandria and the journey thence to Cairo - travellers landing
at Port Sartd should take the first train to Cairo, as the town is
uninteresting - 10 days may be spent in Cairo and its neighbour-
hood (pp. 35 et seq.), i2 days snfiiee for the railway-journey to As-
suiin and back (or 20 days by a tourist-steamer), and 3 days may be
given to Assuén (p. 353), while a fewdays must be set aside for
resting. An excursion to the Faiplm (R. 14) or to the oasis of
Khérgeh (p. 379) takes 3-4 days. - An expedition to Upper Nubia
(from Asinriin to Wtuli Halfa and back) requires 7 days by tourist-
steamer (see p. 384); but if the quicker government steamer (p. 383)
is used and the railway from Wtadi Balfa, the excursion can be ex-
tended to lihartihn (p. 4'26) within almost the same period. A month
should be allowed for the steamer-trip from Jihartihn to Gondokoro
(Rejaf) and bark o. 434), and 4 days for the return from Khartttrn
to Suez vit Port Sudan (R. 33). -

SEASON. The best time for a tour in Egypt is between Nov. ist
and May ist, Jan. to March being the most crowded period. In
Alexandria stormy and rainy weather very often prevails from
December to March, but in the interior of Egypt, to the S. of
a line joining Damanhtlr, Tanta, and 11lanylra, the case is con-
siderably altered. Even in the Delta, however, marked falls in
temperature (sometimes to 43° Fahr.) occur between the end of
November and the end of March, and rain-storms, rendering the
roads almost impassable, are not infrequent. In Cairo December,
January, and sometimes February are distinctly chilly, which is the
more inconvenient as there are no adequate heating-arrangements
in the houses; but November and March are very fine, as also
usually are October, April, and May, especially for travellers who
do not object to a little heat. In Upper Egypt, from the beginning of
November till the middle or end of April, the prevalent weather is
that of a delicious spring or moderate summer. Those who intend to
winter in Egypt should spend November in Cairo, move on thence in
December, on the approach of cold weather, to Upper Egypt (Luxor,
Assuin), and return to Cairo in February. - In summer prices are
naturally much lower, but most of the larger hotels are closed.

EXPENSES. The cost of a tour in Egypt, and in oriental coun-
tries generally, is greater than that of a visit to most parts of Europe,
and the traveller should estimate his average daily expenditure at
