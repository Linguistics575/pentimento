do homage to the queen. Farther on (P1. h) the queen (effaced),
followed by her guardian-spirit, dedicates to Amon the spoils of
the expedition; the gattle feeding beneath the trees are especially
worthy of notice. At Pl. i gold and other precious metals are being
weighed in presence of the goddess Seshet, who records the results;
Horus presides at the scales, and behind him is the Nubian god
Tetun. Below we see the incense being measured, while Thout
notes down the results; close by are seven incense-trees in tubs,
imported from Punt. At Pl. k; Thutmosis m. offers incense to the
boat of Amon, which is borne by priests. At Pl.t is Hatshepsut
be ore Amon (a long inscription between them has been erased).
- On the N. Walt, at Pl. m, the queen (chiselled out) is seated
beneath a canopy, with her guardian-spirit behind her. In front
are her grandees, to whom she is speaking, and a long inscription.

At the left (S.) end of the Punt Colonnade is a SHRINE ov
HATHOR, goddess of the necropolis at Thebes (p. cl), which was
originally reached also from below by a flight of steps. The inner-
most chambers are preceded by two covered Colonnade: (now in
ruins). The first of these had sixteeu-sided columns and square
pillars with Hathor-capitals; the second, which lies at a slightly
higher level, had round Hathor columns (three of them in partial
preservation) and also sixteen-sided columns (six partly remaining).

There are still a few Walt Decorations in the second colonnade. On the
N. Wall (Pl. n): Thutmosis III. with an oar, in presence of a goddess;
to the right is a procession, consisting of three rows with two ships in
each and (below) soldiers with standards and axes (to the right two
soldiers dancing to castanets). - On the 8. Wall (P1. "much dilapidated):
Bacrifuria1 scene,'and a boat containing a Hathor-cow, with Queen Hat-
shepsut drinking from the udder. - On the W. Wall (to the right):
Thntmosis H. (replacing Hatshepsut), with an oar and a builder's square,
before Hathor (whose figure was defaced by Amenophis IV.); the king,
whose hand is licked by the Hathor-cow. These are repeated to the left.

We ascend two steps to the Shrine proper, which comprised three
roek-hewn chambers (Pl. A, B, C), each one step higher than its
predecessor and containing several recesses. The ceiling of RoomA,
which is decorated with stars on a blue ground, is supported by two
sixteen-sided columns. The reliefs, which those who haveleisure may
examine, show Hatshepsut (everywhere defaced) or Thutmosis 111.
before various deities .--Room E contains *Wall Beliefs of unusual
beauty. They represent Hatshepsut (chiselled out) presenting offer-
ings of all kinds to the Hathor-cow, which stands'iu a boat beneath
a canopy. The traces of a. second and smaller figure of the queen,
represented as imbibing milk from the udder of the cow, are still
visible. The little nude boy, holding a sistmm, in front of the queen,
is Ehi, son of Hathor. - Room C has' a roof of parabolic vaulting.
On each of the side-walls is an admirable relief of Hatshepsut drink-
ing, from the udder of the Hathor-cow, before which stands Amon
(on a smaller scale). Rear Wall: Hatshepsut between Hathor and
Amon, who holds the hieroglyph for'life' to her nose. Above the
