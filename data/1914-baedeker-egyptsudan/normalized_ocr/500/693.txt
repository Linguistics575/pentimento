the hing (30 ft. high), holding the scourge and the crook. The figures
in the N. row wear the double crown, those in the S. row the crown
of Upper Egypt. The artistic effect of these admirably executed
statues is very tine; the best is the fourth figure in the N. row, with its
intelligent expression and well-preserved characteristic nose. The
ceiling of the central aisle is adorned with flying vultures, those of
the side-aisles with stars. Some of the reliefs on the wall, still viv-
idly coloured, are of great historical value. 0n the N. half of the
ENTRANCE WALL (Pl. h) the king is shown grasping a band of en-
emies by the hair and smiting them with his club, in presence of R6-
llarakhte, guardian-deity of N. Egypt, who hands the curved sword
to Ramses. Above the king hovers a vulture and behind him is his
guardian-spirit or Ka. leneath are the king's daughters, with
sistra. The S. half of this wall (P1. i) is occupied by a correspond-
ing scene, in presence of Anion -Ré, guardian- deity of S. Egypt.
Jeneath are the king's sons.

a herdsman flees with his herd [ towards the town. 2. The king
pierces a prostrate Libyan with a lance. 3. The triumphal return
of the king from battle with the captured negroes.

The NORTH WALL (right; Pl. l) represents scenes from the king's
campaign against the Hittites, with which we have already become
acquainted ] in the Ramesseum (p. 306) and at Luxqr (p. 258) and
Abydos (p. 243). -1._. In the Lower Half of the representation we see
first (loft) the march of the Egyptian army, which consists of in-
fantry and charioteers; then (between the doors to Rooms I? and co,
the Egyptian camp, with the shields of the soldiers arranged round
it in a kind of stockade. The bustle of the camp is represented with
great vivacity: the ur1harmsssed horses receiving their fodder, the
resting soldiers, the camp-followers, etc. To the right is the royal
tent. The third picture shows the king on his throne, holding a
council of war with his officers. Below information is extorted
