columns of the foreeourt and the main hall project from the rubbish-
heaps. The vestiges of public buildings are now exceedingly scanty,
though the French Expedition saw a triumphal arch, a theatre, and
streets flanked with columns. Granite columns and capitals lie
scattered about. Near the ruins of a large building on the road
running to the E. from the mosque lies a broken marble basin,
which must have had a diameter of about ti) ft. The Roman and
Christian cemeteries have recently been much injured.

To the S. of Sheikh rAtrideh we reach Deir Abu Hennes Ton-
vent of St. John), called also simply Ed-Deir, a village on the E.
bank inhabited by about 2000 Oopts. Near it is a ruined town of
the Christian epoch, known as E2-hfedtnelv. On the N. side of a
ravine in the hill behind the village are many ancient trave-like
quarries, which were titted up at an early date as Christian chapels
or anehorites' dwellings. The largest Chapel, in which divine service
is held, may be reached from the village in 1 hr.; it is said to date
from the time of the Empress Helena and contains paintings of saints
and scenes from the New Testament, but those in the neighbouring
Chapel (Raising of Lazarus, Marriage at Cana, etc.) are better. -
Deir el-Bersheh (see below) is within 1/2 hr. of Deir Abu Hennes.

Immediately beyond Roda the mountains on the E. bank reeede
farther from the river. During the sugar-cane harvest, in the begin-
ning of February, this region presents a busy scene.

1811/2 M. Mellawi (Mallawi; modest Inn at the station, R.
S pias.), a distriet-eapital on the W. bank of the Ibrthirntyeh Canal,
with 20,250 i11hab., has a frequented market on Sundays.. In the
vicinity are many palms. To the left We have a view of the E. range
of hills, in which are the tombs of El-Bersheh (see below) and
Sheikh Sand (p. 231). A shady route, skirting a canal, leads hence
in about 11/2 hr. to Ashmunein and the ruins of Hermopolis (p.209).

Opposite Mellawi, on the E. bank, a little way from the river,
lies the Coptic village of Deir eI-Bersheh. Beside a Coptic cemetery
to the E. begins a desert-ravine, running N.W. and S.E., and named
Wddi en-Nakhleh or dei el-Bershch, in the steep sides of which are
numerous quarries and ancient tombs. The valley is chiefly noted
for the roelc-tombs in its N. slope, eonstrtleted.under the Middle
Empire by the princes of the'hare-nome' (p. 209), which included
this region. The only one that need be visited is -

TOMB 2, belonging to THUTI-HDTEP, son of Kai, prince of the
Home in the reigns of Amenemh√©t II. and Sesostris II. and III.
This tomb is constructed in the same way as the tombs at Benihasan.
The Vestibule, originally supported by two palm-columns, has fallen
in. A door leads hence to the Inner Chamber, the walls of which
were embellished with reliefs, now partly destroyed. On the Left
Wall is a scene representing the transportation of a colossal statue
of the deceased from the quarries of Het-nub (p. 218) to a temple.
The inscription informs us that the statue was of alabaster and
