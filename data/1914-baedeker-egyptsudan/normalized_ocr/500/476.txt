Greeks named it Antaeopolis, after Antaeus whom they identified
with the deity worshipped here (neeropolis, see p. 235).

According to the myth, Anteeus was a Libyan king ofimmense strength,
who was in the habit of wrestling with all visitors to his dominions and
of slaying those whom he vanquished, in order to build a temple to his
father Poseidon with their skulls. Hercules came to try conclusions with
him and, after overthrowing him in a wrestling-match, slew him .--Ac-
cording to DiodOrus the final struggle betwixt Horus and Typhon (Seth) took
place here (comp. p. 343). In the Roman period Antmopolis was the capital of
the Antwopolitan nome. The last remains of an imposing temple, dedicated
here by Ptolemy Philometor to Antenna and restored by Marcus Aurelius
and his colleague Verus (164 A.DO, were swept away by the Nile in 1821. -
