solstice, thus proving that Syene was situated under the tropic (which,
however, has now shifted somewhat to the S.). The report of its existence
led the learned Athenian Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.), attached to the Museum
at Alexandria (p. 13), to the discovery of the method of measuring, the size
of the earth that is still employed. - The place suffered greatly at the
hands of the L'lennuyes lp. 364), but became the seat of a Christian bishop,
and appears to have rapidly regained. its prosperity under the Caliphs.
Arab authors record that no fewer than 20,000 inhabitants died of the plague
at one time, a fact that points to a very large total population. After the
close of the 12th cent. Assuiin suffered severely from the incursions of plun-
dering Arab tribes, finally put a stop to by a Turkish garrison stationed
here toy the sultan Selim, after the conquest of Egypt in 1517.

The landing-place of the steamers lies on the river opposite the
railway station. Thence the attractive Shari" el-Buhr, or riverside-
street, skirts the Nile to the N., passing the principal public build-
ings, the Summary Tribunal, the German Stuitin Pioneer Mission,
the (hani1-II6tel Assouan [ beside a rock with inscriptions), and
the Mttdirtyoh or Government Buildings. Opposite the last a ruined
building, for which stones of earlier buildings have been used,
projects into the river. This, known to the Arabs as El-Hammc'un
(the bath) and as the Bath of Cleopatra, probably dates from the
Roman period and seems to have been a lock or a téte-de-pont.
Farther on rises the lofty minaret of the chief mosque, beside which
the Shirir el-Mehkemeh diverges on the right for the bazaars; then,
as we descend the river, we pass the Police Office (Markus), the
National Bank, the St. James Hotel, the Post Office, the (Jovern-.
ment Hospital, and the Roman Catholic Church, with the school of
the Catholic S1" 1dtr1 Mission. Across the river appears the hill with
the rock-tombs and the Kubbet el-Hawe (p. 360). In the highly
picturesque inner town are the large COPtic church and the Captic
school. - To the S. of the railway station the road leads to a hill,
110w laid out as a public garden (view), with the ruins of the so-
called Kaer el-Mula (probably a convent) and a sheikh's tomb. Oppo-
site, on the E. side of the road, stands the English Church, built in
"1899-1900 from a design by Mr. Somers Clarke in the style of a
Ceptie church, with a dome. The font is a gift of Queen Victoria.
Farther on the road reaches the Cataract Hotel.

Among the ruins of the ancient city to the E. of the station lies
a small PTOLEMAIC TEMPLE (open to holders of the general admission
ticket, p. 200). Built by Euergetes I. and Philopator but never com-
pleted, the temple was dedicated to Isis of Syeue.,

The MAIN PORTAL is crowned with a concave cornice. Left Jamb: above,

to the right, the king before Thout; to the left, the king before Harsiésis;
above is an inscription. - The INTERIOR consists of a hall with two pil-
lars, in which stand the bases of several statues and sacred boats, and of
three chapels, the middle one of which has on its rear wall reliefs show-
ing Euergetes (once accompanied by Berenice) before the deities of Syene.

To the E. of the Cataract Hotel, on a granite rock below a stone wall
of the Roman period, is an inscription of the reign ofAmenophis IV. t to the
