muezzins fmu'eddio) from the minarets of the mosques: (1) Maghr'ib, a
little after Sunset; (2)'lsheh, nightfall, about 11,2 hour after sunset; (3) Stable
daybreak; (d) {) uhr, midday; (5)'A.sr, afternoon, about 3 hours after mid-
day. On Fridays the midday recital of prayer takes place three quarters
of an hour earlier than usual and is followed by a sermon. Friday, how-

resteth, and who go not astray. Amen'. After praying the Moslem looks
