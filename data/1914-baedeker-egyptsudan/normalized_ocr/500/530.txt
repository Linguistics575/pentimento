270 Route :20. THEBES J. BANK). 2. Karnak:

The walls of the hall, the shafts of the columns, the ahaci, and
the architrave are covered with inscriptions and reliefs, many of
which still retain their ancient colouring. These date from the
reigns of Sethos I. and Ramses II., the former of whom built
the N. half of the hall (as far as the 10th row of columns), the
latter the S. half. Only a single column (the first in the 6th row)
bears the names of Ramses I. Ramses m., Ramses IV., Ram-.
ses YI., and Ramses XII. have likewise recorded their names. The
scenes on the columns show the king adoring the gods of Thebes.
Those by Sethos I. are in delicate low relief, those by Ramses II.
in ruder sunk relief. Among the beautiful Beliefs of Sethos I.
(Plan a, b, e) the finest is that on the E. half of the N. wall
(PI. "We here see the king kneeling before the god Harakhte,
who is seated beneath a Panopy, while behind the king stands the
lion-headed goddess Wert-hekew holding a palm-branch, from
which hang various symbols. To the left the king kneels beneath
the sacred tree of Heliopolis, on whose leaves the god Thout is in-
scribing his majesty's name. Among the Beliefs ofRamses II. those
to the right and left of the S. side-door are worth noticing. To the
right Ramses II. is represented burning incense in front of the sacred
bark of Amou, which is carried by priests in the shape ofsemi-gods
with faleons' and jac'kals' heads and accompanied by the king as
high-priest clad in a panther-skin; to the left, the coronation of
the king beneath the sacred tree of Heliopolis. - In the S. aisle is
a tine sandstone statue of Sethos 11. (headless).

On the outside of the N. and S. walls of this hall are'Historical
Beliefs of great importance, commemorating the victories of Sethos I.
(N.) and Ramses 11. (S.) over the inhabitants of Palestine and the
Libyans..

We pass through the N.E. door, beside Pl. d, and begin with
the reliefs at the E. end of the NORTH WALL (PLd): Upper Row. Here
we see King Sethos in Lebanon. The inhabitants, whose physi-
ognomies are distinctly characterized, are forced to fell trees for the
king. Lower Row. Battle with the Beduins of S. Palestine. Sethos
is driving in his chariot and launching his arrows against the foes,
who lie in confused heaps of dead and wounded. Above, to the
left, is the fortress of Canaan, whose inhabitants are beseeching
mercy or assisting the fugitives to ascend into it.

We now turn the corner and reach Plan e: Upper Row (partly
destroyed; described from left to right). 1. Battle of Yenuam in
Syria. The king, advancing to the attack in his chariot, shoots arrows
against the enemy, whose charioteers, cavalry, and infantry tlee in
wild confusion. To the left is the fortress of Yenuam, surrounded
with water. The inhabitants of the country, many of whom age re-
presented full face (contrary to the usual Egyptian method), conceal
themselves among trees. 2. The king binding captive Syrians with
his own hand. 3. The king, marching behind his chariot, appears
