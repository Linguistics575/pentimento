122 Route J. BARRAGE DU NIL.

The object of the *Barrage du Nil, the largest structure of
the kind in the world after the Assutn Dam (p. 371), is to keep
the water-level in the Delta uniform in all seasons, so as to ob-
viate the necessity for the old irrigation machinery, with its great
expenditure of labour, and to remove the diffleulties of naviga-
tion during the three months when the Nile is at its lowest.
The work was begun under Mohammed Ali, about 1835. Lincmt
Bey proposed to alter the course of the river and to build a weir
farther to the N., where the configuration of the ground appeared
more favourable; but his plan was judged too costly and Was rej ect-
ed in favour of one proposed by a French engineer named Mougel
Bey. The cost of establishing foundations in the shifting soil of
the Delta, however, far exceeded the estimates; and, after all, the
erection was found to be too insecure for its intended purpose. For
nearly twenty years after 1867 the Barrage lay useless, as a costly
failure; but in 1885-90 Sir Colin Steott-Monerieff sueeessfully com-
pleted it at a cost of 460,000l., so that now a depth of water of
about 12 ft. can be maintained in the W. branch of the Nile. In
consequence of a burst in the winter oci909-i0 considerable streng-
thening works became necessary, which are not yet quite finished.

Nearest the station are the Weirs on the Rayt) et-Taufilct and
on the E. (Damietta) Branch of the Nile. The latter weir is over
500 yds. in length and has 68 vertical iron sluices. From the
farther end a pretty avenue of lebbakh- trees leads across the
isthmus (about 1/2 M. wide) between the arms, in the middle of
which is the Raydl/ el-j1len0 (tyeh, constructed both for irrigation and
for communication with the district of Mmiyf'tyeh (p. 33). The Weir
on the W. (Rosetta) Branch of the Nile is about 480 yds. across and
has 58 vertical iron sluioes. Farther to the W. is a fourth Weir, on
the Malimiidtyeh Canal, constructed a few years ago. The navigation
of the river is carried 011 by means of spacious basins and looks,
titted with swing-bridges, at either end of the two weirs and also 011
the Itayili el-Mtsnt1fiyel1. The s11perstruetures of the works are built
in an effective Norman castellated style. A junction-canal above the
weirs connects the two branches of the Nile, and is used to regulate
the depth of water in each. When the river is low the W. branch
receives all its water through this canal.

The island, formerly occupied by fortifieations, is now covered
with attractive and extensive'Gardens, laid out with flower-beds,
artificial rocks, etc., by Mr. Draper, an Englishman. - In the gar-
den is a Museum, with models of the various water-works of Egypt.

If not pressed for time the traveller should visit the little Arab
village of Shala.ktrn which stretches along the river near the Barrage
station. A charming and picturesque impression of Egyptian coun-
try-life is obtained here on market-days.
