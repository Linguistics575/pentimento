oxxxii V. HIEROGLYPHICS.

Upper and Lower Egypt, and frequently also by i?,: ?:?, :.?::','; nab is my,

'lord of both lands' o. xcix), or SCCT7' ffi mb haw,'lord of the
E)

diadems'. The title s' R' (se'RE'),'son of the sun', is an ad-

dition to the individual or birth name. Thutmosis m., for ex-
ample, a king of the 18th Dyn., was named -

il, kiii (y (ii.ltiiilii) -iisiie, m

The former is his offieial name, assumed at his accession to the
throne, the latter his individual name. C) is the origi nal word-sign
(.No. 1) r','sun, sun-god RIS'; eee is the syllabic sign (No.1) mn,

here, however, standing for'to remain'; is the transferred word-

sign (N0. 22) szr,'to become, to he'. The first name therefore is
R'-mn-hpr or, rather, as the words signifying god or king are written
lirst out of reverence merely, mn-tpr-R','remains the being of RE
(vocalized Men- -lyper- RE, or, according to the system described

below, Metvvteper-Rif). In the second cartouche E is the
o hh

original word-sign (No. 10) Thwty,'the ibis-god Thout'; a and
\\ are the letters t and y, indicating the final syllable of Trusty;

m is the syllahic sign (No. 5) nd; and n the letter J, added to show

the sound of mf. The whole is thus waty-ms' (Le.'the god Thout
has created'), corresponding to the Greek Thutmosis, and probably
to be vocalized Thut-most,

It may here be remarked that the Egyptian names occurring in
the Handbook are usually written in the traditional Greek form
and not in the native Egyptian; e.g. Sethos instead of Sthy, Kheops
(Cheaps) instead of Wfho (Khwfiv or Khufu). For names, however,
of which the Egyptian forms are more familiar, or of which there
are no known Greek transliterations, the Egyptian forms have been
retained, with vowels inserted on the principles explained above.
In these cases, however, the diacritical signs are omitted, so that no
difference is made between t and .t, s and g, k and la, h and li; w is
sometimes represented by u; y by i; Li and It by kh; s' by s; and in
certain cases y is altogether omitted. The apostrophes, and t are
uniformly omitted. In short, the general rules adopted by the
Greeks for the transliteration of Egyptian words are followed.
