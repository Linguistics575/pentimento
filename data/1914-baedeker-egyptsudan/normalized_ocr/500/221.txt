In tlu. ltm-z DU MUsrfa, which diverges to the N. from the line de,
la Porte de Rosette (p. 20), rises an edifice in the Greek style,
accommodating the--

*Museum of Greeco-Roman Antiquities (Pl. H, 3, 4), founded
by Dr. Cr. Botti (d. 1003), an Italian, with the coiiperation of the
Athenteum Society and the municipal authorities. The museum
soon attaiuml considerable importance. Most of the contents are of
Alexandrian origin, but sorne were transferred hither from the Cairo
Museum. The objects found in Alexandria were generally brought
to light either in digging for olil stones for: building houses (a com-
mon practice here) or in the course of excavations. Most of them
come from the extensive catacombs constructed on the outskirts of
the ancient city. The importance of the cdlleetion lies in the histori-
cal sigm'fteane, e ofthosc intrinsically somewhat unimpressive remains.
