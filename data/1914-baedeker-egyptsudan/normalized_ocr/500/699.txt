SEMNEH, 31. Route. 41?

Series of rapids, over rocks of greywacke, greenstone, and granite,
forming numerous rocky islands in its course. The best point of
view is the abrupt rocky hill of Abugir, on the W. bank. At the
foot of the hill, contrasting strongly with the green of the tamarisk-
trees, lies a chaos of glistening black boulders, through which the
river forces its way in foaming cataracts, especially fine at the time
of the inundation. In the distance to the N. are the white houses
and slender minaret of MGdi Halfa on the E. bank, and the great
sycamore and the pylon of the S. temple of Buhen (p.412) on the W.
bank; to the W., beyond the broad river, rise the mountains of the
desert; to the S. lie the rocky islets among the rapids. Numerous
modern travellers (including Champollion, p. cxxvi) have left in-
scriptions on the rock of Abusir.

From Wadi lialfa. to Semneh.

371/2 M. - A visit to the naturally beautiful and historically interest-
ing N. part of the Bagn el- { Iagar (p. 412) requires t 0r 5 days at least.
Camels may be hired at Halfa for about 17 pies. each per day, including

By the W.bank to the rocky hill of Abu.str, see p.412 and above.
Thence the route leads through the desert to (1 hr.) the village of
Matiiga, on the river. In another hour we reach Mirgisseh, a fortress
of the Middle Empire, situated on a steep rock close to the Nile.
Within the girdle-wall, which is built partly of sun-dried bricks and
partly of rubble, are the scanty ruins of a small temple erected by
Sesostris m. On the island of Dabeh, nearly opposite, are some
ancient Egyptian fortifications. - The route leads round the steep
rocks lying to the S. of Mirgisseh and returns to the river-bank
through a picturesque defile. On the opposite (E.) bank lies'Alikeli.
In 11/2 hr. we reach the straggling commune of Gemmei, with some
ruined Christian domed tombs, several of which contain remains
of frescoes and inscriptions.

The second day's march leads through the desert for the first
six hours. We regain the river opposite Sarms. Numerous rocky
islets interrupt the stream; on one of these, to the S., are the ruins
of an Arab castle, perched upon a rock. Alternately skirting the
river and traversing the desert for another hour, we next reach Shal-
fak, with a well-preserved fortress of the Middle Empire.

The third day's route also leads through the desert, from the
heights in which we have occasional glimpses of the river-valley.
In 2 hrs. we find ourselves opposite the rocky island of Uronarti
(Arab. Gesiret el-Melek, i.e.'king's island'), on the N. end of which
are the ruins of a fortress of the Middle Empire and of a chapel built
by Thutmoeie III. On the W. side of the island are considerable
rapids. In 2 hrs. more we reach Semneh, which marked the S. limit
ofEgypt under the Middle Empire. On the top of the hill are massive
fortifications, with well-preserved girdle-walls. Within the latter is
