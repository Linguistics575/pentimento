26. The Western Cases.

By the term OASIS (Egypt. wet, Arab. el-mmih) is generally
understood a fertile and inhabited spot in the midst of the desert.
More correctly. however, the oases are large depressions in the de-
sert-plateau, of which a comparatively very small area is really fer-
tile, by far the larger portion being desert. The fertility of the oases
depends upon the existence of a water-supply lying in a stratum of
sandstone, from 300 to 550 ft. below the surface, and rendered avail-
able either by natural springs .01' by deep artesian wells. Fertile
land, therefore, is usually found in the lowest parts of an oasis.

The five Egyptian oases, situated in the Libyan Desert (comp.
p. lxx), have an aggregate population of 38,000. Kluirgch is connected
with the Nile valley by railway, and is therefore easily visited; the
others (Shoeh, Bahr? yeh, Farhfra, and lhikhleh.) are reached by eamel-
caravans (romp. p. XXVI).

Siweh.

The OASIS Oh' Stwrim (Shea), theAmmonium or seat of the oracle
of Jupiter Ammon, is the most westerly of the oases and lies i5-20
days' journey from the Nile valley. The best starting-points for a visit
to this spot are Cairo and Alexandria, where also the caravan can
he organized. The route from Cairo leads vit Aim Ro0sh (p. 130) to
the Convent of St. Macarius (Deir Abe Math, p. 32) in the quli
Nat.rtsn, and thence to the W. to the uninhabited depression of
Mayhem, 7-8 days from Cairo. Jn 7 days more, proceeding via Ilfr
(? hartdil.c and dei Letheiteh, we reach the small oasis of Grfra,
or Umm es-Sughaz'r (Le.'the white mother"). The little village, which
has about fnurseore inhabitants, occupies a low limestone rock.
Thence 3 days" march brings us to Siweh. - From Alexandria we
may follow the caravan-ronte to the S.W. via the City of St. Menus
(p. 28) to join the Cairo route at Meghan; (see above). Or we may
send the camels 011 to Ed- Daba' (p. 2f0, join them there by means
of the Maryiit. railway (p. 27), and go on to the seaport of Mirsa
Matrah o, 29) in two days. Thence the earavan-route, known as the
Sikket es-r% ltttn ('sultan roar) or Sikket Istabl ('stable road'), the
route followed by Alexander the Great (p.29), leads to Siweh'in
7 days, vii the Wridi Raml and Bir Goai/'eri and thence through the
Pass of Kanais and past several wells to the Ilts el-Hamrayeh.

The Oasis of Siwch lies about 78 ft. below the level of the sea,
in N. lat.'2fPi2' and E. long. 25030'. After the visit of Pansanias,
the Greek traveller, in 160 A.D., the first European to penetrate to
this oasis was Browne (p. 12f0 in 1792, who may thus rank as the
rediscoverer of the Ammonium. The inhabitants (3884 in number)
are chiefly Berbers and, like the Berbers of North Africa, have a
language of their own, though the men speak and understand Arabic
aiso. Besides a number of smaller settlements there are two large
