shepherd's pipe. The name Occurs also in the Greek inscriptions within
the tombs.

There are two routes from the Temple of Sethos at Kurna (p.282)
to Bib√©n el-Multk (a donkey-ride of 3/4 hr.). The lower of these is
described below. The mountain-track vii El-Asasif and Deir
el-Bahri is better followed on the return (comp. p. 200).

The well-kept lower route leaves the necropolis of Drah Abu'l
Negga (p.283) to the left, and winds, first to the N.W., then to the
W., up the southernmost of two desert-valleys known as the Wddiyein
('the two valleys'). The gorge gradually contracts, between walls of
naked yellowish rock on which the midday sun pours its perptsndie-
ular rays, and a gloomy solitude broods over the scene, which is of
a suhlimity unmatched elsewhere in the Nile valley. Signs of life
are rare; at desert-plant waves here and there; jackals, wolves, eagles,
falcons, owls, bats, snakes, flies, and wasps are practically the only
inhabitants of the gorge.

After riding for about 3/4 hr. through the valley we reach
a place where the road divides. The right branch leads to the
seldomer visited W. Tombs of the Kings (p. 298). The left branch
leads to the -

Bihhn el-Muluk proper. We dismount at a wooden barrier near
Tombs 6 and 7.

The most important tombs (Nos. 6, S, 9, 11, 16, 17, tr, 35) are lighted
up by electricity daily (9-1) from Nov. 15th to March 15th. After the visit
to Tomb 11 we should proceed to Tomb 35. Ilurried or fatigued travellers
may content themselves with the tombs of Ramses VI. O), Amouephthes (8),
Amenophis II. (35), and Sethos I. (17). The other accessible tombs (un-
lighted) are Nos. I-d, lk, 15, 19, 34, dr, 47, but they are of interest only
to specialists. Any other tombs than these may be visited only by ex-
press permission from the general inspector at Luxor. We describe the
tombs in numerical order.

The tombs occur both in the main valley and in its branches and
are made accessible by easy paths, which, unfortunately, somewhat
impair the imposing impression of solitude made by the valley. -
On the right Cw.) side of the path: -

No. f. Tomb ofRamsery., Yet-Aman. AGreek inscription proves
that it was known and accessible in Greek times.

N. 2. Tomb of Ramses IV. An ancient staircase, with an in-
clined plane in the centre, leads to the entrance. Above the door
are Isis and Nephthys worshipping the solar disk, in which stand
the ram-headed sun-god and a searabasus. On the right wall, behind
the door, are two Copts raising their hands in prayer; an inscription
indicates one of these as'Apa Ammonios, the martyr'.

To the left, in CORRIDOR I (comp. the Plan, p. 280), appears the
king worshipping the falcon-headed sun-god Harakhte. The other walls
of this and the following 0011111001: Il are adorned with texts and iieurres
of the sun-god from the'Praiaing of RE' (p. 281). CORRIDOR III shows
texts and pictures of gods and spirits from the'Sun'g Journey in the
Underworld' (p. 284). - Ammoon IV has texts from the Book of the

Dead (p. 284), the chief being the 125th chapter, which c0ntains the justi-
fication of the deceased.
