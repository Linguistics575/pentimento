VIII. Buildings of the Mohammedans.
By Franz-Pasha.

The Mohammedan style of architecture in the valley ofthe Nile
was founded upon the forms of art which the victorious Arabs
found in vogue among the Byzantines and the Cepts, and upon those
of Persian art of the era of the Sassanides. The buildings in Egypt
exhibit a considerable variety coupled with a certain finish ofstyle,
but none of them dates back to the first period ofthe Arabic dominion;
for the professors of the new religion were for centuries content
merely to adapt the religious editlees of the conquered countries as
mosques. This was a process of little diffieulty, for the ceremonial
requirements of the new religion were comparatively simple, and
it took place in all parts of the great empire of the Galip'hs. From
casual references by the Arabian 1yhroniclers we learn that the
earliest prayer-houses built by the Arabs were merely enclosed courts,
along the walls of which ran covered passages, supported by palm
trunks, in order to shelter the worshippers from sun and rain.
Even the large mosque built by the Khalifa'Abdallil1 in Omdurman
(p. 430) is of this type. Costly mosques, with marble arcades, be-
gan to appear very gradually, under the iutluiynee of the ancient
editiees and of the increasing wealth flowing from the military
successes of the Mohammedans. Columns from Greek and Roman
temples and even, in some cases, from iyarly-Egyptian buildings,
were freely employed in these later mosques. This employment of
ancient columns in the mosques, frequently without any regard to
harmony of style or size, brings it about that uniformity in the
architecture of the arcades is observed only when the abacus is
reached. No distinct Arabian order of columns was thus ever de-
veloped in Egypt. A few Arabian forms of capital (one a curious
form of ealyx-capita ], another including a wreath of stalaetites as
the transition between the shaft and the abacus) are the only evi-
dence of any effort towards originality in this direction.

The most prominent characteristic peculiarities of Arabian arehi-
tecture are the following: -

1. The use of the pointed arch (Mosque of Ibn rfulfill, p. 71) and
the Byzantine stilted round arch, as well as of the round and pointed
horseshoe arch, the scalloped arch, the clover-leaf arch, and the
'keel' arch. These [ except the scalloped and clover-leaf arches)
were accompanied by corresponding forms of domes.

2. The development of the form of tower known as the minaret.

3. The refining of various forms of pinnacles that occur also in
early Egypt, Assyria, Phaauieia, and Persia.

d. The employment in facades of two colours, by alternate
courses of red and white limestone or (in later examples) of black
and white marble.

D. The invention of the elegant wooden balconies and the
