280 Route 20. THEBES Oil. BANK). 2. Karnak.

Between Pylons IX and X lies a square court, surrounded by a
wall, which is interrupted on the 1eft (E.) side by the ruins of a
small TEMPLE OF AMENOPHIS Il.

In front of the temple is a Gallery, borne by It square pillars embel-
lished with reliefs. Thence a granite portal admits us to a large Hall, the
roof of which rested on 16 square pillars with concave cornices at the top.
On the four sides of each pillar appears Amenophis 11. before some deity.
This hall is flanked by smaller chambers, two of which have pillars
like those of the main hall. Most of the sculptures on the walls and
pillars are executed in fine low relief, only a few being in sunk relief.
Much of the colouring is in good preservation.

On the E. Wall of the court are several important reliefs of
Haremheb. At Pl. d the king conducts to the Theban triad captives
with costly gifts from the incense-yielding land of Punt, while at
Pl. e he appears with fettered Syrian captives.

On the outside of the wall, behind Pl. e, is a procession of priests
carrying the sacred boats. Beside it is an inscription of the time of the
high-priest Pinotem 11., recording the appointment of a priest in deference
to an oracle of Amen.

The reliefs on the W. Wall of the court, Which also date from
liaremheb, are in poor preservation.

Pylon x, which formed the S. entrance to the precincts of the
great temple of Amen from the end of the 18th Dynasty onwards,
was likewise built by Haremheh, who used the stones of a temple
raised by Amenophis IV. in Karnak to his new deity (p. 211). The
reliefs on the central granite doorway exhibit Haremheh saerifieing
and performing other religious rites. - In front of the N. side of the
pylon stand two headless statues of Ramses II., of fine-grained lime-.
stone (that to the W. adjoined by a figure of his wife). Here is
also a large stele with a, manifesto of Haremheb, intended to restore
order to the distracted state. In front of the S. side of the pylon
are the remains of colossal statues of Amenophis III. (E.) and
Haremheb (W.) and the lower part of a colossus of Osiris.

From Pylon X the EastAvenue ofSphinxes, erected by Haremheb,
leads to a Gate in the girdle-wall of the South Temple Precincts,
built by Ptolemy II. Philadelphus and embellished with reliefs and
long inscriptions. On the E. side of' this road is a Chapel of Osiris-
Ptah (closed), with well-preserved painted reliefs; the chapel was
built by the Ethiopian Kings Tanutamun and Taharka (25th Dyn.).
From the gate we proceed amidst figures of recumbent rams,
sphiuxes, and fragments of statues to the--.

TEMPLE Ol? MUT, built by Amenophis III.

A Gateway (P1. A) admits us to a large Court, in the middle of which
was a colonnade. Outside the gateway are pillars with figures of the god
Bes. On the gateway are lengthy inscriptions of the Ptolemaic period
(hymns to Nut) and an inscription of Ramses m., who restored the temple.
The court contains numerous seated figures of the lion-headed goddess
Sekhmet, dedicated by AmenOphis III. On several of these Shosheuk I.
has placed his own name in place of that of AmenOphis. - Farther on
is a second Colonnaded Court, with statues of Sekhmet and a black granite
figure of Amenophis III .--The inner rooms, which are likewise adjoined
by statues of Sekhmet, are in a very ruinous condition.
