xxii l. PRELIMINARY INFORMATION. 7. malt/tResorts.

Mena House Hotel o. 36), 8 M. to the W. of Cairo, stands near
the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, 011 the verge of the Libyan Desert.
The mean maximum temperature is (AP Fahr. in Dec., iifP in Jan.,
'P20 in Feb., Tio in March, and 800 in April. The mean minimum
for the four months Dec. to March is 50°. The daily range of tem-
perature is 21°. The relative humidity (Lee. the amount of moisture,
in relation to the temperature at the time, that the air holds out of
a possible 100 per cent) from Dec. to March is 58 per cent by day
(8 a.m. to 6 pan.) and 80 per cent at night (8 Fm. to 6 a.m.).
Dew falls in winter on about two nights out of three. At both Mena
House and Helwan the prevailing winds and the amount of rain are
probably much the same as in Cairo. The purity of the air at both
places is marked; the medical and sanitary arrangements are ex-
vellent .--The Oasis of New ITeliopolis (p. 119), founded as a health-
resort a few years ago, possesses similar advantages.

Helwén (p. 167), 17 M. to the S. of Cairo and 3 M. from the
cultivated land, is 115 ft. above the river. The mean maximum
temperature is 700 in Dec., 670 in Jan., 730 in Feb., and'7 (P in
March. The mean minimum for these four months is 50°. The daily
range of temperature is here also 21°. The relative humidity from
Dec. to March is 47 per cent by day, 66 per cent at night. .._ Uelwim
has the advantage of being in the desert in a pure atmosphere.
It also has warrng') hurated and saline springs, richer in natural
constituents than g corresponding springs at Aix-les-Bains, Harro-
gate, Buxton, L. The cases suitable for the baths here are such
as would derive -1 "tfit from hydro-therapeutic treatment as carried
on at Harrogate, Aria, Aix, ete.; of late years Helw'au has been
especially recommended to sufferers from kidney- diseases, and
suitable diet is provided at all the hotels and pensions.

Luxor (p. 251) is situated about 400 M. to the S. of Cairo, in
the Thehan plain on the right bank of the river. The prevailing
winds are N.W. and N., as in the whole country. The mean maxi-
mum temperature is 760 in Dee., "Mo in Jan., 78° in Feb., and 85"
in March. The mean minimum for these four months is 50°. The
relative humidity is 41 per cent by-day, 64 per cent at night. - In
addition to the advantage of its warm and dry climate Luxor has an
almost inexhaustible interest in its numerous antiquities, temples,
and tombs. - The temperature is'i-Y warmer than at Mena House
and Helwan. The importance of the extra warmth of Upper Egypt
must not be lost sight of, in cases where it is imperative that the
action of the skin should be at its highest level - especially as with
this warmth a bracing effect is obtained from the dryness of the air.

Assudn (p. 353), situated at the First Cataract, also on the right
bank of the river, is the dryest of the Egyptian health-resorts and
may be specially recommended in winter, when N. Egypt is often
decidedly chilly. The prevailing winds are, as at Luxor, N.W. and
N. in winter. The mean maximum temperature is 780 in Dee., "MW'
