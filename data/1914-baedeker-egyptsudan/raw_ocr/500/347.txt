theatPyramid. PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH. 6. Route. 129

and colourless monuments erected here by the hand of man remind
the spectator, like the desert itself, of death and eternity. On
a bare plateau of rock stand the other pyramids, while the Sphinx
reposes majestically on the sand. The arrangement of the extensive
burial-ground with its various streets of tombs is plainly seen.
To the S., in the distance, rise the pyramids of Abusir, Salrlptra,
and Dahshtr. To the N. are the palm-groves of Eerdiseh and
the fields of the valley of the Nile. Towards the E., on the other
hand, glitters the river, on each bank of which stretches a tract of
rich arable land, Iuxuriantly clothed with blue-green vegetation
and varying in breadth. The fields are intersected in every direction
by canals, on the banks of which stately palms wave their f16xible
fan-like leaves. In the direction of Cairo runs the long straight
carriage-road. Immediately before us rises the Citadel with its
striking minarets, while the Mohattam hills, Which form the chief
mass of colour in the landscape, gleam in the morning with a pale
golden tint and in the evening with a violet hue.

The descent of the Great Pyramid is hardly less fatiguing than
the ascent. Persons liable to giddiness may find it a little trying,
but the help of the Beduins removes all danger.

INTERIOR (comp. Plan, p. 127). A visit to the interior of the
Great Pyramid is comparatively uninteresting to the ordinary tourist.
It will be found fatiguing, and an interval of rest between the ascent
and this expedition is recommended. Travellers who are in the
slightest degree predisposed to apopleetiis or fainting.fits and ladies
travelling alone should not attempt to penetrate into these stifling
recesses. The explorer has to crawl and clamber through low and
narrow passages, which, at plates, especially near the entrance, are
not above 31/2 ft. high and 4 ft. wide. The floor is often very slippery,
and the close air smells strongly of bats. The temperature of the
interior is nearly 79o Fahr. The attempts of the guides to good the
visitor into inconvenient hurry should be disregarded.

The Entrance (P1. a) is on the N. side (as in all pyramids), 011
the thirteenth tier of stones, at a perpendicular height of49 ft. fr0m
the ground. The long passage a r, which is only 3 ft. 4 in. in width
and 3 ft. 11 in. in height, descends in a straight direction at an
angle of 2(Pil', and is altogether 106% yds. in length. We follow
this passage as far as the point d only, 20 yds. from the entrance, the
end being filled up. Here diverges the ascending passage d e, the
lower end of which is filled with massive blocks of granite, placed in
position after the interment of the mummy to protect the grave from
robbers. The hardness of the material of which this barrier consists
compelled treasure-hunters (p. 126) to avoid it and to force a
new passage (Pl. d) through the softer limestone. This is the roughest
and most awkward spot on the whole route. Beyond the granite
blocks we enter the passage (Pl. de), il yds. in length, with a very
slippery floor, beyond which lies the Great Hall (Pl. h).
