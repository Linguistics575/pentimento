The possessive pronouns are indicated by suffixes, added to
nouns, verbs, or prepositions.
my, mine == ct (after a final vowel -ya, after verbs m?)
thine (masc.) == -aI: (after a flnal vowel Jo); thine (fcm.) == -ih
(after a final vowel -kt)
his == -uh (after a final vowel 41); her == -htt

our == ma
your == -lturtt
their == -hum

In the case of most feminine nouns ending in a or e (ch) a t is
inserted before the suffix. When otherwise three consonants would
come together a short vowel is inserted between the stem and the
suffix. Examples: katbt, my dog; kurstya, my chair; halbina, our
dog; thagaratkum, your tree; darabn?, he struck me; misiktuhum,
thou tookest them; 'and?, beside me, i.e. i have i 'audak, beside thee,
i.e. thou hast; 'aleikum, over you.

ARTICLE. El is the definite article for all genders and all Httit1-.
bers. Before words beginning with t, d, r, z, 3, sh, g, d, J, or n the
l of the article is usually assimilated with such initial consonant;
e.g. er-rOil, the man. There is no indefinite article (el-mu'allim,
the teacher, mu'allim, a teacher), but it is sometimes expressed by
uneducated people through the numeral 1v@id, fem. wahdeh, i.e.
wi‘zlu'd bell, a house.

NOUNS. Most feminine nouns end in a or e (ek); el-rnueallima,
the female teacher. The regular plural is formed by adding M to
the masculine stem, (it to the feminine stem; tl-rnurallirrdn, the
teachers, el-mu'allimdt, the female teachers. But there are num-
erous irregular plurals that must be learned from the dictionary;
e.g. beit, house, biyelt, houses. The dual ends in ein for the masculine,
tein for the feminine; kathein, two dogs, kalbetein, two she-dogs.

There is no regular declension of nouns. The genitive case is
expressed by the juxtaposition of the two nouns, the former always
without the article, or by the use of the auxiliary word btw, bittret,
plur. biliir; e.g. beit el-ltliatMga, or el-lien bittf ei-ldurwtga, the
house of the European. The dative case is formed by the use of the
preposition l; (to); IE 'l-khatvdga, to the European. The aeensative
