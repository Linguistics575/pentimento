connected with it (p. 132). We follow the W. side of the Pyramid.
On the rock to the right is another hieroglyphic inscription (Pl. f)
by the above-mentioned Mii, near Which are several roek-tomhs.
One of these (Pl. g), that of Nth-ern-pest, nearly opposite the
sm angle of the Pyramid, has a tine ceiling hewn in the rock in
imitation of palm-stems.

Our route now leads towards the sm to the Third Pyramid
(p. 133). To the S. of it stand three small Pyramids, belonging to
near relatives of King Mykerinos.

We now turn to the remains of the mortuary temple to the E. of
the Third Pyramid and descend towards the E. by the ancient cause-
way (p. 1â€˜24). Here, on the left, is another series of rook-tombs dat-
ing from the 4th and iith Dynasties. Among these is that of Tebchne
(Pl. h), with several chambers and recesses. This is now closed by
a wooden door and is regarded as the sacred tomb of Sidi Hamed
Sariin. Numerous villagers assemble here on Friday for religious
exercises.

In the valley before us, to the right, rises a projecting ridge of
rock containing tombs of no interest. Adjoining this rock, on the
left, is a picturesque Arab cemetery. Still farther to the E. we ob-
serve the remains of a wall (perhaps the ancient town-wall), with
a gateway. - After passing a high mound of debris, consisting
of a pyramidal mass of masonry on a proj eeting rock and supposed to
be the remains of an uncompleted pyramid, we come to other tombs
ou the left, likewise covered with sand. Among these is the tomb
of Wcr-khewcw (P1. k), a judge under the 5th Dynasty.

We now proceed to the left (N.) to 0ampbe11's Tomb, a family
tomb of the 26th Dyn., discovered by Col. Vyse in 1837 and named
by him after Col. Campbell, the British eonsu1-general in Egypt at
that period. The upper part, the mastaba proper, has been entirely
destroyed, and the shaft (53 ft. deep), at the bottom of Which is
a torrnr-ehamber vaulted with an arch having a span ofl1 ft., is now
uncovered. The sides of the shaft are separated from the surround-
ing rock by a trench, which is spanned by bridges of stone at only a
few points. The sarcophagus Which stands in the tomb-ehamber
contained the remains of the royal scribe Pc-kop Wah-eb-rg-em-
yekhet, a contemporary of King Apries. Beside the sareophagus
lies a stone lid shaped like a mummy. Iu niches in the S. and W.
sides of the shaft are two other saroophagi; a fourth sarcophagus
found here is now in the British Museum. All these saroophagi had
been opened and plundered. For a description of the similar tombs
from the Persian period, see p. 166.

We return past the Sphinx (p. 135) and the Valley Templenof
Khephren (p. 135) to the Great Pyramid and the three small pyra-
mids lying in front of it to the E.

We may now proceed to the E. to the verge of the desert-plateau,
in the direction of the Arab village of Kafr el-Haram, in order to
