V. Hieroglyphics.
By Professor G. drteindottr.

Repeated attempts were made in the 17th and 18th centuries
to decipher the peculiar picture-writing of the ancient Egyptians,
the Jesuit father Athanasius Kircher [1601-80) being among the
earliest to take up the subject. It was not, however, until the be-
ginning of the°19th century that the key was found, though Sacy,
aFrenchman, Akerblad, a Swede, and Thomas Young, the English
physicist (1773-1829), had previously attained a certain amount
of success in their efforts. Francois Champelliou, a Frenchman,
succeeded in 1822 in discovering the long-sought alphabet from a
careful comparison of royal cartouches, and so found the clue to the
principles of the Egyptian style of writing. Champollion afterwards
followed up his initial discovery with such success that he may fairly
rank as the real interpreter of the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

The first clue was afforded by the famous ‘Rosetta Stone' (now in the
British Museum), discovered in 1799 in the Fort St. Julien at Rosetta (p. 31).
This tablet of basalt bears three inscriptions: one in the ancient Egyptian
language, written in hieroglyphics, one in the popular language of a
later period, inscribed in demotic characters, and a third in Greek; but
the two last are merely translations of the first. The subject of the triple
inscription is a decree of the Egyptian priests issued in 196 B.C. in honour
of Ptolemy V. Epiphanes. The first step towards deciphering the hiero-
glyphics was made when it was ascertained that the frequently occurring
groups of signs each enclosed in an oval (so-called cartouche; comp. p. Cxxx)
were the names of kings and that the name of Ptolemy must be found
among them.

Champollion and his successors established the phonetic signi-
fieation of a large number of hieroglyphic characters, and it then be-
came possible, from a knowledge of Coptic, the latest form of the
ancient Egyptian language, not only to read but also to interpret
the inscriptions. ll. Brugseh, who led the way to the complete
interpretation of demotic texts, was also the first to point out that
in hieroglyphic writing, as in the Semitic systems of writing, only
the consonants were inscribed, while the vowels were omitted as
not essential.

The Egyptian hieroglyphics form a system of picture-writing,
in which concrete objects were originally expressed by pictures re-
presenting them (i.e. by so-called ideopraphsj; e.g.

'Face' ltr ii) 'Eye' yrt 49>-
'Moon' y'l) vr'=''ss 'Sun' re (D
'Pigeon' wr ss 'Plough' hh' m

Abstract ideas and verbs were represented on the same principle
by the use of pictures of objects suggesting in some sort the idea
to be expressed. Thus the idea 'to rule' M? was expressed by the

picture of a sceptreT, 'Upper Egypt' Jmr by a lily ' its botanical

emblem, 'to write’ sh, by a writing apparatus h', , etc.
