and contributes essentially to the dignified appearance of the ruins
of Luxor when viewed from the river. Seven couples of papyrus-
colnmns, about 52 ft. in height, with calyx-capitals, still support
a heavy architrave above a lofty abacus. The whole was built by
Amenophis 111., but (lh1t-enkh-Amun (p. 257), Ilaremheb, Sethos 1.,
Ramses 11., and Sethos 11. have likewise recorded their names upon
it. The walls on each side of the colonnade were embellished by
Tut-enkh-Amun (whose name was later replaced by that of his
successor, Haremheb) with tine reliefs, representing the great festival
celebrated at Luxor on New Year's Day. On that day the sacred
boats of the gods were brought by the Nile from Karnak to Luxor,
borne into the temple at Luxor, and returned to Karnak in the
evening. The procession is here depicted in a realistic manner
in all its interesting details, though unfortunately a large part of
the reliefs has perished with the ruined upper part of the walls.
The series begins at the N.W. corner of the colonnade and ends at
the N.E. corner.

The (second) Court of Amenophis III. (PI. C.), which visitors
actually enter first, is 49 yds. deep and 56 yds. broad, and had
double rows of columns on three sides. The columns are clustered
papyrus-columns with bud-eapitals; the E. and W. rows, with the
architrave, are in excellent preservation. - The remaining (8.)
side of this court is adjoined by the -

Pronaos or Vestibule of the temple proper (P1. D), the roof of
which was borne by 32 clustered papyrus-columns arranged in d rows
of 8. The reliefs on the E. wall show Amenophis m. before the
gods of Thebes; at the foot of the wall are personifications of the
Egyptian nomes, bearing gifts. To the left stands an Altar, dedi-
cated to the Emperor Constantine, with a Latin inscription. Ad-
joining the rear wall are two small Chapels (P1. L and M) and a
staircase (PI. N), now destroyed. One chapel (L) was dedicated
to the goddess Mut, the other (M) to the moon-god Khons. - A
door in the centre of the rear wall admits to a smaller hall, which
originally had eight columns and was converted into a Church
(Pl. E) in the Christian period. The ancient entrance to the sanc-
tuary-ehambers has here been altered into a kind of apsidal recess,
bounded on the right and left by two granite Corinthian columns.
At a few points the Christian whitewash has peeled off, permitting
the 'heathen' reliefs of Amenophis III. to become visible again.
Adjoining the church are several small rooms (Pl. I on the W.,
Pl. ll and E on the E.).

We return to the Vestibule and quit the temple by a door on
the E. side, then turn to the right and re-enter it almost immediately
(three doors) to inspect the Birth Room (P1. R), the roof of which
rested upon three clustered columns. The room owes its name to the
Beliefs on the W. wall, referring to the divine birth of Amenophis m.
The reliefs on the S. wall refer to his accession to the throne.
