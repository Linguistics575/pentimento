IV. MEDIIE VAL HISTORY.

The country was ravaged for seven years by pestilence and
famine, owing to the failure of the Nile inundation. Pal-
estine and Syria were oYerr1lI1 by the Seljuks, who attacked
them from the E. There were reVolts among the Turkish
and Berber mercenaries. The palace and the library were
plundered.

Badr el-Gamdli, Mustanyir's Armenian vizier, restored order
in the capital, and governed with almost unlimited power,
to the great advantage of Egypt. His son -

El-Afdal became vizier to the young; ealiph, -

El-Musta‘li, son of Mustany'r, who conquered -

Jerusalem and the towns on the Syrian coast, but was de-
prived of his conquests by the army of the First Crusade.

King Baldwin, of Jerusalem attacked Egypt unsuccessfully.

Owing to a succession of incapable caliphs the Empire of
the Fatimites gradually fell to pieces. The viziers, Ei-
Af'dat (assassinated in 1121) and his successors, were the
actual rulers of the country.

EI-NH, the last Fatimite enliph.

Contests for the ofiiee, of vizier took plaee during this reign
between Shawer and Dirghdm. The former, being exiled,
obtained ai, asylum with A'tr ed-Din, the ruler of Aleppo,
who assisted him to regain his office with Kurd mercen-
ary troops, under the brave generals ShtrltO and Saladin.
Shiwer, quarrelliug with the Kurds, invoked the aid of
Amalarich 1., King of Jerusalem, who came to Egypt and
expelled the Kurds. A second army of Kurds, which was
about to invade Egypt, Was driven back in the Same
way, whereupon Amalarich himself endeavoured to obtain
possession of Egypt. Shawer next invoked the aid of his
enemy Ntu: ed-Din, whose Kurdish troops expelled Ama-
larich. Egypt thus fell into the hands of the Kurds ShirkO
and Saladin. Shawer was executed. Shtrkfih became chief
vizier, and on his death -

Saladin (Saléh ed-frm Yusuf ibn Aiytib, p. d5) ruled in the
name of the incapable caliph. On the death of the latter
Saladin became sole ruler of Egypt, and founded the dyn-
asty of the -

Aiyubides. 1171-1250.

Saladin's reign was the most brilliant in the mediaeval history
of Cairo, though he resided only eight years in the city and
spent the rest of the time in campaigns in Palestine, Syria,
and Mesopotamia. He began the citadel (p. 68). The Shiite
doctrines and forms of worship, introduced into Egypt by
the Fatimites, were abolished. Syria was conquered.

Malik el-Gil, his brother, for a short time preserved the
