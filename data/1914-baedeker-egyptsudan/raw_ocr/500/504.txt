tiyeh), a Mosque (P1. 13), the Roman Catholic Church, and the Savoy
and Grand Hotels.

To theN. of Luxor extend the immense ruins of Karnak (p. 262),.
connected with it formerly by the lanes of the city, now by a broad
street planted with trees (Pl. 0, D, 2, 1). Even under the Pharaohs
the Temple of Amen, the chief god of Thebes, was considered the
most striking creation of an age peculiarly famous for architectural
achievements. To this day few other buildings in the world can
match its dimensions. Farther to the N. is another extensive temple-
site at Afedam0t (p. '281), which must be regarded as occupying the
site of a suburb of Thebes.

On the left (\V.) bank (p. 281) was the Neeropolis, with vaults in
the rock and tombs on the desert-soil, adjeined by many temples
and dwelling-houses. Even in antiquity the Tombs of the Kings
(p. 284) were reckoned among the chief sights of ancient Thebes.

The HISTORY of Thebes under the Ancient Empire is veiled in
uncertainty. The Egyptian name for the town was WEset, or more
shortly Newt, 'the city', whence the Scriptural name No or No-Amon
('eity', 'city of Amon'). The W. bank was known as 'the West of
Wtiset' or 'the West of the city'. No satisfactory explanation has
been offered of why the Greeks called it Thebes (87730:!) a name
they frequently bestowed upon their own cities. Among the Greeks
the town was known also as Ato'crroltg, 'eity of Zens' (Amen),
also called Diospolis hé megalé or Diospolis Magna to distinguish it
from Diospolis Parva or mu (p. 244). Wéset was the capital of a
nome, and it was ruled by princes of its own, whose tombs (6th Dyn.)
were discovered at Drah Abu’l Negga (p. 283). The local deity was
the falcon-headed Mont, a god of war, who was worshipped also in
the neighbouring town of Hermonthis. Several other places lay near
Wéset on the E. bank; among these were Epet-Esowet (the modern
Karnak) and South Apet (Luxor), which were afterwards incorporated
with the great 'city' and subjected to the same governors.

When Theban princes assumed the royal dignity during the
Middle Empire Thebes rose to a more commanding position. The
city was adorned with temples, amongst which the large shrines
raised in Epet-Esotret and South Apet to the god Amen were con-
spicuous. But the greatness of Thebes dates only from the begin-
ning of the New Empire. The liberation of the country from the
Hyksos and the reunion of the empire was directed from Thebes,
and that city continued for centuries to be the favourite seat of the
Pharaohs, and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures
exacted as tribute or brought as booty from conquered nations. A
large share of this wealth was bestowed upon Amen. The mag-
nifieent and gigantic temples erected at this period to the god are
still among the chief sights of Thebes. The grandees of the kingdom
esteemed it an honour to become priests of Amen, the schools be-
