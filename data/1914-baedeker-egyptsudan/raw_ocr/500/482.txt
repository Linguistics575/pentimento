pouring water from three vases embellished with flowers. In the
next scene the king with the censer appears before a shrine in the
midst of which Osiris is enthroned; in front of the god stand Meat
and 1tonpet(goddess of the year) and behind are Isis, Amentet (god-
dess of the West), and Nephthys, with nine small gods of the dead
in the background. On Pier C is a representation of the highly ad-
orned sacred post Tet, the symbol of Osiris of Busiris (p. cli), to the
right and left of which stands the king, wearing the crown of Lower
Egypt (comp. the representation on the pier in the S. wall, Pl. d).
To the left of Pier e the king presents an image of Maat to Osiris,
Isis, and Iiorns. The king's profile is evidently a faithful likeness
and is everywhere portrayed with great artistic skill.

Adjoining this hall, in a direct line with the seven entrance
doors, are Seven Sanctuaries, of which that in the middle was
dedicated to Amon, the chief deity under the New Empire. To
the right are the sanctuaries of Osiris, Isis, and Horns; to the left
those of Harakhte, Ptah, and the king. Each contained the sacred
boat of its god and was shut off by a folding door. The central chapel
was approached by a flight of steps, the others by inclined planes.
The roofs of these chapels are not vaulted in the strict architec-
tural signitieation of that word; they are formed of two horizontal
courses, each projecting over the one below, and rounded off by the
chisel to the form of an arch. The vaults are decorated with stars
and the names of Sethos 1., while the walls are covered with reliefs,
illustrating the ceremonies that took place in the sanctuaries. The
colouring is in excellent preservation. In the piers separating the
doors are square recesses, which are likewise adorned with reliefs.

Those who desire to examine more particularly the sanctuaries and
shrines should begin with the KISGâ€˜S SANCTUARY, to the left. Left Wall.

Wall. Lower vow (frmn left to right): the king with his guardian-spirit and
the priest, as on the opposite wall; the king seated beside Nekhbeyet and
Buto on a throne supported by the written symbol for 'union', about which

(a scene symbolizing the union of Egypt under the king); to the right
Seshet inscribes the king's name for eternity; the priest before nine gods.
Upper row: the priest and Thout before the (defaced) image of the king,

Rear Wall in this and all the other sanctuaries except that of Osiris (see
p. 241) was occupied by two false doors (p. clxviii), surmounted by round
pediments and separated by the representation of a flower on which a
serpent lies. - NICHE f. To the left Thout holds the symbol of 'life' to
the king's noses, to the right Thout and the king sit facing each other; on
