chief assistant, Rousset, the French consul, and a Greek were
treacherously decoyed to the left bank and murdered by this people,
an atrocity by which Gordon’s isolation was hastened and his ulti-
mate fate sealed. -f?.,i)'7 M. Abu Dis; 291 M. Shereilc, prettily situated
among palms near the river; 319 M. El-Karalia.

347 M. Et-tAlridtyeh (Abidiajis situated above the Fifth Cataract.
In the summer of 1898 half-a-dozen stern-wheel gun-boats and three
large screw-steamers for the Nile f10tilla were put together here. A
hospital and workshops still lend the place some importance.

362 M. Berber (1048 ft.; Rest House), or El-Mekheirif, was
destroyed during the Mahdist rebellion, but it was afterwards re-
built a little to the N. and is gradually recovering its importance.
The town stretches along the E. bank of the Nile for a distance of
51/2 M. The river-banks here are exceedingly fertile, but very
scantily populated, though the government actively encourages the
settlement of peasant proprietors. Berber is noted for riding-eamelis,
woven fabrics, silver-work, leathern goods (c.g. red shoes), camel-
saddles, water-skins, saddIe-hags, and saddle-blankets. The Stodin
salt prepared here formerly circulated throughout all Central Africa
as an article of barter, in the form of small brown cones.

A caravan-route leads from Berber to (246 M.) Kassala, a journey of
about 10 days.

388 M. Atbara. Junction (baths at the railway station), situated
to the N. of the junction of the Atbara and the Nile, is a flourishing
place with large railway-workshops. This is the point of divergence
of the Nile & Red Sea Railway, which runs to Port Sudan and
Suékin (see pp. 426, 4‘25). To the left of the railway is a cemetery
containing graves of the British soldiers who died in the hospital
after the battle of Atbara. The railway is here carried by an iron
bridge over the river Atbara (p. lxiv), the channel of which is dry
from April to June. - The battle of Atbara took place on April 8th,
1898. Kitchener marched from Berber to Iliidi on the Atbara,
whence he attacked the Emir Malumid, who was strongly posted at
a place called Nakhfileh. The victory of the British opened the
way for a further advance to the Stidin.

395 M. Ed-Ddmer, the capital of the province of Berber, lies to
the S. of the junction of the Atbara and the Nile, on the right bank
of the latter. In the neighbourhood are the remains of the fortified

hitish camp of 1897-8.

408M. Zeidab. The scenery now assumes a savannah-like ehar-
acter, with a bushy undergrowth, intersected by the usually dry beds
of 'khtrs' or mountain-torrents. Game is abundant, including
gazelles, hyzenas, hares, guinea-fowl, and bustards. - 4331/2 M.
