from the reigns of Thutmosis III. and Sethos 1.; but we cannot
refuse our admiration even to these products of later Egyptian art.

We first enter the Great Vestibnle, or Pronaos, Which has
2/t sistrum-eolymns with heads of Hathor (p. clxi). At the top of
the faeade is a huge concave cornice, in the middle of which is the
winged sun-disk.

Un the upper edge pf the cernice is the following Greek inscription
of three lines: I'Ttép Auroxpdtopoc TLBspiou Kaicapoc Néou 1hiaaxoii 380:3

gods, in the . . . . year of Me Emp. Tiberius . . . .'

The exterior front of the hall is enclosed by six stone screens
between the columns in the first row. The interior walls of the pro-
naos are decorated with four rows of representations. These depict
the rulers (in succession the Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberius,
Caligula, Claudius, and Nero) advancing with votive offerings for
llathor and other gods. The mutilated reliefs on the screens be-
tween the columns (P1. a-f) refer to the ceremonial entrance of the
ruler into the temple.

RELIEFS ON THE SCREENS. To the right of the entrance (PLa, b,c):
at a We see the king, wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, quitting the
palace, followed by his guardian-spirit and preceded by a priest off'er-
ing incense; at b the falcon-headed Horus and the ibis-headed Thout
sprinkle the king with drops of water forming the symbol of life; at c
the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt bestow blessings upon the king.
To the left (on the W. wall) is a relief: the king is conducted before
Hathor by the gods Mont of Hermonthis and Atum of Heliopolis. - The
representations at Pl. d, e, f, to the left of the entrance, are similar,
except that at d the king wears. the crown of Upper Egypt.

The sculptured DIAGRAMS ON THE CEILING are interesting also. They
are divided by the columns into seven bands, running from end to end
uf the Pronaos, and refer to astronomical subjects. Is: Band (to the ex-
treme left; Pl. f). Nut, goddess of the sky; beneath her are pictures of
the Zodiac and boats with personifieations of the stars. The sun shines
upon the temple of Dendera, here typitied by a head of Hathor. 2nd Band.
Deities of the stars and the Hours of the day and night. 3rd Band. Phases
of the Moon and the course of the Sun during the 12 hours of the day.
4th Band (in the centre). Flying vultures and san-disks. Bands 5-7 repeat
the scenes in Bands 3-1.

The rear wall of this great vestibule forms the fapade of the
temple proper; it is surmounted by a concave cornice and a round
moulding. In the centre is a door leading to the -

Hypostyle Hall ('Hall of the Appearance'), the roof of which is
supported by six columns, with elaborate foliage-eapitals on which
heads of Hathor also appear. The base and lowest two drums of each
column are of granite, the remainder of sandstone. Eight square
apertures in the ceiling admit the light. Four rows of reliefs on
the walls exhibit the king before the gods of Dendera. In this and
