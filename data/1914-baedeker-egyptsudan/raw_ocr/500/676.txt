390 Route 27. RAutBsmpm. Temple of

In the W. side of the S. pylon-tower are two doors, one (N.)
leading to a chamber, the other (8.) to a staircase ascending in
three flights to the roof (fine view). The N. tower also contains a
staircase. On each side of the court four narrow chambers have
been constructed in the wall; and a door in the N. colonnade com-
municates with the passage round the temple and with a crypt.
The rear wall of the court
forms the imposing facade
of the vestibule, which
is entered by the large
portal in the middle. Be-
tween the columns are
four stone screens.

On the first screen to
the left Thout and Horus
are shown anointing the king
with the eonseerated water,
iypified by the hieroglyphs
for 'life' and 'purity'. Adja-
cent sits the god Harsi'Ã©sis
of Talmis.

On the first screen to the
right is a Greek inscription.
This is a decree of Aurelius
Besarion, also named Amo-
nius, governor of Umhos and
Elephantine, ordering the
nwners of swine to remove
their animals from the holy
Talmis. It probably dates
from 248-9 A.D. - On the
second column to the right
are two Greek inscriptions,
between which is a long
inscription in the Neroitie
cursive character (p. cxxxi).

This is the Memorial Inscription of Silko, sub-king of the Nubians and all
the Ethiupians (ea. 5th cent. A.D.), in which he celebrates, in bad Greek,
his victory over the memmyes, whom he defeated 'from Primis to Talmis,
arlsraneing as far as Taphis and Talmis'.

The VESTIBULE, or Pronaos (P1. C), the roof of which has fallen
in, has l'2 columns, with elaborate floral capitals. Most of the reliefs
represent the emperor in presence of the gods; two, on the rear
(WA wall, to the left of the door, deserve notice. One shows one of
the Ptolemies presenting a field to Isis, Mandulis, and a third deity;
the other (to the right) represents Amenophis IL, founder of the
original temple o. 389), offering a libation of wine to Min and
Mandulis. On the stone screen to the left of the entrance is a later
Christian painting of the Hebrew Children in the fiery furnace.
