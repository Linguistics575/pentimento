(Qolosna; p. 226) is situated between the Nile and the Ibrthimiyeh
Canal; opposite, on the E. bank of the Nile, is the village of Es-
Sarirfyeh (p. 226). Our line crosses the Abu Bahara Canal, which
diverges from the Nile. - 138 M. SaanMiit is a district-capital
(8178 inhab.) on the Ibréhimiyeh Canal, with sugar-factories,
palms, and fields of clever. On the E. bank rises the massive
Gebct e.i- Teir (p.226), forming a picturesque background for the
numerous sails 011 the Nile. Extensive e0tton-fieHs are passed,
then sugar-plantations, and rich vegetation.

144 M. Etta. On the E. bank of the Nile lies Tehna el-thut, a
village with 2108 inhabitants.

To the S. of the village is the IGhn, or mound, with the ruins of the
ancient city of Tim's, also known as Acaris, belonging to the nome of
Hermopolis. To the S. of this is a ridge 65-80 ft. in height, with some
early-Egyptian ROCK Tomas which were again used in the Greek period.
One Sepulchral Chapel, containing some representations of a late date, is
interesting. A Greek or Roman grandee is here shown saerifieing to a
number of Egyptian deities. The only inscriptions extant are on the inner
side of the door. Higher up on the rock-walls are two horses in the Roman
style, held by men. The rock tombs farther to the S. belong to the Ancient
Empire. A colossal image carved out of the rock represents Ramses III.
saerifieing to the gods Sobek and Amen. - In the valley between the
rocky ridge just mentioned and the Arabian Mountains, to the N. of the
Mohammedan cemetery, lie tr Graco-Roman and a Christian neeropolis.

Pacha Kamel, R. 10 pias.), a flourishing town with 27,221 inhab.,
lies between the Ibrithhntyeh Canal and the Nile, which is here over
1/2 M. broad. The Shirit el-Mahatta leads from the station to the
town. Ahandsome bridge, with locks, spans the canal. Market-day
(Mom) in Minyeh presents a very gay and characteristic picture
of oriental life. The mt1diriyeh of Minyeh (750 sq. M.) includes
269 villages and 659,967 inhabitants. Minyeh is connected by
branch-lines with Matti (p. 207) and Réda (p.209). For the ex-
cursion to Benihasan, see p. 209.

Opposite Miuyeh, on the E. bank, lies K6rn el-fire/Ura, with
tombs of the Middle Empire. Farther to the s., 41/2 M. above
Minyeh, is situated Zdwiyet el-Meitin (Ztrwiyet el-Amwiit). To the S.
of the village lies the cemetery of the citizens of Minyeh, with its
numerous domed tombs and chapels. Faithful to the custom of

dead across the river and bury them near the ancient necropolis.

A few minutes' walk towards the S. brings us to the large

the ancient Rock Tombs of the princes and grandees of Hebenu,
which date mainly from the end of the Ancient Empire. They are
unfortunately in bad preservation, and some of them have been
