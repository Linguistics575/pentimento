Constantinople. Under the Turks few new buildings were erected
in Cairo and the city was freely exposed to the exactions of the
soldiery, but it still remained a busy and brilliant provincial capital.
- After the Battle of the Pyramids (p. 79) in 1798 Cairo was oe-
cupied by Bonaparte, who established his headquarters here for
several months. On his return to France Kléber was left as Com-
mander-in-chief of the French troops at Cairo, where he was assass-
inated 011 June 14th, 1800. In 1801 the French garrison under
Jlelliard, being hard pressed by the granil-vizier, was compelled to
capitulate. On August 3rd, 1805, Mohammad Ali, as the recognized
pasha ot‘Egypt, took possession of the citadel, which for the last
time witnessed a bloody scene on March 1st, 1811 (comp. p. 68).
Under Ismittt the neighbourhood of the Esbek/iyelt (p. M) was re-
modelled, the great thoroughfare known as the Shtrr Clot Bey and
Suri' Mohammed 'Ali was formed, and the new suburb of Jmnd"il't"yeh
was begun to the S.W. of the Ezbektyeh. To the N. of the last the

The ”Street Scenes presented by the city of the Caliphs adrnir-
ably illustrate the whole world of oriental fietion and produce an
indelible impression on the uninitiated denizen of the West. This
oriental life seems to feel the atmosphere of the newer quarters
