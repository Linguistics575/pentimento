9. Medinet Habu.

About 1 M. from Deir el-Medineh and 1/2 M. from the Meumou
colossi (p. 330), in a conspicuous situation, lies the southernmost
temple-group of the Theban Necr0polis. This bears the name of
Medinet Habu (‘town ofHabu'), a Christian village which arose
around and even within the ancient sanctuary as early as the 5th
cent., and of which considerable traces still remain.

The entire edifice may be divided into two easily distinguished
portions. One of these is a smaller and older temple of the 18thDyn-
asty (p. 328), afterwards enlarged. The other is the main temple
of Ramses III. (p. 323), which was enclosed by a crenelated wall,
13 ft. high. We pass the pylon and other buildings in front of the
small temple and visit iirst the structure of Ramses.

We pass through the outer wall by means ol' a Gate (Pl. A),
about13ft. wide, flanked by two smallPorter’s Lodges. Beyond these
we are confronted by the remarkable edifice resembling the gateway
of a fortress and known as the --

High Gate or Pavilion ofRamses 111., which forms the entrance
to the temple-precincts instead of the ll sual massive pylon and portals
of stone. This structure interrupts the great inner wall of brick
which enclosed all the temples within a rectangle and was connected
with the royal palace (p. 324). The pavilion thus formed a part of
the palace, which stood at some distance from it. Its apartments
were occasionally used as a residence by the Pharaoh and his harem
and were decorated accordingly (romp. p. 323). Two tall towers
(Pl.h,c), with almost imperceptibly sloping walls and with their E.
sides resting upon a battering foundation-wall, enclose a narrow
court, gradually contracting towards the back, where there is a gate-
way (Pl. a) in the central erection joining the towers. The reliefs on
the Facade of the Right Tower CPI. b) show the king smiting his foes
in presence ofHarakhte; below are seven fettered princes, represent-
ing the vanquished peoples (Kheta or Hittites, Emor or Amorites,
Zakari, Shanlana or Sardinians, Shakalasha 0r Sicilians, Tuirsha or
Tyrrhenians, and Peleste or Philistines; comp. pp. 324, 325). On the
Facade ofthe Left Tower (Pl. c) is a corresponding picture of Ramses
smiting his Nubian and Libyan foes before Amon-Ré.

In the Court between the towers are two seated figures of the
iion-headed goddess Sekhmet, in black granite (found in front of
the gate). 011 the walls, between the first and second stories, are
some curious consoles 0r brackets, which are adorned with the busts
of four captive enemies, andlliormerly bore statues of the king. The
reliefs ou the walls are mostly siritieial in character.
