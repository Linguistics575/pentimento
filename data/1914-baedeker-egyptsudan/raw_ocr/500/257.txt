Mr.Beadue11 in the Libyan desert. In the centre room are three skulls

rhinoceros; from the Faiyomr, bones of the Paleeomastodon and Mozrithe-

of the grounds is the Geographical Society (p. 42); and in the NE.

2. The Muski and its Side Streets.

A visit to the chief Bazaars (comp. p. 50), to which this section is de-
voted, is so full of novelty and interest that the traveller will scarcely have
time to combine with the first visit the inspection of the Mosques passed on
the way. - Both ladies and gentlemen, aided by the fol_lowing description
and the" plan of the town (p. 35), may plunge fearlessly into the thickest of
the crowd, especially ifthey do not mind taking an occasional wrong turning.

The chief thoroughfare of the Arabian part of Cairo is the
*Muski (Pl. C, D, 3), which begins at the square of El- 'Ataba el-.
Khadra (p. iii and with its continuations the Sikkeh el- Gedideh
(see below) and the Shari esh- Sharawini (P1. E, F ,3), traverses the
entire breadth of the old town (nearly 1 M.). This street has now to
a great extent lost its external oriental characteristics. The 1111-
111erous tobacco and cigar stores and emporiums of clothing present
quite a European exterior. But the oriental features of the traftie
o. 46) that surges up and down the street from morning till night
are still unchanged. At the end of the Muski, a little short of the
square known as Silk el-Kanto (P1. D, 3), we enter the old city of
the Fatimites (p. 44), the second wall of which, erected after 1074,
is still represented by the Bab el-FutUt and the Bib en-liter (p. 77),
its N. gates, and the B51) Zuweileh (p. 60), its S. gate. Its W.
boundary was the old canal of El- Khalig, now the Shari Khalig el-
Matti (tramway No. 5, p. 38): - We follow the continuation of the
Muski, the SIKKBH sir,-+sDtDBH (RUB NEUVB), to the insignificant
