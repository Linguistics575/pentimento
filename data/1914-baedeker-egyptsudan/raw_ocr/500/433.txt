The Faiythn. KASR KARUN. 14. Route. 197

for the caravans trading with the oases in the Libyan Desert
The ruins cover an area of about 125 acres. A street 400 yds. in
length, formerly embellished with figures of recumbent lions, leads
past well-preserved houses to a platform on which an important
temple once stood. This temple, built under the Ptolemies, was
dedicated to Sokuopaios (p. 196) and the 'beautifully enthroned
Isis'. The precinct was surrounded by a brick wall, and the temple
itself contained several apartments, those in the rear being lined
with well-jointed limestone-blocks and those in front having walls
of roughly hewn stone coated with stucco. Very few reliefs have
been found here; on one appears a Ptolemy praying before a ram-
headed deity (probably Amen).

At the foot of a steep descent in the Libyan Desert, about 5 M. to
the N. of Dimei, Prof. Sehweinfurth discovered the small Temple of Iiatr
e.s-1.hiyha. It consists of blocks of limestone and centains seven recesses
and several other apartments, but no sculptures or inscriptions. In the
vicinity are remains of an ancient quay.

In the desert, to the E. from the E. bank of the lake and to the N.W.
from Ti'tmiyeh (p.193), rises the mound of Kdm Ushim, covering the ruins
of Karartis. a Greek town frequently mentioned in local history, with a
temple of Pnepher6s and Petesuchos. - The mound called Umm el-All,
q ll. to the bl. of Karanis, marks the site of Bacchias, with a ruined
Greek temple. Both mounds were explored in 1896 by Messrs. Hogarth
and Grenfell, at the expense of the Egypt Exploration Fund.

The ruins marking the site of East Ifartut lie at the S.W. end of
the Birket liart1rr. We land on the promontory of Khashm Kham,
which is overgrown with tamarisks aud reeds. Ascending thence
across the desert for about an hour, we reach the temple, which is
now 21/4 M. from the lake, though it originally stood on its bank.
The fishermen object to pass the night here, being afraid of the
Beduins and the Afrit (evil spirits).

Easr Fariln is most conveniently visited from Shawdslmeh (El-Cha-
wachnah), a station on the light railway (p. 193).

East Karun is a fairly well preserved temple, of the late Pto-
female period. The numerous traces of an ancient town that sur-
round it are probably those of Dionysias, which was situated on the
extreme W. verge of the Roman province of Egypt, at the beginning
of the caravan-route to the 'Small Oasis' (Bahriyeh, p. 379). A cir-
cular foundation-wall indicates the site of an ancient cistern. The
walls of the temple consist of carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in the oases, was
dedicated to the ram-headed Arnorr-khnum, as is proved by two
figures of this deity standing at the highest part of the posterior wall
of the upper story of the open roof. The winged sun-disk occurs over
each gateway in the building. There are no ancient inscriptions.

The temple is 21 yds. in width across the fagmle and 291/2 yds. in length.
The entrance, facing the E., is approached by a lofty and carefully con-
structed platform, lk yds. in length, forming a forecourt. On the fagade
of the temple, to the right (NJ of the entrance-door, is a huge 1ialf-eolumn,
forming a relic of a pillared hall. Un the lower floor are the apartments
