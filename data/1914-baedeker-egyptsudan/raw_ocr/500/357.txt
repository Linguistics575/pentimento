Tomb of Numbers. PYRAMIDS OF Gizrm. th Route. 139

inspect the Tombs ofthe Ancient Empire, hollowed out in the rocky
slope. Several of these are now used as dwellings or stables. The
best known is the Tomb of Numbers (Pl. n), which belonged to a
certain Khef'r"i-oneklt, a comrtier of Khephren. On the left part of' the
entrance-wall appear the deceased and his brother, accompanied by
a dog, inspecting the cattle that are driven before them by peasants.
The peasants are arranged in several rows, headed by one bearing
the sunshade of his master. Scribes are, engaged in recording the
number of cattle of each kind, the numbers being placed above
the herds (whence the name of the tomb). Thus we are informed
that Jrhefrironekh had 853 oxen, 220 cows and calves, 2235 goats,
760 asses, and 974 rams. On the left (S.) wall are the deceased
and his wife at table. On the rear (W.) wall are five door-shaped
steles with a statue of the deceased, to the left. The mural reliefs,
\ which are in poor preservation, are in the clumsy and undeveloped
style of the 4th Dynasty. - On the S. horizon, ca. (l N. distant, rise
the pyramids of Abusir (p. iM) and the step-pyramid of Salilrira
(p. 146).

An expedition across the desert to the Western Peiri/ied Forest
(hmm el-Khashab) is attractive (guide necessary). To the N. of the
Mena House Ilotel we strike off to the W. and after a ride of 3 hrs.
across a sandy valley reach the beginning of the petrified forest,
which extends as far as the Widi Natp1n (p. 32). The specimens
of petrified trees here are much finer than those in the petrified
forest in the Arabian Desert (pp. 118, 119).

THE Excunsmx TO THE PYRAMIDS OF ABU Roisa, which lie 5 M.
to the N. of the Pyramids of Gizeh, takes about half-a-day and is
most conveniently made from the Mena House Hotel, where donkeys,
camels, or deserr-earriages may be obtained. - The route leads
tl1rougl1 the desert, skirting the edge of the cultivated land. Itthen
bends to the E. through fields and reaches (3/4 hr.) the village of
Rerddseh, which is prettily situated amid palm-groves and is itself
a sufficient attraction for an excursion, especially on 31011., which
is the weekly market-day. We then proceed through palm-groves
to tl hr.) the village of Abu Rodsh, with the tomb of the saint of
that name. Here we again turn to the W. across the desert and
ascend by the ancient approach from the NIL, of which about 1 M.
is still preserved, to the 1/9 hr.) abrupt rocky plateau. On this
plateau stands the large Pyramid of Abu Roash, known by the natives
as El-Nia, the tomb of the king Tetf-ré (4th Dyu.). The pyr-
amid itself has almost entirely disappeared, but we can look down
into the hollow hewn in the rock which contains the sepulchral
chamber. and on the passage descending to it. The remains ofhrick
buildings to the E. of the pyramid belong to the mortuary temple.
Adjacent is the house of the French Archaeological Institute. .--. A
