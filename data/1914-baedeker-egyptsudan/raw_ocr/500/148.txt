received human figures, with the heads of the animals in which they
revealed themselves. Thus Sobek appears as a man with a eroeodile's
head, Khnum with a rarn's head, Thom with an ibis's head, Horus
with a faleon's head, etc. The various Cow Goddesses have a
human head with cow's horns, while over the vulture goddess
Mut (worshipped in Thebes) a vulture spreads its wings, and the
head of Neith of Sa'is was adorned with a bundle of arrows, which
was the form in which she was worshipped. Though such a device
cannot but appear strange to us as it did to the Greeks, it must
be confessed that the Egyptian artists in their reliefs and statues
of those animal-headed deities managed the transition from the
ani mal's head to the human body with remarkable skill.

',esides the local deities, whose spheres of influence were limited
to particular districts, there were even in the earliest times a certain
number of universal deities, who were revered by the whole nation.
Amoug these were the god keh (the earth), the goddess Nut (the
sky), the god Show (the air), the goddess Te/hut (the dew), the sun-
god RE, a masculine deity with the Egyptians as with the Greeks
(Helios), Hapi (the Nile), and Nun (the ocean); among the stars
Orion and Sothis (Sirius or the Dog Star. a female deity) played the
leading roles. These were all impersonal beings, who revealed them-.
selves only in natural phenomena; they were therefore not eoniined
to any particular place of worship, but were everywhere revered. Only
at a later period, though still in prehistoric times, did these forces
of nature, the great gods of heaven, receive human forms and special
places of worship. Thus the sun-god IIE came to be specially wor-
shipped at Heliopolis, and the divine couple Show and Tefnut as lion-
headed deities at Leontonpolis (p. 171).

Already at an early period the religious conceptions regarding
many of the gods wore deepened or expanded, as certain charaeter-
istics became especially emphasized. Thus, 3.9., the faleon-heai1ed
Mont, the local god of Ilermonthis, was a war-god; the god Min of
Koptos, where the desert road across the mountains from the Red Sea
joins the valley of the Nile, became the patron deity of travellers in
the desert, then also a god of fertility, whence the Greeks identified
him with Pan; Ptah of Memphis was the patron of artists, metal-
workers, and smiths, and was thus the Egyptian Hephmstos; the
powerful Sekhmet of Memphis became a terrible war-goddess, who
annihilated the enemy, while on the other hand stress was laid on
the more attractive attributes of Hathor of Dendera, who was wor-
shipped as the goddess of love and joy (resembling Aphrodite). Many
local deities were connected with the moon and the sun and other
cosmic powers. Thus Thout of Hermopolis was regarded as a moon-
god, who had created the times of day and the cosmic universe; he
Was the inventor of hieroglyphic writing and therefore the patron
deity of scribes and scholars. Above all Horus was transformed into
a god of the heavens in connection with the sun and received the
