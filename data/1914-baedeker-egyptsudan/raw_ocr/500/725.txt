the White Nile, which promises to be one of the finest cotton-
growing districts. - 230 M. Hitlet 'Abhts. The railway now crosses
the White Nile by a remarkable iron bridge of seven spans (1910),
with a central swing-span, 82 yds. wide, for the passage of boats.
236 M. Kosti (steamboat station, see p. 43-1), on the left bank of
the White Nile, near the S. end of the island of Abba (p. 43d), was
originally named after a Greek settler. It is a rising place, being
one of the chief markets for the produce of the province of Kordofen.
It lies on the borders of the negro lands, and representatives of the
nearest tribes (Habbanias, Danaglas, Dinkas, and oeeasionally
Shilluks) are seen in the market-place.

- El-Obeid or El-0bei4 (1900 ft.), the capital of the province of Kordof2n
(area 131,500 sq. W), has taken a new lease of life as the centre of the
gum trade. It is situated in N. lat. 13° Il' and E. long 30'' II', and extends
over a flat hollow, at the lowest parts of which are numerous springs of
good water. The population, at one time numbering about 35,000. consists
of Arabs and Nubian negroes, and in the dry season, when the neighbouring
villages have no longer any water, it now amounts to about 12,000. With
the exception of the mosques and a few large buildings the houses are
almost all round straw-covered huts with conical roofs. To the S.1ie the
barracks and the government building. An Egyptian force under Hicks
Pasha, which attempted to take El-Ohei‘d from the Mahdi, was completely
annihilated on Nov. 5th, 1833 (comp. p. cxxiv).

W. and in 1/.2 hr., at the Mogren Point (p. 429), reach the White
Nile, which forms the verdant island of Dakin at its confluence with
the Blue Nile. The steamer enters the W. arm of the White Nile.
The so-called 'Gordon's Tree' or 'Mushir Bey' forms a landmark which
is conspicuous far and near. When the river is high it is 2-3 JI.
wide and resembles a great lake. Large herds of cattle may frequently
be seen grazing on the low flat banks. - On the E. bank of the river,
31 M. from J0ar.torn, rises the hill of GebelAuli, the limestone quar-
ries of which yielded the material for All Saints' Cathedral and other
buildings at Klrarttsm. About 29 M. farther 011 (E. bank) is the
Gehel Jlandara, on which lies El-Geteina, a large village inhabited
mainly by Danagla Arabs. - 2ND DAY. The banks are now eovered
with low but thick groves of mimosa and acacia. In the distance we
see the Gebet Araehkol, a group of bare rocky hills about 330 ft. in
height. - 130 M. Ei-Dueim (W. bank), the capital of the province
of the White Nile, with regularly laid out streets, is inhabited by
Danagla and Hassaniyeh Arabs. It has a small mosque, designed by
a Greek architect, and an unpretending Greek café. Barley, wheat,
onions, and hibiscus plants are cultivated here. Ed-Du" was once
the chief trading-centre for gum arabic, but has been superseded by
EI-Obe'id (see above) since the construction of the railway. This was
the point at which the Egyptian force of Hicks Pasha quitted the Nile
