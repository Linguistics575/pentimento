only by the very pious. But in religiousr risings the zakat' 1s an inexhaustible
source of supply. A special kind of charitable tax, called the zakdt el- Ji.tr,
or tax for breaking the fast, is almost universal.

For the PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA (igagg) the pilgrims assemble at parti-
eular points, Those from Egspt usually proceed by sea to Jidde ou the
Bed Sea (p. MM). On approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside,
even their headgear, and put on 111110115 and a piece of cloth over thelett
shoulder.They then perform the circuit ofthekaaba,kiss the black stone,
hear the 8er1t1011 on Mt. 'Arafat near Mecca, pelt Satan with stones in the
valley of Muua, and conclude theh. pilgiimage with a great sacrificial
tteast. On the day when this takes place at Ihlecca sheep are slaughtered
and a festival called the Great Bairam (El-‘Id el- Kebit , is observed through-
out all the Mohammedan countries. The conduct of the Caravan, with
the gifts preseuted to the town of Mecca, the escort, and other items,
costs the Egyptian gover nment more than 'i's0,iiiiid'rii'ii'ari.'

Other RELIGIOUS Pnecem‘s forbid the use of intoxicating liquors or ol'
the flesh of swine and the eating of the ilegl, of any animal uot slaughter-
ed in the prescribed fashion or of blood. The, position of women is clear-
1y delined. Every Moslem is permitted to have four wives at a time,
though inouogauly is the rule, owing to economic conditions. A woman
has full rights under the law of property, but under the law of succes-
sion and as a witness she is regarded as equivalent only to half a man.
The practice of veiling women, usual in the higher circles, is a matter
coming under the ftda not the sheila (p. lxxxvi): except in the towns

divorce is a grave moral danger; in Mecca, for example, prostitution exists
under the form of marriage. Further details as to Islamie law may be
found in the 'Handbueh des islamisehen Gesetzes', by Th. W. Juynholl ot
Leyden (Leipzig, 1908-10; 9 marks), a work adapted for the layman as
well as for the legal expert.

Dogma by no means plays such an important part in Islam as in
Christianity; for the simple Moslem creed is embodied in the words:
'There is 110 God but God (Allah) and Mohammed is the prophet
of God'. But all the same lively controversies over dogma have not
been absent in the development of Islam, mainly owing to the in-
t1uenee of (haco-Christian modes of thought. Just as in the sphere
of law, we find here a literal and a speculative interpretation; and
in the sphere of dogma also orthodoxy triumphed by adopting the
speculative method in a modified form. The process of amalgama-
tion is generally associated with the name of El-AWarf (d. 935).
The questions most eagerly canvassed were those relating to the free-
dom of the will, the attributes of God, and the nature of the Koran
(i.e. whether it is 'eternal' or 'created'). The orthodox solutions of
these problems are roughly as follows. There is but oneGod, 111
whom certain universal attributes inhere (knowledge, seeing, hear-.
ing, etc.), but who must not be conceived of under a human form.
He is all-mighty and has therefore created also evil, which serves
his purposes of salvation in a manner inconceivable by our limited
human intelligence. Above all, God is the Creator, who at every
moment re-creates all things. Causality is merely the creative opera-
tion of the divine will. In this connection man is not free, for every-
thing is immutably foreordained by God’s will. God operates every-
