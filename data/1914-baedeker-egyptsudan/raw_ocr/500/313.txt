of Cairn. ISLAND 0F RODA. 5. Route. 105

The Coptic convent of Deir Abu Sefein is named after the largest,
though not the oldest, church within its precincts. The convent has a
diameter of 650 ft. and includes three (partly restored) churches (Eb'A4ra
Anba Shenada, and Abu Sefein) and a nunnery (Deir el-Bandt). The entrance
is by the small gate at the S.W. angle, near the railway-line. - Among the
mounds of debris to the E. and S. of Uld Cairo are several smaller Coptic
convents (Deir Babldn, Deir Todrus, Atm A'ir tra Yuhanna, etc.), which,
however, are, of interest to specialists only. All have both male and female
inmates. The Deir Babliin preserves the name of ancient Babylon (p. 44).

The Sldrir Mast ol-liar/ls continues to follow the direction
of the arm of the, Nile. Opposite the Hairct ed-Dabweh CPI. at
p. 106) is the ferry crossing to the Island of Regla. (Geziret Raga).
We descend the slope, enter the ferry-hoat (1 pias. for one person,
there and back; payment made on returning], and ascend the oppo-
site path. A guide is usually easily found to conduct travellers
through the intricate lanes to the garden at the S. extremity of the
island, belonging to the heirs of /hrsan Pasha.

At the S. end of the garden is a NILOMETER (Mittyés), con-
structed in 716 A.D. by order of the Omaiyade caliph Suleiman.
It consists of a square well, 16 ft. in diameter, having in the centre
an octagonal column, on Which are inscribed the ancient Arabian
measures. The dirt', or old Arabian ell, is 54 centimétres, or about
211/4 inches long, and is divided into 24 liirtt.. The Cufie inscrip-
tions on the central column and on marble slabs built into the
walls refer to restorations of the nilometer in the 9th cent, under
the Abbaside caliphs Ma'mtn and Mutawakki]. Numerous later
restorations have taken place, the last in 1803, The oftiee of
measuring the water is entrusted to a sheikh.

The zero point of the nilumeter (according to 11altmtld-Bey) is 28 ft.
above the average level of the Mediterranean, so that the top of the
column is nearly 50 ft. above sea-level. The water of the Nile, when at
its lowest, covers 7 ells of the nilometer, and when it reaches a height
of 15 ells and 16 1.r'irii.t, the sheikh of the Nile measurement proclaims the
IVefa (comp. p. xcvii), Le. the height of the water necessary for irrigating
every part of the Nile valley. The announcement of the wefa was formerly
the signal for cutting the embankments of the irrigation-uanuls, and noisy
popular merry-makings still take place (about the middle of August) at
the Midiin Fumm eI-Khalig (p. 104). The rate of taxation was determined
in ancient times in accordance with the height of the inundation (comp.
p. 367), and even to this day there is a certain connection between these
two facts (comp. p. lxxii).

Adjoining the uilometer is a large mosque in the Turkish style
L110 admission). - To the N. of a smaller round kiosque on the E.
quay-wall is a modern nilomcter, to which a tlight of stops de-
scends. - The S. end of the island commands a tine view of the
Nile, with Gizeh to the right, the pyramids in the background, and
Old Cairo ou the left, with its imposing quay.

In a garden near the N. end of the island (ca. 5min. to the S. of the
bridge El-Malek etrtSlel.s, p. 104) stands the wonder-working tree of the
saint Maatlilra, a huge nebly4ree, hung with innumerable little flags and
raga. According to a popular superstition the patient must thus offer to
tho saint the cloth which enveloped the affected limb, pluck oO' two leaves,
and tie them on the affected part with another cloth.
