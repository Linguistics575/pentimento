C IV. ANCIENT HISTORY.

v. DYNASTY (2750-2625 13.0.).

Egypt now reached the zenith of her civilization; art, in partie-
ular, attained a perfection never again reached. The pyramids of
the kings are mostly near Abusir o. 141), where special sanctuaries
were built also for the smr-god Re.

Nuserré built the sanctuary of Abu Guréb (p. 140) and the pyr-
amid and mortuary temple at Abusir (p. 141).

Sehuré, whose pyramid and mortuary temple are at Abueir (p.141),
carried on wars against the Libyans and Asiatios.

Onnos (Unis), the last king of the 5th Dyn., built his pyramid near
Sal.rlptra (p. 165). After his death internal dissensions seem to
have broken out, resulting in the accession of a new dynasty.

VI. DYNASTY (ca. 2625-2475 B.CO.

Under this dynasty the power of the kings was more limited,
and the small principalities recovered some of their independence. I
Far-reaehtng commercial relations were entered into with the Upper
Nile, Punt (the S. coast of the Red Sea), Syria, etc.

Towards the end of the 6th Dyn. the monarchy fell and civil
strife broke out. While the successors of the 6th Dyn. ( VIII. Dynasty)
may have maintained themselves at Memphis, a new race of in-
dependent kings established themselves at Heracleopolis (IX.
' AC. Dynasties) and for a time ruled the whole of Egypt. On the
other hand the chief power in the S. was seized by Theban princes
(XI. Dynasty), most of whom were named Mentnhotep. The mortu-
ary temple of two of these has been found at Deir el-Bahri (p. 304).
Dependent on these sovereigns were the Theban sub-kings named
Entef (Enyotef), whose small tombs lay near Drah Abu'l Negga
(p. 283). The Mentuhoteps fi11ally overthrew the kings of Heraeleo-
polis and gradually succeeded in reuniting the whole country. The
first ruler over reunited Egypt was Amenemhét f., with whom begins -

4. The Middle Empire (20004680 B.C.).
'XII. DYNASTY (2000-1788 13.0.).

This was Egypt's most prosperous period, and an epoch of great
buildings. There is hardly a considerable town in Egypt without some
traces of the building activity of the kings of this dynasty. Literature
and art flourished. The kingdom was organized as ' feudal state.
Amenemhét I. restored peace; his tomb is the northern pyramid at

Lisht (p. 205).

pyramid at Lisht (p. 205).
