144 h'oule 7. MEMPHIS. Colossi.

This quarter, as well as the pyramid, was called Metv-nefru-Miei, i.e. 'The
beauty of King Mire (Phiops) remains', and this name (in the later ab-
breviated form Menfc, in Greek Memphis) was afterwards applied to the
whole city. Memphis attained its greatest prosperity under the monarchs
of the Ancient Empire, who resided here or in the vicinity (near Gizeh
and Abusir). Even under the Middle and New Empires, when Thebes
became the centre of Egypt and the Theban Amen the most revered
among the gods, Memphis appears to have retrograded but little. In the
time of the 20th Dyn. the temple of Ptah was still the largest in the
country but two. In the course of the contests fur the possession of
Egypt, which raged after the 22nd Dye, the city was captured by the
Ethiopian Piankhi and by the Assyrians.

Cambyses, the first monarch of the Persian dynasty, took Memphis by
storm after his victory at Pelusium (525 13.0.) over Psammetichos 111.; and
even after the foundation of Alexandria (331 B.C.) it appears to have re-
tained some importance. Under Augustus it was a large and populous
city, though its palaces, elevated on an eminence, lay mined and deserted.
Among the temples that still existed were those of Ptah, of Apis (p.147),
and of a female deity who was identified with the Aphrodite of the Greeks.
1n canscquence of the edict of Theodosius (379-395 A.D.; comp. p. cxii) the
temples and statues were destroyed, and under the later Byzantine mon-
arehs the heretical Monophysites (p. cxiii) seem to have been very numerous
here. Muliaul.cis, the leader of the Cppts, was established at Memphis
while negotiating with 'Amr ibn el-â€˜As, the general of Omar (p. M).
The Mohammedan conquerors transferred their residence to the right
bank of the Nile, opposite the northernmost part of Memphis, using the
well-hewn blocks, which had once composed the venerable palaces and
temples of the ancient city of Memes, for the construction of their palaces,
castles, and mosques at Cairo. But down to a late period the ruins of
Memphis excited the admiration of all visitors. Thus 'Abdella.tif (at the
end of the 12th cent.) assures us that even in his time the ruins contained a
profusion of wonders which bewildered the mind and haffleddeseriptiom -
After his time the rapidly dwindling ruins of Memphis are rarely mentioned.

The path continuing in the original direction Cw.) from the
fork (p. 143), and leading through the palm-grove to the village
of Jfit Rahhzeh, brings us to the *Colossal Statues of Ramses 11.,
which once marked the entrance to the temple. The first of these,
discovered in 1888, is made of granite and lies on its back on a
slight eminence. Its length is '20 ft., not including the crown, which
is 61/2 ft. long. The square hole in the head of the colossus was for
the insertion of the crown, which lies on the ground beside it. On
both shoulders, breast, girdle, and bracelet occurs the name of the
king; and on the pillar at the back is an inscription. On the left of
the statue is an incised relief of Princess Bent-Anat. - Beside the
statue stands a stele of Apries (p. cvi), in the rounded pedimeut
of Which appear Ptah and the falcon- headed Soker. - A little
farther on lies a gigantic Sphinx, excavated in 1912 and in an ex-
rellent state of preservation. It is made of alabaster and is, as far
as we know, the largest sphiux that has ever been transported, being
26 ft. long and 14 ft. high and weighing about 80 tons. It has no
inscriptions, but may be assigned to the 18th or 19th dynasty.
