In 973 Main took up his permanent residence in the new city of
Cairo. A new period of prosperity began under the Aiyubides.
Saladin endeavoured to unite the still separated cities of Cairo and
Fustét by means of a common wall, which, however, was never
finished, and in 1179 he founded the citadel. Under his luxurious
and extravagant successors Cairo was greatly extended and mag-
nifieently embellished, and in the 14th cent. it reached its zenith.
At that period, however, it was fearfully devastated by the plague,
as it had been on former occasions (6.9. in 1065 and in 1295] and
was also several times subsequently (especially in 1492, when
about 12,000 people are said to have been carried off by it in one
day). The town suffered severely in other ways also, and indeed its
whole history, so far as recorded, like that of the sultans and the
Mamelukes themselves, seems to have presented an almost con-.
tinuous succession of revolutions, rapine, and bloodshed. As most
of the Mamelnke sultans who resided in the citadel died a violent
Math, so the reign of almost every new potentate began with bitter
and sanguinary contests among the emirs for the offiee of vizier,
while but few reigns were undisturbed by insurrections in the
capital. During the third regime of En-N0pir (1293-1340), who had
been twice deposed and as often reeovered his throne, a persecution
of the Christians took place at Cairo. The churches which had been
built in the capital and elsewhere were closed or demolished,
while the Christians themselves were so ill-treated and oppressed,
especially in the reign of Sultan S&Zih (i35i-54j, that many of them
are said to have embraced Islamism. In 1366 and 1367, in the reign
of Sultan 8luOtin, sanguinary eonflicts took place in the streets of
Cairo between hostile parties of Mamelukes, and in 1377 Sha'ban
himself was tortured and strangled in the eitadel. Even greater
disorders attended the dethronement of Sultan Barl.cN.t, (1389), when
the wildest anarchy prevailed at Cairo, the convicts escaped from
their prisons, and in cenoert with the populace plundered the houses
of the emirs and the public magazines. The following year another
rebellion among the Mamelukes restored PrarlirUr to the throne.
Soarcely, however, had he closed his eyes and been succeeded by
Farag [1399), when the Mamelukes again revolted and renewed 00n-
flicts took place for possession of the citadel, during which the city
was partly plundered. Similar scenes were repeated on almost every
change of government. The turbulence of the Mamelukcs, who
were always treated with too much consideration by the Sultans,
became more and more unbearable; they robbed the people in the
markets and assaulted citizens in the pyblie streets.

On Jan. 20th, 1517, the Osman sultan Selim 1., after having
gained a victory in the neighbourhood of IIeliopolis (p. 120), ell-.
