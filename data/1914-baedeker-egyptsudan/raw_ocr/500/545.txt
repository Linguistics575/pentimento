Behind the temple of Mut lies a Sacred Lake. Farther to the W.

are the remains of a small TEMPLE OF RAMSES III.

On the W. Exterior Wall are representations of scenes from the king‘s
campaigns: 1. Battle in Syria-, 2. Syrian captives brought before the king;
adjoining, heaps of hands cut off from the enemy are being counted;
3. Battle with the Libyans-, a. Triumphal procession of the king, and
train ofLihyan captives; 5. The king inspecting the captives; 6. Train of
captives; 7. Dedication of the spoihto the Theban triad.

EXCURSION TO 1iEmudh (3-4 hrs. there and back), strongly recom-
mended if time permits. The site is reached after I-I/ hr.‘s riding on
donkey-back. We take the road to Karnak (p. 262), diverge from it to the
E. at the Temple of Nut, and then follow the railway-embankment to-
wards the N. for we may traverse the village of Karnak and then go to
the E. towards the railway] Beyond kilom'ctre-stoms 667 we turn to the
E. and soon reach the village of Afedamiil, situated amid palms.

The Temple of Nedamist, dedicated to the war-god Mont, was situated
in the N. suburb of Thebes, called Meta. The erection ofthis temple dates
from the time of the Ptolemies. The W. approach'to the temple was formed
by a Pylon (now in ruins), which incorporated older blocks of the time
of Sethos I. and Ramses II. To the w. of that is a kind ofterraue, similar
to that at Karnak and formerly bearing two obelisks. On the pave-
ment are drawings of feet and demotic inscriptions left by visitors to
the temple. Five columns of the Inner Chambers are still standing. In
the middle are two columns with calyx-capitals (of several pieces), between
which is a door. The other three are clustered papyrus-columns with
hud-capitals. There is also a red granite pillar, with Amenophis ll.
sacrificing to the faleou-headed Mont.

 

B. THE WEST BANK AT TIIEBES.

Donkeys and Carriages (p. 252) had better be ordered the night before
to be in readiness on the W. bank. - An early start should be made
Luncheon-baskets, etc., comp. p. 252. Close to the temple of Deir el-Bahri
lies Cook's rest-house (p. 299). Ferry-boats ply from the chief hotels at
Luxor to the w, bank (p. 252).

On the West Bank lay the Necropolis, or City of the Dead, and
also a large number oftemplesvr These latter, dating mostly from
the New Empire, were dedicated to Amon, the principal deity of
Thebes, and were used also in the worship of deceased kings. They
were adjoihed by dwellings for the priests, libraries, and sometimes
schools. In the vicinity were groves and lakes, besides granaries,
stables for the saeriileial animals, barracks for the guards, prisons,
etc. Close by lay the villages of the numerous workmen who found
employment in connection with the cemeteries: masons, painters,
builders, and above all embalmers, to whose care the bodies were
committed. Gradually a whole city arose here, like the quarters beside
the tombs of the Mamelukes at Cairo. Under the New Empire its
management was placed in the hands of a special official, known as
'prineo of the West and general of the soldiers of the Ntyeropolis'.

i The longer axes of these temples lie from S.E. to N.W., but in con-
formity with the system mentioned in the foot-note to p. 264 the text speaks
of them " if they lay from N. to S
