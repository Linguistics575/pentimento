LAST JUDGMENT. The doctrine of the resurrection has been highly
elaborated in the Koran and subsequent tradition-, but its main features
have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians; as has also the appear-
ance of Antichrist, and the part to he played by Christ at the Last Day.
On that day Christ will establish Isltun as the religion of the world.
Before him will re-appear the Mahdi, the 'well-directed one', the twelfth
Imam (p. xcii), who will establish the Islamic Ideal empire and will render
Islamic law supreme. The Last Judgment will begin on the appearance
of Christ. The first trumpet-blast of the angel Asrdfil will kill every
living being; a second will awaken the dead. Then follows the Judgment;
the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge of a hair's breadth, while the
wicked fall from the bridge into the abyss ofhell. At the Judgment every
man is judged according to the books of the recording angels (p.1xxxvii).
The hook is placed in the right hand of the good, but is bound in the
left hand of the wicked behind their backs. The scales in which good
and evil deeds are weighed play an important part in deciding the soul's
fate, and the doctrine of the efficacy of works is carried so far that it is
believed works of supererogatiOn may be placed to the credit of other
believers. Hell, as well as heaven, has different grades; and Islam as-
Sumes the existence also of a purgatory, from which release is possible.
Paradise is depicted by Mohammed as a place of entirely material delights.

Mysticism, the third great branch. of religious thought under
Islim, aims at an immediate union with the divine on the basis of
emotion, in coutradistinction to the hair-splitting of the dogmatists
and to the doctrine of the tsffieaey of works taught by the moralists.
The mystics seek their end in two ways. On the one hand they
bridge over the vast gulf between God and humanity by the con-
ception of mediators with God, viz. Saints, who with reference to
an expression in the Koran are known as 'those who stand near
God' (Auliyci, sing. Wait); and 011 the other hand, by emotional
exercises in company, they aim at producing an ecstatic exaltation
of mind, Le. the immediate blending of their own individuality
with that of the Deity. The latter is the explanation of the practices
of the orders of dervishes o. xci]. In the worship of saints, which
centres principally at tombs and ancient holy sites, We trace the
same popular polytheistic tendencies as appear in Christianity,
connected with the primitive traditions of the heroic age. A not
unwarrantable attempt has been made to deduce the fundamental
forms of early Semitic religious conceptions from the practices
current to-day in the Islamic saint-worship. The recognition of
saints became possible in Islam when Mohammed himself was
exalted above the infirmities of humanity. The tomb of Moham-
med at Medina and that of his grandson Hoseiu at Kerbeli be-
came particularly famous, and every little town soon boasted ofthe
tomb of its particular saint. In many of the villages the traveller
will observe small dome-covered buildings with grated windows.
These are saints' tombs and are called 'lilheikhi (comp. p. clxxxiii).
'Sheikh' also means a chief or old man. Shreds of cloth are often
seen suspended from the gratings of these tombs, or on certain trees
