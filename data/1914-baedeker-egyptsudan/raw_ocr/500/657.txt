Eastern Desert. BERENIRE. 25. Route. 377

4th Day. Descent into the Wddi Beizall, with its acacias. Rude
designs and graftiti on the rocks. We cross the Wddi Ijigelig. On the
rocks to the right are rude representations of giraCes, camels, and ihexes.
Remains of an ancient station named Sammut, with a cistern and cham-
hers, occur in the wiidi of the same name. We next proceed through
the broad green It'ddi Moiitteh (Bir Muiilih) towards the Gebel Mtrgef
(3935 ft.), near which is a well of excellent water.

5th Day. We pass several groups of rude stone huts, probably built
by miners. View of Gehel Ztlbara (see below). On a rock to the right
is a representation of an Egyptian bark, with sails and ears. Farther on
is another ruined station.

6th Day. Ancient station of Ed-Dueig. Adjacent is another smaller
building. About 3 hrs. farther on WE cross the watershed between the
Nile and the Red Sea. Two more cisterns, within a semicircular enclosure.
We. pass the granite hill of Abu Had (2075 ft.).

7th Day. Descent into the midi Gemdt. Station in the form of a
right-angled triangle, with two cisterns. Lateral valley diverging towards
the emerald mines (see below). To the right rises the Gebel Abya4.

8th Day. We proceed through the H'ddi Ahym.1 and the dei Higelig,
leaving the Gebel Ilamrila (6-190 ft.) to the right; then along the Wtidi Ramit.
0:1 a height in the Wddil.htyhs are some sheikhs' graves, in a circular form.

9th Day. Seven other circular tombs; the well of El-Haratra lies to the
right; old structure of a large cistern in the Wddi el-21asir. Through the
ll'ddi Amvugttm to the midi themi, which descends from the mountain
of that name, crosses Our route, and proceeds in windings to the Red
Sea. The last station is Abu Greia (see remark at p. 376), comprising
several buildings, the largest of which contains the remains of rooms.
Another rectangular building seems to have been a reservoir for water.

10th Day. Arrival at Sl'kket Bender, near the temple of Berenike.

The town of Berenike (Berenice), situated in the same latitude as
Assuiin, was founded in 275 B.C. by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who revived
the commerce of the Red Sea hy the establishment of several new ports.
The town, which was named hy Ptolemy after his mother, was the ter-
minus of the main desert-routes from Egypt, and for 400 or 500 years was
the entrep6t of a marine commerce carried on mainly with Arabia and
India. The ruins, still extant, surround the Temple, which faces the
E.N.E. In front is a forecourt 281/2 ft. in width and 12 ft. in depth,
which was adjoined by the temple proper (inner length 31 ft.), com-
prising two rows of apartments. The representation on the left outside
wall shows an emperor appearing before a goddess, who seems to be,
from the legend, the tutelary deity of the green (Le. emerald) mine.

The Emerald Mines, I/e" to the N. of Bercnike, were worked by the
Arabs down to the year 760 of the Hegira (1370 A.D.), after which they were
abandoned. Mohammed Ali made an unavailing attempt to re-open them.
They lie partly in the Wadi Sakeit and partly on the Gebel Zdbara (4465 ft.),
ll M. to the RE. They are best visited from Edfu (p. 343), but may,
like Berenike, he approached hy following the coast of the Arabian Gulf
from Eoseir. The first route diverges from the road to Berenike in the
Wadi Gemtil (see above). To the S. ofthe Gehel Ziihara lies the village of
Sakeit (Stkait), with numerous huts of miners and a small rock-hewn
temple, with a few Greek inscriptions.

Farther to the N. (25Â° 30' N. lat.), in the dei Umbdrek, lie the ancient
gold-mines of Umm Rus, reopened by the Um Rus Gold Nines of Egypt,
a British company. Hundreds of labourers' huts are still visible here
besides the ruins of' about 300 houses dating from a Grareo-Roman settle-
ment (called by Ptolemy Nechesia). A light railway leads from Umm Bus
to (41/2 M.) the small port of Mina Umbdrek 0r Alarm Imbarak, on the
Red Sea.

Travellers going on from Abu Shir el-Kibli, Koseir, or Berenike to
Sinai (comp. Baedeker's Palestine and Syria) or Arabia Cross the Red Sea
to One of the ports 0n the E. coast, where Ttfr (Tor,- p. 321), Minat el-Wed
(El-Wedj), I'anbo (i'ambo) el-Barr, and Jidda (Jeddah; p.424) are called at
every fortnight by the Khedivial Mail Line.
