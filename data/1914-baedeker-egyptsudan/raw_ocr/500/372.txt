observe at our feet a huge block of black granite (Pl. tf), which
once formed the lid of a sarcophagus. Beyond it we turn to the
left and after ten paces we reach
an enormous granite sarcophagus
(Pl. Q, which nearly fills the
passage. The lid and the Sart10-
phagus, which belong to each other,
were probably stopped here on
their way to the vault for which
they were destined, in consequence
of the overthrow of the worship of
Apis. Near the end of this passage
we turn to the left (8.) into another,
which leads us to the -
PRINCIPAL PASSAGE (PLATE),
running parallel with the first, from
Il. to W., and penetrating the solid
rock. This passage is flanked with
stile-chambers, about 26 ft. in
height, the pavements and vaulted
ceilings of which are constructed
of excellent Mokattam stone.
Twenty-four of the chambers still
contain huge sareopl1agi in which
the Apis mummies were ileposit-.
ed. These monster coffins each
consist of a single block of black
or red polished granite or of
limestone, and average 13 ft. in
length, 7 ft. in width, and 11ft.
in height, and 110 less than 65 tons
in weight. The covers, five of
which are composed of separate
pieces of stone cemented together,
have in many instances been push-
ed on one side. All the sareophagi,
"Uaw, when discovered by Mariette, had
been emptied of their contents.
with the exception of two, which still contained a number of
trinkets. Only a few of the sarcophagi bear inscriptions; one
bears the name of Amasis, another that of Cambyses, and a third
that of Khabbash, leader of the Egyptians against the Persians
(p. cvi). The finest is the last sarcophagus on the right side [Pl.e),
to which a flight of steps descends. It consists of black and finely
polished granite and is covered with inscriptions and door-shaped
ornaments.
Gear the E. end of the principal passage we reach a side-passage
