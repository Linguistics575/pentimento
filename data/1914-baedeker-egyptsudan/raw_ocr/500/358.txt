140 Route 6. ABU GUHKB.

smaller stone pyramid to the S.W. has been entirely demolished.
The plateau commands a firurview of the Nile valley and of the
gorges of the Libyan desert. - There is a third pyramid, built of
brick, in the plain to the N. of the village of Atm Rotsh. The brick
superstructure, which was 55 ft. in height when Lepsins saw it in
1842, has since been entirely demolished, and nothing now remains
but the roek-eore with the tomh-chamher.

The EXCURSION TO THE Pnumms " Anvein, to the S. of Gizeh,
is interesting. We take the electric tramway to the MenaUouse Hotel
(p. 123) and proceed thence in IU-o, hrs. on a donkey (there and
back 10 pias.), on a camel, or in a desert-carriage (see p.139). Or a ,
donkey may be taken direct from Cairo in 2% hrs., vit the villages ,
of Gizeh, Tirsa, and Shobrement; or the excursion may be combined g
with that to Sakhara (p. 142; oornp. Plan, p. 143). ,

Quitting the Mena House Hotel we ride along the verge of the '
desert, leaving the Pyramids of Gizeh on the right. To the left is the ,
cultivated country, with several villages. After about 1 hr. we have 1
the large cemetery of the village of Zdwiyet Alia Musatlim on our ,
right. A low mound of rubbish on the summit of the desert-plateau
marks the site of the stone pyramid of Zdwiyet el-'Ary6m. In the
desert, about 3/4 M. to the N.W., lies a second and Unfinished Pyra-
mid, known as ‘Shugl Isk,enrler', which seems to have been begun
by King, Nehka (3rd Dyn.). This has been excavated by Barsanti,
and plainly shows the sloping passage cut in the rock and leading
to a large square shaft, in which the tomb-ohamber was to have been
made. The foundation and pavement of the last were completed
(both of red granite), and in it stands the tisely-worked red granite
sarcophagus of the king, which was to have been half- embedded
in the pavement. - In 1% hr. we reach the rubbish heaps of Abu
Gurhb. [Another, somewhat longer route leads vit the village of
Ztoriyet Abu Musallim, with a picturesque sheikh's tomb.)

Aba Gurétb, formerly called also the Pyramid of Righa, was ex-
plored in 1898-1901, on behalf of the Berlin Museum, by Drs. Bor-
chardt and Sehzefer. The building was a Sanctuary of the Sun
God, erected by King Nuserré (5th Dyn.) on the occasion of the
jubilee of his accession.

The sanctuary stands upon a low, artificially altered hill and consists of
an uncovered court, 330 ft. long by 250 ft. broad, with its entrance on the
E. side, while in the posterior (W.) and main part of it rose the large
Obelisk of the Sun. From the entrance-gate a (once) covered passage, or-
namented with fine reliefs, led to the left along the E. and S. sides of the
court, and then turned to the right wo to reach the obeliek. The obelisk
itself has totally vanished, but part of the platform of masonry on which
it stood is still extant; and the top of this, reached by an internal stair-
case, commands a tine view. In the front half of the court was the place
for slaughtering the sacrificial bulls; the channels or gutters in the pave-

ment empty themselves into nine alabaster basins (originally ten). In front
of the platform of the obelisk stands the Altar, t9 ft. long, 18 ft. broad,
