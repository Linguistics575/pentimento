Irrigation. POLITICAL NOTES. lxxi

most severety tried, although the homogeneous soil of the valley of
the Nile requires less careful tilling and ploughing than ours. As
the dung of the domestic animals is used as fuel throughout Egypt,
where wood is very scarce, while that of the numerous pigeons (comp.
p. 235) is mainly used for horticultural purposes, resource must be
had to other manures. One of these is afforded by the ruins of an-
eient towns, whieh were once built of unbaked clay, but now eon-
sist of mounds of earth,reeognizah1e only as masses of ruins by the
fragments of pottery they contain. Out of these mounds, Which
conceal the rubbish of thousands of years, is dug a kind of earth,
known as Sabakh, sometimes containing as much as 12 per cent of
nitrate of soda, potash, and chloride of soda. The valuable nitrates,
however, usually form a very small proportion. So largely have
these ancient sites been worked of late years, since intensive cul-
tivation began, that they will be exhausted at no very distant date.
So long as the inundation deposited a thick deposit of fresh mud
on the basin-lands every year, and a single crop was raised off the
greater part of the area, the land could go on producing crops imhr-
finitely, but now that most of the land is irrigated throughout the
year a very small amount of the mud is deposited, while two or more
crops are raised annually. To meet this, manuring in a much more
systematic manner than hitherto has now become necessary, but as
yet few eultivators have fully realized this.

2. IRRIGATION. As a consequence of the works described on
p. lxvi, the whole ongypt from Assitt to the Mediterranean, with
the exception of a strip oflanrl along; the edge of the Western Desert
and the right bank of the Nile above Cairo, has had its old system
of flood-irrigation, Le. a single watering by the annual inundation,
replaced by a perennial supply furnished by innumerable canals
and watercourses. 111 the inundation season (p. lxiv] the sluiee-gates
of the dams are Open and the red-brown flood rushes through them
towards the plains of Egypt. When the irrigation-basins are filled
up to a suffi0ient level, the water is left in them for about 40 days,
to deposit its suspended mud and to soak the ground thoroughly.
The perennially irrigated lands of the provinces of Middle Egypt
and the Delta receive only so much water as the standing crops
require, since these districts cannot be inundated. They, therefore,
under the present intensive cultivation receive a very much smaller
amount of mud from the flood-water than the land which has basin-
irrigation, and this has to be compensated by extensive manuring.

Briefly stated, the annual routine after the end of the inundation
is as follows. In November, when the Nile is falling and the whole
country is amply supplied, the sluiee-gates of the Assuan Dam are
gradually closed, so as to fill the reservoir slowly. This is usually
aeeomplished about the end of January. The gates of the Esneh,
Assitt, and Delta barrages are similarly manipulated so as to main-
tain the Iuwr0ssary depth of water in the supply-eanals. In April the
