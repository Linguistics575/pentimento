(391 AJL; see p. 15). The present name of the pillar is due to
the mediaeval belief that it marked the tomb of Pompey the Great. -
To the N. of the pillar is an ancient water-basin, io the S. are two
sphinxes of red granite.

About 55 yds. to the w. of Pompey‘s Pillar 'are the 'Subterranean
Passages of the Serapeum (p. tr, of little interest). We descend by a
tlight of wooden steps into an open court, from the N. and S. corners of
which long passages are cut into the rack, with small niches of un-
