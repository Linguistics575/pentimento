B. UPPER FLOOR.

As extensive alterations are to take place in the upper floor during
the next few years, many rooms are for the time being re-arranged or
closed; our description, therefore, can in many cases make no claim to
accuracy.

The upper floor contains ehiefly the smaller antiquities, the
mummies, the gold ornaments, and the objects found in the Tombs
of the Kings at Thebes. We begin with the R. wing of the -

PRINCIPAL GALLERY (Galerie dulonneur), wh ere are exhibited the
's,offiug and mummies of the priests of Amen and their families,
which were discovered at Deir e1-Bahri(p. 305) in 1891. These date
from the period of the 21st and Q‘lnd Dynasties. Each corpse had
an outer andpn inner wooden coffin, both in the shape of a mummy
and covered with yellow varnish. The arms are crossed over the
breast, the men having their fists clenched while the hands of
the women are open. The women wear round earrings. The mummy
was generally enveloped in a kind of cover (cartonnage) forming a
fnll-length representation of the deceased. In many cases old
sarcophagi (19th and 20th Dyn.) have been used, and the original
names replaced by new ones.

In the E. half of the gallery: "2080. Wooden war-chariot of
Thutmosis IV., with beautiful reliefs emhossed in linen covered
with plaster, found in 1003 in the king's tomb at Thebes (p. 298).
Adjacent is the reproduction of a war-chariot, the original of which
is in the Archaeological Museum at Florence. In the middle: Mum-
mies of the sacred rams of Elephantine (p. 358), with gold masks.

ies along the S. front of the bnili1ing are busts of eminent Egyptolo-
gists. In the E. SMALL GALLERY (to the left) is the Collection of
