being tethered to pegs; in the two folloxxiug rows cattle are
brought for inspection (note the lame herdsmau leading a hull with
a neek-ornameut); in thelowest row, poultry. On the left Ptahhotep
is shown 'iumtemplatir1g, all the pleasant diversions that take place
throughout the country'; in the top row a herd of cattle is being
driven through a marsh, and men are engaged in plucking papyrus
plants, tying them in bundles, and carrying them away; in the
second row are boys playing; the vintage is represented in the
third, with vines upon trellises, watered by a servant, while others
gather the grapes and tread them in the wine-press or crush them
in sacks; the fourth and fifth rows are devoted to animal life and
hunting in the desert; in the sixth are men labouring in the marsh,
cleaning tish, and making ropes and papyrus boats; in the seventh
row are fowlers with nets and other men placing, the captured birds
in boxes and bearing them away; in the lowest row are peasants in
boats upon the Nile, with plants and fishes; some of the peasants
are fighting. In the boat to the left appears Enkh-en-l'tah, sculptor-
in-chief, receiving a drink from a boy; this is doubtless the artist
who designed the reliefs and has here immortalized himself.

We now return to the Pillared Hall and pass through a. door in
the W. wall into the CHAPEL OF Fhimrr-moTm, (D), a son of Ptah-
hotep. To the right and left are representations of the deceased at
a banquet, with servants bringing him sacrificial gifts. On the W.
wall is a false door, with a large table of offerings.

From the masitaba of Ptahhotep a path leads to the S.E. to
(1/3 M.) the ''Pyramid of King Onnos or Unis (p. c), which may
easily be climbed without assistance. The view from the top repays
the exertion: to the N. are the Pyramids of Ahugir and Gizeh; to the
s., those of Sal.tlptra and Dahshtr; and to the E., the Step Pyramid
and the palm-groves and fields of Salilpira and Mit Rahineh.

INTERIOR. The pyramid was opened in 1881 and is accessible to visit-
ors (apply to the keeper; admission tickets, see p.142). A sloping Passage,
the mouth of which was formerly covered by the pavement, runs from
the middle of the N. side b, an Antechamber, beyond which a straight
Corridor, originally blocked at the farther end by three trap-doors, leads
to a Central Chamber, with the Tomb Chamber on the right OV.) and another
Small Room on the left (E.). The last, which was originally closed by a
slab of stone, has a flat roof and three recesses, while the central chamber
and the tomb-chamher have pointed roofs and walls covered with inscrip-
tions, the so-called pyramid-texts. These hieroglyphics are cut into the
stone and filled with blue pigment. They relate to the life Leyond the
tomb and are the oldest religious Egyptian texts known. The granite sarco-
phagus of the king stands in the tomh-ehamhcr, close to the w. wall. To
the right and left are false doors of alabaster,

The small Mortuary Temple, which stood on the E. side of the
pyramid, has recently been excavated by the Egyptian Service des
Antiquittis, but is much dilapidated. 1t eoutained a court with
pahn-eolumus (see p. 83), of which fragments lie scattered about. At
the foot of the pyramid, probably on the site of the inner sanctuary,
are some vestiges of a false door of granite.
