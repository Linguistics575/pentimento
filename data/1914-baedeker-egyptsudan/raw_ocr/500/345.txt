travellers. G. Maspero opened the small pyramids of Sahhéra. in 1880
and discovered important inscriptions. W. M. Flinders Petrie gubieeted
the Pyramids of Gizeh to a new and thorough investigation in 1 1-82.
The Pyramids of Dahshtir were examined in 1894-95 by De Morgan; those
of Lisht in 1895 by Gautier and Jéqnier; and those of Abu Roésh by the
Institut Francais in 1900-2. Excavations were carried on by German ex-
plorers at Abu Gurib in 1898-1901. A renewed examination of the pyra-
mids and tombs of Sa1piitra was undertaken by the Egyptian Service des
Antiguités in 1900. The German Oriental Society (Deutsche Orientgesellschaft)
carried on excavations at Abugir in 1902-8, while Germans and Americans
tand latterly also Austrians) have been exploring the Necropolis of Gizeh
since 1903. The excavation of the Valley or Granite Temple of Khephren
was accomplished by the German Von Sieglin expedition in 1909-10.

The pyramids of Gizeh stand upon a plateau, which extends
about 1000 yds. from E. to W. and about 1300 yds. from N. to s.,
the E. and N. margins being precipitous at places. The pyramids
are built exactly facing the four cardinal points. The diagonal of the
largest pyramid from N.E. to S.W. is exactly in a line with the dia-
gonal of the second pyramid.
