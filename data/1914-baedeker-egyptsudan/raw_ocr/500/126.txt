III. MODERN HISTORY.
Turkish Domination after 1517.

The authority of the Osman sultans soon declined, and with
it that of their governors. The Egyptian pashas were now
obliged, before passing any new measure, to obtain the
consent of the 24 Mameluke Begs, or princes, who governed
the different provinces. These beys collected the taxes, "om-
manded the militia, and merely paid tribute to the Pasha.

rAli Bey, originally a slave, raised himself to the dignity
of an independent sultan of Egypt. He conquered Syria,
but died on the point of returning to Egypt, where his
son-in-law Mohammad Bey Abu Dahab (p. 58) had seized
the throne. After Dahab's death the beys -

mania and Ibrahim shared the supremacy, and rendered
themselves almost independent of Turkey.

The French Occupation.

Napoleon Bonaparte (pp. 30, 46, 183) arrived at Alexan-
dria, hoping to destroy the British trade in the Mediter-
ranean, and, by occupying Egypt, to neutralize the power
of England in India.

Mohammed Ali and his Successors.

The retirement of the French was contemporary with the rise
of the star of Mohammed Ali, the ablest ruler that the East
has produced for a long time. Born at Kavala in Macedonia
in 1769, as the son of an agha of police, he was orphaned

a de facte caliphate, as according to the Sherpa (p. lxxxvi) the caliph must
be a descendant Of the 1.Orreishites, the Arab tribe to which Mohammed

and the earlier caliphs belonged.
do not recognize the caliphate (f the ()smans.

On this account many of the Sunnites
The Turkish court theo-

lngians declare that this is not ti neressary condition, but that, God makes
the final decision in the success with which he endows the caliph. The
Shiites have never recognized the Osw an caliphs as they are not descended
from Ali.
