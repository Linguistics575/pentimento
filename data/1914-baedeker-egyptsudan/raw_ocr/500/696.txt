that of his wife. Two rooms adjoining the sanctuary were ori-
ginally planned, and spaces for doors to these have been left free in
the rear wall of the Transverse Chamber.

On the smoothed face of the rocks both to the N. of the small
temple and to the S. of the great temple, are numerous *Memorial
Inscriptions and Niches,1n0st ofwhich date from the reign of Ramses II.

As we proceed to the S. from Abu Simbel we notice the village
of Baltdneh (Baltana) on the W. bank. On the E. bank, below
Abaldida (Aim Oda), a village belonging to Farril; (p.404), the hills
approach close to the stream. On one of these, the Gebel Addeh,
lies a small ROCK TEMPLE, founded in the reign of King Haremheh
and dedicated to Amon-Ré and Thout of Shmun. This temple .
was afterwards used as a Christian church. The ancient approach
has disappeared; a broken flight of steps leads up to the entrance.
The First Hall contains four papyrus - columns with bud-. capitals.
The architectural details have been painted over with Byzantine
ornamentation, and the ancient mural reliefs project from beneath
figures of Christian saints. This hall is adjoined by two side-
chambers and behind it is the sanctuary.

Among the reliefs on the walls of the Hall are the following. On the
left half of the Entrance Wall, Huremheb suckled by Anukis, beside whom
stands the ram-headed Khnum; on the right half of this wall is Harem-
heb before Thout. On the Ar. Wall, to the left of the door, the king he-
fore the ibis-headed Thout and four forms of the falcon-headed Horus
worshipped in Nubia; to the right of the door, Haremheb accompanied
by Seth and Horus. - 0n the S. Wall are Christian paintings of St. Epi-
machus and other saints on horseback and Coptic inscriptions. On the
ceiling are figures of Christ (with raised right hand) and an Apostle.

On an isolated rock to the (S. of the Gebel Addeh rise the ruins
of a Mediaeval, Fortress. In the valley are numerous domed brick
tombs, probably Christian. - Farther to the S., in the face of an
isolated cliff opposite the large island of Shataui (Shetawi), are
several Memorial Niches. One of these dates from the reign of King
Eye (18th Dyn.), who here prays to six gods. Another was con-
structed by Paser, governor of Ethiopia in the reign of King
Haremheb. 0n the walls we see Paser, praying to Amon-Re and
Re, and Paser's relatives before the deceased.

On the E. bank rise numerous isolated rocks, while the moun-
tains recede far from the fiver. - 11 M. Kusté‘t (Qostol; E. bank).
- 171/2 M. Adendcin (E. bank; steamboat station) is the last com-
mune belonging to Egypt. In the village are the remains of a
church, and there is another ruined church farther inland.

The following villages, on both banks, were placed under the
jurisdiction of the Anglo-Egyptian Stidin in 1899 (comp. p. 415).
