A few words may be added 011 the Scots, though seetarianism is
much less important in Islam than in other religions. Mohammedan
sects separate on a point of constitutional law, the question being
which of the early ealiphs were the legitimate successors of Moham-.
med. The Orthodox Party, which alone prevails in Egypt, recognizes
all the 'rightly directed' caliphs - Abu Bekr, Omar, '0thrntn,
andrAli. The Shiites (from &ita, party, i.e. the party of‘Ali) regard
'Ali and his sons Hasan and Hosein as the only legitimate oaliphs
and irntuns (i.e. leaders in prayer), the twelfth Cor seventh) of
whom is believed to be awaiting in concealment the day of restor-
ation. The EMregites recognize only Abu Bekr and Omar. All the
sects have their traditions, and when the Shiites are said to reject
the Sunna, the remark applies only to the orthodox Sunna. Their
Sunna has developed in the same manner as that of the Orthodox,
but along different lines. The same is true of all the Moslem sects.
Egypt has been under a Shiite regime only in the time of the
Fatimites, who recognized the seventh Imam. This dynasty called
themselves after Fatima, daughter of the Prophet and wife of 'Ali,
from whom they claimed descent. They professed a secret doctrine
which resulted in scepticism.
