Elephantine. ASSURN. 24. Route. 357

From the N. quarries we follow the just-mentioned causeway,
which first crosses the mountain (iine view), then descends into a
picturesque valley, and finally runs along on a level to (1/2 hr.) the
S. Quarry, which opens to the E., facing the desert. This also
contains rough-hewn blocks ready for removal. On a rock here
may be seen an inscription with the name of Amenophis m.,
though the name and figure of the stone-cutter who carved it have
been obliterated. Beside it two trough-shaped sarcophagi have been
begun (in the Ptolemaic or in the Roman period); and in the
vicinity are the unfinished eo1ossus of a king (covered, except the
feet, with sand), and a large quadrangular block, perhaps intended
for the shrine of a god. Farther on, near the railway, and towards
the top of the cliff, is a figure of Osiris (called Ramses by the
natives), about 20 ft. in height. This point commands a fine view
of the desert and in the direction of Philaa.

ff we follow the railway-line we reach the railway station of
Shelltl (p. 363) in 1/4 hr.

The verdant island of Elephantine, with its luxuriant palm
trees, attracts all travellers. The Arabs call it merely El-Gezirch,
i.e. 'island', or Gcziret Aseu/in. It is reached by boat (felilkzt) in a
few minutes from the landing-place (return fare 2 pias.) or by the
steam-launch of the Savoy Hotel (1 pias.; free to guests), and the
entire visit takes barely an hour. There are two villages on Elephan-
tine, whose inhabitants speak Nubian. Begging is common.

By far the most interesting object is the *Nilemeter (Mitcyés),
beside a strliiyeh on the E. side facing Assuén. After more than a
thousand years of neglect it was restored to use in 1870 in the
reign of Isrmi'il, as is recorded by French and Arabic inscriptions.
On the walls of the staircase are damaged Greek inscriptions of the
imperial epoch, giving the water-levels. The scales date from the
later imperial epoch, and the ells are marked in Greek (and also in
demotie) characters. The new scale is inscribed on marble tablets.
- Strabo's description is not yet antiquated: -

'The Nilometer is a well built of regular hewn stones, on the bank
of the Nile, in which is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the
maximum but also the minimum and average rise, for the water in the
well rises and falls with the stream. On the side of the well are marks,
measuring the height sufficient for the irrigation and the other water
levels. These are observed and published for general information. . . .
This is of importance to the peasants for the management of the water,
the embankménts, the canals, etc., and to the officials On account of the
taxes. For the higher the rise of water, the higher are the taxes.'

At the head of the stone staircase leading to the nilometsr, in a
pretty garden, is the Assuan Museum (open 9-4; adm. 5 pins). It
contains an interesting, collection of antiquities, mostly from Lower
Nubia, inrluding the mummy of a ram from the necropolis (p. 358)
