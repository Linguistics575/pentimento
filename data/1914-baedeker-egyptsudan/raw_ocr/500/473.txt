Assrirp 16. Route. 233

Assittt or Shit, the name of which still preserves the ancient
Egyptian Syout, enjoyed considerable importance, even in anti-
quity, eliicfly owing to its favourable situation in the midst of an ex-
tensive and fertile plain, 121/2 M. in width, between the Libyan and
the Arabian mountains, and at the beginning of' a great caravan route
leading to the oases in the Libyan desert (1t. '20) and thence to the
t'iydin. Assitit, however, seems to have been of little prominence
politically. The town was the capital of the Upper Sycamore Nome
and the chief seat of the worship of the god Wep-toawet, who was
represented as a wolf of the desert. This latter circumstance gave
rise to the Greek name Lyeopolis, or 'wolf town'. The modern
Assitht, which extends for about 3 M. from E. to W., is' the largest
town (39,442 inhab., exclusive of 466-1 in El-r):-') in Upper
Egypt, the capital of a province (768 sq.i\i.; pop., including the
oases of DÃ©khleh and Khirgeh, 903,335), and the residence of' the
Mtidir. Its manufacturing industry is not unimportant. Among the
chief products are flue red glazed pottery (bottles, pipe-bowls, etc.),
inlaid wood (tables, caskets, walking-stieks), ivory carvings, enn-
broidered leather goods, and the white and black tulle shawls, with
gold or silver embroidery, which are so often bought by European
ladies. Natron, soda. and grain are also among the principal exports.
The streets aml bazaars are full of' busy life, esper,ially on Tuesdays,
when the people of the neighbourhood iloek into the market. -
AssiM. is one of the chief seats of the American Presbyterian Mission,
which has in Egypt 273 stations, 107 schools, and 85 churches. Its
trainiug-eollege here (principal, Prof. ll. S. M r Gicnahan), attended
by 700 boys and 300 girls, deserves a visit.

Ptotintvs, the greatest of the Neo-Platonic philosophers (205-270 A. D.),
was born here, am] his system was not uninlluenced by the priestly
doctrines of his native town. From the beginning of the 4th cent. on-
wards Christianity was dominant in the town and neighbourhood. Pious
believers took refuge in the caves of the necropolis to live a life of
penitence apart from the world. One of these, John of Iycopolis, at the
end of the 4th cent., bore the reputation of asaint and even of a prophet.
The Roman emperor Theodosius sent an embassy to him to inquire the
outcome of the civil war. The anchorite foretold a complete but bloody

victory, and this prophecy was fulfilled in the victory of Theodosius over
Eugenius at Aquileia in 39-1A.D.

From the landing-place at El-linmra (p. 232) we skirt the
river upstream and then follow the main street diverging to the W.
at the mtuliriyeh. Beyond the (1/2 M.) railway station is the post-
office (left). A street to the right leads to the oldtown with its
picturesque bazaars, some of which are still covered. Here are the
College des Fr?'res, the American Mission IIosPital (p. 232), the
Wissa Charitable Secondary School for boys (600 pupils), and a
government school. The more prosperous native families live in
the quarter of Menshiyeh. - The main street, issuing from the
town 'in a S.W. direction, is continued by a causeway leading
through cultivated land and across the Sohtgiyoh Unnal to the -
