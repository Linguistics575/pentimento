which were much appreciated in El-Rib, in cuntradistinction to the rest
nf Egypt (comp. p. 390); the deceased and his wife at table, with their
relatives seated opposite. On the Right Wall, the funeral and accompany-
ing ceremonies. In the Rear Wall is a recess with a seated statue of the
deceased, now quite destroyed.

The last three tombs farther to the left (WO appear to date from
a period before the New Empire.

One of these belongs to a man and his wife Aa-xome, a lady attached
to the royal harem. Another (with a vaulted ceiling) belonged to B531
and his wife Sebek-nakht, who also was a lady of the harem. The third
consists of a vaulted chamber with a tastefully adorned ceiling and a room
with the shaft. It dates from the reign of Sebek-hotep H. (13th Dyn.).

A little to the W. of the hill of tombs stood a small Temple of
'I'hutmosis fll., now destroyed.

On the W. bank opposite El-kilo, about t/g M. from the river,
lies the village of Muisscit (Mo’isrit), and farther 011, about 3 M. from
the river, on the edge of the desert, rises the -

K6rn cl-Ahmar (‘lted Hill'), with the extensive ruins and tombs
of Hierakonpolis.

Hierakonpolis (Egypt. wVekhen) was One of the most ancient cities in
the country and in prehistoric times the capital, along with El-Kish, of
Upper Egypt. Its god was a Horus, to whom the falcon was sacred, whence
arose the Greek name Hierakonpolis ('city of falcons'). A little to the N.,
beyond a broad desert route, is a second mass of ruins, amongst Which
is a large Fort, probably dating from the Ancient Empire, with a low
outer wall and a higher inner wall of unhurnt bricks. On the E. side is
the gate. In the adjoining cultivated land lay the Temple of Nekheu, in
which Quibell discovered in 1897-98 some important sculptures of the
period of the earliest kings, besides others of later date, including the
copper statue of I’hiops I. mentioned on p. 83. - To the w. is a, hill
with tombs of the Ancient and Middle Empires, one without inscriptions
and two with designs and inscriptions upon stucco. - About 1/4 hr. farther
to the IV., also on the hill of K6111 eI-Ahmar, are eight rock-tombs, dating
trout the beginning of the New Empire, of which only the first to the
right or N. (Thuti, of the time of Thutmosis I.) and the iirst to the left
or S. (Harmose, high-priest of Nekhen) repay a visit. The structure of
these tombs resembles that of the tombs at E1-Riib. At the inner end of
each is a recess with a statue of the deceased and his wife. In the tomb
of lIarmose dancing-girls are painted upon stucco.

Beyond El-31alrtmid the RAILWAY traverses the desert. In the
distance to the right the pylon-towers of Edfu come into sight.

66 M. Edfu. The town and temple lie on the W. bank (p. 343).
Visitors ferry across the river in small boats in 1hhr. (2 pias.) from
beside the station and are met by donkeys on the opposite bank,
though the temple is within f 2 hr.'s walk.

Beyond (75 M.) Es-Sirttq the line hugs the river for some time,
passing below the rocks that are crowned by the ruins of a late-
llyzantine fortress Cp. 348). - 841/2 M. Sihreh (Seltrah, p. 348).

Near the village of El-Hésh (El-Iloch), beside the Gebet Abu
Shcga, 0n the W. bank, are a number of quarries. Fron, masons'
marks and Greek inscriptions in these we learn that sandstone
blocks were quarried here in the 11th year of Autoninus Pius
ttdo All) for a temple of Apollo (i.e. Horus, perhaps at Edfi).
