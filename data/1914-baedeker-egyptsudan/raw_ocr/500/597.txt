(Pl. IO the king leads before Amen and Nut three rows of prison-
ers, representing the conquered in this campaign. These have
beardless faces and wear curious caps adorned with feathers; their
pointed aprons, decorated with tassels, differ from those of the
Egyptians. The inscription describes them as belonging to the tribes
of the Danauna and Peleste (Philistines").

The granite gateway of the second pylon, which is approached
by an inclined plane, admits us to the Second Court, which is 125 ft.
deep and 138 ft. broad. In the Christian period it was converted
into a church, the remains of which have been Neared away. This
court is almost an exact reproduction of the second court of the
Ramesseum, even to part of the rtylief-embellishments; but it is in
mueh better preservation. On all four sides are colonnades. On the
N. and S. these are supported by columns with bud-capitals; on the
E. are square pillars with Osiris-statues, and on the W. is a terrace
(pronnosj with eightUsiris-piliars in front and eight columns behind.
()n the columns and pillars the king is shown sacrificing to the gods.

The reliefs 0n the back-walls of tho coionnades illustrate events
in the life of Ramses, some showing great festivals in which he took
part, others the warlike deeds of himself or his army. - N. AND
N.E. COLONNADES. In the upper row are *Scenes from the Great
Festival of the God Min, which was celebrated also as a coronation
festival, as we have seen in the Ramesseum (p. 307). First (Pl. 1)
appears the Pharaoh, borne from his palace by his sons (names
wanting) on a richly-decorated litter with a canopy. He is followed
by numerous pourtiers, while he is preceded by priests carrying
censers, a priest who recites, and a troop of soldiers, each of whom
wears two feathers on his head. The trumpeter and drummer in
the upper TOW, and the ostanet-players in the lower row, shoulti
be noticed. In the next scene (PL?) the king is shown sacrificing
and offering incense before the, image of Min. The following scene
(Pl. 3), continued on the E.wa1i,exhibits the sacred procession. The
image ofMin is borne on a litter by priests,while fan-bearers walk
by the side and priests carrying the sacred shrines follow. In front
marches the king, who in turn is preceded by a white bull (the
sacred animal of Min), the queen, and a long procession of priests
carrying standards, temple utensils, and images of the king and his
ancestors. To the right is the king awaiting the procession, with
two emblems in front of him. Priests let four birds escape (comp.
p. 307). Farther to the right (Pl. 4) the Pharaoh cuts with his sickle
the sheaf of corn handed to him by a priest (as in the Ramesseum,
p. 307). Behind him stands the reciting priest, who intones a hymn
to Min, while another priest presents the sheaf to the god. The
1l11t)er1 (above) also is present at this ceremony. The white bull again
appears; in front of the king, and beneath is a series ofimages ofthe
royal ancestors. Finally (Pl. 5) the king is shown oiTering incense
to the god Min, who stands under a canopy.
