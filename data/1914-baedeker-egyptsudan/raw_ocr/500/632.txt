Aswan or Aswan Cor. Syme, Gopt. Satan), with 12,618 inhab.,
lies on the E. bank, partly on the plain and partly on a hill, in N.
lat. 2io 5'. The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports numerous
date-palms, the fruit of which enjoys a high reputation. This town
is the capital of the province othssuin, the southernmost of' Upper
Iâ€˜lgypt, which has an area of 168 sq. M. and a population of 232,813
and extends to the S. from Esneh to the boundary of the Anglo-
Egyptian St1dtn. It is the seat of the provincial authorities. The
once considerable trade in the products of the fihldin and Abyssinia
has greatly fallen off since the Mahdist revolt, but on the other
hand the export trade in senna (folia Sennas; comp. p. 356) has
greatly increased. The Nile here divides into several arms, sepa-
rated by granite rocks and islands, the largest of which is Elephan-
tine (p. 357). The horizon 0n the W. is bounded by the Libyan
hills, on the E. by the Arabian mountains. On account of its charm-
ing situation and its equable and dry climate Assutm is much visited
as a winter resort, especially from Nov. to Feb. or even later. The
constellation of the Southern Cross is visible here in Jan. about

(o, a.m. and in April about 10 p.111.

HISTORY. The district around the modern Assuiin, including the island
of Elephantine, bore in antiquity the name of Film, or 'Elephant Land',
probably because the Egyptians here first saw the African elephant. At
a later date that name was restricted to the island and town of Elephant-
ine. From the erection of the Pyramids to the Roman period the ancient
Egyptians found material for their great temples and statues in the quar-
ries of Yiibu (Syene), which yielded flne coloured granite, containing a
large proportion of translucent quartz and of yellow, brownish, pink, and
black mica. Curiously enough, however, the term 'syenite', which was
used by Pliny, is now applied by geologists to a different variety of stone,
containing a much larger proportion of hornblende. Strategically, YEbu
commanded the Nile cataracts and the waterways between Egypt and Nubia.
It was also the starting-point of the great caravan-routes leading to Nubia
and the SCu12n, along which passed the earliest commercial and military
expeditions of the Egyptians. The ancient capital of the province was
likewise named YEbu and lay on the S. side of the island (p, 358). The exis-
tence here of a Jewish military colony, With a temple of Jehovah, in the
6th and 5th cent. B.C. has been proved by the discovery of a large num-
her of Aramaic papyri in 1906-8 (now mostly in Berlin).

Another town, named Swinet, the Syene of the Greeks, was situated on
the E. bank of the Nile, but appears not to have attained any great im-
portance until a late period. Juvenal, the Latin satiric poet, who lived
at the beginning of the 2nd cent. of our era, was appointed prefect of
the garrison at Syene, or, in other words, was banished to the most remote
frontier of the empire, as a punishment for his biting attacks on the court.
A famous curiosity of ancient Syene was a well, into which the sun's rays
descended perpendicularly, casting n0 shadow, at midday during the summer-
