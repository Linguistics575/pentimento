VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART. elm

distinctly begun to decline, and it is not till we reach the works
of the 18th Dyn. (e.g. in the temples of Luxor and Deir el-Bahri,
and in some of the graves of Sheikh 'Abd el-Kurna) that we find
some approaeh to the old excellence. From this period on the
decline is steady, though a few graceful and attractive reliefs were
produced in the time of Sethos I. (c.g. in Abydos, p. 239). The
too lavish demands made upon artistic resource for the decoration
of the numerous new temples led, under Ramses IL, to a rough and
ready style of work, the defects of which were multiplied under
Merenptah. - In the SA'iTE PERIOD the works of the Ancient Empire
were again selected as models for sculptures in this branch of the
plastic art, though no attempt was made to rival the ancient masters
with actual copies. But all the same the reliefs of this period ofttyr a
pleasing contrast to those of the reign of Ramses IL, in their deli-
cate and exact execution, and in a certain elegance and aeharming
softness of form. - Art under the PTOLBMIES was at tirst content to
follow in the track of the S.aite artists; but it gradually grew more
and more crude, and the temple-Walls were overladen with rows of
tasteless reliefs, contrasting with the good taste shown by the ear-
lier artists in interspersing decorated with undeeorated surfaces.
The figures of men and gods in these became heavy and shapeless,
so that their features and limbs have a swollen appearance. Unfor-
tunately the reliefs of this late period of Egyptian art are the most
numerous and most conspicuous in Upper Egypt, and thus it is that
the traveller is inclined to assign to Egyptian sculpture a much
lower rank than even its mediocre productions deserve. -... All re-
liefs were painted, but many of them have now lost every trace of
colour. When Painting was used instead of sculpture (as,e.g., in the
tombs of the 18th Dyn. at Sheikh 'Abd el-liurroa, p. 309), it was so
either in order to save expense or because the available stone was
not suitable for carvings. That the same rules of drawing applied
to paintings as applied to reliefs need scarcely be stated.

It is difficult for the ordinary student to obtain a proper ap-
preciation of Egyptian reliefs and paintings, owing to the peeuliar
style of Drawing. This arose in the prehistoric age, but was re-
modelled at a very early period of Egyptian history, and it is easy
to recognize how in the course of time the means for representing
the phenomenal world were multiplied. Many forms of the earlier
period, however, were religiously adhered to. The characteristic
Egyptian drawing represents the human figure as a composition
of the various parts of the body drawn from different points of
view. The head is seen from the side, while the eyes are drawn from
the front. The shoulders are shown facing us, without foreshort-
ening, and the rest of the body and the feet and legs in profile.
The inconsistencies of this method were felt by the later Egyptian
artists, and the diffleulty was got over by treating the whole as in
three-quarter profile. Alongside of this normal type there gradually
