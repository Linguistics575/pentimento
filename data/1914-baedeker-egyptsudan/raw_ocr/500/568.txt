and some unimportant additions were made, without, however,
affecting the original plan. On the introduction of Christianity a
community of monks established themselves in the temple and
founded a convent, known to the Arabs as Deir el-Bayri, or the
'Northern convent'. The chambers of the temple were converted into
chapels and the 'heathen' representations on the walls were barbar-
ously defaced. -- Mariette made a few excavations here, but finally
in 1894-96 the entire temple was exhumed at the cost of the Egypt
Exploration Fund under the skilful directions of M. Eduard Naville.

It should be noted that Hatshepsnt in her capacity as ruler of Egypt
is uniformly represented with the traditional attributes of kingship, viz.
the short apron and the beard, though these, of course, are properly
appropriate to men only.

The temple was dedicated to Amon; but the goddess Hathor
and Anubis, god of the dead, also had chapels here, and several
chambers were devoted to the worship of the queen, who was buried
at Bibtn tyl-Mulhlr (p. 296), and to that of her parents. The build-
ing occupies three terraces, rising one above the other from the
level ground; these are connected with each other by inclined planes,
which divide the whole into a N. half, to the right, and a S. half,
to the left. At the W. side of each terrace is a raised colonnade. The
stages were cut out of the E. slope of the mountain, and support was
given to the outer and inner walls by means of blocks of the finest
sandstone. The chambers devoted to religious rites were likewise
cut out of the rock.

An Avenue of Sphinmcs led from the plain to the temple, ending
at the gateway (now almost totally destroyed) forming the entrance
to the temple-precincts. In front of the gate, in square enclosures
of masonry, stood two persea trees (Mimusops Schimperi), the stumps
of which are still extant.

We first enter the Lower Terrace. This is in a very dilapidated
condition, though it has lately been restored. Each COLONNADE con-
sisted of 22 columns arranged in a double row. The columns in
the back row were sixteen-sided, while the others were four-
sided in front and seven-sided behind. Little now remains of
the reliefs and inscriptions that once adorned the walls.

On the rear wall of the Ar. Colonnade, at Pl. a, are traces of the re-
presentation of a pond, on which water-fowl are being caught with nets.

Below the S. colonnade are holes hewn in the rock, which were
formerly fl11ed with Nile mud and used for plants. Remains of palms,
vines, and the like are Mill extant.

We now ascend the approach to the Central Terrace, 011 the S.
side of which we can best observe the careful workmanship of the
retaining walls, intended to obviate any movement of the soil. They
consist of finely polished blocks of limestone, with simple but l
