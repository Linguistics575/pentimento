is built within the still partly preserved girdle-wall of the ancient
Roman citadel of Babylon (p. 44). - To the right of the railway, at
the S E. angle of the citadel, stands the Coptic church E2-suo'altalta
(Pl. 0, 2; 'resting upon columns'), the oldest in Babylon and re-
cently restored. Beyond a vestibule we enter a garden and a court,
whence a broad flight of steps ascends to the church. At the top
are an anteroom and an Open court. We enter the double-aisled and
handsomely fitted up church through a colonnade. - Beyond the
angle, on the S. side of the citadel, is a massive Roman Gateway
with two projecting towers, in which fragments of early-Egyptian
masonry have been used (key from the porter of the Mo'allaka
church). - Just beyond the station the road leads past the Greek
Convent of St. George (Convent gree; P1.0,l,2), the circular domed
church of which rests on the foundations of a Roman tower Ca 0n
the Plan), to the Captic church of -

*Abu Sergeh (St. Sergius; Pl. C, i, 2), enclosed by a dense mass
of houses. This church is believed to have been built before the
Mohammedan conquest, but this can be true of the crypt only. Ae-.
cording to tradition the Virgin and Child after their flight to Egypt
spent a month in this crypt. The church is now being restored.

This church, which has suffered at various times from alterations
and additions, now partly removed, may be regarded as the original
model of the older Egyptian-Byzantine churches in which the Coptic
Christians now worship f. The basilica consists ofa nave and aisles,

+ Coptic Worship. On entering the church the members of the con-
gregation first pay their homage to a number of pictures of saints hanging
on the walls (the veneration of saints and ofthe Virgin being a prominent
feature of the Coptic system) and then kneel before the altar and kiss the
hand of the priest. They then take their stand (for there are no seats) in the
part of the church allotted to them, the feeble leaning on crutches which
they bring for the purpose, as the service often lasts for more than three
hours. The service begins with the reading or chanting of prayers and
passages from the Gospels, partly in the Coptic language and partly in
Arabic, in which the priest is assisted by a schoolmaster and a choir of
boys. During this performance the worshippers, with very few exceptions,
engage freely in conversation. After a time the burning ofincense begins.
The priest, swinging his censer, leaves the heikal and joins the cen-
gregatiOn, each member of which he blesses, placing his hand on their
heads. - The Celebration of the Eucharist is very frequent in the Coptic
churches, immediately following the ordinary service. - On January 19th,
the anniversary of the Baptism of Christ (‘id el-ghitds), men and boys
plunge into the large font or bath which is to be found in most Coptic
churches, the water having been first blessed by the priest. Or they per-
form the same ceremony in the Nile, into which they first pour some con-
secrated water. On the eve of this festival, as well as at Epiphany, 0n
Maundy Thursday, and on the festival of the Apostles, the priest washes
the feet of the whole of his congregation. - On Palm Sunday wreaths of
palm are blessed by the priest, which are then worn by the Copts under
their .tarMshes daring the whole of the following year as amulets against
every misfortune that can befall body or son]. - An external form to
which the Copts attach great weight is the observance of fasts and a Copt
who is negligent in this respect will rarely be met with. bi these oc-
casions all kinds of animal food, not excepting fat, eggs, butter, and
cheese, are prohibited. - Comp. Butler's '0optie Churches of Egypt' (188i).
