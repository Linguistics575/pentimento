372 Route 24. DAM OI? ASSURN.

vation is drawn off gradually from the accumulated stores in the
reservoir, which last until the river once more begins to rise.

To the W. of the dam is a Navigation Canal, by which the boats
are locked up and down stream. Itis 11/431. long and the difference
in level (75 ft.) is surmounted by four locks, each 230 ft. long and
3t ft. wide. The two upper gates of the locks are 63 ft. high, the
tlve others 49 ft., 30 ft., and M) ft. high.

The original plan for the two dams of Assu2u and Assitl.t (p. 232) was
worked out hy Sir William Willeoek, at the Fgyptian Ministry of Public
Works under the superintendcnce of Sir William Garstin, Under-Secretary
of State. The execution of the design, which was finally adopted on the ad-
vice of the late Sir Benjamin Baker (p. 232), was entrusted to the English
contractors Messrs. John Aird it? Co. The work was begun in the summer of
1898; the fonndation-stone (now commemorated by a bronze tablet) was laid
on Feb. 12th, 1899, by the Duke of Connaught; and 011 Dec. 10th, 1902, the
dam was formally declared complete in the presence of the Khedive, the
Duke and Duchess of Connaught, tnil Lord Cromer. The total cost ofthe
two dams amounted to SE 3,937,000. - The plan for the raising of the
dam at Assuiin was prepared by Sir Benjamin Baker. The new works, which
cost about SE 1,200,0t0, besides £E320,C00 spent on the expropriation
of the Nubian villages, were formally opened on Dee. 93rd, 1912, in pre-
sence of the Khedive and Lord Kitchener. - Comp. 'The Asiuitn Reservoir

The desert-routes between the Nile and the Red Sea were im-
portant in antiquity both for the trade with the seaports and the
land of Punt (p. 223) and for the gold-mines and valuable quarries
of' green breceia and several varieties of granite in the mountains
of the Arabian Desert. Keneh (p. 222) is now the usual starting-
place of the caravans, but in antiquity it was Kopitrs (Kuft; p.223).
