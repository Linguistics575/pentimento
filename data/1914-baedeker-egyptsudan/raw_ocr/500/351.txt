Third Pyramid. PYRAMJDS Ol? Gizsh. 6.Routc. 133

plan, is in the level surface in front of the Pyramid and was concealed
by the pavement (Pl. d); that of the other, which still forms the entrance
to the pyramid, is on the N. side of the Pyramid itself, and is now 38 ft.,
but formerly 49 ft., above the level of the ground(Pl. a). This Upper Passage,
which was lined with granite at the beginning, descends at an angle of
25o 55' for 105 ft. (Pl. a b) and then leads as a horizontal corridor (Pl. 6 g c)
to 'Belzoni's Chamber', which once contained the tomb of the deceased,
situated 3 ft. 10in. to the E. of the diagonal of the Pyramid. This cham-
ber is hewn in the rock and roofed with painted slabs of limestone,
glaced obliquely at the same angle as the sides of the pyramid. It is
21/2 ft. in height, 461/2 ft. in length from E. to Thr., and 161/3 ft. in width
from N. to S. Belzoni here found a granite sarcophagus let into the
ground and f111ed with rubbish, 3 ft. in height, 6 ft. 7 in. in length,
and 31/2 ft. in width, and destitute of inscription. The lid was broken. -
The Lower Passage (Pl. d) descends at first at an angle of 21° 40', reaches
a trap-door (Pl. el, runs in a horizontal direction for 59 ft. (Pl. eff, and
then ascends, terminating, after a distance of 97 ft. in all (Pl. g), in the
horizontal corridor leading to Belzoni‘a Chamber. This ascending passage
was perhaps made to permit the introduction of a broad trap-door of
granite and to permit of the transportation of the coffin from the old tn
the new tomb-chamber. On the E. (left) side of the middle of the horizontal
portion of this lower passage was introduced a small recess, and on the
W. side is a steep passage, 22 ft. in length, descending to a chamber
(P1. h) hewn in the rock, 8 ft. 5 in. in height, M ft. 3 in. in length, and
IO ft. 4 in. in width. This chamber was originally designed to receive the
sarcophagus, but was never used.

The Third Pyramid, named by the Egyptians Neter-Menkewré
('Diothe is Menkewré’), was erected by Menkewlri, the Mykerinos of
Herodotus and the Mencheres of Manetho (p. xcix). Its present per-
pendicular height (Pl. B B, p. 134) is 204 ft., its former height (B C)
was 2i8 ft.; the side of the base (A A) is 3561/2 ft. l the present height
(A B) ofthe sloping sidesis 2633/4 ft., being originally (A C) 2793/4 ft.;
these rise at an angle of 5io. The upper part of the incrustation of
the pyramid was formed of limestone blocks, the lower part ofgranite,
left partly unsmoothed. The granite covering is in good preservation,
especially on the N. and W. sides. On the E. side lie the ruins of
the customary mortuary temple, laid bare during the American ex-
cavations of 1907 under Dr. Reisner and, as usual, approached
from the valley by a still recognizable causeway, beginning with a
so-called valley-temple, a smaller sanctuary built of brick.

The Interior is reached only with diffleulty. The entrance is on the N.
side. A passage a c descends at an angle of 2iP 2' for a distance of 1041/2 ft.,
being lined with red granite where it passes through the masonry from a
to b and then penetrating the solid rock from b to c. From c a horizontal
passage cd leads to an antechamberf, 7 ft. in height, 12 ft. in length, 10 ft.
in width, and decorated with door-shaped ornaments. Beyond this cham-
ber it passes three trap-doors it, descends slightly from h to d (gradient 4"),
a distance of Mt/e ft., and fintrtly descends to the chamber e, in a cavity
in which the sarcophagus of the king seems to have originally stood
(comp. p. 134). This chamber is 441/2 ft. long, 121/2 ft. broad, and, owing
to the unevenness of the rock, from which the pavement has been removed,
varies from 13ft. to 13 ft. 5in. in height.

In the pavement of the chamber e is the mouth (formerly covered) of
a shaft 30 ft. in length, which has a fine granite lining at its upper end
and could he closed by a trap-door at its lower end. It is continued by
a horizontal shaft, 10ft. in length, to the granite Tomb Chamber (Pl. i).
