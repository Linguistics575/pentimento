not infrequently in the desert, and on rare occasions extend to the
Nile Valley.

At Cairo rain usually falls on 4-6 days in the year, the average
amount being about one inch. In some years, however, as much as
two inches are recorded, while in others hardly any rain falls.

At Alexandria and on the coast the regular winter-rains of the
Mediterrean occur, and the average annual rainfall is 8-10 inches,
most of which falls in November-February.

From Assitst southwards the prevalent winds blow from the N.
throughout the year, being slightly to the E. of N. in the spring-
months and more to the W. in the late summer. In winter and spring
dry s. winds occur oieasionally. Jn the N. portion of the country
the winds are more variable, for although N. winds prevail, S. and
S.W. winds may continue for several days in the winter and are a
great hindrance to the sailing craft on the Nile at this season. These
S. winds are due to the Mediterranean winter-storms, which sweep
by from W. to rl., and if they follow a track between Crete and
Egypt produce S. winds blowing from the Egyptian deserts towards
the storm-centre. The winds blowing from the open desert are cold
and by their dryness seem to be even colder than they really are,
so that visitors to Cairo in the winter-months may experience the
sensation of a somewhat greater degree of cold than would be ex-
pected from the temperatures quote-d above.

The spring-storms of the Mediterranean are also primarily the
cause of the Khamtit"m, or hot S. wind which occasionally blows for
two or three days at a time in March, April, and May. This wind
blows from the heated deserts and often attains con siderable strength,
carrying with it sand and dust until a thick yellow fog may prevail,
sufficiently dense to hide the sun. The shade temperature under
these conditions frequently exceeds 100Â° Fahr.

On tho desert-plateau the range of temperature is at all times
of the year considerably greater than in the valley, while the dryness
is much greater. 1n the valley the temperature varies comparatively
little and sinks to freezing point only for very brief periods. Ch, the
desert-plateau, however, the thermometer often stands at the freez-
ing point and may even fall several degrees below it.
