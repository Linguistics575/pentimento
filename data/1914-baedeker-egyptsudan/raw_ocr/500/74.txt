d. Geology of Egypt.

1. THE NILE VALLEY AND THE ISTHMUS OV SUEZ. The building
stone generally used at Alexandria is obtained from the quarries of
Meks (p. 26) and on the coast to the E. of Alexandria. This is a
calcareous Iight-coloured stone of the quaternary period, formed of
fragments of shells and foraminifera, intermixed with oiilitie granules
and grains of quartz sand, or even with fine gravel. This rock forms
low hills to the W. of Alexandria and the coast-strip from Alexan-
dria to Abulsir. In many places it is covered by saud-dunes and
other recent formations.

The cultivated plains of the Delta and the Nile Valley consist
of recent alluvial deposits, ranging from fine sand to the finest silt,
laid down by the water of the annual inundation. Under these lie
coarser yellowish sands and gravels of pleistocene age, which here
and there reach the surface in the Delta as islands of sandy waste
among the rich cultivation of the surrounding country. These are re-
lated to the later sand and gravel deposits on the neighbouring deserts,
and to the trapes of marine cliffs and beaches of the same period
which may be seen on both sides of the valley at Cairo and at other
places. At Abu Za'bal (p. i20), to the N.E. of Nawa, occurs a low
hill of basalt which supplies exeellent road-metal for Cairo and
Alexandria.

The N. portion of the Isthmus ofSuez consists of the recent marine
deposits of the Mediterranean, while in the central portion, near the
low hill of El-Gisr and round Lake Timstb, are deposits of the Nile
mud with fresh-water shells. To the S. of the Bitter Lakes are, found
marine quaternary deposits of the Red Sea.

Reefs of fossil coral of quaternary age occur over a large part of
the coasts of the Gulf of Suez, and the highest of these are now
1000 ft. above the present sea-level, while five or six others occur
at lower levels. The land here, or at least the coast line, must there-
fore have risen considerably in comparatively recent times, and the
salines whivh are now forming appear to show that the movement
has not yet ceased. The shores and islands of the Red Sea are to-
day fringed with coral reefs which are most dangerous to shipping.

Sands and loams occur to the S. of the pyramids of Gizeh, and
at numerous places on the E. side of the Nile valley between Cairo
and Feshn, belonging, as is shown by the numerous fossils which they
contain, to the pliocene age. The small valley immediately to the
S. of the pyramids of ZÃ©wiyet el-%rytn has been cut out in these
beds, and a rich collection of pliocene fossils may be made here.
These deposits are intimately connected with the formation of the
present, valley in plioeene times, when it was at first a fiord into
which the waters of the Mediterranean flowed at least as far as Keneh
and perhaps even as far as Esneh. hi the time of the older miocene
sea the Nile valley did not exist, but instead a large river flowed
from a S.W. direction towards the region that is now Lower Egypt.
