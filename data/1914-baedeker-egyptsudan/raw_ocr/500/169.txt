lous times of the llyksos supremacy and were replaced under the
[8th Dyn. by new buildings, in which the materials of the earlier
tsdifiees were utilized as far as possible. ln plan they seem to
have corresponded exactly with the later sanctuaries, and probably
many temples of the later period were erected on the plans of the
earlier buildings. In decoration also they exactly raserhNeil the
later temples. The inner walls were adorned with reliefs showing
the king in communion with the gods; the ceilings of their halls were
supported by columns of various patterns (comp. pp. clviii et squ;
and in front of their entrances rose tall obelisks (p. 121) and colossal
statues of the Pharaohs.

However different from each other the TEMPLES OF' THE NEW
EMPIRE appear at first sight, there is but little difficulty in refer-
ring them all to two general fundamental forms. One of these, re-
calling, probably quite accidentally, the Greek Peripteros or temple
surrounded by a eolonnade, was especially popular during the
18th Dyn., the age of Thutmosis ill. and his successors. The
rectangular cella (pr sanctuary), containing the sacred boat with
the image of the god and provided with doors at each end, rose
upon a basement of masonry. crowned with a concave cornice and
approached by a flight of steps. On all four sides it was surrounded
by a colonuade, the roof of which rested upon square pillars or
on Proto-Dorie columns, connected by low screens. Occasionally
this main structure was adjoined at the back by several smaller
apartments, also used for religious rites. Among the peripteral
structures of this kind are the small temples of Thutmosis IO. at
Karnak and )ledinet Ilabu (pp. 279, 328), the S. temple of Buhen
near Widi Halfa (p. 412), and a sanctuary of Amenophis III. upon
the island of Elephantine, which has now vanished. Curiously
enough this form of peripteros was revived in the Ptolemaic period,
though with various modifieations, being used in the so-called Birth
Houses (Mammi:si), which stood beside the principal temples (e.g. at
Phila; p. 367) and were dedicated to the worship of the maternal
deity (Isis or Hathor] and her child. The inner sanctuaries in these
birth-houses also were surrounded with colonnades, the roofs of
which, however, were borne by the curious sistrum-columns Brown-
ed with heads of Hathor or with figures of lies.

The second fundamental form of the Egyptian temple is most
simply and clearly illustrated in the small temples built by Ram-
ses III. at Karnak in honour of Khons and of Amen, with his two
companion-deities (pp. 262, 267 ; see special plan of the great temple
of Amon at Karnak, p. 265). The approach to the temple is formed
by the Pylon, two large towers of masonry flanking the entrance-door.
These towers are shaped like very steep truncated pyramids; the
slightly inclining walls, framed with round mouldings, offer the
greatest available space for reliefs. The towers were imposing from
heir sheer size, and this impression was heightened (from the
