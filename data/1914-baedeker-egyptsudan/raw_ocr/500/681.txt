The following ANTEROOM (P1. 0), about 30 ft. wide though only
17 ft. deep, is entered by a small door, on the left side of which is
the king before Ptah. The ceiling is supported by two square pillars.
The walls and pillars are embellished with representations of the
king in presence of various gods (irwluding the deitied Ramses).

monotony. --. 29 M. Koshtumneh, a commune on both banks. Un

is the ancient Egyptian Per-Selket, 'House of (the Goddess) Stslket',
the Greek Pselehis, near which the Roman general Petronius de-

bank is the -

Temple of Dakkeh, which was restored in 1908-9 by Barsanti.
The present temple occupies the site of an earlier shrine, probably
of the New Empire, and was dedicated to Them. of Pnubs, an
Ethiopian town. By the Greeks this god was called Paotuuphis.
The most ancient part of the building dates from the time of the
Ethiopian king Ergamenes and his contemporary PhiloPator. Euer-
getes H. added a vestibule and the temple received its fiual form
under the Roman emperors by the addition of the sanctuary and
of the pylon. The temple lies with its main axis parallel to the
river (ie. running N. and S.), contrary to the usual rule in Nubian

A broad path, bordered on both sides by a row of hewn stones,
