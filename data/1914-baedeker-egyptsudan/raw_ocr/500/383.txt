b0w-net into a basket; two men seated at a small table cutting up

themselves free, others are browsing; to the right, herdsmen in
small papyrus boats drive a herd of cattle across a river in which
lurk two crocodiles; to the left are two dwarfs with their master's

shoulders.

The narrow strip running along the entire N. wall at the bot-
tom consists of a procession of 36 peasant women bearing sacri-
fieial offerings of meat, poultry, vegetables, fruits, and drink. The
different figures represent the various estates of the deceased Ti,
the name of each being inscribed beside its representative.

The *Tomb of Mereruka. is another grave well worthy of a visit.
It is situated at the NW. angle of the Pyramid of Teti (p.163), which
lies to the E. of Marictte's house, beyond a ruined stone pyramid. The
tomb dates from the beginning of the 6th Dyn. and contains 31 rooms
and passages, divided into three sections, of which that marked A on
the plan (p. 160) belonged to Meremka, that marked B to Hert-
watet-kltet, his wife, and that marked C to their son hleri-Teti. The
tablet at the entrance records the discovery in 1893.
