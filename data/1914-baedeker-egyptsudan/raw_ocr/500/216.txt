English Church of St. Mark (‘Egh anglicane', Pl. l?, 4; p. 11), ad-.
joined by St. Mark's Building, belonging to the British community;
on the E. side is the Exchange; on the S.W. are the Law Courts.
These are the only buildings which escaped the fury of the natives in
1882. In the garden beside St. Mark's Building is a bust of General
Earle, who fell at the battle of Kirbekan in 1885 o. 419). - From
the E. side of the square runs the busy Rue Che’rif Pacha, the chief
seat of the retail trade, with attractive shops (in the side-streets
also); from the S. side the Rue des Scams (tramway No. 1, p. 9),
prolonged by the long Rue Ibrahim Premier, constructed through
an old and crowded Arab quarter, leads to the quarter of Mind
el-Bassal (P1. D, E, (O, the focus of the cotton trade, with the
Cotton Exchange (accessible in the forenoon to visitors introduced
to a eotton-exporter). The Rue Ibrahim ends at the Pont Neuf or
Pant Ibrahim, crossing the MaltmOtyeh Canal(p.12). On the S. bank
of the canal lies the quarter of Minet esh-Shar.kiiurfyeh (Tharsraou'ivet
Pl. D, E, 7), occupied by wholesale dealers in grain, sugar, onions, etc.
- Gabbari and thence to Meks, see p. 26.

From the, S.E. corner of the Place Méhémet Ali we reach the
triangular Square Ste. Catherine (P1. F, I), with the Roman Catholic
church of St. Catherine. The Rue Abou Dardaa (tramway No. d, p. 10)
leads hence to the s., passing the European Hospital (P1. F, d, 5),
the Armenian Church (Pi. F, 5), and the Collage St. Francois Xavier,
to the Sidi Amr Mosque (Pl. G, fr).

We now turn to the right into the Rue da Premier Khédive and
then (almost at once) to the left into the flue de la Colonne Pompée,
which leads to the s., past a large Arab cemetery (Pl. F, G, 6, 7),
to an eminence covered with rubbish and fragments of ruins, the
site of the ancient Scrapcum (p. Li). Here rises *Pompey's Pillar
(Arab. El-itiid; Pl. F, G, 7; adm. 3 pias., June-Sept. 1pias., but
comp. p. 'M), the largest well-preserved relic of antiquity in the
city. We reach the top of the plateau by a flight of steps. All
around lie fragments of Roman buildings and other objects revealed
by the extensive excavations begun by Botti (p. 21) and continued
by the Von Sieglin Expedition (1898-1902) and by Breceia (p. 21;
1905-7). The monument is composed of red granite from Assuin.
The height of the column, including the rectangular pedestal and
the Corinthian eapita], is 88 ft.; the shaft, 68 ft. high, is about
9 ft. in diameter at the bottom and not quite 8ft. at the top. The
foundations, composed of several blocks (one with the name and
tigure of Sethos I., p. Ciii) which once belonged to other buldings,
are much damaged. On the W. side is a mueh-defaeed inseription
in honour of the Emp. Diocletian, placed here in 292 A.D. by a
Roman prefect named Posidius. The latest theory in regard to the
column, which may once have belonged to the Temple of Serapis,
is that it was erected here by the Emp. Theodosius to commemorate
the victory of Christianity and the destruction of the Serapeum
