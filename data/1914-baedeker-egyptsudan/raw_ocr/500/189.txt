and are destitute of decoration. The corpse, wrapped in white cotton
cloth, is placed upon a bed of sand, with the face turned towards
Mecca, When both sexes are interred in the same vault a partition-
wall is erected to separate them. Above the vault stands a eenotaph
(Tarkibeh when of stone or brick, T1fMit when of wood) resting on a
pedestal, with a small pillar or column at each end. On the column
at the head of the grave is frequently represented a turban or
t.arbi1sh, indicating the rank and sex of the deceased. The inscrip-
tions give the name and the date of death, with texts from the
Koran. Over the eenotaphs of persons of distinction are often cano-
pies, resting on four columns. Wealthy families surround the tombs
with extensive buildings (Wwh), including rooms for mourners,
sebil, stables, eustodian's residence, etc. The tombs of the Caliphs
and Mamelnkes at Cairo (p. lit) include many such erections, which
lend the cemeteries the appearance of small half-deserted towns.

Among SECULAR BUILDINGS the 1?ortifieations of the citadel of
Cairo (p. 68), dating from the time of Saladin, recall the medieval
castles of Europe. Some of the numerous gates in the walls of Cairo
date from the Fatimite period; they were probably built after Roman
models and are distinguished for the skill with which they are Coll-
strueted, espeeially for accuracy in the jointing of the stones.

0f the ancient Palaces nothing but rnins new remains. The
lower stories, built of massive blocks, have barrel-vaults and pointed
arches of hewn stone, the upper stories have similar vaults in
lighter masonry. In one case, vis. the Dir Beshttk Palace at Cairo
(p. 76), we observe remains of balconies and of a projecting, slightly
curved cornire supported by wooden consoles; and traces of richly
painted and gilded eoffered ceilings are likewise met with. From an
examination of the scanty remains and with the help of the Arabic
writers, whose descriptions, however, are seldom free from exagger-
ations, we may conclude that the palaces resembled in general the
houses of the richer private citizens (many of whieh have been
preserved), exceeding them only in size and splendour.

Dwelling Houses (comp. the plans at pp. clxxxiv, clxxxv) rarely
have more than two stories; on the groundfloor ie the Saltmltlt, the
men's apartments, and on the first floor the 1.Tartm or Harem, the
women’s apartments and family rooms. The following rules are gen-
orally observed in the construction of a dwelling-house '. -- (l) The
principal rooms look into the court or garden. (2) The windows look-
ing to the street are as few as possible and placed very high, while
those of the upper floors are closed with gratings. (3) The passage
(Dirkeh; Pl. I, 3) leading from the street to the court is built in the
form of an angle, to prevent people from seeing into the court. (4) The
door to the harem (P1. 11, 4) is placed in a separate court or, failing
that, in a retired part of the court of the salémlik. (5) The reoep-
tion-rooms of the master of the house, the servants' quarters, kitchen,
mill, and stables are arranged round the court of the salttrnlik.
