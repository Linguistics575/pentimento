battlements. Remote from the battlefield, to the extreme left, the
prince of the IIittites stands in his chariot, surrounded by his
guards, and 'fears before his majesty'. - Below the reliefs on the
W. tower is a long poetical description of the battle of Kadesh,
inscribed in vertical lines. It is continued 011 the E, tower, where,
however, the text is still partly concealed by rubbish.

On the front of each tower of the pylon are two large vertical
grooves for the reception of flag-staffs, and above these are large
square apertures to receive the braces securing the flag-staffs and
loopholes to admit light and air to the interior. The portal between
the towers is buried in rubbish and in a very ruinous condition.
The reliefs represent Ramses H. in presence of the chief deities of
the temple. The carvings in the doorway, in somewhat high relief,
date from the reign of the Ethiopian king Shabako.

Beyond the principal pylon (though not accessible from this
side, comp. p. 257) lies the great Court of Ramses II. CPI. A),
which was entirely surrounded by a double row ofpapyrus-columns
(74 in all), with bud-capitals and smooth shafts. It measures
187 ft. in length and 167 ft. in breadth, but, owing to the presence
of a mosque (p. 257), only the W. and S. sides have been laid bare.
On a platform in the N.W. corner lies an ancient Chapel (Pl. Th),
built by Thutmosis III. and restored by Ramses II. It contains
three chambers, of which that in the centre was dedicated to Amen,
that on the W. to Nut, and that on the E. to Khons, each tlon-
taining the sacred bark of the god. On the side facing the court
it had a small eolonnade of four clustered papyrus-eolumns in red
granite.

The Walls of' the court are covered with reliefs and inscriptions,
including sacrificial scenes, hymns to the gods, representations of
conquered nations, etc., most of which date from the reign of Ram-
ses II. The relief on the S.W. wall (P1. Y) shows the facade of
the temple of Luxor, with the pylons and flag-staffs, the colossal
statues, and the obelisks, while from the right approaches a pro-
cession, headed by the princes and followed by garlanded animals
for sacrifice. (The scene is continued on the W. wall.)

The S. half of the court is further embellished with standing
Colossi of Ramses 11., placed between the columns in the first row.
These, with the exception of one in black granite, are wrought in
red granite and average 23 ft. in height. The finest (Pi, a) is 171/3 ft.
high; the crown, carved from a separate block, has fallen off; on
the pedestal and apron is the name of Ramses II. On each side
of the S. doorway is another colossal figure of the king in black
granite, seated with the queen by his side.

On the S.side this court is adjoined by a Colonnade (PLB), which
was originally intended as the beginning of an immense hypostyle
hall (comp. p. 257). The colonnade is in fairly good preservation
