for provisions. Information and time-tables may be obtained on
application to the tor1rist-agents at Cairo (p. 38).

TOURIST STEAMERS. Travellers who desire to inspect the ruined
sites of Nubia more closely will avail themselves of one of the
tourist-steamers Which devote a week to the round trip (fare 20L;
return-fare from Cairo by steamer all the way, from MI., comp.
p. 201). Messrs. cook's steamers Thebes (42 berths) and Prince
Abbas (44 berths) leave Shellal respectively every Mon. from Dec.
to the middle of March and every Wed. in Jan. and Feb.; while
the Nubia (42 berths) of the Hamburg & Anglo-American Nile co.
leaves Shelli] every Wed. from Christmas to the middle of March.

In consequence ofthe heightening of the dam at Assuin (p. 371)
the Nile banks in Northern Nubia will be under water during the
season and most of the temples will be ihaeeessible (comppp. 387,
393). White marks on the rocks indicate the highest levels hitherto
reached by the river. In summer and autumn all the ruins will be
above water.
