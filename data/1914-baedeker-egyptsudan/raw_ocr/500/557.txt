atives of the" four chief races of men known to the ancient E gyptiaus

god Thout and the falcon-headed Har- iifCrt'ei'iiiri"; to the left, the
king presenting Osiris with an image of truth. Rear Wall: the
king (to right and left) in presence of Osiris. On the remaining
spaces are scenes from the 'Book of him who is in the Underworld'
(deities felling trees, etc.).

The other rooms, which are not lighted by electricity, are much
damaged and need detain the traveller but a short time. - Iloog X,
with pillars, contained the sarcophagus of the king (now in the
Louvre, the lid in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge"). The
mummy of the king, now at Cairo (p. 90), was found hidden at
Deir el-Rahri (comp. p. 93).

No. 13, very low, and largely filled up, was not a king's tomb,
but seems to have belonged to Ba'i, chief minister of King, Siptah
(19th Dyn.).

(comp. p. 99), was afterwards appropriated and enlarged by Seth-
