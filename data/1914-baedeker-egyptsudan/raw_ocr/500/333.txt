of Cairo. NEW HELIOPOLIS. 5. Route. 119

and bounded on either hand byhills. We hold somewhat to the right
and soon reach a road, which finally passes through a rocky ravine
near the (hytulu' eminence, the view from which (p. 116) forms an

admirable close to the day's excursion. Thence to the city, seep.116.

The following SHORTEB \VAY may be recommended. We ride as
described at pp. 117, 118 direct to the Little Petrified Forest and then
return to the Spring of Moses. Hence we ascend to the w. to the plateau
of the Makattam and ride across it toward the w. to the Giyiisbi mosque
(p. 116). FrOm the mosque we descend to the citadel.

A visit to the GREAT PETRIFIED FOREST near Bir el-Falun (4 hrs.
to the E. of Cairo and 21/2 hrs. beyond the Little Petrified Forest) takes
a whole day, and is fatiguing, especially as the traveller has the sun in
his face both in going and returning. The route mentioned on p. 117 is
not recommended for the outward journey, as the point for which we
are bound, not being conspicuous, is liable to be missed. It is better to
leave Cairo by the Ed!) el-Ifardfeh (P1.E,7; p. 68), pass the Tombs of the
3lamelukes (p. 115) and the goods-railway to tlelwiin, and,1eaving the village
of El-Basiitin on the right, ascend to the left by the Jewish Cemetery. After
reaching the top of the hill we follow the Wddi et-TO (p. 118) towards
the Fl. for Ith-ft/e hr. more. Above the gradual slopes of the desert,
about li/e N. to the left, we then perceive several reddish hills and
another of yellowish colour in front. liding towards the latter we reach
on its E. slopes the débris of the Bir el-Fahm (‘coal well') and remains
of some walls, dating from the period (ISU)) when an unsuccessful search
for coal was made here. The hills of the desert to the N., N.W., and
W. of the Bir el-Falun form the Great Petrified Forest, and are thickly
strewn with trunks and fragments of fossil timber. These are generally
brown and black, with a polished appearance, and frequently contain chal-
cedony. A saud-hill, 1/2 hr. to the N. of Bir el-Fahm, to the base of
which the petrified forest extends, affords a good survey of the district.
To the N.W. are the 3rolia.t.tam, the 'Red Mountain', 'Alab2s'iyeh, and the
plain of the Nile.

5. New Heliopolis (Heliopolis Oasis).

The most convenient route to the new suburb of Heliopolis Oasis is by
electric express railway or tramway (see p. 39). Carriage, see p. 39. -
The excursions to Old and New 1Ieliopolis may he combined by taking
(on the return from the former) the electric tramway from the railway
station of Palais de Kouhbeh (p. 120) to Ileliopolis Oasis.

New Heliopolis (hotels, see p. MO, or Heliopolis Oasis, known
also to the Arabs as Ma.g-r et- Gedtdelt('NewCairo'), is a modern suburb
founded by a Belgian company in 1906, in the desert to the N.E.
ofubbtstyeh and near the new English barracks. It occupies a
healthy situation and is intended to become a residential suburb for
British officers and officials and a health-resort for the inhabitants
of Cairo generally. It is laid out on an ambitious scale, with broad,
tree-planted streets and squares, with hotels, pleasure-resorts (Luna
Park, adm. 2pias.), a racecourse, a stadium, where shows of all
kinds are held, and the grounds of the Sporting Club (p. 4'O.
