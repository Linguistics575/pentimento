SUEZ. 13. Route. 187

Near 1ilsh-Shatu1feh (p station near the 139th kilometre; see
p. 181) no less than 45,000 cubic yds. of limestone, coloured red
and brown with iron, had to be removed in the course of the ex-
cavation of the canal. This stone contained teeth and vertebrae
of sharks, bivalve shells, and remains of Bryozoa. In the layer ol'
sand above the limestone were found crocodiles’ teeth and the re-
mains of hippopotami and otherlarge quadrupeds. The monument
of Darius near Esh-Shalltsi'eh is mentioned at p. 182.

We finally reach the Gulf of Suez, which is here so shallow that,
but for the canal, it might be crossed on foot at low tide. It con-
tains several islands. On the w. bank rise the workshops and
magazines of the Canal Company. Passengers are landed in steam-
launches.
