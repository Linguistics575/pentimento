the temple ofJerusalem. The entire native creed of the Meceans was
re-interpreted on an Ahrahamistie basis, so that its incorporation
with Islim was rendered possible. On the other hand the reception
of 15121111 by the Meccans was equally facilitated. In addition to this
assertion of religions independence the Hegira had another conse-
quence of great moment for the future of Islam: the position of
the Prophet as also the head of a state entailed a mingling of polit-
ical and religious life. And as a matter of fact the present mark-
vdIy political character of Islam is a result of this short-lived
theocraey. Mohammad further had definite conceptions of a revealed
religion, for which he deemed necessary a sacred book, a prophet,
and a fixed ritual with recitations and liturgies. But at the date of
his death neither islamie law nor dogma, not even the number of
daily prayers, was fixed and determined. The comprehensive system
now known as the religion of 1sslim gradually grew trp in the course
of time.

The foundation is the Koran (p. 1xxxix), the very word of God,
which was collected and published as early as 650A.D. This con--
tains few rescripts or Jaws. Next to it as a rule of conduct ranks the
Senna, the practice of the Prophet and his earliest associates. To
follow this example in all its details became, doubtless under the
iuiluenee of the Jewish spirit, the aim of every believer. The b'unna
was glossed by the sayings of the Prophet and by reports as to his
practice and as to the things that he suffered to happen without
comment. These formed the traditions 01' Hadiths. Originally the
I'ladiths were substantially genuine, but in the course of the general
effort to live as the Prophet did they finally became the literary
vehicles of religious controversy. To sift them and to harmonize
their contradictory sayings has given rise to a science of itself. In
this process the consensus or agreement of the learned (Igmtf) was
the deciding authority, which thus became authoritative over the
Senna, and indeed over the Koran itself, for only the Igmt' was able
rightly to interpret the Koran. The early'seholars of Islam too re-
ceived the Jgrn2' as the most important principle of development
next to the Sunna and the Koran.

Founded on the Koran, the Senna, and the 1gnyt', Mohammedan Law
has been developed into a canonical system, embracing every depart-
ment oflife, in the manner of the Jewish and Christian systems.
When the Arabs became masters of' the ancient civilized countries
of the Near East, there arose at once a crop of unforeseen legal pro-
blems, which had to be solved according to the Senna, or at least in
their spirit. The impulse to independent legal activity in the newly-
conquered lands was given (as in the Viral}: by Abu Hanifa, d. 767)
by the pre-Justine-an Roman law that had been accepted by the
Christian church. Against this intellectual independence, which
allowed room for differences of opinion, arose the orthodox party at
Medina (Mam ibn Anas: d. 795), who admitted only the letter of
