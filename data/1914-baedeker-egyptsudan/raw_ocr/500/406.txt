180 h'oute 11. iSMi‘riLiYEH. From Port Sa’id

On quitting IsnWiltytsh, we obtain another glimpse of the azure
waters of Lake Timséh. At (511/2 M.) Neitsheh, the first station, the
railway to Suez diverges to the left (see p. 181). The line to Cairo
traverses the Arabian Desert, which is intersected from E. to W.
by the Wddi Tihnthtt, and skirts the Fresh Water or I8rnt'tltyeh
Canal. The fertile tract which we now traverse is part of the Goshen
of the Bible. During the Turkish regime it fell into a miserable
condition, and at the beginning of the 19th century afforded a very
scanty subsistence to barely 4000 Arabs; but the cultivation was
so rapidly improved by means of the fresh-water canal that it
now supports upwards of 12,000 prosperous farmers and peasants.
Eeyond the canal, on the left, is a fertile strip, behind which rise

the desert hills.

The Fresh Water or Isméfiliyeh Canal, constructed in 1858-63 to
supply the villages on the Suez Canal with drinking-water and enlarged in
1876, is in great part a restoration of an earlier canal dating from the
Middle Empire. This ancient canal, which began at the Nile, watered the
land of Goshen with its branches, and entering the Bitter Lakes (p.186),
changed their character, according to Strabo, and connected them with
the Red Sea. The channel of the old canal, which was re-discovered
hy the French expedition of 1798, is still traceable at places, and its
direction has frequently been followed by the engineers of M. de Lesseps.
The remains of scarps of masonry show it to have been about 50 yds. in
width and 16-171/2 ft. in depth. According to Herodotus the canal was
four days' journey, and according to Pliny 62 Roman miles, in length.
It is now chiefly used for irrigation purposes. At Shuhra, to the N. of
Cairo, the canal diverges from the Nile and thence traces to the N.E. the
boundary between the Arabian plateau (on the N.) and the land of Goshen
fon the S.). To the E. of Abu Hammad (p. 181) it intersects the ancient
fresh-water canal coming from Za1ptztt, and then runs to the E., parallel
with this, through the Wadi .Tdnt'ildt, which is over 30 M. in length. At
Neffsheh (see above) the canal forks; the S. arm leads to Suez, while the
N. arm leads to Port Sa‘id.

The Goshen of the Bible (Egypt. Gosem) is first mentioned in the
Book of Genesis, xiv. 10, where Pharaoh says to Joseph: - 'And thou
shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt he near unto me, thou,
and thy children, and thy eht1dren's children, and thy flocks, and thy
herds, and all that thou hast'. Mention is made of Goshen also in Genesis
xivi. 28, 29; and xlvii. 1, 6, 27. Exodus i. ll mentions the cities in
Goshen in which the Israelites were compelled to work at the tasks im-
posed on them by Pharaoh: - 'Therefore they did set over them task-
masters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh
treasure-eities (or storehouses), Pithom and Raamses' (see below). Comp.
Sir Hanbury Brown‘s 'The Land ot Goshen and the Exodus' (2nd edit.!;
London, 1912; 3 s.). - Goshen lay in the triangle between Zalfizit, Belbeis,
and Abu Hammad and formed part of the Egyptian nome of Arabia, the
capital of which was Per-Sopt (the Phakusa of the Greeks), re-discovered
by Neville near the modern Saft el-Ht'neh, 2 hrs.' ride to the E. of Zalgiizilg
(p. 171). The ruins have disappeared, hut a few ancient stones have been
built into the houses of the village and two steles are preserved in the
garden of the 'omdeh or village-headmau.

The neighbouring ruins of Tell elr3faskhd.ta mark the site of the PithOm
(Egypt. Per-Atum, tle. 'house of the god Ahun') of the Biblefsee above). The
spot was explored for the Egypt Exploration Fund by Neville, who dis-
covered among the temple-bnildings several grain-stores, in the form
of deep, rectangular chambers without doors, into which the corn was
poured from above. These perhaps date from the time ofRamses IL, and
