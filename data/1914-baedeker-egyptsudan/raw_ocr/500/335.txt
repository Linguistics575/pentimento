of Cairo. OLD HELIOPOLIS. 5. Route. 121

whence the Greek name llcliopolis) and the hnman-headed Atum, to
whom the sacred Mnevis Bull was consecrated. To these was dedicated the
famous temple, 'the Mouse of mi', built on the site of an earlier edifice
by Amenemhit f., first king of the 12th I)yn., in front of which his 80tl
and successor Sesostn's J. erected two great obelisks (see below) in
celebration of an important anniversary. A large section of the Egyp-
tian religious literature was due to the priests of Heliopolis, and their
doctrines were widely disseminated throughout the country at a very
early period, so that PUi-Harakhte was one of the most highly venerated
deities in Egypt. - Even during the Greek period these priests enjoyed
a high reputation for wisdom; Herodotus ennversed with them and Plato
is said to have spent thirteen years with them, in order to learn some
at least of their doctrines. - Under the New Empire the temple of
1leliopolis was the largest and most richly endowed in all Egypt, next to
the temple of Amon at Thebes. - When Straho (b. about 60 B.C.) visited
Egypt the city had been destroyed, but the temple was still intact, ex-
eept for some minor injuries attributed to Camhyses; even the houses of
the priests and the apartments of Plato and his friend Eudosus were
shown to the traveller. The priestly school, however, had ceased to exist,
and only a few officiating priests and guides for foreigners resided there.

The outer walls, rising in all directions from the fields, are
now the only vestiges of the city, while of the temple nothing is
left but a few scanty ruins and a solitary Obelisk (Arab. El-llIisalla).
The latter is of red granite of Syene (Assmin, p. 354) and is 66 ft.
high. It is surrounded by a wooden fence and rises picturesqnely
amid mulberry-trees. Each of the four sides bears the same inscrip-
tion in bold hieroglyphics, recording that Sesostris I. (Senwosret),
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the
sun, whom the (divine) spirits 0f0n (Ileli0polis) love, ete., founded
the obelisk on the first festival of Set Ca kind ofjubilee celebration).
The pyramidium at the top and the falcons which begin the inscrip-
tions on each side were once covered with metal. The companion
obelisk (for these monuments were always erected in pairs) stood
down to the 12th century.

To the W. of the obelisk the remains of the temple may he recog-
nized in a few blocks of granite, bearing inscriptions by Ramses II. On
one Ramses 11. appears offering a libation to Atum. - The A'etropolis of
Heliopolis lies about 3 N. to the E. of the obelisk.

The excursion may be extended to the villages of EI-Marg or El-
Merg (21/2 M.), with some ruins of the 18th Dyn., and Ahdn.kdh, on the
outskirts of the desert (71/2 M. from Na.t2rtyeh), both stations on the rail-

way from Cairo to Shibin el-Tiaras!"" (see p. 120). The palm-groves at El-
3larg afford pleasant walks.

l. Barrage du Nil.

The BRANCH RAILWAY TO THE BARBAGE is traversed by ten trains daily
from Cairo (161/2 M., in 30-35mirci fare il or 4 pias., day return-tickets Sth,.
or 51/2 pies). The intermediate stations are Bhubra and A"atyfil) (p. ill
The best plan is to walk from the Barrage station and to 'return by the
small 'trolley', pushed by Arabs, which unites Barrage with the station of
El-Mrndshi, on the West Nile Railway (p. 32; 1-2 pers. 10, 3 pers. t3, 4
pers. 15 pias. per hr.-, from the station to the village of El-Naniishi across
the river, or vice term, 4 pins, each addit. pers 2 pias.). Opposite the
Barrage station is the Restaurant Tewfikieh. - Messrs. Cook & Son arrange
special excursions by stenm-launch to the Barrage (see notice at the hotels).
Also steamers of the Compagr1ie des Batcaux-Omnibus (p. 39).
