Mohammad, the founder of the religion, son of 'Abdalltth, was
born at Mecca about 570 A.D. and at the age of forty announced him-
self as a prophet. As he found no acceptance in his native Mecca,
he emigrated In (Y22 to Medina. This was the famous Heiilra or Hijra
(quite erroneously translated 'flight'), the date of which, on the in-
troduction of the Mohammedan calendar, was fixed as 16th July, P22.
At Medina he met with more success, and from the position ofa
kind of magistrate he rose to be the head of a new state. After years
of flghting he captured Mecca in 630, but two years later he died at
Medina in the prime of life. Mohammed never represented himself
as anything beyond a mortal man, but in legend, which in the East
has the authority of history, he is invested with the halo of the
miraculous. God, it is said, created the Light of the Prophet even
before the creation of the divine throne; and this Light wandered
through all the generations of men until it manifested itself at the
centre of the world in the best of created beings, a noble scion of
the noblest family of Mecca. Angels, opening the breast of the
boy, expnngetl the last drop of sin from his heart. A little later the
Archangel Gabriel brought him the Revelations, the Korans, which
were then formed into a book. Mehammed wrought many miracles
and even raised the dead to life, as in tho ease of his parents, who
turned their brief resurrection to account by embraeinglshtm. Among
his most celebrated feats was the splitting of the moon and his
nocturnal journey (mirrdg) on a miraculous steed from Jerusalem to
heaven, where he treated with the Deity as to the number of prayers
to be offered by the faithful.

The starting-point of; Mohammedâ€™s teaching was the conception
of the Last Judgment. Borrowing the conviction of a future life and
of future rewards and punishments from the Jews andChristians, who
were found all Over Arabia, Mohammed exhorted his careless fellow-
countrymen, who lived merely from day to clay, to adopt a more
serious conception of life. Paradise and hell were drawn by him in
striking colours. The idea of the Judgment involves the idea of a
just and single deity; from the beginning, therefore, Mohammed had
to preach the strictest monotheism in opposition to the fetishism of
the Arabs. This he named Islam, Le. resignation to the will of God.
He believed at first that Christianity and Judaism were identical,
and he desired to bring the same glad gospel to the Arabs. When he
learned the real historical relation of these faiths, he postulated an
ascending series of revelations, culminating in Islam. At Medina he
at first endeavoured to accommodate himself to the doctrines of the
Jewish community there, but soon finding this impossible he shook
himself free of both Christian and Jewish fetters, although he still
adhered to Abraham (Ibrahim), who was venerated by Jews and
Christians alike and was, moreover, according to the Bible the an-
cestor, through Ishmael, of' the Arabs. The ancient temple of stone
at Mecca, the Kaaha (Ka'ba, i.e. cube), became to him an analogue of
