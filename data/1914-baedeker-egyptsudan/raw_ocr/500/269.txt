Quarters. CAIRO. d. Route. 65

The illuminated Persian MSS. are extremely valuable. The library
contains also a collection of coins (upwards of 3800) of the Moharn-
medan rulers of Egypt. - The reading-room is open daily, except
on Frid. and ofileial festivals, from 8 to one hour before sunset (in
July, Aug., and Sept. 8-1; during Ramadan 10-2). Visitors to the
other rooms require a special permit from the director, while those
who wish to borrow books must obtain a guarantee from some high

ofiieial or other personage in Cairo known to the director.

Shelf 8. Arabic MSS. from North Africa and Spain (11-17th cent.). -
Shelves 9-20. Fine examples of the Koran. These are remarkable for their
large size, superb execution, and great age. The Mohammedans have
always exercised the greatest care in preparing the MSS. of the Koran,
and have always regarded the sacred book which was sent to them from
heaven with the most profound reverence. The oldest specimens of the
Koran (Shelves t? teg.), dating from the 8-10th cent., are in the (hrjic, or
early-Arabie, character and are written on parchment. Among the fine
large copies of the Koran on paper which were executed for the sultans of
the Bahrite Mamelukes (1250-1382) and their emirs, the most notable are
those (Shelves 14 seq.) made for the Sultans f.iasan and Sharbtxn and their

Shelves 39-tt. 'Persian 3188. with miniatures. The origin and develop-
ment of this branch of art have not yet been adequately investigated. The
specimens here exhibited are all the work of Mohammedan artists, though
the intluenee of E. Asiatic taste is noticeable in those of later date. These
book-illustrations are distinguished from the purely ornamental art of the
Korans by a greater freedom of conception and variety of motive, particularly
by the frequent employment of living forms. Nearly all are illustrations
of poetical or historical works. The chronological arrangement shows that
this art was at its best in the 14-16th cent., and that thereafter a rapid
decline set in. Shelf 3.9. “Divan of the poems of Farid id-Din Attar, written
