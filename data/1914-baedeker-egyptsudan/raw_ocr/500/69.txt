The Italian residents, 31,020 in number, eensist elticlly of trad-.
ers of a humble class, but include also many merchants, advocates,
and scholars. Of French nationality (14,590 are all the artisans of
the higher class, who are generally noted for their skill, trust-
worthiness, and sobriety. Most of the better shops are kept by
Frenchmen, and the chief European offhirls of the government,
including several architects and engineers, were, until recently
French. 'l' he Il ritish settlers numbered 6118 in 188‘) and in 1007
20,653, inulnsive of the troops. Until recently their specialties
were the manufa cture of machinery and the construction of railways
and harbours; but of late they have also almost monopolized the
chief posts in those branches of the administration (army, post and
telegraph offi co railways, trusstom-howse)that have been remodelled
after the l‘ritish pattern. Apart from the troops, a large majority
of the, residents who enjoy the protection oi' the l‘nitish consulate
are Maltese and natives of India [in 1307, 6202 from p, ritish
colonies). To the Maltese, apply even more forcibly most of the
remarks already made regarding the Greeks. It has been ascertained
that the Maltese settlers in foreign countries are more numemus
than those resident in their two small native islands, and of these
a considerable proportion belongs to Egypt. At home, under the
discipline of British institutions, they form a pattern little nation
of their own, but in Egypt, where they are freed from the restraint
of these influences, they are very apt to degenerate and to swell
unduly the ranks of the criminal class. Many of the Maltese, how-.
ever, are enterprising tradesmen and industrious artisans, such as
shoemakers and joiners. To the Austrian (7704) and German (18$?)
community belong a number of merchants of the best class, many
physicians and teachers, inn-keepers, musicians, and lastlyhurnhlv,
hamlicraftsmen. - In 1007 there were. 521 Americans in Egypt.

With regard to the capability of 1?uuropeaus of becoming ae-
climatized in Egypt there are a number of widely divergent opinions.
Much, of course, must depend on the nature of the climate of their
own respective countries. It has been asserted that European
families settled in Egypt die out in the second or third generation,
but of this there is 110 sufficient proof, as the European community
is of very recent origin, and many examples to the contrary might
be cited. Moreover as the Europeans in Egypt dwell exclusively in
the large cities, they do not afford very conclusive evidence 011 the
general question; for city life, as opposed to country life, is even
less propitious to health and vigour in warm countries than it is in
northern climes. Thus the Mamelukes have left no descendants in
Egypt. The climate of Egypt (comp. p. lxxvii) is less enervating
than that of most other hot countries, an advantage attributed to
the dryness of the air.
