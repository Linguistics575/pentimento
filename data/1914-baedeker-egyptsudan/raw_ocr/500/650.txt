370 Route 24. PHIL/E.

cursive characters (p. cxxxi) - In the second row from the top, on the
Right Wall (Pl. p), is the celebrated Representation of the Source of the Nile:
at the foot of a rocky eminence, on which perch a. vulture and a falcon, the
Nile-god, surrounded by a serpent, pours water from two vases. - To the
right of this is Horus (in the form of a falcon) on a reedy lake between
Hathor (on the left) and Isis, Nephthys, Horns, and Amen (on the right).

A subterranean staircase to the S. of 1Iadrian's Gateway leads to a
M'lometer (lights necessary), which has hieratic and demotic scales as well
as the customary Coptic one.

From 11adrian's Gateway we proceed to the N., to the ruins of a
Temple of Harendotes (p. cl), built by the limp. Claudius.

1n the N. part of the island (comp. the Map, p.364) are two
Coptic Churches, the remains of a Coptic Convent, and a ruined Temple
of Augustus, built in the 18th year of that emperor's reign.

At the extreme N.E. of the island, and in the axis of the temple
of Augustus, is a large Roman Town Gate, with three arches, the
sidc-arches being lower than that in the centre. The N. sidc-arch
has a domical stone vault in the Roman style. This gateway was
probably erected by Diocletian. .

About 50 paces to the E. of the Temple of Isis, lies the small -

*Temple of Hathor, dedicated to Hatlior-Aphrodite by Philo-
metor and Eucrgetes II. The colonnade in front of it (restored)
and the sanctuary (now vanished) were both added by Augustus.

The columns in the former were united by stone sereens, on which
Augustus appeared saeriileing to various forms of Hathor. On the columns
themselves are charming representations of flute-players, hampers, figures
of Bes playing the tambourine and the harp and dancing, apes playing
the lyre, priests carrying an antelope, etc. The temple proper is in better
preservation; in front of it are two plant columns, which were joined to
the walls by means of screens.

To the SE. of this temple , on the bank , rises the so-called -

**Kiosque, the chief decoration and the characteristic symbol of
the island, which, however, is generally so submerged that only the
upper part of its columns are visible. It dates from the Roman
imperial period and was never completed. Above the floral capitals
of the columns it was intended to add sistrum-capitals.

Only the end-walls are smoothed on the outside, the side-walls were
left rough-hewn. Within, two of the stone screens between the columns
are embellished with reliefs: Trajan offering wine to Isis and to the
falcon-headed Horus, and Trajan hefore Osiris and Isis. The remaining
screens are simply smoothed, except two which are still rough-hewn.

The rocky island of Biggeh or Bigeh (Egypt. Senmet), the chief
deities of which were Ups, the goddess of fire, and Hathor, is, like
Philae, now flooded in winter (comp. p. 365). It is reached by boat in
a few minutes from Phila, of which it commands a picturesque view.
We land at the ancient quay and ascend by a staircase. In front of
us lie the remains of a Ptolemaie temple (Neos Dionysos), of which
part of the hypostyle hall is still standing, with its plant-tsolar'
united by stone screens. On the E. side is a door, into which an apse
has been built. There are numerous inscriptions on the island.
