3.. Area and Subdivisions of Egypt.+
By Captain H. G. Lyons.

EGYPT proper, the country between the mouth of the Nile and
the First Cataract, is a small region with well-defined natural bound-
aries on three sides. 0n the N. is the Mediterranean Sea, on the E.
the Arabian Desert and the Red Sea, and on the W. the Libyan Des-
ert. The S. boundary is not marked by any natural feature, and has
therefore at all ages been liable to alteration. Its fluetuations to the
N. and S. form a kind of standard of the political power of Egypt,
and the causes of the variations involve a great part of Egyptian
history from the most ancient times down to the present day.

When Mohammed Ali, the founder of the modern vassal king-
dom of Egypt (comp. pp. cm: et seq.), died in 1849, he bequeathed
to his successor a power extending far to the S. of the First Cataract
and including not only the Nubian Valley of the Nile, with the Nu-
bian desert-regions, but also the so-called Egyptian Sildin (Bilad
es-SMin, 'land of the blaeks0, consisting of the districts of Téka,
Senntir, and lirordo/'tfn. The Khedive Ismim (p. cxxii) pushed his
boundaries towards the S. until they comprised the whole course of
the White Nile and the greater part of the basin of the Bahr el-
G'hasti, and finally extended to about Y' N. latitude. But the rebellion
of the Arab tribes that broke oat in 1883 under the Mahdi (p. cxxiv)
utterly destroyed the new Egyptian power on the White Nile and
caused the frontier to be withdrawn to Widi 1Jalfa. The cam-
paigns of 1896-98 and the capture of (hndurmtin (p. cxxv), how-
ever, finally united the Stodin with Egypt, though under totally
altered conditions. Thus Egypt strictly so called now includes the
valley of the Nile up to a point 27 M. to the N. of Wadi Halfa, the
desert-strip along the Red Sea, the coast to the W. of Alexandria
as far as the Gulf of Solum, the Libyan Desert with the five Oases,
the greater part of the Sinai Peninsula, and the region of El-‘Arish
(comp. Baedeker's Palestine). Its extreme length is Bio M. (N. lat.
3ioly to 22°), its breadth 596 M. (E.10ng.25°2’ to 340560, and its
area, inclusive of the deserts, ca. 400,000 sq. M. The area of
Egypt proper, excluding the deserts, the oases, and the districts of'
E1-‘Arish, Sinai, MaryM., Mirsa Mat.rtslt, Ed-Daba', and Koseir, is
about 12,000 sq. M. The Stdin, which begins on the Nile a little
to the N. of wadi Haifa and on the Red Sea at 220 N. 1at., is under
a special Anglo-Egyptian administration (comp. p. 415).

From the earliest times Egypt has been divided into two parts
of very unequal size, known as Lower and Upper Egypt. The
boundary between these is still, as in antiquity, to the S. of Cairo.
