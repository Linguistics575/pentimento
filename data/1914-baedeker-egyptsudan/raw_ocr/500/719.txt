'Abbih, Square. EHARTfJM. 34. Route. 429

ieyond the railway are the British barracks and the village of
Burri (Pl. G, 3), with the water-works.

We return from the Gordon Memorial College by Khedive Avenue,
which runs parallel with the Embankment. Here are the Maronite
Church (P1. 13; E, 3) and the new Cathedral Church of All Saints
(Pl. 8-, E, 3), consecrated in 1912, the N. transept of which is the
Gordon Memorial Chapel. In the grounds behind the Sirdir's
Palace is a Statue ofGordon(represe11ted as riding on a camel),
a bronze copy of that executed by E. Onslow Ford in 1890 for the
Royal Engineers' Institute at Chatham. - The grounds behind
the War Offite (p. 428) contain a large Late-Ethiopian Relief,
brought from a pyramid at Meroe (p. d22 . It represents a king
and queen protected by the wings of Isis; to the right is a crowd
of death-gods, relatives, and priests, bearing gifts or celebrating
funeral rites. - Farther on are the National Bank of Egypt (Pl. 12,
D 4; left), the Survey Department (right), the offiety of the Stores
Section (left) and the law-courts, the Irrigation Department, and
the Mhlirtgeh (Pl. 3; D, 3), or office of the mtdtr, all three on
the right.

To the W. of the Grand-HÃ©tel, on the Embankment, lies the
pretty Zoological Garden (P1. 1, C 3; open free), which contains
a representative collection of Sudanese animals. A very attractive
walk is afforded by the Promenade extending to the Magren or
Mugran Point (comp. p. 427), the promontory between the two
arms of the Nile, the different-coloured waters of which are easily
recognizable after their junction. Along the bank are numerous
sakiyehs (comp. p. d27), for watering the fields and palm-groves.
To the left are a Nubian village, picturesquely situated among
palms, and various other settlements.

The business-part of Khartiirn, which is ehiefly inhabited by
Greeks, is restricted to the portion of the town lying to the S. of
Khedive Avenue, and is intersected by the tramway. Its central
point is the large 'Abluh Square (Pl. D, 4), with a handsome Mosque;
to the N.W. are the interesting Markets. The Bazaars are especially
animated in the afternoon.

From the Gordon Statue (see above) Victoria Avenue runs to the
S., crossing the rAbbas Square, and brings us to the Central Rail-
way Station (Pl. D, 4), which may be reached also by the streets
parallel with Victoria Avenue. Beyond the station are the Parade
Ground and Racecourse and the Fortifications constructed by Gordon.
To the right and left are barracks. To the S.E. lie the Sudanese
Villages (Pl. E, 4), known to the natives as Ed-Deim or 'the Camp'.
They shelter various tribes of the St1dtut (Shilluks, Dinkas, Bor-
nawis, Gebelawis, etc.), partly in mud hovels, partly in the charac-
teristic round huts. Native dances may often be witnessed here.

Communication between Khartiim and Omdurman is maintained
by a steam-ferry (p. 426) from the Mogren Point (see above).
