186 Rome 12. BfTTER LAKES. Sues Canal.

A moderate day' s journey (on camels) to the N. E. of El.. Kantara are
situated the ruin-strewn Tell Farama and Tell el- Fadda, occupying the site
at Pelusium. the celebrated eastern seaport and' key to Egypt (comp.
p. cvi), Which now contains no objects of interest.

The canal traverses Lake Balah, now almost entirely drained.
At El-Fe'rdc‘in (p. 179), at the S. end of the fake, the canal passes
through the first cutting. At the next passing-piaee we obtain a
glimpse of the desert.

The hills of E1-G1sr C' the embankment'), which cross the course
of the canal at an average height of 52 ft. above the sea- -1eve],
presented the most serious obstacle to its const111eti011.1n order to
form a cutting through it about 18,800,000 cubic yds. of earth had
to be removed. At the top of the hill is the deserted village of
El-Gris: with a chapel to the Virgin of the Desert and a ruined
mosque. A flight of steps ascends to this point from the canal.
The view hence embraces a great part of the Isthmus, the frowning
'Attlsa Mts. (p. 181] above Suez, the mountains of the Peninsula
of Sinai, the course of the canal, and the green expanse of the
Bitter Lakes.

At the end of the cutting the canal enters Lake Timséh, OT the
Crocodile Lake, the dredged channel through which is indicated by
stakes. As we enter the lake we see the khedivia] chalet (see
p. 179) above us to the right, and to the S. the mountains of Gebel
Abu Balah. The lake, Which is now about 51/2 sq. M. in area and
of a beautiful pale-blue colour, was, before the construction of the
canal, a mere pond of brackish water, and full of reeds. On its N.
bank lies the town of Ismailiyeh(p.179].

After quitting Lake Timsah we pass lr. , the foot of the Gebel
Maryam which an Arabian legend points out as the place where
Miriam, when smitten with Ieporosy for her disapproval of the mar-
riage of Moses with an Ethiopian 1vornan, spent seven days, beyond
the precincts of the camp of the Israelites (Numbers xii). - At
the 85th kilometre is situated (r.) the small village of Tustin, which
is easily recognized by the whitewashed dome of the tomb of a
sheikh. Excavations near Tusc1n have led to the discovery of many
interesting fossil remains of large animals belonging to the mioeene
tertiary formation, and pieces of fossil wood also have been found
here (cemi). p. 118). - A little farther on (near the 90th kilo-
metre) is the cutting Which conducts the canal through the rocky
barrier of the Serapeum (comp. p. 182).

The canal now enters the Large Basin of the Bitter Lakes.
Bmgsch identifies the Bitter Lakes with the Marah of the Bible
l, Exod. xv. 2'i0. At each end of the large basin rises an iron light-
]10use,05 ft. in height. The water is of a bluish- -gree11 colour. The
banks are flat and sandy, but a little to the S. W. (r.) rises the
not unpieturesqne range of the Gebel GeneifehO. 181). The bed
of the Little Bitter Lake, which we next traverse, consists entirely of
shell-formations,
