332 Route 21. ERMENT. From Luxor

'Sea-horn Thetis, learn that Memnon never suffered pangs of dying'.

'Still, where Libyan mountains vise, sounds the voice of his loud crying'

â€˜(Mountains which the Nile-stream, laving, parts from Thebes, the hun-
dved-gated)'

'When he glows, through rays maternal with warm light illuminated'.

'But thy son who, never-sated, dreadful battle still was seeking',

'Dumb in Troy and Thessaly, rests now, never speaking'.

Among the ruins in the neighbourhood of the colossi are the
remains of' another Statue of great size, lying about 3 min. to the
w., amidst arable land. Close by is a large Sandstone Stale, now
broken in two, which is almost the only relic, of the temple in front
of which the above-mentioued statues stood. The hieroglyphics and
the representations refer to the dedication of the temple. In the
rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears receiving the symbol of life
from Amon on the right and from Soker-0siris 011 the left; above
are the winged sun-disk and the name of Amenophis III. Behind
the Pharaoh in each case is his consort Teye. - Still farther to the
N.W., at the foot of the Libyan mountains, are two fragments of an
ancient brick building, known as K6m el-Heipdn.

121/2 M. Erment (Arrnant). The town (12,300 inhab.), with
an important sugar-factory and post and telegraph otlices, lies on
the left bank of the river. This town was called in antiquity On,
or, to distinguish it from On (Heliopolis) in Lower Egypt (p. 120),
the Upper Egyptian On or Per-Mont (i.e. 'House of' Mont'), whence
the Greek name Hermonthis was formed. Its deity was the falcon-
headed Mont, god of war. In the Roman imperial period it was the
vapital of a province.

The bank is shaded by stately lebulih-trees. From the point
where the bazaar reaches the bank of the river a flightof steps, in-
corporating several ancient sculptured fragments, descends to the
stream. The large temple-buildiugs, dating from the Ptolemaic and
imperial periods, which lay about 11/2 M. to the N.E., have been al-
most entirely destroyed, the stones being used to build the sugar-
factory.
