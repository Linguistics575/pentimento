the church is crowded. Beyond the nave, and raised by a few steps,
is the choir (Pl. k) where the priests ofiieiate, and which is adjoined
by the Heikal, or sanctuary (P1. 1), containing the altar, and by two
side-chapel-s, that on the left (Pl. m) surmounted by an Arabian
dome. In the apse of the sanctuary rise several steps, in amphi-
theatrical fashion, towards the place which in European churches
is occupied by the episcopal throne, and in the present case by a
picture of Christ. The sanctuary and the side-chapels are shut off
by wooden screens, panelled and richly adorned with carvings in
wood and ivory. The finest and oldest of these are on the screen
to the left of the sanctuary; besides ornamental designs they have
representations of the Nativity, St. Demetrius, St. George (Mllrt
Girgis), St. Theodore C'0, and the Eucharist. Above the door to the
right side-chapel(P1.n), engraved in wood, is the Ceptic inscription,
‘Greetings to the Temple of God, the Fatherl' Below it is an Arabic
inscription with the date 1195. The church contains also some
interesting Byzantine carving and mosaics in ivory, 110w blackened
and discoloured with age. Anumber ofoldpictures of saints, some
of them on a gold ground and with well-preserved colours, possess
no artistic value. The guide expects a fee of 1 pias. from each
visitor, who places also 1 pias. in the collection- -p1ate.

Steps (Pl. q, r) descend to the Crypt (often flooded), a small
vaulted chapel with marble columns under the choir consisting of
nave and aisles. At the end of the nave is an altar 'in' the form of
an early-Christian tomb-niche, Which tradition indicates as the spot
where the Virgin and Child reposed; in the centre of the aisles are
apses. The right aisle contains the font, into which, according to
the Coptic ritual, the child to be baptized is dipped three times.

The citadel contains several other basilicas, used by Coptic and
Jewish congregations, but interesting only to those who are making
a special study of this kind of architecture. Among them we may
mention the churches of St. Barbara (Sitteh Barbara, Pl. C,'?. e;
restored), containing good carvings and paintings, Mari Girgis
(St. George), and El-Mya (P1. c, i). The Jews say that Elijah
once appeared in the modern Synagogue (Esh-Shamydn or Ken'lset
Elidhu), and show a place in it where Moses is said to have prayed.

About 20 yds. to the right of Abu Sergeh we enter a pietur-
esque lane on the left, which leads to a low-lying iron-bound door
I Entrée on the Plan, 11.1.06) Thence a road leads to the N. , past
the rubbish heaps of the ancient Fu std: (p. 44), and after ca.1/2 M.
reaches the white and red striped W. facade of the externally in-
significant mosque ofAmr (comp. Pl. C, i),whieh has three entrances.
Visitors usually enter by the S. (1.)e11trance, below the minaret.

The Gemi' 'Amr ibn oi-a, or Mosque of Amr, owes its name
to the general of the Caliph Omar, though not a trace now remains
of the original mosque, which was only 50 ells long and 30 ells
