118 Route 5. PETRIFIED FOREST. Environs

About 100 paces to the right, at the foot of the mountain-slope behind
the tombs of the Caliphs, which we ascend on this side past some large
lime-kilns, we may trace the high-water level of the sea. in the pliocene
age, 235 ft. above the present sea-le1yel, on a rocky face of the nnmmulite
plateau, thickly dotted over with hbles made by boring shells.

Following the path to the right, we observe a yellowish hill at
the foot of the spurs of the Mohattam and reach it in 1/4 hr. more.
This hill stands at the mouth of the narrow, winding valley, 3/4 M.
in length, through which the path to the Spring of Moses ascends
Over large blocks of stone and rubble. The ravine terminates in a
lofty amphitheatre of rock. Here is a cleft in the rock from which
trickle a few drops of bitter and brackish water, quite arbitrarily
named the Spring of Moses ('Ain Mata).

In order to reach the smaller Petrified Forest we return to the
month of the gorge and proceed towards the S.E., skirting the
slopes of the Mokattam, which are here more precipitous. We first
pass a black projecting rock, which has a glazed appearance, and
then a square gap in the rock, beyond which we observe opposite
to us gently sloping hills, consisting of limestone, marl, and beds
of fossil oysters. The route ascends between these hills and soon
reaches the plateau of the Gebel el-Khashab, where the scattered
fragments of fossil wood indicate the beginning of the Little Petri-
fied Forest. These trunks and fragments have been referred by
Unger to an extinct tree, which he named the Nicolia Ailgyptiaea
and regarded as akin to the bombaceaa. The petrifaction is now
generally supposed to have occurred during the later tertiary period
under the action of silicious geysers, resembling those to be seen to-
day in the Yellowstone Park of North America. The silieated trunks
lie in a secondary stratum, the overlying strata in which they were
originally embedded having disappeared in the course of the desert

denudation.

Crossing the plateau of the Petrified Forest for about 20 min. more
towards the S., we suddenly reach the S. slopes of the Mohattam, through
a gap in which a path descends into the Wadi et-Tih, or 'valley of wan-
derings' (more correctly Wadi Digla). This valley stretches to the W.
towards the valley of the Nile, and begins at the hills of Gharabtm, like
the parallel Wiidi Hof (p. 170), which dehouches to the N. of Irelwiin.
On the S. horizon rise the hills of Tura (p. 170), recognizable by the old
Mameluke fortress on their right spur and by two heights exactly opposite
to us, of which that to the left somewhat resembles a coffin in shape while
that to the right is hemispherical. Crossing the bottom of the valley in
this direction (8.), we perceive in the Tura hills the entrance to adesert
gorge, bounded by lofty and precipitous slopes. This valley extends for
many miles in various windings, communicates with the ravines of the
desert which begin in the Gebel Hof near I.Telwiin, and is abundantly
stocked with the plants peculiar to the desert.

We may return to Cairo from the Little Petrified Forest through
the Wiidi et-Tih (see above), skirting the S. and W. slopes of the
Mokattam and passing the Jewish cemetery and the tombs of the
Mamelukes. Another return-route leads across the Mohattam hills
If we choose the latter we quit the Petrified Forest by a hollow to th

W., and ascend over ridges to a plateau, stretching towards the W
