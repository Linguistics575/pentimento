The Island of Philse.

Philae, once the 'pearl of Egypt', is 500 yds, in length and 160 yds.
in breadth, and consists of a crystalline granite mixed with horn-
blende, beneath the alluvial deposits of the Nile. The modern name
is borrowed from the Creeks, and is derived from the ancient Egyp-
tian Pi-lak, or the 'island of Lak'. The Gopts called it Pilakh, Le.
'the cornerâ€˜, and the Arabs used to call it BilaIc.

Now-a-days the island is called El-{t'asr or Geztret Anus el-Wogtd, after
the hero of one of the tales in the Thdusand and One Nights, which has
its scene transferred to Philee in the Egyptian version. The name Philae
is known to the natives only through its use by tourists.

The boatmen relate it as follows. Once upon a time there was a
king, who had a handsome favourite named Anus el-Woggd, and a vizier,
whose daughter was named Zahr el-Ward, Le. Flower of the Rose. The
two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found oppor-
tunities of meeting secretly, until they were discovered through the im-
prudence of the maiden's attendant. The vizier was violently enraged
and, in order to secure his daughter from the further pursuit of the
young man, despatched her to the island of Philar, where he caused her
to be imprisoned in a strong castle (the temple of Isis) and closely
guarded. But Anas el-World could not forget his love. He forsook the
court and wandered far and wide in search of her, and in the course of
his travels showed kindness to various animals in the desert and else-
where. At last a hermit told him that he would find Zahr el-Ward on
the island ofPhilte. He arrived on the bank of the river and beheld the
walls of the castle, but was unable to reach the island, for the water all
around it was alive with crocodiles. As he stood lamenting his fate one of
the dangerous monsters offered to convey him to the island on his back, out
of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness to animals. The lover
was thus able to reach the prison of his mistress, and the guards suffered
him to remain on the island, as he represented himselfto be a persecuted
merchant from a distant land. Birds belonging to Zahr el-Ward assured
him that she was on the island, but he could never obtain sight of her.
Meanwhile the lady also became unable longer to endure her fate. Letting
herself down from her prison-window by means of a rope made of her
clothes, she found a compassionate ship-master, who conveyed her from
the island in which the lover she sought then was. Then followed another
period of search and finally the meeting of the lovers. A marriage, with
the consent of the father, ends the tale.

The name ofPhila: does not occur in any of the earlier inscrip-
tions, and even Herodotus, who visited Elephantine during his
journey on the Nile (ea. 450 B.C.), makes no mention of this island.
The first mention of Phila dates from the reign of Nektamyhi5s
tea. 350 B.G.; p. cvii), to which the oldest temple buildings on the
island belong. But there is little doubt that Philae was inhabited
and adorned with temples at an earlier period than that.

The chief deity of Philee was the goddess Isis; but Osiris and Nephthys,
Hathor (p. 370), Khnum and Satet, the gods of the cataracts, and other
deities were likewise worshipped here. The imposing buildings which
lend the island its characteristic appearance were erected by the Ptole-
mies during the last two centuries RC. and the Roman emperors during
the first three Christian centuries. Numerous inscriptions inform us that
Ereek and Roman pilgrims floeked in crowds to the shrine of the mysteri-
ous, benign, and healing goddess Isis. We know also that the goddess of
Philae was worshipped hy the predatory Nubians and by the Blemmyes
(p. 386), and that, even after their battles with the Emperor Marcian
