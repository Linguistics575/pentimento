ing a catafalque above the vaulted tombs in which the deceased
are placed with due attention to the separation of the sexes. The
chapel is covered by a dome, the transition to which from the
square ground-plan is effected by means of a delicately articulated
intermediate construction tapering gradually to an octagon. In
the examples dating from the Fatimite period, the pendentives
corresponding to the four bevelled angles of the intermediate struc-
ture retain the large spherical niches borrowed from Roman and
Byzantine models. These were replaced, under the Aiyuhides, by
several rows of prism-shaped niches, and finally, under the Mame-
lukes, by more or less complicated arrangements of stalaetite-pen-
dentives. These last are formed by a system of gradually projecting
courses of stone, embellished by dwarf domes and niches exhibiting
a very great variety of proor-outline.

The oldest mosques seem to have had no Minarets (Mridna).
The earlier examples of these towers were square throughout, taper-
ing upwards, and were covered by a simple conical roof. The later
examples are square at the base but assume a cylindrical or poly-
gonal form in the upper stories, and are embellished with galleries
supported by stalaetite-eornice8 and with balconies; the top story is
formed of columns or pilasters bearing a roof consisting of a dome-
shaped protuberance. The minarets contain winding staircases, two
being sometimes arranged round the same newel for the convenience
of the blind men who are preferred as Muezzi-ns (Muâ€™eddin, p.1xxxvii).
The wooden rods and hooks on' the galleries and top stories are used
for hanging up the lamps during the fasting month of Ramadan.

Since the end of the 14th cent., following the example set by
the mosque of the Emir fht'i el-Ytlseii at Cairo (1366), every mosque
has possessed a Sebil, or public fountain, except in cases when a
separate building is erected for this. The sebils are rooms with
bronze railings at which passers-by may obtain water. The upper
story of the sebil is a kind ofloggia, supported by columns and COW"
ered with a tent- roof, frequently in elegant timber- architecture.
This is the Kuttdb, or elementary school. The detached columns that
often embellish the exterior of these buildings differentiate them
from all the other parts of the mosque-fagade, in which columns
appear only built into the angles or immured in the masonry.

Tombs. The tombs of sultans and emirs and of their families
are invariably built in connection with mosques (p. clxxxi). On the
other hand the Shaikh Tombs or tombs of saints (p. sci), which are
found in all parts of the country, are independent structures, usually
built on the spot on which the revered deceased ended his days.
These closely resemble the mortuary chapels of the mosques and are,
like them, covered with domes. The ordinary tombs of the Moslems
are generally situated on high ground, beyond the iuiluenee of the
moisture of' the river, and preferably in the desert. The subterranean
vaulted chambers are generally large enough for four or more bodies,
