*GALLERY OF THE KINGS, entered from the left side of the second
hypostyle hall, between the second and third row of columns. On

censer, and the crown-prinee Ramses (with the side-loek of youth)
reciting hymns from a papyrus-roll, are seen reveriug their royal
ancestors, the names of 70 of whom are inscribed in the two upper
rows. The list begins with Menes, the first king of Egypt, and ex-
tends down to Sethos, the names of unimportant or illegitimate rulers
being omitted. Above the list is the inscription: 'The performance
of the prayer for the dead - May Ptah-Stoker-Osiris, lord ofthe tomb,
who dwells in the temple ofSethos, increase the gifts for the kings
of Upper and Lower Egypt --- by King Sethos; 1000toaves ot'bread,
1000 barrels of beer, 1000 rattle, 1000 geese, 1000 incense-offer-
ings, etc., by King, Sethos for King Meuesâ€™ etc. (here follows the
list). In the lowest row the phrases 'by King, Men- -ma- re ,'by the
sen of Re, Sethos' are repeated over and over again.

This list of kings is of great historical importance, as par tly by its

aid it has been possible to fix the order of succession of the Egyptian
kings. Another similar list is mentioned at p. 275.
