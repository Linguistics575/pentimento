(see below). Uzesar was afterwards conquered by the, charms of the
Egyptian queen, but Antony fell more fatally into her toils and
spent years of reve)ry with her at Alexandria (42-30). Augustus
enlarged the city by the addition of the suburb of Nicopolis (see below
and p. 25). At this prosperous period Alexandria is said to have
numbered more than halt-a-million inhabitants. The Greek element
predominated, next in importance to which was the Egyptian, while
a numerous, but exclusive. Jewish community was settled here as
early as the 4th cent. ll.C.

The Greek scholar and traveller Strubo describes Alexandria as it was
in the decades immediately before the beginning of our era, in the 17th Book
of his Geography. The former island of Pharos had been united to the
mainland by an embankment known as the Heptastadium (see below), and
nu the E. extremity of the island rose the famous lighthouse built of
white limestone by Sostratus, the Cnidian, in the reign of Ptolemy II.
l’hiladelphus (completed in 280-279 B.C.), which was regarded by the an-
cients as One of the wonders of the world, and gave its name of 'Pharos'
tn all lighthouses afterwards erected. Its three-storied design became later
the model for the Egyptian minaret (p. clxxxii). Its original height is said
to have been 1100 ells (590 ft.) and, though even in antiquity it threatened
more than once to collapse part of the ancient tower still stood erect after
the great earthquakes of 1303 and I326. This was overwhelmed by the sea
a little later, and the present fortifications ('Fort ilu Phare' or 'Fort Kait
tiey‘) were erected near its site in the 15th century. The Heptastadimn,
a vast embankment seven stadia (1-100 yds.) in length, as its name imports,
was constructed by Ptolemy Soter or by his son Philadelphus. It was
pierced by two passages, both bridged over, and before Caesar‘s time served
also as an aqueduct. Having since that period been artificially enlarged
by débris from the ancient city, thrown into the sea, as well as by natural
deposits, it has attained a width of more than 1600 yds. and new forms
the site of a great part of the modern city.

Among the PRINCIPAL QUARTI'ZRS of the ancient city Straho partic-
ularly mentions the Necropotis or city of the dead, at the extreme w.
end, 'where there are manv gardens, tombs, and establishments for em-
hahning bodies'; Ilhakotis, (the quarter of Alexandria situated above the
ships" magazines‘. ehiefly inhabited by Egyptians (comp. p. 12); the Royal
City (Regia; afterwards called Bruchium), which was subsequently walled
in and contained the palaces and public buildings, on the mainland
between the promontory of Luehias and the Heptastadium; the Jews'
Quarter, situated to the E. of the Loehias. Outside the Canopic gate, on
the E., lay the hippodrmue, and farther to the E., 30 stadia from Alexan-
dria, was the suburb of Nicopolis 1p. 25), which possessed 1trt amphi-
heatre and a race-eonrse.

The town was regularly built, with slreets intersecting each other
at right angles. The main artery of iraffie seems to have been the long
street beginning at the Canopic gate t_comp. p. 20).

Of the PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS of ancient Alexandria the scanty relics
of a few only can be identified. The Paneum is doubtless identical
with the modern Kain ed-DN (p. 20). The Gymnasium probably lay to
the W. of this point. The theatre, the Sema, and the Museum were all
three situated in the 'Royal City' (see above). The Alexandrian Theatre
lay opposite the island of Antirrhodns, so that the spectators had a fine
view of the sea in the background. The Sema, which lay "ear the royal
palace, probably to the W. of the present Government Hospital (p. 20),
was an enclosed space, within which were the tombs of Alexander the
Great and of the I’tolemies.

The Museum, the site of which cannot be satisfactorily determined,
contained 'a hall for wulking, another for. sitting, and a large building
with the refeelory ol' the scholars residing at the Museum'. Connected
