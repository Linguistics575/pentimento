346 Route 22. EDFU. Temple

left of the entrance are two small Chapels. One (Pl. d) is the 'thm-
seeratien Chamber“, as is indicated by the reliefeu the rear wall, re-
presenting Horus (L) and Theut (1.) pouring consecrated water upon
the king. The chapel to the right (P1. e) was the library; upon its
walls is a catalogue of the books preserved here. On the left wall
Seshet, goddess of literature, appears writing upon a palm-branch.
- A side-door (Pl. f) in the E. wall of the hall admits to the inner
passage (p. 347) round the temple. -- Above the door in the N.
wall of the vestibule is a curious representation. Ptolemy Philo-
pater offers an image of the goddess of truth to the boat of the sun,
which appears guided by two figures of the falcon-headed Horus as
pilot and helmsman. In the boat the sun is adored by Thout (1.) and
Neith (r.). In an attitude of worship, at the sides, are Four Senses:
to the right sight and hearing, to the left taste and reason.

Next follows the, Hypostyle Hall, the roof of which is borne
by 1‘2, columns with rich floral capitals. Apertures near the top of
the walls and in the ceiling admit light to this hall. The represent-
ations on the walls resemble those of the preceding great vestibule.
Of the adjoining side-t1ambers, two (P1. XVIII and xxx) served as
accesses to the inner passage round the temple, one (Pl. XVII) was a
laboratory, while from another (P1. xx) the great E. staircase led up
to the roof of the temple (comp. p. 347).

On each side of the adjoining FIRSTAN'I‘ECHAMBER is an approach
to one of the Staircases leading to the temple-roof. The mural re-
liefs on the staircases resemble the corresponding reliefs at Den-
dera (p. 249). On that on the E. (P1. XVI) is a procession of priests
ascending, headed by the king; 011 that en the W. CPI. mi) is the
same descending. The corridors and chambers on the roof contain
nothing of interest, those to the E. were probably intended for the
cult of Osiris. - On the E. of the SECOND ANTECHAMBER we enter
a small Sacrificial Court, in which (to the N.) is an elegant little
Kiosque, with two columns with floral capitals supporting the roof.
Upon the ceiling is Nut, goddess of the sky, beneath whom appear
various forms of the sun in boats. - To the left of the Second An-
techamher is a small Room (P1. XI) dedicated to the god Min.

In the Sanctuary the most interesting Reliefs are those in the
lower row on the right (E.) wall. i. The king (Philopator) removes
the lock from the shrine of Horus. 2. He opens the door of the
shrine. 3. He stands in a reverential attitude, with pendent arms,
before the god. 4. He offers incense to his deified parents, Euergetes I.
and Bereniee. 5. He offers incense before the sacred boat of Hathor.
By the rear wall is a granite shrine (Pl. o, with a pointed roof,
dedicated to Horus by King Nelrht-ITar-ehbét. This is a relic of
the original pre-mole/le temple (p. 3-14). In front of the shrine
is a pedestal of dark granite (found in another part of the temple),
intended to support the sacred heat and indicated by an inscription
as the votive gift of a private citizen.
