Farther on we have a view, to the right, of the Pyramids of

excursion to the flnely shaped Pyramid of hfeithim.

A VISIT TO s1IEtDijht may be accomplished in ahout5 hrs. on donkey-
back. Crossing the railway, we proceed in about 11/4 hr. to the pyramid,
which rises on the soil of the desert close to the cultivated country and
11/2 M. to the NW. of the village of 2feidthn.

The Pyramid of 1tteidiun, in all probability the utsftnished and never
used tomb of Snofru, the predeeessor of Kheops, is so different from all
the other structures of the kind that it is called by the Arabs EI-Haram
el-Kadddb, or the False Pyramid. It censists of three (originally seven)
square receding stories, which rise to a. height of 214 ft. 8 in. in smooth
and steep stages at an angle of 'M'' 10'. The lirst section is 81 n. (l in., the
seeond 98 ft. 11 in., while the third, now almost entirely destroyed, is
31 ft. 3 in. in height. The outer walls consist of admirably jointed and
polished blocks of limestone. The examinations by Maspero and Petrie
prove that the Pyramid of 11eidiln1 was pillnged as early as in the time of
the 20th Dynasty. On its E. side is the small Mortuary Temple of Snofru,
new again covered up. This temple, built of blocks of limestone, consists
of two bare chambers leading to an open court immediately adjoining
the pyramid. The mastabas, or tombs of courtiers and off1eials of Snofru,
to the N. and E. of the pyramid, are now likewise covered with sand.

On the E. bank of the Nilts,oppositeWlsea and about It/s, M. from
the river, lies the hamlet of Atfih (4300 iuhab.), on a canal, with
some mounds of earth and debris representing the ancient Aphrodi-
topolis, named after Hathor-Aphrodite, who was worshipped here.

The Egyptian name of the town was Tep-yeh or I'er-Bathor nebt Tep-yeh,
tie. ‘Houee of Hathor, mistress of Tep-yeh', whence the shortened Coptic
Petpeh and Arabic Atfih. Strabo states that a white cow, sacred to Hathor,
was worshipped here.

In the Christian period (ca. 310 A.D.) Aphroditopolis gained some cel..
