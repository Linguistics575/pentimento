390 M. Ip1ftf0ift, Kaft), the ancient Koptos (Egypt. h"elit?iyew),
situated beyond the Shanhuriyeh Canal. Though now of no import-
ance (pop. 8934), this place was in remote antiquity a flourishing
commercial town, and down to the Graco-Roman period was one
of the chief emporia fur the wares of Arabia and India. It stood.
under the protection of the ithyphallic harvest-god Min (Pad), who
was also the patron of travellers in the desert. During the great
rebellion in Upper Egypt under Diocletian 292 A.Di) Koptos was
besieged and destroyed, but it quickly recovered from the blow.
Down to the time of the Caliphs it remained a populous trading-
town. The extant ruins are of no great interest.

At Eoptos the ereat earavan-routes through the Arabian Desert. to
the seaports on the Red Sea quitted the Nile valley. The chief goals of
the caravans were the Sinaitie peninsula and the land of Punt (Pwenet),
situated about the modern Somali Coast, which yielded incense, ivory,
ebony, panther-skins, etc., and was regarded by the Egyptians as a land
offabulous wonders, like India. Other caravans made for the Wadi 1.1am-
mamas in the desert, which produced tt hard stone much prized by the
Egyptian sculptors (comp. p. 371). At a later period the caravan-tmade
was diverted to the routes viii [ills and finally to those viii lieneh.

(il. 1331) this town, of which now heaps of' ruins alone remain,
was second in size only to Fustit (Cairo) and was the chief centre
of the Arabian trade. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions
have been built into the houses of thetown; and the mosque contains
a basin formed of a single stone, with the name of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus upon it.
