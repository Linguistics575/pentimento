on steps descend into a VAULTED CHAMBER (Pl. 2), supported by pillars and
containing the ‘Lid of the Royal Bavcqphagus, on which the figure of the
ruler rests as on a mattress. The lid, which, as usual, is in the form of
a eartouche (p. cxxvi), is beautifully executed in pink granite. The face is
very impressive when lighted up by electricity. The chambers adjoining
and behind the Vaulted Chamber are unimportant and inaccessible.

I/ ‘_f‘7“‘3\: by British scholars, following the
' ",n traditions of the Romans, the Tomb
of Mannon, as Ramses VI. bore the
same przenomen as Amenophis III.
(p. cii), who was called Memnon by
the Greeks. The tomb, which Was
originally intended for Ramses V., is
distinguished by the excellent pre-
servation of its coloured reliefs.

Three Commons (P1. A, B, 0) lead
to an ANTECIIAMBER (Pl. D) and then on
to the Fms'r PILLARED ROOM (Pl. E),
with which the original construction of
Ramses V. ended. On the left walls
of these chambers appears the journey
of the sun through the realms of the dead
as related in the 'Book of the Gates'
(p. 284). On the walls to the right are
other texts and pictures relating to the
world beyond the tomb. On three pillars
in the Pillared Room is seen the king
saerificing to the gods of the dead; the
ceiling is adorned with astronomical
tables. Two Conmons (Pl. P, G), the
walls of which depict the Subterranean
journey of the god of the sun, accord-
ing to the 'Book of him who is in the
Underworld', lead to a SECOND VESTIBULE
(P1. H), the walls of which are covered
with inscriptions and scenes from the
'Book of the Dead'. The wall to the
left is occupied by chapter 125, which
deals with the justification of the de-
ceased before the judges of the dead.
Next comes the SECOND PILLARED RooM
(Pl. o, still containing remnants of the
great granite sarcophagus. On the walls
are astronomical representations. On the
right wall appears the boat of the sun,
in which the sun-god stands in the shape
of a beetle with a ram's head, and is
worshipped by two human-headed birds,
the souls of the sun-gods Khepre and
Atum. The boat is being drawn across
the heavens, which are supported by two lions, and descends to the left.
In the rear wall is a. niche (Pl. K). On the ceiling the goddess of the sky
appears twice, representing the sky by day and by night, with the hours. --
This tomb contains numerous Greek and Coptic inscriptions .
