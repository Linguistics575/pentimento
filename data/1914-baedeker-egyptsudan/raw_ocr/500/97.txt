which are considered sacred, having been placed there by devout
persons or by those who have made vows. About the end of the
18th century a reaction against the abuses of Islam sprang up in
Central Arabia. The Wahabis, named after their founder 'Abd
el-Wahhttb, endeavoured to restore the religion to its original pur-
ity; they destroyed all tombs of saints, including even those of
Mohammed and lloseiu, as objects of superstitious reverence, and
sought to restore the primitive simplicity of the Prophet's code of
morals. As a political power, however, they were suppressed by
Mohammad Ali o. exxi).

Another development quite foreign to the original spirit of
lslém is that of the RELIGIOUS ORDERS (Tarulc, sing. '1.'ur'il.ut), or
Orders of Dervishes. Starting with the Christian doctrine of as-
eetieism (hence Daru%h, Falcir, poor man, Stiff, man in a woollen
shirt), the mystics early borrowed Neo-Platonie LDionysos Aree-
pagita) and subsequently also Buddhist ideas. Even the Buddhist
nirvana was adopted under the form of (ant, the destruction of
individuality. As a natural consequence pantheistie and other
heresies found their way into Islim. The orthodox party long
opposed the recognition of the mystics, and mysticism did not effect
its footing until the time of the celebrated philosopher Ghazzali.
To-day all those orders that accept the formulae of the faith and the
received doctrine of religious duties are recognized as orthodox.
Each order has its own fixed system, with an ascending series of
degrees. A man may reach the lower degrees in several different
orders, the higher degrees in one only. A member enters an order
with a view to obtain a share in the blessings of certain forms,
which have been consecrated by the founder of the order and are
maintained in its traditions. The sikrs, or religious exercises, are
directed towards producing a state of mental excitement by means
of pious invocations or dancing (hence howling dervishes, dancing
dervishes; comp. p. Tl); the souls of those who reach a condition
of ecstasy are considered to be absorbed in the Deity. These orders
represent in the East the religious and other associations of Europe;
and this fact is the key to their signiiieanee. They are more im-
portant eeonotnieally than politically, though great political move-
ments, even in recent times, have been brought about by organi-
zations resembling these orders, as, e.g., the insurrection of the
Mahdi at khart.tim. The original orders were few, but numerous
subdivisions have in course of time established themselves on an
independent footing. 1n Egypt alt the orders are under the Control
of the Shaikh et-Bekrt, who is the political representative of their
interests and presides at public functions.

The following are the principal orders of dervishes (l.twi.kat ed-dartiwt"sh)
in Egypt: -

er-Rifairi el-kehtr, are recognizable by their black flags and black, dark
