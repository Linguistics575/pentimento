iiv H. GEOGRAPHICAL AGO b, Modern Egyptians;

whose amiability and intelligence are, then superseded by sullcnness
and obstinacy. Thus down to a few years ago, as in the time of
Ammianus Marcellinns, the fellah would often suffer the most cruel
blows in dogged silence rather than pay the taxes demanded of him.

In his own fields the fellah is an industrious labourer, and his
work is more continuous than that of the peasant of more northern
countries. He enjoys no period of repose during the winter, and the
whole of his spare time is occupied in drawing water for the irriga-
tion of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to im-.
prove his systerir of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the
most necessary tasks he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will
do the remainder of his work for him. The fellah is generally of a
peaceful disposition, kindly and helpful to his neighbour. Foreigners
can see his best side only by observing his dealings with his fellows;
for he regards strangers as merely so many convenient sources of
profit (comp. pp. xxiv, XXV).

[2). COPTs ([cibt, 'ihy. While we have regarded the fellahin as
genuine Egyptians in consequence of their uninterrupted occupation
of the soil, the religion of the Copts affords us an additional guarantee
for the purity of their descent. The Copts are undoubtedly the most
direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians, there being no ground
for the assn mption that their ancestors were foreign immigrants who
embraced Christianity after the conquest of the country by the
Mohammedans, while on the other hand the obstinacy with Which
they defended their monophysite Christianity for several centuries
against the inroads of the creed of Byzantium affords another
indieationyt their Egyptian character. At the last census (1907) the
number of Copts in Egypt was 708,321+ They are most numerous
in the towns of Upper Egypt (554,282), around the ancient Koptos,
at Nalphleh, Luxor, Esneh, Dendera, Girgeh, Tahta, and particularly
at Assitlt and Akhmim.

The Coptie Patriarch is elected from their own number by the monks
of the five chief monasteries of Egypt. These are the monasteries of St.
Anthony andi8t. Paul in the eastern desert o, 206), two in the witdi Natriin
(p. 32), and..the convent of El-Nellarrals (p. 219), near Nanfah1.t.

iMost of the Copts:that dwell in towns are engaged in the more
refined handicrafts [as watchmakers, goldsmiths, jewellers, f3121-
hroiderers, tailors, weavers, cabinet-makers, tumors, etc.), or in
trade, or as clerks, accountants, and notaries. Tlseir physique is
accordingly materially different from that of the fellahin and even
from that of Coptic peasants. They are generally of more delicate
frame, with small hands and feet; their necks are longer and their
skulls are higher and narrower than those of the peasantry; and,
