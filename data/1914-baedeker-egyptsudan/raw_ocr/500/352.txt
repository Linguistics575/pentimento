134 Route 6. PYRAMIDS 0F GiZEH. Third Pyramid.

Immediately before the latter is reached a flight of seven steps leads to
the right to a chamber with recesses 0n the right and back walls. The
tomb-chamber is paved with blocks of granite, 21/2 ft. in thickness, and
its ceiling has been formed by placing the stones against each other at an
angle so as to resemble a roof and then hollowing them out on the inside
in the form of a Gothic arch. The richly decorated sarcophagus of Men-
kewre was found here by Col. Vyse in a good state of preservation. It
was made of basalt and measured externally 2ft. 7 in. in height. The
lid was gone. Fragments of the inner wooden coffin and of the royal
mummy (now in the British Museum) were found in the chamber e.
The vessel in which the sarcophagus was being conveyed to England
was unfortunately lost off the coast of Spain.

The original intention of the builder was to construct a pyramid on
a small scale, containing only the sloping corridor 1k, leading to a cham-
ber at e, smaller than that now existing. But when a larger pyramid was
projected the corridor abcd was formed, leading first to an antechamher
and then to a tomb-chamber at c, enlarged by deepening the eariier
chamber at that point. Under the New Empire the interior of the pyramid
was ruined by the forcible entry of treasure-seekers; but probably during
the Saite period a restoration took place. To this restoration are due the
sloping shaft and the granite chamber fi) in Which the stone sarcophagus
of Menkewrii was concealed, as well as the lower-lying room with the
recesses.

The Seeond and Third Pyramids are most conveniently visited in
the course of the circuit of the Pyramid plateau mentioned at p. 137.
After inspecting the Great Pyramid visitors usually proceed along
its E. side to the Sphinx, which rises from amidst the sand of the
desert about 350 yds. to the S.E.
