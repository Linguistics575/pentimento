Clxxiv VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART.

the Museum at Cairo (No. 451, p. 85; No. 491, p.86; No. 456, p. 85),
besides a few other specimens in European museums. In many
cases the artists have abandoned an attempt to produce a faithful
portrait in favour of ideal beauty, devoting much of their energy
to the representation of the coiffure, the ornaments, and the flowing
garments then fashionable. Many new types were invented in this
period, such as the figure of a man crouching on the ground and
enveloped in a voluminous mantle.

After the 20th Dyn. art steadily declined until the time of the
Ethiopian monarchs, when it again revived under the inspiration of
the models of the Ancient and Middle Empires. At last began a
later period of bloom, which has justly been styled the period of the
EGYPTIAN RENAISSANCE (p. ci). The prevalent tendency at this
epoch was towards a careful study of portraiture, and it produced
some extraordinarily good work, especially in the 26th Dyn., in the
portraits of bald-headed priests, in which the characteristic points
(such as the shape of the skull) are indicated in a masterly manner,
while the less significant details are ignored. The best specimens
of this great style of art are now in Berlin, and with the exception
of the fine head of the aged Mentemhét (No. 1084, p. 89) and a few
smaller statues there are unfortunately no examples of it in the
Cairo Museum, where the traveller will find only insipid, sim-
pering productions of the Egyptian Renaissance. - Though these
realistic works show no trace of Greek influence, the development
of sculpture from the time of the Ptolemies on shows the influence
of Greek art in an ever-increasing degree. Side by side with
purely Greek works (chiefly in Alexandria) and purely Egyptian
works, the sculptors of which clung anxiously and mechanically to
the ancient style, we meet with specimens of a peculiar hybrid
Graaco-Egyptian style, in which the figures are Greek in attitude
and Egyptian iu drapery, coiffure, and adornment, or vice versfl.
However valuable these may be for an appreciation of Egyptian
civilization at a late period, they certainly carry no satisfaction to
the eye intent upon artistic effects.

Beliefs and Paintings. Egyptian reliefs are either Bas-Reliefs,
the earliest and at all periods the commonest form, or Incised Beliefs
(‘reliefs en creux'), in which the design is sunk below the surface.
This form, which is peculiar to Egypt, first appears under the 4th
Dyn. and always serves as a cheap substitute for bas-reliefs. The
sculptors of the New Empire, however, have often succeeded in
producing very attractive effects by the skilful use of its peculi-
arities. Egyptian relief attained its highest point under the 5th
Dyn. (p. xcix). The high level of technical and artistic skill at
that period is best illustrated in the mastahas of Ti and Ptahhotep
at Sablrira (pp. 149, 163), and in the reliefs from the mortuary
temples of the kings of the 5th Dyn. (p. 82). Under the 6th Dyn.
and during the Middle Empire the execution of the reliefs had
