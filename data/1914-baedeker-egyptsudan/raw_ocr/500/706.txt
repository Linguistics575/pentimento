420 Route 32. DONGOLA. From B1tdi Hazra

further to the s., Napate began to decline; and although it afterwards
became the seat of the court more than once and though it remained
throughout the religious centre of the kingdom, it never regained its former
prosperity. The extant ruins include many pyramids, differing from those
of Egypt by their slender form, and several temples, of which those built
by Ramses Il. and by Taharka are specially noteworthy. Cailliaud ex-
plored the site in 1822 and Lepsius in 1844 and excavations are now being
made under the auspices of the University of Oxford.

Fnom KAREIEIA TO Kenna vii Merowe and Dongola, government steamer
twice weekly in winter in 21/2 days (upstream about 4 days). Passengers
must cater for themselves. There is also a frequented caravan-route from
Kareima to Dongola. The first station is (ii N.) Merawe (rest-house),
capital of the province of Dongola, on the left bank of the Nile, beside
which lies the village of Abu Dem. To the E., in the desert, is the dei
Ghazdl, with the ruins of a large Christian convent. On the right bank,
opposite Merowe, is the now abandoned village of Merowe, with the ruins
of the government building, erected on the remains of e mediaeval for-
tress, which was, in its turn, built with the stones of an ancient edifice.
Among the ruins is an altar dedicated by Piankhi, the Ethiopian king. ..-.
On the left bank, about 6 N. above Abu DiUn, is the pyramid-field of
Belal, a group of at least two dozen pyramids, probably older than those
of the Gebel Barkal. They are built of soft sandstone and are much
weather-worn. Close by is the village of Nari. - Tangasat', on the left
bank, the next steamboat station, is the scene on Tues. of one of the
largest markets in the Sildtn. In the neighbourhood are some ancient
pyramids; and on the opposite bank lies the pyramid-field of El-Kurru.
About 3/4 hr. farther on, near the village of 2iima, on the right bank, is
another group of more than thirty pyramids. - Still farther to the S.W.
in the Nile valley, on the left bank, about 30 N. from Merowe, lies Korti
(rest-house), which was General 1volseley's headquarters in Dec., 1884,
during his nnevailing dash to relieve Gordon (p. 422). On the same bank,
about 50 N. farther (12 hrs. by steamer from Korti), lies Debba (rest-house),
and farther downstream is Abtt Gussi, an important trading point with the
Kahtrtbtsh Beduins, and the starting-point of a caravan route to El-Obei'd
(p. 433; id-20 days' journey). On the right bank, 5 M. farther down, lies
Dongola et"Agitta ('Old Dongola0, the former capital of the province,
which. though now deserted, is full of interest. In the middle ages it was
the capital of a Christian Nubian empire, and it still contains a fine old
church. Beyond the steamboat stations of Ehandak (rest-house) and Urbi
we reach New Dongola or El-Ordeh (rest-houae), a thriving town with
15,000 inhab., on the left bank of the Nile. Finally, passing the island
of Argo (rest-house), the steamer arrives at Karma (comp. p. 411).

Beyond Abu Hamed the railway ascends the valley of the Nile
on the border line between the 'Atmiir (steppe) on the E. and the
cultivable belt on the river-bank 0n the W. The latter is marked
by palm-trees and, lower down, by a bushy undergrowth. Between
Nov. and Jan. the verdant strip reminds one of the bank of the Nile
in Egypt. - In the settlements on the banks we now for the first
time see the typical round straw huts (tukul) of Central Africa, with
their pointed roofs and airy 'reenhas' or porches.

248% M. Dagash is the residence of a Ma'milr, whose spacious
white house is seen at a little distance from the village. The Robatt1b
and Sheikiyeh tribes here, together with a few sub-tribes, constitute
the great Arab group of the Monasir. The Monasir preserve a num-
ber of ancient legends concerning the wanderings, feuds, and inter-
marriages of their ancestors, and are exceedingly proud of these
'histories of Godâ€™s people'. In 1884 Col. Stewart, General Gordon's
