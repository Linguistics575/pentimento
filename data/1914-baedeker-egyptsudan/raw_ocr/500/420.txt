188 Route 13. SUEZ.

Suez (Arab. swag) lies at the head of the gulfof that name,
one of the N. extremities of the Red Sea, and to the S.W. of the
mouth of the Suez Canal. Before the construction of the great
work of M. de Lesseps it was a miserable Arab village, while in
1907 it contained 18,347 inhab., including 2530 Europeans. Nei-
ther the Arab quarter, with its seven mosques and unimportant
bazaar, nor the European quarter, in which the principal street is
the Rue Colmar, presents any attraction. The town has a governor
of its own.

A mound of debris to the N. of the town, called by the Arabs
Ktrm el-rolsum, commands a fine view of the mountains of the
Peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the harbour, and the town. This hill
was probably the site of the Ptolemaic fortress Klysma as well as
of an earlier settlement of the period of the Pharaohs. Beyond the
railway, to the W., are the mud-huts of an Arab sailors' quarter.
- A little farther to the N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water Canal
(p. 180), the flow of which into the conduits, as well as its discharge
into the sea, is regulated by means of a large lock. The level of the
canal is here 61/2 ft. above that of the Red Sea. On its banks, and
also near the British Cemetery, are gardens in which fruit and vege-
tables flourish luxuriantly. The large buildings to the N. of it are
the former English Naval Hospital and the engine-house of the
Water Works. - To the E. of the canal is the large eamping-ground
for caravans. Numerous pilgrims to Mecca, chiefly from Egypt,
Syria, Turkey, and Bokhara, pass through Suez.

As the N. extremity of the Gulf of Suez ends in a shoal, which
is dry at low water, the entrance of the Suez Canal and the ne-
cessary harbour-works were constructed 2 M. to the S., at the be-
ginning of the deep water. A stone Causeway, 50 ft. wide, on which
run a road and the junctiou-railway mentioned at p. 187, connects
the town with these works and affords beautiful views of the
'Atilra Mts. on the W. and the range of the Peninsula of Sinai
on the E.

At the end of the pier is Port Ta'ufilc, on an artificial island,
about 50 acres in area, constructed of the large quantities of earth
dredged from the canal. To the left is the railway station of Terre-
Plein. The main street of Port Taufik is the Avenue Il√©lime, over
1000 yds. in length, at the N. end of which is a bronze bust erected
by M. de Lesseps to Lieutenant Waghom (p. 183), an enterprising
German in the British service, who, after having spent the best
years of his life in the endeavour to establish regular communication
between England and India via Egypt, died in London in poverty
in 1850. The large basin to the S.W., Port Ibrahim (Docks Station),
is spacious and well-protected and is capable of containing even
large war-ships. - The situation of the tsand-banks and of the
navigable channel is of course best seen at low tide.
