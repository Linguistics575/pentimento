On the W. bank, near the river, lie the remains of a fortress 01
a late period and some ruined houses.

Faras (IV. bank). Close by is a rectangular wall of the Christian
period enclosing the remains of a castle as well as blocks of masonry
belonging to an Egyptian temple and to a church. To the S.W. is
an isolated rock with a Memorial Niche of Setaw, governor of Ethiopia
under Ramses IL; farther to the W. are a Christian cemetery and the
remains of two churches. To the N. of the walled enclosure, near
a modern Mohammedan cemetery, lies an early Nubian neeropolis,
to the W. of which are remains of churches and Christian tombs.
Extensive excavations were made here in 19t0-d2 by the Oxford
Expedition under Dr. Griffith. - On the W. bank our attention is
attracted by the curious dunes extending between the villages and
the desert expanse and consisting of sand and the pointed leaves of
tamarisks. In the river lies Ges"tret Faras, a large island, known as
Artikargu (‘rich island') by the Nubians.

Opposite the S. end of the island, on the W. bank, lies the
village of Aksheh, with the remains of a small temple built by
Ramses H.

We next reach the scattered village of Surreh (Sara), on both
banks of the Nile. Here, on the E. bank, are the remains of Coptic
conyentnal buildings and three churches, all within a wall of an
earlier period. About 1/2 M. farther S. lies a fourth church, to the
E. of which is a hill with graffiti of the Middle Empire.

Farther on , on the W. bank, are remains of Coptic buildings
and a ruined Coptic church. 20 M. Dibeireh (Debeira, Debiera), on
both banks, with fine palm groves. In the river lies the Island of
Dibeireh. Farther on we pass (331/2 M.) Ashkil (E. bank) and Arlfin
(Arein; W. bank), beyond which the river-banks again become flat
and barren.

KO M. Wedi Halfa. (Sudan Government Rest House, R. 20, pens.
from 4O pias., good), often called simply Halfa, is a clean little
town on the E. bank, founded by the British on the site of several
Nubian villages. It is the capital of the province of the same name
in the Anglo-Egyptian St1dttn. It contains a hospital, a small bazaar,
and a pretty mosque, and, including the Nubian village of Dabarésa
011 the N., has 2675 inhabitants. llalfa is the starting-point of the
government railway to Khart.ihn (p. 419). The government steamers
lie to close to the station. The military railway from l.lalfa to Kerma
(at the Third Cataract; p. 42(Y) is no longer used.

About 11/4 M. to the S. of Halfa is the British Camp or Lines
(called Geiger by the natives), the base for the campaign against
the Mahdists (p. 427; donkeys obtainable at the rest-house). It has
lost much of its military importance. Besides the partly disused
barracks and stores it contains the residence of the commandant,
large railway workshops, etc.
