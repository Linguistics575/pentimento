queen. _ The builder of the largest pyramid (sides 325, formerly
36011.; perpendicular height 164, formerly 228 ft.), situated a little
to the S.W., was King Ne/er-er-ke-r? (5th Dyn.) Un the E. side are
the remains of the mortuary temple, built of freestone and brick. --
The other buildings, some of which were pyramids and others
sanctuaries of the sun, are mere heaps of ruins.

A few paces to the S.E. of the Pyramid of Sehure is the Magtaba
of Ptahshcpscs (5th Dyn.), excavated by De Morgan in 1893. It is
mostly covered up again; the locked chambers are opened by the
keeper of Ahueir. We first enter a large hall (only partly exeavat-
ed), with twenty square pillars. Thence a. door opens into another
hall, with three recesses containing statues; on the walls are reliefs
of goldsmiths and of workmen carving statues of the deceased in
wood and stone. A third hall, in which the lower parts of two lotus-
columns with bud-capitals, are still in situ (comp. p. 83), contains

remains of fine wall-reliefs.

Continuing our route to Salslcilra we leave to the left a pond and
the village of Abugir, situated beyond a group of palms to the S.E., and
soon reach the sandy eminenees of the Necropolis of Memphis and Mari..
ette's House (p. 147), 3/4 hr. from the first pyramid of Abueir. At the village
of Abusir are the remains of a temple of the New Empire.

7. The Site of Ancient Memphis and the Necropolis
of Salrlptra.

A visit to Memphis and titu.cl.dira may easily be accomplished in one
day. Provisions should not he forgotten, - Tickets admitting to the mon-
uments of Sal.rlfiira may be obtained for 5 pies. each at Mariette‘s House
(p. 147). Travellers, however, who possess a general ADMISSION TICKET
from the Service des Antiquités de PEgypte (p. 200) do not require these
special tickets. The custodians are forbidden to ask for gratuities, but a
single traveller generally gives 1/2, parties 2-21/2 pies.

The following, arrangement of the journey will be found convenient.
Take an early train to (1 hr.) Bedrashein (Badrechein; fares lst cl. 101/2,
2nd el. 81/2 pias.), where donkeys and drivers (10 pias. there and back, grat-
uity 3-5 pias.), camels, and desert-carriages (60 pies. there and back) are in
waiting. It is safer, however, to order a carriage by telegram addressed
to the station-master. Ride vii the site of Memphis, where the "0olossi of
Ramses (p. 144) are inspected, and thence, passing the *8tep Pyramid
(p. 146), to (ca. 2 hrs. in all) gfariette's House fp. 147), in the Nect'opolz's of
/hz.k.kdra. For luncheon and a visit to the "6erapewn (p. 147) and the
“Tombs of Ti and Ptahhotep (pp. Ido, 163) l hrs. should be allowed; and
possibly time may be found for the inspection of the Onnos Pyramid (p. 165)
and the Persian Tombs (p. 166) or for the *Tomb of Mereruka (p. IN)) and the
Street of Tombs (p. 162). For returning to the station of Bedrashein 11/2 hr.
more should be reckoned. - A highly attractive return may be made by
the route already described vitrhbufir to the Mena House Hotel (21/2 hrs.;
bargain beforehand with the donkey-driver at Bedrashein; thence to the
Menu. House Hotel donkey 20, camel 25-30, desert-earr. 80-100 pias.), whence
we take the tramway to Cairo. Those who confine themselves to the
Neeropolis of Sal.cliiirtr, may make the excursion from the Merle House Hotel
vit Ahueir (donkey 20, camel 30, desert-carr. 80 pies.) - For the route
