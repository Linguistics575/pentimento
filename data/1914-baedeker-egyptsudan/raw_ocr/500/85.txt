m. El-Islém.

By Professor C. H. Becker.

The term Jslthn is used to connote the peculiar civilization of

the Nearer East, which owes its characteristic features to the spread
of the Arabs and to the religion of Mohammed. However strange
and novel it may appear to us at first sight, it is nevertheless based
upon the same general principles as the civilization of mediaeval
Europe, from which it differs mainly in being represented by other
peoples and other races, to whom the brilliant intellectual develop-
ment of Europe has been denied.
.‘a The rise of Ei-1sltm has become historically intelligible only
within recent years. Formerly it was tacitly assumed on all hands
that the Arabs had imposed upon the East not only a new language,
but also a new, speeiiieally Arab, civilization. This view agreed
with Christian conceptions, which recognized in 1slrrim only a new
religion and founded its opposition to Arab dominion 0n religious
and ecclesiastical motives only. In Christian eyes Mohammed was
identified with Antichrist; he instigated his barbarian hordes to
hurl themselves upon the Christian countries of the East in order to
convert them to Islam by the sword; the course of development since
antiquity was abruptly broken off; and the Islamic Arab civilization
superseded its early-0hristian predeeessor. When, with such TIre-
conceptions as these, the Arabian historical sources were consulted,
they seemed at first to yield confirmation. The Arab tradition was as
ecclesiastically coloured as the European ; there/too/the starting-
point was Mohammed and the Arab migrations; Mohammed and
the early Caliphs were supposed to have reorganized everything
and to have created, in all essentials, the new Islamic civilization.
As a matter of fact, the erroneousness of all these current f'0rlcep-
tions cannot be too emphatically insisted On.

In the first place it must be clearly understood,',that the;trium-
pliant campaigns of the Mohammedans were nothing else than an
Arab Migration, the latest and, for us, the most obvious of the great
Semitic migrations, absolutely analogous with the great migrations
of the Germanic peoples in Europe. The main difference between
the Arab and the Germaniehnigrations is this, viz. that the Arabs,
owing to their religious organization, were directed by a central
authority, so that the establishment of a homogeneouslslamic em-
pire became a possibility. 'It was not religious zeal, it was not
the flery words of an inspired prophet that urged the Arabs on
their warlike mission to the outer world; simple necessity, the long
continued economic decline of Arabia, inja word sheer hunger,
drove them into the rich lands of the settled countries. The move-
ment had begun centuries before Mohammed. The tribes of Inner
Arabia were already on the move, a peaceful immigration of Arabs
into Mesopotamia and Syria had already begun, and the standing
