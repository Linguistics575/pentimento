Street Scenes.

CAIRO. J. Route. M)

Several times daring the day and also at night the solemn and
souorous cry of the muezzin, summoning the faithful to prayer (see

p. lxxxvii), reverberates
from the tops ofthe minarets
(madna). When the shops
are shut the watchmen
(bauwdb) place their beds
(serir) of palm-twigs in the
streets outside the entrances
and prepare to spend the
night th ere; sometimes they
have only mats or rugs to
sleep on. The street-traffle
ceases in the Arab quarters
comparatively early, while
in the European districts it
goes on till nearly mid-
night. But during the
month of Ramadan it con-
tinues throughout the
whole night even in the
Arab quarters; the story-

 

tellers (p. xxvi) in the cafes then have many listeners, while,
shadow-plays (p. xxvii) and broad farees attract others.

The traveller will ob-
serve the Schoots (kuUCth),
of Which there are 193 in
Cairo, with 363 teachers
and 11,925 scholars, and
one of which is attached to
almost every public foun-
tain (sehil; p. clxxxii). He
will tind it very amusing
to watch the f.k/t, or gehool-
master, teaching his pu-
pils with the aid of ad-
monitions and blows, while
the boys themselves recite
verses of the Koran with a
swaying motion of their
bodies (a practice supposed
to 'strengthen the memory')
or bend over their wooden
or metal writing tablets.
They do not fail, however,
to find time for the same
tricks as European school-
