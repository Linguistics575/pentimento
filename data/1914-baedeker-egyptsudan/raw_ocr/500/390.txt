166 Route 7. SArgigfst.

()n the S. side of the Pyramid of Onnos are three SHAFT 'l'osws
or THE PERSIAN EI’OCH, all of similar arrangement. A vertical
square shaft descends to a chamber constructed of blocks of stone,
at the bottom of a larger shaft sunk for the purposes of construction
and then again filled in. These tombs are now accessible by a spiral

staircase and are connected with each other by tunnels.

The descent is snmewhat toilsmne. The shaft, 72 ft. deep, leads
vit a corridor 16 ft. long to the vaulted tmnb-chamber of the physician
Ptamtik, a. contemporary of Darius I. The walls are decorated with re-
ligious inscriptions. The lid nf the large limestone eoftin is raised and)
the arrangement for lowering it is plainly visible. This coffin contained 1
a smaller one of basalt and, like those in the two other tombs, is letinto ',
the floor. - To the W. is a modern tunnel, leading to the tomb-shaft and
sarcOphagus-chamher of the royal admiral Zenhebu (comp. p. 90), which con-
tains some beautifully carved inscriptions. ---Towards the E. we, descend
by steps to the shaft (88 ft. deep) and the chamber of Petorete. The walls',
are decorated with inscriptions in fine, low relief, the colouring of which,
is well preserved, and with representations of sacrificial gifts. The vanlted'
roof is covered with coloured stars upon a white ground.

If time permit the traveller may now proceed to the S. Pyramids ,
of 6hrliliiira, a ride of 11/4 hr. to the S. from Mariette's House. We q
pass near a piece of ground about 440 yds. square, enclosed byt
broad and massive, but now very dilapidated walls on the E., N., I
and W. sides, while the S. side is bounded by the natural hills of
the desert. The route leads thence straight to the Mastabat el-Fara'on,
the most interesting monument in the S. group. To the left are
the dilapidated Pyramids of Phiops f. and Merean and a pyramid
called by the Arabs Et-Hamm esh-Sltotvtvtff. On the N.W. (L) side
of the Mastabat el-1?arar6n is the Pyramid of Phiops II. All these
pyramids (now inaccessible] are constructed and adorned exactly in
the same manner as that of King Onnos (p. 165). The Maslabat et-
Fura'tm resembles in its shape some of the mastabas of the Middle
Empire. The passages in the interior resemble those in the pyr-
amids of Onuos and his successors, so that this monument may
probably enough be a king's grave, as its name implies ('grave
of Pharaoh'). The top, which is easily reached, commands a
fine view.

About 11/2 M. to the S. of the Mastabat cl-Fara‘én lie the Necropolis and
Pyramids of Dahshiar. Here rise two large pyramids and a smaller one of
limestone and two of brick (El-Ahrdm es-tMd, the 'Black Pyramids'), together
with remains of others, all of which are at a considerable distance from
each other. The W. Brick Pyramid, which was once covered with slabs of
stone, is probably the tomb of King Sesostris m. (12th Dyn.). The length
of the side at the base is MI ft., while the height is now only about 90ft.
To the N. of this pyramid, but within the girdle-wall that formerly en-
closed it, are two subterranean galleries with tomb-chambers in which
female members of the royal family were interred. The jewels found
here are now in the Cairo Museum (p. 97).

To the S.W. of the N. Brick Pyramid lies a larger Stone Pyramid.
This is still 325 ft. in height and 709 ft. in width, being nearly as large
as the Great Pyramid of Gizch (p. 127), and in its solitude presents a
very imposing appearance. Like the Pyramid of Meidiim (p. 205) it was
built by Snofru, and is thus the must ancient royal tomb in the form of
a pyramid.
