all seasons, thus allowing a series of crops to be raised throughout
the year. Mohammed Ali deepened canals and began in 1835 the
construction of the Delta Barrage (comp. p. i22), which was not
completed, however, until 1890. It renders it possible to raise the
upstream water-level so that the water can at all times flow into the
three main delta-canals, the Rayah et-Taufilit, the Raye]; el-Menu-.
fiyeh, and the Rayah eI-Beheireh. In 1902 were eotnpletedsthc
Assuan Dam (p. 37r) and the Assitit Barrage (p. 232). The first of
these works (recently heightened) allows a reserve-supply of water
to be kept to increase the insufticient supply of the river in May,
June, and July, while, the second enables the water-level of the
river at AssUU. to be raised until it flows down the great 1brthimiyeh
Canal which supplies the proviiwes of Assits.t, Minyeh, Bemisueir,
Grizehj and (through the Bahr 1%suf) the FaiyCim. Finally the bar-
rage at Esneh (p. 342), eompleted in 1000, provides for the irri-
gation of the province of Keneh. One effect of the m0ditieatious
thus introduced is to diminish to some extent the importance of the
high floods, but to enhance enormously the value of a favourable low-
stage supply, since in April, May, June, and July, when the supply
of water is lowest, a very large proportion of the country from
Assit.t to the sea is bearing crops, principally cotton, the most
valuable crop of the year. Another effect of increased perennial
irrigation is that the volume of water brought down by bountiful
inundation, is greater than is now required. Of late years.very
large stuns have been expended in providing an effieiunt system'of
drainage to prevent low-lying lands from becoming water-logged
and the Rosetta branch is now being remodelled to increase its
capacity as a flood-escape.

The breadth of the, Nile valley is nowhere great, and only a por-
tion of it is occupied by the cultivated alluvial plain, the rest een-
sisting of desert-sands at too high a level to be reached by the
inundation. ln Nubia the enltivable land is restricted to isolated
patches, while the valley is rarely as much as 2-3 M. wide; in
Egypt it is wider, varying from 15 M. atBenisueif to 5 M. at Edfu,
of' which 13 M. and 4 M. respectively are cultivated.

The alluvial deposit which is annually brought down by the
Nile in flood has accumulated in the course of centuries to an average
depth of 35-40 ft., occasionally even more. In composition it varies
slightly from place to place. As a rule it forms a good light soil
being rather above the average in potash but defieient in nitrates
The view formerly held that it had a high manurial value was an
exaggerated one, and it should be considered rather as a virgin soil
which, added annually to the surface of the land, enables it to
bear luxuriant crops year al'ter year.

Every year during the flood a considerable deposit of silt takes
place in the river-bed, part of which is carried away as the river
falls, but the general result is that the bed of the Nile has been
