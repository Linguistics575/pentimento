to the river, which must have made great eneroaehments here since
the end of the 18th century. Between Manfaltot and Assitst (27 M.
by river, only 17 M. by land) the Nile makes many curves.

We next observe &iilarl.g'll, on the E. bank, 11/4 M. to the S. of
Et-Jfaethdeli (p. 219), El-Hawiitkeh, a pretty village among palms,
on the W. bank, and Bani Mohammad, on the E. bank. The
mountains to the N. (E. bank) recede farther and farther from the
river, leaving a. broad strip of fertile land at their feet. Close to the
mountains lie 'Arab el-'Atiytt and Deir el-Gabnâ€˜mri (p. 219).

Above Ileni Mohammed the Nile makes several great bends and
is divided into two arms by the large island Gezirct Beh'lg. On the
E. arm lies (233 M0EbniibtAhnuh), a distriet-capital, with 6878 in-
hab. (4291 copei) and fine palm-groves.

The foot-hills of the Libyan chain on the W. bank approach the
river, whivh is here, near the village of El- Waladiyeh (Walidia; W.
bank), bridled by the Assii1t. Barrage, an imposing work intended
to regulate the amount of water in the Ibrihimiyeh Canal whieh
irrigates the provinces of Assitst, Minyeh, Benisueif, and Gizeh,
and (through the Baht Yt1suf, see p. 'IM) the Faiyfun. The bar-
rage, which is 910 yds. long am141 ft. high, was constructed in
1898-1902 by Aird & Co. o. 372) from the original design of Sir
w. Willeoe,ks and plans by Sir Benjamin Baker (d. 1007) and Sir
W. Garstin. It consists of thirteen sections, the first of which (W.)
has three arches and a look, while the others have nine arches
each. Each opening (111 in all) can he shut by an iron door. The
barrage is crossed by a varriage-road. - Immediately above the
barrage, on the W. bank, are the regulation-works (a bridge with
nine arches and a lork) at the mouth of the Jbrlilihti'iyeh Canal, the
S. prolongation of the Ruhr Ytsut' (p. 231). Close by are the neat
houses and pretty gardens of the officials.
