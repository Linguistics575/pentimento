the gods ofTalmis and other deities. At the foot of the walls of
Reum I) are depicted local deities with their offerings. Many of the
inscriptions are merely sketched in in red. Small chambers have
been constructed in the S. walls of Rooms D and E. From Reom "
we reach the Staircase, which ascends in the thickness of the wall
to the roof ofltoom I?. Thence the higher roofs of the front portions
of the temple are reached by steps. Another staircase leads from
the rool' of Room F, to the top of the external wall. Descending a
few steps to the left, we reach a Chapel formed in the thickness of
the wall. This comprises two rooms (with a crypt in the second)
and was probably intended for the cult of Osiris.

The INNER PASSAGE (Pl. G) round the temple is entered by doors
in the court and vestibule. The unfinished lions' heads on the ex-
terior of the temple proper are water-spouts. On the rear wall is
a large relief of the emperor before the gods; below are smaller
reliefs. The two representations of Mandulis, on the girdle-wall
opposite these reliefs, were, probably originally protected by a
small wooden chapel. At Pl. a, on the S. side, is a well-preserved
Nilometer.

The W. part of the girdle-wall of the OUTER. PASSAGE (PI. Ir)
round the temple was built against the rock. The small Chapel
(_I‘]. I) in the S.W. angle was perhaps a Birth House. It includes
an untinished open court enclosed by columns and stone screens,
and a Rock Chamber (Pl. 1.), of which only the door has reliefs (the
emperor before the gods]. - Another well-preserved Chapel (P1. K),
in the N.E. angle, probably dates from the Ptolemaic temple.

Outside the temple are Gateways and ruins of a massive wall
of hewn stones. On the W. hill-slope are Quarries, while the
Remains ofthe Ancient Town, the houses and girdle-wall of which
are easily traceable, stretch down into the plain. In the latter are
towers of rough stone.

We now proceed to the N. from the temple of kalibsheh, pass
through the village, turn to the left, and reach the (1/4 hr.) -

*Roek Temple of Beit e1-Wili ('Ilouse of the Wali'), situated
halfway up a hill, at the mouth of a side-valley. The temple,
founded under Ramses 11., consists of a vestibule, a hypostyle hall
hewn in the rock, and a small sanctuary. The VESTumLE, of which
only the side-walls so far as they wore formed by the rock are now
standing, besides the lately re-erected tloor-posts, was used as a
church in Christian times, being divided into have and aisles and
provided with a vaulted brick roof. Our interest is excited by the
animated *flistorical Reliefs on the side-walls, of which coloured
casts have been placed in the British Museum.

Two scenes on the left wall represent the king's triumph over the
Ethiopians. 1n the first relief we see the king, to the right, under
a canopy, while (in the row below) Egyptian grandecs present him
with tribute of various kinds, the principal object being a tablet
