at an early age and was brought up by the governor of his
native town, whose daughter he married. He was sent to
Egypt in 1800 as a captain in the contingent from Kavala
and so distinguished himself in action against the French
that Kusa-uf Pasha, the new governor, appointed him bim-
bashi (colonel) of a corps of Albanians in the contests be-
tween the Turks and the Mamelukes. In this position No-
hammed adopted the policy of apparent impartiality, while
he workedjin secret for the destruction of both parties.
When the Turkish governor was expelled Mohammed Ali
became pasha, with the approval of the Porte, and on
Aug. 3rd, 1805, he took possession of the citadel of Cairo
(p. 46). The British meanwhile had occupied Alexandria
and,Damietta, but Mohammed, allying himself with the
1lamelukes, inflicted two defeats upon them, in consequence
of which the British fleet withdrew in autumn, 1807. The
pasha next disembarrassed himself of his now inconvenient
allies by inviting the Mameluke beys to Cairo, where they,
with their followers (480 in all), were treacherously mas-
sacred in the citadel by Moharnmed's Albanians, on March
Ist, 1811 (p. 68).

campaign, begun in 1811 by Mohammed on behalf of the
Porte against the Wahabis (p. xci), who had taken pos-
session ofArabia, was brought to a successful close in 1810
by Mohammed’s sou Tuisttrt. A fresh insurrection of the
Wahabis was suppressed in 1819 by Mohammed’s adop-
tive son Ibrahim Paiha, a military genius of the first order.

Mohammed now turned his attention to military reforms. He

employed his lawless Albanians in Nubia and the Stodin
(whereihis son Ismiril perished, p. 422) and created a home
army of fellahin, which showed its prowess in i82d-27,
under Ibrahim, in helping the sultanIin the Creek war of
independence, until the Turkish-Egyptian fleet was armi-
hilated at the battle of Navarino (1827).

To increase the strength and resources of Egypt Mohammed

energetically encouraged agricultural improvements and
introduced various manufacturing industries (comp. p. lxv).
After the Russian victories over Turkey in 1828-29 he de-
cided that the moment had come to free himself from the
suzeraimy of the Porte. At the beginning of 1832 Ibrahim
invaded Syria and within atycar he was master ofAsia Minor,
but the intervention of themuropeau powers compelled Il o-
hammed to coueludesthe peace of Kutihia or kouia in 1833,
which was favourable to the Porte. Sultan allal.untsd II.
