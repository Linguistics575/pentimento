its Side Streets. CAIRO. J. Route. 59

till we come to a broader covered passage, which we follow to the right
for a few paces, and then take the first lane to the left. This lane is con-
tinued under the name of Shari“ el-3fettaggidin and is inhabited chiefly by
tailors, cloth-merchants, and dealers in undressed wool. A short abrupt
curve of this lane, to the left, then brings us to the Share" el-u.k.kddin.

The Sufim' EL-ASHRAFiYEH forms the ilrst part of a long line
of streets leading to the S. and farther on taking successively the
names of SMrir el-Ghliri, Shin" clvAlilriidiu, and Sukkariyeh.

In the SEAR:r EL-GHI‘JRI the first things to catch our eye are the
beautiful facades of the medreseh and mausoleum of Sultan El-
Ghitri (PI. It, 3, 4), which have so often been depicted by the brushes
of famous artists. The MEDRESEH, to the W. (L), was finished in
1503 and has a minaret, inappropriately crowned with five modern
dwarf cupolas. The most notable features of the interior are the
beautiful pulpit and the tasteful marble panelling of the lower part
of the walls. Opposite the medreseh, on the E. side of the street,
is the MAUSOLEUM, dating from 1504. The sultan, who fell in Syria
(p. cxix), is not, however, buried here. From the rectangular
vestibule we pass to the right into the oratory, covered by a dome.
From this a door leads into the malfad (restored), or hall in which
the sultan was wont to await the hour of prayer. To the left ofthe
vestibule lies a second chapel, now used as a school offlee. Adjacent is
a charming sebil with a school, projecting into the street (p. olxxxii).

To the E, of the SHfUue ErpAr.ir.dhrts lies the quarter 0t I.16s?tk.thdattt.
In its main street stands the °House of thumil ed-Din ez-Zahebi (No.6;
Pl. E, o, president of the merchants, one of the best preserved of the earlier
Arabic private houses in Cairo. The building, generally known as the
'House of the Bookbinders', dates from 1637 (visitors knock; 2 pias.).
Through a crooked passage (dirkeh) we reach the court of the saliimlik,
0r living-rooms of the owner, with two well-preserved fagades. 1n the
S.W. corner is a flight of steps leading to the malfad, an open colonnade
with two arches. The inscription on the cornice gives information about
the building. Adjoining the malfad is an Oriel window with mashra-
hiyehs (p. clxxxv), whence the ladies of the harem could overlook the court.
Proceeding in a. straight direction we enter the beautiful 1.rts'a, or drawing-
room of the harem (p. clxxxv). adorned with fine mosaics. The middle and
lower-lying part of the room is covered with a wooden dome, and the flat
wooden ceiling of the other parts of the chamber is also very beautiful.

The SUKKARiYEH (P1. E, l) forms the bazaar for sugar, dried
fruits (mt.kl), fish, candles, and similar wares. 0n the left is the
modern marble Sebil of Mohammad Ali, and on the right the -

'"Gtunir el-Muaiyad (Pl. D, E, 4), called also 66ru" el-Alimar
(i. e. 'the red mosque') after the adjoining Derb el-Ahmar (p. (YI).
lt was erected by Sultan Shaikh el-Nalynttdi Muaiyad (p. cxviii),
of the dynasty of the Circassian Mamelukes, who had been defeated
in a rebellion against Sultan Fame, and vowed that he would build
a mosque on this site if he were released from prison. The mosque
was not finished till a year after the sultan's death (1422). The
three massive walls, intended to enclose three now 1twins, wrre
erected during, a thorough restoration in the second half of the
19th century (modern portions shaded grey on the ground-plan,
p. 60). The bronze gate at the entrance (PIA), the handsomest
