the same way a sycamore tree was believed to be the abode of the
goddess Huthor, who belonged to the district to the S. ofMemphis,
while the god Ne/trtern was worshipped in the form of a lotus flower,
and the goddess Neith, of Sais, as a bundle of arrows. But the belief
that gods chose animals as their abode and revealed themselves in
the form of animals was much more generally spread; cows, bulls,
rams, goats, crocodiles, eats, lions, iehneumons, frogs, certain kinds
of fishes, ibises, falcons, vultures were all believed to be thus chosen
by one or other god. Thus the god Khnum was represented as a ram,
Horus as a falcon, Thout as an ibis, Sobek as a crocodile, the goddess
Nekhbeyet as a vulture, the goddess of Bnbastis as a eat, Hathor of
Dendera as a cow, the local goddess efAthribis as a serpent, and so on.

Besides the local deities who were worshipped in the form of
animals there were special sacred animals, distinguished by certain
markings, which were worshipped from a very early period. These
were kept in the temple, and after their death they were interred
with all honour, while their place in the temple was taken by another.
The best known example of this worship is afforded by the Apis,
the sacred bull, worshipped at Memphis. It was black with white
spots; on the forehead it here a white triangle and on the right flank
a crescent. Similarly a light-ooloured bull (Mnevis) was worshipped
at Ileliepolis, at l-lermonthis the bull Buchis was sacred, as was the
heron Phoenit at Heliopolis. These sacred animals were connected
with the local deities; the Apis was thus considered to be the 'liv-.
ing replica of Ptah', the Phoenix the 'soul of the sun-god'. At a
later period, the worship of sacred animals was carried further. Not
only were these individual 'sacred' animals revered as holy, but
also all the animals in which the local deities inhered. One or more
of these animals Was preserved in the temple, and all others of the
same kind, none of which might be killed within the region sacred to
them, were solemnly interred in special cemeteries when they died.
The eat-eemeteries of Bnbastis and Beuihasan, the croeotlile-graves
of Ombos, the ibis-graves of Ashmunein, ete., date from this late
epoch of exaggerated oitnal-worship. It was probably only this
excessive expansion of animal-worship that struck the Greeks in
Egypt as remarkable. For traces of a similar worship were common
to various oriental peoples, and even among the Greeks and Romans
themselves certain animals were regarded as sacred to the gods, as,
c.g., the lions of Cybele, the owl of Athena, and the eagle of Zeus.

A stage beyond fetishism was reached when the Egyptians, in the
beginning of the historical period, began to form an anthropomorphic
conception of their deities. The gods had human faces and forms
and wore clothing such as the Egyptians themselves wore. Like
princes, they wore on their heads helmets or crowns, and, like the
primeval rulers, they had tails fastened to the back of their aprons.
They bore the soeptre or the commander's baton as the symbol
of their might. The deities that were conceived of as animals 110w
