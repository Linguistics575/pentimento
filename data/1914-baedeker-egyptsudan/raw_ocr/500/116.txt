IV. ANCIENT HISTORY.

Antony, having summoned Cleopatra t0 Tarsus to answer for
the conduct of her general Allienns, who contrary to her
wishes had aided the army ofBrutus and Cassius at Philippi,
was captivated by her beauty and talent. After having
spent years of debauchery with the Egyptian queen, he
was at length declared by the Roman Senate to be an en-
emy of his country. Octavianus marched against him, de-
feated him at Actium, and captured Alexandria. Antony
committed suicide, and Cleopatra also is said to have
caused her own death by the bite of an asp.

Egypt now became a Roman province subject only to the
emperor and was governed by viceroys or prefects nom-
inated by the emperor.

2. Roman Period.

in representing themselves to the Egyptian people as successors
of the old Pharaohs and in maintaining the appearance of a
national Egyptian state. - Christianity was early introduced
into Egypt, where it spread rapidly.

C. Cornelius Gallus (13.0. 69-26), whom Ovid ranked first
among Roman elegiac poets, was appointed first prefect.
He repressed an insurrection in Upper Egypt (p.256) and
fought against the Ethiopians. Having afterwards fallen
into disgrace with the emperor, he committed suicide. -
