VII. Historical Notice of Egyptian Art

L Architecture.

0f Egyptian architectural monuments dating from the pre-
historic period or from the earliest dynasties unfortunately little
has been preserved - very little compared with what remains of the
buildings of the period extending from the Ancient Empire to the
Graaeo-Roman epoch. The remains that do exist are ohieily tombs,
of clay or of sun-dried bricks of Nile mud, materials which were
used also for houses and temples of the period. For the roof-sup-
ports, and frequently for the roofs also, round trunks of palms were
used. In many other cases the chambers were covered with barrel-
vaulting. - Stone began to be used for tombs and temples at the
beginning of the Ancient Empire, but brick never ceased to he
the characteristic building-material of Egypt. The characteristic
Egyptian architectural members, such as the concave cornice
(cavetto) and the round moulding (tows or roll), had their origin
in the primitive structures of wattle-and-daub, and the form of the
circular Column was borrowed from the wooden supports used in
brick buildings. The square Pier or Pillar, on the other hand, came
into existence with architecture in stone.

Piers are first met with in tombs of the Ancient Empire. Their
lateral surfaces arty frequently occupied by reliefs or inscriptions
and their fronts by other ornamental designs. Thus tall papyrus-
plants and lilies occur on piers of the time of Thutmosis III. at
Karnak (p. 274), and a sistrum (a rattle used by women) with a head
of Hathor at Abu Simbel (p. 409). The four-sided pier was con-
verted into an octagonal or sixteen-sided pillar by bevelling off the
corners, part of the pier, however, being left square at the top so
as to blend with the roof; at the foot was a round, cushion-like
base. By grooving or iluting the flat surfaces of the pillar a play of
light and shade was obtained. Sixteen-sided fluted pillars, which
have received the name of Proto-Dorie Columns (Fig. 1), occur in
tombs of the Middle Empire (at llenil1asan and Armin) and in
temples of the time of Thutmosis Ill. (Karnak, p. 277; Deir el-
Bahri, p. 30?0. The name was suggested by certain points of resem-
blame to the Dorio columns of the Greeks, the chief of which are
the marked tluring, and the tapering; but the Proto-Dori? differs
from the Greek Dorie in being destitute of the 'eehinus', a member
resembling an overhanging wreath of leaves, forming the capital
of the true Dorie column. The chief difference, however, is that
the shaft of the Egyptian column rests upon a base, while the
Dorie column springs immediately from the ground. Another
difference is that some of the sides of the Proto-Doric column are
frequently twfluted and left flat for the reception of inscriptions.
