Port Sand, see p. 177. - The numerous masts in the harbour
of Port Sa'id remain in sight long after we quit that town. The
canal, 0n the W. bank of which runs the railway to Ismzi'iliyeh
(p.179), is constructed in a perfectly straight line through Lake
Menzeleh, but the part of the lake adjoining the canal on the E.
has been drained. The brackish waters of this lake extend over
an area of about 1000 sq. M., covering what was once one of the most
fertile districts in Egypt, formerly intersected by the three most
important arms of the Nile (p.11vii) in ancient times, the Pelusiae,
the 1anitie, and the Mendesian. Among the numerous towns and
villages situated here were the important cities of Tanis (p. 172)
and Tennis. The chief village is now Matiriyeh (p. 174). Immense
floeks of pelieans and silver herons and some flamiugoes are to be
seen on the lake, and its waters are fished by about 7000 boats,
each of which pays a monthly tax ofSE2. For steamers of the

isthmus led the ancient caravau-route from Egypt to Syria. The
railway from Cairo to Port Sa'id (p. 179) has a station here. The
village, with its mosque, lies on the Asiatic bank of the canal. The
hill to the left commands a survey of the environs.

The mounds of debris named Tell Defenneh or Tell ed-ghunineh ('hill
of the grave- diggers"), situated to the N. of the earavan-route between
EHliililtiyeh (p.112) and El- -Kaniara, at the ancient Pelusiae month of
the Nile, contain the remains of a camp of the Greek mercenaries ot
I'sammetichosl. These were excavated in 1886 by Prof. Flinders Petrie,
who found numerous fragments ofGreek pottery, arrow-heads, and weapons.
Prof. Petrie identifies the spot with the Greek Daphne: and with the
Tahapams, Tahpanhes, or Tehaphnehe: of the Bible (Jer. ii. 16 and xliii.7;
Ezek. xxx. 18, eth. - About 11/2111. io the E. of E1-Kantara,a little tn
