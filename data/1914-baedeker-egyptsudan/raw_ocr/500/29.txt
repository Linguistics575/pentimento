influence of the desert; the air is bracing, although about 5" warmer
than at Luxor. The beauty of the surroundings lends a peculiar
charm to Assuiu. - The accommodation for invalids is very good.

Patients should not leave Upper Egypt until the middle of April,
on account of the cold N. wind. They will tind at Athens, Corfu,
Sicily, and Capri and other points near Naples admirable transition-
stations in spring.

Medical Hints. l'sevaeeirtation is a safeguard to travellers in
Egypt, if not already performed within six years. Special care,
should be taken to avoid eye-troubfe, and it is inadvisable to allow
one's field-glass to be used by strangers, especially natives, for fear
of infection. Those, too, who come into contact with natives should
avoid rubbing their eyes with their hands. A useful precaution
is to bathe the eyes regularly with boraeie acid lotion (3 per cent),
especially on dusty days or after excursions. Visitors to Upper Egypt
should have spectacles with grey glasses. -...,.' Against sunstroke,
which, however, is rare in the winter months, the best protection is
afforded by broad-brimmed hats, sunshades, or cloths tied round
the hat so as to fall down over the back of the neck. A pith helmet
with a large flap to protect the neck may be recommended also.
The remedies for headache resulting from I ftroke are rest and

also unpeeled fruit and green salads. Water and milk should never
be drunk unhoiled, for fear of typhoid. In cases of diarrhea meat
should be avoided and a simple farinaeeous diet adopted; the bev-

at Cairo, Alexandria, Helwéu, Luxor, Assutn, etc., also on board most
of the tourist-steamers.

Sprains are most effectually treated with cold compresses, while
the injured limb should be tightly bandaged. - The sting of a
scorpion is relieved by immediately applying ammonia; strong doses
of alcohol may be administered internally.

Travellers should be careful to pay attention to the daily changes
of temperature o. lxxvii), particularly at sunset in cultivated dis-
tricts, when the air cools very quickly and colds are easily caught.
Warmer clothing or a cloak is useful till LI a.m., then lighter
clothing till nearly sunset, when the cloak should be resumed. The
hour for returning to the hotel varies with the place and the month,
being earliest. in Jan. and latest in March and April. li' the traveller
