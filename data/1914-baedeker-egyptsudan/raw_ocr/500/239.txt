4, Cairo.

PLAN or' 0111110. The commonest word for 11 street is Simian" (French
Uhm'eh), meaning a. main street, avenue, 01' boulevard; other words used
are Sikkeh (street), JJerb(roail, also caravan-track), J_Icta'attune, also quarter
of a town), and 'Atfa (blind alley). Niddn is a8tluare. - Since the British
occupation the numes of the streets have been written up at the corners
in Arabic, accompanied by English Ot" French transliteratious on a some
what inexact system (p. xxviii). Our plan follows this transliteration in
general. correcting, however, the more olrvious defects (e.g. the English
'ee' is represented, as in the text, by 'i'). Some of the old French names,
consecrated by usage, have been retained.

Hotels (comp. p. xviii). The leading hotels at Cairo are excellent; at
most of them evening dress is de riyuew' at late dinner. Even the second-
eiass hotels are well fitted up, nearly all having electric light, baths, etc.
As all the hotels are frequently full, especially in Jan., Feh., and March,
it is a wise precaution to telegraph for rooms from Alexandria. or Purl
Sa’id, if they have not been engaged even sooner. In summer many of
the hotels are closed and the others lower their prices. Children and
servants pay half-price.
