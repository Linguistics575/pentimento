DAMIETTA. 10. Route. 175

nf the god of 11ehef? (Le. Horus), of which the modern name is a corrup-
tiun. Isis, as well as Horns and Osiris, was worshipped here. Within
a still partly extant girdle-wall ot' unhurnt brick, used by the Arabs as
a place of burial, rises a large heap of ruins, which form the remains
of the once mag,roifie0ut TEMPLE OF Ists, built by Nektanebés (30th Dyn.)
and Ptolemy II. Philadelphus. The ruins form a most picturesque mass of
fragments, altogether about MX) paces in circumference. The structure con-
sisted entirely of granite, ehietly grey hut partly red in colour, brought
hither from a great distance.

The reliefs all date from the time ofPtolemy If. The position of one
of them enables us to identify the ancient sanctuary. In this relief the
king appears offering incense before the sacred hark of Isis, which is
here showu in a form hitherto found only in hronzes: the cabin resembles
a house of two stories; above, the goddess, with the eows' horns and the
sun's disk, is enthroned on a Jotus-flower, guarded on each side by a
winged goddess. On the W. side of the ruins, near the ancient entrance,
is an interesting large slab of grey granite, veined with red, on which is
represented the king offering a gift of land to Osiris and Isis. On the N.
side lies an unusually large Hathor capital, in granite. Numerous remains
of pillars, architraves, friezes with heads of Hsthér, and waterspouts in
the shape of recumbent lions also still exist. A little farther on the re-
mains of a staircase built in the walls may be observed.

The sacred lake of the temple still exists near the village of Behbit,
to the N.W. of the ruins.
