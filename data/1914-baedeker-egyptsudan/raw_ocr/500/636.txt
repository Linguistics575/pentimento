and the mummies of a priest and a priestess of Philae found on the
island of Hesseh (p. 387).

Farther to the s., opposite the Cataract Hotel, lies a massive
ancient Embankment, many of the blocks in which were taken from
earlier edifiees and bear inscriptions. The rock-inscriptions close
to the stream should be noticed also.

The entire S. part of the island is covered with great mounds
of rubbish formed by the ruins of the Ancient Town of 1iliephantine.
Among some brick walls a few paces to the W. of the quay we may
distinguish the foundations of a small temple, constructed with
stones brought from earlier edifices, including drums of columns
and blocks with the cartouches of Thutmosis m., Ramses m.,
and other monarchs. From an inscription on the solitary stump
of a column now standing we learn that Trajan was the builder.
About 50 paces to the W. a granite portal, once the entrance to some
large temple, dominates all this part of the island. The reliefs
upon it show Alexander II. (p. ovii), saerificing to the ram-headed
Khnum and other deities of Elephantine. Inscribed blocks and
sculptured fragments lie scattered about. Close by is the neero-
polis of the sacred rams, whose sarcophagi are still to be seen
(for the mummies comp. pp. 357, 90). Various other buildings,
seen and described by the French Expedition, were pulled down
about the beginning of the 19th century. Among these were temples
built by Amenophis III. and Thutmosis III.

The higher parts of the island, especially a granite promontory
on the W. bank, command a fine *View of the black and brown,
rough and smooth rocks of the cataract, among which the Nile flows.

The trip round the island by small boat, which takes about 1 hr.
(fare for 1-3 pers., 15 pies), is full of interest. On an islet, about
550 yds. to the s., not far from the right bank of the Nile, are
several smoothly polished and cylindrical 'pot-holes', caused by the
action of high water. - The island between Elephautine and the
W. bank, named Airutt, Sirdfirâ€™s Island, or ffitelienerh, Island, for-
merly belonged to Lord Kitchener and is now the property of the
government. It is covered with palms, oleauders, and pomegranates.

On the W. bank, to the N. of Elephantine, rises a hill, crowned
with the tomb of a sheikh (p. 360), in which are excavated the
*Roek Tombs of the princes and grandees of Elephantine. These,
which were opened in 1885-86 by Sir F. Grenfell (now Lord Gren-
fell), date from the close of the Ancient Empire and from the Middle
Empire and are therefore contemporary with the tombs at Beni-
hasan (p. 227), which they resemble both in construction and de-
coration. The more important tombs are now kept closed. Tickets
should not be forgotten.
