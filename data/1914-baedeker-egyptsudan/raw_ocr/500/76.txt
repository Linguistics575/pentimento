Int Il. GEOGRAPHICAL AND e. Agriculture:

3. The \VEsTERN or LIBYAN DESERT (pp. 378 et seq.) is totally
different. The level limestone plateau, about 1000 ft. above the sea,
extends to the W., its S. escarpment overlooking the lower plain of
the Nubian sandstone to the S. In deep bays in this escarpment lie
the oases of Ehtrgeh, Dtskueh, and Fardfra, while that of Bahriyeh is
situated in a depression surrounded by the higher plateau. The pla-
teau is waterless and practically devoid of vegetation, while isolated
knolls show how rapidly the erosion of the desert-surface by wind
is proceeding. In certain parts lines of sand-dunes 100-200 ft. high
stretch across the desert plateau in a N.N.W. and S.S.rl. direction,
sometimes for several hundred miles with hardly a break. They are
most developed to tho W. of the oasis of Dakhleh. The floor of the
eases of Khargeh and Dtkhleh consists mostly of dark-coloured sands
and clays of the upper cretaceous formation. Some beds contain alum
and others are phosphatie. Springs well up at many points from a
depth of about 400 ft. and furnish an abundant water-supply to the
cultivated lands (comp. p. lxxii). Some of these rise through natural
fissures and others through holes bored for the purpose.

To the S. of the oases lies the lower plain of the Nubian sand-
stone. This plain contains no hills of any importance, but pre-
sents a low rolling surface covered with blackened flint pebbles
and concretions of iron and manganese oxide, while the silieified
trunks of fossil trees are frequently met with. Yellow drift-sand. is
seen everywhere, but it is only occasionally that it forms dunes of
any size. _

The oasis of Faridra lies farther to the W., and to the N. and W.
of it extends the plateau of eocene limestone as far as the oasis of
Shock. The strata here are mostly of mioeene age, and they contain
numerous fossils, a fact recorded by Herodotus and Eratosthenes.

0. Agriculture and Vegetation.

1. CAPABILITIES or THE SOIL. The land is extremely fertile, but
it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is sometimes represented
to be. Many of the crops, as elsewhere, must occasionally be followed
by a fallow period; others thrive only when a certain rotation is oh-.
served (such as wheat, followed by clover and beans); and some
fields require to be artificially manured. Occasionally two crops are
yielded by the same field in the same season (wheat and saffron,
wheat and clover, etc.) The great extension within the last thirty
or forty years of the cultivation of the sugar-eane, which requires
a great deal of moisture, and ot the eotton-plant, which requires
much less, has necessitated considerable modifieatious in the modes
ofirrigation and cultivation hitherto in use. As both of these crops
are of a very exhausting character, the land must either be more
frequently left fallow or must be artificially manured. The in-
dustry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are thus
