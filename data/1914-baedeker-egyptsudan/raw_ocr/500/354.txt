136 Route6. PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH. KhephredsTemple.

The total structure is 147 ft. square and 43 ft. in height; exter-
nally the walls batter. The facade, on the E. side, was pierced by
two huge portals (now closed), surrounded by monumental royal
inscriptions. The present entrance is from the ancient Causeway
JI. a). We descend the corridor (P1. b) to the Anteehamber (Pl. i),
constructed of red granite, in which the passages leading from the
two portals unite. Here is also the well (P1. l), new full of water,
in which Mariette found the famous statue of Khephren now in

the museum at Cairo (11.83). We return through the large door-
way in the central axis of the building into the main Hypostyle
Halt (P1. f), which is shaped like an inverted T, the main arm being
57 ft. lqng and 291/2 ft. broad, and the cross arm 82 ft. long and
23 ft. broad. Sixteen monolithic granite pillars divide the main
arm into three aisles, the cross arm into two. The stone beams of
the architrave still preserve their sharp edges. These rooms were
lighted by means of small oblique openings, still to be seen in the
upper part of the side-walls. Against the walls originally stood 23
colossal royal statues, the bases of which have left rectangular marks
on the pavement. Several of these statues are now in Cairo. F.-.-.
From the S.W. angle of the hypostyle hall a dark passage leads to a
group of Storerooms (Pl. g), arranged in two stories with three rooms
in each. Thence we return to the entrance-corridor (Pl. b), quit it
by a door 011 theleft, and follow a short oblique passage to the Porter's
Room (Pl. h), which is constructed of slabs of alabaster. To the
right in the corridor is the entrance to an Inclined Plane (Pl. i),
which turns twice at a right angle and leads to the Roof of the
temple. The pavement and walls of this plane are likewise con-
atrueted of alabaster.
