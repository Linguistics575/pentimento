362 Route 2d. ASSUAN. Environs

of Gezireh (p. 341; good cafe) to the so-called Alabaster Hill, mark-
ing the site of an ancient quartz-quarry, whence the Egyptians
obtained the necessary material for polishing hard stone. Near the
hill to the N. of this point (with rock-inscriptions of various dates)
opens the Widi Abu Agag (see below), running thence to the E.

In addition to the trip mentioned at p. 358, pleasant afternoon
trips may be made by BOAT from Assntm to the Nile islands of the
cataract district (Seheil, ete.; p. 363), and downstream pastthe palm
and orange groves of (21/2 M.) Nap' esh-Shfmeh to the (5 M.) island of
Bahrif. On the N. end of the latter (11/4 M. farther) is a pavilion
belonging to the Sheikh of Geztreh (p. 341), where visitors are ac-
customed to brew the tea they have brought with them.

In the case of a longer stay visits may he paid to the highly pictur-

esque VALLEYS OF THE ARABIAN AND LIBYAN DESERTS, which dehouch in
the neighbourhood of Assuan. These excursions are made by camel.

SHORT Excunsrons. 1. To the EMr el-A?aba, to the S.E. of the ancient
quarries; 3 hrs. there and back. - 2. To the E. by the Wadi Arad as far
as the top of the plateau (views-, the Gehel Garra, see below, is visible
beyond the Nile), and hack to the N.W. through the Wddi Abu Agag (see
above), at the exit from which is the Bab el-Wadi Camp (p. 353); 1/2 day.
_..... 3. From the Iiuhbet el-IIawa (p. 360) along the picturesque hills on
the W. bank to the dam (p. 371); 4 hrs. The camels should be sent on
the night before to the Fubbet el-Hawa.

LONGER EXCURSIONS. 1. Through the Arabian Desert to the well of
Umm Hebal, about 25 M. to the S.S.E.; d-5 days there and back. As the
way lies through the territory of the Bishtsrtd Beduina, a member of that
tribe should be selected as guide. From Shellé‘tl (p. 363) we proceed to the
S.E. through the dei Duéra, then follow the Wddi Bardmram past the
conspicuous sharp ridge of Gebel Kurtunos (1200 ft.; on the left), and in
11-12hrs. (from Shellél) reach the well of El-Muelha, in the wide and
pleasant Wadi Dimhtd (Dehmtt). Thence we lay a S.E. course through the
dei Umm Hebal to the (7 hrs.) well of Umm Hebal. A longer (3 days) but
more picturesque route leads to the S.E. from the Wadi Abu Agag (see
above) or the Wiidi Ariid (see above) through the Wddi ei-Hildi, which
merges into the broad midi el-Mrah at an abandoned goldzmine; and thence
by the Winding Wadi Umm Hebal to the (18 hrs. from Assuan) well of Umm
Hebal. - 2. Through the Libyan Desert to the (381/2 M.) uninhabited Oasis
of' Rilrkur (1050 ft. -, numerous fossils); 4-5 days there and back. The route
leads from the Kuhbet el-Hawa (comp. above) to the W.S.W. After about
21 M. itpasses about 23/411. to the left of the conspicuous Gabe! Garra (1770 ft.;
wide views), and after 16 M. more it surmouuts the hill of Gebel Etrkur
(1225 ft.), behind which lies the oasis. Comp. John Ball, Jebel Garra and
the Oasis of Knrkur (with maps; Cairo, Survey Department, 1902; 15 pins.).

Excursion to Phila, and the Nile Dam.

Many travellers to Phila, avail themselves (for the outward journey at
least) of the RAILWAY to She11itl (71/2 M. in 1/2 hr.; fares 6, 3, 11/2 pias.). But
the DESERT ROUTE is preferable (1 hr.; donkey there and back 8 pias.,
bakshish 2 pias. l carriages, see p. 353), whether we follow it throughout or
diverge from it to follow the river for part of the way. The best way to
return is to arrange to take a boat from Philae to the Nile Dam (fare from
the station of Shellél to the island and thence to the dam, 15 pies. each
person) and have donkeys or a carriage to meet us there for the return
to E1-Khaziin (p. 363). Or we may go on from the dam in another boat
through the Cataracts to Assutn (fare 15 pias. each pers.). - Provisions
and tickets of admission should not be forgotten.
