a company which built the railway, to extend the area of cultivatlon
by boring artesian wells. About 40 such wells have already been
sunk, by which nearly 1000 acres have been reclaimed from the
desert. Cotton is the chief crop in summer, wheat and barley in
winter. Vines, bananas, and vegetables of various kinds are grown
also. But the main wealth of the oasis still consists in its date-palms,
about 40,000 in number.

Visitors who spend only one day in the oasis should visit the Christian
necropolis, the temple of'Hibis, the town of Khiirgeh, and, if time permit,
the temple of Naditra and the Coptic convent. Visitors with more time
will find the irrigation-Systeiu and cultivation of the oasis of interest.

The chief RUINS in the N. part of the oasis, which may .be con-
veniently visited from Nadtira (p. 380), are those of the large -

'Temple of Hibis, picturesquely situated in a grove of palms.
IO min. to the S.W. of the station. This temple, built by Darius I
in honour ofAmon (comp. pp. cvi, clxvi), was excavated by the
archaeological expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of New York in
1909-11 and has been restored by the Egyptian Department of An-
tiquities. The axis of the temple runs E. and w., and the building is
approached through four gateways. On the right wing of the second
gateway is a Greek inscription of 66 lines, dating from the 2ud year
of the Roman emperor Galba (69 A.D.]. We enter the temple through
a Colonnade, built by Nektanebés (378-361 11.0.), which is adjoiued
by a Colonnaded Court. Beyond these are a Vestibule (promos) and
the small Hypostyle Hall, borne by eight columns. A staircase to the
left leads to a chamber dedicated to the cult of Osiris. In the Sanc-
tuary, in the main axis, are some interesting representations of gods
(Astarte on horseback, Astarte with b0w and arrows, etc). To the left
is a staircase ascending to the roof, to the right is a small chamber
with a representation of the god Khnum shaping the king on the
Potter's wheel. - On a hill, 20 min. to the S.E., is the --

Temple of Nadiera, which dates from the time of Antoninus Pius
(138-161AJL) and is surrounded by a lofty brick wall. The pro-
uaos, which was separated from the forecourt Oil the E. by columns
connected by stone screens, is in good preservation. - The trigono-
metrical survey mark beside the temple commands an excellent view
of' the N. portion of the oasis. - On a ridge about 1/2 M. to the N.
of the temple of llibis is the -

“Christian Necropolis, in which are several hundred brick tombs.
Most of these are arranged on either side of a broad avenue. The
typical tomb consists of a domed chamber, frequently with an E.
apse and side-recesses, and a vestibule; the larger tombs are praeti-
cally miniature basilicas. The facades are not unfr0quent1y adorned
with pilasters or semi-e0lurnns and contain triangular recesses for
the reception of lamps. Few of the internal decorations are pre-
served; in one tomb is a representation of Daniel in the den of lions,
