52 Route d. CAIRO. l. nmitltyeh ' Tauft.ktyeh.

Adjoining the Ezbekiyeh on the N.E. is the small Midfin el-
Khdzindc‘tr (Pl. c, 3; Shtrir Clot Bey, see p. 78). The narrow
lanes to the N.E. lead to the so-called Fish Market (El- Was'a), one
of the most disreputable quarters of Cairo.

Westwards from the Ezbekiyeh and to the W. of the Shari" Kamel
and the Shtri"Abilin, as far as the Nile and the Sherir 'Ahhts,
extend the quarters of Ismkrtltyeh and Taa1filriytsh. - The Ismtf-
tltyeli was begun by the Khedive 1srm1ril (p. oxxii), who desired to
rival the modern quarters of Paris and presented sites here gratui-
tously to anyone who would undertake to erect on each a house
worth at least 30,000 fr. within eighteen months. This is still the
fashionable quarter as well as the seat of the European trade. Several
of the principal hotels and banks are situated here, also the English
church, the ministerial offitses, most of the consulates, and many
palaces of European, Levantine, and Egyptian grandees. Ismiril...
tyeh and Taufilityeh are separated from each other by the wide and
busy SHARI' Bhsili, which, beginning on the W. at the Ezhekiyeh,
leads to the quarter of B0151]; (p. 78) and the new Bfllalg Bridge
(p. 79). To the left stands the Church ofAlt Saints (P1. B, 3; p. 42).
- To the S. of the Shari' Btolili, and parallel with it part of the way,
run the SHARI‘ EL-MAGHRABI and the fashionable Salsa' EL-
)IANAKH. Farther to the S. is the SHARI' ISAgR EN-NiL, leading
from the Shirie 'Abdin (p. M) to the MiDAN SULEIMRN BASHA
(P1. A, B, 4), with the monument of Suleiman Pasha, while at the
N.E. corner stands the Savoy Hotel (p. 35). Beyond this point the
street leads past the handsome Palace of Count Zogheb, built by
llerz-Pasha in the Arabic style, to the barracks of Kasr en-Nit
(Pl. A, 4) and the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities (p. 80).

The Smhe SULEIMRN BRSHA (Pl. A, B, 3, d) leads from the Midan
Suleiman Bisha to the hfldtm Ismtt"iheh, where it joins the Shari'
tsl-Kuhn, leading to the Kasr en-Nil Bridge. Farther on the street
takes the name of Sakif 1.i%yt EL-‘AINI. On its right side are the
English Church of St. Mary (p. 42) and a handsome quarter erected
on the site of the Palace 1ra.sr ed-DuMra, including the British and
the United States Agencies (Pl. A, 5). On the E. side of the street
is the Université Egyptienne (Pl. A, 5), an institution found ed in
1 908 on the European system, with professors of all nationalities
(t23 students in 19r1-12, including 43 women). Farther on, on
the same side, are the building containing the Ministry of Public
Works and the War OMee (entr. in the Sherir esh-Sheikh Itiun),
and the building of the 8t1dibt Agency (p. 37). In the grounds sur-
rounding the ministerial building, to the N., is the -
