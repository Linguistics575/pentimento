cuous summits of which are the serrated pyramid of the Gebet Serbtil
(6759 ft.) and, to the S., the sugar-loaf of the Gebcl Umm Shémar
(8449 no. At their base stretches the barren desert of El-Ka'a, follow-
ing the undulations of the "oast-line and rising to the height of 984 ft.
In front of us lies the solitary little port of Twit or Tor (p. 377), which
is a quarantine-station during the period of the Mecca pilgrimage. To
the N.W. of it lies a small grove of palms. Among the central momi-
tains of Sinai we obtain a brief glimpse of the Gebel Jfitsa (7519 ft.;
'Mountain of Moses'), the traditional Mount of the Covenant, and
of the (what KétI-erin (8551 ft.) to the right of it. The Peninsula of
Sinai ends on the S. in the steep R/is Mohammad (98 ft.). - The
coast on the right is fringed by a series of rocks and islets; on the
Ashraf Reef is an iron lighthouse (140 ft. high) with a revolving
light and on the rugged islet of Shadu-an (1213 ft.) is a flash-light.

Passing through the Straits of Jubal, 4M. wide, the steamer
enters the Red Sea. On the left we have a view tip the Gulf of
'Aleaba, through which the Erythrasan depression is continued to the
N. towards the Syrian depression (Dead Sea, Valley of the Jordan).
We now lose sight of the coast on both sides. Excluding the gulfs
at its N. end the Red Sea is 1050 nautical miles in length, 120 to
190 nautical miles in breadth, and has a maximum depth of 7740 ft.
The name dates from antiquity and is supposed to have some con-
nection with the tribes of the Homerites ('the red'). The sultry eli-
mate, which is rendered more oppressive by the extreme moisture of
the atmosphere due to evaporation, is notorious. In August the tem- .
perature frequently rises to above 10Y Fahr. in the shade, when
sunstroke is to be guarded against; but during the travelling-season
(Oct.-May] the heat is often so modified in the N. part of the sea by
the prevailing N. winds that travellers returning from the tropics
run the risk of taking cold. During this season a strong s. wind
usually blows in the s. part of the sea, rendering the outward journey
at least endurable. In any case, in winter the steamer is seldom
more than one or two days within the zone of extreme heat.

There are several islands and islets in the N. part of the Red Sea.
About 80 nautical miles from Shadwan (see above) lie the Brothers,
two low coral islands, with a lighthouse (69 ft. high) whose light is
visible for 12 nautical miles; and about 100 nautical miles farther
S. is the once dreaded Daedalus Shoal, a submarine coral reef, now
marked by a lighthouse (59 ft. high), with a light visible for 14 nauti-
cal miles. Beyond that point the stearner's course is free of islands
for more than 650 nautical miles. At about lat. 22 we desery on
the Egyptian coast the Gebel Soterba or Gehet Ten (7280 ft.).
while on the Arabian coast (at a distance from our route) lies Jidda
01' Jeddah (20,000 inhab.), the harbour for Mecca, which lies 50 M.
inland. About 40-60,000 Mecca pilgrims land annually at Jidda,
on their way to the birthplace of the Prophet (comp. p. lxxxviii).

As we enter the harbour of Port Sudan several lighthouses and
