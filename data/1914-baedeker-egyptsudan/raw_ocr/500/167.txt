column) and supports a capital formed of a bundle of palm-leaves,
bending slightly outwards, and held together by bands (Fig. V c).
The earliest and finest palm-columns were found in the mortuary
temple of Sehuré at Abusir. At a later period the base of the
column was often omitted. - The comparatively simple plant-
capitals of the earlier periods were elaborately developed during the
Ptolemaie epoch, until they almost assumed the form of bouquets
of flowers, resplendent with brilliant colours (Fig. Vb].

Besides these plant-columns other varieties occur. The so-ealleil
Hathor or Sist-r'um Columns have round shafts crowned on four sides
with the head of the goddess Hathor (with cow’s ears), above which
was a temple-like addition. These are exclusively tonfinei1 to tem-
ples of female deities and are most numerous in the Ptolemaic
period; they are doubtless reproduetions of the sistrum o. Clvii),
with its handle. Another curious column is the Tent-Pole Column,

an imitation of the primitive form of tent-poles. This occurs in

the festal temple of Thutmosis 111. at Karnak (p. 9.75), where the
capitals are altered to the form of inverted calices.

Comparatively few of the ancient Egyptian Secular Buildings,
even of the later historical periods, have been preserved. The
number of ruined towns is not, indeed, insignificant; but the re-
mains of the earlier houses are almost invariably concealed by those
of later date and are thus very difficult to examine. The remains
of earlier houses have come down to us directly in only a few ex-
ceptional instances, as at lllahtlu (pp. 194, 196), Tell el-'Amarna
(see p. 212), and Deir el-Ballis, and beside the valley temple of the
Mykerinos Pyramid (p. 133). These, in connection with represent-
ations preserved on the monuments and models of houses found in
tombs, afford us some knowledge of the structure and interior ar-
rangements of Egyptian PRIVATE HOUSES, which in many respects
resembled the Arab houses of modern Egypt (p. clxxxiii). The
house of the humble peasant or workman was as simple then as it
is to-day. An open court, in which the family spent the day (and
in summer the night also), was adjoined by a few dimly-lighted
sleeping-rooms and stables for the cattle, while a staircase led from
the court to the flat roof, upon which a few smaller apartments were
often found. The houses of the more prosperous Egyptians of the
Middle Empire also had a court as their central point, at the back
of which, on a terrace, was a colounade or vestibule of light eol-
umns, generally open towards the N. and affording, protection from
the sun. Thence a door led to a wide hall, the root of which rested
011 columns, and beyond that was a deep hall, also with columns,
probably used as the eating room. Jeyond that again were other
apartments (bedrooms) for the master of the house and his grown-
up sous. On one side of the four principal divisions of the house
Lcourt, vestibule, broad hall, deep hall) were the women's apart-
