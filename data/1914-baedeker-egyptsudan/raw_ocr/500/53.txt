II. GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES. xlvii

Upper Egypt, known as E.s-o.Sarid, extends nominally to the First
Cataract only, but now embraces in a political sense most of Lower
Nubia (comp. p. 384). Politically Egypt is now divided into fourteen
Pnovmcns or Jfihltrtyeh. The provinces of Lower Egypt are: (1)
J.ralyt"th"tyeh (Qaliubia), at the head of the Delta, with Benha as its
capital; (2) Slutktyeh (Sharqia), i.e. 'the eastern', with Zalpiztl; as
its capital; (3) Dakahliyeh (Daqahlia), with Mamitsra as its capi-
tol; (d) Jfeniif'tyeli (Menuiia), with Shibin el- K6111 as its capital;
(5) Gharbiyeh (Gharbia), Le. 'the western', with Tanta as its capi-
tal; (6) Beheireh (Beheira), i.e. 'of the lake', with Darnanhth as its
capital. The last includes the oasis of Siweh. The following tive
governorates are presided over by governors (i1fol.it"r/'es) of their
own, and are independent of the provincial administration: Cairo,
Alexandria, Port Sa‘id, Isrmt'iltyeh, and Suez. Sinai and El-‘Arish
are administered by the War Office. The eight Upper Egyptian
provinces are those of Gizeh (Giza), Benisueif (Beni Suef), Faiyotm
(Fayum), Minyeh (Minia; with the oases of Bahriyeh and Fart/ra),
Assiat (with the oases of Ddlrhleh and khtrgeh), Girgeh (Girga, capi-
tal, Sohtg), Keneh (Qena), and. Asnafn (Aswan).

The chief offieial in every province is the Miidtr or Governor.
Each miidir is assisted by a sub-miidir, a commandant of police, a
sanitary inspector, and an engineer (for irrigation and buildings).
The interior economy and the financial procedure are subject to in-
vestigation by European inspectors from the Ministries of the In-
terior and Finance, while others from the Ministry of Public Works
and the Health Department control the technical work. The 14 pro--
vinces are subdivided into 84 districts, called Markus, the chief
officials of which (Ma'mtr) are directly subordinate to the mtadtr
and have their of'fioial residence in the more important towns. The
markaz, in their turn, are divided into JWilliyeh, or communes, which
include, besides the chief village, hamlets, settlements of agrieul-
tural labourers (‘Ezbeh), and landed estates (Alfadt"yeli). The rom....
deli, or chief magistrate of the commune, is directly responsible to
the ma'mfar. In the larger communes the romdeh is assisted by the
Sheikh el-Beled, or mayor. The governorates are divided into quar-
ters (hrism), each of which has its rna'rntm

According to the census of 1907 the POPULATION of Egypt proper
was 11,287,359, of whom 10,903,677 were settled natives, 97,381
were Beduins, and 286,301 were foreigners (147,220 Europeans
including 20,653 British). The numbers of males and females were
approximately equal. The settled population was distributed in
2 large cities (Cairo and Alexandria), 43 other towns with upwards
of 10,000 inhab., and 3580 villages. The above figures show a po-
pulation of 940 per sq. M. for Egypt proper, a density unequalled
by any country in Europe (England and Wales 619, New York
State 191, Saxony 830 per sq. M.). The total populaiton in 1897
was 9,734,405, in 1882 it was 6,831,131.
