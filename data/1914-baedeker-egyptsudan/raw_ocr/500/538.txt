which the staircase is still to be seen, to Six Small Chapels, each
of which is entered by a sandstone gateway in the girdle-wall. Only
the two chapels farthest to the W. have left any considerable re-
mains. The second from the W. contains the name of Amenertiis,
with that of her brother Shabako. The tine alabaster statue of the
queen now in the museum at Cairo (p. 88) was found here. --
Farther on towards the river are numerous brick houses of a later
date, which have been largely demolished. Among them are the
remains of a small temple dedicated by Philopator to Thout. ---. To
the extreme N., amidst the houses of the village of Karnak, stands
a Small Temple, erected by Shepenupet, the daughter of the Ethio-
pian King Piankhi, and adorned with palm-columns.

d. THE SOUTHERN BUILDINGS AT KARNAK.

Situated to the S. of Ramses II.'s girdle-wall (p. 276] is the
Sacred lake, named by the Arabs Birket el-JfalW.ur or Lake of the
Salt Pit, as the water has become saline and undrinkable through
infiltration. The banks were anciently faced with hewn stones, and
traces of these are still to be seen on the W. and S. sides, and
even better on the N. On the N. bank of the lake stands a structure
of Thutmosis III. Near the N.W. corner are the ruins of a building
of Taharka, and on the bank of the lake is a colossal *Wanite Scara-
baeus, which was dedicated by Amenophis III. to the sun-god Atum-
Khepre, who was pictured in the form of a scarabaeus.

We now proceed to visit the Connecting Buildings between the
Temple of Amen and the Temple of Mut.

Quitting the central court of the Temple of Amon, we enter a
court enclosed on two sides by walls and on the rear by Pylon VII,
all of which are in ruins. Here stood a temple erected by Amen-
0phis I. and taken down under Thutmosis 111., the limestone blocks
of which have been recently rediscovered; they are adorned with
fine reliefs. Adjacent is the so-called 'Rarnak Cachette' (now closed
up again), a large pit in which a profusion of statues of all periods
was discovered (779 of stone, 17,000 of bronze; now mostly in the
museum at Cairo, see p. 84); they came from the Temple of Amon
and were probably buried here when no longer used. - On the
exterior of the W. wall was inscribed the famous treaty made by
Ramses II. with the Hittites (p. 272). On the E. wall is a long
inscription (P1. a), describing the contests of King Amenephthes
(Merenptah) with the Libyans and the peoples of the Mediterranean
(Etruscans, Achaeans, etc.), and a triumphal relief (PI. b) of Ame-
nephthes, in the presence of Amon, smiting his enemies.

Pylon VII, built by Thutmosis 111., whose victories are celebrat-
ed on it, originally served, like the following Pylon V111, as the S.
entrance to the Temple of Amenophis I. (see above). In front of
the N. facade are colossal red granite statues of kings of the Middle
and New Empires; in front of the S. facade are the lower parts of
