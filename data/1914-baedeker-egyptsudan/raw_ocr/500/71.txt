feet per second, holds back the waters of the White Nile above
the junction of the two streams, so that in August and September
the waters of the Baht el-Gebel and the Sohat are penned up in
the White Nile valley and contribute only a very small share to
the inundation of the Nile proper. The rains of Abyssinia may
therefore be regarded as practically regulating the height of the
inundation of the Nile, and it is their variations which occasion
the fl11etuation from year to year. The region of the equatorial
lakes has no effect whatever on the flood.

The Nile begins to rise at Khartihn about the middle of May,
and at Assuin by the beginning of June, reaching its maximum
height at both places about the end of the first week in September.
The mean difference between the highest and lowest stages of the
river is 21 ft. at Ehart.ilm, 20 ft. at l' 'tuh' Halfa, 23 ft. at Assuin,
22 ft. at Assitt, 22 ft. at Minyeh, and 16 ft. at Cairo. After the flood
has reached its maximum height the Blue Nile falls rapidly, but the
water of the White Nile, which is now liberated, prevents too rapid
a fall of the river below kharttorn. By January the Blue Nile sup-
ply has diminished to a small amount, while that of the White Nile
is several times as great, and this state of affairs continues until
June, when the Blue Nile again rises. Thus, for these five months
the mainstay of the Nile supply is the constant quantity furnished
by the White Nile, amounting to some 14,000 cubic ft. per second,
supplemented by a quantity from the Sobat River and the Blue
Nile, which varies from year to year according to the amount of the
summer and autumn rains of Abyssinia in the preceding year.

From time immemorial the Nile flooded its valley annually.
Crops were sown on the mud flats left by the water as it subsided
and, at a very early period, a system of irrigation was developed by
which the flood-water, with its load of rich earth, was led by canals
into basins enclosed by earthen banks, where it deposited its sedi-
ment and whence it was allowed to escape when the river had fallen
sufficiently. The crops which grew luxuriantly on the soil thus
annually enriched were harvested in April and May, after which
time land in the neighbourhood of the river or where there were
wells could alone be cultivated until November after the next flood.
The amount of water was insufficient to meet the needs ofagri-
culture in Egypt during the months of May, June, and July.

Of recent years, however, especially since Mohammed Ali deve-
loped eotton-growing in the Delta, a great change has taken place.
It is no longer in the flood-season alone that water is supplied to
the land. Several large works have been constructed in order to
render Perennial Irrigation (comp. p. lxxi) possible, by storing up
the surplus water in November, December, and January for distri-
bution in the later months before the arrival of the flood, and by
means of canals and numerous regulating works water is supplied
to the Delta at such a level as to flow on to the cultivated land at
