The excursion to the Pyramids of Gizeh requires at least half-a-day.
ELECTRIC TRAMWAY from the Mtaha el-Khadra. to the tl hr.) Helm House
Hotel, see No.14 (p. 38r, also, No. 15 as far as Gtzeh Village only, see p. 39. -
By CARRIAGE the drive takes 1-11/t hr. each way ip. 39). CYCLISTS and Mo'ron-
[3T3 will find the road excellent. It should not be forgotten that the East-
en-Nil Bridge is open for 11.2 hr. daily for the passage of vessels (see p. 79),
when the “somewhat longer routes viz‘t the rhbtrtts II. Bridge (see below)
or the Bale}; Bridge (p. 79) must be taken. - °RE3TAUBANT at the Mona
House Hotel. There is also a small restaurant at the terminus of the
electric tramway. Or the travellers may bring provisions with them from
their hotel (included in the pension-charge).

A flne and calm day should be selected for a visit to the Pyramids,
the driving sand in windy weather being very unpleasant. Sun Umbrellas
and Smoked Spectacles are advisable precautions against the glare of the sun.
Ladies who intend to ascend the pyramids should dress as they would for
mountain-climbing. A repetition of the excursion by moonlight produces
an inefTaetsable impression.

1hrrmrAzTRAcitoss. Those who are pressed for time should devote their
attention to the "areat Pyramid (p. 127; ascend to the summit and visit the
interior), the "8phimr (p. 135), and the *Valley or Granite Temple ofirhephrers
(p. 135). The inspection of these chief objects of interest occupies about
2 hrs. The ''Greuit described at pp. 137-139 will occupy 11/2-2 hrs. more.

The tramway to the Pyramids (see above) traverses the quarter
of-Balc‘tlc and the Bazag; Bridge to the island of (iles'lreh (comp.
pp. 78, 79) which it crosses to the Pont Zamalek. From the W. end
of this bridge it runs to the S. along the small W. arm of the Nile
to the Pont des Anglais (p. 80), joining the 8lutri' el-Gtzch which it
follows past the Zoological Gardens (p. 80), to the N. end of Gizeh
(station, Gizch Village, p. 80), the terminus of tramway No. 15
(p. 39). [The route vie the island of Roda, which the tramway
follows when the Btlltlr Bridge is open (see p. 79), diverges to the
right from the line to Old Cairo, about 750 yds. to the S. of the
water-tower (p. 104), crosses the narrow branch of the Nile by the
lil-Malek ee-Sdleb Bridge, traverses the island of Réda, and crosses
the main arm of the Nile by the 'Abbc‘is ff. Bridge (595 yds. long;
open IO-il a.m. and 3.30-4.30 pun. for the passage of ships). It then
runs to the W. to Gizeh.] Thence the road to the Pyramids (SMri'
el-Haram), which the tramway follows, crosses a canal and intersects
the Upper Egypt Railway (station; Gizeh railway station lies ca.
5 min. to the S., p.143). After crossing a secoml canalit leads straight
towards the Pyramids, which are still nearly 5 M. distant. On the
left lie the huts of two fellahin villages, E.t- Talibiyeh and K6111 el-.
Akhdar (tramway-station). The fields on each side are intersected by
canals. The huge angular forms of the Pyramids gradually become
more distinct, and soon stand out in clear outlines.

At the terminus of the tramway, on the edge of the desert, are
the extensive buildings of the Mena House Hotel (p. 36); opposite
are a police-office, a post-office, a drug-store, and other shops. The
road goes on in curves up the steep N. slope of the plateau on
which the Pyramids stand.
