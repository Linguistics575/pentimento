184 Routc12. THE SUEZ CANAL. Statistics.

On March 18th, 1869, the water of the Mediterranean was at
length allowed to flow into the nearly dry, salt-encrusted basins of
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of which lay 26-40 ft. below the
level of the Mediterranean, while the S. parts required extensive
dredging operations. The opening of the Suez Canal was inaugurated
on Nov. 17th, 1869, with magnificent festivities in the presence
of many European princes.

The cost of constructing the canal amounted to about 19 million
pounds sterling, of which 12,800,000t. was paid by the shareholders,
while the rest of the sum was almost entirely contributed by the
Khedive. In 1875, however, the British Government acquired
177,000 of the Khedive's shares for a sum of4,000,0001. The canal
belongs to the Suez Canal Company (Compagnie Universclle du Canal
Maritime de Sues), founded in 1854, which possesses also lands,
buildings, and other property, valued at nearly 3,000,000l.

The canal is 161 kilemétres (100 M.) in length, and the E.
bank is furnished with distance-posts at intervals of 5 kilométres.
Near the stations are passiug-plaees for the large steamers, named
‘Gare du Nord' and 'Gare du Sud' respectively. The canal is now
throughout 36ft. in depth, admitting vessels drawing 28 ft. of water.
The surface varies in breadth from 260 to 445 ft., while the minimum
width of the bottom is 147 ft.

The great mercantile importance of the Suez Canal is apparent from
the following data. The distance from London to Bombay vit the Cape
of Good Hope is 12,548 English miles, and via the Canal 7028 M. only.
The saving thus effected is 44 per cent of the distance. From Hamburg to
Bombay by the Cape 12,903 N., by the Canal 7383 M.; saving 43 per cent.
From Trieste to Bombay by the Cape 13,229 M., by the Cana14816 M.; saving
63 per cent. From London to Hongkong by the Cape 15,229 M., by the Canal
11,112 M., saving 28 per cent. From Odessa to Hongkong by the Cape
16,629 M., by the Canal 8735 M.., saving 47 per cent. From Marseilles to
Bombay by the Cape 12,144 M., by the Canal 5022 IR.; saving 59 per cent.
From Constantinople to Zanzibar by the Cape 10,271 M., by the Canal
4365 31.; saving 57 per cent. From Rotterdam to the Sunda Strait by the
Cape 13,252 N., by the Canal 9779 M.-, saving 26 per cent.

The canal is open both by day and by night to vessels of all nation-
alilies. The following table illustrates the growth of traffle: -
