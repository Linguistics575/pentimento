of its walls may be recognized also in the sloping banks of the
Baht tieileh el-Gedid. There is no doubt that this edifice was the
famous labyrinth, of which ancient travellers speak with such

unbounded admiration.

For the best description we are indebted to Strabo, who visited the
Labyrinth in person. He says: 'There is also the Labyrinth here, awork
as important as the Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king
who built the Labyrinth. After advancing about 30-ft0 stadia beyond the
first entrance of the canal we reach a tahle-shaped surface, on which
rise a small town and a vast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings
as there were formerly nomes. For there is that precise number of courts
bordered with columns and adjoining each other, all being in the same
row, and forming, one building, like a long, wall having the courts in front
of it. The entrances to the courts are on the opposite side from the wall. .
In front of the entrances are numerous long covered passages, intersect-
ing each other and thus forming such a winding path that a stranger
cannot find his way into or out of each court without a guide. It is a
marvellous fact that each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of a
single stone, and also that the passages are covered in the same way
with single slabs of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building
material having been employed. On ascending to the roof, the height of
which is inconsiderable as there is only one story, we have a survey of
the flat stone surface consisting of these large slabs. On emerging from
the covered passages we have a view of them extending in one line, each
borne by twenty-seven monolithic columns. The walls also are constructed
of stones of similar size. At the end of this structure, which is more
than a stadium in length, is the tomb, consisting of a square pyramid,
each side of which is four plethra (400 ft.) in length, and of equal height.
The deceased who is buried here is called lmandes. It is asserted that
so many palaces were bnilt because it was the custom for all the nomes,
represented by their magnates, with their priests and victims, to assemble
here to offer saeritiee and gifts to the gods, and to deliberate on the most
important concerns. Each nome then took possession of the hall destined
for it.'

The remains of brick buildings, which still linger on the mounds
of rubbish to the E. of the temple and were erroneously regarded
by Lepsins as remains of the Labyrinth, date from a village of the
Roman period. -- To the N. of the pyramid stretches the large Ne-
eropolis used since the period of the Middle Empire by the richer
inhabitants of Shetet-Crocodilopolis (p. 192).

The RETURN to Mediuet el-Faiytun may be made in ll/Or. with-
out again touching llaxvaret el-Mahta', as follows. We cross the
Baht Seileh tsl-Credit] (p. 194) and ride along its W. bank for some
distance, next continue in a W. direction through the fields, and
then cross the filled-in Balw el- dei (p. 191), which is partly culti-
vated and partly covered with reeds. We next proceed through
desert and fertile land to the village of J.ruht/'elt (p.194), charm-
ingly situated on the Baht Ytistsf, whence we follow the railway-
embankment to the town.

3. The Pyramid of 1llahiin, the tomb of Sesosiris ff., is most
easily visited (201mm) from Bash-Knit, (p. 194) or Illah% (p.194).
The pyramid is constructed of Nile bricks, piled up upon a rocky
nucleus bearing a star-shaped framework of low walls built of
massivejimestone blocks.
