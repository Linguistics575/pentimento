Small Temple. ABU SIMBEL. 30. Route. 409

*Temple of Hathor. This temple is hewn in a rock separated by
a valley from the great temple. It also was founded by Ramses ll.
and was dedicated to 1lathor and to the
deitied Nefret-ere, consort of Ramses. The
facade is turned more to the S. than that of
the great temple. The quay on the river and
the approach thence to the entrance have
been washed away.

The FAgADE, 92 ft. long and M) ft. high,
is hewn in imitation of a pylon with reeed-
ing front, crowned by a concave cornice. The
cornice, however, has fallen. On each side
ot' the narrow entrance, with their backs
against the facade, are three Colossal Statues,
33ft. in height, representing Ramses II. and Nefret-ere. Beside
these are smaller figures of the royal children : beside the colossi ot'
. the queen are the princesses Merit-A-mun(rig11t) and Hent-tcwe
(left); beside the outer colossi of the king are the princes Meri-.
Atum (right) and Me-ri-RE (left); and beside the colossi of the king
on the right and left of the door are the princes Amen-her-khopshef
(right) and Ra-her-wnamf (left). On the receding fagade are pro-
jecting parts resembling buttresses. separating the colossi, so that
each of the latter appears to he in a kind of niche. On these but-
tresses are votive inscriptions.

We now enter the HYPOSTYLE HALL (P1. A), the roof of which
is borne by six pillars, decorated in front with sistra with the head
of llathor, while the other sides bear representations of the king,
the queen, and various deities.

Three doors lead into a TRANSVERSE CHAMBER (P1. B), with utr-
important mural reliefs. Adjoining are two rooms, barely begun,
over the doors of which are tasteful reliefs of the Hathor cow in a
papyrus marsh, worshipped in one case by the king, in the other by
the queen. From the Transverse Chamber we enter the SANCTUARY
(Pl. C). In the rear wall is a chapel-shaped recess, with its roof
supported by sistra. Within this is a high relief, representing (full
face) a figure of Hathor in the form of a cow, below the head of
which appears the king under her protection. On the Right Wall
the queen offers incense to Mat and Hathor; on the Left Walt the
king offers incense and pours a libation before his own image and
