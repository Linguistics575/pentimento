the back were dedicated to different deities. Those to the left of
Room Jwere devoted to Osiris. One has a vaulted ceiling, with
astronomical representations. From Room G a staircase ascended to
other chambers on the upper floor.

The great hypostyle hall is adjoined also at the sides (N. and S.)
by two series of rooms (P1. 1-1 1), of which those to the s. formed
the Treasury of the temple.

The Represimtatiorts 0n the walls of these freasure-ehambers refer to
the costly objects stored within them. Room I.. The king presents Amen
with papyrus-holders borne by lions with the king's head or by kneeling
iigures of the king. Room 2: The king presents to Amon costly vessels
and boxes with lids in the shape of rams or sphinxes or of the heads of
rams, falcons, or kings. Room 3.- The king presents Amen with sacks
of precious stones. Room 4: The king offers costly tahle-serviees, orna-
ments, golden harps, silver, and lead. Room .5: The king offers heaps
of gold and other precious metals. - In Rooms 6-11 we see the king
sacrificing to various deities. In Room l" the princes and princesses pre-
sent gifts to the king and queen. In Room 10 stands a colossal alabaster
statue of Ptah (headless), dating from the time of Amenophis III. (found
in the first court).

We now quit the temple and proceed to examine the interesting
Historical Reliefs on the Outside of the Temple Walls, which chiefly
commemorate the wars of Ramses Ill.

We begin with the *S. WALL, the first pylon of which (PI. w)
is adorned with admirable hnnting-scenes. Above is the king hunt-
ing mountain-goats and wild asses; below he appears with his
retinue, pursuing wild bulls in a marshy district abounding with
fish and water-fowl.

On the IV. part of the S. wall is a long Festival Calendar, which con-
tains a list of the appointed sacrifices for the period, between the 26th
Pakhons (the day of Ramses III.'s accession) and the 19th Tyhi. Beneath
is a procession of priests, carrying food. - To the right and left of the
balcony-window of the palace (p.321), to which a tlight of steps ascends,
the king appears in the act of slaying his prisoners. 1n the embrasure
of the window the king and his retinue are seen going from the palace to
the temple.
