andd ft. high, built of five massive blocks of alabaster. On the S. side of
the Obelisk is a ruined chapel, which was embellished with admirable
reliefs (now in the museums of Cairo and Berlin). On the N. side of the
obelisk was another sacrificial court. The N. side of the court was
tlanked by treasure-huuses, reached from the entrance-gate by a passage
(to the right) similar to that described on p. 140. To the S. of the temple
lie the brick foundations of a boat of the sun. - The temple was connected
by a covered causeway with a gateway situated in the valley near the
N.E. slope of the hill.

The three largest Pyramids of Abusir, erected by kings of the
5th Dyn., stand close together, about 1 M. to the S.W. of the sanc-
tuary of Abu Guréb (comp. the Inset Plan 11 at p. 145). They were
explored in 1002-8 by the German Oriental Society under Dr. Bor-
chardt. lhe masonry of these monuments, having originally been
constructed with no great care, is now much damaged. The entran-
ces are on the N. sides, and the interior chambers are almost com-
pletely in ruins. T

The northernmost of the pyramids is the PYRAMID OF erG
SEHUEE. Its perpendicular height was 1623/4 ft. (now lit) ft.), its
sides were 257 ft. (now 216 ft.) in length, and they were inclined
at the angle of 5io d'?.,' 35". On the E. side of the pyramid lie
the extensive remains of the Mortuary Temple, to which a slightly
sloping causeway ascended from the small temple in the valley. The
long vestibule on the E. side of the temple opens into a passage,
which surrounds the following court on the E., N., and S. sides.
The large Colonnaded Court, the centre of the building, possesses
a well-preserved pavement of black basalt. Fragments of the sixteen
granite palm-columns (p. clsi ), which once supported the roof of the
cotonuade around the walls of the court, are scattered about. The
court is adjoined by a Transverse Room, which practically forms the
W. side of the above-mentioned passage, and by a Room with Five
Recesses, in which stood statues of the king. A sitle-iloor on the left
admits to the narrow passages leading to the Sanctuary, in whieh, at
the foot of the pyramid, stood the large door-shaped stele. Among
the other apartments we may note the Starcrcmms for the Sacrificial
O/rerittgs, a series of two-storied chambers on the S. side, and the
two-storied Treasuries on the N. side. At the S.E. angle of the
pyramid, in a separate court with a side-entrance flanked by two
tree-trnnk columns (p. clviii), stands the small Queen‘s Pyramid.

Nest, to the S., is the PYRAMID or Nusmnf-z, to which an easy
winding path ascends (fine panorama). It, too, had a mortuary temple
on the E. side. From the plain a sloping causeway ascends to the
main entrance and the forecourt, on each side of which lie store-
rooms. This is adjoined by an open court, witheolumns andahasaltic
pavement. Fragments of the granite papyrus-columns lie scattered
about. The following chambers, extending to the N. at the base of
the pyramid, are in a very ruinous state. To the N. of the temple are
some large Muyabas of the time of the 5th Dynasty. At the S.E.
corner of the pyramid is a smaller pyramid, perhaps that of the
