238 Route ith ABYDOS. Temple

The most important part of ancient Abydos was its extensive
Necropolis, situated in the desert. Four distinct sections are clearly
traceable. In the southernmost, beside El-.Uriba (p. 237), are tombs
of the New Empire and the temples of Sethos and Ramses. To the
N. of this rises a hill, with graves dating from the close of the An-
eient Empire. Still farther to the N., between the sanctuary of Osiris
(K6111 es-Sultin) and the tomb of Slninet ez-Zebib (p. 243), are
the tombs of the Middle Empire, many in the form of small brick
pyramids. Here are found also graves of the 18-20th Dyn. and of
the later period. Finally, in the hill of Umm el-Oarth (p. 243), to
the W., are the tombs of the kings of the earliest dynasties and
the sacred grave of Osiris. - The chief centre of interest is the -

*Temple of Sethos I., the Memnonium of Strabo. This won-
derful structure, built by Sethosl. and completed by Ramses 11., was
almost completely excavated in 1859 by Mariette, at the expense
of the Viceroy Sarid, The walls consist of tine-grained limestone,
while a harder variety has been selected for the columns, archi-
traves, door-posts, and other burden-bearing portions. The Beliefs
dating from the reign of Sethos l. are among the finest productions
of Egyptian sculpture of any age.

The ground-plan differs materially from that of other great
Egyptian temples. Instead of one sanctuary it has seven, dedicated
to Osiris, Isis, Horus, Ptah, Harakhte, Amon, and the deified
king; and as each of these had a special eult the entire front por-
tion of the temple is divided into seven parts, each with its separate
gateway and portals. The chambers behind the sanctuaries are not
arranged behind each other as in other temples, but side by side.
Another remarkable peculiarity consists in the wing (p. 241) con-
taining various halls, chambers, ete., whieh stands at right angles
to the main building (comp. p. Clxvi).

We enter the temple from the N.E. The first pylon is in ruins
and the first court is still occupied by modern huts.

The Second Court, which opens to the S. on the temple proper,
is in better preservation. The sons and daughters of Ramses II.
were represented on the wall on the inner side of the pylon, but
the figures and inscriptions have been almost effaeed. On the right
and left walls appears 'lamses IL, saerifieing to different gods; On
each side are steles of Ramses II. At the back of the court a
low incline ascends to the vestibule of the temple proper, which
is supported by 12 square piers of limestone and originally had
seven doors in its rear wall. On the wall, to the left of the main
entrance, is a Large Inscription in 9:3 vertical lines, in which
Ramses 11. describes in florid language the completion of the temple.
In the adjoining relief Ramses is shown presenting an image of the
goddess Meat to a triad consisting of Osiris, Isis, and his father
Sethos L, who takes the place of Horus. On the wall are other
representations of Ramses in presence of the gods. - The seven
