The MAIN CHAMBER. was divided by two pairs of columns into
three slightly vaulted sections. The scenes and inscriptions here
are much faded and therefore difficult to distinguish. At the foot
of the wall is a long inscription cutin the rock, in vertical lines ofa
greenish colour, 21/2 ft. high, containing the foregoing interesting

were cut out of the rock by some vandal hand.

Entrance Wall (W.). Over the door we see the statue of the
deceased being transported to the temple, preceded by female
dancers in curious attitudes; below is the deceased, watching ear-
penters at work. To the Left (N.) of the door is the estate-office of

describes them as 37 Amus (ale. Semitic Beduins) bringing eye-
