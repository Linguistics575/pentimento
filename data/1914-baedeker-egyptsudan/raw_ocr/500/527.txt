Temple o/â€˜Amon. Tussss w. BANK). 20. Route, 267

fivts broken shafts on the left side and one complete column (with
oalyx-eapital and abacus) on the right. This structure had a door on
each of its four sides ; in front of the W. door is a recumbent Sphinx.

Upon the complete column, on the right, Psammetichos 11. (26th Dyn.)
has placed his name over that of the Ethiopian Taharka (25th Dyn.); be-
side it is the name of Ptolemy IV. Pl1ilopator, which appears also on the
abacus. The shaft is composed of 25 courses of carefully hewn stone, the
capital of 5 courses. The height is 60 ft.; the greatest breadth of the
capital 16 ft., the circumference at the top do ft. The columns were united
by means of stone screens, dating from the reign of Philopator.

A door in the N. walk of the eolnnnade surrounding the great court
leads out of the temple, and from this point we may skirt the outer wall
to the left to the steps leading to the top of the First Pylon (see p. 266).

To the right, facing the great court, is the *Tmrr1m or' RAM-.
sss 111., which was dedicated to Amon. it is perhaps the best ex-
tant specimen of a simple Egyptian temple, built throughout on a
single homogeneous plan. Its total length is 170 ft.

The Pylon with the entrance-door, which has two statues of the
king, is much injured, especially at the top. On the exterior of the
left tower (E.) Ramses 111., with the double crown, smites a band
of prisoners with his club. Amon, in front of him, hands him the
sword of victory and delivers to him chained together the repre-
sentatives of the vanquished peoples, who appear in three rows. In
the two upper rows are the conquered nations of the south, in the
third row those of the north. On the right wing are similar repre-
sentations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower Egypt. In the
doorway Ramses III. receives from Amen the symbol of life, etc.

Beyond the pylon is an open Court, flanked by covered passages.
The roofs of these passages are each supported by eight pillars,
against which lean colossal figures of Ramses 111. as Osiris.

On the rear walls of the pylnn-towers, facing the court, are represent-
ations of Ramses III. receiving from Amon the hieroglyphic for 'jubilee',
as a sign that the king would yet celebrate many jubilees. - The walls
of the colonnedes are embellished with reliefs: in the E. arcade, the pro-
cession of the sacred boat of Amen; in the W. arcade, a procession with
the statue of the ithyphallie Amen, borne by priests and accompanied by
standard-bearers. -- The arehitraves hear llorid dedicatory inscriptions,
recording that Ramses III. erected this monument in honour of his father
Amen. - A door in the left colouuade opens into the Portico of the
Buhastides (p.268); and one in the right coiunnade (now built up) ad-
mitted to the S. colunnade of the great court.

The court is adjoined by the Vestibule or Pronaos of the temple,
which latter is on a higher level. It is supported in front by four
Osiris-pillars, and in the rear by four columns with bud-capitals.
The pillars are united by stone screens adorned with reliefs.

From the vestibule a door leads into a Hypostyle Hall, with eight
columns with bud-capitals. Adjoining are three Chapels, dedicated
respectively to Amen (in the middle), Mut (left), and Khons (fight),
and each containing representations of the king sacrificing to the
boat of the respective god. Beside the chapel of Khons is another
chamber, and beside the chapel of Nut is a staircase, while beyond
the chapel of Amon, on each side, is a chamber.
