VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART. clxix

each of which was lower than the one inside it. A STEP Maerua
(step-pyramid) was thus developed, such as may still be seen in
the step-pyramid at Salilrira and the pyramid at Meidthn (comp.
pp. 146, 205). The normal form
of smooth pyramid was evolved
from the step-pyramid at the
beginning of the 4th Dyn., and
theneeforward it remained the
usual form for royal tombs until
the 18th Dynasty. In the rock
beneath the massive stone crec-
tion of the pyramid a sloping
shaft (P1. a) led to a sgnbterran-
can passage, closed by means
of a stone trap-door, and to the
chamber (P1. 6) in which the
sarcophagus stood. The great
pyramids at Gizeh, the step-
pyramid at Salsliira, and various
others contain several passages and se veral chambers, but the exist-
ence of these is due to modifications of the original plan or to
later alterations (pp. 125, 126]. The inner rooms of the pyramids,
and particularly the sarcophagus-chambers, which were made in-
accessible after the interment, were almost entirely destitute ol"
ornament in the ancient period. It was not until the end of the
5th Dyn. that it began to be customary to adorn the walls with re-
ligious texts (the so-called 'Pyramid Texts'). The recess or the
room in which sacrifices were offered to the dead in the magtahas
was represented in the case of the pyramids by a detached temple
on the E. side. These temples were divided into two portions, one
public, the other private. The centre of the public portion was oc-
cupied by a large open court, surrounded with arcades, off which
opened five chambers for the statues of the deceased monarch; the
principal apartment in the private temple was the sanctuary con-
taining the stele. On the edge of the cultivated land, moreover,
stood a temple. forming a monumental getaway, rising on a terrace
and connected by a long covered approach with the mortuary temple,
which lay on the ilesert-plateam The walls of the pyramid-tetnies
of the 4th Dyn. were left bare, but those of the temple at Ahueir
are partly covered with reliefs, which to some extent display the
same types as are seen in the temples of the gods (the king as a
gritf'm triumphing over foreign foes, booty captured from the enemy,
military campaigns, etc.) The best preserved mortuary temples of
the Ancient Empire are the temple beside the pyramid of Meidthn
(p. 205; apparently unfinished), the temples of Khephren and My-
kerinos beside the pyramids of Gizeh (pp.132, 133), and those of
Sehuré, Nefer-er-ke-rii, and Nuserré at Abuyir (p. 141). Less is known
