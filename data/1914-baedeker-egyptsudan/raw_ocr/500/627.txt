before the falcon-headed Haroéris, to whom the left half of the
temple is dedicated. The screens are crowned by a row of serpents,
with sun-disks on their heads.

The VESTIBULE, " Pronaos, contains io columns with rich floral
and palm capitals. 0n the shafts appears Neos Dionysos saerifieing
to the gods. The ceiling of the two main aisles is embellished with
flying vultures; while the under side of the arehitraves supporting
this ceiling bears astronomical designs (star-godsin their boats, etc.).
We may observe the lines dividing the surface into squares to guide
the artist in drawing the figures, and also some older sketches that
were not carried to completion. The mural reliefs here are Bspe-
cially beautiful, the finest being that to the right of the N. portal
(on screen h). We here see the king (Neos Dionysos), in pre-
sence of Haroe'ris (to the right), being blessed by a lion-headed Isis
and the falcon-headed Harsiésis, on the right, and by the goddess
Nut and the ibis-headed Thout, on the left.

The remaining mural reliefs may be inspected by those who are not
pressed for time. On Screen i: the guardian-goddesses of Upper and
Lower Egypt blessing the king (Neos Dionysos); to the left stand the cre-
codiic-headed Sohek and his companion Hathor. - To the left, above
the small Door k.. Neos Dionysus sacrificing to four fabulous monsters
(including l winged lion with four heads); the animals have been scratched
out. - Opposite, on Wall l, are three rows. Bottom Row: to the right are
Euergetes II. and Cleopatra (upper parts wanting) in presence of Sobek
and his fellow-gods HathOr and P-neb-tewe; in the middle, the king before
the falcon-headed Baroéris and the 'good sister", to the left Euergetes
presents the temple of Ombos to Sobek and Hathor. Middle Row: to the
right the king (wanting) sacrifices to Osiris enthroned, Isis (hefore whom
is her youthful son), and Nephthys; in the middle Energetes presents flowers
to the earth-god Keb and the sky-goddess Nut; to the left Euergete: offers
two jars of wine to Show and the lion-headed Tefnut. Top Row: to the
right, the king (wanting) before Haroiiris, the 'good sister', and P-neh-tewe;
in the middle he offers an ornament to Sobek and Khons-Hor; to the left
Eucrgetes offers milk to Sobek and Hathor. - On Walt m, to the left of
the left entrance to the next room, are three rows of similar scenes.

The HYPOSTYLE HALL. is entered by two doors. Its ceiling,
which was lower than that of the pronaos, was supported by
10 columns with floral capitals. On each shaft Euergetes II. is
shown saerifiiflng to a god; the mural reliefs show him in communion
with the gods. The relief on the left (N.) wall should he noticed:
the falcon-headed Haroéris presents the curved sword to Euer-
getes II., behind whom are his sister Cleopatra and his wife of the
same name. The sacred crocodile of Ombos is represented at Pl. l
between the doors leading from the pronaos.

Between the doors leading hence to the inner rooms of the temple are
reliefs showing Philometor, elder brother of Euergetes 11., sacrificing to
the falcon-headed Haroéris.

The following three smaller ANTECHAMBERS, each of which lies
a little higher than the preceding, also are embellished with fine
reliefs. Adjoining are a number of side-ehamhers, which may have
been used as store-rooms; those to the left (N.) have almost com-
pletely disappeared. 0n the rear wall of Antechamber HI, between
