(p. 418), but the amount is refunded if the article is re-exported
within a year, on production of the customs receipt (eertifieat du
payement de droits en ilépt5t). The duty is paid at the port of entry
or in the Bonded Warehouse in Cairo. In case of dif'f1et1lty or dis-

pute one of the higher offieials should be appealed to.

Good, though somewhat expensive, cigars may be obtained in Cairo
and Alexandria. The importation of onis's own cigars is attended with so
much trauble as hardly to be worth while. The traveller is recommended
to content himself with cigarettes (comp. p.41). Tobacco (Dukhkhan) should
be purchased in small quantities only, as it gets dry very soon.

(3). Co nveyances.

Steamers. The necessary information about the steamer-lines
between Europe and Egypt is given at pp. 1-6. For the Nile
steamers to Upper Egypt, see p. 201 , to Lower Nubia, see p. 383;
in the Stulitn, see p. 417.

Railways. The offieial time-tables are published in the Indi-
cateur des Chemins de Fer de l’Egypte, Which is sold for 10 mill. at the
chief railway stations, at the Cairo central telegraph oftiee, and at
the booksellers'. Time-tables are exhibited also in the larger hotels.
The railway-earriages resemble those of France or Italy. First-class
pa ssengers are permitted to take a reasonable quantity of small lug-.
gage with them into the carriages. The styeond-ilass carriages are
comfortable enough for day-jourueys on the main routes(Alexandria
to Cairo, Cairo to Manfra, Cairo to Port Sail or Suez, Cairo to
Assuan), especially by the express-trains; and their use effects a
saving of 50 per cent in fares. But on branch-lines all travellers
should take first-class tickets, especially at night. The third-class
carriages are quite unsuited for Europeans.

The trains are not much slower than in Europe and are very
punctual. The traveller should be at the station in good time, espe-
eially as heavy luggage must be booked 'h hr. before the departure
of the train. The Iuggage-tariff is somewhat complicated. Hand-
luggage up to 551bs. is free. The cloak-room charge is 5 milliémes
each package per day. Passenger-fares are calculated on a zone-
system, applicable to both express and slow trains (ist el. c, mill.
per kilomF-tre up to 50 Kil.; trt-loo ki1., 41/2 mill. per ki].; above
250 kil., 21/2 mill.'). Passengcr-tickets are printed in French aml
Arabic; luggage-tickets in Arabic only. A reduced tariff and cheap
return-tickets are in use on the Lignes de Banlieue or suburban
lines (between Cairo, Ifalytib, and the Barrage du Nil; between
Cairo, Mat.hrtyeh, and El-Marg; between Suez and Suez Docks;
between Alexandria, Ramleh, and Abnlit0. Returu-tickets at a re-
duction of 6 per cent on the double fare are issued to and from the
larger stations, but are valid for 4 days only. - In hot weather, the
dust, which penetrates the carriages even when the windows are
closed, renders railway travelling in Egypt exceedingly unpleasant.
At the chief stations on the express-routes there are Railway Buffets
