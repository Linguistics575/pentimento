however, paganism received its death-blow, and Theophilns, the
patriarch of Alexandria, displayed the utmost zeal in destroying
the heathen temples and monuments. It was at this time that the
famous statue of Serapis was burned. The material prosperity
of the city also fell off so greatly that the municipality was no
longer able to defray the cost of cleansing the Nile and keeping
the canals open. The revenues of Alexandria were still further
diminished by the proceedings of the patriarch Cyril, who led the
armed mob against the synagogues and expelled the Jews from the
city; and in 415 the learned and beautiful pagan Hypatia, daugh-
ter of the mathematician Theou, was cruelly murdered by an in-.
furiated crowd. Under Justinian (i"Al7-'Cob'5) all the still existing:
heathen schools were finally closed.

111619 Alexandria was captured by Chosroo ff., liing of Persia,
but the Christians were left unmolested. Ten years later Heraclius
recovered possession of Egypt, but the troops of the Caliph Omar
soon afterwards invaded the country and took_Alesandria after a
prolonged siege. In October, (Ut, 'Amr ibn el-'Ni, Omar's general,
entered the city; but he treated the inhabitants with moderation.
The decline of Alexandria now became rapid in the same propor-
tion as the growing prosperity of the newly-founded capital on the
Nile, the modern Cairo, and its commerce received a death-blow
by the discovery of America and of the sea-route to India round
the Cape of Good Hope.

The decay of the once powerful seaport, which contained only
5000 inhab. in 1800, was at length effectually arrested by the
vigorous hand of Mohammad Ali (p. cxx), who improved the har-.
hours and constructed several canals. The chief benetit he con-
ferred on Alexandria was the construction of the. Nalmtfaityeh Canal
(p. 12), begun in 1819 and named after the reigning Sultan Nab-
1ntoil H. Through this channel the adjoining tields were irrigated
anew and Alexandria was again connected with the Nile and the rest
of Egypt, the products of which had long found their only outlets
through the Rosetta and Damietta mouths of the river. Subsequent
viceroys also made great efforts to improve the position of the town.
It suffo,re,il severely, however, duringArabrs rising in 1882 (p. cxxiii),
and a great part of the European quarter was laid in ashes; but all
traces of this misfortune have disappeared and the town is again
quite prosperous.

The great centre of European life is the long Place Méhémet
A1i(l’l. F, i), or Place des Consuls, which is embellished w ith trees.
ln the centre rises the Equestrian Statue of Mohammad Ali (Pl. 3;
see above), designed by Jaequemart and cast in Paris. The statue
stands od a pedestal of Tuscan marble. This square was the prin-
cipal scene of destruction in 1882. On the N.E. side stands the
