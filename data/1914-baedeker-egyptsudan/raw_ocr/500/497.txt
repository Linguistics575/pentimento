ing and otfering a statuette of the god Elli to four images of Hathor. -
On the walls of Crypt No. 7 (entered through an opening in the pavement
of the small sacrificial court) Ptolemy XIII. appears presenting gifts (chiefly
ornaments) to various gods. - Crypts Nos. 1 ak 2, arranged above each
other in two stories, are interesting also; they are most conveniently ac-
cessible from Room

We return to the first antechamber (p. 247) and ascend one
of the Staircases which lead thence to the roof of the temple.
The EAST STAIRCASE, which ascends straight to the roof with easy
steps, is dark. The WEST STAIRCASE is a kind of spiral staircase,
with ten rectangular bends, lighted by several windows, with
tasteful symbolical representations of the sun shining through
them. The walls of both staircases are embellished with reliefs of
the ceremonial procession of the priests with the images of Hathor
and her fellow-gods at the great new year's festival. The left wall
presents us with a view of the procession ascending from the lower
rooms of the temple to the roof, in order that 'the goddess Hathor
might be united with the beams of her father IIE' (the sun-god); the
right wall shows the procession descending. The priests are headed
by the king; some of them wear masks representing the lesser deities.
- The W. staircase passes a small room [situated above the store-
room adjoining the second antechamber) with three windows look-.
ing into the court. Higher up is a small court with two rooms
opening off it, corresponding to the chambers on the E. side of the
terrace (see below) and likewise dedicated to the cult of Osiris.
The reliefs in the second room represent the resuscitation of Osiris.

We now reach the Temple Roof, which has various levels, the
highest being above the great vestibule or pronaos (p. 246). At
the S.W. angle of the lower terrace, which we reach first, stands a
small open Pavilion, supported by '12 sistnom-eolumns with heads
of Hathor. Adjoining the terrace on the N. is a small Shrine of Osiris,
situated above the chambers to the left of the hypostyle hall and used
in the worship ofthe slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations
and numerous inscriptions indicate. The second room is separated
from the first (an open court) by pillars, and formerly contained the
famous Zodiac of Dendera (now in the Bibliothtque Nationale at
Paris), the only circular representation ofthe heavens found in Egypt.
The remaining portion of the ceiling still shows two figures of the
goddess of heaven. The window in the last room, with represent-
ations of Osiris resting upon a bier, deserves attention. - A flight
of steps ascends from the N.W. end of the terrace to the roof of the
first antechambcr and thence to the still higher roof of the hypostyle
hall. Thence a modern iron staircase leads to the roof of the
pronaos, which commands a beautiful view of the valley of the Nile
and the hills of the desert.

Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found
interesting. The exterior walls are covered with inscriptions and
representations. The reliefs on the Fl. and W. walls date from the
