Instead of the Arabic names of the months used in Syria, the
Egyptians employ the Coptic [ancient Egyptian] names of the solar
months, which, however, are always about nine days behind the
European months. Each Coptic month has thirty days, and in
order to complete the year five or six interealary days are added at
the end (in the beginning of September). The European names,
however, are gradually coming into general use.
