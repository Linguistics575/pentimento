The Sphinx, PYRAMIDS OF oiZEH. 6. Route. 135

The "Sphinx, which next to the Pyramids themselves is the
most famous monument in this vast burial-ground, is hewn out of
the natural rock and, with some aid from added blocks of stone, has
been moulded into the shape of a recumbent lion with the head of
a king wearing the royal head-cloth, adorned with the royal serpent.
Originally it was probably a natural rock which from a distance
somewhat resembled a lion. It was no doubt the workmen engaged
in building the tomb of Khephren who improved this resemblance
with the help of blocks of stone and carved the face in the likeness
of Khephren. Afterwards it was taken for the sun-god and named
Harmachis (Le. 'Horus on the horizon'). In front of the breast
was once an image of a god. The head is now deplorably mutilated;
the neck has become too thin, the nose and beard have been broken
off, and the reddish tint which enlivened the face has almost dis-
appeared. But in spite of all injuries it preserves even now an
impressive expression of strength and majesty. The entire height
of the monument, from the pavement to the crown of the head, is
said to be 66 ft., while its length from the fore-paws to the root
of the tail is 187 ft. The ear, according to Mariette, is 41/2 ft., the
nose 5 ft. 7 in., and the mouth 7 ft. 7 in. in length; and the extreme
breadth of the face is 13 ft. 8 inches. If the traveller stands on the
upper part of the ear he cannot stretch his hand as far as the crown
o t' the head. There is a hollow in the head.

The Excavation of the Sphinx, so far as is now known, was first under-
taken by Thutmosis IV. (see below). Daring the Ptolemaic and Roman
periods the colossus was several times restored and was highly admired
and revered, as numerous inscriptions Upon it testify. Curiously enough,
the Sphinx was mentioned neither by Herodotus nor by any later Greek
traveller. The mntilations which now disfigure it date from the Arab
domination. In 1380 it fell a victim- to the ieonoelastie zeal of a fanatic
sheikh, and it was afterwards used as a target by the barbarous Mamelnkes.
- In the 19th century the Sphinx was ihrst completely excavated by Cavigtia
(p. 126), at the cost(450t.) of an English society. He discovered the flight
of steps which ascended to the stupendous monument, and also found be-
tween the paws of the lion a carefully laid pavement, at the end of which
next to the breast of the Sphinx rose a kind of open temple. The latter
was enclosed by two partitions, through which ran a passage, in the middle
of which was a small figure of a recumbent lion, facing the Sphinx. In the
background and at each side were memorial stones erected by Thutmosis IV.
and Ramses II. The Sphinx was again excavated by Maspero in i880. At
present, however, the Sphinx is much sanded up so that the above-
mentioned structures are no longer visible.

About 50 yds. to the S.E. of the Sphinx lies the large *Valley
Temple of Khephren, long known as the â€˜GRANITE Tmuua', dis-
covered by Mariette in 1853 and almost completely excavated by
the Yon Sieglin expedition in 1909-10. This was the sanctuary
erected as an entrance to the causeway which ascended from the
valley to the mortuary temple and pyramid of Khephren. It is a
fine example of the simple and majestic architecture of a period
when the art of working the hardest kinds of stone had already
attained perfection.
