of the temple which were dedicated to worship. In the first three Ante-
rooms the ground slopes down towards the Sanctuary, which was di-
vided into three small rooms at the back. The sanctuary is flanked by
two narrow passages, each of which is adjoined by three rooms. The ante-
rooms also have adjacent chambers from which we may enter the cellars
or ascend by two flights of steps to the upper floor, with its diiTerent apart-
ments, and thence to the roof, whence we obtain an extensive view of
the remains of the ancient city, of the lake, and the desert. Over the
doors leading into the second and third anteroomg and into the sanctuary,
instead of the ordinary concave cornice, there is a series of Uraeuesnakes.

To the E. of the large temple are situated two smaller temples,
in tolerable preservation. One of them, which has the same axis
as the large temple, is a kiosque, resembling in ground-plan the
kiosque of Phila (p. 370); the second and larger of the two is
situated 300 paces from the smaller. Its walls (18 ft. by 19 ft.)
consist of good burnt bricks and its substructures of solid stone.
The sanctuary terminates in a niche resembling an apse; 011 each
of the side-walls are two half-columns which, as the fragments
lying on the ground show, belong to the Ionic order.

of Hart: (Bum Harm, lie the ruins (including a temple of the crocodile-
god' Pnepheros) and the neeropolis of the ancient Peade.1ph.i,a. All these
places, which were founded under the early Ptolemies in the reclaimed
bed of Lake Merits, have been recently explored by the English travellers
Grenfell and Hunt.
