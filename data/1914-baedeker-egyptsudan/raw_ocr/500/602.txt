330 Route 90. THEBES (W. BANK). JO. Colossi

unknown, but it was re-creeted On this spot with blocks found immuved
in a Coptic building.

About 200 paces to the S. of the pavilion of Ramses III. (p. 322) is
a small unfinished Ptolemaic Temple, now known as Kay" el-'Ag0a, erected
by Euergetes 11. to Teephibis, a god of similar character to Thout. 1t con-
sists of a wide vestibule and three rooms, one behind another. On the
entranee-wall of the second room, to the left, we see the king saerificing
to Thout, lmhotep, and the deified sage Amenhotep; the lower row of
reliefs alone is ihaished, the others are merely sketched out. - About
1/2 M. to the w. lie the ruins of a town, including the remains of a
Palace of Amenophis III. (comp. pp.100, 102). The site, now known as
Maltata, has been excavated under the anspices of the Metropolitan
Museum of New York.

Still farther to the S. than the Ptolcrnaie temple, about 21/2131. from
Medinet llahu, on the road to Erment (p. 332), stands a well-preserved
Temple of the Roman Period, dedicated to Isis. and now known as Deir
esli-d0ielteit (key kept by the guardian at Medinet Habu). Itwas erected by
Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, while the ruined pylon bears the names of
Vespasian, Domitian, and 0th0. The temple consists of a celln. surrounded
by apartments. A staircase leads to the roof from a roam to the extreme
left of the entrance.

10. The Colossi of Memnon.

The *Colossi of,,Nemnon (called by the Arabs Es-Sananuh, and
also, of' late, Fal-l.x'olos.scit, i.e. 'the Colossi'), about 1/2 M. to the E.
of Medinet Hahn and about the same distance to the S. of the
Ramesseum, are the most prominent landmark on the W. bank at
Thebes and are visible from a great distance on all sides. These
two eolossal statues have suffered severely from the hand of time
and have lost their artistic, value, but they still exert all their old
attraction in virtue of the innumerable associations that cling to
them. The two immense figures and the cubical thrones on which
they are seated are carved out of a pebbly and quartzose sandstone-
conglomerate found in the sandstone mountains beyond Edfu, of a
yellowish-brown colour and very tliffiemlt to work. Both represent
Amenophis Ill. and they originally stood in front of the mortuary
temple erected by that monarch, of which only the seantiest relies
are now left. In the ltoman imperial epoch they were taken for
statues of Memnon, son of Eos and Tithonus, who slew Antilochus,
the brave son of Nestor, during the Trojan war, for which he was
himself slain by Achilles.

The S. Colossus is in better preservation than the N. one, but
there is little difference between them in point of size. The dimen-
sions of the former, in which the original form is more easily seen,
are as follows: height of the figure, 52 ft., height of the pedestal on
which the feet rest, 13 ft, height of the entire monument, 64 ft.
But when the figure was adorned with the long-since vanished
crown, the original height may have reached 69 ft. The legs from
the sole of the foot to the knee measure 19%, ft., and each foot is
101/2 ft. long. The breadth of the shoulders is 20 ft.; the middle
tiugor on one hand is 41/2 ft. long; and the arm from the tip
of the finger to the elbow measures 151/2 ft.
