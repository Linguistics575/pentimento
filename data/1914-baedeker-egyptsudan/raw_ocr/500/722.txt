afternoon of the same day Kitchener entered Omdurman. 'Abdallzlh (p. 430)
fled to the s., but on Nov. 24th, 1899, the remnants of his army were
annihilated at Umm Debreikiit or Deberikét, to the S.W. of Kosti (p. 433),
and he himself was slain.

The [wins of fldba, on the right bank of the Blue Nile, to the S.E.
of Ktrartiim, are most easily reached from (9 M.) the Mation of S6ha
(left bank of the river), 0n the railway from Khar.tiim to Senniir (see
below), by sailing heat or steamer in about 2 hrs. Near the landing-place
is a. government Rest House. Sdba was the capital of the Christian king-
dom of Alan, which existed until the middle ages. The extensive field
of the ruins is covered with fragments of baked bricks. The large tu-
muli rising here and there probably mark the sites of churches and public
buildings. One church, with granite columns, has been partly brought to
light. On the whole, however, there is little to see.

Longer Excursions to the Southern Siidlu1,

Longer excursions to the Southern Stiitn are mostly undertaken by
sportsmen. The inhospitable steppes of Kordofin swarm with game. The
expense of such excursions is necessarily great. and the equipment must
be very carefully selected. The Rawlway d. Steamboat Routes, however,
mentioned below, afford an excellent opportunity for those who wish to
become acquainted with the characteristic and wonderful scenery of the
Tropics. - For Caravan Journeys the best plan is to hire camels, with
the help of competent advice, in Irhar.ttsm. The rest of the equipment,
such as beds, cooking-utensils, and provisions, should be brought from
Enmpe or from Cairo (comp. p. 417).

with 16,000 inhab., the capital of the province of the Blue Nile,
lies near the eonfluence of the Rahad and the Blue Nile; it has broad
streets lined by the round straw-eovered huts of the natives (of the
Fung and Hamag tribes). On the river-bank stands the palace of
the Mtsilir with its beautiful tropical gardens.

During the winter season (Nov. to June) the Blue Nile is closed to
navigation but in summer (end of June to Out.) a steamer plies fortnightly
from Wad Medani vik Senndr (see below), Singa, the capital of the province
of Sennar, and Barankwa (Abu Na'ctma) to Itoseires (1540 ft.), on the right
bank of the Blue Nile. Higher up navigation is stopped by cataracts.

ride may be taken through the forest, in Which are large numbers .
of monkeys, to the ruins of Old Senntr, some miles downstream.
This town, which had ca. 20,000 inhab., was completely destroyed
by the Khalifa in 1885.

During the summer season there is a weekly steamer service from
Senniir to Barankwa (see above).

Beyond Sennér the railway turns towards the W. and traverses
the so-called tlesireh C'is1arrd'), the region between the Blue and
