About 11/2 li. to the S.E. of Shihiu el-rianii.tir is the ruined site of
Tall e1-Yehisd1yeh tllill of the Jews), the anéient Leontonpolt's. Ramses Ill.
erected a temple here, covered with glazed mosaic tiles, most of which
are now in the Cairo Museum. Their colouring is produced partly by
variations in the glazing and partly by the use of separate inlaid pieces
of glass. At a later date (170 8.0.] a Jewish bigh-priest named Unias,
aided by Ptolemy Philometor. erected a temple after the model of the
Temple of aolomou for his countrymen who had been expelled from
Jerusalem hy the Syrian party. A visit to the ruins scarcely repays the
trouble, as most of them are again buried in rubbish.

Zal.cifst.k {Zagasig} or Zagaziy, the capital of the province of Shar-
lityeh and the seat of a miidir, is a thriving, semi-European town,
with (1911) 40,000 irthabitante. Its si tuation 011 the Muuns {Muwcis
or Macs) Canal (the ancient Tanitie arm of the Nile, from which
the hIashtiit Canal here diverges to the R), in the midst of a fertile
district, is extremely favourable and has largely oontributed to the
prosperity of the town, whioh is the chief reutre of the Egyptian
t'otton and grain trade. Many European merrhauts have oftiees here,
and the large cotton faetories give parts of the town an almost Euro-
pean appearance. The American Mission maintains a girler' school

here. A market is held every Tuesday.

About 11/2 M. to the ti.E. of Zalfiizit, on the Telt Busta, lie the ruins
of the ancient Bubastis (Egyptian Per-Base; the Pi-beaeth of Ezekiel xxx. 17),
the capital of the Bubastite nome. Some of the remains of the brick
walls of the houses are of considerable height. The temple of Bastet, the
patron-goddess nf the town, at the S.W. foot of the hill, was excavated
in 1887-89 by Naville, at the expense of the Egypt Exploration Fund;
but the remains (granite blscka, columns, architraves, etc., some with
inscriptions, and a few statues) are in too ruinous a state to repay a
visit. The temple, begun by the p.sramid-bnilders Kheups and Khephren,
underwent frequent alteratios at the hands sf liamses ll. and other later
kings, but owed its final form to the munarchs of the 22nd Dym, who
resided at Bubastis, and to Nektancb% (Nektn-Har-ehbtit). At this period
it consisted of four large halls, of an aggregate length of 600 ft.; and
in these were celebrated the joyous and licentir-us festivals in honour of
Bastet. 'When the Egyptians travel to Buhastis'. says Herodotus, 'they
do 80 in this manner. Men and women sail together, and in each heat
there are many persnns ufhnth sexes. Some of the women make a noise
