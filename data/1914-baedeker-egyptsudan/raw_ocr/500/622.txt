attractive, commanding not only the most imposing survey of the
temple-buildings, but also ranging over the plain through which
the Nile flows, with its verdant crops and its villages fringed with
palms and mimosas, framed by the desert-mountains in the distance.

The Birth House lies to the W. of the entrance to the great
temple of Horus. It was built by Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, while
the interior decorations date from Soter II. It is surrounded by a
eolonnade, supported by pillars bearing figures of Bes (comp. p. 250).
Besides the main chamber there is a vestibule adjoined by two
small rooms. A staircase leads to the right from the vestibule to

the roof.

MAIN CHAMBER. On the right wall: Hathor of Dendera nurses Horus,
while seven other Hathers play musical instruments. Behind the goddess
is her youthful son Iilhi-wiir, with a sistrum. To the right is the con-
tinement of blather, to the left the king holding two sistra, in presence
of seven other Hathors. The king before various deities and (left)before
the saered boat of HathOr. On the left wall are scenes referring to the
birth of Harsnmtus (Khnum shaping the child on the Potter's wheel, etc.).

The Court in front ofthe Birth House was enclosed with columns
connected by stone screens. On the shafts of the columns are gods

with musical instruments.

68 M. STEAMBOAT to Gebel Silsileh in ihrs.; thence to Kém Omho in
3 hrs-, and thence to Assutm in 6 hrs.

Edfu, see p. 343. -rer On the E. bank, about 5 M. above Edfu, is
the village of Redesiyeh (El-Redesia, Rodsieh), after which a Temple
of Sethos f., lying 37 M. to the E., has been named (see p. 376). -
Farther along the E. bank (il?., M. from Edfu), on the mountain-
slopes approaching close to the river near the hill Es-flirt/r, are
the picturesque remains of a late-Byzantine fortified town (per-
haps the ancient Thmuis), with a church or convent. In the neigh-
bourhood are ancient quarries with inscriptions (one of Thut-.
mosis 111.). The nummulite limestone of the hills here gives place
to sandstone (comp. p. lxix), which has furnished the material for
most of the gigantic buildings of Upper Egypt.

2fl M. Gebel Silsileh ('Mountain of the Chain'; so called from a
chain that is said once to have blocked the passage of the river),
The hills on the two hanks of the river approach close together, and
in very ancient times there were probably rapids at this point (like
those at Assutm, p. 363]. These were regarded as the beginning
of the Nile, and even in later periods the Nile-god Hapi enjoyed
spevial reverence at Silsileh, where great festivals were held in his
honour,
