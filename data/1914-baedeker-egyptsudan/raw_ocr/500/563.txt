*N . M. Tomb of Amenophis II. (lighted). This tomb lies
about 200yds. to the W. of the Tomb of Ramses III. Part of its
eontents has been left on the spot (comp. p. 94). From the entrance
steep flights of steps and sloping corridors descend to a shaft (now
bridged;Pl.1),1n the depth of which is the opening to a small
chamber (P1. 2), and on to a ROOM (P1. 3) the walls and two pillars
of which are quite unadorned. From the left rear corner of this
apartment a staircase descends to a sloping corridor and to It Iloosr
(Pl. 4) borne by six pillars. At the back of this is a kind of
crypt. On the pillars
Amenophis II. is re-
presented before the
gods of the dead. The

, blue ceiling is dotted
with yellow stars. The
walls, painted yellow
(probably in imitation
of a papyrus), bear
citations and scenes .
from the 'Book of him
who is in the Under-
world'. In the crypt
stands the sandstone
*Sarcophagus of the
king (effectively shown by electric light), containing a mummy-
shaped coffin with the body of Ameuophis II., wrapped in its
shroud and still adorned with garlands. On each side of the main
room are two small chambers (PH) -8). In the first to the .right
(P1. 5) lie three mummies. The second to the right (Pl. (F, inac-
cessible) contained nine royal mummies, placed here to conceal
them from grave- robbers. Among them were the mummies of
Thutmosis I' 1.,Amenophis 111. (18th Dyn. ), Siptah, and Sethos H.
(19th Dyn. ).
