XIll.-XVI. DYNASTIES (1788-1580 B.C.).

The monarchs of the 13th Dynasty, mostly named 8tshtslr-hotep,
maintained the power of Egypt for some time, but a period of de-
cline afterwards set in. There is no period of Egyptian history at
which kings were more numerous, most of them reigning but a
short time. The South was probably ruled by the descendants of the
ancient Theban kings, while in the town of Xo'is, in the W. Delta.
another family raised themselves to power (14th Dynasty).

About this time (ca. 1680 B.C.) Egypt was conquered by a
Semitic people, known as Hyksos, Le. 'Shepherd Kings' (15th ' 16th
Dynasties), who were doubtless Syrian Bed uins. Few of their monu-
ments have been preserved; but it is evident that they conformed
to the ancient culture of Egypt. While the Hyksoa were established
in the N. part of the land, the S. was ruled by Theban princes, who
were at flrgt vassals of the foreign intruders. The tombs of these
princes, among whom were SekenyenrE III. and Kemose lay near
Drah Abu'l Negga (p. 283).

Sekenyenré ITL, whose mummy was found at Deir el-Bahri (p. 97).
Kemose. His queen was perhaps Ahhotep, whose jewels are now in
the Cairo Museum (p. 98).

5. The New Empire (1580-1090 B.C.).

Egypt became a great power during this period. At first the culture
of the New Empire differed little from that of the Middle Empire, but
under Thutmosis III. political and social life as well as the art of Egypt
underwent a radical change, owing to the new relations with W. Asia.
The tribute paid by foreign states caused an euormOus flood of wealth
to pour into Egypt, and especially into Thebes, the capital The earlier
buildings, that had fallen into disrepair, were now replaced by imposing
monuments, such as the temples at Karnak, Imxor,ete.

XVII. DYNASTY (ca. 1530-1540 B.C.).

Amosis (Ahmosc, 1580-1557 B.C.), perhaps the son of Kemose, cou-
quered Auaris, the chief fortress of the Hyksos, and expelled
the intruders from Egypt, which was reunited under one sceptre.
The Biblical story of the Exodus may possibly relate to the ex-
pulsion of the Hyksos.

Amenophis I. (Amenhoitp, 1557-ca.1540 B. 0.). This king and his
mother Nefret- ere were afterwards regarded as the patron- gods of
the Necropolis of Thebes.
