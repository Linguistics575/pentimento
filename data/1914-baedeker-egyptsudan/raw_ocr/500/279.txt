From this labyrinth of lanes we return to the Sharir e1-Khor-
dagiyeh, which is prolonged by the SMrit cl-Géhargi‘yeh. U11 the
left side of this street are the striking red and white facades of
the Mnristan Kalinin, the inedreseh of En-h%.sir, and the P,arliilliiyeh
(see below and p. 76), which oe0l1py what was once the site of a
small palace of the Fatimite sultan Mu'izz.

Opposite is the broad Shaw" Bait et-riWi, leading to the Beit
e1-1.rMi (Pl. E, 3], or ‘lionse of the Judge', originally a palace of
Emir Mamii, a general of I.orit Bey. The Open veranda, with its
tive lofty pointed arches, dates from this period. This court was
formerly the supreme tribunal of the t'ouutry, and the appointment
of cadi, made by the government at Constantinople, was frequently
bestowed 1111011 favourites, as it is a Very lucrative post. Now, how-
ever, the cmli is always an Eg gyptian and his jurisdiction is limited
to questions of civil status (birth, marriage, inheritane,0---. We
return to the main street.

The *Muristan 1ialhiin (. Pl. F, ,3) is one of three buildings be-
gun by Sultan El- ilansur ii/din' (p. cxvii) in 12 80 and iifii'siih
by his son Et1-Nis.sir in 1293 the two others being the mosque and
mausoleum mentioned below. They are the largest monuments of
their time and are of considerable architectural interest. They date
from the period during which the Arabian architecture of Egypt
began to be influemwd by the European style introduced into Syria
by the Crusaders. - The Muristhn was once a vast hospital, the
greater part of which is now in a ruinous condition and occupied
by coppersmiths and other mechanics. Part of it contains a new
ophthalmic hospital, erected by the Walif Administration(p.1xxxvi).
Originally there was a separate ward for every known disease, be-
sides leeture-roows for students and an orphanage.

The large portal is constructed of black and white marble in
alternate courses. The doors show traces of their former covering
of bronze. The adjoining corridor has a richly carved wooden ceil-
ing. [The other corridors are, vaulted in the Gothic style.] To the
left of the corridor lies the Mosque; to the right is the Mausoleum
ofNalihirr, one of the most beautiful Arab buildings in Cairo. It
has been restored by Herz-Pasha. The forecourt, the elegant facade
of which is adorned with carved stucco ornamentation, is adjoined
by the mausoleum proper. This is covered by a handsome dome,
supported by four massive granite columns and four pillars. The
exquisitely carved and coloured wooden ceiling and the prayer-
reeess, with its columns of red porphyry and its beautiful dwarf-
arcades, are noteworthy. The marble and mother-of-pearl mosaic
ornamentation of the walls and pillars is the finest of the kind in
Cairo. 111 the centre stands the sultan's catafalque. The stucco
ornamentation above the exterior of the W. exit may be noticed.
