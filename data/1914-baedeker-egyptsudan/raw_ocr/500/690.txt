30. The Rock Temples of Abu Simbel.

The two rock temples of Abu Simbel, known also as Abousambul
or Ipsambul, built by Ramses Il., are among the most stupendous
monuments of ancient Egyptian architecture and challenge com-
parison with the gigantic edifices situated in Egypt proper. Tickets
of admission (p. 200) should not be forgotten. This temple produces
a very grand effect by moonlight or at sunrise.

The WGreet Temple of Abu Simbel is entirely excavated out of
the solid rock. It was dedicated in the first place to Amon-Ré of
Thebes and Ite-Harakhte oflleliopolis, the leading deities of Egypt
proper, but Ptah of Memphis and the deifierl Ramses himself were
likewise worshipped here. Its longer axis runs almost due E. and
W., so that at sunrise the sun’s rays penetrate to the innermost sane-
tuary. Burckhardt, in 1812, was the tirst modern traveller to ex-
amine this temple. In 1900 Barsunti discovered the N. chapel in
the forecourt, freed the N. colossus from the rubbish concealing it,
and built a wall to protect the temple from the sand.

From the landing-place the temple is reached in 10 min. across
fields. We ascend a modern stairease to the ---

Forecourt in front of the temple, which is hewn out of the rock
and is enclosed on the N. and S. by ancient brick walls that have
been repaired in places. A djoining this on the W. is a Terrace (Pl. Al,
reached by a flight of steps with an inclined plane in the middle,
and at the hack of the terrace rises the fapade of the temple. To the
right and left, in front of the inclined plane, are inscriptions in
honour of Ramses Il.; that to the right CN.) represents the king burn-
ing incense before Amon, lté-llarakhte, and Thont and presenting
them with tlowers. The terrace is embellished in front with rows of
captives and a concave cornice, and is bounded by a halustrade, bear-
ing the dedicatory inscription (comp. above"). Behind the halustrade
stand figures of falcons and small statues of the king. Here our atten-
tion is attracted by the four *Cotosi ofRamscs 11.(P1.a,b,c,d), hewn
out of the cliff against which their backs are placed, and arranged
in pairs on each side of the entrance to the temple. Each of these
figures is over 65 ft. in height, i.e. larger than the Colossi of Memnon
(p. 330), but the workmanship is good and the proportions just,
while their size is in admirable keeping with the scale of the fagade
ot' the temple and the surrounding cliffs. The mild countenance
