stature of the deceased. The W.liwin(Pl.0), opposite the sanctu-
ary, had three aisles also, but the arcade next the court has collapsed.
The two sidc-liwins (P1. 10 & li) have one aisle only. Behind that
to the N. are cells for dervishes, students, and pilgrims, and a hall
(Pl. Cl; now very dilapidated), Which forms an out-building to the
mosque and connects the khinlith with the small mausoleum of Bar-
1stoli's father, Sharaf cd-Din Anas, who died in 1382. To the W. of
this hall was the old chief entrance (P1. id), adjoined by a sebil with
a medreseh or school (P1. 15). Behind the S. Itwtn is a court of
ablution (P1. 13), with a water-basin (mei4O. - One of the two
Minarcts was restored in 1900. Both had originally three stories.

To the W. (right) of this tomb-mosque, within a walled court,
is the Temb ofSuleimtin, a contemporary of the sultan of that name
(first half of the 16th cent.) This contains interesting sculpture
in the dome and inscriptions in blue fayence, now partly destroyed.
To the E. of this tomb (and to the S. ofBarlitoli's mosque) is another
handsome dome-covered tomb ('Mausolée de Ganem Bey'). On the
right of the road leading from the mosque of' Baikal; to the S.W. to
the tomb of Igéi't Bey (see below) is the Ma'bed er-Rif'tftyeh, a large
depressed dome of the Turkish period.

Opposite, to the E. (left), is the Tomb hlosque (Hash) of Bars Bey
(p. cxix), completed in 1432. It includes a mausoleum and the
ruins of a convent. Within the enclosing walls are the tombs of
some relatives of Bars Bey. The livin contains good mosaics. The
dome of the mausoleum is interesting. The remains of a sehil also
are extant. - Farther on, to the right, is the Tomb of the Mother
of Bars Bey, a small dome with pentagonal and hexagonal openings.

In the same street, a few hundred paces farther to the S., we
observe on the right the Ralf or House of J.rtr'it Bey, 260 ft. long,
completed in 1473, but now in wins. The facade is plain but the
gateway is very tasteful. A little farther to the s., in an angle,
is a Water Trough (PL15, p. lid), now in ruins, with its onee
beautiful rear wall protected by a roof. The ralr', the trough, and
the mosque (see below) all belonged to the burial-place (Hosh) of
fitrit Bey, which covered an area 330 yds. long. Its exact limits
cannot now be determined, and a number of modern buildings have
been erected within them.

The *Tomb Mosque of gait Bey (pp. 73, cxix), built in 1463
and restored in 1898, is the finest editiee among the Tombs of the
Caliphs. It is distinguished by its beautiful dome, its slender
minaret (130 ft. high), its harmonious proportions, and its hand-
some ornamentation, in which stalactites are profusely used. In
the interior we notice the beautiful marble mosaic, the tasteful ceil-
ings, the pulpit, and the lattice windows of stucco (partly modern).
Within the mausoleum (Pl. 8, p. 114) are shown a finely carved
desk and two stones, which are said to have been brought from
Mecca by IiifitBey and to bear impressions of the feet of the prophet
