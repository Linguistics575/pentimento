Information. UPPER EGYPT. 201

An easier plan is as follows. Quitting Cairo by the night-express
we reach Bulimia (p. 221) next morning, and ride thence on
donkey-back to Abydos (p. 237). Provisions for this expedition
must be brought from Cairo. We have snffieient time to explore
the ruins at Abydos before catching the evening-train for Luror
(p.251). At least four days should be devoted to an inspection
of the temples and tombs at Thebes. On leaving Luxor we may
either stop over a train at Ed/â€˜u (p. 343; which, however, may be
just as well visited on the way back) or proceed straight through
to As3utht (p. 353), where not less than two days should be spent.
If possible, one should devote a day to an excursion to Kihn Ombo
(p. 349). We leave Luxor on our return by the first morning-train
and break the journey at Ifmeh (y. 222), whence we ride to the
temple of Dendcra (p. 244). Provisions must be brought from Luxor
for this expedition. From Iieneh we go on to Cairo by the north
express. We may visit Dendera also as a day's excursion from Luxor
and take Abydos instead on the return-journey (comp. below).

A TOUR OF THREE WEEKS may be arranged somewhat as follows.
We proceed by railway to Luxor and spend a week there, one day
of which may be devoted to an excursion to Dendera (by train to
Keneh and back). From Luxor we go on by steamer (2 days) or by
railway (1 day) to Assufin, where we spend 5 days, including one
Jay's excursion to Rtsm Ombo. We may then return by steamer to
Cairo, or we may take the steamer to Luxor, make another short
stay there, and go on by train in the morning to Baliana (visit to
the ruins of Abydos) and take the evening-train thence to Cairo.

The railway may be utilized for other excursions by travellers who
are to some extent familiar with the customs and language of the country.
The nights may he spent in the station waiting-rooms (with permission
of the station-master) or at the houses of the local headmen ('Omdeh).

Warm rugs and provisions (preserved meats, tea, mineral waters) must
he brought from Cairo.

Steamboats. The steamboat service to Upper Egypt is main-
tained by two companies: Messrs. Thomas Cook ' Son, the more im-.
portant, and the Hamburg f Anglo-American Nile Co. - Passengers
by steamer who sleep with the cabin-window open should take care
to have suffleient bedclothes; and it is well to remember (6.9. when
shaving) that the steamers sometimes run aground, especially above
Luxor. Delay through this last fact occasionally necessitates the
completion of the Journey to Cairo hy railway in order to make
connection with the tyet-steamer-s.

The best boats of THOMAS Coos & Sos are the 'tourist-steamers'
Arabia (80 berths), Egypt (80 berths), Rameses the Great (80 berths),
Rameses (79 berths), and Ramescs III. (70 berths), after which
rank the Amasis (44 berths) and the Tetclik (40 berths). One of
the above steamers starts once a week during the season, spending
20 days on the voyage to Assuan and back. The fare is 521.; for
occupants of the few superior cabins in the stern, specially adapted
