with its tasteful cciling-patterns and some excellent mural paint-
ings. Among the latter is a representation of the deceased, who
was a baker, receiving some loaves, and another of a barber's shop.

Beside No. 56 lies the Tomb of Kha-em-hét (No. 57), super-
intendent of the royal granaries under Amenophis 111. It contains
admirable low reliefs. To the left in the doorway is Kha-em-hét
with uplifted hands offering a prayer to the sun-god. In the niche
to the left in the first, wide Chamber are two mutilated statues
of Kha-enl-hét and his relative Imhotep, a royal scribe, who was
interred in an adjoining but now inaccessible tomb. On the wall to
the right of the entrance is the deceased offering two vessels with
two geese in each; to the left of this relief two upper rows depict
the surveying of the fields; below are cheerful harvest-scenes. On
the rear wall to the left Kha-em-hét presents a report on the harvest
to King Amenophis 111.,who is sitting beneath a canopy (iigures much
mutilated). The nine captive tribes at the foot of the canopy should
be noticed. On the right is a similar scene with the king seated
upon a magnilicent throne on which he is represented in the guise
of a Sphinx. Behind Eha-ern-hrit are three rows of his officials in
humble attitudes. The chess-board decoration of the ceiling is
peculiar. - The texts and scenes in the Corridor relate to the life
beyond the tomb. The Side Chambers and the Recess at the end of
the corridor contain large seated statues, very highly polished.
Adjoining the recess opens a small unadorued chamber.

Hard by on the S. is the Tomb of Thuti (No. M), a steward in the
service of a high-priest of Amon. This was afterwards usurped by a cer-
tain Thuti-em-heh, who added his inscriptions on a yellow ground. The
tomb contains fine coloured representations, showing the deceased at

table, while on the rear wall is a. banquet at which the guests are served
by female slaves.

8. Deir eI-Medineh.
Kurnet Murrai. Tombs of the Queens.

No one, should miss seeing the beautiful small Ptolemaic temple of
pair el-3fediurh. The Tomb of' Huye at JitTaet Murrai‘ (p. 318) should be
visited only by those who have plenty of time. The interesting Tombs of
the Queens (p. 319], for which at least t1/4 hr. must be allowed, are pic-
turesquely “situated but lie somewhat out of the way for the traveller
whose time is limited. We may, however, go On to visit them from Me-
dinet Habu (p. 322) and take Deir el-Medineh in returning.

About 1/2 M. to the S.W. of Sheikh 'Abd el-liurna, on'the way
either to Medinet IIabu (p. 322) or to the Tombs of the Queens
(p. 319), is the graceful little -

"Temple of Deir el-Medineh, begun by Ptolemy IV. Philo-
pator and completed by Philometor and Euergetes 11., and princi-
pally dedicated to IIathor, goddess of the necropolis, and to Meat.
It lies in a barren hollow and is surrounded by a lofty wall of dried
bricks which are fitted together in waving lines. Through this a
Doorway of stone (on the SE.) leads into the temple-precincts, at
the hack of which LN.) are steep rocks. The traveller on passing
