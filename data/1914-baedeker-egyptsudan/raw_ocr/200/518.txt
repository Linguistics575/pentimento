hieratic inscriptions, besides rrspresentMions of fob-prints, placed here
by pilgrims to the temple.

Adjoining the temple of lihuns on the S.W. is a Temple of
Epet, the hippopotamus-goddess, erected by Euergetes IL; the
building stands upon a basis about 10 ft, in height, crowned with
a concave curnice. The keeper of the temple of Khons will open it
on request. The main entrance is on the W. side; on the jamhs
appears the king before Osiris and other deities. m, enter thst a
Rectangular Hall, with a â€œell-preserved ceiling resting upon two
columns, with Calyx-capitals and heads of Hathor above them. The
grated windows at the top of the S. wail should he noted. To the
right lie three side-rooms with crypts; the door on the left is built
up - We proceed through the central door into a Second Hall,
tianked by two side-rooms, of which that to the left contains a re-
presentation of the dead Osiris upon the bier. We then pass through '
a door, on the rightjamh of which appears the goddess Epet, and _
enter the Sanctuary, where a flgure of the goddess stood in a niche.
The reliefs show us the king (usually Euergetes II.) before the gods.
- In the E. wall of the temple is a Chapel of Osiris (separate
entrance on the E. side), constructed by Ptolemy RHI., to which
belongs the shaft issuing from the sanctuary ofthe Temple of Epet,
in which perhaps a relic of Osiris was buried.

From the Temple of Khan: we proceed in the direction of the
Nile and soon reach the first pylon of the great temple of Amen.
To the W. of this is the house of the director of the excavations
(ILL Georges Legrain). Direct route from Luxor, see p. 262. Donkeys
And carriages must be left at the door to the W. ofthe seventh pylon
(p.279). The rectangular terrace in front of the first pylon was even
in antiquity covered by the waters of the inundation, as is indicated
by marks on its front, recording the height of the inundatieus under
the 21st-26th dynasties. 0n the terrace rises a small Obelisk of Se-
thos 11., beside which is the base of its companion. Au avenue of
recumbent rams, erected by Ramses 11., extended from this point
to the portal of the temple of Amen. The fragments of building
to the SW. of the right py1on-tower belong to at Chapel, erected
about 390 3.0. by King Achoris and his successor Psemuthis. In
the interior Psamuthis appears on the right and left walls, offer-
Eng incense to the boat of Amon.

+ The Great Temple of Anion, like the temples ou the left hank
