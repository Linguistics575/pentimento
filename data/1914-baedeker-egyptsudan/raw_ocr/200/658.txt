M. The Western Oases.

By the term OASIS (Egypt. wet, Arab. er1n01.O is generally
understood a fertile and inhabited spot in the midst of the desert.
More correctly. however, the cases are large depressions in the de-
sert-platean, of which a comparatively very small area is really fer-
tile, by far the largerportion heingdesert, The fertility of the oases
depends upon the existence of a water-supply lying in a stratum of
sandstone, from 300 to 550 ft. below the surface7 and rendered avail-
able either by natural springs .ur by Jeep artesian wells, Fertile
land, therefore, is usually found in the lowest parts of‘ an oasis.

The five Egyptian oases1 situated in the Libyan Desert (comp.
p.1xx), have an aggregate population of 38,000. KMrgek is connected
with the Nile valley by railway, and is therefore easily visited; the
others (Shwah, llahrfyelt, Faro/ra, and flii/chle/O are reached by earnel-
caravans (romp, p, xxv).

Siweh.

The OAsts op Siwnu (Slum), theAmmonz‘mn or seat of the oracle
of Jupiter Ammon, is the most westerly of the oases and lies 15-20
days' journey from the Nilevalley. The best starting-points for a visit
to this spot are Cairo and Alexandria, where also the caravan can
he organized. The mute from Cairo leads via Aim R0057: (p. 1'rl0) tn
the Convent of St. Macarius (Deir Abu M'al.tctr, p. 32) in the Widi

Thence 3 days' march brings us to Siweh. H From Alexandria we
may follow the I1atariytr-route to the S.W. vii the City of St. Menus
(p. 28) to join the Cairo route at Mngham (see above). Or we may
send the camels on to Ed-0aba' (p.29), join them there by means,
of the Maryl'tt railuay (p. 27), and go on to the seaport of Miran

Sikket es-Sultan ('snltnn road') or Sikket Igtahl ('stable road'), the
route followed by Alexander the Great (p.29), leads to Siweh in
7 days, vii the Midi Ruml and Ilir Gauifen' and thence through the
Pass of Kanais and past several wells to the fhis et-Warnrayed.

this oasis was Browne fp. 126) in 1792, who may thus rank as the
rediscoverer of the Ammonium. The inhabitants (3884 in number)
are chiefly Berbers and, like the Berbers of North Africa, have a
language of their own, though the men speak and understand Arabic
also. Besides a number of smaller settlements there are two large
