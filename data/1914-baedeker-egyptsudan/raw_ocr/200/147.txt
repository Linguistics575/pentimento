the same 11ay a sycamore tree â€œas believed to be the abode of the
goddess llutlmr, who belonged to the district to the S. ofMemphis.
while the god Nefertem was worshipped in the form of a lotus flower,
and the goddess Neith, of Sais, as a bundle of arrows. But the belief
that gods chose animals as their abode and revealed themselves in
the form of animals was much more generally spread; cows, bulls,
rams, goats, crocodiles, cats, lions, iehneumons, frogs, certain kinds
of fishes, ibises, falcons. vulturcswere all believed to be thus chosen
by one or other god. Thus the god Klmurn was represented as a ram,
Horus as a falcon, Thou! as an ibis, Sobel: as a crocodile, the goddess
chhbeyzt as a vulture, the goddess of llubastis as a cat, Hathor of
Dcndera as a tow, the local goddess ofAthrihis as a serpent, and so on.

Besides the local deities who were worshipped in the form of
animals there were special sacred animals, distinguished by certain
markings, which were worshipped from a very early period. These
were kept in the temple, and after their death they were interred
with all honour, while their place in the temple was taken by another.
The best known example " this worship is afforded by the Apis,
the sacred bull, worshipped at Memphis It was black with white
spots; on the forehead it bore a white triangle and on the right flaItk
a crescent. Similarly a JigU-eoloured bull (Mneuis) was worshipped
at llcliopolis, at llermmrthis the bull Buchis was sacred, as was the
heron Phoenix at II0liopolis, These sacred animals wore connected
with the local deities; the Apis was thus considered to be the 'lie
ing replica of Ptah', the Pltwnis the 'soul of the sun-god'. At a
later period, the worship of sacred animals was carried further. Not
only were these individual 'saered' animals revered as holy, but
also all the animals in which the local deities inbered. One or more
of these animals was preserved in the temple, and all others of the
same kind, none of which might be killed within the region sacred to
them, were solemnly interred in special cemeteries when they died.
The eat-e-tttries of Bnbastis and Benil.1asan, the erocodile-graves
0f Ombos, the ibis-gravcs of Ashrmmein, eta, date from this late
epoch of exaggerated triritnal-worship. It was probably only this
excessive expansion of animal-worship that struck the Greeks in
Egypt as remarkable. For traces of a similar worship were common
to various oriental peoples, and even amang the Greeks and Romans
themselves certain animals were regarded as sacred to the gods, as,
9.9., the lions of Cyhele, the owl of Athena, and the eagle of lens.

A stage beyond fetishism was reached when theEgyptians, in the
hegilming ofthe historical period, began to formauanthropomorphic
conception of their deities. The gods had human faces and forms
and Wore clothing such as the Egyptians themselves wore. Like
princes, they wore on their heads helmets or crowns, and, like the
primmval rulers, they had tails fastened to the hack of their aprons
They bore the sceptre or the commanders baton as the symbol
of their might. The deities that were conceived of as animals now
