Amuin or Aswan Cur. Syene, Gopt. Swan), with 12,618 inhah.,
lies on the E. bank, partly on the plain and partly on a hill, in N.
lat. 2io N. The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports numerous
date-palms, the fruit of which enjoys a high reputation. This town
is the capital of the province ofttssuin, the southernmost of Upper
Egypt, which has an area of 168 sq. M.aiu1a population of 232,813
and extends to the S. from Esneh to the boundary of the Anglo-
Egyptian Sthiin. It is the seat of the provincial authorities. The
once considerable trade in the products of the Sildin and Abyssinia
has greatly fallen oif since the Mahdist revolt, but on the other
hand the export trade in sennh (folia Senna; eemp. p. 356) has
greatly increased. The Nile here divides into several arms, "e-
rated by granite rocks and islands, the largest of which is Elepham
tine (p. 357). The horizon on the W. is bounded by the Libyan
hills, on the E. by the Arabian mountains. On account Mits charm-

Hts’mnv. The district around the modern Assuén, including the island
of Elephantine, bore in antiquity the name of mm, or 'Elephant Laad',

a ieter date that name Was restricted to the island and town of Elephant-
ine. From the erection of the Pyramids t0 the Roman period the ancient
Egyptians tunud material [or their: great temples and statues in the quar-
ries Df Yehu (Syeue), which yielded tine coloured granite, containing a
large proportion of translucent. quarts and of yellow, brownish, pink, and
black mica. Curiously enough, however, the term 'syestite', which was
used by Pliny, is now applied by geologists to a different variety of stone,
containing a much larger propm‘tinn or hornblende. Strategically, Yibu
commanded the Nile cataracts and the waterways between Egypt and Nubia.
It was also the starting-point of the great caravan-routes leading to Nubia
and the Slidfin, along which passed the earliest commercial and military
nxpeditinns of the Egyptianst The ancient capital of the province was
likewise named YEba and lay on the s. side of the island (p. 358). The tysis-
teuee here of a Jewish military colony, with a temple etJehoveh, in the
6th and 5th cent. BA). has been proved by the discovery of a large mime
bra, of Aramaic papyri in 19066 (now mostly in Berlin).

Another town, named Swinet, the Syenc 0f the Greeks, was situated on
the E. bank of the Nile, hat appears not to have attained any great im-
portanee until a late period. Juvemzl, the Latin satiric poet, who lived
