community of monks established themselves in the temple and
founded a convent, known to the Arabs as Deir et-Bayri, or the
'Northern Conventâ€™. The chambers of the temple were converted into
chapels and the 'heathen' representations on the walls were barbar-
ously defaced. - Mariette made a few excavations here, but iUally
in 1894-96 the entire temple Was exhumed " the cost of the Egypt
Exploration Fund under the skilfal directions ofM. Eduard Neville.

The temple was dedicated to Amen; but the goddess Hathor
and Anubis, god of the dead, also had chapels here, and several
chambers were devoted to the worship of the queen, who was buried
at Bibin el-aArulttk (p. 290), and to that of het parents. The build-
ing occupies three terraces, rieiag one above the other from the
level ground 5 these are connected with each other by inclined planes,
Which divide the whole into a N. half, to the right, and a S. half,
to the left. At the W. side of each terrace is a raised colonnade. The
stages were cut out of the E. slope of the mountain, and support was
given to the outer and inner walls by means of blocks of the tinisst
sandstone. The chambers devoted to religious rites were likewise
cut out of the rock.

An Avenue afSphinxes led from the plain to the temple, ending
at the gateway (now almost totally destroyed] forming the entrance
to the temple-precincts. In front of the gate, in square enclosures
of masonry, stood two persea trees (Mimusops Sehimperi), the stumps
of which are still extant.

We first enter the Lower Terrace. This is in a very dilapidated
condition, though it has lately been restored. Each Commune coll-
sisted or22 columns arranged in a double row. The columns in
the bath row were sixteen-sided, while the others were four-
sided in front and seven-sided behind. Little now remains of
the reliefs and inscriptions that once adorned the walls.

On the rear wall of the N. Colonnade, at Pl. a, are traces of the pe-
presentation of a pond, on which water-fowl are being caught with nets.

Below the S. colonnade are holes hewn in the rock, which were
formerly filled with Nile mud and used for plants. Remains of palms,
vines, and the like are still extant,

We now ascend the approach to the Centre! Terrace, on the S.
side of which we can best observe the careful workmanship of the
