242 1mm w. Aumos. Temple ofb'etltas I.

On the left wall of the corridor we again meet Sethos and the
youthful llumses. The father holds a ncuser in his left hand, while
the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skirt, pours a Iihation on
the altar in front of him. The inscription contains a long list of
the names and shrines of gods whom Sethes :tnd his eon are here
honouring with saeriti0ial gifts.

In the centre of the right wall a door leads into a I’Assmn,
beyond which is :L Vaulted stone staircase, which led out of the
euiple but was built up in ancient times.

The Relief: in the passage date from Ramses IL 011 the right wall the
king and it prince appear laxsning a bull in presence of the w0lf-iuurde6 god I
Wep-wawet. Farther to the left this animal is being sacrificed tn the _
end Wup-wawet. Un the left wall Itamses conducls fuur sacred oxen tn
Khans and King Sethos; farther m theleit Ramses paces out the precincts .
of the temple (comp, p. 306); names and four gods are netting birds; ,
Ramses Mid .1 prince met- the ritptlired geese to Amon and Nut. F

Annlher door (now huilt up) in the right wall of the Kings' Gallery led
to the Harm up Tm; Bsass, it small chamber (now inaccessible) snplmrtcd
by six eulumm and adorned partly with paintings by Sethns L, partly with
reliefs 'en ei'eux‘ by “ill e511. Thu benches by the walls were probably I
intended for the sacri mail gifts.

The other rooms of this S. Wing are all more or less in ruins,
From the s. end of the kings' Gallery, where Coptic prayers have
been written up in red, we enter the SLAUGHTER COURT, surrounded
with seven columns, which was never completed. The sculptures
and hieroglyphics were skctrhctl in colour under Sethos, and only a
few or them wore afterwards finished as reliefs 'en "reux'. They
represent Sethos saerifie'rng_ The scenes in the lower row depict the
slaughter and cutting up of saerifieial animals. The screen between
the first column and the left wall was intended to veil the prooeed-
ings in the court from the kings' Gallery.

Adjoining this court are four unfinished mums TI. A, B, (I, D) In
the tint three the designs on the walls aremerely sketched in; in D they
have heen completed in colour. r Of Rooms EH, which lie one story
higher, II anti] are billed with rubbish, E-G contain uruinished represent-
ations dating from the reign of Ameaeplsthes. - Beyond Room D, outside
the temple proper, lies a deep eircular well.

 

 

Returning now to the second hypostyle hall, we may pay :t brief
visit to the CuAMnEn which adjoins it on the left and was dedicated
to J’tah-Soker, god of the dead at Memphis. The roof is supported
by three lree-trunk columns (p. '23N. The fine reliefs show Sethos
revoring Soker, Nefertem, and other gods.

Opeuing " this chamber are two small vaulted chapels; that to the
right dedicated to Soker, that to the left to Neferiem. On the left wall
of the former is a relief of Home and Isis by the bier of Osiris, on whose
mummy sits a falcon (leis); at the head and feet of the mummy are two
nther falcons, with drooping witrgs. On the rightwallare Isis and Horus
by the bier rr? Snker»05iris, Whose left hand is raised to his brow.

About 40 yds. to the W of the temple of Sethas and in thesame axis,
lies a building constructed by Amenephthes in an L'ii'iis'ii mound. The
main chamber adorned with religious scenes This has been taken for
n Shrine of on I (Osireitm), but is more probably tl eenotaph of Sethns I.
Ecxevntiuns were begun here in 1811 by the Egypt 1u'sp1curution Fund.
