'lord of both lands (p. mix), or v f?, neb haw, 'lord of the

diaderus'. The title I-ip s' 12' (se' RE’), 'son of the sun’, is an ad-
dition to the individual or birth name. Thutmosis 111., for ex-

The former is his official nameya assumed at his accession to the
throne, the latter his individual name. CD is the original word-sign
(No.1) r', 'sun, sun-god Ile'; eee is the syllahic sign (No. 1) mn,

here, however, standing for'to remain'; is the transferred word-

sign (No. 22) tpr, 'to become, to be'. The first name therefore is
h'umn-lrpr, or, rather, as the words signifying god or king are written
lirst out of reverence merely, mnorr-R', 'remains the being of RP.'

original word-sign (No. 10] .27.rwty, 'the ibis-god Tbout'; a and

NN are the letters t and y, indicating the final syllable of Timmy;

m is the syllahic sign (No.5) ms'; and H the letter i added to show

the sound of mi. The whole is thus T.hurtv-rns' (Le. 'the god Thout

It may here he remarked that the Egyptian names occurring in
the Handbook are usually written in the traditional Creek form
and not in the native Egyptian; e.g. Sethos instead of Sthy, thops
(Cheaper) instead of ij/‘w (Khwfw or Khufu). For names, however,
of which the Egyptian forms are more familiar, or of which there
are no known Greek transliterations, the Egyptian forms have been
retained, with vowels inserted on the principles explained above.
In these cases, however, the diacritical signs are omitted, so that no
difference is made between t and t, T. and g, k and .k, h and h; w is
sometimes represented by u; y by i h and L: by (ch; s'hy 5; and in
uertain eases y is altogether omitted. The apostrophes , aud ' are
uniformly omitted. In short, the general rules adopted by the
Greeks for the transliteration of Egyptian words are followed.
