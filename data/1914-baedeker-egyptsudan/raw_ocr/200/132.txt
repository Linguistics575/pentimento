Repeated attempts were made in the 17th and 18th centuries
to decipher the peculiar pieture-writ'mg, of the ancient Egyptians,
the Jesuit father Athanasius kireher (1601-80) being among the
earliest to take up the subject. It was not, however, until the be-
ginning of thea19th century that the key was found, though Sacy,
a Frenchman, Akerhlad, a Swede, and Thomas Young, the English
physicist (1773-1829), had previously attained a certain amount
of success in their tyMrts. Francois Champqlliou, a Frenchman,
succeeded in 1822 in discovering the Iong-sought alphabet from a
varet‘ul comparison of royal cartouches, and so found the clue to the
principles of the Egyptian style ofwriting. Champollion afterwards
followed up his initial discovery with such success that he may fairly
rank as the real interpreter of the Egyptian hieroglyphirs.

The [irst clue was aCorded by the tammn ‘Rusetla same: (now in the
Bxitish Museum), discovered in 1799 in the Fort St. Julian at Resettzup. 31),
This tablet of basalt bears threeinscriptions; one in the ancient Egyptian
language, written in t1iertsgtyplsitss, one in the popular language of a
later period, inscribed in demt ie characters, and a third in Greek; bat
the two last are merely translations of the tirst. The subject of the triple
inscription is a decree of the Egyptian priests issued in 196 B.0. in honour
of Ptolemy v. Epipbanes. The that step towards deciphering the hiem~
glyphies was made when it was ascertained that the frequently occurring
groups of signs each enelused in " osraJCso-etruedortouehe; comp. p. exxx)
were the names of kings and that the name of Ptolemy must be found
among them.

Champollinn and his successors established the phonetic signi-
iieation " a large numher ot'hiercglyphic characters, and it then be-
came possible, from a knowledge of Coptir, the latest t'orm of the
ancient Egyptian language, not only to read but also to interpret
the inscriptions. II. Brugsch, who led the way to the complete
interpretation of demotic texts, was also the f1rst to point out that
in hieroglyphic writing, as in the Semitic systems of writing, only
the ecusonants were inscribed, while the vowels were omitted as
not essential.

The Egyptian hieroglyphics form a system of picture-writing,
in which concrete objects were originally expressed by pictures IB-
presenting them (Le. by so-eailed ideagmphs); e.il.

'Face' (1r Q 'Eo yr! <9.
'Moou' vrl.r A ‘Sun’ r' O
'Pigeon' wr ' 'Plough' M' M

Abstract ideas and verbs were represented on the same principle
by the use of pictures of objects suggesting in some sort the idea
to be expressed. Thus the idea 'to rate' ly.t' was expressed by the

 

picture of a sceptre’r, 'Upper Egypt' Jrnr by a lily ' its botanical

emblem, 'to urito' all, hy a writing apparatus " etc.
