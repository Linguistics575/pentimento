From the Birth Room we enter Room o, the roof of which is
supported by three columns, and thence, after glancing at the much
damaged reliefs, we pass through an arched doorway, of later in-
sertion, into the so-called -

Sanctuary of Alexander the Great (Pl. G). This chamber was
practically rebuilt in the reign of Alexander. The original four
supporting columns in the centre were replaced by a chapel (open
both front and rear), in which the sacred boat of Amen was pre-
served. The reliefs covering both the interior and exterior walls of
the chapel represent Alexander before Amon and his fellow-gods;
those on the walls of the chamber still show Amenophis 111. before
the Thehan deities. -- A gap in the wall on the N. side of the saue-
tuary admits us to a small square Hall (PI. F), with four clustered
papyrus-columns. The wall-reliefs, which are in four rows, show
Amenophis III. before Amon and other Theban deities. The ori-
ginal door hence to the sanctuary has been built up.

The Renrmont Rooms of the temple are of comparatively little "
terest. From the Sanctuary of Alexander we pass through Raum s (with
12 columns) into the Sanctuary (PI. N), the ceiling or which was borne by
four clustered papyrus-culumns. A relief to the left of the entrance shows
Alum and Horus conducting the king into the sanctuary. The other reliefs
represent the king in presence of Anton. -The sssultRapm F, which was
probably a store~room for sruriMial gifts, is now aucessihle only from
without the temple.

We now proceed to inspect the I’yltm (p. 258). On the war thither
the traveller should not omit to cast a glance on the exterinr w. nails
" the Court and Colonnade of Amenophie m. and the Court of Ramses ll.
(PI. b, c, d). These walls were embellished by Ramses 11. with reliefs
of scenes from his Asiatic campaigns.

A paved street, flanked on both sides with figures of recumbent
rams, each with a small image of Amenophis 111. in front ofit,1ed
to the N. from this temple to the temples of Karnak. The avenue of
sphiuses beside the temple of Khons at Karnak (p.202) is a mo-
mutt of this street.
