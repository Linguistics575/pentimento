DAM 0F ASSUAN. N. Rome. 371

Blggeh Was the site also 0f the famous sanctumy of Abaton, "ith a
tomb of Osiris (comp. p. cxliv]. Active travellers are recommended
to climb to the top of one of the rocks ofBiggeh, for the sake of the
remarkable xiew ever the whole cataract district.

The rocky islets " the N. end of Philm, now called Konosso
('great roirk'), were formerly the 8. limit of Egypt (see p. 380).
They are now generally submerged. The islets contain numerous
rock-iuscriptiuns, among which the cartuuches of Psammeticlms ll.
are conspicuous on a massive double rack.

The Nile Dam at Assuén.

Those who wish to visit the Dam only my go by the shorter route
described at p. 363, and return by the rather longer route alongthe bank.

The 'i'Dam ofAssurln (Barrage, Arab. Es-8add, Le. 'the Darn', 01'
El- Khazdn, Le. 'the Reservoir'), built in 1898-1902 below Phllm, is
the largest structure of the kind in the world and ranks among the
most wonderful sights of Egypt. It was cunstrncted in order to dam
up the water of the Nile so that a regular supply cenld he furnished
during time of low water. By this means the country can be regularly
irrigated all the year round, and many irrigation canals that used
formerly to run dry periudically now receive a constant supply ot'
water. l'pwards of 500,000 acres were added in 190210 the area of
land cultivable in summer, and it is estimated that this increased the
national wealth by 15,000,000l. The dam is built of granite blocks
brought from the old quarries at Assuén o. 3561 and runs straight
across the river-channel for a distance of 2150 yds. (11/4 M.). The
original height of the darn was 130 ft. above the foundation, while
its thickness varied from 23 ft. at the top to 98 ft, at the bottom.
Iui907-12,however,itwas raised about 161/211. higher and its thick-
ness increased by about as much; so that the storage-lake farmed
above the dam has now a capacity of '2,é20,000,000 cubic metres
(instead of 980,000,000), a depth, when full, of 88 ft. (instead
of 65 ft.), and an extent upstream of 185 M. (instead of 140 M.)
The masunry is yenetratenl by 180 sluice gates for regulating the
flaw of the water. Theseiuclmle 14010wer sluices {each measuring
23 M 01/2 ft.) for the distribution of the water and 40 upper sluices
(each 01/2 M 11 ft.) to permit the escape of surplus water. The iron
gates of the sluices (‘Stoney patent') are regulated by the help ot'
electrical winches standing on the top of the dam. When the Nile
commences to rise at tho beginning ofJnly all the slnices are opened.
After the end of November, when practically all the suspended
mud has passed through and the water has become comparatively
clear, the gates are gradually closed, one after the other in regular
order. Tho lake above the dam is thus formed and becomes quite
full about Feb. let. When the want of water in Egypt begins to be
noticeable (about the end of March) the quantity required for culti-
