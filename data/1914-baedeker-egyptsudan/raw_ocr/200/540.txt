Between Pylons IX and X lies a square court, surrounded by a
wall, which is interrupted on the left CE.) side by the ruins ofa
small TEMPLE OP AMENDPHIS II.

In front of the temple is a Sallery, home by It square pillars embel-
lisherl with reliefs. Thence e granite portal admits us to elerge Hall, the
met at which rested on 16 square palms with concave carnicee at the top.
011 the fom' sides or each pillar appears Amenophis II. before some deit .
This hall is ilanked by smaller chambers, two of Which have pillt 5
like those of the main hall. Most of the smliptures on the walls and
pillars are executed in line tnw relief, only a few being in sunk relief.
Much of the colouring is in good preservation.

On the E. Wall of the court are several important reliefs of
Haremheb. At Pl. d the king conducts to the Theban triad captives
with costly gifts from the incense-yielding land of Punt, while at
Pl. e he appears with fettered Syrian captives.

0n the ontside or the Wail, behind PL e, is :t procession of priests
carrying the sacred boatst Beside it is an inscription of the time of the
high~prieet Pinotem IL, recording the appointment of a priest in deference
to MI creole of Amun.

The reliefs on the W. Wall of the court, whieh also date from
llaremheh, are in poor preservation.

Pylon X, which formed the S. entrance to the precincts of the
great temple of Amen from the end of the 18th Dynasty onwards,
was likewise built by Haremheh, who used the stones of a temple
raised by Amenophis IV. in Karnak to bis new deity (p. 211). The
reliefs on the central granite doorway exhibit liai-emheh satsritiising
and performing other religious Tittys.- In front ofthe N. side of the
pylon stand two headless statues of Ramses IL, of ilne-grained lime-
stone (that to the W. edjoined by a figure of his wife]. Here is
also a large stele with a manifesto of Haremheh, intended to restore
order to the distracted state. In front of the S. side of the pylon
are the remains of colossal statues of Amenophis III. CE.) and
Haremheh (W.) and the lower part of a colossus of Osiris.

From Pylon X the EastAvenue of8phinxes, erected byUaremheb,
leads to a Rate in the girdle-wall of the South Temple Precincts,
built by Ptolemy II. Philadelphns and embellished with reliefs and
long inscriptions. On the E. side of this road is at Chapel of Osiris-
Ptah (closed), with well-preserved painted reliefs; the chapel was
built by the Ethiopian Kings Tanutemun and Taharka (95th Dyn.).
From the gate we proceed amidst figures of recumbent rams,
sphinxes, and fragments of statues to the -

TEMPLE or MDT, built by Amenophis III.

A Gateway (PL A) admits us to a huge Court, in the middle of which
Wins th ooiohhede, Outside the gateway are pillars with figures of the god
Bes. On the gateway ere lengthy inscriptions of the Ptalemnic period
(hymns to Mat) and an inscription of Ramses UL, who restored the tempie.
The court contains numerous seated tigarws of the lion-heeded goddess
Sekhmet, dedicated by Amenophis m. On several of these Shoehenk I.
