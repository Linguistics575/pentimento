Tomb of Numtm. PYRAMIDS OI? Gizmr. th Route. 139

inspect the Tombs ofthe Ancient Empire, hollowed out in the rocky
slope. Several of these are nou used as d srellings or stables. The
best known is the Tomh of Numbers (Pl. n), which belonged to a
eertain Khefrronekh, a courtier of Klurphren. 0n the left part of the
entranee-wall appear the deceased and his hrother, accompanied by
a dog, inseecting the cattle that are driven before them by peasants.
The peasants are arranged in several rows, headed by one hearing
the sunshade of his master. Scribes are engaged in recording the.
number of cattle of earh kind, the numbers being placed above
the herds (whence the name of the tomb). Thus we are informed
that Khefrri-onekh had 853 oxen, 220 cows and calves, 2235 goats,
760 asses, and 974 raws. 0n the 1eft(S.) wall are the deceased
and his wife at table. On the teat (W.) wtll are five door-shaped
steles with a statue of the deceased, to the left. The mural reliefs,
which are in poor preservation, are in the clumsy and undeveloped
style of the 4th Dynasty. - On the S. horizon, ca. 6 M. distant, rise
the pyramids orhburir(p. Ili) and the step-pyramid of Sakh'rn
p.146 .

( Au)cxpedition across the desert to the Western Petrifed ("crest
(hmm el-Khashab) is attractive (guide necessary) To the N. of the
Main House Hotel we strike off to the W. and after a ride of 3 hrs.
across a sandy valley reach the beginning of the petrified forest,
which extends as far as the Wadi Nar.rr'ln tp. 32). The specimens
of petrified trees here are much liner than those in the petrified
forest in the Arabian Desert (pp. 118. tio).

 

THE Excunsxox TO THE Pymmms OF A1317 Roisrr, which lie 5 M.
to the N. of the Pyramids of Gizeh, takes about halr-a-day and is
most conveniently made from the Mena House Hotel, where donkeys,
camels, or olesert-earriages may be obtained. - The route leads
through the desert, skirting the mlgn cf the cultivated laud. lttheu
hem]: tn the E. through fields and reaches f% hr.) the village "
Kerdriseh, which is prettily situated amid palm-groves and is itself
a suNeient attraction for an excursion, especially on Mom, which
is the hscekly market-day. We then proreod through paIm-groves
to (1 hr.) the village of Abu Rotssh, with the tomb of the saint of
that name. Here we again turn to the w. across the desert and
asecnd by the ancient approach from the b'JC, of which about 1 M.
is still preserved, to the (U2 hr.) abrupt rocky plateau. On this
plateau stands the large Pyramid ofAbu Roish, known hy the natives
" El<ltua, the tomb of the king Teti-ré (4th Dyu.) The pyr-
amid itself has almost entirely disappeared, hut we can look down
into the hollow hewn in the rock which contains the seyulchral
chamber. and on the passage descending to it. The remains of brick
buildings to the F.. of the pyramid belong to the mortuary temple.
Adjacent is the house of the French Areha'ologieal Institute. _ A
