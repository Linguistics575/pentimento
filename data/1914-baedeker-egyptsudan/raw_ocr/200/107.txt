XIIL-XVI. DYNASTIES (”83.1580 3.0.).

The monarchs of the 13th Dynasty, mostly named Sebek-hotep,
maintained the power of Egypt for some time, but a period of de-
cline afterwards set in. There is no period of Egyptian history at
which kings were more numerous, most of them reigning but a
short time. The South was probably ruled by the desrendants oithe
ancient Theban kings, while in the town of htiis, in the W, Delta.
another family raised themselves to power (14th Dynasty).

About this time (ch. 1680 13.0.) Egypt Was conquered by a
Semitic people, known as Hyksos, Le. Shepherd Kings' (llitli ' Mth
Dynasties), who were doubtless Syrian Beduins. Few of their monu-
ments have been preserved; but it is evident that they conformed
to the ancient culture of Egypt. While the Hyksoa were established
in the N. part of the land, the S, Was ruled by Theban princes, who
were at tlrst vassals of the foreign intruders. The tombs of these
princes, among whom were Sekenyenre Ill, and Kemose, lay near

5. The New Empire (1580-1090 HA).).

Egypt became a great power during this period. At iirst the culture
at the New Empire differed little from that of the Middle Empire. but
under Thutmosis III. political and social life aa well as the art of Egypt
underwent a radical change, owing to the new relations with W. Asia.
The tribute paid by foreign states caused nu enormous flood of wealth
to pour into Egypt, and especillly into Thebes, the capital. The earlier
buildings, that had Fallen into disrepair, were huw replaced by imposing
monument: such as the temples at Khmhh Luxor, ete,

Amosis (Almost, 1580-1557 BIL), perhaps the son of Kemnse, coil-

the intruders from Egypt, which was reunited under one sceptre.

pulsion of the Hyksus.
