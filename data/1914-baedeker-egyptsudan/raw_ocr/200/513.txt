hattlemeuts. Remote from the battlefield, to the extreme left, the
prince of the IIittites stands in his chariot, surrounded by his
guards, and Years before his majosty'. - Below the reliefs on the
W, towex is T long poetical description of the battle at Kadesh,
inscribed in vertical lines. It is continued on the E. tower, where,
however, the text ls still partly com-ealed by rubbish.

0n the front of each tower of the pylon are two large vertical
grooves for the reception of flag-staffs, and above these are large
square apertures to receive the braces securing the ilag-stafrs Mill
loopholes to admit light and air to the interior. The portal between
the towers is buried in rubbish and in a very ruinous condition.
The reliefs represent Ramses II. in presence of the chief deities of
the temple. The cnrviugsiu the doorway, in somewhat high relief,
date from the reign of the Ethiopian king Shahako.

Beyond the principal pylon (though not accessible from this
side, comp. 1). 257) lies the great Court of Ramses 11. (P1. A),
which was entirely surrounded by a double row oi'Iyrpyrus-eolurnns
(74 in all), with burr-capitals and smooth shafts. It measures
187 it. in length and 167 ft. in breadth, but, owing to the presence
at a mosque (p. 257), only the w. and 8. sides have been laid bare.
On a platform in the N.W. corner lies an ancient Chapel (P1. Th),
built by Thutmosis III. and restored by Ramses If. It contains
three chambers, of which that in the centre was dedicated to Amon,
that on the W, to Mut, and that on the E. to Khons, each eon-
tainiug the sacred bark of the god. On the side facing the court
it had lk small Colonnade of four clustered papyrus-eolumus in red
granite.

The Walls of the court are covered with reliefs and inscriptions,
including sacrificial scenes, hymns to the gods, representations of
conquered nations, ete., most of which date from the reign of Ram-
ses Ir. The relief on the S.W. wall (P1. Y) shows the facade of
the temple of Luxor, with the pylons and Mg-stairs, the colossal
statues, and the oheiisks, â€œhilc from the right approaches a Ill'ry-
cession, headed by the princes and followed by garlandcd animals
for saeriiieis. (The scene is continued on the W. wall.)

The S. half of the court is further embellished with standing
Calossi of Ilamses ff., placed between the columns in the first row.
These, with the exception of one in black granite, are wrought in
red granite and average 23 ft. in height. The finest (Pl. a) is Ir/s, ft.
high; the crown, carved from a separate block, has fallen off; on
the pedestal and apron is the name of Ramses II. On each side
of the S. doorway is another colossal figure of the king in black
granite, seated with the queen by his side.

On the S.side this court is adjoiued by a Colonnade (PLE), which
was originally intended as the beginning of an immense hyyostyle
hall (comp. p. 257). The colommde is in fairly good preservation
