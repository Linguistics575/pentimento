w. ANCIENT HISTORY.

Apries or Unphris tWeir-eb-re; the Hoplmzh of the Bible)
made another attempt to recover Syria, but was unable to
prevent the caplme of Jerusalem by Neboshadrtezzar in
586. A military rebellion in Libya dethroned Apries, and
his general Amasis was proclaimed king.

Amasis (Ahmose) secured his supremacy by marriage with
a daughter of Psammetichos 11. A campaign undertaken
by Nebuchadnezzar against Egypt led to the final abau-
donment of the Egyptian claims upon Syria. Amasis as-
signed the city of Naunratis (p. 32] to Greek colonists,
who speedily made it the most important commercial town
in the empire. A friendly alliance was made with Poly-
crates, tyrant of Samos.

Psammetichos III. was defeated at Pelusium by the Persian
king Gambyses, and Egypt became a Persian province.

The Persian monarchs appeared as successors to the native
rulers and by their moderation found favour with the greater
part of the populatiom This old religion was nnmoiested.

Camhysas led an unsuccessful expedition, via Khirgeh,
against the oases of the Libyan Desert and a campaign
against Ethiopia.

Darius L endeavoured to promote the prosperity of Egypt
in every possible way. The canal from the Nile to the
Red Sea was completed (p. 182). A strong garrison was
sent to the oasis of Khérgeh and a temple was built there
to Amon J. 381). After the battle of Marathon the
Egyptians, headed by Khubbush, revolted and expelled the
Persians. The insurrection, however, was queued by -

Xerxes L, who appointed his brother Achmmenes satrap,

Artaxerxesl. During his reign the Egyptians again revolted.
Faroe (Ert-Har-erow), prince of Marea, aided by the
Athenians, defeated Aolueineues, the Persian satrap, but
the allied Egyptians and Greeks were in turn defeated by
the Persian general Megahyzos near Prosopitis, an island
in the Nile, and [name was iyruoitied.

Darius II. The Persian power gradually declined. Under--.

Artaxatxas II. and his successor _

ceeded in regaining their independence for a brief period
under native rulers, whom Manetho assigns to the 28-
