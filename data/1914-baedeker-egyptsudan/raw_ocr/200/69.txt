Tlie Italian residents, 33.020 in Immhrr, unlmist uhiuliy oi trud-
ers of a humble class, hut include also many merchants, advoratcs,
and scholars. or French nationality [14,50]) are all the artisans 0f
the higher class, who are generally noted for their skill, trust-
worthiness, and sobriety. Most of the better shops are kept by
Frenchmen, and the chief European officials of the government,
including several architects and engineers, were until Iecently
French. The liritish settlers numbered GUS in 1882 and in 1907
90,653, im-Iusivc of the troops. Until recently their specialties
were the manufacture of nmchixmry and the construction of railways
and harbours; but of late they have also almost monopoiized the
chief posts in those branches of the administration (arruy, post am]
telegra ph o?iitw, railways, mistom- house) that have been wmoMlliyrl
after the I litish pattern. Apart from the troops, " large majority
of the residents who enjoy the protection of the I'rriiir,heousulate

colonies]. To the Maltese apply cvt‘n more forcibly must of the
remarks already made regarding the Greeks. It has been ascertained
that the Maltese settlers in foreign countries are more numerous
than those resident in their two small native islands, and of these
a cousiderahic proportion belongs to Egypt. At home, under the
discipline of British institutions, they fonn a pattern little nation
of their own, but in Egypt, where they are Reed from the restraint
of these influences, they are very apt to degenerate and to swell
unduly the ranks of the criminal class. Many of the Maltese, how-
ever, are enterprising tradesmen and industrious artisans, such as
shoemakers and juiners. To the Austrian (770i) and German (1817)

With regard to the capability of Europeans " becoming ac-
climatized in Egypt there are a nu mhcr of widely divergent opinions.
Much, of course, must depend on the nature of the climate of their
own respective countries, It has been asserted that European
families settled in Egypt die out in the second or third generation,
but of this there is no sufficient proof, " the European community
is of very recent origin, and many examples to the contrary might
he cited. Moreover as the Europeans in Egypt dwell exclusively in
the large cities, they do not afford very conclusive evidence on the
generai question; for city life, as opposed to country life, is even
less propitious to health and vigour in warm countries than it is in
northern elimes. Thus the Mamelukes have left no descendants in
Egypt. The climate of Egypt (comp. p. lxxvii) is less enervating
than that of most other hot countries, an advantage attributed to
the dryness ot' the air.
