papyrus). Sometimes the column represents as'nlgie plot-stem,
sometimes a cluster of stems held together by bands; while the
eapitai imitates in turn the closed bud or the open calyx (Fig. ll).
Thus there arise four varieties of plant-columns; the simple ph1nt-
column with bud-capitals and the same with caiyx-capitals; and
the clustered plnnt-column with bud or calyx capitals.

0f the various Lotus ColumtrsCwhieh seem to have been freely
used if we may judge from the numerous pictures of them) corn-
paratively few have been
preserved. Clustered tsol-
umns of this kind with "
Intd-eapitals occur during
the Ancient and Middle
Empires (in a tomb at
Benihasan), but appear to
have died out under the
New Empire. The above-
mentioned shaft at Beni-
hasan is formed of four
round stems, rising from
around base, and fastened
together at the top by
bands (Firm). The capi-
tal is formed of closed
buds, the green sepals of
which extend quite to the
top of the white petals of
the corolla. Near the top
of the shaft, between the
bands which hold the
main stems together, are
inserted smaller stems.
Examples of clustered
iotas-iyuumns with open (cniyx) mpitals (Fig. H) are frequently
seen in reliefs on tombs of the Ancient and Middle Empires; bat
they occur most often in buildings of the later period.

The Papyrus Calumm are mmh more numerous. They differ
widely from the lotus columns. The stems in the latter are circular
in section, while in thc papyrus-limes they are triangular, and
moreover taper rapidly at the basis, where they are encircled With
pointed leaves - characteristics that are wanting in the lotus-
cohimns. There is a difference also in the capitals, the sepals of
the lotus reaching to the upper edge of the flower (sec above), while
the leaves surrounding the nmbel of the papyrus are considerably
shorter. The simple papyrus-column with a trud-eapiral is seen only
in paintings and reliefs, whereas the clustered column is common
enough (Fig. IVa), The latter usually consists of eight stems held
