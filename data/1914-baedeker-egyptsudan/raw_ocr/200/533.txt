In the adjoining Central Court we come tlrst uyon an Obelisk,
the last survivor of four erected in pairs by Thutmosis I. and
Thutmosis Ill. It is 751/2 ft. high and stands upon a base 6 ft.
square. On each face of the obelisk are three vertical inscriptions,
the central one being the dedicatory inscription of Thutmosis I.
and the other two additions by Ramses IV. and Ramses VI. The
bases of the three other obelisks are adjacent. This ohelisks of Thut-
mosis I. marked the entrance to the temple in his reign.

Next follows Pyluu w, in a most ruinous condition. (According
to the inscriptions in relief the door was restored by Alexander the
Great.) Beyond it are the scanty remains of a -,

Colonnade, originally embellished with columns and with niches
containing colossal statues of Osiris (With arms crossed and the
symbol for 'life' in each hand) Within this colonnade rose the two
great Obelisks of Queen ffatsltepsttt, made of tim, pink granite from
Assuin and covered at the apex with electrum (a mixture of gold
and silver). The right obelisk has bean overthrown and broken;
long inscriptions on the base celebrate the power of the queen. The
left *Obelisk, still standing, is 97 ft. high and its diameter at the
base is 81/2 ft.; it is the tallest ancient obelisk known, with the
exception of the Lateran Obelisk (in Rome), whinh is 105 ft. high.
On each of the four sides is a single vertical inscription recording
the dedication of the ebelisks and the fact that they were made in
7 months, 011 the upper parts are reliefs, showing Hatshepsut,
Thutmosis L, and Thutrnosis Ill. sacrificing to Amon. The names
and tlgures of Amen Were obliterated by Amenophis IV., but
restored by Sethos l. By the wall to the left is a granite statue
of Thutmosis m., kneeling and holding an altar in front of him.

This Colonnade underwent various transformations under the 18th Dyn-
asty. When Thutmosis L built it originally it had a wooden roof borne
by wooden columns, afterwards replaced by stone ones, of which three
bases are still in gita. The two ohciisks were erected by Hatshepsnt
to celebrate the 16th year of her reign Thntmosis mt afterwards sur-
rounded the obelisk: with a sandstone structure which concealed them
to a height of about 82 ft., portions of which still remain. The colon-
nade Was transformed by receiving a stone roof supported by two rows
or payyruercolnmns (six on the N. side, eight on the so. The itvi, old
columns Were, however, retained. Niches were formed in the walls and
filled with statues of Thntmosis L, removed from the great court(p. 2510.
The decoration of the s. pert was not concluded until the reign of
Amenophis Ir.

Through the Fifth Pylon, also erected by Thutmosis I., we reach
two small Antechmmbers, inserted by Thutmosis III. in front of the
sixth pylon, and now in a state of ruin. To the right and left of
these are two larger courts adorned with colonnades of srxteen-sidisd
columns and statues of Osiris. These form the last remnant of the
great court ofThutmosis L, which once surrounded the temple ofthe
Middle Empire. In the passage leading to the N. court is a colossal
seated tigare of Ameneyhis IL) in red granite. - The Sixth Pylon,
the last and smallest of all, an erection ofThutraosis 111., is now in
