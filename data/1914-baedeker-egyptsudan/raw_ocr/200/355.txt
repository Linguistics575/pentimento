A
Circuit. PYRAMIDS OF GIZEH. th Route. 137

Between the Valley Temple and the Sphinx is a series of brick
walls, of the Ptolemaie or the Roman period, intended to protect the
Sphinx from the shifting sand.

The tombs surrounding the different pyramids, where the rela-
tives and gtate-o@Ols of the kings and also the priests and orfieials
of the various mortuary temples of the neeropolis were interred, are
far inferior in interest to the tombs that have been excavated and
rendered accessible at Salglséra (p. 149). Tet the manner in which
they are laid oat in streets and lanes, especially in the axea to the
W, of the (Heat Pyramid (recently excavated by German, Austrian,
and American explorers), affords the best extant picture of an Egyp-
tian necropolis. The so-called Tomb of Numbers (p. 139) and
Campbell’s Tomb (p. 138) are usually visited also.

Travellers who are not pressed for time and who desire to oh-
tain a closer view of the Second and Third Pyramids are recom-
mended to make the following *gireuit of the Pyramid Plateau
(comp. p. 123).

After having inspected the Great Pyramid (p. 127), we turn
(following the dotted line on the Plan, p. 123) to the left (wo of
the entrance and descend as far as the ‘W. angle of the Pyramid,
where the levelled space on the ground (b on the Plan), intended
for the reception of the oorner-stone, has been exposed to view.
Towards the W. and S.W. lie numerous mas.stpba-torr1trs presenting
an impressive appearance.

Those, however, who are not deterred by dimculhy win tind the tomb
(5th Dyn.) of Bhepserkeronek?' and his am: Imeri, almost due N. of the
Second Pyramid, the least inconvenient. This Urmb, called by the Beduins
Turba 14mm (Le, Lepsriasr's Tomb), is 1uslr-buried in sand, and visitors
have to crawl through the low entrance in order to reach the long
vaulted corridor, which is covered with reliefs and inscriptions. - The
beautiful tomb of b'tferAreurPtak (PI. c), a grandson of sltepses-keGonektt,
lies to the left (SO, bat is unfortunately quite buried.

We now skirt the N. and W. sides of the Vast r1eocopolis, and
reach the N.W. angle of the mcky enclusure of the court of the
Second Pyramid. A natural cleft in the rock (P1. i) here facilitates
our descent from the top of the rock, which is over 16 ft. in height.
At the foot or it we reach the levelled plateau prepared for this
pyramid (p. 131). On the surface are a number of regularly arranged
square incisions, separated from each other by furrows about 2 ft.
wide. These date from the quarrying operations (comp. p. 356)
carried on here during the building of the pyramid.

0n the rock above is an inscription in honour ofNer, chief architect
in the temple called ‘Runses II. shines in the Great House of the Prince'
(Le. Heliopolis) and son urBek-en-Amun. gt1iefarchiterrt nfThebes. 1n the
reign of Ramses n. Mei systematically demolished the temple of Rhephreu
or part of the facing of the pyramid to obtain materials for building a
temple at ms1iopolis.

0n theE. side ofthe Pyramid are remains of the mortuaryternple
