its disintegration. Egypt, indeed, at first stood oat against them,

Poirot The religious reaction was accompanied by a change in
ecclesiastical architecture tp. clsxx), and the establishment ofa
l'eutlal system (very different indeed from theEuropean system) coin-
cided with a total alteration of all titles of honour. The traditions
of Saladhfs epoch were carried on in all departments by the Mame-
lukes, whose "1nilueniye is most Icouspicuous in Egypt; while the
t'ontinuous reinforcements from Central Asia conducted at the same
time to the growing accentuation of the Asiatic elements. The
Mongol invasion, which tinaliy overthrew the Seljuk civilization in
Asia, came to a halt before the gates of Egypt. Egypt's brilliant
period ended only when she lost her political independence and
became subject t0 a foreign people from Central Asia, vis. the
Osman Turks (1517].

A glance over the historical development thus btiisfly sketched
shows at once why the Islamic civilization cannot properly be namml
al'ter any particular nation; from the very first it was a hybrid 1:ivi-
lization resting upon the intemational basis of religion. Yet amid
all the mingling or the various constituent elements, amid all the
eonfnsed shifting: of peoples, uno unifying principle is clear: viz.
the steady growth of Asiatic Ideas. Ante-dating Isliun, the process
had begun in a reaction against Greek intellectual supremacy and
lloman political dominion; European fetters wore burst asunder autl
shaken otl; and in the course of subsequent development both the
Near East and Egypt passed under the direct iuihieuce of Asiatic
omureptions, lirst in the intellectual and ilually also in the political
sphere. Mt that aeeotuplished, the vital ethnic force and the in-.
tellectual energy of Asia were exhausted. This is the true reason of
the striking decline of Islim under Osman rule. Its civilization
has culminated; strength fails it for a renaissance. At the present
day, just as m the Hellenistic period, the European spirit and Euro-
pean domination are pressing forward in theEast. This western move-
ment in thn historical process will certainly be followed by an'casteru
rvnctinn. In any case only the form and not the essence will be Chul-
mlm to the East aml West in the intellectual sphere so long as racial
