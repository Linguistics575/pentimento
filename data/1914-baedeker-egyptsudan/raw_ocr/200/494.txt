248 Route 19. DENDF,RA. Temple

We return to the second :tutechamher in order to visit thence
the innermost part of the temple, 'the hidden secret chambers', as
they are called in the inscriptions.

The central door leads to the profoundly dark Sanctuary, 'the
great seat', in Which the sacred boats with the images of the gods
formerly stood. The king alone, or his sacerdotal representative,
might enter this sacred precinct and in solitude commune with
the deity. Only once a year was this permitted even to him, at the
great festival of the new year. The reliefs on the walls depict the
rites which the king had to perform on entering the sanctuary, and
the saerifiees which he had to offer.

There are three rows of Runes. but only the lowest can he distinctly
seen even with the aid of in: electric or th magnesium lamp. The reliets
are an arranged that each scene on the Left Wall (PL Ic), beginning at
the entrance, is followed in 11istou'calseqtaenee by the corresponding scene
on the Right Wall (Pl. o. 1 (left) The king ascends the steps to the shrine
of the gods; 2 (right) Tremuhrely the hand tasteuihg the door; 3 (l.) breaks
the seal on the door; l (r.) opens the door; 5 (1.) gazes upon the god-

the heats of Hathor and llar-sem-tewc. - Rear Wall (PL m). To the left,
the king, before whom is the youthful sun or Hatbur with sistrum and
rattle, presents an image or the goddess Meat t0 Hatlmr and Horns of
Edfu; to the left, the same ceremony before Hathot aud Her-sem-tewe.

The Sanctuary is surrounded by a CORRIDOR, lighted by nper-
tures in the side-walls and in the ceiling, and entered from the
second anteehambe: by means of two side-doors. Oyening off this
corridor are " SMALL CHAMBERS (Pl. l-XI), which were used as
chapels dedicated to various deities, as store-rooms, and for dilTerent
religious purposes. Room I, which is embellished with reliefs like
those in the Sanctuary, contained a shrine with an image of Hathol.
A modern iron staircase in this mom leads to a small Niche in the S.
wall, containing a relief of Hathor.

Before ascending to the roof of the temple, we should visit the
subterranean chambers, or Crypts, in which were preserved such
saerifioiirl vessels and images of the gods as were no longer in use
They claim attention not only for their remarkable construction but
also for the fresh tints of their paintings. The temple contains no
fewer than 12 crypts, constructed in the thickness of the temple
walls in different stories and entered by narrow flights of steps or by
openings concealed by movable stone slabs. Their elaborate mural
reliefs date from the reign of Ptolemy X111. Neos Dionysus, and are
therefore the oldest as well as the best executed decorations in the
temple. The custodian will open7 on request, the locked crypts
(Nos. 4 and 7), both of Which are worth a visit (magnesium wire "
a lamp desirable). Comp. the a0oompirnying Plans.

in mm No. 4, which we eater through a square opening in the pave
ment, are several nenow chambers, on the walls of which are depicted
the objects that used to be preserved here The colouring ofthn admirably

executed reliefs is remarkably fresh. oh the right wall of the second
room to the right is an interesting relief ofKing Phiopswth Dyh.) kneel
