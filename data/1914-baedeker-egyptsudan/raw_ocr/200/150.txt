cxliv w. EGYPTIAN RELIGION.

for the fragments, and wherever one was found she buried it and
erected a monument on the spot to its memory; and this accounts
for the numerous tombs of Osiris mentioned as existing in Egypt
and elsewhere. When Horus grew up he set out to avenge his
father's murder, and after terrible contests was at last vietoriout.
According to other accounts the combatants were separated by Thout.
They then divided the country, the S. of Egypt falling to Horus and
the N. to Seth. Osiris was afterwards magically restored to life by
Horns and continued to rule the W. land as king of the dead.
Among the Egyptians as with other peoples the speculations
about the origin of the world, the movements of the heavenly bodies,
and the alternation of day and night were closely bound up with
their religion. Their conception of the world reveals the limited
geographical horizon of the ancient Egyptians. They regarded the
earth as a huge oval plain, floating upon the, ocean. From one end
to the other it was traversed by a broad stream, the Nile, which
flows out of the ocean on the S. or rises from two springs near the
cataracts of Assuau. All around rose high mountains, and the sky
was pictured as a flat slab resting upon four mountains, with the
stars hanging from it like lamps. Another view was that the sky
had the same form as the earth, and was traversed by a river and
intersected by numerous canals; and under the earth there was be-
lieved to be an underworld, called Twat, which was exactly like the
sky and the earth and was peopled by the dead. After the oow-god-
dess Hathor had become a goddess of the heavens (see p. cxliit) the
sky was sometimes conceived " as a cow, with the sun seated be-
tween its horns illuminating the world. Another view was that the
sun sailed in a boat by day on the cow, as on the ocean of the sky,
while the stars were represented on the body of the cow; Show, the
god of the air, stood below the cow of the heavens and supported it.
The sun and the moon, the principal heavenly bodies, were in
particular the subject of many theories, probably representing the
teachings of the different colleges atâ€˜priests throughout the country.
A very early idea represented the sun and moon as the eyes of the
great god who created the world. At the same time this great god is
no other than the sun-god He himself, so that we have the contra-
dictory idea that the incorporation of the sun (Re) had the sun " an
eye. When Horus became a sun-gnd the sun and moon were con-
sidered to be his eyes. In one way or another the eye of the sun
played a very important part in Egyptian mythology. It was thought
of as a sun and was transformed into an independent goddess pro-
ceeding from the sun-god. With this eye of the sun are identified
the serpent-goddess Buto, of Lower Egypt, and afterwards other god-
desses also, such as the lion-headed Tefuut and the eow-goddess
Hather. The eye of the sun was sometimes thought of as a poisonous
serpent (means serpent) rearing itself on the forehead of the sun-god
and breathing tire against his enemies. This idea gave rise to the
