the rank of Khedive, or Viceroy, having previously borne
the title of man, or governor of a province only. in 1869
the Suez Canal was opened (p. 184). In 1873 the Khe-
dive obtained a new tirman eoniirming and extending his
privileges [independence ofadministratiou ancijudieiaries;
right of concluding treaties with foreign countries; right
of coining money; right of borrowing money; permission
to increase his army to 30,000 men). The annual tribute
payable to the Porte was fixed at 133,635 purses [about
700,000t0. The warlike successes of the Khedive re-
suited in the extension of his dominions to the borders
ofAbyssinia and. on the s., to the 2nd parallel ofN.lati-
tude. - The burden of the public debt had now increased
to upwards of 100,000,0001., one loan after another haw

to bear on the Khedive that he was compelled to resign
his private and family estates to the state and to accept a
ministry under the presidency of Ntahar Pasha, with the
portfolio of public works entrusted to II. luignibres and

accordingly took place on June 20th. He died at Cons:tan-

Turkish pronunciation), under whom the government was
carried on in a more rational spirit. The debts were Teg-
ulated, an international commission of liquidation was
appointed, and an extensive scheme of reform was under-
taken. In Sept., 1881, however. a military revolution
broke out in Cairo, which had for its chief object the
emancipation of Egypt from European ir1ihreaees. The
Khedive was besieged in his palace and had to yield; he
appointed Sherifpresident of a new ministry and arranged
for an election of Notables, or representatives. As the
latter espoused the 'national' eause, Sheri? resigned in
Feb., 1882, and Mahmiid Pasha formed a new ministry,
