Heuenistic Christian civilization, which we must regard as the
hybrid product of Greek and Asiatic feelings and philosophy.

When that point is established Islamic civilization falls into its
natural position in the, general scheme of the historical develop-
ment of the world. From the days of Alexander the Great down to
the llomau imperial epoch the East had been forced to bow to
European ideas and to submit to European domination. But just as
in the days of the early emperors the Ilellenic spirit was suttoV
ml in the embmce of the Orient and the classical world hungrily
assimilated the cults and religions of the East; so an ethnical re-
naissance of the East began in the second century and the Semitic
element steadily asserted itself beneath the Hellenistic surface.
With the spread of the Arabs the Orient once more achieved an
independence in the political sphere, corresponding to that Whit'h
had slowly been growing in the intellectual sphere. The tirst sesult
ot' the political union of the whole of the Near East was that the
Greek intellectual impulses them, cut off from theirorighral sources
ut' inspiration and operating only through Semites, were submerged
by orirsritalisrn, On the other hand the seeds of Asiatie civilization
found fresh nourishment in the new whole formed by the permanent
politirral connection: between the Near EASt and Western Asia; and
the Asiatic reaction against the comprehensive expansion of the
Greek spirit operated until far on in the Islamic period. Thus Js-
lamie civilization h'rtds its organic connection with and place in the
general course " history. Further, we recognize another important
bond of connection; for, if Islim simply carried Christian civiliza-
tion a step farther, we are no longer surprised by the profound
inner relationship between the mental outlook of medieval Christ-
ianity and that of Islam; both systems Ire based upon the common
foundation ofthe Greek-Orieutal civilization of Christian antiqui
'l'he Arabs on th no hand consistently stressed the oriental ttle-
meats in this ci zatiou; while on the other hand, on European
soil, the Germanic spirit turned farther and tarther away from these
and elaborated from its inner consciousness the typical western
tonns ot' the middle ages.

From these fundamental principles it becomes clear why Arabia
could not permanently remain the seat of the Caliphate, Damascus
superseded Medium It was only in the agitated period of the Arab
empire. the period of expansion, that the artificial condition ol'
the political supremacy of the Arabs aver subjects superior to them
in culture could be maintained. In the long run the economir
and intelleetnal inilueuee of the subjugated races was bound to
tell and the deposition " the Arab ruling class was inevitable.
The levelling influence of Islam, as it was understood by the over-
whelming majority of its converts, destroyed the economic basis of
the Arab dominion and with it the prerogatives of the. Arabs as
such, The net results of the Arab period of Islamic civilization
