whose amiability and intelligeneeare tlwit superseded bysullcuness
and obstiaaey. Thus down to a few years ago, as in the time of
Ammianus Marcellinns, the iellah would often suffer the most cruel
blows in dogged silence rather than pay the taxes demanded of him.

In his own fields the fellah is an industrious labourer, and his
work is more continuous than that of the peasant of more northern
countries. He enjoys no period of repose during the winter, and the
whole of his spare time is occupied in drawing water for the irriga-
tion of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to im-
prove his system- of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the
most necessary tasks he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will
do the remainder of his work for him. The fellah is generally of a
peaceful disposition, kinrllyaud helpful to hisneighhour. Foreigners
can see his best side only by observing his dealings with his fellows;
for he regards strangers as merely so many convenient sources of
profit (comp. pp. xxiv, xxv).

(2). CoPTs V 'thy). While we have regarded the fellahin as
genuine Egypti; is I consequence oi‘their uninterrupted occupation
ofthe soil, the religion ofthe Copts affords us an additional guarantee
for the purity of their descent. The Copts are undoubtedly the most
direct descendants oi the ancient Egyptians, there being no ground
for the assumption that their ancestors were foreign immigrants who
embraced Christianity after the tauquest of the country by the
110hammedans, while on the other hand the ohstinaey with which
they defended their monophisite Christianity for several centuries
against the inroads of the creed of Byzantium affords another
indieationYr their Egyptian character. At the last census (1907) the
number of Uopts in Egypt was 70b1322.t They are most uumexous
in the towns of Upper Egypt (554,282), around the ancient lioptos,
at Nalizideh, Luxor, Esueh, Demlera, Girgeh l hta, and partieirlarly
at Assitit and Akhmim.

The Coptic Patriarch is elected from their own number by the "mum
at the live chief monasteries of Egypt. These are the monasteries of 51.

trade, or as clerks, accountants, and notaries. 'l'heir yhysique is
sretsordiugly materially different from that of the fellahin and even
from that of Coptic' peasants. They are generally of more delicate
frame, with small hands and feet; their necks are longer and their
skulls are higher and narrower than those of the peasautry; aud,
