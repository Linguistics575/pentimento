412 Route 31. SECOND CATARAG'L

On the W. bank, opposite Wadi Haifa, a little to the N. ofa large
and conspicuous syeamoris-tree, lay the ancient town of Buhen, the
site of which may be reached by boat from the town of Halfa in
1-2 hrs. (eeeording to the wind). The remains of two temples are
still extant. The Norms 't'EMem1, dating from the beginning of the
12th Dyn., was built of brick, with the exception of the pillars in
the first ball and the jambs of the tsntrauee-doirr, which were of
sandstone. It is much damaged and sanded up. The inscriptions
found here date from the time of Amenophis If, and Sethos I. The
SOUTH Teune, about 50 yds. distant, was exhumed in 1887 by
Grl. (now Mar-oem Sir Oh. H.) Smith and is now protected by a
wooden structure (adm. 10 pies.) It is in better preservation than
the other, its sandstone walls and pillars still rising to the height
of 5-6 ft. This S. temple Was built by Thutmosis 111. and IIat-
shepsut and dedicated to Horus of Buhen. The cartouches and
"tlres of Iiatshepsut have been systematically defaced or eon-
verted into those of Thntmosis H. (p. cii). The temple stands from
E. to W. Close to the river-bank, where traces of a quay may be
made out, is a brick Pylon, the S. tawer of which rises like a mas-
sive pillar. Behind is a large Hall, the present form of which is
due to a reconstruction, probably at the beginning ofthe 20th Dyn-
asty. The pillars and columns on which the roof rested hear not
only the original reliefs and inscriptions of Thutmesie ill. but also
numerous hieroglyphic inscriptions added by oflieials of the New
Empire. There are also Creek, Carian, and Meroi'tic inscriptions.
On one pillar is a long and pompous inscription celebrating the
deeds of Thutmosis ill. Behind this hall lies the Temple Proper,
the back of which adjoined the cliff, while on the other three sides
were colonnedes with 'proto-Done' columns. Within are a Trans-
verse Hall, communicating with the Sanctuary, and several other
chambers. The admirable mural reliefs, many of which retain their
colouring, represent the Pharaoh in presence of the gods. - Beside
the temples lie the ruins of the ancient town, and on a hill to the
w. are graffiti of the Middle Empire. In the desert close by are
ancient graves.

*Excunswy TO THE SECOND CATARACT t5-9 hrs.). - The camels
or donkeys shouid be sent in advance to the ruined temples of Buhen,
Whither the trnvelier proceeds by boat (see above), or the start may be
made from the W. bank immediately op osite Wadi Haifa. The ride
from Buhen to the rock of Abuexr takes 1% hr by donkey.

After leaving the ruined temples the route at first skirts the
stream, then turns inland towards the desert, and finally, gradually
aseertding,returrrs to the stream shortlybefore the cataract is reached.

The Second Cataract is superior in scenic beauty to the First
Cataract at Assuan. It lies at the N.e11d " the gorge of the Bqtn
rl-Hagar ('belly of stones'), which begins at the island of Del
about 90 M. to the S. , and through which the river descends in a
