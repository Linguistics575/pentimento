the doors, is a Me relief: Philometot, rlad in a white mantle and
accompanied by Cleopatra, stands before the falcon-headed moon-
god Khons, who writes the none of the king upon a palm-btaneh,
from which hangs the symbol for length of life; behind are Sohek
and Haroéris, the chief gods of Ombes.

Two doors lead from Aateeharntyer III to the two SANchmzs, of
which that to the left (Pl. ff) was dedicated to HaruEris, that to the
right (PI. S) to Sobek. In each is a pedestal ol‘blach granite on which
the sacred boat with the image of the god was placed. Beside and
behind these sanctuaries ere smaller apartments with crypts.

Two small side-doors lead from the promos to an INNER. PASS-
AGE round the temple proper, at the innermost part of which are
seven doors opening into as many (hususmss(Pl. I-WI). These
contain 11uiinishtyd reliefs and inscriptions, which are interesting
on account of their various stages of completion. In the central
mom (Pl. IV) is a staircase to the upper story.

On the terrace in front of the great temple lies a small Birth
House, racing towards the S.Ii., and now in a most ruinous con-
dition. It was built or restored by Euergetes ll. Among the extant
reliefs one (at Pl. o) deserves notice. It represents Euargetes 11.
with two gods sailing in a boat through the marshes, which are
bordered with papyrus-plants thronged with birds; to the left is the
ilhyphallie god Miri-Atnort-lté. - On the i . side is a srrbter-
rnnean staircase (Pl. p) leading to the river, on the bank of which
is a nilometer [much damaged), like that at Edfu.

Finally we visit the small ur1iiuished UIIAYEL or Hnnoe, built
of red sandstone under the Emp. Domitian. In one of its rooms
are mummies of sacred crocodiles found in the vicinity.

The terrace in front of the temple commands a beautiful *View
of the Nile and the distrirts on the W. bank, while from the rubbish-
mouuds beside the temple we may survey the new irrigated region
beside ktm Omho, the villages of Shath and Daraw, the island of
Mam.stsriyeh, and the desert to the W.

Above lihm Omho the channel of the river narrows. - Damw
a railway station (p. 341), lies on the E. bank. - On the W. bank,
near Ralaibeh, are the ruins of the ancient Contra-Ombos.

The scenery becomes tamer beyond the village of Kubdnfyeh, on
the W. bank, near which are 'sarly-Egyptiatt cemeteries.

Opposite rises the Gabe! et-f.rarnrruhn, with quarries which
yielded stone for the old temple at Ombos as early as the reign of
Hatshepsut (18th Dyn.). To the W. the yellow sand of the desert
often extends right rlown to the river. At Eb-Rhurt.hra [railway
station, p. MI) granite appears for the first time.

We now pass the large and wtyll-tilled island of Bahr?f(p. 362),
with its Iyurn-groves and fields. Opposite, near EL- WCsreydb, on the
W. bank, are some quarries (with gramti).

As we approach Assuan (E. bank) the scene presented to us is
