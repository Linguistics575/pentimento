These schools, mostly founded by endowments of the Wa1.cf Administra-
lion (p. luxvi), are now managed by the Ministry of Education. The were
reading and recitation of verses from the Koran being in itself considered
it meritorious hut, the great object of these schools is to teach the pupils
to recite the Koran by heart. Although the language is often antiquated
and obscure, nu cxp1aurrt'urrts are given, so that the boy who knows the
whale buck by heart usually understands but little of it. After learning
the alphabet the pupil is taught to write afew simple words, such as the
names of his friends, and then learns the ninetruiae 'beaatieul' names
or Allrrh, a knowledge or which is necessary to enable him to repeat the
niaety-isiue prayers of the Mnhmmmedun rosary (sebly0. The boy is next
made to learn the Fzâ€˜ttha (p.1xxxvii), or thrst chapter (uireh) of the Korau,
after which he proceeds to learn the hat, the last bat hue, and the others
in the same inverted order, until he reaches the second, the reason being
that the chapters gradually diminish in length from the second to the last.
The course of study frequently takes 44% years and its completion is com-
xnemomted by the celebration n: the Knatmeh, a family festival, to which
the schoolmaster is invited.

The Bazaarsi of Cairo, though inferior to those of Damascus
and Constantinople, present to the European traveller many novel
features and many interesting traits of oriental character, As is
the universal custom in the East, shops of the same kind, with
their workshops, are congregated together in the same quarter,
named sometimes after a mosque but more usually after the wares
there sold, e.g. S111.- ert-Aral/.h8stn, bazaar of the eopyersmiths, Stilt
et-lrhordafiyeh, bazaar of the ironmongers. Most of the bazaars con-
sist of narrow, and often dirty, lanes, generally covered over with
an awning to shade them from the sun, and i1:mlred with shops ahout
li ft. wide. These shops (dukkin) are open towards the street, and
in front of each is a magtaba or seat on which the customer takes his
place and on which the shopkeeper offers his prayers at the appointed
hours. These lattes usually enclose a massive storehouse of cow
siderable size (khan), consisting of two stories. Several sueh khius
together form a quarter of the city (Mm) These were formerly
closed at night by massive, iron-mounted gates, still in some cases
preserved, though no longer used.

The principal market-days are Monday and ThuvstlayY when
the traffle in the narrow streets is so great that it becomes drt'Mult
or impossible to traverse them. Pedlars are seen fuming their way
through the crowd, shouting at the top of their voiees. So, too, we
observe eoffee-sellers, water-Barriers, sweetmeat-vendors, and others,
elbowing their way.

In walking through bazaars and other streets the traveller will
he interested in observing how industriously and skilfully the
ABTISANS work, with tools of the most primitive description. The
tumers (Klu1rrtr.t), for exiunple,areequally admit with hand and foot.

large trot1rts, are called waklmleh Dr wakkala. which the Franks have
