A halt for breakfast is made here. The line follows the edge of
the cultivated land a little farther, then strikes off into the desert,
gradually ascending through a valley narrowing as we ascend and
ilanked by picturesque rocks. At 25 M. the plateau is reached, and
a bouiu1less sea of gravelly desert extends on every hand, giving
place farther on to a rocky waste. After 90 M. the railway begins
to descend through a rocky valley of peculiar beauty. It then crosses

The Oasis of Khviryeh, the 'Southern Oasis' of the ancient Egyp-
tians, the 'heat Oasis' of the Greeks, forms a district of the pro-
vince of Assitrt. It is about 185 M. long and 20-50 M. broad, and
is situated in N. lat. 25026' and E. long. 30°33’. The population
uumhers 8383. Like all the cases Khirgeh is surrounded by a toler-,

to the height of Mioft. on theside next thedesert. Thanks to numer-
