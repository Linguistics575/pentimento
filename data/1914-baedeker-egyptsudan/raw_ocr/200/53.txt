II. GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES. xlvii

Upper Egypt, known as E§-$a'id, extends nominally to the First
Cataract only, but now embraces in a political sense most of Lower
Nubia (comp.p. 384). Politically Egypt is now divided into fourteen
Pnovmcns or JMdtrtyeh. The provinces of Lower Egypt are: (1)
Iralytibtyeh (Qalinbia), at the head of the Delta, with Benha as its
capital; co Slmrlciyeh (Sharqia), Le. 'the eastern', with Zakizik as
its capital; O) Dulcahliyeh (Daqahlia), with Mausyira as its capi-
tal; (4] Mcmi/‘iyeh Chrenuiia), with Shibin M- Khu as its capital;
(5) Gharbiyeh (Gharbia), i.e. ‘the western', with Tanta as its tapi-
tal; (6) Beyireh (Beheim), Le. ‘of the lake', with Darnanhih as its
capital. The last includes the oasis of SIweh. The following tHe
goveruomtes are presided over by governors flfoyd(es) of their
own, and are independent of the provincial administration: Cairo,
Alexandria, I’ort Sa'id, Isrngriliyeh, and Suez. Sinai and El-‘Arish
are administered by the War Oiiiee. The eight Upper Egyptian
provinces are those of Giseh (Giza), Benisueif (Beni Suef), I'triy0m
[Fayum), Minych (Minia; with the oases of Bahriyeh and 1'irr6trti),
Assiat (with the eases of DCs/Welt and Khoveh), Girgeh (Girga , capi-
tal, Sous), Yeneh [Qena), and Aswan (Aswan).

The chief ofiieia1 in every prevince is the Nadir or Governor.
Each m0ir is assisted by a sub-rmidis, a commandant of police, a
sanitary inspector, and an engineer (for irrigation and buildings).
The interior economy and the firiarioial procedure are subject to in-
vestigation by European inspectors from the Ministries of the III-
terior and Finance, while ethers from the Ministry of Public Works
and the Health Department control the technical work. The 14 pro-
vinces are subdi ded into 84 districts, called Markus, the chief
tyffieials of which (Ma'mar) are directly subordinate to the mridir
and have their ofiiryial residence in the more important towns. The
markaz, in their turn, are divided into AYryyeh, or communes, which
include, besides the chief village, hamlets, settlements of vgrirstil-
tural labourers ('h'sbeh), and landed estates (Ab‘adiyeh). The '0rn-
deh, or chief magistrate of the commune, is directly responsible to
the ma'rutir. In the larger communes the 'omdeh is assisted by the
Shaikh el-Beled, er mayor. The govcrxloratns are divided into tluar-
ters (Kism), each of which has its ma'tnor.

According to the census of 1907 the POPULATION ongypt proper
was 11,237,359, of whom 10,903,677 were settled natives, 97,381
were Bcduins, and 286,301 were foreigners (147,220 Europeans
including 20,653 British). The numbers of males and females were
approximately equal. The settled population was distributed in
2 large cities (Cairo and Alexandria), 43 other towns with upwards
" 10,000 inhab., and 3580 villages. The ahove figures show a po-
pulatiou of 940 per sq. M. for Egypt proper, a density unequalled
by any country in Europe (England and Wales 019, New York
State 191, Saxony 830 per sru0. The total populaiton in 1897
was 9,734,405, in 1882 it was 6,831,131.
