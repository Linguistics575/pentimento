government ot'tiises; but they Were soon doomed to suffer persecutions
and privations of every description. These persecutions were mainly
due to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual conspiracies
against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries
even attributed to them the disastrous contraption: fremâ€˜which
the new capital of the country so frequently suiIered. Their hopes
were doomed to hitter clisappoinhnent, and their national pride to
utter humiliation. Their conquerors succeeded in maintaining their
position, and though apparently at first inclined to moderation, were
at length driven by the conduct and the previous example of the
Copts themselves to persecute and oppress them to the Uttermost.

In spite, however, of all these disasters a numerous community
of Copts has always existed in Egypt, a fact Which is mainly to be
accounted for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual oppression
aml contempt to which they have been subjected, they have de-
generated in every respect, while their character has been correspond-
ingly altered. Their divine worship will strike the traveller as
strange, and anything bat edifying or elevating (comp. p. 1071.
It is true that the Copt is a regular attendant at church ('lumiseh'),
but his conduct while there and the amount of b0netit he receives
are somewhat questionable. In the survive the Coptic language, Le.
the language of the Egyptians of the 3rdcent.A.D., is used for pray-
ing and chanting. But as the majority even of the priests themselves,
though able to read this ancient speech, do not understand it, the
Arabic translation of the prayers is given at the same time, and
the sermon is delivered in Arabic. Since the 6th cent. the doc-
trine of the Jacobites has been in a state of deathlike lethargy which
has made even the slightest attempt at further development im,
possible. In no other religious community is fasting so common "
uluong the Uhristians of Egypt and Abyssinia. They still found their
creed upon Old Testament institutions, ;urd se show pretty clearly
that had Christianity been eontiaed to the East it would never have
become the chief religion of the world. The Coptic church has not
even training-colleges for its ministers.

The Copts are no longer distinguished from the Arabs by their
dress. Only the priests now wear the dark blue or black turban and
the, dark-eoloured clothes, a costume that was originally prescribed
by their oppressors, A practised eye will frequently detect among
them the aneiotEgyptian castof features. Towardsstmngers the Colit
is esternallyobiigiug, and when anxious to secure their favour he not
anfrepently appeals to his Christian creed as a bond of union. Many
Copts have recently been converted to Protestantism by American mis-
sionaries, particularly in Upper Egypt, ishiet1y through the foundation
ofgood schools and the distribution of eheap Arabie llihles. Even the
orthodox Cupts have a great reverence for the sacred volume, and it
is not uncommon to meet with members of their seat who know the
