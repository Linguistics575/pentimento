and are destitute ot‘deeoration. The corpse, wrapped in white cotton
cloth, is placed upon a bed of sand, with the face turned towards
Mecca. When both sexes are interred in the same vault n partition-
wall is erected to sepante them. Above the vault stands a nenotaph
(Tarlcibeh when of stone or brick, Ttbtlt when ofwoml] resting on a
pedestal, with a small pillar or column at each end. On the column
at the head of the grave is frequently represented a turban or
t.arb0sh, indicating the rank and sex of the deceased. The inscrip-
tions give the name and the date of death, with texts from the
Koran. Over the eenotaphs of persons of distillation are often cane-
pies, resting on four columns, Wealthy families surround the tomhs
with extensive buildings (l.lhh), including rooms for mourners,
sehil, slahles, eustodian's residence, tste. The tombs of the Caliphs
and Mamelnkes at Cairo (p. 111) include many sneh erections, which
lend the cemeteries the appearance of small half-deserted towns.

Among Secumn Buumxus the Fortiiieiyti0ns of the citadel of
Cairo (p. 68), dating from the time of Saladin1 recall the medizeval
castles of Europe. Some of the numerous gates in the walls of Cairo
date from the Fatimite period; they were probably built after Roman
models and are distinguished for the skill with which they are con-
structed, especially for accuracy in the jointing of the stones.

or the ancient Palaces nothing but mine now remains. The
lower stories, built of massive blocks, have harrel-vaults and pointed
arches of hewn stone, the upper stories have similar vaults in
lighter masonry. In one case, viz. the Ihir Beshték Palace at Cairo
(p. 76), we observe remains of balconies and Ma projecting, slightly
curved eornire supported by wooden consoles; and traces of richly
painted and gilded coffered ('uilings are likewise met with. From an
examination of the scanty remains and with the help of the Arabic
writers, whose descriptions, however, are seldom free from exagger-
ations, we may cem‘lnde that tho palaces resembled in general the
houses of the richer private citizens (many of which have been
preserved), exceeding them only in sire and splendoun

Dwelling Houses (comp. the plans at pp. clxxxiv, clxxsv) rarely
have more than two stories; on the groundMor is the Suldmlik, the
men‘s apartments, and on the tirst Mor the IJartm or Harem, the
women’s apartments and family rooms. The following rules are gen-
erally observed in the construction of a dwelling-house: - (1) The
principal rooms look into the court or garden. (2) The windows look-
ing to the street Me as few as possible and placed very high, while.
those of the upper floors are closed with gratings. (3) The passage
(Dirkeh; Pl. I, 3) leading from the street to the court is built in the
form of an angle, to prevent people from seeing into the court. (4) The
door to the harem (PI. H, 4) is placed in a separate court or, failing
that, in a retired part of the court of the salemlik. (5) The recep-
tian-rooms of the master ofthe house, the servants'9uartisrs, kitchen,
mill, and stuhles are arranged round the nonrt of the salémlik.
