Fellahin. l't)LITIU'KL NOTES liii

The dress ol' the Egyptian peasant calls for little remark, Cspe-
cially as he usually works in the fields divested of everything except
a scanty apron. The chief articles of his wardrobe at other times
are an indigo-dyed cotton shirt ([camig), a pair of short and wide cotton
breaches, a kind of cloak of brown, home-spun goats' wool ('abt‘tyeh),
or simply It blanket of sheep's wool (l/irthu), and lastly a close-
fitting felt skulI-cap (libdehi He is generally baretboted, but oi'.0'rt-
siounlly wears pointed red (rruwkt"ds) ox broad yellow shoes (balghd).
The sheikhs and wealthier peasants wear wide, black woollen cloaks
and the thick red 'Tunisian' fez (turbzish) with a hiue silk tassel,
round which they coil a turban ('imma; usually white). They usn-
ally curry .1 long and thick stick (nébat), made ot'ash imported from
Cararuauia. All watchmen carry similar sticks as ll badge of oniee.

The sole wealth of Egypt is derived from its agriculture, and to
the fellahiu alone is committed the important task of tilliug the soil.
They are, indeed, neither fitted not inclined for other work, a circum-
stance which proves how completely the settled character of the
ancient Egyptians has predominated over the restless Arabian blood,
which has been largely infused into the native population ever since
the valley of the Nile was conquered by the armies of Islitu, The
ancient Egyptian racial type has been preserved in extraordinary
purity in many fellah families, especially in Upper Egypt. This is
patttealarly evident in the case ot' the children and women, whose
features are not concealed um] distorted by veils (which the ancient
ligyptians despised). Even among the Nubiaus (p. Ix), betwcexi
the lirst and second cataracts, fares occur that might almost lead us
to think that some at the pictures ot' the period of the obl Pharaohs
had come to life and stood hel'ore us in tleah and blood. In Lower
Egypt, and especially in the Delta, the Semitic type has smnetimcs
prevailed over the African in rousequeucc of the steady stream or
Ai'ubiuunigration that has now been flowing fonnme than uthousaunl
yearst The modem Egyptians, moreover, resemble the ancient in
character and in the lot to whiuh they are condemned. In ancient
times tht' fellnh, pressed into the svrvine of the priests and the
princes, was compelled to yield up to them the fruits of his toil,
and his position is newly the same at the present tiny, save that the
names of his masters are changed, and he has obtained some relief
uuing to the almost entire abolition of compulsory work.

In early life the Egyptian peasant is remarkably docile, active,
and intelligent, but at a later period this freshness and huoynuey ate
erushed out of him by rare and poverty and his never-ceasing task
of tilling the pitcher of the l9anaides, He ploughs and maps, tails
and amasses, but he cannot with cermiuty regard his crops as his
own, and the hardly earned piastre is too frequently wrested from
him. His character, therefore, becomes like that Ufa gifted child,
who has been harshly used and brought up to dnmestic slavery, but
at length perceives that he has been treated witl/ injustice, and
