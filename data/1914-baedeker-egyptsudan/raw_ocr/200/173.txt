ings. lit the late period and especially under the Ptolemies tho
secular representations on the external walls and the walls of the
court gave place to religious scenes; the battlty-soenes and triumphs
of the ruler are superseded by sak1tieial and other sacred scenes
depicted at tedious length. On the pylons, however, the primitive
typical ligure of the Pharaoh smiting his enemies in presence of
the god still appears. _ The temple, moreover, like his house and
his tomb, was in the eyes of the Egyptian a type in small of the
world. The roof corresponded to the sky, and was, therefore, irppro-
priately adorned with stars upon ahlue ground, while above the
middle passage hovered vultures. protecting the king as be passed
along below. Not unfrequently, and especially in the temples of
the Ptolemaic period, the ceiling is adorned ssith astronomical Te-
presentations - the gods and goddesses of the months and days,
the planets, various constellations, and the goddess of the sky
herself, on whose body rested the heat of the sun. Similarly the
pavement represented the earth. llere (La on the hnttam of the
walls) we see flowers blooming or long processions of the re-
prescntatives of the homes and other divisions of the country, and
ot' the river and canals, bringing their characteristic products as
oireriugs to the deities of the temple. Egypt was traditionally re-
garded as divided into two portions - a northern and a southern -
and similarly the entire world as represented in the temple was also
regarded as consisting ofa N. half and a S. half. The represent-
atives of the N. appear on one side, those of the S. on the other;
and even in the ceremonial religious scenes on the walls this
distinction may frequently be traced. The entire tcraps-prior/s
were enclosed by a massive hrick wall, the portal of which (gener-
ally a pylon) was approached by a dromos or avenue of sphinxes or
of animals sacred to the god (6.9. in Thebes recumbent rams). With-
in this wall stood also the dwellings of the priests, besides store-
houses and stables, so that the temple proper, like an Arab mosque
of to-day, stood in the midst of a uomplexus of domestic buildings.

Owing to the great value of cultivable land in Egypt Tombs
were not placed in the lower portions of the Nile valley, hut in tiw
more talented desert-regions, which, moreover, being beyond the
reach of the inundation, were in any case better adapted for the
preservation of the dead. The Egyptiaatornb always had a double
function to fulfil; it not only served as a safe resting-place for the
dead, but it was also a place where the survivors could meet on
certain days and oirer gifts to the deceased. Thus the tomb was in
two parts, the actual Tomb in the ground, and the Place of Worship
above ground. .-- The most ancient graves were simple pits, in
which the corpses wore laid; these were frequently walled with
bricks and covered over with beams, Larger pits were divided
