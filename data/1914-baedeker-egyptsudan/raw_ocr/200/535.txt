reliefs by Queen Hatshepsut. As in all other places, the names and
figures of the queen have been scratched out or replaced by those of
Thutmosis u. or Thutmosis 111. In the S. half are a room containing
a staircase leading t0 the roof, and a chamber with a granite altar
dedicated by Thutmosis IU. Here is also a tine statue of Athena-
phis II. (sitting beside a tlamagctl flgur0 of Amen].

The Iezlizfs of Oreea Ilalahepm, in a. room to the N. shut off by a black
granite doar (key with N. Legrain, p. 26.1), are very fine and have retained
their colour well. The left wall, which originally adjuined the N. wall
of the second reeunl hall, was removed thence and re-erected here.

We now descend to the E. to an oyen space, strewn with the
scanty relies of the earliest Temple ofthe Middle Empire. In front
of the chambers of Thutmosis IU., which may he recognized on the
N. side, ran a path, on which the Pharaohs erected statues to the
grandees judged worthy of that honour. - We next reach the -

Great Festu Temple of Thutmosis 111. We enter by the main portal
on the S.W. (PI. a), in front of which stand two statues of the king
as Osiris (the left one oly complete) and the stumps of two sixteen-
sided columns. We turn to the left, traverse the antechamhers,
and tind ourselves in the Great Fatal Hall, which has the aisles
and is 144 ft. wide and 52 ft. deep. The roof of the three central
aisle, which were higher than the others, Was supported by 20 cal-
umns in two rows and 32 square pillars. The tent-pole shaped
columns (p. clxi) are unique, and indicate that the architect con-
ceived the central aisles as forming a huge festal tent. The pillars,
not so tall as the columns, were of the same height as the outer
walls and with the latter supported the pentagonal roofing slabs of
the lower side-aisles. At the same time they Were prolonged to the
same height as the columns by means of imposts and architrave, in
order to assist the columns in supporting the roof of the central
aisles. The reliefs on the pillars show Thutmosis m. in presence
of the gods. The hall contains several torsos of statues found there.

At the S.w. corner of the hall is the chamber (Pl. c) in which was
found the sto-called Knrnal: Table of the Kings, n list of the Egyptian mou-
archs from the earliest times down to the 18th Dyn. (transferred in 1813

to the Bibliothbque x tieme in Paris). The statues of the ancient kings
l procession by the priests were probably kept in

    

which were carried
this room. - On the N. side of the three central aisles lie three Chapels;
the one on the w. (P14) contains a colossal group ofTbatmosis in. between
Amen and Nut. - From the N.W. cnrner of the hall we pass through in!
nntechnmher (P s) into a nnrruw corridor, the N. side of which is adorn-
ed with tine i-eiicrs: Thutmusis m. offering incense to the ithyphallic
Amun; the king pouring water over Amnu, while on the right priests and
singing men and “-nmen apprnach; the king pouring water 011 MI altar
in presence of Amen and burning incense. From the me. angle of the
Festal Hall a flight of steps ascends within a tnwer-like structure to a
chamber which was perhaps used for astronomical purposes and still can-
mus an altar. - The rooms on the E. side of the Fests] Halt are in a
very rninnus condition. On the N.E. is in chamber with two pillars, and
adjoiaistg it lies a dilapidated chapel with a large granite altar. - The
central (Inn: in the E. aisle leads into three chambers, of which unly the
lawn part " the wnlls is now left. Adjoining, on the N., and reached by
steps, is ll smtt 1:00.“, with m mud supported Ity l clustered papyrus-
