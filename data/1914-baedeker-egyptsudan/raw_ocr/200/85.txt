III. El-Islzim.
By Pra/mar C. H. Becker.

The term mam is used to connote the peculiar civilization of

the Nearer East, which owes its characteristic features to the spread
of the Arabs and to the religion of Mohammed. However strange
and novel it may appear to us at first sight, it is nevertheless based
upon the. same general pvinciples as the civilization " mediawai
Europe, from which it (lifters mainly in being represented by other
peoples and other races7 to whom the brilliant intellectual develop-
ment of Europe has been denied.
5 The rise of EI-Ishtm has become historically intelligible only
within recent. years. Formerly it was tacitly assumed on all hands
that the Arabs had imposed upon the East not only a new language,
but also a new, speeifreally Arab, civilization. This view agreed
with Christian conceptions, which 1veognized in lslin1 only a new
religion and founded its opposition to Arab dominion on religions
and eeelesiastieal motives only. In Christian eyes Mohammed was
ideutiiied with Antichrist; he instigated his barbarian hordes to
hurl themselves upon the Christian countries of the East in order to
convert them to lslim by the sword; the uourse ofdevetopment since
antiquity was abruptly broken oifi and the Islamic Arab civilization
superseded its early-Christiau predecessor. When, with such pre-
conceptions as these, the Arabian historical sources were consulted,
they seemed at first to yield confirmation. The Arab tradition was as
Pcciesiestically coloured as the European; there/tood' starting-
point was Mohammed and the Arab migrations; Mohammed and
the early Caliphs were supposed to have reorganized everything
and to hare vmeteti, in all essentials, the new Islamic civilization.
As a matter of fact, the erroneousuess of all these current t'onccp-
lions cannot he too emphatically insisted on.

In the tlrst lilai'c it must be clearly understoorly1at the;trium-
phant campaigns of the Mohammedans were nothing else than an
Arab Migration, the latest and, for us, the most obvious of the great
Semitic migrations, 1bs0lntely analogous with the great migrations
of the Germanic peoples in Europe. The main difference between
the Am]! and the Germanicjmigrations is this, vis. that the Arabs,
owing to their religious organization, were directed by l central
authority, so that the establishment of a homogeneousislamie em-
pire became a possibility. â€˜It was not religious zeal, it was not
the fiery words of an inspired prophet that urged the Arabs on
their warlike mission to the outer world; simple necessity, the long
continued economic decline of Arabia, inga Word sheer hunger,
drove them into the rich lands of the settled countries. The moye-
ment had begun centuries before Mohammad. The tribes of Inner
Arabia were already on the move, a peaceful immigration of Arabs
into Mesopotamia and Syria had already begun, and the standing
