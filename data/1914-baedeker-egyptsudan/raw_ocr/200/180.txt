clxxiv VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART.

the Museum at Cairo (No. i51, rcli5, No.491, p.8r, No.56, p.85),
besides a few other specimens in European museums. In many
cases the artists have abandoned an attempt to produce a faithful
portrait in favour of ideal beauty, devoting much of their energy
to the representation of the isoiifure, the ornaments, and the ilowiug
garments then fashionable. Many new types were invented in this
period, such as the figure of a man crouching en the ground and
enveloped in a voluminous mantle.

After the 20th Dyn. art steadily declined until the time of the
Htl1iopia11 monarchs, when it again revived under the inspiration of
the models of the Ancient and Middle Empires. At last began a
later period of bloom, which has justly been styled the period ofthe
EGYPTIAN HENMSSANCE (p. W). The prevalent tendency at this
epoch was towards a careful study of portraiture, and it produced
some extraordinarily good work, espeoially in the 26th Dyn., in the
portraits of bald-headed priests, in which the characteristic points
(such as the shape of the skull) are indicated in a masterly mannel:
while the less sigr1itieant details are ignored. The best specimens
of this great style of art are new in Berlin, and with the exception
of the tine head of the aged Mentemhet (No.1084, p. 89) and a few
smaller statues there are unfortunately no examples of it in the
Cairo Museum, where the traveller will tind only insipid, sim-
periug productions of the Egyptian Renaissance. - Though these
realistic works show no trace of Greek influence, the development
of sculpture from the time of the Ptelemies on shows the iniiaenee
of Greek art in an ever-itrereasiug degree. Side by side with
purely Greek works (ehieiry in Alexandria) and purely Egyptian
works, the sculptors of which clung anxiously and mechanically to
the ancient style, we meet with specimens of a peculiar hybrid
(lrraeo-Egyptian style, in which the figures are Greek in attitude
and Egyptian in drapery, mitIure, and adornment, or vice versa'.
llawever valuable these may be for an appreciation) of Egyptian
civilization at a late period, they certainly carry no satisfaction to
the eye intent upon artistic eithets.

Beliefs and Paintings. Egyptian reliefs are either Bas-Reliefs,
the earliest and at all periods the commonest form, or Incised Beliefs
('reliefs en creuxâ€™), in which the design is sank below the surface.
This form, Which is peculiar to Egypt, first appears under the 4th
Dyn. and always setVes as a cheap substitute for bas-reliefs. The
sculptors of the New Empire, however, have often succeeded in
producing very attractive effects by the skilful use at" its peculi-
tvrities. Egyptian relief attained its highest point under the 5th
Uyn, (p. xcix). The high level of technical and artistic skill at
that period is best illustrated in the maetahas of Ti and Ptahhotep
" Sakhira (pp.149, 163], and in the reliefs from the mortuary
temples of the kings of the 5th Dyn. o. 82). Under the 6th Dyn.
and during the Middle Empire the execution of the reliefs hail
