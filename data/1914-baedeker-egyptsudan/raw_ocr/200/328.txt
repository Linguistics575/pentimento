118 Route 5. PETRII’IED FOREST. Environs

About IN paces ta the right, at the foot of the mountain-slope behind
the tombs ot the Caliphs, which we ascend on this side past some large
lime-kilns, we may trace the highvwater level of the sea in the pliaeene
age, 235fi. above the present sea-levrl, an a rocky face at the nnmmulite
plateau, thickly dotted over with hbles made hy boring shells.

Following the path to the right, we observe a yellowish hill at
the foot of the spurs of the Molgattam and reach it in 1/4 hr. more.
This hill stands at the mouth of the narrow, winding valley, 3/4 M.
in length, through which the path to the Spring of Moses ascends
over large blocks of stone and rubble. The ravine terminates in a
lofty amphitheatre of rock. Here is a cleft in the rock from which
trickle a few drops of bitter and brackish water, quite arbitrarily
named the Spring of Moses ('Ain Maw).

In order to reach the smaller Petrriied Forest we return to the
mouth of the gorge and proceed towards the S.E., skirting the
slopes of the Mohattam, which are here more precipitous. We first
yass a black praj ing rock, which has a glazed appearance, and
then a square gap in the rock, beyond which we observe opposite
to us gently sloping hills, consisting of limestone, mari, and heds
of fossil oysters. The route ascends between these hills and soon
reaches the plateau of the Gebel el-Khashab, where the scattered
fragments of fossil wood indicate the beginning of the Little Petri-
fed Forest. These trunks and fragments have been referred by
Unger to an extinct tree, which he named the Nicolia Egyptiaca
and regarded as akin to the homhacee. The petritaetior1 is now
generally supposed to have occurred during the later tertiary period
under the action of silicious geysers, resembling those to be seen to-
day in the Yellowstone Park of North America. The silicated trunks
lie in a secondary stratum, the overlying strata in which they were
originally embedded having disappeared in the course of the desert

denudation.

Urassing the plateau of the Petrified Forest for about 20 min. more
towards the 5.. we suddenly reach the s. slopes of the Mohattam, through
a gap in which a path descends into the dei et-TM, ur 'valley of wane
deriags' (more correctly det Diyla). This valley stretches to the W.
tnwards the valley of the Nile, and begins at the hills ur Jharah6n, like
the parallel Wiidi Hottp. 170), which dehuuches to the N. of f5elwiia.
Ch, the s. horizon rise the hills ofTura (p. 170), recognizable by the old
Mumeluke fortress on their right spur and by two heights exactly opposite
to us, ot‘which that to the left somewhat resembles a coffin in shape while
that to the right is hemispherical. Crossing the bottom of the valley in
this direction (S.), we perceive in he Tara bills the entrance to adesert
gorge, bounded by lofty and precipitous slopes. This valley extends for
many miles in various windings, communicates with the ravines of the
desert which begin in the Gebel Haf near aeiwah, and is abundantly
stocked with the plants peculiar to the desert.

We may return to Cairo from the Little Petrihed Forest through
the Wédi et-Tih (see above), skirting the S. and w. slopes of the
hIohattam and passing the Jewish cemetery and the tombs of the
Mamelukes. Another return-route leads across the Mokattam hills
If we choose the latter we quit the Petrified Forest by a hollow to th
W., and ascend over ridges to a plateau, stretching towards the W
