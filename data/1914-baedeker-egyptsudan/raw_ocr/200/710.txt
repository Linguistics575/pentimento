424 Route 33. RED SEA. From Sues

cuous summits of which are the serrated pyramid of the Gebet Serluil
(6759 ft.) and, to the 8., the sttgar-loaf of the Gebel Um-m Shémar
(8449 n.). At their base stretches the barren desert of Eb-Wa, follow-
ing the undulations of the coast-line and rising to the height of98-1ft.
In front of us lies the solitary little port of Fr or Tor(p.377), which
is a quarantine-station during the period of the Mecca pilgrimage. To
the N.W. of it lies a small grove of palms. Among the central I110ttn-
tains of Sinai we obtain a brief glimpse of the mbezmsa (7519 ft;
'Mountain of Moses'), the traditional Mount of the Covenant, and
of the hebel Kiiirer'in ($551 ft.) to the right of it. The Peninsula of
Sinai ends on the S. in the steep Rae Mohammad fob' n.). - The
coast on the right is fringed by a series of rocks and islets; on the
Ashraf Ree/ is an iron lighthouse (140 ft. high) with a revolving
light and on the rugged islet of Slu'iduws (1213 ft.) is n 11ash-light.

Passing through the Straits of Jubal, 4M. wide, the steamer
enters the Bed Sea, On the left we have a view up the Gulfof
’Ahaba, through w ich the Enthrman depression is continued to the
N. towards the Syrian depression (Dead Sea, Valley of the Jordan).
We nowlose sight of the coast on both sides. Excluding the gulfs
at its N. end the Red Sea is 1030 nautical miles in length, 120 to
190 nautical miles in breadth, and has a maximum depth of 7740 ft.
The name dates from antiquity and is supposed to have some con-
nection with the tribes of the Homerltes ('the red’). The sultry cli-
mate, which is rendered more oppressive by the extreme moisture of
the atmosphere due to evaporation, is notorious. In August the tem- _
perature frequently rises to above 104° Fahr. in the shade, when
suustroke is to be guarded against; but (hiring the travelling-season
(Oct.-May) the heat is often so modified in the N. part of the sea by
the prevailing N. winds that travellers returning from the tropiiw
run the risk of taking cold. During this season a strong S. wind
usually blows in the s. part of the sea, rendering the outward journey
at least endurahle. In any case, in winter the steamer is seldom
more than one or two days within the zone of extreme heat.

There are several islands and islets in the N. part of the Red Sea.
About 80 nautical miles from Shadwin (see above) lie the Brothers,
two low coral islands, with a lighthouse ff)? ft. high) whose light is
visible for 12msatiiat miles; and about 100 nautical miles farther
S. is the once dreaded l'aedalus Shoal, a submarine coral reef, now
marked by a lighthouse (59 ft. high), with a light visible for14 nauti-
cal miles. Beyond that point the steamer's course is free of islands
for more than b'50 nautical miles. At about lat. 22 we descry on
the Egyptian coast the Gebel Soterba or Gebel Ten (7280 "
while on the Arabian toast (at a distance from our route) lies Jidda
nr Jeddah (20,000 inhab.), the harbour for Mecca, which lies 50 M.
inland. About 40-60,000 Mecca pilgrims land annually at Jidda,
on their way to the birthplace of the Prophet (urmp. p. lxxxviti).

As we enter the harbour of Port Sudan several lighthouses and
