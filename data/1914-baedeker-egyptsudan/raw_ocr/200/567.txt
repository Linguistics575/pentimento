5. Deir et-Bal/ri. THEBES (w. BANK). 20. Route. 299

5. From Blbin el-Mulak to Deir el-Bahri and El-Asasif.

To return from Bihfm el-Mumk to the plain we should lake the manu-
tain-pnth via Deir el-Balm. it is possible to ride to the top of the hill,
but walking all the way is preferable. - Another very pleasant route leads
from Bibin nl-ilumk up the steep hill (And than, above Shaikh ‘Ahrl el-
iturna, descends to Deir eHledineh (p. 31(5). - The morning erlate after»
noon is the best time to visit the temple of Deir vl-Buhri, for during the
hetler hem of the Jay the oppressive rays of the sun m reilectM from
lie rocks here with peculiar intensity.

The path begins " Tomb 16, ascends the hill separating Wibin
el-5luliik from Deir el-Balm" and El-Asasif, and descends in zigzNys.
It is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in 'h hr. The
* View is most remarkable: first we look into the desolate valley of
the Tombs of the Kings; then, from the summit and as we descend,
we see the peculiarly shaped ravine of Deir el-llahri, the steep
_ projecting mountain-side with its tombs and buildings old and new,
I and the rich green of the fertile plain below, spread out on both

sides of the Nile, with its groups of palms and gigantic temples,
as tar as Karnak and Luxor on the R. bank. The situation of the
temple of Deir el-Barri is remarkably tine; on the W. and N. it is
framed by precipitous rocks of e light-brown and golden colour,
against which the dazzling white walls of the temple stand out in
rnagniMertt relief. - Below the temple lies a rest-house open only
to Cook’s tourists and to patrons of the hotels of the Upper Egypt
Hotel Company (pt Mt).

The great Temple of Deir el-Bahri was huilt and adorned with
reliefs and inscriptions by Queen Hatshepsut, the sister, wife, and
"o-regent ofThutmosis m. Like the sanctuary of the 11th Dynasty
(p. 30-1) lying to the s. of it, it is constructed in terraces. The com
struction of the temple shared the chequered fortunes of its found-
ress (p. cii). When Ilatshepsut was expelled from the throne by
her brother and husband, after a brief reign, the building operations
came to a halt, and Thutmosis caused the names and tigare of his
sister to he obliterated in all the tinished sculptures and inscriptions
at Deir el-Balm' as well as elsewhere throughout the country.
Thutmosis 11 who succeeded his brother, continued the work of
destruction by inserting his own name in place of that orHatshepsut.
When T'hutrnosis II. died, however, Hatshepsut regained the throne
and the building was resumed. Operations were not carried on
with any remarkable aeiivity, for when the queen's long reign came
to an end the temple was still urrtjished. Thutmosis 111., once
more on the throne, so far from supplying what was still wanting,
resumed his former tactics, destroying all allusions to his sister
and sometimes inserting his own name and figure in place of hers.
Amenophis IV. (p.211) carefully destroyed all reference to Amen,
and the inscriptions and reliefs were left thus mutilated until the
reign of Ramses IL, who restored them, though with inferior work-
manship. For centuries afterwards the temple remained unaltered;
but under Euergetes IL a few slight restorations were undertaken
