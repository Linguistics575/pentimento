d. Geology of Egypt.

I. Tue NILE VALLEY AND THE ISTHMUS or' Suez. The building
stone generally used at Alexandria is obtained from the quarries ot
Meks (p. 26) and on the coast to the E. of Alexandria. This is a
calcareous Iight-tsol-ed stone " the quaternary period, formed of
fragments of shells and forarninifera, intermixed with oiilitie granules
and grains of quartz sand, or even with tine gravel. This took forms
low bills to the W. of Alexandria and the coast-strip from Alexan-
dria to Ahulitr. In many places it is covered by sanll-dunes and
other recent formations.

The cultivated plains of the Delta and the Nile Valley consist
of recent alluvial deposits, ranging from flue sand to the finest silt,
laid down by the water of the annual inundation Under these lie
coarser yellowish sands and gravels of pleistoecne age, which here
and there n-ach thu suriaee in the Delta as islands of sandy waste
among the rich cultivation of the surrounding eouutry. These are re-
lated to the later Sun :1 and gravel deposits on the neighbouring d eserts,
and to the traros of marine cliffs and beaches of the same periml
which may be seen on both sides of the valley at Cairo and at other
places. At Ahu Zarbal (p. 120), to the NE. of Nawa, oceurs a low
hill of basalt Which supplies exr-ollent road-metal for Cairo and
Alexandria,

The N. portion of the Isthmus of8uer, consists of the recent marine
4eposits of the Mediterranean, while in the central portion, near the
low hill of El-Gisr and round Lake Timstli, are deposits of the Nile
mud with fresh-water shells. To the S. of the Bitter Lakes are found
marine quaternary deposits of the Red Sea.

Reefs of fossil coral of quaternaxy age occur over a large part of
the coasts of the Gulf of Suez, and the highest of these are now
1000 ft. above the present sea-level, while five or six others occur
at lowerlevels. The land hm, or at least the aoasthue, must thero-
fore have risen rorvsitlerably in comparatively recent times, and the
salines whivh are now forming appear to show that the movement
has not yet ceased. The shores and islands of the Red Sea are to-
day fringed with coral reefs which are most dangerous to shipping.

Sands and loams mom to the S. of the pyramids of Gizeh, and
at numerous glaees on the E. side of the Nile valley between Cairo
andFeshn, belonging, as is shown by the numerousfossils Which they
noutnin, to the plioeene age. The small valley immediately to the
S. of the pyramids of Zéwiyet el-‘Aryén has been cut out in these
beds, and a rich collertinn of pliocene fossils may he made here.
These deposits are intimately connected with the formation of the
present valley in plioeene times, when it Was at first a fiord into
which the waters of the Mediterranean flowed at least as far as Keneh
and perhaps even as far as Esneh. In the time of the older miocene
sea the Nile valley did not exist, but instead a large river flowed
from a S.W. direction towards the region that is now Lower Egypt.
