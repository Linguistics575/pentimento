whence the Greek name 1leliopolis) and the hnmnn-headed Atum, to
whom the sacred :luevis Butt was consecrated. To these was dedicated the
famous temple, 'the House of Re', built on the site of an earlier edifice
by Ammemnzt f., iicst king of the 12th Hyn., in front of which bis son
and successor 8esostris l. erected two great obelisks (see below) in
celebration or an important anniversary A large section of the Egyp-
tian religious literature was due to the priests of Ileliopotis, and their
doctrines were widely disseminated throughout the country at a very
early period, so that Itrrrlariskhte was one or the most highly venerated
deities in Egypt. - Even during the Greek period these priests enjoyed
a high reputation for wisdom; Herodotus converged with them and Pluto
is said to have spent thirteen years with them, in order tu learn some
at least of their doctrines. - Under the New Empire the temple of
Iieliopolis was the largest and most richly endowed in all Egypt, next to
the temple of Amen at Thebes. - When straho (b. about 0013.0.) visited
Egypt the city bad been destroyed, but the temple was Mill intact, ex-
cept for some minor injuries attributed to Camltyses; even the houses ot'
the priests and the apartments of Plato and his Friend Eudoxus Were
shown to the traveller. The priestly school, however, had ceased to exist,
nnd only a few oflieiUirvg priests and guides for foreigners resided there.

The outer walls, rising in all directions from the fields, are
now the only vestiges of the city, while of the temple nothing is
left but a few scanty ruins and a solitary Obelirl: (Arab. El-Misulla).
The latter is of red granite of Syene CAssuin, p. 354) and is (56 tr.
high. It is surrounded by ll wooden fence and rises picturesquely
amid mulberry-trees. Each of the four sides bears the same inserip-
tion in bold hieroglyphics, recording that Sesostris I. (Semvosret),
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the
sun, whom the (divine) spirits oiOn Uleliopolis) love, etc., founded
the obelisk on the first festival ofSet (a kind ofjubilee celebration).
The pyramidium at the top and the falcons which begin the inscrip-
tions on each side were once covered with metal. The companion
obelisk (for these monuments were always erected in pairs) stood
down to the 12th century.

To the W. of the obelisk the remains of the temple may be recog-
nized in a. few blocks of granite, hearing inscriptions by Ramses ll, On
one Ramses Ir. appears offering a libutiun to Atnm. _ The Necropolx': of
Iretioyous lies about 3 M. to the E. of the obelisk.
