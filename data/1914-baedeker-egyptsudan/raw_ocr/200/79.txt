Seasons. POLITICAL NOTES. lxxiii

3. AGRICULTUIIAI. Siihsoxs. In the time of the Pharaohs the
Egyptian agricultural year, which originally began on July 19th,
was divided into three equal parts, each consisting of four months
of 30 days; the period of the inundation, winter, and summer. At
the present day there are, strictly speaking, but two seasons: the
hot season lasting from May to September and a cooler one from
November to March, while October and April are intermediate
months; but the eiriust which the annual Nile Mot1 has upon the
agriculture of the country rather than upon the rlimate has caused
the period from July to October to he considered as a third season.

(a) The Winter Cultivation, or 'Esh-Shituu", lasts on the [leaded
lands of Upper Egypt from November till April; on perennially
irrigated land the winter-sewing takes place from October onwards,
while the grain-harvest is reaped in April in Middle Egypt and in
May in the Delta. In this season the principal crops are wheat,
barley, beans. and harsim (clover).

(b) The Summer Crops (E?- 'ieiN may be considered as growing
horn May to August in the basia-lauds and to October wherever
tirere is perennial irrigation. The principal crops are rice, which is
sown in May and harvested in October, and cotton, sown in Marrh
and picked in September and October. Most of the latter is grown
from seed, but a limited amount is grown from two-year-old plants
which hare been cut bark. On basin-lands of Upper Egypt where
tn1ftieient water from wells is available a crop of duna (millet is
grown and harvested before the i1ood-wate: arrives.

(e) The Autumn Season ('Ea-iyil', or flood) is the shortest,
lasting barely seventy days. On the rich land of the Delta maize is
grown. A large crop of ilurra is raised on the perennially irrigated
lands of Upper Egypt, and a considerable amount also grown on
those which are non loathed by tlseinundation. This crop is cut
about November.

The AGRICULTURAL hwmuzx'ls of the igyptiihns are exceedingly
primitive and defective. The ehiei ni these is the plough (mizmit), the
