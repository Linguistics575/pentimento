Royal Mummies.

Towards the close of the New Emph-ethe power of the Egyptian state was
no longer in a position to protect even thelast resting-places ot' the dead.
Not only the aeeropolis at Drab Abu'l Negga (p 283), but even the secluded
tombs in the 'Valley of Kings' (p. 28d) were plaudered. The authorities
eouteated themselves with rescuing the mummies of the ancient Pharaohs.
Thus the bodies of nine kings were walled up in a sidemhamher of the
tomb of Amcutnphis 11. Fur the same reason the mummy ornamses ll. wax
trar1sferred tram its tomb at Bibrm el-Mal" (p. 287) m that of Sethos L,
and when that refuge ceased to be deemed secure it was removed to the
tomb of Amcnephis i. ally, under the 2tst Dyn., it was resolved to
prolctt the royal mummies from further prufarsation by iuturring them all
togetht-r in a, rockycleft um Deir el-Buyri (p. 305;, whieh was artificially
widened for tho purpose. The corpses of the ruling dynasty also were
pieced here. Thus at last thu remains of the great monarchs of the New
Empire - Amnsis 1., Thutmm sul., Sethos I., and Ramses II. - Were lel't
in peace until in 1875 the tclhthiu once more discovered their secret resting-
place and the plundering of the mummies began again. In 1881 the modern
thieves were traced and theirfinds secured for preservation in the museum
at Cairo. Itwas not tin [898 that Loret discovered the group or mummies
in the to b or Amenophis 11.: and these were transferred tn the Museum
in 1901. Other mm (nmt-s for 'lhutmosis and II,) itave since been
