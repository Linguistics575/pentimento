132 Routsti. PYRAMIDS 0F sizsu. Second Pyramid.

E. side of the plateau was artiiieiauy extended by a terriuuy-wall of
enormous blocks of stone. To the E. lies the Mortuary Temple, the
various chambers of which may be distinctly traced in spite of its
ruinous condition. Like all these pyramid temples it consisted of
two distinct principal portions, the public temple and the reserved
sanctuary. The main chamber ofthe public temple was a large open
court, surrounded by a passage like the eloistera of a medieval Worr-
astery and embellished with colossal statues of the king. This
was the scene of the great funeral festivals. The Causeway ascending
to it from the valley, the monumental entrance to which was formed
by the so-allied 'Granite Temple' (p. 135), is still traceable. To
the s., within the wall that surrounded this pyramid, stood another
small pyramid, now almost level with the ground, in which the
queen was buried. - The iucrustation of the Second Pyramid, of
wl1iiyl1 a considerable part still remains at the top, consisted of
limestone slabs in the upper courses and of partially unpolished
granite slabs in the two lower (well preserved on the W. side).

 

The merit of having opened this pyramid belongs to Bdsoni (p. 126).
An inscription over the entrance records that the opening took
place 011 March 2nd, 1818.

The plan of the Second Pyramid also appears to have been altered
in the course of building The original intention seems to have been to
erect a small pyramid Over the subterranean chamber, Afterwards a larger
pyramid was decided upon and the chamber moved towards the s., to
its present position.
