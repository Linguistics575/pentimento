The Birket Karim, lie. 'lake of Ken‘m’ (the Hebrew Korah), is
the Lake Mani: of the Greeks (comp. p. 190). It measures 25 M. in
length and, at its broadest part, is barely GM. wide. At the ferry
to Dimei the depth is not above 16 ft., but it is said to increase
towards the SW. The greenish water is slightly brackish and is not
tit for drinking. The N. bank is sterile, but on the S. the cultivated
land often reaches as far as the lake. The right of fishing is let by
government, and the whole of the flshevmea on the lake are in the
service of the lessee. Water-fowl are sometimes abundant but are
far too shy to be apyroaehed within gunshot.

The lake is crossed with a favourable wind in about 2 hrs. To
the E. appears a considerable peninsula, with rubbish-heaps. In
the lake lies the large island called acme: et-rurn, or “island of
the horn'. On the N. bank of the lake are barren hills of considerable
height. From the Muding-plaee a somewhat steep path ascends to
the (13/4 M.) ruins and temple of -

Dimei (Dimuy). The fortified position of this town, named in
antiquity 8oknopaiou Nam, Le. 'island of 8okuopaiost (a form of
Hohek, the Faiythn deity), provided a secure point of departure
