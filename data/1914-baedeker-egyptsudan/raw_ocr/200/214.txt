with the Museum was the famous Alexandria» Library. which contained
400,000 scrolls as early as the reign of Ptolemyu. Philadelphns. while in
Caesars time, when it was burned, the number haul risen to about 900,000.
The library lay to the N. of the Museum, near the harbour. Apart from the
revenues oujoyed by the Museum in its corporate capacity, a yearly sultry
was paid to each of the members, whose number in the time of the mat
I’tnlemies has been estimated at nne hundred at least.

The Sempeum (Greek Sarapaian]. or great temple of Sempis, whose
worship was introduced by the Ptolcmies, was situated on the hill on
which stands Pompey‘s Pillar (11.16).

In 69 A.D. Vespuian was proclaimed emperor by the Alexan-
driaus, his recognition having been to a great extent due to the
influence of the philosophers then resident at the Museum. In
Traian's reign [98-117] the Jews, who constituted one-third of
the whole population, caused sauguinary riots. ffadrinn (f17-138),
who visited the city in 130, held public disputations with the pro-
fessors at the Museum. Marcus Aurelius (161-180) attended the
lectures of the grammariatrs Athenians, Ilupocration, IIephaestioit,
Julius Pollux, and others. Lucian also lived at Alexandria at this
period, in the capacity of secretary to the prefeet of Egypt, In
195) Seplimius Severus (193-211) visited Alexandria and established
a municipal constitution. A disastrous visit Was that of Curaaullu
(21l-2i7), who revengcd himself for the derision of the citizens
by a bloody massacre and also caused the academy to be closed.
Still more disastrous were the contests between the Palmyrenes and
the 1rnperialisrs (p. cu), in which a large part of the population was
swept away by the sword, pestilence, and famine.

Christianity early found its Way to Alesatrilria. According to
tradition the Gospel was first preached to the Aloxandriars by St.
Mark (whose bones wore removed to Venice in 820). The first
great persecution of the Christians, which took place in the reign
of Dccius [250), was a terrible blow to the Alexamlriaus. The city
had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and had
since 100 possessed a theological school, presided over by l‘antmnns
and Clement ofAicxandria (beginning of 3rd cent), who endeavour-
ed to combine Christianity uith the Neo-Platonism which sprang
up about this period at Alexandria and was taught by Ammonius
Saecas, Herennius, Piotinus (p. 233), Porphyrius, Iamblichus, and
others, A second persecution took place in 257, during the reign of
Valerian,- and shortly afterwards, in the reign of Gallienua, the
plague carried off a largn portion of the population. Alexa dria,
however, still continued to be regarded as the chief seat of Christian
emditiou and of the orthodox faith (Athanasiau Creed), until it
was eventually obliged to yield to 00r1stantinople its proud posi-
tion as the centre of Greeh thought and science. Sanguinary quar-
relsitook place between the Athanasian party and the Asians under
their unworthy bishop Georgius. On the accession of Julian the
Apostate [361-363) the pagans of Alexandria again instituted a
persecution of the Christians. In the reign of Theodosius (370-3W5),
