176 Route JO. DAMIETTA.

LevantiuesJ. The industries to which the town owed its former
prosperity still exist to some extent. There are, for instance, several
cotton mills and silk factories, the latter of which produce the Mach
silk ot' the ‘hahttra' worn by Moslem women (comp. p. 47].

“IS'KUKY. Little or nothing is known of the early history of Damiettu.
During the Arabian em Dtmiettt attained a great reputation on account
of the resistance it otiUed to the Crusaders; but the town of tlmtperiud
stood further to the N. then its modern successor (see below). In 1218 it
was besieged by King John of Jerusalem With the aid of en ingenious
donhle boat, constructed and fortified in accordance with a design by
unverius, an engineer of Cologne, the Frisians, Germans, and others
m’ the hesiegers succeeded "ten, a tiglst of twsnty-tire hours in capturing
the tower to which the chain stretched across the river was attached.
The success of the Christians was, however, considerably mutter] hy the
interference of the ambitious though energetic Pelagius Guquni. the
papal legete, and by the vigilance of the Egyptian sultan Malilcel-Kimil.
At length, after various vi issitudcs. the Christians captured the place.
They obtained veluehx-e spoil, sum the surviving townspeople as slaves.
tusd converted the mosques into churches, but in 1221 they were compelled
II)! a treaty to evacuate the town. In 1239, When Louis Ix. hunted near
Ihuuietta, it was abandoned by its inhabilunls. Without striking a blow
the Crusaders marched into the deserted streets of the fortress, hntih the
course of the following year they were obliged to restore it to the Semeehs
as part or the ransom of Louis IN., who hed heen taken prisoner at Mamyirir
[p.173]. During the same year, by a resolution of the Emirs, the, town was
destroyed, and was re-erected oh the E. htnh ofthe river, farthertn the s.
The new town soon became an important manufacturing and commer-
cial place. Its staple products were leather-wares, cloth, and oil ofsesame,
for Which it was famous, and its harbour Was visited by ships of many
diirereut nations. Owing to the construction of the Jlalymidiyel' Cane]
Ilamietta lost most of its trade. which, huwever, is tlow on the increase,
ehieitlgé owing to the export of iish (especially eels) from Lake Menzaleh
(p. ).

Seen from the railway station Damietta still presents an im-
posing appearance, with its lofty houses flanking the river; but this
by no means corresponds with the interior of the town, where the
buildings are mostly humble brick erections. The European iluar-
ter lies upstream, with the spacious Government Hospital and the
Coastyords' Banach. Here is also the principal Mosque Nstrriir
el-Bahr), with two lofty miharets and a spacious dome. Connected
with it is at university (223 students, 46 professors). In the vicinity
are a Roman Catholic and a Greek church. Close to the river stands
the mosque of Fy-Matbultyeh, founded by Sultan I.Git Bey in 1470
along with its institute (Asltra/7yelsl The principal street, upwards
of 1 Wlotlg, forms the busy bazaar of the town. Many of the houses
are provided with handsomely carved wooden jutties and lattice-
work, which are in most cases very ancient and differ materially
in style from the mashrahiyehs of Cairo.

To the N. of the town, in the suburb of El-Gabt‘melt, ls the
dilapidated mosque of Abu't Mu’dteh. The building appears to date
from the period of the old town of Demietta and has Cn1iie inscrip-

two of which, standing on the same base, offer a test of honesty,
like those in the Mosque ofAmt at Cairo(p.110). Another column
