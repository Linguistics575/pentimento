0n the S. side nl' the Pyramid of Onnos are three Stun 'l'oyuss
OF THE l‘ERsIAN Favocrr, all of similar arrangement. A vertical
square shaft descends to a chamber constructed of hloeks ot' stone,
at the bottom of a larger shaft sunk for the purposes of construction
and then again filled in. These tombs are now accessible bya spiral
staircase and are connected with each other by tunnels.

The descent is somewhat tuilsume, The shaft, 72 rt, deep, leads
vit a corridor 18 it. long to the vaulted (mub-uhamber or the physi uh
Pmmtik, a contempurary or Darius 1. The walls are decorated with re-
ligions 'u1seciptions. The lid Hi the large limestone twrtin is raised and l
the arrangement for lowering it is plainly visible This eotfiu contained 1
a smaller one of basalt and. like those in the t 'u other tombs, is let into
the Mor, - Tn the w. is a modern tunnel, leading to the tonsb-slustt and
sarcophagrus-ctsamher of the royal admiral Zenbebu (comp. p,99), which cun-
lnins some beautifully curved inscription --Towrrrds the wo, descend
by steps to the shaft (SS rt. deep) and the Chamber of Pete/era, The walls',
are decorated with inscrip ions in ilue, low relief, the colouring of which
is well preserved, and with representations orsacrilicia1 gifts, The vaultedv
roof is Covered with coloured stars upon a white ground.

 

 

If time permit the traveller may now proceed to the S. Pyramids,
of W.k.kr'ira, a ride of w, hr. to the S. from Mariette’s llouse. We'
pass near a piece of ground about 440 yds. square, enclosed byi
hroad and massive, but now very dilapidated walls on the E., N., I
and W. sides, while the S. side is bounded by the natural hills of
the desert. The route leads thence straight to the Magtabat el-Fam’én,
the most interesting monument in the S. group, To the left are
the dilapidated Pyramids of Phipps 1. and Merenr? and a pyramid
called by the Arabs Et-Hmam esh-Showwéf'. On the N.W. (r.) side
of the Magtabat el-Firva'tm is the Pyramid of Pliiopa fr. All these
pyramids (now inaccessible.) are constructed antl adorned exactly in
the same manner as that of King Dunes (p. Iwi). The Mayfabtzt el-
FaraTm resembles in its shape some of the zuagtabas of the Middle
Empire. The passages in the interior resemble those in the pyr-
amids of ouuos and his successors, so that this monument may
probably enough be a king‘s grave, as its name implies ('grave
of Pharaoh'). The top, which is easily reached, Commands a
ilue view.

About 11/: M. to the 5. o? the 11astabat el-Farar6n lie the Necrnpolis and
Pyramids of Dahslutr. Here rise two large pyram'ulsand a smaller one of
limestone and two of brick (El-Ahrdm es-Wd, the ‘Blauk Pyramids'), together
with remains of others, all of Which are at W considerable distance from
each other. The N. Brick Pyramid, which was once covered with subs of
stone, is probably the tomb of King Sesostris m. (12th Dyno. The length
of the side at the base is 34; ft., while the height is now only aboutNrt,
To the N. of this pyramid, hut within the girdle-wall that formerly au<
closed it, are two subterranean galleries with tomb-chambers in Which
female members of the royal family were interred. The jewels round
here are now in the Cairo Museum (p. 97).

To the S.W. of the N. Brink Pyramid lies a larger Slam: Pyramid.
This is still 3 ft in height and 709 ft. in width, being nearly its large
as the Great lynt Did or Gimeh (p. 127), wt in its solitude presents a
my imposing appearance. Like the Pyramid orNeidhn (p. 205) it was
huilt h . snMru, and is thus the Inns! ancient royal tomb in the form of
a Ivyriuuid.
