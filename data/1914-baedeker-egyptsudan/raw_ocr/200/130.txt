pearauce before Alexandria. In the middle ofJuuc serious
disturbances broke out in that town, in the course ofwhich
many Europeans were killed, while the others found re-
fuge an board the ships. On July 11th and 12thAlexirndrs
was bombarded by the British fleet, and on Sept.13th
the fortiiled camp of Arabi at Tell el-Rem o. 181) was
stormed by a British force under Sir Garnet Wolseley.
Arahi and his associates were captured and sent as exiles to
Ceylon. Since then British influence has been paramount
in Egypt. Arabi, who had been released and pensioncd
in 1901, died at Cairo in 1011.

In 1883 Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer) Ire-
came British diplomatic agent and eonsu[-geueral in
Egypt. In his hands lay the control of liritish policy in that
country and he has Won high distinction as one of the
makers of modem Egypt. In the autumn of the same
year a widespread rebellion broke out among the Nubian
tribes of the b'r1ilin under the leadership of Mohammad
Ahmed, the su-called 'Mahdi' (p. xci), which proved fatal
to the Egyptian supremacy in the bidin. An Egyptian
force of 10,000 men under an Englishman named llirks
Pasha was annihilated in Nov., 1883, by the Mahdi’s for-
ces (comp. p. 433), and a second expedition of 3500 re-
gular troops of the Egyptian army, led by Baker Pasha,
was likewise vanquished at Tokar in February, 1884. Un
the 18th of the same month General Gordan, who had
been Governor General of the Stvdéu in 1877-70, after a
perilous ride across the desert, entered Khartfml. which
he had undertaken to save from the Mahdi; while on
Jan. 29th and March 13th the rebels under the Mahdi’s
lieutenant Osman Digna were defeated at Et- Teh and
Tunui'i by the British under Graham. The Mahdi him-
self, however, still maintained his position near Kharttun,
and towards the cioscpf the year a second British expe-
dition (of 7000 men) was sent out under Wolseley to
rescue Gordon.

Wolseley selected the tedious and laborious Nile route for
this expedition in preference to the shorter but more dan-
gerous desert route from Suikia to Berber. An advanced
brigade under General Stewart Was, however, sent on from
Korti at the beginning of 1885, which accomplished its
march across the Bayada Desert with complete success,
gaining severely contested victories over large bodies
of the Mahdi's followers at Abu Ktea (Jan. 17th) and at
AI/u Khrity, near Metemmeh (Jim. 10th), Stewart, how-
ever, was mortallywounded at the latter engagement. The
British reached the Nile at Gubat, just above Mcteav,
