built ou a bridge over the Baltr i'1tsuf(p. 190), has an ancient portal,
with bronze-mounted doors. The interior has been restored. At
the W. and of the town the Baht Yt1suf radiates through sluices
into numerous branches. .

To the N. of the town, and intersected by the railway to Aluiksa
(see below), are the mhhish- mounds known as szun hiris, or
riders hills', eaveriug an axea of 560 acres and rising to the height
of 65 ft. These mark the site of ilroeodi1opolis- Arainoii, the most
extensive remains of any old Egyptian town.

The "su1eientEgrptian name of this town was Slum. It was the centre
of the worship of the urocorlile-heerlud water-gnd Sabzk (the Greek Such"),
under whose protection the entire lake-land stood. The crocodile was
sacred to Sobck, and the Greeks therefore named the city WocodutrpoO
or 'erocodi1rtowu'. It never attained to any political importance. Pini-
cmy H. Philadelphns seems lo have cnnverted it into au essentially
Hellenic city by adding new quarters, founding Greek temples and educa-
tienel institutions, and introducing the Greek language. This mnnm-t-h
also raised Queen Arsinn'c t0 the dignity of patron-goddess, and the district
became known as the ‘Avsinoite Nomu' aad the capital as the 'City of
the dwellers in the Arsinmtc Nome', or, mum brriehly, " Arsz‘rml. At the.
time of its greatest prosperity it had over 100,000 inhabitants.

In the midst of the ruins rises a mound of rubbish known as
K6111 Paris (65 ft. high). The top commands .1 wide survey of the
modern town, the ruins of the ancient city, and the whole Ihriyrhn,
with the pyramids ofmahiln and 1.Tawira to the S.E. The rubbish-
heaps have recently been much diminished by briek-buraers and
diggers for sahakh (p.1xxi). - During the last quarter of the 19th
nent. important discoveries of papyri were made here, especially in
the mound known as JOm el-Kharydnu. Most of these papyri are
now in the late Archduke Rainer's collection in Vienna, while others
are in the museums of London, Berlin, and other towns, They are
ehiefly Greek business-doeuments (rerords, receipts, letters, etc.),
but some literary specimens also have been found, containing frag-
ments from Homer, Euripides, Thucydides, etc.

The best-preserved section of the ruins is that to the N., which
in Prof. Sehweinfurth's words, 'to this day produces the impression
of a city but recently destroyed. The walls of the houses still stand
far and wide, but the narrow interlacing lanes, bewildering in their
ramitieations and interrupted by countless trenches and holes in
the ground, render it impossible to obtain any clear idea of the
general plan'. On the extreme N. edge of the ruins, near the farm
of rEzbet 1'arkhtt Effendi, are it few blocks of limestone marking
the site of the principal ancient temple, which was dedicated to
Sohek. This existed as early as the 12th Dyn. and was afterwards
rebuilt hy Ramses ll. Beside the temple lay originally the sacred
pond in which the crocodile of Sobek was kept.
