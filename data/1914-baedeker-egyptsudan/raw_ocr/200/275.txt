to the S. of the rShirir Mohammed 'Ali. In the Shari’ el-Wlmtyeb,
on the left, is the Monastery of the Mwlwis ('Derviehes tourr1eurs';
Pl. D, 6), an order of dancing dervishes (p. xcii), whose 'tikr'
(eornp. p. xci) may be witnessed on Frid. afternoons at two o’clock
(previous application through a dragoman necessary). At the inter-
section of the Shirir SiyMiyeh and the Shirir es-elalibeh is the rich
and effective marble Sebfl ofthe Mother oCAbbts J. (P1. D, 6). To
the left, in the Sh"arir 8hekhtih (leading to the Place Saladin), is
the thirru" 8hekh0h, built by the emir of that name (1350-55), and
opposite, en the S. side of the street, is the thinlcrih or Convent of
Shekhah, occupied by dervishes of the Kadiriyeh Order (p. xvii). -
We continue to follow the Sharir er-Rukbtyirh and turn down the
SHAW IBN Turstm to the right, in which, after about 100 yds. more,
we ebserve on the right a lane leading to the E. entrance of the

'Namir Ibn Tnlun (PI. D, 7; also pronounced TaMn). This
mosque, the oldest in Cairo but one, was erected in 876-879 by
Ahmed ibn Tuliln, the founder of the dynasty of the Tulunides
(p. cxiv). It lies in the quarter of Karat cl-Kabsh, on a hill named
Gebel Yeshklir, and oeoupies an area of 30,720 sq. yds., 20,320
of which are taken up by the mosque proper. The edifice is said
to have been designed in imitation of the Kaaha at Mecca, bat
without columns, by a Christian prisoner, who, in return for his
release, constructed the whole of the building of entirely new
materials (th not taken from other buildings). The walls consist
of brick, coated with stucco. The older part of the ornamentation,
which is in carved (not moulded) stucco and wood, exhibits none
of the intricate forms of the Byzantine-Arabian style, which appear
in the later restorations. At a later period the mosque was used
as a magazine and as an asylum for aged men, which explains the
addition visible in the N.W. liwtrn, below the minaret.

From the main entrance (Pl. i,p.72) we pass through the Emma:
court to the Chief Liwtm (PI. 4) or sanctuary, and thence proceed
to the inner quadrangle or Sal”; el-(h1mi', 99 yds. square. With the
exception of the ceilings, most of which have been restored, the
building has been preserved almost intact, though its 11tting up has
been frequently altered. The most important renovations were carried
out by Légin, afterwards Sultan Fal-5lans.stu. It was he who erected
the mansoleum-like Dome (P1. 6) in the centre of the court, covering
an octagonal basin, on the site of an older hall which was destroyed
by tire. The court is surrounded by a double arcade, except on the
sanctuary side, where the arcade is quadruple, while a Mth row
of arches oollapset1 in 1875. Pointed openings above the pillars
lighten the weight of the masonry, and the facades are crowned by
a medallion-frieze and opert-work halustrades. The pillars are of
plastered brick and have their comers rounded into quarter col-
umns, with delicately ornamented capitals. The pointed arches
