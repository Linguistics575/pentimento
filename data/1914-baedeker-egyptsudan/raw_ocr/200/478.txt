238 mm 18. ABYDOS. Temple

The most important part of ancient Abydus was its extensive
Neerupolis, situated in the desert. Four distinct sections are ciearly
traceable. la the southernmost, heside El-‘Aréba o. 237), are tombs
of the New Empire and the temples of Sethos and Ramses. To the
N. of this rises a hill, with graves dating from the close of the Au..
cieut Empire. Still farther to the N., between the sanctuary of Osiris
(Khn es-Sultitn) and the tomb of b'htmet ez-Zebib (p. 243), are
the tombs of the Middle Empire, many in the form of small brick
pyramids. Here are found also graves of the 18-20th Dyn. and o?
the later period. Finally, in the hill of Umm el-Ga‘ih (p. 243), to
the W., are the tombs of the kings of the earliest dynasties and
the sacred grave of Osiris, - The chief centre of interest is the -

*Temple of Sethos L, the Memnonium of Strabo. This wou-
derful strueture, built by Sethns I. and completed hyRamses11., was
almost completely excavated in 1859 by Mariette, at the expense
of the viceruy Sa'id. The walls nonsm of tine-grained limestone,
while a harder variety has been selected for the columns, arrhi-
traves, Joor-posts, and other burden-bearing portions. The Relief:
dating from the reign of Sethos 1. are among the finest productions
of Egyptian sculpture of any age.

The gronud-plau diiRyrs materially from that of other great
Egyptian temples. Instead of one sanctuary it has seven, dedicated
to Osiris, Isis, Horus, Ptah, Harakhte, Amon, and the deriied
king; and as each of these had a special cult the entire front por-
tion uf the temple is divided into seven parts, each with its separate
gateway and portals. The chambers behind the sanctuaries are not
arranged behind each other as in other temples, but side by side.
Another remarkable peculiarity consists in the wing (p.2M) eon-
taining various halls, chambers, etru, which stands at right angles
to the main building (comp. p. clxvi).

We enter the temple from the N.E. The first pylon is in ruins
and the tirst court is still occupied by modern huts.

The Second Court, which opens to the S. on the temple proper,
is in better preservation. The sons and daughters ofkamses II.
were represcutetl ou the wall on the inner side of the Pylon, but
the iigures and inscriptions have been almost clened. On the right
and left walls appears Ramses IL, saerit'using to different gods; on
each side are steles " Ramses II. At the back ot' the court a
low incline ascends to the vestibule of the temple proper, which
is supported by 19. square piers of limestone and originally had
seven doors in its rear wall. 0n the wall, to the left of the main
entrance, is a Large Inscription in 95 vertical lines, in which
Ramses Il. describes in (lorid language the completion of the temple.
In the adjoining relief Ramses is shown presenting an image of the
goddess Maat to a tried consisting of Osiris, Isis, and his father
Sethoa L, who takes the place of Horus. On the wall are other
representations of Puuuses in presence of the gods. - The seven
