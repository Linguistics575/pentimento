laus times of the llyksos Supremacy and were replaced under the
18th Dyn. by new buildings, in which the materials of the earlier
editiees were utilized as far as possible. In plan they seem to
have corresponded exactly with the later sanctuaries, and prolmbly
many temples of the later period were erected on the plans of the
earlier buildings. In decoration also they exactly reseiiihled the
later temples. The inner walls were adorned with reliefs showing
the king in communion with the gods ; the ceilings of their hallswem
supported by columns of various patterns [cempt pp. clviii et seq.);
and in front of their entrances rose tall ohelisks (p. 121) and colossal
statues of the Pharaohs.

llowever different from earl other the TEMPLES DI' THE. New
Emma}: appear at tirst sight, there is but little diffiertlty in refer-
ring them all to two general fundamental forms. One of these, re-
calling, probably quite accidentally, the Greek Peripteros or temple
surrounded by a colonnade, was especially popular during the
18th Dyn., the age of Thutmosis HI. and his successors. The
rectangular cells Lor sanctuary), containing the sacred boat with
the image of the pod and provided with doors at each end, rose
upon a basement of masonry, rrewned with a concave cornice and
approached by a flight of steps. On all four sides it was surrounded
by a roiomiade, the roof of which rested upon square pillars or
on lâ€™reto-Dorie columns, connected by low screens. Occasionally
this main structure was atljoined at the back by several smaller
apartments, also used for religious rites. Among the peripteml
structures of this kind are the small temples ofThutrnosis III. at
liarnak ami Medium Uabu (pp. 279, 328), the S. temple of Buheu
near Wa'di Ilalfa (p. 412): and a sanctuary of Amenaphis m. upon
the island of Elephantine, whieh has now vanished. Clniousl)
enough this form of periptcros was revived in the Ptelemaic period,
though with various modifications, being used in the so-called Birth
Houses (Mammisi), which stood beside the principal temples Ces. at
Philae; p. 367) and were dedicated to the worship of the maternal
deity (Isis or Mather] and her child. The inner sanctuaries in these
birth-houses also were surrounded with colottailiss, the roofs of
whieh, however, were borne by the curious trum-columns t'40Wrl-
ed with heads of lIathor or with figarrys of Bes.

The second fundamental form of the Egyptian temple is most
simply and clearly illustrated in the small temples built by Ram-
ses III. at Karnak in honour of Khons and of Anion, with his two
emupauion-deities (pp.262, 267 ; see speeialplan of the great temple
of Anion at liarnali, p. 5265). The approach to the temple is formed
by the Pylon, two large towers ofmasenry flanking the entrauce-door.
These towers are shaped like very steep truncated pyramids; the
slightly inclining walls, framed with round mouldings, offer the
greatest available space for reliefs. The towers were imposing from
heir sheer size, and this impression was heightened (from the
