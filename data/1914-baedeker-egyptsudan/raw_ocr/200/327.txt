he able to see the mausolea of his seven favourite wives in the
valley below.

The entrance to the mosque lies an the NNV. side in the lower part
of the minaret, which is hunt in the earlier style of architecture. It
leads to am open court ndjoined by the vaulted prayer-ronm which is
decnrnted in the Ilyztuttiae-Persito tltstu. Tu the left of it is the tomb
of the founder.

Below the mosque are the Rocky Caves of Coptic monks, with Coptic
and Arabic inscriptions. Some of them may he reached by a steep path.

At the N. end of the plateau is an old Turkish Fort, whence a
bridge descends to the citadel. 0n the NE. and higher part of the
Mohattam, separated from the citadel by alarge quarry, is a memo:-
ial stone, to the right, adj ining the summit, erected in 1874 by
the British party " srsieutili6 men who observed the transit ofVehus
from this point. The projecting rock in front of this commands
the most extensive panorama in the neighbourhood of Cairo,
and should certainty be visited if time permit. The S. end of
these hills is skirted by the mad to the smaller Petrified Forest,
which may be reached from this point in about 1 hr. (see p. 110)

On the steep slope of the Mokattam, to the S of the (rtyt1shi
Mosque, lies the se-called Castle of the Mamelukes or mosque " Et-
Khalawt‘tti, built in 1533. The ruinous interior may he entered from
below. A steep path, practicable for expert climbers only, ascends
hence through the aboveo1entiouei1 Coptic caves to the plateau.

The route back to the town skirts the citadel on the S. and
leads via the Bab el»I_x'ani/'eh and the Place Saladht (p. 68)

The geologist will certainly iiud it profitable to visit the Petrified
Forest (corap. p. ixis), but for other traveliers its chief interest lies in
the fact that they here obtain their iirst glimpse of the E. desert. The
latter may therefore content themselves with an excursion to the Little
Petriyiei Forest, the outskirts of which may be usatshed in 11/7-2 hrs. The
expedition my he made in lrJH-a-day on donke hack Cp. 39). Carriages
require extra horses and even then sometimes stick in the sand. - The
deviation to the se-caned Sprtny nf Noses adds rather less than an hour
to the expedition, and irtlse donkey-hny knows the mute a guide may be
dispensed with. A visit to the Great Petrified Forest em- llartliy be he-
uomptished without the mid of tk well-informcd guide.

Starting at the Bib ea-Nay (p. 77), or from the point where
the route to the Tombs of the Caliphs leaves the hluski fp, 111),
we ride by the Tombs of the Ualiphs, pass between the Mohattam
(p.110) and tho 'Red Mountaiu’ (p.115), and ascend a desert
valley, into which the E. spurs of the Mokattam descend. Farther
on an isolated hill of red and black sandstone resembling the 'lled
