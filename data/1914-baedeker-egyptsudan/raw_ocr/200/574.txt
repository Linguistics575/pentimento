The **Ramesseum, the large mortuary temple built by ilam-
ses II. on the W. bank and dedicated to Anion, is unfortunately
only half preserved. We may in all probability identify it with the
"l'omb of Osymarulya8' described by the Augustan historian Dio-
tlorus, '0symandyas' being regarded as a corrupt form of C/ser-ma-re,
the pmuomen of Ramses II.

We begin our inspection at the great Pyinn. the E. entrance to
the temple. This was originally 220 ft. broad, but its ruined ex-
terior now resembles a quarry. Many representations on the broad
surfate of its W. Side, next the first court, are in fair Preservation
and easily recognizable with an opera-glass (especially by afternoon-
light). They refer to the Syrian campaigns of Ramses IL, notably

to the war with the Hittites (comp. p. 258).

On the Xotmi TOWER, to the extreme Left, we ohserve the Asiatic
furtresses taken by Ramses in the 31h year of his reign. Thirteen of
the original eighteen ere still recognizable, each with an inscription erm-
taining its name. The captives are being led away. In the Middle are
scenes from the war with the Hittites, which are continued on the S.
tower, Below is the Egyptian army on the march; ahove appears the
Egyptian Camp, within a rampart of shields, presenting an animated scene.
The chariots are drawn up in long lines, with the unharnessed horses be-
side them; close by are the heavy baggage-waggons With their teams,
unperturbed by the great lion or the king, which reciines before him. The
asses employed in the cummissariat service of the army are conspicuous
in the camp; now released from their burdens, they testify satisfaction by
means of movements and attitudes which the artist seems never tired of
drawing. The soldiers are conversing with each other, and one drinks
from a wine-skin. Disputes and quarrels are not Wanting, Above, to the
right. the tranquillity Hi the camp is mdeiy disturbed hy an attack of
the Hittites, To the Right the king holds a council of war with his
prirrees. Beneath captured spies are being beaten.

The Left Half or the SOUTH Town: of the pylon is occupied by the
picture of the battle of Kadesh, which We have already seen on the pylon
athxor (p. 258). Ramses in his chariot dashes against his toes, who are
either slain by his arrows ur flee in wild cunfnsion and mu into the
Unintes. Behind the king are other war-elurriotg. To the right, at a
distance from the scene of action, is the Hittite prince. Above is a second,
new scarcely distinguishable, representation of the Hittitee fleeing to their
fortress. The reliefs cut the Eight Half show the usual presentment of
the king, grasping enemies by the hair and smiting them; farther to the
right is the king holding a lung staff and acemnprrnie6 by fan-bearers.

0n the interior walls of the Portal of this pylon are the usual reliefs
nf Ramses saccifieiag to various gods. At the top of the lamb; (P1. a, b)
Ramses appears pacing out the precincts er the teat le (a rite performed
at the foundation ot' a temple; Comp. pp. 242, 2%3); at the bottom,
surriuus deities.

The First Court is now utterly ruined, with nothing left but frag-
ments of the wall on the W. side, in front of which lie the remains
of a *C'olassus of Ramses II. The name of Ramses II. appears in
welI-preserved hieroglyphics on the upper arms and on the seat of

the statue. The face is completely destroyed. The remains (breast
