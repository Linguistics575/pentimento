ley, recognizable from a distance by the Stair leading up to it. The
latter consists of 41 steps hewn in the rock, with a massive bal-
astrade on each side. The temple, dedicated to Nekhbeyet, was Con-
structed under Ptolemy IS. Euergetes lL (Physhon), and provided
with reliefs and inscriptions by him and by Ptolemy X. Soter ll,

Most of these date from the end of the Middle Empire or from the
beginning of the New Empire. There are 31 tombs in all, but only

of small dimensions, but theirdistinet pit-tutcs of auricut Egyptian
domestic life will interest oven those travellers who have already
seen the tombs of Benihnsan (p. 227) and Sheikh 'Abd el-lfur'na
