some cases invalids also, may sleep with the windows open with safety.

Those Who wish to take a small Medicine Cheat with them, a prov

(8). Intercourse with Orientals. Dragomans.

The average Oriental regards the European traveller us a Cruesus,
therefore as fair game, and feels Justified in pressing upon him with
a perpetual demand for bakshish (balsshish), which simply means
‘a gift'. The number of beggars is enormous, but they are not
nearly so iu1portunate as those in Italy and elsewhere, Travellers
are often tempted to give for the sake ot' airordirvg temporary pleasure
at a triiling cost, forgetting that the seeds of insatiable cupidity are
thereby sown, to the iaOite ant10yiH10e of their successors and the
demoralization of the recipients themselves. Bakshish should never
be given except for services rendered, or to the aged and cripyled;
and the Government appeals to the tourist by public placards not
to encourage the habit of begging. A beggar may be silenced with
the words 'at Atldlt or AUG yehannin 'aleik [God have mercy on
thee " or Arhih ytf.tik (may God give theel). The best reply for
more impartunate cases is mui fish, rnts fish (I have nothing for you)
or mdttsh balcshfsh [there is no present), which will generally have
the effect of dispersing the assailants for a time.

It is, oirrourse, inevitable that coachmen, guides, rlonkoy-boys,
and the like should expect a gratuity in addition to the stipulated
fee for their services, and the traveller should therefore take care to
be amply supplied with small CHANGE at all times, and especially
with pieces of half a piastrc (comp. pp. xv, 37). Payment should
never be made until the service stipulated for has been rendered,
after which an absolutely deaf ear should be turned to the pro-
testations and entreaties which almost invariably follow. Even when
an express bargain has been made, and more than the stipulated
sum paid, they are almost sure to pester the traveller in the way
indicated. When no bargain has been made, the fees and prices
mentioned in the Handbook, all of Which are ample, should be paid
without remark; and if the attacks which iu18110 are not silenced by
an air of calm indifference the traveller may use the word rm} or
imshi (be oir0 or uskut (be quiet!) in a quiet but decided and im-.
