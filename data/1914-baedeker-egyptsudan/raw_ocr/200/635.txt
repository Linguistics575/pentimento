Elephantine. ASSURN. N. Route. 357

From the N. quarries we follow the just-mentioned causeway,
which iirst crosses the mountain (fine view), then descends into a
picturesque valley, and finally runs along on a level to (h hr.) the
S. Quarry, which opens to the Ig., facing the desert. This also
t'ontains rough-hewit blocks ready for removal. On a rock here
may be seen an inscription with the name of Amenophis 111.,
though the name and figure of the stone-cutter who carved it have
heen obliterated. llpside it two trough-shaped sarcophagi have been
begun (in the Ptolemaic er in the Roman period); and in the
vicinity are the uutiaished colossus of a king (covered, except the
feet, with sand), and a large quadrangular block, perhaps intended
for the shrine of a god. Farther on, near the railway, and towards
the top of the clitf, is a figaris of Osiris (called Ramses hy the
natives), about 20 ft. in height This point commands a fine view
of the desert and in the direction of Phiias.

if we follow the railway-line we reach the railway station of
Shellil (p. 363) in 1/4 hr.

The verdant island of Elephantis1e, with its luxuriant palm
trees, attracts all travellers. The Arabs call it merely Et-t7estreh,
Lt. 'island', or Sesiret Assutin. It is reached by boat (felxikrt) in a
few minutes from the landing-place (return fare 2 pus.) or by the
steam-launch of the Savoy Hotel (1 pins; free to guests), and the
entire visit takes barely an hour. There are two villages on Elephan-
tine, whose inhabitants speak Nubian. Begging is common.

By far the most interesting object is the *Nilometet (Miltyzâ€™is),
heside a salgiyeh on the Ji. side facing Assmin. After more than a
thousand years of neglect it was restored to use in 1870 in the
reign of Isma'il, as is recorded by French and Arabic inscriptions.
0n the walls of the staircase are damaged Greek inscriptions of the
imperial epoch, giving the water-levels. The scales date from the
later imperial epoch, and the elIs are marked in Greek [and also in
demotic) characters. The new scale is inscribed on marble tablets.
_ Strabo's description is not yet antiquated: -

'The Nilometer is a well built or regular hewn stones, on the bank
of the Nile, in which is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the
maximum but also the minimum and average rise, for the water in the
well rises end fans with the stream. On the side of the well are marks,
measuring the height sufficient for the irrigation and the other water
levels. These are observed and puhlished for general h1rormation,
This is of importance to the peasants for the management of the w ,
the embankments, the canals, etc., and to the onieials on account at the
taxes. For the higher the rise or water, the higher are the taxes.'

At the head of the stone staircase leading to the nilometer, in a
pretty garden, is the Aswan Museum (open 9-r, adm. 5 pins.) It
t'antains an interesting collection of antiquities, mostly from Lower
Nubia. inrlntling the mummy of a rant from the neeropolis (p. 358)
