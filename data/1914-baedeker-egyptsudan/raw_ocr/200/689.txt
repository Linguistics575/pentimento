with the verdant cultivated land and the grey houses ofrAnibeh.

Close to the S. slope of the castie-hill lie the ruins of a smell Town7

simple Ciiriuinu graves and same brick mm: on a more ambitious scale.
There is a similar certsetury in the valley to the N. of the easrle.

In the steep w. slope of the castle-hill ate several large Memorial
Rescues. dating from the New Empire. These new lie at some
height above the river-bank and some are very 1lifiieult of access, but
