The ruins cover an area of ahout125 acres. A street 400 yds. in
length, formerly embellished with figures of recumbent lions, leads
past welt-preserved houses to a platform on which an important
temple once stood. This temple, built under the Ptolemies, was
dedicated to Soknapaios o. 196) and the 'beautifully enthroned
Isis'. 'l'hc precinct was surrounded by a brick wall, and the temple
itscll‘ contained several apartments, those in the that being lined
with well-jointed limestoue-blocks and those in from having walls
of roughly hewn stone coated with stucco. Very few reliefs have
been found here; on one appears a Ptolemy praying before a ram-
hoaded deity (probably A1110“).

At the (hot of a steep descent in the Libyan Desert, about 5 M. to
the N. or Dimei, Prof. Sahweint‘urth discovered the 5mm Temple of ira.sr
U§-delm. It consists of blocks of limestone and cunutins seven recesses
and several other apartments, but no sculptures or inscriptions. In the
vicinity are remains of an ancient quay.

In the desert, tn the E. from the E, bank uf the hike and to the N,W,
from T‘mzyeh (p, 193), rices the mound of ATns Ushfm, covering the ruins
of Kar . a Greek mm. frequently mentioned in local history, with a.
temple of Pnepherhs and Petesuchos. - The mound called Umm el-Att,
T M. to the Fl. uf Kuritnis, marks the site of Batchinx, with e ruined
Greek temple. Both mounds were explored in 1896 by Messrs. iiegmh
and Grenreu, at the expense or the Egypt Exploration Fund.

 

The ruins marking the site of Kaer Karl‘m lie at the S.\V. end of
the Bicket Farriu, We land on the promontory of I(hashm Khalil,
which is overgrown with tamarisks and reeds. Ascending thence
across the desert for about an hour. we reach the temple, which is
now 21/4 M. from the lake, though it originally stood on its bank.
The gsliesmen object to pass the night here, being afraid of the
Beduins and thc ‘Afrit (evil spirits).

Kngt Famta is most ermveaierrtly visited from 6hattrtts/rneh (li'l<0ha-
wachnah), a station on the light railway (p. 193).

Kaer Kamn is a fairly well preserved temple, of the late Pto-
iemaic period. The numerous traces of an ancient town that sur-
round it are probably those of Dionysias, Which was situated on the
extreme W. verge of the Roman province of Egypt, at the beginning
ot' the caravan-route to the ‘Small Oasis' Jayriyele, p.379). A cir-
cular foundation-wall indicates the site of an ancient cistern. The
walls of the temple consist ul' carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in the oases, Was
dedicated to tho ram-headed Amon-Khuum, as is proved by two
figures of this deity standing at the highest part ot' the posterior wall
of the upper story of the open roof. The winged sun-disk occurs over
each gateway in the building. There are no ancient inscriptions.

The temple is 2t yds. in width 'Repo" the r Me and 301/2 yds. in length-
The entrance, facing the w, is approached by a lofty and carefully com
strueted platform, ll yds. 11 length, forming in forecourt. 0n the fayade
