Ramses I. (Ramesse) had a short reign. His tomb is at Bihin el-
Mtoliik (p. 291).

Sethos I. (Sclhy JOfought against the Libyaus, the Syrians, and the
llittites (Kheta), a powerful people that under the 18thDyu. had
penetrated from Asia Minor into N. Syria and threatened the
Egyptian possessions in Syria and Palestine. Sethos built large
temples at Karnak, liurna, and Abydos. His tomb is at Bibin
el-3fuliik (p. '292), his mummy at Cairo (p. 96).

Ramses II. (Rumesxe, ca. 1292-1925 11.0.), the most celebrated of
all Egyptian kings. He waged tedious wars against the Hittites
(battle of Kadesh, p. 307], finally making a peace with them in
the 21st rear of his reign (p. 272), which left Palestine proper
in the possession of the Egyptians, while N. Syria was acknow-
ledged to be tributary to the Hittites. Ramses developed an
extraordinary building activity in the course of his reign of
67 years. Perhaps one-half of all the extant temples date from
this reign; and the name of Ramses is found in nearly every
group of ruins in Egypt. His largest temples were those of Ahu
Sinibel(p.404), KarnakCp.265l, Luxor(p.257), tlutRatrlessetsin
(p. 306), Abydos (p. 2i3), Memphis (p. lid), and Bnbastis
(p. 171). His tomb is at Bibin Bl-31ultik (p. 987), his mummy
at Cairo (p. 96). Ramses IL is frequentlyidentitied, but probably
erroneously, with the 'Pharaoh of the Oppression' (Exod. i. 11).

Ststh-rliurht succeeded in restoring peace.

Ramses IO. (llamesse, 1200-1179 BA).) conquered the Lihyaus and
in two great battles repelled an invasion of barbarians who HI-
proached from Asia Minor by land and by water, threatening
Egypt. Bis reign of 2t years was thereafter an epoch of peace
and quiet, in which several large buildings (e.g. the temple at
Medinet Habu, p. 323) were erected. The king presented great
gifts to the gods, especially to the Tlutbail Amon, who had
been richly endowed by former kings,also. The high-priest of
