Along the bank of the Nile runs the EMBANKMENT, a promenade
about 3M. in length, planted with lehbakh and other trees, The view
hence is very tine; on the opposite hank, beyond the sand-banks
in the Nile, which are covered when the river is high (in October),
lies the desert-town of omdurmin, with misty hills in the baryk-
ground; to the N. rise the hills of Kerreri and Slirkah (p. 431);
also to the N. is the island " Tuti, with its vegattrble-gardems. On
this island are a number of conical grass-huts inhabited by natives,
and an old fort which offered a desperate resistance to the der-
vishes in 1885.

Following the Embankment to the E. from the t7rand-H6tet we
pass the Coptic Church (Pl.2), with its two towers, and a number of
attractive villas, including those of the Mridir, the Financial Secre-
tary, and the Commandant (Pl. 4; D, 3). We next reach the Poet
' Telegraph tWee (PL 5; D, 3) and the War (Wrce (Pl. 6; D, 3),
cousi erably enlarged in 1913, with most of the offices of the civil
administration. Adjoining the latter rises the Gothic Palace ofthe
flirddr and Rovernor-0enerat (Pl. D, 3y, before it stand a British
sentinel (on the river side) and two Sudanese Sentinels (on the s.
side). A special permit is needed for a visit to the house or grounds.
The palace incorporates the lower story of Gordonâ€™s house, in which
he fell under the lanees of the dervishes (memorial tablet in the
corridor). - Farther on are military stores and the workshops of
the Public Wurks Department. The gardens and villas of the British
ortitirls, including that of Slatin-Pasha (Pl. 10; E, 3), add a pietar-
esque feature to the scene, many of the houses being built in the
bungalow style. At the comer of Mohammed Ali Street is the
attractive building of the Sudan Club (PL E, 3), situated in a
garden. Farther on is the Military Hospital.

We then reach the Gordon Memorial College (Pl. E, F, 3;
director, Mr. James Currie), for which Lord Kitchener obtained the
necessary funds by public subscription throughout the British Empire.
This is a large and substantial building in which native youths are
trained by English and Egyptian teachers for an official career. The
College contains a Higher Elementary School, a Higher School for
Technical Education (surveying and engineering), a Training (Jol-
lege for Sehoo1masters and Cadis, and a Military Cadet School.
Associated with it are Instructional Workshops, an Economic Museum
(with interesting archaeological, ethnographical, and natural history
collections), and a Bacteriological ' Chemical Laboratory (adm. 9-1),
the last due to the Iiberality of Mr. Henry S. Wellcome of London.
