all sras‘ous, thus allowim,r a series of crops to Ire, raised throughout
the year. Mohammad Ali deepened canals and began in 1835 the
construction of the Delta Barrage (comp. p. 122), which was not
completed, however, until 1890. It renders it possible to raise the
upstream watcr-level so that the Water can at all times floss into the
three main delta-cannls, the Rayilt et-Ta11fitri, the Ilayil; el-Nerul-
fiyeh, and the Ilayil, ('I- Bchcireh. In 1002 were completed the
Assuan Dam (p 731] sud the Assiut llarragc (p.232). The 'i'ili of
these works (recently heightened) allows a reserve-supply of water
to be kept to increase the insurtieient supply of the river in May,
June, and July, while the second vnablps the water-lever of the
river at Assor. to be ruisml until it Mws :lowu the great Ibrahimiyeh
Uanal whieh supplies the provinces of AssiU., Minyeh, Renisueif,
Gizeh, and (thrnu: tho Baht Yl‘lsuf) the IFriiyom. Finally the bar-
rage at Kslmh (p. M2), vompletetl in INN, provides for the irri-
gation of thv provinr‘c of Ifeneh. One vwircet ofthe modiiieations
thus introdurml is to diminish to sumo extent the importance of the
high flootls, hut to unhauvu ouormously the value of a favourable Iow-
stagc supply, since in April, May, June, and July, when the supply
of water is lowest, .1 very large proportion of the country from
Assitit. to the sea is bearing crops, principally cotton, the most
valuable crop of the Far. Another effect of increased perennial
irrigation is that the volume of water brought down by bountiful
inundation, is greater than is now requirml. Of late years.v T
large shms have been expended in pmvidi g 311 eifuOnt system'ot'

The breadth of the, Nile valley is nowhere great, and only a por-
tion of it is occupied by the cultivated alluvial plain, the rest mn-
sistiug of dssert-sauds at too high a level to he reached by the
inundation, 111 Nubia the, cultivzlhle lnnll is restricted to isolated
patches, while the valley is rarely as much as 2-3 M. wide; in
Egypt it is wirler, varying from 15 M. at Benisueif to 5 M. at Edfu,
of Which 13 Jr. and 4 M. respectively are cultivated.

The alluvial deposit which is annually brought down by the
Nile in tl00d has arwumulated in the mllrsu of eentaries to an averagu
depth of 35-40 ft., occasionally even mom lu cumposition it varies
slightly from plane to place. As a rule it forms a good light soil
being rather above the average in potash but deficient in nitrates
The view formerly held that it had a high manurial value Was an
exaggerated one, am! it should he considered rather as a virgin soil
which, added annually to the surface of the land, enables it to
bear luxuriant crops year after year.

Every year during the Mod a considerable deposit of silt takes
place in the river-bed, part of which is carried away as the river
falls, but the general result is that the bed of the Nile has been
