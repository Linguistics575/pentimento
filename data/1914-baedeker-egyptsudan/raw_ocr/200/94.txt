Dogma by no means plays such an important part 111 Isltun as in
Christianity; for the simple Moslem creed is embodied in the words:
'There is no God but God (Allah) and Mohammed is the prophet
of God'. But all the same lively controversies over dogma have not
been absent in the development of Ishtm, mainly owing to the in-
tluenee of Graco-Chxistian modes of thought. Just as in the sphere
of law, we tind here a literal and a speculative interpretation; and
in the sphere of dogma also orthodoxy triumphed by adopting the
speculative method in a modified form. The process of amalgama-
tion is generally associated with the name of El-Ash‘ari (d. 935).
The questions most eagerly canvassed were those relating to the free-
dom of the will, the attributes of God, and the nature of the Koran
(is. whether it is 'eternal' " 'created'). The orthodox solutions of
these problems are roughly as follows, There is but one'God, in
whom certain universal attributes inhere (knowledge, seeing, hear-
ing, este.), but who must not be conceived of under a human form.
H0 is all-mighty and has therefore created also evil, which serves
his purposes of salvation in a manner inconceivable by our limited
human intelligence. Above all, God is the Creator, who at every
moment re-creates all things. Causality is merelythe creative opera-
tion of the divine will. In this connection man is not free, for every-
thing is immutably foteordaiued by God's will. God operates every-
