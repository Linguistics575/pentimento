lrx ll. GEOGRAPHICAL AND e. Agriculture:

3. The WEsaamy or LIBYAN Desem (pp. 378 et seq.) is totally
rlitrerent. The level limestone plateau, about 1000 ft. above the sea,
extends to the w., its S, escarpment overlooking the lower plain of
the Nubian sandstone to the S. In deep bays in this escarpment lie
the cases of Khargeh, Dtslruelv, and Fardfra, while that of Bahriyeh is
situated in a depression surrounded by the higher plateau. The pla-
teau is waterless and practically devoid of vegetation, while, isolated
kuo0s show how rapidly the erosion of the desert-surface by wind
is proceeding. In certain parts lines of sand-dams 100-200 ft. high
stretch across the (losert plateau in e N.N.W. and 8.5th direction,
sometimes for several hundred miles with hardly a break. They are
most developed to tho W. ofthe oasis of Dékhleh. The floor of the
uases ofKhtrgeh and Dikhleh consists mostly of dark-coloured sands
and clays of the upper crctaceous formation, Sornoberis contain alum
and others are plrosphsrtic. Springs well up at many points from a
depth of about 400 ft. and furnish an abundant water-supply to the
cultivated lands (comp. p.1xxii). Some of those rise through natural
11sstu'os and others through holes bored for the purpose.

To the S. of the oases lies the lower plain of the Nubian samL
stone. This plain contains no hills of any importance, but pre-
sents a low rolling surface covered With blackened thhit pebbles
and concretions of iron and manganese oxide, While the s'1licitied
trunks of fossil trees are frequently met with. Yellow drift-sand is
seen everywhere, but it is only occasionally that it forms dunes of
any size,

The oasis of Farfufm lies farther to the W., and to the N. and W.
of it extends the plateau of t‘oeene limestone as far as the oasis of
Siweh. The strata here are mostly of mioceuo age, and they contain
numerous fossils, a fact recorded by Herodotus and Rratosthenes,

9. Agriculture and Vegetation.

I. CAPABILITIES op TUE SOIL. The land is extremely fertile, but
it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is sometimes represented
to be. Many of the crops, as elsewhere, mast oecasionallyhe followed
by a fallow period; others thrive only when a certain rotation is oh-
served (such as wheat, followed by clover and beans); and some
ileh1s require to be artificially manured. Occasionally two crops are
yielded by the same tield in the same season (wheat and saffron,
wheat and clover, ete0. The great extension within the last thirty
or forty years of the cultivation of the sugar-Cure, which requires
a great deal of moisture, and ot' the "otton-plant, which requires
much less, has necessitated considerable modifieatioasiu the modes
ufirrigation and cultivation hitherto in use As both of these crops
are of a very exhausting character, the land must either he more
frequently left fallow or must be astiiieially manured. The in-
dustry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are thus
