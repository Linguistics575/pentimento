eneh " which was lower than the one inside it. A STEP Miseruu
(step-pyramid) was thus developed, such as may still be seen in
the step-pyramid at Salslrira and the pyramid at Meidilm (comp.
pp. 146, 205). The normal form
of smooth pyramid was ov01verl
from the step-pyramid at the
beginning of the 4th Dym, and
thencefotward it remained the
usual form for royal tombs until
the l8th Dynasty. In the rock
beneath the massive stone erec-
tion of the pyramid a sloping
shaft (P1. a) led to a subterran-
ean passage, closed by means
of a stone trap-door, midto the
chamber (PL b) in which the
sarcophagus stood. The great
pyramids at Gizeh, the step-
pyramid at Salrluira, and various
others contain several passages and se vexal chambers, hut the exist-
ence " these is due to moditieations of the original plan " to
later alterations (pp. 125, 126). The inner rooms of the pyramids,
and particularly the sareoplsagus-ehatnbiyrs, which were made in-
aeeessible after the interment, Were almost entirely destitute of
ornament in the ancient period. It was not until the end of the
5th Dyn. that it began to be customary to adorn the walls with re-
ligious texts (the sa-called 'Pyramid Texts'). The recess or the
room in which sacriticrvs were offered to the dead in the maetahas
was represented in the ease " the pyramids by a detached temple
on the E. side. These temples were divided into two portions, one
prrblie, the other private. The centre of the public portion was oc-
cupied by a large open court, surrounded with arcades, off which
opened five ehamheis for the statues of the deceased monarch; the
principal apartment in the private temple was the sanctuary cow
tainimg the stele. 0n the edge of the cultivated land, moreOVeiu
stood a temple. forming a monumental gdteway, rising on a terrace
and connected by a long covered approach with the mortuary temple,
which lay on the desert-plateau. The walls of the pymmid-temples
of the 4th Dyn, were left bare, but those of the temple at Abugir
are partly covered with reliefs, which to some extent display the
same types as are seen in tho temples of the gods (the king as a
griTm triumphing over foreign foes, booty captured from the enemy,
military campaigns, etc.) The host preserved mortuary temples of
the Ancient Empire are the temple beside the pyramid of Meidam
(p. 205; apparently unfinished), the temples of Khephren and My-
kerinos beside the pyramids of Giza}: (pp. 132, 133), and those of
Sehnre, Nefer-er-ke E, and Nuserr√© wt Abujir (p. IM). Less is known
