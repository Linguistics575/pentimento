Mat.iriyeh iGr.-Htst. Matarieh) is an insigniiio village, note-
worthy only for its proximity to Heliopolis and for its possession
of the Virgin’: Tree, an ancient sycamore, under which, according
to the legend, the Virgin and Child once rested during the Flight
into Egypt. The sycamore, planted after 1072, was seriously itt-
jured in 1000, but a shoot still flourishes and is now protected by
a railing. The garden in Which it grows is watered by means of
:1 double sU.riyeh, supplied from a shallow reservoir fed by springs.
This water is drinkable, while that of all the other springs, which
percolates through the ground from the Nile, is usually brackish;
and this peculiar quality is popularly ascribed to the fact that the
spring was called into being by the Child Jesus. Adjoining the
garden is the Roman Catholic chapel of Notre-Dame de Matarieh.

From the garden the 8Mrir el-Misallrz (Oareh el JrassauaJleads
in 12-15 minutes to the obelisk and ruins of the famous ancient
Heliopolis (p. exlv), or city of the sun, called On by the Egyp-
tians. The latter name frequently occurs in the Bible. Thus, in
Genesis (x11. C5), we are informed that Pharaoh gave Joseph 'to
wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherall (Egypt. Pete-pre-, 'he
whom the sun- -gotl Re has given '), priest of On'.

the chief town of a separate province incinded in Lower Egypt. The
deities of the place were the falcon-headed R6-Hrmu:hte (the san-god,
