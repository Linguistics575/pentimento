'Abbas Square. siraRTisl. 34. Route. 429

Beyond the railway are the British barracks and the village of
Bum‘ (Pl. G, 3), with the water-works.

We return from the Cordon Memorial College by Khediw Avenue,
which runs parallel with the Embankment. Here are the Mara'nite
Church (Pl. 13; E, 3) and the new Cathedrat Church ot All Saints
(PI. r, E, 3), consecrated in 1912, the N. transept of which is the
Gordon Memorial Chapel. In the grounds behind the Sitdhr's
Palace is a Statue of Cordon (represented as riding an a camel),
a bronze copy of that executed by E. Onsluw Ford in 1890 for the
Royal Etiginisers' Institute at Chatham. - The grounds behind
the War Onise (p. 428) contain a large Late-Ethiopian Relief,
brought from a pyramid at Meroé (p. 422). It represents a king
and queen proteeted by the wings of Isis; to the right is a crowd
of death-gods, relatives, and priests, bearing gifts or celebrating
funeral rites. - Farther on are the National Bank ol' Egypt (Pl. 12,
D 4; left), the Survey Department (right), the orfiee of the Stores
Section (left) and the law-eourts, the Irrigation Department, and
the M&dirryeh (Pl. 3; D, 3), or office of the mtodir, all three on
the right.

To the W. of the Grand-Hinel, on the Embankment, lies the
pretty Zunloyical Garden (Pl. I, C 3; open free), which contains
a representative collection of Sudanese animals. A Very attractive
walk is afforded by the Promenade extending to the Mogren er
Jfugran Point (comp. p. 427), the promuntory between the two
arms of the Nile, the ditrerent-eoloured waters of which are easily
recognizable after their junction. Along the bank are numerous
sékiyehs (cumy, p. 427), for watering the tields and palm-groves,
To the left are a Nubian village, pieturesquely situated among
palms, and various other settlements.

The business-part of Ehar.tsim, which is ehietiy inhabited by
Greeks, is restricted to the portion of the town lying to the S. of
Khedive Avenue, and is intersected by the tramway. Its central
point is the large 'Abb& Square (Pl, D, 4), with a handsome Masque;
to the N.W. are the interesting Markets. The Bazaars are especially
animated in the afternoon.

Fram the Gordon Statue (see above) Victoria Avenue runs to the
S., crossing the ‘Ahh'as Square, and brings us to the Central Rail-
way Station (Pl. D, 4), which may be reached also by the streets
parallel with Victoria Avenue. Beyond the station are the Parade
Ground and Racecourse and the Fortifcations constructed by Gordon.
To the right and left are barracks. To the S.E. lie the Sudanese
Villages (Pl. E, 4), known to the natives as Fii-Deim or 'the Camp’.
They shelter various tribes of the Sridtut (Shilluks, Dinkas, Bor-
nawis, Gubelawis, etc.). partly in mud hovels, partly in the eharae-
teristic round huts. Native dances may often be witnessed here.

Communication between Khartttrn and Omdurtmin is maintained
by a steam-ferry (p. 426) from the Mayra- Point (see above).
