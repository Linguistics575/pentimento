The construction of the railway to Khartphn was undertaken in
(896-97 in order to support the advance of the Anglo-Egyptian army;
and in spite ofthe enormous difficulty of laying a railway line armss
the sandy and stony surface of the desert, the work was so euergeti-
cally carried on that it advanced almost a mile dsily, As in the con-
struction of the Suez Canal (p. 183) the one essential point was
the provision of an adequate supply of water for the workmen and
the machinery. A series of watering-stations (I-VI) mis accordingly
established, at which wells, sunk to a depth of 80 ft., tap the sub-
terranean water, which is found to flow from the S. -On the E. rises

BIT Murfzt and behind Which runs the caravan-route from Korosko
to Abu Hamel! (comp. p. 399) The stony desert gradually gives
place to undulating sand-hills. As the train approaches Abu named
the dark-coloured ranges of hills, which border the left bank of the
Nile, become visible in the distance. Isolated dhm-palms, fields of

About 21,2 M. below Knreima and 2 IL from the right bank of the Nile

isolated tacky hill rises abruptly from the plain to a hcightof 302ft. At
its base extend the ruins of the ancient Ethiopian city of thata. Under
the New Empire Napalm was the southernmost town under Egyptian rule
and the chief iifrit of the trade with the Sims". It attained the zenith of
