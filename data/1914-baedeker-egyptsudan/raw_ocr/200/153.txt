VI. EGYPTIAN RELIGION cxlvii

of Amen speedily regained the upper hand; the new religion was
abolished and the earlier creed restored. The Egyptian religion re-
mained in its former confusion; the process ofamalgamating different
gods became more and more common; and religious belief gradually
lost all living reality. Men clung anxiously to the ancient traditions,
and the superstitious belief in amulets and magic as the only pro-
tection against harmful iniluenees gained universal sway. But no
fresh religious conceptions are to be found in the innumerable texts
inscribed upon the temples, tombs, and sarcophagi of thelaterperiod.
After the decline of Thebes Amen began to lose his prestige, and
his place was taken by the deities of the Delta, such as Osiris and his
group (Isis, Ilarpocrales. aml Anubis). Under the Ptolemies 0sorapis
(Sarapis, Serapis), Le. the deceased Apis-hull identified with Osiris
(comp p. 147). became the national deity of Greek Â©gypt, and the
worship of this god (an infernal deity, like the Pluto of the Greeks)
gradually spread beyond Egypt to the East and subsequently also to
the Roman empire. The old religion of Egypt was gradually van-
quished only by the power of Christianity

The Future Life. A considerable diversity of doctrine as to the
fate of man after death prevailed amongst the Egyptians, and the
various views were never reduced to a single authoritative creed.
The only point that was common to the whole people was the flru1
conviction that the life of man did not end at death, but that on the
contrary men continued to live just as they had lived upon earth,
provided that the necessaries of existence were assured to them. It
thus seemed specially necessary that the body should be carefully
interred and protected from decay, The next step was to build a
house for the deceased, after the pattern of his earthly abode, in
which he might dwell, and which, according to the popular belief,
he could quit at pleasure during the day. Statues, erected in a
special room for the purpuse, represented the owner of the house, his
family, and his domestics (p. cluiii). Sacrificial offerings provided
the deceased with food, and pious endowments ensured him against
hunger and thirst even in the distant future. Nor was this all; re-
presentations of food, utensils, ere., were painted or carved upon the
walls ofthe tomh or the sides of the sarcophagus, and it was believed
that through magic these representations could serve the deceased
in place of the real things, Ornaments, clothing, ete., were likewise
placed in the tomb or depicted on the walls for the same purpose.
The orcupations that engrossed the deceased while on earth, the
pleasures that be delighted in, the dignities that he enjoyed, awaited
him beyond the tomb, and these too were represented on the walls
in order that he might really possess them. To this belief we owe
those sepulehral paintings that give us so exact a picture of the life
ofthe ancient Egyptians. In the earliest times the grandees alone
were allowed to build themselves tombs, and that probahly only by
favour of the king. Those who Were not attached to the court had
