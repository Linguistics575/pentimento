of Cairo. TOMBS OF THE MAMELUKES. J. Route. 115

The retuni-route leading to the S. from the Tombs passes the
cemetery " Jrariifet Bib el- Westr to the gate othib W.Attliba (Btib
eb-Atabey; Pl. F, 5), which marks the end of the city of the dead on
the S. side, towards the citadel. Just to the E. is a fountain (sehil)
hewn in the rock by Emir &rekhiu, in 13M). As soon as we have
passed the gate we flud ourselves once more in the midst of the
animated life of the city.

Sumn- \VALKS m Ttus llzsexw. Those who major the silence and pure
air at the desert may proceed train the Tomb: at the Caliphs t" from
'Abbisiyeh, p. Tr') into one or the mun lateral valleys to the: _ cf the
Gehei ei- Ahmar (see below). A small raund hill of red sandstone in this
vicinity, khown by the Germans as 'Rennebaum's Volcano“ cummands a
superb panorama of the Arabian desert, the suburb of 'Abbtsstyeh, Helio-
polis Oasis, and the extremity of the Delta. _ We may return to the 8. vist
the 02021 Giyashi (p. 118) or to the N. via the Gebel el-Ahxuar, or Red
Jfotmtaia, rising to the E. of ‘Abhisiyeh. The mouatain consists 0f a
very hard cunglomeute of sand, pebbles, and fragments of fossil wood.
toioured red or yellowish brown by oxide or iron. Centuries ago the
quarries here yielded material for statues as they new do for excellent
and durable mill-stnnes and road-material.

The Tombs of the Mameiukes, to the S. of the Citadel, includ-
ing monuments of various periods, are most conveniently visited vii
the Jhib et-trar/i (P1. E. 7; p. 68). The tombs, both old and
new, approach close to the city and extend as far as to the slopes
of the Mohattam. The older tombs are in much poorer preservation
than the Tombs of the Caliphs, owing to their conversion into
modern burial-places. Some are now represented only by their
minareta. A few are of architectural and artistic interest. The
extant inscriptions upon them are almost exrslusively verses of the
Koran. To the left, halfway up the Mohattam, is the Convent of the
Bekttzshi (p. 70).

Outside the Bib el-I.fariieh we turn to the right, short of the
railway, and follow the Shin" el-f.fs'rdiriyeh and the Shiri‘ Imin1
Shtsfiri towards the eoi1spieuoustiue-grey dome of the Tomb Mosque
" Imhm Shkfi'i, the founder of one of the four orthodox schools of
lil-Islém (p. lxxxvi). The mausoleum, erected in 1211 by Maliktt
Shemseh, the mother of the Aiyubide sultan Rtmil, is a great plate
" pilgrimage and eonsequently inaccessible to unbelievers.

Near the mosque of Irmirn Shtti'i, in a lane passing beneath
vine-trellises, is the libs]: el-BMha, or family burial mosque, built
by Mohammetl Ali. The monuments (including those of Ibrahim
and 'Abbasl p. cxxii) are in white marble and were executed
by Greek and Armenian sculptors The inscriptions and ornament-
ation are richly gilded and painted. - About 1/2N. to the W. of
the mosque of Imiril Shtiri lie the sulphur-baths oi'Ain ex- Sim,
frequented by the Egyptians (train lil 14 min. from the Bib el- Lnk
p. 35, on Frid. and holidays only). Thence to the mosque of Am1I
and Old Cairo, see pp 111,110
