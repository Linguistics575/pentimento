LAST JUDGMENT. The doctrine of the regurrectmn has been highly
elaborated in the Koran and subsequent tradition; but its main features
have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians, as has also the appear-
aulue of Antichrist, and the part to he played hy Christ at the Last Day.
On that day Christ will estalulish Islam as the religion of the world.
Before him will re-nppear the Mahdi, the 'well-directed oue', the twelfth
Imam (p. mi), who will establish the Islamic ideal empire and will render
Islamic law supreme. The Last Judgment will begin on the appearauCe
"r cmm. The first trumpet-hlast or the angel Asrafil will kill every
living being; a secund will awaken the dead, Then follows the Judgment;
the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge or a lutir's breadth, while the
wicked fall from the bridge into the abyssofhell. Atlhe Judgmentev
man is judged according to the books of the recording angels Cy. lxxxvii).
The hook is placed in the right hand or the good, but is bound in the
left hand of the wicked behind their backs. The scales in which good
and evil deeds are weighed play an important part in deciding the soul's
fate, and the doctrine or the erficaey of works is carried so far that it is
believed works of supererogztion may be placed to the credit of other
believers. Hell, a! well as heaven, has ditrereat grades; and Isltirn as-
sumes the existence also of a purgatory, from which release is possible.
Paradise is depicted by Mohammed as a place or entirely material delights.

 

 

Mysticism, the third great branch of religious thought under
Isliuu, aims at an immediate union with the d irte on the basis of
emotion, in contradistiuction to the hair-splitting of the dogmatiets
and to the doctrine of the Miieaisy of works taught by the moralists.
The mystics seek their end in two ways. (h, the one hand they
bridge over the vast gulf between God and humanity by the con-
ception of mediators with God, viz. Saints, who with reference to
an expression in the Koran are known as 'those who stand uear
6oil'(Auliya, sing. Wuli); and 011 the other hand, by emotional
exercises in company, they aim at producing an ecstatic exaltation
of mind, Le. the immediate blending of their own individuality
with that of the Deity. The latter is the explanation of the practices
of the orders of dervishes o. xci). In the worship of saints, which
centres principally at tombs and ancient holy sites, we trace the
same popular polytheistic tendencies as appear in Christianity,
connected with the primitive traditions of the heroic age. A not
unwarrantable attempt has been made to deduce the fundamental
forms of early Semitic religious conceptions from the practices
current to-day in the Islamic saint-worship. The recognition of
saints became possible in Islam when Mohammad himself Was
exalted above the irtiirmities of humanity. The tomb of Mohiun-
med at Medina and that of his grandson Hoseiu at Kerhela he-
came particularly famous, and every little town soon boasted ofthe
tomb of its particular saint. In many of the villages the traveller
will observe small dome-covered buildings with grated windows.
These are saints' tombs and are called '8heikW (comp. p. clxxxii ).
'Sheikh' also means a chief or old man. shreds of cloth are often
seen suspended from the gratings of these tombs, or on certain trees
