Fraas :1 Silurian rock with onlcrappings of later granite.) In 1 hr.
more we reach the Bir J.rarnrmhndt, a welt 16 it. in diameter, now,
however, containing no water. Near the well are the remains of a
Roman wall and the uriflnislurd and now shattered sarcophagi. The
quarries contain numerous Egyptian inscriptions, The earliest ex-
pedition ta l.lammirnit of which we have any knowledge took plaee
in the reign of King liise (5th Dyn.). At a later period, especially
under the Middle lhnpire, the quarries were diligently worked, and
even under the New Empire they were in operation. We hear of a
great undertaking under Ramses IV. for the purpose of procuring
blocks for the tmnple anmou M Thebes, in which no fewer than
8368 workmen and soldiers were employed. The quarries were
worked under Darius, Xerxes, and Amxerxes also.

Just beyond the quarries the mute turns from the NJ). to the S.
and passes the ruins of lEl-lr‘uwakhir ('the potsherds'), now in the
possession uf a British mining-company. Traces of the anniem open
workings and deep subterranean adits (now \cry difficult of access),
the foundations Mhundreds of workmen’s cottages, and numerous
inscriptions, bear witness to the former importance of thr place.

About ihr. beyond El-Fawékhir we reach BIT ts-Sidd, a small
and picturesqnely situated spring, adjoined by settlements of the
'Abibdeh. In 4 hrs. more we math the top of the pass of RM, on
the other side ot'whieh " descend through the midi Abu Sinm
to (3 hrs.) the Wadi lfu‘yafu, containing a large well, the water or
which, however, is considered nnwholesornc. The route now makes
a wide curve to the N. and at the plain of 'Liteima' reavhes the
dividing line between the mmml mountain range and the, outlying
chains consisting of Cretaceous sandstone and tertiary rocks (white
limestone). After 521/2 hrs. " pass through the W0di Beidu and
proceed to (3 hrs.) the Bir et-he/tis (dug h) English troops in 1800),

Kogeir (Qosm'r), on the Arabian Gulf. Kogeir is now an un-
important town of ib'00inlrah., the seat of aNa'nn1r (p. xlvii), with
a quay, a long wooden mole, two mosques, several bazaars, govern-
ment-buildings, and a telegraph-omce. In the Ptohyrnare period the
desert-route ended here at the Leukas Limen or 'White llarhour',
and in earlier times in the vicinity ofthe Wdd, Cras0s, nearihevillagc
of Samv, a little to the N. of l.ios.eir. About 3-i M. to the N. of

interesting and very attractive visit may be made to the rural reefs
which here skirt the shore and are easily avcessihle at tybb-tide.

On the relurn-journey (awards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly mule (therrcalled 'Niila Route'), diverging
