Y. HiER0aLYPBuhs. oxxvii

A great adranvc W; made when words, for which there was

no special sign, began lo be expressed by the pictures of other
and different objects, the phonetic signit1cauee " which, however,
happened to be the same. Thus, e.gt, pr 'to go out' was expressed by
the picture of a house E1, because a ‘house’ also was called pr;

 

g' 'son' by a 'goose' s'; tpy 'iirst' by the sign I (p 'dagger'.

Many of these, characters gradually came to be used for so many
ditTerent words that their original word-signiistion was lost, and
they thenceforth were used as of purely syllahic value. Thus, the
sign p', originally 'to ily', was afterwards used for the syllable p'
in any sipruicatio; "r, originally 'pigeon' and afterwards also TCr
'great', was used for any syllable um in this way word-signs also
came to be used as letters; mg. 0 r 'rnoutV Was used for ri
EZD s' 'lake' tbr s'; “j g-l 'aeryeut' (t is the feminine termina-
tion) for Fi etc.

These syllable and literal signs were probably used at tirst
for grammatical purposes only (as suiiihesj, but afterwards, owing
to frequent ambiguities in the sigrifrt'uamus of the verbal signs, they
were used to indicate the pronunciation; in each particular vase
and thus to render the reading easier. Thus to the sign Sir, IIT

'great' a sCC22> r was frequently added, written thus ' u-r,

in order to indicate the pronunciation; or 'nl, 'to live' was

followed by the two explanatory consonants mwm n and © Lt,
thus (i) 'tde; or U N: 'lord' was preceded by FFFFFh n, thus
"at," nb. Frequently all the consonants in a word were written

instead of merely the verbal sign, thus , 2 Isl) s'tt 'field' in-
stead of Q Q , JY.

In addition to thesethere was another class of hieroglyphivs,
known as Determinatives, which were placed after the word in
order to give some hint as to its meaning. Thus e g., su-r 'to

--
drink' is written se, tr with the determinative ' (a man with
0

his tInger in his mouth) in order to indicate that the idea expressed
by sulr has something to do with the mouth. These dcterminatives,
which greatly facilitate the reading of inscriptions, mere freely used,
especially in later hieroglyphic periods.

The hieroglyphic system, as we tind it in the earlier Egyptian
inscriptions, is already complete; its iievclsprnent, briefly skatuhed
above, had already come to a clos . The following different classes
of hieroglyphie characters were used simultaneously.
