chilly night-Mr, and if pastumge-gronml and a spring be within

see numerom lleduin families ot' the poorest class enmmpetl in
their tents, where they lire in the most frugal possible manner, with
a few miserable goats aud tlw fowls which subsist on the rubbish in
their neighbourhood. Though professors of lslim, the Beduins of
Egypt are emrsiderahly less strict in their Observances than the fel-
lahin ot' the olley of the Nile, who are themselves sui'i'un'ently lax,
and above all they sadly neglect the religious duty of cleanliness.
They do not observe the practice of praying tive times a day, and
they are as a rule but slightly acquainted with the Koran, lielirs
of their old star-worship can still be traced among their customs.

The traveller will oeeasionally ohserve lleduins in the streets and
in the bazaars of the artnonrers and leather-merchauts, and will be
struck with the proud and manlyhearing of these bronzed children
of thedesert, whose sharp, bearded features and steady gaze betoken
tiru1ness and resolution In Egypt the traveller need not {eat their
predatory propensities.

(4). ARAB DWBLLERS IN Towss. Those Arabs with whom the
traveller usually comes in eunmct in towns are shopkeepers, uth'cials,
servants, eoaehmcn, and dolccy-atteadants, These are generally
of a much more mixed origin than the fcllahin. It thus happens

complexion from dark-brown to white, with the features of the
worshippers of Osiris or the sharp yrotile of the lleduius, and with
the slender figure of the fcilah or the corpuleuce oi' the Turk.
Among the lower classes intermarriage with negre-woxuen has some-
times darkened the complexion and thickened the features or their
ol1'spring; while the higher ranks. including many deseeudants of
white slaves or Turkish mothers, more ncarlyreseruble the European
type. As the inhabitants of the towns could not he so much op-
pressed by their rulers as the peasantry, we tind that they exhibit
a more independent spirit, greater enterprise, and a more cheerful
disposition than the fellahin. At the same time they are not free
from the dreamy character peculiar to Orientals, nor from a tinge of
the apathy of tatalism; and their indoleuee contrasts strongly with
the industry of their European rivals in political, seirmtiiie, artistic,
and all business yursni l. Ot’late wars, however, they have begun
to occupy themselves with seientiiic studies and to produce a con-
sidernhlc number of higher oriicials, barristers, doctors, architects,
engineers, etc. The townspeople profess lsliun, but, in their
youth particularly. they are becoming more and more las in their
obedience tn the Koran. Thus the custom of praying in public, ont-
