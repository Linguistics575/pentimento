Conwnla/ SLSimwn. xssiris. 24. Route 361

The ruined *Convent of St. Simeon (Deir Anba SamaMrs) is situ..
ated on a hill in the desert on the W. bank of the Nilo. Landing
opposite the s. end ofElephantine, we follow a desert-Valle-sing
several r0ek-tomlrs, and in 20 min. reach our goal. Nothing eee
tain is known as to the date of the origin of the convent which was
destroyed by the expedition sent to Nubia by Saladin in 1173. It
stands surrounded by a wall, over 20 ft. high, the lower part of
which is built of rough stone, the upper part of crude bricks; the
lower W. portion is hewu out of the rock. The Mats BUILDING has
two stories. The lower story contains a large ventral vaulted coni-
dor, with cells opening " it on each side. On the W. wall of the
corridor is a painting (much defaced) of Christ enthroned, with the,
Archangel 11irthaiyl and six Apostles beside him. Each of the small
cells contained six or eight beds, some of which still remain. At
the N.W. angle is the tufeetory. The dilapidated staircase is con-
tinued in the S. angle to the next story, and thence to the moth -
Below the main building are several rock-hewn cells and a rock-
chape1,with a painted ceiling and pictures of saints.

To the SE, of the main building, between it and the girdle
wall, is the Cavncn, comprising nave and aisles and a choir with
sarristies on each side. The roof was vaulted throughout. In the
semi-dome of the (heir ls a tina painting of Christ enthroned, he-
tweeu four angels. At the W. and of the nave, opposite the chair,
is a domed recess with a fresco of Christ with two angels bowing
before him. There are numerous Coptin inscriptions in the sa-
cristies. - A Coptic service (comp. p. 107) is occasionally held in
this church

From the cement we may go along the ridge in a s. direction to
0/2 hr.) two High Chfs, one of which, looking from the Cataract
Hotel like a gigantic pig, is covered with inscriptions. In 10 min.
more we reach a hill of dark stone, which M1'ords a superb *VIEW
of the cataract district, extending on the S. to Philre and On the N. to
Gezireh fp. 341). A similar view is obtained from the tomb of
Shaikh Osman. - The direct route from the convent to the Nile
passes an extensive ruseropolis, on a plateau strewn with dark stones.
0n the river-bank are numerous rock-tomhs.

Another very interesting excursion may he made through the
Western Desert to the Quarries to the N. efthe Convent of St. Simeon
(there and back 2 hrs.). From the Rock Tombs (p. 358) we titst
follow the telogrsrph-posts and then a route, indicated by heaps of
stones, which runs to the N. to a Sandstone Quarry, still containing
the upper part of MI obelisk with a representation and inscription
of Sethos I. We return vii the village of Ghurb-Assuan (West Assu√©n)
to the landing-stops at the Rock Tombs (p. 359).

A favourite afternoon excursion leads to the N. from the station
