the W. bank, the desert advances clear up to the river-brink. The
population is in consequence very scanty, viz. 06,500 in 1807.
Comp. p. ix. - All the countries on the Upper Nile, from the
borders ofEgyptsor1tlswaNs, were included by the aucientEgyptians
under the single name of Koxh, the Cash of the Bible. The Greeks
and Romans called them Ethiopia. Lower Nubia was more particularly
known to the Egyptians as the land of Scti and consisted, as it does
to-day, of a number of separate districts (e. the land of Wewel).
The present inhabitants of Nubia are more faithful to their ancient
manners and customs than the Egyptians. When the huge storage-
lake, extending far into Northern Nubia, was formed by the dam at
Assuin, the villages within its basin were either deserted or re-
moved to the heights. This fact neconnts for the numerous ruined
villages seen under water or on the edge of the lake (comp. p. 384).

History. Lower Nubia, whence the Egyptians procured their
supplies ofincense and other products of the SMin, is mentioned
in some of the earliest Egyptian textet Its relations with Egypt were
still closer under the kings of the Gth Dyn., who there enlisted negro
mercenaries , while the princes of Elephantinc dispatched great
trading expeditions to the lands of the Upycr Nile. But it was not
until the period of the 12th1)yn. that the conquest ai'Nuhia was
undertaken and the borders of Egypt ad vatused to Semmh (p. 413).
In order to guard the newly acquired possessions against the attacks
of the negroes a chain of forts was erected in the rocky valley of Bath
rl<1§agar (p. M2), with its numerous catararts, between Haifa and
Seruneh. From this base the Pharaohs of the 18th Dyn. penetrated
still farther to the S. and made themselves masters of the land of
Kosh as far as Nupnla (p. 419), which then became the southernmost
nity of the empire. The conquered regions were "meoyporated with
the s0utluyrmu0st department ongypt proper, which began at El-Kinb
(p.353), and the whole of the great province thus farmed was placed
under an ofiieial who bore the title of ‘Prince of Kash and Governor
at the Sauthern Lands'. Under the established rule of Egypt Nubia
rapidly prospered; new towns were founded, and heautifu] temples,
little inferior in size and embellishment to those of the motherland,
arose in profusion, especially on the w. hank or the Nile, which
was safer from the attacks of the E. Beduins. Most of these temples
“ere dedicated to the great Egyptian gods, Amen, Ilci-1larakhtts,
and Ptah; but in some of them other deities also were worshipped,
such as Isis and others of the Egyptian gods, the local Nubian god
Tettm, the deceased King Sesostris 111., who united the riiles at
tirst conqueror and patron-saint of Nubia. and occasionally also the
reigning king and queen (pp.305, 308, 404, 408, 400). The temple
inscriptions were composed in the Egyptian language and written
in the Egyptian character, and Egyptian hecame the ofiieial lan-
guage, although the great mass of the people adhered to theirnative
Nubian tongue.
