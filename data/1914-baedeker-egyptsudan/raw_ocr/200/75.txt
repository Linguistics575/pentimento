d. Geology. POLITICAL NOTES. lxix

The t1uvio-inariaty deposits of Moghara (to the W. of the Widi
Natn‘m) and the silieified wood of the same district also belong to
these miacene times, as do also the marine limestones of the plateau
of Cyrenaica, to the N. of the Siwah Oasis and on the E. edge of the
Arabian Desert (at the foot of Gebel Geneifeh and Gebel 'Atil.rO,
and on the shore of the Gulf of Suez near 62138] Zeit.

The 'Petrified Forest' near Cairo consists of scattered fragments
of the silieitied stems of trees; and these, together with the red
sandstone of Gebe] el-Ahmar and conical hills of the same material
in the N. parts of the Arabian and Libyan deserts, are connected
with the siliceous thermal springs which bubbled forth amid the
network of lagoons which existed in these parts in Oligocene times.
To the NW. of the Birket fiartin, in the Faiytun, these fossil trees are
even more numerous, while in the sands of oligocene age innumer-
able bones of former terrestrial and marine mammals and reptiles
have been found, which were carried down by the river and buried
in its estuarine deposits. A tine collection of these fossil animals may
be seen in the Geological Museum at Cairo.

The cliffs of the Nile valley above Cairo consist of middle and
lower Eocene limestone, containing numerous nummulites (p. 116)
and other fossils. The strata are gently inclined to the N.N.W., so
that the strata increase in age as we go towards the S.

To the s. of Edfu begins thc upper cretaceous formation, here re-
presented by the sandstone which at Gehel Silsileh forms steep walls
of rouk and coutiues the river in a. narrow rhannel. This 'Nubian
Sandstone' covers an area of many thousand square miles, extending
from the oases to the Fhidin. At certain points, such as Assuin,
Kaléhsheh, Wadi Wlfa, and the third and fourth cataracts, ridges
of crystalline rocks (granite, gneiss, diorite, etc.) rise through it,
and form black or reddish hills in sharp contrast to the low tabular
masses of the sandstone.
1n the Amnuu or FASTER)! Desmu‘ (pp. 362, 372 er seq.) a
line of hills, some peaks of which are 7000 it. in l1eight,rans parallel
to the lied Sea and at short distance from it. This is wholly formed
talline rorks (granite, gneiss, diorite, horrrblerule-srlist, mica-
e , talc-schist and the andesites and allied rocks which form a
great series of very ancient volcanic rocks, theimperial porphyry ol’
Gcbcl Dukhin being a w0ll-known representative). The E. and W.
slopes of this range are orurlaid by sedimentary rocks, usually the
Nubian sandstone, but alsu (in the N. part) by limestones and mails.
These strtrtt'h away toward the w., forming a great plateau of lime-
stone in the N. and of sandstone in the S.) in which the Nile Valley
forms a narrow trough. Numerous deeply eroded valleys give a char-
acteristh: appearance to the Eastern Desmt, The open plains are
almost bare of vegntation, but numerous plants may be seen in the
valleys, especially after rain, while in the sheltered ravines amnng
the hill: where springs occur they grew Iusuriautly.
