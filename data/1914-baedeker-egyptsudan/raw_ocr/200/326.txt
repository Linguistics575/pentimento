From the Bah trlqartrfeh the AQUEDUCT (Arab, Elvlfandtir), built
by Sultan Et-0iiri and formerly ascribed to Saladiu, runs in a wide
sweep towards the Nile (see p. 104). It supplied the citadel with
water before the construction of the new Waterworks.

8. The Mohattem Hills.

An excursion to the lluhettam Hills is best made from the citadel (tram
ways Nos. 2, 6, and 13, to the Place Saladin, see p. 38). The route from
the Tombs of the Caliphs is to be avoided on account of the intolerable
dust. The excursion may be combined with the visit to the smaller Petrified
Forest in the manner indicated at p.i19, The Wew is one of the most
beautiful that Egypt has to otter. and no energetic traveller should be
sausiled with the substitute: atfor6ed by the citadel (near the mosque "
Mehammed Ali, see p. 69) at the Windmill Hills (p. 114), It is best at
sunset m- in the morning between 8 and , o‘clock A visit at the time of
the full moan is attractive also.

From the Citadel (y. 68) the mute ascends in an almost straight
direction, passing through the Bab el-Gebel (P1. F, 6; p. 70) and
ever the railway-bridge. About 'lshr. brings us to the top.

The Mohattem or Moqattum Hills (666 ft. high), to the E. of
Cairo, also called Gebel Ch'ytishi, after the cimspiouous mosque situat-
ed on the summit, belong to the great range of nummulitie lime-
stone mountains which extend from N.\V.Africa, across Egypt and
India, to China. This nummulite formation is one of the eoceue, or
oldest deposits of the tertiary period. It yields a favourite building-
stone) and there are numerous quarries on the slopes of the hills.

Nnmmulitic limestone is remarkably rich in fossils, the chiefmass of
which consists of millions of uut1uuulites " rhiwpods of the pelythala‘
mia group, The larger kinds are about an inch and a half in diameter
and the smaller about 1/s iaryh. They are frequently seen also in the
stones of the Pyramids, part of the material for which was taken from
tho quarries of the Itlolgattam. The quarries yield alga a profusion orsea-
urchins Celypetrster, cideris, esshirurlsrnpss, etc.), various kinds of bivalves
(including many oysters), cerithium, ovula, strumbus, nerite, turritella.
naumus, sharks, teeth, and bones of tho halieore. Beautiful crystals of
isinglasrsume end of etruntiau also occur.

The “VIEW from the top is magiiiiisseut and in a good light is
tituyr than any other in the neighbourhood of Cairo. The citadel,
the mosque of Muhammad Ali, and the grand burial-grounds of the
desert form a noble foreground; the venerable Nile dotted with its
lateen sails i10ws below us in its quiet majesty; to the W., on the
borders of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous
old Pyramids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. The thousand
minarets of the city and the citadel are then also tinted with a
delicate rosy hue. A still more varied view is commanded by a
steep projection to the S. of the mosque, the foreground being
especially piotrtresque, while the horizon to the S. seems more open
and tempts our fancy to visit the wonders of Upper Egypt.

'_The Giyitshi Mosque, one of the oldest in Cairo, was built in
1085, during the Fatimite period, by the Emir Badr el-Garm‘tli, the
grand vizier of Sultan El-Mustanyir. According to tradition he
