together by bands at the top, while between these stems smaller
clusters of three, fastened together by bands, were inserted. These

 

inserted stems, however, lost their
independent treatment at an early
period. - Towards the close of the
18th Dyn. the clustered p11pyri1s-
column underwent an essential
change. In order to adapt the shaft
for the reception of inscriptions and
pictures, all its irregularities were
abandoned and it was made per-
fectly smooth. For the same reason
the capital also was rounded off and
transformed into a blunt cone, the
original clustering being recalled
by painting alone (Fig. IVh). -
Papyrus-columns with ealyx-ioapi-
tale (Fig. Va; representing the
opened umbel of the flower), in
which it is diffi011lt to distinguish
between simple and clustered col-
umns, occur in most temples of the
New Empire, where they generally

, T appear supporting the lofty roof of

the central passage in such hypo-
style halls as consist of nave and
aisles. They invariably consist of

a single rounded shaft, no longer articulated into separate stems
(and generally covered with inscriptions and reliefs).
