which were discovered at Deir cl-Buhri (p. 305] in 1891. These data
from the period of the 2ist and 22ml Dynasties. Each corpse had
an outer antien inner wooden cothu, both in the shape of a mummy
and covered with yellow varnish. The arms are crossed over the
breast, the men having their fists clenched while the hands of
the women are open. The women wear round earrings. The mummy
was generally enveloped in a kind of cover (cartonnage) forming a
full - length representation of the deceased. in many cases old
sarcophagi (19th and 20th Dyn.) have been used, and the original
names replaced by new ones,
