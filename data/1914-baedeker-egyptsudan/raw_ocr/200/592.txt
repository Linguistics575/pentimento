9. Medinet Hahut

About 1M. from Deir el-Medineh and 1,2 M. from the Meumou
colussi (p. 330), in a conspicuous situation, lies the southernmost
templo»gr0up of the Thehan Necropolis. This bears the name of
Medinet Hahn ('town of Habu'), a Christian village which arose
around and even within the ancient sanctuary as early as the 5th
cent., and of which considerable traces still remain.

The entire edifice may be divided into two easily distinguished
portions. One oftliose is a smaller and older temple ofthe 18th Dyn-
asty (p. 328), afterwards enlarged. The other is the main temple
of Ramses III. (p. 323), which was enclosed by a nrenelated wall,
13 ft. high. We pass the pylon and other buildings in front of the
small temple and visit first the structure of lhunses.

We pass through the outer "all by means of a Crate (PI. A),
nhout13 ft, wide. ihmlred by two small Porter‘s Lodges. Beyond these
we are confronted by the remarkable edifice resembling the gateway
of a fortress and known as the -

High Gate or Pavilion ofRamses Hi., which forms the entrance
to the tempIe-prerincts instead ofthe usual massive pylon and portals
of stone. This structure interrupts the great inner wall of brink
which enclosed all the temples within a rectangle and was connected
with the royal palace fp. e/VO. The pavilion thus formed a part of
the palace, which stood at some distance from it. Its apartments
were occasionally used as a residence by the Pharaoh and his harem
and were decorated accordingly (comp. p. 323). 'l'wo tall towers
(PLh e), with almost imperceptibly sloping walls and with their 1%.
sides resting upon a battering foumlation-wall, enclose a narrow
court, gradually contracting towards the back, Where there is a gate-
way (PL a) in the central erection joining the towers. The reliefs on
the Fasurde of Me Right Tower (Pl. b) show the king suiting his foes
in presence ofll arakhte; below are seven fettered princes, represent-
ing the vanquished peoples (Kheta or IIittites, Emor or Amorites,
Zakari, Shardana or Sardinians, Shakalasha 0r Sicilians, Tuirsha 0r
Tyrrheuians, and Peleste or Philistines; c0mp.pp. 324, 325). On the
Facade afthc Le/t Tower (Plus) is a corresponding {1 Ire of Ramses
smiting his Nubian and Libyan foes before Aru0n-R6.

In the Court between the towers are two seated figures of the
lion-headed goddess Sekhmet, in black granite (found in front of
the gate). On the walls, between the first and second stories, are
some curious cous0les or brackets, which are adorned with the busts
of four captive enemies, amliifouucrly bore statues of the king. The
reliefs on the walls are mostly svrritieial in character.
