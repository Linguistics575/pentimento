The ihirnir en-Nhgir (P1. I",6) was erected in 1317 by Sultan
En-Nis.ir. Long used as a military magazine and storehouse, it is

miuarets are surmounted by bulbous cupolas adorned with bright-
coloured fayence tiles in the Persian style. The sadly misused Iiwéns,
in the construction of which some line ancient Byzantine columns

in front of the praycr-rccess rests upon ancient Egyptian granite
columns, but only the drum now remains.
