From the SI}. corner of the Place Méhimet Ali we reach the

leads hence to the S., passing the European Haspilel (PI. F, d, 5),
the Armenian Church (Pl. F,5), and the Cott'eye St. Francois Xavier,

uomp. p. 21), the largest well-preserved relic of antiquity in the

around lie fragments ofRomau buildings and other objects revealed
by the extensive excavations begun by ltotti (p. 21) and continued
by the Von Sieglin Expedition C180S-l002) and by Brcccia (p. 21;

The height of the column, including the rectangular pedestal and
the Corinthian capital, is 88 ft.; the shaft, 68 ft. high, is about
0 ft. in diameter at the bottom and not quite 8 ft. at the top. The
foundations, composed of several blocks (one with the name and
tigure of Sethus 1., p. eiii) which once belonged to other bulilings,
are much damaged. 0n the W. side is a mueh-defaced inscription
in honour of the Emp. Diocletian, placed here in 292 A.D. by a
Roman prefect named Posidius. The latest theory in regaxd to the
cnlumn, which may once have belonged to the Temple of Serapis,
is that it, was erected here by the Emp. Theot1osius to commemorate
the victory of Christianity and the destruction of the Seiapeum
