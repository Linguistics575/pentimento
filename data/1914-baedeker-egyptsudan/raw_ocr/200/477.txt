railway station and hotel of Baliana (p. 22t-, 15 Mas., with bakshish of
5 pies.) Carriage there and back, with star of 2 hrs., SEI.

Abydos lies about 61/2 M. from Baliana, a ride of t-t% hr.
The traek crosses the railway a little to the N. of the station and
follows the telngraph-wires along an embankment. Beyond the
hamlet of F2-l.legu it crosses a canal, traversus a fertile district dot-
ted with numerous villages, and reaches the village (2400 inhabi) of
Et-'Aniba orrAr0ba et-i1fudffsneh (Le. 'huriedrAriba'), on the other
side of the Yasreh Canal. The view of the well-cultivated and popu-
lous plain, and of the mountains to the E., is very ilne. 0a the
verge of the arable land lay the ancient Abydos, which extended
from ‘Aréba to EI-Kherheh o. 243),

Abydos (Egypt. Abotu) was one of the most anrient cities in
ligypt and played an important r6le under the first dynasty as the
buriai-plaee of the kings and grandees. The town and its necropoiis
were both devoted to the worship of the dog-formed death-god
Khente-Amentiu, ‘the first of the inhabitants of the Western King-
dom'. Even under the Ancient Empire, however, the cult of Osiris
[which originated in the Delta) made good its footing at Abydos.
Osiris took possession of the ancient temple and was raised to an
equality with Khente-Amentiu. The tomb of Osiris was transferred
to Umm el-Gn'éb, and in the days of the 6th Dynasty it became
usual to inter the dead from all parts of Egypt at Ahydos. Just as
the Shiite Mohammedan cherishes no dearer wish than to be buried
near the tomb of Iioseiil (p. 54] at Kerbela, so the pious Egyptian
desired no better fortune than to have his corpse carried to Abydos,
there to tiud its last Abode beside the tomb of Osiris. Those who
were unable to do this, or who had built tombs elsewhere, often
unused their mummies to be brought temporarily to Abydos, to re-
ceive the desired consecration and to spend some time at least
with Osiris. Many contented themselves with merely erecting a
memorial stone or a reuotaph iu the uecropolis, thereby assuring
to themselves the favour of Osiris, the lord of the underworld. -
Isis, the wife of Osiris, his son Horas, and, under the New Empire,
Ptah, Harakhtc, and Amen were likewise worshipped there.
