followed by her guardian-spirit, dedicates to Amen the spoils of
the expedition; the cattle feeding beneath the trees are especially
worthy of notice. At PLi gold and other precious metals are being
weighed in presence of the goddess Seshet, who records the results;
Horus presides at the wales, and behind him is the Nubian god
'l'etun, Below we see the incense being measured, while Thout
notes down the results; close by are seven incense-trees in tubs,
imported from Punt. At P1. It I'hutmosis III. offers incense to the
boat of Amou, which is home by priests. At Pl.l is Hatshepsut

beneath a canopy, with her guardian-spirit behind her. In front
are her grandees, to whom she is speaking, and a long inscription.

At the left (S.) eml of the Punt Colonnade is a SHBINB 01'
anoe, goddess of the necropolis at Thebes o. cl), which was
originally reached also from below by a flight ofsteps. The inner-
most chambers are preceded by two covered Colonnade: (now in
ruins). The first of these had sixteen-sided columns and square
pillars with Hathor-capitals; the second, which lies at a slightly
higher level, had round IIathor columns (three of them in partial
preservation) and also sixteen-sided columus(six partly remaining).

There are still a few Wall Decorations in the second colonnade. Un the

We ascend two steps to the Shrine proper, which comprised three
roelr-hewrt chambers (Pl. A, B, C), each one step higher than its
predecessor and containing several recesses. The ceiling ofRaomA,
which is decorated with stars on a blue ground, is supported by two
sixteen-sided columns. The reliefs, which those who heveleisure may
examine, show Hatshepsut (everywhere defaced) or Thutmosis IH.
before various deities. -- Room B contains *Wall Reliefs of unusual
beauty. They represent Hatshepsut (chiselled out) presenting oiter-
ings of all kinds to the Hathor-ww, which stands in a boat beneath
a canopy. The traces of a. second and smaller figure of the queen,
represented as imbibing milk from the udder of the cow, are still
visible. The little nude boy, holding a sistrum, in front ofthequeeu,
