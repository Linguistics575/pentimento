level in technical ability as well as in ornamentation must be looked
for in the early collapse of the great empire of the Caliphs, in the
uncertain political circumstances of the period that followed, in
climatic and geological conditions, in the intluenee of superstition,
and in the characteristic oriental Ieudency to adhere with obstinate
fidelity to ancient forms and to Ieaveunaltered anything once accom-
plished. llowexer much admiration the amhesque may excite, how-
ever great an influence it may exert on industrial art, we still miss'
in it the reproduction of living beings, the contemplation of which
invites, as it were, an intelligent and active sympathy.

In the period of the Tulunides, when Persian infltumety made
itself felt even in the religious conceptions ongypt, portraits were
painted and coloured wooden statues erected in the palaces. But no
long period elapsed before the prohibition of the Sunna (p. lxxxv)
against the representation of anyliviug being again came into force.
Ieprnsentations of this kind are therefore very rare, and are now to
be found preserved only in the low reliefs "awed by Persian sculptors
of the Shiite sect. Statues and paintings have disappeared without
leaving a trace. Painting and sculpture in modern Egyptian art
have been lesened excln<ively for the decoration of wall surfaces'
