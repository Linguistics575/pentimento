122 Route J. BARRAGE DU NIL.

The object of the *Barmge du Nil, the largest structure ot
the kind in the world after the Assmin Dam o. 371), is to keep
the water-level in the Delta uniform in all seasons, so as to ob-
viate the necessity for the old irrigation machinery, with its great
expenditure of lahour, and to remove the difileulties of naviga-
tion during the three months when the Nile is at its lowest.
The work was begun under Mohammad Ali, about 1835. Linunl
Bey proposed to alter the course of the river and to build a weir
farther to the N., where the eontiguration of the ground appeared
more favourable; but his plan was Judged toa costly and was reject-
ed in favour of one proposed by a French engineer named Mougel
Bey, The cost of establishing foundations in the shifting soil of
the Delta, however, far exceeded the estimates; and, after all, the
erection was found to be too insecure for its intended purpose. For
nearly twenty years after 1867 the Barrage lay useless, as a costly
failure; hut in I885M)O Sir Colin &ott-lfomarielr successfully com-
pleted it at a cost of 460,000l., so that now a depth of water of
about I'? ft. can be maintained in the W. branch of the Nile. in
consequence of a hurst in thewinter of1909-10 considerable streng-
thening works became necessary, which are not yet quite tlnished.

Nearest the station are the Weirs on the Raw]: et-Tautty and
on the E. (Damietta) Branch of the Nile. The latter weir is over
500 yds. in length and has (58 vertical iron sluices. From the
farther end a pretty avenue of iehbakh- trees leads across the
isthmus (about 1/2 M. wide) between the arms, in the middle of
which is the Rayty et-Mena/heh, constructed both for irrigation and
for communication with the district of Jfentif?veh (p. 33). The Weir
an Hy: Mr. (Rosetta) Branch ofthe Nile is about 480 yds. across and
has 53 Vertical iron sluicos. Farther to the w. is a fourth Weir, on
the Jlal.irntidtyeh Canal, constructed a few years ago. The navigation
of the river is carried on by means of spacious basins and locks,
titted with swing-bridges, at either end ot' the two weirs and also on
the Rayils el-Mirror-ell. The superstructure: of the works are built
in an effective Norman castellated style. A jumrtiou-ear1aiabove the
weirs connects the two branches of the Nile, and is used to regulate
the depth of water in each. When the river is low the W, hunch
receives all its water through this ranal.

The island, formexly occupied by fortifications, is now covered
with attractive and extensive *Gardem, laid out with flower-beds,
artiiiiyial woke, eto., by Mr. Draper, an 'mglishman. - In the gar-
den is a Museum, with models of the various water-works of Egypt.

If not pressed for time the traveller should visit the little Arab
village of Shala.kdn which stretches along the river near the Barrage
station. A charming and picturesque impression orEgyptian coun-
try-life is obtained here on market-days.
