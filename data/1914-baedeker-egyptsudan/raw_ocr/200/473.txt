Assit2.t or 5m, the name of which still preserves the ancient
Egyptian Syaut, enjoyed eonsiderable importance, even in anti-
quity, cliietlyowrng to its favourably situation in the midst of an ex-
tensive and fertile plain, 121/2 M. in width, between the Libyan and
theArabiau mountains, and at the beginning ofa great caravan route
leading to the oases in the Libyan desert (ll. 26) and thence to the
bidin. Assi0t, however, seems to have been oflittle prominence
politically. The town was the capital of the Upper Sycamore Nome
and the chief seat of the worship of the god Wepourrret, who was
represented as a wolf of the desert This latter circumstance gave
rise to the Greek name Lyeopotis, or 'wolf towu'. The modern
Assifig, which extends for about 3 M. from E. to w., is the largest
town (39,442 inhab., exclusive 01'4664 in Ki-i ulna] in Upper
Egypt, the capital of a province (768 sq.M.; pop., including the,
oases of llékhleh and Khitrgch, 903,335), and the residence of the
Uiidir. Its manufacturing industry is not unimportant. Among the
chief products am: tine red glazed pottery (bottles, pipe-howls, eta],
inlaid wood (tables, caskets, walkiug-stiuks), ivory carvings, eul-
hmiderml leather goods, and the white and black tulle shawls, with
gold or silver embroidery, which am so often bought by European
ladies. Natron, soda. and grain are also among the principal exports.
The streets and haunts are full ofhusy life, espr‘ -iully on Tuesdays,
when the people of the neighbourhood Mrrk into the market.-
