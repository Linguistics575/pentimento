THE SUEZ CANAL. History.

a. Isthmus of Suez and History of the Suez Canal.

The Isthmus of Suez, a neck ofland which cnnnects Africa wi
Asia, is at its narrowest part TO M. in width. 0n the b. side it
washed by the N. part of the Gulf of Suez (Arab. Barr Kolzm
Greek Heraiipolitc Bay), the western of the two arms of the ll
Sea, which separates Africa and Asia. The idea of a Suez Canal
no modern conception. The earliest authenticated attempt to co
neet the Red Sea with the Nile (and thereby with the5feditearanea
was made by echa Cp. av], His plan was to extend towards tl
S., from Lake 'l'irnsil1 to the Red Sea, an earlier canal, in existen
