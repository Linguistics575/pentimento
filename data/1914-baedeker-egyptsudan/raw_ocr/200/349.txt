only, expandin by a fw i. chcs at the outer extremities. The N.
shaft is 233 ft., and the S shaft 174 ft. long.

We now retrace our steps and, an emerging from these awe
inspiring recesses, hail the light and air with no little satisfaction.

The other chambers as yet discovered it: the interior of the Great
Pyramid are inaccessible. The first passage a bv, which is biotked at b,
leads downwards in a straight line, 293 ft, in length, and terminates in a
horizontal corridor, 27 ft. in length, [Jrt, in height, and 2 ft. in width,
which leads to the 1uttin'rsiusd subterranean chamber s, hewu in the rock.
The E. and W. sides of this chamber are each 46 ft. in length, the Ne
and S. sides 27 rt., end the height 101/211. It does not lie in a line
with the diagonal of the Pyramid and its floor is 1011/: ft. below the
level on which the Pyramid is huilt. The subterranean horizontal pass-
age 1, to ft. long, ends in a erU.6e-stru. The statement of Herodotus, that
the subterranean chamber planned by Kheops for the reception of his
body was surrounded by a canal conducted hither from the Nile, is er-
roneous, as the chamber lies above the highest level of the overt1ow of
the river, and it has, moreover, been ascertained that no channel (mm the
river ever led in this direction. - From the lower end of the Great Hall
a shut, discovered by Dtvisan in 1763, descends to the lower passage
The enterprising Ciwigr1s(p.N0fos1nr1 that it terminlted in the passage (1')
leading to the srrhterranean chimera). To all appearmce it was bored
through the masonry after the letter had heeu tiaiglled.

To the E. of the Pyramid stood the Temple for the worship of
the deceased (p. clxix], such as was erected in the case of every
pyramid. Nothing of this now exists, however, except some Tem-
nants of the basaltic pavement. The neighbouring depressions known
as 'mortar-pits' (marked m on the Plan at p. 123) are natural elefts
in the rock, some of which have been lined with slabs of stone. -
On the E. side lie also Three Small Pyramids intended for relatives
of the king. The middle one of these (I on the Map) is said by
Herodotus to have been the tomb of a daughter of Kheops. That to
the s., according to an inscription in the Museum of Cairo, likewise
belonged to a daughter of Kheops, named Ilanwetsen. - At the E.
base of the small pyramid to the S. lies a small Sanctuary of his
(o on the Map), the 'mistress of the Pyramid', Which was erected by
King Psusennes (Mst Dyn.) It is in a very ruinous condition,
nothing remaining except a few stumps of columns.

The Second Pyramid , called by the Egyptians Wer-Khefré
(Wreat is KhefrE’), was erected by kheYe, who was called thphren
by the Greeks (p. xcix). Owing to the greater height of the rocky
plateau on which it stands, it appears higher than its larger neigh-
bour. The perpendicular height of this Pyramid is now 4471/9 ft.
[originally 471 ft), each side of the base measures 0901/2 ft. Cori-
ginally 7073/4 ft. , and the height of each sloping side is 563Wit.
(originally 5721 git.), while the sides rise at an angle of 52°20.
The solid content of the masonry is now 2,156,960 cubic yds., egui-
valent to 4,883,000 tons in weight (originally 2,426,710 cub. yds.,
equivalent to 5,309,000 tons). As the rocky site rises towards the
W. and N, a considerable part ofit required to be removed in or-
der that a level surface might be obtained [see p.137), while the
