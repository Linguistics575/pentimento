sprang up, beside the imposing royal abode Mose the dwellings of
the nobles, and hardly tombs were prepared for the king and his
favourites in the hills to the east. But after the death ofAmenophis
the ancient religion once more obtained the upper hand, the court
returned to Thebes, and the new town rapidly decayed. Its life
had hut lasted for more than 50 years, and the site upon which it
stood was never again occupied. Owing to this circumstance the
ancient streets and grouud-plans have remained to this day and
may be traced with little trouble (comp. below). The religious re-
volution under Arnenophis IV. was accompanied by a revolution in
art. The artists who worked in his reign, probably feeling them-
selves more independent of ancient traditions, attempted to lend
their creations a more natural expression. In many cases, however,
they fell into exaggeration, as, for example, in the representations
of the lean form of the king. The tombs ofEl-rAmama contain the
best examples of this realistic tendency and are, therefore, of great
importance in the history of art.

About 1/2 hr. to the N. of Et-Till aro the ruins of the city and
or the Palace afAmencphis IV. Its tine stucco pavements, diseov-
ered by Flinders Petrie in 18M-02, were' mthlessly destroyed in
1912 (fragments in the museum at Cairo, see p. 86). - To the E.
lay the Archives, in which in 1888 the celebrated clay tablets of
Tell el-‘Amama with cuneiform inscriptions were found (now in
the British Museum and the museums of Berlin and Cairo; comp.
p. 89); these are letters Written to kings Arnenophis III. and IV.
by Babylonian and other kings of W. Asia and by Syrian and Plue-
nician vessels, and are of the greatest historical value. - The por-
tion of the city that has, so far, been excavated by the German Orient
Society lies 11/2 M. to the N. of the offiee o. 'Mt), where permission
to visit the excavations is obtained. If time permit, the travelier
should see the well-preserved [louse of the High Priest Pe-woh,
airording as it does ll typical example of the ground-plan of an
upper-class Egyptian dwislling-house (comp. pp. cixi, cixii). He
may visit also the llama of u Furm-BaiM, where the laying-out of
the garden is still recognizable. the House of the Sculptor Thutmase,
with workmon's dwellings, and lastly a large granary. Some of the
houses have well-preserved bathrooms and lavatories.

From the palace we proceed to the N.E,, passing the site of the

Great Temple, and in 3/4 hr. we leach the North Group of Tombs.
The rock»tomhs of Tell el-rAmarara are essentially the same in point
of structure as the tombs of the 18th Dyn. ntThehes (p. 309). Each is iru-
mediately preceded by aForecam'l, which Was generally surrounded by n.
brick wall. Thence a wide door admits to the Main Chamber, the moi“ of
which is in many cases supported by columns. The Chamber containing
the statue of the deceased is next reached, either by another door. or by
ll corridor Which frequently leads first to a narrow enteroom. Many hr
the tombs are unhnished, in consequence of the ileath of Amenophis IV,
and the subsequent return of the court to Thebes. - The tombs (in holh
groups) are marked with black numbers (1115), running from N. to s.
