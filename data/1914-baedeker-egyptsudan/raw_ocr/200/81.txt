5. Tero:s Axi) PLANTATIDNS. The extensive planting of trees
since the middle of the 19th cent. has introduced a new feature into
the Egyptian landscape, In ancient times most of the timber re-
quired for ship-building and other purposes seems to have been
imported from abroad. Mohammed Ali, a greet patron of horti-
culture, at one time oirereil prizes for the planting oftrces, but his
efforts were unattended with success, as the climatic and other difii-
culties attending the task were then bat imperfectly understood in
Egypt. Ibrahim followed the example ofhis predecessor, but'Mrbisl.
oml Sa'id were sworn enemies to trees of every hind, and they were
content that their palaces should be exposed to the full glare of the
sun. A new epoch, however, began when the Khedive IsuWil suin-
moned to Egypt M. Barillet tn ik)), superintendent of the gardens
of Paris, one of the most skilful landscape-gardeners of the day.
The finest of the shade-trees, both on aenonnt ofits urnlrrageous'uess
and the excellence of its wood, and one which thrives admirably, is
the lebbakh (Albizzia Lehbek), which has long been erroneously
called by travellers the acacia of the Nile (the latter being properly
the Jurs.t tree). Within forty years the lebhnhh attains a height of
St) ft. and a great thickness, while the branches project to a long
distance over the roads, covering them with a dense leafy canopy
within a remarkably short time Among the most important of the
other kinds of trees thus planted are the maguitieenr 'Flamboyer
des Lldes' (Poinciana puleherru11a), the rapidly-growing Jacaranda,
Casuarina, and Eurralyptus, tropical iig-trees, and several tam
varieties of palms.
