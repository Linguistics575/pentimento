Extensive excavations were made here in 1910-12 by the Oxford
Expedition under Dr. Griffith. - On the W. bank our attention is
attracted by the curious dunes extending between the villages and
the desert expanse and consisting of sand and the pointed leaves of
tamarisks. In the river lies Geziret Fares, a large island, known as
Artikurgu ('rich island') by the Nubians.

Opposite the S. end of the island, on the W. bank, lies the
village of Aksheh, with the remains of a small temple built by
Ramses H.

5ubian villages. It is the rapital of the province of the same name
