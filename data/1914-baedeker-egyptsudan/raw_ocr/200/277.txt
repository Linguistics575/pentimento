The Prayer Recess (H. 5) has tine Byzantine capitals and remains
of gilded mosaie. Thewooden eupola over it has lately been restored.
The Pulpit erected by Sultan Jil-Mans) (p. 71) in 1298 is still
noticeable, though it has been robbed of its oharaeteristie panels
aarvetl in ebony and ivory. These were sold in Europe and some
ot' them are now in the South Kensington Museum.

The large Minarel (l'l.7), in the N.W. outer court, dates from
a later period and is perhaps a reproduction ot' a tower at Samann
(m the Tigris. It is built of stone, instead of brick, and also shows
peculiarities in its square lower section and t-lsewhere. The horse-
shoe arches at the entrance are particularly tine. The ascent is easy,
and the top commands an admirable *View. To the S, are the pyra-
mids of Dahsini: and to the W. the huge pyramids of Gizeh; the
valley of the Nile as far as the Delta lies before us; to tho Ji, rise
the picturesque slopes of the Mokattam and the Citadel; in the
foreground all round lies ('m’ro, with its houses, mosques, palaces,
and gardens; to the N., at the foot of the minaret, is the Medreseh
Farghutrnash. -- From the minaret access is gained to the concrete
roofs of the liwéns, protected by elegant halustrades; a walk round
these is recommended for a full appreciation of the view.

"Medreseh Khit Bey (Pl. C), 7], which was erected in li75 and
has been recently restored by llerz-Pasha. It is cruciform in ground-
plau, and its rich and elegant forms afford .1 good example of the
style current under the second Mamcluke dynasty (p, clxxx). The
minaret is one of the most graceful in Cairo, The pulpit is richly
embellished with w0ot1-earving. 'l'he mosaics on the pavement and
the tine ornamentation of the walls also are worthy of notice. The
dome is modem.

The Shirir Bir ol-Wat,twit leads to the E. from the Shiri' Ihll
Tultin, at thehlosque of’l'ull’lu, to the Sss1utrrireli1rmyzmr till. D,7),
