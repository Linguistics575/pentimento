398 Route 28. ES-SEBO‘A.

The village of Es-Sebu‘a (‘the lions) also ralled Siboo, consists
of two parts, one on each bank of the Nile. The steamboat touches
at the E. bank. 0n the W. bank, amid the tauny desert-sand, lies
the TEMPLE ox: Es-Smnfu, called by the Egyptians Per-Amun ('House
of Amon’). This temple was dedicated to Amon and ilCrHarakhte
by Ramses IL, and is constructed on the same plan as the temple at
Giuf-l.lusein (p. Mu). Ramses himself also was worshipped here as
a god. An avenue of Slatues of Ramses II. and Sphinwes leads from
a ruined brick pylon to the temple. The modern name of the place
is derived from these sphinxes. The entrance to the temple is
termed by a well-preserved stone PYLON (32 ft. high, 42 ft. broad),
in front of wht l stood several colossal statues of Ramses IL (one
of whirh is still erect). The sadly weatherworn reliefs on the front
of the pylon-tnwers represent the king smiting his foes, in presence
of Ré-Hamkhte and Amon-RE). The reliefs embellishing the
jambs of the, central dooway show the king saeritleirtg to various
deities. The large COURT, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. To
the right and left are eolonnades, each with 5 pillars, against which
stand e0l0ssal figures of the king. The reliefs on the walls, repte-
senting the king in the usual scenes of intercourse with the gods, are
poorly executed and ot'Ter no special interest. The stone basins for
the ceremony of puritieation should be observed.

The following Gnu mu. begins the rockrhewn portion of the temple.
The ceiling of this is supported by 12 pillars, of which are edjtuiued
hy colossal tigures of l‘tamscs. The following TRAN: ER 1 hum! is mljninml

is decorated with falcons" hFads. On the lctt wall he otters sncriuces
before the hunt of Amon, which is adorned With rants' heads. on the
rear wall zvppe 's the boat of the sun. in Which the Cara-headed sua-god
Rrrllarakhte sits beneath a enhupy, worshipped by the king (on the left)
and three apes [0n the righLL Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines
of statues of the three gods or the temple (Amen, Ramses Il., and Re-
":tmkhte) may still he made out, although a figure of St. Peter, with a
halo and a large key, hits bean painted over that in the centre; for this
temple, like many others, wztx at one time used as th Christian ehurch.
