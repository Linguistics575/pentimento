further to the s., theln began to decline; and although it nfterwiude
hecame the seat of the court mure than once and though it remained
throughout the religious centre of the kingdom, it never re 'ined its former
prosperity. The extant ruins include many pyramids, differing from those
0f Egypt by their slender form, and several temples, of which those built
by Ramses II. and by Taharka are specially noteworthy. Cailliaud ex-
plated the site in 1822 and Lepsius in 1844 and extavmiuns are now being
made under the auspices of the University of Oxford.

of Ihe government buitdins, erected on the remains of e medizcvel for-
tress, which was, in its rum, hnin with the stones or an ancient edilieis.
Among the ruins is an altar dedicated by Piankhi, the Ethiopian king. _
On the left bank, about 6 M. above Abu Dam, is the pyramid-held of
Halal, a group of at least two dozen pyramids, prohhbly older than those
of the Gebe] Barkal. They are built of soft sandstone and are much
weather-warn. Close by is the village at Nari. - Tangnm', 0n the left
bank, the next steamboat station, is the scene on Tues. at one of the
largest markets in the chiirria. In the neighbourhuod are some ancient
pyramids; and on the opposite bank lies the pyramid-field of EHi'urru.
Ahuut 8/. hr. farther on, near the village or zenm, an the right bank, is
another grlrup of mare than thirty pyramids. - Still further tn the s.w.
in the Nile valley, on the lett bank, about 30 M. from Merowe, lies K071i
(rest-bose), which was General Wulselva's headquarters in Dec., ISM,

Beyond Abu Hamed the railway ascends the valley of the Nile
0n the border line between the 'Almt‘tr (steppe) on the E. and the
cultivable belt on the rivet-bank on the W. The latter is marked
by palm-trees and, lower down, by a bushy undergrowth. Between
Nov. and Jan. the verdant strip reminds one of the bank of the Nile
in Egypt. - In the settlements on the banks we now for the ilrst
time see the typical round straw huts(tuku1) of Central Africa, with
their pointed roofs and airy 'reeutas' or porches.
