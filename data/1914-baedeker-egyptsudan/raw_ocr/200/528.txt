From the court of the Temple efRamses we pass through the E.
door to the Portico of the Jhtbastides, situated at the SE. corner of
the great court. This portico was embellished with reliefs and in-
seriptions by the kings of the mud Dynasty.

The following reliefs may be particularized. To the left (E.; on the
projecting wan), above: Amon hands King Osorkon I. the curved sword
and the _,',e11i)'T,"'lh,f,Ti"ai,',e1, of longlife); helm . Khnum holds the hiera-

Secend Pylon of Ramses L The tower on the right, with font
long grooves for the ilarstairs, has been freed from the ruins of
later buildiags.whieh were erected in front of it out ofthe materials
of a temple of the heretical period (comp. p. cii). The left tower is
to be laid bare later. In the centre is the huge portal. On the S.
side of the right tower appears Ramses Ir. defeating his fees in pre-
sence of Amon. In front of the portal was a kind of small Vealibule,
the entrance to which was t1anked by two statues of Ramses H. The
tigartr on the right side still stands; only the legs of the other figare
remain. In the doorway, where the cartouches of Ramses L, Sethos L,
and Ramses II. are found, an intervening door was erected by Pto-
lemy VI. Philometor endPtolemy IX. Euergetes IL, during their joint
reign. The lime] of this doorway is wanting, but the jemhs are in
good preservation, with reliefs showing the king saeriiieing to the
gods of the temple. On the inner side (left) of the earlier doorway,
at the foot, are the sacred boat of Amen and the king entering the
temple. In the second row from the foot appears ItemsesIL kneeling
before Amon and holding the symbol of jubilee, indicative of long
reign. Behind stands the goddess Mut, while Khons, with the moon’s
'lisk on his head, conducts Philomistortobeholil the god Amen. Prob-
ably the representation is a restoration by Philometor ofen older work
on the same spot. The other rows exhibit the king in presence of
various deities. - We next enter the -

**Great Hypostyle Hall, which was justly considered one of the
wonders of the world. It has recently been restored and freed from
rubbish by the Egyptian Service des Antiquités, under the direction
of M. Legrain. Though a certain picturesque effect due to the former
ruinous condition has necessarily heen lost, the huge hall is still
extraordinarily impressive as we look southwards from the N. side
through the rows of columns. This is especially the case in the
morning or evening, or by moonlight, when the columns eastLin-
tense black shadows.

The breadth of this great hall is 338 it, its depth 170 ft., and
its area 6000 sq. yds., an area spacious enough to accommodate the
entire church of Notre Dame at Paris. The roof Was supported by
134 columns arranged in 16 TOWS, of which the two central rows
