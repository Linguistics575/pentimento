The Third Pyramid, named by the Egyptians Neter-Nenkewrg
('Divine i8 Jtenkewré'9, was erected by Mmkewri, the Mykerhurs of
Herodotus and the Mencken: of Manetho (p. xcix). Its present per-
pendicular height (PL B B,p.134)is 204 ft., its former height (B C)
was 218 ft.; the side ofthe base (A A) is 3561/2 ft. , the present height
(AB) ofthe sloping sidesis 2633/4 ft., being originally (A 0) 2793/t ft.;
these rise at an angle of 51°. The upper part of the irterustation of
the pyramid was formed of limestone blocks, the lower part ofgranite,
left partly unsmoothed. The granite covaringis in good preservation,
especially on the N. and W. sides. On the E. side lie the ruins of
the cnstomary mortuary temple. laid bare during the American ex-
cavations of 1907 under Dr, Reisner and t as usual , approached
from the valley by a still recognizable causeway, beginning with a
so-cailed valley-temple, a smaller sanctuary built of brick.

The Interior is reached only with difMt1lty. The entrance is on the N.
side, A nausnge a c descends " an angle of 26' 2' for a distance 0110le ft.,
being lined with red granite where it pesees through the masonry from a
to b and then penetrating the solid rock from b to c. From c a hnrizontal
passage " leads to an tusterstuuuberA T ft. in height,12 ft. in length, 10 ft.
in width, and decorated with door-glurped ornaments. Beyond Ibis cham-
her it pessee three trap-doors g, descends slightly teem h to d (gmdient MI,
a distance of am ft., and tineny descends to the ehember e, in a cavity
in which the srrrcapturgus of the king Beams to have originally stood
(cnmpt p. 134). This chamber is Mlle ft, mug, t2y, ft. broad, sud, owing
to the unevenness aithe rock, from which the pavement hes been removed,
varies from 13 ft, to 13 ft. 5in. in height.

In the pavement of the chhmher ' is the mouth (formerly covered) of
a shaft 30 ft. in length, which has a fine greuite lining at its upper end
