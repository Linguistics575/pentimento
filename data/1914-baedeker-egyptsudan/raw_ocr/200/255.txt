J. Esbektyeh. CAIRO. 4. Route. 51

European travellers who purpose making large purchases in the ba,
mars must arm themselves beforehand with the most inexhaustible pa-
tience. Time has no value fur nu Oriental. and that fact must he taken
into the calculation. Everything must he haggled for, sometimes in the most
obstinate fashioni When the customer knows the proper price and offers
it, the dealer will remark 'shaaiyeli' tit is little), but will close the bar-
gain. Snmetimes the shopkeeper sends for entree Ur tea from a neighbouring
cutTee-house in the course or the bargaining. If no satisfactory agreement
can be reached, the customer should calmly proceed on his way. Every step
he takes will lower the demands of the niidume dealer. " is advisable
tn mm- at first rather a. lower sum than the purchaser is willing to pay,
in order that the offer may be raised. A commnn phrase in me cere-
mouious East is 'ehudulrbauisV (take it for nothing), which, of course, is
never seriously meant. Foreigners, however, must be. prepared to pay
more than nativest Dragomans and eommissiounaires usually have a private
understanding with the dealer, so that to make purchases in their company
is ta add 10-20 per cent io the price. The street-lies often ask as much
as 5, 10, i5, or even 20 limes the value of their wares. Skill in getting
the better ui a purchaser is in the eyes or an Oriental merely a desirable
business accomplishment.

I. The Ezbekiyeh and the New Quarters.

The central point of the foreign quarter, between the old Arab-
ian Cairo and the new town built in the European style within
the last 50 years, is the -

"Ezbekiyeh Gerden LPI. o, 3), or simyly the Ezbckfyeh, on the
site of the former Ezbekiyeh Lake and named after the heroic Emir
Ezbek, the general of Sultan Ifiit Bey C1/t68-N; p. cxix), who
brought the general and son-in-law of Bayazid I. as a captive to
Cairo. A mosque, now vanished, was erected here in 1495 in honour
of his victory. The iiue gardens, which have several entrances (adm.
t/g pias.), were laid oat in 1870 by M. Barillet, formerly chief gar-
dener to the city of Paris. They cover an area of 201/, acres and
contain a variety of rare and beautiful trees and shrubs. Crows and
kites are here very numerous. In the centre of the gardens is A
roller skating rink. Military bands, see p. 42.

To the S. of the Ezbekiyeh lies the Opera House (p. 41), between
which and the Hétel Continental stretches the PLACE m: L’OPERA
(hltibhs et-Teatro; Pl. B, 0, 3), with an cqu rian statue of Ibrahim
Pasha (Arab. Ei-r/twin). Thence the S 'Abdin leads to the
S. to the hCuhfn 'Abdtn, on the left side of which lies the Khediviat
Palace (Pl. C, 4, :3), and on the right the Egyptian Army Barracks.

Between the Ezbekiyeh and theOpera House the Slriri' et-Teatro
leads to the small Mtilin Ezbek, with the building of the Inter-
national Tribunal (Tribunaut Mines; Pl. 0, 3) and the CréditLyon-
nais (p. 37). Parallel with this street runs the Siririr Tihir, on the
right side of which are the building of the Caisse de la Bette Pub-
liquc, the General Post omee (Pl. 0, 3 i p. 37], and the Jfeadytarteo
of the Fire Department. Both these streets end at the“A1ABA EL-
KaApm, a point of intersection of many tramways (p. 38), whence
the hluski (p. 53) Icuds to the E.
