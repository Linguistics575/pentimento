th" gods of Taltuis aml other deities. At the foot of the walls of
lluum " are depicted local deities with their offerings. Many of the
iuscriptiuns are merely sketched in in red. Small chambers have
been constructed in the S. walls of lioums D and I). From Ream I)
we reach the Staircase, which ascends in the thickness of the, wall
to the root oHloom Y. Thence the higher roofs of the front portions
of the temple are reached by steps. Another staircase leads from
the roof of Room ll, to the top tyt' the external wall. Descending a
few steps to the left, we reach a t"hapet formed in the thickness of
the wall. This comprises two rooms (with a crypt in the second)
and was probably intended for the cult ot' Osiris.

The INNER PASSAGE CPI. G) round the temple is entered by doors
in the court and vestibule The unfinished lions' heads on the 0x-
terior of the temple proper are water-sp011ts. On the rear wall is
a large relief of the emperor before the gods; below are smaller
reliefs. The two representations of Mandulis, on the girdle-wall
opposite these reliefs, were probably originally protected by a
snnll wooden chapel, At Pi. 2, on the S. side, is a well-preserved
Nitometer.

The w. part of the girdle-wall of the Omen PASSAGE (PI. 11)
round the temple was built against the rock. The small Chapel
(l'l. I) in the SW. angle “(LS perhaps a Birth llouse. It includes
an untinished open court rnclnsed by columns and stone screens,
and a Rock Chamber (Pl. L), of which only the door has reliurs (the
emperor before the gods). - Another “‘ell-preserved Chapel (P1. K),
in the N E. angle, probably dates from the Ptolemaic temple.

Outside the temple are Gateways and ruins ofa massive wall
of hewn stones. 1m the W. idll-slope are Ouarries, while the
Remains ofthe Ancient Town, the houses and girdle-wal] of which
are easily traceable, stretch down into the plain. In the latter are
towers of rough stone.

We now proceed to the N. from the temple of kalibsheb, pass
through the village, turn to the left, and reach the (1/4 hr.) -

*Rock Temple of Beit el-Wftli (mouse " the Wah"), situated
halfway up a hill, at the mouth of a side-valley. The temple,
founded under Ramses IL, consists of a vestibule, a hypostyle hall
hewn in the rock, and a small sanctuary. TheVEsTumLe, of which
only the side-walls so far as they were formed by the rock am now
standing, besides the latelyre-ereeted sloor-posts, was used as a
Church in Christian times, being divided into Have and aisles and
provided with a vaulted brick roof. Our interest is excited " the
animated *llisttm'cal Jlellefs on the side-walls, of which coloured
casts have been plated in the British Museum.

Two scenes on the left wall represent the king's triumph over the
Ethiopians. 1n the first relief we see the king, to the right, under
a canopy, while (in the row below) Egyptian graudecs present him
with tribute of various kinds, the principal object being a tablet
