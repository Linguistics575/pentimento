cursive characters (p, cxxxi) - 1n the second mw from the top, on the
Eight Wall (PL p), is the celebrated Repnunlrltion of the Source of the Nile:
at the foot ofa rocky eminence, on which perch at vulture and a falcon, the
Nile-god, surrounded by a serpent, peurs water from two vases. - To the
right of this is Home (in the form of a falcon) on a ready lake between
Hathor (on the left) and Isis, Ncphthys, Horns, and Amon (on the right).

A subterranean staircase to the S. of Badvian's Gateway leads to h
A'ilometer (lights necessary), which has hieratic and demotic scales as well
M the customary Coptic one

From 1Iailrian's Gateway we pmceed to the N., to the ruins of a
Temple of Harendotes o. cl), built by the Emp. Claudius.

In the N. part of the island (comp. the Map, 1). 364) are two
Coptic Churches, the remains of a Coptic Convent, and a ruined Temple
of Augustus, built in the 18th year of that emperor's reign

At the extreme N.E. of the island, and in the axis ofthe temple
of' Augustus, is n large Ilorrurn Town Gate, with three arches, the
side-arirhes being lower than that in the centre. The N. sidc-amh
has a domical stone vault in the Roman style. This gateway was
probably erected by Diocletian.

About 50 paces to the E. of the Temple nflsis, lies the small -

*Temple of Hathor, dedicated to Hathor-Aphrodite by Philo-
metor and Euergctes II. The colounade in front of it (restored)
and the sanctuary (now vanished) were both added by Augustus.

The columns in the former were united by stone screens, on which
Augustus appeared stuurirusingin various forms ofHathor. 0n the columns
Ihemselves are charming representations of tlube-players, lmrpers, figures
of Beg playing the tambourine and the harp and dancing, apes playing
the lyre, priests carrying an antelope, etc The temple proper is in better
preservation; in front of it are two plant columns, which were joined la
the walls by means of scream.

To the SE, of this temple, on the bank, rises the so-called -

"Iriosque, the chief decoration and the characteristic symbol of
the island, Which, however, is generally so submerged that only the
upper part of its columns are visible. It dates from the Roman
imperial period and was never completed. Above the floral capitals
of the columns it was intended to add sistrurn-eapitals.

Only the end-walls are smoothed on the outside, the sidewalls were
luft roughhewn Within, twn at the stone screens between the columns
are embellished with reliefs: Trajan offering wine to Isis and to the
thleoa-headisd Horns, and Trajan before Osiris and Isis. The remaining
screens are simply smoothed. except two which are Mill reugh-hewn,

The rocky island of Biggeh or Bigeh (Egypt. Senmct), the chief
deities of which were Ups, the goddess of tire, and Hathor, is, like
Phila, now flooded in winter (comp. p. 365). It is reached by boat in
a few minutes from Philae, at which it commands a picturesque view.
We land at the ancient quay and ascend by a staircase. In front of
us lie the remains of a Ptolemaio temple (Neos Dionysus), of which
part of the hypostyle hall is still standing, with its pliu1t-e0turnts
united by stone screens. On the E. side is a door, into which an apse
has been built. There are numerous inscriptions oh the island.
