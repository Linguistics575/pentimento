column) and supports a capital formed of a bundle of paltu-leirves,
bending slightly outwards, and held together by bands (Fig. V e).
The earliest and tinest palni-columns were found in the mortuary
temple of Sehuré at Abugir. At a later period the base of the
column was often omitted. - The comparatively simple plant-
capitals of the earlier periods were elaborately developed during the
Ptolemaic epoch, until they almost assumed the form of bouquets
of flowers, resplendent with brilliant colours (Fig. Vbl.

Besides these plaut-columus other varieties occurs The sovcalled
Hatlnor " Sistrum Columns have round shafts crowned on four sides
with the head of the goddess IIathor (with tow's ears), above which
was a temple-like addition. These are exclusively c0IMrreil to teru-
ples of female deities and are most numerous in the Ptolemaiu
period; they are doubtless reproductions of the sistrurn (p. clvii],
with its handle. Another curious column is the Tent-Pole Column,

an imitation of the primitive form of teut-poles. This occurs in

the festal temple of Thutmosis m. at Karnak (p. 275), where the
capitals are altered to the form of inverted calices.

Comparatively few of the ancient Egyptian Secular Buildings,
even of the later historical periods, have been preserved. The
number of ruined towns is not, indeed, insigniiioaitt; hat the re-
mains of the earlier houses are almost invariably concealed by those
of later date and are thus very difiieult to examine. The remains
of earlier houses have come down to us directly in only a few ex-
ueptiunal instances, as at Jllahiu (pp. 194. 196), Tell el-rAruarna
tsee p. 212), and Deir el-Ballis, and beside the valley temple of the
Mykeriuos Pyramid tp. 133). These, in connection with represent-
ations preserved on the monuments and models of houses found in
tombs, afford us some knowledge of the structure and interior ar-
rangements of Egyptian Piuvanz llovsns, which in many respects
resembled the Arab houses of modem Egypt U). clxsxiii), The
house of the humble peasant or wokaau was as simple then as it
is to-day. An open court, in which the family spent the day (and
in summer the night also), was adjoined by a few dimly-lighted
sleepiug-rooms and stables for the cattle, while a staircase led from
the court to the tlat roof, upon which a few smaller apartments were
often found. The houses of the more prosperous Egyptians " the
Middle Empire also had a court as their central point, at the back
of which, an a terrace, was a Colonnade or vestibule of light col-
umns, generally open towards the N. and affordiag protection from
the sun. Thence a door led to a wide hall, the roof of which rested
on columns, and beyond that was a deep hall, also with columns,
probably used as the eating room. leyoud that again were other
apartments (bedrooms) for the master of the house and his grown-
up sous. On one side of the four principal divisions of the house
