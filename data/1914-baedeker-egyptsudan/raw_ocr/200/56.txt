1 H. GEOGRAPHICAL AND b. Modern Egyptians.

vsestwards. itecent ylrilologists [such as Heinissh) classify the llam-
ites from their linguistic chatacteristics as the prototype of the
Semitic family, distinguished by more elementary, more primitive
forms. It is universally assumed that both Hamites and Semites
had their original home in Asia. At what period each hived "
from the original common stock is veiled in prehistoric darkness.
But it is clear that Asiatic influeaees must have affected the dwellers
on the Nile even before the introduction of the art of tillage, while
the valley of the Nile in Egypt was still populated by pastoral
races - a conclusion based mainly on the origin of the domesticated
" and nfseveral other domestic animals. On the other hand the
original ancestor of the Egyptian domesticated ass was peculiar to
Afriea, dwelling among the. mountains and steppe sto the S. of
Egypt. In this fact us tind an indication of the route followed by
the Hamitic invaders ol' ngyyt.

The beginning of anything like l regular political development
ln Egypt cannot hu dated before the intwdueti0n of agriculture;
must probably it began with the cultivation of wheat and barley,
grains of which have been found among the remains in the most
ancient Egyptian tmnhs, dating from before the earliest dynasty.
The origin of both these cereals is iudisputahly Asiatic; their first
home was in the valley of the Euphrates or in some more central
region of the continent. Besides these grains the funeral olferings
under the earliest dynasties included also linen, wine, and the pro.
dues of other cultivated plants, originally indigenous to W. Asia.

Some of the earliest ideal conceptions of the proto-Egyptians
must likewisehave been drawn fromAsiatie sourees,whieh,however,
in this case are to he looked for farther to the S. in that continent.
Not only the use of incense, but also the sycamore and the persea,
the two sacred trees in the Egyptian Pantheon, were known in
Egypt from the very earliest period. llnt all these plants are CT-
elusively indigenous to the mountainnus regions of S. Arabia and
the adjoining toasts of the Red Sea; they could have been derived
from no other source. The use of incense is as ancient as the most
ancient known religion. The tree called by the Greeks parsea, and
known to modern botanists as mimusops, flourished in the gardens
of ancient Egypt; and the sycamore, which is now nowhere found
in a wild state outside the regions mentioned above, is to be seen
all over Egypt at the present day.

To sum up. The condition of the prehistoric dwellers in the
Egyptian Nile valley may be described as the result of a union be-
tween the autochthonous inhabitants and the llamitic tribes whichv
advancing from the Red Sea, entered the country from regions to
the S. or S.E. of Upper Egypt. After a long interval of time' the
ancient dwellers on the Nile were subjected to new moduieations,
arising from the predatory attacks ofa rscethat had attained a higher
level of civilization. This latter race must have started from the
