Small Temple. ABU SIMBEL. 30.1coum 409

*Temple of Rather. This temple is hewn in a rock separated by
a valley from the great temple. It also was founded by Ramses II.
and was dedicated to llathur and to the
deitied Netru-ere, consort of Ramses. The
facade is turned more to the S. than that of
the great temple. The quay on the river and
the approach thence to the entrance have
been washed away.

The FAgADn, J?. ft. long and 39 ft. high,
is hewn in imitation of a pylon with reeed-
ing front, crowned hya caucave cornice. The
cornice, however, has fallen. On each side
ot' the narrow entrance, with their backs
against the facade, are three Colossal Statues,
33 ft. in height, representing Ramses H. and Nefret-erts. Beside
these are smaller figures of the royal children: beside the colossi ot'
the queen are the princesses Merit-Aman (right) and Heat-tewe
(left); beside the outer colossi of the king arc the princes Meri-
Atum (right) and Meri-R? (left); and beside the colossi of the king
on the right and left of the door are the princes Amen-her-Maps/tef
(right) and Ra-her-tvm) (left). On the receding facade are pro-
jectiug parts resembling buttresses separating the eelessi, so that
each ot' the latter appears to be in a kind ofniche. On these hut-
tresses are votive inscriptions.

We now enter the llwosnm ”ALL (Pl. A), the roof of which
is home by six pillars, decorated in front with sistra with the head
of Hathor, while the other sides bear representations of the king,
the queen, and various deities.
