tn the beginning of the New Empire, consist of e series of passages end
chambers hewn in the rack. Like the corridors within the pyramids they
Were intended only for the reception of the sarcophagus; the temples
dedicated to the mites at the decaased, in whieh the olferings to the dead
were made, were built in the plain.

The S'rxucrum: of the tombs is practically the same in all. Three

Small eide-ehemheu ecmetimes opened " the first corridor, and re-
cesses for the receptian at the furniture of the dead were provided in
the second end third. The third corridor led into an Antei-aom, beyond
which lay the Main Hall, where, in a hollow in the floor, the heavy
granite sareophivgus wee deposited. The main hall, the roof of which was
frequently euppaited by pillars, we often edjeined by other chambers.

The WALLS of the tombs, from the entrance to the firtxl chamber,
were covered with sacred pictures and texts, a knowledge of which was
essential for the Jeceased in the future life. The prevailing conception
M Bibin ei-Mumk wee that the deceased king, as companion of the eun-
god (or rather absorbed in the euh-god), sailed through the underworld
M night in a. hunt; thus those scenes and textewere preferred which de-
scribed this veyege end inetmcted the deceased as to the exact mute. Theee
texts were chiefly taken from two books closely related to each other.
One was called 'The Back of him who is in the Underworld‘. According to
this, the underworld (Tim.- p. cxlviii) is divided into 12 regions (%avmuus0,
eorrespondistg to the 12 hours of night; and the description: in the
book were therefore likewise in 12 chapters, In each of these the
river bearing the boat of the sun is 1represertted in the middle; in the
heat stands the ram-headed sun-god, surrounded by his retinue, and
bringing for a short time light and life to the regions he traveieee.
Above and below are shown the two hehhe oi the river, lhrouged by all
manner of spirits, daemons, and monsters, which greet the sun end ward
" his enemies.

The second hook, known as the ‘Boak of the Gnies‘, reproduces the
sinus 'ursrceptions, The uectumei journey or the suit lhraugh the 12 re-
gions at the underworld is again represented. Massive gates or pylons,
guarded by giganlia eeipents, separate one region from enother; each
serpent bears a name known to the euh-god, and the deceased must know
it also. Two gods and two fhus-apitting snakes guard the approach and
greet the sun-gad.

A third work, which may be called ‘m Sun‘s Journey in the Under-
warld‘, uantains etin more gloomy and unattractive representations. The
sun-gorl has arrived in the underworld and addresses a speech to the
spirits and monsters, which are cereiuiiy depieted in long rows.

Recourse wee had to other works also for the decoration of the kings'
iomhst The chief of these were the 'Prauiag of RE' and WW: Bank of
the Queuing " the Mouth‘, The farmer, which was used in the iirst coi-
riders, contains a 1oug-wimied hymn to the sau-god, to be recited in the
evening as the sun entered the underworld. In the cnurse of the hymn
the god is invoked under 75 diiferent nemee and is depicted in as many
term. - The text and illustrations in the second of these works teach
the multifarious eeiemohies which bad to he performed before the statue
of the deceased king in order to ensure it the use of its eigens, so as to
enable it to eat em) drink in the tomb.
