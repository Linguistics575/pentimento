The terrace is adjoined on tho N. by an 0mm COURT dedicated
by Ramses II. to the worship of the sun, which was excavated in
1909. The walls surrounding it rise on the E. side to form a sort of
pylon. To the left of the entrance is a memorial inscription of
Ramses 11 , on which lie is represented bunting inmnse to the gods
Atnon-RE, Mut, 11E-liarirkhte, Seth, and the Asiatic Astarte. In
the Pourt are two pedestals with coneeve cornices. On the one on

the N, bore a chapel containing the images of a scarahzuus (the sun-
