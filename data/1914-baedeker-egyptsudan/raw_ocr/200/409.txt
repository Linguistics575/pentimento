1useordingly restored the ancient canal, the bed of which is said to
have been pointed out to him by a. Capt, and used it for the trans-
port of grain from Fustit (p. 44) to Kolzum (Suez), Whenccit was
exported by the Red Sea to Arabia. The canal again became uu-
serviceable after the 8th century. At a later period the Venetian:
frequently thought of constructing a canal through the Isthmus, with
a view to r‘ecover the trade which they had lost owing to the discovery
of the route round the Gaye of Good Hope Leihnitz, too, in his pro-
posal regarding an expedition to Egypt, made in 1671 to Louis NIV.,
the greatest monarch of his age, strongly recommends the construc-
tion of such a canaL Sultan Muetafa IH., the admirer of Frederick
the Great, Ali Bey, the enterprising Mameluke prince, and Bonao
pane all revived the seheme, and the last on his expedition t-
Egypt in 1798 (p.css) even caused preliminary works to be under-
taken, but the actual execution of the project seemed almost as
distant as eyer. Lepbre, Ilo1tapatte's chief road engineer, surveyed
the ground, but owing to a serious miscalculation he threw great
doubt on the feasibility of the unilertakinz. \Vhile in reality the
level ofthe two seas is nearly the same, Lepére estimated thatof the
{ed Sea to be nearly 33 ft. higher than that of the Mediterranean.
In 1836 Ferdinand de Lesseps (1805-94) came to Cairo as a
young consular dive, and there had his attention called to Leptrre's
Manoire regz-nliug the scheme of connecting the two seas, which
led him to eonsidcrits great importance in spite of Lep'ere's doubts
as to its feasibility. la 1838 he made the acquaintance of Lieut.
Waghorn (p. 188), whose zealous advocacy of the establishment of
It route between Europe and India vii Egypt stimulated Isis zeal
for a similar project. In 1841 and 18-17 Linant<Bey, the vieeroy’s
engineer of water-works, and Messrs. Stephenson, Negrelli, and
Bourdalouc demonstrated the inaccuracy of Lepére's calculations.
In ISM M. de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before
Sa'id Pasha, who was then Viceroy and determined to carry it out.
Diriieulties were thrown in the way of the enterprise by the British
government during Lord Palmerston?, ministry, but on Jan. 5th,
1856, permission to begin the work was formally granted by the
Viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the Iheee8s-
ary capital was raised, and it was not till April 22nd, 1859, that
the work was actually begun. The vieeroy undertook to pay many
of the current expenses and provided 25,000 workmen, who were
to be paid and fed by the Company at an inexpensive rate and
were to be relieved every three mouths. Until the completion of
the fresh-water cahal(p.180) the supplying of these workmen with
water, which at first had to be transported on camels, cost the
company 8000 fr. per day. Later, however, fewer native hands were
employed, European labourers were engaged, and much of the
work was done by machinery, of 22,000 horse-power in all.
