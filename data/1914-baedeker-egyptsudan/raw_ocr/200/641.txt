of Acirirs. PHILIE. . Pg. Route. 30a

The Rummy (station, see p. 353) runs through the desert in
a wide curve round the N. and S. granite quarries (p. 356) and ends
at the station of 6helttit (see below).

The Dssuh'r Roan: leads from the railway station past the
English church o. 355) to the height with the Arab sheikhâ€˜s grave
(p. 360) and then descends into the valley. Beyond the grove of
tamarisks (p. 356) we reach the old road described by Strabo, who
assigns it a length of 50 stadia. At the little British cemetery our
route is joined on the left by a railway constructed for the transport
of building-material for the dam. Beside the mad lie large blocks
of granite, with ancient inscriptions carved by Egyptian ofiicials,
now numbered with white numbers. About 1/2 M. beyond the ceme-
tery is a ravine Ctislisgraph-liae) diverging towards the village of
F.l-Malsatta (see below), We, however, follow the railway and skirt
the remains of an ancient Brick Wall, which was probably erected
as early as the Middle Empire to protect the Nile traffie against the
predatexy attacks of the Fl. dcsett-trihes. The wall is (Wert. thick
and, at places, 13-20 it. high, and consists of two faces of bricks
tilled up with blocks of granite. It leads as far as Shetl01 Lsee below).

The Rnensmn Rome leads from the Cataract Hotel vit Fort
Tagug on the hill o. 360) to the village of LT-Itlaltatta, opposite
the island of Selteil.

The island of Seheil (men), reached from Assuin by boat, was
dedicated to Anuhis, and eahtaths over 200 rock inscriptions, besides the
ruins or two temples. One or the temples, near the village of Seheil on
the w. side at the island, dates from the 15m Dru. ., the other (tn the s. L
trom the reign of Ptolemy IV. Philopator. High up nn the S.E, rocks of
the island is an important inscription of the Ptoletuaic period, recording
tl1at in the reign nf the primeval King loser (p. 116) the Nile failed to
me during a period or seven years and that a famine arose in the land
in mnseqneuee.

The view of the stream with its 1u1mer0t1s darlsseoloarcil granite
rocks, coveted with a smooth glaze, like enamel, is very fiue, al-
though the foaming rapids of the Great Cataract are now things of
the past. _ From Ei-MUsatt.a the mute leads through the dirty
Village of Kor6r, wedged in among the granite rocks. It then passes
the hamlet of El-Khtzzzin, which has recently sprung up here, with
the tasteful white bungalows and pleasant gardens of the oNeials.
It then again turns to the E., passing a cemetexy for Christian work-.
men, andj ins the desert-route (see above) at the tenth of a sheikh,
near the ancient brick wall.

A shorter route, diverging from the desert- route beyond the
British cemetery, leads direct (in about 1/2 hr.) to El- Khazall and
the dam O.37t). 'Thence to Shellil, see above.

The village of Shellel (Challal),\vhere both the railway and the
desert-route end, lies on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Phila. _
Good boats lie ready for the ferry (5 pias. there and back; tickets
at the hotels).
