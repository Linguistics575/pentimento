76 Route 4, G'AIR0. 4. Northern

Adjacent to the Muristin is the Madness}: and Tomb of En-
Nagir, dating from about 1303, now almost a total ruin.

We eater it fram the street_by a. marble portal in the Gothic style,
brought by Sultan El-Aahrar Khan], the elder brother of Ert-2liksir, hon
the church or Acre, which he destroyed in 1291. The door leads into
a corridor, on the right side of which is the tomb of En-Nteir (dome
rollapsed), while to the leftis the sanctuary of the medreseh. In front are
lhe ruins of the main building, now containing coppersmiU1s' workshops.

The third large building is the *Bar1pu.ciyeh, the mcdreseh of
Sultan Barlct1y (11582-99; p. cxviii), built in 1384. It possesses an
interesting marble portal and a bronze-mounted door. The greater
part of it has been tlurrougldy restored, and the colouring and gild-
iug applied to the sanctuary and mausoleum (in which a daughter
of Barlsttrr rests) are, unfortunately, mnnh too loud. _ Opposite is
a modern sebil. _

The N. continuation of the th)hargiyeh is the busy Snfxm’ nx-
NAmjAsiN, with the market of the eoppersnliths. To the right, be-
tween the ljéret Bait el-liiu,li and the Derb Kermez, are the remains
(stone below, brick above) of the huge, facade of the palace of Dir
Beshtalc un. E, 3 , p. ulxxxiii), whie,h was created in I.' " by the Emir
Ileshtik on the foundations ot'e palace of the Fatimite celiphs (entr.
from the Derh Kcrmez), The interior still retains traces of its ela-
horatedee0ratiorrs,while the main room of thehamm I inacces-
sible) is well preserved, - At the intersection of the street with the
Slutrir cl-Tomhakshiyeh (p. 77) stands theSele 'Abd er-Rayman, one
of the prettiest structures of its sort in Cairo (18th cent). On the
gconndt1oor is the chamber for the distribution ot' the water, taste-
fully decorated with fayence, Upstairs is the hall of an elementary
schoox, commanding a striking retrospect of the busy street.

At the corner of the I;[?tret ea-Sannannin, farther on, to the
right, stands the trkmir el-AhmaIXPL E, 2), huilt in 1125 by El-
Ma'nuin, the grand vi, 'r of J'U-Amir, the Fatimite. The facade,
now laid hate for the greater part, is the oldest mosquc-fatarle in
Cairo and therefore of' e,om,irierabie architectural interest (comp.
p.01xxix); it is built uf 11mm stone, with tall pointed arches in
rectangular frames alternating with small recesses in tho stories. -
The street now becomes the Siu' EL-NAItGUSU cri-l',sruGNr. On
the left, beside the modern mosque of Es-Selal.rdir, with its Turkish
minaret, the 1.Liret Bit Gauan diverges through an archway and
leads in a zigzag to the Mosque of Abu Bekr Maghar e1-Ae1s.sltri
(PI. E, 2). T

This mosque was built in use by Abu Dehr, director of the Chancery
or Sultan ham Bey, in the style ofthe small mosques nflhe later Mameluke
period, and has been thoroughly restored. The walls and ceiliagillvstrtrte
the characteristic decoration of its date. Other noteworthy features are
the columns in the E. and w, liwéns, the carved pulpit, and the pretty
.loors, The central portian is donusd. The coloured stucco window-
tracerles are modern.

Farther on the street assumes the name Sakrur Bin: Fm-yurrfy.
0n the right we soon reach the entrance of the ruinous --
