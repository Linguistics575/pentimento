*Na. M. Tomb of Amenophis IL (lighted). This tomb lies
about 200 yds. to the W. of the Tomb of Ramses III. Part of its
contents has been left on the spot (comp. p. 94). From the eutrancr‘
steep flights of steps and sloping curridors descend to a shaft (now
brldgeil; Pl. i), in the depth at which is the opening to a small
chamber (P1. 2), and on to a Roou (P1. 3) the walls and two pillars
of which are quite uruuloraed. From the left rear comer of this
apartment a staircase descends to a sloping corridor and to a Room
(Pl. 4) home by six pillars. At the hack of this is a kind of
crypt. On the pillars
Amenophis II. is re-

blue ceiling is dotted
with yellow stars. The
walls, painted yellow
(probably in imitation

stands the sandstone
’Sarcophagus of the
king (effectively shown by electric light), containing a mummy-
shaped eonirt with the body of Amenuphis 11., wrapped in its

room are two small chambers (PL 5-8), In the first to the right
(Pl. 5) lie three mumrnies. The second to the right (Pi. 6; inac-
cessible) contained nine royal mummies, placed here to conceal
