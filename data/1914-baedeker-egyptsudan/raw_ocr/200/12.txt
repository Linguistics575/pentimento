he will find adequate guidance on the spot in that portion of
our description that is printed in larger type, while those Who
have time and inclination for a more thorough examination
will find additional particulars in small type.

The MAPS and PLANS have been the object of the Editor's
special care, and all have been carefully revised by Prof.
Steindorff, with the aid of the most recent publications. Nine
maps and plans, several new ground-plans, and a represen-
tation ofEgyptian coins have been entirely redrawn or appear
for the first time in the present edition. The spelling of the
names on the maps of the Faiyilm and of the Nile from Cairo
to Assuin (3 sheets) follows the official French transliteration
of the ' eecensement général de l'Egypte du Ierjuin 1897',
whereas in some of the new maps the spelling of the Egyptian
Survey Department (camp. p. 0x0) has been adopted. At the
end of the volume will be found a key-map indicating the
ground covered by the special maps of the volume.

HOTELS, etc., see p. xviii. Hotels which cannot be ac-
curately characterized without exposing the Editor to the risk
of legal proceedings are left unmentioned.

To hotel-proprieturs, tradesmen, and others the Editor
begs to intimate that a character for fair dealing towards
travellers is the sole passport to his commendation, and that
no advertisements of any kind are admitted to his Hend-
books. llotel-keepers are warned against persons represent-
ing themselves as agents for Baedeker's Handbooks.
