30. The Rock Temples of Abu Simbel.

The two rock temples of Abusimbel, known also as Abousumbul
or lpsambul, built by Ramses H., are among the most stupendous
monuments of ancient Egyptian architecture and challenge com-
parison with the gigantic editiees situated in Egypt proper. Tickets
of admission (p. 200) should not be I'orgotten. This temple produces
a very grand etfeet by moonlight or at sunrise.

The MGreat Temple of Abu Simbel is entirely excavated out of
the solid rock. It was dedicated in the first place to Amon-Re of
Thehes and Ilry-Harakhte aflleliopolis, the leading deities of Egypt
proper, but I‘tah of Memphis and the deified Ramses himself were
likewise worshipped here. Its longer axis Inns almost due E. and
w., so that at sunrise the sun’s rays penetrate to the innermost sano-
tuary. Burc/chardt, in 1812, was the tint modern traveller to ex-
amine this temple. In 1900 Barsunti discovered the N, chapel in
the forecourt, freed the N. colossus frnm the rubbish concealing it,

reached by a flight of steps with an inclined plane in the middle,
and at the back of the terrave rises the fagade of the temple. To the
