334 Route 21. EL-xii,. From Luxor

The 'llursu; or Tm: ANCIENT Tows 011 Nmmhh, which are sur-
rounded by a massive girdle-wall of sun-dried bricks, lie near the
river. The wall, which probably dates from the Middle Empire, is
damaged only on the S.W., by the Nile. It is of immense thickness
(37 ft.) and encloses a rectangle, (Y20 yds. long by 590 yds. broad,
with gates on the E., N., and S. sides, beside which broad ascents
lead to the top of the wall. The N. wall intersects a neeropolis of
the Ancient Empire, excavated by Quihell in 1897. The city itself,
enclosed by another double wall, of which distinct traces are still
to be seen, occupied only about one-fourth of the space within the
girdle-wall. Very scanty ruins now remain at" the temple, built
during the 18th Dyn. on the site of an earlier sanctuary and en-
larged by Nektanebns and others.

Visitors should not omit to ast'end tn the top of the N. wall, for the
sake at the admirable view: tn the E., at the head of a desert-vauey,
appear the isolated rock with the inscriptions, the temple ofAmenuphis Itl.,
and, a little nearer, the chapel of Ramses ll. (comp. below); to the N. is
the hill with the suorak-urralrs, and a little farther away is a mushroom,
shaped rock, with the quarries that yielded the stone for the city temple.

We follow the route leading due E. from the E. gateway in the
girdle<wall and cross the tlazzlingly white sand, past a small ruined
Sandstone Chapel (no inscriptions) close to the wall. In rather more
than 1/ehr. we reach a Chapel of Ramses IL, known to the Arabs as
El-Ijummrim. I _ 'the bath'.

This temple was built in the mint. of Ramses 1L by Setaw, g
or Fhlliopia, represented in the entrance-doorway and on the interior w
On each side of the entrance. Other reliefs show Ramses It. sactrifivaing
to Thout and Horus. 0n the upper part of the reztt wall (right) are Crno-
eephali, sacred to Thnut; below are praying men.

We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple ofthe Ptolemies
on the left, and soon reach two Rocks projecting from the plain, at
the point where the road turns N. towards the desert, halfway be-
tween El-lIammim and the E. temple of Amenophis HI. Both
rocks bear numerous inscriptions and figures of animals. Most of
these date from the (ith Dyn. and were probably placed here by
priests of El-Kib.

The vharming small temple or *CHAPEL " AMENOPHIS Ill. lies
fully1/4hr. to the E. It may be reached direct in about an hour
from the Nile. The little temple, which is about 50 ft. deep, was
dedicated to Nekhbeyet, 'mistress of lie-yantâ€˜ (Le. of the entrance to
the desert-valley), It consists of a ruined Vestibule of the Ptolemaic
period, with papyrus-columns (the napitals of which strew the
ground), and of & Chamber the roof of which was borne by four six-
teen-sided columns embellished, with heads of IIathor. The names
of the king, Amen, and Nekhbeyet, and several representations
ot' the gods were detiu:ed under Amenophis IV. and restated under
Sethos 1. Many of them were again renewed in the Ptolemait: period.

On the Entrance Door at the chamber are a votive inscription end a

representation of Amennphis m. The exterior walls beat, only a. few in.
scriptions and representations (ships) which were added at a later date,.
