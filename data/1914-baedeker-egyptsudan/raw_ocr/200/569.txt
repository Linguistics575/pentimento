eifisetive ornamentation. Broad piiasters, only 5 inches in depth
and placed at wide intervals, project from the wall. Above each
are a gigantic falcon and serpent.

The W. side of the terrace is bounded by two raised colonnades,
that to the right named the Birth Colonnade, that to the left the
Punt Colonnade.

The Blew COLONNADE contains li pairs of square pillars sup
porting the roof. On all four sides of the pillars is the same scene:
Amon laying his hand in blessing upon the shoulder of Hatshep-
sut (iiguo defaced throughout) or Thutrnosis Ill. The inscriptions
and representations on the walls of the colonnade refer to the pro-
creation and birth of the queen (Pl. e). Among these are two tirtty
iigariss of the queen-mother Ahmes, once in presence of the ram-
beaded Khnum and the frog-headed Ileket, and ance in presence of
the ibis-uailed Thout. - Two steps at the N. end of this colenuede
descend to a Vesnuvm: with 12 sixteen-sidetl columns. 0n the
walls are tlite reliefs.

In the S. Wall is a smnnRecm with vepreseatauons of the queen (er-
faced] before various deities; above appears the queen (a ain scratched
out) before Osiri . To the left of the recess is Anubis, ehind whom
stood the queen; to the right are Nekhbeyet end linrakhte, between
whom were the names of the queen.- In the N. Wall is a similar Ream.
Above it is Thutmosis m. making a iihaiion of wiuelo the faleon-beadisti
Soker, god ofthe dead; to the right, Anubis and the queen (scratched
out): to the left, the queen (scratched out) standing in a chapel before the
symbol of Eme-wl - Un the W. (rear) Wall, the queen (scratched out)
sacrificing to Amon (to the hem and to Anubis [to the right), with the
saorifieitu gift: heaped up before each god.

Three steps at the hack of the vestibule lead to n Chum. " Auum.
consisting of three chambers with vaulted ceiliap. The cotouxing of
the bas-reliefs is admirably preserved, though the figure of the queen is
invariably scratched out. They represent Hatshepeut hefore various deities,
especially Anubis. Thutmosis ILL occurs once on the E. wall of the second
chamber, pouring water before Saker.

0n the N. side of the terrace is an utilinishgd CoLoNNAve, the
roof of which is supported by 15 sixteezhsided columns. Behind
it are four chambers (now walled up).

We now turn to the COLONNADS ur PUNT, on the S. side of the
W. terrace, exactly corresponding with the Birth Colonnade. The
*Scenes on the walls, some of which are unfortunately much dem-
aged, commemorate a trading expedition to Punt (p. 223), under-
taken during the queenâ€™s reign. On the S. Wall we see a village
in Punt (Pl. f). The beehive huts are built over the water amongst
palms and 'utoense-tri"rs; ladders lead up to the entrances. 1n the
lower row, to the right, is the reception of the Egyptian envoy
and his suite by the Prince of Punt; above. the envoy in front of
his tent, looking at the gifts that have been heaped upon him. _
0n the W. Wall we see, to the left (Pl. g), the arrival of the
Egyptian Met at Punt, where it is laden with precious merchan-
dize;to the right is the return of the fletst. Above are the inhabitants
of Punt and the Egyptians with their gifts; while prostrate grandees
