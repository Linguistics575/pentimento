200 UPPER EGYPT. Preliminary

Visitors to the temples and tombs of Upper Egypt and Nubia
should be provided with :1 GENERAL ADMISSION TICKET, which may
be obtained (price SE 1.20 pias.) at the Museum of Cairo (p. 81),
from Thos. Cook & Son (p. 38), at the Mtiee of the Hamburg Ft
Anglo-American Nile Co. (p. 38), or from the inspectors of the
antiquities " Luxor and Assiiit.

The ordinary traveller, desiring to visit only the principal points
of interest, may ascend the valley of the Nile either by railway or
by steamboat. By RAILWAY not less than a fortnight is required
for a visit to the chief points. Those who use the Tomusr STEAM-
BOATS, spending 3 or 4 weeks on the voyage, enjoy a much more
thorough and convenient survey; while the voyage on the Nile has
so many attractions of its own that even the most hurried traveller
should make a point of proceeding by river at least between Luxor
and Assuén. At the same time it must not he forgotten that in
travelling by tourist-steamb0at one is l member of a party and
has to surrender some of the free control of one's time. The most
attractive, bat also the slowest and most expensive, method of
ascending the Nile is by Dunning! (p. 204). - Moonlight adds a
peculiar charm to a visit to the ruins at Luxor and Assuin. It is as
well for the independent traveller to avoid as far as possible com-
ing into contact with the large parties organized by the tourist-
agents, for otherwise circumstances are apt to arise in which he is
pushed to the wall, without any redress.

Railway. Travellers who desire to see as much as possible in a
short time and are impatient ofthe restrictions of an organized party
may visit Upper Egypt by train. Trains daily from Cairo to Luxor
in 131/444 hrs., see ll. 15; from Luxor to Assuén in 61/4-83/4 hrs.,
see R. 21. The following scheme, which is recommended to some-
