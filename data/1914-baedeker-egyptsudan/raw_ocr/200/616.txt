The "Temple of Horus, built ofsandstone, stands in wonderful,
almost perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian
temple or even of any antique building in the world, in spite of the
2000 years that have passed over it. Unfortunately the faces of the
kings and gods in the reliefs all over the temple were scratched out
in the Christian period. The present temple occupies the site of an
earlier sanctuary and was dedicated to the sun-god Horus, Hathor of
Dendera, and the youthful Horus. 'Uniter of the Two Lands' {Har-
"rrt-tetce, Hmwmtus). The history of its construction and a de-
scription of the entire structure are detailed in Iengthyinscriptions
on the exterior of the girdle-wall (at Pl. i and k). The temple proper
was begun in 237 B.0. by Ptolemy IlI. linergetes I. and com-
pleted, so far as the masonry Was concerned, by his successor
Philopator in 21213.0. The decoration of the walls with reliefs
and inscriptions, postponed by the death of Philopator and the
disturbed reign of llpiphanes his successor, was resumed in
176 B.0. under Philometor and completed in 147 13.0. (under Ener-

Ptolemy XI. Alexander L the calonnaded court, the girdle-wall.,
and the pylon were added, though the reliefs on the latter date from
Neos Dionysos. The linal touch was given in 57 B. C.

The temple was originally surrounded by a lofty Brick Wall,
still partly preserved, pierced by a large gateway on the s., in the
axis of the temple, and by a smaller gateway to the W.

The great Pylon stood in an inner girdle-wall of brick, and its
entrance was closed by a double door. It is covered on all sides
with reliefs and inscriptions. On the front of each of the towers
the eolossirl figure ofthe King Neos Dionysus is conspimous, smiting
his foes, whom he holds by the hair, in presence of the Glcon-
headed Horus of Edth and Hathor of Dendexa. In two rows, above,
the king appears praying and offering sa0rifiees before Horus, before
Hathor and Horns, 'Uniter of the two lands', and before other gods
of Edfu. The four wide incisions, two on each side of the central
portal, were intended to support large tlag-staffs, which were further
secured by means of clamps fastened in the holes still to be seen
in the masonry directly above. The small rectangular apertures in
