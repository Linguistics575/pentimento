and Aiexaadria. The importation of one's own cigars is attended with so
much trouble as hardly to be worth while. The travelleris recommended

Steamers. The necessary information about the stearmar-lines
between Europe and Egypt is given at pp. IU). For the Nile
steamers to Upper Egypt, see p. 201 i to Lower Nubia, see p. 383;
in the 80din, see p. 417.

Railways. The official time-tab1cs are published in the Indi-
eateur de, Chemim de Fer de t'Eyypte, Which is sold for 10 mill. at the
chief railway stations, " the Cairo central telegraph offMe, and at
the booksellers'. Time-tables are exhibited also in the larger hotels.
The railway-iages resemble those of France or Italy. First-class
passengers are permitted to take a reasonable quantity ofsmall lug-
gage with them into the carriages. The secoud-class carriages are
comfortable enough for day-journeys on the main routes (Alexandria
to Cairo, Cairo to Mango”, Cairo to Port Sail or Suez, Cairo to
Assuén), especially by the express-trains; and their use effects a
saving of 50per cent in fares. But on branch-lines all travellers
should take tirsteelass tickets, especially at night. The third-elass
carriages are quite unsuited for Europeans.

The trains are not much slower than in Europe and are very
punctual. The traveller should he at the station in good time, espe-
4aially " heavy luggage must be booked 1/4 hr. before the departure
" Hue train. The luggage-rarity is somewhat comylicated. Hand-
luggage up to 55lbs. is free. The aloak-room charge is 5 milliémes
each package put day. Passenger-fares are calculated on a Tone-
system, applicable to both express annlslowtmins(1stcl.5 mill.

250 kil., 21/2 millO. Passengcr-tiekets are printed in French aml
Arabic luggage-tickets in Arabic only. A reduced tariff and cheap
returr1-trekets are in use on the Lipses de lhmlieue or suburban
lines (between Cairo, ryulyr1b, and the Barrage du Nil; between
Cairo, Matiriyeh, and ICI-Marr, between Suez and Suez Docks;
between Alexandria, Ramleh, and Abukir). Retura-tirhets at a re-
duction of 5 per cent on the double fare are issued to and from the
larger stations, but are valid for ' days only. - In hot weather the
dust, whigh penetrates the carriages even when the windows are
closed, renders railway travelling in Egypt exceedingly unpleasant.
At the chief stations on the express-routes there are Railway Ru/fels
