From the Bah el- Khallg Square we continue to follow the Shirir
Mohammad 'Ali. About 1/4 M. farther on a side-street leads to the
left to the (hhni' el-Mali) Safiya (Pl. D, 5), a Turkish-Arabian
mosque of 1611, with a dome borne by six monolithic antique col-
umns 21nd ornamentation in the Byzantine-Arabian style. Behind
it, in the Sharir ed-DaOiyeh, lies the small *Mosque ofEl-Bnrdeini
CPI. D, 5), built in 1630 and restored in 1885, lavishly adorned
with mosaics, and adjoined by an elegant minaret. The beautiful
wooden ceilings and the elaborate pulpit are especially notable.

Farther on the Shéri' Mohammed 'Ali passes the much altered
mosque of El-Keiszin (‘AsanD' PL D, 5) and leads to a large square
adorned with gardens in front of two large mosques. That on the
left is the Mani' Rifk'iyeh, a handsome columned edif10e G0m-
pleted in 1912. It stands on the site of the tomh of Sheikh 'Ali
Rifé'i and contains the family burial-vault of the Khedive Ismi%
Ld. 1895). w or, the right rises the -

'"NIlunir Strr.tkn Easan (P1. E, 6), the ‘superb mosque', and the
iinest existing monument of Egypto-Arabiaa architecture. It was
built in 1356-59 for Sultan Hasau o. cxviii), perhaps by a Syrian
architect, and has been restored by IIerx-Pasha. The huge proportions
of the building, which occupies a shelving rock below the citadel,
taken in conjunction with the masterly execution of its details, pro-
duce an effect of great majesty. Admission, see p. 43.

The exterior recalls the broad surfaces of the early-Egyptian
temples. All the facades are crowned by a unique and boldly pro-
jecting cornice of 'stalaetite' formation and furnished with pinnacles
(restored). The broad wall-surfaces are relieved by blind recesses
and round-arched windows in couples. The mausoleum, which pro-
jects boldly from the S.E. farade, is covered by a dome (180 ft. high),
said to have been originally egg-shaped but reconstructed after1616
in the Turkish-Arabian style. The N.W. facade is m1fiaished. -
The massive “Gateway CPI. I), 85 ft. high, though its ornamen-
tation was never fully carried out, has been more " less imitated
in many other Egyptian mosques. The original mapuieent bronze
gate now adorns the mosque of Muaiyad (p. 59). - The S. Minarct
(P1. lia; 285 ft. high) is the highest minaret in CairoE (that of
El- Ghtsri 213 ft., Kalaun 103 ft. E1-Muaiyad167 ft., -Azhar
167 ft., Wit Bey and Barkuk 164 ft., Tuluu 131 ft., 'AmIE ‘105) ft.).

quake, but was afterwards rebuilt on a smaller scale.

The building is in the form of an irregular pentagon, 85,000 sq. ft.
