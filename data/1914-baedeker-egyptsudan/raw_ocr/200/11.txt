PREFACE. t t ~

Ever since the attention of thc civilized world was re-
directed to Egypt at the beginning of the 19th century, the
seientifie investigation of its innumerable monuments has
pointed with ever-growing certainty to the valley of tho Nile
as the cradle of history and of human culture. At the same
time Egypt, like other Eastern countries, possesses high wat-

the cultivated districts contrasted with the solemn desert,
and the manners, customs, and appearance ofa most inter-

The HANDBOOK TO EGYPT'I', of which the present is the
seventh edition, is founded on the combined work of several

must be specially mentioned Professor Georg Iteftfirif,; of
Leipzig University, Who has edited the German Ilan book
since the year 1897, and has also supervised the preparation
of the English editions. The Editor gratefully acknowledges
also the information received from numerous correspondents
and offieial sources Which has often proved most useful; any
further corrections or suggestions will be highly appreciated.

The Editor hopes, that by eonfining himself to essential
points and by carefully arranging his material, he has suc-
ceeded, within smallcomirass, in supplying the traveller with
the necessary information regarding the country and the
people he is about to visit. An attempt has been made to in-
dicatc clearly the most important among the bewildering mnl-
tiplieity o? the monuments of antiquity, and the descriptions
of these have been so arranged that, assuming the traveller to
have previously read at his leisure our account of the origin,
history, and significance of a particular temple or tomb, ete.,
