tempIe-huildings, but also ranging over the plain through which
the Nile flows, with its verdant crops and its villages fringed with
palms and mimosas, framed by the desert-mountains in the distance.

The Birth House lies to the W. of the entrance to the great
temple of Horus. It was built by Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, while
the interior decorations date from Soter II. It is surrounded by a
colonnade, supported by pillars hearing figures ofBes (camp p. 250).
Besides the main chamber there is a vestibule adjoined by two
small rooms. A staircase leads to the sight from the vestibule to

Farther along the E. bank (12 M. from Edfu), on the mountain-
slopes approaching close to the river near the hill Es-8ir@, are
the picturesque remains of a late-Byzantine fortified town (per-
