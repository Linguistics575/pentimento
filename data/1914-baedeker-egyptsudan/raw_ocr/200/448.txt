210 Route 15. MELLAWI. From Cairo

cohlmns ofthe forecourt and the main hall project from the rubbish-
heays. The vestiges of public buildings are now exceedingly scanty,
though the French Expedition saw a trinmphal arch, a theatre, and
streets flanked with columns. Granite columns and capitals lie
scattered about. Near the ruins of a large building on the road
running to the E. from the mosque lies a broken marble basin,
which must have had a diameter of about 10 ft. The Roman and
Christian cemeteries have recently been much injured.

To the S. of Shaikh 'Ahideh we reach Deir Abu Hennes (Gon-
vent of St. John], called also simply Ed-Deir, a village on the E.
bank inhabited by about 2000 Copts. Near it is a ruined town of
the Christian epoch, known as El-Medtneh. On the N. side of a
ravine in the hill behind the village are many ancient eave-like
quarries, which were litted up at an early date as Christian chapels
or anehorites' dwellings. The largest Chapel, in which divine service
is held, may be reached from the village in 1 hr.; it is said to date
from the time of the Empress Helena and contains paintings of saints
and scenes from the New Testament, but those in the neighbouring
Chapel (Raising of Lazarus, Marriage at Oana, etc.) are better. -
Deir el-Bershels (see below) is within 1/2 hr, of Deir Abu Hermes.

Immediately beyond Rtsila the mountains on the E. bank recede
farther from the river. Daring the sugal-cane harvest, in the begin-
ning of February, this region presents a busy scene.

1811/2 M. Mellawi (Mallawi; modest Inn at the station, ll.
8 pias.), a distriet-0irpital on the W. bank of the Ihrihimiyeh Canal,
with 20,250 inhab., has a frequented market on Sundays.- In the
vicinity are many palms. To the left we have a view of the E. range
of hills, in which are the tombs of El-Bersheh (see below) and
Shaikh Sa‘id o. 231). A shady route, skirting a canal, leads hence
in about il/ghr. to Ashmuuein and the ruins of IIeruropolis (p.209).

Opposite Mellawi, on the E. bank, a little way from the river,
lies the Coptic village ofDeir eI-Bersheh. Beside a Coptic cemetery
to the E. begins a desert-ravine, running N.W. and SE, and named
Wadi en-Nuhhleh " Wadi el-mrshelt, in the steep sides of which are
numerous quarries and ancient tombs. The valley is eh1eily noted
for the roeh-mmhs in its N, slope, constructed under the Middle
Empire by the princes ofthe 'hare-mums' (p. 209), which included
this region. The only one that need be visited is -

Tom; 2, belonging to 'l'HuTI-Ho'nap, son of Kai, prince of the
name in the reigns of Amenemhét II. and Sesostris II. and III.
This tomb is constructed in the same way as the tomhs at Benilpasan.
The Vestibule, originally supported by two palm-columns, has fallen
in. A door leads hence to the Inner Chamber, the walls of which
were embellished with reliefs, now partly destroyed. On the Left
Wall is a scene representing the transportation of a colossal statue
of the deceased from the quarries af Het-nub (p. 218) to a temple.
The inscription informs us that the statue was of alabaster and
