On each side of the Nile stretches a wide belt of fertile land,
bounded both on the E. and W. by ranges of hills, overtopped by
tirsely shaped peaks, especially on the E., where the ridge retires
farther from the stream than on the W. The verdant crops and
palms which everywhere cheer the traveller as soon as he has quitted

temple within which part of the place once lay. Near the temple
