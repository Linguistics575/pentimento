reliefs on the outside and numerous inscriptions, ehietiy Greek,
though some, added by visitors to the temple, are demotic and
Meroi'tie. Within the central gateway, on the left side, is a rr-
presentation of the king making offerings to Them, Temat, and
llathor, and (below) to Isis.

The Aswan or nu: Puma is attractive. In each tower there is a stair-
t'ztse, beginning in a guerd-room at the fuotand passing three other rooms
in the successive Stories. On the platform at the top at the W. tower are
numerous inscriptions Written by visitors and mo carved representations
of footprints, indicating the spots where the worshippers stood. The roof
nf the central portal may he reached from the w. tower.

No trace now remains of the court between the pylon and the
vestibule. The fagade of theVEsrmumeV or Promos, has two columns
with floral capitals, connected with the side-walls by means of
screens. On the walls are representations of the king before the gods
of Dakkeh. On the E. wall the Pharaoh proffers to the god Thout
a. palette, Which is borne by Isis and Nephthys and is, perhaps,
symbolical of Osiris, licliet‘s of an Ethiopian king occur on the
rear wall (at the top, to the left). The promos was at a later date
used as a church, and the whole of the walls and the railing were
painted over with sacred subjects, traces of which are still visible.
- The doorway in the rear wall was originally the main entrance
to the earlier temple. On the jalubs axe a number of reliefs; to the
left, Philopator before Re, lihnum, and Isis; to the right, Philo-
pator before Amou-Ré, Ifarendotes, and Isis. Within the portal an
emperor otfers the i'sgure of Meat to the god Thout of I’nubs and to
the iiou-headod Tefnut.

We next enter the 'l'uANsvsusn Ummuxe (restored). A staircase,
on the right, led hence to the roof of the temyle in the imperial
period; " the top is a crypt in the thickness of the wall. - The
following Gmnumc was built by Ergnmenes, or its reliefs only one
is interesting (on the right wall): Ergamenes making a lihation of
wine to a god described as ‘Pharaoh of Senmet’ (Biggeh) and to the
goddess Aauket. - l small door (of later construction) in the H.
wall admits to Two GHAHBERS. 0n the back-watt of the second
are two lions sitting face to face; above them is a baboon (Thaut)
worshipping the goddess Tefnut (in the form of a lioness); higher
up are two ihises.

The SANCTUARY, containing the granite shrine, is embellished
with reliefs hy an un'u1isi1tiiied emperor, who appears in them be-
fore various deities. An interesting relief represents the Nile gods
approaching the sacred iig-tree, beneath Which sits Thout in the form
ot' a baboon. In the rear wall are a door (of later construction) and
two windows (surmounted by the winged sun-disk). On the out-
side of this wall was a large door-shaped xecess, containing a relief'
of Thom of Pnubs.

On the E. bank, nearly opposite Dakkeh, lies the commune "
