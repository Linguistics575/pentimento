Mohammad, the founder of the religion, son of'Abdallr‘th, was
born at Mecca about 570 A.D. and at the ago of forty announced Mm-
self as a prophet. As he found no acceptance in his native Mecca,
he emigrated In 622 to Medina, This was the famous llegTrtt or mira
(quite erroneously translated Wight'), the date of which, on the in-
troduetion of the Mohammedan calendar, was fixed as 16th July, (N2.
At Medina he met with more success, and from the position efa
kind of magistrate he rose to be the head ot' a new state. After years
of fighting he captured Mecca in 630, but two years later he died at
Medina in the prime of life. Mohammetl never represented himself
as anything heyeml a mortal man, but in legend, which in the East
has the authority of history, he is invested with the halo of the
miraculous. God, it is said, created the Light of the Prophet even
before the creation of the divine throne; and this Light wandered
through all the generations of men nntll it manifested itself at the
reutre of tho world in the best of created beings, a noble scion of
the noblest family of Mecca. Angels, opening the breast of the
boy, expnngetl the last drop of sin from his heart, A little later the
Archangel Gabriel brought him the Revelations, the Korans, wh'reh
were then formed into a book. )lehammed wrought many miracles
and even raised the dead to llfe, as in the ease of his parents, who
turned their brief resurrection to account by embracing Ishim. Among
his most celebrated feats was the splitting of the moon and his
nocturnal journey (mi’trag) on a miraculous steed from Jerusalem to
heaven, where he treated with the Deity as to the number of prayers
to be offered by the faithful.

The startiug-point of Mohammed's tearhing was the conception
of the Last Judgment. Porrowiug the conviction of a future life and
of future rewards and punishments from theJews andChristians, who
were found all over Arabia, Mohammed exhorted his careless fellow-
cenntrymen, who lived merely from day to tlay, to adopt a more
serious conception of life. Paradise and hell were dramt by him in
striking colours. The idea of the Judgment involves the idea of a
just and single deity; from the beginning, therefm'e, Mohammad had
to preach the strictest nlenotheism in opposition to the fetishism "
the Arabs, This he named Islam, Le. resignation to the will of God.
He believed at first that Christianity and Judaism were identical,
and he desired to bring the same glad gospel to the Arabs. When he
learned the real historical relation of these faiths, be postulated an
ascending series of revelations, eullninating in Islam, At Medina he
at iirst endeavoured to accommodate himself to tho "twtriues of the
Jewish community there, but soon iinding this impossible he shook
himself free of both Christian and Jewish fetters, although he still
adhered to Abraham [Ibrahim], who was venerated by Jews and
Christians alike and was, moreover, according to the Bible the an-
cestor, through Ishmael, of the Arabs. The ancient temple of stone
at Mecca, the Kaaha (rreha, Le, cube)7 became to him an analogue of
