second-hand books is not so strictly drawn in the East as in Europe
The booksellers generally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to re-
fresh their memories regarding the stale at their stack. The Koran, which
is shown very reluctantly to uon-Moslems, is kept separate from the other
books. The hooks are piled up in a very inconvenient fashion. Many of
them are sold in loose sheets, in which case the xuirchaser should see that
the work is complete, as gaps are of frequent nerun-enee, The bindings
usually consist of leather or piustelroirrtt, Vuhmhie hanks are often kept
in cases of red sheepskia, - The workmanship of the baokbinders, who,
like other oriental artisans, work in the open street, is far inferior to
that or European productions. Red is their I'nvonrite comm,

We now follow the She tr el-Azhar, which leads to the left to
the main entrance of the Azhar Mosque.

The 'NNrmi' el-Azhar JI. E, 3, 4), the 'most blooming', the most
important monument of the Fatimite period, was completed in 970
NU. by (Filter, the vizier ofthe Fatimite SultattEl-1Iu'izz, and here,
three years later, I -Murizz oifered his first prayer after his entry
into Cairo. Admission, see p. 43; cameras are forbidden and the
visitor should carefully abstain from any manifestation of amuse-
ment or contempt. The mosque was converted into a University in
985 by Caliph Et-'Ash (p. cxv). The rectangular ground-plan ot'
the original building, almost entirely rebuilt by the Emir Salar
after an earthquake in 1303, is easily recognizable, but it has been
so frequently restored that no part of it can be said to date actually
from the Fatimito period except the central part of the sanctuary,
with its cnpolas. Everything outside this rectangle is known posi-
tively to be of later date. The characteristic. old ornamentation ot'
the arcades and eupolas in the sanctuary deserves special attention;
that of thc walls has been for the most part renewed after vanished
patterns. The arcades of the court (galm) were rchuilt under the
Khedive Tauri? with scrupulous reproduction of the old style and
tho. retention of the old columns. - The successive rulers ot'Egypt
have emulated each other in maintaining and enlarging this vener-
able building. In the 18th cent. the wealthy 'Abd er-Purlumtn Kihya
added four aisles to the sanctuary7 and in more recent days sail
Pasha and the Khedives Taufilc and 'Alrb.is ll. hare been notable
lnenefacturs of the mosque. 'Abbie II. erected a new building in
place of the dilapidated N.W. side of the mosque, and his neo-Arab
faetule is practically the only one the mosque boasts, the other sides
being all quite unpretentious and concealed in narrow lanes.

The university is considered the most important in the territory
of lslim. Before the British occupation the avenge number of
students was 7000-7700, taught by 230 professors, After that
the numbers sensibly diminished, as no students came from the
former equatorial provinces of Egypt during the domination of the
Mahdi. In 1912, however, the numbers had again risen to 14f)50
students and 587teaehers. Most ot'the students are natives otEgypt,
so that the Egyptian rrwilis (p. 58; Upper Egypt, Lower Egypt,
Eastern Egypt)are thelargest, each havingseveral hundred students.
