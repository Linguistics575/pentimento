clxii VII. HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN ART.

ments7 or harem (herim), the middle point of which was another
open court; and on the other side were the slaves' apartments, the
storc-rooms, the kitchens, and the stables. This arrangement of
the Egyptian dwelling-house was probably the same in essential
details at all periods, and even in the ROYAL PALACES (e.g. at Tell
e1-'Arnarua) the four principal divisions occur in the same order.
The houses of the 18th Dyn. which have recently been excavated
at Tell M-'Arnarns are built upon a slightly different plan from
that just deseritued. - The walls of the houses and palaces were
built of unhurut bricks of Nile mud; the roofs were made of wooden
beams, covered with straw or reeds and daubed within and without
with Nile mud; the columns were either of stone or of wood, and in
palaces were inlaid with coloured stones or glass-paste. Colour was
extensively used also in the interiors; the walls Were whitewashed
and adorned with hiight-toloured Inge or with paintings, and even
the pavements were often covered with colouring matter.

Numerous Fon’rrnnn STRUCTURES have been preserved. Amongst
these may be mentioned the Nubian forts at Kuhén (p. 397) and
to the S of Wadi Halfa (p.413), where a chain of mrtitioatioas
closed the roads beside the cataract, and the Egyptian forts at
El-Kab (p. 333) and near El-Alyiiweh (p. 236], all of which pro-
bably date from the Middle Empire.

As taxes and salaries were paid in kind, large MAGAZINE: were
required for the reception of tribute, not only by the state but also
by temples. The remains of such etorehouses have been found
beside the Ilamesseurn (p. 300) and elsewhere.

Probably in no other country have so many Temples within such
narrow limits survived from antiquity as in Egypt. Most of these,
it is true, date from the New Empire and the Ptolernaie epoch, so
that we have a clear conception ofthe temples of these periods only.
Few or no complete temple: have survival from the Ancient or
Middle Empires or from the late-Egyptian period.

Of the TEMPLES or THE ANCIENT EMPIRE, apart from the moclit-
ary temples beside the pyramids (pp. 131, 134), only one example
of a particular kind has been preserved. This is the Sanctuary of
the Sun at Abu Guréh, erected by King Nuserre (p.140) This
temple consisted of a large court bounded by covered passages and
containing only a few huildiugs; at the hack of the court rose a
huge obelisk. The walls of the passages and of some of the rooms
were covered with reliefs representing festivities, hunting-scenes,
and country life.

The remains of the TEMPLBS OF THE MIDDLE Eupnua me even
seantier than those of the Ancient Empire. Large sanctuaries,
sometimes even superior in size to those of later times, were built
during this period at Lurar, Karnak, Koptas, Abydos, Medinet
el-Faiyrhn, Heliopali:Y 2hsbastis, and Tanis; but none has left any
considerable traces. All probably fell into decay during the tvoub-
