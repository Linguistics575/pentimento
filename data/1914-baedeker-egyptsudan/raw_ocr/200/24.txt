(no hot viauds). At other stations refreshments are brought to the
earriage-windows (bargaining necessary; 2orangos 1/2 pias.), The
water offered for sale should be abstained from. In most of the
express-trains there are dining-ears (B. 10, lunch 20, D.25 pias.).

Narrow Gauge Railways. The Egyptian Light Railways cover
the Delta and the Faiyfsm (p. 190) with a network of lines, which,
though of little importance to the ordinary tourist, enable the busi-
ness man, the explorer, and the specialist to reach various remote
points with comparative ease.

The Cubs (sing. ‘arab?yeh) in the large towns are generally very
good. The (yrfieial tariffs are exhibited in the vehicles and are ad-
‘ertised in the '1r1tlieatet1r des Chemius de Fer' (see p. xvii). At
Alexandria and Cairo there are also Taximeter Cuba and Tarimeler
Mater Cabs. The latter are not adapted for drives outside the city
except on good roads. The cah-drivers (comp. pp. xxiv, 39) are
unable to read the names of the streets, while many of them know
the various points only by names of their own. The hotel-portiisr
should therefore be employed as interpreter. The traveller should
keep his eye on the direction taken by the cab, as sometimes the
uabman drives straight ahead in complete ignorance of the way and
requires to be guided, e.g. by being touched with a stick on the right
or left arm according to the turning, or with the words yemtnalr (to
the right), 'hirmilak (to the left), dughri (straight on). The cabs
usually drive rapidly, so that their use saves time and strength.

Donkeys (sing. .honuir) are found everywhere. The better ones
belong to a finer race than the European breed. Iu Alexandria and
Cairo they are, however, not used by Europeans for riding within
the town. In the towns the donkeys are generally well bridled and
saddled; side-saddles are not always obtainable, and when they are
an extra charge of 5 pias. is sometimes made for them. The pro-
elivities of the donkey-boys for prodding the animals with pointed
sticks and urging them to gallop should he stemly repressed. When
a slower pace is desired the rider shouts 'ala mahluk " 'ala mahla-
hum,- if a quicker pace is wanted, yallah, yallah, er mushsm, or m1.-
el-.horrufr; if a halt is to be made, 'andak, hush, or the English word
'stop' (camp. p. xxiv).

co. Hotels.

In Cairo and its environs and at Inner and Asnain (corny. pp. xxi,
xxii) there are hotels quite of the tlrst class, though perhaps not
equal to the most modern establishments in Europe and America.
There are good hotels also at Alexandria, Port 82%, and a few other
places. They are managed according to internatimfa] methods; the
waiters and chamber-maids are chiefly German " Swiss, while the
'boots' are generally Nubians (Baribra) who in most cases tmder-
stand one or several European languages. As on the American
system a tiserl sum daily is paid for lodging and board, the latter
