Isis, and llorus. The king's profile is evidently a faithful likeness
and is "verywlrere portrayed with great artistic skill.

Adjoining this hall, in a direct line with the seven entrance
doors, are Seven Sanctuaries, of which that in the middle was
dedicated to Anion. the chief duit under the New Empire. To
the right 'are the sanctuaries of Osi s, Isis, and Horus; to the left
those of llarakhte, Ptah, and the king. Each contained the sacred
boat of its god and was shut off by a folding door. The central chapel
was approached by a flight of steps, the others by inclined planes.
The roofs of these chapels are not vaulted in the strict arehitee-
tural sigr0eation of that word; they are formed of two horizontal
courses, each projecting aver the one below, and rounded offby the
t-hisel to the form of an arch. The Vaults are decorated with stars
and the names ofSethos L, while the walls are covered with reliefs,
illustrating the ceremonies that took place in the sanctuaries. The
volouring is in excellent preservation. In the piers separating the
doors are square recesses, which are likewise adorned with reliefs.
