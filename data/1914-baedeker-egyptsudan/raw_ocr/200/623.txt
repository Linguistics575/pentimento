K031 OMBO. 23. Route. 349

Above the deiile of Gehel Silsileh the landscape changes its
character. The mountains recede from the river, giving space to
the desert, which appears grey on the Arabian side and yellow on
the Libyan side. The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of
a distinctly darker complexion than the fellahin of the Thebaid.
Both land and people approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type.

On the E. bank lies Alirit.- At the village of 110nm (E. bank)
we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here encircles the
island of s1lunyiriyeh, with a village 'i'i.lhi same name.

On the E. bank are the large pumping-works of the K6111 Omhe
Co. (p. 341). On a hill and conspicuous from a considerable
distance appear the ruins of the beautiful temple of Rtim Omha,
especially picturesque by the light of the full moon. The islands
opposite the E. bank were, perhaps, in former times united with the
mainland, or separated from it only by a narrow channel; but in the
course of centuries the Nile has gradually extended its rhannel
farther and farther In the J?, , and during the 19th cent. alone about
20 ft. were washed away from the E. bank, along with a large por-
tion of the building. An embankment has been constructed to
prevent further mischief.

411/2 M. K6111 Ombo (railway station, see p. MI), the 'Hill of
thnbos', lies about M) ft. above the average surfiure-lehrel of the Nile.
The ancient Egyptian city of Ombos probably ewes its foundation to
the strategic importance of its site, upon a hill commanding both
the Nile and the routes from Nubia to the Nile valley. Yet the town
attained no great prosperity until the Ptolemaie era, when it was
converted from an ordinary provincial town into the capital of the
separate nome of Ombim. It was at this era that the mighty temples
were built, which excite our admiration to-day; the earlier shne-
tuaries have left scarl'ely a trace. Ombos possessed two chiefgods -
the crocodile-headed Sobek (Suclnos) and the faleon-headed Haro√©ris.
With the former were specially associated Hatimr and the youthful
moon-god Khons-Hor; with the latter, the 'Good Sister' (T-sent-
nofret, a special form of Ilathor) and the 'Lord of Both lands'
fP-neb-teure). The ruins of the town, now buried in sand, lie in
the N.E. corner of the plateau. In 1893 all the temple-huildings
in the S. part of the plateau were cleared of rubbish and restored
under the directions of De Morgan. A marble tablet on the right
door of the vestibule (p. 35t) commemorates the fact.

From the Iaaditrg,-place, to the S. of the hill, a road skirts the
river to (5 min.) a modem ilight of steps, which ascends to the
principal entrance. Tickets of admission should not be forgotten.

The ternple-precinets were enclosed by a brick girdle-wall.
The entrance is formed by a massive Pylon, erected by Ptolemy
Neas Dionysus. Only the right (E.) half is now standing; the
other has slink in the river. The reliefs show Neos Dionysos pre-
senting various oireriugs la the gods of Omhos. We enter the -
