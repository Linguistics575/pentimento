w. Religion of the Ancient Egyptians.

In spite of the numerous religious inscriptions and rsprestmt-
ations that have come down to us from Egyptian antiquity our
knowledge of the Egyptian religion is still comparatively slight. We
are indeed acquainted with the names and aspects of many deities,
and we know in what temples they were worshipped, bat of the true
essence of these deities, of the particular siguitieiuuus attributed to
them by priests and people, of the myths attached to the personality
of each. we know very little. The Egyptians themselves never evolved
a clear and complete religious system. Their faith accepted the most
glaring iucongruities; and no attempt was made to harmonize ITP-
ular eredality with the esoteric wisdom or the priests, " to recon-
cile tradition with later accretious.

The complicated religion which the texts of later times make
known to us did not exist in prehistoric days. Originally the country
was divided into a number at'town and village communes, each one
oi' which had its own protecting deity or 'town god'. We know many
of these local deities, without, however, being able to assert posi-
tively their original locality. Among them were Horus, who was
worshipped in Buto, the ancient capital " Lower Egypt; Thout,
the patron deity of Ilermopolis; Osiris, originally worshipped at
Busiris in the Delta; the gods Plah " Mernphis/Herithef of Hera-
eieopolis, Alum of fIeliopolis, Sabek, who was worshipped in the
Faiyiirn, etc. Frequently there are goddesses also who appear as
protecting divinities of places: e.g. Neith, worshipped in Sais, and
Humor or Dendera. These local deities have often lost their ori-
ginal names, and in many cases were known only by some attribute
or some legendary name. Thus, c.g., the Iion-goddess who was
worshipped in the vicinity of Memphis was known as Sekhmet, Le.
'the mighty'; the god worshipped in Assirit. in the form of a wolf
was named Wep-mawet, the 'Path Opener', probably because his
image, borne in the van of the troops. led the way into the enemy‘s
country; the local deity of This was called Enhuret (Greek Onuris),
‘he Who fetched the distant ona', probably because according to an
ancient legend he was said to have brought a lion-goddess, who was
worshipped along with him, from a foreign land. Other local deities
came to be called after the town to which they belonged. Thus the
eat-goddess of the town of Bast (Bnhastis), in the Delta, was known
as Basket, i,e. 'she of Bast', while the goddess of Nskhab (El-Kiah)
was ralled Nekhbeyet, or 'she of Nekhab’.

The ancient Egyptians originally represented these deities to
themselves under very crude forms, which recall the fetishism still
prevailing among uneiviliziwl African tribes at the present day.
Thus Osiris of Busiris (Tetu) was believed to dwell in a post, and
the god Min of Koptos was worshipped under a similar form. In
