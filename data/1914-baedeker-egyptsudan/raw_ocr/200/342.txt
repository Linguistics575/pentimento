The "Pyramids of 6129]: form the second and most imposing
of the six groups of pyramids which stand on the margin of the
plateau of the Libyan desert. To the N. lies the group of Abu Rodsh
(1)1139); southwards follow the groups ofZ6wiyet el-Urydn (p. 140)
and Abu.str fp. 141), 8alyitsra (p. IM), and Dahtlui'1r (p. 166). The
Arab word for a pyramid is Liram (p1. ahrdm).

The Pyramids of Gizeh rank among the oldest monuments of
human industry, and their colossal proportions extort from us to-
day the same astonishment as was felt in antiquity by Greek
and Roman travellers. We marvel not only at the technical know-
ledge and ability of the Egyptians, bat also at the might of their
kings, who must have had absolute control over thousands of
their subjects, to be able to rear such monuments. Some conception
of the enormous amount of labour involved may be obtained when
we learn that, according to Prof. Flinders Petrie's calculation, about
2,300,000 separate blocks of stone, averaging about 21/2 tons, were
required for the Pyramid of Kheops, and that some of them were
quarried on the E. bank of the Nile and had to be ferried across
the river and conveyed to the desert-plateau.

The Construction ofthe Pyramids has been admirably described
by Herodotus, the earliest writer on the subject, who visited Egypt
about 450 B.0.

Herndutus surtes(ii.12t, 125) that there were sbout1©,000 men employ-
ed annually for three months in constructing the Great Pyramid of Khenps t.
'They tirst made the road for the transport of the stones from the Nile to
the Libyan Mte.; the length of the med emonnts to tive stadia (1017 yds),
its breadth is ten fathums (60 ft), and its height, at the highest places,
is eightfathoms (45 rt), and it is constructed entirely of smoothed stone

, According to Prof. Flinder: Petrie, these three months fell “"85 the
inundation, when heId-wmk we: at a standstill end the services on ,000
men fur transporting the stones could be easily enough ohuiuerl. The
stone-cutters end mason: were probably engaged en the yen rmmd in
the quarries and 0n the pyramid itself.
