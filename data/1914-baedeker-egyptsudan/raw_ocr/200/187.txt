in that country. The four liwéns were superseded by a single sanc-
tuary, consisting of a main building covered with domes and usually
preceded by a second court (comp. the plan on p. 69).

The smaller prayer-rooms, frequently added to private houses
and not unlike the Christian chapels, are known as Ttswigeh.

I'he EXTERIOR of the earliest mosques was absolutely plain. The
court was enclosed by a simple battlemented wall and was entered
by an unadomed doorway. It was not until the Egyptians beheld
the buildings ofthe Crusaders in Syria and Palestine that they began
to elahomtc the facades of their mosques. The hitherto smooth
walls were now interrupted by panels or iielils, receding about 8 or
10 inches, but again brought forward to the level of the facade by
smooth slanting surfaces immediately below the unobtrusive bat-
tlemented main cornice. In these panels were placed the windows
(rectangular or arched). frequently arranged in pairs with a smaller
circular or star-shaped window above usually closed with Isarnariyeh
(p. clxxxvi). The main portal was a deep rectangular recess, with a
stone bench on either side, and terminating at the top in a ham
dome, embellished with stalactites. The doorway at the inner end
" the recess was surmounted by an arehitrave-arels and a relieving
arch. The door itself, often richly panelled, is usually adorned on
one side with embossed or chased bronze decorations, The threshold
generally consisted of a block of granite taken from an Egyptian
monument The low railing here (or on the steps below) marks the
boundary to which the visitor may penetrate without removing bis
shoes or sandals.

We now turn to inspect the lxmasu Equnmn of the mosque.
The centre of the Court was originally occupied by a fountain, be-
neath a canopy supported upon columns. This Was intended for
ornament only, for the prescribed ablutious were performed at a
special basin (Ale"u.lii) in an adjoining court. Under Turkish rule
the fountain was frequently replaced by an apparatus provided
with taps and known as the Yane/'tyeh.

The Sanctuary contains the ffibla or Miyrtsb, the prayer-niche
turned towards Mecca. Here we further observe: (l) the Minbar, or
pulpit, to the right of the Kihia, usually embellished with omn-
mental panels and inerustation; (2) the Kursi, the seat of the
IrnLu, together with a desk forithe Koran; (3) the Dikkeh, a podium
home by whiningY and surrounded by a low railing, from which the
Muballighin (assistants of thc eetebrant) repeat the words of the
Koran and the ritualistic "esturcs for the benetlt of the more dis-
taut worshippers; (4) the lamps and lanterns fTuantir, large chan-
delier; Toreiya, lit. 'seven stars', small chandelier; Hintis, lamp,
Nando, small oil-lamp) which hang by wires from the iron braces
and ceilings of the arcades as in all the liwéns.

The sanctuary is frequently adJoined by the Turba or Mortuary
Chapel of the founder. This is usually a square chamhex, contain-
