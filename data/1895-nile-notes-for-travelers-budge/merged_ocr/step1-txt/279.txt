the Virgin, but called sometimes the "Convent of the
Pulley," because the ascent to the convent is generally made
by a rope and pulley. Leaving the river and entering a fissure
in the rocks, the traveller finds himself at the bottom of a
natural shaft about 120 feet long. When Robert Curzon
visited this convent, he had to climb up much in the same
way as boys used to climb up inside chimneys. The convent
stands about 400 feet from the top of the shaft, and is built
of small square stones of Roman workmanship, the necessary repairs have, however, been made with mud or sundried brick. The outer walls of the enclosure form a square
which measures about zoo feet each way, they are 20 feet
high, and are perfectly unadorned. Tradition says that it
was founded by the Empress Helena,' and there is in this
case no reason to doubt it. The church "is partly subterranean, being built in the recesses of an ancient stone
quarry; the other parts of it are of stone plastered over.
The roof is flat and is formed of horizontal beams of palm
trees, upon which a terrace of reeds and earth is laid. The
height of the interior is about 25 feet. On entering the
door we had to descend a flight of narrow steps, which led
into a side aisle about ten feet wide, which is divided from
the nave by octagon columns of great thickness supporting
the walls of a sort of clerestory. The columns were surmounted by heavy square plinths almost in the Egyptian
style. I consider this church to be interesting from its
being half a catacomb, or cave, and one of the earliest
Christian buildings which has preserved its originality.....
it will be seen that it is constructed on the principle of a
Latin basilica, as the buildings of the Empress Helena
usually were." (Curzon, Monasteries of the Zevant, p. 109.)
In Curzon's time the convent possessed fifteen Coptic books
with Arabic translations, and eight Arabic MSS. As the
monks were, and are, extremely poor, they used to descend
