he is represented with the head of a bull wearing a disk and
uraeus. He is said to be the second son of Ptah. The
worship of Apis at Memphis goes back to the earliest times;
the Serapeum, discovered there by M. Mariette, contained
the tombs of Apis bulls from the time of Amenophis III.
(about B.C. 1550) down to the time ofthe Roman Empire.

* "..... the Lagids, as well as the Seleucids, were careful of dis
turbing the foundations of the old religion of the country;..... they
introduced..... the Greek god of the lower world, Pluto, into the
native worship, under the hitherto little mentioned name of the
Egyptian god Serapis, and then gradually transferred to this the old
Osiris worship." (Mommsen, Provinces of the Roman Empire, Vol. Ir.,
p. 265-)
