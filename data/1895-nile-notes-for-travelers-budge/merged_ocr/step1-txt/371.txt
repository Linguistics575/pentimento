colours upon them were fresh they must have formed one
of the most striking sights in Nubia. Some years ago
casts of these interesting sculptures were taken by Mr.
Bonomi, at the expense of Mr. Hay, and notes on the
colours were made; these two casts, painted according to
Mr. Bonomi's notes, are now set up on the walls in the

30,000 men, compelled them to retreat to Pselcis, which he
afterwards besieged and took. "Part of the insurgents were
