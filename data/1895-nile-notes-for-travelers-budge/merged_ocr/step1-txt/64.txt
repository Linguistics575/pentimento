40 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

made some concessions to the Monophysite party. Shortly
after, however, new dissensions arose which so weakened
the orthodox church that the Monophysite party hailed with

and joined its forces with his that they might destroy the
power of their theological opponents. After'Amr had
made himself master of Egypt (am. 640), he appointed
the Copts to positions of dignity and wealth, finding, however, that they were unworthy of his confidence, they were
degraded, and finally persecuted with vigour. From the time

allowance for phonetic decay and dialectic differences, be
identified without difficulty. The Copts used the Greek
alphabet to write down their language, but found it neces
