THE NILE. 47

width of the strips of cultivated land on each bank of
the river in Egypt together is never more than eight or
nine miles.

In ancient days the Nile poured its waters into the
sea by seven mouths; those of Damietta and Rosetta'
arc now, however, the only two which remain. The Delta
is, in its widest part, about ninety miles across from east
to west, and the distance of the apex from the sea is
also about ninety miles. Many attempts have been made
to ascertain the age of Egypt by estimating the annual
alluvial deposit; the results, however, cannot be implicitly
relied on.

The inundation is caused by the descent of the rain
which falls on the Abyssinian mountains. The indications of
the rise of the river may be seen at the cataracts as early
as the beginning of June, and a steady increase goes on until
the middle of July, when the increase of water becomes very
great. The N ile continues to rise until the middle of September, when it remains stationary for a period of about
three weeks, sometimes a little less. In October it rises
again, and attains its highest level. From this period it
begins to subside, and, though it rises yet once more, and
reaches occasionally its former highest point, it sinks steadily
until the month of June, when it is again at its lowest level.

The modern ceremony of t Cutting the Dam' Cutting the Dam, of the river
takes place generally in the second or third week of August
at Fum el-Khalig, at Cairo. In ancient days the ceremony
of cutting the canals was accompanied with great festivities,
and great attention was paid to the height of the river
in various parts of Egypt, that the cutting might take place
at the most favourable time. We learn, on the authority
of Seneca, that offerings of gold and other gifts were thrown

. The seven mouths were called the Pelusiac, Tanitic, Mendesian,
Phatnitic, Sebennytic, Bolbitic, and the Canopic.
