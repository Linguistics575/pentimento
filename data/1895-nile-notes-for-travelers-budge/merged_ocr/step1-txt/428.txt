"people is indicated by their remains being found between
"Gebelen and Abydos, over rather more than a hundred
"miles of the Nile valley...... The invaders completely

Luxor or the 1% rna side, and every visitor will much
appreciate the excellent results which have attended the
completion of this great undcrtakingd Archaeologists will

f M. Nasi.le calculates that in two winters only he had removed

from the Temple 60,000 cubic metres of rubbish and stones, which
were carried away to a distance of 200 yards.
