128 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

rock, upon which was built by Darius another monument to
tell passers-by that he it was who made the canal. The
track of the canal through the Bitter Lakes is marked by a
double row of buoys; the distance between each buoy is
330 yards, and the space between the two rows is about
thirty yards. At a little distance to the north of the Bitter
lake is Tusan, which may be easily identified by means of
the tomb of the Muhammadan saint Ennedek. Shortly
after Lake Timsah, or the'Crocodile Lake,' is reached, on
the north side of which is the town of Isma'iliya, formerly
the head-quarters of the staff in charge of the various
works connected with the construction of the canal. The
canal channel through the lake is marked by buoys as in
the Bitter Lakes. Soon after re-entering the canal the
plain of El-Gisr, or the'bridge,' is entered; it is about
fifty-five feet above the level of the sea. Through this a
channel about eighty feet deep had to be cut. Passing
through Lake Balah, el-Kantara,'the bridge,' a place
situated on a height between the Balah and Menzaleh
Lakes, is reached. It is by this natural bridge that every
invading army must have entered Egypt, and its appellation,
the'Bridge of Nations,' is most appropriate. On the east
side of the canal, not far from el-Kantara, are some ruins
of a building which appears to have been built by
Rameses IL, and a little beyond Kantara begins Lake
Menzaleh. About twenty miles to the east are the ruins of
Pelusium. The canal is carried through Lake Menzaleh in
a perfectly straight line until it reaches Port Sa'id.

The town of Port Sa'id is the product of the Suez Canal,
and has a population of about [ 2,000. It stands on the
island which forms part of the narrow tract of land which
separates Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean. The
first body of workmen landed at the spot which afterwards
became Port Sa'id in 1859, and for many years the place
was nothing but a factory and a living-place for workmen.
