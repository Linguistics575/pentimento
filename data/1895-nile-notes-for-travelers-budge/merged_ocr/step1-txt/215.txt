589. Copy of a work written by a scribe called Ani, who
gives his son Khensu-hetep advice as to judicious behaviour in all the varied scenes of life; the following are
taken from his precepts :--
"If a man cometh to seek thy counsel, let this drive
thee to books for information.

"Enter not into the house of another; if a man maketh
thee to enter his house it is an honour for thee.

"Spy not upon the acts of another from thy house.

"Be not the first to enter or to leave an assembly lest
thy name be tarnished.

"The sanctuary of God abhorreth noisy declamations.
Pray humbly and with a loving heart, whose words
are spoken silently. God will then protect thee, and
hear thy petitions, and accept thy offerings.

"Consider what hath been. Set before thee a correct
rule of life as an example to follow. The messenger
of death will come to thee as to all others to carry
thee away; yea, he standeth ready. Words will profit
thee nothing, for he cometh, he is ready! Say not,
'I am a child, wouldst thou in very truth bear me
away?' Thou knowest not how thou wilt die. Death
cometh to meet the babe at his mother's breast, even
as he meeteth the old man who hath finished his
course.

"Take heed with all diligence that thou woundest no
man with thy words.
