214 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT

three different ways, and the price to be paid for preserving
a body varied according to the manner in which the work
was done. In the first and most expensive method the brain
was extracted through the nose by means of an iron probe,
and the intestines were removed entirely from the body
through an incision made in the side with a sharp Ethiopian
stone. The intestines were cleaned and washed in palm wine,
and, having been covered with powdered aromatic gums,
were placed in jars. The cavity in the body was filled up
with myrrh and cassia and other fragrant and astringent substances, and was sewn up again. The body was next laid
in natron for seventy days,' and when these were over, it
was carefully washed, and afterwards wrapped up in strips
of fine linen smeared on their sides with gum. The cost of
mummifying a body in this fashion was a talent of silver,
i.e., about £250.

In the second method of mummifying the brain was
not removed at all, and the intestines were simply dissolved
and removed in a fluid state. The body was also laid in
salt or natron which, it is said, dissolved everything except
the skin and bones. The cost of mummifying in this
manner was 22 mime, or about £60.

The third method of embalming was employed for the
poor only. It consisted simply of cleaning the body by
injecting some strong astringent, and then salting the body
for seventy days. The cost in this case was very little.

The account given by Diodorus agrees generally with
that of Herodotus. He adds, however, that the incision
was made on the left side of the body, and that the
"disisicctor" having made the incision fled away, pursued
and stoned by those who had witnessed the ceremony. It
would seem that the dissector merely fulfilled a religious
obligation in fleeing away, and that he had not much to
fear. Diodorus goes on to say that the Egyptians kept the
