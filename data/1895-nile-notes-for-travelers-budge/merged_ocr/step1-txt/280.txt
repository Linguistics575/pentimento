256 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

the rock and swim out to any passing boat to beg for
charity, the Patriarch has forbidden this practice, but it is
not entirely discontinued. Two or three miles from the
convent are some ancient quarries having rock bas-reliefs
representing Rameses 111. making an offering to the crocodile god Sebek Fm before Amen-Ra.

MINYEH.

Minyeh, ryr-sl- miles from Cairo, on the west bank of the
Nile, is the capital of the province of the same name, its

Arabic name is derived from the Coptic Mone, ALONE,

which in turn represents the Egyptian Et9, Mort in its old
Q

name Chufu-menit. There is a large sugar factory here in

which about 2,000 men are employed. A few miles south,
on the eastern side of the river, are some tombs, which

appear to have been hewn during the led or IVth dynasty.

BENI HASAN.

Beni Hasan, I7I miles from Cairo, on the east bank
of the Nile, is remarkable for the valuable historical tombs
which are situated at a short distance from the site of the
villages grouped under that name. The villages of the
"Children of Hass" m" were destroyed by order of Muhammad'Ali on account of the thievish propensities of their
inhabitants. The Speos Artemidos is the first rock excavation visited here. The king who first caused this cavern
to be hewn out was Thothmes 111.; about 250 years later
Seti I, made additions to it, but it seems never to have been
finished. The cavern was dedicated to the lion-goddess
Sechet, who was called Artemis by the Greeks; hence the
name "cavern of Artemis." The portico had originally
two rows of columns, four in each; the cavern is about
21 feet square, and the niche in the wall at the end was
probably intended to hold a statue of Sechet.
