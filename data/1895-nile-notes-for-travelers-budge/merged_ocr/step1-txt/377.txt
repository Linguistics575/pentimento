living rock, is a smaller temple, about 84 feet long, which
was dedicated to the goddess Hathor by Rameses II. and
his wife Nefert-Ari. The front is ornamented with statues
of the king, his wife, and some of his children, and over
the door are his names and titles. In the hall inside are six
square Hathor-headed pillars also inscribed with the names
and titles of Rameses and his wife. In the small chamber
at the extreme end of the temple is an interesting scene in
which the king is making an offering to Hathor in the form
of a cow; she is called the "lady of Abshek," and is
standing behind a figure of the king.
