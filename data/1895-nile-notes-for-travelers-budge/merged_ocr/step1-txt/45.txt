# "He was a most expert logician, but perverted his talents to evil
purposes, and had the audacity to preach what no one before him had
ever suggested, namely, that the Son of God was made out of that
which had no prior existence; that there was a period of time in which
He existed not; that, as possessing free will, He was capable of
virtue, or of vice; and that He was created and made."-Sozomen,
Eccles. Hist., Bk. L, ch. IS. For the statement of the views of Arias
by his opponent Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, see his letter
