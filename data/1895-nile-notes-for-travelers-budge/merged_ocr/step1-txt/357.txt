ASWAN. 3 3 3

nothing definite can be said, but Arabic writers describe it as
a flourishing town, and they relate that a plague once swept
off 20,000 of its inhabitants. Aswan was famous for its
wine in Ptolemaic times. The town has suffered greatly at
the hands of the Persians, Arabs, and Turks on the north,
and Nubians, by whom it was nearly destroyed in the twelfth
century, on the south. The oldest ruins in the town are
those of a Ptolemaic temple, which are still visible.

The island of Elephantine' lies a little to the north
of the cataract just opposite Aswan, and has been famous
in all ages as the key of Egypt from the south; the
Romans garrisoned it with numerous troops, and it represented the southern limit of their empire. The island
itself was very fertile, and it is said that its vines and
fig-trees retained their leaves throughout the year. The
kings of the Vth dynasty sprang from Elephantine. The
gods worshipped here by the Egyptians were called Chnemu,
Sati and Sept, and on this island Amenophis III. built
a temple, remains of which were visible in the early
part of this century. Of the famous Nilometer which
stood here, Strabo says: "The Nilometer is a well upon
the banks of the Nile, constructed of close-fitting stones,
on which are marked the greatest, least, and mean
risings of the Nile; for the water in the well and in the
river rises and subsides simultaneously. Upon the wall

. "A little above Elephantine is the lesser cataract, where the
boatmen exhibit a sort of spectacle to the governors. The cataract is
in the middle of the river, and is formed by a ridge of rocks, the upper
part of which is level, and thus capable of receiving the river, but
terminating in a precipice, where the water dashes down. On each
side towards the land there is a stream, up which is the chief ascent for
vessels. The boatmen sail up by this stream, and, dropping down to
the cataract, are impelled with the boat to the precipice, the crew and
the boats escaping unhurt." (Strsibo, Bk. xvii. chap. i., 49, Falconer's

translation.) Thus it appears that "shooting the cataract I? is a very
.oldy1musement.
