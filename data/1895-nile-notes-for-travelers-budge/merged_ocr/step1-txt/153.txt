CAIRO TO SUEZ. I 29

The harbour and the two breakwaters which protect it are
remarkable pieces of work; the breakwater on the west is
lengthened yearly to protect the harbour from the mudcarrying current which always flows from the west, and
would block up the canal but for the breakwater. Near
the western breakwater is the lighthouse, about 165 feet
high; the electric light is used in it, and can be seen for a
distance of twenty miles. The port is called Sa'id in
honour of Sa'id Pasha. The fresh water used is brought
in iron pipes laid along the western side of the canal
from Isma'iliya. The choice fell upon this spot for the
Mediterranean end of the canal because water sufficiently
deep for ocean-going ships was found within two miles
of the shore. The total length of the canal, including
the buoyed channel at the Suez end, is about one hundred
miles. The Suez Canal Company's light railway, carrying
passengers, runs directly to Isma'iliya at 9 A.M., to connect
with the midday train from Suez to Cairo.

Jews might worship. The site of the town was occupied in
very early times by a temple and other buildings which were
set up by Rameses H. and Rameses III.; a large number of
the tiles which formed parts of the walls of these splendid
works are preserved in the British Museum.
