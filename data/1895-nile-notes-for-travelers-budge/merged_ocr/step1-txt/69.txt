THE NILE.

The river Nile is one of the longest rivers in the world;

its Egyptian name was Haiphi 1C2tt' and the Arabs
. Cl IN MMM

call it bahr, or'sea.' It is formed by the junction, at
15Â° 34' N. lat., and 300 30' 58" E. long, of two great
arms, the Ball" el-Away, Let, the'turbid,' or Blue Nile,
from the S.E., and the Balm er-Abyad., i.e., the'clear,' or
White Nile, from the S.W. * The eastern branch rises in
Goyam, in Abyssinia, at an elevation of about 10,000 feet
above the level of the sea. Flowing through the lake of
Dembea it passes round the eastern frontier of Goyam, till,
when nearing the 10th degree N. lat., it takes a northwest direction, which it preserves until it reaches Kharttun,
here it unites with the Bahr el-Abyad, the other great arm,
which flows from the S.W. The Bahr el-Abyad, or White
Nile, is so called because of the fine whitish clay which
colours its waters. It is broader and deeper than the
eastern arm, and it brings down a much larger volume of
water; the ancients appear to have regarded it as the true
Nile. There can, however, be no doubt that the Bahr elAzralr has the best right to be considered the true Nile,
for during the violent and rapid course which it takes from
the Abyssinian mountains, it carries down with it all the
rich mud which, during the lapse of ages, has been spread

' The White Nile rises in the mountainous districts a few degrees
north of the Equator, and the principal streams which flow into it
are those of the Sobit, Giraffe, and Gazelle rivers. It is not navigable,
and its banks are so low that its whitish slimy deposit often extends
to a distance of two miles from the stream. For about a hundred
miles south of Kharip1m the river is little more than a marsh.
