262 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

it was found that he had conceived a rooted dislike to the
worship of Amen-Ra, the king of the gods and great lord of
Thebes, and that he preferred the worship of the disk of the
sun to that of Amen-Ra,. as a sign of his opinions he called
himself "beloved of the sun's disk," instead of the usual and
time-honoured "beloved of Amen." The native Egyptian
priesthood disliked the foreign queen, and the sight of her son
with his protruding chin, thick lips, and other characteristic
features of the negro race, found no favour in their sight;
that such a man should openly despise the worship of
Amen-Ri-i was a thing intolerable to the priesthood, and angry
words and acts were, on their part, the result. In answer to
their objections the king ordered the name of Amen-Ra to
be chiselled out of all the monuments, even from his father's
names. Rebellion then broke out, and Chut-enciten
thought it best to leave Thebes7 and to found a new city for
himself at a place between Memphis and Thebes, now
called Tell el-Amarna. The famous architect Bek, whose
father, Men, served under Amenophis 111., designed the
temple buildings, and in a very short time a splendid town
with beautiful granite sculptures sprang out of the desert.
As an insult to the priests and people of Thebes, he built
a sandstone and granite temple at Thebes in honour of the
god Harmachis. When Chut-en-Men's new town, Chut-hten,
"the splendour of the sun's disk," was finished, his mother
Thi came to live there; and here the king passed his life
quietly with his mother, wife, and seven daughters. He
died leaving no male issue, and each of the husbands of
his daughters became king. In 1887 a number of important cuneiform tablets, which confirmed in a remarkable
manner many facts connected with this period of Egyptian
history, were found at Tell el-Amarna (see page 187). The
tombs in the rocks near Tell el-Amarna are of considerable
interest. In 1892 Mr. Petrie uncovered a painted fresco
pavement about 51 by 16 feet.
