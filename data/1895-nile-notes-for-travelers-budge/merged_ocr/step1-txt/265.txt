lay, and the difficult engineering part of the task was ably
accomplished by Major Arthur Bagnold, ICE. This statue
is made of a fine hard limestone, and measures about fortytwo feet in height; it is probably one of the statues which
stood in front of the temple of Ptab, mentioned by
Herodotus and Diodorus. The prenomen of Rameses 11.
(ji') t5'? w ] Wrusr-mst-setep-ea-Ra, is inscribed on
tfirliiilT-Ji' the statue, and on the end of the roll which the
king carries in his hand are the words "Rameses, beloved

and son of Rameses. The famous temple of Ptah founded
by Menes was situated to the south of the statue.

SAKKARAH.
The name Sakkarah is probably derived from the name
of the Egyptian god Seker U!, who was connected with
the resurrection of the dead. The tract of land at Sal.rlplrah
which formed the great burial ground of the ancient
Egyptians of all periods, is about four and a half miles
long and one mile wide; the most important antiquities
there are: I. the Step Pyramid; II. the Pyramids of Units,
Teth, and Pepi, kings of the Vth and VIth dynasties,' III.
the Serapeum; and IV. the Tomb of Thi. Admirers of
M. Mariette will be interested to see the house in which
this distinguished mmnt lived.

by Manetho, and (no k l Am in the tablet of Abydos),

who is said to have built a pyramid at Kochome (i.e., Ka
Kam) near Salglgarah. Though the date of this pyramid is
not known accurately, it is probably right to assume that it
is older than the pyramids of Gizeh. The door which led
into the pyramid was inscribed with the name of a king
called Mmub, and M. Mariette found the same name on
