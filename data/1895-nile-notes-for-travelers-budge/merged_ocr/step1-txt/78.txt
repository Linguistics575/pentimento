54 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

of the ancient Egyptian religion from the papyri and other
native records; but it is also true that during the reigns of
these two Ptolemies the Egyptians were firmly kept in
obscurity, and that the ancient priest-college of Heliopolis
was suppressed. A century or two after the Christian era,
Greek had obtained such a hold upon the inhabitants of
Egypt that the Egyptian Christians, the followers and
disciples of St. Mark, were obliged to use the Greek
alphabet to write down the Egyptian, that is to say Coptic
translation of the books of the Old and New Testaments.
The letters 99, sh, q, f, Jo, I', 2), J, (f: h X: e,, k, were
added from the demotic forms of hieratic characters to
represent sounds which were unknown in the Greek language. During the Greek rule over Egypt many of the
hieroglyphic characters had new phonetic values given to
them; by this time the knowledge of hieroglyphic writing
had practically died out.

The history of the decipherment of hieroglyphics is of
great interest, but no thorough account of it can he
given here; only the most important facts connected
with it can be mentioned. During the XVItlr-NVIIIth
centuries many attempts were made by scholars to interpret the hieroglyphic inscriptions then known to the
world, but they resulted in nothing useful. The fact is that
they did not understand the nature of the problem to
be solved, and they failed to perceive the use of the
same hieroglyphic character as a phonetic or determinative
in the same inscription. In 1799, a French officer discovered at Bolbitane or Rosetta a basalt slab inscribed in the
hieroglyphic, demotie, and Greek characters; it was shortly
after captured by the English army, and taken to London,
where it was carefully examined by Dr. Thomas Young,.'

fourteen he is said to have been versed in Greek, Latin, Flench,
