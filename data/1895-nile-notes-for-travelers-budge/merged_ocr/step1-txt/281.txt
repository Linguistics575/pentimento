TOMBS "AMEN ] AND CHNEMirWn'EP. 257

There are about fifteen rock-tombs at Beni Hasan, but
only two of them, those of Ameni and Chnemu-hetep, are
of interest generally speaking. They were all hewn during
the XIIth dynasty, but have preserved the chief characteristics of the mastabas of Salrlpirah, that is to say, they
consist of a chamber and a shaft leading down to a corridor,
which ends in the chamber containing the sarcophagus and
the mummy. As in the tombs at Aswan, a suitable layer
of stone was sought for in the hill, and when found the
tombs were hewn out. The walls were partly smoothed,
and then covered with a thin layer of plaster upon which
the scenes in the lives of the people buried there might be
painted. The columns and the lower parts of some of the
tombs are coloured red to resemble granite. The northern
tomb is remarkable for columns somewhat resembling those
subsequently termed Doric. Each of the four columns in
the tomb is about I7 feet high, and has sixteen sides, the
ceiling between each connecting beam, which runs from
column to column, is vaulted. The columns in the
southern tombs have lotus capitals, and are exceedingly
graceful.

The Tomb of Ameni belongs to the northern group
of tombs, he is not the head of the family which was buried
at Beni Hasan, as has been sometimes asserted, for he
had no children. IRecueil de Travatix, L, p. 175.) AmeniAmenemhat lived during the reign of Usertsen L, the second
king of the XIIth dynasty, he was one of the feudal lords
of Egypt, and chief of the home of Melo or Antinoii, and
chief president of the prophets. When quite a young man
he was sent in the place of his father, who was too old for
such work, to Ethiopia at the head of an army, he settled the
frontiers of the country there, and came back to the king
laden with spoil and tribute. In many other expeditions he
was also perfectly successful. In the inscription on the tomb
he says, "I have done all that I have said. I am a gracious
