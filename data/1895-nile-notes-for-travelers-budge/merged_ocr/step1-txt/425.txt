DAHSHijR. 401

The southern brick pyramid of Dahshtir is on a lower
level than the northern, and much of its upper portion has
been removed by the fellaZzin, who treated it as a quarry for
the bricks with which they built their houses. It is, however, in a better state of preservation than its fellow, and is
still an imposing object in the Egyptian landscape. M. de
Morgan's estimate of the length of each side is 125 feet;
this pyramid is, like the northern, built of unburnt bricks,
and it was surrounded by a wall of unbaked bricks, which
enclosed the ground wherein the members of the royal
family were buried. While excavating in this spot, M. de
Morgan found some fragments ofa base ofa statue inscribed

with the prenomen of Amen-em-bat III. C C) La ],

and judging from this fact and from the general appearance
of the site, he would ascribe this necropolis to the period of
the XIIth dynasty. About 20 feet from the enclosing wall,
at the north-east corner of the pyramid, two pits were found,
and the second of these proved to be the entrance to a
tomb. An inclined brick wall led to a small vaulted door,
and in the ruins here the workmen found a small beautifully
worked gilded wooden statue, on the base of which was
inscribed, "Horus, the son of the Sun, of his body, giver of
