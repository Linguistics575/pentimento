38 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

The population of Egypt to-day comprises the Fellibin,
Copts, Bedawin, Jews, Turks, Negroes, Nubians and people
from Abyssinia, Armenians and Europeans.

The FelWpin amount to about four-fifths of the entire
population of Egypt, and are chiefly employed in agricultural
pursuits. In physical type they greatly resemble the ancient
Egyptians as depicted on the monuments. Their complexion is dark; they have straight eyebrows, high cheek
bones, flat noses with low bridges, slightly protruding
jaws, broad shoulders, large mouths and full lips. The
colour of their skin becomes darker as the south is
approached. The whole of the cultivation of Egypt is

such as Asyiit and Ahmim. The name Copt is derived

derived from an ancient Egyptian name for Memphis,

number of Copts in Egypt today is estimated at about
350,000, and the greater number of them are engaged in
the trades of goldsmiths, clothworkers, etc.; a respectable
body of clerks and accountants in the postal, telegraph and
government offices in Egypt, is drawn from their community.
They are clever with their fingers, and are capable of rapid
education up to a certain point; beyond this they rarely
go. Physically, they are of a finer type than the fellitbin;
their heads are longer and their features are more European.

The Copts are famous in ecclesiastical history for having
embraced with extraordinary zeal and rapidity the doctrines
of Christianity as preached by St. Mark at Alexandria.
Before the end of the third century A.D. Egypt was filled
with hundreds of thousands of ascetics, monks, recluse,
