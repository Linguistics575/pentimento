these being joined by new comers, the city of Fostat at
length arose. It was enlarged by Ahmed ibn Tuliln,
who built a mosque there; by Khaman1yeh, who built a

government from there, and founded Masr el-Phira, "Mast
the Victorious," near Fostat. Fostat, which was also known
by the name of Masr, was henceforth called May el-Atilia.
During the reign of Saléheddin the walls of the new city were
thoroughly repaired and the citadel was built. Sultan after
Sultan added handsome buildings to the town, and though it
suffered from plagues and fires, it gained the reputation of
being one of the most beautiful capitals in the Muhammadan empire. In 1517 it was captured by Selim I., and

remained so until its conquest by Napoleon Bonaparte in
1798. Cairo was occupied by Muhammad'Ali in 1805
and the massacre of the Mamelukes took place March I,
1811.

been restored in the eighth century, the first church built
