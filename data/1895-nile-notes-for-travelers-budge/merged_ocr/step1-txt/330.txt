VII. Dér el-Bahari. This temple was built by Witshepset, the sister and wife of Thothmes IL, B.C. 1600. The
finest marble limestone was used in its construction, and its
architect seems to have been an able man called Senmut,
who was honoured with the friendship of the queen, and
promoted by her to be chief clerk of the works. Before the
temple was an avenue of sandstone sphinxes and two
obelisks. It was built in stages on the side of a hill, and
its courts were connected by means of flights of steps.
As early as the XXIInd dynasty the temple had fallen into
disuse, and soon after this time its chambers appear to have
been used for sepulchres. The wall sculptures are beautiful
specimens of art, and depict the return of Egyptian soldiers
from some military expedition, and the scenes which took
place during the expedition which the queen organized and
sent off to Punt. This latter expedition was most successful,
and returned to Egypt laden with things the "like of which
had never before been seen in that land." The prince of
Punt came to Egypt with a large following, and became a
vassal of Witshepset. *
