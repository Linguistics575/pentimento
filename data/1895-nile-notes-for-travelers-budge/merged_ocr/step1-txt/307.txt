gates; but that there were many large porches to the
temples, whence the city was called Hecatompyhts, a hundred
gates, for many gates'. yet that it was certain they had in it
20,000 chariots of war; for there were a hundred stables all
along the river from Memphis to Thebes towards Lybia,
each of which was capable to hold two hundred horses, the

Egypt.... There, they say, are the wonderful sepulchres

to the city of Apollo is T hebes, now called Diospolis,'with
her hundred gates, through each of which issue 200 men,
