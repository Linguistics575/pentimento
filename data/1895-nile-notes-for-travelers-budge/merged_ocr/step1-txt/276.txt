district," and the name Fayyihn is the Arabic form of the
Coptic 4hiosx, r "the water." The Fayytlm district has an
area of about 850 square miles, and is watered by a branch
of the Nile called the Balyryeuf, which flows into it through
the Libyan mountains. On the west of it lies the Birket elJ.Curiho. This now fertile land is thought to have been
reclaimed from the desert by Amenemhat 111., a king of
the XIIth dynasty. The Birket el-Nurtuo was formerly
thought to have been a part of Lake Moeris, t but more
modern travellers place both it and the Labyrinth to the
east of the Fayytim district. The Bahr- Yu suf is said by
some to have been excavated under the direction of the
patriarch Joseph, but there is no satisfactory evidence for
this theory; strictly speaking it is an arm of the Nile, which
has always needed cleaning out from time to time, and
the Yf1suf, or Joseph, after whom it is named, was probably
one of the Muhammadan rulers of Egypt. Herodotus says:
of Lake Moeris, "The waterin this lake does not spring from
the soil, for these parts are excessively dry, but it is conveyed
through a channel from the Nile, and for six months it flows
into the lake, and six months out again into the Nile. And
during the six months that it flows out it yields a talent of
silver (£240) every day to the king's treasury from the fish;
but when the water is flowing, into it, twenty mime (£80)?
