the XIIth dynasty. Ofthe history of this Egyptian gentleman
the following facts are known. During one of the expeditions
which Amenemhat I. made through Egypt, he raised to the
rank of a feudal lord and "governor of the hilly land on the
east of the Home of Meb, "or Antinoe, the maternal grandfather of ChnemuWetep. In the reign of Usertsen L, the
