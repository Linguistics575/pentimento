known. Its fellow obelisk stands in the Place de la
Concorde, Paris.

After the burning and sacking of this temple by the
Persians, some slight repairs, and rebuilding of certain
chambers, were carried out by some of the Ptolemies, the
name of one of whom (Philopator) is found inscribed on
the temple. Certain parts of the temple appear to have
been used by the Copts as a church, for the ancient
sculptures have been plastered over and painted with
figures of saints, etc.

IL The Temple at Karnak. The ruins of the buildings at Karnak are perhaps the most wonderful of any in
Egypt, and they merit many visits from the traveller. It is
probable that this spot was "holy ground" from a very
early to a very late period, and we know that a number of
kings from Thothmes III. to Euergetes II. lavished much
wealth to make splendid the famous shrine of Amen in the
Apts, and other temples situated there. The temples of
Luxor and Karnak were united by an avenue about 6,500
feet long and 80 feet wide, on each side of which was
arranged a row of sphinxes, from the fact that these monuments are without names, M. Mariette thought that the
avenue was constructed at the expense of the priests or the
wealthy inhabitants of the town, just as in later days the
pronaos of the temple at Denderah was built by the people
of that town. At the end of this avenue, to the right, is a
road which leads to the so-called Temple of Mut, which
was also approached by an avenue of sphinxes. Within
the enclosure there stood originally two temples, both of
which were dedicated to Amen, built during the reign of
Amenophis III.; Rameses II. erected two obelisks in front
of the larger temple. To the north-west of these a smaller
temple was built in Ptolemaic times, and the ruins on one
side of it show that the small temples which stood there
were either founded or restored by Rameses IL, Osorkon,
