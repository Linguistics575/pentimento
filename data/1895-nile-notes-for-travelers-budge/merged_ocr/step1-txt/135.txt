THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT. Ill

therefore, it is to be imputed that there are so many different
sepulchres of Osiris shewn in Egypt; for we are told that
wherever Isis met with any of the scattered limbs of her
husband, she there buried it. There are others, however, who contradict this relation, and tell us that this
variety of sepulchres was owing rather to the policy of the
queen, who, instead of the real body, as was pretended,
presented these several cities with the image only of her
husband; and that she did this not only to render the
honours which would by this means be paid to his memory
more extensive, but likewise that she might hereby elude
the malicious search of Typhon; who, if he got the better
of Horus in the war wherein they were going to be engaged,
distracted by this multiplicity of sepulchres, might despair
of being able to find the true one.......

"After these things Osiris, returning from the other
world, appeared to his son Horus, encouraged him to the
battle, and at the same time instructed him in the exercise
of arms. He then asked him,'what he thought the most
glorious action a man could perform?' to which Horus
replied,'to revenge the injuries offered to his father and
mother.' This reply much rejoiced Osiris....... We
are moreover told that amongst the great numbers who
were continually deserting from Typhon's party was the
goddess Thoueris, and thata serpent pursuing her as she was
coming over to Horus, was slain by his soldiers. Afterwards
it came to a battle between them, which lasted many days,
but victory at length inclined to Horus, Typhon himself
being taken prisoner. Isis, however, to whose custody he
was committed, was so far from putting him to death, that
she even loosed his bonds and set him at liberty. This
action of his mother so extremely incensed Horus, that he
laid hands upon her and pulled off the ensign of royalty
which she wore on her head, and instead thereof Hermes
clapt on an helmet made in the shape of an ox's head.
