* Nik is one of the names of Apepi, the demon of mist, cloud, and
night, who was supposed to swallow up the sun daily; he was the
enemy, par excellence, whom the Sun-god R5 was supposed to fight
against and overcome. Apepi was represented under the form of a
serpent with knives stuck in his back W. Compare the following
extract from the service for his destruction which was recited daily in
the temple of Amen-RE, at Thebes:" Fall down upon thy face, Apepi,
enemy of Ra l The flame coming forth from the eye of Horus comes
against thee, a mighty flame which comes forth from the eye of Horus,
comes against thee. Thou art thrust down into the flame of fire which
rushes out against thee, a flame which is fatal to thy soul, thy intelligence, thy words of power, thy body and thy shade. The flame prevails
over thee, it drives darts into thy soul, it makes an end of whatever thou
hast, and sends goads into thy form. Thou hast fallen by the eye of
Horus, which is mighty over its enemy, which devours thee, and which
leads on the mighty flame against thee; the eye of Ra prevails over
thee, the flame devours thee, and nothing of thee remains. Get thee
back, thou art hacked in pieces, thy soul is parched, thy name is buried
in oblivion, silence covers it, it is overthrown; thou art put an end to
and buried under threefold oblivion. Get thee back, retreat thou,
t_hou art cut in pieces and removed from him that is in his shrine. O
Apepi, thou doubly crushed one, an end to thee, an end to thee!
Mayest than never rise up again I The eye of Horus prevails over thee
