234 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

about 150 feet long, the paws are So feet long, the head is
30 feet long, the face is 14 feet wide, and from the top of
the head to the base of the monument the distance is about
70 feet. Originally there probably were ornaments on the
head, the whole of which was covered with a limestone

destruction of its features by the Muhammadan rulers of
Egypt, some of whom caused it to be used for a target.
Around this imposing relic of antiquity, whose origin is
wrapped in mystery, a number of legends and superstitions
have clustered in all ages; but Egyptology has shown

granite and limestone temple excavated by M. Mariette
in 1853; statues of Chephren (now at Gizeh) were found
in it, and hence it has been generally supposed that he
was the builder of it. It is a good specimen of the solid
simple buildings which the Egyptians built during the
Ancient Empire. In one chamber, and at the end of the
passage leading from it, are hewn in the wall niches which
were probably intended to hold mummies.

THE TOMB OF NUMBERS.

This tomb was made for Chrf-R5-rutch, a "royal relative"
and priest of Chephren (Cha-f-Wi), the builder of the second
