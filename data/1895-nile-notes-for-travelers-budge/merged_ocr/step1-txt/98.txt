life which was inherited by those who were deemed
worthy of it.

Of the funeral procession we are able to gain some idea
from the vignettes which are given in hieroglyphic copies
of the Book of the Dead. In the centre of p. 75 the dead
man is seen lying on a bier in a chest mounted on a boat
with runners, which is drawn by oxen. In the rear is a
sepulchral ark or chest surmounted by a figure of Anubis,
the god of the dead. In front of the boat are a group of
women (p. 76) beating their faces and wailing, and a youth
carrying the staff, chair, and box of the deceased. At the

Hu-nefer to receive the final honours; behind him, and
embracing him, stands Anubis, the god of the dead, and at
his feet in front kneel his wife Nasha and her daughter to
take a last farewell of the body. By the side of a table
of offerings stand three priests'. the sew priest, who wears a
panther's skin, holding in his right hand a libation vase,
