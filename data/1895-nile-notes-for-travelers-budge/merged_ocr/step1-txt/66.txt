42 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

the most southern part of Upper Egypt, Nubia, and
Abyssinia, are included among this number. Among these
three tribes the institutions of Muhammad are not observed
with any great strictness. When the Bedhwin settle down
to village or town life, they appear to lose all the bravery and
fine qualities of independent manhood which characterize
them when they live in their home, the desert.

The inhabitants of Cairo, Alexandria, and other large
towns form a class of people quite distinct from the other
inhabitants of Egypt; in Alexandria there is a very large
Greek element, and in Cairo the number of Turks is very
great. In the bazaars of Cairo one may see the offspring of
marriages between members of nearly every European
nation and Egyptian or Nubian women, the colour of their
skins varying from a dark brick-red to nearly white. The
shopkeepers are fully alive to their opportunities of making
money, and would, beyond doubt, become rich but for their
natural indolence and belief in fate. Whatever they appear
or however much they may mask their belief in the Muhammadan religion, it must never be forgotten that they have
the greatest dislike to every religion but their own. The
love of gain alone causes them to submit to the remarks
made upon them by Europeans, and to.suffer their entrance
and sojourning among them.

The Nubians or Berbers, as they are sometimes called,
inhabit the tract of land which extends from Aswan or
Syene to the fourth cataract. The word Nubia appears to
be derived from nm),'gold,' because Nubia was a goldproducing country. The word Berber is considered to mean
'barbarian' by some, and to be also of Egyptian origin.
They speak a language which is allied to some of the North
African tongues, and rarely speak Arabic well. The
Nubians found in Egypt are generally doorkeepers and
domestic servants, who can usually be depended upon for
their honesty and obedience.
