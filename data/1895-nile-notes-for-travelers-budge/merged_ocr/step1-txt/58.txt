34 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

of the pictures on the tombs is supported and confirmed by
the skulls and bones of mummies which anthropologists have
examined and measured during the last few years; hence
all attempts to prove that the Egyptian is of negro origin
are overthrown at the outset by facts which cannot be controverted. In cases where the Egyptians intermarried with
people of Semitic origin, we find aquiline noses.' One of
the most remarkable things connected with the Egyptians of
today is the fact that a very large number of them have
reproduced, without the slightest alteration, many of the
personal features of their ancestors who lived seven
thousand years ago. The traveller is often accompanied
on a visit to a tomb of the Ancient Empire by a modern
Egyptian who, in his attitudes, form, and face, is a veritable
reproduction of the hereditary nobleman who built the tomb
which he is examining. It may be that no invading race
has ever found itself physically able to reproduce persistently its own characteristics for any important length of
time, or it may be that the absorption of such races by
intermarriage with the natives, together with the influence

* A very good example of this is seen in the black granite head of
the statue of Osorkon 11., presented to the British Museum (No. 1063)
by the Committee of the Egypt Exploration Fund. The lower part
of the nose is broken away, but enough of the upper part remains to
show what was its original angle. It was confidently asserted that this
head belonged to a statue of one of the so-called Hyksos kings, but the
assertion was not supported by any trustworthy evidence. The face
and features are those of a man whose ancestors were Semites and
Egyptians, and men with similar countenance; are to be seen in the
desert to the south-east of Palestine to this day. Aclinching proofthat
the statue is not that ofa Hyksos king was brought forward by Prof.
Lanzone of Turin, who, in 1890, had in his possession a small statue
of Osorkon IL, having precisely the same face and features. The
XXIInd dynasty, to which this king belonged, were Semites, as their
names show, and they were always regarded by the Egyptians as
foreigners, and A,, the determinative of a man from a foreign

country, was placed after each of their names.
