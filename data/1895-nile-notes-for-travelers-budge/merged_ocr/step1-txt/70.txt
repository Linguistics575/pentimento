46 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

over the land on each side of its course and formed the
land of Egypt. In truth, then, Egypt is the gift of the
Baht el-Array. The course of the Baht el-Abyad was
traced by Linant in 1827 for about 160 miles from its confluence with the Bahr el-Azralp At the point of confluence
it measures about 600 yards across, a little farther up it is
from three to four miles wide, and during the inundation the
distance from side to side is twenty-one miles. In an ordinary
season it is about 24 feet deep.

The source of the Nile was not discovered by Bruce,
but by Captains Grant and Speke and Sir Samuel Baker.
Its parents are the Albert Nyanza and Victoria Nyanza
Lakes. The fountain-head of the Nile, Victoria Nyanza,
is a huge basin, far below the level of the country round
about, into which several streams empty themselves. About
zoo miles below Khartum the united river receives, on
the east side, the waters of the Atbara, which rises in the
mountains of Abyssinia, and from this point onwards to its
embouchure, a distance of about 1,750 miles, the Nile
receives no affluent whatever. From Kharttlm to Cairo the
Nile falls about 400 yards; its width is about 1,100 yards
in its widest part. The course of the Nile has been
explored to a length of about 3,500 miles. At Abu Hammed
the river turns suddenly to the south-west, and flows in this
direction until it reaches Donliola, where it again curves
to the north. The river enters Nubia, flowing over a ledge
of granite rocks which form the third cataract. Under the
22nd parallel N. lat. is the second cataract, which ends
a few miles above Wadi Halfah, and about 180 miles lower
down is the first cataract, which ends at Aswan, or Syene,
a little above the island of Elephantine. After entering
Egypt, the Nile flows in a steady stream, always to the
north, and deposits the mud which is the life of Egypt.
The breadth of the Nile valley varies from four to ten
miles in Nubia, and from fifteen to thirty in Egypt. The
