300 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

interior face of the second pylon are sculptured scenes in
the war of Rameses 11. against the Cheta, which took place
in the fifth year of his reign; in them he is represented
slaying the personal attendants of the prince of the Cheta.
Elsewhere is the famous scene in which Rameses, having

colossus was repaired no sound issued from it. Some
think that the noise was caused by the sun's rays striking

the colossus produced it by striking a stone. The inscriptions show that many distinguished Romans visited the
