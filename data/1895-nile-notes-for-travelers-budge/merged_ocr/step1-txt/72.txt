48 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

into the Nile at Philae by the priests to propitiate the
divinity of the river.

If the height of the inundation is about forty-five feet
the best results from agricultural labour are obtained;
a couple of feet of water, more or less, is always attended
with disastrous results either in the Delta or Upper Egypt.
The dykes, or embankments, which kept the waters of
the Nile in check, and regulated their distribution over
the lands, were, in Pharaonic days, maintained in a state of
efficiency by public funds, and, in the time of the Romans,
any person found destroying a dyke was either condemned
to hard labour in the public works or mines, or to be
branded and sent to one of the Oases. If we accept the
statements of Strabo, we may believe that the ancient system
of irrigation was so perfect that the varying height of the
inundation caused but little inconvenience to the inhabitants of Egypt, as far as the results of agricultural labours
were concerned, though an unusually high Nile would,
of course, wash away whole villages and drown much
cattle. If the statements made by ancient writers be compared, it will be seen that the actual height of the inundation is the same now as it always was, and that it
maintains the same proportion with the land it irrigate.
According to Sir Gardner Wilkinson (Ancient Egypt, IL,
431), the cubit measures of the Nilometers ought, after
certain periods, to be raised proportionately if we wish to
arrive at great accuracy in the measurement of the waters.
The level of the land, which always keeps pace with that of
the river, increases at the rate of six inches in a hundred years
in some places, and in others less. The proof of this is
that the highest scale in the Nilometer at the island of
Elephantine, which served to measure the inundation in
the reigns of the early Roman emperors, is now far below
the level of the ordinary high Nile; and the obelisk of
Heliopolis, the colossi at Thebes, and other similarly situated
