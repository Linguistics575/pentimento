IS FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan, Ingénieur civil
des Mines, was born on June 3rd, 1857, at the Chateau de
Bion, Loir-et-Cher, and is descended from a family which
came originally from Wales. For more than twenty
years he has devoted himself-to the study of archaeology,
but he is, nevertheless, a distinguished pupil of the School
of Mines at Paris, and is eminent as a geologist and
mathematician. To the exactness induced by the study of
mathematics, and to his scientific training as a geologist
and observer of nature, his works entirely owe their value,
for he arranges his historical, geographical, and other facts
in a logical manner, and never confounds fact with theory
or assumption with evidence. In 1882 he made a tour

he published in the Annales des Mines an important article
entitled, Note Sttt' fa glvlogit at T'iruluttrie vuhilre iii:
raymme tic Penile. During the years 1886-1889 he was
employed on a mission to Turkey-in-Asia, the Caucasus
and Armenia, and he published the scientific results of his
travels in two volumes, large 8vo, entitled, Mission Scimtijique (m Caucase. iywdes v1rdalogiques et historiques,
Paris, 1889. In this work M. de Morgan shows that he is
well acquainted with the statements about these countries
made by classical writers, that he is familiar with the best
works upon general archaeology, such as those of Sir John
Evans, Montelius and Mourier, and also that he knows well
the works of Brugsch, Maspero, George Smith, and of other
scholars of Assyriology and Egyptology at first hand. From
1889 to the beginning of 1892 M. de Morgan made an
