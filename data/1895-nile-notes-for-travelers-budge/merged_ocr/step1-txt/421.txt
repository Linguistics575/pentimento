DAHSHCR. 397

a granite chest containing four uninscribed alabaster Canopic
jars was found, and in another similar chest a worm-eaten
wooden box, containing four Canopic jars, was also discovered. The four sides of the box were inscribed, but
the jars were plain. While the ground of the galleries was
being carefully examined, a hollow in the rock was found,
and a few blows of the pick revealed a magnificent find ot
gold and silver jewellerylyingin aheap among the fragments
of the worm-eaten wooden box which held it. The box
was about eleven inches long, and had been inlaid with silver
hieroghyphics which formed the name of the princess
Hathor-Sat, for whom the ornaments had been made. It
would seem that special care had been taken by the friends
of the deceased to conceal her jewellery, and thus the
ancient spoilers of the tomb had overlooked it. Among
the objects found of special interest are the following y-
I. A gold pectoral, in the form of a shrine I inlaid with

carnelian, emeralds, and lapis- lazuli. In the centre IS

the cartouche of Usertsen ILEm _ $ C) E2 ii)

neteru Jyrtep KW- kheperd? ii, and on each side is the
hawk of Horus, wearing the double crown, and a disk

with pendant uraeus and "life" j, The inlaying

and carving are magnificent specimens of the goldsmith's work.

2. Two gold clasps of bracelets, each containing a reg?

inlaid with carnelian, emeralds, and lapis-lazuli, the
bracelets were set with pearls.

r Gold collar-clasp, inlaid with carnelian, emeralds, and
lapis-lazuli, formed of two lotus flowers, the stems of
which intertwine and form a knot, and a head of
Hathor.
