282 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

would have been impossible for the Egyptians to overlook it. The mountains on the east and west side of
the river sweep away from it, and leave a broad plain on
each bank of several square miles in extent. It has been
calculated that modern Paris could stand on this space of
ground. We have, unfortunately, no Egyptian description
of Thebes, or any statement as to its size; it may, however, be assumed from the remains of its buildings which

but of all others in the world. The fame therefore of the
riches and grandeur of this city was so noised abroad in
every place, that the poet Homer takes notice of it......
