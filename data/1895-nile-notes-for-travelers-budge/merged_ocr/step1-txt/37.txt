HISTORICAL SUMMARY. 13

Unfortunately there are no monuments whereby we can
correct or modify these figures. The Hyksos appear to
have made their way from the countries in and to the west
of Mesopotamia into Egypt. They joined with their
countrymen, who had already settled in the Delta, and
were able to defeat the native kings; it is thought that
their rule lasted 500 years, and that Joseph arrived in
Egypt towards the end of this period. The principal
Hyksos kings of the XVIth dynasty arc Apepat I. and
Apepi IL; Nubti and the native Egyptian princes ruled
under them. Under Se-qenen-R2, a Theban ruler of the
XVIIth dynasty, a war broke out between the Egyptians
and the Hyksos, which continued for many years, and
resulted in the expulsion of the foreign rulers. T
