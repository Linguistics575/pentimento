THE NILE BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND CATARACTS. 357

stone and cement. The whole of the sand and broken
stones which had become piled up in front of the entrance
to the small chamber re-opened by Mr. McCallum some
years ago was cleared away, and any dangerous break in the
rock was carefully repaired. All lovers of Egypt will
rejoice at the excellent way in which Captain Johnstone
has performed his difficult task, and we may now hope
that it will not be long before the repairs which are urgently
needed by temples and other buildings in other parts of
Egypt are undertaken by the able officers of the Royal
Engineers.

The village of Wadi Halfah, on the east bank of the
N ile, 802 miles from Cairo, marks the site of a part of the dis
trict called "Je,, 63 Buhen in the hieroglyphic inscription, where, as at DÃ©rr and Ibrim, the god Harmachis was

interesting flint weapons have been found, and a few miles
distant are the fossil remains of a forest. On the western
bank of the river, a little further south, are the remains of
a temple which, if not actually built, was certainly restored

later kings of Egypt, but it seems to have fallen into disuse soon after the Romans gained possession of Egypt.
The excavations recently carried out here by Lieut. H. G.
Lyons, R.E., have brought to light the ruins of temples
built by a king of the XIIth dynasty and Thothmes IV.
A few miles south of Wiidi Halfah begins the second cataract, a splendid view of which can be obtained from the

an interesting collection of names and dates, the like of
which probably exists nowhere else.
