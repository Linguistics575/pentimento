<span>THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH. 155<br/>
<br/>
Morgan, who at once began the task of <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-arranging </span>the<br/>
collection and of examining the contents of the "magazine "<br/>
with the view of increasing the number of exhibited objects.<br/>
During the past year the work has been pushed on with<br/>
great energy, and we believe that the visitors <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh<br/>
</span>Museum will greatly appreciate what the staff has done. It<br/>
will be remembered that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>in the palace, only<br/>
some thirty-eight contained antiquities two years ago; now,<br/>
however, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">eighty-seven </span>are used for exhibition purposes, and, for the first time, it is possible to see <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">what<br/>
</span>the Egyptian collection really consists<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the ground<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>the positions of several of the large monuments have<br/>
been changed, and the chronological arrangement is more<br/>
accurate than before. In one large handsome room <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>exhibited for the first time several fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stelae</span>, which<br/>
have been brought from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salsl.riirah </span>during the past year.<br/>
The brightness of the colours, the vigour of the figures, and<br/>
the beauty of the hieroglyphics upon these <span style="color: #ff0000;">fine </span>monuments<br/>
of the early dynasties, will, we believe, make them objects<br/>
of general interest and attraction. On the same floor the<br/>
visitor will also examine with wonder two splendid colossal<br/>
statues of the god Ptah which were excavated by M. de<br/>
Morgan at Memphis in 1892. In a series of rooms are<br/>
arranged the <span style="color: #0000FF;">comms </span>and mummies of the priests of Amen<br/>
which M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gr√©baut </span>brought down from Thebes in the winter<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">189a-9r</span>. The coffins are of great interest, for they <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>ornamented with mythological scenes and figures of the<br/>
gods which seem to he peculiar to the period immediately<br/>
following the rule of the priests kings of Thebes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>, from<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1ocoo-8oo</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A new and important feature in the arrangement of the<br/>
rooms on the upper floor is the section devoted to the<br/>
exhibition of papyri<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Here in flat glazed cases are shown<br/>
at full length fine copies of the Book of the Dead, hieratic<br/>
texts, including the unique copy of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Maxims of Ani,"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
