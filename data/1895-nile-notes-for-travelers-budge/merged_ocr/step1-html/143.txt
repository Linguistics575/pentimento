St. Mark is said to have preached the Gospel here.<br/>
Meanwhile the prosperity of the town declined and the<br/>
treasury became empty.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria was captured by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chosroes </span>(A.D. 619), and by<br/>
'Amr ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">er'As.i</span>, a general of'Omar, A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">641</span>. The decline<br/>
of Alexandria went on steadily, until it became in the Middle<br/>
Ages little more, comparatively, than <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>moderate sized <span style="color: #ff0000;">seaport </span>town, with a population of some thousands of people.<br/>
In the present century a little of its prosperity was restored<br/>
by Muhammad'Ali, who in 1819 built the <span style="color: #ff0000;">MabmiW1yeh<br/>
</span>canal to bring fresh water to the town from the Rosetta arm<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile. Its population to-day is about 300,000, and<br/>
includes large and wealthy colonies of Jews and Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
The Christians were persecuted at Alexandria with great<br/>
severity by Decius (A.D. 250), by Valerianus (<span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>257),<br/>
and by Diocletian (A.D. 304). For a large number of years<br/>
the city was disturbed by the fierce discussions on religious<br/>
dogmas between Arius and Athanasius, George of Cappadocia and Athanasius, the Anthropomorphists and their<br/>
opponents, and Cyril and Nestorius. The Christian sects<br/>
supported their views by violence, and the ordinary heathen<br/>
population of the town rebelled whenever they could find<br/>
a favourable opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
The most important ancient buildings of Alexandria<br/>
were <span style="color: #ff0000;">H</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--<br/>
</span>The Lighthouse or Pharos, one of the seven wonders<br/>
of the world, was built by Sostratus of Cnidus, for Ptolemy<br/>
Philadelphus, and is said to have been about <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goo </span>feet high.<br/>
All traces of this wonderful building have now disappeared.<br/>
The embankment or causeway called the HEPTASTADIUM (from its length <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofseven </span>stades), was made either by Ptolemy<br/>
Philadelphus or his father Ptolemy Soter; it divided the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadium </span>joined the ancient town and the Island <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Pharos<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>a large part of the modern town is built upon it.<br/>
