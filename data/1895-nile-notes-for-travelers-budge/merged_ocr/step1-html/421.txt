<br/>
a granite chest containing four uninscribed alabaster Canopic<br/>
jars was found, and in another similar chest a <span style="color: #0000FF;">worm-eaten<br/>
</span>wooden box, containing four Canopic jars, was also <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered</span>. The four sides of the box were inscribed, but<br/>
the jars were plain. While the ground of the galleries was<br/>
being carefully examined, a hollow in the rock was found,<br/>
and a few blows of the pick revealed <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>magnificent find ot<br/>
gold and silver <span style="color: #ff0000;">jewellerylyingin </span>aheap among the fragments<br/>
of the worm-eaten wooden box which held it. The box<br/>
was about eleven inches long, and had been inlaid with silver<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hieroghyphics </span>which formed the name of the princess<br/>
Hathor-Sat, for whom the ornaments had been made. It<br/>
would seem that special care had been taken by the friends<br/>
of the deceased to conceal her jewellery, and thus the<br/>
ancient spoilers of the tomb had overlooked it. Among<br/>
the objects found of special interest are the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">y-<br/>
</span>I. A gold pectoral, in the form of a shrine I inlaid with<br/>
<br/>
carnelian, emeralds, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">lapis- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lazuli</span>. In the centre IS<br/>

bracelets were set with pearls.<br/>
