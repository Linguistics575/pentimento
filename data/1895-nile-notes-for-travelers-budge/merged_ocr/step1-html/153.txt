<br/>
</span>The harbour and the two breakwaters which protect it are<br/>
remarkable pieces of work; the breakwater on the west is<br/>
lengthened yearly to protect the harbour from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mudcarrying </span>current which always <span style="color: #0000FF;">flows </span>from the west, and<br/>
would block up the canal but for the breakwater. Near<br/>
the western breakwater is the lighthouse, about 165 feet<br/>
high; the electric light is used in it, and can be seen for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>distance of twenty miles. The port is called Sa'id in<br/>
honour of Sa'id Pasha. The fresh water used is brought<br/>
in iron pipes <span style="color: #0000FF;">laid </span>along the western side of the canal<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'iliya</span>. The choice fell upon this spot for the<br/>
Mediterranean end of the canal because water <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently<br/>
</span>deep for ocean-going ships was found within two miles<br/>
of the shore. The total length of the canal, including<br/>
the buoyed channel at the Suez end, is about one hundred<br/>
miles. The Suez Canal Company's light railway, carrying<br/>
passengers, runs directly to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'iliya </span>at 9 A.M., to connect<br/>
with the midday train from Suez to Cairo.<br/>

Onia, the high priest of the Jews, built a temple by the<br/>
permission of Ptolemy Philometor, in which the Egyptian<br/>
Jews might worship. The site of the town was occupied in<br/>
very early times by a temple and other buildings which <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>set up by Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>and Rameses III.; a large number of<br/>
the tiles which formed parts of the walls of these splendid<br/>
