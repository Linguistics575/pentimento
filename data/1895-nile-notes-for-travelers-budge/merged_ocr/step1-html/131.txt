<span>THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT. 107<br/>
<br/>
Isis heard what had happened, she went about seeking for<br/>
the pieces, and built a temple over each one; she found all<br/>
save one. Osiris, however, had become king of the netherworld, and vengeance was taken by his son Horus upon his<br/>
brother Set. Osiris is usually represented in the form of<br/>
a mummy, holding in his hands <span style="color: #ff0000;">if'dominion</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">J</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>'life,'<br/>
A'rule,' and <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'power</span>.' He is called'the lord of<br/>
Abydos,"lord of the holy land, lord of eternity and prince<br/>
of everlasting,"the president of the gods,"the head of<br/>
the corridor of the tomb,<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>bull of the west,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>judge of the<br/>
dead,' etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
The writers of Egyptian mythological texts always assume<br/>
their readers to possess a knowledge of the history of the<br/>
murder of Osiris by Set, and of the wanderings and troubles<br/>
of his disconsolate wife Isis. The following extracts from<br/>
Plutarch's work on the subject will supply certain information not given in the Egyptian texts.<br/>
<br/>
"Osiris, being now become king of Egypt, applied himself towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilizing </span>his countrymen by turning them from<br/>
their former indigent and barbarous course<br/>
of life; he moreover taught them how to<br/>
cultivate and improve the fruits of the<br/>
earth; he gave them a body of laws to<br/>
regulate their conduct by, and instructed<br/>
them in that reverence and worship which<br/>
they were to pay to the gods; with the<br/>
same good disposition he afterwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">travelled </span>over the rest of the world, inducing<br/>
the people everywhere to submit to his<br/>
discipline; not indeed compelling them<br/>
by force of arms, but persuading them to<br/>
yield to the strength of his reasons, which<br/>
were conveyed to them in the most agreeable manner, in hymns and songs accompanied with instruments of <span style="color: #0000FF;">music</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">OSIRIS</span>,<br/>
