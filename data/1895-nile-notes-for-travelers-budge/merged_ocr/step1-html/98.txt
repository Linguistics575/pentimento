<span>74 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
aromatic drugs, and having been bandaged in many a<br/>
fold of linen, lay in its tomb, ready to take part in the<br/>
life which was inherited by those who were deemed<br/>
worthy of it.<br/>
<br/>
Of the funeral procession we are able to gain some idea<br/>
from the vignettes which are given in hieroglyphic copies<br/>
of the Book of the Dead. In the centre of p. 75 the dead<br/>
man is seen lying on a bier in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chest mounted on a boat<br/>
with runners, which is drawn by oxen. In the rear is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>ark or chest surmounted <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a figure of Anubis,<br/>
the god of the dead. In front of the boat are a group of<br/>
women (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>76) beating their faces and wailing, and a youth<br/>
carrying the staff, chair, and box of the deceased. At the<br/>
head of the procession is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">kluyr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.hel</span>) or master of funereal<br/>
ceremonies, who reads from an open roll of papyrus the<br/>
funereal service. The scene on page 76 represents the<br/>
ceremony of "opening the mouth," which takes place at the<br/>
door of the tomb. Before the tomb stands the mummy of<br/>
Hu-nefer to receive the final honours; behind him, and<br/>
embracing him, stands Anubis, the god of the dead, and at<br/>
his feet in front kneel his wife Nasha and her daughter to<br/>
take a last farewell of the body. By the side of a table<br/>
of offerings stand three priests<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sew </span>priest, who wears a<br/>
panther's skin, holding in his right hand a libation vase,<br/>
and in the left a censer; a priest who offers vases of<br/>
unguents to the deceased; and a priest who holds in one<br/>
<br/>
hand the instrument <span style="color: #0000FF;">ttr-.heka </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e1ae</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>with which he is<br/>

</span>about to touch the eyes and mouth of the mummy, and in<br/>
the other the instrument <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>for "opening the mouth.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>On the rounded stele <span style="color: #0000FF;">D</span>, at the door of the tomb, <span style="color: #ff0000;">is<br/>
