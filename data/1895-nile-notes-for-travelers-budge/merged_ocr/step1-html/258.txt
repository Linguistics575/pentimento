<span>234 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
about 150 feet long, the paws are <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>feet long, the head is<br/>
30 feet long, the face is 14 feet wide, and from the top of<br/>
the head to the base of the monument the distance is about<br/>
70 feet. Originally there probably were ornaments on the<br/>
head, the whole of which was covered with a limestone<br/>
covering, and the face was coloured red<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of these decorations<br/>
scarcely any traces now remain, though they were visible<br/>
towards the end of the last century. The condition in<br/>
which the monument now appears is due to the savage<br/>
destruction of its features by the Muhammadan rulers of<br/>
Egypt, some of whom caused it to be used for a target.<br/>
Around this imposing relic of antiquity, whose origin is<br/>
wrapped in mystery, a number of legends and superstitions<br/>
have clustered in all ages; but Egyptology has shown<br/>
I. that it was a colossal image of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ra-Harmachis</span>, and<br/>
therefore of his human representative upon earth, the king<br/>
of Egypt who had it <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn</span>, and II. that it was in existence<br/>
in the time of, and was probably repaired by, Cheops and<br/>
Chephren, who lived about three thousand seven hundred<br/>
years before Christ.<br/>
<br/>
THE TEMPLE OF THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">SPHINX</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the south-east of the Sphinx stands the large<br/>
granite and limestone temple excavated by M. Mariette<br/>
in 1853; statues of Chephren (now at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>) were found<br/>
in it, and hence it has been generally supposed that he<br/>
was the builder of it. It is a good specimen of the solid<br/>
simple buildings which the Egyptians built during the<br/>
Ancient Empire. In one chamber, and at the end of the<br/>
passage leading from it, are hewn in the wall niches which<br/>
were probably intended to hold mummies.<br/>
<br/>
THE TOMB OF NUMBERS.<br/>
<br/>
This tomb was made for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chrf-R5-rutch</span>, a "royal relative"<br/>
and priest of Chephren (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cha-f-Wi</span>), the builder of the second<br/>
<br/>
