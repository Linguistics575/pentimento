king, and from this it has been concluded that the building<br/>
formed the PALACE OF RAMESES III. Elsewhere the king<br/>
is shown smiting his enemies, and from the features and<br/>
dress of many of them it is possible to tell generally what<br/>
nations they represent; it is quite clear that the sculptor<br/>
intended his figures to be typical portraits. It is a noticeable<br/>
fact that the cartouches of Rameses III. are the only ones<br/>
found <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>this building.<br/>
<br/>
V. The Temple of Rameses III. is entered by passing through the first pylon, the front of which is ornamented<br/>
with scenes from the wars of this king against the people of<br/>
Arabia and Phoenicia. The weapons of the king are<br/>
presented to him by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra </span>the Sun-god. In the first<br/>
court is a row of seven pillars, to which are attached figures<br/>
of the king in the form of Osiris; M. Mariette was of<br/>
opinion that these declared the funereal nature of the<br/>
building. The second pylon is built of red granite, and<br/>
the front is ornamented with scenes in which Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>.<br/>
is leading before the gods Amen and Mut <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>number of<br/>
prisoners, whom he has captured in Syria and along the<br/>
coasts of the Mediterranean; from these scenes it is evident<br/>
that he was able to wage war by sea as well as by land. The<br/>
second court, which, according to M. Mariette, is one of<br/>
the most precious which Egyptian antiquity has bequeathed<br/>
to us, has a portico running round its four sides; it is<br/>
supported on the north and south sides by eight Osiris<br/>
columns, and on the east and west by five circular columns.<br/>
The Copts disgraced this splendid court by building a<br/>
sandstone colonnade in the middle, and destroyed here, as<br/>
elsewhere, much that would have been of priceless value.<br/>
Beyond the second court was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>of columns, on each<br/>
side of which were several small chambers, and beyond<br/>
that were other chambers and corridors and the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
The scenes sculptured on the inside of the second court<br/>
represent the wars of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>against the Libyans, in<br/>
