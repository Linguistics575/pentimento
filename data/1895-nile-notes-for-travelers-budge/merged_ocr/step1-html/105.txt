</span>in [ my ] judgment; may there be no opposition to me from<br/>
the divine chiefs; may there be no parting <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thee </span>from me<br/>
in the presence of him who <span style="color: #ff0000;">keepeth </span>the scales! Thou<br/>
art my ka (double) within my body which <span style="color: #ff0000;">knitteth </span>and<br/>
strengthened<span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>my limbs. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mayest </span>thou come forth to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>of happiness to which we advance. May the divine<br/>
chiefs (<span style="color: #ff0000;">S/Zeizz't</span>) not make my name to stink, and may no lies<br/>
be spoken against me in the presence of the god. It is<br/>
good for thee to hear [ glad tidings <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofjoy </span>at the weighing of<br/>
words. May no false accusation be made against me in<br/>
the presence of the great god. Verily, exceedingly mighty<br/>
shalt thou be when thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">risestj</span>."<br/>
<br/>
Thoth, the righteous judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the great cycle of the gods<br/>
who are in the presence of the god Osiris, saith, "Hear ye<br/>
this judgment. The heart of Osiris hath in very truth been<br/>
weighed and his soul hath stood as a witness for him; his<br/>
trial in the Great Balance is true. There hath not been<br/>
found any wickedness in him; he hath not wasted the<br/>
offerings in the temples; he hath not harmed any by his<br/>
works; and he uttered not evil reports while he was upon<br/>
earth."<br/>
<br/>
Next the great cycle of the gods reply to Thoth dwelling<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khemennu </span>(Hermopolis): "That which cometh forth<br/>
from thy mouth cannot be <span style="color: #ff0000;">gainsaid</span>. Osiris, the scribe<br/>
Ani, the victorious one in judgment, is just and righteous.<br/>
He hath not committed sin, neither hath he done evil<br/>
against us. The Devourer shall not be allowed to prevail<br/>
over him; he shall be allowed to enter into the presence of<br/>
the god Osiris, and offerings of meat and drink shall be<br/>
given unto him, together with an abiding habitation in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sekhet-hetepu</span>, as unto the followers of Horus."<br/>
<br/>
In the second part of this scene we have Ani being led<br/>
into the presence of the god Osiris. On the left the hawk<br/>
headed god Horus j, the son of Isis, wearing the crowns<br/>
