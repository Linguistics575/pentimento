</span>Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harabat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Madftmah</span>, on the west bank of the Nile,<br/>
was one of the most renowned cities of ancient Egypt; it<br/>
was famous as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>seat of the worship of Osiris in<br/>
Upper Egypt, because the head of this god was supposed to<br/>
be buried here. The town itself was dedicated to Osiris,<br/>
and the temple in it, wherein the most solemn ceremonies<br/>
connected with the worship of this god were celebrated, was<br/>
more revered than any other in the land. The town and<br/>
its necropolis were built side by side, and the custom<br/>
usually followed by the Egyptians in burying their dead<br/>
away from the town in the mountains was not followed<br/>
in this case<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Though the hills of fine white stone were<br/>
there ready, the people of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span>did not make use of<br/>
them for funereal purposes<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the sandy plain interspersed<br/>
every here and there with rocks was the place chosen for<br/>
burial. The town of Abydos, a small town even in its best<br/>
time, was built upon a narrow tongue of land situated<br/>
between the canal, which lies inland some few miles, and<br/>
the desert<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It owed its importance solely to the position it<br/>
held as a religious centre, and from this point of view it was<br/>
the second city in Egypt. Thebes, Abydos, and Heliopolis<br/>
practically represented the homes of religious thought and<br/>
learning in Egypt. The necropolis of Abydos is not much<br/>
older than the VIth dynasty, and the tombs found there<br/>
