</span>The Catacombs, which were built early in the fourth<br/>
century of our era, are on the coast near the harbour and<br/>

<br/>
The Walls of the city were built by Muhammad'Ali,<br/>
and appear to have been laid upon the foundation <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofancient<br/>
</span>walls.<br/>
<br/>
On the south side of Alexandria lies Lake Mareotis,<br/>
which in ancient days was fed by canals running from the<br/>
Nile. During the middle ages the lake nearly dried up, and<br/>
the land which became available for building purposes in<br/>
consequence was speedily covered with villages. In the<br/>
year 1801, the English dug a canal across the neck of land<br/>
between the lake and the sea, and flooded the whole district<br/>
thus occupied. During the last few years an attempt has<br/>
been made to pump the water out<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it would seem with considerable success.<br/>
<br/>
