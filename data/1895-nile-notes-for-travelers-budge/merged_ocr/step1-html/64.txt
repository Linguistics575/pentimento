<span>40 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
made some concessions to the Monophysite party. Shortly<br/>
after, however, new dissensions arose which so weakened<br/>
the orthodox church that the Monophysite party hailed with<br/>
gladness the arrival of the arms of Muhammad the Prophet,<br/>
and joined its forces with his that they might destroy the<br/>
power of their theological opponents. After'Amr had<br/>
made himself master of Egypt (<span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>640), he appointed<br/>
the Copts to positions of dignity and wealth<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>finding, however, that they were unworthy of his confidence, they were<br/>
degraded, and finally persecuted with vigour. From the time<br/>
of Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria, A.D. 1235 and onwards,<br/>
but little is known of the history of the Coptic Church. The<br/>
Copt of to-day usually troubles himself little about <span style="color: #0000FF;">theological<br/>
</span>matters; in certain cases, however, he affirms with considerable firmness the doctrine of the "one nature."<br/>
<br/>
The knowledge of the Coptic language is, generally speaking, extinct; it is exceedingly doubtful if three Coptic<br/>
scholars, in the Western sense of the word, exist even among<br/>
the priests. The language spoken by them is Arabic, and<br/>
though copies of parts of the Bible are found in churches<br/>
and private houses, they are usually accompanied by an<br/>
Arabic version of the Coptic text, which is more usually<br/>
read than the Coptic<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Bible, in all or part, was translated from Greek into Coptic in the third century of our<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">era</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>some, however, think that the translation was not<br/>
made until the eighth century. The versions of the principal books of the Old and the whole of the New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Testament</span>,<br/>
together with lives of saints, monks and martyrs, form the<br/>
greater part of Coptic literature. The Coptic language is,<br/>
at base, a dialect of ancient Egyptian<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>many of the nouns<br/>
and verbs found in the hieroglyphic texts remain unchanged<br/>
in Coptic, and a large number of others can, by making proper<br/>
allowance for phonetic decay and dialectic differences, be<br/>
identified without difficulty. The Copts used the Greek<br/>
alphabet to write down their language, but found it neces<br/>
