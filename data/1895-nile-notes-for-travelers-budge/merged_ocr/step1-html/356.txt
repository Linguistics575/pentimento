<br/>
Aswan (or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uswin</span>), the southern limit of Egypt proper,<br/>
583 miles from Cairo, on the east bank of the river, called<br/>
in Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Coptic <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n</span>, was called by the<br/>
Greeks Syene, which stood on the slope of a hill to the<br/>
south-west of the present town. Properly speaking <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene<br/>
</span>was the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the earliest Egyptian<br/>
<br/>
inscriptions it is <span style="color: #ff0000;">casiij3yfsori_jygcsi'iy2<br/>
<br/>
</span>Abu, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e.</span>, "the district of the elephant," and it formed the<br/>
metropolis <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>first <span style="color: #0000FF;">nome </span>of Upper Egypt. As we approach<br/>
the time of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, the name Sunnu, i.e., the town<br/>
on the east bank of the Nile, from whence comes the Arabic<br/>
name Aswan, takes the place of Abu. The town obtained<br/>
great notoriety among the ancients from the fact that<br/>
Eratosthenes and Ptolemy considered it to lie on the tropic<br/>
of Cancer, and to be the most northerly point where, at the<br/>
time of the summer solstice, the sun's rays fell vertically;<br/>
as a matter of fact, however, the town lies <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>' 37' 23" north of<br/>
the tropic of Cancer. There was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>famous well there, into<br/>
which the sun was said to shine at the summer solstice, and<br/>
to illuminate it in every part. In the time of the Romans<br/>
three cohorts were stationed here," and the town was of<br/>
considerable importance. In the twelfth century of our<br/>
era it was the seat of a bishop. Of its size in ancient days<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>It is interesting to observe that the Romans, like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">British</span>, held<br/>
Egypt by garrisoning <span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">places</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babylon </span>(Cairo), and<br/>
Alexandria. The garrison at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aswitn </span>defended <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">from </span>foes on the<br/>
south, and commanded the entrance of the Nile; the garrison at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Babylon </span>guarded the end of the Nile valley and the entrance to the<br/>
Delta; and the garrison at Alexandria protected the country from<br/>
invasion <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>sea<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
