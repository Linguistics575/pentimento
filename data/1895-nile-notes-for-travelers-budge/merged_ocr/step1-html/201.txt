160. Red granite Stele of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Piiinkhi</span>, King of Ethiopia,<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 750. The text gives a detailed account of<br/>
the expedition of this king into Egypt and of his conquest of that country. It was reported to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Piiinkhi </span>in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">21st </span>year of his reign, that the governors of the northern<br/>
towns had made a league together and had revolted<br/>
against his authority. He set out for Egypt with his<br/>
soldiers, and when he arrived at Thebes he made offerings<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span>, and commanded his soldiers to pay proper<br/>
homage to the god. Passing northwards from <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hebes</span>,<br/>
he captured city after city, and finally besieged Memphis,<br/>
which he soon captured, and thus made himself master<br/>
of Egypt. The details of the capture of the towns, the<br/>
speeches of the king and of his vassal princes, and the<br/>
general information contained in the narrative, give this<br/>
inscription an importance possessed by few others.<br/>
