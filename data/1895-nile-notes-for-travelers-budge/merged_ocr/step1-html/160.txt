</span>CAIRO.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo (from the Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kahira</span>,'the Victorious,' because<br/>
the planet <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kahir </span>or Mars was visible on the night of the<br/>
foundation of the city) is situated on the right or eastern<br/>
bank of the Nile, about ten miles south of the division of<br/>
the Nile into the Rosetta and Damietta branches. It is<br/>
called in Arabic May'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>it is the largest city in Africa, and<br/>
its population must be now about half a million souls.<br/>
Josephus says that the fortress of the Babylon of Egypt,<br/>
which stood on the spot occupied by old Cairo or <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ostat</span>,<br/>
was founded by the Babylonian mercenary soldiers of<br/>
Cambyses, B.C. 525<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Diodorus </span>says that it was founded<br/>
by Assyrian captives in the time of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, and<br/>
Ctesias is inclined to think that it was built in the time<br/>
of Semiramis. The opinions of the two last mentioned<br/>
writers are valuable in one respect, for they show that it<br/>
was believed in their time that Babylon of Egypt was<br/>
of very ancient foundation. During the reign of Augustus<br/>
it was the headquarters of one of the legions that garrisoned<br/>
Egypt, and remains of the town and fortress which these<br/>
legionaries occupied are still to be seen a little to the<br/>
north of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat</span>. The word <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fosthtt </span>means a'tent,' and<br/>
the place is so called from the tent of'Amr ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">er-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.si</span>,<br/>
which was pitched there when he invaded Egypt, A.D. <span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">38</span>,<br/>
and to which he returned after his capture of Alexandria.<br/>
Around his tent lived a large number of his followers, and<br/>
