</span>months.' The SSMA formed a part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesareum</span>, and<br/>
contained the bodies of Alexander the Great and the<br/>
Ptolemies, his successors. The Theatre, which faced the<br/>
island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antirhodus</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stoma</span>, and the Museum and<br/>
Library, all stood in the royal buildings in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bruchium<br/>
</span>quarter of the town, between Lochias and the Heptastadium.<br/>
The stone sarcophagus (now in the British Museum, No. ro),<br/>
which was thought to have belonged to Alexander the Great,<br/>
was made for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neetanebus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the first king of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXth<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>"The spirit of Amrou ('Amr <span style="color: #0000FF;">ihn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'AED </span>was more curious and<br/>
liberal than that of his brethren, and in his leisure hours the Arabian<br/>
chief was pleased with the conversation of John, the last disciple of<br/>
Ammonius, and who derived the surname of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philopottus </span>from his<br/>
laborious studies of grammar and philosophy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Emboldened </span>by this<br/>
familiar intercourse, Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, <span style="color: #0000FF;">inestimable<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>opinion, <span style="color: #0000FF;">contemptible </span>in that of the Barbarians: the royal<br/>
library, which alone, among the spoils of Alexandria, had not been<br/>
appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror. Amrou was<br/>
inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his rigid integrity<br/>
refused to alienate the <span style="color: #ff0000;">minutest </span>object without the consent of the<br/>
caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was inspired by the<br/>
ignorance of a fanatic<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'If </span>these writings of the Greeks agree with<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">book </span>of God, they are useless and need not be preserved: if they<br/>
disagree, they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed.' The sentence<br/>
was executed with blind obedience: the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the 4,000 baths of the city; and such was<br/>
their incredible multitude that six months were barely sufficient for the<br/>
consumption of this precious fuel." (Gibbon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Decline </span>and Fall,<br/>
chap. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1i</span>.) The chief authority for this statement is <span style="color: #0000FF;">BarHebraeus<br/>
</span>(born A.D. 1226, died at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maraghah </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">hdhtorbaijan</span>, July 30th, 1286),<br/>
and it has been repeated by several Arabic writers. Both Gibbon and<br/>
Renaudot thought the story incredible, but there is no reason why it<br/>
should be. Gibbon appears to have thought that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexan..<br/>
</span>drian library was pillaged or destroyed when Theophilus, Patriarch of<br/>
Alexandria, destroyed the image of Serapis; there is, however, no<br/>
proof that it was, and it seems more probable that it remained <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unhurt </span>until the arrival of'Amr ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">ei-'As.i</span>. See the<br/>
