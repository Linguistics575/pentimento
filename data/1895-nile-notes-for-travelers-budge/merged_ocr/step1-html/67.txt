<span>THE MODERN <span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPTIANS</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>43<br/>
<br/>
The Negroes form a large part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-native<br/>
</span>population of Egypt, and are employed by natives to<br/>
perform hard work, or are held by them as slaves<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They<br/>
are Muhammadans by religion, and come from the countries<br/>
known by the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sthhin</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Negro </span>women make good<br/>
and faithful servants.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Syrian Christians who have settled down in Egypt<br/>
are generally known by the name of Levantines. They<br/>
are shrewd business men, and the facility and rapidity with<br/>
which they learn European languages place them in<br/>
positions of trust and emolument.<br/>
<br/>
The Turks form a comparatively small portion of the<br/>
population of Egypt, but many civil and military appointments are, or were, in their hands. Many of them are the<br/>
children of Circassian slaves. The merchants are famous<br/>
for their civility to foreigners and their keen eye to<br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
The Armenians and Jews form a small but important<br/>
part of the inhabitants in the large towns of Egypt. The<br/>
former are famous for their linguistic attainments and<br/>
wealth; the latter have blue eyes, fair hair and skin, and<br/>
busy themselves in mercantile pursuits and the business of<br/>
bankers and money-changing.<br/>
<br/>
The European population in Egypt consists of Greeks<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">65,000</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Italians </span>30,000, French 14,000, English 9,000,<br/>
Germans, Austrians, Russians, etc., <span style="color: #0000FF;">cta</span>, about 10,000. The<br/>
greater part of the business of Alexandria is in the hands of<br/>
the Greek merchants, many of whom are famous for their<br/>
wealth. It is said that the Greek community contributes most<br/>
largely to the crime in the country, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>size of that community be taken into account, it will be found that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">statement </span>is not strictly true. The enterprise and good business<br/>
habits of the Greeks in Alexandria have made it the great<br/>
city that it is. The French, Austrian, German, and English<br/>
nations are likewise represented there, and in Cairo, by<br/>
