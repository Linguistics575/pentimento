THE MODERN EGYPTIANS.<br/>
<br/>
The total population of Egypt proper may be fixed<br/>
roughly at 8,000,000, of whom about 130,000 are foreigners.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Francis Grenfell, G.C.B., is of opinion that the population of Egypt is now nearer <span style="color: #0000FF;">nine </span>than eight millions. In<br/>
a country where an increase in population always means an<br/>
increase in taxation, it is quite impossible to obtain an<br/>
accurate census. As far back as the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Davide </span>the<br/>
idea of "numbering the people" has been unpopular in the<br/>
East.<br/>
<br/>
It is exceedingly <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to obtain an exact idea of what<br/>
the population of Egypt actually was in Pharaonic times, for<br/>
the inscriptions tell us nothing. Herodotus gives us no<br/>
information on this matter, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>tells us that it<br/>
amounted to <span style="color: #0000FF;">7,000,000 </span>in ancient times. The priests<br/>
at Thebes informed Germanicus, A.D. 19, that in the times<br/>
of Rameses II. the country contained <span style="color: #0000FF;">700,000+ </span>fighting<br/>
men; it will also be remembered that the Bible states that<br/>
the "children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,<br/>
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside<br/>
children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them."<br/>
Exodus xii. 37, 38. In the time of Vespasian 7,500,000<br/>
persons paid poll-tax<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>we may assume that about 500,000<br/>
were exempt, and therefore there must have been at least<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">8,000,000 </span>of people in Egypt, without reckoning slaves.<br/>
(Mommsen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Provinces </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rome</span>, Vol. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, p. 258.) It is<br/>
probable, however, that the population of Egypt under the<br/>
