"One in his times, as among the gods. Beautiful bull of<br/>
the cycle of the gods, president of all the gods, lord of Law,<br/>
father of the gods, maker of men, creator of beasts, lord<br/>
of things which exist, creator of the staff of life, maker of<br/>
the green food which makes cattle to live. Form made by<br/>
Ptah, beautiful child, beloved one. The gods make<br/>

through the sky in peace. King of the South and <span style="color: #0000FF;">North</span>,<br/>
the SUN (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>), whose word is law, prince of the world!<br/>
The mighty of valour, the lord of terror, the chief who<br/>
makes the earth like unto himself. How very many more<br/>
are his forms than those of any (other) god! The gods<br/>
rejoice in his beauties, and they make praises to him in the<br/>
two great horizons, at (his) risings in the double horizon <span style="color: #0000FF;">01<br/>

when they recognize their lord in his majesty, the lord of<br/>
fear, the mighty one of victory, the mighty of Will, the<br/>
master of diadems, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">verdifier </span>of offerings (P), the maker of<br/>

"Adorations to thee, O thou maker of the gods, who hast<br/>
stretched out the heavens and founded the earth! The<br/>
untiring watcher, Amsu-Amen, lord of eternity, maker of<br/>
everlasting, to whom adorations are made (literally, lord of<br/>
adorations), at the head of the Apts, established with two<br/>
horns, beautiful of aspects<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the lord of the uraeus crown,<br/>
