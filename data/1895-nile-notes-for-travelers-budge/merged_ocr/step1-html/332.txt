<span>303 NOTES FOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELLERS </span>IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
objects proved that the natives of Thebes had succeeded in<br/>
unearthing a veritable "Cave of Treasures," and <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maspero</span>,<br/>
the Director of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">B131le </span>Museum, straightway determined<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>visit Upper Egypt with a view of discovering whence<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">came </span>all these antiquities. Three men were implicated<br/>
whose names were learnt by M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero </span>from the inquiries<br/>
which he made of tourists who purchased antiquities.<br/>
<br/>
In 1881 he proceeded <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>, and began his <span style="color: #ff0000;">investiga</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tions </span>by causing one of the dealers,'Abd <span style="color: #ff0000;">er-RasN </span>Ahmad,<br/>
to be arrested by the police, and an official inquiry into the<br/>
matter was ordered by the Mudir of Keneh. In spite of<br/>
threats and persuasion, and many add tortures, the accused<br/>
denied any knowledge of the place whence the antiquities<br/>
came. The evidence of the witnesses who were called to<br/>
testify to the character of the accused, tended to show that<br/>
he was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man of amiable disposition, who would never<br/>
dream of pillaging a tomb, much less do it. Finally, after<br/>
two months' imprisonment, he was provisionally set at<br/>
liberty. The accused then began to discuss with his partners<br/>
in the secret what plans they <span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">adopt</span>, and how they<br/>
should act in the future. Some of them thought that all<br/>
trouble was over when'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Rascal </span>Ahmad was set at<br/>
liberty, but others thought, and they were right, that the<br/>
trial <span style="color: #ff0000;">wouldbe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">recom1penced </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>winter. Fortunately for<br/>
students of Egyptology, differences of opinion broke out<br/>
between the parties soon after, and'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Rascal </span>Ahmad<br/>
soon perceived that his brothers were determined to turn<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">King</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>evidence at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>favourable opportunity. To prevent<br/>
their saving themselves at his expense, he quietly travelled<br/>
to Keneh, and there confessed to the Mudir that he was<br/>
able to reveal the place where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>and papyri were<br/>
found<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Telegrams were sent to Cairo announcing the<br/>
confession of'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">cr-Rasid </span>Ahmad, and when his statements had been verified, despatches containing fuller<br/>
particulars were sent to Cairo from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh</span>. It was decided<br/>
