IVth, and VIth dynasties, the kings of which sprang from<br/>
Memphis, that city reached a height of splendour which<br/>
was probably never excelled. The most celebrated building<br/>
there was the temple of Ptah, which was beautified and<br/>
adorned by a number of kings, the last of whom reigned<br/>
during the XXVIth dynasty. The Hyksos ravaged, but did<br/>
not destroy, the city; under the rule of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>kings,<br/>
who expelled the Hyksos, the city <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span>for a time,<br/>
although <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hebes </span>became the new capital. When Rameses II.<br/>
returned from his wars in the east, he set up a statue of<br/>
himself in front of the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptah </span>there; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Piiinchi </span>the<br/>
Ethiopian besieged it<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and<br/>
Assurbanipal captured it; Cambyses the Persian, having<br/>
wrought great damage there, killed the magistrates of the<br/>
city and the priests of the temple of Apis, and smote the<br/>
Apis bull so that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">died </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3* </span>he established a Persian garrison<br/>
there. After the founding of Alexandria, Memphis lost<br/>

* "When Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis, whom the Greeks call<br/>
Epaphus, appeared to the Egyptians; and when this manifestation<br/>
took place, the Egyptians immediately put on their richest apparel, and<br/>
kept festive holiday. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses </span>seeing them thus occupied, and concluding that they made their <span style="color: #0000FF;">rejoicings </span>on account of his ill success,<br/>
summoned the magistrates to Memphis; and when they came into his<br/>
presence, he asked,' why the Egyptians had done nothing of the kind<br/>
when he was at Memphis before, but did so now, when he had returned<br/>
with the loss of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great part of his army.' They answered, that their<br/>
god appeared to them, who was accustomed to manifest himself at<br/>
distant intervals, and that when he did appear, then all the Egyptians<br/>
were used to rejoice and keep a feast. Cambyses, having heard this,<br/>
said they lied, and as liars he put them to death. Having slain them,<br/>
he next summoned the priests into his presence; and when the priests<br/>
gave the same account, he said, that he would find out whether a god<br/>
so tractable had come among the Egyptians; and having said this, he<br/>
commanded the priests to bring Apis to him; they therefore went away<br/>
to fetch him. This Apis, or Epaphus, is the calf <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>cow incapable of<br/>
conceiving another offspring; and the Egyptians say, that lightning<br/>
descends upon the cow from heaven, and that from thence it brings<br/>
