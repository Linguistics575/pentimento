</span>after death had already become a part of the life of the<br/>
people of Egypt. During the reign of King Sent the<br/>
redaction of a medical papyrus was carried out. As this<br/>
work presupposes many years of experiment and experience,<br/>
it is clear that the Egyptians possessed ample anatomical<br/>
knowledge for mummifying a human body. Again, if we<br/>
consider that the existence of this king is proved by papyri<br/>
and contemporaneous monuments, and that we know the<br/>
names of some of the priests who took part in funereal<br/>
ceremonies during his reign, there is no <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffoculty </span>in<br/>
acknowledging the great antiquity of such ceremonies, and<br/>
that they presuppose a religious belief in the actual<br/>
revivification of the body, for which hoped-for event the<br/>
Egyptian took the greatest possible care to hide and<br/>
preserve his body.<br/>
<br/>
"Mummy" is the term which is generally applied to<br/>
the body of a human being or animal which has been<br/>
preserved from decay by means of bitumen, spices, gums,<br/>
and natron. As far as can be discovered, the word is<br/>
neither <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>corruption of the ancient Egyptian word for a<br/>
preserved body, nor of the more modern Coptic form of<br/>
the hieroglyphic name. The word "<span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>is found in<br/>
Byzantine Greek and in Latin, and indeed in almost all<br/>
European languages. It is derived from the Arabic<br/>

<br/>
We obtain our knowledge of the way in which the<br/>
ancient Egyptians mummified their dead from Greek<br/>
historians, and from an examination of mummies. According to Herodotus (ii. 86) the art of mummifying was<br/>
carried on by a special guild of men who received their<br/>
appointment by law. These men mummified bodies in<br/>
