<span style="color: #ff0000;">SUEZ </span>AND THE SUEZ CANAL.<br/>
<br/>
The town of Suez practically sprang into existence during<br/>
the building of the Suez Canal, which was opened in 1869;<br/>
before that time it was an insignificant village with a<br/>
few hundred inhabitants. Ancient history is almost silent<br/>
about it, even if it be identified with Clysma" Praesidium.<br/>
It is situated at the north end of the Gulf of Suez, and<br/>
is now important from its position at the south end of<br/>
the Suez Canal. A fresh-water canal from Cairo to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez<br/>
</span>was built in 1863, but before the cutting of this canal<br/>
the inhabitants obtained their water either from the<br/>
Wells of Moses (about eight miles from Suez) or Cairo.<br/>
It was at one time considered to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">near </span>the spot where<br/>
the Israelites crossed the'Sea of Sedge'; there is little<br/>
doubt, however, that the passage was made much nearer the<br/>
Mediterranean.<br/>
<br/>
The neck of land which joins Asia to Africa, or the<br/>
Isthmus of Suez, is nearly one hundred miles wide<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>on the<br/>
south side is the Gulf of Suez, on the north the Mediterranean. The Red Sea and the Mediterranean appear<br/>
to have been united in ancient days. Modern investigations have proved that so far back as the time of<br/>
Rameses II. or earlier a canal was cut between Pelusium<br/>
and Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timsah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and it is almost certain that it was well<br/>
fortified. The Asiatics who wished to invade Egypt were<br/>
compelled to cross the Isthmus of Suez, and a canal would<br/>
not only serve as a water barrier against them, but be useful<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Clysma, in Arabic Kulzum, is said by the Arab geographers to<br/>
have been situated on the coast of the sea of Yemen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the Egyptian<br/>
side, at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span>end, three days from Cairo and four days from Pelusium<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
