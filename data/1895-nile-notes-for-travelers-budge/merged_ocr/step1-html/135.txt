<span>THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill<br/>
<br/>
</span>therefore, it is to be imputed that there are so many different<br/>
sepulchres of Osiris shewn in Egypt; for we are told that<br/>
wherever Isis met with any of the scattered limbs of her<br/>
husband, she there buried it. There are others, however, who contradict this relation, and tell us that this<br/>
variety of sepulchres was owing rather to the policy of the<br/>
queen, who, instead of the real body, as was pretended,<br/>
presented these several cities with the image only of her<br/>
husband; and that she did this not only to render the<br/>
honours which would by this means be paid to his memory<br/>
more extensive, but likewise that she might hereby elude<br/>
the malicious search of Typhon; who, if he got the better<br/>
of Horus in the war wherein they were going to be engaged,<br/>
distracted by this multiplicity of sepulchres, might despair<br/>
of being able to find the true one.......<br/>
<br/>
"After these things Osiris, returning from the other<br/>
world, appeared to his son Horus, encouraged him to the<br/>
battle, and at the same time instructed him in the exercise<br/>
of arms. He then asked him,'what he thought the most<br/>
glorious action a man could perform?' to which Horus<br/>
replied,'to revenge the injuries offered to his father and<br/>
mother.' This reply much rejoiced Osiris....... We<br/>
are moreover told that amongst the great numbers who<br/>
were continually deserting from Typhon's party was the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thoueris</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thata </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">serpent </span>pursuing her as she was<br/>
coming over to Horus, was slain by his soldiers. Afterwards<br/>
it came to a battle between them, which lasted many days<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>but victory at length inclined to Horus, Typhon himself<br/>
being taken prisoner. Isis, however, to whose custody he<br/>
was committed, was so far from putting him to death, that<br/>
she even loosed his bonds and set him at liberty. This<br/>
action of his mother so extremely incensed Horus, that he<br/>
laid hands upon her and pulled off the ensign of royalty<br/>
which she wore on her head<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and instead thereof Hermes<br/>
clapt on an helmet made in the shape of an ox's head.<br/>
