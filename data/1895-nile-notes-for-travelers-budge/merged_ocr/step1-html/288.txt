<span>264 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
described it as a town of considerable size, beauty, and<br/>
importance, and before the abandonment of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stdin </span>by<br/>
the Khedive, all caravans from that region stopped there.<br/>
In the hills to the west of the town are a number of ancient<br/>
Egyptian tombs, which date back as far as the XIIIth<br/>
dynasty. A large number have been destroyed during the<br/>
present century for the sake of the limestone which forms<br/>
the walls. When M. Denon stayed here he said that the<br/>
number of hieroglyphic inscriptions which cover the tombs<br/>
was so great that many months would be required to read,<br/>
and many years to copy them. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">disfigurement </span>of the<br/>
tombs dates from the time when the Christians took up<br/>
their abode in them.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen miles farther south is the Coptic town of Abu<br/>
Tig, the name of which appears to be derived from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">AHOGHKH</span>, a "granary;" and 14<span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>miles beyond, 279 miles<br/>
from Cairo, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kim </span>el-Kebir (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W.13O</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span>of the Copts), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>marks the site of Antaeopolis, the capital of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antaeopolite<br/>
</span>nome in Upper Egypt. The temple which formerly existed<br/>
here was dedicated to Antaeus, the Libyan wrestler, who<br/>
fought with Hercules. In the plain close by it was thought<br/>
that the battle between Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis,<br/>
and Set or Typhon, the murderer of Osiris, took place;<br/>
Typhon was overcome, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fled </span>away in the form of a<br/>
crocodile<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In Christian times Antaeopolis was the seat of<br/>
a bishop.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahtah</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">291</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>miles from Cairo, contains some <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>mosques, and is the home of a large number of Copts,<br/>
in consequence of which, probably, the town is kept clean.<br/>
