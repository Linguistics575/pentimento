of the well are lines, which indicate the complete rise of<br/>
the river, and other degrees of its rising. Those who<br/>
examine these marks communicate the result to the public<br/>
for their information. <span style="color: #0000FF;">For </span>it is known long before, by these<br/>
marks, and by the time elapsed from the commencement,<br/>
what the future rise of the river will be, and notice is given<br/>
of it. This information is of service to the husbandmen<br/>
with reference to the distribution of the water<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for the pur<br/>
pose also of attending to the embankments, canals, and<br/>
other things of this kind. It is of use also to the governors,<br/>
who fix the revenue; for the greater the rise of the river,<br/>
the greater it is expected will be the revenue." According<br/>
to Plutarch the Nile rose at Elephantine to the height of<br/>
28 cubits<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>a very interesting text at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edft </span>states that if<br/>
the river rises 24 cubits <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>hands at Elephantine, it will<br/>
water the country satisfactorily.<br/>
<br/>
To the south-west of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Atrfin </span>island, in a sandy valley, lie<br/>
the ruins of an ancient building of the sixth or seventh<br/>
century of our era, half convent, half fortress. A dome,<br/>
ornamented with coloured representations of Saints Michael,<br/>
George, and Gabriel, and the twelve Apostles, still remains in<br/>
a good state of preservation. To the east of the convent is<br/>
the cemetery, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>interesting stelae and linen fragments were found.<br/>
<br/>
A mile or so to the north of the convent stands the bold<br/>
hill in the sides of which are hewn the tombs which General<br/>
Sir F. <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>Grenfell, G.C.B., excavated<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>this hill is situated in<br/>
Western <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">COTAH </span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">HELLER</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts</span>,<br/>
and is the Contra Syene of the classical authors. The tombs<br/>
are hewn out of the rock, tier above tier, and the most important of these were reached by a stone staircase, which to<br/>
this day remains nearly complete, and is one of the most<br/>
interesting antiquities in Egypt. The tombs in this hill may<br/>
be roughly divided into three groups. The first group was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>in the best and <span style="color: #ff0000;">thickest </span>layer of stone in the top of<br/>
