395. Arcadius, Emperor of the East. The Anthropomorphites<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>who <span style="color: #0000FF;">affirmed </span>that God was of human form,<br/>
destroyed the greater number of their opponents.<br/>
<br/>
408. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theodosius </span>II. In his reign the doctrines of Nestorius were condemned by Cyril of Alexandria.<br/>
Nestorius, from the two natures of Christ, inferred<br/>
also two persons, a human and a divine. <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>In the<br/>
Syrian school, Nestorius had been taught (A.D.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">429-4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">31</span>) to abhor the confusion of the two natures,<br/>
and nicely to discriminate the humanity of his<br/>
master Christ from the Divinity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lord </span>Jesus.<br/>
The Blessed Virgin he revered as the mother of<br/>
Christ, but his ears were offended with the rash<br/>
and recent title of mother of God, which had been<br/>
insensibly adopted since the origin of the Arian<br/>
controversy. From the pulpit of Constantinople,<br/>
a friend of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriarch</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>and afterwards the<br/>
patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the<br/>
use, or the abuse, of a word unknown to the<br/>
apostles, unauthorized by the church, and which<br/>
could only tend to alarm the timorous, to mislead<br/>
the simple, to amuse the profane, and to justify,<br/>
by a seeming resemblance, the old genealogy of<br/>
Olympus. In his calmer moments <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nestorius </span>confessed, that it might be tolerated or excused by the<br/>
union of the two natures, and the communication<br/>
of their idioms (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e.</span>, a transfer of properties of each<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span>The leader of this persecution was Theophilus, Bishop of Alex.<br/>
andria, who, before he discovered that the majority of the Egyptian<br/>
monks were Anthropomorphites, was himself opposed to this body.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">f </span>Anastasius of Antioch, who said, "Let no one call Mary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theotokos</span>;<br/>
for Mary was but a woman; and it is impossible that God should be<br/>
born of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">woruam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-locrates</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eccles</span>. Hist., Bk. <span style="color: #0000FF;">VIL</span>, chap. xxxii.<br/>
