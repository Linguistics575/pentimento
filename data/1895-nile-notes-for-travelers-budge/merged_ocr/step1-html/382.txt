<span>358 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
laid down by the English a few years ago to carry troops and<br/>
stores above the Second Cataract, and until quite recently<br/>
about eighteen miles of it, passing through wild scenery,<br/>
remained in situ. The other part of it had been torn up by<br/>
the dervishes, who threw the iron rails into the cataract,<br/>
used the sleepers to boil their kettles, and twisted lengths of<br/>
the telegraph wires together to form spears. This line has<br/>
again been restored by the Egyptian army.<br/>
<br/>
The remains of Egyptian temples, etc., at Semneh above<br/>
the second cataract are of interest, but it is probable that<br/>
they would not repay the traveller who was not specially<br/>
concerned with archaeology for the fatigue of the journey<br/>
and the expense which he must necessarily incur to reach<br/>
them.<br/>
