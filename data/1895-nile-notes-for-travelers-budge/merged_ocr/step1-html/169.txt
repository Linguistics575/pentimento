the church <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Hagia Sophia at Constantinople served<br/>
as the model, but the building is not considered of remarkable beauty. The mosque is a square covered by a large<br/>
dome and four small ones. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">south-east </span>corner is<br/>
the tomb of Muhammad'Ali, and close by is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mimbar<br/>
