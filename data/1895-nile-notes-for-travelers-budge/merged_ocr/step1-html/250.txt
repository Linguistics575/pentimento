to offer sacrifice, and afterwards he ordered all the Egyptians<br/>
to work for himself; some, accordingly, were appointed to<br/>
draw stones from the quarries in the Arabian mountain<br/>
down to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, others he ordered to receive the stones<br/>
when transported in vessels across the river, and to drag<br/>
