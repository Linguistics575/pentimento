<span>342 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
were allowed to live there unmolested<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>An oath sworn by<br/>
Osiris of Phila<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>was inviolable, and the worship <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>god<br/>
flourished here until A.D. 453, that is to say, seventy years<br/>
after the proclamation of the famous edict of Theodosius<br/>
against the religion of Egypt. In the time of the Romans<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>strong garrison was stationed here. In Coptic times a<br/>
Christian church, remains of which are still visible, was built<br/>
on the northern end of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philm</span>. The picturesque scenery at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is too well known to need comment.<br/>
