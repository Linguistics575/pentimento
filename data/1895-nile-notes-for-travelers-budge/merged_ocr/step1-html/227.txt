the greater number found measure from half <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>inch to two<br/>
inches, and are made of steatite glazed green, or blue, or<br/>
brown<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>granite, basalt, jasper, amethyst, lapis-lazuli, <span style="color: #0000FF;">carnelian</span>, and glass. The flat base of the scarab was used<br/>
by the Egyptians for engraving with names of gods, kings,<br/>
priests, officials, private persons, monograms and devices.<br/>
Scarabs were set in rings and worn on the fingers by the<br/>
dead or living, or were wrapped up in the linen bandages<br/>
with which the mummy was swathed, and placed over the<br/>
heart. The best class of funereal scarabs were made of a<br/>
fine, hard, green basalt, which, when the instructions of the<br/>
rubric concerning them in the Book of the Dead were<br/>
carried out, were set in a gold border, and hung from the<br/>
neck by a fine gold wire. Such scarabs are sometimes<br/>
joined to a heart on which is inscribed, "life, stability, and<br/>
<br/>
protection<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">%</span>,' <span style="color: #0000FF;">Funereal </span>scarabs were also set in<br/>
<br/>
pectorals, and were in this case ornamented with figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the deceased adoring Osiris. Scarabs of all kinds were<br/>
kept in stock by the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">undertaker</span>, and spaces were<br/>
left blank in the inscriptions' to add the names of the<br/>
persons for whom they were bought. Scarabs worn for<br/>
ornament exist in many thousands. By an easy transition,<br/>
the custom of placing scarabs on the bodies of the dead<br/>
passed to the living, and men and women wore the scarab<br/>
probably as a silent act of homage to the creator of the<br/>
world, who was not only the god of the dead, but of the<br/>
living also. Historical scarabs appear to be limited to<br/>
a series of four, which were made during the reign of<br/>
Amenophis III. to commemorate certain historical events,<br/>
