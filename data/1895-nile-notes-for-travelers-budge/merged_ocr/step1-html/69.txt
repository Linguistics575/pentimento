THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
The river Nile is one of the longest rivers in the world;<br/>
<br/>
its Egyptian name was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haiphi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1C2tt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>and the Arabs<br/>
. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MMM<br/>
<br/>
</span>call it <span style="color: #0000FF;">bahr</span>, or'sea.' It is formed by the junction, at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">15Â° </span>34' N. lat., and <span style="color: #0000FF;">300 </span>30' 58" <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">long</span>, of two great<br/>
arms, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ball</span>" <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Away</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Let</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'turbid</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>or Blue Nile,<br/>
from the S.E., and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Abyad.</span>, i.e., the'clear,' or<br/>
White Nile, from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>The eastern branch rises in<br/>
Goyam, in Abyssinia, at an elevation of about 10,000 feet<br/>
above the level of the sea. Flowing through the lake of<br/>
Dembea it passes round the eastern frontier of Goyam, till,<br/>
when nearing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">10th </span>degree N. lat., it takes a northwest direction, which it preserves until it reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttun</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>here it unites with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Abyad</span>, the other great arm,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">flows </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span>. The Bahr <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Abyad</span>, or White<br/>
Nile, is so called because of the fine whitish clay which<br/>
colours its waters. It is broader and deeper than the<br/>
eastern arm, and it brings down a much larger volume of<br/>
water; the ancients appear to have regarded it as the true<br/>
Nile. There can, however, be no doubt that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elAzralr </span>has the best right to be considered the true Nile,<br/>
for during the violent and rapid course which it takes from<br/>
the Abyssinian mountains, it carries down with it all the<br/>
rich mud which, during the lapse of ages, has been spread<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>The White Nile rises in the mountainous districts a few degrees<br/>
north of the Equator, and the principal streams which flow into it<br/>
are those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobit</span>, Giraffe, and Gazelle rivers. It is not navigable,<br/>
and its banks are so low that its whitish slimy deposit often extends<br/>
to a distance of two miles from the stream. For about a hundred<br/>
miles south of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharip1m </span>the river is little more than a marsh.<br/>
