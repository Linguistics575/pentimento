these being joined by new comers, the city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat </span>at<br/>
length arose. It was enlarged by Ahmed ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuliln</span>,<br/>
who built a mosque there; by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khaman1yeh</span>, who built a<br/>
palace there; but when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fétimite </span>Khalif Mu'izz conquered Egypt (A.D. 969), he removed the seat of his<br/>
government from there, and founded <span style="color: #0000FF;">Masr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Phira</span>, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mast<br/>
</span>the Victorious," near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat</span>, which was also known<br/>
by the name of Masr, was henceforth called <span style="color: #0000FF;">May </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Atilia</span>.<br/>
During the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saléheddin </span>the walls of the new city were<br/>
thoroughly repaired and the citadel was built. Sultan after<br/>
Sultan added handsome buildings to the town, and though it<br/>
suffered from plagues and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fires</span>, it gained the reputation of<br/>
being one of the most beautiful capitals in the Muhammadan empire. In 1517 it was captured by Selim <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, and<br/>
Egypt became a pashalik of the Turkish empire, and<br/>
remained so until its conquest by Napoleon Bonaparte in<br/>
1798. Cairo was occupied by Muhammad'Ali in 1805<br/>
and the massacre of the Mamelukes took place March <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>,<br/>

</span>COPTIC CHURCHES IN CAIRO. *<br/>
<br/>
The Church of MAR MiNA lies between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostyit </span>and<br/>
Cairo; it was built in honour of St. Menas, an early<br/>
martyr, who is said to have been born at Mareotis, and<br/>
martyred during the persecution of Galerius Maximinus at<br/>
Alexandria. The name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mina</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mena</span>, probably represents<br/>
<br/>
the Coptic form of Meni, eeeh <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>, the name of the first<br/>
<br/>
historical king of Egypt. The church was probably<br/>
founded during the fourth century, and it seems to have<br/>
been restored in the eighth century<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the first church built<br/>
