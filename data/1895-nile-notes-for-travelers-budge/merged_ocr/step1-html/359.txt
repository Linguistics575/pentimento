<br/>
</span>the hill, and was made for the rulers of Elephantine who<br/>
lived <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the VIth and XIIth dynasties. The second group<br/>
is composed of tombs of different periods<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they are hewn out<br/>
of a lower layer of stone, and are not of so much importance.<br/>
The third group, made during the Roman occupation of<br/>
Egypt, lies at a comparatively little height above the river.<br/>
All these tombs were broken into at a very early period, and<br/>
the largest of them formed a common sepulchre for people<br/>
of all classes from the XXVIth dynasty downwards. They<br/>
were found filled with broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>and mummies and<br/>
sepulchral <span style="color: #0000FF;">stelae</span>, etc., etc., and everything showed how<br/>
degraded Egyptian funereal art had become when these<br/>
bodies were buried there. The double tomb at the head of<br/>
the staircase was made for Sabben and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mechu</span>; the former<br/>
was a dignitary of high rank who lived during the reign of<br/>
Pepi <span style="color: #0000FF;">TI.</span>, a king of the VIth dynasty, whose prenomen<br/>
<br/>
l co <span style="color: #0000FF;">8 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">U </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>Nefer-ka-Ra is inscribed on the left hand side of<br/>
<br/>
the doorway; the latter was a <span style="color: #ff0000;">smer</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>prince and inspector,<br/>
who appears to have lived during the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIIth </span>dynasty. The<br/>
paintings on the walls and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">proto-Dork </span>columns<br/>
which support the roof are interesting, and its fine state<br/>
of preservation and position makes it one of the most<br/>
valuable monuments of that early period. A little <span style="color: #0000FF;">further<br/>
</span>northward is <span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>small tomb <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span>? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heqab</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond<br/>
</span>this is the fine, large tomb hewn originally for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Se-Renput</span>,<br/>
one of the old feudal hereditary governors of Elephantine,<br/>
but which was appropriated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ub-kau-Ra-necht</span>. He was<br/>
the governor of the district of the cataract, and the general<br/>
who commanded a lightly-armed body <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">soldiers </span>called "<span style="color: #0000FF;">runners</span>"; he lived during the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the second<br/>
king of the XIIth dynasty, and his tomb must have been<br/>
one of the earliest hewn there during that period. Another<br/>
interesting tomb is that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">F.leru-khuf</span>, and the inscriptions<br/>
show that the kings of Egypt were in the habit of sending<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
