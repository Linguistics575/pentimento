as a means of transport for troops from one point to<br/>
another. The name of the place Kantara,'a bridge,' a<br/>
little to the north of Isma'iliya, seems to point to the fact of<br/>
a ford existing here from very early times. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ekau </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 610)<br/>
began to make a canal at Bubastis, between the Nile and<br/>
the Red Sea, but never finished it; it was continued in later<br/>
times by Darius, and Ptolemy Philadelphus made a lock<br/>
for it; still later we know that the Mediterranean and Red<br/>
Seas were joined by a canal. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">emperor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Trajan </span>made a<br/>
canal from Cairo to the Red Sea, which, having become<br/>
impassable, was re-opened <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'Omar</span>'s general,'Amr ibn<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ewhs.si</span>, after his capture of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
In the Middle Ages various attempts were made in a<br/>
half-hearted manner to cut a new canal across the Isthmus,<br/>
but although several royal personages in and out of Egypt<br/>
were anxious to see the proposed work begun, nothing was<br/>
seriously attempted until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte<br/>
directed M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leplere </span>to survey the route of a canal across the<br/>
Isthmus. M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepere </span>reported that the difference between<br/>
the levels of the Red Sea and Mediterranean was thirty-three<br/>
feet, and, that, therefore, the canal was impossible.' Although<br/>
several scientific men doubted the accuracy of M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leplere's<br/>
</span>conclusion, the fact that the level of the two seas is practically<br/>
the same was not proved until M. Linant Bey, Stephenson,<br/>
and others examined the matter in 1846. It was then at<br/>
once evident that a canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>possible. M. de Lesseps<br/>
laid the plans for a canal before Sa'id Pasha in 1854<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>two<br/>
years afterwards they were sanctioned, and two years later<br/>
the works began<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The original plan proposed to make a<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Meteorologica</span>, i. 14, 27; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus</span>, i. 23; and Strabo, xvii. I, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>The Arab writer <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mas'tdi </span>relates that a certain king tried to cut<br/>
a canal across this isthmus, but that on finding that the waters of the<br/>
Red Sea stood at a higher level than those of the Mediterranean, he<br/>
abandoned his project. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Prairies </span>d'Or, <span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>iv<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>p. 97.)<br/>
