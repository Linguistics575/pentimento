<br/>
ment, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>policy was inaugurated which is difficult<br/>
either to understand or describe. The influx of objects<br/>
during <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero</span>'s reign at <span style="color: #0000FF;">J3f</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">liil.r </span>was great-so great that<br/>
it would have been impossible for him to incorporate them<br/>
all, even if he had had the necessary space; we now know<br/>
that many of them were exceedingly fine, yet after his<br/>
departure no attempt was made to exhibit them. This<br/>
might, in many cases, have been done easily, for poor<br/>
specimens could have been relegated to the "magazine,"<br/>
and fine ones exhibited in their stead<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>With the increase of accommodation for tourists and of<br/>
facilities for travelling after the occupation of Egypt by the<br/>
British, public opinion grew and waxed strong, and the<br/>
advisers of the late Khedive found it necessary to consider<br/>
the task of the removal of the Egyptian antiquities from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Biik1lr </span>to a safer and larger resting-place. The Egyptian<br/>
Government had no funds at their disposal with which to<br/>
build <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>new Museum, and after much discussion it was<br/>
decided to transfer the antiquities <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the large palace at<br/>
Gizeh, which is said to have cost five millions <span style="color: #0000FF;">sterling<br/>
</span>The usual irresponsible opposition to the scheme was<br/>
offered by those who should have known better, but there<br/>
seems to be little doubt that this decision was the best that<br/>
could have been arrived at under the circumstances in<br/>
which the Egyptian Government was placed. The fabric<br/>
of the Gizeh palace seems to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">flimsy</span>, and the appearance<br/>
of the building is not that which those who are acquainted<br/>
with European museums are accustomed to associate with<br/>
Egyptian antiquities; it is, nevertheless, a large building,<br/>
and the fact that it would cost nothing must have been a<br/>
great inducement to transform the palace into a museum<br/>
Much was said at first about danger to the antiquities from<br/>
fire, but it is quite certain that the danger from fire at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jrdhil.r<br/>
</span>was greater than it is at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>. Some excellent alterations<br/>
in the building and arrangements to prevent fire were made<br/>
