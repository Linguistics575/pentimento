<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">54 </span>NOTES FOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELLERS </span>IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
of the ancient Egyptian religion from the papyri and other<br/>
native records; but it is also true that during the reigns of<br/>
these two Ptolemies the Egyptians were firmly kept in<br/>
obscurity, and that the ancient priest-college of Heliopolis<br/>
was suppressed. A century or two after the Christian era,<br/>
Greek had obtained such a hold upon the inhabitants of<br/>
Egypt that the Egyptian Christians, the followers and<br/>
disciples of St. Mark, were obliged to use the Greek<br/>
alphabet to write down the Egyptian, that is to say Coptic<br/>
translation of the books of the Old and New Testaments.<br/>
The letters <span style="color: #0000FF;">99</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">sh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">q</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>, Jo, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">J</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">f</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">h </span>X<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">k</span>, were<br/>
added from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>forms of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>characters to<br/>
represent sounds which were unknown in the Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">language</span>. During the Greek rule over Egypt many of the<br/>
hieroglyphic characters had new phonetic values given to<br/>
them; by this time the knowledge of hieroglyphic writing<br/>
had practically died out.<br/>
<br/>
The history of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decipherment </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>is of<br/>
great interest, but no thorough account of it can he<br/>
given here; only the most important facts connected<br/>
with it can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>mentioned. During the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XVItlr-NVIIIth<br/>
</span>centuries many attempts <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>made by scholars to interpret the hieroglyphic inscriptions then known to the<br/>
world, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>they resulted in nothing useful. The fact is that<br/>
they did not understand the nature of the problem to<br/>
be solved, and they failed to perceive the use of the<br/>
same hieroglyphic character <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>phonetic or determinative<br/>
in the same inscription. In 1799, a French officer <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bolbitane </span>or Rosetta a basalt slab inscribed in the<br/>
hieroglyphic, <span style="color: #ff0000;">demotie</span>, and Greek characters; it was shortly<br/>
after captured by the English army, and taken to London,<br/>
where it was carefully examined by Dr. Thomas Young<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span>Thomas Young was <span style="color: #0000FF;">born </span>at Milverton, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Somersetshire</span>, on the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">13th </span>of June, 1773; both his parents were Quakers. At the age of<br/>
fourteen he is said to have been versed in Greek, Latin, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Flench</span>,<br/>
