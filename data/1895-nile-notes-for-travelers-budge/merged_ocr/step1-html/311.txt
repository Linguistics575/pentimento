After the burning and sacking of this temple by the<br/>
Persians, some slight repairs, and rebuilding of certain<br/>
chambers, were carried out by some of the Ptolemies, the<br/>
name of one of whom (Philopator) is found inscribed on<br/>
the temple. Certain parts of the temple appear to have<br/>
been used by the Copts as a church, for the ancient<br/>
sculptures have been plastered over and painted with<br/>
figures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">saints</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>The Temple at Karnak. The ruins of the buildings at Karnak are perhaps the most wonderful of any in<br/>
Egypt, and they merit many visits from the traveller. It is<br/>
probable that this spot was "holy ground" from a very<br/>
early to a very late period, and we know that a number of<br/>
kings from Thothmes III. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. lavished much<br/>
wealth to make splendid the famous shrine of Amen in the<br/>
Apts, and other temples situated there. The temples of<br/>
Luxor and Karnak were united by an avenue about 6,500<br/>
feet long and 80 feet wide, on each side of which was<br/>
arranged a row of sphinxes<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>from the fact that these monuments are without names, M. Mariette thought that the<br/>
avenue was constructed at the expense of the priests or the<br/>
wealthy inhabitants of the town, just as in later days the<br/>
pronaos of the temple at Denderah was built by the people<br/>
of that town. At the end of this avenue, to the right, is a<br/>
road which leads to the so-called Temple of Mut, which<br/>
was also approached by an avenue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sphinxes</span>. Within<br/>
the enclosure there stood originally two temples, both of<br/>
which were dedicated to Amen, built during the reign of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>III.; Rameses II. erected two obelisks in front<br/>
of the larger temple. To the north-west of these a smaller<br/>
temple was built in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>times, and the ruins on one<br/>
side of it show that the small temples which stood there<br/>
were either founded or restored by Rameses IL, Osorkon,<br/>
