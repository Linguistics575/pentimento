</span>indicate that the place was situated in a swampy district<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>and that foreigners dwelt there. The Arabs have adopted<br/>
the shorter name of the town, and call it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sin</span>. Dr. H.<br/>
Brugsch <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to show that Tanis represented the<br/>
town of Rameses, which was built by the Israelites, but<br/>
his theory has not been generally accepted, although <span style="color: #0000FF;">there<br/>
</span>is no doubt whatever that Tchar and Tanis are one and the<br/>
same town. The other names of Tanis given by Dr.<br/>
Brugsch in his great Dictionnaire <span style="color: #ff0000;">G'eograthique </span>are "Mesen,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Meson </span>of the North, Teb of the North, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behutet </span>of the<br/>
North." Tanis was situated on the right or east bank of the<br/>
Tana'itic branch of the Nile, about thirty miles nearly due<br/>
west of the ancient Pelusium<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and as it was near the northeast frontier of Egypt, it was always one of the towns which<br/>
formed the object of the first attack of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span>Hyksos, Syrians, Assyrians, Greeks, Arabs, and Turks.<br/>
The excavations which have been made in the ruins round<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">San </span>by Mariette and Petrie prove that Tanis must<br/>
have been one of the largest and most important cities in<br/>
the Delta. The earliest monuments found here date from<br/>
the time of Pepi L, VIth dynasty, about B.C. 3233; the<br/>
next oldest are the black granite statues of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span>L and<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">K </span>Zoan must have been considered a place of great importance by<br/>
the Hebrews, for they date the founding of Hebron by it (Numbers,<br/>
xiii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">aa</span>), and Isaiah, describing the future calamities of Egypt, says,<br/>
" Surely the princes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zoan </span>are fools." (Isaiah xix. I I.)<br/>
