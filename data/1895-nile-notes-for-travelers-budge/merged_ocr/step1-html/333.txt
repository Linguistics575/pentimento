that a small expedition to Thebes should at once be made<br/>
to take possession of and bring to Cairo the antiquities<br/>
which were to be revealed to the world <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'Abd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Rall<br/>
</span>Ahmad, and the charge of bringing this work to a successful issue was placed in the hands of M. Emile Brugsch.<br/>
Although the season was summer, and the heat very great,<br/>
the start for Thebes was made on July <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh </span>M.<br/>
Brugsch found a number of papyri and other valuable<br/>
antiquities which'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Ras1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>had sent there as an earnest<br/>
of the truth of his promise to reveal the hidden treasures.<br/>
A week later M. Brugsch and his companions were shown<br/>
the shaft of the tomb, which was most carefully hidden in<br/>
the north-west part of the natural circle which opens to the<br/>
south of the valley of Dér <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Bahari</span>, in the little row of<br/>
hills which separates the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biban </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Multlk </span>from the Theban<br/>
plain. According to M. Maspero', the royal mummies<br/>
were removed here from their tombs in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Muli</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1k<br/>

them being destroyed by the thieves, who were sufficiently<br/>
numerous and powerful to defy the government of the day.<br/>
The pit which led to the tomb was about forty feet deep,<br/>
and the passage, of irregular level, which led to the tomb<br/>
was about 220 feet long; at the end of this passage was a<br/>
nearly rectangular chamber about <span style="color: #ff0000;">twenrrfive </span>feet long,<br/>
which was found to be literally filled with <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins</span>, mummies,<br/>
funereal furniture, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bases</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">usltabtiu </span>figures, Canopic jars<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>

</span>jars, which were placed in his tomb under the bier; the jars were<br/>
dedicated to the four children of Horus, who were called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mestha</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wipi</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuamautef </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Qeblysennuf</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">name</span>"is given to them<br/>
by those who follow the opinion <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>some ancient writers that Canopus,<br/>
the pilot of Menelaus, who is said to have been buried at Canopus<br/>
in Egypt, was worshipped there under the form of a jar with small<br/>
