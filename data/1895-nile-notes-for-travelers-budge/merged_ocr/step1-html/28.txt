<span>4 NOTES <span style="color: #0000FF;">FOR </span>TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
was drawn up in the time of Thothmes <span style="color: #ff0000;">III.</span>, and contains<br/>
the names of sixty-one of his ancestors<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They are not<br/>
arranged in any chronological order, but the tablet is of the<br/>
highest historical importance, for it records the names of<br/>
some of the rulers from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIIIth </span>to the XVIIth<br/>
dynasties, and gives the names of those of the XIth<br/>
dynasty more completely than any other list.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Annals of Egyptian Kings inscribed upon the<br/>
walls of temples, obelisks, and buildings. The narrative of<br/>
such inscriptions is very simple, and practically these records<br/>
merely represent itineraries in which the names of conquered<br/>
and tributary lands and people are given; incidentally facts<br/>
of interest are noted down. As the day and month and<br/>
regnal years of the king by whom these expeditions were<br/>
undertaken are generally given, these inscriptions throw<br/>
much light on history. The lists of tribute are also useful,<br/>
for they show what the products of the various countries<br/>
were. The poetical <span style="color: #0000FF;">version</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>of the history of the famous<br/>
battle of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>against the Cheta by the poet <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pen-ea-un<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pleasant variety of historical narrative. The inscription<br/>
on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">stelet </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pianchi</span>, the Ethiopian conqueror of Egypt,<br/>
is decidedly remarkable for the minute details of his fights,<br/>
the speeches made by himself and his conquered foes, and<br/>
the mention of many facts<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>which are not commonly noticed<br/>
by Egyptian annalists. The vigour and poetical nature of<br/>
the narrative are also very striking.<br/>

I For example, it is stated that when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Piiinchi </span>had taken possession<br/>
of the storehouses and treasury of Nimrod his foe, he went afterwards<br/>
into the stables, and found that the horses there had been kept short <span style="color: #0000FF;">01<br/>
</span>food. Bursting into a rage he turned to Nimrod and said, "By my<br/>
life, by my darling <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>, who revives my nostrils with life, to have kept<br/>
my horses hungry is more heinous in my sight than any other offence<br/>
which thou hast committed against me." <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mariette</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mouumeuts </span>Divers,<br/>
