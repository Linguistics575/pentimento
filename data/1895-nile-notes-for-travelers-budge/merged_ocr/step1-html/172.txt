1870 by M. Barillet, and has an area of about twenty acres.<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">NILOMETER </span>IN THE ISLAND OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">RopA</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Nilometer here is a pillar, which is divided into<br/>
seventeen parts, each representing a cubit, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">21</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>inches,<br/>
and each cubit is divided into <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-four </span>parts. This<br/>
pillar is placed in the centre of a well about sixteen feet<br/>
square; the lower end is embedded in the foundations, and<br/>
the upper end is held in position by a beam built into the<br/>
side walls. The well is connected with the Nile by a<br/>
channel. The first Nilometer at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roda </span>is said to have<br/>
been built by the Khalif <span style="color: #ff0000;">Suléman </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ano</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vr</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">V7</span>), and<br/>
about one hundred years later the building was restored<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miinrr1n </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8r3-833</span>). At the end of the eleventh<br/>
century a dome resting upon columns was built over it.<br/>
When the Nile is at its lowest level it stands at the height<br/>
of seven cubits in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nilometer </span>well, and when it reaches<br/>
the height of 15% cubits, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>of the Nile proclaims<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>water has come into the river to admit of the<br/>
cutting of the dam which prevents the water from flowing<br/>
over the country. The difference between the highest rise<br/>
and the lowest fall of the Nile at Cairo is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five<br/>
</span>feet. The cutting of the dam takes place some time during<br/>
the second or third week in August, at which time there are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">generalrejoicings</span>. When there happens to be an exceptionally<br/>
high Nile, the whole island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roda </span>is submerged, and the<br/>
waters flow over the Nilometer to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>depth of two cubits, a<br/>
fact which proves that the bed of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>is steadily rising,<br/>
and one which shows how <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>it is to harmonize all the<br/>
statements made by Egyptian, Greek, and Arab writers on<br/>
the subject. As the amount of taxation to be borne by the<br/>
people has always depended upon the height of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inundation</span>, attempts were formerly made by the governments of<br/>
Egypt to prove to the people that there never was a low <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>.<br/>
