DAHSHUR.<br/>
<br/>
The brick pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshilr</span>, commonly called the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>black pyramids," lie on the edge of the sandy plain which<br/>
bounds the Nile Valley on the west; one is situated to the<br/>
north of the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahsht1r</span>, facing the hamlet of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Menshiyyeh</span>, and the other, some miles distant from the<br/>
first, stands more to the north, about half-way between<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Menshiyyeh </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkara</span>. The systematic exploration and<br/>
examination of these interesting monuments was the task<br/>
which the indefatigable Director-General of Antiquities set<br/>
himself during the winter of 1893-4.<br/>
<br/>
The northern pyramid is <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bricks </span>laid without mortar,<br/>
in place of which sand is used, and an examination of them<br/>
shows that they belong to the period of the XIIth <span style="color: #ff0000;">dynasty</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Soon after the work of clearing had been begun, a stone<br/>
<br/>
bearing the cartouche of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BUUU<br/>
<br/>
</span>was found, and thus a tolerably exact date was ascertained<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>on the 26th of February, 1894, the entrance to a pit was<br/>
found, and in the east corner there appeared an opening<br/>
which led through a gallery and sepulchral chamber to<br/>
several tombs. In one chamber were the fragments of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>sarcophagus and statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menthu-nesu</span>, and in another was<br/>
the sarcophagus of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nefert-hent</span>; it was quite clear that<br/>
these tombs had been wrecked in ancient days, and therefore to the pit by which they were reached M. de Morgan<br/>
gave the name, <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>Pit of the spoilers." Along the principal<br/>
gallery were four tombs, and in the second of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">queen<br/>
</span>had been buried; on the lower stage eight sarcophagi were<br/>
found, but only two were inscribed. Subsequently it was<br/>
found that the burial place of a series of princesses had<br/>
been found, and in consequence M. de Morgan called the<br/>
place <span style="color: #ff0000;">tt </span>Gallery of Princesses." In one of the tombs (No. 3)<br/>
