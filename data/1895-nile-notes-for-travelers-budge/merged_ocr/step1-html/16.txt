<br/>
and Persians, Greeks and Romans, Arabs and Turks.<br/>
It is for this reason that no attempt has been made<br/>
to describe, otherwise than in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">briefest </span>possible<br/>
manner, its history under these foreign rulers, and<br/>
only such facts connected with them as are absolutely<br/>
necessary for a right understanding of its monuments<br/>
have been inserted. In addition to such descriptions,<br/>
a few chapters have been added on the history of<br/>
the country during the rule of the Pharaohs, its<br/>
people, the religion and method of writing. At the<br/>
end of the book a fairly full list of the most important Egyptian kings is appended, and in order<br/>
to make this list as useful as possible, a transliteration<br/>
of each name is printed beneath it, together with<br/>
the ordinary form of the name. The list of three<br/>
hundred hieroglyphic characters and their phonetic<br/>
values, printed on <span style="color: #0000FF;">pp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">62</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">68</span>, will, it is hoped, be useful<br/>
to those who may like to spell out the royal names<br/>
on tombs and temples and the commoner words which<br/>
occur in the inscriptions. For those who wish to<br/>
study independently the various branches of Egyptology, a list of the more readily obtained books is given<br/>
in the "Programme" issued yearly by Thos. Cook<br/>
and Son (Egypt), Ltd.<br/>
<br/>
In transcribing Arabic names of places the most<br/>
<br/>
authoritative forms have been followed, but such well<br/>
