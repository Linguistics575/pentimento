<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">210</span>. Grey granite statue of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lion-headed </span>goddess<br/>
Sekhet, who represented the destructive heat of the<br/>
sun<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>this monument bears the name of Amenophis III.<br/>
<br/>
From the temple of Mut at Karnak.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">213</span>. Black granite stele inscribed with a poetical account<br/>
of the victories of Thothmes III. The text is a speech<br/>
of the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra </span>addressed to Thothmes. After<br/>
describing the glory and might which he has attached to<br/>
his name, he goes on to mention the countries which he<br/>
had made his son Thothmes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">conquer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>The countries<br/>
enumerated include <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tchah </span>and Ruthen in northern<br/>
Syria, Phoenicia and Cyprus, Mathen or Mitani on the<br/>
borders of Mesopotamia by the Euphrates, the countries<br/>
along the Red Sea, the land of Nubia and the countries<br/>
lying to the south of it, and the northern parts of Africa.<br/>
Although <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span>wasted and destroyed these lands, it<br/>
cannot be said that he was successful in imposing the<br/>
yoke of Egypt upon them permanently, for history shows<br/>
that on the accession to the throne of each of his successors it was necessary to re-conquer them. Many of<br/>
the phrases are stereotyped expressions which' we find<br/>
repeated in the texts of other kings. This monument<br/>
was found at Karnak, on the site of the famous temple of<br/>
Amen of the Apts, and shows marks of erasures <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>the order of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>IV., the king who vainly tried to<br/>
upset the national religion of Egypt. XVIIIth dynasty.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in 1861. It is a precious document, for it contained<br/>
