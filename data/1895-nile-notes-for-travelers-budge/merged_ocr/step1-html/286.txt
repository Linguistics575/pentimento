<span>262 NOTES <span style="color: #0000FF;">FOR </span>TRAVELLERS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
it was found that he had conceived a rooted dislike to the<br/>
worship of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span>, the king of the gods and great lord of<br/>
Thebes, and that he preferred the worship of the disk of the<br/>
sun to that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>as a sign of his opinions he called<br/>
himself "beloved of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>disk," instead of the usual and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">time-honoured </span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">beloved </span>of Amen." The native Egyptian<br/>
priesthood disliked the foreign queen, and the sight of her son<br/>
with his protruding chin, thick lips, and other characteristic<br/>
features of the negro race, found no favour in their sight;<br/>
that such a man should openly despise the worship of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ri-i </span>was a thing intolerable to the priesthood, and angry<br/>
words and acts were, on their part, the result. In answer to<br/>
their objections the king ordered the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amen-Ra </span>to<br/>
be chiselled out of all the monuments, even from <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>father's<br/>
names. Rebellion then broke out, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chut-enciten<br/>
</span>thought it best to leave <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes7 </span>and to found a new city for<br/>
himself at a place between Memphis and Thebes, now<br/>
called Tell el-Amarna. The famous architect <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bek</span>, whose<br/>
father, Men, served under Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, designed the<br/>
temple buildings, and in a very short time a splendid town<br/>
with beautiful granite sculptures sprang out of the desert.<br/>
As an insult to the priests and people of Thebes, he built<br/>
a sandstone and granite temple at Thebes in honour of the<br/>
god Harmachis. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chut-en-Men</span>'s new town, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chut-hten</span>,<br/>
"the splendour of the sun's disk," was finished, his mother<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thi </span>came to live there; and here the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">passed </span>his life<br/>
quietly with his mother, wife, and seven daughters. He<br/>
died leaving no male issue, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>of the husbands of<br/>
his daughters became king. In 1887 a number of important cuneiform tablets, which confirmed in a remarkable<br/>
manner many facts connected with this period of Egyptian<br/>
history, were found at Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Amarna </span>(see page 187)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
tombs in the rocks <span style="color: #0000FF;">near </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Amarna </span>are of considerable<br/>
interest. In 1892 Mr. Petrie uncovered a painted fresco<br/>
pavement about 51 by 16 feet.<br/>
