"Keep one faithful steward only, and watch his deeds,<br/>
and let thy hand protect the man who hath charge of<br/>
thy house and property.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>The man who having received much giveth little, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>one who <span style="color: #ff0000;">committeth </span>an injury..<br/>
<br/>
"Be not ungrateful to God, for He giveth thee existence.<br/>
<br/>
"Sit not while another <span style="color: #ff0000;">standeth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>be older than thou,<br/>
or if he is thy superior.<br/>

"Whosoever speaketh evil <span style="color: #ff0000;">receiveth </span>no good.<br/>
<br/>
"When thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">makest </span>offerings to God, offer not that<br/>
which He <span style="color: #ff0000;">abominateth</span>. Dispute not concerning His<br/>
mysteries. The god of the world is in the light<br/>
above the firmament, and his emblems are upon<br/>
earth; it is unto those that worship is paid daily.<br/>
<br/>
"When thou hast arrived at years of maturity, and art<br/>
married and hast a house, forget never the pains<br/>
which thou hast cost thy mother, nor the care which<br/>
she hath bestowed upon thee. Never give her cause<br/>
to complain <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thee</span>, lest she lift up her hands to God<br/>
in heaven, and He listen to her complaint.<br/>
<br/>
"Be watchful to keep silence."<br/>
