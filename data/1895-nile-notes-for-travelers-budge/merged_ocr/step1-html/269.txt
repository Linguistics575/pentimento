written the names of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris-Apis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Serapis, concluded<br/>
that they must have come from the Serapeum or temple of<br/>
Serapis spoken of by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>. Happening, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">chance</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to<br/>
discover one day at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>a Sphinx having the same<br/>
characteristics, he made up his mind that he had lighted<br/>
upon the remains of the long sought for building. The<br/>
excavations which he immediately undertook, brought to<br/>
light the Avenue of Sphinxes, eleven statues of Greek<br/>
philosophers, and the vaults in which the Apis bulls were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">buried </span>These vaults are of three kinds, and show that the<br/>
Apis bulls were buried in different ways at different periods:<br/>
the oldest Apis sarcophagus laid here belongs to the reign<br/>
of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, about B.C. 1500. The parts of the Apis<br/>
Mausoleum in which the Apis bulls were buried from the<br/>
XVIIIth to the XXVIth dynasty are not visible; but the new<br/>
gallery, which contains sixty-four vaults, the oldest of which<br/>
dates from the reign of Psammetichus L, and the most<br/>
modern from the time of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, can be seen on<br/>
application to the guardian of the tombs. The vaults are<br/>
excavated on each side of the gallery, and each was<br/>
intended to receive a granite sarcophagus. The names<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amasis </span>IL, Cambyses, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chabbesha </span>are found<br/>
upon three of the sarcophagi, but most of them are uninscribed. Twenty-four granite sarcophagi still remain in position, and they each measure about 13 x 8 <span style="color: #ff0000;">X </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">II </span>feet. The<br/>
discovery of these tombs was of the greatest importance<br/>
historically, for on the walls were found thousands of dated<br/>
stelae which gave accurate chronological <span style="color: #0000FF;">data </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>history<br/>
of Egypt. These votive tablets mention the years, months,<br/>
and days of the reign of the king in which the Apis bulls,<br/>
in whose honour the tablets were set up, were born and<br/>
buried. The Apis tombs had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">rifled </span>in ancient times,<br/>
and only two of them contained any relics when M. Mariette<br/>
opened them out.<br/>
