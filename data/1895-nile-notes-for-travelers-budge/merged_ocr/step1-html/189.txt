with a scene in which geese are represented walking<br/>
along. The artist has depicted the birds with great<br/>
fidelity to nature, and was evidently a very accomplished<br/>
draughtsman. This fragile object was brought from a<br/>
ruined <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ire0m </span>by M. Vassali, and dates<br/>
probably from the IVth dynasty.<br/>

Pyramid (see page 241) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salsls2rah</span>. A slab, resting<br/>
on the backs of a pair of lions, has a trench cut in it for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>liquid into a bowl, which stands between<br/>
the tails of the two lions.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mhh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, which is generally thought to have been built by<br/>
Seneferu the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>of the IVth dynasty. The eyes<br/>
are filled with quartz or rock crystal. Mariette placed the<br/>
period when this statue was made in the IIIrd dynasty,<br/>
but Maspero thinks that it belongs to the XIIth dynasty.<br/>
