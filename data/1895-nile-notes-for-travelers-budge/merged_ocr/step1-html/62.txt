<span>38 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The population of Egypt to-day comprises the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fellibin</span>,<br/>
Copts, Bedawin, Jews, Turks, Negroes, Nubians and people<br/>
from Abyssinia, Armenians and Europeans.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">FelWpin </span>amount to about four-fifths of the entire<br/>
population of Egypt, and are chiefly employed in agricultural<br/>
pursuits. In physical type they greatly resemble the ancient<br/>
Egyptians as depicted on the monuments. Their complexion is dark; they have straight eyebrows, high cheek<br/>
bones, flat noses with low bridges, slightly protruding<br/>
jaws, broad shoulders, large mouths and full lips. The<br/>
colour of their skin becomes darker as the south is<br/>
approached. The whole of the cultivation of Egypt is<br/>
in the hands of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellhbin</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Copts are also direct descendants from the ancient<br/>
Egyptians, and inhabit chiefly the cities of Upper Egypt,<br/>
such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyiit </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahmim</span>. The name Copt is derived<br/>
from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Â£6 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">JTubt</span>, the Arabic form of the Coptic form of the<br/>
Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">hame </span>for Egyptian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aththrrioss</span>; it may be mentioned,<br/>
in passing, that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ai'eyvmoe</span>, Egypt, is thought by some to be<br/>
derived from an ancient Egyptian name for Memphis,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">f.fet-ka-f'tab</span>, "The house of the genius of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptab</span>." The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Copts in Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">today </span>is estimated at about<br/>
350,000, and the greater number of them are engaged in<br/>
the trades of goldsmiths, <span style="color: #0000FF;">clothworkers</span>, etc.; a respectable<br/>
body of clerks and accountants in the postal, telegraph and<br/>
government <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>in Egypt, is drawn from their community.<br/>
They are clever with their fingers, and are capable of rapid<br/>
education up to a certain point; beyond this they rarely<br/>
go. Physically, they are of a finer type than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellitbin</span>;<br/>
their heads are longer and their features are more European.<br/>
<br/>
The Copts are famous in ecclesiastical history for having<br/>
embraced with extraordinary zeal and rapidity the doctrines<br/>
of Christianity as preached by St. Mark at Alexandria.<br/>
Before the end of the third century <span style="color: #ff0000;">A.D. </span>Egypt was filled<br/>
with hundreds of thousands of ascetics, monks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">recluse</span>,<br/>
