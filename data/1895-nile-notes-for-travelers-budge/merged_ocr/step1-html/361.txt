cause the falls of water which have given this part of the<br/>
river its name. On the west side the obstacles are not so<br/>
numerous as on the east, and sailing and rowing boats can<br/>
ascend the cataract on this side when the river is high.<br/>
The noise made by the water is at times very great, but it<br/>
has been greatly <span style="color: #0000FF;">exaggerated </span>by both ancient and modern<br/>
travellers, some of whom ventured to assert that the "water<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fell </span>from several places in the mountain more than two<br/>
hundred feet." Some ancient writers asserted that the<br/>
fountains of the Nile were in this cataract, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Herodotush<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ieports </span>that an official of the treasury of Neith at Sais<br/>
stated that the source of the Nile was here. Many of the<br/>
rocks here are inscribed with the names of kings who<br/>
reigned during the Middle Empire; in many places on the<br/>
little islands in the cataract quarries were worked. The<br/>
island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seh√©l </span>should be visited on account of the<br/>
numerous inscriptions left there by princes, generals, and<br/>
others who passed by on their way to Nubia. On February<br/>
6th, 1889, Mr. Wilbour was fortunate enough to discover<br/>
on the south-eastern part of this island <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>important<br/>
stele consisting of a rounded block of granite, eight or<br/>
nine feet high, which stands clear above the water, and in<br/>
full view from the river looking towards Philae. Upon it<br/>
are inscribed thirty-two lines of hieroglyphics which form<br/>
a remarkable document, and contain some valuable infor<br/>
mation bearing upon a famous seven years' famine. The<br/>
inscription is dated in the eighteenth year of a king whose<br/>
<br/>
name is read by Dr. Brugsch as T'eser <span style="color: #0000FF;">W0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
