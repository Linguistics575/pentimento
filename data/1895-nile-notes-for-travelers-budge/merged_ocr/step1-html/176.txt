<span>152 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
place of honour should be afforded to the well-preserved<br/>
mummy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>the Great, and to those of the mighty<br/>
kings who were his ancestors and successors. For one<br/>
object laid by in the "magazine "two new ones arrived to<br/>
claim its place.<br/>
<br/>
Under the beneficent rule of M. Maspero, the successor<br/>
of Mariette in the direction of the Museum, and that of<br/>
E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch </span>Bey, Mariette's colleague, excavations were<br/>
undertaken by natives and others in all parts of Egypt, and<br/>
the authorities of the Museum found themselves called<br/>
upon to provide exhibition rooms for antiquities of the<br/>
Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Coptic periods. This was an<br/>
impossibility, and at last it became certain that the<br/>
antiquities must be moved to a larger building. Moreover,<br/>
many people viewed with alarm the situation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Billie<br/>
</span>Museum itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the one side flowed the Nile, which<br/>
more than once during the inundation threatened to sweep<br/>
the whole building away, and the waters of which, on one<br/>
occasion, actually entered the courtyard; and on the other<br/>
were a number of warehouses of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flimsiest </span>construction,<br/>
filled with <span style="color: #0000FF;">inflammable </span>stores which might at any moment<br/>
catch fire and burn down the Museum. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">early </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">winter<br/>
</span>mornings the building was often full of the white, clinging,<br/>
drenching mist which is common along the banks of the<br/>
river, and it was no rare thing to see water trickling down<br/>
inside the glass cases which held the mummies of the great<br/>
kings of Egypt. With all its faults, however, there was<br/>
much to be said for the old <span style="color: #ff0000;">JJfoliilf </span>Museum, and the<br/>
arrangement of the antiquities therein. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Every </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">important<br/>
</span>object was numbered, and the excellent catalogue of<br/>
M. Maspero gave the visitor <span style="color: #ff0000;">agreat </span>deal of information<br/>
about the antiquities. Had M. Maspero remained in<br/>
Egypt he would, no doubt, have added to his catalogue,<br/>
and every important change in the arrangement of the<br/>
rooms would have been duly chronicled. After his retire<br/>
