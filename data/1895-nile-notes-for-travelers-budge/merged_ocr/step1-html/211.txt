<span>THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT <span style="color: #0000FF;">GiZEH</span>. 187<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">quired </span>160, a large number being fragments, the British<br/>
Museum 82, and the Gizeh Museum 55. These documents<br/>
were probably written between the years <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1500-1450</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Tell el-Amarna tablets supply entirely new <span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>concerning the political relations which existed between<br/>
the kings of Egypt and the kings of Western Asia, and<br/>
prove that an important trade between the two countries<br/>
existed from very early times. They also supply facts concerning treaties, alliances, religious ceremonies, etc., which<br/>
cannot be derived from any other source, and they give<br/>
us for the first time the names of Artatama, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Artashumara</span>,<br/>
and Tushratta, kings of Mitani (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mathen </span>of the Egyptian<br/>
inscriptions), and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kallimma-Sin</span>, King of Karaduniyash.<br/>
The dialect in which these inscriptions are written has a<br/>
close affinity to the language of the Old Testament.<br/>
<br/>
The first conquest of Syria by the Egyptians took place<br/>
in the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amasis </span>L, B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1700</span>. Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, B.C. 1633,<br/>
conquered all Palestine and Syria, and set up a tablet at<br/>
Ruthen to mark the boundary of Egypt. Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>,<br/>
B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1600</span>, marched through Palestine and Syria and made<br/>
himself master of all the country from Gaza to the<br/>
Euphrates. At Tunip he established the Egyptian religion,<br/>
and at Ruthen, in the 33rd year of his reign, he set up a<br/>
tablet by the side of that of Thothmes I. The cuneiform<br/>
tablets call him<br/>

</span>Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, B.C. 1566, marched to Ni on the<br/>
Euphrates, and slew seven kings in Ruthen, and brought<br/>
their bodies to Egypt. Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>was not a great<br/>
conqueror in the strict sense of the word, but he was proclaimed conqueror of Kadesh, Tunip, Sankar, and north<br/>
