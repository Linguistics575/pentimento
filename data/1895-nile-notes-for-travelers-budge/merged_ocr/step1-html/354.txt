HAGAR SILSILEH.<br/>
<br/>
Hagar (or Gebel) Silsileh, 541% miles from Cairo, on<br/>
the east and west banks of the river, derives its name<br/>
probably not from the Arabic word of like sound meaning<br/>
"chain," but from the Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">ataohatch</span>, meaning "stone<br/>
wall"; the place is usually called <span style="color: #ff0000;">ngwg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chennu </span>in<br/>
hieroglyphic texts. The ancient Egyptians here quarried<br/>
the greater part of the sandstone used by them in their<br/>
buildings, and the names of the kings inscribed in the caves<br/>
here show that these quarries were used from the earliest to<br/>
the latest periods. The most extensive of these are to be<br/>
found on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">east </span>bank of the river, but those on the west<br/>
bank contain the interesting tablets of <span style="color: #0000FF;">f.Teru-em-heb</span>, a king<br/>
of the XVIIIth dynasty, who is represented conquering the<br/>
Ethiopians, Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>his son, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meneptab</span>, etc.<br/>
At Silsileh the Nile was worshipped, and the little temple<br/>
which Rameses II. built in this place seems to have been<br/>
dedicated chiefly to it. At this point the Nile narrows very<br/>
much, and it is generally thought that a cataract once<br/>
existed here; there is, however, no evidence to show when<br/>
the Nile broke through and swept such a barrier, if it ever<br/>
existed, away.<br/>
<br/>
KOM OMBO.<br/>
<br/>
Kom Ombo, 556% miles from Cairo, on the east bank<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile, was an important place at all periods of<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian history; it was called by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptiansrieii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>Pa-Schuh, "the temple of Sebek "( the crocodile god), and<br/>
