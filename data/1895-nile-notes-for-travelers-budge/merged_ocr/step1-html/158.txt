<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">134 </span>NOTES FOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELLERS </span>1N EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenemhat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, a sandstone statue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, an<br/>
inscribed granite fragment of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span>111., and two statues<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebek-hetep </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill</span>. Following these come the most interesting black granite sphinxes, which are usually said to be the<br/>
work of the so-called Hyksos (see pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">174</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r75</span>), but which<br/>
are, in my opinion, older than the period when these people<br/>
ruled over Lower Egypt. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>inscribed upon<br/>
them only prove that many kings were anxious to have<br/>
their names added to these monuments. The greatest<br/>
builder at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunis </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, who erected a temple<br/>
with pylons, colossal statues, obelisks and sphinxes.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pasebkhanu</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shashanq </span>I. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shashanq </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>repaired and<br/>
added to the buildings in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunis</span>, and they took the<br/>
opportunity of usurping <span style="color: #0000FF;">sphinxes</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, etc., which<br/>
had been set up by earlier kings. The famous red granite<br/>
"Tablet of four hundred years" was found at San. The<br/>
inscription upon it, which is of the time of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, is<br/>
dated in the four hundredth year of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span>king named<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">ha-peb-peb-Set</span>, son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Sun, Nub-Set <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>N <span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, which appears to prove that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">king<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reigned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">400 </span>years before the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>II.<br/>
<br/>
The last native king of Egypt whose name is mentioned<br/>
at Tanis is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectancbus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, and after him come the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stele</span>, commonly called the "Decree of<br/>
Canopus," which was set up in the ninth year of Ptolemy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>I. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 238), was found here. The trilingual inscription in hieroglyphics, Greek, and Demotic,<br/>
mentions at some length the great benefits which this king<br/>
had conferred upon Egypt, and states what festivals are to<br/>
be celebrated in his honour and in that of Berenice. The<br/>
priests assembled at Canopus from all parts of Egypt<br/>
resolved that these things should be duly inscribed upon<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stelae</span>, of which one should be placed in every large temple<br/>
in Egypt to commemorate their resolution<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
