<br/>
him at Thebes and Memphis, and how he built up the<br/>
sacred doors. At the end of it he gives <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brief sketch of<br/>
his childhood, and the various grades of rank and dignities<br/>
which he held. In the interior the first hall, C, is of the<br/>
time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II.</span>, but it is possible to see under the<br/>
rough <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>of this king, the finer ones of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>;<br/>
this hall contains twenty-four pillars arranged in two rows.<br/>
The scenes on the walls represent figures of the gods and of<br/>
the king offering to them, the names of the nomes, etc., etc.<br/>
The second hall, D, is larger than the first, the style and<br/>
finish of the sculptures are very fine, the hieroglyphics are<br/>
in relief, and it contains 36 columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">arranged </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>three rows.<br/>
From this hall seven short naves dedicated to Horus, Isis,<br/>
Osiris, Amen, Harmachis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptah</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seti </span>L respectively, lead<br/>
into seven vaulted chambers, E, F, G, H, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, K, beautifully<br/>
shaped and decorated, which are dedicated to the same<br/>
beings. The scenes on the walls of six of these chambers<br/>
represent the ceremonies which the king ought to perform<br/>
in them<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>those in the seventh refer to the apotheosis of the<br/>
king. At the end of chamber G is a door which leads<br/>
into the sanctuary of Osiris, L, and in the corridor M is the<br/>
famous TABLET OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">ABYDOS</span>, which gives the names of<br/>
seventy-six kings of Egypt, beginning with Menes and<br/>
ending with Seti I. The value of this most interesting<br/>
monument has been pointed out on p. 3.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of Rameses II. was dedicated by this king<br/>
to the god Osiris; it lies a little to the north <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>of<br/>
Seti I. Many distinguished scholars thought that this was<br/>
the famous shrine which all Egypt adored, but the excavations made there by M. Mariette proved that it was<br/>
not. It would seem that during the French occupation<br/>
of Egypt in the early part of this century this temple<br/>
stood almost intact; since that time, however, so much<br/>
damage has been wrought upon it, that the portions of<br/>
wall which now remain are only about eight or nine feet<br/>
