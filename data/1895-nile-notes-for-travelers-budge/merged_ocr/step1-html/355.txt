The <span style="color: #ff0000;">oldest<br/>
<br/>
</span>object here is a sandstone gateway which Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>dedicated to the god Sebek.<br/>
<br/>
The temple is double, and consists of a large court<br/>
containing sixteen columns inscribed with the cartouche of<br/>
Tiberius, and a hypostyle hall containing nineteen columns<br/>
about 40 feet high. The pronaos has ten columns, three<br/>
chambers, and two shrines; one shrine is dedicated to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebek </span>and the other to Heru-ur or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aroueris</span>. The temple<br/>
measures about 500 feet by 250 feet, and stands at a height<br/>
of about 40 feet above the level of the Nile during its low<br/>
season. By the side which fronted the river there originally<br/>
stood a propylon and a small temple built by Domitian; on<br/>
the right of this stood the mammisi. The bas-reliefs upon<br/>
the walls and columns are exceedingly fine, and the delicacy<br/>
of the colours and the fineness of the workmanship are<br/>
equal, if not superior, to the art displayed at Edfu and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>. The inscriptions, although of a religious character,<br/>
are of considerable interest, and among them may be<br/>
mentioned (r), the dedicatory address of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">VII</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>(2), the calendar of the festivals<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(3), ephemerides with the<br/>
names of the deities who preside over the days of the year;<br/>
(4) and the texts referring to the geography of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names</span>.<br/>
The whole site of the temple has been recently laid bare<br/>
by M. de Morgan.<br/>
