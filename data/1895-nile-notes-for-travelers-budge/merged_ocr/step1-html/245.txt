</span>Heliopolis was about twelve miles from the fortress of<br/>
Babylon, and stood on the eastern side of the Pelusiac<br/>
arm of the Nile, near the right bank of the great canal<br/>
which passed through the Bitter Lakes and connected<br/>
the Nile with the sea. Its ruins cover an area three miles<br/>
square. The greatest and oldest Egyptian College or<br/>
University for the education of the priesthood and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">laity<br/>
</span>stood here, and it was here that Ptolemy II. Philadelphus,<br/>
sent for Egyptian manuscripts when he wished to augment<br/>
the library which his father had founded.<br/>
<br/>
The obelisk is sixty-six feet high, and was set up <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">U </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>about B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2433 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">g </span>a companion <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk<br/>
</span>remained standing in its place until the seventh century of<br/>
our era, and both were covered with caps of mm (probably<br/>
copper) metal. During the XXth dynasty the temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis </span>was one of the largest and wealthiest in all Egypt,<br/>
and its staff was numbered by thousands. When Cambyses<br/>
visited Egypt the glory of Heliopolis was well on the wane,<br/>
and after the removal of the priesthood and sages of the<br/>
temple to Alexandria by Ptolemy II. its downfall was well<br/>
assured. When Strabo visited it (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 24), the greater part<br/>
of it was in ruins; but we know from Arab writers that<br/>
many of the statues remained in <span style="color: #0000FF;">situ </span>at the end of the<br/>
twelfth century. Heliopolis had a large population of Jews,<br/>
and it will be remembered that Joseph married the daughter<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pa-W-pa-RE </span>(Potiphar) a priest <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>(Annu), or Heliopolis.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>lay either in or very near the Goshen of the Bible. The<br/>
Mnevis bull, sacred to Ra, was worshipped at Heliopolis, and<br/>
it was here that the phoenix <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>palm-bird brought its ashes<br/>
after having raised itself to life at the end of each period of<br/>
five hundred years. Alexander the Great halted here on<br/>
his way from Pelusium to Memphis. Macrobius says that<br/>
the Heliopolis of Syria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Baalbek, was founded by a body<br/>
of priests who left the ancient city of Heliopolis of Egypt.<br/>
