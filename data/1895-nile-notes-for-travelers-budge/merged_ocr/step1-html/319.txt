<br/>
passage in which stands the obelisk of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witshepset</span>, a long<br/>
avenue with four pylons is entered; the first was built by<br/>
Thothmes <span style="color: #ff0000;">III.</span>, the second by Thothmes L, and the third<br/>
and fourth by <span style="color: #0000FF;">f.leru-em-beb</span>. Between these last two, on the<br/>
east side stood <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>temple built by Amenophis II. On the<br/>
north side of the Great Temple are the ruins of two smaller<br/>
buildings which belong to the time of the XXVIth dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
The outside of the north wall of the Great Hall of<br/>
Columns is ornamented with some interesting scenes from the<br/>
battles of Seti I. against the peoples who lived to the northeast of Syria and in Mesopotamia, called Shasu, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rutennu</span>,<br/>
and Charu. The king is represented as having conquered<br/>
all these people, and returning to Thebes laden with much<br/>
spoil and bringing many captives. It is doubtful if the<br/>
events really took place in the order in which they are<br/>
depicted<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but the fidelity to nature, and the spirit and skill<br/>
with which these bas-reliefs have been executed, make them<br/>
some of the most remarkable sculptures known. The<br/>
scene in which Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>is shown grasping the hair of the<br/>
heads of a number of people, in the act of slaying them, is<br/>
symbolic.<br/>
<br/>
The outside of the south wall is ornamented with a large<br/>
scene in which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shashanq </span>(Shishak), the first king of the<br/>
XXIInd dynasty, is represented smiting a group of kneeling<br/>
prisoners; the god Amen, in the form of a woman, is<br/>
standing by presenting him with weapons of war. Here<br/>
also are 150 cartouches, surmounted with heads, in which<br/>
are written the names of the towns captured by Shishak.<br/>
The type of features given to these heads by the sculptor<br/>
shows that the vanquished peoples belonged to a branch of<br/>
the great Semitic family. The hieroglyphics in one of the<br/>
cartouches were supposed to read "the king of Judah,"<br/>
and to represent Jeroboam, who was vanquished by Shishak;<br/>
it has now been proved conclusively that they form the<br/>
name of a place called Iuta-melek<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Passing along <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>the<br/>
