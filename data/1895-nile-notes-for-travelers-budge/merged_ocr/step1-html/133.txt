<span>THE RELIGION AND GODS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>EGYPT. 109<br/>
<br/>
immediately acquainting the people with the news, gave the<br/>
first occasion to the name of Panic Terrors, which has ever<br/>
since been made use of to signify any sudden <span style="color: #0000FF;">affright </span>or<br/>
amazement of a multitude. As to Isis, as soon as the<br/>
report reached her, she immediately cut off one of the locks<br/>
of her hair, and put on mourning apparel upon the very<br/>
spot where she then happened to be, which accordingly from<br/>
this accident has ever since been called Coptos, or the City<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">oJMo1rrrringr</span>, though some are of opinion that this word<br/>
rather signifies Deprivation. After this she wandered<br/>
everywhere about the country full of <span style="color: #0000FF;">disquietude </span>and perplexity in search of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chest</span>, enquiring of every person she<br/>
met with, even of some children whom she chanced to see,<br/>
whether they knew what was become of it. Now it so<br/>
happened that these children had seen what Typhon's<br/>
accomplices had done with the body, and accordingly<br/>
acquainted her by what mouth of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>it had been conveyed into the sea.....<br/>
<br/>
"At length she received more particular news of the chest,<br/>
that it had been carried by the waves of the sea to the coast<br/>
of Byblos, and there gently lodged in the branches <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>bush<br/>
of Tamarisk, which in a short time had shot up into a large<br/>
and beautiful tree, growing round the chest and enclosing<br/>
it on every side, so that it was not to be seen<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and further,<br/>
that the king of the country, amazed at its unusual size, had<br/>
cut the tree down, and made that part of the trunk wherein<br/>
the chest was concealed a pillar to support the roof of his<br/>
house. These things, say they, being made known to Isis<br/>
in an extraordinary manner, by the report of demons, she<br/>
immediately went to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Byblos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>where, setting herself down<br/>
by the side of a fountain, she refused to speak to any body<br/>
excepting only to the queen's women who chanced to be<br/>
there<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>these she saluted and caressed in the kindest manner<br/>
possible, <span style="color: #0000FF;">plaiting </span>their hair for them, and transmitting<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ae.</span>, the papyrus swamps.<br/>
