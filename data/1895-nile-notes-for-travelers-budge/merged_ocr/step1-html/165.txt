north of Abu Sargah, are the two churches of Mar Girgis<br/>
and the Virgin.<br/>
<br/>
To the south of the fortress of Babylon, beyond the<br/>
Muhammadan village on the rising ground, lie the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Der </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Babltm </span>and the Der of Tadrus. In Dér <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Babltm </span>is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span>to the Virgin, which is very difficult to see. It<br/>
contains some fine mural paintings, and an unusual candlestick and lectern<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in it also are chapels dedicated to Saints<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lichael </span>and George. This little building is about fifty-three<br/>
feet square. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Tadrus </span>contains two churches dedicated<br/>
to Saints Cyrus and John of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darnanhh </span>in the Delta<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>there<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>some fine specimens of vestments to be seen there.<br/>
<br/>
A short distance from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iski </span>is a Der containing the<br/>
churches of the Virgin, St. George, and the chapel of Abu's<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Séfen</span>. The church of the Virgin occupies the lower half of<br/>
the building, and is the oldest in Cairo. The chapel of Abu's<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Séfén </span>is reached through a door in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">northwest </span>corner of<br/>
the building, and contains a wooden pulpit inlaid with<br/>
ivory. The church of St. George occupies the upper part<br/>
of the building, and is over the church of the Virgin.<br/>
<br/>
In the Greek (Byzantine) quarter of Cairo is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">D </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>el-Tadrus, which contains the churches of St. George and the Virgin.<br/>
<br/>
The Coptic churches of Cairo contain a great deal that is<br/>
interesting, and are well worth many visits. Though the<br/>
fabrics of many of them are not older than the sixth,<br/>
seventh, or eighth century of our era, it may well be<br/>
assumed that the sites were occupied by Coptic churches<br/>
long before this period.<br/>
<br/>
THE MOSQUES OF CAIRO.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking generally there are three types of mosque' in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span>The word "mosque" is derived from the Arabic "<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>place of prayer."<br/>
