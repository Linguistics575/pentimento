<span>188 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
western Mesopotamia, to which country he was in the habit<br/>
of going to shoot lions. Now we know from a scarab that<br/>
<br/>
a lady called Thi (<span style="color: #0000FF;">rio</span>, the daughter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iuia<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iitsli1iid </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thuha </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">L=stsi3iisii</span>, came to<br/>
<br/>
Egypt to become the wife of Amenophis in the tenth year<br/>
of his reign. We know also that she became the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">great<br/>
</span>Queen of Egypt," and as she is depicted with a fair complexion and blue eyes, there is no doubt that she is to be<br/>
identified with the lady called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ti</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IN</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;</span>, in the<br/>
inscriptions on the Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Amarna </span>tablets, who came from<br/>
the country to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">north-east </span>of Syria. Ti was the mother<br/>
of Amenophis <span style="color: #ff0000;">IV.</span>, the "heretic king." Besides this lady,<br/>
we learn from the tablets that Amenophis married at least<br/>
five other ladies from Mesopotamia, viz., a sister and two<br/>
daughters of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kallimma-Sin</span>, King of Karaduniyash, and a<br/>
sister and daughter of Tushratta, King of Mitani; but none<br/>
of these ladies was acknowledged "Queen of Egypt." In<br/>
the time of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span>, a Mesopotamian princess was<br/>
honoured by marriage with the King of Egypt, but when<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kallimma-Sin </span>wished to marry an Egyptian princess, Amenophis replied haughtily, "the daughter of the King of the<br/>
land of Egypt hath never been given to a nobody "; yet in<br/>
the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khu-en-aten </span>we learn that an Egyptian princess<br/>
was given in marriage to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Burraburiyash</span>, King of Karaduniyash, a proof that the Egyptian power was waning in<br/>
Mesopotamia. The greater number of the tablets are<br/>
addressed to "the King of Egypt," either Amenophis III.<br/>
or his son Amenophis IV., and they reveal a state of disorganization and rebellion in the Egyptian dependencies<br/>
in Palestine and Syria which cannot be understood unless<br/>
we assume that for some years before the death of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenophis </span>III. the Semitic peoples of Western Asia were <span style="color: #0000FF;">being<br/>
</span>encouraged to reject the rule of the Egyptians by their<br/>
kinsfolk living in Egypt.<br/>
