<span>154 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
by Sir Francis Grenfell, and when the further contemplated<br/>
precautions are taken the Museum will be as safe from fire<br/>
as any building, half <span style="color: #0000FF;">French</span>, half Oriental, can be in the<br/>
East. It cannot however be doubted that a specially arranged <span style="color: #ff0000;">fire-proof </span>building constructed in some suitable<br/>
open place in Cairo would more effectually protect the<br/>
priceless relics of a great early civilization. Here the anti<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">quities </span>would be better guarded in every way, and it is<br/>
probable that the income which would be derived from the<br/>
increased number of visits made by <span style="color: #0000FF;">tourists</span>, would in a short<br/>
time form an important contribution towards the original<br/>
outlay.<br/>
<br/>
The decision to remove the antiquities from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btikil.r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t0<br/>
</span>Gizeh was carried out in 1889 in the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">praiseworthy<br/>
</span>manner. Gangs of men toiled from morning till night, and<br/>
behind the trucks or carts containing the most precious<br/>
objects M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grébaut</span>, the director of the Museum, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch </span>Bey might be seen directing the workmen. During<br/>
the hottest months of the summer and during the hottest<br/>
hours of the day, under an exposure to the sun such as the<br/>
ancient Coptic monks considered to be an adequate preparation for the lake of fire in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gehenna</span>, the work went on<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>nothing of value was injured or broken, and the authorities<br/>
declare that no object was lost. When the antiquities had<br/>
been moved from <span style="color: #ff0000;">BC1lils</span>, every lover of Egyptian art hoped<br/>
that the statues, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, which had been acquired <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the<br/>
last seven or eight years would be incorporated with those<br/>
with which he was familiar, that each object would be<br/>
numbered, that brief labels would <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>added, and that a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chronological </span>arrangement would be attempted. Owing to<br/>
ill-health, however, M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grébaut </span>failed to continue the good<br/>
work which he had begun, and for a long period but little<br/>
new was done. Early in the year 1892 it was reported that<br/>
M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grébaut </span>was about to resign, and for once rumour was<br/>
correct. M. Grébaut was succeeded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Jacques de<br/>
<br/>
