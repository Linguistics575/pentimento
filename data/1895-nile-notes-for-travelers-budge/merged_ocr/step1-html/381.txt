stone and cement. The whole of the sand and broken<br/>
stones which had become piled up in front of the entrance<br/>
to the small chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-opened </span>by Mr. McCallum some<br/>
years ago was cleared away, and any dangerous break in the<br/>
rock was carefully repaired. All lovers of Egypt will<br/>
rejoice at the excellent way in which Captain Johnstone<br/>
has performed his difficult task, and we may now hope<br/>
that it will not be long before the repairs which are urgently<br/>
needed by temples and other buildings in other parts of<br/>
Egypt are undertaken by the able officers of the Royal<br/>
Engineers.<br/>
<br/>
The village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Halfah, on the east bank of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, 802 miles from Cairo, marks the site of a part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">trict </span>called <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Je</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">63 </span>Buhen in the hieroglyphic inscription, where, as at <span style="color: #ff0000;">DÃ©rr </span>and Ibrim, the god Harmachis was<br/>
worshipped. On the plain to the east of the village some<br/>
interesting flint weapons have been found, and a few miles<br/>
distant are the fossil remains of a forest. On the western<br/>
bank of the river, a little further south, are the remains of<br/>
a temple which, if not actually built, was certainly restored<br/>
by Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>was repaired and added to by<br/>
later kings of Egypt, but it seems to have fallen into disuse soon after the Romans gained possession of Egypt.<br/>
The excavations recently carried out here by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lieut</span>. H. G.<br/>
Lyons, R.E., have brought to light the ruins of temples<br/>
built by a king of the XIIth dynasty and Thothmes IV.<br/>
A few miles south of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Halfah </span>begins the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">cataract</span>, a splendid view of which can be obtained from the<br/>
now famous rock of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abt1y'r </span>on the west bank of the river.<br/>
Nearly every traveller who has visited <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abil </span>Simbel has been<br/>
to this rock and inscribed his name upon it; the result is<br/>
an interesting collection of names and dates, the like of<br/>
which probably exists nowhere else.<br/>
