<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kiwi </span>49<br/>
<br/>
monuments, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>now washed by the waters of the inundation<br/>
and imbedded to a certain height in a stratum of alluvial<br/>
soil which has been deposited around their base. The land<br/>
about Elephantine and at Thebes has been raised about<br/>
nine feet in 1,700 years. The usual rise of the river at<br/>
Cairo is <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>feet, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hebes </span>thirty-eight feet, and at<br/>
Aswan forty-five feet. The average rate of the current is<br/>
about three miles per hour. As the river bed rises higher<br/>
and higher the amount of land covered by the waters of the<br/>
inundation grows more and more. It is estimated that, if<br/>
all the land thus watered were thoroughly cultivated, Egypt<br/>
would, for its size, be one of the richest countries in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>The ancient Egyptians fully recognized how very<br/>
much they owed to the Nile, and, in their hymns, they<br/>
thank the Nile-god in appropriate and grateful terms.<br/>
Statues of the god are painted green and red, which<br/>
colours are supposed to represent <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>the colour of the<br/>
river in June, when it is a bright green, before the inundation<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and 2. the ruddy hue which its waters have when<br/>
charged with the red mud brought down from the Abyssinian<br/>
mountains.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span>It is greatly to be hoped that Mr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Garstin </span>will be enabled to<br/>
increase the scope of the valuable work in the Irrigation Department<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>Sir Colin <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scott </span>Moncrieff began, and to gradually carry out the<br/>
works <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>bring into cultivation those districts which are<br/>
now a wilderness.<br/>
