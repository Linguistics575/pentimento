</span>Over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">doorisa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">statue </span>of Harmachis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>ss' and on each<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Q<br/>
<br/>
</span>side of him is a figure of the king offering. Each of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'U<br/>
<br/>
</span>the four colossi had the name of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>inscribed<br/>
upon each shoulder and breast. On the leg of one of<br/>
these are several interesting Greek inscriptions, which were<br/>
thought to have been written by the Egyptian troops who<br/>
marched into Ethiopia in the days of Psammetichus I.<br/>
<br/>
The interior of the temple consists of a large hall, in<br/>
which are eight columns with large figures of Osiris about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">17 </span>feet high upon them, and from which eight chambers<br/>
open; a second hall having four square <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and a<br/>
third hall, without pillars, from which open three chambers.<br/>
In the centre chamber are an altar and four seated figures,<br/>
viz., Harmachis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptah</span>; the<br/>
first <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>are coloured red, the third blue, and the fourth<br/>
white. In the sculptures on the walls Rameses is seen<br/>
offering to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amen-Ra</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sechet</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, Amsu, Thoth,<br/>
and other deities; a list of his children occurs, and many<br/>
small scenes of considerable importance. The subjects<br/>
of the larger scenes are, as was to be expected, representations of the principal events in the victorious battles<br/>
of the great king, in which he appears putting his foes<br/>
to death with the weapons which Harmachis has given<br/>
to him. The accompanying hieroglyphics describe these<br/>
scenes with terse accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting inscriptions at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Simbel </span>is<br/>
that found on a slab, which states that in the fifth year<br/>
of the reign of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, his majesty was in the land of<br/>
T'ah, not far from Kadesh on the Orontes. The outposts<br/>
kept a sharp look-out, and when the army came to the south<br/>
of the town <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shabttm</span>, two of the spies of the Shasu came<br/>
