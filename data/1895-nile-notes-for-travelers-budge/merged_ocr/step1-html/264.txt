<span>240 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
whatever glory it then possessed, and became merely the<br/>
chief provincial city of Egypt. During the reign of Theodosius, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>savage attack, the result of his edict, was made<br/>
upon its temples and buildings by the Christians, and a few<br/>
hundred years later the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muhammadans </span>carried the stones,<br/>
which once formed them, across the river to serve as building materials for their houses and mosques<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The circuit<br/>
of the ancient city, according to Diodorus, was <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>stadia,<br/>

THE COLOSSAL STATUE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>RAMESES II.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>statue was discovered by Messrs.<br/>
Caviglia and Sloane in 1820, and was presented by them to<br/>
the British Museum. On account of its weight and the<br/>
lack of public interest in such matters, it lay near the road<br/>
leading from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrash√©n </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mithahineh</span>, and little by little<br/>
became nearly covered with the annual deposit <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span>mud<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>during the inundation the greater part of it was covered<br/>
by the waters of the Nile. During the winter of 1886-87 Sir<br/>
Frederick Stephenson collected a sum of money in Cairo<br/>
for the purpose of lifting it out of the hollow in which it<br/>
<br/>
forth Apis. This calf, which is called Apis, has the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">marks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
</span>it is black, and has a square spot of white on the forehead; and on the<br/>
back the figure of an eagle<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and in the tail double hairs; and on the<br/>
tongue a beetle. When the priests brought Apis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses</span>, like one<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span>out of his senses, drew his dagger, meaning to strike the belly of<br/>
Apis, but hit the thigh; then falling into a fit of laughter, he said to<br/>
the priests,<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ye </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blackheads</span>, are there such gods as these, consisting<br/>
of blood and flesh, and sensible to <span style="color: #0000FF;">steel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P </span>This, truly, is a god worthy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Egyptians. But you shall not mock me with impunity.' Having<br/>
spoken thus, he commanded those whose business it was, to scourge the<br/>
priests, and to kill all the Egyptians whom they should find feasting.<br/>
... But Apis, being wounded in the thigh, lay and languished in the<br/>
temple; and at <span style="color: #0000FF;">length</span>, when he had died of the wound, the priests<br/>
buried him without the knowledge of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses</span>."--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Herodotus</span>, III.<br/>
