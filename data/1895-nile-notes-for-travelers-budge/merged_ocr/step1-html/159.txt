<span>TANIS. 135<br/>
<br/>
Under the Roman Empire Tanis still held a high<br/>
position among the towns of the Delta, and the Egyptians<br/>
considered it of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">importance </span>to make it an episcopal see. In the list of the bishops who were present at<br/>
the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451), the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofApollonius</span>, Bishop <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanis</span>, is found. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunis </span>must not be confounded with Tennis, the sea-port town which grew and<br/>
increased in importance <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'l'anis </span>declined; and it is difficult<br/>
to understand <span style="color: #0000FF;">why'1'anis </span>should have dwindled away,<br/>
considering that Arab writers have described its climate as<br/>
being most salubrious, and its winter like summer. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Water<br/>
</span>was said to flow there at all times, and the inhabitants could<br/>
water their gardens at their will; no place in all Egypt, save<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayytlm</span>, could be compared with it for fertility, and for<br/>
the beauty of its gardens and vines. In the sixth century<br/>
of our era the sea <span style="color: #0000FF;">invaded </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large portion of Tanis territory,<br/>
and it went on encroaching each year little by little, until all<br/>
its villages were submerged. The inhabitants removed their<br/>
dead to Tennis, and established themselves there; Tennis<br/>
was evacuated by its inhabitants A.D. 1192, and the town<br/>
itself was <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed </span>A.D. 1226.<br/>
