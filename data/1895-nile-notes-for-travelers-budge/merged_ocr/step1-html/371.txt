Mr. Bonomi's notes, are now set up on the walls in the<br/>
Fourth Egyptian Room in the British Museum (Northern<br/>
Gallery), and are the only evidences extant of the former<br/>
beauty of this little rock-hewn temple, for nearly every trace<br/>
of colour has vanished from the walls. The scenes on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">battle-field </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>of great interest.<br/>

Rameses II. in honour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptah</span>, Hathor, and Aneq<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
