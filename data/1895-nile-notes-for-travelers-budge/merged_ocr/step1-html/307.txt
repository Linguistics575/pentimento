gates; but that there were many large porches to the<br/>
temples, whence the city was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hecatompyhts</span>, a hundred<br/>
gates, for many gates<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>yet that it was certain they had in it<br/>
20,000 chariots of war; for there were a hundred stables all<br/>
along the river from Memphis to Thebes towards Lybia,<br/>
each of which was capable to hold two hundred horses, the<br/>
marks and signs of which are visible at this day. And we<br/>
have it related, that not only this king, but the succeeding<br/>
princes from time to time, made it their business to beautify<br/>
this city<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for that there was no city under the sun so<br/>
adorned with so many and stately monuments of gold, silver,<br/>
and ivory, and multitudes of colossi and obelisks, cut out of<br/>
one entire stone. For there were there four temples built,<br/>
for beauty and greatness to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>admired, the most ancient of<br/>
which was in circuit thirteen furlongs (about two miles), and<br/>
five and forty cubits high, and had a wall twenty-four feet<br/>
broad. The ornaments of this temple were suitable to its<br/>
magnificence, both for cost and workmanship. The fabric<br/>
hath continued to our time, but the silver and the gold, and<br/>
ornaments of ivory and precious stones were carried away<br/>
by the Persians when Cambyses burnt the temples of<br/>
Egypt.... There, they say, are the wonderful sepulchres<br/>
of the ancient kings, which for state and grandeur far<br/>
exceed all that posterity can attain unto at this day. The<br/>
Egyptian priests say that in their sacred registers there are<br/>
47 of these sepulchres; but in the reign of Ptolemy Lagus<br/>
there remained only 17, many of which were ruined and<br/>
destroyed when I myself came into those parts." (Bk. <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>

Strabo, who visited Thebes about B.C. 24, says<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>--" <span style="color: #0000FF;">Next<br/>

her hundred gates, through each of which issue 200 men,<br/>
with horses and chariots,' according to Homer, who<br/>
mentions also its wealth<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>not all the wealth the palaces ot<br/>
Egyptian Thebes contain.' Other writers use the same<br/>
