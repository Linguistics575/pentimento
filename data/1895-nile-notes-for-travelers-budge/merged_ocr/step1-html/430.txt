the entrance of a large tomb. The rubbish was untouched;<br/>
the slope had evidently been made for a large stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin</span>;<br/>
beyond the entrance he found a long sloping shaft which<br/>
ended in a large chamber. The plain coffin containing<br/>
bones which he found therein had never been intended for<br/>
such a tomb, and his conclusion is that the body for whom<br/>
the tomb was made was never laid in it. It may be that<br/>
it was prepared for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witshepset </span>herself.<br/>
<br/>
During the last days of the excavations at DÃ©r el-Bahari,<br/>
M. Naville's workmen came upon a very interesting<br/>
"foundation deposit" which they discovered in a small<br/>
rock-hewn pit. It consisted of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>wooden hoes, four<br/>
bronze slabs, a hatchet, a knife, eight wooden models of<br/>
adzes, eight wooden adzes with bronze blades, fifty wooden<br/>
models of an implement of unknown use, ten pots of<br/>
alabaster, and ten baskets; above these were a few common<br/>
earthenware pots, and over all were some mats. All the<br/>
objects bear the same inscription, i.e., the prenomen and<br/>
titles of queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wttshepset</span>.<br/>

TEMPLE OF MUT.<br/>
<br/>
In the Temple of Mut, by permission of the authorities,<br/>
Miss Margaret Benson carried out some excavations, and<br/>
in the first court discovered an almost perfect black<br/>
granite squatting statue of a scribe called Amen-em-bat.<br/>
On the front were several lines of well cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics<br/>
</span>containing prayers to the various great gods of Thebes,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>on it of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>show that the<br/>
deceased flourished during the first half of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XVIIIth<br/>
</span>dynasty, about B.C. 1550. The statue is about two feet<br/>
high, and probably stood in a prominent place in the<br/>
temple with which he was associated. This site had been<br/>
dug through more than once by Mariette and by natives,<br/>
and Miss Benson's "<span style="color: #ff0000;">find</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>indicates that the neighbouring<br/>
