<span>202 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
after a multitude of evolutions and developments' which<br/>
came forth from my mouth (or at my command). There<br/>
was no heaven, there was no earth, animals which move<br/>
upon the earth and reptiles existed not at all in that place<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>I constructed their forms out of the inert mass of watery<br/>
matter. I found no place there where I could stand. By<br/>
the strength which was in my will I laid the foundation<br/>
[ <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthings </span>] in the form of the god Shu [ see page 116 ], <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>created for them every attribute which they have. I alone<br/>
existed, for I had not as yet made Shu <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>emanate from me,<br/>
and I had not ejected the spittle which became the god<br/>
Tefnut; there existed none other to work with me. By<br/>
my own will I laid the foundations of all things, and the<br/>
evolutions of the things, and the evolutions which took<br/>
place from the evolutions of their births which took<br/>
place through the evolutions of their offspring, became<br/>
multiplied. My shadow was united with me, and I<br/>
produced Shu and Tefnut from the emanations of my<br/>
body,...... thus from being one god I became three<br/>
gods...<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.. </span>I gathered together my members and wept<br/>
over them, and men and women sprang into existence from<br/>
the tears which fell from my eye." Scarabs may be divided<br/>
into three <span style="color: #ff0000;">classes'.</span>--r. Funereal <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabs</span>; 2. Scarabs worn for<br/>
ornament; 3. Historical scarabs. Of funereal scarabs<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>The duplicate copy of this chapter reads, "I developed myself<br/>
from the primeval matter which I made. My name is Osiris, the germ<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>primeval matter. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>worked my will to its full extent in this<br/>
earth, I have spread abroad and <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>it...... I uttered my name <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>a word of power, from my own mouth, and I straightway developed<br/>
myself by <span style="color: #0000FF;">evolutions</span>. I evolved myself under the form of the<br/>
evolutions of the god Khepera, and I developed myself out of the<br/>
primeval matter which has evolved multitudes of evolutions from the<br/>
beginning <span style="color: #0000FF;">oftime</span>. Nothing existed on this earth <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>me ], I made<br/>
all things. There was none other who worked with me at that time.<br/>
I made all evolutions by means of that soul which I raised up there<br/>
from inertness <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>watery matter."<br/>
