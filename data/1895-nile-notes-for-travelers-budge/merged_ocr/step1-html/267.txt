opened in 1881. The Arabs call it the "Prison Pyramid,"<br/>
because local tradition says that it is built near the ruins of<br/>
the prison where Joseph the patriarch was confined. Its<br/>
actual height is about 59 feet; the length of each side at the<br/>
base is 210 feet, and the platform at the top is about<br/>
50 feet. The arrangement of the chambers and passages<br/>
and the plan of construction followed is almost identical<br/>
with that of the pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Units</span>. This pyramid was<br/>
broken into in ancient days, and two of the walls of the<br/>
sarcophagus chamber have literally been smashed to pieces<br/>
by the hammer blows of those who expected to find<br/>
treasure inside them. The inscriptions, painted in green<br/>
upon the walls, have the same subject matter as those<br/>
inscribed upon the walls of the chambers of the pyramid of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Units</span>. According to Manetho, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Teta</span>, the first king of the<br/>
VIth dynasty, reigned about fifty years, and was murdered<br/>
by one of his guards.<br/>

It is the worst preserved of these pyramids, and has suffered<br/>
most at the hands of the spoilers, probably because having<br/>
been constructed with stones which were taken from tombs<br/>
ancient already in those days, instead of stones fresh from<br/>
the quarry, it was more easily injured. The granite<br/>
sarcophagus was broken to take out the mummy, fragments<br/>
