LUXOR (<span style="color: #0000FF;">EL-KUSUR</span>) AND THEBES.<br/>
<br/>
Luxor, 450 miles from Cairo, on the east bank of the<br/>
river, is a small town with a few thousand inhabitants, and<br/>
owes its importance to the fact that it is situated close<br/>
to the ruins of the temples of the ancient city of Thebes.<br/>
The name Luxor is a corruption of the Arabic name of the<br/>
place, <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Fu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, which means "the palaces." Ancient<br/>
Thebes stood on both sides of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, and was generally<br/>
<br/>
called in hieroglyphics ft, Uast; that part of the city<br/>
<br/>
which was situated on the east bank of the river, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>included the temples of Karnak and Luxor, appears to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>been called <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">j </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Apet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>whence the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic'T </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me<br/>
</span>and the name Thebes have been derived. The cuneiform<br/>
inscriptions and Hebrew Scriptures call it No (Ezek. xxx. 14)<br/>
and No-Amont (Nahum iii. 8), and the Greek and Roman<br/>
writers Diospolis Magna. When or by whom Thebes was<br/>
founded it is impossible to say. Diodorus says that it is the<br/>
most ancient city of Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>some say that, like Memphis,<br/>
it was founded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menes</span>, and others, that it was a colony<br/>
from Memphis. It is certain, however, that it did not<br/>
become a city of the first importance until after the decay<br/>
of Memphis, and as the progress of Egyptian civilization<br/>
was from north to south, this is only what was <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>expected.<br/>
During the early dynasties no mention is made of Thebes,<br/>
but we know that as early as the XIIth dynasty some<br/>
kings were buried there.<br/>
<br/>
The spot on which ancient Thebes stood is so<br/>
admirably adapted for the site of a great city, that it<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">iF </span>Ae., "throne city."<br/>
