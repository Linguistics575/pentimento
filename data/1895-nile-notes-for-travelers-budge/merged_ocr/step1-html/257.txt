<br/>
THE SPHINX.<br/>
<br/>
The age of the Sphinx is unknown, and few of the facts<br/>
connected with its history have come down to these days.<br/>
Some years ago it was generally believed to have been<br/>
made during the rule of the kings of the Middle Empire over<br/>
Egypt, but when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele </span>which recorded the repairs made<br/>
in the temple of the Sphinx by Thothmes IV., B.C. 1533,<br/>
came to light, it became certain that it was the work of one<br/>
of the kings of the Ancient Empire. The stele records that<br/>
one day during an after-dinner sleep, Harmachis appeared to<br/>
Thothmes IV., and promised to bestow upon him the crown<br/>
of Egypt if he would dig his image, i.e., the Sphinx, out of<br/>
the sand. At the end of the inscription part of the name<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cha-f-Ra </span>or Chephren appears, and hence some have<br/>
thought that this king was the maker of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinx </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span>as the<br/>
statue of Chephren was subsequently found in the temple<br/>
close by, this theory was generally adopted. An inscription<br/>
found by Mariette near one of the pyramids to the east of<br/>
the pyramid of Cheops shows that the Sphinx existed in<br/>
the time of Chufu or Cheops. The Egyptians called <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Sphinx <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bsss</span>, and he represented the god Harmachis,<br/>
<br/>
i.e., <span style="color: #0000FF;">f.leru-em-chut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Is</span>, E <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sh</span>, "Horus in the horizon," or<br/>
the rising sun, the conqueror of darkness, the god of the<br/>
morning. On the tablet erected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IV.</span>, Harmachis says that he gave <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>and dominion to Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.</span>,<br/>
and he promises to give the same good gifts to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">successor </span>Thothmes IV. The discovery of the steps which led<br/>
up to the Sphinx, a smaller Sphinx, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>open temple,<br/>
etc., was made by Caviglia, who first excavated this monument<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>within the last few years very extensive excavations<br/>
have been made round it by the Egyptian Government, and<br/>
several hitherto unseen parts of it have been brought to<br/>
view. The Sphinx is hewn out of the living rock, but pieces<br/>
of stone have been added where <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the body is<br/>
