<br/>
found himself surrounded by the enemy, and completely<br/>
isolated from his own troops. He called upon his father<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amen-Ra </span>to help him, and then addressed himself to a<br/>
. slaughter of all those that came in his way, and his prowess<br/>
was so great that the enemy fell in heaps, one over the<br/>
other, into the waters of the Orontes. He was quite alone,<br/>
and not one of his soldiers or horsemen came near him<br/>
to help him. It was only with great difficulty he succeeded<br/>
in cutting his way through the ranks of the enemy. At the<br/>
end of the inscription he says, "Every thing that my<br/>
majesty has stated, that did I in the presence of my<br/>
soldiers and horsemen." This <span style="color: #0000FF;">event </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the battle of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>against the Cheta was made the subject of an<br/>
interesting poem Joy Pen-ta-urt; this composition was considered worthy to be inscribed upon papyri, and upon the<br/>
walls of the temples which Rameses built.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the south of the Great Temple is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small<br/>
building of the same date, which was used in connexion<br/>
with the services, and on the walls of which are some<br/>
interesting scenes. It was re-opened a few years ago by<br/>
Mr. McCallum, Miss Edwards and party.<br/>
<br/>
Early in the year 1892, Capt. J. H. L. E. Johnstone, R.E., together with a detachment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">noncommissioned </span>officers and men, arrived at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abtl-Simbel </span>with a<br/>
view of carrying out certain repairs to the face and side<br/>
of the great rock temple. They began by clearing away<br/>
several enormous masses of overhanging rock which, had<br/>
they fallen in, must have <span style="color: #0000FF;">inflicted </span>very great damage on<br/>
the colossal statues below; and having broken them into<br/>
smaller pieces, Captain Johnstone used them for building<br/>
two walls at the head of <span style="color: #0000FF;">thc </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">valley </span>to prevent the drift sand<br/>
from burying the temple again, and for making a hard,<br/>
stone slope. The cynocephali which form the ornament<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the cornice were carefully repaired and strengthened,<br/>
and the original rock was in many places built up with<br/>
