In the standard and wall cases are arranged a very fine<br/>
collection of figures of the gods of Egypt, and of the<br/>
animals, birds, and reptiles, sacred to them. These interesting objects are made of glazed <span style="color: #0000FF;">faience</span>, hard stone,<br/>
bronze, glass, etc., and among them are some splendid<br/>
specimens of excellent design and workmanship. Figures<br/>
of gods are found among the ruins of houses, and in tombs<br/>
and temples. Those found in the ruins were either placed<br/>
in shrines, and represented the gods worshipped by the<br/>
family, or were buried in niches in the walls, and were<br/>
supposed to be able to protect the family by their supernatural influence. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">thought </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the Egyptians believed<br/>
that the gods inhabited the statues placed in the temples<br/>
in their honour. Figures of gods were also buried in the<br/>
sand round about houses and tanks with the view of<br/>
guarding them from the influences of <span style="color: #0000FF;">demons </span>The principal gods exhibited in this room are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>,<br/>
