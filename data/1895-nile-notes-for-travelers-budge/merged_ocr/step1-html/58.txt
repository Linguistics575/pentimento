<span>34 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
of the pictures on the tombs is supported and confirmed by<br/>
the skulls and bones of mummies which anthropologists have<br/>
examined and measured during the last few years; hence<br/>
all attempts to prove that the Egyptian is of negro origin<br/>
are overthrown at the outset by facts which cannot be controverted. In cases where the Egyptians intermarried with<br/>
people of Semitic origin, we find aquiline noses.' One of<br/>
the most remarkable things connected with the Egyptians of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">today </span>is the fact that a very large number of them have<br/>
reproduced, without the slightest alteration, many of the<br/>
personal features of their ancestors who lived seven<br/>
thousand years ago. The traveller is often accompanied<br/>
on a visit to a tomb of the Ancient Empire by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>modern<br/>
Egyptian who, in his attitudes, form, and face, is a veritable<br/>
reproduction of the hereditary nobleman who built the tomb<br/>
which he is examining. It may be that no invading race<br/>
has ever found itself physically able to reproduce persistently its own characteristics for any important length of<br/>
time, or it may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>that the absorption of such races by<br/>
intermarriage with the natives, together with the influence<br/>

* A very good example of this is seen in the black granite head of<br/>
the statue of Osorkon 11., presented to the British Museum (No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1063</span>)<br/>
by the Committee of the Egypt Exploration Fund. The lower part<br/>
of the nose is broken away, but enough of the upper part remains to<br/>
show what was its original angle. It was confidently asserted that this<br/>
head belonged to a statue of one of the so-called Hyksos kings, but the<br/>
assertion was not supported by any trustworthy evidence. The face<br/>
and features are those of a man whose ancestors were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semites </span>and<br/>
Egyptians, and men with similar <span style="color: #0000FF;">countenance</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>are to be seen in the<br/>
desert to the south-east of Palestine to this day. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aclinching </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">proofthat<br/>
</span>the statue is not that <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span>king was brought forward by Prof.<br/>
Lanzone of Turin, who, in 1890, had in his possession a small statue<br/>
of Osorkon <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, having precisely the same face and features. The<br/>
XXIInd dynasty, to which this king belonged, were Semites, as their<br/>
names show, and they were always regarded by the Egyptians as<br/>
foreigners, and A,, the determinative of a man from <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>foreign<br/>
<br/>
country, was placed <span style="color: #0000FF;">after </span>each of their names.<br/>
