bodies of their ancestors in splendid chambers, and that<br/>
they had the opportunity of contemplating the faces of those<br/>
who died before their time. In some particulars he is right,<br/>
and in others wrong. He lived too late (about B.C. 40) to<br/>
know what the well-made Theban mummies were like, and<br/>
his experience therefore would only have <span style="color: #ff0000;">familiarised </span>him<br/>
with the Egypto-Roman mummies, in which the limbs were<br/>
bandaged separately, and the contour of their faces, much<br/>
blunted, was to be seen through the thin and tightly drawn<br/>
bandages which covered the face. In such examples the<br/>
features of the face can be clearly distinguished underneath<br/>
the bandages.<br/>
<br/>
An examination of Egyptian mummies will show that<br/>
the accounts given by Herodotus and Diodorus are generally<br/>
correct, for mummies with and without ventral incisions are<br/>
found, and some are preserved by means of balsams and<br/>
gums, and others by bitumen and <span style="color: #0000FF;">natron</span>. The skulls of<br/>
mummies which may be seen by hundreds in caves and pits<br/>
at Thebes contain absolutely nothing, a fact which proves<br/>
that the embalmers were able not only to remove the brain,<br/>
but also to take out the membranes without injuring or<br/>
breaking the nose in any way. The heads of mummies are<br/>
found, at times, to be filled with bitumen, linen rags, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>resin. The bodies which have been filled with <span style="color: #0000FF;">resin </span>or<br/>
some such substance are <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>greenish colour, and the skin<br/>
has the appearance of being tanned. Such mummies, when<br/>
unrolled, perish rapidly and break easily. Usually, however, the resin and aromatic gum process is favourable to<br/>
the preservation of the teeth and hair. Bodies from which<br/>
the intestines have been removed and which have been<br/>
preserved by being filled with bitumen, are quite black and<br/>
hard. The features are preserved intact, but the body is<br/>
heavy and unfair to look upon. The bitumen penetrates the<br/>
bones so completely that it is sometimes difficult to <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tinguish </span>what is bone and what is bitumen. The arms,<br/>
