<br/>
It appears that before the actual building <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pyramid was<br/>
begun a suitable rocky site was chosen and cleared, a mass<br/>
of rock if possible being left in the middle of the area to<br/>
form the core of the building. The chambers and the<br/>
galleries leading to them were next planned and excavated.<br/>
Around the core <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>truncated pyramid building was made,<br/>
the angles of which were filled up with blocks of stone.<br/>
Layer after layer of stone was then built around the work,<br/>
which grew larger and larger until it was finished. Dr.<br/>
Lepsius thought that when a king ascended the throne, he<br/>
built for himself a small but complete <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-pyramid</span>, and<br/>
that a fresh coating of stone was built around it every year<br/>
that he reigned<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and that when he died the sides of the<br/>
pyramids were like long flights of steps, which his successor<br/>
filled up with right-angled triangular blocks of stone. The<br/>
door of the pyramid was walled up after the body of its<br/>
builder had been laid in it, and thus remained a finished<br/>
tomb. The explanation of Dr. Lepsius may not be correct,<br/>
but at least it answers satisfactorily more objections than do<br/>
the views of other theorists on this matter. It has been<br/>
pointed out that near the core of the pyramid the work is<br/>
more carefully executed than near the exterior, that is to<br/>
say, as the time for the king's death approached the work<br/>
was more hurriedly performed.<br/>
<br/>
During the investigations made by Lepsius in and about<br/>
the pyramid area, he found the remains of about seventyfive pyramids, and noticed that they were always built in<br/>
groups.<br/>

The pyramids of Gizeh were opened by the Persians<br/>
during the fifth and fourth centuries before Christ; it is<br/>
