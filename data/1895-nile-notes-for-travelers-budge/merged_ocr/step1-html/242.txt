<br/>
and later, poverty or laziness made people consider the<br/>
interior parts of the body to be sufficiently well guarded if<br/>
figures of these genii were roughly drawn on the linen<br/>
bandages. It was sometimes customary to lay a set of<br/>
these figures, made of porcelain or bead-work, upon the<br/>
chest of the mummy.<br/>
<br/>
It was the fashion some years ago to state in books of<br/>
history that the ancient Egyptian was a negro, and some<br/>
distinguished historians still make this statement, notwithstanding Prof. Owen's distinct utterance, "taking the sum<br/>
of the correspondence notable in collections of skulls from<br/>
Egyptian graveyards as a probable indication of the hypothetical primitive race originating the civilised conditions of<br/>
cranial departure from the skull-character of such race, that<br/>
race was certainly not of the Australoid type, is more suggestive of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>northern Nubian or Berber basis. But such<br/>
suggestive characters may be due to intercourse <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'admixture</span>' at periods later than [ the ] XIIIth dynasty; they are<br/>
not present, or in a much less degree, in the skulls, features,<br/>
and physiognomies <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">individuals </span>of from the IIIrd to the<br/>

vol. iv., p. 239. The most important scientific examinations of the<br/>
skeletons of mummified Egyptians in England have been made by the<br/>
late Sir <span style="color: #0000FF;">Richard </span>Owen, Prof. Sir <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>Flower, and Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Macalister </span>of<br/>
Cambridge. Within the last few years I have collected for this <span style="color: #ff0000;">lastnamed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sttvttttt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">beween </span>six and seven hundred Egyptian skulls from<br/>
Thebes and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aswiin </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene</span>). The greater part of these reached England<br/>
in excellent condition, and they are now being measured and examined<br/>
by craniological experts. On some of them the skin of the face and<br/>
neck remains in a perfect condition, and Prof. Macalister has found<br/>
a means whereby he is able to make these dry and withered faces<br/>
fill out and resume something of the appearance which they wore in<br/>
life<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>As all these skulls are of great antiquity, and belonged to <span style="color: #ff0000;">highclass </span>Egyptians, priests, and others, the results of his work may be<br/>
anticipated with great interest by both the ethnographist and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptologist</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
