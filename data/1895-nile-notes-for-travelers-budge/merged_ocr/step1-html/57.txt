<span>THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. 33<br/>
<br/>
Bible<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>this word may be compared with the Coptic<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">RHAAC</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">XHLU</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The children of Ham are<br/>
said to be Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. The second<br/>
of these, Misraim, is the name given to Egypt by the<br/>
Hebrews. The dual form of the word, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">means </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>the<br/>
double Mis.sor," probably has reference to the "two lands "<br/>
(in Egypt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1=</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.il'.iz'il=z</span>',), over which the Egyptian kings, in their<br/>
inscriptions, proclaimed their rule. The descendants <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Cush are represented on the monuments by the inhabitants<br/>
of Nubia and the negro tribes which live to the south of<br/>
that country. In the earliest times the descendants of Cush<br/>
appear to have had the same religion as the Egyptians. The<br/>
Put of the Bible is thought by some to be represented by<br/>
the land of Punt, or spice-land, of the monuments. The<br/>
people of Punt appear to have dwelt on both sides of the<br/>
Red Sea to the south of Egypt and on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Somali </span>coast,<br/>
and as far back as B.C. 2500 a large trade was carried<br/>
on between them and the Egyptians; it is thought that the<br/>
Egyptians regarded them as <span style="color: #0000FF;">kinsmen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The aboriginal<br/>
inhabitants of Phoenicia were probably the kinsfolk of the<br/>
descendants of Misraim, called by the Bible Canaanites.<br/>
Diodorus and some other classical authorities tell us that<br/>
Egypt was colonized from Ethiopia<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for this view, however,<br/>
there is no support. The civilization, religion, art of<br/>
building, etc., of the Ethiopians are all of Egyptian origin,<br/>
and in this, as in so many other points relating to the<br/>
history of Egypt, the Greeks were either misinformed, or<br/>
they misunderstood what they were told.<br/>
<br/>
An examination of the painted representations of the<br/>
Egyptians by native artists shows us that the pure Egyptian<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">slender </span>make, with broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">shoulders</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>hands and feet,<br/>
and sinewy legs and arms. His forehead was high, his chin<br/>
square, his eyes large, his cheeks full, his mouth wide, his lips<br/>
full, and his nose short and rounded. His jaws protruded<br/>
slightly, and his hair was smooth and fine<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The evidence<br/>
