corded in the Bible, for it must have happened some<br/>
two thousand years before Joseph could have been in<br/>
Egypt; but this remarkable inscription proves that from<br/>
time immemorial the people of Egypt have suffered from<br/>

bank of the river, is prettily situated, and worth a visit.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">PHILE</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>is the name given by the Greeks and Romans to<br/>
the smaller of two islands situated at the head of the first<br/>
cataract, about six miles above <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan</span>; the larger one is<br/>
called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biggeh</span>. Inscriptions found on rocks in the larger<br/>
island show that as far back as the time of Amenophis <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span>.<br/>
an Egyptian temple stood here; the greater number of<br/>
these inscriptions were cut by Egyptian officials on their<br/>
way to and from Nubia. The smaller island, to which the<br/>
name Philae is <span style="color: #0000FF;">generally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confined</span>, consists of a granite rock,<br/>
the sides of which, having been scarped, have had walls<br/>
built on them; it measures 417 yards long and 135 <span style="color: #ff0000;">yards<br/>
</span>wide. The name of this island in Egyptian was d? s <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P-iia-lcq</span>, Coptic <span style="color: #0000FF;">mhax</span>, i.e.,'the frontier.' The monuments on this island are numerous and interesting, but they<br/>
belong to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>comparatively late date, none that have yet been<br/>
found being older than the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>, the last native<br/>
king of Egypt. On the south-west corner <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the remains<br/>
of the small temple which this king dedicated to Isis.<br/>
The most important ruins are those of the Temple of Isis,<br/>
which was begun by Ptolemy II. Philadelphus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsino√©</span>,<br/>
and was added to and completed by the Ptolemies and<br/>
Roman emperors who came after. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>side of the<br/>
path which led to the temple is a corridor: that on the west<br/>
has thirty-two pillars and that on the east sixteen; at<br/>
the north end of the east corridor is the so-called chapel of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Esculapius</span>, which was built by Ptolemy V. Epiphanes <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
