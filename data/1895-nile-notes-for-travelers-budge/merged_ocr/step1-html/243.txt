<br/>
and of the race to which he belonged, has been vindicated<br/>
by examinations of the skulls of Egyptian mummies.<br/>
<br/>
If the pure ancient Egyptian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>found in mummies and<br/>
represented in paintings upon the tombs, be compared with<br/>
the negro, we shall find that they are absolutely unlike in<br/>
every important particular. The negro is prognathous, but<br/>
the Egyptian is orthognathous; the bony structure of the<br/>
negro is heavier and stronger than that of the Egyptian; the<br/>
hair of the negro is crisp and woolly, while that of the<br/>
Egyptian is smooth and fine.<br/>
<br/>
It must be pointed out clearly that the Egyptians took<br/>
trouble to preserve the bodies of the dead because they<br/>
believed that after a series of terrible combats in the underworld, the soul, triumphant and pure, would once more<br/>
return to the clay in which it had formerly lived. It was<br/>
necessary, then, to preserve the body that it might be ready<br/>
for the return of the soul. It was also necessary to build<br/>
large and beautiful tombs, in order that the triumphant soul,<br/>
having <span style="color: #0000FF;">revivified </span>its ancient house of clay, might have a fit<br/>
and proper abode in which to dwell. The pyramid tombs<br/>
built by the kings of the earlier dynasties, and the vast<br/>
many-chambered sepulchres hewn in the sides of the Theban<br/>
hills during the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties, were not, in<br/>
my opinion, built to gratify the pride of their owners. They<br/>
are the outcome of the belief that the soul would <span style="color: #0000FF;">revivify<br/>
</span>the body, and they are the result of a firm assurance in the<br/>
mind of the ancient Egyptians of the truth of the doctrine<br/>
of immortality, which is the foundation of the Egyptian<br/>
religion, and which was as deeply rooted in them as the<br/>
hills are in the earth.<br/>
