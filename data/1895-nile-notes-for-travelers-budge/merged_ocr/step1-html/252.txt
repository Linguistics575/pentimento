<span>228 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
onions, and garlic, for the workmen, which the interpreter,'<br/>
as I well remember, reading the inscription, told me<br/>
amounted to 1,600 talents of silver. And if this be really<br/>
the case, how much more was probably expended in iron<br/>
tools, in bread, and in clothes for the labourers, since they<br/>
occupied in building the works the time which I mentioned,<br/>
and no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and drawing<br/>
the stones, and in forming the subterraneous excavation.<br/>
[ It is related ] that Cheops reached such a degree of infamy,<br/>
that being in want of money, he prostituted his own daughter<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brothel, and ordered her to extort, they did not say<br/>
how much; but she exacted a certain sum of money,<br/>
privately, as much as her father ordered her; and contrived<br/>
to leave a monument of herself, and asked every one that<br/>
came in to her to give her a stone towards the edifice she<br/>
designed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of these stones they said the pyramid was built<br/>
that stands in the middle of the three, before the great<br/>
pyramid, each side of which is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">plethron </span>and a half in<br/>
length." (Cary's translation.)<br/>

THE SECOND PYRAMID<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The second pyramid at Gizeh was built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chaim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>), or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren</span>, the third king of the IVth dy<br/>
nasty, <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. 3666, who called <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>A, ur. His name has<br/>
not been found inscribed upon any part of it, but the fragment<br/>
of a marble sphere inscribed with the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cha-f-Ra</span>,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>Herodotus was deceived by his interpreter, who clearly made up <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>translation of an inscription which he did not understand. William of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Baldensel</span>, who lived in the fourteenth century, tells us that the outer<br/>
coating <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>two largest pyramids was covered with a great number of<br/>
inscriptions arranged in lines. (Wiedemann, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aeg</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gesthickte</span>, p. 179.)<br/>
If the outsides were actually inscribed, the text must have been purely<br/>
religious, like those inscribed inside the pyramids of Pepi, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Total</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
</span>Unis.<br/>
