Sheri, a priest who lived during the reign of Sent, the<br/>
fifth king of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">11nd </span>dynasty, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 4000. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele<br/>

<br/>
I7. Limestone statue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ré-nefer</span>, a priest with shaven<br/>
head. <span style="color: #0000FF;">V </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">th </span>dynasty. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rom </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Salilclrah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">18</span>. Limestone statue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ré-nefer</span>, a priest wearing a<br/>
wig. These two statues are generally admitted to be the<br/>
best examples of the work of the Vth dynasty, and they<br/>
exhibit an amount of skill in sculpture which was never<br/>
surpassed at any subsequent period in the history of<br/>
Egyptian art. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saylrirah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
19. Wooden statue of a man, originally covered with a<br/>
thin layer of plaster and painted; the feet are restored.<br/>
His hair is cut short, his eyes are formed of pieces of<br/>
quartz set in bronze lids, each having a piece of bright<br/>
metal driven through it to hold it in position and to<br/>
give the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-crystal </span>pupil in front of it an animated<br/>
appearance; he wears an apron only, and holds in one<br/>
hand an unpeeled stick. It is quite evident that we<br/>
have here a portrait statue which possesses the greatest<br/>
possible <span style="color: #0000FF;">fidelity </span>to life, and a startling example of what<br/>
the ancient Egyptian artist could attain to when he shook<br/>
<br/>
