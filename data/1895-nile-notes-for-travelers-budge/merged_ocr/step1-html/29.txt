III. Historical Stelae and Papyri, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">briefly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">relate<br/>
</span>in chronological order the various expeditions undertaken<br/>
by the king for whom they were made. Egyptian kings<br/>
occasionally caused summaries of their principal conquests<br/>
and of the chief events of their reign to be drawn up;<br/>
examples of these are (a) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele </span>of Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>and<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span>) the last section of the great Harris Papyrus, in which<br/>
Rameses III. reviews all the good works which he has<br/>
brought to a successful issue to the glory of the gods of<br/>
Egypt and for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>of her inhabitants. This wonderful papyrus measures <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>feet by <span style="color: #0000FF;">17 </span>inches, and was found<br/>

Egyptian history which falls in the fifteenth century B.C., and<br/>
they are letters from the kings of Babylon, and cities of<br/>
Mesopotamia and Phoenicia relating to marriages, offensive<br/>
and defensive alliances, military matters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, etc., and<br/>
reports on the rebellions and wars which took place at that<br/>
time, addressed to Amenophis III. and to his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chut-en</span>,<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IU.</span>, delighted to go there and shoot the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lions<br/>
