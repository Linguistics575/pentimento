<span>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH<br/>
EDITION.<br/>
<br/>
The short descriptions of the principal Egyptian<br/>
monuments on each side of the Nile between Cairo<br/>
and the Second Cataract (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Widi </span>Halfah), printed in<br/>
the following pages, are not in any way intended<br/>
to form a "Guide to Egypt": they are drawn up<br/>
for the use of those travellers who have a very few<br/>
weeks to spend in Egypt, and who wish to carry<br/>
in their memories some of the more important facts<br/>
connected with the fast-perishing remains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">one.of<br/>
</span>the most interesting and ancient civilizations that<br/>
has been developed on the face of the earth<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The<br/>
existing guide <span style="color: #0000FF;">books </span>are generally too voluminous<br/>
and diffuse for such travellers; and are, moreover,<br/>
in many respects inaccurate. Experience has shown<br/>
that the greater number of travellers in that country<br/>
are more interested in history and matters connected<br/>
with Egyptian civilization from B.C. 4400 to B.C. 450,<br/>
than with Egypt under the rule of the Assyrians<br/>
