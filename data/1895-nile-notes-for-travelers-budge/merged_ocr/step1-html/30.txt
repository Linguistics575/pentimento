attendants. It will be some time before these inscriptions<br/>
are fully made out, but the examination of them has already<br/>
been carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>far to show that they will throw<br/>
most valuable light upon the social condition of Egypt and<br/>
of the countries which were subject to her at that time.<br/>
One of the tablets is written in the language of Mitani,<br/>
and others are inscribed with cuneiform characters in a<br/>
language which is at present unknown<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and some of them<br/>
have dockets in <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>which state from what country they<br/>
were brought. The discovery of these tablets shows that<br/>
there must have been people at the court of Amenophis III.<br/>
who understood the cuneiform characters, and that the officers<br/>
in command over towns in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenicia </span>subject to the rule of<br/>
Egypt could, when occasion required, write their despatches<br/>
in cuneiform. The greater part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>tablets are now in<br/>
the Museums of London and Berlin, some are at the Gizeh<br/>
Museum, and some are in private hands.<br/>
<br/>
The Assyrian kings Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assurbanipal marched against Egypt; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tirhakah </span>defeated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sennacherib </span>at Eltekeh, but was defeated by Esarhaddon, the<br/>
son of Sennacherib, who drove him back into Ethiopia.<br/>
Esarhaddon's son, Assurbanipal, also attacked Tirhakah and<br/>
defeated him. Thebes was captured, and Egypt was divided<br/>
into twenty-two provinces, over some of which Assyrian<br/>
viceroys were placed. A fragment of a Babylonian tablet<br/>
states that Nebuchadnezzar II. marched into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
VII. The Greek and Roman writers upon Egypt<br/>
are many; and of these the best known are Herodotus,<br/>
