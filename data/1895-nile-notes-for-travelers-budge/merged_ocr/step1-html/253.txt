<span>THE PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">GiZEH</span>. 229<br/>
<br/>
which was found near the temple, close by this pyramid,<br/>
confirms the statements of Herodotus and Diodorus<br/>
Siculus, that Chephren built it. A statue of this king, now<br/>
in the Gizeh Museum, was found in the granite temple<br/>
close by. This pyramid appears to be larger than the<br/>
Great Pyramid because it stands upon a higher level of<br/>
stone foundation; it was cased with stone originally and<br/>
polished, but the greater part of the outer casing has<br/>
disappeared. An ascent of this pyramid can only be made<br/>
with difficulty. It was first explored in 1816 by Belzoni<br/>
(born 1778, died 1823), the discoverer of the tomb of<br/>
Seti I. and of the temple of Rameses II. at Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Simbel</span>.<br/>
In the north side of the pyramid are two openings, one at<br/>
the base and one about So feet above it. The upper<br/>
opening led into a corridor 105 feet long, which descends<br/>
into a chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">461 </span>x <span style="color: #0000FF;">16</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">x </span>22% feet, which held the<br/>
granite sarcophagus in which Chephren was buried. The<br/>
lower opening leads into a corridor about 100 feet long,<br/>
which, first descending and then ascending, ends in the<br/>
chamber mentioned above, which is usually called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Belzoni's<br/>
</span>Chamber. The actual height is about 450 feet, and the<br/>
length of each side at the base about <span style="color: #ff0000;">foo </span>feet. The rock<br/>
upon which the pyramid stands has been scarped on the<br/>
north and west sides to make the foundation level. The<br/>
history of the building of the pyramid is thus stated by<br/>
Herodotus<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>"The Egyptians say that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheops </span>reigned<br/>
fifty years<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and when he died, his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom; and he followed the same practices<br/>
as the other, both in other respects, and in building a pyramid;<br/>
which does not come up to the dimensions of his brother's,<br/>
for I myself measured them; nor has it <span style="color: #0000FF;">subterraneous<br/>
</span>chambers<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>nor does a channel from the Nile flow to it, as<br/>
to the other<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but this flows through <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>artificial aqueduct<br/>
round an island within, in which they say the body <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
