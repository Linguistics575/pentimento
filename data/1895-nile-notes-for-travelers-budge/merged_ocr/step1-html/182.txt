<br/>
His attention was first drawn to the study of Egyptian<br/>
archaeology by the examination of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>collection of Egyptian<br/>
antiquities which had been made by Vivant Denon, one of<br/>
the artists attached to the French Expedition in Egypt, and<br/>
his first work on Egyptian archaeology seems to have been<br/>
a notice of a coffin in this collection, which he drew up for<br/>
the instruction of those who came to inspect it in the<br/>
municipal buildings where it was exhibited<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Soon after<br/>
this he wrote a paper on the classification of the cartouches<br/>
inscribed upon the Tablet of Karnak,' a most valuable<br/>
monument which was discovered at Karnak by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Burton</span>, and<br/>
taken by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Prisse </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d'Avennes </span>to Paris, where it is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bibliothéque </span>Nationale. This work was<br/>
addressed to Charles <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lenormant</span>, a pupil of the famous<br/>
Champollion, and this gentleman, together with Maury,<br/>
de Saulcy and Longpérier, advised him to come to Paris,<br/>
where by the kind intercession of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Janron</span>, he obtained an<br/>
appointment on the staff of the Louvre in 1848. As the<br/>
salary paid to the young man was not sufficient to keep<br/>
him, he resolved to ask the French Government to provide<br/>
him with the necessary funds to go to Egypt, where he<br/>
wished to try his fortune. In his application to the Government he stated that the object of his proposed mission was<br/>
to study the Coptic and Syriac <span style="color: #0000FF;">manuscripts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>which still<br/>
remained in the monasteries of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nitrian </span>desert, and if<br/>
possible to acquire them for the nation, and with his application he sent in <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>essay on Coptic bibliography. The<br/>
petition was <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>received, and he set out for Egypt<br/>
in the summer of 1850. Having arrived in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, he found<br/>
that it was not easy to obtain access to the libraries of the<br/>
