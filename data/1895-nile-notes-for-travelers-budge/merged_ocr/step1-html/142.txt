</span>ALEXANDRIA.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria was founded B.C. 332 by Alexander the Great,<br/>
who began to build his city on the little town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rakoti</span>,<br/>
just opposite to the island of Pharos. King Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>Soter<br/>
made this city his capital<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>and having founded the famous<br/>
library and museum, he tried to induce the most learned<br/>
men of his day to live there. His son and successor Ptolemy<br/>
II. Philadelphus, continued the wise policy of his father, and<br/>
Alexandria became famous as a seat of learning. The keeper<br/>
of the museum during the reign of Ptolemy III. Euergetes I.<br/>
was Aristophanes of Byzantium. During the siege of<br/>
the city by the Romans in the time of Caesar, B.C. 48,<br/>
the library of the museum was burnt; but Antony <span style="color: #0000FF;">afterwards </span>gave Cleopatra a large collection of manuscripts<br/>
which <span style="color: #ff0000;">formedthe </span>nucleus of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">library</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>In the early<br/>
centuries of our era the people of Alexandria quarrelled<br/>
perpetually among themselves, t the subjects of dispute<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span>This collection <span style="color: #0000FF;">numbered </span>200,000 MSS., and formed the famous<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pergamenian </span>library founded by Eumenes IL, king of Pergamus,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">197.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>"..... the Alexandrian rabble took on the slightest pretext to<br/>
stones and to cudgels. In street uproar, says an authority, himself<br/>
Alexandrian, the Egyptians are before all others; the smallest spark<br/>
suffices here to kindle a tumult. On account of neglected visits, <span style="color: #ff0000;">on<br/>
</span>account of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confiscation </span>of spoiled provisions, on account of exclusion from a bathing establishment, on account of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dispute between<br/>
the slave of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian </span>of rank and a Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot-soldier </span>as to<br/>
the value or <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-value </span>of their respective slippers, the legions were<br/>
under the necessity of charging among the citizens of Alexandria.....<br/>
In these riots the Greeks acted as instigators..... but in the further<br/>
course of the matter the spite and <span style="color: #0000FF;">savageness </span>of the Egyptian proper<br/>
came into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflict</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The Syrians were cowardly, and as soldiers<br/>
the Egyptians were so too; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>in a street tumult they were able <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>develope a courage worthy of a better cause." (Mommsen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Provinces<br/>
</span>ofthe Roman Empire, Vol<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, p. 265.)<br/>
