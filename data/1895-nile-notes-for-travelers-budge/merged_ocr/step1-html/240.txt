<span>216 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
legs, hands, and feet of such mummies break with a sound<br/>
like the cracking of chemical glass tubing; they burn freely.<br/>
Speaking generally, they will last for ever.<br/>
<br/>
When a mummy has been preserved by natron, that is,<br/>
a mixture of carbonate, sulphate, and muriate of soda, the<br/>
skin is found to be very hard, and it hangs loosely from the<br/>
bones in much the same way as it hangs from the skeletons<br/>
of the dead monks preserved in the crypt beneath the<br/>
Capuchin convent at Floriana in Malta. The hair of such<br/>
mummies usually falls off when touched.<br/>
<br/>
When the friends of a dead Egyptian were too poor to<br/>
pay for the best method of embalmment, the body <span style="color: #0000FF;">could </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>preserved by two very cheap methods; one method was to<br/>
soak it in salt and hot bitumen, and the other in salt only.<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">salt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>bitumen process every cavity of the body was<br/>
filled with bitumen, and the hair disappeared. Clearly it is<br/>
to the bodies which were preserved in this way that the<br/>
name <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>mummy," or bitumen, was first applied.<br/>
<br/>
The salted and dried body is easily distinguishable.<br/>
The skin is like paper, the features and hair have disappeared, and the bones are very brittle and white.<br/>
<br/>
The art of mummifying arrived at the highest pitch of<br/>
perfection at Thebes. The mummies of the first six<br/>
dynasties drop to pieces on exposure to the air, and smell<br/>
slightly of bitumen; those of the XIth dynasty are of a<br/>
yellowish colour and very brittle; those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIIth<br/>
</span>dynasty are black. The method of embalming varied at<br/>
different periods and places. From the XVIIIth to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">XXIst </span>dynasties the Memphis mummies are black, while<br/>
those made at Thebes during the same period are yellowish<br/>
in colour, and have the nails of the hands and feet dyed<br/>
yellow with the juice of the henna plant. After the<br/>
XXVIth dynasty the mummies made at both places are<br/>
quite black and shapeless; they are also very heavy and<br/>
tough, and can only be broken with difficulty.<br/>
