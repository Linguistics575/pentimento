<span>THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH. 157<br/>
<br/>
.Gizeh should participate in this prosperity and receive <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
</span>larger grant of money, both for making purchases and<br/>
excavations, for the attraction of the antiquities of the<br/>
country is a very real and genuine matter, and induces<br/>
travellers to visit it again and again. Whether the antiquities remain in their present position, or whether the<br/>
authorities decide to remove them to a more suitable<br/>
building in Cairo, it is equally certain that the English<br/>
advisers of the Khedive will never allow the progress of<br/>
an institution which draws much money into the country,<br/>
and which is now doing splendid work, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>hampered for<br/>
the sake of a few thousand pounds a year.<br/>
<br/>
The founding of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bali </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>; Museum is due to the marvellous energy and perseverance of F. Auguste Ferdinand<br/>
Mariette. This distinguished Frenchman was born at<br/>
Boulogne-sur-Mer on February 11th, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1821</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>His grandfather was the author of several poetical works, short plays,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>, but his father was only an <span style="color: #ff0000;">employ√© </span>in the Registrar's<br/>
Office of his native town. He was educated at Boulogne,<br/>
and was made professor there when he was twenty years of<br/>
age; here too he lived until 1848. Side by side with the<br/>
duties of his professorship he devoted himself in turn to<br/>
journalism, painting, novel-writing, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, and in addition to<br/>
these matters he found time to study <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeology</span>. Some<br/>
of his early studies were devoted to classical archaeology,<br/>
and here, according to M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero</span>, he exhibited "power<br/>
of discussion, clearness and vigour of style, and keen<br/>
penetration," qualities for which in <span style="color: #0000FF;">afterlife </span>he was famous.<br/>
