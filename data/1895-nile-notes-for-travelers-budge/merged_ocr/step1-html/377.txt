once stood<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>all traces of this have, however, disappeared. To the north of the great temple, hewn in the<br/>
living rock, is a smaller temple, about 84 feet long, which<br/>
was dedicated to the goddess Hathor by Rameses II. and<br/>
his wife Nefert-Ari. The front is ornamented with statues<br/>
of the king, his wife, and some of his children, and over<br/>
the door are his names and titles. In the hall inside are six<br/>
square <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor-headed </span>pillars also inscribed with the names<br/>
and titles of Rameses and his wife. In the small chamber<br/>
at the extreme end of the temple is an interesting scene in<br/>
which the king is making an offering to Hathor in the form<br/>
of a cow; she is called the "lady of Abshek," and is<br/>
standing behind <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>figure of the king.<br/>
<br/>
The chief object of interest at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abt1 </span>Simbel is the Great<br/>
Temple built by Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">TI</span>. to commemorate his <span style="color: #0000FF;">victory<br/>
</span>over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta </span>in north-east Syria; it is the largest and<br/>
finest Egyptian monument in Nubia, and for simple<br/>
grandeur and majesty is second to none in all Egypt. This<br/>
temple is hewn out of the solid grit-stone rock to a depth<br/>
of 185 feet, and the surface of the rock, which originally<br/>
sloped down to the river, was cut away for a space of about<br/>
90 feet square to form the front of the temple, which is<br/>
ornamented by four colossal statues of Rameses IL, 66 feet<br/>
high, seated on thrones, hewn out of the living rock. The<br/>
cornice is, according to the drawing by Lepsius, decorated<br/>
with twenty-one <span style="color: #0000FF;">cynocephali</span>, and beneath it, in the middle,<br/>
is a line of hieroglyphics, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Avg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>U, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tdi-nd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nek<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mix</span>, "I give to thee all life and <span style="color: #0000FF;">strength</span>," on the<br/>
right side of which are four figures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">eight<br/>
</span>cartouches containing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prenomen </span>of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">uraeus </span>on each side; on the left side are four figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Amen,, and eight cartouches as on the right. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">line<br/>
</span>of boldly cut hieroglyphics below reads, "The living Horus<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>the mighty bull, beloved of Mat, king of the North <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
