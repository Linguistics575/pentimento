What the mummies which were made three or four<br/>
hundred years after Christ are like I am unable to say, for<br/>
I have never seen one unrolled. About B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOO </span>the Greeks<br/>
began to paint the portrait of the dead upon the wrappings<br/>
which covered the face.<br/>
<br/>
The art of mummifying was carried on in Egypt for<br/>
nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>hundred years after the birth of Christ, for the<br/>
Greeks and Romans adopted the custom freely. We may<br/>
then say that we know for a certainty that the art of embalming was known and practised for about five thousand<br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
In the account of embalming given us by Herodotus,<br/>
we are told that the internal organs of the body were<br/>
removed, but he omits to say what was done with them.<br/>
We now know that they also were mummified and preserved<br/>
in four jars, the covers of which were made in the shape of<br/>
the heads of the four children of Horus, the genii of the<br/>
dead, whose names were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mestha</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hapi</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuamautef</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Qebbsennuf </span>These genii have been compared with the<br/>
four beasts in the Revelation (chap. iv. 7). The jars and<br/>
the genii to which they were dedicated were under the protection of Isis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ephthys</span>, Neith, and Serk respectively.<br/>
They are called <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Canopic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>jars, because they resemble the<br/>
vase shape of Osiris called Canopus, and they are made of<br/>
Egyptian porcelain, marble, calcareous stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">terracotta</span>,<br/>
wood, etc. The jar of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mestha </span>received the stomach, that<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hapi </span>the smaller intestines, that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuamfmtef </span>the heart,<br/>
and that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Qeblasennuf </span>the liver. Each jar was inscribed<br/>
with a legend stating that the genius to which it was<br/>
dedicated protected and preserved the part of the dead<br/>
body that was in it. In the case of poor people, who could<br/>
not afford a set of canopic jars, it was usual to have a set of<br/>
wax figures made in the shape of the four <span style="color: #0000FF;">genii </span>of the dead,<br/>
and to place them in the dead body with the intestines,<br/>
which were put back. In the time of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XXVIth </span>dynasty,<br/>
