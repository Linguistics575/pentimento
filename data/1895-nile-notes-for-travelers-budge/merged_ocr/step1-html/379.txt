into the camp and pretended that they had been sent by the<br/>
chiefs of their tribe to inform Rameses II. that they had<br/>
forsaken the chief of the Cheta<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>and that they wished to<br/>
make an alliance with his majesty and become <span style="color: #0000FF;">vassals </span>of<br/>
his. They then went on to say that the chief of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta </span>was in the land of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chirebu </span>to the north of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tunep</span>,<br/>
some distance off, and that they were afraid to come near<br/>
the Egyptian king. These two men were giving false information, and they had actually been sent by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta </span>chief<br/>
to find out where Rameses and his army were; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheta<br/>
</span>chief and his army were at that moment drawn up in<br/>
battle array behind Kadesh. Shortly after these men were<br/>
dismissed, an Egyptian scout came into the king's presence<br/>
bringing with him two spies from the army of the chief of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta</span>; on being questioned, they informed Rameses that the<br/>
chief <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta </span>was encamped behind Kadesh, and that he<br/>
had succeeded in gathering together a multitude of soldiers<br/>
and chariots from the countries round about. Rameses<br/>
summoned his <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>to his presence, and informed them of<br/>
the news which he had just heard; they listened with surprise, and insisted that the newly-received information was<br/>
untrue. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rameses </span>blamed the chiefs of the intelligence<br/>
department seriously for their neglect of duty, and they<br/>
admitted their fault. Orders were straightway issued for<br/>
the Egyptian army to march upon Kadesh, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>they<br/>
were crossing an arm of the river near that city the hostile<br/>
forces fell in with each other. When Rameses saw this, he<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>growled at them like his father Menthu, lord of Thebes,"<br/>
and having hastily put on <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>full armour, he mounted his<br/>
chariot and drove into the battle. His onset was so<br/>
sudden and rapid that before he knew where he was he<br/>
<br/>
' The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta </span>have, during the last few years, been identified with the<br/>
Hittites of the Bible; there is no ground for this identification beyond<br/>
the slight similarity of the names. The inscriptions upon the sculptures<br/>
found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerabis </span>still remain undeciphered.<br/>
