RECENT EXCAVATIONS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
During the past year the work of excavating sites in<br/>
Egypt has been carried on with unprecedented activity, and<br/>
the net result has been a very considerable addition to our<br/>
knowledge of ancient Egypt. Under the able direction of<br/>
M. J. de Morgan, his staff have succeeded in clearing out<br/>
large portions of the temples of Thebes on both sides of<br/>
the river, and his own splendid discoveries have given to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh </span>Museum a marvellous collection of XIIth dynasty<br/>
jewellery. M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naville </span>has finished the clearing of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hitshepset</span>'s temple at Der <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Babari </span>on behalf of the Egypt<br/>
Exploration Fund; Messrs. Botti and Hogarth have done<br/>
important work at Alexandria<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Prof. Petrie has dug through<br/>
some two thousand graves containing the remains of what<br/>
he believes to be a new race; M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Daressy </span>and his colleagues<br/>
have unearthed many important objects in the ruins of the<br/>
Temples of Luxor and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet-Habu</span>; Miss Benson<br/>
discovered a statue of the scribe <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemlast </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hut</span>; and some excavations conducted by natives have<br/>
resulted in the finding of that wonderful phalanx of wooden<br/>
soldiers now exhibited in the Gizeh Museum. At the<br/>
Museum Brugsch Bey has continued his work of arranging<br/>
the antiquities acquired by recent excavations, and the<br/>
promptness with which new "<span style="color: #ff0000;">finds </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>are exhibited merits<br/>
great praise.<br/>
