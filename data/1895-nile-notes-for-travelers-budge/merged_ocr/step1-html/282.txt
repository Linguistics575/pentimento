<span>258 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
and a compassionate man, and a ruler who loves his town.<br/>
I have passed the course of years as the ruler of Meh, and<br/>
all the labours of the palace have been carried out by my<br/>
hands. I have given to the overseers of the temples of the<br/>
gods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3,000 </span>bulls with their cows, and I was in<br/>
favour in the palace on account of it, for I carried all the<br/>
products of the milk-bearing cows to the palace, and no<br/>
contributions to the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">storehouse </span>have been more than<br/>
mine. I have never made a child grieve, I have never robbed<br/>
the widow, I have never repulsed the labourer, I have never<br/>
shut up a herdsman, I have never impressed for forced<br/>
labour the labourers of a man who only employed five men;<br/>
there was never a person miserable in my time, no one<br/>
went hungry during my rule, for if there were years of<br/>
scarcity I ploughed up all the arable land in the nome of<br/>
Meh, up to its very frontiers on the north and south. By<br/>
this means I made its people live and procured for them<br/>
provisions, so that there was not a hungry person among<br/>
them. I gave to the widow the same amount as I gave to<br/>
the married woman, and I made no distinction between the<br/>
great and the little in all that I gave<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And, behold, when<br/>
the inundation was great, and the owners of the land<br/>
became rich thereby, I laid no additional tax upon the<br/>
fields." The pictures on the walls represent scenes on the<br/>
farm, the battle-field, the hunting ground and the river<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
various domestic pursuits of women are portrayed with<br/>
wonderful skill. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameni-Amenenuriit</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">q</span>% <span style="color: #0000FF;">h</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a-S</span>,<br/>
was the son of the lady Hennu; the name of his father is<br/>
not given.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Chnemu-Hetep also belongs to the<br/>
northern group of tombs. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chnemu-betep</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5tp </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">& </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>was<br/>
one of the feudal lords of Egypt, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>royal relative," and the<br/>
commandant of the land on the east side of the nome of<br/>
