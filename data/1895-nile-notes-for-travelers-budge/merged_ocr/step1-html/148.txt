times on account of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trilingual </span>inscription, called the<br/>
'Rosetta Stone,' which was found here in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1799 </span>by a<br/>

the Egyptian priests in honour of Ptolemy V., Epiphanes,<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion </span>to work out the phonetic values of a number<br/>
of the hieroglyphic characters employed to write the names<br/>
of the Greek rulers. The stone is preserved in the British<br/>

tribute he secured to himself the liberty of professing the Christian<br/>
religion, and he asked that, after his death, his body might be buried<br/>
in the church of St. John at Alexandria. He sent, as gifts to the<br/>
