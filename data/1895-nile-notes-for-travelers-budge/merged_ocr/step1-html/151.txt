<span>SUEZ AND THE SUEZ CANAL. 127<br/>
<br/>
canal from Suez to Pelusium, but it was afterwards modified,<br/>
and by bringing the northern end into the Mediterranean<br/>
at Port Sa'id, it was found possible to do away with the<br/>
lock at each end, which would have been necessary had it<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">embouched </span>at Pelusium. The fresh-water canal from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mlsils </span>to Suez, with an aqueduct to Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span>, included in<br/>
the original plan, was completed in 1863. The filling of<br/>
the Bitter Lakes with sea-water from the Mediterranean<br/>
was begun on the 18th March, 1869, and the whole canal<br/>
was opened for <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">November </span>16th of the same year.<br/>
The cost of the canal was about <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â£ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">19,000,000</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The buoyed channel which leads into the canal at the<br/>
Suez end is 300 yards across in the widest part. The<br/>
average width of the dredged channel is about 90 feet, and<br/>
the average depth about 28 feet. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shalt1f </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Terrabeh </span>the<br/>
excavation was very difficult, for the ground rises about<br/>
twenty feet above the sea-level, and the elevation is five or<br/>
six miles long. A thick layer of hard rock'cropped' up in<br/>
the line of the canal, and the work of removing it was of<br/>
no slight nature. On a mound not quite half-way between<br/>
Suez and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shahlf </span>are some granite blocks bearing traces of<br/>
cuneiform and hieroglyphic inscriptions recording the name<br/>
of Darius. They appear to be the remains of one of a<br/>
series of buildings erected along the line of the old canal<br/>
which was restored and probably completed by Darius.<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">ShahU </span>the width of the canal is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">go </span>feet, and<br/>
shortly after leaving this place the canal enters the Small<br/>
Bitter Lake, which is about seven miles long. Before<br/>
reaching the end of it is, on the left, another mound on<br/>
which were found the ruins of a building which was excavated by M. de Lesseps. Granite slabs were found there<br/>
inscribed with the name of Darius in Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">cuneiform<br/>
</span>characters and in hieroglyphics. The canal next passes<br/>
through the Great Bitter Lake (about fifteen miles long)<br/>
and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tes/kilometres </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">farther </span>along it passes through the<br/>
