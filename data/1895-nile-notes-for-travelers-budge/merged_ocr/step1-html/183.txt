monasteries, for the Patriarch had insisted that they should<br/>
be carefully guarded from strangers. Profiting by the<br/>
delays caused by the Patriarch's orders, he began to visit<br/>
the sites of ancient Egyptian buildings in the neighbourhood<br/>
of Cairo. While at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>one day he discovered by<br/>
accident <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Sphinx, on which were inscribed the names of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ansar-Hapi </span>or Osiris-Apis (Serapis), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Similar </span>to one he had<br/>
seen at Cairo. He remembered that the Serapeum at Memphis was described by ancient authors as standing on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sandy<br/>
plain<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>and he believed that he had really found the spot<br/>
where it stood and its ruins. Neglecting the original object<br/>
of his expedition, he collected workmen, and in 1850 set to<br/>
work to dig; two months' work revealed <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">forty<br/>
</span>sphinxes, two chapels, a semi-circular space ornamented<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">w1th </span>Greek statues, etc. Through the jealousy of certain<br/>
people who united the profession of politics with wholesale<br/>
trading in antiquities, the Egyptian Government of the day<br/>
issued an order to suspend the excavations, and the work<br/>
was stopped. Soon after, however, the French National<br/>
Assembly voted 30,000 francs for excavation purposes, and<br/>
towards the end of the year Mariette was enabled to enter<br/>
the Serapeum, where he found sixty-four Apis bulls, stelae,<br/>
etc<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>As the dates when the bulls were placed in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>are stated, they afford a valuable help in fixing<br/>
the chronology of Egypt as far back as the XVIIIth dynasty.<br/>
The year 1852 was spent in clearing out the Serapeum, and<br/>
early in 1853 he came to the Pyramids of Gizeh, where he<br/>
carried on excavations for the Due de Luynes; in the latter<br/>
year he discovered a granite temple near Gizeh. About<br/>
this time he was appointed Assistant-Curator at the Louvre.<br/>
<br/>
In 1854,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Abbhs </span>Pasha, who had suspended Mariette's<br/>
excavations two or three years before, died; he was <span style="color: #ff0000;">sueceeded </span>by Sa'id Pasha, who at once conferred the <span style="color: #0000FF;">honour<br/>
