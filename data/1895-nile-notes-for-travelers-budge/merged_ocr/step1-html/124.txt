<br/>
lord of rays, creator of light! The gods give acclamations<br/>
to him, and he stretches out his hands to him that loves<br/>
him. The flame makes his enemies fall, his eye overthrows<br/>
the rebels, it thrusts its copper lance into the sky and<br/>
makes the serpent <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">aw </span>vomit what it has swallowed.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>Nik is one of the names of Apepi, the demon of mist, cloud, and<br/>
night, who was supposed to swallow up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sun </span>daily; he was the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">enemy</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">par </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">excellence</span>, whom the Sun-god R5 was supposed to fight<br/>
against and overcome. Apepi was represented under the form of a<br/>
serpent with knives stuck in his back <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>Compare the following<br/>
extract from the service for his destruction which was recited daily in<br/>
the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-RE</span>, at Thebes<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Fall down upon thy face, Apepi,<br/>
enemy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>The flame coming forth <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the eye of Horus comes<br/>
against thee, a mighty <span style="color: #0000FF;">flame </span>which comes forth from the eye of Horus,<br/>
comes against thee. Thou art thrust down <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flame </span>of fire which<br/>
rushes out against thee, a flame which is fatal to thy soul, thy <span style="color: #0000FF;">intelligence</span>, thy words <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">power</span>, thy body and thy shade. The flame prevails<br/>
over <span style="color: #0000FF;">thee</span>, it drives darts into thy soul, it makes an end <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whatever </span>thou<br/>
hast, and sends goads into thy form. Thou hast fallen by the eye of<br/>
Horus, which is mighty <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>its enemy, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">devours </span>thee, and which<br/>
leads on the mighty flame against thee; the eye of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>prevails over<br/>
thee, the flame devours thee, and nothing of thee remains. Get <span style="color: #0000FF;">thee<br/>
</span>back, thou art hacked in pieces, thy soul is parched, thy name is buried<br/>
in oblivion, silence <span style="color: #0000FF;">covers </span>it, it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">overthrown</span>; thou art put an <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>to<br/>
and buried under threefold oblivion. Get thee back, retreat thou,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">t_hou </span>art cut in pieces and removed from him that is in his shrine. O<br/>
Apepi, thou doubly crushed one, an end to thee, an end to thee!<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mayest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">than </span>never rise up again <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>The eye of Horus prevails over thee<br/>
