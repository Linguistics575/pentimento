<br/>
</span>In the other scenes we have <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekht</span>, accompanied by his<br/>

The most ancient necropolis at Thebes is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span>abu'l<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neliliah</span>, where tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIth</span>, XVIIth, and XVIIIth<br/>
dynasties are to be found. The coffins of the Antef kings<br/>
(XIth dynasty), now in the Louvre and the British Museum,<br/>
were discovered here, and here was made the marvellous<br/>
"find" of the jewellery of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arurheteppr </span>wife of Kames, a king<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XVIIth </span>dynasty, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">750</span>. A little more to the<br/>
south is the necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asasif</span>, where during the XIXth,<br/>
XXIInd, and XXVIth dynasties many beautiful tombs<br/>
were constructed. If the visitor has time, an attempt should<br/>
be made to see the fine tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pe.tii-Amen-ipt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
ARMANT (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ERMENT</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Armant, or Erment, <span style="color: #0000FF;">4581 </span>miles from Cairo, on the west<br/>
bank of the river, was called in Egyptian eee'T' <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menth</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Annu <span style="color: #ff0000;">qem5t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span>Heliopolis of the South "<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
<br/>
</span>it marks the site of the ancient Hermonthis, where, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, "Apollo and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jupiter </span>are both worshipped."<br/>
<br/>
The ruins which remain there belong to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iseion </span>built<br/>
during the reign of the last Cleopatra (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.c</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>51-29). <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
</span>stone-lined tank which lies near this building was probably<br/>
used as a Nilometer.<br/>
