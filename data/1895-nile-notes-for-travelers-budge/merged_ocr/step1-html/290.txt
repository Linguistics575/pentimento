<span>266 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
a small chapel, perhaps the baptistery, about twenty-five<br/>
feet long, and still in tolerable preservation. It is a<br/>
splendid specimen of the richest Roman architecture of the<br/>
latter empire, and is truly an imperial little room. The<br/>
arched ceiling is of stone<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and there are three beautifully<br/>
ornamented niches on each side. The upper end is semicircular, and has been entirely covered with a profusion of<br/>
sculpture in panels, cornices, and every kind of architectural enrichment. When it was entire, and covered<br/>
with gilding, painting, or mosaic, it must have been most<br/>
gorgeous. The altar on such a chapel as this was probably<br/>
of gold, set full of gems; or if it was the baptistery, as I<br/>
suppose, it most likely contained a bath of the most<br/>
precious jasper, or of some of the more rare kinds of marble,<br/>
for the immersion of the converted heathen, whose entrance<br/>
into the church was not permitted until they had been<br/>
purified with the waters of baptism in a building without<br/>
the door of the house of God" (p. 135). The library once<br/>
contained over a hundred parchment books, but these were<br/>
destroyed by the Mamelukes when they last sacked the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">convent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">q<br/>

</span>The Dér el-Ahmar or "Red Monastery," so-called because of the red colour of the bricks of which it is built,<br/>
was also built by the Empress Helena; it is smaller and<br/>
better preserved than the White Monastery, and was<br/>
dedicated to the Abba <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bésa</span>, the disciple and friend of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shemhi</span>. The pillars of both churches were taken from<br/>
Athribis, which lay close by; the orientation of neither<br/>
church is exact, for their axes point between N.E. and<br/>
N.E. by E. The ruined church of Armant near Thebes is<br/>
built on the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">model</span>.<br/>

<br/>
A few miles south of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stiluili</span>, on the east bank of the<br/>
river, lies the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahmim</span>, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shmin </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chmim</span>,<br/>
