east, the visitor comes to a wall at right angles to the first,<br/>
upon which is inscribed a copy of the poem of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pen-ta-url</span>,<br/>
celebrating the victory of Rameses II<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>over the Cheta,<br/>
in the fifth year of his reign<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and on the west side of the<br/>
wall is a stele on which is set forth <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>copy of the offensive<br/>
and defensive treaty between this king and the prince of<br/>
the Cheta.<br/>
<br/>
The inscriptions on the magnificent ruins at Karnak<br/>
show that from the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, B.C. 2433, to that of<br/>
Alexander IV., B.C. 312 (<span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>), the religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">centre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper<br/>
</span>Egypt was at Thebes, and that the most powerful of the<br/>
kings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>reigned during this period spared neither<br/>
pains nor expense in adding to and beautifying the temples<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
The fury of the elements, the attacks of Egypt's enemies,<br/>
and above all the annual inundation of the Nile, have<br/>
helped to throw down these splendid buildings. The<br/>
days are not far distant when, unless energetic measures<br/>
are taken meanwhile, a large number of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns<br/>
</span>in the wonderful hall of Seti I. must fall, and in their fall<br/>
will do irreparable damage to the other parts of the building. It is much to be hoped that the public opinion of the<br/>
civilized world will not allow these deeply interesting relics<br/>
of a mighty nation to perish before their eyes. Steps<br/>
should at once be taken to keep out the inundation, and<br/>
if possible the tottering columns and walls should be<br/>
strengthened.<br/>
<br/>
- The short-lived heresy of the worship of the disk of the Sun<br/>
instead of that of Amen-Ra would not interfere with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">general </span>popularity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>temples.<br/>
