<span>THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>93<br/>
<br/>
It is tolerably evident then that grand tombs were not<br/>
built as mere objects of pride, but as "everlasting habitations "which would serve to preserve the body from<br/>
decay, and keep it ready to be re-inhabited by the soul<br/>
at the proper season. Greek authors have written much<br/>
about the beliefs of the Egyptians; but the greater number of<br/>
their statements are to be received with caution. They wrote<br/>
down what they were told, but were frequently misinformed.<br/>
<br/>
The papyri which have come down to us show that the<br/>
moral conceptions of the Egyptians were of a very high<br/>
order: and works like the Maxims of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptalrbetep </span>and the<br/>
Maxims of Ani' show clearly that a man's duty to his god<br/>
and to his fellow-man was laid down in a distinct manner.<br/>
Such works will compare very <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with the Proverbs<br/>
of Solomon and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wisdom </span>of Jesus the son of Sirach.<br/>
<br/>
The religious literature of the Egyptians includes a large<br/>
number of works, of which the most important is the<br/>
collection of chapters generally called the Book of the<br/>
Dead; in Egyptian its name is per em <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span>, "Coming forth<br/>
by day." Selections from this work were written in<br/>
the hieratic character upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">cofhns </span>as early as the XIIth<br/>
dynasty (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 2500), and this practice was continued down<br/>
to the second century of our era. The walls of tombs were<br/>
covered with extracts from it, and scribes and people of rank<br/>
had buried with them large rolls of papyrus inscribed with its<br/>
principal chapters, and ornamented with vignettes <span style="color: #0000FF;">explanatory </span>of the text which ran beneath. Some of the chapters in<br/>
the work are of very great antiquity; and so far back as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>the text was so old, and had been copied so often,<br/>
that it was already not to be understood. Many parts of it are<br/>
obscure, and many utterly corrupt; but the discovery from<br/>
time to time of ancient papyri with accurate readings<br/>
tends to clear up many doubtful points, and to bring out<br/>
the right meaning of certain parts of the work.<br/>
