<span>EGYPTIAN WRITING. <span style="color: #0000FF;">71<br/>
<br/>
</span>The ancient Egyptians had: <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>the vague or civil year,<br/>
which consisted of 365 days; it was divided into twelve<br/>
months of thirty days each, and five intercalary days were<br/>
added at the end; <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>the Sothic year of <span style="color: #0000FF;">365</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>days. The<br/>
first year of a Sothic period began with the rising of Sirius<br/>
or the dog-star, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist </span>of the month Thoth, when it<br/>
coincided with the beginning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>inundation; III. the<br/>
Egyptian solar year,' which was a quarter of a day shorter<br/>
than the Sothic year, an error which corrected itself in 1460<br/>
fixed years or 1461 vague years. The true year was estimated<br/>
approximately <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the conjunction of the sun with Sirius. Dr.<br/>
Brugsch thinks <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yipt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaohs</span>, Vol. II., p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">76</span>)<br/>
that as early <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2500 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fully </span>different forms of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>already in use, and that the "little <span style="color: #0000FF;">year</span>" corresponded with<br/>
the lunar year, and the "great year" with a lunar year<br/>
having intercalated days. Each month was dedicated to a<br/>
god.t The Egyptians dated their <span style="color: #0000FF;">stelae </span>and documents by<br/>
the day of the month and the year of the king who was<br/>
reigning at the time. The Copts first dated their documents<br/>
according to the years of the INDICTION; the indictions were<br/>
periods of fifteen years, and the first began A.D. 312. In<br/>
later times the Copts made use of the era of the Martyrs,<br/>
which was reckoned from the 29th of August, A.D. 284.<br/>
About the ninth century after Christ they began to adopt<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muhammadan </span>era of the Hijrah or "flight," which was<br/>
reckoned from A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">622</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>It was practically the same as the civil year.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">f </span>Some of the Coptic names of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">months </span>show that they have<br/>
<br/>
been derived from the ancient Egyptian: thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Théth </span>is from,<br/>
