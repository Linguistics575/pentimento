<span>232 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt finished the pyramid and made a second chamber to<br/>
hold his or her body. At a short distance to the east of<br/>
this pyramid are the ruins of a temple which was probably<br/>
used in connexion with the rites performed in honour of the<br/>
dead king. In A.D. 1196 a deliberate and systematic<br/>
attempt was made to destroy this pyramid by the command<br/>
of the Muhammadan ruler of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>The account of the<br/>
character of Mycerinus and of his pyramid as given by<br/>
Herodotus is as follows: "They said that after him,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mycerinus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>son of Cheops, reigned over <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span>that the<br/>
conduct of his father was displeasing to him; and that he<br/>
opened the temples, and permitted the people, who were<br/>
worn down to the last extremity, to return to their employments, and to sacrifices; and that he made the most just<br/>
decisions of all their kings. On this account, of all the<br/>
kings that ever reigned in Egypt, they praise him most, for<br/>
he both judged well in other respects, and moreover, when<br/>
any man complained of his decision, he used to make him<br/>
some present out of his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasury </span>and pacify his anger.<br/>
...... This king also left a pyramid much less than that<br/>
of his father, being on each side twenty feet short of three<br/>
plethra; it is quadrangular, and built half way up of Ethiopian stone. Some of the Grecians erroneously say that this<br/>
pyramid is the work of the courtesan Rhodopis; but they<br/>
evidently appear to me ignorant who Rhodopis was; for<br/>
they would not else have attributed to her the building <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">such<br/>
</span>a pyramid, on which, so to speak, <span style="color: #0000FF;">numberless </span>thousands<br/>
of talents were expended; besides, Rhodopis flourished in<br/>
the reign of Amasis, and not at this time<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for she was very<br/>
many years later than those kings who left these pyramids."<br/>
(Cary's translation.)<br/>
<br/>
In one of the three small pyramids near that of Mycerinus<br/>
the name of this king is painted on the ceiling.<br/>
