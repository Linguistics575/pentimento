<span>300 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
interior face of the second pylon are sculptured scenes in<br/>
the war of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>against the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheta</span>, which took place<br/>
in the fifth year of his reign; in them he is represented<br/>
slaying the personal attendants of the prince of the Cheta.<br/>
Elsewhere is the famous scene in which Rameses, having<br/>
been forsaken by his army, is seen cutting his way through<br/>
the enemy, and hurling them one after the other into<br/>
the Orontes near Kadesh. The walls of the temple are<br/>
ornamented with small battle scenes and reliefs representing<br/>
the king making offerings to the gods of Thebes. On the<br/>
ceiling of one of the chambers is an interesting astronomical<br/>
piece on which the twelve Egyptian months are mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Ill. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Coiossi.-These </span>two interesting statues were<br/>
set up in honour of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, whom they represent;<br/>
they stood in front of the pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>calcareous stone temple<br/>
which was built by this king; this has now entirely disappeared. They were hewn out of a hard grit-stone, and<br/>
the top of each was about sixty feet above the ground;<br/>
originally each was monolithic. The statue <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the north is<br/>
the famous Colossus of Memnon, from which a sound<br/>
was said to issue every morning when the sun rose. The<br/>
upper part of it was thrown down by an earthquake, it is<br/>
said, about B.C. 27; the damage was partially repaired<br/>
during the reign of Septimius Severus, who restored the<br/>
head and shoulders of the figure by adding to it five<br/>
layers of stone. When Strabo was at Thebes with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ailius<br/>
</span>Gallus he heard "a noise at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>hour of the day, but<br/>
whether proceeding from the base or from the colossus, or<br/>
produced on purpose by some of those standing round the<br/>
base, I cannot confidently assert." It is said that after the<br/>
colossus was repaired no sound issued from it. Some<br/>
think that the noise was caused by the sun's rays striking<br/>
upon the stone, while others believe that a priest hidden in<br/>
the colossus produced it by striking a stone. The inscriptions show that many distinguished Romans visited the<br/>
