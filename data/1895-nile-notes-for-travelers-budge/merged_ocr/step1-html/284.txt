<span>260 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
which represents the arrival in Egypt of a family of thirtyseven persons belonging to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aalnn</span>, a Semitic race, who<br/>
appear to have come thither to settle. The first person in<br/>
the scene is the Egyptian "royal scribe, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefer-hetep</span>," who<br/>
holds in his hands a piece of writing which states that in<br/>
the sixth year of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span>II. thirty-seven people of the<br/>
Aamu brought to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chnemu-hetep</span>, the son of a feudal lord,<br/>
<br/>
paint for the eyes called <span style="color: #ff0000;">mPWEQ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mest'emet</span>.<br/>

<br/>
</span>Behind the scribe stands an Egyptian superintendent, and<br/>
behind him the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aamu </span>chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abesha</span>, "the prince of the foreign<br/>
country," together with his fellow-countrymen and women,<br/>
who have come with him<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>in addition to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye-paint</span>, they<br/>
bring a goat as a present for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chnemu-hetep</span>. The men of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aainu </span>wear beards, and carry bows and arrows; both<br/>
men and women are dressed in garments of many colours.<br/>
The home of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aamu </span>lay to the east of Palestine. In<br/>
this picture some have seen a representation of the arrival<br/>
of Jacob's sons in Egypt to buy corn; there is no evidence<br/>
for the support of this theory. That the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Agnus </span>were<br/>
shepherds or Hyksos is another theory that has been put<br/>
forth. The paintings in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chnemu-betep</span>'s tomb are it<br/>
anything more beautiful than those in that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ameni</span>, and<br/>
they represent with wonderful fidelity the spearing of fish,<br/>
the netting of birds, the hunting of wild animals, etc., etc<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the other tombs are most interesting scenes connected<br/>
with the daily occupations and amusements of the ancient<br/>
Egyptians. The results of the work carried on at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beni<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan </span>by the Egypt Exploration Fund are given by Messrs.<br/>
Newberry and Fraser in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beui-Hasau</span>, London, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1893</span>, 1894.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">RODA</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Roda</span>, 182 miles from Cairo, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat </span>of a large sugar<br/>
manufactory, lies on the west bank of the river, just opposite<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shékh'Alxideh</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoé</span>, a town built by Hadrian, and<br/>
