<span>THE NILE. 47<br/>
<br/>
width of the strips of cultivated land on each bank of<br/>
the river in Egypt together is never more than eight or<br/>
nine miles.<br/>
<br/>
In ancient days the Nile poured its waters into the<br/>
sea by seven mouths; those of Damietta and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arc </span>now, however, the only two which remain. The Delta<br/>
is, in its widest part, about ninety miles across from east<br/>
to west, and the distance of the apex from the sea is<br/>
also about ninety miles. Many attempts have been made<br/>
to ascertain the age of Egypt by estimating the annual<br/>
alluvial deposit; the results, however, cannot be implicitly<br/>
relied on.<br/>
<br/>
The inundation is caused by the descent of the rain<br/>
which falls on the Abyssinian mountains. The indications of<br/>
the rise of the river may be seen at the cataracts as early<br/>
as the beginning of June, and a steady increase goes on until<br/>
the middle of July, when the increase of water becomes very<br/>
great. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>continues to rise until the middle of September, when it remains stationary for a period of about<br/>
three weeks, sometimes a little less. In October it rises<br/>
again, and attains its highest level. From this period it<br/>
begins to subside, and, though it rises yet once more, and<br/>
reaches occasionally its former highest point, it sinks steadily<br/>
until the month of June, when it is again at its lowest level.<br/>

takes place generally in the second or third week of August<br/>
at Fum el-Khalig, at Cairo. In ancient days the ceremony<br/>
of cutting the canals was accompanied with great festivities,<br/>
and great attention was paid to the height of the river<br/>
in various parts of Egypt, that the cutting might take place<br/>
at the most favourable time. We learn, on the authority<br/>
of Seneca, that offerings of gold and other gifts were thrown<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The seven mouths were called the Pelusiac, Tanitic, Mendesian,<br/>
Phatnitic, Sebennytic, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bolbitic</span>, and the Canopic.<br/>
