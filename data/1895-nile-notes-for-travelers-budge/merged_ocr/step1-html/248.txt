<span>224 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>

probable that they were also entered by the Romans. Khalif<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">M2nuin </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8r3-833</span>) entered the Great Pyramid, and<br/>
found that others had been there before him. The treasure<br/>
which is said to have been discovered there by him is<br/>
probably fictitious. Once opened, it must have been evident<br/>
to every one what splendid quarries the pyramids formed,<br/>
and very few hundred years after the conquest of Egypt<br/>
by the Arabs they were laid under contribution for stone<br/>
to build mosques, etc., in Cairo. Late in the twelfth<br/>
century Melik <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kamil </span>made a mad attempt to destroy<br/>
the third pyramid at Gizeh built by Mycerinus; but after<br/>
months of toil he only succeeded in stripping off the<br/>
covering from one of the sides. It is said that Muhammad<br/>
'Ali was advised to undertake the senseless task of destroying them all.<br/>
<br/>
THE GREAT PYRAMID.<br/>
<br/>
This, the largest of the three pyramids at Gizeh, was built<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chufu </span>Â© <span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">K</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>or Cheops, the second king of the<br/>
<br/>
IVth dynasty, B.C. 3733, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22A</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chai</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>. His<br/>
name was <span style="color: #ff0000;">tound </span>written in red ink upon the blocks of stone<br/>
inside it. All four sides measure in greatest length about<br/>
755 feet each, but the length of each was originally<br/>
about 20 feet more; its height now is 451 feet, but it<br/>
is said to have been originally about 481 feet. The stone<br/>
used in the construction of this pyramid was brought<br/>
from Turra and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam</span>, and the contents amount to<br/>
85,000,000 cubic feet. The flat space at the top of the<br/>
pyramid is about thirty feet square, and the view from it is<br/>
very fine.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance (A) to this pyramid is, as with all pyramids,<br/>
on the north side, and is about 45 feet above the ground.<br/>
The passage A <span style="color: #ff0000;">B </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">C </span>is 320 feet long, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3141 </span>feet high, and 4 feet<br/>
