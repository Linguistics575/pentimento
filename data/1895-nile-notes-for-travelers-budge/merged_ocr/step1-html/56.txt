<span>THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptians, whom the sculptures and monuments<br/>
made known to us as being among the most ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants </span>of the country, belong, beyond all doubt, to the<br/>
Caucasian race, and they seem to have migrated thither<br/>
from the East. The original home of the invaders was,<br/>
apparently, Asia, and they made their way across Mesopotamia and Arabia, and across the Isthmus of Suez into<br/>
Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>has been suggested that they sailed across the<br/>
Indian Ocean and up the Red Sea, on the western shore of<br/>
which they landed. It is, however, very doubtful if a<br/>
people who lived in the middle of a huge land like central<br/>
Asia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>have enough experience to make and handle<br/>
ships <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>large to cross such seas. No period can<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>fixed for the arrival of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">neW-Comers </span>from the East<br/>
into Egypt; we are, however, justified in assuming that it<br/>
took place before B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">5000</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>When the people from the East had made their way<br/>
into Egypt, they found there an aboriginal race with a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dark </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">skin </span>and complexion. The Egyptians generally<br/>
called their land <span style="color: #0000FF;">9:33 </span>Kamt, i.e., "black"; and if the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">da.rk</span>, rich colour of the cultivated land of Egypt be<br/>
considered, the appropriateness of the term will be at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">once </span>evident. The hieroglyphic which is read <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kam</span>, is the<br/>
skin of a crocodile, and we know from Horapollo (ed. Cory,<br/>
p. 87), that this sign was used to express anything of a<br/>
dark colour.' The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">tt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ham</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>is given to Egypt by the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>"To denote <span style="color: #0000FF;">darkness</span>, they represent the TAIL OF A CROCODILE,<br/>
for by no other means <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>the crocodile <span style="color: #0000FF;">inflict </span>death and destruction<br/>
on any animal which it may have caught than by first striking it with<br/>
its tail, and rendering it incapable of motion."<br/>
