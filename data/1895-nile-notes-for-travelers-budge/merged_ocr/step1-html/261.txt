<span style="color: #ff0000;">BEDRASHitN</span>, MEMPHIS, AND<br/>
SAKKARAH.<br/>
<br/>
The ruins of Memphis and the antiquities at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah<br/>
</span>are usually reached by steamer or train from Cairo to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashén</span>. Leaving the river or station the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashén<br/>
</span>is soon reached, and a short ride next brings the traveller to<br/>
the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mit-Rahineh</span>. On the ground lying for some<br/>
distance round about these two villages once stood the city<br/>
of Memphis, though there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>left to show<br/>
its limits. According to Herodotus (ii., 99), <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Menes, who<br/>
first ruled over Egypt, in the first place protected Memphis<br/>
by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mound</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>for the whole river formerly ran close to<br/>
the sandy mountain on the side of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Libya </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>but <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menes</span>,<br/>
beginning about a hundred <span style="color: #0000FF;">stades </span>above Memphis, filled in<br/>
the elbow towards the south, dried up the old channel, and<br/>
conducted the river into a canal, so as to make it flow<br/>
between the mountains<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>this bend of the Nile, which flows<br/>
excluded from its ancient course, is still carefully upheld by<br/>
the Persians, being made secure every year; for if the river<br/>
should break through and <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow </span>in this part, there would<br/>
be danger lest all Memphis should be flooded. When the<br/>
part cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>had been made firm land by this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menes</span>, who<br/>
was first king, he in the first place built on it the city that is<br/>
now called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memphis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>for Memphis is situate in the narrow<br/>
part of Egypt, and outside of it he excavated a lake from<br/>
the river towards the north and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">west</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for the Nile itself<br/>
bounds it towards the east. In the next place, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tlay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">relate<br/>
</span>that he built in it the temple of Vulcan, which is vast and<br/>
well worthy of mention." (Cary's translation.)<br/>
<br/>
Whether Menes built the town or not, it is quite certain<br/>
that the city of Memphis was of most ancient foundation.<br/>
