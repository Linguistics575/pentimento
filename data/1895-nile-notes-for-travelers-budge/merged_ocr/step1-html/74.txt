EGYPTIAN WRITING.<br/>
<br/>
The system of writing employed by the earliest inhabitants of the Valley of the Nile known to us was entirely<br/>
pictorial, and had much in common with the pictorial<br/>
writing of the Chinese and the ancient people who migrated<br/>
into <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babylonia </span>from the East. There <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>to be no<br/>
inscription in which pictorial characters are used entirely,<br/>
for the earliest inscriptions now known to us contain<br/>
alphabetic <span style="color: #ff0000;">characters</span>. Inscriptions upon statues, <span style="color: #ff0000;">coflins</span>,<br/>
tombs, temples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>of<br/>
objects are employed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>usually termed'Hieroglyphic'<br/>
(from <span style="color: #0000FF;">thc </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Crock </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tVeov1vriftco'v</span>); for writing on papyri a<br/>
cursive form of hieroglyphic <span style="color: #0000FF;">called'Hieratic</span>' (from the<br/>
Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">iepa-ruco'e</span>), was employed by the priests, who, at<br/>
times, also used hieroglyphic; a third kind of writing,<br/>
consisting of purely conventional modifications of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic<br/>
</span>characters, which preserve little of the original form, was<br/>
employed for social and business <span style="color: #0000FF;">purposes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>it is called<br/>
demotic (from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crack</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ann√©g</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The following will<br/>
show the different <span style="color: #0000FF;">forms </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">characters </span>in the three<br/>
styles of <span style="color: #0000FF;">writing-<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HIERATIC</span>.<br/>
