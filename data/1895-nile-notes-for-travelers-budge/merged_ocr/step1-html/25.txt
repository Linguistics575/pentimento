EGYPTIAN HISTORY.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>history of Egypt is the oldest history known to us.<br/>
It is true that the earliest of the Babylonian kings whose<br/>
names are known lived very little later than the earliest<br/>
kings of Egypt, nevertheless our knowledge of the early<br/>
Egyptian is greater than of the early Babylonian kings.<br/>
A large portion of Egyptian history can be constructed<br/>
from the native records of the Egyptians, and it is now<br/>
possible to correct and modify many of the statements<br/>
upon this subject made by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus<br/>
and other classical authors. The native and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">documents </span>from which Egyptian history is obtained are <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>--<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. Lists of Kings found in the Turin Papyrus, the<br/>
Tablet of Abydos, the Tablet of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, and the<br/>
Tablet of Karnak. The Turin papyrus contained <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>complete list of kings, beginning with the god-kings and<br/>
continuing down to the end of the rule of the Hyksos,<br/>
about B.C. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I700</span>. The name of each king during this period,<br/>
together with the length of his reign in years, months and<br/>
days, was given, and it would have been, beyond all doubt,<br/>
the most valuable of all documents for the chronology of the<br/>
oldest period of Egyptian history, if scholars had been able<br/>
to make use of it in the perfect condition in which it was<br/>
