162. Grey granite Stele of the Dream. The text here<br/>
inscribed records that an Ethiopian king, whose name<br/>
is read provisionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nut-meri-Amen</span>, and who reigned<br/>
about B.C. 650, had a dream one night in which two<br/>
snakes appeared to him, one on his right hand, and the<br/>
other on his left. When he awoke he called upon his<br/>
magicians to explain it, and they informed him that the<br/>
snakes portended that he should be lord of the lands of<br/>
the North and South. His majesty went into the temple<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra </span>at Napata, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barkal</span>, and having<br/>
there made rich offerings to the god, he set out for the<br/>
north. Sailing down the river he made offerings to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnemu-Ra</span>, the god of Elephantine, and to Amen-Ri<br/>
of Thebes, and the people on both sides of the river<br/>
shouted "Go in peace." When he arrived at Memphis,<br/>
the people thereof made war upon him, but he defeated<br/>
them and entered the town. He went into the temple<br/>
of Ptah and made rich offerings to Ptah-Seker and to<br/>
Sekhet, and gave orders to build a temple to Amen<br/>
He then set out to conquer the chiefs in the Delta, and<br/>
having succeeded by the help of Amen, he returned to<br/>
Nubia. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span>Barkal.<br/>
