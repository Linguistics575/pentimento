known names as "Luxor," in Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">EI-Uh/tr </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-k.uu.n'rr</span>, and "Cairo," in Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">1.LAtltiea</span>, have not<br/>
been altered. Similarly, the ordinary well-known<br/>
forms of the Egyptian proper names "Rameses,"<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thothmesr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis</span>," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Psammetichus</span>," "Hophra" or "Apries," <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, etc., have been<br/>
used in preference to the more correct transcriptions<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rii-messu</span>," "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel1uti-mes</span>," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-betep</span>," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Arie-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mes</span>," "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Psemthek</span>," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ualr-ilo-Ri</span>"<br/>
<br/>
The transliteration of Egyptian and Arabic words<br/>
<br/>
is that in common use throughout Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The dates assigned to the Egyptian kings are<br/>
those of Dr. H. Brugsch, who bases his calculations<br/>
on the assumption that the average duration of a<br/>
generation was thirty-three years. Hence it will<br/>
be readily understood that the date assigned to<br/>
Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ac</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1333</span>), for instance, is only ap<br/>
proximately correct.<br/>
<br/>
During recent years Prof. J. Norman Lockyer,<br/>
C.B., F.R.S., has been engaged in making careful<br/>
investigations into the subject of the orientation of<br/>
Egyptian temples, from which we may one day hope<br/>
to obtain data for finding within a few years the<br/>
age of each. Although these researches <span style="color: #0000FF;">already<br/>
</span>enable us to rectify many important points in the<br/>
