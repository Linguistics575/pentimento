VIII. The Tombs of the Kings, called in Arabic<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibtrn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Mt0lrvare </span>hewn out of the living rock in a valley,<br/>
which is reached by passing the temple at <span style="color: #ff0000;">W1rrlah</span>; it<br/>
is situated about three or four miles from the river.<br/>
This valley contains the tombs of the kings of the XIXth<br/>
and XXth dynasties, and is generally known as the Eastern<br/>
Valley; a smaller valley, the Western, contains the tombs<br/>
of the last kings of the XVIIIth dynasty. These tombs<br/>
consist of long inclined planes with a number of chambers<br/>
or halls receding into the mountain sometimes to a<br/>
distance of 500 feet. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Str</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nbo </span>gives the number of these<br/>
royal tombs as 40, 17 of which were open in the time<br/>
of Ptolemy Lagus; in 1835 21 were known, but the<br/>
labours of M. Mariette were successful in bringing four<br/>
more to light. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>important of these tombs are _<br/>
<br/>
No, <span style="color: #0000FF;">17</span>. Tomb of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 1366, commonly called<br/>
"Belzoni's Tomb," because it was discovered by that brave<br/>
traveller in the early part of this century; it had already<br/>
been <span style="color: #0000FF;">rifled</span>, but the beautiful alabaster sarcophagus, which<br/>
is now preserved in the Soane Museum in London, was<br/>
still lying in its chamber at the bottom of the tomb. The<br/>
inscriptions and scenes sculptured on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>form parts of<br/>
