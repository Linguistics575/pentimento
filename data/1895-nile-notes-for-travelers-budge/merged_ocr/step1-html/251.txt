them to the mountain called the Libyan. And they worked<br/>
to the number of 100,000 men at a time, each party during<br/>
three months. The time during which the people were<br/>
thus harassed by toil, lasted ten years on the road which<br/>
they constructed, along which they drew the stones, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>work<br/>
in my opinion, not much less than the pyramid; for its<br/>
length is five stades (3,051 feet), and its width ten <span style="color: #ff0000;">orgyae<br/>
</span>(60 feet), and its height, where it is the highest, eight <span style="color: #ff0000;">orgyae<br/>
</span>(48 feet); and it is of polished stone, with figures carved on<br/>
it: on this road these ten years were expended, and in<br/>
forming the <span style="color: #0000FF;">subterraneous </span>apartments on the hill, on which<br/>
the pyramids stand, which he had made as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>burial vault <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>himself, in an island, formed by draining a canal from the<br/>
Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting the pyramid<br/>
itself: of this, which is square, each face is eight plethra<br/>
(820 feet), and the height is the same; it is composed of<br/>
polished stones, and jointed with the greatest exactness<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>none of the stones are less than thirty feet. This pyramid<br/>
was built thus; in the form of steps, which some call<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">crosses</span>, others <span style="color: #ff0000;">bomides</span>.' When they had first built it in<br/>
this manner, they raised the remaining stones by machines<br/>
made of short pieces of wood<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">having </span>lifted them from the<br/>
ground to the first range of steps, when the stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrived<br/>
</span>there, it was put on another machine that stood ready on<br/>
the first range; and from this it was drawn to the second<br/>
range on another machine; for the machines were equal in<br/>
number to the ranges of steps; or they removed the<br/>
machine, which was only one, and portable, to each range in<br/>
succession, whenever they wished to raise the stone higher<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>for I should relate it in both ways, as it is related<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
highest parts of it, therefore, were first finished, and afterwards they completed the parts next following; but last of<br/>
all they finished the parts on the ground and that were<br/>
lowest. On the pyramid is shown an inscription, in<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">characters</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>how much was expended in radishes,<br/>
