<br/>
</span>of the Ancient Empire found at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salilriirah </span>belong to two<br/>
classes, in the commoner of which the naked body was<br/>
buried about three feet deep in the sand. When the<br/>
yellowish-white skeletons of such bodies are found to-day,<br/>
neither fragments of linen nor pieces of <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>are visible<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>occasionally one is found laid within four walls roughly<br/>
built of yellow bricks made of sand, lime, and small stones.<br/>
A vaulted brick roof covers the space between the walls<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it<br/>
is hardly necessary to say that such tombs represent the last<br/>
resting places of the poor, and that nothing of any value is<br/>
ever found inside them. The tombs of the better sort are<br/>
carefully built, and were made for the wealthy and the great;<br/>
such a tomb is usually called <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">mas.t.aba'k </span>(the<br/>
Arabic word <span style="color: #0000FF;">for'bench </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>because its length in proportion<br/>
to its height is great, and reminded them of the long, low<br/>
seat common in Oriental houses, and familiar to them.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>is a heavy, massive building, of rectangular<br/>
shape, the four sides of which are four walls symmetrically<br/>
inclined towards their common centre. Each course of<br/>
stones, formed by blocks laid upon each other, is carried<br/>
a little behind the other. The largest <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>measures<br/>
about 170 feet long by 86 feet wide, and the smallest about<br/>
26 feet by 20 feet<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>they vary in height from 13 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">30 </span>feet.<br/>
The ground on which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>are built<br/>
is composed of rock covered with sand to the depth of a<br/>
few feet; their foundations are always on the rock. Near<br/>
the pyramids of Gizeh they are arranged in a symmetrical<br/>
manner<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they are oriented astronomically to the true north,<br/>
and their larger axes are always towards the north. Though<br/>
they have, at first sight, the appearance of unfinished<br/>
pyramids, still they have nothing in common with pyramids<br/>
except their orientation towards the true north. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastabas<br/>
</span>are built of two kinds of stone and of bricks, and they are<br/>
