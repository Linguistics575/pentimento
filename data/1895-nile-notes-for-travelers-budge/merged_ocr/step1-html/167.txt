<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>Khalif, was built on the plan of the mosque of ibn<br/>

The Mosque EL-AZHAR is said to have been founded<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Johar</span>, the general of Mu'izz, about A.D. 980. The plan<br/>
of the principal part was the same as that of the mosque of<br/>
'Amr, but very little of the original building remains. It<br/>
was made a university by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalif'Aziz </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">A.D. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">97i-996</span>),<br/>
and great alterations were made in the building by different<br/>
Sultans in the twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and<br/>
eighteenth centuries; Sa'id Pasha made the last, A.D. 1848.<br/>
The minarets belong to different periods; the mosque has six<br/>
gates, and at the principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Gate <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Barbers,"<br/>
is the entrance. On three of the sides of the open court are<br/>
compartments, each of which is reserved for the worshippers<br/>
who belong to a certain country. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Liwan </span>of the mosque<br/>
is huge, and its ceiling is supported upon 380 pillars ot<br/>
various kinds of stone<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it is here that the greater part of<br/>
the students of the university carry on their studies. The<br/>
number of students varies from 10,000 to 13,000, and the<br/>
education, from the Muhammadan point of view, is perhaps<br/>
the most thorough in the whole world.<br/>
