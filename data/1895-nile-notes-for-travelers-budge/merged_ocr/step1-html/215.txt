589. Copy of a work written by a scribe called Ani, who<br/>
gives his son Khensu-hetep advice as to judicious behaviour in all the varied scenes of life; the following are<br/>
taken from his precepts <span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--<br/>
</span>"If a man cometh to seek thy counsel, let this drive<br/>
thee to books for information.<br/>
<br/>
"Enter not into the house of another; if a man maketh<br/>
thee to enter his house it is an honour for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Spy not upon the acts of another from thy house.<br/>
<br/>
"Be not the first to enter or to leave an <span style="color: #0000FF;">assembly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lest<br/>
</span>thy name be tarnished.<br/>
<br/>
"The sanctuary of God <span style="color: #ff0000;">abhorreth </span>noisy declamations.<br/>
Pray humbly and with a loving heart, whose words<br/>
are spoken silently. God will then protect thee, and<br/>
hear thy petitions, and accept thy offerings.<br/>
<br/>
"Consider what hath been. Set before thee a correct<br/>
rule of life as an example to follow. The messenger<br/>
of death will come to thee as to all others to carry<br/>
thee away; yea, he <span style="color: #ff0000;">standeth </span>ready. Words will profit<br/>
thee nothing, for he cometh, he is ready! Say not,<br/>
'I am a child, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wouldst </span>thou in very truth bear me<br/>
away?' Thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">knowest </span>not how thou wilt die. Death<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cometh </span>to meet the babe at his mother's breast, even<br/>
as he <span style="color: #ff0000;">meeteth </span>the old man who hath finished his<br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
"Take heed with all diligence that thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">woundest </span>no<br/>
man with thy words.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
