to Berenice on the Red Sea started, and the merchandise<br/>
which passed through the town from the east, and the stone<br/>
from the famous porphyry quarries in the Arabian desert<br/>
must have made it wealthy and important. It held the<br/>
position of a port on the Nile for merchandise from a very<br/>
early period<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and there is no doubt that every Egyptian<br/>
king who sent expeditions to Punt, and the countries round<br/>
about, found Koft most usefully situated for this purpose.<br/>
A temple dedicated to the ithyphallic god Amsu, Isis and<br/>
Osiris, stood here. It was nearly destroyed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diocletian </span>A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">292</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>A copy of a medical papyrus in the<br/>
British Museum states that the work was originally <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>covered at Coptos during the time of Cheops, a king of<br/>
the IVth dynasty; it is certain then that the Egyptians<br/>
considered this city to be of very old foundation.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">NAKADAH</span>, 428 miles from Cairo, on the west bank of<br/>
the river, nearly opposite the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarah</span>, was the<br/>
home of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large number of Copts in early Christian times,<br/>
and several monasteries were situated there. The four<br/>
which now remain are dedicated to the Cross, <span style="color: #ff0000;">St</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Michael,<br/>
St. Victor, and St. George respectively, and tradition says<br/>
that they were founded by the Empress Helena; the most<br/>
important of them is that of St. Michael. The church in<br/>
this monastery "is one of the most remarkable Christian<br/>
structures in Egypt, possessing as it does some unique<br/>
peculiarities. There are four churches, of which three<br/>
stand side by side in such a manner that they have a single<br/>
continuous western wall. Two of the four have an apsidal<br/>
haikal with <span style="color: #ff0000;">rectagular </span>side chapels, while the other two are<br/>
entirely rectangular; but the two apses differ from all other<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">apses </span>in Egyptian churches by projecting... beyond the<br/>
eastern wall and by showing an outward curvature. They<br/>
form a solitary exception to the rule that the Coptic apse is<br/>
