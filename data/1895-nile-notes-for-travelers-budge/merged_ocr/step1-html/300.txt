<span>276 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
A reservoir was made for them with a sort of stage on<br/>
one of the sides, to form a basking place for them on<br/>
coming out of the water, and these persons went into<br/>
the water, drew them in a net to the place, where they<br/>
might sun themselves and be exhibited, and then dragged<br/>
them back again to the reservoir. The people of Tentyra<br/>
worship Venus. At the back of the fane of Venus is<br/>
a temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>then follow what are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Typhoneia</span>,<br/>
and the canal leading to Coptos, a city common both to<br/>
the Egyptians and Arabians." (Falconer's translation.)<br/>
It will be remembered that Juvenal witnessed a fight<br/>
between the crocodile worshippers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombo </span>and the<br/>
crocodile haters of Tentyra.<br/>
<br/>
On the walls and on various other parts of the temples are<br/>
the names of several of the Roman Emperors<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the famous<br/>
portraits of Cleopatra and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesarion </span>her son are on the<br/>
end wall of the exterior. Passing along a dromos for about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>feet, the portico, A, open at the top, and supported<br/>
by twenty-four Hathor-headed columns, arranged in six rows,<br/>
is reached. Leaving this hall by the doorway facing the<br/>
entrance, the visitor arrives in a second hall, B, having six<br/>
columns and three small chambers on <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>side. The two<br/>
chambers C and D have smaller chambers on the right<br/>
and left, E was the so-called sanctuary, and in F the emblem<br/>
of the god worshipped in the temple was placed. From a<br/>
room on each side of C a staircase led up to the roof.<br/>
The purposes for which the chambers were used are stated<br/>
by M. Mariette in his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dend'eralt</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Descrip</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">GÃ©n</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">0'11 </span>Grand<br/>
Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">tire </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wile </span>ville. On the ceiling of the portico is the<br/>
famous "Zodiac," which was thought to have been made in<br/>
ancient Egyptian times; the Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D. </span>35,<br/>
written in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-frst </span>year of Tiberius, and the names<br/>
of the Roman Emperors, have clearly proved that, like that<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, it belongs to the Roman time. The Zodiac<br/>
from Denderah, now at Paris, was cut out, with the permis<br/>
