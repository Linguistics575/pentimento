<span>110 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
into them part of that wonderfully grateful odour which<br/>
<br/>
issued from her own body..... The queen therefore<br/>
sent for her to court, and after a further acquaintance with<br/>
her, made her nurse to one of her sons..... The<br/>
<br/>
goddess, discovering herself, requested that the pillar which<br/>
supported the roof of the king's house might be given to<br/>
her<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which she accordingly took down, and then easily<br/>
cutting it open, after she had taken out what she wanted,<br/>
she wrapt up the remainder of the trunk in <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>linen, and<br/>
pouring perfumed oil upon it, delivered it into the hands<br/>
of the king and queen...... <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>this was done, she<br/>
threw herself upon the chest, making at the same time such<br/>
a loud and terrible lamentation over it as frighted the<br/>
younger of the king's sons who heard her out of his life.<br/>
But the elder of them she took with her, and set sail with<br/>
the chest for Egypt.....<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o </span>sooner was she arrived in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>desert place, where she<br/>
imagined herself to be alone, but she presently opened the<br/>
chest, and laying her face upon her dead husband's,<br/>
embraced his corpse, and wept bitterly.<br/>
<br/>
"Isis intending a visit to her son Horus, who was brought<br/>
up at Butus, deposited the chest in the meanwhile in a<br/>
remote and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequented </span>place; Typhon, however, as he<br/>
was one night hunting by the light of the moon accidentally<br/>
met with it<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and knowing the body which was enclosed in<br/>
it, tore it into several pieces, fourteen in all, dispersing them<br/>
up and down in different parts of the country. Upon being<br/>
made acquainted with this event, Isis once more sets out in<br/>
search of the scattered fragments of her <span style="color: #ff0000;">huslrand</span>'s body,<br/>
making use of a boat made of the reed papyrus in order the<br/>
more easily to pass through the lower and fenny parts of<br/>
the country. For which reason, say they, the crocodile<br/>
never touches any persons who sail in this sort of vessel, as<br/>
either fearing the anger of the goddess, or else respecting it<br/>
on <span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>its having once carried her. To this occasion,<br/>
