work of the same person who constructed those at Abydos<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Thebes; for in those places, it is said, are some<br/>
Memnonia. At Abydos Osiris is worshipped; but in the<br/>
temple of Osiris no singer, nor player on the pipe, nor on<br/>
the cithara, is permitted to perform at the commencement<br/>
of the ceremonies celebrated in honour of the god, as is<br/>
usual in rites celebrated in honour of the gods." (Bk. XVII.<br/>

<br/>
</span>The Temple of Seti I., better known as the Memnonium, is built of fine white calcareous stone upon an<br/>
artificial foundation made of stone, earth and sand, which has<br/>
been laid upon a sloping piece of land; it was called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mst-Rad </span>after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prenomen </span>of its builder. The Phoenician<br/>
graffiti show that the temple must have ceased to be used<br/>
at a comparatively early period. It would seem that it was<br/>
nearly finished when Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>died, and that his son Rameses<br/>
II. only added the pillars in front and the decoration.<br/>
Its exterior consists of two courts, A and B, the wall which<br/>
divides them, and the facade; <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>these parts were built by<br/>
Rameses II. The pillars are inscribed with religious scenes<br/>
and figures of the king and the god Osiris. On the large<br/>
wall to the south of the central door is an inscription in<br/>
which Rameses II. relates all that he has done for the<br/>
honour of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">father</span>'s memory, how he erected statues of<br/>
