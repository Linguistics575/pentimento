</span>(Alexandria) to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">At'l'anis </span>he brought to light valuable monuments belonging to the XIIIth, XIVth, XIXth<br/>

antiquities from the collection under his charge at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btlkili</span>.<br/>
In 1870 he was <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtaken </span>by severe domestic troubles, and<br/>
a disease which had some years before fastened upon him<br/>
now began to show signs of serious progress. Notwithstanding his <span style="color: #ff0000;">iniirmities</span>, however, he continued to edit and<br/>
publish the texts from the monuments which he had discovered, and remained hard at work until his death, which<br/>
took place at Cairo on January 17th, 1881. His body was<br/>
entombed in a marble sarcophagus which stood in the<br/>
court-yard of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jh1kllc </span>Museum, and which has <span style="color: #0000FF;">since </span>been<br/>
removed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gizeh</span>, together with the antiquities of the<br/>
Museum.<br/>
