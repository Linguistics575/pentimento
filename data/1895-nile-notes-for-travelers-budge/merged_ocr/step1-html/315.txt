Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the builder of this hall, set up seventy-nine, and<br/>
the remaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty-four </span>were set up by Rameses II. It<br/>
is thought that this hall was originally roofed over. At<br/>
the end of it is the third propylon, which was built by<br/>
Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span>, and served as the entrance to the temple<br/>
until the time of Rameses I. Between this and the next<br/>
pylon is a narrow passage, in the middle of which stood two<br/>
obelisks which were set up by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>; the southern<br/>
one is still standing, and bears the names of this king, but<br/>
the northern one has fallen,' and its fragments show that<br/>
Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>caused his name to be carved on it. At the<br/>
southern end of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span>are the remains of a gate built<br/>
by Rameses IX. The fourth and fifth pylons were built by<br/>
Thothmes I. Between them stood fourteen columns, six of<br/>
which were set up by Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, and eight by Amenophis<br/>
II, and two granite obelisks; one of these still stands.<br/>
These <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>were hewn out of the granite quarry by the<br/>
command of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wttshepset</span>, t the daughter of Thothmes 1., and<br/>
sister of Thothmes II. and Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. This able<br/>
woman set them up in honour of "father Amen," and<br/>
she relates in the inscriptions on the base of the standing<br/>
obelisk that she covered their tops with <span style="color: #0000FF;">smu </span>metal, or copper,<br/>
that they could be seen from a very great distance, and that<br/>
she had them hewn and brought down to Thebes in about<br/>
seven months. These obelisks were brought into <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span>chamber from the south side, and were 98 and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lot </span>feet high"<br/>
respectively; the masonry round their bases is of the time<br/>
of Thothmes III. The sixth pylon and the two walls which<br/>

, "Scarcely had the <span style="color: #0000FF;">royal </span>brother and husband of Hashop (sic)<br/>
closed his eyes, when the proud queen threw aside her woman's veil,<br/>
and appeared in all the splendour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaoh</span>, as a born king. For she<br/>
laid aside her woman's dress, clothed herself in man's attire, and<br/>
adorned herself with the crown and insignia of royalty." (Brugsch's<br/>
