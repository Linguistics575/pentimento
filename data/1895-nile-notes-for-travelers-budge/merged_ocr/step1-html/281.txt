There are about fifteen rock-tombs at Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan</span>, but<br/>
only two of them, those of Ameni and Chnemu-hetep, are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interest </span>generally speaking. They were all hewn during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIIth </span>dynasty, but have preserved the chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salrlpirah</span>, that is to say, they<br/>
consist of a chamber and a shaft leading down to a corridor,<br/>
which ends in the chamber containing the sarcophagus and<br/>
the mummy. As in the tombs at Aswan, a suitable layer<br/>
of stone was sought for in the hill, and when found the<br/>
tombs were hewn out. The walls were partly smoothed,<br/>
and then covered with a thin layer of plaster upon which<br/>
the scenes in the lives of the people buried there might be<br/>
painted. The columns and the lower parts of some of the<br/>
tombs are coloured red to resemble granite. The northern<br/>
tomb is remarkable for columns somewhat resembling those<br/>
subsequently termed Doric. Each of the four columns in<br/>
the tomb is about I7 feet high, and has sixteen sides<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
ceiling between each connecting beam, which runs from<br/>
column to column, is vaulted<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The columns in the<br/>
southern tombs have lotus capitals, and are exceedingly<br/>
graceful.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Ameni belongs to the northern group<br/>
of tombs<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>he is not the head of the family which was buried<br/>
at Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan</span>, as has been sometimes asserted, for he<br/>
had no children. <span style="color: #ff0000;">IRecueil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Travatix</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, p. 175.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">AmeniAmenemhat </span>lived during the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the second<br/>
king of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIIth </span>dynasty<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>he was <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the feudal lords<br/>
of Egypt, and chief of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Melo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoii</span>, and<br/>
chief president of the prophets. When quite a young man<br/>
he was sent in the place of his father, who was too old for<br/>
such work, to Ethiopia at the head of an army<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>he settled the<br/>
frontiers of the country there, and came back to the king<br/>
laden with spoil and tribute<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In many other expeditions he<br/>
was also perfectly successful. In the inscription on the tomb<br/>
he says, "I have done all <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>I have said. I am a gracious<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">s<br/>
