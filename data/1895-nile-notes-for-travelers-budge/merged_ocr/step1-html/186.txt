<br/>
</span>Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan, Ingénieur civil<br/>
des Mines, was born on June 3rd, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1857</span>, at the Chateau de<br/>
Bion, Loir-et-Cher, and is descended from a family which<br/>
came originally from Wales. For more than twenty<br/>
years he has devoted <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself-to </span>the study of archaeology,<br/>
but he is, nevertheless, a distinguished pupil of the School<br/>
of Mines at Paris, and is eminent as a geologist and<br/>
mathematician. To the exactness induced by the study of<br/>
mathematics, and to his scientific training as a geologist<br/>
and observer of nature, his works entirely owe their value,<br/>
for he arranges his historical, geographical, and other facts<br/>
in a logical manner, and never confounds fact with theory<br/>
or assumption with evidence. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1882 </span>he made a tour<br/>
through India for scientific purposes, and in the same year<br/>
he published his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Géo/ogz'e </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">de </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bohtme</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">8vo</span>. In 1884 he<br/>
undertook an expedition to Siam and the neighbouring<br/>
countries, and in the following year he published some<br/>
account of his work in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Exploration </span>dans hr <span style="color: #ff0000;">tresip</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ue<br/>
</span>Malaisie, Rouen, 1885. In this year we also find him contributing articles to the newspaper <span style="color: #0000FF;">L'Homme </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">/ </span>and in 1886<br/>
he published in the Annales des Mines an important article<br/>
entitled, Note <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sttt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">glvlogit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">T'iruluttrie </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">vuhilre </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>

employed on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>mission to Turkey-in-Asia, the Caucasus<br/>
and Armenia, and he published the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>results of his<br/>
travels in two volumes, large <span style="color: #0000FF;">8vo</span>, entitled, Mission <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scimtijique </span>(m <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caucase</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">iywdes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">v1rdalogiques </span>et <span style="color: #0000FF;">historiques</span>,<br/>
Paris, 1889. In this work <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>de Morgan shows that he is<br/>
well acquainted with the statements about these countries<br/>
made by classical writers, that he is familiar with the best<br/>
works upon general archaeology, such as those of Sir John<br/>
Evans, Montelius and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mourier</span>, and also that he knows well<br/>
the works of Brugsch, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero</span>, George Smith, and of other<br/>
scholars of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assyriology </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Egyptology at first hand. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From<br/>
</span>1889 to the beginning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1892 </span>M. de Morgan made an<br/>
