<br/>
</span>aisle, choir, and three altars eastward each in its own<br/>
chapel: of these the central and southern chapels are<br/>
apsidal, the northern is square ended...... Over the<br/>
aisles and narthex runs <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>continuous gallery or triforium,<br/>
which originally served as the place for women at the<br/>
service. On the north side it stops short at the choir<br/>
forming a kind of transept, which, however, does not project<br/>
beyond the north aisle...... On the south side of<br/>
the church <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">triforium </span>is prolonged over the choir and over<br/>
the south side-chapel<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The gallery is <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat-roofed </span>while<br/>
the nave is covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pointed roof with framed principals like that at Abu's <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séfén</span>...... Outside, the roof<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu </span>Sargah is plastered over with cement showing<br/>
the king-posts projecting above the ridge-piece. Over the<br/>
central part of the choir and over the haikal the roof<br/>
changes to a <span style="color: #ff0000;">wagon-vaulting</span>; it is flat over the north<br/>
transept, and a lofty dome overshadows the north aisle<br/>
chapel...... The twelve monolithic columns round<br/>
the nave are all, with one exception, of white marble<br/>
streaked with dusky lines...... The exceptional column<br/>
is of red <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuhn </span>granite, 22 inches in diameter......<br/>
The wooden pulpit...... is of rosewood inlaid with<br/>
designs in ebony set with ivory edgings...... The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">haikal-screen </span>projects forward into the choir as at Al<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Adra</span>...... and is of very ancient and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">workman</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ship</span>; pentagons and other shapes of solid ivory, carved<br/>
in relief with <span style="color: #0000FF;">arabesques</span>, being inlaid and set round<br/>
with rich mouldings...... The upper part of the screen<br/>
contains square panels of ebony set with large crosses of<br/>
solid ivory, most exquisitely chiselled with <span style="color: #0000FF;">scrollwork</span>, and<br/>
panels of ebony carved through in work of the most delicate<br/>
and skilful <span style="color: #0000FF;">finish</span>."

The early carvings representing St. Demetrius,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mir </span>George, Abu's <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séfén</span>, the Nativity, and the Last Supper,<br/>
are worthy of careful examination.<br/>
