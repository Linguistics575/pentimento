THE PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH.<br/>
<br/>
On the western bank of the Nile, from Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roash </span>on<br/>
the north to <span style="color: #ff0000;">MÃ©dtom </span>on the south, is a slightly elevated<br/>
tract of land, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>miles long, on the edge of<br/>
the Libyan desert, on which stand the pyramids of Abu<br/>
Roash, Gizeh, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ltwyet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Aryitn</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abusir</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sal.dpirah</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahslulr</span>. Other places in Egypt where pyramids are found<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-lah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ayytlm</span>, and Kullah near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>. The<br/>
pyramids built by the Ethiopians at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merci </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>and Gebel<br/>
Barkal are of a very late date (<span style="color: #0000FF;">15.0</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">6ocr-roo</span>), and are<br/>
mere copies, in respect of form only, of the pyramids in<br/>
Egypt. It is well to state at once that the pyramids<br/>
were tombs and nothing else. There is no evidence<br/>
whatever to show that they were built for purposes of<br/>
astronomical observations, and the theory that the Great<br/>
Pyramid was built to serve as a standard of measurement is<br/>
ingenious but worthless. The significant fact, so ably<br/>
pointed out by Mariette, that pyramids are only found in<br/>
cemeteries, is an answer to all such theories. Tomb-pyramids<br/>
were built by kings and others until the XIIth dynasty.<br/>
The ancient writers who have described and treated of the<br/>
pyramids are given by Pliny (Nat. Hist., xxxvi. 12, 17). If<br/>
we may believe some of the writers on them during the<br/>
Middle Ages, their outsides must have been covered with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Inscriptions</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>these were probably of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">nature</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>In<br/>
modern times they have been examined by Shaw (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1721</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">NWW</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Le-lum</span>, "mouth of the canal<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic<br/>
