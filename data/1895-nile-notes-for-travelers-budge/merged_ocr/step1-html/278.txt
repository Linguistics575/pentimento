UPPER EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maghiighah</span>, 106 miles from Cairo, is now celebrated for<br/>
its large sugar manufactory, which is lighted by gas, and is<br/>
well worth a visit; the manufacturing of sugar begins here<br/>
early in January.<br/>
<br/>
About twenty-four miles farther south, lying inland, on<br/>
the western side of the Nile, between the river and the<br/>
Babr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yt1suf</span>, is the site of the town of Oxyrhyncus, so called<br/>
by the Greeks on account of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>which they believed<br/>
was worshipped there. The Egyptian name of the town<br/>
<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">[</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pa-miit'et</span>, from which came the Coptic<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pemge</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">( </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">311.256</span>, and the corrupt Arabic form <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behnesa</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A little above Abu Girgeh, on the west bank of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>,<br/>
is the town of El-Kais, which marks the site of the ancient<br/>
Cynopolis or "Dog-city,"' it was the seat of a Coptic bishop,<br/>
and is called Kais, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rue</span>, in Coptic.<br/>
<br/>
Thirteen miles from Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Girgeh</span>, also on the west bank<br/>
of the Nile, is the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">JCliis.sanah</span>, 134 miles from Cairo,<br/>
and a few miles south, lying inland, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">SamalhU</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Farther south, on the east bank of the Nile, is Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">er</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Th</span>, or the "Bird mountain," so called because tradition<br/>
says that all the birds of Egypt assemble here once a year,<br/>
and that they leave behind them when departing one solitary<br/>
bird, that remains there until they return the following year<br/>
to relieve him of his watch, and to set another in his place.<br/>
As there are mountains called Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Tér </span>in all parts of<br/>
Arabic-speaking countries, because of the number of birds<br/>
which frequent them, the story is only one which springs<br/>
from the fertile Arab imagination. Gebel et-Tér rises<br/>
above the river to a height of six or seven hundred feet, and<br/>
upon its summit stands a Coptic convent dedicated to Mary<br/>
<br/>
