</span>ALEXANDRIA<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Among archaeologists of all nationalities for some years<br/>
past the conviction has been growing that systematic excavations should be undertaken at Alexandria: it was felt<br/>
that but little of a serious nature had been done, and<br/>
that unless work were begun soon the few sites available<br/>
for excavation would be built over, and that the chance of<br/>
the discovery either of new information or "<span style="color: #ff0000;">finds</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>would<br/>
be lost for ever. As it is, building operations have<br/>
advanced with extraordinary rapidity, and what the builder<br/>
leaves the sea claims. There seems little chance of<br/>
discovering any portions of the great libraries which<br/>
flourished at Alexandria in its palmy days, and there is<br/>
equally little chance that any of its famous buildings<br/>
remain to be discovered; the utmost that may be hoped<br/>
for is the recovery of monuments and inscriptions of the<br/>
late Graeco-Roman period. The cuttings of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">AlexandriaRamleh </span>railway, and private diggings made for laying<br/>
foundations of houses and drains, have yielded a number<br/>
of interesting objects, but they have added comparatively<br/>
little to our knowledge. To preserve these remains in a<br/>
systematic manner, the municipality of Alexandria founded<br/>
a museum, the direction of which has been placed under<br/>
the able care of M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Betti</span>; here are exhibited a most<br/>
interesting series of monuments typical of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypto-Graeco<br/>
</span>art during the period of the rule of the Ptolemies <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>during the early centuries of the Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">era</span>. The<br/>
collection has been added to steadily, and learned bodies<br/>
