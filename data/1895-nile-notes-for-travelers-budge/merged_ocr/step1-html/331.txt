visible the cartouche and other signs which indicated that<br/>
the inhabitants of the coffins were royal personages. The<br/>
native who was so fortunate as to have chanced upon this<br/>
remarkable "find," was <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>skilled in his trade of<br/>
antiquity hunter to know what <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>valuable discovery he had<br/>
made<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>his joy must however have been turned into mourning, when it became evident that he would need the help of<br/>
many men even to move some of the large royal coffins<br/>
which he saw before him, and that he could not keep<br/>
the knowledge of such treasures locked up in his own<br/>
breast. He revealed his secret to his two brothers and<br/>
to one of his sons, and they proceeded to spoil the<br/>
coffins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ushabtiue </span>figures, papyri, scarabs and other<br/>
antiquities which could be taken away easily and concealed in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">abbas </span>(ample outer garments) as they <span style="color: #ff0000;">returned </span>to their houses. These precious objects were for<br/>
several winters sold to chance tourists on the Nile, and the<br/>
lucky possessors of this mine of wealth replenished their<br/>
stores from time to time by visits made at night to the tomb<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>As soon as the objects thus sold reached Europe, it was at<br/>
once suspected that a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">find</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>of more than ordinary<br/>
importance had been made. An English officer called<br/>
Campbell <span style="color: #0000FF;">showed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Maspero a hieratic Book of the Dead<br/>
written for Pi-net'em<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>M. de Saulcy sent him photographs<br/>
of the hieroglyphic papyrus of Net'emet; <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Mariette<br/>
bought at Suez a papyrus written for the Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wnt-taiu</span>,<br/>
and Rogers Bey exhibited at Paris a wooden tablet<br/>
upon which was written a hieratic text relating to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ushabtiu </span>figures which were to be buried with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prim<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cess </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NesrChensu</span>. All these interesting and most valuable<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ushabtiu </span>figures made of stone, green or blue glazed Egyptian<br/>
porcelain, wood, & <span style="color: #0000FF;">c.</span>, were deposited in the tombs with the dead, and<br/>
were supposed to perform for them any field labours which might be<br/>
decreed for them by Osiris, the king of the under-world, and judge of<br/>
the dead.<br/>
