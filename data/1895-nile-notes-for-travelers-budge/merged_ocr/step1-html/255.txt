<span>THE PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">GiZEH</span>. 231<br/>
<br/>
god, thou shalt nevermore have enemies, 0 king of the<br/>
North and South, Men-kau-Ra, living for ever<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>" This<br/>
formula is one which is found upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>down to the<br/>
latest period, but as the date of Mycerinus is known, it is<br/>
possible to draw some interesting and valuable conclusions<br/>
from the fact that it is found upon his coffin. It proves<br/>
that as far back as 3,600 years before Christ the Egyptian<br/>
religion was established on a firm base, that the doctrine of<br/>
immortality was already deeply rooted in the human mind.<br/>
The art of preserving the human body by embalming was<br/>
also well understood and generally practised at that early<br/>
date<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men-kau-Ra</span>, like that of Chephren, is<br/>
built upon a rock with a sloping surface<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the inequality of<br/>
the surface in this case has been made level by <span style="color: #0000FF;">building </span>up courses of large blocks of stones. Around the<br/>
lower part the remains of the old granite covering are<br/>
visible to a depth of from 30 to 40 feet. It is unfortunate<br/>
that this pyramid has been so much damaged; its injuries,<br/>
however, enable the visitor to see exactly how it was built,<br/>
and it may be concluded that the pyramids of Cheops and<br/>
Chephren were built in the same manner. The length of<br/>
each side at the base is about 350 feet, and its height is<br/>
variously given as 210 and 215 feet. The entrance is on<br/>
the north side, about thirteen feet above the ground, and a<br/>
descending corridor about 104 feet long, passing through an<br/>
ante-chamber, having a series of three granite doors, leads<br/>
into one chamber about 40 feet long, and a second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Charm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">her </span>about 44 long. In this last chamber is a shaft<br/>
which leads down to the granite-lined chamber about<br/>
twenty feet below, in which were found the sarcophagus and<br/>
wooden coffin of Mycerinus, and the remains of a human<br/>
body. It is thought that, in spite of the body of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mycerinus </span>being buried in this pyramid, it was left unfinished<br/>
at the death of this king, and that a succeeding ruler of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
