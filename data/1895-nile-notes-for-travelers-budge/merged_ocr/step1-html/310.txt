</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>The Temple of Luxor. Compared with Karnak<br/>
the temple of Luxor is not of any great interest. Until very<br/>
recently a large portion of the buildings, connected in<br/>
ancient days with the temple, was quite buried by the<br/>
accumulated rubbish and earth upon which a large number<br/>
of houses stood. During the last few years excavations<br/>
have been made by the Egyptian Government, and some<br/>
interesting results have been obtained. Among the antiquities thus brought to light may be mentioned a fine granite<br/>
statue of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, the existence of which was never<br/>
imagined. The temple of Luxor was built on an irregular<br/>
plan caused by following the course of the river, out of the<br/>
waters of which its walls, on one side, rose<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it was founded<br/>
by Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.</span>, about B.C. 1500. About forty years<br/>
after, <span style="color: #0000FF;">f.leru-em-heb </span>added the great colonnade, and as the<br/>
name of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1366</span>, occurs in places, it is probable<br/>
that he executed some repairs to the temple. His son<br/>
Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, B.C. 1333, set up two obelisks together with the<br/>
colossi and the large pylon; the large court, nearly 200 feet<br/>
square, behind the pylon, was surrounded by a double row<br/>
of columns. The Obelisk now standing there records<br/>
the names, titles, ctc., of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, and stands about<br/>
82 feet high; it is one of the finest specimens of sculpture<br/>
