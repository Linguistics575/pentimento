scene which forms the vignette of the 125th chapter of the<br/>
Book of the Dead, hence the funereal nature of the building<br/>
may be inferred.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">VII</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dér </span>el-Bahari. This temple was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witshepset</span>, the sister and wife of Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, B.C. 1600. The<br/>
finest marble limestone was used in its construction, and its<br/>
architect seems to have been an able man called Senmut,<br/>
who was honoured with the friendship of the queen, and<br/>
promoted by her to be chief clerk of the works. Before the<br/>
temple was an avenue of sandstone sphinxes and two<br/>
obelisks. It was built in stages on the side of a hill, and<br/>
its courts were connected by means of flights of steps.<br/>
As early as the XXIInd dynasty the temple had fallen into<br/>
disuse, and soon after this time its chambers appear to have<br/>
been used for sepulchres. The wall sculptures are beautiful<br/>
specimens of art, and depict the return of Egyptian soldiers<br/>
from some military expedition, and the scenes which took<br/>
place during the expedition which the queen organized and<br/>
sent off to Punt. This latter expedition was most successful,<br/>
and returned to Egypt laden with things the "like of which<br/>
had never before been seen in that land." The prince of<br/>
Punt came to Egypt with a large following, and became a<br/>
vassal of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witshepset</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">*<br/>
