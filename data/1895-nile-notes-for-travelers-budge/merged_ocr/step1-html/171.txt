<span>CAIRO. <span style="color: #0000FF;">147<br/>
<br/>
</span>stones used were taken from the pyramids of Gizeh<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it<br/>
formed a part of the large system of the fortifications of<br/>
Cairo which this Sultan carried out so thoroughly. Though<br/>
admirably situated for commanding the whole city, and as a<br/>
fortress in the days before long range cannon were invented,<br/>
the site was shown in 1805 to be ill <span style="color: #0000FF;">chosen </span>for the purposes<br/>
of defence in modern times by Muhammad'Ali, who, by<br/>
means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>battery placed on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moliattam </span>heights, <span style="color: #0000FF;">compelled </span>Khurshid Pasha to surrender the citadel. In the<br/>
narrow way, with a high wall, through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bill</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Arab</span>,<br/>
which was formerly the most direct and most used means of<br/>
access to it, the massacre of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>took place by<br/>
the orders of Muhammad'Ali, A.D. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1811</span>. The single<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>who escaped is said to have made his horse leap<br/>
down from one of the walls of the Citadel; he refused to<br/>
enter the narrow way<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>JOSEPH'S WELL.<br/>
<br/>
This well is not called after Joseph the Patriarch, as is<br/>
usually supposed, but after the famous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sal√©heddin </span>(Saladin),<br/>
whose first name was <span style="color: #ff0000;">VC1suf </span>or Joseph. The shaft of this<br/>
well, in two parts, is about 280 feet deep, and was found<br/>
to be choked up with sand when the Citadel was built;<br/>
Saladin caused it to be cleared out, and from his time until<br/>
1865 its water was regularly drawn up and used. This<br/>
well was probably sunk by the ancient Egyptians.<br/>
