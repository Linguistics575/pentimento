According to Manetho, there reigned over Egypt before<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mend</span>, or Menes, the first mortal king of that country, a<br/>
number of beings called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shesu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hem</span>, or "followers of<br/>
Horus"; of their deeds and history nothing is known.<br/>
Some have believed that during their rule Egypt was<br/>
divided into two parts, each ruled by its own king; and<br/>
others have thought that the whole of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt was divided into a large series of small, independent<br/>
principalities, which were united under one head in the<br/>
person of Menes. There is, however, no support to be<br/>
obtained from the inscriptions for either of these theories.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">kings </span>of Egypt following after the mythical period are<br/>
divided into thirty dynasties. For the sake of convenience,<br/>
Egyptian history is divided into three periods: <span style="color: #ff0000;">-l</span>, the<br/>
Ancient Empire, which includes the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">eleven </span>dynasties; II, the Middle Empire, which includes the next<br/>
nine dynasties (<span style="color: #0000FF;">XIIth-XXth</span>); and, III, the New Empire,<br/>
which includes the remaining ten dynasties, one of which<br/>
was of Persian kings. The rule of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suite </span>kings was followed by that of the Persians, Ptolemies and Romans.<br/>
The rule of the Arabs which began A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">641</span>, ended <span style="color: #ff0000;">A.D</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">517</span>, when the country was conquered by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks</span>; since<br/>
this time Egypt has been nominally <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pashalik of Turkey.<br/>
<br/>
The date assigned to the first dynasty is variously given<br/>
by different scholars: by Champollion-Figeac it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>5867,<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lieblein </span>3893, by Mariette 5004, and by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch </span>4400.<br/>
As far as can be seen, there is much to be said in favour<br/>
of that given by Brugsch, and his dates are adopted<br/>
throughout in this book.<br/>
