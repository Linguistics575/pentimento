<span>102 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
Thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">sendest </span>forth rays in rising from thy two beautiful<br/>
eyes. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">pit </span>(ancestors, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lie</span>, the dead) are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">rapture </span>of<br/>
delight when thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">shinest</span>, the cattle become languid when<br/>
thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">shinest </span>in full strength; thou art loved when <span style="color: #0000FF;">thou </span>art<br/>
in the sky of the south, thou art esteemed pleasant in the<br/>
sky of the north. Thy beauties seize and carry away all<br/>
hearts, the love of thee makes the arms drop; thy beautiful<br/>
creation makes the hands tremble, and (all) hearts to melt<br/>
at the sight of thee.<br/>
<br/>
"O Form, ONE, creator of all things, <span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span>ONE, ONLY,<br/>
maker of <span style="color: #0000FF;">existences</span>! Men came forth from his two eyes,<br/>
the gods sprang into existence at the utterance of his mouth.<br/>
He maketh the green herb to make cattle live, and the staff<br/>
of life for the (use of) man. He maketh the fishes to live<br/>
in the rivers, the winged fowl in the sky; he giveth the<br/>
breath of life to (the germ) in the egg, he maketh birds of<br/>
all kinds to <span style="color: #0000FF;">live</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>likewise the reptiles that creep and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fly</span>; he <span style="color: #ff0000;">causeth </span>the rats to live in their holes, and the birds<br/>
that are on every green twig. Hail to thee, <span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>maker of<br/>
all these things, thou ONLY ONE.<br/>
<br/>
"He is of many forms in his might! He watches all<br/>
people who sleep, he seeks the good for his brute creation.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>Amen, establisher of all things, Atmu and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
</span>all people adore thee, saying,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Praise </span>to thee because of thy<br/>
resting among us; homage to thee because thou hast<br/>
created us.' All creatures say'Hail to thee,' and all<br/>
lands praise thee; from the height of the sky, to the<br/>
breadth of the earth, and to the depths of the sea art thou<br/>
praised. The gods bow down before thy majesty to exalt<br/>
the Will of their creator; they rejoice when they meet<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">begetter</span>, and say to thee, Come in peace, <span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span>father<br/>
of the fathers of all the gods, who hast spread out the sky<br/>
and hast founded the earth, maker of things which are,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;"># </span>These three names are the names of the Sun-god at mid-day,<br/>
evening and morning respectively.<br/>
