<span>298 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
On the west bank of the river the following are the<br/>
most interesting antiquities <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--<br/>
</span>I. The Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1p1rnah</span>. This temple was built<br/>
by Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>in memory of his father Rameses I.; it was<br/>
completed by Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, by whom it was re-dedicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the memory of his father Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. Two pylons stood before<br/>
it, and between them was an avenue of sphinxes. This<br/>
temple was to all intents and purposes a cenotaph, and<br/>
as such its position on the edge of the desert, at the<br/>
entrance to a necropolis, is explained. In the temple<br/>
were six columns, and on each side were several small<br/>
chambers. The sculptures on the walls represent Rameses 11.<br/>
making offerings to the gods, among whom are Rameses I.<br/>
and Seti I. According to an inscription there, it is said<br/>
that Seti I. went to heaven and was united with the Sun-god<br/>
before this temple was finished, and that Rameses II. made<br/>
and fixed the doors, finished the building of the walls,<br/>
and decorated the interior. The workmanship in certain<br/>
parts of this temple recalls that of certain parts of Abydos;<br/>
it is probable that the same artists were employed.<br/>
<br/>
II. The Ramesseum<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>temple, called also the<br/>
MEMNONIUM and the tomb of Osymandyas (Diodorus <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>
iv), was built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II.</span>, in honour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span>.<br/>
As at <span style="color: #ff0000;">J.GIrnah</span>, two pylons stood in front of it. The<br/>
first court had a double row of pillars on each side of<br/>
it; passing up a flight of steps, and through the second<br/>
pylon, is a second court, having a double row of round<br/>
columns on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">east </span>and west sides, and a row of pilasters,<br/>
to which large figures of Rameses II. under the form of<br/>
Osiris are attached, on the north and south sides<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Before<br/>
the second pylon stood a colossal statue of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>,<br/>
at least sixty feet high, which has been thrown down (by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>), turned over on its back, and mutilated. In<br/>
the hall are twelve huge columns, arranged in two rows,<br/>
and thirty-six smaller ones arranged in six rows. On the<br/>
