elected patriarch of Abu Sargah; the church was most<br/>
probably built much earlier, and some go so far as to state<br/>
that the crypt (20 feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">x </span>15 feet) was occupied by the<br/>
Virgin and her Son when they fled to Egypt to avoid the<br/>
wrath of Herod. "The general shape of the church is, or<br/>
was, a nearly regular oblong, and its general structure is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">basilican</span>. It consists of narthex, nave, north and south<br/>
