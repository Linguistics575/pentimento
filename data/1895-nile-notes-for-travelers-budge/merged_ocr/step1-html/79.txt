</span>The Society of Antiquaries published a fac-simile of the<br/>
inscription, which was distributed among scholars, and<br/>
Silvestre de Sacy and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Akerblad </span>made some useful discoveries about certain parts of the demotic version of the<br/>
inscription. Dr. Young was enabled, ten years after, to make<br/>
translations of the three inscriptions, and the results of his<br/>
studies were published in 1821. In 1822 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Champollion </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Le </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jeune</span>) published <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>translation of the same inscriptions,<br/>
and was enabled to make out something like an alphabet.<br/>
There appears to be no doubt that he was greatly helped<br/>
by the publications and labours of Young, who had succeeded<br/>
in grouping certain words in demotic, and in assigning accurate values to some of the hieroglyphic characters used in<br/>
writing the names of the Greek rulers of Egypt. Young<br/>
made many mistakes, but some of his work was of value,<br/>
Champollion, to whom the credit of definitely settling the<br/>
phonetic values of several signs really belongs, had been<br/>
carefully grounded in the Coptic language, and was therefore enabled with little difficulty to recognize the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span>forms of the words which were familiar to him in<br/>
Coptic; Young had no such advantage. Champollion's<br/>
system was subjected to many attacks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>little by little it<br/>
gained ground, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">labours </span>of other scholars have<br/>
<br/>
Italian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hebrew</span>, Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic</span>. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>his degree of M.D. in<br/>
July, 1796, in 1802 he was appointed professor of natural philosophy<br/>
at the Royal Institution, and in 1810 he was elected physician to<br/>
St. George's Hospital. He was not, however, a popular physician.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>died on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">10th </span>of May, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1829</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Jean <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francois </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion </span>le Jeune was <span style="color: #0000FF;">born </span>at Figeac, department Du Lot, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1796</span>. He was educated at Grenoble, and afterwards<br/>
at Paris, where he devoted himself to the study of Coptic<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the<br/>
year 1824 he was ordered by Charles X. to visit all the important<br/>
collections of Egyptian antiquities in Europe. On his return he was<br/>
appointed Director <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Louvre. In 1828 he was sent <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a scientific<br/>
mission to Egypt, and was afterwards made professor of Egyptian<br/>
antiquities at the College de France. He died in 1831.<br/>
