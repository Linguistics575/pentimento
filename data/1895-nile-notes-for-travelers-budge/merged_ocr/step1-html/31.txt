<span>EGYPTIAN HISTORY. 7<br/>
<br/>
Manetho, and Diodorus Siculus. Herodotus devotes the<br/>
whole of the second and the beginning of the third book<br/>
of his work to a history of Egypt and the Egyptians, and his<br/>
is the oldest Greek treatise on the subject known to us.<br/>
In spite of the attacks made upon his work during the<br/>
last few years, the evidence of the hieroglyphic inscriptions<br/>
which are being deciphered year after year shows that on<br/>
the whole his work is trustworthy. A work more valuable<br/>
than that of Herodotus is the Egyptian history of Manetho<br/>
(still living in B.C. 271) of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebennytus</span>, who is said by<br/>
Plutarch to have been a contemporary of Ptolemy L; his<br/>
work, however, was written during the reign of Ptolemy II.<br/>
Philadelphus (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.c</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">286447</span>). According to words put into<br/>
his mouth, he was chief priest and scribe in one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
temples of Egypt, and he appears to have been perfectly<br/>
acquainted with the ancient Egyptian language and literature.<br/>
He had also had the benefit of a Greek education, and<br/>
was therefore peculiarly fitted to draw up in Greek for<br/>
Ptolemy Philadelphus a history of Egypt and her religion.<br/>
The remains of the great Egyptian history of Manetho are<br/>
preserved in the polemical treatise of Josephus against<br/>
Apion, in which a series of passages of Egyptian history<br/>
from the XVth to the XIXth dynasties is given, and in the<br/>
list of the dynasties, together with the number of years of<br/>
the reign of each king, given by Africanus and Eusebius<br/>
on his authority. At the beginning of his work Manetho<br/>
gives a list of gods and demi-gods who ruled over Egypt<br/>
before Menes, the first human king of Egypt; the thirty<br/>
dynasties known to us he divides into three sections: I-XI, <span style="color: #ff0000;">XII-XIX</span>, and XX-XXX. Diodorus Siculus,<br/>
who visited Egypt <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. 57, wrote a history of the country,<br/>
its people and its religion, based <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>upon the works of<br/>
Herodotus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hekataeus</span>. He was not so able a writer<br/>
nor so accurate an observer as Herodotus, and his work<br/>
contains many blunders. Other important ancient writers<br/>
