river, was called in Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">2iz,2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Behutet</span>, and in<br/>
Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">afrrtv</span>; it was called by the Greeks <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollinopolis </span>Magna, where the crocodile and its worshippers were<br/>
detested. The Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edit</span>, for which alone both<br/>
the ancient and <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>towns were famous, occupied <span style="color: #0000FF;">180<br/>
</span>years three months and fourteen days in building, that is to<br/>
say it was begun during the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>
B.C. 237, and finished B.C. 57. It resembles that of<br/>
Denderah in many respects, but its complete condition<br/>
marks it out as one of the most remarkable buildings in<br/>
Egypt, and its splendid towers, about 112 feet high, make<br/>
its general magnificence very striking. The space enclosed<br/>
by the walls measures <span style="color: #0000FF;">450 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">X </span>120 feet; the front of the<br/>
propylon from side to side measures about 252 feet. Passing through the door the visitor enters a court, around three<br/>
sides of which runs a gallery supported on <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-two </span>pillars,<br/>
The first and second halls, A, B, have eighteen and twelve<br/>
pillars respectively; passing through chambers C and D, the<br/>
shrine E is reached, where stood a granite naos in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>figure of Horus, to whom the temple is dedicated, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved</span>. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">naos </span>was made by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span>I., a king of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXth </span>dynasty, B.C. 378.<br/>
<br/>
The pylons are covered with battle scenes, and the walls<br/>
are inscribed with the names and sizes of the various chambers in the building, lists of names of places, etc.; the name<br/>
of the architect, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I-em-lottery</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Imouthis</span>, has also been<br/>
inscribed. From the south side of the pylons, and from a<br/>
small chamber on each side of the chamber C, staircases<br/>
ascended to the roof.<br/>
<br/>
The credit of clearing out the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edit </span>belongs to<br/>
M. Mariette. Little more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>years ago the<br/>
