<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Abyad </span>or "White Monastery," so-called<br/>
because of the colour of the stone of which it is built, but<br/>
better known by the name of Amba <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shem1dah</span>, is situated<br/>
on the west bank of the river near <span style="color: #0000FF;">SChils </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">317</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>miles from<br/>
Cairo. "The peculiarity of this monastery is that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">interior </span>was once <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>magnificent basilica, while the exterior<br/>
was built by the Empress Helena, in the ancient Egyptian<br/>
style. The walls slope inwards towards the summit, where<br/>
they are crowned with a deep overhanging cornice. The<br/>
building is of an oblong shape, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">200 </span>feet in length by<br/>
90 wide, very well built of fine blocks of stone; it has no<br/>
windows outside larger than loopholes, and these are at a<br/>
great height from the ground. Of these there are twenty<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the south side and nine at the east end. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>stands at the foot of the hill, on the edge of the<br/>
Libyan desert, where the sand encroaches on the plain...<br/>
.... The ancient doorway of red granite has been<br/>
partially closed up." (Curzon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monasteries </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zevant</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">131</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) There were formerly six gates; the single entrance now remaining is called the "mule gate," because<br/>
when a certain heathen princess came riding on a mule<br/>
to desecrate the church, the earth opened and swallowed<br/>
her up. The walls enclose a space measuring about 240<br/>
feet by <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">33 </span>feet. The convent was dedicated to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shenf1ti</span>,<br/>
a celebrated Coptic saint who lived in the fourth century<br/>
of our era<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Curzon says (<span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">set</span>, p. 132)...... "The<br/>
tall granite columns of the ancient church reared themselves<br/>
like an avenue on either side of the desecrated nave, which<br/>
is now open to the sky, and is used as a promenade for a<br/>
host of chickens......... The principal entrance was<br/>
formerly at the west end, where there is a small vestibule,<br/>
immediately within the door of which, on the left hand, is<br/>
