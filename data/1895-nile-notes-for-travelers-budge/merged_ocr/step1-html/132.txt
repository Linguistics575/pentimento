<span>108 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>

which last circumstance the Greeks conclude him to have<br/>
been the same person with their Dionysus or Bacchus.<br/>
During the absence of Osiris from his kingdom, Typhon<br/>
had no opportunity of making any innovations in the<br/>
State, Isis being extremely vigilant in the government,<br/>
and always upon her guard. After his return, however,<br/>
having first persuaded seventy-two other persons to join<br/>
with him in the conspiracy, together with a certain queen<br/>
of Ethiopia named Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at<br/>
that time, he contrived a proper stratagem to execute his<br/>
base designs. For having privily taken the measure of<br/>
Osiris's body, he caused a chest to be made exactly of the<br/>
same size with it, as beautiful as might be, and set off with<br/>
all the ornaments of art. This chest he brought into his<br/>
banqueting room; where after it had been much admired<br/>
by all who were present, Typhon, as it were in jest,<br/>
promised to give it to any one of them whose body upon<br/>
trial it might be found to fit. Upon this the whole<br/>
company, one after another, go into it. But as it did not<br/>
fit any of them, last of all Osiris lays himself down in it;<br/>
upon which the conspirators immediately ran together,<br/>
clapped the cover upon it, then fastened it down on the<br/>
outside with nails, pouring likewise melted lead over it.<br/>
After this they carried it away to the river-side, and conveyed it to the sea by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tanaitic </span>mouth of the Nile;<br/>
which, for this reason, is still held in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and never named by them but with<br/>
proper marks of detestation. <span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>things, say they, were<br/>
thus executed upon the 17th day of the month Athor, when<br/>
the sun was in Scorpio, in the 28th year of Osiris's reign;<br/>
though there are others who tell us that he was no more<br/>
than twenty-eight years old at this time.<br/>
