possessors in rolling the balls of excrementitious matter in<br/>
which they enclose their eggs. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">balls </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>at first irregularly shaped and soft, but by degrees, and during the process<br/>
of rolling along, become rounded and harder; they are<br/>
propelled by means of the hind legs. Sometimes these<br/>
balls are an inch and a half or two inches in diameter, and<br/>
in rolling them along the beetles stand almost upon their<br/>
heads, with the heads turned from the balls. They do this<br/>
in order to bury their balls in holes which they have already<br/>
dug for them, and it is upon the dung thus deposited that<br/>
the larvae when hatched feed. Horapollo thought that the<br/>
beetle was self-produced, but he made this mistake on<br/>
account of the females <span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span>exceedingly like the males,<br/>
and because both sexes appear to divide the care of the<br/>
preservation of their offspring equally between them.<br/>

The Egyptians called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabaeus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheperis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span>, and the god represented by this insect also Khepera<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iira</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">z</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sNC</span>. The god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khepera </span>was supposed to be<br/>
<br/>
the "father of the gods," and the creator of all things in<br/>
heaven and earth<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>he made himself out of matter which he<br/>
himself had made. He was identified with the rising sun<br/>
<br/>
and thus typified resurrection. The verb Kheper <span style="color: #0000FF;">63 </span>D i,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">0<br/>
<br/>
</span>which is usually translated "to exist, to become," also<br/>
means "to roll," and <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>roller," or <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>revolver," was a fitting<br/>
name for the sun. In a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>papyrus in the British<br/>
Museum (No. IO, 188), the god Khepera is identified with<br/>
the god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nelrer-tcher</span>, who, in describing the creation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gods</span>,<br/>
men, animals and things <span style="color: #0000FF;">says </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o.</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">.-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">} </span>am he who evolved<br/>
himself under the form of the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khepera</span>. I, the evolver<br/>
of evolutions, evolved myself, the evolver of all evolutions,<br/>
