<br/>
which the generals and <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>of the Egyptian king lead<br/>
crowds of prisoners into his presence, whence they are<br/>
brought in triumph to <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hebes </span>to be offered to the gods of<br/>
that town. Elsewhere <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>is making offerings to the<br/>
various gods of Thebes and performing certain ceremonies.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>procession, coronation of the king, musicians, and the<br/>
sending off of four birds to announce to the ends of the<br/>
world that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>III. was king, are among the many<br/>
interesting scenes depicted here.<br/>
<br/>
Outside the building, on the south wall, is a list of<br/>
religious festivals, and on the north wall are ten scenes, of<br/>
which the following are the subjects<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>I. The king and his<br/>
army setting out to war. 2. Battle of the Egyptians against<br/>
the Libyans, and defeat of the latter. 3. Slaughter of the<br/>
enemy by thousands, and the prisoners led before the king<br/>
4. The king addresses his victorious army, and an inventory<br/>
is made of the spoil captured. <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>The march continued.<br/>
6. Second encounter and defeat of the enemy called Takare;<br/>
their camp is captured, and women and children <span style="color: #0000FF;">Me </span>away<br/>
in all directions. 7. The march continued. On the way<br/>
one lion is slain and another wounded. The country<br/>
passed through is probably northern Syria. 8. Naval battle<br/>
scene. The fight takes place near the river bank or seashore, and Rameses and his archers distress the enemy by<br/>
shooting at them from the shore. 9. Return towards Egypt.<br/>
The number of the slain is arrived at by counting the hands<br/>
which have been cut off the bodies on the field of battle.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>. Return to Thebes. The king presents his prisoners<br/>
to the gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span>, Mut, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chensu</span>. Speech <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
prisoners, who beg the king to allow them to live that they<br/>
may proclaim his power and glory.<br/>
<br/>
The temple of Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. is one of the most interesting<br/>
of the Egyptian temples, and is worthy of several visits.<br/>
<br/>
VI. DÃ©r el-Medinet. This small temple, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>stands<br/>
between the Colossi and Medinet <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haln1</span>, was begun by<br/>
