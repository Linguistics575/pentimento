be interested to know that the newly found fragments of<br/>
the wall upon which the expedition to Punt is depicted all<br/>
agree in pointing to the eastern side of Africa as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>country which the Egyptians called Punt; some of the<br/>
animals in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>reliefs are identical with those found to this<br/>
day on the Abyssinian coast, and the general products of<br/>
the two countries are the same. Punt was famous for its<br/>
ebony, and all tradition agrees in making <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinia</span>, and<br/>
the countries south and east of it, the home of the ebony<br/>
tree. The tombs at DÃ©r <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Bahari </span>were opened many, many<br/>
years ago, and a very large number of the coffins with which<br/>
Mariette furnished the first Egyptian Museum at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bt1lsil.c<br/>
</span>came from them; since that time the whole site has been<br/>
carefully searched by diggers for antiquities, hence comparatively <span style="color: #0000FF;">few </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquities </span>have been unearthed by M. Naville.<br/>
On February <span style="color: #0000FF;">ISt </span>he succeeded in discovering an untouched<br/>
mummy-pit, and in a small chamber hewn in the solid rock,<br/>
about twelve feet below the pavement, he found three<br/>
wooden rectangular coffins (each containing two inner<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins</span>), with arched lids, wooden hawks and <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals</span>,<br/>
wreaths of flowers, and a box containing a large number of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1uhabtiu </span>figures. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>contained the mummies of<br/>
a priest called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menthu-Tebuti-huMnkh</span>, and of his mother<br/>
and of his aunt; they belong to the period <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>XXVIth<br/>
dynasty, or perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little earlier.<br/>
<br/>
The great interest which attaches to the name of the able<br/>
queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witshepset</span>, and the romantic circumstances under<br/>
which she lived and reigned, have induced many to endeavour<br/>
to discover her mummy and her tomb<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>up to the present,<br/>
however, all search has failed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">bring </span>either to light. During<br/>
his excavations M. Naville has kept this fact steadily before<br/>
him, and he eventually found a place which, he says, was<br/>
not improbably her tomb. In the passage between the<br/>
retaining wall of the middle platform and the enclosure he<br/>
came upon an inclined plane cut in the rock and leading to<br/>
