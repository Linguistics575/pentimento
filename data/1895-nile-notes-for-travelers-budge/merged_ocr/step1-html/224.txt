fine greenish colour, as that which especially engaged the<br/>
attention of the early Egyptians, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr. </span>Clarke affirmed<br/>

the body, and so far from each other, as to give them a<br/>
most extraordinary appearance when walking. This peculiar formation is, nevertheless, particularly serviceable to its<br/>
