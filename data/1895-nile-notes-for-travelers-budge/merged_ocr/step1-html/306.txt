<span>282 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
would have been impossible for the Egyptians to overlook it. The mountains on the east and west side of<br/>
the river sweep away from it, and leave a broad plain on<br/>
each bank of several square miles in extent. It has been<br/>
calculated that modern Paris could stand on this space of<br/>
ground. We have, unfortunately, no Egyptian description<br/>
of Thebes, or any statement as to its size; it may, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, be assumed from the remains of its buildings which<br/>
still exist, that the descriptions of the city as given by Strabo<br/>
and Diodorus are on the whole trustworthy. The fame of<br/>
the greatness of Thebes had reached the Greeks of Homer's<br/>
age, and its "hundred <span style="color: #ff0000;">gates</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>and 20,000 war chariots are<br/>
referred to in Iliad IX, 381. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">citymust </span>have reached its<br/>
highest point of splendour during the rule of the XVIIIth<br/>
and XIXth dynasties over Egypt, and as little by little<br/>
the local god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra </span>became the great god of all Egypt,<br/>
his dwelling-place Thebes also gained in importance and<br/>
splendour. The city suffered severely at the hands of<br/>
Cambyses, who left nothing in it unburnt that fire would<br/>
consume. Herodotus appears never to have visited Thebes,<br/>
and the account he gives of it is not satisfactory; the account<br/>
of Diodorus, who saw it about B.C. 57, is as follows: "Afterwards reigned Busiris, and eight of his posterity after him;<br/>
the last of which (of the same name with the first) built that<br/>
great city which the Egyptians call Diospolis, the Greeks<br/>
Thebes<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it was in circuit 140 stades (about twelve<br/>
miles), adorned with stately public buildings, <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent<br/>
</span>temples, and rich donations and revenues to admiration;<br/>
and he built all the private houses, some four, some<br/>
five stories high<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And to sum up all in a word, made it<br/>
not only the most beautiful and <span style="color: #ff0000;">stateliest </span>city of Egypt,<br/>
but of all others in the world. The fame therefore of the<br/>
riches and grandeur of this city was so noised abroad in<br/>
every place, that the poet Homer takes notice of it...<span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
</span>Although there are some that say it had not a hundred<br/>
