<br/>
</span>THE NILE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND<br/>
SECOND CATARACTS.<br/>
<br/>
The country which is entered on leaving <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>is generally known by the name of Ethiopia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Nubia<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the latter<br/>
name has been derived by some from <span style="color: #0000FF;">72216</span>, the Egyptian<br/>
word for gold, because in ancient days much gold was<br/>
brought into Egypt from that land. In the hieroglyphics,<br/>
Nubia <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Ethiopia, is generally called <span style="color: #0000FF;">iFE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rm </span>Kesh (the<br/>
Cush of the Bible) <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ta-kenset</span>; from the latter<br/>
name the Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Irene </span>is derived. It is known that,<br/>
as far back as the VIth dynasty, the Egyptians sent to this<br/>
country for certain kinds of wood, and that all the chief<br/>
tribes which lived round about Korosko, hastened to help<br/>
the Egyptian officer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Unit </span>in the mission which he undertook<br/>
for King Pepi I. It seems pretty certain too, if we may<br/>
trust Uni's words, that the whole country was made to<br/>
acknowledge the sovereignty of the Egyptian king. From<br/>
the VIIth to the XIth dynasty nothing is known of the<br/>
relations which existed between the two countries, but in<br/>
the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the second king of the XIIth<br/>
dynasty, an expedition was undertaken by the Egyptians for<br/>
the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the two countries,<br/>
and we know from a stele set up at <span style="color: #0000FF;">wadi </span>Halfah by this<br/>
king, that his rule extended as far south as this place. Two<br/>
reigns later the inhabitants of Nubia or Ethiopia had become<br/>
so troublesome, that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. found it necessary to build<br/>
fortresses at Semneh and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kummeh</span>, south of the second<br/>
cataract, and to make stringent laws forbidding the passage<br/>
of any negro ship unless it was laden with cattle or merchandise.<br/>
