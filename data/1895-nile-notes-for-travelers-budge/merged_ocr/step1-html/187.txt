expedition to Persia, Kurdistan and Luristan, and the results<br/>
of his travels in these countries will appear in due course.<br/>
<br/>
During the first years of his work as Director of Antiquities, M. de Morgan carried out the following works :--<span style="color: #0000FF;">At<br/>
</span>Aswan the sand has been <span style="color: #ff0000;">cleared </span>away from the tombs<br/>
which were discovered by Sir Francis Grenfell, G.C.B., and<br/>
the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Se-renput </span>has been entirely cleared. At<br/>
Kom Ombos the whole temple has been excavated,<br/>
and to protect the remains from the inundations of<br/>
the Nile, M. de Morgan has built a huge dam of the<br/>
waste stones and materials which he found in the progress of his work Though belonging to a late period, this<br/>
temple, owing to its bold situation and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the beauty of its<br/>
sculptures, is the most interesting of all those in the south<br/>
of Upper Egypt. At Luxor the works have been carried<br/>
on with great activity, and the reader will be able to see<br/>
what has been done from the plan which is given under the<br/>
article on Luxor. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>the tomb of Ti has been<br/>
restored and cleared. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshtar </span>two brick pyramids<br/>
and several <span style="color: #0000FF;">mas.t.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">da </span>tombs have been excavated. (See<br/>
p. 395 <span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>At Gizeh the temple of the Sphinx has<br/>
been entirely uncovered. At Memphis large excavations have been made, and among the important results<br/>
must be specially mentioned the two magnificent colossal<br/>
figures of the god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptab</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ell</span>. Under the direction of M. de<br/>

M. de Morgan has been ably seconded in all his enterprises<br/>
by the Conservator of the Museum, M. E. Brugsch<br/>
Bey, whose learning and courtesy are too well known to<br/>
need further mention.<br/>
