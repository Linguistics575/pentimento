<span>144 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of SULTAN HASAN, built of stone<br/>
taken from the pyramids of Gizeh, is close to the citadel, and<br/>
is generally considered to be the grandest in Cairo. It was<br/>
built by Hasan, one of the younger sons of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nasir</span>, and<br/>
its construction occupied three years, A.D. <span style="color: #ff0000;">13i6-1358</span>. It<br/>
is said that when the building was finished the architect's<br/>
hands were cut off to prevent his executing a similar work<br/>
again. This story, though probably false, shows that the<br/>
mosque was considered of great beauty, and the judgment<br/>
of competent critics of to-day endorses the opinion of it<br/>
which was prevalent in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan</span>'s time. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsan</span>'s tomb is<br/>
situated on the east side of the building. The remaining<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">minaret</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>is about 280 feet high, the greatest length of the<br/>
mosque is about 320 feet, and the width about 200 feet. In<br/>
the open court are two fountains which were formerly used,<br/>
one by the Egyptians, and one by the Turks. On the<br/>
eastern side are still to be seen a few of the balls which<br/>
were fired at the mosque by the army of Napoleon.<br/>

tomb of the daughter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlrill.r</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MUAIYAD</span>, one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Circassian<br/>
</span>Mamelukes, was founded between the years <span style="color: #ff0000;">14r2-r420</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>it is<br/>
also known as the "Red Mosque," from the colour of the<br/>
walls outside<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Externally it measures about 300 feet by<br/>
250, and possesses an internal court, surrounded by double<br/>
colonnades on three sides, and a triple range of arches on<br/>
the side looking towards Mecca, where also are situated-as<br/>
in that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlrillr-the </span>tombs of the founder and his family.<br/>
A considerable number of ancient columns have been used in<br/>
the erection of the building, but the superstructure is so light<br/>
and elegant, that the effect is agreeable." t The bronze gate<br/>
in front belonged originally to the mosque of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
