</span>the Virgin, but called sometimes the "Convent of the<br/>
Pulley," because the ascent to the convent is generally made<br/>
by a rope and pulley. Leaving the river and entering a fissure<br/>
in the rocks, the traveller finds himself at the bottom of a<br/>
natural shaft about 120 feet long. When Robert Curzon<br/>
visited this convent, he had to climb up much in the same<br/>
way as boys used to climb up inside chimneys. The convent<br/>
stands about 400 feet from the top of the shaft, and is built<br/>
of small square stones of Roman workmanship<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the necessary repairs have, however, been made with mud or sundried brick. The outer walls of the enclosure form a square<br/>
which measures about <span style="color: #0000FF;">zoo </span>feet each way<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they are 20 feet<br/>
high, and are perfectly unadorned. Tradition says that it<br/>
was founded by the Empress Helena,' and there is in this<br/>
case no reason to doubt it. The church "is partly <span style="color: #0000FF;">subterranean</span>, being built in the recesses of an ancient stone<br/>
quarry; the other parts of it are of stone plastered over.<br/>
The roof is flat and is formed of horizontal beams of palm<br/>
trees, upon which a terrace of reeds and earth is laid. The<br/>
height of the interior is about 25 feet. On entering the<br/>
door we had to descend a flight of narrow steps, which led<br/>
into a side aisle about ten feet wide, which is divided from<br/>
the nave by octagon columns of great thickness supporting<br/>
the walls of a sort of clerestory. The columns were surmounted by heavy square plinths almost in the Egyptian<br/>
style. I consider this church to be interesting from its<br/>
being half a catacomb, or cave, and one of the earliest<br/>
Christian buildings which has preserved its originality.....<br/>
it will be seen that it is constructed on the principle of a<br/>
Latin basilica, as the buildings of the Empress Helena<br/>
usually were." (Curzon, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Monasteries </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zevant</span>, p. 109.)<br/>
In Curzon's time the convent possessed fifteen Coptic books<br/>
with Arabic translations, and eight Arabic MSS. As the<br/>
monks were, and are, extremely poor, they used to descend<br/>
