Mausoleum, and was built during the Vth dynasty, about<br/>
B.C. 3500. Thi <span style="color: #ff0000;">3:5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MI</span>, was a man who held the dignities<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">smer</span>, royal councillor, superintendent of works, scribe of<br/>
the court, confidant of the king, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>he held also priestly<br/>
rank as prophet, and was attached to the service of the<br/>
pyramids of Abusir. He had sprung from a family <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">humble<br/>
</span>origin, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>his abilities were so esteemed by one of the<br/>
kings, whose faithful servant he was, that a princess called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefer-hetep-s </span>was given him to wife, and his children Thi<br/>
and Tamut ranked as princes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Thi held several high offices<br/>
<br/>
and User-en-Ra <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'ljriiiii.i</span>)<br/>
<br/>
kings of <span style="color: #ff0000;">theVth </span>dynasty<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>tomb or <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thi </span>is now<br/>
nearly covered with sand, but in ancient days the whole<br/>
building was above the level of the ground. The chambers<br/>
of the tomb having been carefully cleared, it is possible to<br/>
enter them and examine the most beautiful sculptures and<br/>
paintings with which the walls are decorated. To describe<br/>
these wonderful works of art adequately would require more<br/>
space than can be given here; it must be sufficient to say<br/>
that the scenes represent Thi superintending all the various<br/>
operations connected with the management of his large<br/>
agricultural estates and farmyard, together with illustrations<br/>
of his hunting and fishing expeditions.<br/>

<br/>
The Necropolis of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>contains chiefly tombs of the<br/>
Ancient Empire, that is to say, tombs that were built during<br/>
the first eleven dynasties<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>many tombs of a later period are<br/>
found there, but they are of less interest and importance,<br/>
and in many cases small, but fine, ancient tombs have been<br/>
destroyed to make them. As our knowledge of Egyptian<br/>
architecture is derived principally from tombs and temples,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brief description of the most ancient tombs now known<br/>
will not be out of place here<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the following observations on<br/>
them are based upon the excellent articles of M. Mariette<br/>
in the Revue <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rclttologique</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2ii'me</span>, t. xix. p. 8 ff. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs<br/>
