<br/>
belonging to this period are of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>class. During<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIth </span>and XIIth dynasties the tombs took the form of<br/>
small pyramids, which were generally built of brick, and the<br/>
ancient rectangular form of tomb was revived during the<br/>
XVIIIth dynasty. Abydos attained its greatest splendour<br/>
under the monarchs of the XIth and XIIth dynasties, and<br/>
though its plain was used as a burial ground as late as<br/>
Roman times, it became of little or no account as early as<br/>
the time of Psammetichus I. It has often been assumed<br/>
that the town of Abydos is to be identified with This, the<br/>
home of Menes, the first historical king of Egypt; the<br/>
evidence derived from the exhaustive excavations made by<br/>
M. Mariette does not support this assumption. No trace <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of<br/>
</span>the shrine of Osiris, which was as famous in Upper Egypt as<br/>
was the shrine of the same god at Busiris in Lower Egypt,<br/>
has been found in the temple<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>neither can any trace be<br/>
discovered of the royal tombs which Rameses II. declares<br/>
he restored. Plutarch says that wealthy inhabitants of<br/>
Egypt were often brought to Abydos to be buried near the<br/>
mummy of Osiris, and curiously enough, the tombs close<br/>
to certain parts of the temple of Osiris are more carefully<br/>
executed than those elsewhere. Of Abydos Strabo says<br/>
(Bk. <span style="color: #ff0000;">XVII.</span>, cap. i., <span style="color: #0000FF;">see</span>. 42), "Above this city (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemais</span>) is<br/>
Abydos, where is the palace of Memnon, constructed in a<br/>
singular manner, entirely of stone, and after the plan of the<br/>
Labyrinth, which we have described, but not composed of<br/>
many parts. It has a fountain situated at a great depth.<br/>
There is a descent to it through an arched passage built<br/>
with single stones of remarkable size and workmanship.<br/>
There is a canal which leads to this place from the great<br/>
river. About the canal is a grove of Egyptian acanthus,<br/>
dedicated to Apollo. Abydos seems once to have been a<br/>
large city, second to Thebes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">present </span>it is a small town.<br/>
But if, as they say, Memnon is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismandes </span>by the<br/>
Egyptians, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Labyrinth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">might </span>be a Memnonium, and the<br/>
