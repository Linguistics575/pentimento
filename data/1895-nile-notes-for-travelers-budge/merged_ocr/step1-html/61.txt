because no accurate data were at hand whereby errors might<br/>
be corrected. During the occupation of the country by the<br/>
French in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1798-r8crr </span>it was said to be 2,500,000; Sir<br/>
Gardner Wilkinson, however, set it down at as low a figure<br/>
as 1,500,000. In 1821 the population numbered 2,514,000,<br/>
and in 1846 it had risen to 4,456,186. The last census was<br/>
ordered by Khedivial decree on December 2, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1881</span>, and it<br/>
was completed on May 3, 1882. According to the official<br/>
