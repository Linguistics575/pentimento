<br/>
THE PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">DAHSHI'JR</span>.<br/>
<br/>
These pyramids, four of stone and two of brick, lie about<br/>
three and a half miles to the south of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastabat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Far'tm</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Pyramid of Unas. The largest stone pyramid is about<br/>
326 feet high, and the length of each side at the base is about<br/>
700 feet; beneath it are three subterranean chambers.<br/>
The second stone pyramid is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">321 </span>feet high, and the<br/>
length of its sides at the base is 620 feet; it is usually<br/>
called the "Blunted Pyramid," because the lowest parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>its sides are built at one angle, and the completing parts at<br/>
another. The larger of the two brick pyramids is about 90<br/>
feet high, and the length of the sides at the base is about<br/>
350 feet; the smaller is about 156 feet high, and the length<br/>
of its sides at the base is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">34 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span>feet. The brick<br/>
pyramids have recently been excavated by M. de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Morgan<br/>
<br/>

</span>THE QUARRIES OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">MA'tiARA </span>AND TURRA<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>These quarries have supplied excellent stone for <span style="color: #0000FF;">building<br/>
</span>purposes for six thousand years at least. During the<br/>
Ancient Empire the architects of the pyramids made their<br/>
quarrymen tunnel into the mountains for hundreds of yards<br/>
until they found a bed of stone suitable for their work, and<br/>
traces of their excavations <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>plainly visible to-day. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turm </span>quarry <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ai</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kit </span>w<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Re-su</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ta-re-Eu</span>, from which the Arabic name Turra<br/>
is probably derived. An inscription in one of the chambers<br/>
tells us that during the reign of Amenophis <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. a new part<br/>
of the quarry was opened. Uni, an officer who lived in<br/>
the reign of Pepi <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, was sent to Turra <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>this king to bring<br/>
back a white limestone sarcophagus with its cover, libation<br/>
stone, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ctc.</span>, etc.<br/>
