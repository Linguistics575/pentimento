flank it on the north and south are the work <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofThothmes </span>IH.,<br/>
but Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III.</span>, and Rameses IV. have added<br/>
their cartouches to them. On this pylon are inscribed a<br/>
large number of geographical names of interest. Passing<br/>
through it, the visitor finds himself in a vestibule which<br/>
leads into a red granite oblong chamber, inscribed with the<br/>
name of Philip <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>of Macedon, which is often said to have<br/>
formed the sanctuary. In the chambers on each side of it<br/>
are found the names <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>I., Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, Thothmes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witshepset</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thothlnes </span>III. The sanctuary stood<br/>
in the centre of the large court beyond the two oblong red<br/>
granite pedestals. In ancient days, when Thebes was<br/>
pillaged by her conquerors, it would seem that special care<br/>
was taken to uproot not only the shrine, but the very<br/>
foundations upon which it rested. Some fragments of<br/>
columns inscribed with the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>found<br/>
there prove, however, that its foundation dates from<br/>
the reign of this king. Beyond the sanctuary court <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>a large building of the time of Thothmes <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. In it was<br/>
found the famous Tablet of Ancestors, now in Paris,<br/>
where this king is seen making offerings to a number of his<br/>
royal ancestors. On the north side of the building is<br/>
the chamber in which he made his offerings, and on the east<br/>
side is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chamber where he adored the hawk, the emblem<br/>
of the Sun-god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>; this latter chamber was restored by<br/>
Alexander <span style="color: #ff0000;">IV</span>. Behind the great temple, and quite distinct<br/>
from it, was another small temple. On the south side of<br/>
the great temple was a lake which was filled by infiltration<br/>
from the Nile; it appears only to have been used for<br/>
processional purposes, as water for <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablutionary </span>and other<br/>
purposes was drawn from the well on the north side of the<br/>
interior of the temple. The lake was dug during the reign<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III.</span>, and its stone quays probably belong to<br/>
the same period.<br/>
