usually entered on the eastern side<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>their tops are quite flat.<br/>
The interior of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>may be divided into three parts<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>the chamber, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sirdtd</span>,'k or place of retreat, and the pit.<br/>
The entrance is made through a door in the middle of the<br/>
eastern or northern side, and though the interior may be<br/>
divided into many chambers, it is usual only to find one.<br/>
The walls of the interior are sometimes sculptured, and in<br/>
the lower part of the chamber, usually facing the east, is a<br/>
stele; the stele alone may be inscribed and the walls unsculptured, but no case is known where the walls are<br/>
sculptured and the stele blank. A table of offerings is<br/>
often found on the ground at the foot of the stele. A little<br/>
distance from the chamber, built into the thickness of the<br/>
walls, more often to the south than the north, is a high,<br/>
narrow place of retreat or habitation, called by the Arabs a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sirdth</span>. This place was walled up, and the only communication between it and the chamber was by means of a<br/>
narrow hole sufficiently large to admit of the entrance of the<br/>
hand. One or more statues of the dead man buried in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>were shut in here, and the small passage is said to<br/>
have been made for the escape of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fumes </span>of incense<br/>
which was burnt in the chamber. The pit was a square<br/>
shaft varying in depth from 40 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">80 </span>feet, sunk usually<br/>
in the middle of the larger axis of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba</span>, rather<br/>
nearer the north than the south. There was neither ladder<br/>
nor staircase, either outside or inside, leading to the funereal<br/>
chamber at the bottom of the pit, hence the coffin and the<br/>
mummy when once there were inaccessible. This pit was<br/>
sunk through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>into the rock beneath. At the<br/>
bottom of the pit, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the south side, is an opening into <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>passage, about four feet high, which leads obliquely to the<br/>
south-east; soon after the passage increases in size in all<br/>
directions, and becomes the sarcophagus chamber, which<br/>
