<span>238 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why the kings of Egypt established their capital<br/>
there is obvious. From the peoples that lived on the<br/>
western bank of the river they had little to fear, but on<br/>
the eastern side they were always subject to invasions of<br/>
the peoples who lived in Mesopotamia, Syria, and Arabia<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>with their capital on the western bank, and the broad<br/>
Nile as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>barrier on the east of it, they were comparatively<br/>
safe. Added to this, its situation at the beginning of<br/>
the Delta enabled it to participate easily of the good<br/>
things of that rich country. The tract <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>upon which<br/>
Memphis stood was also fertile and well wooded. Diodorus<br/>
speaks of its green meadows, intersected with canals, and<br/>
of their pavement of lotus flowers; Pliny talks of trees<br/>
there of such girth that three men with extended arms<br/>
could not span them; Martial praises the roses brought<br/>
from thence to Rome; and its wine was celebrated in<br/>
lands remote from it. The site chosen was excellent, for<br/>
in addition to its natural advantages it was not far from the<br/>
sea-coast of the Delta, and holding as it were <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>middle<br/>
position in Egypt, its kings were able to hold and rule the<br/>
country from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>on the south to the Mediterranean on<br/>
<br/>
the north. In the inscriptions it is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>?
