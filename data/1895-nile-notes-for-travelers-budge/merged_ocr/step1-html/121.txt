</span>men<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">emblem </span>was the sun's disk. His worship was<br/>
very ancient, and he was said to be the offspring of Nut, or<br/>
the sky. He assumed the forms of several other gods, and<br/>
is at times represented by the lion, cat, and hawk. In<br/>
papyri and on bas-reliefs he is represented with the head of<br/>
a hawk and wearing a disk, in front of which is an uraeus 2.<br/>
He was particularly adored <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>. When he rose in the<br/>
morning he was called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heru-chuti </span>or Harmachis; and at<br/>
night, when he set, he was called Atmu, or'the closer.'<br/>
During the night he was supposed to be engaged in fighting<br/>
Apepi, the serpent, who, at the head of a large army of<br/>
fiends, <span style="color: #0000FF;">personifications </span>of mist, darkness, and cloud, tried to<br/>
overthrow him. The battle was fought daily, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">R21 </span>always<br/>
conquered, and appeared day after day in the sky.<br/>
