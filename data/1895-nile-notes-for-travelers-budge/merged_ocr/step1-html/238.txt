<br/>
three different ways, and the price to be paid for preserving<br/>
a body varied according to the manner in which the work<br/>
was done. In the first and most expensive method the brain<br/>
was extracted through the nose by means of an iron probe,<br/>
and the intestines were removed entirely from the body<br/>
through an incision made in the side with a sharp Ethiopian<br/>
stone. The intestines were cleaned and washed in palm wine,<br/>
and, having been covered with powdered aromatic gums,<br/>
were placed in jars. The cavity in the body was filled up<br/>
with myrrh and cassia and other fragrant and astringent substances, and was sewn up again. The body was next laid<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">natron </span>for seventy days,' and when these were <span style="color: #0000FF;">over</span>, it<br/>
was carefully washed, and afterwards wrapped up in strips<br/>
of fine linen smeared on their sides with gum. The cost of<br/>
mummifying a body in this fashion was a talent of silver,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e.</span>, about £250.<br/>
<br/>
In the second method of mummifying the brain was<br/>
not removed at all, and the intestines were simply dissolved<br/>
and removed in a fluid state. The body was also laid in<br/>
salt or natron which, it is said, dissolved everything except<br/>
the skin and bones. The cost of mummifying in this<br/>
manner was 22 <span style="color: #0000FF;">mime</span>, or about £60.<br/>
<br/>
The third method of <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalming </span>was employed for the<br/>
poor only<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It consisted simply of cleaning the body by<br/>
injecting some strong astringent, and then salting the body<br/>
for seventy days<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The cost in this case was very little.<br/>
<br/>
The account given by Diodorus agrees generally with<br/>
that of Herodotus. He adds, however, that the incision<br/>
was made on the left side of the body, and that the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">disisicctor</span>" having made the incision fled away, pursued<br/>
and stoned by those who had witnessed the ceremony. It<br/>
would seem that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dissector </span>merely fulfilled a religious<br/>
obligation in fleeing away, and that he had not much to<br/>
fear. Diodorus goes on to say that the Egyptians kept the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>In Genesis <span style="color: #ff0000;">l. </span>3, the number is given as forty.<br/>
