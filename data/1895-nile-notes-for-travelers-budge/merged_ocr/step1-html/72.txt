into the Nile at Philae by the priests to propitiate the<br/>

<br/>
</span>If the height of the inundation is about forty-five feet<br/>
the best results from agricultural labour are obtained;<br/>
a couple of feet of water, more or less, is always attended<br/>
with disastrous results either in the Delta or Upper Egypt.<br/>
The dykes, or embankments, which kept the waters of<br/>
the Nile in check, and regulated their distribution over<br/>
the lands, were, in Pharaonic days, maintained in a state of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency </span>by public funds, and, in the time of the Romans,<br/>
any person found destroying a dyke was either condemned<br/>
to hard labour in the public works or mines, or to be<br/>
branded and sent to one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oases</span>. If we accept the<br/>
statements of Strabo, we may believe that the ancient system<br/>
of irrigation was so perfect that the varying height of the<br/>
inundation caused but little inconvenience to the inhabitants of Egypt, as far as the results of agricultural labours<br/>
were concerned, though an unusually high Nile would,<br/>
of course, wash away whole villages and drown much<br/>
cattle. If the statements made by ancient writers be compared, it will be seen that the actual height of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inundation </span>is the same now as it always was, and that it<br/>
maintains the same proportion with the land it <span style="color: #0000FF;">irrigate</span>.<br/>
According to Sir Gardner Wilkinson (Ancient Egypt, IL,<br/>
431), the cubit measures of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nilometers </span>ought, after<br/>
certain periods, to be raised proportionately if we wish to<br/>
arrive at great accuracy in the measurement of the waters.<br/>
The level of the land, which always keeps pace with that of<br/>
the river, increases at the rate of six inches in a hundred years<br/>
in some places, and in others less. The proof of this is<br/>
that the highest scale in the Nilometer at the island of<br/>
Elephantine, which served to measure the inundation in<br/>
the reigns of the early Roman emperors, is now far below<br/>
the level of the ordinary high Nile; and the obelisk of<br/>
Heliopolis, the colossi at Thebes, and other similarly situated<br/>
