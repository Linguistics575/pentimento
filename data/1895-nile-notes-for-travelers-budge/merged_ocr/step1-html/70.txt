over the land on each side of its course and formed the<br/>
land of Egypt. In truth, then, Egypt is the gift of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Baht </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Array</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The course of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baht </span>el-Abyad was<br/>
traced by Linant in 1827 for about 160 miles from its confluence with the Bahr <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Azralp </span>At the point of confluence<br/>
it measures about 600 yards across, a little farther up it is<br/>
from three to four miles wide, and during the inundation the<br/>
distance from side to side is twenty-one miles. In an ordinary<br/>
season it is about 24 feet deep.<br/>
<br/>
The source of the Nile was not discovered by Bruce,<br/>
but by Captains Grant and Speke and Sir Samuel Baker.<br/>
Its parents are the Albert Nyanza and Victoria Nyanza<br/>
Lakes. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fountain-head </span>of the Nile, Victoria Nyanza,<br/>
is a huge basin, far below the level of the country round<br/>
about, into which several streams empty themselves. About<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">zoo </span>miles below <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartum </span>the united river receives, on<br/>
the east side, the waters of the Atbara, which rises in the<br/>
mountains of Abyssinia, and from this point onwards to its<br/>
embouchure, a distance of about 1,750 miles, the Nile<br/>
receives no affluent whatever. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttlm </span>to Cairo the<br/>
Nile falls about 400 yards; its width is about 1,100 yards<br/>
in its widest part. The course of the Nile has been<br/>
explored to a length of about 3,500 miles. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu </span>Hammed<br/>
the river turns suddenly to the south-west, and flows in this<br/>
direction until it reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">Donliola</span>, where it again curves<br/>
to the north. The river enters Nubia, flowing over a ledge<br/>
of granite rocks which form the third cataract. Under the<br/>
22nd parallel N. lat. is the second cataract, which ends<br/>
a few miles above <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Halfah, and about 180 miles lower<br/>
down is the first cataract, which ends at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan</span>, or Syene,<br/>
a little above the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span>. After entering<br/>
Egypt, the Nile flows in a steady stream, always to the<br/>
north, and deposits the mud which is the life of Egypt.<br/>
The breadth of the Nile valley varies from four to ten<br/>
miles in Nubia, and from fifteen to thirty in Egypt. The<br/>
