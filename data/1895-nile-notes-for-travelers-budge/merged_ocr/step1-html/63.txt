and solitaries who had thrown over their own weird and<br/>
confused religious beliefs and embraced Christianity; they<br/>
then retired to the mountains and deserts of their country<br/>
to dedicate their lives to the service of the Christians' God.<br/>
The Egyptians, their ancestors, who lived sixteen hundred<br/>
years before Christ, had already arrived at the conception<br/>
of a god who was one in his person, but who manifested<br/>
himself in the world under many forms and many names.<br/>
The Greeks and the Romans, who successively held Egypt,<br/>
caused many changes to come over the native religion of<br/>
the country which they governed; and since the conflicting<br/>
myths and theories taught to the people of Egypt under their<br/>
rule had bewildered their minds and confused their beliefs,<br/>
they gladly accepted the simple teaching of Christ's<br/>
Apostle as a veritable gift of God. Their religious belief<br/>
took the form of that of Eutyches (died after 451), who<br/>
sacrificed the "distinction of the two natures in Christ<br/>
to the unity of the person to such an extent as to make the<br/>
incarnation an absorption of the human nature by the<br/>
divine, or a deification of human nature, even of the body."<br/>
In other words, they believed that Christ had but one<br/>
composite nature, and for this reason they were called<br/>
Monophysites<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in their liturgies they stated that God had<br/>
been crucified.' They formed a part of the Alexandrian<br/>
Church until the Council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon</span>, A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">451</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>when it<br/>
was laid down that Christ had a double nature-human and<br/>
divine-but after this date they separated themselves from<br/>
it, and were accounted heretics by it, because they obstinately refused to give up their belief in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">am </span>divine<br/>
nature of Christ which embraced and included the human.<br/>
To the sect of Monophysites <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Eutychians the Copts still<br/>
belong. The orthodox church of Alexandria and its heretical offshoot continued to discuss with anger and tumult the<br/>
subtle points of their different opinions, until the fifth<br/>
(Ecumenical Council held at Constantinople A.D. 553,<br/>
