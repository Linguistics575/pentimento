<br/>
one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stelae </span>in the Serapeum. The steps of the<br/>
pyramid are six in number, and are about 38, 36, 34h, 32, 31<br/>
and 29% feet in height; the width of each step is from six to<br/>
seven feet. The lengths of the sides at the base are<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>north<br/>
and south 352 feet, east and west 396 feet, and the actual<br/>
height is 197 feet. In shape this pyramid is oblong, and its<br/>
sides do not exactly face the cardinal points. The arrangement of the chambers inside this pyramid is quite<br/>
peculiar to itself.<br/>

was reopened and cleared out in 1881 by M. Maspero,<br/>
at the expense of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son. Its<br/>
original height was about 62 feet, and the length of its<br/>
sides at the base 220 feet. Owing to the broken blocks<br/>
and sand which lie round about it, Vyse was unable to<br/>
give exact measurements. Several attempts had been<br/>
made to break into it, and one of the Arabs who took<br/>
part in one of these attempts, "Ahmed the Carpenter,"<br/>
seems to have left his name inside one of the chambers in<br/>
red ink. It is probable that <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>is the same man who<br/>
opened the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, A.D. 820. A black<br/>
basalt sarcophagus, from which the cover had been dragged<br/>
off, and an arm, a shin bone, some ribs and fragments of<br/>
the skull from the mummy of Units, were found in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>sarcophagus chamber. The walls of the two largest chambers and two of the corridors are inscribed with ritual texts<br/>
and prayers of a very interesting character. Unis, the last<br/>
king of the Vth dynasty, reigned about thirty years. The<br/>

of Unis, but some scholars thought that the'blunted<br/>
pyramid' at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahslutr </span>was his tomb, because his name was<br/>
written upon the top of it.<br/>
