The earliest hieroglyphic inscription is that found on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stelae </span>of Sheri preserved at Gizeh and Oxford, it dates from<br/>
the second dynasty. The oldest <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>inscription is that<br/>
contained in the famous Prisse papyrus which records the<br/>
advice of Ptah-hetep to his son. It dates from the XIth or<br/>
XIIth dynasty. The demotic writing appears to have<br/>
come into use about B.C. goo. Hieroglyphics were used<br/>
until the third century after Christ, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>and<br/>
demotic <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>at least a century later. The inscriptions on<br/>
the Rosetta and Canopus <span style="color: #0000FF;">stelze </span>are written in hieroglyphic,<br/>
demotic, and Greek characters. The Egyptians inscribed,<br/>
wrote, or painted inscriptions upon almost every kind of<br/>
substance, but the material most used by them for<br/>
their histories, and religious and other works was papyrus.<br/>
Sections from the stem of the papyrus plant were carefully<br/>
cut, and the layers were taken off, <span style="color: #0000FF;">pressed </span>flat, and several<br/>
of them gummed one over the other transversely; thus<br/>
almost any length of papyrus for writing upon could be<br/>
made. The longest known is the great Harris papyrus,<br/>
No. <span style="color: #ff0000;">13 </span>it measures 135 feet by 17 inches. The scribe<br/>
wrote <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the papyrus with reeds, and the inks were<br/>
principally made of vegetable colours. Black and red are<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest </span>colours used, but some papyri are painted<br/>
with as many as eleven or thirteen. The scribe's palette<br/>
was a rectangular piece of wood varying from six to thirteen<br/>
inches <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>by two, or two and a half, inches <span style="color: #0000FF;">widen </span>In the<br/>
middle was a hollow for holding the reeds, and at one end<br/>
