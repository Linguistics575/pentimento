<span>344 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The Hyksos kings appear not to have troubled greatly<br/>
about Nubia. When the XVIIIth dynasty had obtained<br/>
full power in Egypt, some of its greatest kings, such as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thothpacs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenhetep </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, marched into Nubia<br/>
and built temples there; under the rulers of the XIXth<br/>
dynasty, the country became to all intents and purposes a<br/>
part of Egypt. Subsequently the Nubians appear to have<br/>
acquired considerable power, and as Egypt became involved<br/>
in conflicts with more Northern countries, this power<br/>
increased until <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">able </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>declare <span style="color: #0000FF;">itself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">independent</span>.<br/>
For several hundreds of years the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubians </span>had the benefit<br/>
of Egyptian civilization, and all that it could teach them, and<br/>
they were soon able to organize war expeditions into Egypt<br/>
with success. As early as the XXVth dynasty, the territory<br/>
to the north of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene </span>or Aswan was a part of the Nubian<br/>
or Ethiopian kingdom, the second capital of which, towards<br/>
the north, was Thebes. About B.C. <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">30 </span>a rebellion, headed by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tafnecht</span>, chief of Sais, broke out, and it was so successful,<br/>
that the rebels marched into middle Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e.</span>, the tract of<br/>
land which lay between the Delta and the Ethiopian territory, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">overthrew </span>the Ethiopian governors. When <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pianehi</span>,<br/>
king of Ethiopia, heard this, he prepared an army, and<br/>
marching northwards captured the whole of Egypt as far<br/>
as Memphis. The kings of Egypt of the XXVth dynasty<br/>
were Ethiopians, and their capital city was <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">apata </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Barkal</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tirhakah</span>, the last of the dynasty, is thought to<br/>
have built the pyramids at Mero'e. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses </span>undertook an<br/>
ill-directed expedition into Ethiopia, but he met with no<br/>
success, and the result of his labour was only to open up<br/>
the country to <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers </span>Under the rule of the Ptolemies<br/>
many cities were founded in Ethiopia. In the reign of<br/>
Augustus, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopians</span>, under their Queen Candace, were<br/>
repulsed, and their capital city destroyed by C. Petronius,<br/>
the successor of the prefect of Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aelius </span>Gallus, who<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">placed </span>a Roman garrison in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibrim</span>, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>22. Candace<br/>
