number of its ruined chambers are still visible. During the<br/>
years 1890, 1891 Mr. Petrie carried out some interesting<br/>
excavations at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawstra</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biyahmu</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ellihtm</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1m </span>and<br/>
other sites in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayytim</span>. The funds for the purpose<br/>
were most generously provided by Mr. Jesse Haworth and<br/>
Mr. Martyn Kennard.<br/>

Beni <span style="color: #ff0000;">Su√©f</span>, 73 miles from Cairo, is the capital of the<br/>
province bearing the same name, and is governed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mudir</span>. In ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was famous for its textile fabrics,<br/>
and supplied <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahmim </span>and other weaving cities of Upper<br/>
Egypt with flax. A main road led from this town to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayyttm</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>some under ground and some above ground over them, to the number<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span>thousand, fifteen hundred of each. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>above ground<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>myself went through, and saw, and relate <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>personal inspection.<br/>
But the underground rooms I only know from report; for the Egyptians<br/>
who have charge of the building would on no account show me them,<br/>
saying, that there were the sepulchres of the kings who originally built<br/>
this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. I can therefore only<br/>
relate what I have learnt by hearsay concerning the lower rooms; but<br/>
the upper ones, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">surpass </span>all human works, I myself saw; for the<br/>
passage through the corridors, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the windings through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">courts</span>,<br/>
from their great <span style="color: #0000FF;">variety</span>, presented a thousand occasions of wonder as<br/>
I passed from <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>court to the rooms, and from the rooms to the hall,<br/>
and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>corridors from the halls, and to other courts from the<br/>
rooms. The roofs of all these are of stone, as also are the walls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>the walls are full of sculptured <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>. Each court is surrounded with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>of white stone, closely fitted. And adjoining the extremity<br/>
of the labyrinth is a pyramid, forty <span style="color: #ff0000;">orgyze </span>(about 240 <span style="color: #0000FF;">fact</span>) in height,<br/>
on which large figures are carved, and a way to it has been made under<br/>
ground." Herodotus, Bk<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, 148 (Cary's translation).<br/>
