of preparations for thee in the secret house; she has <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed </span>the pain which is in thy limbs and the sickness as if it<br/>
never existed. Life is given to thee by the most excellent wife.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">protectest </span>the inundation in the fields of<br/>
Aphroditopolis this day.<br/>
<br/>
The cow (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e.</span>, Isis) weeps aloud for thee with her voice,<br/>
thy love is the limit of her desire. Her heart flutters<br/>
because thou art shut up from her.<br/>
<br/>
She would embrace thy body with both arms and would<br/>
come to thee quickly.<br/>
<br/>
She avenges thee on account of what was done to thee,<br/>
she makes sound for thee thy flesh on thy bones, she<br/>
attaches thy nose to thy face for thee, she gathers together<br/>
for thee all thy bones."<br/>

In the calendar of the lucky and unlucky days of the<br/>
Egyptian year, the directions concerning the 26th day of<br/>
the month of Thoth, which is marked <span style="color: #0000FF;">mmm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or<br/>
"thrice unlucky," say, "Do nothing at all on this day, for<br/>
it is the day on which Horus fought against Set. Standing<br/>
on the soles of their feet they aimed blows at each other<br/>
like men, and they became like two bears of hell, lords of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cher-aba</span>. They passed three days and three nights in this<br/>
manner, after which Isis made their weapons fall. Horus<br/>
fell down, crying out,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'l </span>am thy son Horus,' and Isis cried<br/>
to the weapons, saying,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Away</span>, away, from my son <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horus'<br/>
</span>....... Her brother Set fell down and cried out, saying,<br/>
' Help, <span style="color: #0000FF;">help </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y </span>Isis cried out to the weapons,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span>down.'<br/>
Set cried out several times,'Do I not wish to honour my<br/>
mother's brother?' and Isis cried out to the weapons,<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fall<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mwn</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">set </span>my elder brother free'<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>then the weapons fell<br/>
away from him. And Horus and Set stood up like two<br/>
men, and each paid no attention to what they had said.<br/>
And the majesty of Horus was enraged against his mother<br/>
Isis like a panther of the south, and she <span style="color: #0000FF;">fled </span>before him.<br/>
On that day a terrible struggle took place, and Horus cut<br/>
<br/>
off the head of Isis; and Thoth transformed this head by<br/>
I<br/>
