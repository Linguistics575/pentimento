<span>THE NILE BETWEEN <span style="color: #0000FF;">FIRST </span>AND SECOND CATARACTS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">349<br/>
<br/>
</span>(Bk. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, chap. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vi</span>.) Many of the Ptolemies appear to have<br/>
made additions to the temple at Dakkeh.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the east bank of the river opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dakkehi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kuban<br/>
</span>called J<span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Uk </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>Baka, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, a<br/>
village which is said to mark the site of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tachompso </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Metachompso</span>, "the place of crocodiles." As Pselcis<br/>
increased, so <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tachompso </span>declined, and became finally<br/>
merely a suburb of that town<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it was generally called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Contra-Pselcis</span>. During the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XVIIIth </span>and XIXth dynasties<br/>
this place was well fortified by the Egyptians, and on many<br/>
blocks <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofstone </span>close <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">foundthenames </span>of Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">f.leru-em-heb</span>, and Rameses ll. It appears to have been the<br/>
point from which the wretched people condemned to labour<br/>
in the gold <span style="color: #0000FF;">mines </span>in the desert of the land of Akita set out;<br/>
and an interesting inscription on a stone found here relates<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>IL, having heard that much gold existed in<br/>
this land, which was inaccessible on account of the absolute<br/>
want of water, bored a well in the mountain, twelve cubits<br/>
deep, so that henceforth men could come and go by<br/>
this land. His father Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>bored a well 120 <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubits<br/>
</span>deep, but no water appeared in it.<br/>
<br/>
About 20 miles from Dakkeh, and 690 from Cairo, on the<br/>
west bank of the river, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©di </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Seblla</span>, or the "Valley<br/>
of the Lions," where there are the remains of a temple<br/>
partly built of sandstone, and partly excavated in the rock;<br/>
the place is <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>called on account of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dromos </span>of sixteen<br/>
sphinxes which led <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>to the temple. On the sculptures<br/>
which still remain here may be seen Rameses IL, the<br/>
builder of the temple, "making an offering of incense to<br/>
father Amen<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the king of the gods," who says to him, "I give<br/>
to thee all might, and I give the world to thee, in peace."<br/>
Elsewhere the king is <span style="color: #0000FF;">making </span>offerings to Tefnut, lady of<br/>
heaven, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nebt-hetep</span>, Horus and Thoth, each of whom<br/>
promises to bestow some blessing upon him. On another<br/>
part is a boat containing a ram-headed god, and Harmachis<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
