<br/>
The Jewish synagogue near Abu Sargah was originally a<br/>
Coptic church dedicated to St. Michael, which was sold to<br/>
the Jews by a patriarch called Michael towards the end of<br/>
the ninth century; it measures <span style="color: #0000FF;">65 </span>feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">x </span>35 feet, and is<br/>
said to contain a copy of the Law written by Ezra.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the south-east of Abu Sargah is the church<br/>
dedicated to the Virgin, more commonly called <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElMu'allaliah</span>, or the'hanging,' from the fact that it is suspended between two bastions, and must be entered by a<br/>
staircase. The church is triapsal, and is of the basilican<br/>
order. It originally contained some very beautiful screens,<br/>
which have been removed from their original positions and<br/>
made into a sort of wall, and, unfortunately, modern<br/>
stained glass has been made to replace the old. The cedar<br/>
doors, sculptured in panels, are now in the British Museum.<br/>
The cedar and ivory screens are thought to belong to the<br/>
eleventh century. The church is remarkable in having no<br/>
choir, and Mr. Butler says it is "a double-aisled church, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>such is remarkable in having no transepts." The pulpit<br/>
is one of the most valuable things left in the church, and<br/>
probably dates from the twelfth century; in the wooden<br/>
coffer near it are the bones of four saints. Authorities<br/>
differ as to the date to be assigned to the founding of this<br/>
church, but all the available evidence now known would<br/>
seem to point to the sixth century as the most probable<br/>
period<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at any rate, it must have been before the betrayal<br/>
of the fortress of Babylon to'Amr by the Monophysite<br/>
Copts in the seventh century.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the north-east of Abu Sargah is the church of<br/>
St. Barbara, the daughter of a man of position in the East,<br/>
who was martyred during the persecution of Maximinus; it<br/>
was built probably during the eighth century. In the<br/>
church is a picture of the saint, and a chapel in honour of<br/>
St. George. At the west end of the triforium are some<br/>
mural paintings of great interest.<br/>
