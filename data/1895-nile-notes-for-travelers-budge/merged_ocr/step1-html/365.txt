65 feet high, and their southern faces are ornamented with<br/>
sculptures representing Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">VII</span>. Philometor triumphing<br/>
over his enemies. On the east side of the large court, which is<br/>
entered through the propylon, is a portico with ten columns,<br/>
and on the west side are the three chambers forming the<br/>
so-called mammisi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the walls of which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>of the birth of Horus. In this courtyard there is<br/>
a copy of the famous Rosetta Stone inscription, given,<br/>
unfortunately, without the Greek text. Passing through the<br/>
second propylon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>portico having ten beautifully painted<br/>
capitals is entered, and north of this are three chambers, in<br/>
the last of which is the monolith shrine. Round and about<br/>
are several small chambers and passages with secret openings.<br/>
When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span>visited the island he saw the hawk which was<br/>
worshipped there, and which was said to have been brought<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Ethiopia.'<br/>
<br/>
On the western side of the island stands the beautiful little<br/>
temple usually called Pharaoh's bed, and a little to the north<br/>
of it is a small temple built by Ptolemy IX. Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>;<br/>
the other ruins <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the island are not of importance, but if<br/>
time permits, a visit should be paid to the Nilometer built<br/>
in a staircase leading down to the river. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">said<br/>
</span>to be one of the burial places of Osiris, and as such was<br/>
held in the greatest esteem by both Egyptians and Ethiopians; it was considered a most holy place, and only priests<br/>

different in the marks of its plumage. They said that the bird was<br/>
