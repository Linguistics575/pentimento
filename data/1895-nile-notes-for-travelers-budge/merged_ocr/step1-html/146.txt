dynasty, B.C. 378. The PANEUM, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>temple of Pan, is<br/>
probably represented by the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kom </span>ed-Dik. The<br/>
JEws' QUARTER lay between the sea and the street, to the<br/>
east of Lochias. The NECROPOLIS was situated at the<br/>
west of the city. The GYMNASIUM stood a little to the east<br/>
of the Paneum, on the south side of the street which ends,<br/>
on the east, in the Canopic Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Pompey's Pillar was erected by Pompey, a Roman<br/>
prefect, in honour of Diocletian, some little time after <span style="color: #ff0000;">A.D</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">3023* </span>It is made of granite brought from Aswan; the shaft<br/>
is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>feet, and the whole monument, including its<br/>
pedestal, is rather more than 100 feet high. The fragments<br/>
of the columns which lie around the base of this pillar are<br/>
thought to have belonged to the Serapeum.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago there were to be seen in Alexandria the<br/>
two famous granite obelisks called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleopatra</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>Needles.<br/>
They were brought from Heliopolis during the reign of the<br/>
Roman Emperor Augustus, and set up before the Temple<br/>
of Caesar. Until quite lately one of them remained <span style="color: #0000FF;">upright</span>; the other had fallen. They are both made of Aswan<br/>
granite; one measured 67 feet in height, the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">681 </span>feet<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>the diameter of each is about 7% feet. The larger obelisk<br/>
was given by Muhammad'Ali to the English early in this<br/>
century, but it was not removed until 1877, when it was<br/>
transported to England at the expense of Sir Erasmus<br/>
Wilson, and it now stands on the Thames Embankment.<br/>
The smaller obelisk was taken to New York a few years<br/>
later. The inscriptions show that both were made during the<br/>
reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofThothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TIL</span>, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1600</span>, and that Rameses II.,<br/>
who lived about 250 years later, added lines of inscriptions<br/>
recording his titles of honour and greatness.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">K </span>The Greek inscription recording this fact is published in Boeckh,<br/>
