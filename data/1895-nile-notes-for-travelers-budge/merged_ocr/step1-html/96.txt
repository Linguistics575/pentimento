THE RELIGION AND GODS OF<br/>
EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The religion of the ancient Egyptians is one of the most<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>problems of Egyptology, and though a great deal has<br/>
been written about it <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the last few years, and many<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">diff1culties </span>have been satisfactorily explained, there still<br/>
remain unanswered <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large number of questions connected<br/>
with it. In all religious texts the reader is always assumed<br/>
to have a knowledge of the subject treated of by the writer,<br/>
and no definite statement is made on the subject concerning<br/>
which very little, comparatively, is known by students today. For example, in the texts inscribed inside the<br/>
pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Units</span>, Teti, and Pepi (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">33oo-3233</span>), we<br/>
are brought face to face with religious compositions which<br/>
mention the acts and relationships of the gods, and refer to<br/>
beliefs, and give instructions for the performance of certain<br/>
acts of ritual which are nowhere explained. It will be<br/>
remembered that Ptolemy II. Philadelphus instructed<br/>
Manetho to draw up l history of the religion of the ancient<br/>
Egyptians. If such a work was needed by the cultured<br/>
Greek who lived when the religion of ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lgypt</span>, though<br/>
much <span style="color: #0000FF;">modified</span>, was still in <span style="color: #0000FF;">existence</span>, how much more is<br/>
it needed now? The main beliefs of the Egyptian religion<br/>
were always the same. The attributes of one god might be<br/>
applied to another<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or one god might be confused with<br/>
another; the cult of one god might decline in favour of<br/>
another, or new gods might arise and become popular, but<br/>
the foundation of the religion of Egypt remained unchanged.<br/>
Still, it is asserted by some that the religion of the dynasties<br/>
of the Early Empire was simpler and more free from specu<br/>
