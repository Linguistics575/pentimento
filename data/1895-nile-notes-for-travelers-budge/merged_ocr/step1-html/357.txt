<br/>
nothing definite can be said, but Arabic writers describe it as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flourishing </span>town, and they relate that a plague once swept<br/>
off 20,000 of its inhabitants. Aswan was famous for its<br/>
wine in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>times. The town has suffered greatly at<br/>
the hands of the Persians, Arabs, and Turks on the north,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians</span>, by whom it was nearly destroyed in the twelfth<br/>
century, on the south. The oldest ruins in the town are<br/>
those of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>temple, which are still visible.<br/>
<br/>
The island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>lies <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little to the north<br/>
of the cataract just opposite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan</span>, and has been famous<br/>
in all ages as the key of Egypt from the south; the<br/>
Romans garrisoned it with numerous troops, and it <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>the southern limit of their empire. The island<br/>
itself was very fertile, and it is said that its vines and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fig-trees </span>retained their leaves throughout the year. The<br/>
kings of the Vth dynasty sprang from Elephantine. The<br/>
gods worshipped here by the Egyptians were called Chnemu,<br/>
Sati and Sept, and on this island Amenophis III. built<br/>
a temple, remains of which were visible in the early<br/>
part of this century. Of the famous Nilometer which<br/>
stood here, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span>says<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"The Nilometer is a well upon<br/>
the banks of the Nile, constructed of close-fitting stones,<br/>
on which are marked the greatest, least, and mean<br/>
risings of the Nile; for the water in the well and in the<br/>
river rises and subsides simultaneously. Upon the wall<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>"A little above Elephantine is the lesser cataract, where the<br/>
boatmen exhibit a sort of spectacle to the governors. The cataract is<br/>
in the middle of the river, and is formed by a ridge of rocks, the upper<br/>
part of which is level, and thus capable of receiving the river, but<br/>
terminating in a precipice, where the water <span style="color: #ff0000;">dashes </span>down. On each<br/>
side towards the land there is a stream, up which is the chief ascent for<br/>
vessels. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">boatmen </span>sail up by this stream, and, dropping down to<br/>
the cataract, are impelled with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat </span>to the precipice, the crew and<br/>
the boats escaping unhurt." (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Strsibo</span>, Bk. xvii. chap. i., 49, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Falconer's<br/>
<br/>
</span>translation.) Thus it appears that "<span style="color: #ff0000;">shooting </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cataract </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>is a very<br/>
