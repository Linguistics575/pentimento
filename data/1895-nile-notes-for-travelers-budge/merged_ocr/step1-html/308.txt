<span>284 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
language, and consider Thebes as the metropolis <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Egypt.<br/>
Vestiges of its magnitude still exist, which extend 80 stadia<br/>
(about nine miles) in length. There are a great number<br/>
of temples, many of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses </span>mutilated. The<br/>
spot is at present occupied by villages. One part of<br/>
it, in which is the city, lies in Arabia; another is in the<br/>
country on the other side of the river, where is the Memnonium. Here are two colossal figures near one another,<br/>
each consisting of a single stone. One is entire; the upper<br/>
parts of the other, from the chair, are fallen down, the<br/>
effect, it is said, of an earthquake. It is believed that<br/>
once a day a noise as of a slight blow issues from the part<br/>
of the statue which remains in the seat and on its base.<br/>
When I was at those places with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fElius </span>Gallus, and<br/>
numerous friends and soldiers about him, I heard a noise at<br/>
the first hour (of the day), but whether proceeding from the<br/>
base or from the colossus, or produced on purpose by some<br/>
of those standing around the base, I cannot confidently assert.<br/>
For from the uncertainty of the cause, I am disposed to<br/>
believe anything rather than that stones disposed in that<br/>
manner could send forth sound. Above the Memnonium<br/>
are tombs of kings in caves, and hewn out of the stone,<br/>
about forty in number; they are executed with singular<br/>
skill, and are worthy of notice. Among the tombs are<br/>
obelisks with inscriptions, denoting the wealth of the kings<br/>
of that time, and the extent of their empire, as reaching to<br/>
the Scythians, Bactrians, Indians, and the present Ionia;<br/>
the amount of tribute also, and the number of soldiers,<br/>
which composed an army of about a million of men.<br/>
The priests there are said to be, for the most part, astronomers and philosophers. The former compute the days,<br/>
not by the moon, but by the sun, introducing into the<br/>
twelve months, of thirty days each, five days every year.<br/>
But in order to complete the whole year, because there is<br/>
(annually) an excess of a part of a day, they form a period<br/>
<br/>
