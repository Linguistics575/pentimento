the first six dynasties, and by reason of the fact that the<br/>
places from which the greater number of the antiquities<br/>
come are well ascertained. It contains also a large number<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">complele </span>monuments and statues, which it owes chiefly to<br/>
the fact that MM. Mariette, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero</span>, E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch-Bey </span>and<br/>
Gr√©baut were present at the sites when they were found,<br/>
and superintended their transport to the Museum. In<br/>
former days the collection of scarabs was very large and<br/>
nearly complete. Owing, however, to various causes, it<br/>
has now dwindled in importance, and many a private<br/>
collector, not to mention the great museums of Europe<br/>
now possesses collections of more importance historically<br/>
and of more value intrinsically<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
