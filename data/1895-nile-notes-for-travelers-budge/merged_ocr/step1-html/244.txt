<br/>
</span>About five miles to the north-east <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Cairo stands the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>, built upon part of the site of<br/>
Heliopolis, where may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>seen the sycamore tree, usually<br/>
called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Virgin's Tree," under which tradition says that<br/>
the Virgin Mary sat and rested during her flight to Egypt;<br/>
it was planted some time towards the end of the XVIIth<br/>
century, and was given to the Empress <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eugenie </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'il<br/>
</span>on the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Beyond<br/>
the "Virgin's <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ree</span>" is the fine Aswan granite obelisk which<br/>
marks the site of the ancient town of Heliopolis, called<br/>
"On" in Gen. xli. 45, "House of the Sun" in Jeremiah<br/>

At this place the <span style="color: #0000FF;">balsam<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>trees, about which so many traditions are extant, were said to grow.<br/>
The balsam tree was <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubit </span>high, and had two <span style="color: #0000FF;">barks</span>; the<br/>
outer red and fine, and the inner green and thick. When the<br/>
latter was macerated in the mouth, it left an oily taste and an<br/>
aromatic odour. Incisions were made in the barks, and the liquid<br/>
which flowed from them was carefully collected and treated; the<br/>
amount of balsam oil obtained formed a tenth part of all the liquid<br/>
collected. The last balsam tree cultivated in Egypt died in 1615, but<br/>
two were seen alive in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1612</span>; it is said that they would grow nowhere<br/>
out of Egypt. They were watered with the water from the well at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyyeh </span>in which the Virgin Mary washed the clothes of our Lord<br/>
when she was in Egypt. The oil was much sought after by the<br/>
Christians of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinia </span>and other places, who thought it absolutely<br/>
necessary that one drop of this oil should be poured into the water in<br/>
which they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>baptized. See Wansleben, <span style="color: #ff0000;">CHistoire </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rfe</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1bglise<br/>
