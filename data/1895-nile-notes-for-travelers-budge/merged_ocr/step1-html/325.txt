of a poetical turn of mind, stated that it made a sighing<br/>
sound in complaining to its mother, the dawn, of the injuries<br/>
inflicted upon it by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses</span>. The inscriptions on the<br/>

</span>IV. Medinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">Habi'1.</span>---This village lies to the south of<br/>
the colossi, and its foundation dates from Coptic times. The<br/>
early Christians established themselves around the ancient<br/>
Egyptian temple there, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">hav1ng </span>carefully plastered over<br/>
the wall sculptures in one of its chambers, they used it as a<br/>
chapel. Round and about this temple many Greek and<br/>
Coptic inscriptions have been found, which prove that the<br/>
Coptic community here was one of the largest and most<br/>
important in Upper Egypt. The temple here is actually<br/>
composed of two temples; the older was built by<br/>
Thothmes IH., and the later by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span>. The first<br/>
court of the temple of Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>was built during the<br/>
time of the Roman occupation of Egypt, and the names of<br/>
Titus, Hadrian, Antoninus, etc., are found on various parts<br/>
of its walls. The half-built pylon at the end of this court<br/>
is of the same period, although the door between them<br/>
bears the names of Ptolemy X. Soter II. (Lathyrus) and<br/>
Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIII.</span>, Neos Dionysos (Auletes). The little court<br/>
and pylon beyond are inscribed with the names of Tirhakah,<br/>
B.C. 693, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span>IL, <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. 358. Passing through<br/>
this last court and its pylon, the temple proper is reached.<br/>
The oldest name found here is that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
work begun by this king was completed by Thothmes <span style="color: #ff0000;">III.</span>,<br/>
and several subsequent kings restored or added new parts<br/>
to it.<br/>
<br/>
Before the Temple of Rameses 111. there stood originally<br/>
a building consisting of two' square towers, the four sides of<br/>
which were symmetrically inclined to a common centre.<br/>
The interior chambers were ornamented with sculptures, on<br/>
which were depicted scenes in the domestic <span style="color: #ff0000;">O</span>) life of the<br/>
