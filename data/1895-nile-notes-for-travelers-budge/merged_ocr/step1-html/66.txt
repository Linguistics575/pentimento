<span>42 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
the most southern part of Upper Egypt, Nubia, and<br/>
Abyssinia, are included among this number. Among these<br/>
three tribes the institutions of Muhammad are not observed<br/>
with any great strictness. When the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedhwin </span>settle down<br/>
to village or town life, they appear to lose all the bravery and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fine </span>qualities of independent manhood which characterize<br/>
them when they live in their home, the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The inhabitants of Cairo, Alexandria, and other large<br/>
towns form a class of people quite distinct from the other<br/>
inhabitants of Egypt; in Alexandria there is <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>very large<br/>
Greek element, and in Cairo the number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks </span>is very<br/>
great. In the bazaars of Cairo one may see the offspring of<br/>
marriages between members of nearly every European<br/>
nation and Egyptian or Nubian women, the colour of their<br/>
skins varying from a dark brick-red to nearly white. The<br/>
shopkeepers are fully alive to their opportunities of making<br/>
money, and would, beyond doubt, become rich but for their<br/>
natural <span style="color: #0000FF;">indolence </span>and belief in fate. Whatever they appear<br/>
or however much they may mask their belief in the Muhammadan religion, it must never be forgotten that they have<br/>
the greatest dislike to every religion but their own. The<br/>
love of gain alone causes them to submit to the remarks<br/>
made upon them by Europeans, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to.suffer </span>their entrance<br/>
and sojourning among them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Nubians or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berbers</span>, as they are sometimes called,<br/>
inhabit the tract of land which extends from Aswan or<br/>
Syene to the fourth cataract. The word <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia </span>appears to<br/>
be derived from <span style="color: #ff0000;">nm</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>,'gold,' because Nubia was a <span style="color: #ff0000;">goldproducing </span>country. The word Berber is considered to mean<br/>
'barbarian' by some, and to be also of Egyptian origin.<br/>
They speak a language which is allied to some of the North<br/>
African tongues, and rarely speak Arabic well. The<br/>
Nubians found in Egypt are generally doorkeepers and<br/>
domestic servants, who can usually be depended upon for<br/>
their honesty and obedience.<br/>
