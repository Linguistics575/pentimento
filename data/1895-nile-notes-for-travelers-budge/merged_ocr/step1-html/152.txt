<br/>
rock, upon which was built by Darius another monument to<br/>
tell passers-by that he it was who made the canal. The<br/>
track of the canal through the Bitter Lakes is marked by a<br/>
double row of buoys; the distance between each buoy is<br/>
330 yards, and the space between the two rows is about<br/>
thirty yards. At a little distance to the north of the Bitter<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lake </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tusan</span>, which may be easily identified by means of<br/>
the tomb of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muhammadan </span>saint <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ennedek</span>. Shortly<br/>
after Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timsah</span>, or the'Crocodile Lake,' is reached, on<br/>
the north side of which is the town of Isma'iliya, formerly<br/>
the head-quarters of the staff in charge of the various<br/>
works connected with the construction of the canal. The<br/>
canal channel through the lake is marked by buoys as in<br/>
the Bitter Lakes. Soon after re-entering the canal the<br/>
plain of El-Gisr, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'bridge</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>is entered; it is about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty-five </span>feet above the level of the sea. Through this a<br/>
channel about eighty feet deep had to be cut. Passing<br/>
through Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balah</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kantara</span>,'the bridge,' a place<br/>
situated on a height between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balah </span>and Menzaleh<br/>
Lakes, is reached<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is by this natural bridge that every<br/>
invading army must have entered Egypt, and its appellation,<br/>
the'Bridge of Nations,' is most appropriate. On the east<br/>
side of the canal, not far from <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kantara</span>, are some ruins<br/>
of a building which appears to have been built by<br/>
Rameses IL, and a little beyond Kantara begins Lake<br/>
Menzaleh. About twenty miles to the east are the ruins of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>. The canal is carried through Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menzaleh </span>in<br/>
a perfectly straight line until it reaches Port Sa'id.<br/>
<br/>
The town of Port Sa'id is the product of the Suez Canal,<br/>
and has a population of about <span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>2,000. It stands on the<br/>
island which forms part of the narrow tract of land which<br/>
separates Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean. The<br/>
first body of workmen landed at the spot which afterwards<br/>
became Port Sa'id in 1859, and for many years the place<br/>
was nothing but a factory and a living-place for workmen.<br/>
