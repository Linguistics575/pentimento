<span>INTRODUCTION.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having for some years felt the insufficiency of<br/>
the information given by Dragomans to travellers<br/>
on the Nile, and finding with one or two striking<br/>
exceptions how limited is their knowledge of facts<br/>
relating to the history of the antiquities in Upper<br/>
Egypt, Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son have arranged<br/>
with Dr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">E</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>A. Wallis Budge to compile the following<br/>
pages, which they have much pleasure in presenting<br/>
to every passenger under their Nile arrangements on<br/>
their Tourist Steamers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dhahabiyyehs</span>. In this<br/>
way passengers will no longer be liable to be misled<br/>
(unintentionally) by Dragomans, but will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>able at<br/>
their leisure to prepare themselves for what they<br/>
have to see, and thus by an agreeable study add<br/>
to the interest with which their visits to the various<br/>
<br/>
places are made.<br/>
