pyramid. It is called the "tomb of numbers" because<br/>
the numbers of the cattle possessed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chaf-Ra-anch </span>are<br/>
written upon its walls.<br/>
<br/>
CAMPBELL'S TOMB.<br/>
<br/>
This tomb, named after the British Consul-General of<br/>
Egypt at that time, was excavated by Howard Vyse in<br/>
1837; it is not older than the XXVIth dynasty. The shaft<br/>
is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>feet deep; at the bottom of it is a small chamber<br/>
in which were found three <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>in niches.<br/>
<br/>
The pyramids of Gizeh are surrounded by a large<br/>
number of tombs of high <span style="color: #ff0000;">off1cials </span>and others connected<br/>
with the services carried on in honour of the kings who<br/>
built the pyramids. Some few of them are of considerable<br/>
interest, and as they are perishing little by little, it is<br/>
advisable to see as many of the best specimens as possible.<br/>

THE PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">ABU </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ROASH</span>.<br/>
<br/>
These pyramids lie about six miles north of the<br/>
Pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>, and are thought to be older than they.<br/>
Nothing remains of one except five or six courses of<br/>
stone, which show that the length of each side at the base was<br/>
about 350 feet, and a passage about 160 feet long leading<br/>
down to a subterranean chamber about 43 feet long. A<br/>
pile of stones close by marks the site <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>pyramid;<br/>
the others have disappeared. Of the age of these pyramids<br/>
nothing certain is known. The remains of a causeway<br/>
about a mile long leading to them are still visible.<br/>

THE PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">ABVYR</span>.<br/>
<br/>
These pyramids, originally fourteen in number, were<br/>
built by kings of the Vth dynasty, but only four of them<br/>
are now standing, probably because of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">poorness </span>of<br/>
the workmanship and the careless way in which they were<br/>
put together. The most northerly pyramid was built by<br/>
<br/>
