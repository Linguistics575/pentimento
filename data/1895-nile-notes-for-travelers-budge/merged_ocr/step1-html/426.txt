succeeded in bringing to light, in the necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahsldrr</span>, a<br/>
further "find" <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofjewellery</span>. These beautiful and interesting<br/>
objects were found in the tombs of the princesses Ita and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnemit</span>, which are situated to the west of the ruined<br/>
pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">hmenembiit </span>II. By good fortune they had<br/>
been overlooked by the plunderers of tombs in ancient days,<br/>
and so both the tombs and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>inside them remained in the state in which they had been left by the<br/>
friends of the deceased more than four thousand years ago.<br/>
Among the objects found were the following _<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cu<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>. Bronze dagger, set in a gold handle inlaid with carnelian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lapis-lazuli</span>, and emerald.<br/>
