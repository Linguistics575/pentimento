at once employed to exhume these objects, and for eight<br/>
and forty hours M. Brugsch and Ahmad Effendi Kamal<br/>
stood at the mouth of the pit watching the things brought<br/>
up. The heavy coffins were carried on the shoulders of<br/>
men to the river, and in less than two weeks everything had<br/>
been sent over the river to Luxor. A few days after this<br/>
the whole collection of mummies of kings and royal personages was placed upon an Egyptian Government steamer<br/>
and taken to the Museum at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bi1liili</span>.<br/>
<br/>
When the mummies of the ancient kings of Egypt<br/>
arrived at Cairo, it was found that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boils </span>Museum was<br/>
too small to contain them, and before they could be exposed to the inspection of the world, it was necessary for<br/>
additional rooms to be built. Finally, however, M. Maspero<br/>
had glass cases made, and, with the help of some cabinets<br/>
borrowed from his private residence attached to the<br/>
Museum, he succeeded in exhibiting, in a comparatively<br/>
suitable way, the mummies in which such world-wide<br/>
interest had been taken. Soon after the arrival of the<br/>
mummies at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biyl2lr </span>M. Brugsch opened the mummy of<br/>
Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, when it was found that the Arabs had<br/>
attacked it and plundered whatever was valuable upon it.<br/>
