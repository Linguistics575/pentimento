<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ka-hefouiu</span>; it stands immediately on the Tropic <span style="color: #ff0000;">ot<br/>
</span>Cancer. The god of this town was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cggins'l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Stags<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Merul </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Melul</span>, the Mandulis or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malulis </span>of the Greeks.<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kal√©bshi </span>there are the ruins of two temples of <span style="color: #ff0000;">considerable </span>interest. The larger of these, which is one of the largest<br/>
temples in Nubia, appears to have been built upon the site<br/>
of an ancient Egyptian temple founded by Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">HL</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HAD</span>. 1600, and Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be </span>1566, for on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos<br/>
</span>this latter monarch is representing offering to the god<br/>
Amsu and the Ethiopian god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Melul</span>. It seems<br/>
to have been restored in Ptolemaic times, and to have<br/>
been considerably added to by several of the Roman<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">emperors-Augustus</span>, Caligula, Trajan, etc. From the<br/>
appearance of the ruins it would seem that the building<br/>
was wrecked either immediately before or soon after it was<br/>
completed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>some of the chambers were plastered over and<br/>
used for chapels by the early Christians. A large number of<br/>
Greek and Latin inscriptions have been found engraved on<br/>
the walls of this temple, and from one of them we learn<br/>
that the Blemmyes were frequently defeated by Silco, king<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nubae </span>and Ethiopians, about the end of the third<br/>
century of our era.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bet </span>el-Wali, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>short distance from the larger temple,<br/>
is the interesting rock-hewn temple which was made to<br/>
commemorate the victories of Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span>. over the<br/>
Ethiopians. On the walls of the court leading into the<br/>
small hall are some beautifully executed sculptures, representing the Ethiopians bringing before the king large<br/>
quantities of articles of value, together with gifts of wild<br/>
and tame animals, after their defeat. Many of the objects<br/>
depicted must have come from a considerable distance, and<br/>
it is evident that in those early <span style="color: #0000FF;">times </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Talmis </span>was the great<br/>
central market to which the products and wares of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Stldiin </span>were brought for sale and barter. The sculptures<br/>
are executed with great freedom and spirit, and when the<br/>
