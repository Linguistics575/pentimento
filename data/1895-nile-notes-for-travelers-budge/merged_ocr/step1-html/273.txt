is thus exactly under the upper chamber. The sarcophagus,<br/>
rectangular in shape, is usually made of limestone, and<br/>
rests in a corner of the chamber<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>they are<br/>
found uninscribed. When the mummy had been laid in<br/>
the sarcophagus, and the other arrangements completed,<br/>
the end of the passage near the shaft leading to the<br/>
sarcophagus chamber was walled up, the shaft was filled<br/>
with stones, earth, and sand, and the friends of the<br/>
deceased might reasonably hope that he would rest there<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">ever</span>. When M. Mariette <span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>without<br/>
inscriptions he rarely excavated it entirely. He found<br/>
three belonging to one of the first three dynasties<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>fortythree of the IVth dynasty; sixty-one of the Vth dynasty;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-three </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">V </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ith </span>dynasty; and nine of doubtful<br/>
date. The Egyptians called the tomb "the house of<br/>
<br/>
eternity," <span style="color: #ff0000;">Til </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:11</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">pa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fetta</span>.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">MARIETTE</span>'S HOUSE.<br/>
<br/>
This house was the headquarters of M. Mariette and<br/>
his staff when employed in making excavations in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sal.rlrslrah</span>. It is not easy to properly estimate the value to science of the work of this distinguished<br/>
man. It is true that fortune gave him the opportunity of<br/>
excavating some of the most magnificent of the buildings<br/>
of the Pharaohs of all periods, and of hundreds of ancient<br/>
towns; nevertheless it is equally true that his <span style="color: #0000FF;">energy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>marvellous power of work enabled him to use to the fullest<br/>
extent the means for advancing the science of Egyptology<br/>
which had been put in his hands. It is to be hoped that his<br/>
house will be preserved on its present site as a remembrance<br/>
of a great man who did a great work.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMB </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P'fAH-HETEP</span>, a priest who lived during the<br/>
Vth century, is a short distance from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette</span>'s house, and<br/>
well worthy of more than one visit.<br/>
