too, smashed in pieces, lay on the ground close by. A<br/>
small rose granite box, containing alabaster jars, was also<br/>
found in the sarcophagus chamber. The inscriptions are,<br/>
like those inscribed on the walls of the pyramids of Unis<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Teth</span>, of a religious nature; some scholars see in them<br/>
evidence that the pyramid was usurped by another Pepi,<br/>
who lived at a much later period than the VIth dynasty.<br/>
The pyramid of Pepi I., the third king of the VIth<br/>
dynasty, who reigned, according to Manetho, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty-three<br/>
</span>years, was called in Egyptian by the same name as Memphis,<br/>
i.e., <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menmefer</span>, and numerous priests were attached to its<br/>
service<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Pepi's kingdom embraced all Egypt, and he<br/>
waged war against the inhabitants of the peninsula of Sinai.<br/>
He is said to have set up an obelisk at Heliopolis, and to<br/>
have laid the foundation of the temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah</span>.<br/>
His success as a conqueror was due in a great measure to<br/>
the splendid abilities of one of his chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>called Uni,<br/>
who <span style="color: #0000FF;">waned </span>successfully against the various hereditary foes<br/>
of Egypt on its southern and eastern borders.<br/>

III. The SERAPEUM or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arts </span>MAUSOLEUM contained the<br/>
vaults in which all the Apis bulls that lived at Memphis<br/>
were buried. According to Herodotus, Apis "is the calf of<br/>
a cow incapable of conceiving another offspring<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the<br/>
Egyptians say that lightning descends upon the cow from<br/>
heaven, and that from thence it brings forth Apis. This calf,<br/>
which is called Apis, has the following marks: it is black,<br/>
and has a square spot of white on the forehead, and on the<br/>
back the figure of an eagle; and in the tail double hairs;<br/>
and on the tongue a beetle." Above each tomb of an Apis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chapel, and it was the series of chapels which<br/>
formed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>properly so called, it was surrounded<br/>
by walls like the other Egyptian temples, and it had pylons<br/>
to which an avenue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sphinxes </span>led. This remarkable<br/>
place was excavated in <span style="color: #ff0000;">18 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>by M. Mariette, who having<br/>
seen in various parts of Egypt sphinxes upon which were<br/>
