<span>314 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
the "Book of being in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">underworld</span>;" it is quite<br/>
impossible to describe them here, for a large number of<br/>
pages would be required for the purpose. It must be sufficient to draw attention to the excellence and beauty of the<br/>
paintings and sculptures, and to point out that the whole<br/>
series refers to the life of the king in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">underworld</span>. The<br/>
tomb is entered by means of two flights of steps, at the bottom<br/>
of which is a passage terminating in a small chamber.<br/>
Beyond this are two halls having four and two pillars respectively, and to the left are the passages and small chambers<br/>
which lead to the large six-pillared hall and vaulted chamber<br/>
in which stood the sarcophagus of Seti I. Here also is an<br/>
inclined plane which descends into the mountain for a considerable distance; from the level of the ground to the<br/>
bottom of this incline the depth is about 150 feet; the<br/>
length of the tomb is nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>feet. The designs on<br/>
the walls were first sketched in outline in red, and the<br/>
alterations by the master designer or artist were made in<br/>
black; it would seem that this tomb was never finished.<br/>
The mutilations and destruction which have been committed<br/>
here during the last twenty-five years are truly lamentable.<br/>
The mummy of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">DÃ©r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Bahari</span>, is preserved<br/>
in the Gizeh Museum.<br/>
<br/>
No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">li</span>. Tomb of Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III.</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. 1200, commonly<br/>
called "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bruce</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb</span>," because it was discovered by this<br/>
traveller, and the "Tomb of the Harper," on account of the<br/>
scene in it in which men are represented playing harps.<br/>
The architect did not leave <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>space between this<br/>
and a neighbouring tomb, and hence after excavating passages and chambers to a distance of more than 100 feet, he<br/>
was obliged to turn to the right to avoid breaking into it.<br/>
The flight of steps leading into the tomb is not as steep as<br/>
that in No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">17</span>, the paintings and sculptures are not so fine,<br/>
and the general plan of ornamentation differs. The scenes<br/>
on the walls of the first passage resemble those in the first<br/>
