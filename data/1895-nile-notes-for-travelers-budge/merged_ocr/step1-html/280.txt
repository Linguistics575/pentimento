charity<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Patriarch has forbidden this practice, but it is<br/>
not entirely discontinued. Two or three miles from the<br/>
convent are some ancient quarries having rock bas-reliefs<br/>
representing Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>making an offering to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodile </span>god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebek </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fm </span>before Amen-Ra.<br/>
<br/>
MINYEH.<br/>
<br/>
Minyeh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ryr-sl- </span>miles from Cairo, on the west bank of the<br/>
Nile, is the capital of the province of the same name<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
<br/>
</span>Arabic name is derived from the Coptic Mone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ALONE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>which in turn represents the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Et9</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mort </span>in its old<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Q<br/>
<br/>
</span>name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chufu-menit</span>. There is a large sugar factory here <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
</span>which about 2,000 men are employed. A few miles south<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the eastern side of the river, are some tombs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
<br/>
</span>appear to have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">led </span>or IVth dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>BENI HASAN.<br/>
<br/>
Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan</span>, I7I miles from Cairo, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">east </span>bank<br/>
of the Nile, is remarkable for the valuable historical tombs<br/>
which are situated at a short distance from the site of the<br/>
villages grouped under that name. The villages of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>"Children of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hass</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>" were destroyed by order of Muhammad'Ali on account of the thievish propensities of their<br/>
inhabitants<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Speos Artemidos is the first rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavation </span>visited here. The king who first caused this cavern<br/>
to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>out was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>; about 250 years later<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seti </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>made additions to it, but it seems never to have been<br/>
finished. The cavern was dedicated to the lion-goddess<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sechet</span>, who was called Artemis by the Greeks; hence the<br/>
name "cavern of Artemis." <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>portico had originally<br/>
two rows of columns, four in each; the cavern is about<br/>
21 feet square, and the niche in the wall at the end was<br/>
probably intended to hold a statue of Sechet.<br/>
