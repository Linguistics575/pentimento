officers into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sthlsin </span>to bring back <span style="color: #0000FF;">pigmies </span>to amuse<br/>
them. It is much to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>hoped that the good work begun<br/>
here by Sir Francis Grenfell will be continued systematically, and that the whole site could be thoroughly explored.<br/>
Aswan was as famous for its granite, as Silsileh was for its<br/>
sandstone. The Egyptian kings were in the habit of sending<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aswan </span>for granite to make sarcophagi, temples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, and it will be remembered that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uni </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sent </span>there to<br/>
bring back in barges granite for the use of Pepi <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, a king<br/>
of the VIth dynasty. It is probable that the granite<br/>
slabs which cover the pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Myeerinus </span>(IVth dynasty)<br/>
were brought from Aswan. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">undetached </span>obelisk, which<br/>
still lies in <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>quarries, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>interesting object.<br/>
Near the quarries are two ancient Arabic cemeteries, in<br/>
which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>sandstone grave-stones, many of them<br/>
formed from stones taken from Ptolemaic buildings, inscribed<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cufice </span>characters with the names of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muhammadans<br/>
</span>buried there, and the year, month, and day on which they<br/>
died. We learn from them that natives of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edft </span>and other<br/>
parts of Egypt were sometimes brought here and buried.<br/>
The first Cataract, called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shellal </span>by the Arabs, begins<br/>
a little to the south of Aswan, and ends a little to the north<br/>
of the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>; eight cataracts are reckoned on the<br/>
Nile, but this is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>generally known. Here the Nile<br/>
becomes narrow and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flows </span>between two mountains, which<br/>
descend nearly perpendicularly to the river, the course of<br/>
which is obstructed by huge boulders and small rocky<br/>
islands and barriers, which stand <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>different levels, and<br/>
<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, are written: it takes its name from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kr'fah</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ii.ty </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilktlfa</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>town on the Euphrates. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ktfah </span>was one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>cities <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Ir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ari</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>is famous in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mulramnrarlan </span>world because Muhammad and his<br/>
immediate successors dwelt there. Enoch lived here, the ark was<br/>
built here, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boiling </span>waters of the Flood first burst out here, and<br/>
Abraham had a place <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer </span>set apart here.<br/>
