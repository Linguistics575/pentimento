<span>408 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>

in Europe have enriched it by gifts of casts of important<br/>
objects preserved in their museums and by donations of<br/>
books with a view of founding a suitable library. Quite<br/>
recently Mr. D. G. Hogarth, under the auspices of the<br/>
Egypt Exploration Fund, assisted by Messrs. E. F. Benson<br/>
and E. R. Bevan of the British School of Archaeology at<br/>
Athens, during two months' work at Alexandria made a<br/>
series of explanatory borings about the central quarter<br/>
of the ancient city, including the region of Fort <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kom-alDikk</span>, the reputed site of the Soma, and in the eastern<br/>
cemeteries. Mr. Hogarth's conclusions are, he says,<br/>
definite, though negative. The results of his work show<br/>
that an uninteresting deposit, from 15 to 20 feet thick, of<br/>
the Arab period, lies over all the central part of the<br/>
Roman town<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>that the remains of the Roman town are in<br/>
bad condition, and that their appearance indicates that<br/>
they have been ruined systematically; that immediately<br/>
below, and even above the Roman level, water is tapped,<br/>
and that the stratum earlier than the Roman must be<br/>
submerged, the soil having subsided. Such definite facts<br/>
do away, once and for all, with any hope of the discovery<br/>
of papyri<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
