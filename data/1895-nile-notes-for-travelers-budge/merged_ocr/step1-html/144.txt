native craft, on account of its sandy shoals; the western port<br/>
is the Eunostos Harbour, which at present is protected by a<br/>
breakwater about one mile and three-quarters long. The<br/>
MUSEUM and Library of Alexandria were founded by<br/>
Ptolemy 1., and greatly enlarged by his son Ptolemy Philadelphus. When this latter king died the library was said to<br/>

the time of Julius <span style="color: #ff0000;">Caesar</span>, it is thought that more than<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000 </span>works were lost. Copies of works of importance<br/>
were made at the expense of the State, and it is stated that<br/>
every book which came into the city was seized and kept,<br/>
and that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>copy only of it was returned to the owner.<br/>
Antony handed over to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleopatra </span>about 200,000 manuscripts (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pergamenian </span>Library), and these were made the<br/>
foundation of a second library. Among the famous men<br/>
who lived and studied in this library were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eratosthenes</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, Hipparchus, Archimedes, and Euclid. The Serapeum was built by Ptolemy Soter, and was intended to hold<br/>
the statue of a god from Sinope, which was called by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians'Osiris-Apis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>or Serapis. It stood close by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rakoti </span>to the east of Alexandria near'Pompey's Pillar,'<br/>
and is said to have been one ofthe most beautiful buildings<br/>
in the world; it was filled with remarkable statues and<br/>
other works of art. It was destroyed by the Christian<br/>
fanatic Theophilus<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Patriarch of Alexandria, during the<br/>
reign of Theodosius II. The LIBRARY of the Serapeum<br/>
is said to have contained about 300,000 manuscripts, which<br/>
were burnt <span style="color: #ff0000;">by'Amr </span>ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Asi </span>at the command of the<br/>
