At the beginning of the Greek rule over Egypt, the<br/>
knowledge of the use of the ancient Egyptian language<br/>
began to decline, and the language of Greece began to<br/>
modify and eventually to supersede that of Egypt. When<br/>
we consider that Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>Soter, succeeded in attracting<br/>
to Alexandria a large number of the greatest Greek scholars<br/>
of the day, such as Euclid the mathematician, Stilpo of<br/>
Megara, Theodorus of Cyrene and Diodorus Cronus, the<br/>
philosophers, Zenodotus the grammarian, Philetas the<br/>
poet from Cos, and many others, this is not to be wondered<br/>
at. The founding of the great Alexandrian Library and<br/>
Museum, and the endowment of these institutions for the<br/>
support of a number of the most eminent Greek philosophers and scholars, was an act of <span style="color: #0000FF;">far-sighted </span>policy on<br/>
the part of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, whose aim was to make the learning<br/>
and language of the Greeks to become dominant in Egypt.<br/>
Little by little the principal posts in the Government were<br/>
monopolised by the Greeks, and little by little the Egyptians<br/>
became servants and slaves to their intellectually superior<br/>
masters. In respect to their language, "the Egyptians<br/>
were not prohibited from making use, so far as it seemed<br/>
requisite according to ritual or otherwise appropriate, of the<br/>
native language and of its time-hallowed written signs; in this<br/>
old home, moreover, of the use of writing in ordinary intercourse the native language, alone familiar to the great public,<br/>
and the usual writing must necessarily have been allowed not<br/>
merely in the case of private contracts, but even as regards<br/>
tax-receipts and similar documents. But this was a concession, and the ruling Hellenism strove to enlarge its domain."<br/>
