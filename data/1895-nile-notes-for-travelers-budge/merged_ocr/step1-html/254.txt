<span>230 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
Cheops is laid. Having laid the first course of variegated<br/>
Ethiopian stones, less in height than the other by forty<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">feet</span>, he built it near the large pyramid. They both stand<br/>
on the same hill, which is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOO </span>feet high. Chephren,<br/>
they said, reigned fifty-six years. Thus 106 years are<br/>
reckoned, during which the Egyptians suffered all kinds of<br/>
calamities, and for this length of time the temples were<br/>
closed and never opened. From the hatred they bear them,<br/>
the Egyptians are not very willing to mention <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>names<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>but call the pyramids after <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philition</span>, a shepherd, who at<br/>
that time kept his cattle in those parts." (Cary's translation.)<br/>
<br/>
THE THIRD PYRAMID.<br/>
<br/>
The third pyramid at Gizeh was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men-kau-Rii</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>(0 <span style="color: #0000FF;">eee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ji</span>,, the fourth king of the IVth dynasty, about<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ILC</span>. 3633, who called it <span style="color: #0000FF;">gig</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Herodotus and<br/>
other ancient authors tell us that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men-kau-Rii</span>, or Mycerinus,<br/>
was buried in this pyramid, but Manetho states that<br/>
Nitocris, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>queen of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vith </span>dynasty, was the builder.<br/>
There can be, however, but little doubt that it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>built by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mycerinus</span>, for the sarcophagus and the remains of the<br/>
inscribed coffin of this king were found in one of its<br/>
chambers by Howard <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vyse </span>in 1837<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>sarcophagus,<br/>
which measured 8 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span>3 X 2% <span style="color: #ff0000;">feet</span>, was lost through the wreck<br/>
of the ship in which it was sent to England, but the<br/>
venerable fragments of the coffin are preserved in the<br/>
British Museum, and form <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the most valuable objects<br/>
in the famous collection of that institution. The inscription<br/>
reads<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Osiris, king of the North and South, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men-kau-Rii</span>,<br/>
living for ever I The heavens have produced thee, thou wast<br/>
engendered by Nut (the sky), thou art the offspring of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seb<br/>
</span>(the earth). Thy mother Nut spreads herself <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>thee in<br/>
her form as a divine mystery. She has granted thee to be a<br/>
