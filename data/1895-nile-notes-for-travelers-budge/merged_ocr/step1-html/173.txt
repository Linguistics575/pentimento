</span>THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khedevial </span>collection of Egyptian antiquities, formerly exhibited in the Museum at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ih1lilc</span>, is now arranged<br/>
in a large number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>in the Palace at Gizeh, a<br/>
building which is said to have been built at a cost of nearly<br/>
five millions sterling. This edifice, which is pleasantly<br/>
situated in spacious grounds close to the river, was opened<br/>
by H.H. the Khedive on January 12, 1890.<br/>
<br/>
For many years the condition and arrangement of the<br/>
antiquities exhibited in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bfskil.c </span>and Gizeh Museums<br/>
have been notorious subjects for complaint on the part of<br/>
the Egyptologist and the tourist. The Egyptologist could<br/>
obtain no trustworthy information about the antiquities<br/>
which he knew were being acquired year by year, and the<br/>
tourist visited the collection time after time and winter<br/>
after winter, and went away on each occasion feeling that<br/>
nothing had been done to help him to understand the<br/>
importance of a number of objects which guide-books and<br/>
experts told him were famous and of the greatest value<br/>
to the artist, ethnographer, philologist, and historian. That<br/>
marvellous man Mariette had gathered together from all<br/>
parts a series of unique specimens of Egyptian sculpture<br/>
and art of the earliest dynasties, and had, owing to the<br/>
parsimony of the Egyptian government, been obliged to<br/>
house them in the buildings of an old post-office at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Potllitli</span>,<br/>
and thither, for several years, the curious of all nations bent<br/>
their steps. As his great excavations <span style="color: #0000FF;">went </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>, the collection<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btllitl.c </span>became larger, until at last it was found <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary<br/>
</span>to store coffins, sarcophagi, mummies, stelae, stone statues,<br/>
eta, in the sheds attached to the buildings like boxes of<br/>
preserved meats in a grocer's shop. With the arrival of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">DÃ©r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Bahari </span>mummies and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>the crowding of objects<br/>
became greater, for the civilized world demanded that a<br/>
