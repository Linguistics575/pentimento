160. Red granite Stele of Piinkhi, King of Ethiopia,
about ILC. 750. The text gives a detailed account of
the expedition of this king into Egypt and of his con-
quest of that country. It was reported to Piiinkhi in the
zist year of his reign, that the governors of the northern
towns had made a league together and had revolted
against his authority. He set out for Egypt with his
soldiers, and when he arrived at Thebes he made offerings
to Amen-RS, and commanded his soldiers to pay proper
homage to the god. Passing northwards from Thebes,
he captured city after city, and finally besieged Memphis,
which he soon captured, and thus made himself master
of Egypt. The details of the capture of the towns, the
speeches of the king and of his vassal princes, and the
general information contained in the narrative, give this
inscription an importance possessed by few others.

From Gebel Baikal.

161. Grcygmnite Stele ofrieru-se-itef, King of Ethiopia,
about B.C. 580, dated in the 35th year of his reign. The
text records that this king made war expeditions in the
3rd, 5th, 6th, rrth, 16th, 23rd and 33rd years of his
reign against various peoples living to the south and east
of Nubia, and that he returned from them in triumph.
It also sets forth at great length a list of the various
articles which he dedicated to the temple of Amen-Ri at
Napata, or Gebel Barkal, on his return from each ex-
pedition. From Gebel Baikal.
