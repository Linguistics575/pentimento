THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT, 93

It is tolerably evident then that grand tombs were not
built as mere objects of pride, but as "everlasting habi-
tations " which would serve to preserve the body from
decay, and keep it ready to be re-inhabited by the soul
at the proper season. Greek authors have written much
about the beliefs of the Egyptians; but the greater number of
their statements are to be received with caution. They wrote
down what they were told, but were frequently misinformed.

The papyri which have come down to us show that the
moral conceptions of the Egyptians were of a very high
order: and works like the Maxims of Ptalrbetep and the
Maxims of Ani' show clearly that a man's duty to his god
and to his fellow-man was laid down in a distinct manner.
Such works will compare very favourably with the Proverbs
of Solomon and the Wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirach.

The religious literature of the Egyptians includes a large
number of works, of which the most important is the
collection of chapters generally called the Book of the
Dead; in Egyptian its name is per em Am, " Coming forth
by day." Selections from this work were written in
the hieratic character upon cofiins as early as the XIIth
dynasty (BC. 2500), and this practice was continued down
to the second century of our era. The walls of tombs were
covered with extracts from it, and scribes and people of rank
had buried with them large rolls of papyrus inscribed with its
principal chapters, and ornamented with vignettes explans
tory of the text which ran beneath. Some of the chapters in
the work are of very great antiquity; and so far back as
1;.C. 3500 the text was so old, and had been copied so often,
that it was already not to be understood. Many parts of it are
obscure, and many utterly corrupt; but the discovery from
time to time of ancient papyri with accurate readings
tends to clear up many doubtful points, and to bring out
the right meaning of certain parts of the work.
