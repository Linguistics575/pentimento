On the 15th and 16th Fe bruary, 1895, M. de Morgan
succeeded in bringing to light,in the necropolis of Dahsldrr, a
further " find" ofjewellery. These beautiful and interesting
objects were found in the tombs of the princesses Ita and
Khnemit, which are situated to the west of the ruined
pyramid of Ameuemirst II. By good fortune they had
been overlooked by the plunderers of tombs in ancient days,
and so both the tombs and the cofhns inside them re-
mained in the state in which they had been left by the
friends of the deceased more than four thousand years ago.
Among the objects found were the following _

\l mu-

I. Bronze dagger, set in a gold handle inlaid with car-
nelian, Japis-lazuli, and emerald.

2. Pieces of gold and ktpirlazuli from the sheath of the
above.

3. Two golden bracelets.
