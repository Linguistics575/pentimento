written the names of Osiris-Apis, 0r Serapis, concluded
that they must have come from the Serapeum or temple of
Serapis spoken of by Straho. Happening, by Chance) to
discover one day at Sald.ctmh a Sphinx having the same
characteristics, he made up his mind that he had lighted
upon the remains of the long sought for building. The
excavations which he immediately undertook, brought to
light the Avenue of Sphinxes, eleven statues of Greek
philosophers, and the vaults in which the Apis bulls were
buried These vaults are of three kinds, and show that the
Apis bulls were buried in different ways at different periods:
the oldest Apis sarcophagus laid here belongs to the reign
of Amenophis m., about B.C. 1500. The parts of the Apis
Mausoleum in which the Apis bulls were buried from the
XVIIIth to the XXVIth dynasty are not visible ; but the new
gallery, which contains sixty-four vaults, the oldest of which
dates from the reign of Psammetichus L, and the most
modern from the time of the Plolemies, can be seen on
application to the guardian of the tombs. The vaults are
excavated on each side of the gallery, and each was
intended to receive a granite sarcophagus. The names
of Amisis IL, Cambyses, and Chabbesha are found
upon three of the sarcophagi, but most of them are unin-
scribed. Twenty-four granite sarcophagi still remain in posi-
tion, and they each measure about 13 x 8 x LT feet. The
discovery of these tombs was of the greatest importance
historically, for on the walls were found thousands of dated
stelae which gave accurate chronological data for thc history
of Egypt. These votive tablets mention the years, months,
and days of the reign of the king in which the Apis bulls,
in whose honour the tablets were set up, were born and
buried. The Apis tombs had been rided in ancient times,
and only two of them contained any relics when M. Mariette
opened them out.
