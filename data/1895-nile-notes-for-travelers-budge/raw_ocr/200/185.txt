Mariette was succeeded as Director of the Jhllil.;
Museum by M. Maspero, who proved an able adminis,
trator, and who carried on many of the works which
Mariette had left unfinished at his death. Mariette had
formulated a theory that none of the pyramids was ever
inscribed inside, and consequently never attempted to open
the Pyramids of Saletrah, although he lived at their feet
for some thirty years; M. Maspcro, however, dug into
them, and was rewarded by finding inscribed upon the walls
a series of religious texts of the greatest importance for the
history of the religion of Egypt. M. Maspero was, in
1886, succeeded by M. Grébaut, who, in turn, was, in
1892, succeeded by M. de Morgan.
