188 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

western Mesopotamia, to which country he was in the habit
of going to shoot lions. Now we know from a scarab that

a lady called Thi Mn (rio, the daughter of him

QQEQâ€˜RQA and Thuia ===r3yi%i, came to

Egypt to become the wife of Amenophis in the tenth year
of his reign. We know also that she became the "grcat
Queen of Egypt," and as she is depicted with a fair com-
plexion and blue eyes, there is no doubt that she is to be
identified with the lady called Ti ' IN :E 5;, in the
inscriptions on the Tell el-Amama tablets, who came from
the country to the nortlrcast of Syria. Ti was the mother
of Amenophis 1V., the "heretic king." Besides this lady,
we learn from the tablets that Amenophis married at least
five other ladies from Mesopotamia, viz., a sister and two
daughters of Kallimma-Sin, King of Karaduniyash, and a
sister and daughter of Tushratta, King of Mitani; but none
of these ladies was acknowledged "Queen of Egypt." In
the time of Amenophis IIL, a Mesopotamian princess was
honoured by marriage with the King of Egypt, but when
Kallimma-Sin wished to marry an Egyptian princess, Amen-
ophis replied haughtily, "the daughter of the King of the
land of Egypt hath never been given to a nobody "; yet in
the reign of Khu-en-hten we learn that an Egyptian princess
was given in marriage to Burmburiyash, King of Kara-
duniyash, a proof that the Egyptian power was waning in
Mesopotamia. The greater number of the tablets are
addressed to "the King of Egypt," either Amenophis III.
or his son Amenophis IV., and they reveal a state of dis-
organization and rebellion in the Egyptian dependencies
in Palestine and Syria which cannot be understood unless
we assume that for some years before the death of Amem
ophis III. the Semitic peoples of Western Asia were being
encouraged to reject the rule of the Egyptians by their
kinsfolk living in Egypt.
