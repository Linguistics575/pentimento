2(8 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

and later, poverty or laziness made people consider the
interior parts of the body to be sufficiently well guarded if
figures of these genii were roughly drawn on the linen
bandages. It was sometimes customary to lay a set of
these figures, made of porcelain or bead-work, upon the
chest of the mummy.

It was the fashion some years ago to state in books of
history that the ancient Egyptian was a negro, and some
distinguished historians still make this statement, notwith-
standing Prof. Owen's distinct utterance, "taking the sum
of the correspondence notable in collections of skulls from
Egyptian graveyards as a probable indication of the hypo-
thetical primitive race originating the civilised conditions of
cranial departure from the skull-character of such race, that
race was certainly not of the Australoid type, is more sug-
gestive of Ct northern Nubian or Berber basis. But such
suggestive characters may be due to intercourse or 'admix-
lure' at periods later than [the] XIIIth dynasty; they are
not present, or in a much less degree, in the skulls, features,
and physiognomies ofindividuals of from the IIIrd to the
XIIth dynasties.'" The character of the ancient Egyptian,

skeletons of mummified Egyptians in England have been made by the
late Sir Wrch1rcl Owen, Prof. Sir w. Flower, and Prof. Macalistcr of
Cambridge. Within the last few years I have collected for this last-
named strvtrnl bcwcen six and seven hundred Egyptian skulls from
Thebes and Aswtm (Sycne). The greater part of these reached England
in excellent condition, and they are now being measured and examined
by craniological experts. On some of them the skin of the face and
neck remains in a perfect condition, and Prof. Macalister has found
a means whereby he is able to make these dry and withered faces
fill out and resume something of the appearance which they wore in
life, As all these skulls are of great antiquity, and belonged to high-
clx Egyptians, priests, and others, the results of his work may be
anticipated with great interest by both the ethnographist and Egypt-
oiogist.
