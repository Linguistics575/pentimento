LOWER EGYPT.

ALEXANDRIA.

Alexandria was founded B.C. 332 by Alexander the Great,
who began to build his city on the little town of Rakoti,
just opposite to the island of Pharos. King Ptolemy L Soter
made this city his capital '. and having founded the famous
library and museum, he tried to induce the most learned
men of his day to live there. His son and successor Ptolemy
II. Philadelphus, continued the wise policy of his father, and
Alexandria became famous as a seat of learning. The keeper
of the museum during the reign of Ptolemy III. Euergetes I.
was Aristophanes of Byzantium. During the siege of
the city by the Romans in the time of Caesar, B.C. 48,
the library of the museum was burnt; but Antony after.
wards gave Cleopatra a large collection of manuscripts
which formedthe nucleus of a secondlibrary.* In the early
centuries of our era the people of Alexandria quarrelled
perpetually among themselves ,t the subjects of dispute

- This collection numhercd 200,000 MSS., and formed the famous
Pergamenian library founded by Eumenes IL, king of Pergamus,
n.c. I97.

t " .. . . . the Alexandrian rabble took on the slightest pretext to
stones and to cudgels. In street uproar, says an authority, himself
Alexandrian, the Egyptians are before all others; the smallest spark
suffices here to kindle a tumult. On account of neglected visits, an
account of the conrrscption of spoiled provisions, on account of ex-
clusion from a bathing establishment, on account of il dispute between
the slave of an Alexandrinn of rank and a Roman fool-suldier as to
the value or non-mluc of their respective slippers, the legions were
under the necessity of charging among the citizens of Alexandria .....
In these riots the Greeks acted as instigators . . . . . but in the further
course of the matter the spite and snvageness of the Egyptian proper
came into the coMict. The Syrians were cowardly, and as soldiers
the Egyptians were so too; hut in a street tumult they were able tty
develope a courage worthy of a better cause." (Mommsen, Crovahces
ofthe Roman Empire, Vol, IL, p. 265.)
