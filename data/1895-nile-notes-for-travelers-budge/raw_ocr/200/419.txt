RECENT EXCAVATIONS IN EGYPT.

During the past year the work of excavating sites in
Egypt has been carried on with unprecedented activity, and
the net result has been a very considerable addition to our
knowledge of ancient Egypt. Under the able direction of
M. J. de Morgan, his staff have succeeded in clearing out
large portions of the temples of Thebes on both sides of
the river, and his own splendid discoveries have given to the
szeh Museum a marvellous collection of XIIth dynasty
jewellery. M. Naviile has finished the clearing of Hitshep-
set's temple at Der el-Babari on behalf of the Egypt
Exploration Fund; Messrs. Botti and Hogarth have done
important work at Alexandria ; Prof. Petrie has dug through
some two thousand graves containing the remains of what
he believes to be a new race; M. Darcssy and his colleagues
have unearthed many important objects in the ruins of the
Temples of Luxor and Mcdinet-Habu; Miss Benson
discovered a statue of the scribe Amenembitin the"remple
of Hut; and some excavations conducted by natives have
resulted in the finding of that wonderful phalanx of wooden
soldiers now exhibited in the Gizeh Museum. At the
Museum Brugsch Bey has continued his work of arranging
the antiquities acquired by recent excavations, and the
promptness with which new "finds" are exhibited merits
great praise.
