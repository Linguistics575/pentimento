belonging to this period are of the mas.taba class. During
the Xlth and XIIth dynasties the tombs took the form of
small pyramids, which were generally built of brick, and the
ancient rectangular form of tomb was revived during the
XVIIIth dynasty. Abydos attained its greatest splendour
under the monarchs of the XIth and XIIth dynasties, and
though its plain was used as a burial ground as late as
Roman times, it became of little or no account as early as
the time of Psammetichus I. It has often been assumed
that the town of Abydos is to be identified with This, the
home of Menes, the first historical king of Egypt; the
evidence derived from the exhaustive excavations made by
M. Mariette does not support this assumption. No trace or

singular manner, entirely of stone, and after the plan of the
Labyrinth, which we have described, but not composed of
many parts. It has a fountain situated at a great depth.
There is a descent to it through an arched passage built

There is a canal which leads to this place from the great
river. About the canal is a grove of Egyptian acanthus,
dedicated to Apollo. Abydos seems once to have been a
large city, second to Thebes. Atpresent it is a small town.
But if, as they say, Memnon is called Ismandes by the
Egyptians, the Labyrinthmight be a Memnonium, and the
