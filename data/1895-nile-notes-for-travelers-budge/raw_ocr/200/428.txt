" thrown by the rise of the XIth dynasty at Thebes. As the
" Xth dynasty in Middle Egypt was contemporary with the
'' greater part of the XIth dynasty, this limits the new race to
" the age of the Vllth to the IXth dynasties(ab0ut300015.0),
" who ruled only in Middle Egypt, and of whom no trace
'' has been yet found, except a few small objects and a tomb
'' at Siut. The extent to which Egypt was subdued by these
" people is indicated by their remains being found between
" Gehelen and Abydos, over rather more than a hundred
" miles of the Nile valley. The invaders completely
" expelled the Egyptians," Their graves were square pits,
measuring usually 6 x 4 yl 5 feet. “The body was ire
" variably laid in a contracted position, with the head to the
"’ south, face west, and on the left side A regular
"ceremonial system is observable ...... From the uni-
" formity of the details it is clear that a system of belief was
" in full force" *
