kau, Rf1,son of the sun Amenemhfit, l? the third king of
the XHth dynasty. Ofthe history of this Egyptian gentleman
the following facts are known. During one of the expeditions
which Amencmhfit I. made through Egypt, he raised to the
rank of [l feudal lord and c; governor' of the hilly land on the
east of the Home of Meh,” or Antinoe, the maternal grand-
father of ChnemuWetep. In the reign of Usertsen L, the
son ofAmencmiratI., the title of nobility conferred upon this

land, lying, between the Nile and the Libyan mountains, was
