him at Thebes and Memphis, and how he built up the
sacred doors. At the end of it he gives l brief sketch of
his childhood, and the various grades of rank and dignities
which he held. In the interior the first hall, C, is of the
time of Ramcses IL, but it is possible to see under the
rough hieroglyphies of this king, the finer ones of Seti 1.;
this hall contains twenty-four pillars arranged in two rows.
The scenes on the walls represent figures of the gods and of
the king offering to them, the names of the nomes, etc., etc.
The second hall, D, is larger than the first, the style and
finish of the sculptures are very fine, the hieroglyphics are
in relief, and it contains 36 columns, arrangedin three rows.
From this hall seven short naves dedicated to Horus, Isis,
Osiris, Amen, Harmachis, Ptab, and Scti L respectively, lead

beings. The scenes on the walls of six of these chambers
represent the ceremonies which the king ought to perform
in them; those in the seventh refer to the apotheosis of the
king. At the end of chamber G is a door which leads
into the sanctuary of Osiris, L, and in the corridor M is the
famous TABLET OF Arauoos, which gives the names of
seventy-six kings of Egypt, beginning with Menes and
ending with Seti I. The value of this most interesting
monument has been pointed out on p. 3.

cavations made there by M. Mariette proved that it was
not. It would seem that during the French occupation
of Egypt in the early part of this century this temple
stood almost intact; since that time, however, so much
damage has been wrought upon it, that the portions of
wall which now remain are only about eight or nine feet
