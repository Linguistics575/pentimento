AswAN.

Aswan (or Uswin), the southern limit of Egypt proper,
583 miles from Cairo, on the east bank of the river, called
in Egyptian â€œ$3, Coptic cow&n, was called by the
Greeks Syene, which stood on the slope of a hill to the
south-west of the present town. Properly speaking Syenc
was the island of Elephantine.1n the earliest Egyptian

inscriptions it is casiij3yfsori_jygcsi'iy2

Abu, ie., "the district of the elephant," and it formed the
metropolis ofthe first nomc of Upper Egypt. As we approach
the time of the Ptolcmies, the name Sunnu, i.e., the town
on the east bank of the Nile, from whence comes the Arabic
name Aswan, takes the place of Abu. The town obtained
great notoriety among the ancients from the fact that
Eratosthenes and Ptolemy considered it to lie on the tropic
of Cancer, and to be the most northerly point where, at the
time of the summer solstice, the sun's rays fell vertically;
as a matter of fact, however, the town lies a' 37' 23" north of
the tropic of Cancer. There was :1 famous well there, into
which the sun was said to shine at the summer solstice, and
to illuminate it in every part. In the time of the Romans
three cohorts were stationed here,'' and the town was of
considerable importance. In the twelfth century of our
era it was the seat of a bishop. Of its size in ancient days

l It is interesting to observe that the Romans, like the lhitish, held
Egypt by garrisoning thr ' place ' t Asuiin, Babylon (Cairo), and
Alexandria. The garrison at Aswt defended Tt frmn foes on the
south, and commanded the entrance of the Nile; the garrison at
Babylon guarded the end of the Nile valley and the entrance to the
Delta; and the garrison at Alexandria protected the country from
invasion hy sea.
