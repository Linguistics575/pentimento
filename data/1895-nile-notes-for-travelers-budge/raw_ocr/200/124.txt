enemy of R5 1 The flame coming forth fmm the eye of Horus comes
against thee, a mighty Mme which comes forth from the eye of Horus,
comes against thee. Thou art thrust down inlu the tlame of fire which
rushes out against thee, a flame which is fatal to thy soul, thy intelli.
gence, thy words ofpowcr, thy body and thy shade. The flame prevails
over thcc, it drives darts into thy soul, it makes an end ofwhatcvcr thou
hast, and sends goads into thy form. Thou hast fallen by the eye of
Horus, which is mighty uver its enemy, which cluvottrs thee, and which
leads on the mighty flame against thee; the eye of kii prevails over
thee, the flame devours thee, and nothing of thee remains. Get thee
back, thou art hacked in pieces, thy soul is parched, thy name is buried
in oblivion, silence cuvers it, it is overtluown; thou art put an end to
and buried under threefold oblivion. Get thee back, retreat thou,
t_hou art cut in pieces and removed from him that is in his shrine. O
Apepi, thou doubly crushed one, an end to thee, an end to thee!
Mayest than never rise up again l The eye of Horus prevails over thee
