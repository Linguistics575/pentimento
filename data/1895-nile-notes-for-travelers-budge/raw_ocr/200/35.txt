Dynasty AY, from Diarpolis, 0/ Thshes.

From the time of Nitocris to Amcnemhit l. Egyptian
history is nearly a blank. The names of a large number
of kings who ruled during this period are known, but they
cannot, at present, he arranged in exact chronological

order.

2500.

Se-Erich ka-RE. This king is known to us through an
inscription at Ipamimsit, which states that he sent
an expedition to the land 'of Punt ; this shows
that at that early date an active trade must have
been carried on across the Arabian desert between
Egypt and Arabia. The other kings of the XIth
dynasty bore the names of Antef-aa, An-intef,
Amentuf, An-aa, and Mentu-hetep. Se,imch-ka-Rg
appears to have been the immediate predecessor of
the XIIth dynasty.

' These names are obtained from the TABLET DF ABYDOS; see
pages 3, 272.
