298 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

On the west bank of the river the following are the
most interesting antiquities _

I. The Temple of Ifiirnah. This temple was built
by Seti L in memory of his father Rameses I.; it was
completed by Rameses IL, by whom it was re-dedicated t0
the memory of his father Seti J. Two pylons stood before
it, and between them was an avenue of sphinxes. This
temple was to all intents and purposes a cenotaph, and
as such its position on the edge of the desert, at the
entrance to a necropolis, is explained. In the temple
were six columns, and on each side were several small
chambers. The sculptures on the walls represent Rameses 11.
making offerings to the gods, among whom are Rameses I.
and Seti I. According to an inscription there, it is said

MEMNONIUM and the tomb of Osymandyas (Diodorus L,

first court had a double row of pillars on each side of
it; passing up a flight of steps, and through the second
pylon, is a second court, having a double row of round
columns on the cast and west sides, and a row of pilasters,
to which large figures of Rameses II. under the form of
Osiris are attached, on the north and south sides, Before
the second pylon stood a colossal statue of Rameses IL,
at least sixty feet high, which has been thrown down (by
Cambyses ?), turned over on its back, and mutilated. In
the hall are twelve huge columns, arranged in two rows,
and thirty-six smaller ones arranged in six rows. On the
