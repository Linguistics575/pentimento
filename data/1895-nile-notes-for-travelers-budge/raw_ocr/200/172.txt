THE NILOMIETER IN THE ISLAND OF R6pn.

The Nilometer here is a pillar, which is divided into
seventeen parts, each representing a cubit, i.e., 2rk inches,
and each cubit is divided into twentrfour parts. This
pillar is placed in the centre of a well about sixteen feet
square; the lower end is embedded in the foundations, and
the upper end is held in position by a beam built into the
side walls. The well is connected with the Nile by a
channel. The first Nilometer at Réda is said to have
been built by the Khalif Sul8m2n (Ano. vr--7r7), and
about one hundred years later the building was restored
by Mstmrln (Am. 8r3-833). At the end of the eleventh
century a dome resting upon columns was built over it.
When the Nile is at its lowest level it stands at the height
of seven cubits in the Nilometer well, and when it reaches
the height of 15% cubits, the shékh of the Nile proclaims
that surficicnt water has come into the river to admit of the
cutting of the dam which prevents the water from flowing
over the country. The difference between the highest rise
and the lowest fall of the Nile at Cairo is about twenty-fwc
feet. The cutting of the dam takes place some time during
the second or third week in August, at which time there are
generalrejoicings. When there happens to be an exceptionally
high Nile, the whole island of R643 is submerged, and the
waters flow over the Nilometer to Ct depth of two cubits, a
fact which proves that the bed of the Nile is steadily rising,
and one which shows how diflicult it is to harmonize all the
statements made by Egyptian, Greek, and Arab writers on
the subject. As the amount of taxation to be borne by the
people has always depended upon the height of the incur,
dation, attempts were formerly made by the governments of
Egypt to prove to the people that there never was a low Nile.
