240 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

whatever glory it then possessed, and became merely the
chief provincial city of Egypt. During the reign of Theo-
dosius, l savage attack, the result of his edict, was made
upon its temples and buildings by the Christians, and a few
hundred years later the Mubammadans carried the stones,
which once formed them, across the river to serve as build-
ing materials for their houses and mosques. The circuit
of the ancient city, according to Diodorus, was rio stadia,
or about thirteen miles.

THE COLOSSAL STATUE DF RAMESES II.

This magnilicent statue was discovered by Messrs.
Caviglia and Sloane in 1820, and was presented by them to
the British Museum. On account of its weight and the
lack of public interest in such matters, it lay near the road
leading from Bedrash√©n to Mithahineh, and little by little
became nearly covered with the annual deposit ofNile mud;
during the inundation the greater part of it was covered
by the waters of the Nile. During the winter of 1886-87 Sir
Frederick Stephenson collected a sum of money in Cairo
for the purpose of lifting it out of the hollow in which it

forth Apis. This calf, which is called Apis, has the following marks l
it is black, and has a square spot of white on the forehead ; and on the
back the figure of an eagle ; and in the tail double hairs; and on the
tongue a beetle. When the priests brought Apis, Cambysvs, like one
almusl out of his senses, drew his dagger, meaning to strike the belly of
Apis, but hit the thigh; then falling into a fit of laughter, he said to
the priests, ' Ye blackheads, are there such gods as these, consisting
of blood and flesh, and sensible to steel P This, truly, is a god worthy
ofthe Egyptians. But you shall not mock me with impunity.' Having
spoken thus, he commanded those whose business it was, to scourge the
priests, and to kill all the Egyptians whom they should find feasting.
. . . But Apis, being wounded in the thigh, lay and languished in the
temple; and at lenglh, when he had died of the wound, the priests
buried him without the knowledge of Uaunbyses."--Herodotus, III.
27-29. (Cary'srranslation.)
