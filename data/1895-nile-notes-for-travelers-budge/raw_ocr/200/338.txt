314 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

the "Book of being in the underworld;" it is quite
impossible to describe them here, for a large number of
pages would be required for the purpose. It must be suffi-
cient to draw attention to the excellence and beauty of the
paintings and sculptures, and to point out that the whole
series refers to the life of the king in the underworld. The
tomb is entered by means of two flights of steps, at the bottom
of which is a passage terminating in a small chamber.
Beyond this are two halls having four and two pillars respec-
tively, and to the left are the passages and small chambers
which lead to the large six-pillared hall and vaulted chamber
in which stood the sarcophagus of Seti I. Here also is an
inclined plane which descends into the mountain for a con-

here during the last twenty-five years are truly lamentable.
The mummy of Seti L, found at Der el-rlabari, is preserved
in the Gizeh Museum.

traveller, and the "Tomb of the Harper," on account of the
scene in it in which men are represented playing harps.

sages and chambers to a distance of more than 100 feet, he
was obliged to turn to the right to avoid breaking into it.
The flight of steps leading into the tomb is not as steep as
that in No. 17, the paintings and sculptures are not so fine,
and the general plan of ornamentation differs. The scenes
on the walls of the first passage resemble those in the first
