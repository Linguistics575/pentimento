is thus exactly under the upper chamber. The sarcophagus,
rectangular in shape, is usually made of limestone, and
rests in a corner of the chamber; at Salclytrah they are
found uninscribed. When the mummy had been laid in
the sarcophagus, and the other arrangements completed,
the end of the passage near the shaft leading to the
sarcophagus chamber was walled up, the shaft was filled
with stones, earth, and sand, and the friends of the
deceased might reasonably hope that he would rest there
for over. When M. Mariette tound a mastaha without
inscriptions he rarely excavated it entirely. He found
three belonging to one of the first three dynasties; forty-
three of the IVth dynasty; sixty-one of the Vth dynasty;
twentyrthrcc of the VIth dynasty; and nine of doubtful
date. The Egyptians called the tomb "the house of

eternity," T 3,}711 fella.

MARI F,TTE'S HOUSE.

This house was the headquarters of M. Mariette and
his staff when employed in making excavations in the
Nccropolis of Sald.ciral1. It is not easy to properly esti-
mate the value to science of the work of this distinguished
man. It is true that fortune gave him the opportunity of
excavating some of the most magnificent of the buildings
of the Pharaohs of all periods, and of hundreds of ancient
towns; nevertheless it is equally true that his energyand
marvellous power of work enabled him to use to the fullest
extent the means for advancing the science of Egyptology
which had been put in his hands. It is to be hoped that his
house will be preserved on its present site as a remembrance
of a great man who did a great work.

The TOMB OF P'fAH-HETEP, a priest who lived during the
Vth century, is a short distance from yfariette's house, and
well worthy of more than one visit.
