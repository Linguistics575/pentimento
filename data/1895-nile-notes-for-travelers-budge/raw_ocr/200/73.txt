THE Kiwi 49

monuments, arc now washed by the waters of the inundation
and imbedded to a certain height in a stratum of alluvial
soil which has been deposited around their base. The land
about Elephantine and at Thebes has been raised about
nine feet in 1,700 years. The usual rise of the river at
Cairo is twenty-iivc feet, at Thebes thirty-eight feet, and at
Aswan forty-five feet. The average rate of the current is
about three miles per hour. As the river bed rises higher
and higher the amount of land covered by the waters of the
inundation grows more and more. It is estimated that, if
all the land thus watered were thoroughly cultivated, Egypt
would, for its size, be one of the richest countries in the
worldf The ancient Egyptians fully recognized how very
much they owed to the Nile, and, in their hymns, they
thank the Nile-god in appropriate and grateful terms.
Statues of the god are painted green and red, which
colours are supposed to represent 1. the colour of the
river in June, when it is a bright green, before the inunda-
tion; and 2. the ruddy hue which its waters have when
charged with the red mud brought down from the Abyssinian
mountains.

_ It is greatly to be hoped that Mr. Garatin will be enabled to
increase the scope of the valuable work in the Irrigation Department
Jhich Sir Colin Scutt Moncrieff began, and to gradually carry out the
works ncccaaary try bring into cultivation those districts which are
now a wilderness.
