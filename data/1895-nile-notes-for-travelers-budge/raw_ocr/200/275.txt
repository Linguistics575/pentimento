unlike any of the other pyramids known to them ; it is said
to have been built by Seneferu (h ‘5 Cr), the first

king of the IVth dynasty, but there is little evidence for this
statement. The pyramid is about 1 15 feet high, and consists
of three stages ; the first is 70, the second 20, and the third

pyramid are a number of mastabas in which 'royal relatives'
of Sencferu are buried; the most interesting of these are

style of the work are similar to those found in the mastabas
of Salslstrah.
