THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GIZEHI 217

What the mummies which were made three or four
hundred years after Christ are like I am unable to say, for
I have never seen one unrolled. About B.C. too the Greeks
began to paint the portrait of the dead upon the wrappings
which covered the face.

The art of mummifying was carried on in Egypt for
nearly fire hundred years after the birth of Christ, for the
Greeks and Romans adopted the custom freely. We may
then say that we know for a certainty that the art of em-
balming was known and practised for about five thousand
years.

In the account of embalming given us by Herodotus,
we are told that the internal organs of the body were
removed, but he omits to say what was done with them.
We now know that they also were mummified and preserved
in four jars, the covers of which were made in the shape of
the heads of the four children of Horus, the genii of the
dead, whose names were Mesthi, Hipi, Tuamsutef, and
Qeblpsennuf. These genii have been compared with the
four beasts in the Revelation (chap. iv. 7). The jars and
the genii to which they were dedicated were under the pro-

They are called tt Canopic" jars, because they resemble the
vase shape of Osiris called Canopus, and they are made of
Egyptian porcelain, marble, calcareous stone, terracotta,
wood, etc. The jar of Mesthi received the stomach, that
of Hipi the smaller intestines, that of Tuamruttef the heart,
and that of Qebrsennuf the liver. Each jar was inscribed
with a legend stating that the genius to which it was
dedicated protected and preserved the part of the dead
body that was in it. In the case of poor people, who could
not afford a set of canopic jars, it was usual to have a set of
wax figures made in the shape of the four gcnii of the dead,
and to place them in the dead body with the intestines,
which were put back. In the time of the XXth dynasty,
