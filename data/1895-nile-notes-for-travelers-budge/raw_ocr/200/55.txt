THE COUNTRY OF EGYPT. 31

Egyptians as far back as the XIIth dynasty. The area
of the land in Egypt proper available for cultivation is
about 1 1,500 square miles; the Delta contains about 6,500
miles, and the Nile Valley with the Fayytun 5,000 miles.
The Oases of the Libyan Desert and the Peninsula of
Sinai are considered as parts of Egypt. Lower and
Upper Egypt are each divided into seven Provinces, the
names of which are as follows '--

Lower Egypt. Upper Egypt.
Behéreh(capital,Damanhur). Beni-Suéf (capital, Beni-
Jfalyttly (capital, Benha). sutf).

Gharbiyeh (capital Tanta). Esneh (capital, Esneh).

Large towns like Alexandria, Port Sa'id, Suez, Cairo,
Damietta, and Isma'iliya are governed by native rulers.

In ancient days the population of Egypt proper is said to
have been from seven and a half to nine millions; at the
present time it is probably well over eight millions. The
population of the provinces south of Egypt, which originally
belonged to her, has never been accurately ascertained.
The country on each side of the Baht el-Abyad is very
thickly peopled ; it is generally thought that the population
of this and the other provinces which belonged to Egypt
in the time of Isma'il amounts to about ten millions.
