266 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

a small chapel, perhaps the baptistery, about twenty-five
feet long, and still in tolerable preservation. It is a
splendid specimen of the richest Roman architecture of the
latter empire, and is truly an imperial little room. The
arched ceiling is of stone; and there are three beautifully
ornamented niches on each side. The upper end is semi-
circular, and has been entirely covered with a profusion of
sculpture in panels, cornices, and every kind of archi-
tectural enrichment. When it was entire, and covered
with gilding, painting, or mosaic, it must have been most
gorgeous. The altar on such a chapel as this was probably

contained over a hundred parchment books, but these were
destroyed by the Mamelukes when they last sacked the

cause of the red colour of the bricks of which it is built,
was also built by the Empress Helena; it is smaller and
better preserved than the White Monastery, and was
dedicated to the Abba Bésa, the disciple and friend of
Shentiti. The pillars of both churches were taken from
Athribis, which lay close by; the orientation of neither
church is exact, for their axes point between N.E. and
N.E. by E. The ruined church of Armant near Thebes is
built on the same mode}.
