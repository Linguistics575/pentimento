But the underground rooms I only know from report ; for the Egyptians
who have charge of the building would on no account show me them,
saying, that there were the sepulchres of the kings who originally built
this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. I can therefore only
relate what I have learnt by hearsay concerning the lower rooms; but
the upper ones, which Surpass all human works, I myself saw ; for the
passage through the corridors, ond the windings through the cottrts,
from their great waricty, presented a thousand occasions of wonder as
I passed from 2 court to the rooms, and from the rooms to the hall,
and to thc 0thcr corridors from the halls, and to other courts from the
rooms. The roofs of all these are of stone, as also are the walls ', bat
the walls are full of sculptured fiyyres. Each court is surrounded with
:1 Colonnade of white stone, closely fitted. And adjoining the extremity
of the labyrinth is a pyramid, forty urgyzc (about 240 fact) in height,
on which large figures are carved, and a way to it has been made under
ground." Herodotus, Bk, IL, 148 (Cary’s translation).
