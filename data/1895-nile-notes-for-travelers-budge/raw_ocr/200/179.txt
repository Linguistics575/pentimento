THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH. 155

Morgan, who at once began the task of rearranging the
collection and of examining the contents of the "magazine "
with the view of increasing the number of exhibited objects.
During the past year the work has been pushed on with
great energy, and we believe that the visitors to the Cizch
Museum will greatly appreciate what the staff has done. It
will be remembered that of the moms in the palace, only
some thirty-eight contained antiquities two years ago; now,
however, about cighty-scvcn are used for exhibition pur-
poses, and, for the first time, it is possible to see ofwhat
the Egyptian collection really consists, On the ground
Mor the positions of several of the large monuments have
been changed, and the chronological arrangement is more
accurate than before. In one large handsome room arc
exhibited for the first time several fine mastiba steke, which
have been brought from Salck.uirah during the past year.
The brightness of the colours, the vigour of the figures, and
the beauty of the hieroglyphics upon these line monuments
of the early dynasties, will, we believe, make them objects
of general interest and attraction. On the same floor the
visitor will also examine with wonder two splendid colossal
statues of the god Ptah which were excavated by M. de
Morgan at Memphis in 1892. In a series of rooms are
arranged the comms and mummies of the priests of Amen
which M. Gr√©haut brought down from Thebes in the winter
of 189a-9r. The coffins are of great interest, for they arc
ornamented with mythological scenes and figures of the
gods which seem to he peculiar to the period immediately
following the rule of the priests kings of Thebes, are,, from
about n.c. 1oaa-800.

A new and important feature in the arrangement of the
rooms on the upper floor is the section devoted to the
exhibition of papyri, Here in flat glazed cases are shown
at full length fine copies of the Book of the Dead, hieratic
texts, including the unique copy of the F; Maxims of Ani,"
