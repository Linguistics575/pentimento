LL‘XOR (Et.-1§U§0R) AND THEBES. 291

Seti I., the builder of this hall, set up seventy-nine, and
the remaining Mty-four were set up by Rameses II. It
is thought that this hall was originally roofed over. At
the end of it is the third propylon, which was built by
Amenophis IIL, and served as the entrance to the temple
until the time of Rameses I. Between this and the next
pylon is a narrow passage, in the middle of which stood two
obelisks which were set up by Thothmcs L; the southern
one is still standing, and bears the names of this king, but
the northern one has fallen,' and its fragments show that
Thothmes HL caused his name to be carved on it. At the
southern end of this passage are the remains of a gate built
by Rameses IX. The fourth and fifth pylons were built by
Thothmes I. Between them stood fourteen columns, six of
which were set up by Thothmes I., and eight by Amenophis
II, and two granite obelisks; one of these still stands.
These ohelisks were hewn out of the granite quarry by the
command of 1.mshepset,t the daughter of Thothmes 1., and
sister of Thothmes II. and Thothmes IH. This able
woman set them up in honour of “father Amen," and
she relates in the inscriptions on the base of the standing
obelisk that she covered their tops with .rmu metal, or copper,
that they could be seen from a very great distance, and that
she had them hewn and brought down to Thebes in about
seven months. These obelisks were brought into their
chamber from the south side, and were 98 and lot, feet high"
respectively; the masonry round their bases is of the time
of Thothmes III. The sixth pylon and the two walls which

, "Scarcely had the ioyal brother and husband of Hashop (sic)
closed his eyes, when the proud queen threw aside her woman's veil,
and appeared in all the splendour of Lharaoh, as a born king. For she
laid aside her woman's dress, clothed herself in man's attire, and
adorned herself with the crown and insignia of royalty." (Brugsch's
