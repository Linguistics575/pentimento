the rock and swim out to any passing boat to beg for
charity; the Patriarch has forbidden this practice, but it is
not entirely discontinued. Two or three miles from the
convent are some ancient quarries having rock bas-reliefs
representing Rameses III. making an offering to the croco-
dile god Sebek Fm before Amen-Ra.

MINYEH.

Minyeh, ri6rl, miles from Cairo, on the west bank of the
Nile, is the capital of the province of the same name; its
Arabic name is derived from the Coptic Mone, ALONE,

which in turn represents the Egyptian Et9, Mort in its old
=

name Chufu-menit. There is a large sugar factory here in

which about 2,000 men are employed. A few miles south,

rm the eastern side of the river, are some tombs, which

appear to have been hcwn during the led or IVth dynasty.
BENI HASAN.

Beni Has√©n, I7I miles from Cairo, on the cast bank
of the Nile, is remarkable for the valuable historical tombs
which are situated at a short distance from the site of the
villages grouped under that name. The villages of thc
" Children of Hass"m" were destroyed by order of Muham-
mad 'Ali on account of the thievish propensities of their
inhabitants, The Speos Artemidos is the first rock eNTya-
vation visited here. The king who first caused this cavern
to be hcwn out was Thothmcs ill.; about 250 years later
Scti I. made additions to it, but it seems never to have been
finished. The cavern was dedicated to the lion-goddess
Scchet, who was called Artemis by the Greeks; hence the
name "cavern of Artemis." Thc portico had originally
two rows of columns, four in each; the cavern is about
21 feet square, and the niche in the wall at the end was
probably intended to hold a statue of Sechet.
