THE SPHINX.

The age of the Sphinx is unknown, and few of the facts
connected with its history have come down to these days.
Some years ago it was generally believed to have been
made during the rule of the kings of the Middle Empire over
Egypt, but when the stcic which recorded the repairs made
in the temple of the Sphinx by Thothmes IV., B.C. 1533,
came to light, it became certain that it was the work of one
of the kings of the Ancient Empire. The stele records that
one day during an after-dinner sleep, Harmachis appeared to
Thothmes IV., and promised to bestow upon him the crown
of Egypt if he would dig his image, i.e., the Sphinx, out of
the sand. At the end of the inscription part of the name
of Chi-f-Ra or Chephren appears, and hence some have
thought that this king was the maker of the Sphinx; as the
statue of Chephren was subsequently found in the temple
close by, this theory was generally adopted. An inscription
found by Mariette near one of the pyramids to the east of
the pyramid of Cheops shows that the Sphinx existed in
the time of Chufu or Cheops. The Egyptians called the
Sphinx [mi bsss, and he represented the god Harmachis,

i.e., Wru-etrt-chttt l, E Sh, "Horus in the horizon," or
the rising sun, the conqueror of darkness, the god of the
morning. On the tablet erected by Thothmcs 1V., Harma-
chis says that he gave lite and dominion to Thothmes Ill.,
and he promises to give the same good gifts to his SUC-
cessor Thothmes IV. The discovery of the steps which led
up to the Sphinx, a smaller Sphinx, and ttn open temple,
etc., was made by Caviglia, who first excavated this monu-
ment; within the last few years very extensive excavations
have been made round it by the Egyptian Government, and
several hitherto unseen parts of it have been brought to
view. The Sphinx is hewn out of the living rock, but pieces
of stone have been added where necessary J the body is
