Thoth, the righteous judge of' the great cycle of the gods
who are in the presence of the god Osiris, saith, "Hear ye
this judgment. The heart of Osiris hath in very truth been
weighed and his soul hath stood as a witness for him; his
trial in the Great Balance is true. There hath not been
found any wickedness in him; he hath not wasted the
offerings in the temples; he hath not harmed any by his
works; and he uttered not evil reports while he was upon
earth."

Next the great cycle of the gods reply to Thoth dwelling
in Khemennu (Hermopolis): "That which cometh forth
from thy mouth cannot be gainsaid. Osiris, the scribe
Ani, the victorious one in judgment, is just and righteous.
He hath not committed sin, neither hath he done evil
against us. The Devourer shall not be allowed to prevail
over him; he shall be allowed to enter into the presence of
the god Osiris, and offerings of meat and drink shall be
given unto him, together with an abiding habitation in
Sekhet-betepu, as unto the followers of Horus."

In the second part of this scene we have Ani being led
into the presence of the god Osiris. On the left the hawk-
