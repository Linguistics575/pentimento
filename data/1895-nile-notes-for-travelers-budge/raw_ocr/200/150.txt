126 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

as a means of transport for troops from one point to
another. The name of the place Kantara, 'a bridge,' a
little to the north of Isma'iliya, seems to point to the fact of
a ford existing here from very early times. Nckau (RC. 610)
began to make a canal at Bubastis, between the Nile and
the Red Sea, but never finished it; it was continued in later
times by Darius, and Ptolemy Philadelphus made a lock
for it; still later we know that the Mediterranean and Red
Seas were joined by a canal. The emperor Trajan made a
canal from Cairo to the Red Sea, which, having become
impassable, was re-opened by '0mar's general, 'Amr ibn
er'hsy, after his capture of Egypt.

In the Middle Ages various attempts were made in a
half-hearted manner to cut a new canal across the Isthmus,
but although several royal personages in and out of Egypt
were anxious to see the proposed work begun, nothing was
seriously attempted until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte
directed M. Lepbre to survey the route of a canal across the
Isthmus. M. Lep√©re reported that the difference between
the levels of the Red Sea and Mediterranean was thirty-three
feet, and, that, therefore, the canal was impossible.' Although
several scientific men doubted the accuracy of M. Lepbre's
conclusion, the fact that the level of the two seas is practically
the same was not proved until M. Linant Bey, Stephenson,
and others examined the matter in 1846. It was then at
once evident that a canal wax possible. M. de Lesseps
laid the plans for a canal before Sa'id Pasha in 1854; two
years afterwards they were sanctioned, and two years later
the works began, The original plan proposed to make a

gMeteorohygica, i. 14, 27; Diodoms, i. 23; and Strabo, xvii. I, 25.
The Arab writer Mas"tuli relates that a certain king tried to cut
a canal across this isthmus, but that on finding that the waters of the
Red Sea stood at a higher level than those of the Mediterranean, he
abandoned his project. (Les Prairie: d'Or, t. iv, p. 97.)
