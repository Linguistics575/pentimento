232 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

Egypt finished the pyramid and made a second chamber to
hold his or her body. At a short distance to the east of
this pyramid are the ruins of a temple which was probably
used in connexion with the rites performed in honour of the
dead king. In A.D. 1196 a deliberate and systematic
attempt was made to destroy this pyramid by the command
of the Muhammadan ruler of Egypt." The account of the
character of Mycerinus and of his pyramid as given by
Herodotus is as follows: "They said that after him,
Mycerinus,t son of Cheops, reigned over Egypt; that the
conduct of his father was displeasing to him; and that he
opened the temples, and permitted the people, who were
worn down to the last extremity, to return to their employ-
ments, and to sacrifices; and that he made the most just
decisions of all their kings. On this account, of all the
kings that ever reigned in Egypt, they praise him most, for
he both judged well in other respects, and moreover, when
any man complained of his decision, he used to make him
some present out of his own treasury and pacify his anger.
...... This king also left a pyramid much less than that
of his father, being on each side twenty feet short of three
plethra; it is quadrangular, and built half way up of Ethio-
pian stone. Some of the Grecians erroneously say that this
pyramid is the work of the courtesan Rhodopis; but they
evidently appear to me ignorant who Rhodopis was; for
they would not else have attributed to her the building ufsuch
a pyramid, on which, so to speak, numbcrless thousands
of talents were expended; besides, Rhodopis flourished in
the reign of Amasis, and not at this time , for she was very
many years later than those kings who left these pyramids."
(Cary's translation.)

In one of the three small pyramids near that of Mycerinus
the name of this king is painted on the ceiling.
