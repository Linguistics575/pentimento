CAIRO. 147

stones used were taken from the pyramids of Gizeh; it
formed a part of the large system of the fortifications of
Cairo which this Sultan carried out so thoroughly. Though
admirably situated for commanding the whole city, and as a
fortress in the days before long range cannon were invented,
the site was shown in 1805 to be ill Chosen for the purposes
of defence in modern times by Muhammad 'Ali, who, by
means of l battery placed on the Mokattnm heights, com-
polled Khurshid Pasha to surrender the citadel. In the
narrow way, with a high wall, through the B21) el-Arab,
which was formerly the most direct and most used means of
access to it, the massacre of the Mamelukcs took place by
the orders of Muhammad 'Ali, A.D. 181 I. The single
Mamehike who escaped is said to have made his horse leap
down from one of the walls of the Citadel; he refused to
enter the narrow way.
JOSEPHâ€™S WELL.

This well is not called after Joseph the Patriarch, as is
usually supposed, but after the famous S.raliibeddin (Saladin),
whose first name was Ytisuf or Joseph. The shaft of this
well, in two parts, is about 280 feet deep, and was found
to be choked up with sand when the Citadel was built;
Saladin caused it to be cleared out, and from his time until
1865 its water was regularly drawn up and used. This
well was probably sunk by the ancient Egyptians.

THE LIBRARY.

This valuable institution was founded by Ismael in 1870,
and contains the library of Mustnfa Pasha; the number
of works in the whole collection is said to be about 24,000.
Some of the copies of the Koran preserved there are among
the oldest known,
