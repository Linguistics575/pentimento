the greater number found measure from half cm inch to two
inches, and are made of steatite glazed green, or blue, or
brown; granite, basalt, jasper, amethyst, lapis-lazuli, war-
nelian, and glass. The flat base of the scarab was used
by the Egyptians for engraving with names of gods, kings,
priests, officials, private persons, monograms and devices.
Scarabs were set in rings and worn on the fingers by the
dead or living, or were wrapped up in the linen bandages
with which the mummy was swathed, and placed over the
heart. The best class of funereal scarabs were made of a
fine, hard, green basalt, which, when the instructions of the
rubric concerning them in the Book of the Dead were
carried out, were set in a gold border, and hung from the
neck by a fine gold wire. Such scarabs are sometimes
joined to a heart on which is inscribed, "life, stability, and

protection" ? , ' Funcrcal scarabs were also set in

pectorals, and were in this case ornamented with figures oi
the deceased adoring Osiris. Scarabs of all kinds were
kept in stock by the Egyptian Undertaker, and spaces were
left blank in the inscriptions' to add the names of the
persons for whom they were bought. Scarabs worn for
ornament exist in many thousands. By an easy transition,
the custom of placing scarabs on the bodies of the dead
passed to the living, and men and women wore the scarab
probably as a silent act of homage to the creator of the
world, who was not only the god of the dead, but of the
living also. Historical scarabs appear to be limited to
a series of four, which were made during the reign of
Amenophis III. to commemorate certain historical events,
