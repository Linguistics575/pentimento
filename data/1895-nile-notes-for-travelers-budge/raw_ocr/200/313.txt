Thekeleth, Sabaco, Nectanebus L, and the Ptolemies. Be-
hind the temple enclosure are the remains of a temple
dedicated to Ptah of Memphis by Thothmes IH.; the three

leads from Luxor to Karnak, a second smaller avenue orna-

entered; at the end of it stands the splendid pylon built
by Ptolemy IX, Euergetes II. Passing through the door, a
