96 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

MUT a , the 'Mother/was one of the divinities of

the Theban triad; she was supposed to represent Nature,
the mother of all things.

CHEFERA ii, the 'Creator,' was associated with

Ptah, and was supposed to be the god who caused himself
to come into existence. He is represented with a beetle
for his head. In later days he was supposed to be the father
of the gods and creator of the universe, and the attributes
which had been applied to RE during the Middle Empire
were transferred to him. (See pp. 200~202.)

BAST cg was principally worshipped in Lower Egypt
at Bubastis, where a magnificent temple was built in her
honour (see p. 130); she is represented with the head of a
cat, and was associated with Ptab. The correct reading of
her name appears to be Sechet, and she represents the flame
of the S 'll.
