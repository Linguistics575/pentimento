EGYPTIAN HISTORY. 7

Manetho, and Diodorus Siculus. Herodotus devotes the
whole of the second and the beginning of the third book
of his work to a history of Egypt and the Egyptians, and his
is the oldest Greek treatise on the subject known to us.
In spite of the attacks made upon his work during the
last few years, the evidence of the hieroglyphic inscriptions
which are being deciphered year after year shows that on
the whole his work is trustworthy. A work more valuable
than that of Herodotus is the Egyptian history of Manetho
(still living in B.C. 271) of Sebennytus, who is said by
Plutarch to have been a contemporary of Ptolemy L; his
work, however, was written during the reign of Ptolemy II.
Philadelphus (B.c. 286--247). According to words put into
his mouth, he was chief priest and scribe in one of" the
temples of Egypt, and he appears to have been perfectly
acquainted with the ancient Egyptian language and literature.
He had also had the benefit of a Greek education, and
was therefore peculiarly fitted to draw up in Greek for
Ptolemy Philadelphus a history of Egypt and her religion.
The remains of the great Egyptian history of Manetho are
preserved in the polemical treatise of Josephus against
Apion, in which a series of passages of Egyptian history
from the XVth to the XIXth dynasties is given, and in the
list of the dynasties, together with the number of years of
the reign of each king, given by Africanus and Eusebius
on his authority. At the beginning of his work Manetho
gives a list of gods and demi-gods who ruled over Egypt
before Menes, the first human king of Egypt; the thirty
dynasties known to us he divides into three sections:-
I-XI, XII-XIX, and XX-XXX. Diodorus Siculus,
who visited Egypt B.C. 57, wrote a history of the country,
its people and its religion, based chiiefly upon the works of
Herodotus and Hekataeus. He was not so able a writer
nor so accurate an observer as Herodotus, and his work
contains many blunders. Other important ancient writers
