134 NOTES FOR TRAVEL'LE'RS 1N EGYPT.

Amenemhat 11., a sandstone statue of Usertsen 11., an
inscribed granite fragment of Usertsen 111., and two statues
of Sebek-hetep Ill. Following these come the most interest-
ing black granite sphinxes, which are usually said to be the
work of the so-called Hyksos (see pp. 174--r75), but which
are, in my opinion, older than the period when these people
ruled over Lower Egypt. The cartouches inscribed upon
them only prove that many kings were anxious to have
their names added to these monuments. The greatest
builder at Tanis was Rameses 11., who erected a temple
with pylons, colossal statues, obelisks and sphinxes.
Pasebkhanu, Shashanq I. and Shashanq 111. repaired and
added to the buildings in Tanis, and they took the
opportunity of usurping sphinxes, obelisks, etc., which
had been set up by earlier kings. The famous red granite
"Tablet of four hundred years" was found at San. The
inscription upon it, which is of the time of Rameses 11., is
dated in the four hundredth year of a Hyksos king named

"ha-peb-peb-Set, son of the Sun, Nub-Set fo'' C'iii-Cici':i'j:iji')

g) Cj), N], which appears to prove that this king

reigned 400 years before the time of Rameses II.

The last native king of Egypt whose name is mentioned
at Tanis is Nectanebus 11., and after him come the
Ptolemies. The stele, commonly called the â€œDecree of
Canopus," which was set up in the ninth year of Ptolemy
IH., Euergetes I. (B.C. 238), was found here. The tri-
lingual inscription in hieroglyphics, Greek, and Demotic,
mentions at some length the great benefits which this king
had conferred upon Egypt, and states what festivals are to
be celebrated in his honour and in that of Berenice. The
priests assembled at Canopus from all parts of Egypt
resolved that these things should be duly inscribed upon
stelae, of which one should be placed in every large temple
in Egypt to commemorate their resolution.
