CAIRO. I45

The Mosque of KAIT Bey (A.D. r468-r496), one of the
last independent Mameluke sultans of Egypt, is about eighty
feet long and seventy feet wide; it has some fine mosaics,
and is usually considered the finest piece of architecture in
Cairo.

The Mosque el-Ghtm' was built by the Sultan Kansuweh
el-Ght1ri early in the sixteenth century; it is one pf the
most beautiful mosques in Cairo.

The Mosque of Sittah Zénab was begun late in the last
century; it contains the tomb of Zénab, the granddaughter
of the Prophet.

The Mosque begun by Muhammad 'Ali in the Citadel
was fmished in 1857 by Sa'id Pasha, after the death (in 1849)
of that ruler; it is built of alabaster from the quarries of
Beni Suéf. As with nearly all mosques built by the Turks,
the church of the Hagia Sophia at Constantinople served
as the model, but the building is not considered of remark-
able beauty. The mosque is a square covered by a large
dome and four small ones. In the south-east corner is
the tomb of Muhammad 'Ali, and close by is the mimbar

L-si-s) or pulpit , in the recess on the east side is the

/0
Kiblah (gig), or spot to which the Mulyammadan turns

his face during his prayers. The court is square, with one
row of pillars on each of its four sides, and in the centre
is the fountain for the Turks; the clock in the tower on
the western side was presented to Muhammad 'Ali by
Louis Philippe.

The Mosque of el-f.Tasanén, i.e., the mosque of Hasan
and Husén, the sons of 'Ali the son-in-law of the Prophet,
is said to contain the head of Husén who was slain at
Kerbela A.D. 680 , the head was first sent to Damascus and
afterwards brought to Cairo.

In the Mosque of el-Akbar the dancing dervishes

perform.
