4 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

was drawn up in the time of Thothmes III., and contains
the names of sixty-one of his ancestors. They are not
arranged in any chronological order, but the tablet is of the
highest historical importance, for it records the names of
some of the rulers from the XIIIth to the XVIIth
dynasties, and gives the names of those of the XIth
dynasty more completely than any other list.

Il.' Annals of Egyptian Kings inscribed upon the
walls of temples, obelisks, and buildings. The narrative of
such inscriptions is very simple, and practically these records
merely represent itineraries in which the names of conquered
and tributary lands and people are given ; incidentally facts
of interest are noted down. As the day and month and
regnal years of the king by whom these expeditions were
undertaken are generally given, these inscriptions throw
much light on history. The lists of tribute are also useful,
for they show what the products of the various countries
were. The poetical version' of the history of the famous
battle of Rameses II. against the Cheta by the poet Pen-ea-un
is a pleasant variety of historical narrative. The inscription
on the stelet of Pianchi, the Ethiopian conqueror of Egypt,
is decidedly remarkable for the minute details of his fights,
the speeches made by himself and his conquered foes, and
the mention of many facts:) which are not commonly noticed
by Egyptian annalists. The vigour and poetical nature of
the narrative are also very striking.

I For example, it is stated that when Piiinchi had taken possession
of the storehouses and treasury of Nimrod his foe, he went afterwards
into the stables, and found that the horses there had been kept short ot
food. Bursting into a rage he turned to Nimrod and said, "By my
life, by my darling Ra, who revives my nostrils with life, to have kept
my horses hungry is more heinous in my sight than any other offence
which thou hast committed against me." Mariette, Mouumeuts Divers,
