bank of the river, is prettily situated, and worth a visit.

PHIL/E.

Philae is the name given by the Greeks and Romans to
the smaller of two islands situated at the head of the first
cataract, about six miles above Aswan; the larger one is
called Biggeh. Inscriptions found on rocks in the larger
island show that as far back as the time of Amenophis ll.
an Egyptian temple stood here; the greater number of
these inscriptions were cut by Egyptian officials on their
way to and from Nubia. The smaller island, to which the
name Philae is generally confined, consists of a granite rock,
the sides of which, having been scarped, have had walls
built on them; it measures 417 yards long and 135 yards
wide. The name of this island in Egyptian was d?s Ifzit
P-iia-leq, Coptic mhaz, i.e., 'the frontier.' The monu-
ments on this island are numerous and interesting, but they
belong to a comparatively late date, none that have yet been
found being older than the time of Nectanebus, the last native
king of Egypt. On the south-west corner are the remains
of the small temple which this king dedicated to Isis.
The most important ruins are those of the Temple of Isis,
which was begun by Ptolemy II. Philadelphus and Arsino√©,
and was added to and completed by the Ptolemies and
Roman emperors who came after. On each side of the
path which led to the temple is a corridor: that on the west
has thirty-two pillars and that on the east sixteen; at
the north end of the east corridor is the so-called chapel of
:Esculapius, which was built by Ptolemy V. Epiphanes and
