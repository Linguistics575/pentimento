called in Arabic May: * '. it is the largest city in Africa, and
its population must be now about half a million souls.

writers are valuable in one respect, for they show that it
was believed in their time that Babylon of Egypt was

Egypt, and remains of the town and fortress which these
legionaries occupied are still to be seen a little to the

and to which he returned after his capture of Alexandria.
Around his tent lived a large number of his followers, and
