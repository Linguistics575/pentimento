I40 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

The Jewish synagogue near Abu Sargah was originally a
Coptic church dedicated to St. Michael, which was sold to
the Jews by a patriarch called Michael towards the end of
the ninth century; it measures (is feet x 35 feet, and is
said to contain a copy of the Law written by Ezra.

A little to the south-east of Abu Sargah is the church
dedicated to the Virgin, more commonly called El-
Mu'allaliah, or the 'hanging,' from the fact that it is sus-
pended between two bastions, and must be entered by a
staircase. The church is triapsal, and is of the basilican
order. It originally contained some very beautiful screens,
which have been removed from their original positions and
made into a sort of wall, and, unfortunately, modern
stained glass has been made to replace the old. The cedar
doors, sculptured in panels, are now in the British Museum.
The cedar and ivory screens are thought to belong to the
eleventh century. The church is remarkable in having no
choir, and Mr. Butler says it is "a double-aisled church, and
as such is remarkable in having no transepts." The pulpit
is one of the most valuable things left in the church, and
probably dates from the twelfth century; in the wooden
coffer near it are the bones of four saints. Authorities
differ as to the date to be assigned to the founding of this
church, but all the available evidence now known would
seem to point to the sixth century as the most probable
period , at any rate, it must have been before the betrayal
of the fortress of Babylon to 'Amr by the Monophysite
Copts in the seventh century.

A little to the north-east of Abu Sargah is the church of
St. Barbara, the daughter of a man of position in the East,
who was martyred during the persecution of Maximinus; it
was built probably during the eighth century. In the
church is a picture of the saint, and a chapel in honour of
St. George. At the west end of the triforium are some
mural paintings of great interest.
