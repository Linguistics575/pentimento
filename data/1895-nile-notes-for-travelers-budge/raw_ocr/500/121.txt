_ <30

RA the Sun-god, was the creator of gods and
, l I '

men , his emblem was the sun's disk. His worship was
very ancient, and he was said to be the offspring of Nut, or
the sky. He assumed the forms of several other gods, and
is at times represented by the lion, cat, and hawk. In
papyri and on bas-reliefs he is represented with the head of
a hawk and wearing a disk, in front of which is an uraeus 2.
He was particularly adored at Thebes. When he rose in the
morning he was called f.leru-chuti or Harmachis; and at
night, when he set, he was called Atmu, or 'the closer.'
During the night he was supposed to be engaged in fighting
Apepi, the serpent, who, at the head of a large army of
fiends, personifications of mist, darkness, and cloud, tried to
overthrow him. The battle was fought daily, but R21 always
conquered, and appeared day after day in the sky.

HORUS, j) Heru, is the morning sun, and is also

represented as having the head of a hawk ; he was said to
be the son of Isis and Osiris, and is usually called the
"avenger of his father," in reference to his defeat of Set.
