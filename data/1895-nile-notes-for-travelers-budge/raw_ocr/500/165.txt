CAIRO. 141

Within the walls of the fortress of Babylon, lying due
north of Abu Sargah, are the two churches of Mar Girgis
and the Virgin.

To the south of the fortress of Babylon, beyond the
Muhammadan village on the rising ground, lie the Der of
Babltm and the Der of Tadrus. In Dér el-Babltm is a
church to the Virgin, which is very difficult to see. It
contains some fine mural paintings, and an unusual candle-
stick and lectern , in it also are chapels dedicated to Saints

Gchael and George. This little building is about fifty-three
feet square. Der el-Tadrus contains two churches dedicated
to Saints Cyrus and John of Damanhtu. in the Delta , there
are' some fine specimens of vestments to be seen there.

A short distance from the Mt1ski is a Der containing the
churches of the Virgin, St. George, and the chapel of Abu's
Séfen. The church of the Virgin occupies the lower half of
the building, and is the oldest in Cairo. The chapel of Abu's
Séfén is reached through a door in the north-west corner of
the building, and contains a wooden pulpit inlaid with
ivory. The church of St. George occupies the upper part
of the building, and is over the church of the Virgin.

In the Greek (Byzantine) quarter of Cairo is the D& el-Tad-
rus, which contains the churches of St. George and the Virgin.

The Coptic churches of Cairo contain a great deal that is
interesting, and are well worth many visits. Though the
fabrics of many of them are not older than the sixth,
seventh, or eighth century of our era, it may well be
assumed that the sites were occupied by Coptic churches
long before this period.
