THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT. 73

lation than that of the Middle and New Empires, in which
the nature and mutual relationships of the gods were dis-
cussed and theogonies formulated. Speaking generally the
gods of Egypt were the everlasting and unalterable powers
of nature, i.e., 'day and night,' 'light and darkness,' etc.
The great god of the Egyptians, Ra, or Amen-Ra, as he was
called in the Middle Empire, was said to be the maker of
all things; the various gods Horus, Atmu, etc., were merely
forms of him. Ra was self-begotten, and hymns to him
never cease to proclaim his absolute and perfect unity in
terms which resemble those of the Hebrew Scriptures. It
will be seen from the translation of a hymn given in the
following pages that he is made to possess every attribute,
natural and spiritual, which Christian peoples ascribe to God

les matériaux sont énormes, plus on est nlr que les promesses faites par
la religion recevront leur execution. En ces sens, les Pyramides ne
sont pas des monuments 'de la vaine ostentation des rois' ; elles sont
des obstacles impossible; a renverser, et les preuves gigantesques d'un
dogme consolant." (Mariette, Notices des Prz'mipaux Mouurueuts,

p. 44.)
