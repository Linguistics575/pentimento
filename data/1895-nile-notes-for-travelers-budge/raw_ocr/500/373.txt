THE NILE BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND CATARACTS. 349

(Bk. m., chap. Vi.) Many of the Ptolemies appear to have
made additions to the temple at Dakkeh.

On the east bank of the river opposite Dakkeh is Kubén,
called J%Uk& Baka, in the hieroglyphics, a
village which is said to mark the site of Tachompso or
Metachompso, " the place of crocodiles.” As Pselcis
increased, so Tachompso declined, and became finally
merely a suburb of that town , it was generally called
Contra-Pselcis. During the XV111th and XIXth dynasties
this place was well fortified by the Egyptians, and on many
blocks ofstone close by are foundthenames of Thothmes IH.,
f.leru-em-heb, and Rameses ll. It appears to have been the
point from which the wretched people condemned to labour
in the gold mines in the desert of the land of Akita set out;
and an interesting inscription on a stone found here relates
that Rameses IL, having heard that much gold existed in
this land, which was inaccessible on account of the absolute
want of water, bored a well in the mountain, twelve cubits
deep, so that henceforth men could come and go by
this land. His father Seti I. had bored a well 120 cubits
deep, but no water appeared in it.

About 20 miles from Dakkeh, and 690 from Cairo, on the
west bank of the river, is Wédi Seblla, or the "Valley
of the Lions," where there are the remains of a temple
partly built of sandstone, and partly excavated in the rock;
the place is so called on account of the dromos of sixteen
sphinxes which led up to the temple. On the sculptures
which still remain here may be seen Rameses IL, the
builder of the temple, "making an offering of incense to
father Amen, the king of the gods," who says to him, "I give
to thee all might, and I give the world to thee, in peace."
Elsewhere the king is making offerings to Tefnut, lady of
heaven, Nebt-hetep, Horus and Thoth, each of whom
promises to bestow some blessing upon him. On another
part is a boat containing a ram-headed god, and Harmachis
