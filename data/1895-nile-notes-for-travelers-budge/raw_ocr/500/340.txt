Tomb of N ekht at Shekh Abd al-Kurnah.

This beautiful little tomb was opened out in the year
1889, but there is little doubt that it was known to the
inhabitants of Kurnah some time before. Though small,
it is of considerable interest, and the freshness of the
colours in the scenes is unusual; it is, moreover, a fine

tomb of Nekht consists of two chambers, but the larger one
only is ornamented; the ceiling is painted with a wave
pattern, and the cornice is formed of the hutkertt pattern
