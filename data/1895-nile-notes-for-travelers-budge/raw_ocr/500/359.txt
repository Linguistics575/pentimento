lived during the VIth and XIIth dynasties. The second group
is composed of tombs of different periods , they are hewn out
of a lower layer of stone, and are not of so much importance.
The third group, made during the Roman occupation of
Egypt, lies at a comparatively little height above the river.
All these tombs were broken into at a very early period, and
