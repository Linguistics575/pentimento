In Case A are arranged a fine collection of small sepul-
chral figures called in Egyptian ushahtiu. They are made
of stone, alabaster, wood, glazed fdioue, and are in the
form of the god Osiris, who is here represented in the form
of a mummy. They were placed in the tomb to do certain
agricultural works for the deceased, who was supposed to be
condemned to sow the fields, to fill the canals with water,
and to carry sand from the West to the East. They are
usually inscribed with the VIth Chapter of the Book of the
Dead. As many travellers buy ushabtiu figures in Egypt,
the following version of the chapter may be of interest to
them.
