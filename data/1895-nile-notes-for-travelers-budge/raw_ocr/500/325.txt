" vocal Memnon" and heard the sound; one Petronianus,
of a poetical turn of mind, stated that it made a sighing

IV. Medinet Habt1.---This village lies to the south of
the colossi, and its foundation dates from Coptic times. The
early Christians established themselves around the ancient
Egyptian temple there, and hav1ng carefully plastered over

Coptic inscriptions have been found, which prove that the
Coptic community here was one of the largest and most

Thothmes IH., and the later by Rameses III. The first
court of the temple of Thothmes III. was built during the
time of the Roman occupation of Egypt, and the names of
Titus, Hadrian, Antoninus, etc., are found on various parts
of its walls. The half-built pylon at the end of this court
is of the same period, although the door between them
bears the names of Ptolemy X. Soter II. (Lathyrus) and
Ptolemy XIII., Neos Dionysos (Auletes). The little court
and pylon beyond are inscribed with the names of Tirhakah,
B.C. 693, and Nectanebus IL, B.C. 358. Passing through
this last court and its pylon, the temple proper is reached.
The oldest name found here is that of Thothmes II. The
work begun by this king was completed by Thothmes III.,
and several subsequent kings restored or added new parts
to it.

The interior chambers were ornamented with sculptures, on
which were depicted scenes in the domestic O) life of the
