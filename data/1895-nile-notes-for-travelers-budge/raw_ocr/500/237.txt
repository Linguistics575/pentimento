THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH. 2r3

after death had already become a part of the life of the
people of Egypt. During the reign of King Sent the
redaction of a medical papyrus was carried out. As this
work presupposes many years of experiment and experience,
it is clear that the Egyptians possessed ample anatomical
knowledge for mummifying a human body. Again, if we
consider that the existence of this king is proved by papyri
and contemporaneous monuments, and that we know the
names of some of the priests who took part in funereal
ceremonies during his reign, there is no diffoculty in
acknowledging the great antiquity of such ceremonies, and

We obtain our knowledge of the way in which the
ancient Egyptians mummified their dead from Greek
historians, and from an examination of mummies. Ac-
cording to Herodotus (ii. 86) the art of mummifying was
carried on by a special guild of men who received their
appointment by law. These men mummified bodies in
