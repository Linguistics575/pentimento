CAIRO. I47

stones used were taken from the pyramids of Gizeh , it
formed a part of the large system of the fortifications of
Cairo which this Sultan carried out so thoroughly. Though
admirably situated for commanding the whole city, and as a
fortress in the days before long range cannon were invented,
the site was shown in 1805 to be ill chosen for the purposes
of defence in modern times by Muhammad 'Ali, who, by
means of a battery placed on the Moliattam heights, com-
pelled Khurshid Pasha to surrender the citadel. In the
narrow way, with a high wall, through the Bill) el-Azalo,
which was formerly the most direct and most used means of
access to it, the massacre of the Mamelukes took place by
the orders of Muhammad 'Ali, A.D. 1811. The single
Mameluke who escaped is said to have made his horse leap
down from one of the walls of the Citadel; he refused to
enter the narrow way.

JOSEPH’S WELL.

This well is not called after Joseph the Patriarch, as is
usually supposed, but after the famous Saléheddin (Saladin),
whose first name was VC1suf or Joseph. The shaft of this
well, in two parts, is about 280 feet deep, and was found
to be choked up with sand when the Citadel was built;
Saladin caused it to be cleared out, and from his time until
1865 its water was regularly drawn up and used. This
well was probably sunk by the ancient Egyptians.

THE LIBRARY.

This valuable institution was founded by Isma'il in 1870,
and contains the library of Mustafa Pasha , the number
of works in the whole collection is said to be about 24,000.
Some of the copies of the Koran preserved there are among
the oldest known.
