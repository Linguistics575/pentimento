EGYPTIAN HISTORY. 3

god, lord of the two earths.'" In the earliest times the
kings were named after some attribute possessed by them ,
thus Meni, the first king of Egypt, is the "firm" or "estab-

the kings are given, but its statements are confirmed and
amplified by the other lists.

The Tablet of Abydost was discovered by Diimichen
in the temple of Osiris at Abydos, during M. Mariette's
excavations there in 1864. This list gives us the names
of seventy-five kings, beginning with Mena or Menes, and
ending with Seti I., the father of Rameses IL; it is not a
complete list, and it would seem as if the scribe who drew
up the list only inserted such names as he considered
worthy of living for ever. The Tablet of Saetriiraht was
discovered at Sakkarah by Mariette, in the grave of a digni-
tary who lived during the reign of Rameses I I. In spite of
a break in it, and some orthographical errors, it is a valuable
list; it gives the names of forty-seven kings, and it agrees
very closely with the Abydos list. It is a curious fact that
it begins with the name of Mer-ba-pen, the sixth king of
the Ist dynasty. The Tablet of Karnak was discovered at
Karnak by Burton, and was taken to Paris by Prisse. It
