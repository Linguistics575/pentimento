IVth, and VIth dynasties, the kings of which sprang from
Memphis, that city reached a height of splendour which
was probably never excelled. The most celebrated building
there was the temple of Ptah, which was beautified and
adorned by a number of kings, the last of whom reigned
during the XXVIth dynasty. The Hyksos ravaged, but did
not destroy, the city; under the rule of the Theban kings,
who expelled the Hyksos, the city flourished for a time,
