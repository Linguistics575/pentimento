THE PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH. 227

them to the mountain called the Libyan. And they worked
to the number of 100,000 men at a time, each party during
three months. The time during which the people were
thus harassed by toil, lasted ten years on the road which
they constructed, along which they drew the stones, a work
in my opinion, not much less than the pyramid; for its
length is five stades (3,051 feet), and its width ten orgyae
(60 feet), and its height, where it is the highest, eight orgyae
( 48 feet) ; and it is of polished stone, with figures carved on
it: on this road these ten years were expended, and in
forming the subterraneous apartments on the hill, on which
the pyramids stand, which he had made as a burial vault for
himself, in an island, formed by draining a canal from the
Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting the pyramid
itself: of this, which is square, each face is eight plethra
(820 feet), and the height is the same; it is composed of
polished stones, and jointed with the greatest exactness ,
none of the stones are less than thirty feet. This pyramid
was built thus; in the form of steps, which some call
crossae, others bomides.' When they had first built it in
this manner, they raised the remaining stones by machines
made of short pieces of wood : having lifted them from the
ground to the first range of steps, when the stone arrived
there, it was put on another machine that stood ready on
the first range; and from this it was drawn to the second
range on another machine ; for the machines were equal in
number to the ranges of steps; or they removed the
machine, which was only one, and portable, to each range in
succession, whenever they wished to raise the stone higher ,
for I should relate it in both ways, as it is related. The
highest parts of it, therefore, were first finished, and after-
wards they completed the parts next following; but last of
all they finished the parts on the ground and that were
lowest. On the pyramid is shown an inscription, in
Egyptian characters, how much was expended in radishes,
