THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. 33

Bible , this word may be compared with the Coptic
RHAAC, RHRAi or XHLU. The children of Ham are
said to be Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. The second
of these, Misraim, is the name given to Egypt by the
Hebrews. The dual form of the word, which means "the
double Mis.sor," probably has reference to the "two lands "
(in Egypt. 1=:.il'.iz'il=z',), over which the Egyptian kings, in their
inscriptions, proclaimed their rule. The descendants of .
Cush are represented on the monuments by the inhabitants
of Nubia and the negro tribes which live to the south of
that country. In the earliest times the descendants of Cush
appear to have had the same religion as the Egyptians. The
Put of the Bible is thought by some to be represented by
the land of Punt, or spice-land, of the monuments. The
people of Punt appear to have dwelt on both sides of the
Red Sea to the south of Egypt and on the Somali coast,
and as far back as B.C. 2500 a large trade was carried
on between them and the Egyptians ; it is thought that the
Egyptians regarded them as kinsmen. The aboriginal
inhabitants of Phoenicia were probably the kinsfolk of the
descendants of Misraim, called by the Bible Canaanites.
Diodorus and some other classical authorities tell us that
Egypt was colonized from Ethiopia , for this view, however,
there is no support. The civilization, religion, art of
building, etc., of the Ethiopians are all of Egyptian origin,
and in this, as in so many other points relating to the
history of Egypt, the Greeks were either misinformed, or
they misunderstood what they were told.

An examination of the painted representations of the
Egyptians by native artists shows us that the pure Egyptian
was of slender make, with broad shoulders, long hands and feet,
and sinewy legs and arms. His forehead was high, his chin
square, his eyes large, his cheeks full, his mouth wide, his lips
full, and his nose short and rounded. His jaws protruded
slightly, and his hair was smooth and fine. The evidence
