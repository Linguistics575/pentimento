THE PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH.

On the western bank of the Nile, from Abu Roash on
the north to Médtom on the south, is a slightly elevated
tract of land, about twenty-iive miles long, on the edge of
the Libyan desert, on which stand the pyramids of Abu
Roash, Gizeh, Ltwyet el-'Aryitn, Abusir, Sal.d.ritrah, and
Dahslulr. Other places in Egypt where pyramids are found
are El-lah) in the F ayytlm, and Kullah near Esneh. The
pyramids built by the Ethiopians at Meroé and Gebel
Barkal are of a very late date (15.0. 6ocr-roo), and are
mere copies, in respect of form only, of the pyramids in
Egypt. It is well to state at once that the pyramids
were tombs and nothing else. There is no evidence
whatever to show that they were built for purposes of
astronomical observations, and the theory that the Great
Pyramid was built to serve as a standard of measurement is
ingenious but worthless. The significant fact, so ably
pointed out by Mariette, that pyramids are only found in
cemeteries, is an answer to all such theories. Tomb-pyramids
were built by kings and others until the XIIth dynasty.
The ancient writers who have described and treated of the
pyramids are given by Pliny (Nat. Hist., xxxvi. 12, 17). If
we may believe some of the writers on them during the
Middle Ages, their outsides must have been covered with
Inscriptions , these were probably of a religious matured In
modern times they have been examined by Shaw (1721\,
