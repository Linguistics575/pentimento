unlike any of the other pyramids known to them ; it is said

to have been built by Seneferu l -CC',(iiiii]jiij, the first

king of the IVth dynasty, but there is little evidence for this
statement. The pyramid is about I I 5 feet high, and consists
of three stages : the first is 70, the second 20, and the third
about 25 feet high. The stone for this building was brought
from the Mokattam hills, but it was never finished , as in all
other pyramids, the entrance is on the north side. When
opened in modern times the sarcophagus chamber was found
empty, and it would seem that this pyramid had been
entered and rifled in ancient days.' On the north of this
pyramid are a number of mastabas in which 'royal relatives ,
of Seneferu are buried ; the most interesting of these are
those of Nefermat, one of his feudal chiefs (.iCiill', J)

style of the work are similar to those found in the mastabas
of Salrlptrah.
