DER EL-BAHARY. 405

the wall upon which the expedition to Punt is depicted all
agree in pointing to the eastern side of Africa as the.
country which the Egyptians called Punt; some of the
animals in the reliefs are identical with those found to this
day on the Abyssinian coast, and the general products of

him, and he eventually found a place which, he says, was
not improbably her tomb. In the passage between the
retaining wall of the middle platform and the enclosure he
came upon an inclined plane cut in the rock and leading to
