In the standard and wall cases are arranged a very fine
collection of figures of the gods of Egypt, and of the
animals, birds, and reptiles, sacred to them. These in-
teresting objects are made of glazed fai'ence, hard stone,
bronze, glass, etc., and among them are some splendid
specimens of excellent design and workmanship. Figures
of gods are found among the ruins of houses, and in tombs
and temples. Those found in the ruins were either placed
in shrines, and represented the gods worshipped by the
family, or were buried in niches in the walls, and were
supposed to be able to protect the family by their super-
natural influence. It is thought that the Egyptians believed
that the gods inhabited the statues placed in the temples
in their honour. Figures of gods were also buried in the
sand round about houses and tanks with the view of
guarding them from the influences of demons. The prin-
cipal gods exhibited in this room are Amen, imen-Rii,
Amsu, Anhur, Anubis, Apis, Atmu, Bast, Bes, Wipi,
Harpocrates, Hathor, Horus, Horus-beloutet, T-em-hetep
(Imouthis), Isis, Khnemu (Chnoumis), Khensu, Maat,
Mahes, Mehit, Meh-urit, Mentu, Mut, Nehebka, Nephthys,
Nit (Neith), Nefer-Atmu, Osiris, Ptah, PtalrSeker-Osiris,
Rii, Ra-Harmachis, Sebek, Set, Serqet, Shu, Ta-urt
(Thoueris), and Thoth.
