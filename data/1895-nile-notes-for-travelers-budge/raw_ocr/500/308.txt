284 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

language, and consider Thebes as the metropolis of Egypt.
Vestiges of its magnitude still exist, which extend 80 stadia
(about nine miles) in length. There are a great number
of temples, many of which Cambyses mutilated. The
spot is at present occupied by villages. One part of
it, in which is the city, lies in Arabia; another is in the
country on the other side of the river, where is the Mem-
nonium. Here are two colossal figures near one another,
each consisting of a single stone. One is entire; the upper
parts of the other, from the chair, are fallen down, the
effect, it is said, of an earthquake. It is believed that
once a day a noise as of a slight blow issues from the part
of the statue which remains in the seat and on its base.
When I was at those places with fElius Gallus, and
numerous friends and soldiers about him, I heard a noise at
the first hour (of the day), but whether proceeding from the
base or from the colossus, or produced on purpose by some
of those standing around the base, I cannot confidently assert.
For from the uncertainty of the cause, I am disposed to
believe anything rather than that stones disposed in that
manner could send forth sound. Above the Memnonium
are tombs of kings in caves, and hewn out of the stone,
about forty in number; they are executed with singular
skill, and are worthy of notice. Among the tombs are
obelisks with inscriptions, denoting the wealth of the kings
of that time, and the extent of their empire, as reaching to
the Scythians, Bactrians, Indians, and the present Ionia;
the amount of tribute also, and the number of soldiers,
which composed an army of about a million of men.
The priests there are said to be, for the most part, astro-
nomers and philosophers. The former compute the days,
not by the moon, but by the sun, introducing into the
twelve months, of thirty days each, five days every year.
But in order to complete the whole year, because there is
(annually) an excess of a part of a day, they form a period
