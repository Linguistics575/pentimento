BALLAS AND NAKADA.

During the winter of 1894-S, Prof. Petrie conducted a
series of excavations along the desert edge between Ballas
and Nakada, about 30 miles north of Thebes. He states
that, in the course of his work, he found a masitaba pyramid
similar to that of Falilshra, and a number of tombs of the
IVth, Vth, and vii, dynasties; the pyramid, and all the
tombs save one, had been plundered in ancient days. He
believes his main discovery to be that of "a fresh and
hitherto unsuspected race, who had nothing of the Egyptian
civilization." The early announcements of his discovery
stated that they were cannibals. According to Prof. Petrie,
they lived after the rule of the IVth dynasty, and before
that of the XIIth. " This new race must therefore be the
" people who overthrew the first great civilization of Egypt,
