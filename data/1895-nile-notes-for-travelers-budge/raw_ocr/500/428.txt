404 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT,

" at the fall of the VIth dynasty, and who were in turn over-
" thrown by the rise of the XIth dynasty at Thebes. As the
" Xth dynasty in Middle Egypt was contemporary with the
tt greater part of the XIth dynasty, this limits the new race to
tt the age of the VIIth to the IXth dynasties (about 3000 B.c.),
" who ruled only in Middle Egypt, and of whom no trace
" has been yet found, except a few small objects and a tomb
" at Siut. The extent to which Egypt was subdued by these
" people is indicated by their remains being found between
" Gebelen and Abydos, over rather more than a hundred
" miles of the Nile valley ...... The invaders completely
" expelled the Egyptians," Their graves were square pits,
measuring usually 6 x 4 X 5 feet. "The body was in-
" variably laid in a contracted position, with the head to the
i; south, face west, and on the left side ...... A regular
" ceremonial system is observable. ..... From the uni-
" formity of the details it is clear that a system of belief was
tt in full force." *

DAR EL-BAUARi.

The clearing of the famous Temple of Witshepset, built
at DÃ©r el-Bahari by her architect Sien-mut, has been carried
out by MM. Navilldand Hogarth for the Egypt Exploration
Fund; the work has extended over nearly three winters,
and has cost a large sum of money. This temple now
presents a striking appearance, whether seen from the
Luxor or the 1%rna side, and every visitor will much
appreciate the excellent results which have attended the
completion of this great undertaking/t Archaeologists will

Antiquities discovered in 1895, between Ballas and Nagada; London,
1895. The objects exhibited at University College are of very con-
siderable interest.

f M. Naviile calculates that in two winters only he had removed

from the Temple 60,000 cubic metres of rubbish and stones, which
were carried away to a distance of 200 yards.
