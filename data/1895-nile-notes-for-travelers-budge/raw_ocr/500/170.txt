THE TOMBS OF THE KHALIFS.*

These beautiful buildings are situated on the eastern side
of the city, and contain the tombs of the members of the
families of the Circassian Mameluke Sultans who reigned
from A.D. 1382-1517. The tomb-mosques of 1%suf, el-
Ashraf, and the tomb of el-Ghf1ri (A.D. Ie,''----) are to
the north-east of the Bab en-Nasir; the tomlrmosques of
Yttsuf and el-Ashraf are only to be seen by special per-
mission. In the tomb-mosque of Jrctrlim.c are buried that
sultan, his son the Sultan Farag (A.D. 1399--r4r2), and
various other members of the family. The limestone pulpit
and the two minarets are very beautiful specimens of stone
work. To the west of this tomh-mosque is the tomb of
Sultan Sulémén, and near that are the tombs of the Seven
W omen, the tomb-mosque of Bursbey (A.D. 1422-r438), the
Ma‘bed er-RiWi, and the tomb of the mother of Bursbey.
The most beautiful of all these tombs is the tomb-mosque
of Kait Bey (A.D. 1468--1496), which is well worthy of more
than one visit.
