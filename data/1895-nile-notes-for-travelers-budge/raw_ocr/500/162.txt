to Mar Mint was near Alexandria. The church measures
60 feet M 50 feet; it contains some interesting pictures,
and a very ancient bronze candelabrum in the shape of two
winged dragons, with seventeen sockets for lighted tapers.
On the roof of the church is a small bell in a cupola.

About half-a-mile beyond the D& ' containing the church
of St. Menas, lies the Der of Abu's Séfén, in which are
situated the churches al-'Ar.lra(the Virgin), Anba Shent1ti,
and Abu's Séfén. The last-named church was built in the
tenth century, and is dedicated to St. Mercurius, who is
called " F ather of two swords," or Abu's Séfén. The church
measures 90 feet M 50 feet, and is built chiefly of brick;
there are no pillars in it. It contains a fine ebony partition
dating from A.D. 927, some interesting pictures, an altar
casket dating from A.D. 1280, and a marble pulpit. In this
church are chapels dedicated to Saints Gabriel, John the
Baptist, James, Mar Buktor, Antony, Abba Ntilo, Michael,
and George. Within the Dér of Abu's Séfén is the "Convent
of the Maidens;" the account of Mr. Butler's discovery of
this place is told by him in his Coptic Churches ongypl,
Vol. I, p. 128. The church of the Virgin was founded
probably in the eighth century.

The church of Abu Sargah, or Abu Sergius, stands well
towards the middle of the Roman fortress of Babylon in
Egypt. Though nothing is known of the saint after whom
it was named, it is certain that in A.D. 859 Shem)ti was
elected patriarch of Abu Sargah; the church was most
probably built much earlier, and some go so far as to state
that the crypt (20 feet x 15 feet) was occupied by the
Virgin and her Son when they fled to Egypt to avoid the
wrath of Herod. "The general shape of the church is, or
was, a nearly regular oblong, and its general structure is
basiliean. It consists of narthex, nave, north and south
