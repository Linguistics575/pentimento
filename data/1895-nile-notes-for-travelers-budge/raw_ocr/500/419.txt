RECENT EXCAVATIONS IN EGYPT.

During the past year the work of excavating sites in
Egypt has been carried on with unprecedented activity, and
the net result has been a very considerable addition to our
knowledge of ancient Egypt. Under the able direction of
M. J. de Morgan, his staff have succeeded in clearing out
large portions of the temples of Thebes on both sides of
the river, and his own splendid discoveries have given to the
Gizeh Museum a marvellous collection of XIIth dynasty
jewellery. M. Naville has finished the clearing of 1:Istsshep-
set's temple at Der el-BaharA1 on behalf of the Egypt
Exploration Fund; Messrs. Botti and Hogarth have done
important work at Alexandria , Prof. Petrie has dug through
some two thousand graves containing the remains of what
he believes to be a new race; M. Daressy and his colleagues
have unearthed many important objects in the ruins of the
Temples of Luxor and Medinet-Habu; Miss Benson
discovered a statue of the scribe Amenemlast in the Temple
of Mut; and some excavations conducted by natives have
resulted in the finding of that wonderful phalanx of wooden
soldiers now exhibited in the Gizeh Museum. At the
Museum Brugsch Bey has continued his work of arranging
the antiquities acquired by recent excavations, and the
promptness with which new "finds " are exhibited merits
great praise.

The chief offocial publications of the Gizeh Museum in
r894--S, are _
