At the beginning of the Greek rule over Egypt, the
knowledge of the use of the ancient Egyptian language
began to decline, and the language of Greece began to
modify and eventually to supersede that of Egypt. When
we consider that Ptolemy I. Soter, succeeded in attracting
to Alexandria a large number of the greatest Greek scholars
of the day, such as Euclid the mathematician, Stilpo of
Megara, Theodorus of Cyrene and Diodorus Cronus, the
philosophers, Zenodotus the grammarian, Philetas the
poet from Cos, and many others, this is not to be wondered
at. The founding of the great Alexandrian Library and
Museum, and the endowment of these institutions for the
support of a number of the most eminent Greek philo-
sophers and scholars, was an act of far-sighted policy on
the part of Ptolemy 1., whose aim was to make the learning
and language of the Greeks to become dominant in Egypt.
Little by little the principal posts in the Government were
monopolised by the Greeks, and little by little the Egyptians
became servants and slaves to their intellectually superior
masters. In respect to their language, " the Egyptians
were not prohibited from making use, so far as it seemed
requisite according to ritual or otherwise appropriate, of the
native language and of its time-hallowed written signs; in this
old home, moreover, of the use of writing in ordinary inter-
course the native language, alone familiar to the great public,
and the usual writing must necessarily have been allowed not
merely in the case of private contracts, but even as regards
tax-receipts and similar documents. But this was a conces-
