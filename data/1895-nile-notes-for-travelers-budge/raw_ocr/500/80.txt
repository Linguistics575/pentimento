proved that he was right. The other early workers in the
field of hieroglyphics were Dr. Samuel Birch in England;
Dr. Lepsius in Germany, and MM. Rosellini and Salvolini
in Italy. The study of hieroglyphics has become compara-
tively general, and each year sees books of texts published,
learned papers on Egyptian grammar written, and transla-
tions made into the various European languages.

In hieroglyphic inscriptions the signs are used in two
ways: I, IDEOGRAPHIC, II, PHONETIC. In the ideographic
system a word is expressed by a picture or ideograth thus :

The scribes took pains to represent the exact value of

made.

The II)EOGRAPHIC signs are also used as determinatives,
and are placed after words written phonetically to de-
termine their meaning. For example, new means 'to
sleep,' 'to walk,' 'to go back,' 'to become infirm,' 'tongue'
