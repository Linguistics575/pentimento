able example cf early work, probably before the IVth
dynasty. From Salil.ctrah.

2. Panels of wood for inlaying upon the false doors of the
tomb of Hesi-Ri; they are splendid examples of the
delicate and accurate work executed by Egyptian carvers
in wood during the IVth dynasty. From Sal.rl.clrah.

962. Round, white alabaster table of offerings made for
Khu-hetep-heres, prophet of the goddess Meat of
Nekhen. Vth dynasty. From Sakkarah.

3. Layer of clay and plaster painted in water colours,
with a scene in which geese are represented walking
along. The artist has depicted the birds with great
fidelity to nature, and was evidently a very accomplished
draughtsman. This fragile object was brought from a
ruined mastaba at Mtclt)m by M. Vassali, and dates
probably from the IVth dynasty.

4, 5. Two libation tables found in a tomb near the Step
Pyramid (see page 241) of Salsls2rah. A slab, resting
on the backs of a pair of lions, has a trench cut in it for
carrying off the liquid into a bowl, which stands between
the tails of the two lions.

IVth dynasty. From Sakkarah.

6. Double statue of Ri-hetep and his wife Nefert, "a
royal connexion," found in a mastaba near the Pyramid of
Metdt"1m, which is generally thought to have been built by
Seneferu the first king of the IVth dynasty. The eyes
are filled with quartz or rock crystal. Mariette placed the
period when this statue was made in the IIIrd dynasty,
but Maspero thinks that it belongs to the XIIth dynasty.
