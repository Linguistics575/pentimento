WHITE AND RED MONASTERIES. 265

The Der el-Abyad or "White Monastery," so-called
because of the colour of the stone of which it is built, but
better known by the name of Amba Shem1dah, is situated
on the west bank of the river near Sihili, 3rrl- miles from
Cairo. "The peculiarity of this monastery is that the in-

they are crowned with a deep overhanging cornice. The
building is of an oblong shape, about 200 feet in length by

feet by I 33 feet. The convent was dedicated to Shenf1ti,
a celebrated Coptic saint who lived in the fourth century
of our era. * Curzon says (of. cit., p. 132)...... "The
tall granite columns of the ancient church reared themselves
like an avenue on either side of the desecrated nave, which
is now open to the sky, and is used as a promenade for a
host of chickens......... The principal entrance was
formerly at the west end, where there is a small vestibule,
immediately within the door of which, on the left hand, is

died at midday on July 2, A.D. 451.
