334 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

of the well are lines, which indicate the complete rise of
the river, and other degrees of its rising. Those who
examine these marks communicate the result to the public
for their information. For it is known long before, by these
marks, and by the time elapsed from the commencement,
what the future rise of the river will be, and notice is given
of it. This information is of service to the husbandmen
with reference to the distribution of the water, for the pur

A mile or so to the north of the convent stands the bold
hill in the sides of which are hewn the tombs which General
Sir F. W. Grenfell, G.C.B., excavated, this hill is situated in
Western Aswan, the COTAH "HELLER?" of the C0pts,
and is the Contra Syene of the classical authors. The tombs
are hewn out of the rock, tier above tier, and the most im-
portant of these were reached by a stone staircase, which to
this day remains nearly complete, and is one of the most
interesting antiquities in Egypt. The tombs in this hill may
be roughly divided into three groups. The first group was
hewn in the best and thickest layer of stone in the top of
