SUEZ AND THE SUEZ CANAL. 127

canal from Suez to Pelusium, but it was afterwards modified,
and by bringing the northern end into the Mediterranean
at Port Sa'id, it was found possible to do away with the
lock at each end, which would have been necessary had it
embouched at Pelusium. The fresh-water canal from
Bt1lstl.r to Suez, with an aqueduct to Port Sa'ld, included in
the original plan, was completed in 1863. The filling of
the Bitter Lakes with sea-water from the Mediterranean
was begun on the 18th March, 1869, and the whole canal
was opened for traffic on N ovember 16th of the same year.
The cost of the canal was about £ 19,000,000.

The buoyed channel which leads into the canal at the
Suez end is 300 yards across in the widest part. The
average width of the dredged channel is about 90 feet, and
the average depth about 28 feet. At Shalt1f et-Terrabeh the
excavation was very difficult, for the ground rises about
twenty feet above the sea-level, and the elevation is five or
six miles long. A thick layer of hard rock'cropped' up in
the line of the canal, and the work of removing it was of
no slight nature. On a mound not quite half-way between
Suez and Shahlf are some granite blocks bearing traces of
cuneiform and hieroglyphic inscriptions recording the name
of Darius. They appear to be the remains of one of a
series of buildings erected along the line of the old canal
which was restored and probably completed by Darius.
At ShahU the width of the canal is about 90 feet, and
shortly after leaving this place the canal enters the Small
Bitter Lake, which is about seven miles long. Before
reaching the end of it is, on the left, another mound on
which were found the ruins of a building which was exca-
vated by M. de Lesseps. Granite slabs were found there
inscribed with the name of Darius in Persian cuneiform
characters and in hieroglyphics. The canal next passes
through the Great Bitter Lake (about fifteen miles long)
and a tes/kilometres farther along it passes through the
