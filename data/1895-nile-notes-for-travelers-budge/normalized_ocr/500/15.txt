PREFACE TO THE FOURTH
EDITION.

The short descriptions of the principal Egyptian
monuments on each side of the Nile between Cairo
and the Second Cataract (Widi Halfah), printed in
the following pages, are not in any way intended
to form a "Guide to Egypt": they are drawn up
for the use of those travellers who have a very few
weeks to spend in Egypt, and who wish to carry
in their memories some of the more important facts
connected with the fast-perishing remains of one_of
the most interesting and ancient civilizations that
has been developed on the face of the earth, The
existing guide books are generally too voluminous
and diffuse for such travellers; and are, moreover,
in many respects inaccurate. Experience has shown
that the greater number of travellers in that country
are more interested in history and matters connected
with Egyptian civilization from B.C. 4400 to B.C. 450,
than with Egypt under the rule of the Assyrians
