TANIS. 135

Under the Roman Empire Tanis still held a high
position among the towns of the Delta, and the Egyptians
considered it of sufficient importance to make it an epis-
copal see. In the list of the bishops who were present at
the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451), the name of Apol-
. lonius, Bishop of Tanis, is found. Tanis must not be con-
founded with Tennis, the sea-port town which grew and
increased in importance as Tanis declined; and it is difficult
to understand why Tanis should have dwindled away,
considering that Arab writers have described its climate as
being most salubrious, and its winter like summer. W ater
was said to flow there at all times, and the inhabitants could
water their gardens at their will; no place in all Egypt, save
the Fayytlm, could be compared with it for fertility, and for
the beauty of its gardens and vines. In the sixth century
of our era the sea invaded a large portion of Tanis territory,
and it went on encroaching each year little by little, until all
its villages were submerged. The inhabitants removed their
dead to Tennis, and established themselves there; Tennis
was evacuated by its inhabitants A.D. 1192, and the town
itself was destroyed A.D. 1226.
