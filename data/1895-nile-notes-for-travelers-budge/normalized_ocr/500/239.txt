bodies of their ancestors in splendid chambers, and that
they had the opportunity of contemplating the faces of those
who died before their time. In some particulars he is right,
and in others wrong. He lived too late (about B.C. 40) to
know what the well-made Theban mummies were like, and
his experience therefore would only have familiarised him
with the Egypto-Roman mummies, in which the limbs were
bandaged separately, and the contour of their faces, much
blunted, was to be seen through the thin and tightly drawn
bandages which covered the face. In such examples the
features of the face can be clearly distinguished underneath
the bandages.

An examination of Egyptian mummies will show that
the accounts given by Herodotus and Diodorus are generally
correct, for mummies with and without ventral incisions are
found, and some are preserved by means of balsams and
gums, and others by bitumen and natron. The skulls of
mummies which may be seen by hundreds in caves and pits
at Thebes contain absolutely nothing, a fact which proves
that the embalmers were able not only to remove the brain,
but also to take out the membranes without injuring or
breaking the nose in any way. The heads of mummies are
found, at times, to be filled with bitumen, linen rags, or
resin. The bodies which have been filled with resin or
some such substance are of a greenish colour, and the skin
has the appearance of being tanned. Such mummies, when
unrolled, perish rapidly and break easily. Usually, how-
ever, the resin and aromatic gum process is favourable to
the preservation of the teeth and hair. Bodies from which
the intestines have been removed and which have been
preserved by being filled with bitumen, are quite black and
hard. The features are preserved intact, but the body is
heavy and unfair to look upon. The bitumen penetrates the
bones so completely that it is sometimes difficult to dis-.
tinguish what is bone and what is bitumen. The arms,
