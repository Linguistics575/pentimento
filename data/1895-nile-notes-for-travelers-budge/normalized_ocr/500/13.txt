INTRODUCTION.



Having for some years felt the insufficiency of
the information given by Dragomans to travellers
on the Nile, and finding with one or two striking
exceptions how limited is their knowledge of facts
relating to the history of the antiquities in Upper
Egypt, Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son have arranged
with Dr. E, A. Wallis Budge to compile the following
pages, which they have much pleasure in presenting
to every passenger under their Nile arrangements on
their Tourist Steamers and Dhahabiyyehs. In this
way passengers will no longer be liable to be misled
(unintentionally) by Dragomans, but will be able at
their leisure to prepare themselves for what they
have to see, and thus by an agreeable study add
to the interest with which their visits to the various

places are made.
