offerings to N ekht of birds, flowers, etc. In the lower

fruit, etc.

In the other scenes we have Nekht, accompanied by his
wife Taui, making an offering of (film unguent and incense

The most ancient necropolis at Thebes is Drah abu'l
Neliliah, where tombs of the XIth, XVIIth, and XVIIIth
dynasties are to be found. The coffins of the Antef kings
(XIth dynasty), now in the Louvre and the British Museum,
were discovered here, and here was made the marvellous
"find" of the jewellery of Arurheteppr wife of Kames, a king
of the XVIIth dynasty, about B.C. I 750. A little more to the
south is the necropolis of Asasif, where during the XIXth,
XXIInd, and XXVIth dynasties many beautiful tombs
were constructed. If the visitor has time, an attempt should
be made to see the fine tomb of Pe.tii-Amen-ipt.

during the reign of the last Cleopatra (B.c. 51-29). The
stone-lined tank which lies near this building was probably
used as a Nilometer.
