to take possession of and bring to Cairo the antiquities
which were to be revealed to the world by'Abd er-Rall

Tuamautef and Qeblysennuf. The name tt Canopic "is given to them
by those who follow the opinion of some ancient writers that Canopus,
the pilot of Menelaus, who is said to have been buried at Canopus
in Egypt, was worshipped there under the form of a jar with small
(bet, a thin neck, a swollen body, and a round back.
