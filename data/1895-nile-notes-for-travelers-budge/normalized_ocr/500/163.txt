CAIRO. I 39

aisle, choir, and three altars eastward each in its own
chapel: of these the central and southern chapels are
apsidal, the northern is square ended...... Over the
aisles and narthex runs a continuous gallery or triforium,
which originally served as the place for women at the
service. On the north side it stops short at the choir
forming a kind of transept, which, however, does not project
beyond the north aisle...... On the south side of
the church the triforium is prolonged over the choir and over
the south side-chapel. The gallery is flat-roofed while
the nave is covered with a pointed roof with framed princi-
pals like that at Abu's Séfén...... Outside, the roof
of Abu Sargah is plastered over with cement showing
the king-posts projecting above the ridge-piece. Over the
central part of the choir and over the haikal the roof
changes to a wagon-vaulting; it is flat over the north
transept, and a lofty dome overshadows the north aisle
chapel...... The twelve monolithic columns round
the nave are all, with one exception, of white marble
streaked with dusky lines...... The exceptional column
is of red Assuhn granite, 22 inches in diameter......
The wooden pulpit...... is of rosewood inlaid with
designs in ebony set with ivory edgings...... The
haikal-screen projects forward into the choir as at Al
'Adra...... and is of very ancient and beautifulworkman-
ship; pentagons and other shapes of solid ivory, carved
in relief with arabesques, being inlaid and set round
with rich mouldings...... The upper part of the screen
contains square panels of ebony set with large crosses of
solid ivory, most exquisitely chiselled with scrollwork, and
panels of ebony carved through in work of the most delicate
and skilful finish." (Butler, Coptic Churches, Vol. I., pp. 183--
190, ff.) The early carvings representing St. Demetrius,
'Mér George, Abu's Séfén, the Nativity, and the Last Supper,
are worthy of careful examination.
