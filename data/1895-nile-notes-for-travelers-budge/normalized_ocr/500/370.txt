346 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

Ka-hefouiu; it stands immediately on the Tropic ot
Cancer. The god of this town was called Cggins'l Stags
Merul or Melul, the Mandulis or Malulis of the Greeks.
At Kalébshi there are the ruins of two temples of consider-
able interest. The larger of these, which is one of the largest
temples in Nubia, appears to have been built upon the site
of an ancient Egyptian temple founded by Thothmes IH.,
B.C. 1600, and Amenophis II., B.C. 1566, for on the pronaos

At Bét el-Wali, a short distance from the larger temple,

it is evident that in those early times Talmis was the great
central market to which the products and wares of the
Stldiin were brought for sale and barter. The sculptures
are executed with great freedom and spirit, and when the
