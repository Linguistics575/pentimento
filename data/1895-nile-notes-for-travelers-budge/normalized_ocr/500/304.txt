tecture than to Coptic. The principal church shows two
other features which do not occur elsewhere in the Christian
buildings of Egypt, namely, an external atrium surrounded
with a Cloister, and a central tower with a clerestory.....
Possibly the same remark may apply to the structure of the
iconostasis, which has two' side-doors and no central
entrance, though this arrangement is not quite unparalleled
in the churches of Upper Egypt, and may be a later altera-
tion. It will be. noticed that the church has a triple
western entrance from the cloisters." (Butler, Ancient Coptic
