French in 1798--r8or it was said to be 2,500,000; Sir
Gardner Wilkinson, however, set it down at as low a figure
as 1,500,000. In 1821 the population numbered 2,514,000,
and in 1846 it had risen to 4,456,186. The last census was
ordered by Khedivial decree on December 2, 1881, and it
was completed on May 3, 1882. According to the official
statement published in the Recensement Gtntral de Z'Egypte,
at Cairo, in 1884, it amounted in 1882 to 6,806,381 persons,
of whom 3,216,847 were men, and 3,252,869 were women.
Of the 6,806,381 persons, 6,708,185 were inhabitants of the
country, and 98,196 were nomads. It showed that there
were in the total 245,779 Bedawin and 90,886 foreigners;
the number was made up in the following manner H--

Cairo, 374,838; Alexandria, 231,396; Damietta, 43,616;
Rosetta, 19,378; Port Sa'ld, 21,296, and Suez, 11,175. Of
