ALEXANDRIA. I 2 3

The Catacombs, which were built early in the fourth
century of our era, are on the coast near the harbour and
on the coast near the new port.

The Walls of the city were built by Muhammad'Ali,
and appear to have been laid upon the foundation ofancient
walls.

On the south side of Alexandria lies Lake Mareotis,
which in ancient days was fed by canals running from the
Nile. During the middle ages the lake nearly dried up, and
the land which became available for building purposes in
consequence was speedily covered with villages. In the
year 1801, the English dug a canal across the neck of land
between the lake and the sea, and flooded the whole district
thus occupied. During the last few years an attempt has
been made to pump the water out, it would seem with con-
siderable success.

towns'c---
