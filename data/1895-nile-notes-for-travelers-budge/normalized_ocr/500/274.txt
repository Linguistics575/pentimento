250 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

THE PYRAMIDS OF DAHSHI'JR.

These pyramids, four of stone and two of brick, lie about
three and a half miles to the south of the Mastabat el-Far'tm,
or Pyramid of Unas. The largest stone pyramid is about
326 feet high, and the length of each side at the base is about
700 feet; beneath it are three subterranean chambers.
The second stone pyramid is about 321 feet high, and the
length of its sides at the base is 620 feet; it is usually
called the "Blunted Pyramid," because the lowest parts of
its sides are built at one angle, and the completing parts at
another. The larger of the two brick pyramids is about 90
feet high, and the length of the sides at the base is about
350 feet; the smaller is about 156 feet high, and the length
of its sides at the base is about 34 3 feet. The brick
pyramids have recently been excavated by M. de Morgan

(see p. 395 ff.)
THE QUARRIES OF MA'S.SARA AND TURRA.

These quarries have supplied excellent stone for building
purposes for six thousand years at least. During the
Ancient Empire the architects of the pyramids made their
quarrymen tunnel into the mountains for hundreds of yards
until they found a bed of stone suitable for their work, and
traces of their excavations are plainly visible to-day. The
Egyptians called the Turra quarry "ai"' /ats w
Re-ful, or Ta-re-au, from which the Arabic name Turra
is probably derived. An inscription in one of the chambers
tells us that during the reign of Amenophis III. a new part
of the quarry was opened. Uni, an officer who lived in
the reign of Pepi I., was sent to Turra by this king to bring
back a white limestone sarcophagus with its cover, libation
stone, ctc., etc.

THE PYRAMID OF' Miaotru.
This pyramid, called by the Arabs E! Haram el-Kaddab,
or "the False Pyramid," is probably so named because it is
