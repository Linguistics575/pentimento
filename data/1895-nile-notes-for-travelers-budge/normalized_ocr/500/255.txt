THE PYRAMIDS OF GiZEH. 231

god, thou shalt nevermore have enemies, 0 king of the
North and South, Men-kau-Ra, living for ever." This
formula is one which is found upon cof% s down to the
latest period, but as the date of Mycerinus is known, it is
possible to draw some interesting and valuable conclusions
from the fact that it is found upon his coffin. It proves
that as far back as 3,600 years before Christ the Egyptian
religion was established on a firm base, that the doctrine of
immortality was already deeply rooted in the human mind.
The art of preserving the human body by embalming was
also well understood and generally practised at that early
date.

The pyramid of Men-kau-Ra, like that of Chephren, is
built upon a rock with a sloping surface, the inequality of
the surface in this case has been made level by build..
ing up courses of large blocks of stones. Around the
lower part the remains of the old granite covering are
visible to a depth of from 30 to 40 feet. It is unfortunate
that this pyramid has been so much damaged; its injuries,
however, enable the visitor to see exactly how it was built,
and it may be concluded that the pyramids of Cheops and
Chephren were built in the same manner. The length of
each side at the base is about 350 feet, and its height is
variously given as 210 and 215 feet. The entrance is on
the north side, about thirteen feet above the ground, and a
descending corridor about 104 feet long, passing through an
ante-chamber, having a series of three granite doors, leads
into one chamber about 40 feet long, and a second chanr.
ber about 44 long. In this last chamber is a shaft
which leads down to the granite-lined chamber about
twenty feet below, in which were found the sarcophagus and
wooden coffin of Mycerinus, and the remains of a human
body. It is thought that, in spite of the body of Mycer-
inus being buried in this pyramid, it was left unfinished
at the death of this king, and that a succeeding ruler of
