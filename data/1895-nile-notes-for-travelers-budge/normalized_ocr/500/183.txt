monasteries, for the Patriarch had insisted that they should
be carefully guarded from strangers. Profiting by the
delays caused by the Patriarch's orders, he began to visit
the sites of ancient Egyptian buildings in the neighbourhood
of Cairo. While at Sakkarah one day he discovered by
accident a Sphinx, on which were inscribed the names of
Ansar-Hapi or Osiris-Apis (Serapis), Similar to one he had
seen at Cairo. He remembered that the Serapeum at Mem-
phis was described by ancient authors as standing on a sandy
plain,' and he believed that he had really found the spot
where it stood and its ruins. Neglecting the original object
of his expedition, he collected workmen, and in 1850 set to
work to dig; two months' work revealed one hundred and forty
sphinxes, two chapels, a semi-circular space ornamented
w1th Greek statues, etc. Through the jealousy of certain
people who united the profession of politics with wholesale
trading in antiquities, the Egyptian Government of the day
issued an order to suspend the excavations, and the work
was stopped. Soon after, however, the French National
Assembly voted 30,000 francs for excavation purposes, and
towards the end of the year Mariette was enabled to enter
the Serapeum, where he found sixty-four Apis bulls, stelae,
etc, As the dates when the bulls were placed in the
Serapeum are stated, they afford a valuable help in fixing
the chronology of Egypt as far back as the XVIIIth dynasty.
The year 1852 was spent in clearing out the Serapeum, and
early in 1853 he came to the Pyramids of Gizeh, where he
carried on excavations for the Due de Luynes; in the latter
year he discovered a granite temple near Gizeh. About
this time he was appointed Assistant-Curator at the Louvre.

In 1854,'Abbhs Pasha, who had suspended Mariette's
excavations two or three years before, died; he was sue-
ceeded by Sa'id Pasha, who at once conferred the honour
