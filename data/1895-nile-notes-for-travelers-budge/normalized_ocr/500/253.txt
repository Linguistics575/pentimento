THE PYRAMIDS OF' GiZEH. 229

which was found near the temple, close by this pyramid,
confirms the statements of Herodotus and Diodorus
Siculus, that Chephren built it. A statue of this king, now
in the Gizeh Museum, was found in the granite temple
close by. This pyramid appears to be larger than the
Great Pyramid because it stands upon a higher level of
stone foundation; it was cased with stone originally and
polished, but the greater part of the outer casing has
disappeared. An ascent of this pyramid can only be made
with difficulty. It was first explored in 1816 by Belzoni
(born 1778, died 1823), the discoverer of the tomb of
Seti I. and of the temple of Rameses II. at Abu Simbel.
In the north side of the pyramid are two openings, one at
the base and one about So feet above it. The upper
opening led into a corridor 105 feet long, which descends
into a chamber 461 x 16% - x 22% feet, which held the
granite sarcophagus in which Chephren was buried. The
lower opening leads into a corridor about 100 feet long,
which, first descending and then ascending, ends in the
chamber mentioned above, which is usually called 13elzoni's
Chamber. The actual height is about 450 feet, and the
length of each side at the base about foo feet. The rock
upon which the pyramid stands has been scarped on the
north and west sides to make the foundation level. The
history of the building of the pyramid is thus stated by
Herodotus': "The Egyptians say that this Cheops reigned
fifty years, and when he died, his brother Chephren suc-
ceeded to the kingdom; and he followed the same practices
as the other, both in other respects, and in building a pyramid;
which does not come up to the dimensions of his brother's,
for I myself measured them; nor has it subterraneous
chambers, nor does a channel from the Nile flow to it, as
to the other, but this flows through an artificial aqueduct
round an island within, in which they say the body of
