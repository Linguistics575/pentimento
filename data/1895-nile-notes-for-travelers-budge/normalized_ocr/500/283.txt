the reign of (rec; -, 2irriri'ir-r-lj.') 1iifilf (fe??, , ] gag?' "Nub-

kau- Ra, son of the sun, Amenennrru," the third king of
the XIIth dynasty. Of thehistory of this Egyptian gentleman
the following facts are known. During one of the expeditions
which Amenemhat I. made through Egypt, he raised to the
rank of a feudal lord and "governor of the hilly land on the
east of the nom e of Meb, "or Antino√©, the maternal grand-
father of Chnemu-fJetep. In the reign of Usertsen I., the
son of Amenembiit I., the title of nobility conferred upon this
man in the preceding reign was confirmed, and a large tract of
land, lying between the N ile and the Libyan mountains, was
added to his estates; higher titles were also bestowed upon
him in addition to those which he already possessed. The
lands on the east side of the river, together with all his
titles, passed into the hands of his eldest son Necht. Necht

the son of Sebek-iinch, and bore to him an only son called
