too, smashed in pieces, lay on the ground close by. A
small rose granite box, containing alabaster jars, was also

which is called Apis, has the following marks: it is black,
and has a square spot of white on the forehead, and on the

and on the tongue a beetle." Above each tomb of an Apis
bull was builta chapel, and it was the series of chapels which
formed the Serapeum properly so called, it was surrounded
by walls like the other Egyptian temples, and it had pylons
to which an avenue of Sphinxes led. This remarkable
place was excavated in 18 So by M. Mariette, who having
seen in various parts of Egypt sphinxes upon which were
