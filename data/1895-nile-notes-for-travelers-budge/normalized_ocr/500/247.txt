It appears that before the actual building of a pyramid was
begun a suitable rocky site was chosen and cleared, a mass
of rock if possible being left in the middle of the area to
form the core of the building. The chambers and the
galleries leading to them were next planned and excavated.
Around the core a truncated pyramid building was made,
the angles of which were filled up with blocks of stone.
Layer after layer of stone was then built around the work,
which grew larger and larger until it was finished. Dr.
Lepsius thought that when a king ascended the throne, he
built for himself a small but complete tomb-pyramid, and
that a fresh coating of stone was built around it every year
that he reigned, and that when he died the sides of the
pyramids were like long flights of steps, which his successor
filled up with right-angled triangular blocks of stone. The
door of the pyramid was walled up after the body of its
builder had been laid in it, and thus remained a finished
tomb. The explanation of Dr. Lepsius may not be correct,
but at least it answers satisfactorily more objections than do
the views of other theorists on this matter. It has been
pointed out that near the core of the pyramid the work is
more carefully executed than near the exterior, that is to
say, as the time for the king's death approached the work
was more hurriedly performed.

During the investigations made by Lepsius in and about
the pyramid area, he found the remains of about seventy-
five pyramids, and noticed that they were always built in
groups.
