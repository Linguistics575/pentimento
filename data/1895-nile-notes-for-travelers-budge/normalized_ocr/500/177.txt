THE, EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH. 153

ment, however, a policy was inaugurated which is difficult
either to understand or describe. The influx of objects
during Maspero's reign at J3f) liil.r was great-so great that
it would have been impossible for him to incorporate them
all, even if he had had the necessary space; we now know
that many of them were exceedingly fine, yet after his
departure no attempt was made to exhibit them. This
might, in many cases, have been done easily, for poor
specimens could have been relegated to the "magazine,"
and fine ones exhibited in their stead.

With the increase of accommodation for tourists and of
facilities for travelling after the occupation of Egypt by the
British, public opinion grew and waxed strong, and the
advisers of the late Khedive found it necessary to consider
the task of the removal of the Egyptian antiquities from
Jh1ktl.c to a safer and larger resting-place. The Egyptian
Government had no funds at their disposal with which to
build a new Museum, and after much discussion it was
decided to transfer the antiquities to the large palace at
Gizeh, which is said to have cost five millions sterling.
The usual irresponsible opposition to the scheme was
offered by those who should have known better, but there
seems to be little doubt that this decision was the best that
could have been arrived at under the circumstances in
which the Egyptian Government was placed. The fabric
of the Gizeh palace seems to be flimsy, and the appearance
of the building is not that which those who are acquainted
with European museums are accustomed to associate with
Egyptian antiquities; it is, nevertheless, a large building,
and the fact that it would cost nothing must have been a
great inducement to transform the palace into a museum
Much was said at first about danger to the antiquities from
fire, but it is quite certain that the danger from fire at Jrdhil.r
was greater than it is at Gizeh. Some excellent alterations
in the building and arrangements to prevent fire were made
