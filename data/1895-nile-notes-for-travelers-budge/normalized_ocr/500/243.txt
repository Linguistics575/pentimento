THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GlZEH. 219

and of the race to which he belonged, has been vindicated
by examinations of the skulls of Egyptian mummies.

If the pure ancient Egyptian, as found in mummies and
represented in paintings upon the tombs, be compared with
the negro, we shall find that they are absolutely unlike in
every important particular. The negro is prognathous, but
the Egyptian is orthognathous; the bony structure of the
negro is heavier and stronger than that of the Egyptian; the
hair of the negro is crisp and woolly, while that of the
Egyptian is smooth and fine.

It must be pointed out clearly that the Egyptians took
trouble to preserve the bodies of the dead because they
believed that after a series of terrible combats in the under-
world, the soul, triumphant and pure, would once more
return to the clay in which it had formerly lived. It was
necessary, then, to preserve the body that it might be ready
for the return of the soul. It was also necessary to build
large and beautiful tombs, in order that the triumphant soul,
having revivified its ancient house of clay, might have a fit
and proper abode in which to dwell. The pyramid tombs
built by the kings of the earlier dynasties, and the vast
many-chambered sepulchres hewn in the sides of the Theban
hills during the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties, were not, in
my opinion, built to gratify the pride of their owners. They
are the outcome of the belief that the soul would revivify
the body, and they are the result of a firm assurance in the
mind of the ancient Egyptians of the truth of the doctrine
of immortality, which is the foundation of the Egyptian
religion, and which was as deeply rooted in them as the
hills are in the earth.
