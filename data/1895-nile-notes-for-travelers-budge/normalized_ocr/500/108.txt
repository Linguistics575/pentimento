reads: "O Lord of Amenta (the underworld), I am in thy
presence. There is no sin in my body, I have uttered no
lie wilfully, and I have done nothing with a double motive.
Grant that I may be like unto those favoured beings who
[ stand ] about thee, and that I may be an Osiris greatly
favoured of the beautiful god and beloved of the lord of
the world-l who am in truth a royal scribe loving him,
Ani, victorious in judgment before the god Osiris."

To Osiris Horus says'.---- "I have come to thee,
O Unnefer, and I have brought the Osiris Ani to thee,
His heart is righteous coming forth from the balance, and
it hath not committed sin against any god or any goddess.
Thoth hath weighed it according to the directions spoken
to him by the cycle of the gods; and it is very true and
righteous. Grant unto him offerings of meat and drink,
permit him to enter into the presence of Osiris, and grant
that he may be like unto the followers of Horus for ever."
