216 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

legs, hands, and feet of such mummies break with a sound
like the cracking of chemical glass tubing; they burn freely.
Speaking generally, they will last for ever.

When a mummy has been preserved by natron, that is,
a mixture of carbonate, sulphate, and muriate of soda, the
skin is found to be very hard, and it hangs loosely from the
bones in much the same way as it hangs from the skeletons
of the dead monks preserved in the crypt beneath the
Capuchin convent at Floriana in Malta. The hair of such
mummies usually falls off when touched.

When the friends of a dead Egyptian were too poor to
pay for the best method of embalmment, the body could be
preserved by two very cheap methods; one method was to
soak it in salt and hot bitumen, and the other in salt only.
In the salt and bitumen process every cavity of the body was
filled with bitumen, and the hair disappeared. Clearly it is
to the bodies which were preserved in this way that the
name "mummy," or bitumen, was first applied.

The salted and dried body is easily distinguishable.
The skin is like paper, the features and hair have disap-
peared, and the bones are very brittle and white.

The art of mummifying arrived at the highest pitch of
perfection at Thebes. The mummies of the first six
dynasties drop to pieces on exposure to the air, and smell
slightly of bitumen; those of the XIth dynasty are of a
yellowish colour and very brittle; those of the XIIth
dynasty are black. The method of embalming varied at
different periods and places. From the XVIIIth to the
XXIst dynasties the Memphis mummies are black, while
those made at Thebes during the same period are yellowish
in colour, and have the nails of the hands and feet dyed
yellow with the juice of the henna plant. After the
XXVIth dynasty the mummies made at both places are
quite black and shapeless; they are also very heavy and
tough, and can only be broken with difficulty.
