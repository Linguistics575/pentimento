49. Limestone slab from the tomb of Uni, a high
official who served under the kings Teti, Pepi I. and
Mer-en-RE, of the VIth dynasty, about B.C. 33oo-3233.
Unit was a man of humble birth, and began life in the
royal service as a "crown bearer"; he was next made
overseer of the workmen, and was soon after sent to
Turrah to bring back a block of stone for the sarcophagus
of the king. He was then made governor of the troops,
and was set at the head of an expedition against the
Aamu and the Herusha. On five different occasions did
Una wage war successfully against Egypt's foes, and
having wasted their countries with fire and sword, he
returned to Memphis crowned with glory. The inscrip-
tion is of the greatest importance for the history of the
period, and is interesting as showing that a man of very
humble birth could attain to the highest dignities at the
Lgyptian court. From Abydos
