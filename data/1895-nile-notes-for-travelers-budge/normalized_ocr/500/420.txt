DAHSHUR.

The brick pyramids of Dahshilr, commonly called the
tt black pyramids," lie on the edge of the sandy plain which

north of the village of Dahsht1r, facing the hamlet of
Menshiyyeh, and the other, some miles distant from the

sarcophagus and statue of Menthu-nesu, and in another was
the sarcophagus of N efert-hent; it was quite clear that
these tombs had been wrecked in ancient days, and there-
fore to the pit by which they were reached M. de Morgan
gave the name, tt Pit of the spoilers." Along the principal
gallery were four tombs, and in the second of these a queen
had been buried; on the lower stage eight sarcophagi were
found, but only two were inscribed. Subsequently it was
found that the burial place of a series of princesses had
been found, and in consequence M. de Morgan called the
place tt Gallery of Princesses." In one of the tombs (No. 3)
