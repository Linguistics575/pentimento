Editl, s1rl-milesfrom Cairo, on the west bank of the
river, was called in Egyptian 2g=ig'fl Behutet, and in
Coptic afrra,; it was called by the Greeks Apollino-
polis Magna, where the crocodile and its worshippers were
detested. The Temple of Edit, for which alone both
the ancient and modern towns were famous, occupied 180
years three months and fourteen days in building, that is to
say it was begun during the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes I.,
B.C. 237, and finished B.C. 57. It resembles that of
Denderah in many respects, but its complete condition
marks it out as one of the most remarkable buildings in
Egypt, and its splendid towers, about 112 feet high, make
its general magnificence very striking. The space enclosed
by the walls measures 450 X 120 feet; the front of the
propylon from side to side measures about 252 feet. Pass-
ing through the door the visitor enters a court, around three
sides of which runs a gallery supported on thirty-two pillars,
The first and second halls, A, B, have eighteen and twelve
pillars respectively; passing through chambers C and D, the
shrine E is reached, where stood a granite naos in which a
figure of Horus, to whom the temple is dedicated, was pre-
saved. This naos was made by Nectanebus I., a king of
the XXXth dynasty, B.C. 378.

The pylons are covered with battle scenes, and the walls
are inscribed with the names and sizes of the various cham-
bers in the building, lists of names of places, etc.; the name
of the architect, 1-em-lysT, or Imouthis, has also been
inscribed. From the south side of the pylons, and from a
small chamber on each side of the chamber C, staircases
ascended to the roof.

The credit of clearing out the temple of Edit belongs to
M. Mariette. Little more than twenty-five years ago the
