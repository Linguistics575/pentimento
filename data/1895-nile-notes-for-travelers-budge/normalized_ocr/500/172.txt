THE NILOMETER IN THE ISLAND OF RopA.

The Nilometer here is a pillar, which is divided into
seventeen parts, each representing a cubit, i.a, 21% inches,
and each cubit is divided into twenty-four parts. This
pillar is placed in the centre of a well about sixteen feet
square; the lower end is embedded in the foundations, and
the upper end is held in position by a beam built into the
side walls. The well is connected with the Nile by a
channel. The first Nilometer at Roda is said to have
been built by the Khalif Suléman (A.D. 7rr--V7), and
about one hundred years later the building was restored
by Miinrr1n (A.D. 8r3---- 833). At the end of the eleventh
century a dome resting upon columns was built over it.
When the Nile is at its lowest level it stands at the height
of seven cubits in the N ilometer well, and when it reaches
the height of 15% cubits, the shékh of the Nile proclaims
that sufficient water has come into the river to admit of the
cutting of the dam which prevents the water from flowing
over the country. The difference between the highest rise
and the lowest fall of the Nile at Cairo is about twenty-five
feet. The cutting of the dam takes place some time during
the second or third week in August, at which time there are
generalrejoicings. When there happens to be an exceptionally
high Nile, the whole island of Roda is submerged, and the
waters flow over the Nilometer to a depth of two cubits, a
fact which proves that the bed of the N ile is steadily rising,
and one which shows how difficult it is to harmonize all the
statements made by Egyptian, Greek, and Arab writers on
the subject. As the amount of taxation to be borne by the
people has always depended upon the height of the inun-
dation, attempts were formerly made by the governments of
Egypt to prove to the people that there never was a low N ile.
