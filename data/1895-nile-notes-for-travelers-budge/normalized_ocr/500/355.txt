HAGAR SILSILEH, KOM OMBO. 331

$ 1M (il, Nubit, and Â£1.50.) by the Copts. The oldest

object here is a sandstone gateway which Thothmes III.
dedicated to the god Sebek.

The temple is double, and consists of a large court
containing sixteen columns inscribed with the cartouche of
Tiberius, and a hypostyle hall containing nineteen columns
about 40 feet high. The pronaos has ten columns, three
chambers, and two shrines; one shrine is dedicated to
Sebek and the other to Heru-ur or Aroueris. The temple
measures about 500 feet by 250 feet, and stands at a height
of about 40 feet above the level of the Nile during its low
season. By the side which fronted the river there originally
stood a propylon and a small temple built by Domitian; on
the right of this stood the mammisi. The bas-reliefs upon
the walls and columns are exceedingly fine, and the delicacy
of the colours and the fineness of the workmanship are
equal, if not superior, to the art displayed at Edfu and
Philae. The inscriptions, although of a religious character,
are of considerable interest, and among them may be
mentioned (r), the dedicatory address of Ptolemy VII.;
(2), the calendar of the festivals, (3), ephemerides with the
names of the deities who preside over the days of the year;
(4) and the texts referring to the geography of the nomes.
The whole site of the temple has been recently laid bare
by M. de Morgan.
