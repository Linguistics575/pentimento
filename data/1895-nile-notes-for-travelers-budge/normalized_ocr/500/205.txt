THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT GiZEH. 181

2I0. Grey granite statue of the lion-headed goddess
Sekhet, who represented the destructive heat of the
sun,' this monument bears the name of Amenophis III.

From the temple of Mut at Karnak.

2I3. Black granite stele inscribed with a poetical account
of the victories of Thothmes III. The text is a speech
of the god Amen-Ra addressed to Thothmes. After
describing the glory and might which he has attached to
his name, he goes on to mention the countries which he
had made his son Thothmes to conquer. O The countries
enumerated include Tchah and Ruthen in northern
Syria, Phoenicia and Cyprus, Mathen or Mitani on the
borders of Mesopotamia by the Euphrates, the countries
along the Red Sea, the land of Nubia and the countries
lying to the south of it, and the northern parts of Africa.
Although Thothmes wasted and destroyed these lands, it
cannot be said that he was successful in imposing the
yoke of Egypt upon them permanently, for history shows
that on the accession to the throne of each of his suc-
cessors it was necessary to re-conquer them. Many of
the phrases are stereotyped expressions which' we find
repeated in the texts of other kings. This monument
was found at Karnak, on the site of the famous temple of
Amen of the Apts, and shows marks of erasures madeby
the order of Amenophis IV., the king who vainly tried to
upset the national religion of Egypt. XVIIIth dynasty.
