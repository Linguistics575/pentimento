district," and the name Fayyihn is the Arabic form of the
Coptic tNoes,' "the water." The Fayytlm district has an
area of about 850 square miles, and is watered by a branch
of the Nile called the Babr-YC1suf, which flows into it through
the Libyan mountains. On the west of it lies the Birket el-

reclaimed from the desert by Amenemhat 111., a king of
the XIIth dynasty. The Birket el- -lCurfin was formerly

some to have been excavated under the direction of the
patriarch Joseph, but there is no satisfactory evidence for
this theory; strictly speaking it is an arm of the Nile, which
has always needed cleaning out from time to time, and

one of the Muhammadan rulers of Egypt. Herodotus sayst

silver (£240) every day to the king's treasury from the fish;
but when the water is flowing, into it, twenty mime (£80)?
