ABYDOS. *

Abydos, t in Egyptian i'jg√©l Abtu, Coptic 65%" T'
Arabic Harabat el-Madftmah, on the west bank of the Nile,
was one of the most renowned cities of ancient Egypt; it
was famous as the chief seat of the worship of Osiris in
Upper Egypt, because the head of this god was supposed to
be buried here. The town itself was dedicated to Osiris,
and the temple in it, wherein the most solemn ceremonies
connected with the worship of this god were celebrated, was
more revered than any other in the land. The town and
its necropolis were built side by side, and the custom
usually followed by the Egyptians in burying their dead
away from the town in the mountains was not followed
in this case, Though the hills of fine white stone were
there ready, the people of Abydos did not make use of
them for funereal purposes, the sandy plain interspersed
every here and there with rocks was the place chosen for
burial. The town of Abydos, a small town even in its best
time, was built upon a narrow tongue of land situated
between the canal, which lies inland some few miles, and
the desert. It owed its importance solely to the position it
held as a religious centre, and from this point of view it was
the second city in Egypt. Thebes, Abydos, and Heliopolis
practically represented the homes of religious thought and
learning in Egypt. The necropolis of Abydos is not much
older than the VIth dynasty, and the tombs found there

on the return journey to Cairo.
