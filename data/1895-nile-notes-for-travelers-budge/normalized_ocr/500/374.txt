350 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

seated in a shrine, accompanied by Horus, Thoth, Isis, and
Mat, the king kneels before him in adoration, and the god
says that he will give him myriads of years and festivals,
on each side is a figure of Rameses II. making an offering.
Beneath this scene is a figure of a Christian saint holding a
key, and an inscription on each side tells us that it is meant
to represent Peter the Apostle. This picture and the
remains of plaster on the walls show that the chambers of
the temple were used by the early Christians as chapels.
Korosko, on the east bank of the river, 703 miles from
Cairo, was from the earliest times the point of departure
for merchants and others going to and from the St1diin;
from the western bank there was a caravan route across into
north Africa. In ancient days the land which lay to the

east of Korosko was called ifl3iiisifTiis l Uaua,
Dag

and as early as the VIth dynasty the officer Unit visited it
in order to obtain blocks of acacia wood for his king
Pepi I. An inscription, found a few hundred yards to the
east of the town, records that the country round about was con-

quered in the XIIth dynasty by Amenemhit I. (O, &.'5' ].

About seven miles off is the battle-field of Toski on the east
bank of the Nile, where Sir Francis Grenfell slew Wiid en-
Nejilmt and utterly defeated the dervishes on August 4,
1891. A capital idea of the general character of Nubian
scenery can be obtained by ascending the mountain, which
is now, thanks to a good path, easily accessible.

At Amada, on the west bank of the river, 711 miles
from Cairo, is a small but interesting temple, which appears
to have been founded in the XIIth dynasty by Usertsen 11.,
who conquered Nubia by setting fire to standing crops, by
carrying away the wives and cattle, and by cutting down the
men on their way to and from the wells. This temple was
repaired by Thothmes III. and other kings of the XVIIIth
dynasty.
