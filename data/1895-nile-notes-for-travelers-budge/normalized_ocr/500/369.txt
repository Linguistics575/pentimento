inscriptions, are the ruins of a temple founded by At'a-char-
A111en, * a king of Ethiopia, who reigned about the middle
of the third century B.C. The names of Ptolemy VII.
Philometor and Ptolemy IX. Physeon are found engraved
upon parts of the building. Dah6d probably stands on the
site of the ancient Parembole, a port or castle on the borders

on the west bank of the river, 615 miles from Cairo, are the

there are also some ruins; they are, however, of little
