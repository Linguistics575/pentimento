LUXOR (EL-IgusUR) AND THEPoES. 293

flank it on the north and south are the work ofThothmes IH.,
but Seti II., Rameses III., and Rameses IV. have added
their cartouches to them. On this pylon are inscribed a
large number of geographical names of interest. Passing
through it, the visitor finds himself in a vestibule which
leads into a red granite oblong chamber, inscribed with the
name of Philip III. of Macedon, which is often said to have
formed the sanctuary. In the chambers on each side of it
are found the names of Amenophis I., Thothmes I., Thothmes
11., Witshepset, and Thothlnes III. The sanctuary stood
in the centre of the large court beyond the two oblong red
granite pedestals. In ancient days, when Thebes was
pillaged by her conquerors, it would seem that special care
was taken to uproot not only the shrine, but the very
foundations upon which it rested. Some fragments of
columns inscribed with the name of Usertsen I. found
there prove, however, that its foundation dates from
the reign of this king. Beyond the sanctuary court is.
a large building of the time of Thothmes III. In it was
found the famous Tablet of Ancestors, now in Paris,
where this king is seen making offerings to a number of his
royal ancestors. On the north side of the building is
the chamber in which he made his offerings, and on the east
side is a chamber where he adored the hawk, the emblem
of the Sun-god R2; this latter chamber was restored by
Alexander IV. Behind the great temple, and quite distinct
from it, was another small temple. On the south side of
the great temple was a lake which was filled by infiltration
from the Nile; it appears only to have been used for
processional purposes, as water for ablutiohary and other
purposes was drawn from the well on the north side of the
interior of the temple. The lake was dug during the reign
of T hothmes III., and its stone quays probably belong to
the same period.
