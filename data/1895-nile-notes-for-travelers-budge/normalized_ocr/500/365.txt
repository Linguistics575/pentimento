Cleopatra. The towers of the first propylon are about
65 feet high, and their southern faces are ornamented with
sculptures representing Ptolemy VII. Philometor triumphing
over his enemies. On the east side of the large court, which is
entered through the propylon, is a portico with ten columns,
and on the west side are the three chambers forming the
so-called mammisi, on the walls of which are representa-
tions of the birth of Horus. In this courtyard there is
a copy of the famous Rosetta Stone inscription, given,
unfortunately, without the Greek text. Passing through the
second propylon, a portico having ten beautifully painted
capitals is entered, and north of this are three chambers, in
the last of which is the monolith shrine. Round and about
are several small chambers and passages with secret openings.
When Strabo visited the island he saw the hawk which was
worshipped there, and which was said to have been brought
from Ethiopia.'

On the western side of the island stands the beautiful little
temple usually called Pharaoh's bed, and a little to the north
of it is a small temple built by Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II.;
the other ruins on the island are not of importance, but if
time permits, a visit should be paid to the Nilometer built
in a staircase leading down to the river. Philae was said
to be one of the burial places of Osiris, and as such was
held in the greatest esteem by both Egyptians and Ethio-
pians; it was considered a most holy place, and only priests

Afr "h little above the cataract is Philae, a common settlement, like
Elephantina, of Ethiopians and Egyptians, and equal in size, containing
Egyptian temples, where a bird, which they call hierax (the hawk), is
worshipped; but it did not appear to me to resemble in the least
the hawks of our country nor of Egypt, for it was larger, and very
different in the marks of its plumage. They said that the bird was
Ethiopian, and is brought from Ethiopia when its predecessor dies, or
before its death. The one shown to us when we were there was sick
and nearly dead."--- (Strabo, xvii., I--49, Falconer'stranslation.)
