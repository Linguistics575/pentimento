202 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

after a multitude of evolutions and developments' which
came forth from my mouth (or at my command). There
was no heaven, there was no earth, animals which move
upon the earth and reptiles existed not at all in that place.
I constructed their forms out of the inert mass of watery
matter. I found no place there where I could stand. By
the strength which was in my will I laid the foundation
[ ofthings ] in the form of the god Shu [ see page 116 ], and I
created for them every attribute which they have. I alone
existed, for I had not as yet made Shu to emanate from me,
and I had not ejected the spittle which became the god
Tefnut; there existed none other to work with me. By
my own will I laid the foundations of all things, and the
evolutions of the things, and the evolutions which took
place from the evolutions of their births which took
place through the evolutions of their offspring, became
multiplied. My shadow was united with me, and I
produced Shu and Tefnut from the emanations of my
body,...... thus from being one god I became three
gods........ I gathered together my members and wept
over them, and men and women sprang into existence from
the tears which fell from my eye." Scarabs may be divided
into three classes'.--r. Funereal scarabs; 2. Scarabs worn for

* The duplicate copy of this chapter reads, "I developed myself
from the primeval matter which I made. My name is Osiris, the germ
of primeval matter. Ihave worked my will to its full extent in this
earth, I have spread abroad and filled it...... I uttered my name as
a word of power, from my own mouth, and I straightway developed
myself by evolutions. I evolved myself under the form of the
evolutions of the god Khepera, and I developed myself out of the
primeval matter which has evolved multitudes of evolutions from the
beginning oftimc. Nothing existed on this earth [ before me ], I made
all things. There was none other who worked with me at that time.
I made all evolutions by means of that soul which I raised up there
from inertness out of the watery matter."
