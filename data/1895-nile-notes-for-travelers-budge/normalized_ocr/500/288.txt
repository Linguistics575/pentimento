264 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

described it as a town of considerable size, beauty, and
importance, and before the abandonment of the Stdin by
the Khedive, all caravans from that region stopped there.
In the hills to the west of the town are a number of ancient
Egyptian tombs, which date back as far as the XIIIth
dynasty. A large number have been destroyed during the
present century for the sake of the limestone which forms
the walls. When M. Denon stayed here he said that the
number of hieroglyphic inscriptions which cover the tombs
was so great that many months would be required to read,
and many years to copy them. The disfigurement of the
tombs dates from the time when the Christians took up
their abode in them.

Fifteen miles farther south is the Coptic town of Abu
Tig, the name of which appears to be derived from
AHOGHKH, a "granary;" and 14% miles beyond, 279 miles
from Cairo, is Kau el-Kebir (the W.13O" T of the Copts), which

marks the site of Antaeopolis, the capital of the Antaeopolite
nome in Upper Egypt. The temple which formerly existed
here was dedicated to Antaeus, the Libyan wrestler, who
fought with Hercules. In the plain close by it was thought
that the battle between Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis,
and Set or Typhon, the murderer of Osiris, took place;
Typhon was overcome, and fled away in the form of a
crocodile. In Christian times Antaeopolis was the seat of
a bishop.

Tahtah, 29r-l, miles from Cairo, contains some interest-
ing mosques, and is the home of a large number of Copts,
in consequence of which, probably, the town is kept clean.

Strmte (SOHAG), AND THE WHiTE AND RED
MONASTERIES.
St1hil.c, 317% miles from Cairo, is the capital of the
province of Girgeh; near it are the White and Red
Monasteries.
