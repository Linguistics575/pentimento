length arose. It was enlarged by Ahmed ibn Tuliln,
who built a mosque there; by Khaman1yeh, who built a

Sultan added handsome buildings to the town, and though it
suffered from plagues and fires, it gained the reputation of

1798. Cairo was occupied by Muhammad'Ali in 1805
and the massacre of the Mamelukes took place March I,
1811.
