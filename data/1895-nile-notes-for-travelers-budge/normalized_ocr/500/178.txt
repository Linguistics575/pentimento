154 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

by Sir Francis Grenfell, and when the further contemplated
precautions are taken the Museum will be as safe from fire
as any building, half French, half Oriental, can be in the
East. It cannot however be doubted that a specially ar-
ranged fire-proof building constructed in some suitable
open place in Cairo would more effectually protect the
priceless relics of a great early civilization. Here the anti

ill-health, however, M. Grébaut failed to continue the good
work which he had begun, and for a long period but little
new was done. Early in the year 1892 it was reported that
M. Grébaut was about to resign, and for once rumour was
correct. M. Grébaut was succeeded by IL Jacques de
