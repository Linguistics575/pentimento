At the beginning of the Greek rule over Egypt, the
knowledge of the use of the ancient Egyptian language
began to decline, and the language of Greece began to
modify and eventually to supersede that of Egypt. When
we consider that Ptolemy L Soter, succeeded in attracting
to Alexandria a large number of the greatest Greek scholars

Little by little the principal posts in the Government were
monopolised by the Greeks, and little by little the Egyptians
became servants and slaves to their intellectually superior
masters. In respect to their language, "the Egyptians

native language and of its time-hallowed written signs; in this
old home, moreover, of the use of writing in ordinary inter-
