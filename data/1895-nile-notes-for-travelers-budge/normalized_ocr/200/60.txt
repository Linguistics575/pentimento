THE MODERN EGYPTIANS.

The total population of Egypt proper may be fixed
roughly at 8,000,000, of whom about 130,000 are foreigners.

Sir Francis Grenfell, G.C.B., is of opinion that the popu-
lation of Egypt is now nearer vine than eight millions. In
a country where an increase in population always means an
increase in taxation, it is quite impossible to obtain an
accurate census. As far back as the time of David' the
idea of "numbering the people" has been unpopular in the
East.

It is exceedingly difficult to obtain an exact idea of what
the population of Egypt actually was in Pharaonic times, for
the inscriptions tell us nothing. Herodotus gives us no
information on this matter, but Diodorus tells us that it
amounted to 7,000,000 in ancient times. The priests
at Thebes informed Germanicus, A.D. 19, that in the times
of Rameses II. the country contained 700,000+ fighting
men; it will also be remembered that the Bible states that
the "children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them."
Exodus xii. 37, 38. In the time of Vespasian 7,500,000
persons paid poll-tax; we may assume that about 500,000
were exempt, and therefore there must have been at least
8,000,000 of people in Egypt, without reckoning slaves.

probable, however, that the population of Egypt under the
