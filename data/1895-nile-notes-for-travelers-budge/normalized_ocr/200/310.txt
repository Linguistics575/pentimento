The principal objects of interest on the east or right bank
of the river are c-

L The Temple of Luxor. Compared with Karnak
the temple of Luxor is not of any great interest. Until very
recently a large portion of the buildings, connected in
ancient days with the temple, was quite buried by the
accumulated rubbish and earth upon which a large number
of houses stood. During the last few years excavations
have been made by the Egyptian Government, and some
interesting results have been obtained. Among the antiqui-
ties thus brought to light may be mentioned a fine granite
statue of Rameses IL, the existence of which was never
imagined. The temple of Luxor was built on an irregular
plan caused by following the course of the river, out of the
waters of which its walls, on one side, rose; it was founded
by Amenophis Ill., about B.C. 1500. About forty years
after, f.feru-em-l.oel) added the great colonnade, and as the
name of Seti L, H.C. I366, occurs in places, it is probable
that he executed some repairs to the temple. His son
Rameses IL, B.C. 1333, set up two obelisks together with the
colossi and the large pylon; the large court, nearly 200 feet
square, behind the pylon, was surrounded by a double row
of columns. The Obelisk now standing there records
the names, titles, ctc., of Rameses 11., and stands about
82 feet high; it is one of the finest specimens of sculpture

. See page 71.
