opened in 1881. The Arabs call it the "Prison Pyramid,"
because local tradition says that it is built near the ruins of
the prison where Joseph the patriarch was confined. Its
actual height is about 59 feet; the length of each side at the
base is 210 feet, and the platform at the top is about

the base is about 250 feet; the arrangement of the
chambers, etc., inside is the same as in the pyramids of
Units and Tetd, but the ornamentation is slightly different.
It is the worst preserved of these pyramids, and has suffered
most at the hands of the spoilers, probably because having
been constructed with stones which were taken from tombs
ancient already in those days, instead of stones fresh from
the quarry, it was more easily injured. The granite
sarcophagus was broken to take out the mummy, fragments
of which were found lying about on the ground; the cover
