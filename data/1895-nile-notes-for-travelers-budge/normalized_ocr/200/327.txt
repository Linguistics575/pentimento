formed the PALACE OF RAMESES III. Elsewhere the king
is shown smiting his enemies, and from the features and
dress of many of them it is possible to tell generally what
nations they represent; it is quite clear that the sculptor
intended his figures to be typical portraits. It is a noticeable
fact that the cartouches of Rameses III. are the only ones
found in this building.

V. The Temple of Rameses III. is entered by pass-

court is a row of seven pillars, to which are attached figures
of the king in the form of Osiris; M. Mariette was of

second court, which, according to M. Mariette, is one of
the most precious which Egyptian antiquity has bequeathed
to us, has a portico running round its four sides; it is
supported on the north and south sides by eight Osiris
columns, and on the east and west by five circular columns.
The Copts disgraced this splendid court by building a

Beyond the second court was a hull of columns, on each
side of which were several small chambers, and beyond
that were other chambers and corridors and the sanctuary.

The scenes sculptured on the inside of the second court
represent the wars of Rameses Ill. against the Libyans, in
