EGYPTIAN WRITING.

The system of writing employed by the earliest inhabi-
tants of the Valley of the Nile known to us was entirely
pictorial, and had much in common with the pictorial
writing of the Chinese and the ancient people who migrated
into Bahylonia from the East. There 1ppears to be no
inscription in which pictorial characters are used entirely,
for the earliest inscriptions now known to us contain
alphabetic Characters. Inscriptions upon statues, coftins,
tombs, temples, etc, in which f1gurcs or rcprcscntatiuns of
objects are employed, ate usually termed'Hieroglyphic'
(from thc Crock tVeov1vriftco'v); for writing on papyri a
cursive form of hieroglyphic called'Hicratic' (from the
Greek ic/m-Imu's), was employed by the priests, who, at
times, also used hieroglyphic; a third kind of writing,
consisting of purely conventional modifications of hiemtic
characters, which preserve little of the original form, was
employed for social and business purposcs; it is called
demotic (from the Crack? ann√©g)' The following will
show the different forms of the charactcrs in the three
styles of writing-
