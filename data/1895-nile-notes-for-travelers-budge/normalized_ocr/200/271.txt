HEDRASHEN, MEMPHIS, AND SAKKARAH. 217

of the Ancient Empire found at Salilriirah belong to two
classes, in the commoner of which the naked body was
buried about three feet deep in the sand. When the
yellowish-white skeletons of such bodies are found to-day,
neither fragments of linen nor pieces of cofiins are visible;
occasionally one is found laid within four walls roughly
built of yellow bricks made of sand, lime, and small stones.
A vaulted brick roof covers the space between the walls; it
is hardly necessary to say that such tombs represent the last
resting places of the poor, and that nothing of any value is
ever found inside them. The tombs of the better sort are

The nrartaba is a heavy, massive building, of rectangular
shape, the four sides of which are four walls symmetrically
inclined towards their common centre. Each course of
stones, formed by blocks laid upon each other, is carried
a little behind the other. The largest mas.staha measures
about 170 feet long by 86 feet wide, and the smallest about
26 feet by 20 feet; they vary in height from 13 to 50 feet.
The ground on which the ma§tabas at Saleirah are built
is composed of rock covered with sand to the depth of a
few feet; their foundations are always on the rock. Near
the pyramids of Gizeh they are arranged in a symmetrical
manner; they are oriented astronomically to the true north,
and their larger axes are always towards the north. Though
they have, at first sight, the appearance of unfinished
pyramids, still they have nothing in common with pyramids

are built of two kinds of stone and of bricks, and they are
