IS FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT,

Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan, Ingénieur civil
des Mines, was born on June 3rd, 185 7, at the Chateau de
Bion, Loir-et-Cher, and is descended from a family which
came originally from Wales. For more than twenty
years he has devoted himselfuo the study of archaeology,
but he is, nevertheless, a distinguished pupil of the School
of Mines at Paris, and is eminent as a geologist and
mathematician. To the exactness induced by the study of
mathematics, and to his scientific training as a geologist
and observer of nature, his works entirely owe their value,
for he arranges his historical, geographical, and other facts
in a logical manner, and never confounds fact with theory
or assumption with evidence. In r882 he made a tour
through India for scientific purposes, and in the same year
he published his G'eologie tie & 80/12/119, 8vo. In 1884 he
undertook an expedition to Siam and the neighbouring
countries, and in the following year he published some
account of his work in Exploration dans hr tresip? Ue
Malaisie, Rouen, 1885. In this year we also find him con-
tributing articles to the newspaper L'Homme / and in 1886
he published in the Annales des Mines an important article
entitled, Note Sttt' fa glvlogit at T'iruluttrie vuhilre iii:
raymme tic Penile. During the years 1886-1889 he was
employed on ll mission to Turkey-in-Asia, the Caucasus
and Armenia, and he published the scicntiiic results of his
travels in two volumes, large 8vo, entitled, Mission Sisn-
iifityse (m Chemse. iywdes v1rdalogiques et hisioriipres,
Paris, 1889. In this work M, de Morgan shows that he is
well acquainted with the statements about these countries
made by classical writers, that he is familiar with the best
works upon general archaeology, such as those of Sir John
Evans, Montelius and Mouricr, and also that he knows well
the works of Brugsch, Maspcro, George Smith, and of other
scholars of Assyriologyand Egyptology at first hand. Yrom
