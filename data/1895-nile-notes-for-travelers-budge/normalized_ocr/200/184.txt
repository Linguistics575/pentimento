of Bey upon Mariette, and commissioned him to found an
Egyptian Museum at Btlli'rl.c. Mariette proceeded to work
out a plan for the complete excavation of ancient Egyptian
sites, and it is said that he began to work at thirty-seven
places at once; his work literally extended from "Rakot
(Alexandria) to Syene." At'l'anis he brought to light valu-
able monuments belonging to the XIIIth, XIVth, XIXth
and XXIst dynasties, among which must he specially men-
tioned the statues and' the Sphinx which he attributed to
the Hyksos; he explored hundreds of mastibas in the
cemeteries at Gizch, Saldrirah, and Mteclr" 1m; he opened
the Mas.t.'rilrat el-Far'fm (see p. 242); at Abydos, which he
practically discovered, he cleared out the temple of Seti L,
two temples of Ramescs 11., and a large number of tombs;
at Denderah, a temple of Hathor; at Thebes he removed
whole villages and mountains of earth from above the ruins
of the temples at Karnak, Mcdiuet-Hal, ul and DÃ©r el-
Bahari; and at Editl he removed from the roof of the
temple a village of huts, and cleared out its interior.
Mariette was appointed Commissioner of the Paris Exhi-
bition of 1867, and upon him devolved the task of remov-
ing to Paris several of the most beautiful and valuable
antiquities from the collection under his charge at Pnklli.
In 1870 he was overtaken by severe domestic troubles, and
a disease which had some years before fastened upon him
now began to show signs of serious progress. Notwith-
standing his infirulities, however, he continued to edit and
publish the texts from the monuments which he had dis-
covered, and remained hard at work until his death, which
took place at Cairo on January 17th, 1881. His body was
entombed in a marble sarcophagus which stood in the
court-yard of the Jhiltrl.c Museum, and which has since. been
removed to Gisele, together with the antiquities of the
Museum.
