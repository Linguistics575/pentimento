358 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

laid down by the English a few years ago to carry troops and
stores above the Second Cataract, and until quite recently
about eighteen miles of it, passing through wild scenery,
remained in situ. The other part of it had been torn up by
the dervishes, who threw the iron rails into the cataract,
used the sleepers to boil their kettles, and twisted lengths of
the telegraph wires together to form spears. This line has
again been restored by the Egyptian army.

The remains of Egyptian temples, etc., at Semneh above
the second cataract are of interest, but it is probable that
they would not repay the traveller who was not specially
concerned with archaeology for the fatigue of the journey
and the expense which he must necessarily incur to reach
them.
