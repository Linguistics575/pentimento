THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM AT m'rom. I75

133. Black granite table of offerings dedicated to the
temple at Tanis by Apepi.

XV 11th dynasty. From Tanis.

134. Black granite Sphinx excavated at Tanis by Mariette
in r863. The face of this remarkable monument has
given rise to much discussion, and the theories pro
pounded on the subject of the origin of the monument
have been many. Mariette believed it to have been
made by the so-called Hyksos, or "Shepherd Kings,'
and saw in the strange features of the face, and short,
thick-set lion's body, a proof of their Asiatic origin
Some have seen a likeness to a Tumnian original in the
features, and others have insisted, probably rightly, that
the king for whom the monument was originally made
was a foreigner. Judging from the style of the work and
the form of the lion's body, WC should probably attribute
it to a period anterior to ILL'. moo; that the name of the
so-called Hyksos king Apcpi s inscribed upon it proves
nothing except that this king, in common with many
others, had his name inscribed on the statue. On the
right shoulder, almost effaced, is the name of Apepil; on
the left shoulder is the name of Meneptah L; 0n the
right-hand side and front of the pedestal are the car
touches of Rameses IL; and on the breast is the
carlouche of PasebkMnet.
