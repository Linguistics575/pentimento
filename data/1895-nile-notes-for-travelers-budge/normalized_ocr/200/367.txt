THE NILE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND
SECOND CATARACTS.

The country which is entered on leaving Phila, is gene-
rally known by the name of Ethiopia, 0r Nubia; the latter
name has been derived by some from 711M, the Egyptian
word for gold, because in ancient days much gold was
brought into Egypt from that land. In the hieroglyphics,
Nubia ur Ethiopia, is generally called iFE rm Kesh (the
Cush of the Bible) and Egg ] Ta-kenset; from the latter
name the Arabic El-Irene is derived. It is known that,
as far back as the VIth dynasty, the Egyptians sent to this
country for certain kinds of wood, and that all the chief
tribes which lived round about Korosko, hastened to help
the Egyptian officer Unis in the mission which he undertook
for King Pepi I. It seems pretty certain too, if we may
trust Uni's words, that the whole country was made to
acknowledge the sovereignty of the Egyptian king. From
the VIIth to the XIth dynasty nothing is known of the
relations which existed between the two countries, but in
the time of Usertsen L, the second king of the XIIth
dynasty, an expedition was undertaken by the Egyptians for
the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the two countries,
and we know from a stele set up at Wsidi Halfah by this
king, that his rule extended as far south as this place. Two
reigns later the inhabitants of Nubia or Ethiopia had become
so troublesome, that Usertsen IH. found it necessary to build
fortresses at Semneh and Kummeh, south of the second
cataract, and to make stringent laws forbidding the passage
of any negro ship unless it was laden with cattle or mer-
chandise.
