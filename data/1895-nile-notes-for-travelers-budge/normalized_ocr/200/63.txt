THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. 39

confused religious beliefs and embraced Christianity; they
then retired to the mountains and deserts of their country
to dedicate their lives to the service of the Christians' God.
The Egyptians, their ancestors, who lived sixteen hundred
years before Christ, had already arrived at the conception
of a god who was one in his person, but who manifested
himself in the world under many forms and many names.
The Greeks and the Romans, who successively held Egypt,
caused many changes to come over the native religion of
the country which they governed; and since the conflicting
myths and theories taught to the people of Egypt under their

took the form of that of Eutyches (died after 451), who
sacrificed the "distinction of the two natures in Christ

incarnation an absorption of the human nature by the
divine, or a deification of human nature, even of the body."

Monophysites; in their liturgies they stated that God had
been crucified.' They formed a part of the Alexandrian
Church until the Council of Chaleedon, A.D. 451y when it
was laid down that Christ had a double nature-human and
divine-but after this date they separated themselves from
it, and were accounted heretics by it, because they obsti-

subtle points of their different opinions, until the fifth
