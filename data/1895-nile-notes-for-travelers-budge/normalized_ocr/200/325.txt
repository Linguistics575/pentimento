the colossi, and its foundation dates from Coptic times. The
early Christians established themselves around the ancient

and pylon beyond are inscribed with the names of Tirhakah,
B.C. 693, and Nectanebus IL, B.c. 358. Passing through
this last court and its pylon, the temple proper is reached.

which were symmetrically inclined to a common centre.
The interior chambers were ornamented with sculptures, on
which were depicted scenes in the domestic (?) life of the
