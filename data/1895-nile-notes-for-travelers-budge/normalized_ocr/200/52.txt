THE COUNTRY OF EGYPT.

The Ancient Egyptians called Egypt Je', Eng or

"q a a
tyRe' Baez;. "Ta-vterei: ande=
'iy;'eo fr'w.'t C) (1mm, an C)

Kamt. Baq seems to refer to Egypt as the olive-producing
country, and Ta-meri as the land of the inundation; the
name by which it is most commonly called in the inscrip-
tions is Kam, 113., "Black," from the darkness of its soil.
It was also called the "land of the sycamore," and the
"land of the eye of Horus "( t.e., the Sun). It was divided

by the Egyptians into two parts'. I. Upper Egypt gFm=t l Â©
Ta-res or Fair? Ailey Ta-geme, c; the southern land f' and

II. Lower Egypt tz" sri, Ta-med, "the northern land."

The kings of Egypt styled themselves mien net, "king of the
North and South," and m ltmz', "lord of two earths. "h
The country was divided into names, the number of which
is variously given; the list given by some of the classical
authorities contains thirty-six, but judging by the monu-
ments the number was nearer forty. The nome (fursp) was
divided into four parts; I, the capital town (7111/); 2, the
cultivated land; 3, the marshes, which could only at times
be used for purposes of cultivation; and 4, the canals,
which had to be kept clear and provided with sluices, etc.,

,

* As ruler of the two countries, each king wore the crown g
which was made up of y, the teier, or red crown, representing the

northern part of Egypt, and d, the .hed, or white crown, representing
the southern part of Egypt.',
