THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

The Egyptians, whom the sculptures and monuments
made known to us as being among the most ancient in,
habitants of the country, belong, beyond all doubt, to the
Caucasian race, and they seem to have migrated thither
from the East. The original home of the invaders was,
apparently, Asia, and they made their way across Mesopo-
tamia and Arabia, and across the Isthmus of Suez into
Egypt. ~It has been suggested that they sailed across the
Indian Ocean and up the Red Sea, on the western shore of
which they landed. It is, however, very doubtful if a
people who lived in the middle of a huge land like central
Asia, would have enough experience to make and handle
ships suifciently large to cross such seas. No period can
be fixed for the arrival of the new-comers from the East
into Egypt; we are, however, justified in assuming that it
took place before B.C. 5000.

When the people from the East had made their way
into Egypt, they found there an aboriginal race with a
dark skin and complexion. The Egyptians generally
called their land { :13 Kamt, i.e., "black"; and if the
dgrk, rich colour of the cultivated land of Egypt be
considered, the appropriateness of the term will be at
one evident. The hieroglyphic which is read Karu, is the
skin of a crocodile, and we know from Horapollo (ed. Cory,
p. 87), that this sign was used to express anything of a
dark colour.' The name Cl Ham "is given to Egypt by the

. "To denote dsrlmcss, they represent the TAIL OF A CROCODILE,
for by no other means docs the crocodile in0: t death and destruction
on any animal which it may have caught than by first striking it with
its tail, and rendering it incapable of motion."
