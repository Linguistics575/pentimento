tomb of fdesi-Rii; they are splendid examples of the

in wood during the IVth dynasty. From Salslsirah.

Khu-betep-heres, prophet of the goddess Mam of

with a scene in which geese are represented walking
along. The artist has depicted the birds with great
fidelity to nature, and was evidently a very accomplished
draughtsman. This fragile object was brought from a
ruined mugiba at Ire0m by M. Vassali, and dates
probably from the IVth dynasty.

are filled with quartz or rock crystal. Mariette placed the
period when this statue was made in the IIIrd dynasty,
but Maspero thinks that it belongs to the XIIth dynasty.
