turbing the foundations ofthe old religion of the country;..... they
introduced..... the Greek god of the lower world, Pluto, into the
native worship, under the hitherto little mentioned name of the
Egyptian god Serapis, and then gradually transferred to this the oid
Osiris worship." (Mommsen, Provinces srftire Roman Errrpire, Vol. Ir.,
