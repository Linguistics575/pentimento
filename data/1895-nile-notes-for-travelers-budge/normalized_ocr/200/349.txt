new wine, the jars for holding it, and two servants making
olTerings to Nekht of birds, flowers, etc. In the lower
division we see Nekht instructing his servants in the art of
snaring birds in nets, the plucking and cleaning of the birds
newly caught, and two servants offering to Nekht iish, birds,
fruit, etc

In the other scenes we have Nckht, accompanied by his
wife Tnui, making an offering of Jam ungueut and incense
to the gods of the tomb, and a representation of his funereal
feast.

The most ancient necropolis at Thebes is Drah abu'l
Nekkah, where tombs of the Xith, XVIIth, and XVIIIth
dynasties are to be found. The coffins of the Antef kings
(XIth dynasty), now in the Louvre and the British Museum,
were discovered here, and here was made the marvellous
"find" of the jewellery of Aihhctcpf wife of Kames, a king
of the XVlIth dynasty, about Bt'. 1750. A little more to the
south is the necropolis of Asasif, where during the XIXth,
XXIInd, and XXVIth dynasties many beautiful tombs
were constructed. If the visitor has time, an attempt should
be made to see the fine tomb of Pe.tii-Amervipt.

ARMANT (FhorErcr).

Armant, or Erment, 4581 miles from Cairo, on the west
bank of the river, was called in Egyptian eee'T' Mcnth,
and In Hot', Annu qemftt," Heliopolis of the South ";
it marks the site of the ancient Hermonthis, where, accord-
ing to Stmbo, "Apollo and jupitcr are both worshipped."

The ruins which remain there belong to the Iseion built
during the reign of the last Cleopatra (mc, 51-29). The

stone-lined tank which lies near this building was probably
used as a Nilometer.
