Cairo (from the Arabic K & hira,'the Victorious,' because
the planet ILthir or Mars was visible on the night of the
foundation of the city) is situated on the right or eastern
bank of the Nile, about ten miles south of the division of

of Semiramis. The opinions of the two last mentioned
writers are valuable in one respect, for they show that it
was believed in their time that Babylon of Egypt was
of very ancient foundation. During the reign of Augustus
it was the headquarters of one of the legions that garrisoned
Egypt, and remains of the town and fortress which these
legionaries occupied are still to be seen a little to the
north of Fospit. The word Fosthtt means a'tent,' and
the place is so called from the tent of'Amr ibn el-'Asi,

and to which he returned after his capture of Alexandria.
Around his tent lived a large number of his followers, and
