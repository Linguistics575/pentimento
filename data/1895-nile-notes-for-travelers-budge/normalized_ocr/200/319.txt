passage in which stands the obelisk of Witshepset, a long
avenue with four pylons is entered; the first was built by
Thothmes IH., the second by Thothmes L, and the third
and fourth by FJeru-em-beb. Between these last two, on the
east side stood l temple built by Amenophis II. On the

and to represent Jeroboam, who was vanquished by Shishak;
it has now been proved conclusively that they form the
name of a place called Iuta-melek, Passing along In the
