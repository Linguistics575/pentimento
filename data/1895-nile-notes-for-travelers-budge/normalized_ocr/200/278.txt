UPPER EGYPT.

Maghaighah, 106 miles from Cairo, is now celebrated for
its large sugar manufactory, which is lighted by gas, and is
well worth a visit; the manufacturing of sugar begins here
early in January.

About twenty-four miles farther south, lying inland, on
the western side of the Nile, between the river and the
Babr Yiisuf, is the site of the town of Oxyrhyncus, so called
by the Greeks on account of the lish which they believed
was worshipped there. The Egyptian name of the town

was [?, k g, I'a-mit'et, from which came the Coptic

Pemge, "( 311.256, and the corrupt Arabic form Bchnesa.

A little above Abu Girgeh, on the west bank of the Nile,
is the town of El-Kais, which marks the site of the ancient
Cynopolis or "Dog-city,"' it was the seat of a Coptic bishop,
and is called Kais, Rue, in Coptic.

Thirteen miles from Abu Girgch, also on the west bank
of the Nile, is the town of JCliis.sanah, 134 miles from Cairo,
and a few miles south, lying inland, is Samallttt.

Farther south, on the east bank of the Nile, is Gebel et.-
'wr, or the "Bird mountain," so called because tradition
says that all the birds of Egypt assemble here once a year,
and that they leave behind them when departing one solitary
bird, that remains there until they return the following year
to relieve him of his watch, and to set another in his place.
As there are mountains called Gebel et-Th in all parts of
Arabic-speaking countries, because of the number of birds
which frequent them, the story is only one which springs
from the fertile Arab imagination. Gebel et-TÃ©r rises
above the river to a height of six or seven hundred feet, and
upon its summit stands a Coptic convent dedicated to Mary
