228 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

onions, and garlic, for the workmen, which the interpreter,'
as I well remember, reading the inscription, told me
amounted to 1,600 talents of silver. And if this be really
the case, how much more was probably expended in iron
tools, in bread, and in clothes for the labourers, since they
occupied in building the works the time which I mentioned,
and no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and drawing
the stones, and in forming the subterraneous excavation.
[ It is related ] that Cheops reached such a degree of infamy,
that being in want of money, he prostituted his own daughter
in a brothel, and ordered her to extort, they did not say
how much; but she exacted a certain sum of money,
privately, as much as her father ordered her; and contrived
to leave a monument of herself, and asked every one that
came in to her to give her a stone towards the edifice she

translation of an inscription which he did not understand. William of
Baldensel, who lived in the fourteenth century, tells us that the outer
coating ofthe two largest pyramids was covered with a great number of
inscriptions arranged in lines. (Wiedemann, Acg. Getrhiclite, p. 179.)
If the outsides were actually inscribed, the text must have been purely
religious, like those inscribed inside the pyramids of Pepi, Told, and

Unis.
