equally little chance that any of its famous buildings
remain to be discovered; the utmost that may be hoped
for is the recovery of monuments and inscriptions of the
late Graeco-Roman period. The cuttings of the Alexandria-
Ramleh railway, and private diggings made for laying
foundations of houses and drains, have yielded a number
of interesting objects, but they have added comparatively

a museum, the direction of which has been placed under
the able care of M. Betti; here are exhibited a most
interesting series of monuments typical of Egypto-Graso
