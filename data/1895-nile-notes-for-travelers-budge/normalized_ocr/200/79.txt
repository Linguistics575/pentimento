EGYPTIAN WRITING. 55

The Society of Antiquaries published a fac-simile of the
inscription, which was distributed among scholars, and
Silvestre de Sacy and Akerhlad made some useful dis-
coveries about certain parts of the demotic version of the
inscription. Dr. Young was enabled, ten years after, to make
translations of the three inscriptions, and the results of his
studies were published in 1821. In 1822 M.Champollion -
(Ito Jeunc) published :1 translation of the same inscriptions,
and was enabled to make out something like an alphabet.
There appears to be no doubt that he was greatly helped
by the publications and labours of Young, who had succeeded
in grouping certain words in demotic, and in assigning ac-
curate values to some of the hieroglyphic characters used in
writing the names of the Greek rulers of Egypt. Young
made many mistakes, but some of his work was of value,
Champollion, to whom the credit of definitely settling the
phonetic values of several signs really belongs, had been
carefully grounded in the Coptic language, and was there-
fore enabled with little difficulty to recognize the hiero,
glyphic forms of the words which were familiar to him in
Coptic; Young had no such advantage. Champollion's
system was subjected to many attacks, hut little by little it
gained ground, and the labours of other scholars have

Italian, Ilchrcw, Persian nml Amhie. He tonk his degree of M.D. in
July, 1796, in 1802 he was appointed professor of natural philosophy
at the Royal Institution, and in 1810 he was elected physician to
St. George's Hospital. He was not, however, a popular physician.
Ire died on the toth of May, 1329.

ment Du Lot, in s796. He was educated at Grenoble, and afterwards
at Paris, where he devoted himself to the study of Coptic, In the
year 1824 he was ordered by Charles X. to visit all the important
collections of Egyptian antiquities in Europe. On his return he was
appointed Director ofthe Louvre. In 1828 he was sent 011 a scientific
mission to Egypt, and was afterwards made professor of Egyptian
