times on account of the trilingunl inscription, called the
'Rosetta Stone,' which was found here in I799 by a
French officer called Boussard. This inscription was
inscribed on a block of basalt, and contained a decree by
the Egyptian priests in honour of Ptolemy V., Epiphanes,
dated in the eighth year of his reign (B.c. 196). The hiero-

of the Greek rulers. The stone is preserved in the British
Museum.
