238 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

The reason why the kings of Egypt established their capital
there is obvious. From the peoples that lived on the
western bank of the river they had little to fear, but on
the eastern side they were always subject to invasions of
the peoples who lived in Mesopotamia, Syria, and Arabia;
with their capital on the western bank, and the broad
Nile as l barrier on the east of it, they were comparatively
safe. Added to this, its situation at the beginning of
the Delta enabled it to participate easily of the good
things of that rich country. The tract ofland upon which
Memphis stood was also fertile and well wooded. Diodorus
speaks of its green meadows, intersected with canals, and
of their pavement of lotus flowers; Pliny talks of trees
there of such girth that three men with extended arms
could not span them; Martial praises the roses brought
from thence to Rome; and its wine was celebrated in
lands remote from it. The site chosen was excellent, for
in addition to its natural advantages it was not far from the
sea-coast of the Delta, and holding as it were l middle
position in Egypt, its kings were able to hold and rule the
country from Phila, on the south to the Mediterranean on

the north. In the inscriptions it is called t? t? ,1 les A C)
