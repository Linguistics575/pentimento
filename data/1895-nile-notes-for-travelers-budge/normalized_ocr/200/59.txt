felliib is exactly what it was in the earliest dynasties. The
invasions of the Babylonians, Hyksos, Ethiopians (including
negro races), Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs,
and Turks, have had no permanent effect either on their
physical or mental characteristics. The Egyptian has seen
the civilizations of all these nations rise up, progress,

from time to time by their religious views and learning; he
has been the servant of each of them in turn, and has paid
tribute to them all; he has, nevertheless, survived all of
them save one. It will, of course, be understood that the
inhabitants of the towns form l class quite distinct from the
Egyptians of the country; the townsfolk represent a mix-
ture of many nationalities, and their character and features
change according to the exigencies of the time and circurn-
stances in which they live, and the influence of the ruling'
power.
