picturesque and amusing city on the Upper N ile." It stands
on mounds, the accumulated heaps of the ancient city of
Latdpolis. Any person wishing to purchase an Egyptian
donkey should remember that Esneh is the best place on the
river at which to do so.

Near Esneh is the palace built by Mahomed Ali, stand..
ing in beautiful grounds. That prince, when staying here
in' 1842, had the portico of the Temple of Esneh in the
middle of the town cleared from the rubbish, etc., which
enveloped it. It is said that the remainder of the temple
still exists under the adjacent houses. The portico, of
entrance-hall, which is the only portion visible, contains
twenty-four columns, nineteen feet in circumference and
sixty-five feet high, the capitals being imitations of the
doom-palm, vine, papyrus, etc. There is some reason for
believing that the inner temple, not yet explored, dates from
the time of Thothmes 111., but the facade and columns of
this portico are of the Roman epoch. Several cartouches of
the Caesars are seen-Claudius, Domitian, Commodus, Cara.

making offerings to the deities, and the hieroglyphics', are
very poorly executed-in these arts Egypt rapidly declined
under Greek and Roman influence. The columns and
capitals are very graceful-for in architecture, which was
less trammelled by traditional conventionalities and priestly
rules, Greek grace and freedom asserted its supremacy.

Above Esneh, game on the river becomes increasingly
plentiful-Pelican" abound. The sandstone region is soon
entered, and the appearance of the hills totally changes.
They slope away from the banks, leaving the sides and
bases covered with immense boulders. The strip of habit-
able country becomes narrower, and cultivation becomes more
arduous and precarious. [
