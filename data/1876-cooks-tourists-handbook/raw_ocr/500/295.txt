MOUNT HOR. 277

imperishable monument to the aged priest who caught a
glimpse of the Promised Land, and then laid down to
die. a
The descent from Mount Hor is very long and difficult.
Rough and steep ravines are crossed for the best part of a
day to reach the 'Arabah. This wonderful valley commences
near Antioch, in Syria; through it flows the Jordan; it
contains also the Dead Sea, and the broad valley lying be-
tween the Dead Sea and the Gulf of 'Akabah. The part of
the valley now entered is from ten to fifteen miles wide.
The sandstone mountains of Edom bound it on the east,
and the limestone mountains of the Tih wilderness on the
west. There are frequent areas of grass and flowers, and
acacias, and junipers abound. Most of it, however, is a
gravelly surface like the desert of Sinai. The traveller is
now entering the "wilderness of Zin," where the tribes of
Israel wandered, and with every part of which they must
have been familiar.

'Ain e1 Weibeh, about a day and a half from Mount
Hor, is the supposed Kadesh Barnea. It is on the
western side of the 'Arabah, where the hills begin to slope
up towards Palestine. The whole immediate vicinity is
moist and overgrown with reeds, flags, and bushes. There
are several springs, of which four are especially conspicuous
-one of them is strongly sulphurous.

Next to Sinai, Kadesh was the most important point in
the wilderness life of Israel. But it was a well-known place
long before. In the fourteenth chapter of Genesis we find
Chederlaomer and his associate kings coming to En-mishpat
which is Kadesh, in the course of that fierce war, the tide of
which was turned by the intervention of the great Sheikh
Abraham. Kadesh was the farthest point to which the
Israelites reached in their direct journey to Palestine. Hence
