the Rosetta branch of the Nile. A railway from Rosetta to
Alexandria is in construction, also a direct line to Port Said
from the Alexandria-Suez line. When these projects are
completed no part of the Delta will be more than 20 miles
from a railway.

The Upper Egypt railway is complete as far as Asyoot.
There is a twenty-five mile branch to Medeeneh, capital of
the Fayoém.

A small railway is now being worked round the First
Cataract, at Assouan 5 and saves several days in the transport
of goods, etc., between Egypt and the Soudan.

will not be great. Wells of water are numerous along the
proposed route.

There is also a project on foot for eventually continuing
the above line to Khartoom, and then along the northern
base of the Abyssinian Highlands, to the Red Sea. It is
