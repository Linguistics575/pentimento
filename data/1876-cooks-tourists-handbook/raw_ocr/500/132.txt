THE SPHINX.

About a quarter of a milefrom the Great Pyramid stands
that colossal mystery the Sphinx,

" Staring right on, with calm eternal eyes,"

and called by the Arabs, "Aboo-e1-h6l," the Father of Terror
or Immensity. The Sphinx, as an emblem of sovereign
power-intellect joined with strength-is common enough
among the monuments of Egypt, but, as regards magnitude

Its body is the natural rock, here and there adapted by a
little carving or the addition of masonry, and is 140 feet in
length. The paws, 50 feet in length, are built up of huge
hewn stones. The head is carved out of the solid rock, and
measures 30 feet from brow to chin, and 14 feet across. Its
features are now hopelessly mutilated, but are said to have
once worn " an expression of the softest beauty and most
winning grace." F rom a sanctuary between the lion-like
paws of this colossal image, sacrifices were offered to the
divinity it was supposed to represent. The Sphinx is of
immense antiquity. It was at one time ascribed to Thothmes
IV. (of the eighteenth dynasty), but subsequent research has
removed its origin many ages farther back. When Cheops
or Shoofoo reared the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx was in
existence. This is proved by the stone discovered by
Mariette Bey, No. 581 in the Boulék Museum (see p. 97).
