Under the name of No, or No-Ammon,Thebes is several
times referred to by the sacred writers. " I will punish the
multitude of N o," is the denunciation of Jeremiah (xlvi. 25).
" I will execute judgments in No." . . . " I will cut off the
multitude of No." . . . tt No shall be rent asunder," are
part of the burden of Ezekiel in the 14th, 15th, and 16th
verses of chap. xxx. In Nahum iii. 8, the Prophet N ahum,
addressing Nineveh, asks, "Art thou better than populous
N o, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters
round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall
was from the sea? " See also following verses. How
siwereiy No, or Thebes, has been "rent asunder," and
suffered from judgments of various kinds, must be appa-

In Jer. xlvi., the phrase, " multitude of N o," should be
" Ammon of No," referring to the divinity Ammon-ra, wor-
shipped in this city.
