attest the grandeur of Egyptian civilization and culture in
this period. Shoofoo, or Cheops, the victorious conqueror
of Northern Arabia, Shaphra, or Cephrenes, and Menke-
oora, or Mycerinus, reared the three Pyramids at Ghizeh
which bear their names.

"As regards the position in the Ancient Empire of the
Fourth Dynasty," says Mariette Bey, in his Aperqu de
l'Hz'stoire d'Egypte, " it may without hesitation be assumed
to mark the culminating point. At this epoch a sudden
and extraordinary impulse is evident. Egypt henceforth is
free from all her shackles, and displays the prodigies of
a civilization without a parallel in the whole world at that
period. Egyptian society is now definitely constituted. Art
has reached its full development, and attained to a height
scarcely surpassed in the most brilliant ages of the world.
Cities are founded, and the country divided into large
farms. Thousands of cattle are reared, and antelopes,
storks, etc., domesticated. The carefully cultured land yields
abundant harvests. The dwelling-houses are of elegant
architecture. There the master of the house lives, beloved
and respected among his own people. He cultivates his
flowers, or watches the games and dances performed for
his amusement. He hunts, or fishes in the numerous canals
that intersect the country. Upon the bosom of the N ile
float large square-sailed vessels, carrying on an active com-
merce. Egypt appears now in the blossoming of a vigorous
youth, and full of sap. That admirable statue of Cephrenes,
in the Museum with which S. A. Ismail Pasha has enriched
science-still, in spite of six thousand years, one of the
choicest examples of Egyptian sculpture-is it not a work
of the F ourth Dynasty? And are not the Pyramids, which
antiquity numbered amongst the Seven Wonders of the
World, also of this epoch ? "
