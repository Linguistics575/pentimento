l 90 THE NILE.

The cataracts are simply rapids produced by the waters of
the river dashing through a wild profusion of scattered
rocks. In fact, the two chains of primitive mountains,
between which the Nile flows, cross the bed of the river at
this point and impede its course by forming innumerable"
rocky points or islands. These rocks in grotesque shapes
and wild disorder, with the absence of cultivation beside the
scene, and the murmur of the struggling waters, combine to
make up a scene of savage desolation, about four miles in
length. ,

The Ascent of the Cataract in a dahabeah can be
effected by those who think the excitement rather than the
pleasure of the undertaking worth the expense. It is an
interesting process to watch from the adjacent rocks, and it
is also very amusing to see the N ubian boys threading the
rapids on logs of wood. (For Descent of Cataract, see p. 196.)

From Assouan to Philae the scenery is of a wildness
almost unearthly, Miss Martineau calls it "fantastic and
impish." The land route is to the convent of the Austrian
Mission, where boat is taken for the island. At other times,
when the Nile is less high and less rapid, the road is taken
to the village of Chellal. This is the most picturesque route
when practicable. Considerable time is saved by taking a
boat from Assouan to the foot of the cataract, and then
taking the road; the remarkable shapes of the granite rocks
and fragments of ruins are'as well seen in this "route as in
the former.

In going from Assouan to Philas, abundant examples
are seen of the ancient Egyptian custom of leaving monu-
mental inscriptions and tableaux to mark their progress
through certain places. In several of these a simple name
is carved in hieroglyphics on the rocks, in other places the
individual who wished to commemorate his journey is re-
