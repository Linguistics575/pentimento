ALEXANDRIA TO CAIRO.
I. By Road.

The traveller can proceed to Cairo either by road, by
water, or by rail; the latter being of course the principal
.tourist route.

By Road (rro miles) the course is in proximity to the
Mahmoodeah Canal to Damanhoor, and thence across the
plain to Zowyet-el-Bahr. F rom Zowyet-eLBahr the traveller
may cross the Nile, and continue by way of Menoof to
Cairo, or follow the western bank of the Nile to Embabeh,
and then cross the N ile to Boul√©k and Cairo.

Embabeh is the site of the Battle of the Pyramids.

Ii. By Water.

By Water the route is by the Mahmoodeah Canal to
Atfeh, and thence up the N ile to Cairo, a journey of nearly
170 miles. . '

This route offers few attractions 5 it is followed by those
who hire a dahabeah at Alexandria, and there commence the
water journey to the Cataracts. The Mahmoodeah Canal (see
p. ts) is 42 miles in length and about 20 ft. broad. The sub-
urban villas of Alexandria are soon left behind, and then there
is a dreary journey past Birket and other inconsiderable places
to Atfeh, on the Rosetta branch of the Nile. To this
wretched village sportsmen often repair during the season for
the snipe shooting in the neighbourhood.

F rom Atfeh the up-river course to Cairo passes Fouah,
