202 THE NILE.

Valley on one side, and the Desert road on the other, wind-
ing its course amid rocky hills. Close to the village and
along the road numberless caravans may be seen. A traveller
in 1876 saw over 2000 camels in one immense group.

Passing numerous rocky shoals and a considerable bend
in the river, A'mada is next reached. Here, out on the plain
of the desert, lies an elegant little temple half-buried in the
sand. The interior, though of great beauty, is in utter ruin.
Of the principal hall only a few columns remain. It isa very
diminutive edifice. The shrine is ten feet square. Some of the
side chambers are only five feet square, and some five by ten.
It is, however, replete with beautifully-executed hieroglyphics
and scnlpture,vividpaintings of very spirited and life-like design.

Derr (ra 3 miles from Philae), the capital of Lower N ubia,
is simply a collection of mud huts, surrounded by palm-
groves and gardens of cucumbers and melons. It contains
some three hundred inhabitants. There is an inferior temple
of the time of Rameses II. here. Crocodiles abound in the
Nile in this vicinity.

Ibreem (E.) is the supposed site of Primis Parva. It is
loftily situated, well commanding the road and also the river.
Here Petronius, the lieutenant of Julius Caesar, fought
against the warriors of Queen Candace. The neighbour-
hood is famous for its dates, which have the reputation of
being the best in the world. As the rocks hereabouts come
down to the water's edge, bold and sharp, there is some
grand river scenery. Here, too, are the remains of a castle,
built by the Romans to hold the turbulent Ethiopians in
wholesome awe of their conquerors. In later times, Sultan
Selim followed the Roman example, and placed a garrison
here to hold the Nubians in check. The descendants of this
Turkish garrison were only expelled from the place in 181 I
by the Memlooks. There are one or two interesting
grottoes and tombs at no great distance from I breem.
