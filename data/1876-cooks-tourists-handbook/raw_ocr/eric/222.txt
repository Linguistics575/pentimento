206 . THE NILE.

low. But on either bank of the river there is an emporium
on a large scale5 tents are pitched on the sand 5 piles of
bales and boxes and bags of merchandise are ranged in a
ring or square5 and in the midst, among camel furniture,
saddles, rugs, and cooking utensils, the owners and their
families and followers sedately squat. . . . Then on
the outside lie the camels, resting on the sands, and donkeys
are picketed, and big savage dogs with threatening eyes are
the sentinels keeping guard over the whole 5 ﬁres for cooking
blaze in every such encampment as evening draws on 5 and
the men, who are black as ebony, come forward as we ride
by and offer assegais and spears for-sale.”

Except when enlivened by the encampment of traders,
the scenery of Wédy-Halfa is somewhat dreary.

The Rock Of Abooseer, 300 -feet high, is about six
miles from Wédy- Halfa, on the West Bank. It affords a ﬁne
view of the Second Cataract, which is about seven miles
in length, along which Space the river dashes amongst and
over innumerable rocky islet35 some only large stones, others
rocks of considerable size, whilst some are really islands,
with layers of sand on the surface of the rocks. Around
these islands, several of them having trees, and ﬁve being
inhabited, the waters foam ceaselessly. Far in the south
the mountains of Dongola are seen like a dark blue cloud.

The'rock of Abooseer rises up, a sheer precipice, on the
side next the cataract, whilst on the desert side it is a suc-
cession of craggy rocks. It is customary at Abooseer for
visitors to carve their names, and here the practice is harm-
less and has become interesting. The names of Burckhardt,
Belzoni, Lord Lindsay, Warburton, and others known to
fame, may be seen. i

This is the usual return point for European travellers.
_ Few go farther south. Beyond the Second Cataract the Nile
is scarcely navigable for a considerable distance.
