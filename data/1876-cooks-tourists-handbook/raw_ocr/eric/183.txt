Towards the middle of the tomb are the chambers which
chieﬂy merit attention. Very varied scenes are represented
amongst others the famous harpists may be noticed of
which so many copies have been made.

This tomb received its common name from the traveller
Bruce, who was the ﬁrst to make it known to Europeans.
There was once a sarcophagus of red granite in the principal
chamber of this tomb, of which the lid is now at Cambridge .

strangers in the Ptolemaic era, and were probably those from

The Tomb of Sethi II. (No. 15) is distinguished by

The Tomb of Rameses IV. (No. 2) is distinguished

Tomb of Rameses VI. (No. 9) is 243 feet in
