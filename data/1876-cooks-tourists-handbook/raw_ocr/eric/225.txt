lying to the west of the Libyan ridge. It is reached by a
depression in the ridge about 12 miles north-west of Beni-
soéef. West and south it is cut off from the Libyan Desert
by low hills. North, lies the Lake Birket-engorn, bounded
by a ridge of bare rocks. Through the gap in the Libyan
Hills ﬂows the Bahr Yoésef, or Great Canal, which crosses
the Fyoém to Lake Birket-el-ISorn, and irrigates the district
by its various artiﬁcial ramiﬁcations. Only about half the
450 square miles of cultivatable land in the Fyoém are at
present utilized, and 70 villages represent the 300 of ancient
days. It is, nevertheless, at the present time, the most
fertile province of Egypt, the most varied in its products, and
contains the best villages. The rose-water, so much in
demand amongst wealthy Egyptians, is distilled from the
roses of the Fyoém. Apricots, ﬁgs, grapes, olives, and
other fruits thrive better here than in the Nile Valley. The corn,
cotton, and other usual Egyptian crops are very good. The
ﬁnest Egyptian sheep come from this province. Recently
the Khédive has introduced the cultivation of the sugar—cane
and the manufacture of sugar.

The Fyoém was anciently the Arsinoite nome, or province,
famous for the city of Arsinoé, or Crocodilopolis, the arti-
ﬁcial Lake Mmris, and the marvellous Labyrinth, which
even in its partially—restored state so astonished the Father of
History.

The trip to the Fyoém is accomplished by taking the
train on the Upper Egypt railway to El Wasta, and then
the branch line to Medeenet-el-Fares.

Leaving Cairo the train is entered at Bouldk-Dalzrour
station, on the other side of the Nile. The tourist must not
be impatient about starting at any precise time—the train
will set off when all is ready. Ghizeh is ﬁrst passed. Then
amongst the wheat-ﬁelds and palm-groves, the train speeds
