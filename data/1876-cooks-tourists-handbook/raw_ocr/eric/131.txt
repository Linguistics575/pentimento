tians. The best specimens of tombs of the Ancient Empire
are, however, to be found at Sakkarah.

The CauSeWaYS by which the materials were brought
for the construction of the First and Third Pyramids still
exist, though in diminished proportions. That leading to
the Great Pyramid is 8 5 feet in height and 32 feet broad.
It was by these causeways, the smooth stones forming the
outer casing of the Pyramids, were retransported by the
Caliphs and Sultans in order to erect their Mosques and
Palaces.

We extract from Dean Stanley’s Sinai and Palestine
the following graphic description of the Pyramids as they

come all the way from the First Cataract. It also seems,
from Herodotus and others, that these smooth outsides were
covered with sculptures. Then you must build up or uncover
the massive tombs, now broken or choked with sand, so as
to restore the aspect of vast streets of tombs, like those on
the Appian Way, out of which the Great Pyramid would
rise, like a cathedral above smaller churches. Lastly, you
