230 THE DESERT.

whole face of the country is becoming changed. Everywhere
along the line of the Canal herbage of various kinds is
Springing up. It is, of course, known to everyone that the
water of the Canal is salt; but as it ﬁltrates through the
sand it becomes capable of affording nourishment to vegeta-
tion. Then the large inﬂux of water into the desert has
affected the atmOSphere. The rapid evaporation which takes
place during the day descends in thick dews at night. Cap-
tains of Suez Canal steamers declare that even in the case of
such a rarity as rain, the rainfall is every year markedly in-
creasing. The new verdure of portions of the desert itself
attracts the clouds according to a well-known natural pheno-
menon. It is also asserted that more and more each year
the climate of the northern portion of the Gulf of Suez is
becoming assimilated to that of the Mediterranean. This is
owing to that very steady, though gentle current which is
known to ﬂow through the Canal in the direction of the Red
Sea, where, as is natural, evaporation goes on at a greater
pace than in the Mediterranean. It has been tested and
found true that the water of the Canal at the Suez mouth,
notwithstanding that it has passed through ninety miles of
burning desert, is cooler than that of the Red Sea ten miles
or so south of Suez. Since the Canal was opened there has
been threefold more water in the Bitter Lakes. This
summer, especially, a change for the cooler has been noticed
by numbers of observers 1n the desert which is ‘spanned by
the Bridge of Water.’ ”

A few statistics of the Suez Canal, culled chieﬂy from
the States-man’s Year-Book for 1876, may interest the tourist
whilst tracking its somewhat monotonous course. The
following table shows the growth in the prOSperity of the
Canal: -—
