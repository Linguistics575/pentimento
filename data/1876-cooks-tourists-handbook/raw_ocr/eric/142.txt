I 2 8 EGYPT.

more than a kilt of white linen cloth, and not always that,
though there is generally a necklace of blue and white glass
beads, and invariably there is a wig—a huge black, moppy,
furry black wig; for the wig was truly a great institution of
the Egyptian land in its earliest days.”—(Piazzi Smyth.)

Under later dynasties, the character of the pictures on the

walls of the entrance-chambers changed. Mystic repre-
sentations of the soul’s passage to eternity, its judgment, and
future state, are ﬁgured. The all-pervading power of the
king and the priesthood becomes increasingly manifest, and
a whole pantheon of gods come upon the scene.
P But tourists who desire to become acquainted with the
details of Egyptian tombs must refer to the many learned
works written on the subject. The chief special objects of
attraction at Sakkérah are the Serapeum, the Pyramids, the
Tomb of Tih, and the Tomb of Phtah-hotep.

The Serapeum is the tomb of the Divine Bulls of
Apis, described by Strabo. It has been entirely excavated,
but is now mostly re-covered with sand. The part seen is
the burying-place of the sacred bulls from 6 50 3.0. to 50 B.c.
Some of the sarcophagi are still in their places. The stelae
have been mostly removed.

The Pyramids of Sakkarah are eleven 1n number.
The largest IS built In stages, and 18 thought to be the oldest
in Egypt, dating from the reign of Ouenephes, the fourth
king of the ﬁrst dynasty. It is I90 ft. in height, and
contains a number of chambers and passages in which about
thirty mummies were found. One of the adjacent Pyramids
is truncated, and is called by the Arabs Mastabat-el-Pharaoon,
the throne of Pharaoh. A little to the north of the Great
Pyramid are the pits where the mummies of the sacred
ibis are preserved in earthenware pots. The mummies are
now mostly dust.
