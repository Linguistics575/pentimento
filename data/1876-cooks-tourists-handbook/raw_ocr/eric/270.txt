252 THE DESERT.

Of the three routes leading from Wady-ed-Dehseh to the
Wédy Ghurundel, the central route is mostly chosen, through
the Wédy Sadur, the Wédy Wardan, and the Wzidy Amarah.
In the latter valley are seen the group of rocks called Hagar-
el-Rekkab, or Stone of the Rider.

Ain Hawarah (the Fountain of Destruction) is usually
identiﬁed with Marah, where the bitter waters were made

The Baths Of Pharaoh, at the mouth of the Wédy
Ghurundel, near the sea, are some hot sulphur springs said
by Arab traditions to arise from the watery grave of Pharaoh

Jebel Hammém Pharoon, I 500 feet high.

The Wédy Useit, which is reached after crossing the
plain of El Gargal, has a fountain, and palm trees are
numerous. The rocks are very ﬁne 5 some exactly resemble
fortresses and battlements. The Wédy Ethal and the
mouth of the Waidy Shebeikah are next passed. Here a
