ZAGAZIG. 2 I 7

Boethos, the ﬁrst king of the second dynasty, a chasm of the

Zagazig is a junction station. There is a branch line
from here to Benha (p. 80), on the Alexandria and Cairo
Railway,——passing Mineh-el-Ganah, a growing commercial
town, with extensive steam mills, and lofty chimneys in the

The population of the town is 38,000. Several Europeans
reside here. There is nothing to detain the traveller unless

at a short distance from the town.

Leaving Zagazig the railway follows the course of the
Sweet-Water Canal, which supplies the stations and
towns on the Suez Canal with drinking water. Along the
banks of this canal cultivation is re-establishing itself as it did
of old, when the Bubastis Canal was in existence. The grit

argillaceous matter, which only requires a sufficiency of
