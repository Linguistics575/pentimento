Sepulchre by Christians.” In this enclosure is a mound
called the Kom- es-Sultan, formed of the débris of myriads
of tombs through successive ages. M. Mariette hopes to
ﬁnd, through the excavations now in progress, the tomb of
Osiris beneath this mound.“ The rich and powerful of the
Egyptians," says Plutarch, “ are desirous of "being buried at
Abydos, in order to be, as it were, in the same grave with
Osiris himself.” It is conjectured that it is the graves of these
worthies that have gradually formed the mound just described.

The NecrOpolis, from which four-ﬁfths of the stelae
in the Boulék Museum, and many other objects, were
derived, is so completely altered and overturned as to present
little of interest to the general visitor. The tombs are chieﬂy
of the sixth dynasty (3700 3.0.), the twelfth dynasty (3000
3.0.), and the thirteenth dynasty (2800 3.0.) Those of the
latter epoch are mostly in the form of a pyramid of crude
brick, the interior being hollowed out into a cupola. But
amongst the earliest. tombs (sixth dynasty) in this N ecropolis,
a vaulted roof with a true arch, with bricks Specially formed
for its construction, is not unfrequent.

Farshoot (368 miles from Cairo) contains another of the

ﬁne. Theban palms, dates, and acacias are abundant, Indian
corn, sugar-cane, and various leguminous herbs, are ﬂourish-
ing luxuriantly over the fertile land that delights the eye
with its perpetual greenness. Numerous small places are
passed—amongst them Bajoom (W.), How (W., anciently
Diospolis Parva), Kasr es Sydd, the ancient Chenoboscion,
formerly celebrated for its geese and now the largest depdt of
turkeys on the Nile, Dis/melt (W.) and Fow (E.)
