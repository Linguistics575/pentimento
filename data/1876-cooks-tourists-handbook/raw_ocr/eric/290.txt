terraces, now mostly broken, and ruins of ancient aqueducts
and ediﬁces are seen.

The Sik, or Cleft, which forms the entrance to Petra, is
reached somewhat suddenly. It is a narrow ravine, with
rocks of red sandstone, from one hundred to three hundred
feet in height, rising perpendicularly on each Side. Anarrow
line of sky is mostly seen between, but at places the passage is
completely overarched. The Arab tradition asserts that this
was the cleft caused by the stroke of Moses’ rod when the
Israelites were miraculously supplied at Kadesh.

Dean Stanley identiﬁes Petra with Kadesh Barnea.

Near the entrance to the Sik are two temples with large
chambers, excavated in the solid rock, and ornamented with
columns and pyramidal towers. Chambers variously adorned
ﬁll the rocks on either side the valley. Several immense
monoliths in the form of sarcophagi, evidently intended for
tombs, are carved out of the rock, and adorned with cornices
and bas-reliefs. .

Entering the Sik, the traveller soon passes under a beau-
tiful Roman arch, 75 feet in height, which formerly sup-
ported an aqueduct. Yew trees and creeping vines in
festoons clothe the recesses of the rocks. Along the cleft
ﬂows a stream, and here and there fragments of the old
Roman road are perceptible. Niches, once ﬁlled with
statues, are seen on either side ; and whenever a widening
of the S‘ik gives space, ruins of temples can be observed.
For a mile and a half the traveller journeys through this
wonderful ravine, and then emerges on the wider valley,
called the Wédy Moosa.

In the Wédy Moosa, just opposite the Sik, stands the
ediﬁce called by the Arabs El Khuzneh Faraon, or
Treasury of Pharaoh. It is a temple or sepulchre, cut in
the rock, with a facade of two stories. The lower story
