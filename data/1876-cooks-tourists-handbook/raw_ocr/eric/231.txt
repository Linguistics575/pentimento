CAIRO TO SUEZ. 215

more reeds and rushes than one ﬁnds on the borders of the
Nile. One valley which we crossed was surprisingly
picturesque. Its broad winding bed lay a hundred feet
below the level of the plateau. Half-way down there was a
sheikh’s tomb, beside a grove of immense tamarisk trees.
After crossing the water, the path climbed along the edge of
clay buffs, and gained a height whence the great plains to
the north, and the glimmer of the lake, became visible.”

The author just quoted asserts that “ the word ‘ back-
sheesh ’ is unused throughout the whole of the Fyodm.”

The Glen of Fiddimeen is very beautiful. It is a deep
winding valley, along which the waters leap and sparkle.
Orange gardens, and palm groves, and vineyards on either
hand delight the eye and make the air fragrant. F iddimeen
itself is a very picturesque half-Muslim, half-Coptic, town.
Sen/war is built on piles of ruins, the accumulation of ages.
There are some Saracenic ruins, and large mounds of earlier
remains. The tall chimney of the sugar reﬁnery at N erleh
is seen to the West.

oAIRo TO SUEZ.
(By Railway, 150 miles.)

The original railway, direct from Cairo to Suez, has been
abandoned; the expense of working the steep inclines in
crossing the high ground, and the difﬁculty of procuring
sufﬁcient supplies of water, necessitated this step.

The route is now by Kalioob, Zagazig, and Ismailia; the
main line to Alexandria is left at Kalioolz (p. 81). Crossing a
well cultivated district Shibeen-el—Kanater is reached;
near this village are the ruins of the ancient city of Onion,
which can be easily visited as an excursion while staying at
Cairo.
