The Rameseum or Memnonium. The proper
appellation of this wonderful ediﬁce, without a rival in Egypt
for elegant sculpture and symmetrical architecture, is the
Rameseum. It was built by Rameses 11., whose cartouche
appears on each of the walls, to perpetuate his own memory,
in fact, to serve as his own cenotaph, and be the lasting
memorial of his greatness and glory.

In front of the ﬁrst court are two pylons more or less
demolished. One of these structures (the West) looks as
if it only remained standing by a miracle of equilibrium,
but as it is described in the same way by the French savant
four score years ago, its immediate fall need not perhaps
be expected. Both the towers are adorned with sculptures
representing battle scenes, etc., from the campaign of
Rameses, otherwise known as Sesostris. The king is
represented in these scenes as ﬁghting in the thick of the
combat and changing expected defeat to victory by deeds
of personal valour.

Entering the large court, against the columns surround-
ing it are seen large ﬁgures of Rameses, with the attributes
of Osiris. In this court once sat, with hands reposing on
the knees in Egyptian fashion, the most gigantic statue ever
carved in Egypt from a solid block of granite. It measured
17 met. 50 cent. in height, and is calculated to have weighed
88‘; tons.

“ By some extraordinary catastrophe this granite statue
of Rameses has been thrown down, and theT'Arabshave
scooped their millstones out of his face; but you can see
what he was, the largest statue in the world. Far and wide
his enormous head must have been seen—eyes, nose, and
ears. Far and wide you must have seen his hands resting.‘
