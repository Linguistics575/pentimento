ITINERARY TQ FIRST CATARACT. 17

SEGON D DAY.

The excursion to Sakkarah and the Serapeum is made, start-

and after having visited the site where Memphis stood, to wit-

palace belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few

to visitors. The works generally commence in the beginning of
January, and, when in activity, the evening is the usual time to
admit visitors.

FOURTH DAY.

In two hours the boat reaches Beni—Hassan, another halting-
place for sight-seeing. Swarms of beggars, and miserable

Nile—await the arrival of the steamer. The Rock Tombs of
