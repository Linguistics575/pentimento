NATURAL PRODUCTIONS. 35

slowly ascended it before the Etesian wind, we heard the.
thundering fall of some mud-bank, and saw by the rush of
all animated Nature to the spot, that the Nile had overleaped
another obstruction, and that its boundary waters were dif-
fusing life and joy through another desert. There are few
impressions I have ever received, upon the remembrance of
which I dwell with more pleasure, than that of seeing the
ﬁrst burst of the Nile into one of the channels of its annual
overﬂow. All Nature shouts for joy. The men, the chil-
dren, the buffaloes gambol in its refreshing waters, the broad
waves sparkle with shoals of ﬁsh, and fowls of every wing
ﬂutter over them in clouds. Nor is this jubilee of Nature
conﬁned to the higher orders of creation. The moment the
sand becomes moistened by the approach of the fertilizing
waters, it is literally alive with insects innumerable. It is
impossible to stand beside one of these noble streams, to see
it every moment sweeping away some obstruction to its
majestic course, and widening as it flows, without feeling
the heart to expand with love and joy and conﬁdence in the
great Author of this annual miracle of mercy.”

Immediately after the inundation wheat, barley, beans,
peas, lentils, vetches, lupins, clover, ﬂax, lettuce, hemp,
coriander, poppies, tobacco, water-melons, and cucumbers
are sown, and in about four months or less are harvested. In
the summer season artiﬁcial irrigation is used for the follow-
ing crops—doura, maize, onions, henna, sugar-cane, cotton,
coffee, indigo, and madder. ‘

Much fruit is produced in Egypt. Besides the grapes,
which are abundant, the following are also common—dates,
pomegranates, ﬁgs, apricots, peaches, oranges, lemons,
citrons, bananas, mulberries, and olives.
