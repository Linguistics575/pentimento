ceased after it had been roughly repaired by rebuilding the
upper portion with sandstone, as seen to this day. Some
philosophers assign these sounds to expansion of ﬁssured
portions under the inﬂuence of the sun’s rays. Others say
that a priest hid himself in the interior and struck the bell-

the combat, and every year with low wailings they dip their
wings in the river water and carefully cleanse the statue.

mysterious melody ceased.
