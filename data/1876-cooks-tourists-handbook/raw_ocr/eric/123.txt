PYRAMIDS or GHIZEH. 109

At length the visitor passes beyond the line of vegetation,
and reaches the great ocean of desert sand, on the shore of
which stand in desolation the colossal Pyramids.

Upon a rocky plateau of limestone, about forty feet above
the surrounding plain, are situated the three Great Pyramids,
several smaller ones, many ancient tombs, and the colossal
Sphinx.

From the vast immensity of the desert landscape, and
the absence of objects for comparison, the Pyramids seem
scarcely larger on approaching them than when seen two or
three miles off; but when actually reached, a sense of their
immensity comes over the mind with almost appalling effect.
The best way to get an idea of their immense magnitude, as
Zincke points out, is to stand in the centre of one side, and
look up to the summit. “ The eye thus travels over all the
courses of stone from the very bottom to the apex, which
appears literally to pierce the blue vault above. This way of
looking at the Great Pyramid, perhaps, is a way which
exaggerates to the eye its magnitude unfairly—makes it look
Alpine in height, while it produces the strange effect just
noticed.”

Sir Gardner Wilkinson gives the dimensions of the
Great Pyramid, or Pyramid of Cheops, as follows :—

Base-line, formerly 756 feet, present 7 32 feet.

Perpendicular height, formerly 4.80 feet, present 460 feet.

Area, formerly 571,536 square feet, present 535,824.

Probably most will be familiar with the oft-repeated
statements that the area of the Great Pyramid is equal to that
of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and that it is about sixty feet higher
than the cross of St. Paul’s Cathedral.

The usual process in Egyptian Pyramid building seems
to have been to leave a nucleus of solid rock, and enclose it
