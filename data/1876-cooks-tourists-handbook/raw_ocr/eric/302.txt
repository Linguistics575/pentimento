capital of Edom. The traveller will, of course, be reminded
of the text—“ Who is he that cometh from Edom, with
dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his
apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?” (Isa.
lxiii. I). A strong fort, protecting a cluster of miserable
huts, is all that is to be seen. There are no ancient remains.

Bozrah is ﬁrst mentioned in Gen. xxxvi. 33, as the birth-
place of Jobab, the son of Zerah, one of the kings “that
reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king
over the land of Israel.” (See also I Chron. i. 44.) Besides
the prophecy previously quoted, Bozrah is also mentioned in
Isa. xxxiv. 6—“ The Lord hath a sacriﬁce in Bozrah, and a
great slaughter in the land of I dumea.” Jeremiah declares

a reproach, and a curse.” (See also verse 22..) The message
in Amos i. 12 is, “I will send a ﬁre upon Teman, which
shall devour the palaces of Bozrah." “The sheep of
Bozrah ” are incidentally mentioned in Micah ii. '12.

contains about 600 houses, and its sheikh is nominal chief
of the district of Jebel. Tuf’ileh is the site of Tophel
(Deut i. I).

Kerak, or Kir Moab, has a population of about

z’ireh, 'Orak, Ketherabba, etc. Kerak has a very bad repute
amongst travellers; Burckhardt, Tristram, and others have
been shamefully plundered at this place. The inhabitants
are fanatical and extortionate.
