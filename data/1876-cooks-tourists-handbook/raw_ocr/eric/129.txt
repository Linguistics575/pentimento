that the- different schools of Egyptologists differ at least
twenty centuries from each other in their chronological .
statements.

Baron Bunsen claims for Egypt at least 6700 years of
civilized and well-governed prosperity before the building of
the Pyramids in the fourth Manetho dynasty. But Mr. Piazzi
Smyth believes that the Great Pyramid was the ﬁrst reared
of Egyptian monuments, built immediately after the immi-
gration into Egypt from the plains of Shinar, by Divine
Revelation for special objects. He considers the date of its
erection was 2170 8.0., when the Pleiades were exactly
pointed at by the entrance passage. Those who are inte-
rested in seeing this theory very ingeniously worked out, and
the alleged relationship of the measurements of the Pyramid
to certain properties of the circle, the diurnal revolution of
the earth, and the standards of measure, weight, and capa-
city in various nations, should read Mr. Piazzi Smyth’s work,
Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid. Mariette Bey, in
his Itine’raire de la Haute Egypte, asserts that the Pyramids
are tombs, and nothing more, and in no case existing else-
where than in a Necropolis.

The Second Pyramid is assigned by Herodotus to
Cephrenes, the brother of Cheops. Cephrenes is considered
identical with the Shafra whose name is often found on
monuments. This Pyramid is 447 feet high, and has a base
line of 690 feet. This Pyramid is very difﬁcult to ascend,
as towards the top the ancient polished casing still exists.
If the visitor cares to see the feat, one of the Arabs will run
down from the top of the Great Pyramid, and acroSs to the
Second, and ascend to its summit, all in less than ten
minutes, for a triﬂing gratuity. The interior gallery and
chamber of this Pyramid were discovered by Belzoni in
