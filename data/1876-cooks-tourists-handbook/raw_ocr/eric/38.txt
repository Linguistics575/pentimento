SECTION II.
FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND CATARACT.

The Khédive Administration having placed a steamer
on the Upper Nile, to ply between Philm and Wédy-Halfa,
Messrs. COOK & SON inaugurated this new service in
1875. The experiment having proved a success, the Admin-
istration agreed to supply a larger and more comfortable
steamer than the one with which that service was previously
worked. The voyage to Wédy-Halfa and back may be
accomplished in twelve days, of which four-and-a-half are
employed in sight-seeing ashore, and, after the return journey,
passengers will have to make the Upper Nile steamer their
hotel for two or three extra days, waiting the arrival Of the
Lower Nile steamer at Assouan to take them back to Cairo.
These few days will be found anything but unpleasant by those
who delight in a soft climate, and admire the beauties of nature.
Varied scenes may be enjoyed every day, either by going in a
boat around the island, or down the river through the number.
less rapids which precede the Cataracts, or by riding to the.
neighbouring villages and the granite hills which border the
different camel paths towards Assouan. Were it only as a
resting-place, Philze would still be found delightful. Although
navigation on the Upper Nile is quite as easy and secure, if not
easier than that on the Lower Nile, it is desirable to allow three
days’ margin in case of any unforeseen delay above the First.
Cataract.
