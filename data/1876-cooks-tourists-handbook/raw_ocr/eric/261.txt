TANIS. 243

while a few of the latter columns lasted perhaps for another
thousand years, and then they toppled over on the lonely
plain with a crash unheard by a regardless world. The sand
soon buried them there, and even the memory of Zoan
faded away.

“ Many as are the celebrated ruins I have seen, I do not
recollect any that impressed me so deeply with the sense of
fallen and deserted magniﬁcence.”——(7. MacGregor.)

Tanis was a city of. high antiquity, and is of considerable
Scripture interest. It was built only seven years after
Hebron, which was a city in the time of Abraham (Numb.
xiii. 22). In Isaiah xix. the prophet associates Zoan with
Noph (Memphis) to express the grandeur of Egypt, and
prophesy its downfall. In Psalm lxxviii. the ﬁeld of Zoan,

reptiles and malignant fevers.” The area, covered by the
mounds of pottery, etc., is about a mile in length, by about
three-quarters of a mile in breadth.

The area of the sacred enclosure surrounding the temple
is some 1500 feet by 1250. The gateway, formed of granite

the Great. The fragments of walls, columns, and fallen
obelisks, are in a very ruinous condition, but bear witness to
the former splendour of the building of which they formed
.part. No other Egyptian temple has so many obelisks—
here there are ten or twelve all brought by Rameses. The
