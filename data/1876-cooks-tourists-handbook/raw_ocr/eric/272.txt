2 54 THE DESERT.

The enjoyment of otherwise of this part of the journey will
much depend upon what wind is blowing. A khamseen
wind or a fresh sea breeze (the latter usually prevalent 1n the
afternoon) will make all the difference.

It 15 usual after crossing the plain of Markhah, to ascend
by the narrow pass of Seih Bab’a into the mountains. The
Israelites no doubt continued by the shore for ten miles
further on, crossing the wilderness of Sin to the Wédy
Feirén, and passing up that valley to Sinai.

The Seih Bab’a is a narrow limestone valley, from
which the Wady Shellal opens out. Up this valle),
through ﬁne scenery, the road conducts to the sandstone
cliff of Nugb Buderah. A steep path, practicable for
camels, leads up the face of the cliff to a small plain at the
top. Hence the road passes on to the W’ady Nugb Bude—
rah, and then along the Seih Sidreh. Here the red
sandstone of the Sinaitic peninsula is ﬁrst met with. To-
wards the upper end of the narrow part of the Seih Sidreh
the mouth of a small valley called the Wady Igne is seen.
It is most probable that an encampment will be made near
this spot, and if so, the Opportunity should be taken before
pursuing the journey to ascend the Wédy, and devote a few
hours to the exploration of the Wédy Magharah, con-
taining the extensive excavations made by the ancient Egyp-
tians in mining for turquoises. Numerous inscriptions are
seen; on tablets of beautiful hieroglyphics are the names of
kings as far back as the time of Abraham. Senefroo, ﬁrst
king of the fourth dynasty, Cheops, builder of the Great
Pyramid, Amenemha, Thothmes, etc., ﬁgure in these rock
records. Immense must have been the labour to cut out
these caves so far up the mountain side. Swarms of Monks
tenanted the disused excavations in the early centuries of
Christianity. .
