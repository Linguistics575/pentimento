of Memphis (the Pyramids, Abouseer, Sakkérah, and
Dashoér) are still in being, and instruct us concerning the
history of this city during the diverse periods of its existence.
Already founded under the most ancient kings who 'suc-
ceeded to the throne of Menes, ﬂourishing under the
great pyramid-building fourth dynasty, and also under the
ﬁfth and sixth, neglected and abandoned under the eleventh,
twelfth, and thirteenth dynasties, Memphis, like Egypt
itself, arose to new life when the kings of the eighteenth
dynasty succeeded in clearing the soil of Egypt of its invaders.
Taken and re-taken by turns, under Assyrian, Ethi0pian,
and Persian dynasties, Memphis still preserved, under the
Greeks, a portion of its ancient splendour, although when
Strabo came, it was already deserted. But the time was
approaching when of Memphis nothing but ruins should
remain, and when the sombre menaces of Jeremiah should
be fulﬁlled to the letter: “ 0 daughter of Egypt, make ready
that which can serve thee in thy captivity, because Memphis
shall become a desert; she shall be forsaken and become
uninhabitable.” Long mounds where only the date-palm
ﬂourishes, here and there a fragment of wall, a shaft of a
broken column, some mutilated statues half-buried in the
soil or prostrate in the mud, such is, in fact, all that remains
to our day of the city that for ages exercised so vast an
inﬂuence over the affairs of the world.”

Memphis, except in Hosea 1x. 6, 18 called in the Scrip—
tures Moph or Noph, probably contractions of one of the
Egyptian names of the city Men-Nefru (Pyramid-city). It
was the capital of Lower Egypt at the time of the patriarchs.
The declaration of Jeremiah (xlvi. 19), that “ Noph shall be
waste and desolate, without an inhabitant,” has been most
literally fulﬁlled. The “princes of N0ph ” are mentioned
in Isa. xix. I3, and in jer. ii. 16, xlvi. I4 5 and in Ezek.
