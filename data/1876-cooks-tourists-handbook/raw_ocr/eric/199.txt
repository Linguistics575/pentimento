plete even than that at Denderah. The magniﬁcent pylon -
and wall of enclosure are quite unique.

Not many years ago the modern village of Edfou covered
the whole of the temple except the propylon; even the ter-
races of the roof were concealed by houses, and the interior
was choked with rubbish to the very ceilings. Now, thanks
to the energetic labours carried on by Mariette Bey, under
direction of the Khédive, the temple, in all its completeness,
is accessible to the visitor.

The entire length of this magniﬁcent temple is 450 feet;
the propylon is nearly 250 feet in breadth; the Towers
are 115 feet in height, and can be ascended by 250 steps;
from the summit there is a ﬁne view of the Nile Valley. It
is best to make this ascent before entering the temple, as in
that way a good general idea is obtained of the arrange-
ment of the building before examining its details more
minutely. These lofty towers forming a monumental entry
to the temple seen at a great distance, used to be adorned
with immense ﬂags. In the fagade may be noticed the
apertures in which the masts supportingthese banners were
inserted.

The Temple of Edfou was founded by Ptolemy IV.
(Philopator), the sanctuary and adjoining chambers being the
work of that prince; the decoration of the central halls is
due to Ptolemy VI. (Philometer) ; succeeding princes of the
same house continued the work of construction and decora-
tion till the reign of Ptolemy XIII. (Dionysius), who con-
structed, or at least decorated the pylon. The temple was
dedicated to Hor-Hat and his mother Athor, the Egyptian
Venus. In the inscriptions Hor-Hat is deseribed as “ lord
of the heavens, son of Osiris, king of the kings of Lower
and Upper Egypt, master of gods and goddesses.”
