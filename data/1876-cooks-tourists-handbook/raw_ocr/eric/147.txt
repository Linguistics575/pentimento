The Nile, called by the Romans Nilus, and by the
Greeks Nikos, from ve’a this (new mud), is the renowned
river of Egypt, so celebrated in ancient story, and whose
mysterious source has so long been a magnet of attraction
to adventurous souls.

The Nile is formed by the junction, at about 15°
north of the Equator, of the Bahr-el-Azrek (anc. Astapus),
or Blue River, and the Bahr—el-Abiad, or White River. The
sources of the former were visited by Paez in 1618, and
subsequently by Bruce.

The Bahr-el-Abiad is the true Nile, though not the

branch which supplies the “ new mud,” which, by gradual
deposit, has formed so large a part of the land of Egypt.
Of the explorations in connection with the Bahr-el-Abiad by
Grant, Speke, and Baker, etc., it is unnecessary here to
Speak. ‘
The united stream receives its last tributary, the Tacazzé,
in latitude 17° North, near the town of Addamer, and then
ﬂows on 1, 3 50 miles, without a single aﬁluent, to the sea—
a fact, as Humboldt points out, without a parallel in the
physical geography of the world.

' At Abn Hamed, what is called the Great Bend of the
Nile occurs, the river ﬂowing thence in a westerly course to
Edab, in Dongola, through a narrow valley. Lower N ubia'
is entered by the river at the Third Cataract, in latitude
19° 40'. The Second Cataract is that of Wédy-Halfa (p. 205).
