ANCIENT CANALS. 2 21

and having a threefold purpose, irrigation, communication,
and defence. To Sesostris is attributed, by Strabo and others,
the formation of the ﬁrst canal connecting the Pelusian
branch of the Nile with the Red Sea. At least, it seems
probable that a portion of the Canal, which was fortiﬁed as a
barrier against the Hyksos, was the work of that conqueror.
Herodotus says that Pharaoh N echo, son of Psammetichus,
was the ﬁrst to carry out the project we are describing, at a
sacriﬁce of 120,000 lives, by forced labour. The work was
never completed, after all. The oracle declared that the work
would be of more service to the outer world than to Egypt.
Darius, the Persian conqueror, tried to carry out Necho’s
plans, but was dissuaded by being assured that the Red Sea
was higher than the Mediterranean, and that if the connec-
tion was opened, Lower Egypt would be inundated with salt
water. For some time, accordingly, goods were brought
from the Nile along the Canal to Heriiopolis, and then un-
loaded, and the cargo placed in Red Sea vessels. The more
enlightened Ptolemies remedied this state of things by cutting
a connection, and by means of locks and sluices prevented
the mingling of the salt and fresh water. Adrian and Trajan
are both credited with having improved the canalization of
the district; but under Mahomedan rulethe course became _
neglected, and in part deliberately ﬁlled up.

In more modern times Napoleon and Mahomed Ali both
nursed the idea of cutting a canal from the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean, but it was reserved for Vicomte Ferdinand de
Lesseps to bring the project into successful action. He ﬁrst
considered the subject whilst in quarantine at Alexandria in
1831. Subsequently, he was much impressed by the
devotion of Lieutenant Waghorn, who lost health and fortune
in trying to induce the English Government to adopt the
overland route to India. Lesseps devoted his life to the
