the Rosetta branch of the Nile. A railway from Rosetta to
Alexandria is in construction, also a direct line to Port Said
from the Alexandria—Suez line. When these projects are
completed no part of the Delta will be more than 20 miles
from a railway.

The Upper Egypt railway is complete as far as Asyoot.
There is a twenty-ﬁve. mile branch to Medeeneh, capital of
the Fayoém.

A small railway is now being worked round the First

There is also a project on foot for eventually continuing
the above line to Khartoom, and then along the northern
