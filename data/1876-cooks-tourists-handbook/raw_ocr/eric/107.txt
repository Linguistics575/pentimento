CAIRO. 93

On the left of the entry 3 golden grill encloses the tomb
of Mahomed Ali, with the lamps perpetually burning. In
the court there is a pavilion in the gallery facing the F oun-
tain of Ablutions, containing a clock presented to Mahomed
Ali by Louis Philippe. From above this pavilion there is a
splendid prospect of Cairo and Lower Egypt, which some
have asserted to be the ﬁnest view in the world. At the foot
of the Citadel, stretching northward, lies Cairo, with its
innumerable domes and minarets; beyond stretches the
verdant Delta. On the right are seen the Tombs of the
Memlooks, and the Obelisk of Heliopolis; on the left are
Old Cairo and the well-wooded Island of Roda, more domes
and minarets and palaces, the grand Aqueduct, and the river
Nile, and beyond these the Pyramids of Ghizeh and Sak-

south, Mount Mokattam is seen, with its rugged steeps, its
quarries, and its ruins. Anyone staying at Cairo should
endeavour to see this view at'least two Or three times at
different periods of the day.

Joseph’s Well is another of the curiosities of the
Citadel. It has nothing to do with the Patriarch, as popu-
larly asserted, but owes its origin to Saladin, whose Arabic
name was Youssoof (Joseph), and was sunk for the military
- necessities of the fortress. According to another account,
Saladin utilized an ancient Egyptian well discovered by him
in sinking for foundations. It is ﬁfteen feet in diameter,
and reaches the Nile level at a depth of 290 feet. A wind-
ing staircase conducts to the bottom, where the donkeys are
seen at work raising the water to the t0p by means of an
endless chain, with vessels attached to it. There is also an
Aqueduct, bringing Nile water from Old Cairo to the
Citadel.

In addition to the above-mentioned buildings, the Citadel
