19 2 THE NILE.

so of columns appertaining to a small temple at the southern
extremity of the island, are a memorial of the king just
named, and in the great Ptolemaic temple, to be presently
described, the great gate of the propylon also bears the name
of Nectanebo, and is probably a relic of some earlier pile.
Under the Ptolemies and Emperors the island became covered
with religious ediﬁces. From inscriptions on these it is
evident that Philae was the last stronghold of the ancient
faith. Sixty years after Theodosius had by edict abolished
the Egyptian religion, Isis and Osiris were worshipped here,
and families of Egyptian priests had their dwelling place in
the island. Even under the reign of the Emperor Marcian,
this state of things continued, and to Philae, as to a Sacred
Island, the scattered votaries of the ancient gods of Egypt
turned with loving eyes.

The Egyptian deities were mostly worshipped in Triads.
The three to whom Phila: was dedicated were Osiris, Isis,
and Horns. Osiris was the ﬁrst of Egyptian gods, and the
future judge of the dead, chieﬂy revered for his manifesta-

evil principle, and his resurrection. All these themes are
set forth in the sculptures of the sacred isle. In the name
of Osiris, the dead who passed the judgment were absolved
from sin and obtained eternal felicity. Isis, consort of
Osiris, was the ﬁrst and loveliest of Egyptian goddesses,
and symbolized the earth or matter; whilst Osiris, her
spouse, represented the creative principle. Horus, the child
of these two, was the avenger of his father, and the conqueror
of the serpentine Typhon. Bearing these myths in his mind,“
the visitor will understand many of the sculptures at Philae.

The principal ruins on the island are those of the great
Temple Of Isis, founded by Ptolemy IL, or Philadelphus,
and comprising various additions made by later monarchs,
