Skirting the Red Sea the base of Jebel Usdum is reached
in ﬁve hours. A range of hills is passed, about ﬁve miles in
length, and consisting of mineral salt. Here probably was
the “ Valley of Salt,” where the Edomites were vanquished
by David and Amaziah. The range is called Jebel
Usdum, probably from Sodom, which was situate a little
to the north, where now are the waters of the Dead Sea.

For the notice of the Dead Sea and the Cities of
the Plain, see Cook’s Tourists’ Handbook for Palestine and
Syria.

Leaving the Dead Sea on the right, the Wédy Zumeirah
is reached and entered, and a Saracenic fortress is passed,
and then, after a few hours of dreary wilderness travelling,
a steep height is climbed, and the traveller is in “the hill
country of Judea.”

Tell Arad is a mound marking the site of ancient
Arad, a royal city of the Canaanites, whose inhabitants
defeated Israel when the disobedient attempt to enter
Palestine from Kadesh was made. Joshua subsequently
destroyed it (Num. xxi. 1—3).

Tell Main has numerous ruins and caves; here the
churl Nabal was born (1 Sam. xxv. 2).

Maon, here the view comprises many historic sites-—

was twice nearly betrayed into the hands of Saul; Carmel,
where occurred the events related in the story of David, and
Nabal, and Abigail; Eshcol, Hebron with its minarets;
also ~Iutta (Yutta), Anab (’Anéb), Eshtemoa (Semﬁ’a),
Socoh (Shuweikeh), and Jattir (’Attir) can be seen (Joshua
