264 THE DESERT.

they said to Moses, Speak thou to us, and we will hear 5 but
let not God speak to us, lest we die.”

On returning, the Convent is reached by a precipitous
gorge from near the Plain of the Willow. It was probably
whilst descending this ravine that Moses and Joshua heard
the noise of the peOple shouting, but could not understand
the reason till, on reaching a farther point, the Golden Calf
was seen; and then, in sign of the broken covenant, the
Tables of the Law were shattered at the foot of the moun-
tain (Exod. xxxii. 15—20). In descending this ravine, a
grotto is passed, from which issues a spring of ice- cold water.
This is the Cave of St. Callistratus.

The Wédy e1 Lej a, another locality easily visited from
the Convent, is a deep, narrow gorge, running between the
range of Sinai and the Jebel Abu. Here is another of the
alleged sites of the striking of the rock by Moses. This
Wédy conducts to the ruined “ Convent of the Forty,”
the oldest in Sinai. It was erected to commemorate the
slaughter of forty monks by Arabs. It is now inhabited by
the Arabs who till the beautiful gardens surrounding it at the
foot of Mount Katereena.

The Jebel Katereena, 8 5.36 feet, affords a splendid
view of the Sinaitic peninsula 5 the two arms of the Red Sea
can be traced almost to the point of union. Various sites
chosen by the monks for Bible scenes are passed on the
way—the Burial-place of the Tables of the Law, the Mould
of the Calf, the Cave of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, etc. ;
also the Stone of Moses, which he is said to have severed

with his sword.
