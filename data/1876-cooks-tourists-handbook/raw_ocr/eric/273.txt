REPHIDIM. z 55

Wei dy Mukatteb, or “Written Valley,” is reached by
continuing along the Seih Sidreh from the point where the
Wédy Igne joins it. The cliffs are in terraces, and on the
lower sandstone strata are clusters of inscriptions once sup- 4
posed to be of high antiquity, but now acknowledged to
have been made by pilgrims and hermits in the fourth cen-

and its claim to be Rephidim is upheld by many. The
weary people would be marching up the broad valley, con.

just before them. But the Amalekites occupy that position,
and bar the passage. A supply of water is miraculously
supplied, and then the enemy is attacked, defeated, and
driven from the valley. Israel then advances to the oasis,
and encamps.

At the Oasis of Feirén, mighty cliffs, rising to the
height of a thousand or ﬁfteen hundred feet, look down on
the broad valley that for several miles 15 ﬁlled with groves of
palm and tamarisk and apple trees, with small plots of wheat
and barley. The source of all this life and beauty is the
