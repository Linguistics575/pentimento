PETRA. 27 1-

’AKABAH TO PETRA.
(Four days’ journey.)

After leaving ’Akabah, and ascending the ’Arabah about
two hours, travellers turn eastward and enter the gorge of
Wédy-el-Ithm. At the entrance to the gorge is the
mountain Jebel-et-Nuin, the near summit of which, Jebel

around are of soft sandstone, and are often very beautiful

the wilderness of rocky peaks is seen beneath, intersected by
deep ravines, and coloured with the richest hues. Mount
Hor rises in lone majesty directly opposite, beyond it lies
the ’Arabah like a lake of. gold, with the Mountains of the
Tih wilderness for a background in the far distance. On
approaching the city the country gives constant evidence of
former cultivation. High up the mountain-sides rise the
