132 THE NILE.

Passing El Helleh (E.) and the mounds of Kom Ayr
(W.), the last Pyramid within the limits of Egypt is seen,
that of El Kodla (W.) 5 it is a limestone structure about
sixty feet square, and is now in a very ruinous condition—-
what remains is under forty feet in height. El Kom-el—Ahmar
(W.) is the site of Hieracon0polis, the City of the Hawks,
dating from' the time of Osirtasen I.

El Kab (52 miles from Luxor) is celebrated for its

temple are good. Natron (sub-carbonate of soda), an
Egyptian article of commerce, is found in the vicinity.

Eileithyias was a fortress guarding the entrance of a
gorge from which wild Arab tribes used to descend upon

Ancient Empire, are still visible.
