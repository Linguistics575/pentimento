PYRAMIDS OF GHIZEH. 1 1 I

distinctly, as far as the eye can reach, as the coast line of
Devon and Cornwall can be traced by anyone who stands
on the Eddystone lighthouse. Along the line of this sea of
sand, stretching into the far distance, a number of minor
Pyramids are seen, past Old Cairo, and the site of Heliopolis,
the ‘ city of the sun,’ the city called On in the .4 5th verse of
