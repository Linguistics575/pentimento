TEMPLE or DENDERAH. 155

out this ediﬁce seems to be that of serpents; these appear
in every variety of form and attitude, some are walking on
human legs, and some Spinning erect upon their tails like
corkscrews, while they present strange offerings to deities
equally preposterous.”

The great hall, or portico, with its twenty-four columns
is ﬁrst entered. The two side entrances are for priests and
attendants. The main entrance was used by the king
alone, at this portal the monarch presented himself, in long
robe, sceptre in hand, and with sandalled feet; on entering
he is recognized by the gods as King of High and Low
Egypt—ﬁrst receiving puriﬁcation from Thoth and Horus,
and then the two crowns from Wat’i and Suvan. Then
Maut of Thebes and Toom of HeliOpolis take the king by
the hand and lead him into the presence of the goddess
Athor. Such is the story as shown in the surrounding
pictures, symbolising the preparatory ceremonies performed
by the king in this great hall before passing into the temple
proper. The ceiling has a representation of the zodiac,
once imagined to be ancient Egyptian, but now proved to
date from Ptolemaic times.

The learned author of the Itinéraire gives details of the
uses of the numerous chambers of the temple. To one group
of rooms he assigns the assembling of the priests and pre-
paration for the festivals; these latter, of which a sort of
calendar is given on the walls of the second hall, consisted
chieﬂy of grand processions which circulated through the
temple, mounted to the terraces, and redescended to perform
certain rites in the exterior enclosure. In this group also
were chambers for the preparation or consecration of the
offerings, the guardianship of the sacred emblems, and the
preparation of the sacred oils and essences, also the treasury
and depé't for vestments.
