7 ~ EGYPT.

All

lemon, citron, pepper, and castor-oil ; and the ﬂowers and
shrubs are luxuriant, and of great variety.

The Mosque of the 1001 Columns will, of course,
remind the visitor of the 1001 nights of Arabian story. It
is said to occupy the site of the old Church of St. Mark,
which commemorated the scene of the Evangelist's martyr-
dom. In the Mosque of St. Athanasius, so named
from a pre-existent church, was found the sarcophagus now
in the British Museum, once known as “the Tomb of
Iskander,” but evidently of Pharaonic origin.

The Convents and Churches of Alexandria oﬂer nothing
of importance to detain the visitor. The Coptic Convent
of St. Mark does not contain the body of the Evangelist,
as pretended. That was taken to Venice in the ninth cen-
tury. The Greek Church is neither ancient nor hand-
some. Some relics of St. Catherine are shown here. The
Latin Church, and the other ecclesiastical ediﬁces of
Alexandria, are devoid of general interest.

There are several interesting Schools, Hospitals, and
similar institutions in Alexandria. There is the Naval
School, under Captain MacKillop, Pasha, R.N., the School of
Les Freres del’Ecole Chrétienne, with 600 pupils, and some
other denominational establishments. Amongst the hos-
pitals, that of the Deaconesses of Kaiserswerth is exceed-
ingly interesting, and well worthy of support.

The Catacombs are about three miles from the Great
Square. They can be visited either by land or by sea. They
are of great extent, and the interior decoration is of good
and elegant workmanship.

The so-called Baths of Cleopatra can be inspected
on returning by land to the city. They are simply some
excavations at the edge of the shore, and were probably
ancient tombs.
