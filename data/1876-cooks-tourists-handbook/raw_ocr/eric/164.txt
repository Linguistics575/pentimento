further north the ridge ends, and from that point we could
see as far as the eye could reach, the yellow brown sand of
the Libyan desert, following the thin strip of green on the ‘
edge of the Nile. Just here the cultivated land for a con-
siderable distance northward did not look more than a mile
and a half or two miles in breadth, and it was like a long
green ribbon following the course of the river, with the
yellow desert beyond. On the eastern bank the line of
green is much thinner, up to this point the fertile strip
between the Nile and the Arabian desert has scarcely ever
been more than a mile broad, and for many miles the lime-
stone rocks of the desert have come right down to the river.
It was impossible not to remember the famous passage in
Ezekiel, ‘ These waters issue out towards the East country,
and go down into the desert . . . . and everything shall live

whither the river cometh.’ ” ‘
