branch of the Nile ; on the south it receives many branches
from the same river, such as the Canals of Achmour, of
Moez, etc., and the Pelusian branch of the Nile. The

small islands, contain a population of about 15,000, who live
very miserably on the products of the ﬁsheries, to which they
exclusively devote themselves. The lake is famous for its
innumerable aquatic birds. It is very shallow, and fed
principally by the Nile, during the inundations of which
