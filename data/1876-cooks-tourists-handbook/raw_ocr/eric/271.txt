MOUNT SERBXL. 253

route diverges, which can be examined on the return journey
by those who do not intend to proceed beyond Mount Sinai
(p. 260), the road now being described continues along the
Waldy Taiyibeh, which is a wild but magniﬁcent valley,
with intervals of vegetation, with stupendous ranges of rocks
on each side, often rising to the height of a thousand feet,
and very beautiful in their varied forms and colours. The
prevailing tint is a deep rich brown blended with light chalk-
like colour, with red, and sometimes with a deep black.
There is no doubt that Israel passed through this wonderful
valley, and then (as modern travellers still do) encamped by
the sea.

At this point, “‘the scene,’ says the Rev. Dr. Harvey,
“is one of the grandest that Nature affords. On the
west the sun was setting in marvellous splendour beyond
the sea, sinking behind the distant Arabian range. On the
north-east are piles of mountains, dark, but many hued, over
which towers in majesty, Mount Serbél, the rival of Sinai.
On the north the sea stretches its blue expanse towards Suez.
It would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a grander spot on earth; and we
can easily conceive the joy of Israel as the host emerged
from the Wédy Taiyibeh, and the dreary wastes of the wil-
derness, upon this great plain, and ‘encamped by the sea,’ a
month after leaving the land of bondage.”

The dreary plains of El Murrkeiyeh and El Markhah, by
the sea-side, are next crossed. At the promontory called the
Rés Aboo Zeneemeh is the tomb of the saint after whom
this headland is named. It is usually decorated with a very
miscellaneous assortment of gifts from the faithful. Along
the road, which is sometimes found very near to the edge of
the water, by projecting rocks the traveller proceeds to the
promontory projecting from the bold cliffs of Jebel-el—Mark-
hah. The ﬂinty sandy plain of El Markhah is then entered.
