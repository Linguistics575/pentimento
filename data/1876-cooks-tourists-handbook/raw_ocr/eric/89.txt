ALEXANDRIA TO CAIRO. 75

a notable town in mediaeval times, and several other small
places.

Dessook is noted for the Festival of Sheikh Ibraheem
ed Dessookee, second only to him of Tantah amongst
Egyptian saints. Passing Ramaneah, the mounds that once
were Sais, the capital of Egypt just before the Persian
invasion, are seen. Excavations have been made, but not
even plan or position of anything can be determined—all is
utter ruin—burnt bricks and rubbish and fragments of
sculpture scarcely worth naming, are all that remain of the
city whose Splendid temples and obelisks are commemorated
by Herodotus. Here once a year all Egypt ﬂocked to keep
the Festival of Burning Lamps, when every house was
illuminated outside with lamps that burned till daybreak.
Here also were shown the “mysteries” representing the
sufferings of Osiris, strongly reminding us of the “ Passion
Plays” of later ages.

A mile or two above Werdan the ﬁrst glimpse of the
Pyramids is obtained, though twenty miles off, yet distinctly
seen through the clear atmosphere. Before reaching Cairo,
the great engineering failure known as the Barrage of the
Nile (see p. 129) is passed.

Cairo (see p. 83).

111. By Rail.

By Rail from Alexandria to Cairo the distance is 131
miles, and is got over by the ordinary trains in under seven
hours; by the express, once daily, in under ﬁve hours. The
railway was constructed in 18 5 5.

The ﬁrst-class carriages are good, and only differ from
ordinary carriages in England by having a double top, painted
white, and allowing a free passage of air for the sake of cool-
ness.
