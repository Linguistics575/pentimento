Soon after leaving Alexandria, Lake Mareotis, whose
waters once washed the city walls, is skirted to the right.
Early in the year the waters are abundant, and the lake
appears of vast extent, but it is very shallow, as may be seen

stirred when comingin contact with some famous memorials
of a dead past; but to my mind there is something inﬁnitely
more impressive in gazing upon such a scene as I have just
