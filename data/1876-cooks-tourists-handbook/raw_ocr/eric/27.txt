TRIPS TO THE PYRAMIDS. I3

NILE TOURS TO THE FIRST AND SECOND
CATARACTS-

For eight years the agency for Nile Tours has been com-
mitted to Messrs. COOK & SON by the Khédive Administration.
During that time constant improvements have been made in the
service; steamers have been converted into deck saloons and
the sleeping berths greatly improved. The food supplies have
been under their control to a great extent, and will be emphati-
cally so in the future, as they intend to exercise more rigid
regulations for the interest and comfort of voyagers. Contractors,
dragomans, and servants of every grade will be most vigilantly
watched and rigidly dealt with if any incivility or inattention is
shown to passengers. The extension of arrangements for the
Second Cataract will be improved, and no doubt ere long a class
of steamers will navigate Lthe Nile that will ensure a splendid
trafﬁc.

The service of each season will begin about the second
week in November, and Nile trips may precede or follow
trips to Palestine, as most convenient to the travellers who
wish to embrace the two objects in one visit to the East.
The trips to the First Cataract and back occupy twenty
days, and fourteen more are allowed for trips to the Second
Cataract. '

DAHABEAHS can also be secured on the best terms for all
who desire them, and dragomans and other necessary servants
and food supplies can be arranged by them on the best terms.
Messrs. COOK & SON’S ofﬁce at Cairo, on the grounds of Shep-
heard’s Hotel, affords excellent facilities for the management of
this business. Early application is necessary to secure the best
boats and the best men.
