a programme, or name the places they wish to visit, and
Messrs. COOK & SON will send them, without delay, a quotation

HOTEL COUPONS are issued not only for the countries
passed through in reaching the East, but in the East also, and
.at such a rate as to ensure economy with every comfort.

The advantages of taking Hotel Coupons may be brieﬂy
summed up as follows :—

1. Time, expense, annoyance in bartering, and ultimate
dissatisfaction, are saved by going to a well-recommended
Hotel.

II. It is a great drawback to pleasure to arrive in a Foreign
town beset by porters and commissionaires and rabble, a perfect
stranger, and without any deﬁnite idea where to go.

III. Letters from home, or telegrams, may be found upon
arrival at the Hotel, thus saving trouble or expense in ‘sending
for them to the Post Ofﬁce.

IV. The charges are all ﬁxed, thus obviating the chance of
imposition, and the disagreeable task of having to drive a
bargain at each stopping place.

V. The charges being ﬁxed at the lowest sum to ensure good
accommodation at one uniform rate, the tourist is enabled to
count the cost of his tour before starting.

VI. Travellers with coupons, bespeaking accommodation by
letter or telegraph, are always provided for even in the busiest
seasons if they inform the hotel-keeper that they have coupons.

A LIST OF EUROPEAN AND EASTERN HOTELS at which
:these coupons are available, will be found at the end of
