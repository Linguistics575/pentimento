53 EGYPT.

tude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,
saith the Lord God ” (ver. 31). We may probably ﬁnd the
fulﬁlment of this sublime prophecy in the circumstance that
the deep sufferings that now for more than 2000 years have
overwhelmed Egypt have not extinguished her national

(chap. xix.) is in great part a picture of calamity and deso-

Egypt, and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the

leeks, and the onions, and the garlic,” are abundant now
as when Israel longed for them (Numb. xi. 5),, Egyptian
irrigation is accurately described in Deut. xi. 10, a land
