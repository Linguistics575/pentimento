HOTEL ACCOMMODATION COUPONS,

ORIGINATED AND ISSUED BY

THOMAS COOK AND SON.

 

THE HOTEL COUPON business, which was commenced as a friendly
arrangement of mutual interest to ourselves, to Hotel Proprietors, and
Tourists, has far exceeded our most sanguine anticipations; and as its
beneﬁts become better known, they will be more highly appreciated by all
who are interested in the success of the scheme.

The European Hotel Coupons are issued at the uniform rate of 85. per
day, and are arranged as follows : Ist Coupon (yellow)——Breakfast,
specifying of what it shall consist. 2nd Coupon (red)—Dz'mzer at Taéle
d’Hote, with or without Wine, according to the custom of the Hotels. 3rd

Coupons or Cash.

The Coupons are accepted at full value at one principal Hotel in
each of the chief cities, towns, and places of Tourist resort in Switzerland,
Italy, on the banks of the Rhine, and at a great many places in France, Ger-

Eastern Channel Steamers and the Rhine Steamers.
