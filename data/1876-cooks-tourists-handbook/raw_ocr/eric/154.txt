I 33 THE NILE.

recite prayers before the picture which has thus had to do
double duty.
Feshun (92 miles from Cairo). Railway Station.
Malateeah (W.), and other villages are passed. The
Gebel Sheykh Embérak is seen for some time before
reaching it, and has been compared to a giant blocking the
path. It is a large table-mountain, with broken surface—
one of the cliffs closely resembles a ruined castle.
Maghégha (W., 106 miles from Cairo). Railway
Station. Here are some sugar factories belonging to the
Government and a branch railway for bringing the sugar-
cane intp the town. Aquatic birds in swarms abound on the
sandbanks south of the town. The Hagar es-Salém, or Rock
of Welfare, is passed; it derives its name from the current
belief of the boatmen that they cannot call a Nile voyage
prOSperous until they have passed this stone on their way back.
On both banks, though somewhat monotonous in general
appearance, are various remains of ancient towns. Near
Aboo Girgeh on the west bank is Béhnesa, representing
the ancient Oxyrinchus, City of Fish Worshippers. Béhnesa
was a notable place in Arab and Memlook times, and had
a wonderful legendary warrior-saint, one et-Takroory.
Mounds and grottoes in various directions from Aboo Gir-
geh mark the sites of ancient Cynopolis, “City of Dogs,"
and other old-world places. Near Sheykh Fodl on the E.
shore are remains of temples, and tombs with dog-mum-
mies, etc. .
Golésaneh, or Kalouseneh (W., 134 miles from
Cairo), is threatened with destruction by the action of the
Nile waters. It is, as usual, a mud-built village with a
beautiful palm grove.
Semaloot, with its minaret consPicuously rising from
its palm grove, is seen on the west shore.
