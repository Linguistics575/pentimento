TOURS IN EGYPT, PALESTINE, ETC. vii

 

From Beyrout the usual course is to take steamer along the coast to
Cyprus, Rhodes, Smyrna, and Constantinople; from thence to Syra and
Athens, and back to Italy and Austria. But of the routes to and from
Palestine we shall speak when we have done with this series of itineraries.

EIGHTH ITINERARY.

Combining all that is included in the Seventh, with the
addition of the Coast Route by Sidon. Tyre, and
Carmel to Jaﬂ'a.

Forty days are required to do justice to this extended tour, which should
commence at Beyrout, and be taken in the following routine to Jaffa, from
which point the whole of the Seventh Itinerary may be taken, as given
above :—-

First Day. —Start with the camp from Beyrout, cross a sandy plain, and
get to the coast as soon as practicable, continuing near to the sea to Sidon.
Seven to eight hours will be required for this section.

Second Day. -—Pass the little village or “ city of Sarepta,” as described
of old, to Tyre, and stop there a night. Six or seven hours in the saddle.

Third Day. —Descend the Tyrian Ladder to the Valley of the Kishon,
halting for a night at Acre. A day’s ride of about six hours.

Fourth Day.—Pursue the course from Acre to the foot of Mount
Carmel, and encamp there. It will be interesting to visit the monastery,
and get the commanding view which its position affords of the “ great sea"
and the Carmel range, which are full of interesting Scripture memories.

Fifth and Sixth Days should sufﬁce for the journey by the coast, past
Caesarea, the seat of Roman power and magniﬁcence, and the scene of
various events and incidents recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. There
i; not much left to indicate the magniﬁcence of the palace that existed
t ere.

As indicated above, having arrived at Jaﬁ'a, the route already described
may be taken just as it stands in the Seventh Itinerary, o'r deviations may
be made at discretion. Either way, by Kirjath-Jearim or Bethhoron, may
be taken to Jerusalem, or it would be practicable to go southward to
Philistia, reversing one or other of the itineraries already given, round by
Gaza or Gath to Hebron, and thence to Jerusalem. In forty days this
might be accomplished.

The foregoing eight itineraries cover the chief districts of interest west
of the Jordan and in the Lebanon. We now propose to cross the Jordan,
and show a couple of practicable routes in the Land of Moab, and one in
the Hauran to the east of Damascus.

NINTH ITINERARY.
First Tour to Moab.

Jaﬂ‘a to Jerusalem, as already described, by carriage or saddle horses in
one day or two ; allowing two days for the journey, we begin on the

Third Day—And take trip, already described, by Solomon’s Pools and
Bethlehem to Mar Saba.

Fourth Day.-——From Mar Saba to the Dead Sea and the Jordan, en.
camping on the bank of the river after a journey of about seven hours.
