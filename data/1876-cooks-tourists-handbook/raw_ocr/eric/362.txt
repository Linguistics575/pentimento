Few things can exceed in value the worth of a good book, for books are
suitable to all times, seasons, places, occasions, and tastes. Milton has said.
“As good kill a man as kill a good book," and many of the world's greatest
intellects have testiﬁed how much they owe to the diligent use of their oppor-
tunities for reading, and whether it be in the “ Institute ” or the “ Library,” the
holida ramble in the shady lane or upon the sea-shore, or for the ﬁreside and the
easy 0 air, nothing is so truly an unobtrusive companion and a quiet friend as a
good book. '

purposes of study, should visit the above rooms, where they may insped
