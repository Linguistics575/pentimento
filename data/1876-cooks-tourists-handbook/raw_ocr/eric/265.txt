PENINSULA or SINAI. 24.7

and peaks amongst which the Wédies wind. Often the
traveller appears to be hemmed in in a complete cul de sac,
till, on advancing, an easy and ample passage suddenly opens
where least looked for.

The scenery is, for the most part, exceedingly sterile.
Neither house nor garden, nor fence nor tree is seen for miles
and miles ; only sand and rock, and occasionally a few small
bushes. The rocky cliffs are devoid of vegetation, and yet
possess a beauty of their own. “ I cannot recall,” says a
recent traveller in these regions, “ a single aiguille or needle
such as constitute the glory of the Bernese Oberland; yet
still the variety of form and colour, and direction and con-
stituent elements, is such, as continually to awaken admira-
tion. Now it is a sandstone formation, scaled off by wind
and rain so as to look exactly like some old ruined castle ;
then again a huge mass of porphyritic granite rears itself in
one precipitous cliff. Sometimes the lofty walls of a Wédy
approach at one end within ﬁfty feet of each other, as at the
Gates of Feirén (p. 257), and these stand for several yards
as steep and smooth as if cut out by hand. Or, again, as at
a point a little below the Wédy-el-Azim, the cliffs of red
granite shoot out from their roots a low spur of grey granite
on each side, and these, almost meeting, give the appearance
of a gigantic gateway, at which you almost expect to see a
portcullis or a sentinel in armour. Yet even apart from
these exceptional cases, there is a charm in the very naked-
ness of the rocks which causes them to stand out each in
its own distinctive character. Often they are striped with
numberless veins of a brilliant hue, or shaped into rare and
fantastic forms. The unequalled clearness of the atmo-
Sphere gives peculiar power to light and shade, and often the
sunlight will cover a distant peak with purple and gold,
while nearer hills lie in deep shadow, and intermediate cliffs
