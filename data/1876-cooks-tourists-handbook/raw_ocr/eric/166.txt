tains several mosques, a Coptic monastery, and a Franciscan
hOSpice of refuge for persecuted Christians. The remains -
of two temples in the vicinity and some other ruins were
part of ancient Pan0polis. Of this city, some have asserted
it. to be the oldest in Egypt, assigning its foundation to

of Ham.” N estorius died at Ekhmeem in the ﬁfth century.

Mensheeyah (W.), 318 miles from Cairo, has an ancient
stone quay. There is an excellent market. Here is pro-
duced the celebrated sweetmeat “ Mensheeyeh-el-Neideh."
The cemetery is extensive and curious, and the dead are
brought to it from a considerable distance round, as it is
above the level of the inundation. Ptolemai's Hermii was the
ancient Egyptian city once existing in this neighbourhood.

The Nile is now skirted for some distance on the east
bank by the hills called the Gebel Tookh. Aysemt, noted
for turkeys, is passed on the west bank. ‘

Girgeh (E.), named from its monastery of St. George, is
a dirty, uninteresting place. The church is half-buried
underground, formed of stone from the old ruins. It contains
a handsome screen of fretted woodwork, a wooden commu-
nion-table (stone altars being forbidden by the Alexandrian
Church), and some early MS. Liturgies, Coptic Scriptures, etc.

Bellianeh (W.) This is the point from which to visit
the magniﬁcent ruins of Abydos.

Abydos is reached by a journey of six miles across the
plain on donkeys to the edge of the desert. Its most
ancient name was Thinis or This, famous as the birthplace
of Menes, and reputed burial-place of Osiris, and second
only to Thebes amongst the cities of Upper Egypt.

The visitor to Abydos ﬁnds four principal objects of _
attraction—the Temple of Sethi, the New Tablet of Abydos,
the Temple of Rameses, and the N ecropolis.
