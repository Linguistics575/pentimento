LAKE MCERIS. 213

below ground—appears to have been assigned to each of the
twenty-seven departments of the kingdom. Each of these
chambers was roofed with a single stone slab. N 0 material
but stone had been used throughout the structure. The
pillars were monoliths of red granite, and of a limestone so
white as to have been mistaken for Parian marble, and of so
compact a texture as to have received a good polish. The
sculptures of the courts and chambers were singularly bold
and good. Those of each court and the connected chambers
had reference to the history, the peculiarities, and the religion
of the department to which it had been assigned. Beside
the chambers were numerous halls, porticoes, and passages.
The area of the roof composed of the enormous slabs just
mentioned, may have formed the actual place of assembly for
the collected deputies of the departments. On the north
side stood the Pyramid in which was buried Amenemha III.,
who, if he had not originally designed the Labyrinth, had,
at all events, been its ‘chief constructor 5 for his escutcheon
is frequently found in the existing remains. The Pyramid
was cased in the white limestone used in the Labyrinth itself.”

When Herodotus saw this ediﬁce, it had been partially
restored by the Dodecarehs, after a decay of some twenty
centuries. It was once the grandest existing building in the
world, the glory of the old monarchy, and the province
which had been artiﬁcially created by the Bahr Yoosef,
as Egypt itself is naturally created by the Nile.

Lake MCBI‘iS was a vast reservoir of dammed-up
waters, thirty miles in extent, which also awoke the astonish-
ment of Herodotus. The site only is to be found. In this
lake dwelt the sacred crocodiles. It also abounded in ﬁsh,
from the pickling and salting of which a considerable
revenue was derived, and assigned as pin-money to the
Queens of Egypt.
