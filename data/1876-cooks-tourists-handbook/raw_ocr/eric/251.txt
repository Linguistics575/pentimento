that amount of business which inevitably would have become
ﬁne by degrees and beautifully less—until totally lost to view.
The enormous amount of cargo carried by the steamers
trading to the East only suit large markets, and to an appre-
ciable amount even glut them at times, and small steamers
for long voyages are unproﬁtable; but Port Said, under the
altered circumstances, now presents a point of radiation for
the stocking of the Mediterranean seaports with the small
amounts of cargoes suitable for their requirements, and at
much less expense than roundabout sources of supply.

“ Such is the great value we put on the step taken by her
Majesty’s Government, but there is one impediment in the
way, and we beg to invite the attention of the British
Government to it. Port Said ought to be made a free port,
for if the Khédive’s Government levy a duty on all produce
landed and warehoused at Port Said in transitu for other
places and not for Egyptian consumption, such duty would
restrict commercial operations. The mere fact of taking
duties even if they were wholly remitted on export, requires
additional capital and clerical labour, and this being costly is
added to the price of the goods, raising them much above
what it would be were no duties collected on such goods at
all. We, therefore, trust that her Majesty’s Government
will go a step further, and not consider their work ﬁnished
at its present stage, but complete the act by having Port Said
made a free port.”
