244 EGYPT.

architecture is in the best style of Egyptian art, the beautiful
lotus and palm capitals of the columns have often been
commented on.

Pbtah, Amnon, and other deities were worshipped in
this temple, also some Assyrian deities introduced by the
Hyksos, of whom some interesting memorials have been
found in Sais. The ovals of various other kings, besides
the most frequently recurring one of Rameses, are found
here. Under the twenty-ﬁrst dynasty Tanis was the capital
of the kingdom. Two black statutes and a granite sphinx,
with numerous blocks of hevvn and sculptured granite, are
amongst the noticeable objects in this desolate spot.

As Sais and Memphis rose into importance, Tanis pro-
bably declined, yet twenty years before the Christian era it
is described by Strabo as a large town, and it did not become
insigniﬁcant for another century. It was probably long
sustained by its linen manufactures. Flax was very success-
fully cultivated on the marshy ground in the vicinity, and
Pliny speaks of the Tanitic linen as the ﬁnest in Egypt.

Matareeah is a village about twelve miles from Sais,
where all life, subsistence, commerce, recreation, everything,
seem centred exclusively in ﬁsh. In the marshy vicinity
the sportsman may sometimes ﬁnd a boar amongst the tama-
risk bushes and reeds, and at any time can exercise his skill
on the water-fowl that congregate in the vicinity in the most
amazing abundance.
