CAIRO. 95

and a most surprising contrast awaits you. A court, im-
mensely vast, presents itself to the astonished eye ; in the
midst is an enormous fountain, with a dome, and at the end,

city. The architecture is graceful and elegant, and the
ornamentation superb. It cost £600 a day for three years
to rear this building, and it is asserted that the architect’s
