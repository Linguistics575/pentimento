1 72 THE NILE.

The main part of the ediﬁce consists of two immense
pyramidal towers. The exterior architecture merits careful
study, but it is in the interior decoration that the chief
interest of the palace centres. Here Rameses III. is seen
at home, in the bosom of his family. One lady offers him
