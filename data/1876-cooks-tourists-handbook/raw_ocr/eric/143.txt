SAKKARAH. 129

The Tomb of Tih and the Tomb of Phtah-hotep
are the two best examples for the tourist to examine, of
the ancient Empire tombs previously described.

In the neighbourhood. of Cairo, if time allows, several
other interesting spots may be visited besides those we have
. described. There are the Tombs of the Memlooks,
about a mile from Cairo, beautiful examples of Saracenic
mausoleums, now almost entirely given over to wild dogs
and outcast Arabs. The Petriﬁed Forest is about ﬁve
miles further from the city—a desert Space covered with
fragments of sycamore and palm, apparently turned to stone.
It is worth while, if it can be managed, to extend this trip
to the summit of the Mokattam Mountains, where
much more of the petriﬁed wood will be seen—some of it
in the actual position it occupied in growing. This petriﬁed
timber has no connection with ,any living vegetation of
Egypt at the present day.

Tourists interested in hydraulics may like to visit the
Barrage, a grand undertaking commenced by Mahomed
Ali in 1847, intended to keep back the Nile waters during
the eight months of ebb-tide after the inundations. It has
never been completed, and now simply obstructs navigation

But I am here now, for my third winter, and I have no doubt
