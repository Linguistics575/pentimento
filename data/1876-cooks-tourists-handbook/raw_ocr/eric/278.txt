260 THE DESERT.

boxes of bones from distant places, being the remains 'of
persons who have desired the privilege of resting at Mount
Sinai. Amongst them is the skeleton of St. Stephanos, in a
gaudy dress.

The Convent Gardens are extensive, and abound with
orange, lemon, almond, apricot, and many other fruit-trees.
The shops where the monks manufacture oil from the olives,
and arrack from the dates, Will interest some visitors.

The Library will form to many the chief interest of
the convent. The story of Tischendorf’s discovery of a
complete MS. copy of the Bible in this library is well known.
It was with much difﬁculty that he got access to it. The
Emperor of Russia, at Tischendorf’s instigation, demanded
it of the monks, and they reluctantly gave it up, and were
paciﬁed by the presentation of a new casket for the bones of
St. Catherine, and a fac-simile copy of the precious MS.
The MS. is now at St. Petersburg, and is known throughout
the learned world as the “ Codex Sinaiticus.” Two very rare
books are shown in the Archbishop's Room. One is a
superbly-executed COpy of the four GOSpels, called the
“Codex Aureus." It is elegantly written in Greek, pre-
ceded by pen pictures in gold of the Twelve Apostles, dating
as far back as the ﬁfth century, and transcribed by Theo-
dorus. There is also a copy of the Psalms, in Greek, writ-
ten on six leaves, each measuring 5% by 3% inches. It is
said to be the work of St. Thecla,‘ and the writing is so small
that it can only be read with a magnifying-glass. In the
Library are a number of Greek printed books, Arabic MSS.,
etc. There is also an admirably-executed MS. of the Acts
of the Apostles. .

MOUNT SINAI AND ENVIRONS.‘

Mount Sinai is not, as popularly supposed, a solitary
mountain towering in immense majesty on an immense plain.
