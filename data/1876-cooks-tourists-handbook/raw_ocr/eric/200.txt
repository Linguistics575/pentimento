this temple: some diSplay the warlike achievements of the
Ptolemies, many are of the usual religious character.
From some have been derived valuable geographical facts as
to Ancient Egypt. There are some curious inscriptions on
the basement of the exterior of great importance; they
describe in detail the various chambers of this temple,
giving the dimensions, so that a means for accurately com-
paring ancient and modern measures is thus afforded. The
name of the architect is given as Ei-em-hotep Oer-si-Phtah
(Imouthes, grandson of Phtah). Another inscription states
that, with interruptions from war, the building took ninety-
ﬁve years to complete; this must refer to the actual con-
struction of the building—as from the names of kings men-
tioned above, the buildings and decorations were not ﬁnished
in less than 170 years.

The Great Court is ﬁrst entered, about 140 feet by
I 50 feet, and surrounded on three sides by thirty-two dis-
similar columns.j The Pronaos, next entered, stretches
across the building, and contains immense pillars covered
with hieroglyphics. The Adytum contains twelve peculiar
columns bulging excessively at the centre; on each side are
four small rooms—one has a staircase leading to the terrace.
Several other courts and chambers are visited, and at the
extreme end of the building is the N aos, or sanctuary. The
place of deposit of the sacred emblem was not, as at
Denderah, a niche in the wall, but the grey granite monolith
now lying in one corner of the apartment; this was the
repository of the sacred hawk, emblem of Hor-Hat ; the
monolith was made by N ectanebo 1., of the thirtieth dynasty,
for an older temple to which the present ediﬁce succeeded.
There is an exquisite little chapel covered with very perfect
bas-reliefs on the north side of the building ; this sanctuary
was connected with the New Year Ceremonies.
