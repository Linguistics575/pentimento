xii TOURS IN EGYPT, PALESTINE, ETC.

ROUTES FOR INDEPENDENT TOURS.

Independent travellers, in small or large parties, can be provided for
over any route they choose to select, either from America, London, Paris,
Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland, the South of France, or Italy. Travellers
from any point can have tickets to travel when they please and how they
please, with or without coupons for days, weeks, or months.

We have already intimated that we can provide passages from America
by any line of Atlantic steamers ; and taking London as the starting-point
for the East, the following, amongst other routes, can be provided for t--

London to Paris, Dover and Calais, or by Dieppe ', London to Brussels,
by Calais, Ostend, Harwich, Antwerp, or Flushing.

Paris to Italy by Macon and Mont Cenis, or by Marseilles, Cannes,
Nice, Mentone, and Genoa. '

Paris to Italy by Geneva or Bale, through Switzerland, and by any
Alpine road.

Paris to Brussels, Cologne, and up the Rhine to Heidelberg, Strasburg,
Bale, and over the Splugen or St, Gotthard to Milan ' or from the Rhine
to Munich, and over the Brenner to Verona, and through Italy.

Italy may be traversed in going out or in returning, and travellers may
tarry as long as they like in any Italian city.

All steamers from France or Italy are available. From Marseilles, the
Messageries Maritimes, which also take up at Naples. F rum Genoa,
Leghom, or Naples, the Rubattino steamers to either Alexandria or Port
Said. From Venice, Ancona, or Brindisi, the Mail Steamers of the Pen-
insula and Oriental line to Alexandria, which line is also available from
Southampton to Port Said or Suez. From Venice, Trieste, Brindisi, or
Corfu, the Austrian Lloyds, which encompass the circle of the Levant, and
the steamers of which line are most practicable for Palestine tours. All
our personalIy-conducted tours go by that line because it is the best adapted
for our purposes.

On the Syrian Coast we offer a choice of Austrian, French, Russian, or

ian steamers. We thus command the entire steamboat accommo-
dations of Italy, F rance, and the Levant, and we can also give tickets to
go through Algiers, Sicily, and other islands of the Mediterranean, in
connection with Palestine, Egypt, the Nile, and the Desert. We can
furnish tickets to return to America by the south course of the Atlantic,
from Gibraltar direct to New York, without returning through Europe;
or we can arrange for visiting Scandinavia either before or after the Palest

tine tour.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

In face of such variety of routes it is almost impossible to quote fares
for inde endent travel until it is known exactly what applicants desire.
We pre er that Passengers should make out their own programmes, or name
the places they wish to visit, and the time they wish to spend abroad, and
we can then give them quotations.
