ITINERARY TO SECOND CATARACT. 25

DAILY ITINERARY FROM FIRST TO SECOND
CATARACT.

FIRST DAY.

At Phila, 5 miles from Assouan. Having now left the con-
fines of Egypt proper, Nubia is entered. The steamer by which
the voyage is continued will be in readiness, and the baggage
transferred from the other steamer. The starting takes place
soon after getting on board.

An hour-and-a-half': course, and Debod, or Dab6d, a small
village on the west side of the river, is reached. Here is a ruin,
in a good state of preservation, of a temple commenced by the
Ethiopian King, Ashax-Amun. The steamer stops here for
the night, and, according to the time of arrival, the excursion is
made the same day or the following morning.

SECON D DAY.

The distances between the places of interest on the Upper
N ile are very short, and, with few exceptions, they all lie within
a few minutes from the steamer, so that although ample time is
allowed for sight-seeing, several may be visited in the same day.

In two hours Kardash or Gertéssee is reached, 15 miles from
Debod, which possesses the remnant of a temple and a quarry.

In a few hours more the narrow part of the Nile, called
" Bab-ei-KaJdbsheh " or Strait of Kalibsheh, is passed. For a
distance of four or five miles the granite mountains enclose the
river on either side, offering at every curve varied views of
most grand and wild scenery. When in the broad stream
again, Kalébsheh is soon reached. The steamer stops here four
hours and passengers visit the ruins, which are of some size and
beauty, and consists of the remains of two temples; one, the
largest temple in Nubia, must have been, when perfect, a mag-
nificent pile. In some chambers to which access can be gained
