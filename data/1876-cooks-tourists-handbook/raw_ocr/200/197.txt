picturesque and amusiugcity on the Upper Nile." It stands
on mounds, the accumulated heaps of the ancient city of
Latopolis. Any person wishing to purchase an Egyptian
donkey should remember that Esneh is the best place on the
tiver at which to do so.

Near Esneh is the palace built by Mahomed Ali, stand-
ing in beautiful grounds. That prince, when staying here
in 1842, had the portico of the Temple of Esneh in the
middle of the town cleared from the rubbish, etc., which
enveloped it. It is said that the remainder of the temple
still exists under the adjacent houses. The portico, oi
entrance-hali, which is the only portion visible, contains
twenty-ftn1r columns, nineteen feet in circumference and
sixty-five feet high, the capitals being imitations of the
doom-palm, vine, papyrus, etc. There is some reason for
believing that the inner temple, not yet explored, dates from
the time of Thothmes m., but the facade and columns of
this portico are of the Roman epoch. Several cartouches of
the Caesars are seen-Claudius, Domitian, Cummodus, Cara-
calla, etc. The sculptures in relief representing princes
making offerings to the deities, and the hieroglyphicsâ€˜, are
very poorly executed-in these arts Egypt rapidly declined
under Greek and Roman influence. The columns and
capitals are very graceful-for in architecture, which was
less trammeiled by traditional conventionalities and priestly
rules, Greek grace and freedom asserted its supremacy.

Above Esneh, game on the river becomes increasingly
plentiial-pelicans abound. The sandstone region is soon
entered, and the appearance of the hills totally changes.
They slope away from the banks, leaving the sides and
bases covered with immense boulders. The strip of habit.
able country becomes narruwer, and cultivation becomes more
arduous and precarious.
