164. THE NILE.

of time,of which history keeps the reckoning, roll before
them; they have seen kingdoms and nations rise and fall-
the Babylonians, the Jews, the Persians, the Greeks, and the
Romans. They have seen the childhood of all that we call
ancient, and they seem likely to stand to tell their tale to
those who will hereafter call us the ancients."

Under the name of No, or No-Ammon,Thebes is several
times referred to by the sacred writers. " I will punish the
multitude of No," is the denunciation of Jeremiah (xlvi. 25).
" I will execute judgments in No." . . . " I will cut off the
multitude of No." . . . " No shall be rent asmnder," are
part of the burden of Ezekiel in the 14th, 15th, and 16th
verses of chap. xxx. In Nahum iii. 8, the Prophet Nahum,
addressing Nineveh, asks, "Art thou better than populous
No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters
round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall
Was from the sea? " See also following verses. How
severely No, or Thebes, has been "rent asunder," and
suffered from judgments of various kinds,must be appa-
rent to every observer.

In Jer. xlvi., the phrase, "multitude of No," should be
"Ammon of No," referring to the divinity Ammon-ra, wor-
shipped in tius city.
