mosques. 45

Mosque building about a century after the Hegira, and gra-
dually the Saracenic style of architecture predominated
throughout the Mahomedan world. The chief Egyptian
Mosques are Saracenic.

Islamism is an enemy to plastic art; in the Mosques are
found no pictures, no statues, no representations of living

elegance of form and harmony of colour, without infringing
his religious sample. The subject is well commented on
in the following passage from Mr. Raskin's Stones of

any animal form into his ornament; but although all the
radiance of colour, all the refiuemen.ts of proportion, and all

most power when practised in arrangements of simple geo-
metrical form ; the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage
in colouring, and he had all the noble elements of construc-
tive and proportional beauty at his command; he might not
imitate the sea-shell, but he could build the dome. The
