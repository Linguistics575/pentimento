PHILIE. 195

for the punishment of those who offended the majesty of
the priesthood."

The whole area of the ancient temple was 435 ft. long
by 135 broad, according to some measurements, but it is diffi.
cultto say how much of the surrounding ruins were adjuncts
of the temple, or separate structures.

In after times, when the Christians were in the ascendant
in Nubia, the sculptures were defaced with hammers, and
the paintings daubed with mud. In 577 A.D. the interior
of the temple became, under Bishop Theodorus, the church
of St. Stephen, and at a yet later period, a Coptic church
was built up out of the ruins.

Taken as a whole, the ruined Temple of Isis at Phila: is
an elegant example of the lighter architecture of the Ptole-
maic era, and does not present the aspect of colossal grandeur
seen in the Thehan ruins.

There is a staircase leading to the top of the propylon.
The view is very fine, and has been thus described c-

" Beneath lies the verdant and flowery islet, strewn with
marble wrought into every beautiful form known to ancient
art; over that pile of prostrate pillars, a grove of palms is
waving .'. from between the columns of yon small temple,
the acacia's foliage seems to gush, and its blossoms stream.
Round all the island flows the clear, bright river, and
opposite lies the old Temple of Osiris, now called Pharaoh's
Bed. Beyond the river are gleams of green, shooting across
drifts of desert sands, palms, rocks, villages, and wastes '
and over all, darkly encircling this paradise, rises the rugged
chain of the Hemaoeuta, or golden mountains.

Of other ruins on the island of Philae, the principal are
as follows :-

Isis, near the beginning of the eastern corridor.
