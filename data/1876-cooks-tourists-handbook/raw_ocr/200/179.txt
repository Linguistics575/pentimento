THEBES. 163

The Thebans had borne for two centuries and a half, under
their Greek masters, political servitude, heavy taxes,habitual
annoyance, and occasional cruelty. Under the government
of Cleopatra Cocce the measure of their injuries overflowed,
and taking advantage of the revolutions in Alexandria, a
large part of Upper Egypt rose in rebellion. When Lathyrus
returned to Egypt, Thebes refused obedience. For three
years the brave Copts, intrenched within their temples,
everyone of which was a castle, withstood his armies; bat
the bows, the hatchets, and the chariots could do little
against Greek arms; while the overthrow of the massive
temple walls and the utter ruin of the city prove how slowly
they yielded to greater skill and numbers, and mark the con-
querors' distrust lest the temples should again be so made use
of. . . The wide acres of Theban ruin prove alike the
greatness of the city, and the force with which it was over-
thrown; and this is the last time that Egyptian Thebes is
met with in the pages of history. The habitations of the
city were swept away, but the temples, miles apart, form the
nuclei of different scattered hamlets, whose inhabitants till
the plain, once covered with the living millions of the ancient
city. The Christians, under the Greek Emperors, raised
their puny structures amidst the colossal courts of Medeenet-
Haboo,* but fled on the conquest by the Arabs, whose
degenerate successors make their habitatious amongst the
tombs of Gama, and gain a precarious subsistence by
rMiag their contents, and dragging from their repositories
.the mummied remains of their tenants.

"But the ruined temples still stand to call forth the
wonder of the traveller. They have seen the whole portion

. The Hon, R. Curzon, in his Mimtssteries of Me Levant, gives a

curious account of a night visit to a tomb to inspect the MSS. once
belonging to the Theban monastery.
