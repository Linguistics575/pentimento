EGYPT is bounded by the Mediterranean on the north i by
the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea on the east; and
by the great Libyan Desert on the west. The area of Egypt
was officially stated in 1870 as 216,000 square miles. But
the Khédive also rules over Soudan and the Red Sea coasts
down to Massowah, in latitude 15° 34' N. la 1872 the
Egyptian territory had reached a total of 730,000 square
miles, and more recently Sir Samuel Baker has added im-
mense districts, stretching south to the Equator.

Egypt proper is really the valley of the Nile owing
its existence and fertility to that wonderful river. The
valley of Egypt proper commences at the First Cataract,
near Assouan (p. s86), the ancient Syene. From this point for
600 miles the valley,varying from two to ten miles in width,
is enclosed by mountains on each side,with occasional defiles
leading westward to the Cases, and eastward to the Red
Sea. This valley forms the Said, or Upper Egypt, anciently
called the Thebaid. Lower Egypt consists of the Delta of
the Nile, and the level plains adjacent. Central Egypt is
rather a geographical expression than a clearly defined dis.
trict; including the Fyo6m, and country round Cairo, from
the issuing of the Nile from its narrow mountain-girt valley
till its separation into the channels by which it reaches the
Mediterranean.
