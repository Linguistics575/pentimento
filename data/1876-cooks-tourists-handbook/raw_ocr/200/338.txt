journey from Jenin to Nazareth in less than seven to eight hours. Again
we advise the spending of Sunday at this place of sacred memories.

Ninth Dar-The journey from Nazareth to the Sea of Galilee, by
Kenna, or Cana, occupies about six hours in the saddle, or more if the
camp is stationed at the head of the lake. If possible two days should be
appropriated to this locality, so rich as it is in historical reminiscences, in
addition to its pleasant natural attractions.

Tenth Day.-Two ways present themselves from the head of the lake--
the site of the ancient Chorazin and Capernaum, to Baits- Caesarea
Philip i. The way by the Waters of Merom occupy two days, and that
by Sn ed and Naphtali takes three days. The latter is the most interest-
ing, and is free from the swamps and damp of the lower road. The
choice of these two ways is generally left to the travellers, who may be
guided by the state of the weather and the time at their disposal. Assuming
that the high road is preferred, three days will be consumed between the
Sea of Galilee and Brta'a"s, and to that section of the itinerary we allot the

Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Days of travel, arriving at Biniés on
the Thirteenth Day of actual travel, not including the time spent at Jem.
salem and the Sunday at Nazareth, to attain which the start from Jerusalem
should be not later than Wednesday morning.

Fourteenth Dar-Starting from Béniis, there is a pretty sharp rise up
the slopes of Hermon until an elevation of about 5000 feet from the sea
level is reached. It is a rough way at best, and in stormy weather the
most disagreeable part of the journey, often blocked with snow, and then
difficult to discern the outlines of the track. Eight hours of uninterrupted
travel bring the riders to Kefr Hawar, a camping-pound still too elevated
and exposed to the rude blasts from Hermon to be very agreeable. It is
always pleasant to get safely on the way to the great plain on which
Damascus is located, and the

Fifteenth Day is generally a pleasant ride of about six hours to Da-
mascus, where a Sunday and about a couple more days are required to get
a good view of the peculiarities of the city.

Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Days are spent in traversing
the heights and depths of the Anti-Lebanon, following for a day or more
the course of the Barada (the Abana of Scripture), which is crossed and
revcrossed " several points. The ride altogether is very fine in good
weather, and the day's work not ve heavy. We generally get into Baalbec
I little after midday, on the thi day out from Damascus, and a long
afternoon and evening, and pleasant early morning, are consumed amid the
ruins of the famed group of demolished temples, which still present features
of great artistic beauty and strength.

Nineteenth Day.-A comparatively easy ride of about eight hours down
the fertile valley of the Lebanon brings the traveller to a convenient camp-
ing-ground, adjacent to the diligence road from Beyrout to Damascus. It
is interesting to deviate a little mm the beaten track, and pass through the
Christian village of Zahieh, where the good effects of Christian education
are seen in the marked decorum of an apparently thriving population.

Twentieth Day.-The journey to Beyrout is continued over ttn excellent
coach road rising to an elevation of 5000 feet, and then descending by
winding slopes, with magnificent scenery on either hand, to the best-buiit

Ir, most prosperous city in Syria. At Beyrout the itinerary tenni-
na es.
