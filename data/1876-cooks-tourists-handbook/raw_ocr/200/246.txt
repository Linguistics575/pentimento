228 THE DESERT.

Ruins in every direction tell of the ancient importance of
this place. It was a frontier city of Egypt on entering the
field of Zoan. Its name was Mésés, and it was celebrated
as the birthplace of Orus, the oldest Egyptian deity, typical,
like the Greek Apollo, of the Sun. This place must have
been one of the most ancient in the world. It was the spot
at which the Asian tribes must have entered to people
Egypt. Ten miles west of Kantarah are some mounds
marking the site of Daphne, the Tahpannes of the Bible.

Lake Menzaleh (p. 240) is next crossed, affording
an almost limitless view of lake and morass, and numerous
islets. Waterdowls abound in vast variety-geese, ducks,
and herons, and also pelicans and flamingoes, are in-
numerable.

Crossing the Pelusiac branch of the Nile at Kil, and
passing Ras-el-Ech (on an island), the islands of Termes
and Toonah, with a few ruins to the left, and in sight of the
remains of ancient Pelusium to the right, a low bank of
yellow sand is crossed, and the terminus of the Canal reached
in the harbour of Port Said.

The banks of the Canal (as it crosses Lake Meuzaleh)
are formed of the dredgings of sand and clay brought up
from the bottom. At the Port,these dredgings, mixed with
lime, have been hardened into the stone piers forming the
arms of the harbour. The banks formed of this material,
and stretching for many miles beside the Canal, are frm and
regular throughout the line.
