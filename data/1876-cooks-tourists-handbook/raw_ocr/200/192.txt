I 76 THE NILE.

the Valley of the Queens, where, in strict propriety, those
royal ladies are buried by themselves. This valley is of
little interest, except to the student of heiruglyphics.

The Dayr-el-Bahree rests against the slopes of the
Libyan Mountains, on the outer edge of the Necropolis. It
is a monument to the glory of Queen Hatasou, who was for
a time Regent of Egypt for her brother Thothmes m., and
for a time ruled in her own right.

The plan of the temple is different from that of any
other in Egypt. The courts are at different levels up the

was used for sepulchral purposes. In one chamber Ptolemaic
mummies were found piled up nearly to the ceiling above
the mummies of Pharaonic times.

The remains of Thebes on the eastern bank of the N ile
will next be described. These consist almost exclusively of
Luxor and Karnak.

Luxor is a capital approach to Karnak. Courts, and
columns, and statues, and ruins are mingled in splendid con-
fusion. One lonely obelisk stands erect, its companion
having been removed to the Place de la Concorde at Paris.
The Temple of Luxor was built under the eighteenth
dynasty in the reign of Amunoph III. (1600 mc.) The
lofty colonnade on the river-bank was added in the reign of
Horus (1480 3.0.), whilst the great court, with two obelisks,
the colossal statues, and the pylon were added by Rameses I I.
In the interior, the names of Tirhakeh, and Psammetichus,
