glow with rosy tints as beautiful to see as they are difficult
to describe. Barren and uninviting as the region is, it has
an exhaustless store of grand and pleasing sights. Simple
as the elements of the landscape are, they are so wondrously
combined, that no one Waidy is a copy of another, but each

The spotted hyena, the ibex, the gazelle, the Coney, and a
few other animals, dwell amongst these mountains, but they
are very difficult of approach. The birds also are exceed-
ingly shy; a few species of partridge, and the sand
grouse, and the quail, are met with. Near the Red Sea teal
and duck and other water-fowl are occasionally found. The
climate is intensely dry, and very healthy. The old hermits
asserted that the desert air was so life-giving, that man
scarcely needed either sustenance or repose.
