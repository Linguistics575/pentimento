capital of Edom. The traveller will, of course, be reminded
of the text-"Who is he that cometh from Edom, with
dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his
apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?" (Isa.
lxiii. r). A strong fort, protecting a cluster of miserable
huts, is all that is to be seen. There are no ancient remains.

Bozrah is first mentioned in Gen. xxxvi. 33, as the birth-
place of Jobab, the son of Zerah, one of the kings "that
reigned in the land of Edam before there reigned any king
over the land of Israel." (See also 1 Chron. i. 44.) Besides
the prophecy previously quoted, Bozrah is also mentioned in
Isa. xxxiv. tr--" The Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a
great slaughter in the land of Idumea." Jeremiah declares
(xlix. I 3)--"Bozrah shall become a desolation, a wasting,

in Amos i. 12 is, "I will send a fire upon Teman, which
shall devour the palaces of Bozr J' "The sheep of
Buzrah " are incidentally mentioned in Micah ii. â€™12.

Tutiteh is three hours farther north. It stands on the

contains about 600 houses, and its sheikh is nominal chief
of the district of Jebel. Tufileh is the site of Tophel
(Deut i. s).

Kerak, or Kir Moab, has a population of about

unimportant villages are passed on the way,Aimeh, Khan-
zireh, 'ortsk, Ketherabba, etc. Kerak has a very bad repute
amongst travellers; Burckhardt, Tristram, and others have
been shamefully plundered at this place. The inhabitants
are fanatical and extortionate.

In Tristram's Land qf Manb the site of Kerak is thus
