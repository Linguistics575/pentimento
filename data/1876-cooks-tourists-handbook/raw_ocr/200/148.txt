, 32 THE NILE.

The Nile enters Egypt at Philae (p. 191), near which is
the First Cataract (p. 189), that of Assouan, which many tra-
vellers make the boundary of their Egyptian explorations.

From this point, the Nile is generally a tranquil, wind-
ing river, giving life to a strip of land often not more than
ten miles wide, hemmed in by scorching deserts and barren
mountains, yet glowing with beauty and fertility, and replete
with the most magnificent ruins on the face of the earth.

Anciently, the N ile reached the sea by seven mouths;
all are now closed except those of Rosetta and Damietta.
The western (Rosetta) mouth is 1,800 feet wide, and about
five feet deep in dry seasons; the eastern mouth is only half
as wide, but is generally two or three feet deeper. The
Delta of the Nile commences a little N . of Cairo, about 90
miles from the sea, and is about 85 miles wide at its
broadest part.

'The Annual Rise and Subsidence of the Waters of the
Nile has been already alluded to (p. 34).

The greatest breadth of the Nile is about 2,000 feet, and
its average current about three miles per hour. From
Assouan to Cairo, 580 miles, the banks are completely
covered with all sorts of vegetables raised by the ceaseless
industry of the inhabitants.
