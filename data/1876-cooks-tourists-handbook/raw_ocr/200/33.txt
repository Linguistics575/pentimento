ITINERARY TD FIRST CATARACT. 19

EIGHTH DAY.

In the morning passengers are conveyed in boats across the
river, where donkeys are waiting to take them to the Temple of
Denderah, about an hour's ride. This is the first monument of
the kind met with, and the impression it produces is never to
be forgotten.

If the visit to Denderah is finished by noon, the boat may
reach Luxor the same evening, and anchor opposite the Temple
of Luxor. The portico of the temple is occupied by the office
of Mustapha Aga, the well-known and frequently-mentioned
English consul. He speaks English fluently, is always willing
and ready to oblige, and at once sends his servant on board
to welcome new arrivals and invite them to his house, where
coffee is always ready, and Fantasias may be organized.

NINTH DAY.

At Luxor. The first day is generally devoted to a visit to
the Kings' Tombs. Starting early in the morning across the
stream by boat, the donkeys having already been conveyed
across by the same means, in about an hour arrive at the
Temple-palace of Koorneh, and after having examined it, con-
tinue through the desolate valley " BalreI-Moiook " to the Kings'
Tombs. Only two or three of the most interesting need be
entered-Belzoni's Tomb, N o. 17, and Bruce's, No. 11. After
lunch, those who like a walk can go over the mountain chain,
and come down near the Memnonium or Ramesium. The
others return by the same way they came, and a halt is made at
the Memnonium. On the way back to Luxor the ruins of the
Temple of Amunoph III. and the sitting Colossi may be visited.

TENTH DAY.

At Luxor. Once more across the river, and partly over the
same ground as the day before, to visit the Temple palace of
Medeenet-Haboo leisurely, and after lunch make an excursion
to one of the most interesting private tombs, No. 35, and to the
" Dayr-el-Medeenet," situated on a hill behind the Memnonium
