To make this tour, a fortnight would have to be added to a Palestine
tour which would include Damascus.

TOURS TO PALMYRA
Can be made from Damascus in twelve days for the double journey, but
Palmyra is under the power of rapacious sheikhs, and great care has to be
observed in arranging for a tour to that city of grand nuns.

TWELF'Iâ€˜H ITINERARY.
Tour to the Great Desert and Palestine.

We conclude the series of Itineraries by indicating the general route
from Egypt to Sinai, Petra, Mount Hor, and Palestine.

F orty da s are required for the journey from Cairo to Sinai, Petra, and
by Mount or to Hebron and Jerusalem. We have not at command the
details of the tours made through the Desert by parties travelling under our
arrangements in the last two seasons. One of these parties was headed by
Dr. Strong, of Drew Seminary, and consisted of ten or eleven energetic
and enthusiastic explorers. The party had with them a photographer, who
took home a tine collection of photographs, which were exhibited in the
Photographic Hall of the Centennial Exhibition. An extensive map has
also been prepared by two gentlemen of the party, and other educational
results of their great tours maybe antici ated. Without attempting to
define the course of these and other travellers for whom we have had the

honour to arrange, we may say here briefly that we can take engagements
mm.
