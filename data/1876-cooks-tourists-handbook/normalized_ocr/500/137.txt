ENVIRONS OF CAIRO. 123

affording pleasing scenery. The last part of the drive is
amongst broad meadows and .corn-fields, where flocks of
the white ibis are seen hovering.

The busy military station of Abbaseeyah, where Abbas
Pasha hid himself in constant dread of assassination; and the
plain where Selim extinguished the Memlook dynasty in
I 517, and where also Kleber defeated the Turks in 1800,
are passed on the way; also the so-called Virgin's Tree,
a sycamore, under which it is said the Holy F amily rested.'

This is really a magnificent tree, in itself worth the
excursion from Cairo to see. It is railed round to preserve
it from the hacking and carving of visitors. As a compromise,
a knife is kept and lent to any who burn to cut their names
somewhere, so that it may be done on the palings.

The village of Matareeah marks the site of the gar-
dens to which Cleopatra transplanted the balsams of Judea,
which produced the celebrated Balm of Gilead. These gar-
dens were long famous for this precious drug.

Here also is the Miraculous Fountain, which is
alleged once to have been salt, but has been soft and excel-
lent ever since the Virgin M ary bathed her infant in its waters.

At a short distance from Matareeah is all that is left of
Heliopolis.

"In Heliopolis, the Oxford of Old Egypt, stood the
great Temple of the Sun. Here the beautiful and the wise
studied love and logic 4000 years ago. Here Joseph was
married to the fair Asenath. Here Plato and Herodotus
pursued philosophy and history 3 and here the darkness that
veiled the great sacrifice on Calvary was observed by the
heathen astronomer, Dionysius the Areopagite."

. This Coptic miraculous tree is repudiated by the Roman Catholic
Peres Cordeliers, who say that the real tree died in 1656, and that they
have its last fragments in their convent at Cairo.
