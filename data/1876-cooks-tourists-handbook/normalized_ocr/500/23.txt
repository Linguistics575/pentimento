HOTEL COUPONS are issued not only for the countries
passed through in reaching the East, but in the East also, and
at such a rate as to ensure economy with every comfort.

The advantages of taking Hotel Coupons may be briefly
summed up as follows C---

1. Time, expense, annoyance in bartering, and ultimate
dissatisfaction, are saved by going to a well-recommended
Hotel.

11. It is a great drawback to pleasure to arrive in a Foreign
town beset by porters and commissionaires and rabble, a perfect
stranger, and without any definite idea where to go.

III. Letters from home, or telegrams, may be found upon
arrival at the Hotel, thus saving trouble or expense in Sending

IV. The charges are all fixed, thus obviating the chance of
imposition, and the disagreeable task of .having to drive a

accommodation at one uniform rate, the tourist is enabled to
count the cost of his tour before starting.

letter or telegraph, are always provided for even in the busiest
seasons if they inform the hotel-keeper that they have coupons.
