280 THE DESERT.

whilst in every direction shepherds and herdsmen are seen
watching their flocks and herds, to keep them from straying
beyond the landmarks on to other fields.

On the second day after leaving Kadesh, the Hill
Country of Judah is entered, and the ancient pass leading
towards Hebron is ascended. To the right lies the Dead
Sea. but too much in the hollow to be seen, - to the left is
the region between Beersheba and Hebron. Hills are seen
terraced to the summit, and wherever the rocks admit, crops
are seen growing, or husbandmen preparing the soil. The
plough is just such an instrument as was used thirty cen-
turies ago-two pieces of wood with an iron point, mostly
drawn by oxen, sometimes by a camel.

The traveller is now in the region in which David was
hunted by Saul; it is full of large caves, in many of which
the former may have hidden from the jealous king. The
route passes near Tell'Arad, which marks the site mentioned
in Josh. xii. 14 as a royal city of the Canaanites 5 also alluded
to in Num. xxi. I and xxxiii. 40, where "King Arad the
Canaanite "should read "the Canaanite King of Arad."

Kurmel is the ancient Carmel, mentioned in Josh.
xv. 55. Here Nabal dwelt and sheared his sheep, and
churlishly repulsed the messengers of David, and from
hence David took his favourite wife, "Abigail the Car-
melitess" (see I Sam. xxv.) In I Sam. xv. 12 we read of
Carmel in connection with Saul's return from the slaughter
of the Amalekites. Here were situated the vineyards of
King Uzziah (2 Chron. xxvi. 10). When Eusebius wrote
there was a Roman garrison in this town. The extensive
ruins now seen are entirely of mediaeval origin.

"The whole scene," says a recent traveller, "exactly
corresponds with the narrative. It is situated among rocky
hills fitted only for sheep pastures, and still used as such.
