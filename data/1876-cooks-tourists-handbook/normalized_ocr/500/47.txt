NATURAL PRODUCTIONS. 33

corded amongst the Mosaic plagues are still most unplea-
santly numerous in the Egyptian land.

Amongst the trees and plants of Egypt many European
varieties flourish. Date palms, doom palms, sycamores,
tamarisks, acacias, etc., are the most noticeable. The lotus,
or water-lily of the N ile, conspicuous in the ornamentation
of the old temples and tombs, and used for making a sort of
bread now, as in the days of Herodotus, is a noticeable object
in the Delta, when the N ile is at full height. The papyrus,
from whose delicate white pith the ancients made paper, has
become scarce, and according to some extinct. There are
very doubtful rumours of its existence in some out-of-the-
way spots. *

' "The lotus and papyrus," says Dr. Samuel Manning, in his
Land of the Pharaohs, "were formerly the most common of its
products, insomuch that they formed the symbols of Upper and Lower
Egypt. The papyrus was used not only for making paper, to which it
gave its name, but for the construction of boats, baskets, and innu-

g rows abundantly, even cottages were built with it. No religious
service, no state ceremonial, no domestic festival is found without the
lotus-flower. It forms part of every offering to the gods. The guests
at a banquet all held one in their hands. It is, perhaps, the object of
all others most constantly represented on the monuments. Yet both
the lotus and papyrus have disappeared from Egypt. No trace of either.

it was yet foretold by the Prophet Isaiah, as a part of the Divine judge
