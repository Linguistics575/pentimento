Another group consists of the chapel court, two halls
and a staircase on the north side, and two halls and a
staircase on the south side, and the little temple on the
terraced roof, this assemblage of rooms was especially
dedicated to the feast of the New Year, regulated by the
appearance of Sirius. The details of this grand ceremonial
are pictured on the walls of the two staircases.

The remaining chambers,' those farthest to the west,
formed the most sacred portion of the edifice. Into the
small chamber at the extreme west of the axis of the build-
ing the king alone could enter; there, in profound secrecy,
was preserved the mysterious emblem of the worship of
Athor the Life-giver, the golden sistrum. The adjacent
chambers were consecrated to the worship of Isis, Osiris,
Pasht, Horus, etc. In the walls of the temple are concealed
crypts, wherein the most valuable gold statues and other
sacred treasures were stored. On the terrace, or roof of the
building, is a small temple dedicated to Osiris.

"The temple," accordingly, "was not, like our
churches, a place of assembly for the faithful. One finds
in it neither habitations for priests nor places of initiation,
and no traces of divination or the consultation of oracles,
and there is no reason to imagine that beyond the king and
priests anything like a public congregation was admitted.
The temple is a place of dep√©'t, preparation, and consecra-
tion. In the interior certain festivals are celebrated, proces-
sions organized, and the objects of worship stored. And, if
all was sombre, if in these halls and chambers, where
there is no indication of torches having been used, almost
darkness must have prevailed, the mystery of the cere-
monies was thereby only enhanced....... As to the
principal festivals, of which the temple was the centre,
they consisted chiefly of processions which expanded out..
