room to pass in single file, and sometimes a de'tour must be
made in consequence of the shore path being closed.
Myriads of curious and beautiful shells in endless variety,
and some of them very rich, lie on this wild shore.

'AKahah is an Arab village at the north east end of the
gulf. About forty soldiers keep guard in its sixteenth
century castle. It derives its importance as a station on the

'Akabah is in itself fitted to be a great place. It stands
on a convenient plain surrounding the head of the bay, at

Edom rebelled against Judah, Elath was lost for a time (2
