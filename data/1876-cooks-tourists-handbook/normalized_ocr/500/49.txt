NATURAL PRODUCTIONS. 35

slowly ascended it before the Etesian wind, we heard the.
thundering fall of some mud-bank, and saw by the rush of
all animated N ature to the spot, that the N ile had overleaped
another obstruction, and that its boundary waters were dif-
fusing life and joy through another desert. There are few
impressions I have ever received, upon the remembrance of
which I dwell with more pleasure, than that of seeing the
first burst of the N ile into one of the channels of its annual
overflow. All Nature shouts for joy. The men, the chil-
dren, the buffaloes gambol in its refreshing waters, the broad
waves sparkle with shoals of fish, and fowls of every wing
flutter over them in clouds. Nor is this jubilee of Nature
confined to the higher orders of creation. The moment the
sand becomes moistened by the approach of the fertilizing
waters, it is literally alive with insects innumerable. It is
impossible to stand beside one of these noble streams, to see
it every moment sweeping away some obstruction to its
majestic course, and widening as it flows, without feeling
the heart to expand with love and joy and confidence in the
great Author of this annual miracle of mercy."

Immediately after the inundation wheat, barley, beans,
peas, lentils, vetches, lupins, clover, flax, lettuce, hemp,
coriander, poppies, tobacco, water-melons, and cucumbers
are sown, and in about four months or less are harvested. In
the summer season artificial irrigation is used for the follow-
ing crops-doura, maize, onions, henna, sugar-cane, cotton,
coffee, indigo, and madder.

Much fruit is produced in Egypt. Besides the grapes,
which are abundant, the following are also common-dates,
pomegranates, figs, apricots, peaches, oranges, lemons,
citrons, bananas, mulberries, and olives.
