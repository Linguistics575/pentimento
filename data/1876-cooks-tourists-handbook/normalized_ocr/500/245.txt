KANTARAH. 227

"Only freslr.water shells are to be found in Lake Timsah,
and the crocodile does not live in salt water. These facts
seem to confirm the idea that a fresh-water canal had long
ago existed here, and that the town, of which there are ruins
at the end of the Bitter Lakes, may have been destroyed by
the same upheaving of the land which dried the lakes
themselves."

Leaving Lake Timsah, the heights of E1 Guisr, the
highest part of the Isthmus of Suez, are reached. A small
canal, leading to some stone quarries, is seen on the right,
and a branch connecting the Fresh Water, and Maritime
Canals is seen on the left.

The cutting of El Guisr is nine miles in length (from
Lake Timsah to Ballah). In some parts of this cutting,
especially near El Guisr, the dredging is from sixty to seventy
feet, the full perpendicular depth being over a hundred feet.
In 1859, when the Company were employing 20,000 fellahs,
or native workmen, furnished by the Viceroy, the greater
part were employed here. A narrow channel was first cut,
in order to float the steam dredges, and fill the shallow
basin of Lake Timsah. This channel took two years in
cutting, and it took five months to fill Lake Timsah with
water.

El Fendane is at the head of a string of shallow
lagoons, stretching down to the Mediterranean. The first
of these lagoons is called Lake, Ballah. The remainder of
the route, through Lakes Ballah and Menzaleh, is thirty-
eight miles.

Gunterah, or Kantarah, is on the great Syrian route
to Egypt. It stands on the ridge of sand hills separating
Lake Menzaleh from the interior lagoons. Here, formerly,
was a bridge, as the name indicates. A floating one is used
now. The desert approaches very) near to this town.
