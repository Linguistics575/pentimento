go EGYPT.

that the land which the Israelites should possess "is not as
the land of Egypt, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst
it with thy foot, but is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh
water of the rain of heaven "( Deut. xi. 10-12).

Not less interesting is it to watch the ploughing
with the quaint old plough, with which everyone is
familiar in illustrated scriptural books 5 and not infrequently
it is drawn by camel and buffalo,, "unequally yoked" to-
gether.

Tantah is a large town, boasting the finest station passed
on the journey. Branch lines run from this place to Dessook
(pp. 37, It), 46.1, miles, to Shebeen-el-Kom, 18% miles, to
Damietta, by Talka (near Mansoorah), 72 miles (p. 37),
and to Zifté, by Mahallet Rokh junction, 3 3h miles.

i Tantah is celebrated for its fétes or festivals. They are
held in January, April, and August, lasting eight days on
each occasion. These Observances are in honour of the
Seyyid Ahmed-el-Bedawee, a Muslim saint, invested with
divine power, to whom an invocation in the midst of impend-
ing accident or catastrophe is guaranteed to bring strength to
the faithful. These fétes, which are attended by two or
three hundred thousand people, are the most interesting to be
seen in Egypt. Every phase of Egyptian life may be seen
here, and the revelries are enjoyed by all classes of society,
from the Khédive, who has a palace here for the purpose,
down to the poorest fellah.

At Birket-es-Sah the Damietta branch of the Nile is
crossed by another handsome new bridge. The palace of
Abbas Pasha is seen, and then Benha is reached (p. 2 36).
This is a junction for either Mansoorah or Ismailia, both vid
Zagazig. Benha is a decayed town, once noted for its honey,
afterwards, for a time, an important seat of the cotton trade.
Close at hand are the ruins of Athritis, of Greek, Roman,
