terraces, now mostly broken, and ruins of ancient aquedacts
and edifices are seen.

The Sik, or Cleft, which forms the entrance to Petra, is
reached somewhat suddenly. It is a narrow ravine, with
rocks of red sandstone, from one hundred to three hundred
feet in height, rising perpendicularly on each side. Anarrow
line ofsky is mostly seen between, but at places the passage is
completely overarched. The Arab tradition asserts that this
was the cleft caused by the stroke of Moses' rod when the
Israelites were miraculously supplied at Kadesh.

Dean Stanley identifies Petra with Kadesh Barnea.

Near the entrance to the Sik are two temples with large

ported an aqueduct. Yew trees and creeping vines in
festoons clothe the recesses of the rocks. Along the cleft
Bows a stream, and here and there fragments of the old
Roman toad are perceptible. Niches, once filled with
statues, are seen on either side; and whenever a widening
of the "gives space, ruins of temples can be observed.
For a mile and a half the traveller journeys through this

called the Wédy Moosa.

In the Wédy Moosa, just opposite the Sik, stands the
edifice called by the Arabs El Khuzneh Faraon, or
Treasury of Pharaoh. It is a temple or sepulchre, cat in
the rock, with a faqade of two stories. The lower story
