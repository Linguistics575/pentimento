SINAI TO'AKABAH. 267

left. Ragged garments presented by the Arabs as offerings
hang from the wooden rack above the grave. A three days'
festival is held here annually. The palm embowered fours
tain of Win Suweirah is a captal halting place for re-
freshment. Crossing some rough hills, the watershed be-
tween the two gulfs of'Akabah and Suez is reached.

The Fer'a range is entered by the Waidy Sa'Ã©l. This is

end nestles the little green oasis. On the summit of a
mountain in the distance is seen a mass of rock which is
considered to bear a striking resemblance to the Capitol at
Washington.

Hitherto the traveller has pretty closely followed the
