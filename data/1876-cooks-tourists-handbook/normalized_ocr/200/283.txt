SINAI TO SUEZ. 265

to consider a visit to those places undesirable, choose either
of two modes of reaching Syria which still remain open to
him. The journey by Petra should not be persisted in unless
intelligence is received from'Akabah that all is well. From
Mount Sinai, Hebron can be reached via Nahkl in eleven days,
but the route is very uninteresting to most, and it is far pre-
ferable to return to Suez, proceed by the canal to Port Said,
and then take the steamer to Jaffa. (See Cook's Tourisls'
Handbook to Palestine and Syria.)

In returning from Sinai to Suez a variation is made in
the route, which will now be briefly described.

Crossing the plain of Er Rahéh, a parting view is taken of
the Sinai group and its surroundings, and then by the Wtidy
Aboo Seileh, the Nugb Hawa is reached, and the Wfdy
Soleif as in coming. From the head of this valley the
traveller passes by the Waidy Soleif into the Wédy-esh-
Sheykh, along which poured the hosts of Israel in their
march to Sinai. The Wtidy Soleif then conducts to the
plain of Erweis-el-Erheirig. A narrow gorge between
two gigantic cliffs of red grapite conducts to the Wédy
Berrah, with Sinaitie inscriptions on the rock called Hajar-
el-Laghweh. The road next crosses a plain with some signs
of vegetation, and then passes into the broad Wédy
Labweh, in which is seen a cleft in the rock with a spring
of water, called Shageek-e1-'Ajooz. The Wédy Bark is
long and broad, enclosed by steep rocks of gneiss; a group
of the hive.like stone houses already described are seen soon
after entering the valley, and subsequently some rude attempts
at fortification erected by the Arabs against the soldiers of
Mahomed Ali. The plain of Debébat Sheykh Ahmed
is so named from the tomb of a sheykh beside the road; other
tombs and more of the hive houses (called mawdmees) are
seen in the vicinity.
