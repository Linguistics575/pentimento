domestic animals. The hippopotamus, once the most re-
markable of Egyptian animals, is now only seen in the
more southern districts of the Nile, in which locality the
giraffe is also occasionally met with.

one kind often measures as much as 15 feet across the
wings. Eagles, falcons, hawks, buzzards, kites, cmws, larks,

abound.

for their venomous properties.

Fish are plentiful in the Nile and in the Egyptian lakes,

Locusts still, as of old, make themselves a dreadful
calamity at occasional seasons, and some of the insects re-
