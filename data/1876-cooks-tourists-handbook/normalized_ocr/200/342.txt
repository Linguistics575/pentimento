NILE TOURS TO THE FIRST, SECOND MT1ll1ilT8.

Our reference to these tours in connection with this series of itineraries
will be very brief. For eight years the agency for Nile toms has been
committed to us by the Khedivie Administration. During that time con-
slant improvements have been made in the service; steamers have been
fitted with deck s-loons, and the sleepi berths greatly improved.
The food supplies have been under our contra to a great extent, and will be
emphatically so in the future, nswe intend to exercise more rigid regulations
for the interest and comfort of voyagers. Contractors, dragomans, and
servants of every grade will be most vigilantly watched and rigidly dealt
with if any incivihty ar inattention is shown to passengers. Last seasou's
extension of arrangements for the Second Cataract will be improved, and
we huge ere long to see a class of steamers on the Nile that will ensure I
large nssenger ttMic.

The servxce of steamers commences in November, and Nile trips my
precede or follow tours to Palestine as most convenient to the travellers who
wish to embrace the two objects in one visit to the East. The trips to the
First Cataract and, back occupy twenty days, and fifteen more are allowed
for trips to the Second Cataract

DAHABEAHS can also be secured on the best terms for all who desire
them, and dragomms and other necessary servants and food supplies can be
manged by us on the best terms. On: office at Cairo, on the grounds of
Shepheard s Hotel, affords excellent facilities for the management of this

t men.
