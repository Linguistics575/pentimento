abruptly in a frowning headland as if the sea was surging at
its feet. There mast have been pyramids and sphinxes here
long before Egypt was ever heard of-the builders, the
storms of the desert; the materials with which they were
wrought, the mountain masses of limestone rock which have
been detached from the main body and formed into almost
every conceivable shape."

Nukhl is thirty hours' journey farther, where the terri-
tory of the Tawarah Arabs terminates. Here Tiyéhah Arabs
are in possession, and the traveller must change his escort,
unless no Tiykhahs are forthcoming. In that case the
Tawarah go forward.

EP Abdeh, forty-five hours from Nukhl, is the next

Whdy Ruhaibeh, five hours. Wells are found here.
Some neighbouring ruins are thought to be the possible site
of Rehoboth (Gen. xxvi. sa).

From this Wédy, Gaza (Ghuzzeh) (see p. 282) can be
reached in thirteen hours.

Khulassah is near the site of ancient Elusa, mentioned
by Ptolemy, a large city where Venus was the tutelary god-

"seven ewe lambs" set apart on that occasion. The two

They are about a hundred yards apart on the northern bank
of the Wiidy-es-Sebis. The larger of these wells is 12%
feet in diameter, and when Dr. Robinson visited it, it was
44l feet to the surface of the water. The surrounding
