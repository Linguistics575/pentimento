THOMAS COOK & SON

HAVE been enabled to secure the services of Mr. FLOYD, and in one of
those seasons of unusual difficulty, occasioned by snow storms in the'
Lebanon, his services were appreciated at the highest value by a party of
nearly thirty, amongst whom were many distinguished travellers, both
American and English. Mr. FLOYD is now engaged to superintend the
business of THOMAS Cook & Son in Palestine and Syria, to engage the
best Dragomans of the country, and to travel with us many parties as possible.

New and important arran emean have been made with the proprietor
of the Jerusalem Hotel at a a to accommodate our travellers, and to place
at our disposal all availab e carriages between Jaffa and Jerusalem. For
excess of numbers horses will continue to be provided for the best riders,
and the aim will be to complete the journey between the port and the Holy
City in tt day. With a view to the probability of effecting such a desirable
arrangement, THOMAS Cook & SON last year purchased a la e and con-
venient house outside the walls of Jerusalem, which may be u as a Dep√©t
for tent equipments and stores, and a centre of organizations for travelling
thro h the country.

ese new itineraries will be worked out under the supervision of Mr.
F LOYD, who has been engaged as the Palestine representative of THOMAS
COOK & SON, and who will have the selection of the best dragomans that
can be found in the country, such dragomans being under his control.

Parties in any numbers can select any of the following itineraries, and
travel quite independent of any other parties, having their own dragomans
and camp servants.

The scale of charges will be regulated by the numbers, from two to ten
persons. ten and upwards being the numbers for which the lowest uniform
charges are made. Quotations of fares will be given when the numbers are
made up and the routes to and through Palestine are determined upon. We
can furnish tickets to travel by any line of Atlantic and Mediterranean
Steamers, and by any route over the European Continent, and it will he
to the interest of travellers to take through tickets from America, England,
or elsewhere, to Palestine and back,
