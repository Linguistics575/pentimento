28 INTRODUCTORY.

SEVENTH DAY.

Arrive at Wtidymalfa (46 miles from Aboo-Simbel, and
about 210 miles from Philze), the terminal point of the voyage.
The Second Cataract is 7 or 8 miles further south, and consists
of rapids, which, extending for about 5 miles, thoroughly impede
the navigation of the river; indeed, for nearly 100 miles the
bed of the river is a succession of sunken rocks. A good view
of the Second Cataract and the surrounding country is obtained
by ascending the cliff called Aboo-Seer, and to afford the oppor-
tunity of doing so the steamer remains at Mrddy-HaVa a whole
day before returning.

EIGHTH DAY.
The excursion to Aboo-Seer is better made very early in the
morning, as it is quite two hours' ride on the opposite bank of

the river, where donkeys have already been passed by ferry-boat
in readiness.

NINTH, TENTH, AND ELEVENTH DAYS.
Make the return journey, which is continued without stop-
pages of importance.

Arrive at Phila, in the evening of the eleventh day, or in the
morning of the twelfth.

TWELFTH DAY.

Visit to the Cataract in a boat, and the remaining two days
to bespent at leisure, until we effect our change on the down
river steamer at Assauan, and continue to Cairo as per First
Cataract itinerary.
