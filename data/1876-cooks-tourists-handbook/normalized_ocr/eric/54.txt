4o EGYPT.

with label, a practice of high antiquity in Egypt, as proved by
implements found in the tombs.

A well-to-do Egyptian keeps a sackcka, or water-carrier,
who takes rank as Upper servant, and attends the ladies in
their walks or drives 5 a mix, or groom, who not only attends
to the stables, but also runs before or beside his master's
carriage; a bow'u-ab, or porter, reSponsible for the street-
door, and always there 5 and the several black slaves for
various duties as required.

Egyptians rise early, and take a cup of coffee and a pipe,
breakfasting at noon on bread, eggs, butter, cheese, stewed
beans, clouted cream, etc. Dinner is usually a private meal,
taken in the harem. The chief meal of the day is supper,
and is the meal at which guests are usually received. Wash-
ing of hands and saying of grace always precedes and follows
a meal. The food is usually eaten with the fingers, and it
is a great mark of civility and kindness for a host to pick
out a nice morsel and put it in a guest's mouth.

"The manner of eating with the fingers, as practised in
Egypt and many other Eastern countries," says Mr. Lane,
"is more delicate than may be imagined by Europeans who
have not witnessed it, or heard it correctly described. Each
person breaks off a small piece of bread, dips it in the dish,
and then conveys it to his mouth, together with a small por-
tion of the meat or other contents of the dish. The piece
of bread is generally doubled together, so as to enclose the
morsel of meat, etc., and only the thumb and first and
second fingers are commonly used."

Courteousness and hospitality are common in Egypt.
Free converse ensues at once on chance meetings with
strangers. The pipe which a person is smoking is offered
as a matter-of-course act of politeness, and even the shop-
keeper taking a meal will ask his customer to partake.
