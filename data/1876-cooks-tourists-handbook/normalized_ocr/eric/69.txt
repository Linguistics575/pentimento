The land of Egypt is of course rendered specially memo-
rable to every believer in the inspired volume, as being the
scene of the captivity of the Israelites, and the events con-
nected therewith, as detailed in the last fourteen chapters of
the Book of Exodus; also of that marvellous deliverance,
accompanied by miracles, set forth in the first fourteen chap-
ters of the Book of Exodus. A portion of the New Testa-

Egypt the Holy Family fled from the wrath of Herod (Matt.
ii. 13--20).

The earliest scriptural event recorded in connection with
Egypt is the journey of Abraham to that country'at the

The wonderful history of Joseph commences in Gen.
xxxvii. The events of the next 500 years need no recount-

land, the settlement of the Israelites in Goshen, and the
change in their treatment under the new dynasty that knew
not Joseph, and their escape from cruel thraldom by a series
of miracles--all this is of course familiar to every traveller
in Egypt, and the Bible itself will be the best handbook
from which to refresh his memory on these important
historical associations..

Between the Egyptians and Jews a frequent intercourse
seems to have been maintained. In Deut. xxiii. 7 the
Israelites were told, "Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian.
