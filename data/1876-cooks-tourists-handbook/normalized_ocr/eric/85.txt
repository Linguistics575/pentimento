ALEXANDRIA. 7 r

Cleopatra's NeedleS.------These are two obelisks of
red granite, one standing erect, and the other lying prostrate,
almost buried in earth and rubbish. The upright column is
seventy-one feet high; on one side the hieroglyphics are
almost worn out, on the other side they are sharp and dis-
tinct. These columns bear the names of Thothmes III.,
Rameses II., and Sethi II. The first of these monarchs, in
whose reign the stone for these immense'obelisks was
quarried, reigned over Egypt in 149 5 3.0.; so that in gazing
at these memorials, we are taken back through nearly thirty-
four centuries of the world's history. They originally stood
in front of the Temple of Neptune at Heliopolis, and were
subsequently removed to the Caesarium at Alexandria; but
whether by Cle0patra, whose name they bear, or at a later
date, is uncertain. The fallen column was offered as a gift
to the English nation by Mahomed Ali, but it appears never
to have been deemed worth the cost of removal, and it is
now so worn and dilapidated that its transmission to En gland
is less probable than ever it was.

On the banks of the Mahmoodeah Canal are the
residences of some of the grandees of Alexandria--large,
cool houses, standing in parched and dusty grounds. This
canal was formed by Mahomed Ali in 1819--20. A quarter
of a million of men were forced to aid in its construction,
and there was an awful sacrifice of human life by sickness
and privation before it was completed. It is cut from
Alexandria to Atfeh, on the Rosetta branch of the Nile.
On the right bank, near Alexandria, is the fashionable pro-
menade of the city. Close at hand are the beautiful gardens
of the Viceroy, which are open to the public. A band plays
on Sundays and Fridays. Here streams of water flow,
and everything looks beautifully fresh, green, and novel.
The visitor is surrounded by many kinds of trees--orange,
