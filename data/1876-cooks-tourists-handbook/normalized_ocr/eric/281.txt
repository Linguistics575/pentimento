MOUNT SINAI. 263

The scene, as far as the eye can reach, is wild and desolate-
an assemblage of innumerable mountain peaks, with no
place in sight where Israel could have stood to witness the
awful scenes that took place on Sinai. But at the same
time it' is not improbable that Jebel Moosa is the portion
of the mountain where Moses was alone with God.
Descending from the summit of Jebel Moosa to the
spring of Elijah (p. 262), a start may thence be made for the
