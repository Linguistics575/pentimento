102 EGYPT.

CENTRAL HALL.

This Hall contains a wonderful collection of objects con-
nected with the religion, funeral ceremonies, civil life, and
history of ancient Egypt.

From 105 to 338, and several cases of small unnumbered
objects, furnish a very fine collection of divinities, religious
emblems, and other curiosities appertaining to the religion of
ancient Egypt. Osiris, principal deity in the Egyptian Pan-
theon, with his sisters Isis and Nephthys 5 the Bull god,
Apis; Typhon, apparently the Satan of the system; Horus,
or Horpocrates, as the Greeks called him; Anubis, with the
jackal's head; ibis-headed Thoth, and many other gods and
goddesses too numerous to mention, may be seen in this por-
tion of the Museum in ceaseless repetition.
