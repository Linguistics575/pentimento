grass clothes the surface of the ground. There are many
Springs, perennial but warm, and in some cases sulphurous, in
this Oasis.

The chief ruins are about seven miles from the capital,
E1 Khérgeh, and are rendered picturesque by their surround-
ings of wood and water. Scattered remains of broken
columns, once forming an avenue, lead up to the Great
Temple, dedicated to Amun-ra. Hieroglyphics and colossal
figures profusely adorn the fagade; a doorway, with fine
sculptures, leads to the grand columned hall, sixty feet by fifty-

decorated with carvings.

There are three interesting gateways near by. On one
Darius is shown adoring Amun--ra, Osiris, and Isis; on
another an edict of Galba is inscribed. There are about two
hundred tombs in the adjacent necropolis of very obscure
origin, Christian and Egyptian symbols are both plentiful.

The inhabitants of the Oases are very bigoted Maho-
medans; amongst them are found the fanatical sect who
wish to roll back the tide of progress, abolish all the
Frankish ideas and customs, which have lately gained ground
in Egypt, and make Islam once more an intolerant foe to
every belief except its own.

forms a gate, or weir, across the two branches of the Nile,
just above their junction, measuring about 600 yards across
the Damietta branch and 500 across the Rosetta branch;
