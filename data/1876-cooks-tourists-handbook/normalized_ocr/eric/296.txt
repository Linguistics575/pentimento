they returned with grapes of Eshcol, and other proofs of
abundant plenty, but also with tales of terrible warriors and
giants. Israel murmured, and at this place received the sen-

unto the hill-top," to force their entrance into Canaan,
"and the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which
dwelt in that hill, and smote them." And no wonder,
