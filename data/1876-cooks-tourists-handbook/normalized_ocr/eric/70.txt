56 EGYPT.

because thou wast a stranger in his land." From I Kings
iii. 1, we learn that "Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh,
King of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought
her into the city of David." Solomon also received assist-
ance from the same monarch in subduing the Canaanites
(1 Kings ix. 16). There is reason to believe thatintermarriage
with the Egyptians was permitted to the Israelites.

Shishak, or Sheshonk, of the twenty-second dynasty
(reigning in Bubastis) sheltered Jeroboam, and also invaded
Judah, taking from Jerusalem the treasures and shields of
gold (1 Kings xiv. 25, 26).

Egypt is in several passages alluded to as a source from
which were introduced idolatrous practices into Israel, also as
a power upon which'the Jews often sinfully depended for aid
instead of only trusting in Divine protection. See especially
the denunciation of Jeremiah against the rebellious band who
followed Johanan, the son of Kareah. "The sword which
you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt,
and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow close
after you there in Egypt, and there shall ye die "( Jer. xlii.,
xliii.) Not long after Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt and.
slew all the Jews who had taken refuge there without dis-
tinction as to age or sex.

The death of King Josiah, when fighting with Pharaoh-
Necho, at Megiddo, 1s narrated 1n 2 Kings xxiii.

The prophecies concerning Egypt in the pages of Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc., are very numerous. The following
may be specially noted z--Isaiah xix., xx., xlv. 14-, Jere-
miah xliii. 8--13, xliv. 3o, xlvi., Ezekiel xxix .--xxxii
Joel iii. 19, Zech. x.., xi. In many particulars, as regards
the actual condition of the country, and the remains of past
greatness, the intelligent traveller cannot fail to see how
much is literally fulfilled.
