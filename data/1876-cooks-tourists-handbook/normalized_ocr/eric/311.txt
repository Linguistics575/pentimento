HOTEL ACCOMMODATION COUPONS,

ORIGINATED AND ISSUED BY

THOMAS COOK AND SON.



THE HOTEL COUPON business, which was commenced as a friendly
arrangement of mutual interest to ourselves, to Hotel Proprietors, and
Tourists, has far exceeded our most sanguine anticipations; and as its
benefits become better known, they will be more highly appreciated by all
who are interested in the success of the scheme.

The European Hotel Coupons are issued at the uniform rate of 85. per
day, and are arranged as follows: Ist Coupon (yellow )---- Breakfast,
specifying of what it shall consist. 2nd Coupon (red )--Dz'mzer at Ta√©le

The Coupons are accepted at full value at one principal Hotel in
