mended; beef is seldom so good as mutton. The fish of the
Nile are very poor, the bultz'lz and the c/zz's/zer are the best.
Healthy persons can sometimes bathe in the Nile morning
or evening; crocodiles below Manfaloot being never to be feared,

At midnight it is very cold, and one must arrange accordingly.
Fever seldom appears, except in Alexandria, and other places

remedies. It is always well in the East to protect the neck and
head with a good broad-brimmed hat, and flowing puggerie, as
sunstrokes are not uncommon.

OPHTHALMIA is exceedingly prevalent in Egypt. Some
consider that it is produced by the fine dust-sand wafted from
