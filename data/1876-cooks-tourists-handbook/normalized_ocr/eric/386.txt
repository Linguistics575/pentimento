CAUTION-Ã©-The extraordinary medical reports on the efficacy of Chlorodyne
render it of vital impo'ance that the ublic should obtain the genuine, which
bears the words "Dr. J. Collie Browne's hlorodyne."

Vice-Chancellor Woon stated that Dr. J. Come Baowsn was undoubtedly the

Lord Chancellor Selborne and Lord Justice James stated that the defendant had
made a deliberate misrepresentation of the decision of Vice-Chancellor Wood.

Chemists throughout the land confirm this decision that'Dr. J. C. BBOWNE
was the Inventorpf CELOBODYN Ill.--'
