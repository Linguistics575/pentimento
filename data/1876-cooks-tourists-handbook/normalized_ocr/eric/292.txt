2 74 THE DESERT.

in voluptuousness, none remain; all lie in a promiscuous
heap of ruins. There are one or two public edifices suffi-
ciently preserved to show what they were. The Triumphal
Arch, the abutments of which stand in the heart of the
place. Not far from it the so-called Palace of Pharaoh,
about one hundred feet square, with broken columns in front,
and having in the interior a vestibule and one principal
chamber, with an elevation for a throne. Some good
sculpture, and fragments of stucco work, can be seen on the
cornices, and about the walls. To the south of this stands
a lone pillar, and beyond this pillar, on the crown of a conical
hill, is what is supposed to have been the Acropolis. Still

are rude blocks in an unfinished condition. Inside is a
large room, forty-five feet square, with a raised altar niche,
and a cross on the wall. The edifice was no doubt utilized
as a Christian church at a later period, whence its present
name. On the rocks opposite E1 Deir are traces of a very

In 2 Kings xiv. 7 it is called Selah, also in Isaiah xvi. I.
The original inhabitants of the city were Horites--cave-
dwellers. The Edomites were also so called, and the whole
