35 EGYPT.

POPULATION.

The p0pulation of Egypt consists chiefly of Arabs, Copts,
Turks, and Levantines. The Arabs are the descendants of
the followers of Amer in 64.0, or of those who crowded into
Egypt after the conquest, attracted by the beauty and fertility
of the land. To a large extent a rapid fusion took place
between the new element and the indigenous p0pulation.
But the Arab element has maintained its ascendancy. The
Arabs of the cities, by the constant admixture of their race
with Abyssinian slaves and their ad0ption of a settled life,
have lost most of their primitive characteristics. The Arabs
of the villages, or fillalzs, are also a mixed race; but the no-
made Arabs of the wilderness outside the Nile valley, number-
ing about 400,000, are still true children of the desert.

The Copts (who, according to some, derive their name
from a corruption of the Greek Aiguptios, and according to
others from ancient Coptos, now Kobt, p. 158), are now the
sole distinct representatives of the ancient race that built the
Pyramids and the other glories of Egypt. They are Chris-
tians, and by guarding their faith in the hostile presence of
M ahomedanism they have doubtless preServed their race and
name. They are largely found among the clerks, etc., in
mercantile and public offices.

The Turks have never been numerous in Egypt. They
number about 12,000 5 they despise the other elements of the
population, by whom they are detested in return.

The Levantines are a mixture of Syrians, Armenians,
Greeks. etc., chiefly engaged as merchants and bankers.
There are about 7000 Jews in Egypt, and about 10,000
settled Europeans, called Franks.

The total population of Egypt in 1871, according to
Regny, was 5,203,405.
