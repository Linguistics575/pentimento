PASSAGE OF THE RED SEA. 249

SUEZ TO MOUNT.SINA|.

Suez (see p. 219).

The route forward lies round the head of the gulf, and
across the Great Canal (p. 22 3). The camp is generally fixed
for the first night at Ain Moosa, or the Wells of
Moses, so called from the Arab tradition that here Moses
refreshed the Israelites after the passage of the Red Sea. It
is an oasis on an elevated spot in the desert, consisting of
seven gardens or groves, chiefly date-palm and tamarisk,
created by twelve fountains of brackish water. Indeed,
water is found anywhere in this spot by digging a few feet.
There are two hotels here.

The Passage of the Red Sea by the Children of
Israel was probably within. sight of this spot. Opinions
vary, however, on this point. Three localities are specially'
argued for by different scholars.

I. Between Att√©kah on the western shore, and a tongue
of land opposite on the east shore; the Israelitish host
turned aside by Divine command from the head of the gulf,
descended the Wzidy Twarik, when, being shut in by moun-
tains on either hand, the sea in front, and the Egyptian army
in the rear, a passage was miraculously opened to the farther
shore. Arab tradition favours this site. But the passage in
this case would be twelve miles from shore to shore, and it
is difficult to reconcile the events recorded with so long a
journey across.

2. A point near Suez.

3. A point above Suez. This latter hypothesis is based on
the idea that the Gulf once extended to the Bitter Lakes-
possibly even to Lake Timsah (p. 225).

Either of the last two seem probable. But whatever
theory be adopted, the visitor to Ain Moosa can survey the
