SPEOS ARTEMIDOS. 143

the familiar every-day life of men who walked the land
before the days of Joseph. In these mansions of the dead-eternal abodes, Euwwovs o'lxovs as the ancients called them--mimic men and women are wrestling, fishing, ploughing,
and reaping, trapping birds, giving dinner-parties, being
flogged, cutting their toe-nails, treading the wine-press,
dancing, -playing the harp, weaving linen, playing at catch
ball, being shaved by the barber, playing at draughts.
Verily, there is nothing new under the sun. What say you
to an elderly lady robed in a dress having three Bounces.
And then there are stranger things than that! Yes, the old,
old story of human life is there, told as in a picture book.
Though seen through a gap of four thousand years the eye
moistens over it still. Here are life's festive scenes and
revels-the wine cup and the garland; and here its scenes
of sorrow-mourners are weeping over their dead. Nothing
is lacking. And so, by the mystic sympathy-that touch of
nature which links man with man-you reach out a hand
across the ages, and feel the throbbings of a humanity
kindred with your own." All persons of true taste and feeling will be disgusted by finding these precious memorials disfigured by the carving of the ignoble names of modern visitors.

In the Southern tombs the architecture more closely
resembles that of the temples, where the lotus and papyrus
have suggested shapes for column and capital.'

The Speos Artemidos lies in a valley towards the
east. It is an excavation in the rock dedicated to Pasht,
the Egyptian Diana, commenced by Thothmes III., and
carried on by Sethi, father of Rameses the Great, but never
completed. There are some interesting sculptures and
hieroglyphics.

Sheykh, Timay (E.), has catacombs and quarries, and some
slight remains of the Gisr-el-Agoos (p. 140) are seen on
