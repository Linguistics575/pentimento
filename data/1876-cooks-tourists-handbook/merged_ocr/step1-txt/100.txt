the same vicinity we read of the Egyptian town of LouiTkeshrémi, and at a later date of the Arab towns of El
Maks and El Knttaiiea. When Amer-ebn-el-As, the
victorious general of the Caliph Omar, subdued Egypt (see
_ p. p), he built on the site of his camp a city called Fostzit
(from Fostdt, a tent). The suburb of old Cairo marks the
site of F ostét and the western part of Bablioun.

In the tenth century the Fatimites, who had been ruling

Cairo became simply the capital of a Turkish province.

succeeded, as described in our chapter on the History of
Egypt, Mahomed Ali rose to power. Under that prince and
his successors Cairo has increased and flourished, and now
