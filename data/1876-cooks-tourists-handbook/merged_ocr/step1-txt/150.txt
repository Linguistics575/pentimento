make the trip in one of the Government steamers. The
saving in expense is very great. As regards time, the
, may return to Cairo in six weeks, or it may be
twelve. The steamer gets back from the First Cataract in
twenty-one days. Other advantages connected with making
the trip by steam are, that you go on at a uniform rate,
independently of wind or stream; you are never becalmed,
and there is no forced labour employed in towing the vessel
along' it is a public conveyance, and every passenger can be
as independent as he pleases, or the vessel can be chartered
for a private party by paying fifteen first-class fares; all
charges are strictly inclusive, and no bargaining is necessary;
no travelling is done by night, so that every inch of the
route can be examined; punctuality is observed in all
departures and arrivals, and there is no previous delay for
selection, contract, etc.; all the attractions of the Nile are
visited on the up journey, while the interest is fresh;
arrangements are made for the receipt of letters and telegrams; and, finally, the dullness, monotony, and dissatisfaction, of which travellers by dahabeah have so often complained, are conspicuous by their absence from the Nile
steamers.

After leaving the place of embarkation at the Kasren-Nil, the steamer soon glides past Old Cairo, and Roda and
the Nilometer (p. 121). Not far from Old Cairo, the fine
mosque of Attar-emNebbee, which is said to perpetuate the
name of Athor, the Egyptian Venus, is seen on a projecting
rock. The Pyramids of Ghizeh, Sakkérah, and Dashéor are
successively passed on the western shore. On the east, Toom
Maisara is passed, with the immense quarries from which
were taken the stone casings for the Pyramids. Looking
back, the lofty citadel of Cairo, and its white mosque,
remain conspicuous objects for a considerable distance.
