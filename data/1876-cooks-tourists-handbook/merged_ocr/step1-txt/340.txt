stoppages such a Tour ought to have forty days allotted to it, though with
hard work it might be got over in thirty days.

These Tours to the east of the Jordan would require the special rotection of the local sheikhs, and would involve costs for this protection,
varying in amount in proportion to the number of the parties. This would
have to be arranged by special contract at the time, as no fixed charges can
be satisfactorily arra ed. Mr. Floyd is as capable as any man to handle
these black-mail exactions.'
