ROUTES FROM LONDON TO THE EAST.

In connection with Palestine Tours the routes from London may be
classified under two heads, as follows _

FIRST, ROUTES OF PERSONALLY-CONDUCTED TOURS.

(r.) For long tours the usual course is to cross the English Channel by
either the Calais route (the shortest sea passage), or by Dieppe (the shortest
distance to Paris). From Paris go direct to Turin by the Mont Cenis
Tunnel, and from Turin by Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi; thence by
steamer to Corfu, and then to Alexandria; after visiting Lower Egypt or
going up the Nile, cross the land of Goshen to Ismailia, and there take
steamer on Suez Canal for Port Said, from Port Said sail to Jaffa and land
there' make the tour of the country, and re-embark on steamer at Beyrout
for Constantinople', thence to Athens, and complete the tour of the Medi,

. terranean and Adriatic by landing at Trieste; return through Italy by
Venice, Milan, and Turin, and back to Paris and Landon,

Whilst this is the general course of the conductors, many modifications,
extensions, or abridgments may be made to suit the convenience and meet
the wishes of the travellers, who may go through Italy and meet the conductor at Brindisi, or may go round by N ice, Mentone, etc., and meet the
party at any fpractical point. The route from Palestine may be varied by
going direct rom Smyrna to Athens, then to Constantinople, and up the
Danube to Vienna' or from Trieste, parties can go direct to Vienna.

From other ports of northern Italy the Alps can be crossed, so as to
return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or some other deviations
from the beaten track can be provided for if desired.

(2.) The route for short tours to Lower Egypt and two or three weeks
in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as described above, then to
Genoa, and take steamer there for Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, Naples,
and Messina. Proceed through Lower Egypt to Ismailia and Port Said,
and thence to Jaffa. Return from Jaffa or Caifa to Alexandria, and thence
to N aples, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or round by
Venice and Milan to Turin en route for Paris. This is the cheapest and
most popular route to Palestine. The whole may be covered from New
York and back for 500 dols. to 600 dols. first class, or 400 dols. to
500 dols. second class, hotels included. But this route can be modified,
extended, or abridged in many ways It can be reversed through Italy,
and other lines of steamers can be taken from French or Italian ports. In
all cases of personally-conducted tours it is necessary to define the route
the conductor will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, as
all baggage, omnibus, and other incidental charges are paid by him; but if
any leave him it is not possible to control these expenses, and the travellers.
must then take their own course and pay the extras. But tickets can be.
provided for travelling by any conceivable line of railway or steamboat.
