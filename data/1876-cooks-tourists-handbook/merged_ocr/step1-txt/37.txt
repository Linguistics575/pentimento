The captains and crews of the Nile steamers are of course
all natives, and belong to the regular navy; discipline, however,
is not very strict on board, nor have the captains, who only
speak Arabic, any authority over their passengers, which is
sometimes greatly to be regretted. They are, however, all very
modest and obliging men, and very much afraid of complaints
being rhade against them on return, for this reason, towards
the end of the Tour, they manage to get a certificate signed by
all the passengers, expressing their satisfaction. If such a
testimonial cannot be produced, or complaints are made against
them, they are fined, and part of their pay, which is already poor
enough, is withheld.

The doctors on board the steamers were formerly all natives,
but since last season, according to a decision of the Kh√©dive,
European physicians belonging to the Sanitary Staff accompany
the steamers.

Should any passenger desire to return to Cairo a day or two
sooner, he can be put down at any of the railway stations between Roda and Ghizeh; but as there is only one train a day,

he must be careful not to miss it, or he might go without bed
and food. _
