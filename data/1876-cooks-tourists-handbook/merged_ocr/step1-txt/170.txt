Keneh (395 miles from Cairo) is an important place
on the east bank of the Nile; ancient Ccenopolis occupied
the site. It has long been noted for its dates and its dancing girls, also for its manufacture of porous jugs and filtering bottles. It is interesting to watch the process of making

This temple was commenced under Ptolemy XII., its
construction was completed under Tiberius, and its decoration under N em' so that this edifice was being constructed

The ceilings are covered with the celebrated astronomical
paintings, and the next most popular representation through
