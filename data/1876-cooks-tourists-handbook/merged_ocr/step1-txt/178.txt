played in the sculptures, the magnificence of Karnak greatly
increased. Monarch after monarch whom it were needless
to name here took a pride in adding to the glory of the
Theban temples and palaces. Rameses II., of whom we
have heard at Abydus, did much memorable work here also,
as will be pointed out in describing the monuments. A few
kings of lesser note succeeded, and then Rameses m.,
builder of the temple of Medeienet-Haboo, finished the record
of Theban powers and splendour. Weak kings succeeded,.
foreign possessions slipped from their grasp; and Thebes
became merely a vassal province to the new dynasties of
Bubastis and Tanis, in the Delta. Its fall is as obscure as
its origin.

When the dynasties of Lower Egypt were terminated by
Persian conquest, the great General Cambyses marched
southward to conquer Ethiopia. Turned back from the
intended exploit by famine, and irritated by the loss in the
desert sands of 50,000 men whom he had sent to conquer
the oases, he madly wreaked his vengeance on Thebes. After burning and destroying the temples and palaces, he
plundered the tombs, and left the city in a ruined condition,
from which, however, it largely recovered. Theban commerce was utterly lost by the rapid growth of Alexandria
under the Ptolemies. These princes made some considerable
additions to the temples, etc.; in these additions the
influence of Greek art is, of course, very perceptible.

"The reign of Ptolemy Lathyrus," says the author just
quoted, "is remarkable for the rebellion of Thebes, and for
the final consummation of her ruin. It had long been falling in trade and wealth, and had lost its superiority in arms;
but its temples, like so many citadels, its obelisks, its
colossal statues, and the tombs of its great kings, yet
remained, and with them the memory of its bygone glory.
