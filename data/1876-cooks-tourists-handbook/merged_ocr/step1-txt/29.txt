STEAMBOATS AND DAHABEAHS.

DAHABEAH.

This is a private conveyance, and
you must have your own party,
or else make up one, when you
must put up with intimacy with
people who may prove very objectionable.

A select party may be formed for a
dahabeah.

Dahabeahs are private speculations
designed to make large profits.

Charges are not strictly inclu'sive.

Long, tedious, and doubtful bargains have to be made.

Travel all night, and therefore much
of the scenery is lost to the traveller.

May be, and often are, weeks
overdue, so that arrangements
for continuation of a. tour are
frustrated.

Great loss of time before embark.
ing in selection of Dahabeah,
preparing contract, etc.

You rush past all the glorious stopping places, because the great
object is to get up stream; and
you stop to visit on the return
journey, when the edge of the
interest is taken off.

Never know where you are to stop.

STEAMER.

A public conveyance, where every
one is independent, if he wishes
to be so.

So may it for a special steamer,
without greater cost, as fourteen
or fifteen first-class passengers
will charter one.

Steamers are provided by the State,
and not worked specially for
profit.
Charges are strictly inclusive.

None are necessary as all expenses
are included in the fares, which
are fixed by the KÃ©divic administration.

Only travel by day, so that every
inch of the way is seen.

Steamers are punctual.

You have only to pay the tariff and
step on board.

As you see the places going up, so
you stop and examine them when
the interest is fresh. Then you
review them in the downward
journey.

Always know where you are to
stop, so that telegrams can be
received.
