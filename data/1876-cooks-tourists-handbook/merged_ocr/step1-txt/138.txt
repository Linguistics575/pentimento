In addition to the mention of On (or Heliopolis) in
Gen. xli. 45, as being the place where Poti-pherah (whose
daughter Asenath was married to Joseph) was priest-some
other notices occur in the Scriptures. In Jer. xliii. 13, this
city is called Beth-shemesh, a term of similar meaning to
Heliopolis, City of the Sun. The passage referred to is,
"He shall break all the images of Beth-shemesh that is in
the land of Egypt, and the house of the gods of the Egyptians shall He burn with fire." In Ezek. xxx. 17, the place

for a residence to the family of Jacob on their first arrival in
Egypt.

North-east of Heliopolis are the ruins of Aboo-Kesheyd,
where are three figures cut on the granite rock-one a

xxxiii. 2).

called Ra, the City of the Sun, an appellation which its

the enclosure referred to are ruins of houses, but these are
not the remains of the ancient city. They show how in the
Christian era a Coptic settlement used the walls of the
ancient Temple as an enclosure for a new town. Heliopolis
itself has disappeared to its very foundations, but doubtless if
