BEDRESHAYN. I 36

Helwan (E.) marks the site of a Nilometer of older
date (say some) than that at Roda; some of its columns
still remain. Here also are some sulphur springs, around
which a Watering-place, frequented both by Franks and
Egyptians, has sprung up. These springs were of great
repute in ancient times. To them it is supposed King
Amenophis sent "the leprous and other careless persons,
in order to separate them from the rest of the Egyptians."
For a long period of time these springs have fallen into
disuse, but it has quite recently become the fashion for residents of Cairo to resort there. The springs have been found
especially beneficial in various forms of disease to which
residents in so hot a climate are subject. Many who suffer
from irritation of the skin and other effects of the climate
find benefit from taking a course of these baths. There is
no doubt, that from their advantageous proximity to Bedreshayn Railway Station, on the Upper Egypt line, and from
the increasing popularity of the place, great improvements
will be made in order to render the present inadequate
arrangements better suited to the requirements of residents
and visitors.

Bedreshayn (15 miles from Cairo) is a Railway
Station. Memphis (p. 125), the Serapeum (p. 128), the
Pyramids of Sakkérah (p. 128) and Dash6or (p. 126), can
now be visited whilst the steamer halts, if not previously
seen by excursion from Cairo (pp. 12 5-128). The steamers
arrive in the evening, and donkeys are sent from Cairo to
enable passengers to visit Memphis and Sakkérah early in
the morning.

Rigga (W.) is about four miles from the curious object conspicuous for some time from the steamer, and called by the
Arabs Hamm-el-Keddb, or F alse Pyramid, from the idea that
the base was a rock, instead of the whole being built up, as
