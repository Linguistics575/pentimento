Kings viii. 20). But in <span style="color: #0000FF;">B </span>Kings xiv. 22, we read that<br/>
Amaziah "built Elath and restored it to Judah." But it was<br/>
not long before "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rezin </span>king of Syria recovered Elath to<br/>
Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath" (s Kings xvi. 6).<br/>
It remained for a long period probably an outpost of the<br/>
Kings of Syria, but we do not again hear of the town till<br/>
Roman times, when it is mentioned as a frontier town of<br/>
the South. It subsequently became the seat of a Christian<br/>
Bishopric. Under Roman rule it had dwindled into insignificance, through the development of Roman commerce by<br/>
way of Suez, but it attained to some note in early Mahomedan times. All that now remains to tell of the former<br/>
importance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Akabah </span>and its environs are the picturesque<br/>
ruins of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>fortress on the rocky island of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kureiyeh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Ezion-Geber so frequently mentioned in connection<br/>
with Elath, is supposed to be represented by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ain-el-Ghudytn</span>,<br/>
about ten miles up the now dry bed of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy'Arabah</span>.<br/>
It is supposed that the Gulf <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Akabah </span>once extended considerably farther northward than at the present day. In<br/>
N umbers xxxiii. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>, 36, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ezion-geber </span>is spoken of as the last<br/>
place in which they tarried before entering the Wilderness of<br/>
Zin. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>I Kings ix. 26 we read that "King Solomon made<br/>
a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on<br/>
the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom." In chap.<br/>
xxii. 48, we read that "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish<br/>
to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not, for the ships<br/>
were broken at Ezion-geber." A visit to the place by<br/>
Solomon to start off an expedition to Ophir, manned jointly<br/>
by his own people and the people of Hiram, king of Tyre,<br/>
is recorded in 2 Chron. viii. I7, <span style="color: #0000FF;">18</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">F<br/>
