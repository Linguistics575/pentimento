<br/>
Suez, at the north-west head of the gulf of the same<br/>
name, is nearly<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>seventy miles east of Cairo. It is a walled<br/>
town on three sides, open to the sea on the north-east. The<br/>
houses are in general poorly built. There are several <span style="color: #0000FF;">kUns<br/>
</span>built round large courts, and many open spaces. There is the<br/>
usual Eastern bazaar, and some European <span style="color: #0000FF;">shops</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span>Suez has<br/>
always been of importance as a place of transit for the<br/>
merchandise and productions of the East from the Red Sea<br/>
to the Nile. The modern town of Suez only dates from the<br/>
sixteenth century, when Selim I. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Solyman </span>II. had fleets<br/>
on the Red Sea. It was preceded <span style="color: #0000FF;">anciently </span>by the cities of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsino√© </span>and Clysma. As a station on the pilgrimage route<br/>
to Mecca, and also in connection with the Overland route to<br/>
India, the town has maintained its importance, though chiefly<br/>
as a place of transit. The scarcity of water has always been<br/>
a hardship. Since the construction of the Fresh-Water Canal<br/>
this grievance has been remedied. During the progress of<br/>
the works for the Ship Canal the population rose to 14,000.<br/>
Since the completion of these works there has been a decline.<br/>
"Suez," says F. B. Zincke, "is in a state of rapid decay.<br/>
Many houses are untenanted. This has been caused by the<br/>
diversion of the traffic. What formerly passed through the<br/>
town <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>passes by it on the Canal." Still, the important<br/>
position of the place <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>always insure a certain amount of<br/>
life and prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
It is a capital place at which to observe the two great<br/>
tides of life flowing from England to India, and from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indus<br/>
</span>to England.<br/>

"<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>mail train to-day," says J. MacGregor, "has filled<br/>
all the corridors of our hotel with passengers straight from<br/>
England, the faces of many blooming with youth, and others<br/>
freshened up for another spell of service by a year's leave at<br/>
home. Their talk is of the latest London news and the<br/>
