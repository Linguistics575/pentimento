On this occasion, 450 of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>, with their<br/>
leader, Ibrahim Bey, were killed in the Citadel, and nearly<br/>
800 more in the city.<br/>
<br/>
The Citadel is built in three portions, each having its<br/>
walls and towers. The fortifications were commenced by<br/>
Saladin in I 166, the materials being brought from some small<br/>
demolished Pyramids at Ghizeh. This prince also built a<br/>
Mosque and a Palace here, which were, however, destroyed<br/>
by an explosion of gunpowder in 1823. New ones were<br/>
erected by Mahomed Ali.<br/>
<br/>
The Palace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive </span>presents nothing worthy<br/>
of admiration on the outside. Inside there are some handsome rooms, with good views from the windows. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Much </span>of<br/>
the ornamentation is in very questionable taste. This Palace<br/>
is now used for State Receptions. The administrative<br/>
Government offices have been removed to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of Mahomed Ali was built in 1829,<br/>
after the Constantinopolitan model; so that, although of<br/>
very costly materials, it is less interesting than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saracenit<br/>
</span>Mosques of Cairo. Its ceiling is a vast cupola, surrounded<br/>
by four demi-cupolas, and four small domes at the corners.<br/>
There are two elongated minarets, a spacious court, and<br/>
pretty Cloister. The whole of the interior is lined with<br/>
Oriental alabaster, except the upper part of the columns, which<br/>
are painted to imitate that material. The decorations of the<br/>
interior are not in first-rate <span style="color: #0000FF;">taste</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the lanterns and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lustres<br/>
</span>have a tawdry effect.<br/>
