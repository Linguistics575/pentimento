"the great dragon that lieth in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jhe </span>midst of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>rivers"<br/>
(chap. xxix. 3). The "flood of Egypt," or annual inundation, is alluded to in Amos viii. 8, also ix. 5, and in Jer.<br/>
xlvi. <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>, 8<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Formerly, as previously mentioned, the Nile flowed to<br/>
the sea by seven mouths. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>these, five are dried up, and<br/>
the only exit now for the waters of the river is by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">artiJicially-anistructed </span>openings by Damietta and Rosetta (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">32</span>).<br/>
Most literally, then, is the prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled,<br/>
"The Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian<br/>
Sea, and with his mighty wind shall He shake his hand over<br/>
the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make<br/>
men go over <span style="color: #ff0000;">dryshod</span>."<br/>
<br/>
The land of Goshen, so often mentioned in the latter<br/>
part of Genesis and earlier chapters of Exodus, is difficult<br/>
of identification, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>probably to the eastward of the Nile<br/>
Delta. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Jews' Hills, north-east of Cairo, have<br/>
no connection with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish </span>sojourn. "These mounds,"<br/>
says Dr. Robinson, "can only be referred back to the period<br/>
of the Ptolemies, in the centuries immediately before the<br/>
Christian era," when great numbers of Jews resorted to<br/>
Egypt, and erected a temple at Leontopolis.<br/>

THE NILE <span style="color: #ff0000;">JOURN </span>EY.<br/>
<br/>
Persons to whom time and expense are no objects will<br/>
still, doubtless, prefer to make the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>trip in one of those<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabeahs</span>, so generally associated with Egyptian travel, and<br/>
about which so much has been written. Indeed, in many<br/>
books describing the Nile tour, quite as much is said about<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabeah</span>, and what happened on board it, as about the<br/>
mighty river and its renowned shores.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of tourists will, undoubtedly, prefer to<br/>
