</span>The Tomb of Tih and the Tomb of Phtah-hotep<br/>
are the two best examples for the tourist to examine, of<br/>
the ancient Empire tombs previously described.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbourhood </span>of Cairo, if time allows, several<br/>
other interesting spots may be visited besides those we have<br/>
_ described. There are the Tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>,<br/>
about a mile from Cairo, beautiful examples of Saracenic<br/>
mausoleums, now almost entirely given over to wild dogs<br/>
and outcast Arabs. The Petrified Forest is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">five<br/>
</span>miles further from the city-a desert space covered with<br/>
fragments of sycamore and palm, apparently turned to stone.<br/>
It is worth while, if it can be managed, to extend this trip<br/>
to the summit of the Mokattam Mountains, where<br/>
much more of the petrified wood will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seen</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of it<br/>
in the actual position it occupied in growing. This petrified<br/>
timber has no connection with .any living vegetation of<br/>
Egypt at the present day.<br/>
<br/>
Tourists interested in hydraulics may like to visit the<br/>
Barrage, a grand undertaking commenced by Mahomed<br/>
Ali in 1847, intended to keep back the Nile waters during<br/>
the eight months of <span style="color: #ff0000;">eblrtide </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">after </span>the inundations. It has<br/>
never been completed, and now simply obstructs navigation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">235</span>).<br/>
<br/>
It may not be uninteresting to some readers if a portion<br/>
of a letter written to the Editor were inserted here, bearing<br/>
upon the pleasures of Cairo life, and the beneficial effect of<br/>
the climate on health.<br/>
<br/>
"I <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>given up at home, or I never should have come<br/>
here. As you know, I was a martyr to almost everything,<br/>
and everybody kindly prophesied that I <span style="color: #ff0000;">should</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">go </span>off in a<br/>
rapid consumption.' But twice I spent a month here, and<br/>
twice I returned home-as I heard it whispered,'to die.'<br/>
But I am here now, for my third winter, and I have no doubt<br/>
