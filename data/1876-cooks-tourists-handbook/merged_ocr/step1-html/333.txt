THOMAS COOK & SON<br/>
<br/>
HAVE been enabled to secure the services of Mr. FLOYD, and in one of<br/>
those seasons of unusual difficulty, occasioned by snow storms in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Lebanon, his services were appreciated at the highest value by a party of<br/>
nearly thirty, amongst whom were many distinguished travellers, both<br/>
American and English. Mr. FLOYD is now engaged to superintend the<br/>
business of THOMAS <span style="color: #ff0000;">COOK </span>& <span style="color: #0000FF;">Son </span>in Palestine and Syria, to engage the<br/>
best Dragomans of the country, and to travel with us many parties as possible.<br/>
<br/>
New and important <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangements </span>have been made with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">proprietor<br/>
</span>of the Jerusalem Hotel at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>a to accommodate our travellers, and to place<br/>
at our disposal all <span style="color: #0000FF;">available </span>carriages between Jaffa and Jerusalem. For<br/>
excess of numbers horses will continue to be provided for the best riders,<br/>
and the aim will be to complete the journey between the port and the Holy<br/>
City in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>day. With a view to the probability of effecting such a desirable<br/>
arrangement, THOMAS Cook & SON last year purchased a <span style="color: #ff0000;">large </span>and convenient house outside the walls of Jerusalem, which may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">used </span>as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dep6t<br/>
</span>for tent equipments and stores, and a centre of organizations for travelling<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">through </span>the country.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>new itineraries will be worked out under the supervision of Mr.<br/>
F LOYD, who has been engaged as the Palestine representative of THOMAS<br/>
COOK & SON, and who will have the selection of the best dragomans that<br/>
can be found in the country, such dragomans being under his control.<br/>
<br/>
Parties in any numbers can select any of the following itineraries, and<br/>
travel quite independent of any other parties, having their own dragomans<br/>
and camp <span style="color: #0000FF;">servants</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The scale of charges will be regulated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>numbers, from two to ten<br/>
persons<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>ten and upwards being the numbers for which the lowest uniform<br/>
charges are made. Quotations of fares will be given when the numbers are<br/>
made up and the routes to and through Palestine are determined upon. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">F<br/>
</span>can furnish tickets to travel by any line of Atlantic and Mediterranean<br/>
Steamers, and by any route over the European Continent, and it will he<br/>
to the interest of travellers to take through tickets from America, England,<br/>
or elsewhere, to Palestine and back<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
