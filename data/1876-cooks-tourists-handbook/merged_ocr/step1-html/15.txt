PRACTICAL INFORMATION FOR TRAVELLERS.<br/>
<br/>
SEASON FOR EASTERN TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
ANY time from November to March may be selected<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>After<br/>
the early part of March the heat becomes almost unbearable,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wfdies </span>and water supplies of the Desert are generally<br/>
dried up. Travellers who are intending to visit Palestine as<br/>
well as Egypt, cannot do better than select December, January,<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">February </span>for their Nile journey, and March or April, the<br/>
most genial months of the year, for Palestine. If this is inconvenient the months of October and November are considered<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>by many travellers to be very favourable for Palestine travelling,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in which case the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>trip might be made on the return journey<br/>
<br/>
in December.<br/>
<br/>
BENEFITS OF ASSOCIATED TRAVEL.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the question of expense, travelling in the East,<br/>
either alone, or with only one or two companions, is not desirable. In Egypt, up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and through the Desert, the mode<br/>
<br/>
of life, language, and customs of the country are altogether <span style="color: #ff0000;">difI<br/>
