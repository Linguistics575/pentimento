There are Philanthropic Institutions in Cairo<br/>
which many will derive pleasure from visiting. The<br/>
American Mission and the European Hospital are both<br/>
worthy of attention. Especially attractive are Miss Whateley's Schools, where the visitor will find a goodly company<br/>
of bright, intelligent boys and girls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">able </span>to speak with ease<br/>
and fluency in English, and to show specimens of work which<br/>
an English schoolboy or school-girl would not blush to own.<br/>

Open daily, except on Fridays, from 8.0 a.m. to 5.0 <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.m.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span>"Now we can say, without fear of contradiction, the<br/>
most valuable Egyptian museum in the world is in Cairo.<br/>
That which was previously carried away, being for the most<br/>
part easily accessible, proves to belong to the later, rather<br/>
than the earlier dynasties. Unwearied digging has enabled<br/>
Mariette to reach the records of the ancient empire, and show<br/>
