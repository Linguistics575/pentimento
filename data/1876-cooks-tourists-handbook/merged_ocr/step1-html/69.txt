BIBLE ASSOCIATIONS.<br/>
<br/>
The land of Egypt is of course rendered specially memorable to every believer in the inspired volume, as being the<br/>
scene of the captivity of the Israelites, and the events connected therewith, as detailed in the last fourteen chapters of<br/>
the Book of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Exodus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>also of that marvellous deliverance,<br/>
accompanied by miracles, set forth in the first fourteen chapters of the Book of Exodus. A portion of the New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Testament </span>narrative is also connected with this country, for to<br/>
Egypt the Holy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Family </span>fled from the wrath of Herod (Matt.<br/>
ii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">s3-ao</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The earliest scriptural event recorded in connection with<br/>
Egypt is the journey of Abraham to that country <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the<br/>
time of a famine in Canaan (Gen. xii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ro-so</span>). The annual<br/>
inundation of the Nile would often plentifully supply Egypt<br/>
when other countries were suffering from scarcity of rain.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful history of Joseph commences in Gen.<br/>
xxxvii. The events of the next <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>years need no recounting here. The high office to which Joseph succeeded in the<br/>
land, the settlement of the Israelites in Goshen, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">change </span>in their treatment under the new dynasty that knew<br/>
not Joseph, and their escape from cruel <span style="color: #0000FF;">thraldom </span>by a series<br/>
of miracles-all this is of course familiar to every traveller<br/>
in Egypt, and the Bible itself will be the best handbook<br/>
from which to refresh his memory on these important<br/>
historical <span style="color: #0000FF;">associations</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Between the Egyptians and Jews a frequent intercourse<br/>
seems to have been maintained. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dent</span>. xxiii. 7 the<br/>
Israelites were told, "Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian,<br/>
