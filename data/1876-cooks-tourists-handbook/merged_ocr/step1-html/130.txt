The Third Pyramid, that of Mycerinus, is only 203<br/>
feet in height, its base line being <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span>feet. A wooden<br/>
mummy case and mummy from this Pyramid are now in the<br/>
British Museum. A sarcophagus, also found here, was lost<br/>
at sea with the vessel that was transporting it. The ancient<br/>
story of the fair Egyptian princess, who was said to have<br/>
reared this Pyramid with the fortunes of her lovers, and whose<br/>
voluptuous life was celebrated by Sappho, and also the story<br/>
of Rhodope, related by Strabo, are, of course, not to be<br/>
taken as historic truth. Rhodope was a beautiful Greek<br/>
girl, who, whilst bathing in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, attracted the very birds<br/>
of the air with her beauty. An eagle flew away with one<br/>
of. her slippers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>let it fall over Memphis. It was seen<br/>
by Pharaoh, the owner was sought out, and, as the story<br/>
goes, she became Queen of Egypt, and was buried in this<br/>
Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
There are several smaller Pyramids, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">no </span>special <span style="color: #0000FF;">interest </span>to the ordinary traveller, on the same rocky plateau above<br/>
described (see p. I09). There is also avery ancient Pyramid<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooroish</span>, about five miles north of the Great Pyramid,<br/>
which, from its elevated site, affords a fine view of the<br/>
Ghizeh Pyramids. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooséér</span>, between Ghizeh and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah</span>, there are four Pyramids, which do not, however, offer<br/>
any special attractions to invite a visit.<br/>
<br/>
In the vicinity of the Pyramids of Ghizeh are many<br/>
tombs belonging to the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ecropolis</span>. Some<br/>
of these are chambers excavated in the solid <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>others<br/>
are buildings erected on the surface, with deep pits leading<br/>
to the subterranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchres </span>in which the mummies were<br/>
deposited. The upper chamber, commonly called the Mar.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">labah</span>, is usually adorned with pictures of immense historic<br/>
