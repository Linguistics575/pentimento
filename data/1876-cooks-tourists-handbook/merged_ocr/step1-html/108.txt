children are instructed by monks.<br/>

THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">MOSQUES</span>.'<br/>
<br/>
The Mosques of Cairo are in number between 400 and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">500</span>. Many of them are in a very ruinous condition<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>There<br/>
is no difficulty about admission to the most celebrated, on<br/>
payment of a small fee.<br/>

For information as to the general arrangements of<br/>
Mosques, their officials, services, etc., see p. 44 in the<br/>
Introduction.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest Mosque in Cairo is that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ooloon</span>. It was<br/>
built by Ahmed Ebn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Touloun</span>, a century before Gowher<br/>
built Cairo (p. 86), and stood outside the city till Saladin<br/>
included it <span style="color: #0000FF;">within </span>his walls. It took three <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>building,<br/>
at a cost of £72,000. It is a copy of the Kaaba at Mecca,<br/>
and a true type of the earliest Mosques. At one time there<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>College in this building, with nine Professors<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>Mosque stands on a hill, which Muslim tradition asserts is<br/>
the hill on which the ark rested after the flood, and subsequently the spot where Abraham was about to offer Ishmael<br/>
(not Isaac) when a ram was sent to be offered instead.<br/>

after innumerable <span style="color: #ff0000;">détours</span>. At length, however, the guide<br/>
stops before a great gateway, whose miserable aspect well<br/>
harmonizes with the neighbourhood. The door is opened,<br/>
