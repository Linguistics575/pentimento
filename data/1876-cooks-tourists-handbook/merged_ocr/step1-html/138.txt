<br/>
In addition to the mention of On (or Heliopolis) in<br/>
Gen. xli. 45, as being the place where <span style="color: #ff0000;">Poti-pherah </span>(whose<br/>
daughter Asenath was married to Joseph) was priest-some<br/>
other notices occur in the Scriptures. In Jer. xliii. 13, this<br/>
city is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beth-shemesh</span>, a term of similar meaning to<br/>
Heliopolis, City of the Sun. The passage referred to is,<br/>
"He shall break all the images of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beth-shemesh </span>that is in<br/>
the land of Egypt, and the house of the gods of the Egyptians shall He burn with fire." In Ezek. xxx. <span style="color: #0000FF;">17</span>, the place<br/>
is called Aven, and the destruction <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>its young men by the<br/>
sword foretold. Josephus says that On was the city given<br/>
for a residence to the family of Jacob on their first arrival in<br/>
Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">North-east </span>of Heliopolis are the ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aboo-Kesheyd</span>,<br/>
where are three figures cut on the granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-one </span>a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">king</span>, and the others divinities. This is thought by some to<br/>
represent all that is left of Rameses, the treasure city built<br/>
by the Israelites (Gen. xlvii. <span style="color: #ff0000;">II </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Exod. i. 11; Num.<br/>
xxxiii. 2).<br/>

Heliopolis, the Egyptian An, and Hebrew On, was also<br/>
called Ra, the City of the Sun, an appellation which its<br/>
Greek name has perpetuated. Already existing under the<br/>
ancient Empire, and flourishing long after as a great sacerdotal city, to whose colleges Greek philosophers came to<br/>
learn wisdom from Egyptian priests, the story of its decadence is unknown. Strabo came here, and found only ruins<br/>
and desert. To-day all that remains of Heliopolis is the enclosure of the Temple and the wonderful Obelisk. Within<br/>
the enclosure referred to are ruins of houses, but these are<br/>
not the remains of the ancient city. They show how in the<br/>
Christian era a Coptic settlement used the walls of the<br/>
ancient Temple as an enclosure for a new town. Heliopolis<br/>
itself has disappeared to its very foundations, but doubtless if<br/>
