images, that in one regard the stone idol bears awful semblance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">deity-unch-able-rs </span>in the midst of <span style="color: #0000FF;">change-the </span>same seeing will and intent, for ever and ever inexorable.<br/>
Upon ancient dynasties of Ethiopian and Egyptian kings,<br/>
upon Greek and Roman, upon Arab and Ottoman conquerors; upon Napoleon, dreaming of an Eastern empire;<br/>
upon battle and pestilence; upon the ceaseless misery of<br/>
the Egyptian race; upon keen-eyed travellers, upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Herodotus </span>yesterday and Warburton to-day, upon all and more<br/>
this unworldly Sphinx has watched, and watched like a<br/>
providence, with the same earnest eyes and the same sad<br/>
tranquil <span style="color: #0000FF;">mien</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and we shall die, and Islam shall wither<br/>
away, and still that sleepless rock will lie watching and<br/>
watching the works of a new busy race with those same<br/>
sad earnest eyes, and the same tranquil mien everlasting.<br/>

OLD CAIRO.<br/>
<br/>
Old Cairo represents the city of the victorious Amer,<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>built in 638 A.D., and then called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fost√©t </span>(see p. 86). It<br/>
was superseded by the new Fatimite city built by Gowher in<br/>
974 A.D. In 1168 A.D., in order to prevent the Christians<br/>
from becoming masters of Old Cairo, it was burnt by the<br/>
Saracens, and ever since mounds of rubbish have covered<br/>
the greater part of the site of the ancient city.<br/>
<br/>
There are still some objects of great interest in Old Cairo.<br/>
Amongst these the Mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Amer, or Amrou, is preeminent. It was founded by the General whose name it bears<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">642</span>, and is modelled after the Kaaba at Mecca. The visitor<br/>
enters by an immense oblong court, the east end of which<br/>
is a gallery with rows of columns, enclosing the sanctuary<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">maubar</span>, or chair of the preacher; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">khateb</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
<br/>
