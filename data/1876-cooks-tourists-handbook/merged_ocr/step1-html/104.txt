<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pets </span>are almost the only articles on sale. At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lerongéh</span>,<br/>
horse harness and the wonderful embroidered leather are to<br/>
be procured. The finest of all is the Bazaar Turc, ablaze<br/>
with jewellery, gold work, and precious stones.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few other important streets in Cairo, such <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>the Boulevard Abdul Aziz, the Boulevard <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méhémet </span>Ali, the<br/>
Boulevard Clot Bey, and the road to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boulék</span>; but the old city<br/>
mostly consists of an immense number of narrow tortuous<br/>
lanes and passages, the houses frequently overhanging the<br/>
way till they nearly meet overhead, and apparently closing in<br/>
before and behind.<br/>
<br/>
The public baths are mostly richly decorated brick<br/>
edifices, they are very numerous, the chief are <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Tumbalee</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">HammanrYesbak</span>, El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moeyed</span>, El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soukeriéh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In each quarter there is a public fountain and drinking<br/>
place for cattle. Some of the more ancient are very interesting specimens of old Muslim erections. The fountain<br/>
usually has a portico, arch, columns, etc., and also a first<br/>
floor, generally used as a free school. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>these fountains<br/>
there are more than 300 in Cairo. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>

</span>TH E CITADEL.<br/>
<br/>
The Citadel, or El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaléh</span>, is like a little walled town enclosed in a larger one. It is said to occupy the sight of the<br/>
Acropolis of ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bablioun</span>. The Boulevard <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méhémet<br/>
</span>Ali leads direct from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah </span>to the Citadel. It is<br/>
built on the flank <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hill overlooking the town, though it is<br/>
now itself commanded by the fort on Mount Mokattam,<br/>
built by Mahomed Ali when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khoorshid </span>Pasha held the town<br/>
against him<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>There <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>entrances to the Citadel. One is by the<br/>
magnificent specimen of Saracenic architecture known as the<br/>
