<span>86 EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
the same vicinity we read of the Egyptian town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">LouiTkeshrémi</span>, and at a later date of the Arab towns of El<br/>
Maks and El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Knttaiiea</span>. When <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amer-ebn-el-As</span>, the<br/>
victorious general of the Caliph Omar, subdued Egypt (see<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span>), he built on the site of his camp a city called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostzit<br/>
</span>(from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostdt</span>, a tent). The suburb of old Cairo marks the<br/>
site of <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ostét </span>and the western part of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bablioun</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the tenth century the Fatimites, who had been ruling<br/>
at Kayrawan in the state now known as Tunis, invaded<br/>
Egypt (see p.94), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Djauhar </span>or Gowher, their general,<br/>
built a city as a capital for the new dynasty. It took five<br/>
years in building, was erected with all due astrological <span style="color: #0000FF;">observances</span>, and placed under the protection of the planet<br/>
Kahir or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>. Hence the new town was named <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Kahera<br/>
</span>(the victorious), known to Europeans as Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Saladin</span>, in 1176, replaced the original brick walls<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kéherah </span>with stone ones, considerably extended the<br/>
city, built the Citadel (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">po</span>) and Aqueduct (p. 93), and<br/>
permitted Christians to settle in the city. Hence originated<br/>
the F rank Quarter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mooskee</span>. At the downfall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mem..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span>rulers in 1517, and transfer of the Caliphate (p. 91),<br/>
Cairo became simply the capital of a Turkish province.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nothing </span>of particular importance occurred till the capture of<br/>
the city by the French after the Battle of the Pyramids (p.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">74</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The army of Napoleon entered the city in July,<br/>
1798. A few months afterwards 300 French were massacred<br/>
in a revolt. Napoleon suppressed the revolt with his usual<br/>
relentless severity, and took more than tenfold vengeance,<br/>
more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">4000 </span>insurgents being slain. The French occupancy was of short duration. In the troublous time that<br/>
succeeded, as described in our chapter on the History of<br/>
Egypt, Mahomed Ali rose to power. Under that prince and<br/>
his successors Cairo has increased and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished</span>, and now<br/>
