in a series of steps, formed of huge blocks of stone. Fresh<br/>
series of steps were added to the outside, till the requisite<br/>
dimensions were <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohtained </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Then the steps were filled up<br/>
with smooth polished stone, covered with sculptures and<br/>
inscriptions. The interior chambers and passages were then<br/>
used on the occasion of the sepulture of the illustrious<br/>
builder, and the entrance hermetically sealed. From most<br/>
of the Pyramids the outer polished stones have been removed,<br/>
to furnish materials for the edifices of the Mahomedan epoch.<br/>
So that now there remains in most cases the series of colossal<br/>
steps up which visitors climb to the summit. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anciently </span>each<br/>
Pyramid had a temple near the base, in which divine <span style="color: #0000FF;">honours<br/>
</span>were paid to the deified monarch for whom the pile was<br/>
reared.<br/>
<br/>
To ascend the Great Pyramid a payment of three shillings<br/>
from each tourist has to be made to the Sheikh of the Pyramids,<br/>
and in addition to this a further fee must be paid for the<br/>
assistance of some strong, muscular Arabs. The usual plan<br/>
is to have an Arab on each side; if the exigencies of the<br/>
case require, an extra Arab or two pull in front and push<br/>
behind. Some travellers make a point of getting up without<br/>
aid, but the consequent exhaustion is scarcely worth the<br/>
glory of having accomplished the task. It should be re.<br/>
membered also that a high wind renders the ascent peculiarly toilsome, if not dangerous, and a clear sky is needed<br/>
for the enjoyment of the view.<br/>
<br/>
At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">summit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Pyramid is a platform about thirty<br/>
feet square, from which a fine view is obtained. "There is<br/>
something unutterably impressive," says a recent visitor,<br/>
"steals over one's mind as one stands upon the top of that<br/>
wonderful monument of ancient greatness and power. The<br/>
long line of vegetation that separates the fruitful valley of<br/>
the Nile from the arid desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>traced and defined <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
