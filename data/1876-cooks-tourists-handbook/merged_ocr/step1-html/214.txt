<span>198 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
ASSOUAN TO <span style="color: #ff0000;">WhDY-HALFA</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Assouan (as described at p. 190) the steamer.<br/>
passes on its way towards the south. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>is soon <span style="color: #0000FF;">left<br/>
</span>behind, and the onward course is between low <span style="color: #ff0000;">granitemountains </span>that hem in the river on both sides, leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">onlya<br/>
</span>narrow cultivated strip<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>tombs are frequent, especially on the<br/>
western bank. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakias </span>are everywhere, each paying a<br/>
tax of <span style="color: #0000FF;">zoo </span>piastres to the Government.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dabir</span>'d (W.) is a temple of Isis, built by Atar-Amun,<br/>
king of Ethiopia, about the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus.<br/>
<br/>
Before arriving at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gertéssee </span>the scenery of the river is<br/>
very fine-granite rocks and verdant banks, and occasional<br/>
villages and palm groves are picturesquely mingled.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gertdssee </span>(W.) are a few columns of a ruined temple,<br/>
beautifully situated on the rocks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unlike </span>most Egyptian<br/>
temples, which are generally on the level plain. There is a<br/>
quarry near at hand, with many inscriptions and busts, etc.,<br/>
chiefly of the times of the Roman Emperors.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Téfah </span>(W.) Here are the remains of two temples. The<br/>
gazelle is said to be occasionally met with in the desert<br/>
ravines of the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the south of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Téfah </span>the "Gates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">kaltibsheh</span>,"<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span>Bab are passed; this is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow </span>part of the river where<br/>
the adjacent mountains bend inward on both sides of the<br/>
river and confine its channel between huge cliffs<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>a number<br/>
of slight rapids are formed here by the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalébsheh </span>(W.), whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>long been<br/>
noted for their fierce courage, are the ruins of the largest of<br/>
the Nubian temples; the steps which formerly led up to it<br/>
from the river are gone, though the parapets remain'<br/>
hence a paved area, another flight of steps, and a stone<br/>
causeway lead to the grand terrace on which the ruins stand<span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
