<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">184 </span>THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
this temple: some display the warlike achievements of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Ptolemies, many are of the usual religious character.<br/>
From some have been derived valuable geographical facts as<br/>
to Ancient Egypt. There are some curious inscriptions on<br/>
the basement of the exterior of great <span style="color: #0000FF;">importance</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>they<br/>
describe in detail the various chambers of this temple,<br/>
giving the dimensions, so that a means for accurately comparing ancient and <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>measures is thus afforded. The<br/>
name of the architect is given as Ei-em-hotep Oer-si-Phtah<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Imouthes</span>, grandson of Phtah). Another inscription states<br/>
that, with interruptions from war, the building took <span style="color: #ff0000;">ninetyfive </span>years to complete; this must refer to the actual <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of the building-as from the names of kings mentioned above, the buildings and decorations were not finished<br/>
in less <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>170 years.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Court is first entered, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">140 </span>feet by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>feet, and surrounded on three sides by thirty-two <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissimilar </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The Pronaos, next entered, stretches<br/>
across the building, and contains immense pillars covered<br/>
with hieroglyphics. The Adytum contains twelve peculiar<br/>
columns bulging excessively at the centre; on each side are<br/>
four small rooms-one has a staircase leading to the terrace.<br/>
Several other courts and chambers are visited, and at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">extreme </span>end of the building is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naos</span>, or sanctuary. The<br/>
place of deposit of the sacred emblem was not, as at<br/>
Denderah, a niche in the wall, but the grey granite monolith<br/>
now lying in one <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner </span>of the apartment; this was the<br/>
repository of the sacred hawk, emblem of Hor-Hat; the<br/>
monolith was made by Nectanebo I., of the thirtieth dynasty,<br/>
for an older temple to which the present edifice succeeded.<br/>
There is an exquisite little chapel covered with very perfect<br/>
bas-reliefs on the north side of the building<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>this sanctuary<br/>
was connected with the New Year Ceremonies.<br/>
