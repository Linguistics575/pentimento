make the trip in one of the Government steamers. The<br/>
saving in expense is very great. As regards time, the<br/>
, may return to Cairo in six weeks, or it may be<br/>
twelve. The steamer gets back from the First Cataract in<br/>
twenty-one days. Other advantages connected with making<br/>
the trip by steam are, that you go on at a uniform rate,<br/>
independently of wind or <span style="color: #0000FF;">stream</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>you are never becalmed,<br/>
and there is no forced labour employed in towing the vessel<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">along</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>it is a public conveyance, and every passenger can be<br/>
as independent as he pleases, or the vessel can be chartered<br/>
for a private party by paying fifteen first-class fares; all<br/>
charges are strictly inclusive, and no bargaining is necessary;<br/>
no travelling is done by night, so that every inch of the<br/>
route can be examined<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>punctuality is observed in all<br/>
departures and arrivals, and there is no previous delay for<br/>
selection, contract, etc.<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>all the attractions of the Nile are<br/>
visited on the up journey, while the interest is fresh;<br/>
arrangements are made for the receipt of letters and <span style="color: #0000FF;">telegrams</span>; and, finally, the dullness, monotony, and dissatisfaction, of which travellers by <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabeah </span>have so often complained, are conspicuous by their absence from the Nile<br/>
steamers.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the place <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>embarkation at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasren-Nil</span>, the steamer soon glides past Old Cairo, and Roda and<br/>
the Nilometer (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">121</span>). Not far from Old Cairo, the fine<br/>
mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Attar-emNebbee</span>, which is said to perpetuate the<br/>
name of Athor, the Egyptian Venus, is seen on a projecting<br/>
rock. The Pyramids of Ghizeh, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashéor </span>are<br/>
successively passed on the western shore. On the east, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Toom<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maisara </span>is passed, with the immense quarries from which<br/>
were taken the stone casings for the Pyramids. Looking<br/>
back, the lofty citadel of Cairo, and its white mosque,<br/>
remain conspicuous objects for a considerable distance.<br/>
