<br/>
Pompey's <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pi11ar.-The </span>name of this celebrated<br/>
column is "really a misnomer," as intimated in Horace<br/>
Smith's well known "Address to the Mummy." It stands<br/>
on a high piece of ground, probably the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Joftiest </span>site in the<br/>
ancient city. The elegant shaft is of polished red granite,<br/>
the capital and pedestal are of inferior workmanship. The<br/>
total height is nearly 100 feet. The shaft is considered to<br/>
have formed part of an ancient temple, utilized in the erection of the present column in honour of Diocletian, after<br/>
his eight months' siege of Alexandria in <span style="color: #0000FF;">296 </span>A.D., and sanguinary suppression of the rebellion of Achilleus. A statue<br/>
once adorned the summit.<br/>
<br/>
The Mahomedan Cemetery is very near Pom..<br/>
pey's Pillar. It is a wilderness of stones, without fence or<br/>
rail, or anything of the sort, to seclude it from the common<br/>
roadway. Many of the stones have a turban roughly carved<br/>
on the top<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>some are painted green, showing that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased </span>in his day made the pilgrimage to Mecca, or was a<br/>
descendant of the Prophet. "A group of women,<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'says<br/>
</span>one visitor to this <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot</span>, "were sitting round an open grave,<br/>
rocking themselves to and fro, and wailing for the dead.<br/>
We had no need to draw near to hear the lamentations they<br/>
made, for the low mournful dirge with which they began<br/>
soon increased to a loud howl, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>this continued nearly all<br/>
the time we remained in the neighbourhood; but it scarcely<br/>
impressed us with solemnity, certainly not with any desire to<br/>
shed sympathetic tears; for as these women are paid so<br/>
much for the job, and are constantly at it, it was a dead<br/>
certainty that they felt but little the ceremony in which they<br/>
were engaged." There is a characteristic filthy Egyptian<br/>
village overlooking the cemetery.<br/>
