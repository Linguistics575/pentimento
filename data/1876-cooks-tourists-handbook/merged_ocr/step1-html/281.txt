<span>MOUNT SINAI. 263<br/>
<br/>
The scene, as far as the eye can reach, is wild and <span style="color: #0000FF;">desolate-an </span>assemblage of innumerable mountain peaks, with no<br/>
place in sight where Israel could have stood to witness the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">awful </span>scenes that took place on Sinai. But at the same<br/>
time <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is not improbable that Jebel Moosa is the portion<br/>
of the mountain where Moses was alone with God.<br/>
Descending from the summit of Jebel Moosa to the<br/>
spring of Elijah (p. 262), a start may thence be made for the<br/>
bold peak, or series of peaks, at the north-western end of<br/>
the same range, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tths </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufsiifeh</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Awild </span>and rugged<br/>
path leads over intervening peaks to a small circular plain.<br/>
Here stands the willow (<span style="color: #ff0000;">efstifeh</span>) which names the <span style="color: #0000FF;">menu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tain</span>, and hard by the goats are seen sheltering in the Chapel<br/>
of the Virgin of the Zone. Hence <span style="color: #ff0000;">halCarr.hour</span>'s severe<br/>
climbing conducts to the summit of the cone. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountain </span>is separated into two peaks, and from the little plateau<br/>
between there is a grand view. Immediately in front<br/>
stretches the great plain Er <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rahtlh</span>, "the Plain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rest</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>while in full view are the huge <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédies </span>centring on it, and<br/>
far beyond on every side are extended plains and hills. <span style="color: #ff0000;">ErRahéh </span>would easily accommodate all the congregation of<br/>
Israel, and the adjacent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsidies </span>and plains afforded excellent<br/>
situations for encamping. The visitor need hardly doubt<br/>
that he is "standing at the very spot on which Jehovah<br/>
descended in awful majesty, and from which His voice<br/>
announced the moral law to man. The whole scene is<br/>
worthy of Him, and of the august occasion." Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinai<br/>
</span>was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon'<br/>
it in fire, and "the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of<br/>
a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And all<br/>
the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings, and the<br/>
noise of the trumpet, and the mountain <span style="color: #0000FF;">smoking</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and when<br/>
the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. And<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
