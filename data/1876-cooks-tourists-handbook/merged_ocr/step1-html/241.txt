from Trieste, thirty-seven. The rate at which steamers are<br/>
allowed to pass through is from five to six knots per hour.<br/>
<br/>
Considerable labour must be expended on the Canal,<br/>
especially as regards widening the deep central channel,<br/>
before a full and entire success can be considered to be<br/>
attained. The present practice of waiting in sidings, to allow<br/>
other vessels to pass is, of course, a great obstruction to the<br/>
rapidity of transit so desirable at the present day. It is, at the<br/>
present, only seventy-two feet wide at the bottom, and twentysix feet deep.<br/>

SUEZ TO PORT <span style="color: #0000FF;">SAID</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>(By Maritime Canal, 100 miles.)<br/>
<br/>
The broad mouth of the Suez Canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">poo </span>feet in width)<br/>
is protected by a long mole built of stone from Gebel<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Att√©kah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Plain of Suez is cut through by the first part of<br/>
the Canal for twelve <span style="color: #0000FF;">miles</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the plain is low and marshy, and<br/>
the dredging machines need to be constantly at work.<br/>
<br/>
"To one who is on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span>out for beautiful scenery and<br/>
stirring life," says F. B. Zincke, "the two days' steaming<br/>
from Suez to Port Said will not give much pleasure. As long<br/>
as you are on the actual Canal you pass along a straight<br/>
waterway between two high hills of sand, the sky overhead is<br/>
the only additional object in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nature</span>. There is no vegetation,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">there </span>are but few birds, there is no animal on the banks or<br/>
insect in the air. At long intervals there are small wooden<br/>
shanties for watering stations. A great many dredging<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">machines'are </span>passed. They are large floating structures,<br/>
moved and worked by <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>each of them costs between<br/>
five and six thousand pounds<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>their business is to dredge up<br/>
the mud or sand from the bottom of the Canal to a lofty stage<br/>
