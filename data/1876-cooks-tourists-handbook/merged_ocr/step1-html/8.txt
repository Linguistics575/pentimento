<br/>
From a great variety of works of travel and research,<br/>
the principal of which are named at p. 292, the Editor has<br/>
supplemented his own personal observations. Whenever it<br/>
has been his impression that a graphic piece of description<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">for </span>suggestive note by <span style="color: #ff0000;">some'Well-known </span>writer would add<br/>

refers, it has been extracted and given as a quotation in the<br/>
following pages.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor will be grateful for any information derived<br/>
from the personal observation of Tourists, which may serve<br/>
to correct errors or supply deficiencies in this Handbook.<br/>
