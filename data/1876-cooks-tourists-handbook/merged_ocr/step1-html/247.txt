<span>PORT SAID. <span style="color: #ff0000;">229<br/>
<br/>
</span>from Jaffa. It is a town of very recent growth, containing<br/>
some 10,000 inhabitants. It is regularly laid out on foundations consisting chiefly of materials excavated from the canal.<br/>
It stands where the canal pierces the low <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandbank </span>separating<br/>
Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean Sea. The Port comprises a quay, a basin of <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">37 </span>acres, and a dry dock nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">4.50<br/>
</span>ft. in length. The roadstead lies outside these, between two<br/>
breakwaters stretching out, one 7000 and the other 6000 ft.<br/>
These moles are twice as far apart at the shore ends as at the<br/>
ends nearest the sea, where they are only 800 yards apart. The<br/>
moles, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>ft. wide at top, are formed of an artificial concrete,<br/>
formed of the Canal dredgings, lime from Theil, near<br/>
Marseilles, and salt water. An electric light flashes <span style="color: #0000FF;">out<br/>
</span>from the lighthouse, which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">180 </span>ft. in height, and formed<br/>
of solid concrete.<br/>
<br/>
Port Said is supplied with water in pipes from the<br/>
Sweet-Water Canal at Ismailia. A three-days' supply is<br/>
kept in reservoirs. This place was chosen as the head of<br/>
the Canal because of the nearness of deep water to the shore.<br/>
There is nothing particular to see in the town; but some<br/>
visitors will be interested in noticing the Dockyard, <span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Workshop</span>, Transit Basin, Commercial Basin, Dockyard Basin,<br/>
Engine-House Basin, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In the Globe newspaper of Aug. <span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>, 1876, a striking<br/>
result of the Suez Canal is thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">described'.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--<br/>
</span>"Year after year a vast climactic change is gradually<br/>
more and more observable in Eastern Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>rather, to be<br/>
more precise, in that belt of land, 90 miles or so long by<br/>
some 30 broad, which, extending between Suez and Port<br/>
Said, is directly influenced by the water of the Suez Canal.<br/>
Before the Canal was opened up there was scarcely a blade<br/>
of grass in the region, except on the borders of the Bitter<br/>
Lakes and round about the Oasis of Ismailia. But now the<br/>
