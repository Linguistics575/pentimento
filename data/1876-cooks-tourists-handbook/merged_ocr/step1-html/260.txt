grand army; but every battalion of the gabbling, shrieking<br/>
host seemed to be disciplined, orderly, and distinct."<br/>
<br/>
The modern village of Sais is a wretched little fishing<br/>
village-a mere collection of huts. Efforts were made many<br/>
years ago to establish nitre works here, but the attempt<br/>
was a failure. Hard by are the ruins of the city of Sais,<br/>
anciently Tanis, and called in the Bible history Zoan.<br/>
<br/>
Here lies, bare and gaunt, in stark and silent devastation, one of the grandest and oldest ruins in the world. It<br/>
is deep in the middle of an enclosing amphitheatre of mounds,<br/>
all of them absolutely bare, and all <span style="color: #0000FF;">dark-red </span>from the<br/>
millions of potsherds that defy the winds of time, and the<br/>
dew, and the sun alike, to stir them, or even to melt away<br/>
their sharp-edged fragments.<br/>
<br/>
"M. Mariette, of Cairo, lately had these ruins uncovered<br/>
(by forced labour I was told) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>men at a time. They<br/>
are widespread, varied, and gigantic. Here you see about<br/>
a dozen obelisks, all fallen, all broken<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>twenty or thirty<br/>
great statues, all monoliths of porphyry and granite, red and<br/>
grey; a huge sarcophagus (as it seemed to me) was of softer<br/>
stone; and enormous pillars, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lintel</span>, and wall stones are piled<br/>
in heaps one over the other, most of them still buried in the<br/>
earth. The polished statues are of various sizes, and of<br/>
beautiful workmanship. Some sit with half the body over<br/>
the ground, others with only a leg in the air. One leans its<br/>
great bulk sideways, covered up to the ear; another lies with<br/>
its chair and legs appearing, but the head is buried deep out<br/>
of sight in the mud.<br/>
<br/>
"The building seemed to have formed a temple, with<br/>
three outlying edifices. Some of the obelisks must have<br/>
fallen long before the dust and refuse of ages had filled the<br/>
courtly halls, then tenantless. Others fell on this new stratum, and there now lie, say, ten feet higher than the floor<br/>
