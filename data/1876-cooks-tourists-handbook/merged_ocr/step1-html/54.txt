<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">khol</span>, a practice of high antiquity in Egypt, as proved by<br/>
implements found in the tombs.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-to-do </span>Egyptian keeps a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sackcka</span>, or water-carrier,<br/>
who takes rank as upper servant, and attends the ladies in<br/>
their walks or <span style="color: #0000FF;">drives </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>a sais, or groom, who not only attends<br/>
to the stables, but also runs before or beside his master's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jou.r'tral</span>, or porter, responsible for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">streetdoor</span>, and always <span style="color: #0000FF;">there</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the several black slaves for<br/>
various duties as required.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptians rise early, and take a cup of coffee and a pipe,<br/>
breakfasting at noon on bread, eggs, butter, cheese, stewed<br/>
beans, <span style="color: #0000FF;">clouted </span>cream, etc. Dinner is usually a private meal,<br/>
taken in the harem. The chief meal of the day is <span style="color: #0000FF;">supper</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>,<br/>
and is the meal at which guests are usually received. Washing of hands and saying of grace always precedes and follows<br/>
a meal. The food is usually eaten with the fingers, and it<br/>
is a great mark of civility and kindness for a host to pick<br/>
out a nice morsel and put it in a guest's mouth.<br/>
<br/>
"The manner of eating with the fingers, as practised in<br/>
Egypt and many other Eastern countries," says Mr. Lane,<br/>
"is more delicate than may be imagined by Europeans who<br/>
have not witnessed it, or heard it correctly described. Each<br/>
person breaks off a small piece of bread, dips it in the dish,<br/>
and then conveys it to his mouth, together with a small portion of the meat or other contents of the dish. The piece<br/>
of bread is generally doubled together, so as to enclose the<br/>
morsel of meat, etc., and only the thumb and first and<br/>
second fingers are commonly used."<br/>
<br/>
Courteousness and hospitality are common in Egypt.<br/>
Free converse ensues at once on chance meetings with<br/>
strangers. The pipe which a person is smoking is <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered<br/>
</span>as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">matter-of-course </span>act of politeness, and even the shopkeeper taking a meal will ask his customer to partake.<br/>
