<br/>
Near Gow (E.), are the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antaeopolis</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the<br/>
early part of last century, columns, etc., of great interest<br/>
were standing. Now there is little more than a confused<br/>
heap of stones. The whole village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>was carried<br/>
away in <span style="color: #ff0000;">182 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span>by the waters of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The western mountains take a wide sweep from Gow to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahtah</span>, enclosing a rich and well-cultivated plain.<br/>
<br/>
Passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mishte </span>(W.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shabeka </span>(W.), and other unimportant places, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahtah </span>(pop. 3000) is seen at some distance<br/>
inland, with mounds of ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hesopis</span>. Corn and cattle<br/>
are important products of this neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahtah </span>projects the Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheykh </span>Heree'dee,<br/>
traditionally said to be inhabited by a serpent gifted with the<br/>
power of healing all kinds of diseases<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>there are some<br/>
interesting caves. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benoweet </span>(W.), <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">you </span>(W.) (ancient<br/>
Aphroditopolis), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souhdg </span>(W.) are next passed.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Souhfig</span>, the capital of the province of Girgeh. A<br/>
large canal at this place conducts the Nile water to the<br/>
interior. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souh√©g </span>is the place from which to visit the White<br/>
and Red <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monasteries</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The White Monastery has been placed, from prudential<br/>
motives, under the protection of the Muslim Saint Abou<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shenoodeh</span>. It has been ruined and sacked several times,<br/>
lastly in 1812, by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>, who, however, could not<br/>
injure the immense walls. The interior was once a grand<br/>
basilica. The exterior was built in the Egyptian style, by the<br/>
Empress Helena, at the edge of the Libyan desert, where it<br/>
stands desolate and alone amongst the sand. The Red<br/>
Monastery is, perhaps, the more ancient of the two.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ekhmeeln </span>(E.) is a tolerably well-built town of wide<br/>
streets, and a considerable corn and poultry town. Coarse<br/>
cottons, especially the fringed shawls of the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">boatmen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>are manufactured here<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>also earthenware. The town <span style="color: #0000FF;">con<br/>
