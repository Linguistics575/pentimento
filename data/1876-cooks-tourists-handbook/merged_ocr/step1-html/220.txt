examine the sculptures, and a magnesium light is advisable<br/>
to get a good general view of the various chambers.<br/>
<br/>
The roof of the grand hall is supported by eight immense<br/>
pillars of square stone. These pillars are of the kind called<br/>
Osiride, each being faced with a statue of Osiris 17 feet<br/>
high, with hands folded, and calm majestic countenance.<br/>
The second room contains four square <span style="color: #0000FF;">pillars</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>then there is<br/>
a corridor, and then the adytum. This is the inner sanctuary, with an altar yet standing, before four seated statues<br/>
of gods. Here 3000 years ago the great Sesostris offered<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices</span>. There are eight other chambers in various<br/>
directions, connected with this subterranean temple.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere on the walls are tableaux representing the<br/>
victories of Rameses the Great, otherwise called Sesostris.<br/>
The battle scenes are of great interest, and throw much light<br/>
on the military arrangements of the ancient Egyptians. The<br/>
sculptures show the process of their formation, as in some<br/>
there are the designed black lines as yet untouched by the<br/>
chisel, some roughly chiselled as a beginning, others evenly<br/>
completed and polished.<br/>
<br/>
This great temple was dedicated to Re, the Sun, whose<br/>
effigy is carved over the entrance. The view from the cliff<br/>
above the statues is very fine, but requires considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">toil..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>exertion to obtain<br/>
<br/>
There is a Smaller <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple'near </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.at </span>hand dedicated<br/>
to Athor, who is symbolized in the form of a cow. This<br/>
temple also is excavated in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock</span>. In front, seven large<br/>
buttresses sloping backward from the base have between<br/>
them six standing Colossi. The interior consists of a hall<br/>
with side chambers, a pronaos, and an adytum, or shrine, containing one mutilated figure. The execution of the sculptures<br/>
in this temple is very inferior to that of the larger <span style="color: #ff0000;">editice</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There is yet another Small Temple dedicated to Rameses the Great, which was discovered by Mr. Andrew<br/>
