and very clean, and the interior of the town is somewhat<br/>
better than usual, boasting even of a bath. The view from<br/>
Minieh is also very beautiful.".<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Minieh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>contains several mosques, in one of which are<br/>
columns of Roman workmanship<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>there are also numerous baths. At a little distance various handsome buildings<br/>
are seen, apparently intermingled with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounding<br/>
</span>groves of date palm<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>there is also a fine palace belonging to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, built on a beautiful site about ten years ago.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s sugar factories at this town, five in number,<br/>
are unrivalled in the world for their substantial character<br/>
and perfection of <span style="color: #0000FF;">appliances</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the chimneys tower to a<br/>
height of 200 feet. Here also, in spite of Mahomedan law,<br/>
his Highness annually produces several thousand gallons of<br/>
rum. The people are compelled to work in these factories<br/>
and receive a shilling a day as wages.<br/>
<br/>
The boatmen of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>assert that the white Muslim<br/>
tomb, previously mentioned, is death to crocodiles; if one<br/>
dares <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pass </span>it he turns wrong side up and floats, a corpse,<br/>
down the river.<br/>

Passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sooddee </span>(E.), with its sugar plantations <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">few<br/>
</span>grottoes and mounds, the steamer next reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">2owyet-elMyiteén </span>(E.), where is the cemetery of Minieh, to which<br/>
the dead are ferried with funeral rites strongly reminding<br/>
the eye-witness of scenes pictured on the ancient tombs.<br/>
The custom of burying the dead on the opposite side of the<br/>
river to the city in which they dwelt is of very high antiquity in Egypt. Kom Ahmar (E.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metdhara</span>, (<span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span>), and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shardra </span>(W.) are next passed, each with interesting caves or<br/>
grottoes, etc., for the inspection of the leisurely traveller.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beni-Hassan </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">171 </span>miles from Cairo. From hence<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot</span>, especial care must be taken to guard against<br/>
the thieving propensities of the inhabitants. Some years ago<br/>
