ROUTES FROM LONDON TO THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
In connection with Palestine Tours the <span style="color: #0000FF;">routes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>London <span style="color: #ff0000;">may </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>classified under two heads, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FIRST</span>, ROUTES OF PERSONALLY-CONDUCTED TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r.</span>) For long tours the usual course is to cross the English Channel by<br/>
either the Calais route (the shortest sea passage), or by Dieppe (the shortest<br/>
distance to Paris). From Paris go direct to Turin by the Mont Cenis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunnel</span>, and from Turin by Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi; thence by<br/>
steamer to Corfu, and then to Alexandria; after visiting Lower Egypt or<br/>
going up the Nile, cross the land of Goshen to Ismailia, and there take<br/>
steamer on Suez Canal for Port Said, from Port Said sail to Jaffa and land<br/>
there' make the tour of the country, and re-embark on steamer at Beyrout<br/>
for Constantinople<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>thence to Athens, and complete the tour of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>. terranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Adriatic by landing at Trieste; return through Italy by<br/>
Venice, Milan, and Turin, and back to Paris and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Landon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Whilst this is the general course of the conductors, many modifications,<br/>
extensions, or abridgments may be made to suit the convenience and meet<br/>
the wishes of the travellers, who may go through Italy and meet the conductor at Brindisi, or may go round by <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ice</span>, Mentone, etc., and meet the<br/>
party at any <span style="color: #ff0000;">fpractical </span>point<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The route from Palestine may be varied by<br/>
going direct rom Smyrna to Athens, then to Constantinople, and up the<br/>
Danube to Vienna<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>or from Trieste, parties can go direct to Vienna.<br/>
<br/>
From other ports of northern Italy the Alps can be crossed, so as to<br/>
return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or some other deviations<br/>
from the beaten track can be provided for if desired.<br/>
<br/>
(2.) The route for short tours to Lower Egypt and two or three <span style="color: #0000FF;">weeks<br/>
</span>in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as described above, then to<br/>
Genoa, and take steamer there for Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, Naples,<br/>
and Messina. Proceed through Lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>to Ismailia and Port Said,<br/>
and thence to Jaffa. Return from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa </span>or Caifa to Alexandria, and thence<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aples</span>, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">round </span>by<br/>
Venice and Milan to Turin <span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">route </span>for Paris. This is the cheapest and<br/>
most popular route to Palestine. The whole may be covered from New<br/>
York and back for <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>dols. to 600 dols. first class, or 400 dols. to<br/>
500 dols. second class, hotels included. But this route can be modified,<br/>
extended, or abridged in many <span style="color: #0000FF;">ways </span>It can be reversed through Italy,<br/>
and other lines of steamers can be taken from French or Italian ports. In<br/>
all <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>of personally-conducted tours it is necessary to define the route<br/>
the conductor will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, as<br/>
all baggage, omnibus, and other incidental charges are paid by him; but if<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">any </span>leave him it is not possible to control these expenses, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>then take their own course and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pay </span>the extras. But tickets can be.<br/>
provided for travelling by any <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceivable </span>line of railway or steamboat.<br/>
