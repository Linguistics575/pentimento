<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">PHILE</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">95<br/>
<br/>
</span>for the punishment of those who offended the majesty of<br/>
the priesthood."<br/>
<br/>
The whole area of the ancient temple was <span style="color: #ff0000;">433 </span>ft. long<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">135 </span>broad, according to some measurements, but it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>say how much of the surrounding ruins were adjuncts<br/>
of the temple, or separate structures.<br/>
<br/>
In after times, when the Christians were in the ascendant<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia</span>, the sculptures were defaced with hammers, and<br/>
the paintings daubed with mud. In 577 A.D. the interior<br/>
of the temple became, under Bishop <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theodorus</span>, the church<br/>
of St. Stephen, and at a yet later period, a Coptic church<br/>
was built up out of the ruins.<br/>
<br/>
Taken as a whole, the ruined Temple of Isis at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila </span>is<br/>
an elegant example of the lighter architecture of the Ptolemaic era, and does not present the aspect of colossal grandeur<br/>
seen in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>ruins.<br/>
<br/>
There is a staircase leading to the top of the propylon.<br/>
The view is very fine, and has been thus described <span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
</span>"Beneath lies the verdant and flowery islet, strewn with<br/>
marble wrought into every beautiful form known to ancient<br/>
art; over that pile of prostrate pillars, a grove of palms is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">waving </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>from between the columns of yon small temple,<br/>
the acacia's foliage seems to gush, and its blossoms stream.<br/>
Round all the island flows the clear, bright river, and<br/>
opposite lies the old Temple of Osiris, now called Pharaoh's<br/>
Bed. Beyond the river are gleams of green, shooting across<br/>
drifts of desert sands, palms, rocks, villages, and wastes'<br/>
and over all, darkly encircling this paradise, rises the rugged<br/>
chain of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hemaceuta</span>, or golden mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Of other ruins on the island of Philae, the principal are<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Esculapius, in front of the Temple of<br/>
Isis, near the beginning of the eastern corridor.<br/>
