<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SPEOS </span>ARTEMIDOS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">143<br/>
<br/>
</span>the familiar every-day life of men who walked the land<br/>
before the days of Joseph. In these mansions of the dead-eternal abodes<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Euwwovs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o'lxovs </span>as the ancients called them--mimic men and women are wrestling, fishing, ploughing,<br/>
and reaping, trapping birds, giving dinner-parties, being<br/>
flogged, cutting their toe-nails, treading the wine-press,<br/>
dancing, <span style="color: #ff0000;">-playing </span>the harp, weaving linen, playing at catch<br/>
ball, being shaved by the barber, playing at draughts.<br/>
Verily, there is nothing new under the sun. What say you<br/>
to an elderly lady robed in a dress having three <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bounces</span>.<br/>
And then there are stranger things than that! Yes, the old,<br/>
old story of human life is there, told as in a picture book.<br/>
Though seen through a gap of four thousand years the eye<br/>
moistens over it still. Here are life's festive scenes and<br/>
revels-the wine cup and the garland; and here its scenes<br/>
of sorrow-mourners are weeping over their dead. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nothing<br/>
</span>is lacking. And so, by the mystic sympathy-that touch of<br/>
nature which links man with man-you reach out a hand<br/>
across the ages, and feel the throbbings of a humanity<br/>
kindred with your own." All persons of true taste and feeling will be disgusted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>these precious memorials disfigured by the carving of the ignoble names of modern visitors.<br/>
<br/>
In the Southern tombs the architecture more closely<br/>
resembles that of the temples, where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus </span>and papyrus<br/>
have suggested shapes for column and capital<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Speos Artemidos lies in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>the<br/>
east. It is an excavation in the rock dedicated to Pasht,<br/>
the Egyptian Diana, commenced by Thothmes III., and<br/>
carried on by Sethi, father of Rameses the Great, but never<br/>
completed. There are some interesting sculptures and<br/>
hieroglyphics.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheykh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Timay </span>(E.), has catacombs and quarries, and some<br/>
slight remains of the Gisr-el-Agoos (p. 140) are seen on<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
