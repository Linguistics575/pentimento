abruptly in a frowning headland as if the sea was surging at<br/>
its feet. There <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>have been pyramids and sphinxes here<br/>
long before Egypt was ever heard of-the builders, the<br/>
storms of the desert; the materials with which they were<br/>
wrought, the mountain masses of limestone rock which have<br/>
been detached from the main body and formed into almost<br/>
every conceivable shape."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nukhl </span>is thirty hours' journey farther, where the territory of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tawarah </span>Arabs terminates. Here <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiytthah </span>Arabs<br/>
are in possession, and the traveller must change his escort,<br/>
unless no <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiyéhahs </span>are forthcoming. In that case the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tawarah </span>go forward.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">EI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Abdeh, forty-five hours from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nukhl</span>, is the next<br/>
station. Some adjacent ruins mark the site of Eboda.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nirhdar </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ruhaibeh</span>, five hours. Wells are found here.<br/>
Some neighbouring ruins are thought to be the possible site<br/>
of Rehoboth (Gen. xxvi. <span style="color: #ff0000;">22</span>).<br/>
<br/>
From this <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidy</span>, Gaza (Ghuzzeh) (see p. 282) can be<br/>
reached in thirteen hours<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khulassah </span>is near the site of ancient Elusa, <span style="color: #ff0000;">mentioned<br/>
<br/>
</span>by Ptolemy, a large city where Venus was the tutelary goddess. The ruins are very extensive.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bir-es-Seba</span>' is ancient Beersheba. Here are wells of<br/>
very remote antiquity. It was called Beersheba, "the Well of<br/>
the O'ath, because there Abraham and Abimelech sware both<br/>
of them "( Gen. xxvi. 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>). According to other accounts, it is<br/>
the "Well of Seven "( Heb. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheba</span>, seven), referring to the<br/>
"seven ewe lambs" set apart on that occasion. The two<br/>
principal wells can be seen from a considerable distance.<br/>
They are about a hundred yards apart on the northern bank<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-es-Sebh</span>. The larger of these wells is <span style="color: #0000FF;">12</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feet </span>in diameter, and when Dr. Robinson visited it, it was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">44l </span>feet to the surface of the water. The surrounding<br/>
