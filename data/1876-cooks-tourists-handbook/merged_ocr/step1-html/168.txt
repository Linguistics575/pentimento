various pictures, the temple was built while the one as king<br/>
and the other as prince, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>associated together. In the<br/>
long passage-like chamber to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">south </span>of the Great Hall,<br/>
are scenes representing the Dedication of the Temple. The<br/>
presentation of offerings to Amman, Horus and Osiris is<br/>
represented in the first, second, and fourth tablets on the<br/>
east wall, and to a grand galaxy of <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">30 </span>deities on the third<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[<br/>
</span>On the west wall are also four tablets, the third of which is<br/>
the important New Tablet <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Abydos<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Sethi the king<br/>
and Rameses the prince are here shown, one making the<br/>
offering of fire and the other reading the sacred hymn, before<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartouches* </span>of seventy-six kings, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manes</span>, the<br/>
founder of the kingdom, to Sethi, then reigning. These<br/>
seventy-six monarchs were doubtless those more particularly<br/>
connected with Abydos. The value to Egyptologists of this<br/>
monumental record is beyond question.<br/>
<br/>
In the seven vaulted <span style="color: #0000FF;">naves</span>, the pictures represent the<br/>
successive ceremonies performed by the king in worshipping<br/>
there-unveiling the statue of the god, offering incense, recovering the statue, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
Of the Temple of Rameses II. (sometimes called<br/>
the Temple of Osiris), built by that monarch when himself<br/>
on the throne, little remains but a portion of the outer walls.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hence </span>was taken the mutilated Tablet of Abydos, now in<br/>
the British Museum, considered to be a copy of the new<br/>
tablet above <span style="color: #0000FF;">described..<br/>

in his Itin√©raire, "we reach a large, crude brick enclosure.<br/>
Here stood Thinis, the cradle of Egyptian monarchy, and<br/>
the place where was situated the tomb of Osiris-a sanc<br/>
. The cartouches, sometimes called ovals or shields, are the elliptical frames, <span style="color: #0000FF;">enclosing </span>groups of signs <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical </span>of royal names.<br/>
