especially Ptolemy III. and Euergates. On the exterior<br/>
walls are many sculptures dating from the reigns of the<br/>
Roman Emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Domitian, Trajan, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The temple, and other buildings in connection with it,<br/>
must once have covered the greater part of the island, around<br/>
which ran a smooth stone quay. Only portions of the quay<br/>
now remain, and desolate gaps, with piles of broken stones<br/>
intervene between the portions of the temple still in existence. There is a great want of uniformity in the plan of<br/>
the temple, which appears to disgust some visitors, and<br/>
enchant others. Some have complained that "the effect<br/>
is sadly spoiled by the perverse irregularity and unsymmetrical arrangement of all Egyptian architecture, which is nowhere shown more broadly than at Philae." Fergusson,<br/>
taking an opposite view, says, "No Gothic architect in his<br/>
wildest moments ever played so freely with his lines and<br/>
dimensions, and none, it must be added, ever produced anything so beautifully picturesque as this. It contains all the<br/>
play of light and shade, all the variety of Gothic art, with<br/>
the massiveness and grandeur of the Egyptian style, and as<br/>
it is still tolerably entire, and retains much of its colour,<br/>
there is no building out of Thebes that gives so favourable<br/>
an impression of Egyptian art as this. It is true it is far<br/>
less sublime than many, but hardly one can be quoted as<br/>
more beautiful."<br/>
<br/>
The temple is approached by a colonnade commencing<br/>
at the southern end of the island, and principally erected by<br/>
Tiberius; the line of columns following the curves of the<br/>
shore. Many of the columns were never completed, the<br/>
capitals being still uncarved. Passing mounds of ruins and<br/>
fragments of an enormous lion, the massive propylon is<br/>
reached (60 ft. high and <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>broad). Figures of the god<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ilus</span>, and emblems of various Egyptian towns are sculptured<br/>
