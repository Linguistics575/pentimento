<br/>
During the greater part of the year the climate of Egypt<br/>
is very healthy. In April and May the hot south wind<br/>
called the Khamseen is oppressive and insalubrious. After<br/>
the inundation in autumn, dysentery and ophthalmia and.<br/>
other complaints often result from the exhalations from the<br/>
soil. The heat of summer is not often oppressive, as the<br/>
atmosphere is exceedingly dry, and there is generally a refreshing breeze from the north. Upper Egypt, though<br/>
hotter, is more healthy than the Delta. Lower Egypt has<br/>
rain occasionally, but Upper Egypt is an almost totally rainless district.<br/>
<br/>
The average temperature of Lower Egypt ranges between<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">80° </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">poo </span>in summer, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">50° </span>and 60° in winter <span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>and that<br/>
of Upper Egypt between <span style="color: #0000FF;">90° </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">100° </span>in summer and <span style="color: #0000FF;">60°<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">too </span>in winter.<br/>

The plague was once a terrible scourge in Egypt, as in<br/>
other Eastern countries, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>owing to the precautions taken<br/>
by the Government, it has not made its appearance since<br/>
1843.<br/>
