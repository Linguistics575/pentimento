<br/>
site of ancient Pharbaethus. The French Commission<br/>
found some remains of Egyptian statuary here. Nothing<br/>
now remains but one or two broken columns. El Booka;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Alma </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shekooh</span>. Hence fish from Lake Menzaleh is sent by<br/>
rail to Cairo and elsewhere. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sembellawein</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Mansoorah (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">238</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The river must now be crossed by ferry to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah</span>.<br/>
The stations passed before reaching Damietta are <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shirbeen<br/>
</span>and Kafr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Terrash</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Damietta (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">238</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Another route is by Cairo to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah</span>, on the line to<br/>
Alexandria (see p. 80), and thence by the branch line to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah</span>, and forward to Damietta, as in route above. This<br/>
route is only <span style="color: #0000FF;">126</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>miles, and saves the inconvenience of<br/>
ferrying across the river at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah</span>.<br/>

CAIRO TO SYRIA BY MOUNT SINAI,<br/>
'AKABAH, AND PETRA.<br/>
<br/>
(The Long Desert Route.)<br/>
<br/>
From Cairo to Suez by railway (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">215</span>). Those who<br/>
wish to get as much desert as possible can engage camels at<br/>
Cairo, and travel eighty-two miles among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dies </span>and<br/>
sandhills, occupying four extra days at a considerable increase of expense. This route crosses the elevated plain of<br/>
El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muggreh</span>, and threads the defile of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfalrtala</span>. It is<br/>
an uninteresting journey, and water is very scarce.<br/>
