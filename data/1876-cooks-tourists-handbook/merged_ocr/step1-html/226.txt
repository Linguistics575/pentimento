<br/>
on, the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashdor </span>are seen and left<br/>
behind, and occasional views of the Nile and Arabian Hills<br/>
are enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kafr-el-1yat</span>, and a few other places<br/>
of little importance, where, at each halt, children cluster<br/>
round, (in spite of savage demonstrations from the officials,)<br/>
and offer <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>sale, water, or bunches of beans, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>in about<br/>
three hours El Wasta is <span style="color: #0000FF;">reached</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span>Wasta (<span style="color: #0000FF;">55 </span>miles from Cairo) is the junction for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh</span>, the chief town in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém</span>. Here <span style="color: #0000FF;">the.train<br/>
</span>from Upper Egypt must be waited for for some three hours'<br/>
on its arrival the branch train will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched</span>. There is<br/>
a fine view from near the station of the False Pyramid<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">rss</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The plain of the Nile'is now crossed nearly at right<br/>
angles to the previous course, towards the gap seen in the<br/>
Libyan Hills towards the West. <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or</span>. a time cultivated land<br/>
is crossed; villages are seen with their palm-groves. One<br/>
curious village, with innumerable pointed turrets for <span style="color: #ff0000;">pigeonhouses</span>, lies near the railway. After a time the cultivated<br/>
land, influenced by the Nile, is left behind, and a few miles<br/>
of desert crossed. "In scarcely more time," says a recent<br/>
traveller, "than is required to write these words, we found<br/>
ourselves in a bare yellow waste, and all the rich land of life<br/>
lying in a diminishing belt behind us. Some low ridges<br/>
soon hid it wholly from our view; a vast plain of gravel<br/>
dotted with stony <span style="color: #0000FF;">hummocks</span>, and pools of sand, where in<br/>
living regions one would look for water, stretched to the sky<br/>
on all sides. The air took on a sudden freshness and purity;<br/>
the life within me beat more joyously from its contrast with<br/>
the external lifelessness<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>it was the perfect atmosphere of<br/>
the desert at last! But to inhale it, thus, from the open<br/>
windows of a railway car, to see the yellow ridges appear,<br/>
