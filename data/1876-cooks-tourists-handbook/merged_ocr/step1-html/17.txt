It will be observed that the Egyptian and Turkish moneys<br/>
of the same denominations, do not correspond in value. In<br/>
Turkish money-<br/>
An English sovereign is equal to <span style="color: #0000FF;">121 </span>piastres.<br/>
<br/>
An English crown-piece "<span style="color: #0000FF;">30 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n<br/>

</span>Many other kinds of money circulate in Egypt and Turkey,<br/>
but strangers will do well to adhere to the above, in preference<br/>
to Russian, Austrian, Spanish, and various other coins, most of<br/>
which are very perplexing. English and French gold and silver<br/>
will be accepted in all chief places in the East.<br/>
<br/>
PASSPORTS<br/>
<br/>
With Turkish <span style="color: #0000FF;">visa</span>, are absolutely necessary for visiting<br/>
Turkish dominions; and they are useful in order to procure<br/>
admission to certain places of interest, to obtain letters from the<br/>
Poste Restante, and to establish identity whenever required.<br/>
Messrs. Cook and Son will obtain passports with the necessary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">visas </span>of foreign ambassadors or consuls, on receipt <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the usual<br/>
letter of identification, signed by any magistrate or justice of<br/>
the peace, or by any minister of religion of whatever denomination, physician, surgeon, solicitor, banker, or notary, resident<br/>
in the United Kingdom. The total cost, including <span style="color: #ff0000;">oisa </span>of the<br/>
T urkish Consul, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">55</span>.<br/>

<br/>
</span>It is always desirable in travelling to dispense with<br/>
unnecessary luggage, at the same time it is necessary to be<br/>
well supplied, especially if the journey is to be prolonged for<br/>
months. For gentlemen, light tweed suits, and a flannel suit,<br/>
with a suit of darker material for wearing on particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">ocCasions</span>, this latter is of course not absolutely necessary, but some<br/>
