<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">246 </span>THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
THE PENINSULA OF MOUNT SINAI<br/>
<br/>
is bounded by the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of'Akabah,<br/>
and by a line drawn across the northern extremities of those<br/>
two gulfs. Entering at the north-west, for two days the<br/>
journey is across a hard gravel formation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>which the<br/>
caravan track is distinctly visible. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">252</span>) the scene changes, and the journey is amongst low<br/>
hills in very varied combination. The term <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy</span>, of incessant recurrence in the Sinaitic journey, expresses a watercourse, either with or without water. It is a very comprehensive term, and may mean a mere depression two inches<br/>
deep, or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">gorge </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hemmed </span>in by mountains. At the end<br/>
of the fourth day the plains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Markhah</span>, by the Red<br/>
Sea, are reached. Turning from these, eastward at any<br/>
point, the mountain district is immediately entered. Now<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>every hand are huge limestone and sandstone cliffs, at the<br/>
base of which lie boulders large and small, of every variety<br/>
and colour of granite, evidently swept down by floods at<br/>
periods more or less remote. But though mostly ascending,<br/>
the ease of the progress is very striking. At the Convent of<br/>
St. Catherine (p. 258) the visitor will have attained a height<br/>
of 5000 feet above the sea-level, and yet only in two or three<br/>
instances will any very obvious ascent have been accomplished in the progress thither. It is said, indeed, that a<br/>
railroad of easy grades could be laid down along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédies<br/>
</span>from end to end of the Peninsula at comparatively <span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
</span>cost. Although deep, the mountain <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédies </span>are generally<br/>
level, often as smooth as a floor. They vary in width from<br/>
a quarter of a mile to a hundred yards or so, but are seldom<br/>
<br/>
a mile, and often not a quarter of a mile in the same <span style="color: #ff0000;">direc<br/>
</span>tion. The Sinaitic peninsula is not a series of consecutive<br/>
<br/>
mountain ranges, but a conglomeration of mountain <span style="color: #ff0000;">spurs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
