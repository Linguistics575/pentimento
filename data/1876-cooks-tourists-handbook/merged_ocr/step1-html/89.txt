<span>ALEXANDRIA TO CAIRO. <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6<br/>
<br/>
</span>a notable town in mediaeval times, and several other small<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dessbok </span>is noted for the Festival of Sheikh Ibraheem<br/>
ed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dessookee</span>, second only to him of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>amongst<br/>
Egyptian saints. Passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramaneah</span>, the mounds that once<br/>
were Sais, the capital of Egypt just before the Persian<br/>
invasion, are seen. Excavations have been made, but not<br/>
even plan or position of anything can be determined-all is<br/>
utter <span style="color: #ff0000;">ruin-burnt </span>bricks and rubbish and fragments of<br/>
sculpture scarcely worth naming, are all that remain of the<br/>
city whose splendid temples and obelisks are commemorated<br/>
by Herodotus. Here once a year all Egypt flocked to keep<br/>
the Festival of Burning Lamps, when every house was<br/>
illuminated outside with lamps that burned till daybreak.<br/>
Here also were shown the "mysteries" representing the<br/>
sufferings of Osiris, strongly reminding us of the "Passion<br/>
Plays "of later ages.<br/>
<br/>
A mile or two above Werdan the first glimpse of the<br/>
Pyramids is obtained, though twenty miles off, yet distinctly<br/>
seen through the clear atmosphere. Before reaching Cairo,<br/>
the great engineering failure known as the Barrage of the<br/>
Nile (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">say</span>) is passed.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo (see p. 83).<br/>
<br/>
III. By Rail.<br/>
<br/>
By Rail from Alexandria to Cairo the distance is 131<br/>
miles, and is got over by the ordinary trains in under seven<br/>
hours; by the express, once daily, in under five hours. The<br/>
railway was constructed in <span style="color: #ff0000;">18 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The first-class carriages are good, and only differ from<br/>
ordinary carriages in England by having a double top, painted<br/>
white, and allowing a free passage of air for the sake of coolness.<br/>
