<span>252 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
Of the three routes leading from <span style="color: #ff0000;">WMy-ed-Dehseh </span>to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>, the central route is mostly chosen, through<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidy </span>Sadur, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wardén</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amérah</span>.<br/>
In the latter valley are seen the group of rocks called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hagarel-Rekkab</span>, or Stone of the Rider.<br/>
<br/>
Ain <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawarah </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fountain </span>of Destruction) is usually<br/>
identified with Marah, where the bitter waters were made<br/>
sweet; a few stunted palms and tamarisks surround a stone<br/>
well, filled with drifted sand, but still containing water.<br/>
The small cultivated plot called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Engee-el-Fool </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span>the<br/>
Bean <span style="color: #0000FF;">Field</span>") is passed, and soon afterwards the traveller enters<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Niriidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>, which has a beautiful stream<br/>
running through it. Compared with the desolate scenery<br/>
round, this valley seems a marvel of beauty. A fresh supply<br/>
of sweet water is procured for the caravan at this place,<br/>
which is doubtless the Elim of which the Bible narrative<br/>
states that "there were twelve wells of water, and threescore<br/>
and ten palm-trees, and they encamped there by the waters."<br/>
The acacia or <span style="color: #0000FF;">shittim-wood </span>of the Bible grows here, and is<br/>
often met with in pursuing the journey. It is a tough<br/>
gnarled and thorny tree, adapting itself to various situations,<br/>
low and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>on the open desert, and more outspread in <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheltered </span>spots.<br/>
<br/>
The Baths of Pharaoh, at the mouth of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>, near the sea, are some hot sulphur springs said<br/>
by Arab traditions to arise from the watery grave of Pharaoh<br/>
and his host. Above the hot springs towers the mountain<br/>
Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hammém </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharoon</span>, 1500 feet high.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mirsidy </span>Useit, which is reached after crossing the<br/>
plain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span>Gargal, has a fountain, and palm trees are<br/>
numerous. The rocks are very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>some exactly resemble<br/>
fortresses and battlements. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lady </span>Ethal and the<br/>
mouth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shebeikah </span>are next passed. Here a<br/>
