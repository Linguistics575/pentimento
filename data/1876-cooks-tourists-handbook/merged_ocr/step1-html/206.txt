<br/>
</span>The cataracts are simply rapids produced by the waters of<br/>
the river dashing through a wild profusion of scattered<br/>
rocks. In fact, the two chains of primitive mountains,<br/>
between which the Nile flows, cross the bed of the river at<br/>
this point and impede its course by forming <span style="color: #0000FF;">innumerable<br/>
</span>rocky points or islands. These rocks in grotesque shapes<br/>
and wild disorder, with the absence of cultivation beside the<br/>
scene, and the murmur of the struggling waters, combine to<br/>
make up a scene of savage desolation, about four miles in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">length</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Ascent of the Cataract in a dahabeah can be<br/>
effected by those who think the excitement rather than the<br/>
pleasure of the undertaking worth the expense. It is an<br/>
interesting process to watch from the adjacent rocks, and it<br/>
is also very amusing to see the N ubian boys threading the<br/>
rapids on logs of wood. (For Descent of Cataract, see p. 196.)<br/>
<br/>
From Assouan to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>the scenery is of a wildness<br/>
almost unearthly, Miss Martineau calls it "fantastic and<br/>
impish." The <span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>route is to the convent of the Austrian<br/>
Mission, where boat is taken for the island. At other times,<br/>
when the Nile is less high and less rapid, the road is taken<br/>
to the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chellal</span>. This is the most picturesque route<br/>
when practicable. Considerable time is saved by taking a<br/>
boat from Assouan to the foot of the cataract, and then<br/>
taking the road<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the remarkable shapes of the granite rocks<br/>
and fragments of ruins <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>well seen in this route as in<br/>
the former.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>going from Assouan to Philas, abundant examples<br/>
are seen of the ancient Egyptian custom of leaving monumental inscriptions and tableaux to mark their progress<br/>
through certain places. In several of these a simple name<br/>
is carved in hieroglyphics on the rocks, in other places the<br/>
individual who wished to commemorate his journey is re<br/>
<br/>
