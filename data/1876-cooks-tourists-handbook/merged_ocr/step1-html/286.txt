<span>268 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
route of the Israelites from Sinai towards Palestine (<span style="color: #ff0000;">see</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>Numb. xi., xii.) After the long rest at Sinai, the people<br/>
again began to murmur at the difficulties of the journey.<br/>
At Taberah, which was probably in the rough country, near<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">watershed</span>, "the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>of the Lord burnt among them."<br/>
Then they murmured for flesh, and quails were sent, and<br/>
also a plague that destroyed many. This was at a place<br/>
which they called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kibroath </span>Hattaavah, the Graves of Lust.<br/>
Palmer identifies the spot as in the region where he found<br/>
remains of an ancient encampment, surrounded by numerous graves. Arab tradition says it was the encampment of<br/>
an immense pilgrim host many ages ago. At Hazeroth,<br/>
which is identified with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Huderah</span>, Miriam was smitten with<br/>
leprosy for joining with Aaron in sedition against Moses.<br/>
The course of the Israelites from this point is exceedingly<br/>
doubtful.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nirhdy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wetir </span>is a very romantic and beautiful<br/>
valley, with many sharp turns. Vast and exquisitely coloured<br/>
mountains encompass it.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mriidy-el-Ain </span>a stream Bows between groves<br/>
of palm and tamarisk. This is probably the most wonderful<br/>
glen on the peninsula. Mountains of granite hem it in,<br/>
abruptly rising to a height of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand </span>feet, often only<br/>
fifty feet from each other at the bases, and about two<br/>
hundred feet apart at the summits. The colours are brown<br/>
and red in every possible combination, with frequent dykes<br/>
of dark porphyry stretched ribbon-like across the cliffs.<br/>
The stream flows on for a few miles and then disappears in<br/>
the sand. About an hour after reaching the sea the traveller<br/>
arrives at the palm and tamarisk groves of'Ain <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nuweibi'a</span>.<br/>
<br/>
For two days the journey lies along <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>shore of the<br/>
gulf, which is here from five to eight miles wide. On each<br/>
side rise lofty mountain ranges, sometimes approaching the<br/>
