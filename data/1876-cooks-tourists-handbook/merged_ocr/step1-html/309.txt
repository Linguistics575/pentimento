<span>HEBRON. 29 I<br/>
<br/>
territory is referred to by the phrase, "from Beersheba to<br/>
the valley of Hinnom" (Neh. xi. 43). Idolatrous worship<br/>
was carried on here in the time of Amos. In v. 4, <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>, the<br/>
prophet exhorts Israel to seek the Lord, and "pass not to<br/>
Beersheba," and in viii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">14</span>, he declares that "they that<br/>
swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dan</span>,<br/>
liveth; or, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall<br/>
fall, and never rise up again." From the time of the return<br/>
from the Captivity, there is no mention of this place in the<br/>
Bible records. It was a place of some importance in the<br/>
time of Jerome, and subsequently became an episcopal see<br/>
under the Bishop of Jerusalem.<br/>
