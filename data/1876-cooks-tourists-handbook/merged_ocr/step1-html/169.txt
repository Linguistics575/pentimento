<span>ABYDOS. 153<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tuary </span>as venerated by the ancient Egyptians as the Holy<br/>
Sepulchre by Christians" In this enclosure is a mound<br/>
called the Kom-es-Sultan, formed of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">débris </span>of myriads<br/>
of tombs through successive ages. <span style="color: #ff0000;">M</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Mariette hopes to<br/>
find, through the excavations now in progress, the tomb of<br/>
Osiris beneath this mound. "The rich and powerful of the<br/>
Egyptians," says Plutarch, "are desirous <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'being </span>buried at<br/>
Abydos, in order to be, as it were, in the same grave with<br/>
Osiris himself." It is conjectured that it is the graves of these<br/>
worthies that have gradually formed the mound just described.<br/>
<br/>
The Necropolis, from which four-fifths of the stelae<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boulék </span>Museum, and many other objects, were<br/>
derived, is so completely altered and overturned as to present<br/>
little of interest to the general visitor. The tombs are chiefly<br/>
of the sixth dynasty (3700 mc.), the twelfth dynasty (<span style="color: #ff0000;">3000<br/>
</span>mc.), and the thirteenth dynasty (2800 mc.) Those of the<br/>
latter epoch are mostly in the form of a pyramid of crude<br/>
brick, the interior being hollowed out into a cupola. But<br/>
amongst the earliest tombs (sixth dynasty) in this Necropolis,<br/>
a vaulted roof with a true arch, with bricks specially formed<br/>
for its construction, is not unfrequent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshoot </span>(368 miles from Cairo) contains another of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s sugar factories. This district is inhabited by<br/>
descendants of the once powerful <span style="color: #ff0000;">Howéra </span>Arabs.<br/>
<br/>
From Girgeh to Keneh the scenery is in many parts very<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>fine. Theban palms, dates, and acacias <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>abundant; Indian<br/>
corn, sugar-cane, and various leguminous herbs, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ing <span style="color: #0000FF;">luxuriantly </span>over the fertile land that delights the eye<br/>
with its perpetual greenness. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Numerous </span>small places are<br/>
passed-amongst them <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bajoora </span>(W.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">How </span>(W., anciently<br/>
Diospolis Parva), Kasr es <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sydd</span>, the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chenoboscion</span>,<br/>
formerly celebrated for its geese and now the largest <span style="color: #0000FF;">depth </span>of<br/>
turkeys on the Nile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dishneh </span>(W.) and Fow (E.)<br/>
