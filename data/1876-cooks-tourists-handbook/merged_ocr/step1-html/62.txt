attest the grandeur of Egyptian civilization and culture in<br/>
this period. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoofoo</span>, or Cheops, the victorious conqueror<br/>
of Northern Arabia, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shaphra</span>, or Cephrenes, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menkeoora</span>, or Mycerinus, reared the three Pyramids at Ghizeh<br/>
which bear their names.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">As </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">regards </span>the position in the Ancient Empire of the<br/>
Fourth Dynasty," says Mariette Bey, in his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aperqu </span>de<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l'Histoire </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">d'Egyple</span>, "it may without hesitation be assumed<br/>
to mark the culminating point. At this epoch a sudden<br/>
and extraordinary impulse is evident. Egypt henceforth is<br/>
free from all her shackles, and displays the prodigies of<br/>
a civilization without a parallel in the whole world at that<br/>
period. Egyptian society is now definitely constituted. Art<br/>
has reached its full development, and attained to a height<br/>
scarcely surpassed in the most brilliant ages of the world.<br/>
Cities are founded, and the country divided into large<br/>
farms. Thousands of cattle are reared, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">antelopes</span>,<br/>
storks, etc., domesticated. The carefully cultured land yields<br/>
abundant harvests. The dwelling-houses are of elegant<br/>
architecture. There the master of the house lives, beloved<br/>
and respected among his own people. He cultivates his<br/>
flowers, or watches the games and dances performed for<br/>
his amusement. He hunts, or fishes in the numerous canals<br/>
that intersect the country. Upon the bosom of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile<br/>
</span>float large square-sailed vessels, carrying on an active <span style="color: #0000FF;">commerce</span>. Egypt appears now in the blossoming of a vigorous<br/>
youth, and full of sap. That admirable statue of Cephrenes,<br/>
in the Museum with which S. A. Ismail Pasha has enriched<br/>
science-still, in spite of six thousand years, one of the<br/>
choicest examples of Egyptian sculpture-is it not a work<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fourth </span>Dynasty? And are not the Pyramids, which<br/>
antiquity numbered amongst the Seven Wonders of the<br/>
World, also of this epoch? "<br/>
