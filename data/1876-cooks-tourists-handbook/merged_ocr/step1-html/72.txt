<br/>
tude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,<br/>
saith the Lord God "( ver. 31). We may probably find the<br/>
fulfilment of this sublime prophecy in the circumstance that<br/>
the deep sufferings that now for more than <span style="color: #ff0000;">2000 </span>years have<br/>
overwhelmed Egypt have not extinguished her national<br/>
identity, and blotted her out from the face of the earth, the<br/>
fate which has <span style="color: #ff0000;">befallen </span>all the other kingdoms which the<br/>
prediction enumerates. Though the prey of every spoiler,<br/>
though trampled to the very dust, she still remains Egypt,<br/>
and still affords shelter to a miserable remnant that is<br/>
descended from her ancient inhabitants."<br/>
<br/>
In Matt. ii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">13</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">15 </span>is found the brief narrative of the<br/>
circumstances which fulfilled the prophecy, "Out of Egypt<br/>
have I called my Son," when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infant </span>Saviour was guarded<br/>
from the malice of evil men by his watchful parents,<br/>
and brought back to his native land when Herod was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dead</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>
</span>Although the "Burden of Egypt," as set forth by Isaiah<br/>
(chap. xix.) is in great part a picture of calamity and desolation, yet it may be remembered with comfort by any who<br/>
mourn over the present state of the land of Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>that it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">concludes </span>thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">y</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span>" In that day shall Israel be the third with<br/>
Egypt, and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the<br/>
land, whom the Lord of Hosts, shall bless, saying, Blessed<br/>
be Egypt, my people, and Assyria the work of my hands,<br/>
and Israel mine inheritance."<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the historical and prophetical allusions to<br/>
Egypt above referred to, the Bible has abundant allusions to<br/>
Egyptian matters. The land is a fertile one <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>described in<br/>
Gen. xiii. IO, and "the cucumbers, and the melons, and the<br/>
leeks, and the onions, and the garlic," are abundant now<br/>
as when Israel longed for them (Numb. xi. 5), Egyptian<br/>
irrigation is accurately described in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dent</span>. xi. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>, a land<br/>
