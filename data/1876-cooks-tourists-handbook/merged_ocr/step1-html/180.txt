<br/>
of time, of which history keeps the reckoning, roll before<br/>
them; they have seen kingdoms and nations rise and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fall-the </span>Babylonians, the Jews, the Persians, the Greeks, and the<br/>
Romans. They have seen the childhood of all that we call<br/>
ancient, and they seem likely to stand to tell their tale to<br/>
those who will hereafter call us the ancients."<br/>
<br/>
Under the name of No, or No-Ammon, Thebes is several<br/>
times referred to by the sacred writers. "I will punish the<br/>
multitude of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>," is the denunciation of Jeremiah (xlvi. 25).<br/>
"I will execute judgments in No."... "I will cut off the<br/>
multitude of No."... <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>No shall be rent <span style="color: #0000FF;">asunder</span>," are<br/>
part of the burden of Ezekiel in the 14th, 15th, and 16th<br/>
verses of chap. xxx. In Nahum iii. 8, the Prophet <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ahum</span>,<br/>
addressing Nineveh, asks, "Art thou better than populous<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters<br/>
round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>from the sea? "See also following verses. How<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">severely </span>No, or Thebes, has been "rent asunder," and<br/>
suffered from judgments of various kinds, must be apparent to every observer.<br/>
<br/>
In Jer. xlvi., the phrase, "multitude of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>," should be<br/>
"Ammon of No," referring to the divinity Ammon-ra, worshipped in <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>city.<br/>
