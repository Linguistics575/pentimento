<span>KOROSKO. 20 I<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian fortifications are seen on the opposite side of the<br/>
river. Dakkeh was the head-quarters of the renowned<br/>
Ethiopian magi.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koortee </span>(W.) A few <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>are discernible here.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maharraker </span>(W.) has a picturesque little temple. All is<br/>
overthrown except two rows of columns.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sabodah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or Valley of the Lions, so-called<br/>
from the dromos of sphinxes once leading <span style="color: #ff0000;">up-to </span>a temple of<br/>
Rameses, constructed of granite, with the sanctuary excavated in the solid rock. The avenue has almost entirely disappeared. Of the temple, the two towers of the pylon, the<br/>
Osiride columns of the area, and the interior chambers, still<br/>
remain. Here the Arabic language ceases to be spoken, and<br/>
the Nubian only is in use.<br/>
<br/>
Korosko (E.), though a considerable place of traffic, is<br/>
scarcely even a village. There are a few scattered huts along<br/>
the foot of the mountain, in a green oasis of a valley.<br/>
Black, frowning precipices enclose the gorge through <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>lies the desert route to Shendy and Sennaar. This is a starting-point for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartoum</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>route, 200 miles in length, is<br/>
one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">worst.in </span>the desert-water being only procurable<br/>
at one stopping-place, and wild Bedouins very troublesome.<br/>
The mountain is of a most curious shape, and is of volcanic<br/>
origin. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">peak'f </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Awes-el-Guarany </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>is held sacred by<br/>
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage as being the tomb<br/>
of the saint from whom the mountain derives its name.<br/>
There are innumerable tablets and inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">here'record</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>the names of pilgrims. Sometimes those of one family<br/>
through many generations. The steamer stops long enough<br/>
to allow for the ascent of the peak to be made-rather a<br/>
difficult task, as the steep path is strewn with volcanic <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>remains. The journey will however well repay the fatigue,<br/>
more especially if sunrise or sunset can be seen at the same<br/>
time. The View is magnificent, comprehending the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile<br/>
<br/>
