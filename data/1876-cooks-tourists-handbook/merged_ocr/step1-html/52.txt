the Rosetta branch of the Nile. A railway from Rosetta to<br/>
Alexandria is in construction, also a direct line to Port Said<br/>
from the Alexandria-Suez line. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>these projects are<br/>
completed no part of the Delta will be more than 20 miles<br/>
from a railway.<br/>
<br/>
The Upper Egypt railway is complete as far as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>.<br/>
There is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>mile branch to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh</span>, capital of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayoém</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A small railway is now being worked round the First<br/>
Cataract, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>and saves several days in the transport<br/>
of goods, etc., between Egypt and the Soudan.<br/>
<br/>
A railway is in course of construction from <span style="color: #ff0000;">WédyHalfa</span>, following the Nile, through Nubia to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edabbe</span>, ahd<br/>
then crossing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bayuda </span>desert to a terminus near the<br/>
junction of the White and Blue Niles, about eighty miles<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartoum</span>. This railway will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">523 </span>miles in length;<br/>
the gradients are very easy, and the cost of construction<br/>
will not be great. Wells of water are numerous along the<br/>
proposed route.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a project on foot for eventually continuing<br/>
the above line to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartoum</span>, and then along the northern<br/>
base of the Abyssinian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Highlands </span>to the Red Sea. It is<br/>
believed that if this railway system is completed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passengers<br/>
</span>to India would be able, by going direct by rail from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>to Massowah, to save three or four days' time, and<br/>
avoid the temperature of the Red Sea, so much dreaded by<br/>
most passengers to India.<br/>
<br/>
