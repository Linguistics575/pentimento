<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
the Valley of the Queens, where, in strict propriety, those<br/>
royal ladies are buried by themselves. This valley is of<br/>
little interest, except to the student of <span style="color: #0000FF;">heiroglyphics</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Dayr-el-Bahree rests against the slopes of the<br/>
Libyan Mountains, on the outer edge of the Necropolis. It<br/>
is a monument to the glory of Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasou</span>, who was for<br/>
a time Regent of Egypt for her brother Thothmes m., and<br/>
for a time ruled in her own right.<br/>
<br/>
The plan of the temple is different from that of any<br/>
other in Egypt. The courts are at different levels up the<br/>
mountain side, connected by inclined planes. The temple<br/>
is approached by the broken remains of what was once an<br/>
avenue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sphinxes </span>and the pedestals of two vanished<br/>
obelisks. In the interior chambers, and at the back of the<br/>
temple, are some fine sculptures.<br/>
<br/>
The original intention of this temple seems to have been<br/>
soon changed. As early as the twenty-second dynasty it<br/>
was used for sepulchral purposes. In one chamber Ptolemaic<br/>
mummies were found piled up nearly to the ceiling above<br/>
the mummies of Pharaonic times.<br/>
<br/>
The remains of Thebes on the eastern bank of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
</span>will next be described. These consist almost exclusively of<br/>
Luxor and Karnak.<br/>
<br/>
Luxor is a capital approach to Karnak. Courts, and<br/>
columns, and statues, and ruins are mingled in splendid confusion. One lonely obelisk stands erect, its companion<br/>
having been removed to the Place de la Concorde at Paris.<br/>
The Temple of Luxor was built under the eighteenth<br/>
dynasty in the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span>III. (1600 mc.) The<br/>
lofty colonnade on the river-bank was added in the reign of<br/>
Horus (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1480 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.), whilst the great court, with two obelisks,<br/>
the colossal statues, and the pylon were added by Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>.<br/>
In the interior, the names of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tirhakeh</span>, and Psammetichus,<br/>
