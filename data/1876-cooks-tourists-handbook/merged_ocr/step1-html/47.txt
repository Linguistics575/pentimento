corded amongst the Mosaic plagues are still most unpleasantly numerous in the Egyptian land.<br/>
<br/>
Amongst the trees and plants of Egypt many European<br/>
varieties flourish. Date palms, doom palms, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>,<br/>
tamarisks, acacias, etc., are the most noticeable. The lotus,<br/>
or water-lily of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, conspicuous in the ornamentation<br/>
of the old temples and tombs, and used for making a sort of<br/>
bread now, as in the days of Herodotus, is a noticeable object<br/>
in the Delta, when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>is at full height. The papyrus,<br/>
from whose delicate white pith the ancients made paper, has<br/>
become scarce, and according to some extinct. There are<br/>
very doubtful rumours of its existence in some <span style="color: #0000FF;">out-of-the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>spots. "The lotus and papyrus," says Dr. Samuel Manning, in his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>of the Pharaohs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>were formerly the most common of its<br/>
products, insomuch that they formed the symbols of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt. The papyrus was used not only for making paper, to which it<br/>
gave its name, but for the construction of boats, baskets, and innumerable other articles; as in the Upper Jordan <span style="color: #ff0000;">V </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">alley</span>, where it still<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">g </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rows </span>abundantly, even cottages were built with it. No religious<br/>
service, no state ceremonial, no domestic festival is found without the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus-flower</span>. It forms part of every offering to the gods. The guests<br/>
at a banquet all held one in their hands. It is, perhaps, the object of<br/>
all others most constantly represented on the monuments. Yet both<br/>
the lotus and papyrus have disappeared from Egypt. No trace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">either</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>can be found. Unaccountable as is the disappearance of these plants,<br/>
it was yet foretold by the Prophet Isaiah, as a part of the Divine <span style="color: #0000FF;">judge<br/>
</span>ment upon Egypt <span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span>' The brooks of defence shall be emptied <span style="color: #0000FF;">ind </span>dried<br/>
