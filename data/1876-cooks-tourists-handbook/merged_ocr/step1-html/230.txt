<span>2 14 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
The square brick Pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawiralt </span>is near<br/>
the ruins of the Labyrinth. The crumbling brick pyramid<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Illahoon </span>is about eight miles south. There is a road<br/>
from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Illahoon </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisooéf </span>(p. 137), fourteen miles.'<br/>
<br/>
Considerable interest attaches to some other places<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yoém</span>, if travellers have time to make excursions of<br/>
some length. Donkeys, tents, and all necessaries should be<br/>
taken if a night is to be spent anywhere else than at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A pleasant round through the upper plateau of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém </span>can be made from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biahnoo</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senoris</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiddimeen</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhoor</span>, and back. The scenery is in many<br/>
parts exceedingly pretty, having a pastoral character very<br/>
different from the landscapes of the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bialmoo </span>are some curious quadrangular piles of<br/>
masonry, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">zoo </span>ft. apart, and about <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>ft. square,<br/>
standing due north and <span style="color: #0000FF;">south</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>also the remains of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramid</span>. The object and date of these structures are alike<br/>
unknown.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senoris</span>, a long palm-embowered village, is a school<br/>
of the American Mission. Few converts are made from<br/>
the Copts; but the education of the young is showing signs<br/>
of being of permanent value.<br/>
<br/>
From the high ground near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senoris</span>, the eastern part of<br/>
Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Birket-el-Korn </span>is seen. The character of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scenery<br/>
</span>is thus described by Bayard Taylor: "I could not shake off<br/>
the impression that I was somewhere in Central Africa,<br/>
instead of within such easy reach of Cairo. Only out of<br/>
Ethiopia could I call similar landscapes to mind. The<br/>
hollows were deep in vegetation; the dry ridges were clothed<br/>
in thickets of euphorbia; besides palms, acacias, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sent<br/>
</span>trees, the cactus rose with a huge trunk and spreading<br/>
arms, and along the clear rapid streams there were generally<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
