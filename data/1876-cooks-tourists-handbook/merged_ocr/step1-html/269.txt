<br/>
a man, whose best garment is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">untanned </span>sheepskin, will<br/>
wear a sword, or shoulder a gun, or both, at least two of<br/>
every three of the Alewi have slung on their backs <span style="color: #0000FF;">flint.lock<br/>
</span>guns of very long barrel, often in such a condition that a<br/>
discharge, however well aimed, would be more dangerous to<br/>
the man who fires than to him who is fired at; these they<br/>
carry with them everywhere. Yet they are apparently a<br/>
cheerful, contented race, very much like the American<br/>
Negroes in their simplicity, thoughtlessness, and good<br/>
humour. Their bread is a coarse, dark, barley cake; their<br/>
dwellings are simple, low tents made of goats' hair, which<br/>
shelter from rain but in other <span style="color: #ff0000;">respectssare </span>quite uncomfortable; hence, in cold weather, they resort, if possible, to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">caves</span>. N one of them fail to understand the word <span style="color: #ff0000;">backsheesh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>it is the first word the young child learns, the last the old<br/>
man utters."<br/>

At <span style="color: #ff0000;">wsidar-eti-De11seh </span>the traveller feels that he<br/>
is really traversing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>nothing breaks the monotony<br/>
of the level stretch of sand. It is in this neighbourhood that<br/>
the Khamseen wind and sand storm have so frequently been<br/>
encountered. "Soon the Red Sea and all," says Dean<br/>
Stanley, "were lost in a sand storm which lasted the whole<br/>
day. Imagine all distant objects entirely lost to view-the<br/>
sheets of sand fleeting along the surface of the desert like<br/>
streams of water<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the whole air filled, though invisibly, with<br/>
a tempest of sand driving in your face like sleet; imagine<br/>
the caravan toiling against this-the Bedouins, each with his<br/>
shawl thrown completely over his head, half the riders sitting<br/>
backwards-the camels, meanwhile, thus virtually left without guidance, though from time to time throwing their long<br/>
necks sideways to avoid the blast, yet moving straight onwards with a painful sense of duty truly edifying to<br/>
behold."<br/>
