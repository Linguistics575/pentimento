<br/>
Mansoorah is a great cotton town. "Cotton thrusts<br/>
forth on all sides. Children are plucking it in the fields, and<br/>
singing as they gather the fleecy pods into their little blue<br/>
dresses, tucked up for pockets. From country plantations<br/>
you see camels in a long string stalk over the plain, all cotton<br/>
laden. Boats full of it are tracked along the sleepy lagoons<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, and the countless canals which intersect the<br/>
ancient land of Goshen."<br/>
<br/>
Mansoorah (pop. 16,000) is the capital of the province<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dakaleeyah</span>. There is railway communication by Zagazig with Cairo or Suez. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah</span>, on the opposite side<br/>
of the Nile, are lines to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>and Damietta. The town of<br/>
Mansoorah has no ruins, and is only of Arab creation.<br/>

Damietta (in Arabic, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dimiah</span>) is a town of 30,000 inhabitants, standing at the mouth of that branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile<br/>
</span>which beats its name. There is a Coptic bishop resident<br/>
here, and some foreign consuls. It was long the principal<br/>
emporium of the Egyptian commerce with Greece and Syria,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>as Alexandria rose Damietta fell. It is still, however,<br/>
the centre of considerable commerce. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>the interior <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
