<span>CAIRO. 91<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bitb-el-Azah</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This gate is in the form of an elliptical<br/>
arch, with two enormous brickwork towers, built in alternate<br/>
bands of red and white. Hence a narrow winding path.<br/>
leads to the highest part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Citadel.. </span>In this defile the<br/>
slaughter of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks </span>took place in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1811</span>. Only one<br/>
escaped by leaping his horse from the terrace on the eastern<br/>
platform called La Saut du Mameluke.<br/>
<br/>
Mahomed Ali <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been much alarmed by the plots of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks </span>against his authority, and resolved on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>total annihilation of the order. To compass this, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">summoned </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlook </span>Beys to Cairo, for purposes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">consul</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>tation and festivity.<br/>
<br/>
"The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bays </span>came, mounted on their finest horses, in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">maguiiicent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">uniforms</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">forming </span>the most superb cavalry in<br/>
the world. After a very flattering reception from the Pasha,<br/>
they were requested to parade in the court of the Citadel.<br/>
They entered the fortification <span style="color: #0000FF;">unsuspectingly</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">portcullis<br/>
</span>fell behind the last of the proud procession. A moment's<br/>
glance revealed to them their doom. They dashed forwards.<br/>
In vain<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>before, behind, around them, nothing was visible<br/>
but black, pitiless walls and barred <span style="color: #0000FF;">windows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the only opening was towards the bright blue sky; even that was soon<br/>
darkened by their funeral pile of smoke, as volley after<br/>
volley <span style="color: #0000FF;">flashed </span>from a thousand muskets behind the ramparts<br/>
upon their <span style="color: #0000FF;">defenseless </span>and devoted band. Startling and<br/>
fearfully sudden as was their death, they met it as became<br/>
their fearless <span style="color: #ff0000;">character-Hone </span>with arms crossed upon their<br/>
mailed bosoms, and turbaned heads devoutly bowed in<br/>
prayer<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>some with flashing swords and fierce curses, alike<br/>
unavailing against their dastard and ruthless foe. All that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chivalrous </span>and splendid throng, save one, sank rapidly <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneath </span>the deadly fire into a red and writhing mass-that one<br/>
was Emir Bey. He spurred his charger over a heap of his<br/>
<br/>
