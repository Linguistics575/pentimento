<br/>
</span>through the solid masonry, and leading to the true entrance<br/>
to the Pyramid, is now choked up with rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
At the present day the visitor enters at about forty feet<br/>
from the base of the northern side, and descends by a<br/>
massive vaulted gallery to a subterranean chamber,<br/>
347 feet from the entrance, and about 90 feet below the base<br/>
of the Pyramid. This chamber measures 46 feet by 27 feet,<br/>
and is about II feet in height. Mariette Bey argues that<br/>
the builders of the Pyramid intended this chamber to be<br/>
mistaken for the principal chamber of the Pyramid, and so<br/>
serve to conceal the real resting-place of the royal mummy.<br/>
<br/>
At rather more than sixty feet from the entrance, an<br/>
upward passage, once carefully closed with an immense<br/>
block of stone, leads towards the centre of the Pyramid.<br/>
At a distance of <span style="color: #ff0000;">125 </span>feet, it reaches what is called the Great<br/>
Gallery.<br/>
<br/>
At this point is the opening to what is called the<br/>
Well, 191 ft. deep (communicating with the subterranean<br/>
chamber above described), which was probably used for<br/>
communication with various parts by the workmen in constructing the Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
Before ascending the Great Gallery, a horizontal passage<br/>
is seen, 110 feet in length, leading to a chamber 18 feet by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span>feet, and 20 feet high, known as the Queen's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber</span>. Mariette Bey supposes that the entrance to the Great<br/>
Gallery was once hermetically sealed; so that if successful<br/>
in reaching the chamber now under notice, explorers might<br/>
be led to suppose that the whole secret of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramid </span>was<br/>
revealed<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>But the Great Gallery, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">51 </span>feet long, 7 feet wide, and<br/>
28 feet high, with a surface of smooth polished stone, leads<br/>
upwards to a vestibule once closed with immense granite<br/>
<br/>
portcullises.<br/>
