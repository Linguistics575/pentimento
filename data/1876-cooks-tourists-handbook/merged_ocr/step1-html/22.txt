TRAVELLING ARRANGEMENTS OF MESSRS.<br/>
COOK <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>SON.<br/>
<br/>
THE travelling coupons issued by Messrs. COOK & SON are<br/>
now so well known and universally used, that it is unnecessary<br/>
here to enter into particulars about them. Suffice it to say<br/>
that they have been found to be advantageous to all European<br/>
travellers, and in the East where travelling is under greater<br/>
difficulties in every respect, their system is indispensable to<br/>
those who are unable to grapple with the obstacles presented by<br/>
not being acquainted with Oriental languages, and with having<br/>
to deal with dragomans and others, whose demands are <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>variably exorbitant.<br/>
<br/>
Messrs. COOK & SON have made such arrangements in the<br/>
East, that the most inexperienced travellers may avail <span style="color: #0000FF;">them..<br/>
</span>selves of them without fear of not being able to get on as well<br/>
as in the beaten continental routes. They issue tickets for<br/>
individuals, or for small or large parties, and every season they<br/>
organize parties who travel under the personal <span style="color: #ff0000;">superintendencc<br/>
</span>of one of their admirable staff of conductors.<br/>
<br/>
It will be only necessary here to indicate some of the<br/>
arrangements which they have successfully carried out in past<br/>
seasons, and will be improved as each fresh season ensues.<br/>
Every year they publish a little book (price 6d.), giving details<br/>
of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Personally.Conducted</span>, and Independent Eastern tours,<br/>
and to this the traveller is referred, as the cost of a tour varies<br/>
according to circumstances, and general arrangements are liable<br/>
to variation.<br/>
