<br/>
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS<br/>
<br/>
have left in the records inscribed on their monuments an im.<br/>
perishable memorial of their manners and customs, modes of<br/>
life, and social condition at various epochs. A high state of<br/>
civilization, great wealth, ceaseless industry, and a fully organized state of society are clearly set forth. Modern discovery<br/>
has proved, moreover, that the ancient Egyptians were proficient in many of the arts and sciences, well skilled in<br/>
various manufactures, and successful in the pursuits of agriculture. The processes of weaving and dyeing, the working<br/>
of metals, the production of porcelain, glass, and mosaics<br/>
were all familiar to them.<br/>
<br/>
The architecture of ancient Egypt was more characterized<br/>
by massive grandeur and durability than that of any other<br/>
nation. In his Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, Mr.<br/>
Fergusson thus refers to the practice of this art by the<br/>
Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">P<br/>
</span>"Taken altogether, perhaps it may be safely asserted that<br/>
the Egyptians were the most essentially a building people of<br/>
all those we are acquainted with, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>generally successful in all they attempted in this way. The Greeks, it is<br/>
true, surpassed' them in refinement and beauty of detail, and<br/>
in the class of sculpture with which they ornamented their<br/>
buildings, and the Gothic architects far excelled them in constructive cleverness; but besides these, no other style can be<br/>
put in competition with them. At the same time, neither<br/>
Grecian nor Gothic architects understood more perfectly all<br/>
the gradations of art, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>exact character that should be<br/>
given to every form and every detail. They understood also<br/>
better than any other nation how to use sculpture in <span style="color: #0000FF;">combination </span>with architecture, and to make their colossi and<br/>
