more than a <span style="color: #0000FF;">kilt </span>of white linen cloth, and not always that,<br/>
though there is generally a necklace of blue and white glass<br/>
beads, and invariably there is a wig-a huge black, moppy,<br/>
furry black wig; for the wig was truly a great institution of<br/>
the Egyptian land in its earliest days<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>- (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Piazzi </span>Smyth.)<br/>
<br/>
Under later dynasties, the character of the pictures on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>walls of the entrance-chambers changed. Mystic representations of the soul's passage to eternity, its judgment, and<br/>
future state, are figured. The all-pervading power of the<br/>
king and the priesthood becomes increasingly manifest, and<br/>
a whole pantheon of gods come upon the scene<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>But tourists who desire to become acquainted with the<br/>
details of Egyptian tombs must refer to the many learned<br/>
works written on the subject. The chief special objects of<br/>
attraction at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah </span>are the Serapeum, the Pyramids, the<br/>
Tomb of Tih, and the Tomb of Phtah-hotep.<br/>
<br/>
The Serapeum is the tomb of the Divine Bulls of<br/>
Apis, described by Strabo. It has been entirely excavated,<br/>
but is now mostly re-covered with sand. The part seen is<br/>
the burying-place of the sacred bulls from <span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0. </span>to 50 3.0.<br/>
Some of the sarcophagi are still in their places. The stelae<br/>
have been mostly removed.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">eleven </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>number.<br/>
The largest IS thought to be the oldest<br/>
in Egypt, dating from the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ouenephes</span>, the fourth<br/>
king of the first dynasty. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">190 </span>ft. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">height</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and<br/>
contains a number of chambers and passages in which about<br/>
thirty mummies were found. One of the adjacent Pyramids<br/>
is truncated, and is called by the Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mastabat-el-Pharaoon</span>,<br/>
the throne of Pharaoh. A little to the north of the Great<br/>
Pyramid are the pits where the mummies of the sacred<br/>
ibis are preserved in earthenware pots. The mummies are<br/>
now mostly dust.<br/>
