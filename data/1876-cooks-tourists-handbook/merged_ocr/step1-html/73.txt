"where thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">sowedst </span>thy seed, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">wateredst </span>it with thy<br/>
foot <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>garden of herbs."<br/>
<br/>
Of the commerce of ancient Egypt we get a glimpse<br/>
when, in Gen. xxxvii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">z </span>5, Joseph's brethren encounter the<br/>
Ishmaelites with their "camels bearing spicery and <span style="color: #ff0000;">balm'<br/>
</span>and myrrh." In <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Kings x. 28, 29, Solomon is found <span style="color: #0000FF;">buy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>horses and chariots and linen yarn, and in Ezekiel xxvii.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span>the "fine linen with broidered work from Egypt," is<br/>
spoken of as one of the luxuries of Tyre.<br/>
<br/>
The learning of the Magi was celebrated through all the<br/>
adjacent countries. In Gen. xli. 8, Exodus vii. II, I Kings<br/>
iv. 30, and Acts vii. 22, this Egyptian wisdom is referred to.<br/>
Some interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">references </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the Egyptian priests, the king's<br/>
property in the land, the practice of embalmment, the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">abhorrence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, of shepherds, etc., will be noticed in perusing the narrative of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish </span>sojourn in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.interesting </span>references to Egypt of a more general<br/>
character will be found in the Psalms and in other parts of<br/>
the Scriptures. The story of Israel in Egypt, so full of<br/>
typical events, and of moral lessons for all ages of the world,<br/>
is referred to again and again in the sacred writings, and<br/>
will be perused with interest by the traveller in that ancient<br/>
land. Everywhere, too, he will see how the predictions,<br/>
made<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>in far off ages of the world, have literally come true,<br/>
and the land <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was once noted above all others for its<br/>
wisdom and prosperity, has sunk to be the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">basest </span>of<br/>
kingdoms." And he will see, too, how the judgments<br/>
pronounced have been carried out to the letter<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and this will<br/>
aid him, perchance, to believe that prophecies <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfulfilled </span>are<br/>
even now in process of accomplishment. One remarkable<br/>
passage, which minutely describes the destruction to befall<br/>
certain specified towns and districts, will be read with<br/>
interest as the sites of former grandeur are visited.<br/>
