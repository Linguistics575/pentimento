and a most surprising contrast awaits you. A court, im..<br/>
mensely vast, presents itself to the astonished eye<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in the<br/>
midst is an enormous fountain, with a dome, and at the end,<br/>
afar off, is a grand minaret in ruins. All round the enclosure<br/>
runs a vast gallery of massive pillars, each comprising four<br/>
smaller columns, and over these are elegant elliptical windows. Such is the famous monument which the Sultan<br/>
Ahmed Ebn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Touloun </span>built in 877, with the treasure which he<br/>
is said to have found amongst the ruins of the ancient Egyptian<br/>
cities. The architect was a Christian, and a man of genius.<br/>
Bronze lamps were suspended from the vaulted roof, the<br/>
ceiling was formed of incorruptible sycamore wood, and the<br/>
entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kur-én </span>was inscribed on a frieze surrounding the ceiling.<br/>
There yet remain traces of these sacred characters. In the<br/>
midst of the enclosure was a pavilion, the dome sustained by<br/>
ten marble columns, and surrounded by sixteen other<br/>
columns of the same character, the pavement a fine mosaic<br/>
with a basin and fountain..... At the present day,<br/>
this beautiful building is in a most deplorable state."<br/>

There are several of the Mosques which the tourist will<br/>
do well to visit if his time allows. The Mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span>Azhar,<br/>
or Splendid, is very fine, and is the chief Oriental University.<br/>
It was founded by Gowher, in 970 A.D. The Mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">El<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">H'akem </span>was built by the Fatimite Caliph of that name,<br/>
who asserted a divine mission, and founded the still existent<br/>
sect of the Druses. The minarets of this Mosque were fortified during the French occupancy. At the Mosque of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Berkook </span>a beautifully illuminated Kur-én, written by the<br/>
Princess <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">atima</span>, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">shown</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The Mosque of Sultan<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">.Hassan</span>, dating from <span style="color: #ff0000;">1357</span>, is, perhaps, the finest in the<br/>
city. The architecture is graceful and elegant, and the<br/>
ornamentation superb. It cost (<span style="color: #0000FF;">6oo </span>a day for three years<br/>
to rear this building, and it is asserted that the architect's<br/>
