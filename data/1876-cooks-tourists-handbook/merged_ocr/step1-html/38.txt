<span>24 INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
Children from three to ten years of age pay half fares for<br/>
the whole voyage; those under three years will go free,<br/>
provided they do not exceed their parents in number, in which<br/>
case one-fourth of the passage rate will be charged for each<br/>
child.<br/>

SECTION II.<br/>
FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND <span style="color: #0000FF;">CATARACT</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span>Administration having placed a steamer<br/>
on the Upper Nile, to ply between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mroidy-Halfa</span>,<br/>
Messrs. COOK & SON inaugurated this new service <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>1875. The experiment having proved a success, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Administration </span>agreed to supply a larger and more comfortable<br/>
steamer than the one with which that service was previously<br/>
worked. The voyage to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-Halfa </span>and back may be<br/>
accomplished in twelve days, of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">four-and-a-half </span>are<br/>
employed in sight-seeing ashore, and, after the return journey,<br/>
passengers will have to make the Upper Nile steamer their<br/>
hotel for two or three extra days, waiting the arrival of the<br/>
Lower N ile steamer at Assouan to take them back to Cairo.<br/>
These few days will be found anything but unpleasant by those<br/>
who delight in a soft climate, and admire the beauties of nature.<br/>
Varied scenes may be enjoyed every day, either by going in a<br/>
boat around the island, or down the river through the number..<br/>
less rapids which precede the Cataracts, or by riding to the<br/>
neighbouring villages and the granite hills which border the<br/>
different camel paths towards Assouan. Were it only as a<br/>
resting-place, Philae would still <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>found delightful. Although<br/>
navigation on the Upper Nile is quite as easy and secure, if not<br/>
easier than that on the Lower N ile, it is desirable to allow three<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">days</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">margin </span>in case of any unforeseen delay above the First<br/>
Cataract.<br/>
