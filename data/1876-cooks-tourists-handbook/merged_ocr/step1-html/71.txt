</span>"Pharaoh-Hophra fell a victim," says W. Osburn, in<br/>
his Antiquities of Egypt, "to the conqueror Cambyses<br/>
the Persian, who devastated Egypt from the Mediterranean<br/>
to the Cataracts, and reduced her from the rank of queen of<br/>
the world's civilization to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">basest </span>of kingdoms, never<br/>
again to rise to an independent nation, and to be no more<br/>
the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing their iniquity<br/>
to remembrance (Ezek. xxix. 16), but to be a mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">province</span>,<br/>
first of Persia, then of the empire of Ptolemy, and lastly of<br/>
Rome.<br/>
<br/>
"These calamities of Egypt were foretold by the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">history </span>has shown how exactly they received their accomplishment. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>in the midst of these denunciations, the benefits<br/>
which God's people had formerly received from Egypt, and<br/>
the friendship which she afterwards manifested towards them,<br/>
seem never to be forgotten by Him who in wrath remembers<br/>
mercy. The prophetic doom that consigns other idolatrous<br/>
nations to utter destruction frowns upon them as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blackness </span>of darkness. But the "swift cloud" on which the<br/>
Lord <span style="color: #ff0000;">rideth </span>when He cometh unto Egypt (Isa. xix. 1), is<br/>
sometimes irradiated by a gleam of hope. The kings and<br/>
the armies of all the nations that were about to be overthrown were entombed in one vast sepulchral cave, <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the bold figure of Ezekiel (chap. xxxv.) There lay<br/>
Asshur and all her company <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>there was Elam and all her<br/>
multitude; there was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mesech</span>, Tubal, and Edom, and the<br/>
princes of the North, all of them, and all the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zidonians</span>.<br/>
But though the command went forth to the multitude of<br/>
Egypt also, "Go down and be thou laid with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncircumcised</span>" (ver. 19), yet it is likewise declared that in this,<br/>
his dreary dwelling-place, Pharaoh should see the desolation<br/>
that was around him, and "be comforted over all his multi<br/>
