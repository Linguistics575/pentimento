that name to the group of stars which before formed the<br/>
spreading claws of the scorpion. We cannot but admire<br/>
the zeal of the Egyptians by whom this work was then<br/>
finished. They were treated as slaves by their Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellow..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">countrymen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>they, the fallen descendants of the conquering kings of Thebes, had every third year their houses ransacked in search of arms<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Romans only drained the<br/>
province of its wealth, and the temple had, perhaps, never<br/>
been heard of by the Emperor, who could have been little<br/>
aware that the most lasting monument of his reign was<br/>
being raised in the distant province of Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>We cannot<br/>
but admire a people, who, denying themselves all beyond<br/>
the coarsest food and clothing as luxuries, thought a noble<br/>
massive temple for the worship of the gods one of the first<br/>
necessaries of life."<br/>
<br/>
There are a few other remains of temples, etc., in the<br/>
vicinity <span style="color: #ff0000;">appe.rtaining </span>to the ancient town of Tentyris, or.<br/>
Tentyra (modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah</span>). The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tentyrites </span>nursed a<br/>
standing enmity to crocodiles, and were accordingly often<br/>
engaged in savage and bloodthirsty feuds with the inhabitants of Ombos, by whom those animals were worshipped.<br/>

Leaving Keneh, the steamer next passes Benoot (E.), and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Builds </span>(W.), where the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ball√©see </span>jars are made, which the<br/>
women pose so gracefully on their heads when fetching<br/>
water from the Nile. The tourist may, perhaps, encounter<br/>
a large raft or two formed of these jars fastened together,<br/>
in transit to the markets of the large cities.<br/>
<br/>
Ten miles from Keneh, Kobt or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fort</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient<br/>
</span>Coptos is reached. It has some Egyptian remains, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>is<br/>
now associated with Roman times, from which most of its<br/>
ruined walls and towers date. It was long the head-quarters<br/>
of Egyptian Christianity, and probably gave its name to the<br/>
modern Copts. Until Diocletian wreaked his fury on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
