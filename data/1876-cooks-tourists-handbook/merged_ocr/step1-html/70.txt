<br/>
because thou wast a stranger in his land." From I Kings<br/>
iii. I, we learn that "Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh,<br/>
King of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought<br/>
her into the city of David." Solomon also received <span style="color: #0000FF;">assistance </span>from the same monarch in subduing the Canaanites<br/>
(r Kings ix. 16). There is reason to believe <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intermarriage<br/>
</span>with the Egyptians was permitted to the Israelites.<br/>
<br/>
Shishak, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheshonk</span>, of the twenty-second dynasty<br/>
(reigning in Bubastis) sheltered Jeroboam, and also invaded<br/>
Judah, taking from Jerusalem the treasures and shields of<br/>
gold (<span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>Kings xiv. 25, <span style="color: #0000FF;">26</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Egypt is in several passages alluded to as a source from<br/>
which were introduced idolatrous practices into Israel, also as<br/>
a power upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">whiclfthe </span>Jews often sinfully depended for aid<br/>
instead of only trusting in Divine protection. See especially<br/>
the denunciation of Jeremiah against the rebellious band who<br/>
followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Johanan</span>, the son of Kareah. "The sword which<br/>
you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt,<br/>
and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow close<br/>
after you there in Egypt, and there shall ye die "( <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jet</span>. xlii.,<br/>
xliii.) Not long after Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>slew all the Jews who had taken refuge there without <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinction </span>as to age or sex.<br/>
<br/>
The death of King Josiah, when fighting with <span style="color: #ff0000;">PharaohNecho</span>, at Megiddo, i <span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>narrated <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>2 Kings xxiii.<br/>
<br/>
The prophecies concerning Egypt in the pages of Isaiah,<br/>
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc., are very numerous. The following<br/>
may be specially noted-Isaiah xix., xx., <span style="color: #ff0000;">xlv</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Jeremiah xliii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">8-s3</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">xliv</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">30</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">xlvi</span>.; Zech. x., xi. In many particulars, as regards<br/>
the actual condition of the country, and the remains of past<br/>
greatness, the intelligent traveller cannot fail to see how<br/>
much is literally fulfilled<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
