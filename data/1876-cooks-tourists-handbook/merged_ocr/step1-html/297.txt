world<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Negeb, or South Country of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Judaea</span>, which was given<br/>
to the tribes of Judah and Simeon, is now entered. The<br/>
desert journey is over, and cultivation smiles on every hand.<br/>
Fields covered with flowers take the place of the long<br/>
stretches of gravel and rock, and the palm and acacias are<br/>
also, for the most part, left behind. In passing on, abundant evidences are seen of the former richness and fertility of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soil</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>At Kurnub the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">ThaWara</span>, are extensive<br/>
ruins. This was an important town in medieval times, and<br/>
the remains are probably of Roman or early Christian origin.<br/>
The site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amer </span>is now only a green valley, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ar'trahs </span>it is the one of the several towns of this name to<br/>
which David sent some of the spoils of the Amalekites,<br/>
when, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>hundred followers, he took vengeance upon<br/>
them for their raid upon Ziklag (<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Sam. xxx.) Several<br/>
ancient wells are passed <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the route-wells that may have<br/>
been there in the times of the patriarchs.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Milh </span>is the Moladah of the Bible (Josh. xv, 26,<br/>
xix. 2; I Chron. iv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">28 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Neh</span>. xi. <span style="color: #0000FF;">26</span>). Two very deep<br/>
wells, with heavy masonry, are noticeable here; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">kerbstones </span>indented by the ropes to a depth of from four to six<br/>
inches. Here the flocks of the patriarchs were watered, and<br/>
hither David led his forces against the wild desert tribes who<br/>
were ravaging the fields of Judah.<br/>
<br/>
Passing on, the traveller will notice the immense tracts of<br/>
grain, mostly wheat. The fields are divided, as of yore,<br/>
with landmarks of stones. The pastures often resemble a<br/>
gay parterre of flowers. Lilies of several varieties, daisies,<br/>
poppies, anemones, mignonette, and others, flourish in gay<br/>
luxuriance. Here and there Bedouin tents dot the valleys,<br/>
