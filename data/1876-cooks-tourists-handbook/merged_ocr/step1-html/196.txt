can be done by the rapid tourist is to get correct general<br/>
impressions, and fill in the details at leisure. The author<br/>
last quoted says, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>the desert or the river, from within<br/>
or from without, by sunshine or by moonlight-however<br/>
you contemplate Karnak-appears the very aspect in which<br/>
it shows to most advantage. And when this was all perfect,<br/>
when its avenues opened in vistas upon the noble temples<br/>
and palaces of Sesostris, upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gournou</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, and<br/>
Luxor; when its courts were paced by gorgeous priestly<br/>
pageants, and busy life swarmed on a river flowing between<br/>
banks of palaces, like those of Venice magnified a hundredfold-when all this was in its prime, no wonder that its fame<br/>
spread even over the barbarian world, and found immortality<br/>
in Homer's song.<br/>
<br/>
"For many a day after I had seen it, and even to this<br/>
hour, glimpses of Thebes mingle with my reveries and blend<br/>
them with my dreams, as if that vision had <span style="color: #0000FF;">daguerreotyped<br/>
</span>itself upon the brain and left'its impress there for ever."<br/>

</span>The next place to notice, after leaving Luxor, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Erment</span>,<br/>
where more sugar making is going forward on a very extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">scale</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>here are some ruins of the town of Hermonthis,<br/>
consisting chiefly of a small Ptolemaic temple containing<br/>
what is considered the authentic portrait of Cleopatra. Tuot<br/>
(E.), the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebelayen </span>Ridge (W.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jifutanek </span>(W.), and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tofues </span>(W.), site of ancient Aphroditopolis, offer nothing<br/>
specially worthy of notice..<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>miles from Luxor), pop. 7000, is a place<br/>
of considerable trade, with bazaars, a well-stocked market,<br/>
and a colony of the dancing girls; it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>considered the most<br/>
healthy town in Egypt, and has been called "the most<br/>
