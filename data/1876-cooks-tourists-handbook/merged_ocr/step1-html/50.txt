</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">POPULATION</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The population of Egypt consists chiefly of Arabs, Copts,<br/>
Turks, and Levantines. The Arabs are the descendants of<br/>
the followers of Amer in 640, or of those who crowded into<br/>
Egypt after the conquest, attracted by the beauty and fertility<br/>
of the land. To a large extent a rapid fusion took place<br/>
between the new element and the indigenous population.<br/>
But the Arab element has maintained its ascendancy. The<br/>
Arabs of the cities, by the constant admixture of their race<br/>
with Abyssinian slaves and their adoption of a settled life,<br/>
have lost most of their primitive characteristics. The Arabs<br/>
of the villages, or fellahs, are also a mixed race<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>but the nomade Arabs of the wilderness outside the Nile valley, numbering about 400,000, are still true children of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The Copts (who, according to some, derive their name<br/>
from a corruption of the Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aiguptios</span>, and according to<br/>
others from ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Captor</span>, now <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kobt</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">158</span>), are now the<br/>
sole distinct representatives of the ancient race that built the<br/>
Pyramids and the other glories of Egypt. They are Christians, and by guarding their faith in the hostile presence of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahomedanism </span>they have doubtless <span style="color: #ff0000;">preServed </span>their race and<br/>
name. They are largely found among the clerks, etc., in<br/>
mercantile and public offices.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks </span>have never been numerous in Egypt. They<br/>
number about <span style="color: #0000FF;">12,000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>they despise the other elements of the<br/>
population, by whom they are detested in return.<br/>
<br/>
The Levantines are a mixture of Syrians, Armenians,<br/>
Greeks, etc., chiefly engaged as merchants and bankers.<br/>
There are about 7000 Jews in Egypt, and about 10,000<br/>
settled Europeans, called F ranks.<br/>
<br/>
The total population of Egypt in 1871, according to<br/>
Regny, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">530314.05</span>.<br/>
