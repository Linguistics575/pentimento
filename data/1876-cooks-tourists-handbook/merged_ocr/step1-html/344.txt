<br/>
</span>ROUTES FOR INDEPENDENT TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
Independent travellers, in small or large parties, can be provided for<br/>
over any route they choose to select, either from America, London, Paris,<br/>
Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland, the South of France, or Italy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Travellers<br/>
</span>from any point can have tickets to travel when they please and how they<br/>
please, with or without coupons for days, weeks, or months.<br/>
<br/>
We have already intimated that we can provide passages from America<br/>
by any line of Atlantic steamers<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>and taking London as the starting-point<br/>
for the East, the following, amongst other routes, can be provided for t-<br/>
London to Paris, Dover and Calais, or by Dieppe<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>London to Brussels,<br/>
by Calais, Ostend, Harwich, Antwerp, or Flushing.<br/>
<br/>
Paris to Italy by Macon and Mont Cenis, or by Marseilles, Cannes,<br/>
Nice, Mentone, and Genoa<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Paris to Italy by Geneva or Bale, through Switzerland, and by any<br/>
Alpine road.<br/>
<br/>
Paris to Brussels, Cologne, and up the Rhine to Heidelberg, Strasburg,<br/>
Bale, and over the Splugen or <span style="color: #ff0000;">St. </span>Gotthard to Milan' or from the Rhine<br/>
to Munich, and over the Brenner to Verona, and through Italy.<br/>
<br/>
Italy may be traversed in going out or in returning, and travellers may<br/>
tarry as long as they like in any Italian city.<br/>
<br/>
All steamers from France or Italy are available. From Marseilles, the<br/>
Messageries Maritimes, which also take up at Naples. F <span style="color: #0000FF;">rum </span>Genoa,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Leghorn</span>, or Naples, the Rubattino steamers to either Alexandria or Port<br/>
Said. From Venice, Ancona, or Brindisi, the Mail Steamers of the Peninsula and Oriental line to Alexandria, which line is also available from<br/>
Southampton to Port Said or Suez. From Venice, Trieste, Brindisi, or<br/>
Corfu, the Austrian Lloyds, which encompass the circle of the Levant, and<br/>
the steamers of which line are most practicable for Palestine tours. All<br/>
our <span style="color: #0000FF;">personally-conducted </span>tours go by that line because it is the best adapted<br/>
for our purposes.<br/>
<br/>
On the Syrian Coast we offer a choice of Austrian, French, Russian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptian </span>steamers. We thus command the entire steamboat accommodations of Italy, F rance, and the Levant, and we can also give tickets to<br/>
go through Algiers, Sicily, and other islands of the Mediterranean, in<br/>
connection with Palestine, Egypt, the Nile, and the Desert. We can<br/>
furnish tickets to return to America by the south course of the Atlantic,<br/>
from Gibraltar direct to New York, without returning through Europe;<br/>
or we can arrange for visiting Scandinavia either before or after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palest<br/>
<br/>
</span>tine tour<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br/>
<br/>
In face of such variety of routes it is almost impossible to quote fares<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">independent </span>travel until it is known exactly what applicants desire.<br/>
We <span style="color: #0000FF;">prefer </span>that Passengers should make out their own programmes, or name<br/>
the places they wish to visit, and the time they wish to spend abroad, and<br/>
we can then give them quotations<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
