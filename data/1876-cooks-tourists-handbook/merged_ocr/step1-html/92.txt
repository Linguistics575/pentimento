opened, and before the present bridge was constructed.<br/>
Achmet Pasha, who was then the heir to the Viceroyalty, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>returning to Cairo from Alexandria, and the ferry bridge was<br/>
out of its place; so that, as the train came along, it plunged<br/>
into the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
At Kafr-ez-Zyat the train waits to allow of travellers<br/>
taking refreshments at the restaurant attached to the station.<br/>

The tourist is now in the Delta of Egypt. The country<br/>
is marvellously fertile, and cotton plantations, and sugar fields,<br/>
and grain of every kind abound. The soil is the rich mud<br/>
deposited by the Nile, and the divisions of the land are not<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>as in most places, made by hedges or walls, but by innumerable little canals, running like a network of silver threads over<br/>
the vast plain. Paul Lenoir, in Artists in Egypt, thus<br/>
describes the scene <span style="color: #ff0000;">I-<br/>
</span>"A whistle, almost European in its prolonged <span style="color: #0000FF;">shrillness</span>,<br/>
started us off again, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the aspect of the country changing<br/>
rapidly, we felt that we were getting into the heart of Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>into the cultivated lands which form its inexhaustible wealth<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It was at the epoch when the grain is green, and it had <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>singular effect upon us to cross those great steppes of herbage<br/>
which we had not believed could exist out of Holland.<br/>
White herons, looking in the distance like pieces of paper<br/>
strewn about at random, formed an odd sort of interruption<br/>
to the general tone of this agricultural fertility.<br/>
<br/>
"Very few palm-trees, innumerable irrigation works, and<br/>
an horizon invariably green, it was quite irritating..... Our<br/>
attention was, however, happily diverted by the infinite variety<br/>
of birds which seemed to accompany the train. Ducks,<br/>
hawks, and eagles succeeded each other without interruption.<br/>
The countless little watercourses which intersect these lands<br/>
are covered with birds of every description, and innumerable<br/>
animals of various kinds, who seem to live together on the<br/>
