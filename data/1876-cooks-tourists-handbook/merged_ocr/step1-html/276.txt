Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Katereena</span>, the highest peak of them all, but also<br/>
hidden from the plain by other peaks of its own range.<br/>

"It is a view," says Captain H. S. Palmer, "which once<br/>
seen is not likely to be forgotten. Indeed, the whole prospect from this point is so beautiful and sublime that no<br/>
beholder can fail to be impressed by it. It is indeed <span style="color: #0000FF;">unrivalled </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>there is nothing else like it in this or any other<br/>
part of the peninsula-the long, wide plain sloping down to<br/>
the mount, the grand outlines of the surrounding hills, and<br/>
the stately cliffs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">R113 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufs√©feh</span>, the' brow' of Sinai,<br/>
or Jebel Moosa, overlooking and seen from every point of<br/>
the plain below, the most conspicuous and imposing feature<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>landscape where all is grand."<br/>

a visit to the Convent and the exploration of the vicinity.<br/>

<br/>
Visitors to the Convent of St. Catherine, if arriving with<br/>
proper letters <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>introduction from the branch convent at<br/>
Cairo, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>now hoisted up <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty </span>feet to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">postem </span>in<br/>
the wall, as formerly. The heavy iron gates are opened,<br/>
and the visitors are then conducted to the travellers' apartments at the top of the building.<br/>
