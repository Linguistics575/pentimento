<br/>
Bay of Biscay; and their big, strong boxes and their new<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">portmanteaus </span>will stream out again to-morrow into that<br/>
barge by the quay for loading to Bengal.<br/>
<br/>
"Next day another living tide is rushing in from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>distant East, from India, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hong-Kong</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nagasaki</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Australian mail. The clothes of these are well <span style="color: #0000FF;">worn-almost </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">threadbare</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-and </span>their. <span style="color: #ff0000;">puggeries</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>are ample and<br/>
business-like round their hats: their faces are pale or careworn, or even haggard, and the fretful children battle on the<br/>
stairs-pretty, and with brilliant eyes, but with no bright<br/>
English roses on their cheeks."<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing particular to see in Suez<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the mosques<br/>
can be glanced at, and from the heights where stands the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s <span style="color: #ff0000;">chiiteau </span>there is a fine view of the sea and adjacent<br/>
mountains, from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Attékah </span>to Sinai. An agreeable day can<br/>
be spent in an excursion to Ain Mousa, which has now<br/>
become, as Dean Stanley says, "the Richmond of Suez."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ANCIENT </span>CANALS.<br/>
<br/>
Before describing the route from Suez to Port Said by the<br/>
Great Canal, it will be well briefly to allude to former<br/>
attempts at establishing a water communication between the<br/>
Red Sea and the Nile or Mediterranean.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptians were great in engineering from time<br/>
immemorial. Menes, first monarch, altered the course of<br/>
the Nile. The Bahr Yoosef Canal dates from <span style="color: #ff0000;">remotest<br/>
</span>antiquity. It was only natural that at an early date they<br/>
should think of facilitating their commerce with Arabia by<br/>
making a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea. Through the<br/>
labours of various monarchs, and especially of the great<br/>
Sesostris, the habitable portion of Egypt had become covered<br/>
with a network of water-ways connected with the Nile,<br/>
