The chief pursuit of the people of Egypt is agriculture,<br/>
and it is this which furnishes the chief exports. The total<br/>
value of the exports for 1871 was <span style="color: #ff0000;">d</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>10,400,000. Cotton<br/>
and wheat are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>articles of <span style="color: #0000FF;">export</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>beans, peas,<br/>
lentils, barley, and dates are also of considerable importance.<br/>
Sugar is an increasing production of Egypt, and is gradually<br/>
taking a higher rank among the exports of the country.<br/>
Great Britain takes about <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>per cent. of the goods sent out<br/>
from Egypt. There is a considerable caravan trade with the<br/>
interior of Africa; there are considerable manufactories for<br/>
firearms, and cotton<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>silk, and woollen goods, mostly founded<br/>
and directed by the Government.<br/>

<br/>
The first railway was opened in Egypt about twenty<br/>
years ago, from Alexandria to Cairo. A line from Cairo to<br/>
Suez soon followed; this had to be abandoned in consequence<br/>
of the difficulty of supplying intermediate stations with<br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
A new line was constructed, following the course of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">resh </span>Water Canal, which conveys the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>water to Ismailia and Suez, and also supplies Port Said by pipes fifty miles<br/>
in length. The railway is connected with the main line at<br/>
Benha, so that Peninsular and Oriental through passengers<br/>
cross to Suez without going to Cairo. The Suez Canal is,<br/>
however, decreasing the patronage of the through railway<br/>
route.<br/>
<br/>
The Delta is now a network of railways as well as canals.<br/>
From Zagazig there is a branch to Mansoorah, and then<br/>
from the adjacent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah </span>to Damietta, also another from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>to Damietta. Another line leads to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dessook</span>, on<br/>
