<span>ENVIRONS OF CAIRO. <span style="color: #ff0000;">121<br/>
<br/>
</span>Church of Aboo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirgeh </span>is over the subterranean Church of<br/>
Sitt Mariam, in which are shown two niches, said to have<br/>
been the resting places <span style="color: #ff0000;">oCJoseph </span>and Mary and the child<br/>
Jesus during the flight into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite Old Cairo is the pleasant island of Roda, with<br/>
groves and gardens, at one time <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">favourite </span>place of resort<br/>
from Cairo. Here it is traditionally asserted that Moses<br/>
was found amongst the bulrushes by the Princess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Merrhis </span>(?),<br/>
Pharaoh's daughter. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>Roda there are interesting views<br/>
of the Nile and its banks, and the motley scene of busy life<br/>
at the ferry. The celebrated Nilometer is on the south of<br/>
the island, consisting of a graduated column marking the<br/>
gradual rise of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>as the time of the annual inundation<br/>
draws near. The 16th cubit is called the Sultan's Water, as<br/>
the land tax is not levied unless this height is attained.<br/>
From 18 to 22 cubits is called a good <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>; a greater height<br/>
would do great mischief.<br/>
<br/>
The erection of this Nilometer is ascribed to the Caliph<br/>
el-Mamoon, but earlier arrangements for measuring the rise<br/>
of the river existed long before. Deodorus and Herodotus<br/>
both refer to the practice.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">SHOOBRA</span>.<br/>
<br/>
To visit the palace and gardens at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra</span>, an order from<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive</span>'s Chamberlain must be obtained, by application<br/>
through the Consulate.<br/>
<br/>
The broad road to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra</span>, shaded with rows of acacias,<br/>
is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">faiourite </span>promenade with the wealthier inhabitants of<br/>
Cairo. The road lies through a beautiful shady avenue of<br/>
sycamore and acacia trees, and in it thousands of people are<br/>
daily driving up and down, as this is the Rotten Row of<br/>
Cairo. Every style of carriage, from the elegant equipages<br/>
