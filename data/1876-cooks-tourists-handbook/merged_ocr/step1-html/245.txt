<span>KANTARAH. 227<br/>
<br/>
"Only <span style="color: #0000FF;">fresh-water </span>shells are to be found in Lake Timsah,<br/>
and the crocodile does not live in salt water. These facts<br/>
seem to confirm the idea that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fresh-water </span>canal had long<br/>
ago existed here, and that the town, of which there are ruins<br/>
at the end of the Bitter Lakes, may have been destroyed by<br/>
the same upheaving of the land which dried the lakes<br/>
themselves."<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Lake Timsah, the heights of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Guisr</span>, the<br/>
highest part of the Isthmus of Suez, are reached. A small<br/>
canal, leading to some stone quarries, is seen on the right,<br/>
and a branch connecting the Fresh Water, and Maritime<br/>
Canals is seen on the left.<br/>
<br/>
The cutting of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guisr </span>is nine miles in length (from<br/>
Lake Timsah to Ballah). In some parts of this cutting,<br/>
especially near El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guisr</span>, the dredging is from sixty to seventy<br/>
feet, the full perpendicular depth being over a hundred feet.<br/>
In 1859, when the Company were employing 20,000 fellahs,<br/>
or native workmen, furnished by the Viceroy, the greater<br/>
part were employed here. A narrow channel was first cut,<br/>
in order to float the steam dredges, and fill the shallow<br/>
basin of Lake Timsah. This channel took two years in<br/>
cutting, and it took five months to fill Lake Timsah with<br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fendane </span>is at the head of a string of shallow<br/>
lagoons, stretching down to the Mediterranean. The first<br/>
of these lagoons is called Lake<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Ballah. The remainder of<br/>
the route, through Lakes Ballah and Menzaleh, is thirtyeight miles.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gunterah</span>, or Kantarah, is on the great Syrian <span style="color: #0000FF;">route<br/>
</span>to Egypt. It stands on the ridge of sand hills separating<br/>
Lake Menzaleh from the interior lagoons. Here, formerly,<br/>
was a bridge, as the name indicates. A floating one is used<br/>
now. The desert approaches <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>near to this town.<br/>
