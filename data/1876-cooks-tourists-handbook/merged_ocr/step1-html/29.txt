<span>STEAMBOATS AND DAHABEAHS.<br/>
<br/>
DAHABEAH.<br/>
<br/>
This is a private conveyance, and<br/>
you must have your own party,<br/>
or else make up one, when you<br/>
must put up with intimacy with<br/>
people who may prove very <span style="color: #0000FF;">objectionable</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A select party may be formed for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>dahabeah.<br/>
<br/>
Dahabeahs are private speculations<br/>
designed to make large profits.<br/>
<br/>
Charges are not strictly <span style="color: #0000FF;">inclu'sive</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Long, tedious, and doubtful bargains have to be made.<br/>
<br/>
Travel all night, and therefore much<br/>
of the scenery is lost to the traveller.<br/>
<br/>
May be, and often are, weeks<br/>
overdue, so that arrangements<br/>
for continuation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tour </span>are<br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Great loss of time before <span style="color: #0000FF;">embark</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>in selection of Dahabeah,<br/>
preparing contract, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You rush past all the glorious stopping places, because the great<br/>
object is to get up stream<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and<br/>
you stop to visit on the return<br/>
journey, when the edge of the<br/>
interest is taken off.<br/>
<br/>
Never know where you are to stop.<br/>

STEAMER<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>A public conveyance, where every<br/>
one is independent, if he wishes<br/>
to be so.<br/>
<br/>
So may it for a special steamer,<br/>
without greater cost, as fourteen<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>fifteen first-class passengers<br/>
will charter one.<br/>
<br/>
Steamers are provided by the State,<br/>
and not worked specially <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>profit<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Charges are strictly inclusive.<br/>
<br/>
None are necessary as all expenses<br/>
are included in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fares</span>, which<br/>
are fixed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">KÃ©divic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">administration</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Only travel by day, so that every<br/>
inch of the way is seen.<br/>
<br/>
Steamers are punctual.<br/>
<br/>
You have only to pay the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tariff </span>and<br/>
step on board.<br/>
<br/>
As you see the places going up, so<br/>
you stop and examine them when<br/>
the interest is fresh. Then you<br/>
review them in the downward<br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
Always know where you are to<br/>
stop, so that telegrams can be<br/>
received.<br/>
