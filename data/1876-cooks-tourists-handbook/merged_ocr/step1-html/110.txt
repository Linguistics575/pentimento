hands were cut off by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan</span>'s command, to keep the<br/>
edifice unique. On the tomb of the founder is a large copy<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kur-én</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The Mosque of Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalaoon</span>; the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sharawee</span>; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Modiud</span>, commonly called the Red<br/>
Mosque<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghoree</span>, with its beautiful<br/>
inlaid work in the interior<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Mosque of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seyyideh<br/>

The Churches in Cairo present no particular attraction<br/>
for mere sight-seers. The Coptic Church of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moalléke<br/>
</span>(the Suspended) is curious. It is so called from its being<br/>
at a considerable height above the ground, and approached by<br/>
a flight <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stairs</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Palaces </span>of Cairo, all of which are modern, are<br/>
numerous, but only those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gezeereh </span>(p. 96) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">12 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r</span>) can be visited. An order from <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s Chamberlain is necessary, and this can be obtained through the<br/>
Consulate. The Palace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gezeereh </span>stands on an island<br/>
formed by a branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, and was built by the present<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, Ismail Pasha. The Empress Eugénie and the<br/>
Emperor of Austria have been entertained here. .The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ballroom</span>, reception-rooms, hall, and staircase are very fine.<br/>
There are some pretty gardens, and a capital collection of<br/>
African birds and beasts.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Public Library in a building at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darlr</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Gammameez</span>, beside the Ministry of Public Instruction.<br/>
Here is a fine collection of books in all languages, including<br/>
the principal works that were formerly in the libraries of the<br/>
Mosques. Free use of the library is permitted on every day<br/>
except Friday. The Schools of Cairo are numerous.<br/>
Besides the Free Schools at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fountains</span>, before alluded to<br/>
(p. po) there are government schools, both civil and<br/>
