<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ITINERARY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TQ </span>FIRST <span style="color: #0000FF;">CATARACT</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">17<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SE00 </span>N D DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The excursion to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakldrah </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>is made, starting early in the morning. An opportunity may occur on returning,<br/>
and after having visited the site where Memphis stood, to witness an important fair, held every Wednesday, at a village on<br/>
our way. Back at about noon to the steamer, which starts <span style="color: #0000FF;">immediately</span>. In the afternoon pass on the right the curtailed<br/>
Pyramid, called "<span style="color: #ff0000;">El </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kedsib</span>," or False Pyramid. Towards<br/>
evening reach <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wasta</span>, a village of no importance, where the<br/>
steamer generally stops for the night, unless the night be clear<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">moon-lit</span>, in which case the steamer continues its course for<br/>
some time.<br/>
<br/>
THIRD DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Start early in the morning, in order to pass, before nightfall,<br/>
the mountain "Gebel-el-Tayr," on the top of which stands a<br/>
Coptic convent, whose inmates used to plunge into the river as<br/>
soon as a boat was in sight, and swimming towards it, with the<br/>
greatest dexterity catch hold of the small boat in tow, and climb<br/>
on deck to ask for backsheesh.' In the afternoon pass in succession the splendid sugar factories of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BibSFeshne</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maghkgha</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ben-in-Mar</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Samaloot</span>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Towards evening Minieh is <span style="color: #0000FF;">reached</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it contains a fine<br/>
palace belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few<br/>
weeks here in the winter; and a most extensive sugar <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactory</span>, employing about 2,000 people. A visit to this establishment will well repay the trouble, and every attention is <span style="color: #0000FF;">shown</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>to visitors. The works generally commence in the beginning of<br/>
January, and, when in activity, the evening is the usual time to<br/>
admit visitors.<br/>
<br/>
FOURTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
In two hours the boat reaches Beni-Hassan, another <span style="color: #ff0000;">haltingplace </span>for sight-seeing. Swarms of beggars, and miserable<br/>
donkeys without saddles or <span style="color: #0000FF;">bridles-the </span>worst all along the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-await </span>the arrival of the steamer. The Rock Tombs of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The practice is now prohibited by the Patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
