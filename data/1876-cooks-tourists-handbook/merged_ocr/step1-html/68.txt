great design, and at the same time to use historical paintings,<br/>
fading by <span style="color: #0000FF;">insensible </span>degrees into hieroglyphics on the one<br/>
hand, and into sculpture on the other, linking the whole<br/>
together with the highest class of phonetic utterance and<br/>
with the most brilliant colouring, thus harmonizing all these<br/>
arts into one great whole unsurpassed by anything the world<br/>

aspiration that have elapsed since the brilliant days of the<br/>
great kingdom of the Pharaohs."<br/>

The Egyptians were a very devout people. Originally<br/>
they believed in one eternal God. Gradually this belief<br/>
became symbolized, and then the symbols became idols till<br/>
Polytheism overspread the whole land. To merely enumerate the gods of the Egyptian Pantheon would be a tedious<br/>
task. Many of the cities or provinces had their special<br/>
groups of deities. Osiris and Isis were worshipped throughout the land. Ammon was the special divinity of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Ptah was the chief god of Memphis, and symbolized the<br/>
creative principle. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asthe </span>system developed, immense crowds<br/>
of gods and goddesses came into <span style="color: #0000FF;">vogue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>all kinds of animals,<br/>
plants, abstract principles, etc., became <span style="color: #0000FF;">deified</span>. A future<br/>
state of rewards and punishments was taught in the religion<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt..<br/>
<br/>
</span>The government of ancient Egypt was a monarchy<br/>
limited by law, and the rights of certain privileged <span style="color: #0000FF;">glasses</span>,<br/>
chiefly the soldiers and priests. The laws were mostly wise<br/>
and very <span style="color: #0000FF;">strict</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It should be remembered that the ancient Egyptians were<br/>
of Asiatic and not African origin. When negroes are <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>on the monuments they are distinctly characterized.<br/>
But there is no doubt that the Egyptians, by intermarriage<br/>
with native races, had become considerably Africanized, and<br/>
