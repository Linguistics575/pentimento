<br/>
the former is spanned by seventy-two arches and the latter<br/>
by sixty-two, each of sixteen feet span. This great scheme<br/>
of Mahomed Ali's has never been of practical utility, as it is<br/>
considered that any attempt to dam up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>at high<br/>
flood would sweep the entire Barrage down the stream.<br/>
<br/>
It is the right, or eastern, branch of the Nile that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bows<br/>
</span>from this point to Damietta; the western branch has been<br/>
alluded to at p. 74 in describing the water-route from Alexandria to Cairo<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The largest of lateen sails are seen in passing along the streams of the Delta-some of the yards are<br/>

"The Damietta branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>," says a modern traveller, "has all the grandeur <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a noble river. It is wider<br/>
than the Thames at Gravesend, and neither rocks nor rapids<br/>
break the stately <span style="color: #0000FF;">flow</span>. The banks are high, and they are<br/>
partly <span style="color: #ff0000;">artificial</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the foliage of green underwood often shades<br/>
the water; sometimes the shores are really beautiful with<br/>
splendid trees and wide spread park-like spaces, carpeted<br/>
with richest grass. The current is quickened where the banks<br/>
close in, and the Thames above Richmond Bridge was<br/>
brought to my recollection by several turns of the Nile. In<br/>
very few<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>places is the scenery positively tame, and no two<br/>
bends of the river are alike."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bershom</span>, famous for figs, is passed, and the mouths of<br/>
several of the Delta canals. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benha </span>(see p. 80) is famous<br/>
for honey. The mounds, marking the ruins of Athribis, are<br/>
seen to the north. Benha is on the railway from Alexandria<br/>
to Cairo, and there is also a branch line to Zagazig (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">217</span>),<br/>
by which through passengers to India cross to the Suez railway without going round by Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zifteh </span>there is a station on one of the Delta railways<br/>
running to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Semenhood</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah</span>, and Damietta. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooser<br/>
</span>are seen the mounds <span style="color: #0000FF;">of.ancient </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Busirus</span>.<br/>
