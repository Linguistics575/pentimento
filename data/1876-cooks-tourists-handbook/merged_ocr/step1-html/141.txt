</span>xxx. 16, are further allusions to this city. After its capture<br/>
by the Saracens in the seventh century, the predicted judgments of God on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphian </span>idolatry and corruption became<br/>
fulfilled, and almost every trace of its former magnificence<br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
The objects now to be seen on the site of Memphis <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>The Lake of the Temple of Phtah (Vulcan).<br/>
<br/>
The Red Granite Colossus of Rameses II. lying<br/>
on its face in a hollow place.<br/>
<br/>
A large stela, commemorating the services rendered to<br/>
the Temple of Phtah by Apries, of the twenty-sixth dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
Another colossal statue of Rameses IL, presented by<br/>
Mahomed Ali to the English Government. Its face is in<br/>
the water three quarters of the year. There are also some<br/>
broken remains of smaller statues, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Proceeding from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mitrahenny </span>(Memphis), the visitor<br/>
soon arrives at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkhrah</span>. Here there is the most<br/>
important <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis.s </span>of Memphis, with tombs ranging from<br/>
the time of the ancient Empire to the time of the Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
The tombs generally consist of an exterior building, a<br/>
well needing ropes for its descent, and a subterranean<br/>
chamber for the mummy. In this last chamber the mummy<br/>
is so placed as to be immediately under the centre of the<br/>
upper chamber, in which the relatives were accustomed<br/>
to meet on certain occasions. The tombs of the Ancient<br/>
Empire are especially interesting, displaying the deceased in<br/>
all the circumstances of his daily life-probably as representing eternity as a continuation of home <span style="color: #0000FF;">enjoyments</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"An austere set of chocolate-brown men were the builders<br/>
of these tombs, for their pictures of themselves are numerous<br/>
and have kept admirably, showing their features to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>been something between modern European and Asiatic.<br/>
