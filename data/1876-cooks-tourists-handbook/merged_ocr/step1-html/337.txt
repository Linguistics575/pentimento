<br/>
</span>of about six hours. Contrive, if possible, to spend Sunday at this deeply<br/>
interesting, historical village, where ancient sites are the subjects of contention between Greek and Latin Christians, and where a beautiful edifice<br/>
has been erected for Protestant worship.<br/>
<br/>
Tenth Day. -Travel from Nazareth to Carmel, crossing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">riverKishon</span>,<br/>
and passing near to the place of sacrifice. Caifa, at foot of Mount Carmel,<br/>
is being rapidly brought under cultivation by <span style="color: #ff0000;">acolony </span>of Germans, who<br/>
have built an hotel and a number of cottages. Here a day or two may be<br/>
pleasantly spent if the travelling and steamer arrangements are carefully<br/>
calculated. The Austrian Lloyds steamers call at Caifa on their passage<br/>
both ways between Alexandria and Constantinople. The tour should be<br/>
arranged to harmonize with the steamboat service<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which is fortnightly<br/>
both ways.<br/>
<br/>
SIXTH <span style="color: #0000FF;">ITINERARY</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Embracing all of the Fifth as far as Caifa, and including<br/>
the Coast Route by Tyre and Sidon to Beyrout.<br/>
<br/>
After the ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span>of travel described in the Fifth Itinerary, the Sixth<br/>
Tour may be accomplished by four additional days, as shown <span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>Eleventh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Day.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>from Caifa to Acre, visit the ancient fortress,<br/>
and encamp at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Achzib-not </span>a heavy day if the weather is favourable. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Five<br/>
</span>or six hours in the saddle.<br/>
<br/>
Twelfth Dar-Ascend the ladder of Tyre--a rough and difficult way,<br/>
greatly improved-to the city of Tyre. Ancient fountains, the reputed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span>of Hiram, King of Tyre, and submerged ruins, engage the attention<br/>
of travellers here, where the camp will he stationed for a night, after a ride<br/>
of perhaps six to seven hours.<br/>
<br/>
Thirteenth Dar-Travel by Sarepta to Sidon, another moderate riding<br/>
day of six or seven hours, to the camping-ground at Sidon, the city so<br/>
frequently associated in the sacred history with Tyre.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fourteenth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-From </span>Sidon to Beyrout <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a coast journey of seven to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">eight </span>hours, and this day completes our Sixth Itinerary. Beyrout is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">delightful </span>place to rest in after a journey through Palestine and there is<br/>
more certainty of embarking than at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa</span>.<br/>
<br/>
SEVENTH ITINERARY.<br/>
The Beaten Track of a Thirty Days' Tour in Palestine.<br/>
<br/>
This itinerary has been frequently described in the programmes of our<br/>
Personally-conducted Tours. In the late autumn we prefer to travel from<br/>
north to south, thus going with the season. In the spring the contrary way<br/>
is preferable, as the way of the Lebanon and Mount Hermon is frequently<br/>
snowed up in the early part of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Seven travelling days are shown in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fifth </span>Itinerary to Jenin, and<br/>
from that point we travel on the<br/>
<br/>
Eighth Day-To Nazareth, crossing the Plain of Esdraelon by <span style="color: #0000FF;">June </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>,<br/>
Gideon's Fountain, Shunem, leaving to the right Nain, Endor. Mount<br/>
Tabor, etc., and going by Shunem, across the plain to the foot of the<br/>
Galilean Hills, the ascent of which to Nazareth requires great care, it being<br/>
very precipitous, and moderate riders must not expect to accomplish the<br/>
