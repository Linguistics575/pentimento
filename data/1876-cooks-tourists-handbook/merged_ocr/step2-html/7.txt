<span>PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
THE present volume is intended as a Handbook for Tourists,<br/>
and does not pretend to guide those who need a work to<br/>
assist them in elaborate research or scientific investigation.<br/>
So far as it has been deemed desirable to enter into minute<br/>
details, accuracy has been aimed at as the great essential;<br/>
but the object of this Handbook is rather to point out whatever is most worthy of special notice, and to intensify and<br/>
fix general impressions, than to enter minutely into matters<br/>
of study for which the Tourist, as a rule, has little <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>For the same reason, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptology </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>has only been<br/>
touched upon when absolutely necessary to a rational comprehension of the monuments described. Those who, as a<br/>
result of their Tour, are incited to make wider and deeper<br/>
investigations, will find no difficulty, on their return, in supplementing their general impressions with profounder <span style="color: #0000FF;">knowledge </span>from the pages of Wilkinson, Bunsen, Lane, Mariette<br/>
Bey, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the extraordinary development of modern<br/>
travel, the Second Cataract of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, or the peaks of<br/>
Mount Sinai are no longer the shadowy and <span style="color: #ff0000;">mysterioua<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
