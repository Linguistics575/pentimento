<br/>
by Ptolemy Philopater, and situate between the Colossi and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">From- </span>the sculptures it is conjectured<br/>
that the edifice was of a funereal character. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">western<br/>
</span>chamber, especially, would appear to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated<br/>
</span>to Osiris as the judge of departed souls.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">faoade </span>of this temple is very elegant, and constructed<br/>
in a style of which there is no better preserved example in<br/>
Egypt. There is a curious open window in the south<br/>
(paroi) of one of the interior chambers which merits careful study.<br/>
<br/>
The Necropolis of Thebes, in coming from Luxor,<br/>
lies beyond the Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koorneh</span>, to the left of the road<br/>
leading to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Molook</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The first portion of the cemetery <span style="color: #0000FF;">reached-that </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span>Aboo'l Negga--contains little to attract the<br/>
tourist's attention. It is undoubtedly the most ancient<br/>
Necropolis in Thebes, containing tombs of the eleventh,<br/>
seventeenth, and early eighteenth dynasties. Hence was<br/>
taken the coffin of Queen Aah-Hotep, in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boul√©k </span>Museum<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">97</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>The Necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assasseef</span>, farther south, contains<br/>
tombs of the nineteenth, twenty-second, and twenty-sixth<br/>
dynasties. One immense excavated tomb in this cemetery<br/>
occupies over an acre of ground.<br/>
<br/>
The Tombs of Sheykh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abd-el-Koorneh </span>are still<br/>
farther south from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assasseef</span>. Here the tombs are cut into<br/>
the mountain side. No. 35 is the most interesting, as its<br/>
sculptures have yielded an immense amount of information<br/>
as to the manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians.<br/>
Other adjacent tombs can be explored under the advice and<br/>
direction of the guides, if time allows. The tombs of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koornet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Murraee</span>, and other collections of sepulchres,<br/>
lie farther in the same direction, whilst more to the west <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
