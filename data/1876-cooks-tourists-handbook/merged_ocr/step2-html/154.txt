recite prayers before the picture which has thus had to do<br/>
double duty<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Feshun </span>(92 miles from Cairo). Railway Station<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malateeah </span>(W.), and other villages are passed. The<br/>
Gebel Sheykh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Embérak </span>is seen for some time before<br/>
reaching it, and has been compared to a giant blocking the<br/>
path. It is a large table-mountain, with broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface-one </span>of the cliffs closely resembles a ruined castle<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maghégha </span>(W., 106 miles from Cairo). Railway<br/>
Station. Here are some sugar factories belonging to the<br/>
Government and a branch railway for bringing the sugarcane <span style="color: #0000FF;">imp </span>the town. Aquatic birds in swarms abound on the<br/>
sandbanks south of the town. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hagar </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Salém</span>, or Rock<br/>
of Welfare, is passed; it derives its name from the current<br/>
belief of the boatmen that they cannot call a Nile voyage<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperous </span>until they have passed this stone on their way back<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>On both banks, though somewhat monotonous in general<br/>
appearance, are various remains of ancient towns. Near<br/>
Aboo Girgeh on the west bank is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Béhnesa</span>, representing<br/>
the ancient Oxyrinchus, City of Fish Worshippers. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Béhnesa<br/>
</span>was a notable place in Arab and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlook </span>times, and had<br/>
a wonderful legendary warrior-saint, one <span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Takroory</span>.<br/>
Mounds and grottoes in various directions from Aboo Girgeh mark the sites of ancient Cynopolis, "City of Dogs,"<br/>
and other old-world places. Near Sheykh Fodl on the E.<br/>
shore are remains of temples, and tombs with dog-mummies, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Golésaneh</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalouseneh </span>(W., 134 miles from<br/>
Cairo), is threatened with destruction by the action of the<br/>
Nile waters. It is, as usual, a mud-built village with a<br/>
beautiful palm grove<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Semaloot</span>, with its minaret <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuously </span>rising from<br/>
its palm grove, is seen on the west shore<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
