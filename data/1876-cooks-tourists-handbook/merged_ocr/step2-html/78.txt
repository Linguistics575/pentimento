HISTORY.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria stands on the spot where tradition located the<br/>
abode of the ever-changing Proteus, whose marvellous transformations were so often celebrated by the poets, and argued<br/>
about by the sages of ancient times.<br/>
<br/>
During the reigns of the Pharaohs, the commerce of<br/>
Egypt was almost exclusively eastward by caravan. As a<br/>
jealously guarded intercourse with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phtenicians </span>and other<br/>
Mediterranean nations increased, Naucratis, at the Canopic<br/>
mouth of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, was for a time the only foreign emporium<br/>
permitted. But at some early date a Greek colony became<br/>
settled at Rhacotis.<br/>
<br/>
Alexander the Great, flushed with the conquest of Syria<br/>
and Egypt, was, in 332 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>, on his way towards the temple<br/>
of Jupiter <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, when, on reaching <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhacotis</span>, he is said<br/>
to have noticed the exceeding suitability of the site, with its<br/>
two harbours, for building a great city which should be the<br/>
capital of Eastern commerce. He commissioned Dinocrates,<br/>
the architect, to build such a city, and so Ancient Alexandria<br/>
came into being.<br/>
<br/>
After the death of Alexander, and the partition of his<br/>
vast empire, Alexandria became the chief city of the Macedonian dynasty of the Ptolemies, who lavished their <span style="color: #0000FF;">wealth<br/>
<br/>
