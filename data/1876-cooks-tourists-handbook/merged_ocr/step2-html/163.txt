<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ASYOOT</span>. 147<br/>
<br/>
foundations remain. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot </span>(pop. 2 5,000) is the capital of<br/>
Upper Egypt, and residence of the governor. It is a<br/>
considerable town, with some fine mosques, bazaars, baths,<br/>
etc. The city lies more than a mile from the river, near<br/>
the foot of the mountain, and is really on an island formed<br/>
by a branch of the river. The latter is crossed by an<br/>
arched stone bridge, beyond which commences the ascent<br/>
of the mountain filled with tombs and grottoes. On<br/>
approaching the town, fifteen minarets can be counted rising<br/>
from amongst the groves of palm and acacia<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>
<br/>
</span>El Hamra, on the Nile bank, is the port of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>.<br/>
From hence to the city there is a beautiful curving road<br/>
raised a few feet above the plain, as the latter is under water<br/>
at the time of the annual inundation. The bazaars of this<br/>
city are very good; the private houses better than in most<br/>
Egyptian towns. There is a considerable trade in linen<br/>
cloth, earthenware, woollen, and opium. The pipe bowls<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot </span>are the best in the East, and large numbers are<br/>
sent to the bazaars at Cairo and elsewhere. The caravans for<br/>
Nubia and Darfur usually start from, and return to, this place.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain behind the city should be visited. The<br/>
view is very fine, comprising "about a hundred miles of the<br/>
valley of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-a </span>vast level panorama, bounded by the<br/>
chains of the Arabian and Libyan hills, diversified by <span style="color: #0000FF;">every<br/>
</span>shade of green, and watered by the N <span style="color: #0000FF;">iles</span>" The innumerable<br/>
tombs, of which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stab</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>Autar is the principal, are interesting from their Egyptian remains, and also from their<br/>
Christian associations, as being tenanted by monks and<br/>
hermits at a time when society seemed so <span style="color: #0000FF;">hopelessly </span>rotten<br/>
that almost all "the salt of the earth "was in voluntary exile<br/>
in the deserts and caves of Africa and Syria.<br/>
<br/>
"From the top of the ridge," says the Rev. W. Dale,<br/>
"the view is indeed very striking. The height is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">four<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
