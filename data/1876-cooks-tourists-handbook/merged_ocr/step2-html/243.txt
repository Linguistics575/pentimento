<br/>
is very interesting through the remains of ancient canals<br/>
and cuttings discovered here. There are also the remains<br/>
of a temple attributed to Serapis. Serapis was a comparatively<br/>
modern Egyptian god, uniting the functions of Apis and<br/>
Osiris. He was regarded as Pluto, and his worship was<br/>
first introduced from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sinop√© </span>in the time of the Ptolemies.<br/>
The extensive village of Serapeum forms a pretty oasis, with<br/>
its gardens and fields watered by a branch of the SweetWater Canal, in close proximity to desert wastes and sands.<br/>
<br/>
"Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timsah </span>is a large natural basin in the very<br/>
centre of the Isthmus. As its area is much less than the<br/>
Bitter Lakes, while its shores are higher and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">irregular</span>,<br/>
it possesses an approach to something like a kind of<br/>
picturesqueness you might not have been expecting. In<br/>
this midland harbour we found a fleet of large vessels, some<br/>
of them men-of-war, some of them even ironclads. A sense<br/>
of surprise comes over you at seeing, not only a pleasing<br/>
expanse of water in the thirsty, scorching waste (how one<br/>
wishes it were fresh water), but in addition a fleet of mighty<br/>
ships in the mid desert."<br/>
<br/>
Lake Timsah is five miles in length, the Canal skirting<br/>
the eastern shore. Till lately the lake was only partially<br/>
covered by water, received at the annual inundation from a<br/>
branch of the Nile. It is now an inland sea nine miles in<br/>
circumference. A little south of the lake is a valley commanded by a hilly plateau called Gebel Mariam. Here, it is<br/>
said, Mary rested when she fled with the young child into<br/>
Egypt. The hills rise like an amphitheatre on the north<br/>
and east sides of the lake.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismailia </span>stands by the shore of Lake Timsah. It is<br/>
a thriving town of about 5000 persons; very healthy as<br/>
combining the desert air with the sea-shore advantages. A<br/>
few years ago no breathing animal could have lived here.<br/>
