BACKSHEESH.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere, from morning till night, the traveller will be<br/>
tormented with applications for backsheesh, which has been<br/>
called the alpha and omega of eastern travel. It is the first<br/>
word an infant is taught to lisp; it will probably be the first<br/>
Arabic word the traveller will hear on arriving in Egypt, and<br/>
the last as he leaves it. The word simply means "a gift," but<br/>
is applied generally to gratuity or fee, and is expected no less<br/>
by the naked children who swarm around the traveller when he<br/>
arrives in a village, than by the enlightened officials of the<br/>
Custom House, or other public institutions. If each <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller<br/>
