<span>ALEXANDRIA. 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>Cleopatra's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Needles-muse </span>are two obelisks of<br/>
red granite, one standing erect, and the other lying prostrate,<br/>
almost buried in earth and rubbish. The upright column is<br/>
seventy-one feet high; on one side the hieroglyphics are<br/>
almost worn out, on the other side they are sharp and distinct. These columns bear the names of Thothmes III.,<br/>
Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, and Sethi <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span>. The first of these monarchs, in<br/>
whose reign the stone for these <span style="color: #0000FF;">immense </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>was<br/>
quarried, reigned over Egypt in 149 5 3.0.; so that in gazing<br/>
at these memorials, we are taken back through nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtyfour </span>centuries of the world's history. They originally stood<br/>
in front of the Temple of Neptune at Heliopolis, and were<br/>
subsequently removed to the Caesarium at Alexandria<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but<br/>
whether by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleopatra</span>, whose name they bear, or at a later<br/>
date, is uncertain. The fallen column was offered as a gift<br/>
to the English nation by Mahomed Ali, but it appears never<br/>
to have been deemed worth the cost of removal, and it is<br/>
now so worn and dilapidated that its transmission to <span style="color: #0000FF;">En </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gland<br/>
</span>is less probable than ever it was.<br/>
<br/>
On the banks of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal are the<br/>
residences of some of the grandees of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria-large</span>,<br/>
cool houses, standing in parched and dusty grounds. This<br/>
canal was formed by Mahomed Ali in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1819</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20</span>. A quarter<br/>
of a million of men were forced to aid in its construction,<br/>
and there was an awful sacrifice of human life by sickness<br/>
and privation before it was completed. It is cut from<br/>
Alexandria to Atfeh, on the Rosetta branch of the Nile.<br/>
On the right bank, near Alexandria, is the fashionable promenade of the city. Close at hand are the beautiful gardens<br/>
of the Viceroy, which are open to the public. A band plays<br/>
on Sundays and Fridays. Here streams of water flow,<br/>
and everything looks beautifully fresh, green, and novel.<br/>
The visitor is surrounded by many kinds of trees--<span style="color: #0000FF;">orange</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
