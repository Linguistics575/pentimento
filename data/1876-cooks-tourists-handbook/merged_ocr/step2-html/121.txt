<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">AMUSEMENTS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AND </span>FESTIVALS.<br/>
<br/>
The chief places of public amusement in Cairo are the<br/>
Opera House, where Italian-opera is performed from<br/>
November to March, and the French Theatre. Both<br/>
these buildings are by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rEsbekeeyah</span>. At the Hippodrome, <span style="color: #0000FF;">8000 </span>spectators can witness equestrian and other<br/>
circus performances. There is also an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Open-air </span>theatre on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>One of the special sights of Cairo is the performance of<br/>
the Dancing Dervishes, which may be witnessed at<br/>
their Convent at 2 o'clock on Friday. The service consists<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">pirouetting </span>round and round to the sound of barbarous<br/>
music.<br/>
<br/>
There are several Cairene Festivals of great interest in<br/>
the course of the year (p. 84). The Departure of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pilgrims </span>for Mecca, carrying the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiswet-en-N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ebbee</span>, or new<br/>
lining for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">KÃ©aba </span>or Temple at Mecca, is a very important<br/>
festival. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiswet </span>is of rich silk, with gold embroidery.<br/>
The Return of the Pilgrims is also observed with some<br/>
ceremony. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eed-el-Kebeer</span>, or Greater Festival,<br/>
commences on the day of the Sacrifice by the Pilgrims at<br/>
Mecca, and commemorates the offering by Abraham of a<br/>
ram instead of (as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans </span>say) Ishmael. For three<br/>
days there is plenty of gun-firing, feasting and music, and<br/>
various amusements. At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eed-es-sugheiyer</span>, or<br/>
Lesser <span style="color: #ff0000;">Festival</span>, merriment and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rejoicing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>still more in the<br/>
ascendant. The Birthday of Mahomed is a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">fete</span>.<br/>
The rejoicings are kept up for a week, culminating on the<br/>
last day, when the Dervishes go in procession, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">subseonently </span>lie down, close packed, side by side, and form a living<br/>
pathway for their Sheikh to ride over them. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cutting<br/>
