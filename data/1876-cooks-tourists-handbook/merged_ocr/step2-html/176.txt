portals of the palaces and temples if it meant anything.<br/>
But it is more consistent with the context to accept it simply<br/>
as poetical imagery.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Thebes has always marvellously impressed the mind and<br/>
imagination of travellers by its extent and the vastness of<br/>
its monuments. There are temples whose front elevation<br/>
was nearly a mile in length, fragments of colossal statues<br/>
of dimension truly enormous, colonnades that rose to over<br/>
seventy feet in height. Not only do these ruins extend<br/>
over the whole breadth of the Nile Valley, but on the sides<br/>
of the surrounding mountains ancient remains lie in heaps,<br/>
whilst tombs, still in good preservation, cover the western<br/>
plain and stretch far out into the desert. "It appeared to<br/>
me," said Belzoni, "like entering a city of the giants, who<br/>
after a long conflict had been all destroyed, leaving the<br/>
ruins of their vast temples as the only proofs of their existence.<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The plain of Thebes is thus described by Heeren. "The<br/>
whole valley of the Nile in Upper Egypt offers no spot so<br/>
fit for the foundation of a large capital. The mountain<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chains-the </span>Libyan on the western, and the other, usually<br/>
called the Arabian, on the eastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-retire </span>here to such<br/>
a distance on either side of the river that they leave a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious </span>plain on both banks, whose breadth, from west to<br/>
east, amounts to about three leagues and a half, and the<br/>
length, from north to south, is about the same....<br/>
Towards the north, this plain is again closed in by the near<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>"Not all proud Thebes' unrivalled walls contain,<br/>
The world's great Empress on the Egyptian plain,<br/>
That spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
</span>And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,<br/>
Two hundred horsemen, and two hundred cars,<br/>
From each wide portal <span style="color: #0000FF;">issuing </span>to the wars.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
