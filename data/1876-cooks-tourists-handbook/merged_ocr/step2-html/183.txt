Towards the middle of the tomb are the chambers which<br/>
chiefly merit attention. Very varied scenes are represented<br/>
amongst others the famous harpists may be noticed of<br/>
which so many copies have been made.<br/>
<br/>
This tomb received its common name from the traveller<br/>
Bruce, who was the first to make it known to Europeans.<br/>
There was once a sarcophagus of red granite in the principal<br/>
chamber of this tomb, of which the lid is now at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambridge<br/>
</span>and the other portion at the Louvre.<br/>
<br/>
Greek graffiti are found in the tomb we are describing,<br/>
as in many others; these show that they were visited by<br/>
strangers in the Ptolemaic era, and were probably those from<br/>
which the royal mummies had been taken and dispersed by<br/>
Cambyses.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Sethi II. (No. 15) is distinguished by<br/>
figures in high relief at the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Rameses IV. (No. 2) is distinguished<br/>
by its high ceiling and slight inclination, so that it could be<br/>
easily visited on horseback<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at the end of the tomb the<br/>
granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>of colossal proportions is still in its<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Tomb of Rameses VI. (No. 9) is 243 feet in<br/>
length, and is remarkable for the astronomical <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>on its ceilings. In Ptolemaic times, for some unknown<br/>
reason, this tomb, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>is shown by the Greek inscriptions,<br/>
was called the Tomb of Memnon.<br/>
<br/>
Tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Rameses IX. (No. 6) contains very striking pictures representing the idea of resurrection after<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Molook </span>tourists can return by either of<br/>
two or three routes. There is one interesting route over<br/>
the mountain chain which should be taken if possible.<br/>
The finest view in Egypt will be seen, and a better idea <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
