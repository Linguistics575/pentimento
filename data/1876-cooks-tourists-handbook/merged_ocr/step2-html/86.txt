</span>lemon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">citron</span>, pepper, and castor-oil; and the flowers and<br/>
shrubs are luxuriant, and of great variety.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of the 1001 Columns will, of course,<br/>
remind the visitor of the 1001 nights of Arabian story. It<br/>
is said to occupy the site of the old Church of <span style="color: #ff0000;">St. </span>Mark,<br/>
which commemorated the scene of the Evangelist's martyrdom. In the Mosque of St. Athanasius, so named<br/>
from a pre-existent church, was found the sarcophagus now<br/>
in the British Museum, once known as "the Tomb of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Islander</span>," but evidently of Pharaonic origin.<br/>
<br/>
The Convents and Churches of Alexandria <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>nothing<br/>
of importance to detain the visitor. The Coptic Convent<br/>
of St. Mark does not contain the body of the Evangelist,<br/>
as pretended. That was taken to Venice in the ninth century. The Greek Church is neither ancient nor handsome. Some relics of St. Catherine are shown here. The<br/>
Latin Church, and the other ecclesiastical edifices of<br/>
Alexandria, are devoid of general interest.<br/>
<br/>
There are several interesting Schools, Hospitals, and<br/>
similar institutions in Alexandria. There is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naval<br/>
</span>School, under Captain MacKillop, Pasha, R.N., the School of<br/>
Les <span style="color: #0000FF;">Freres </span>del'Ecole Chr√©tienne, with 600 pupils, and some<br/>
other denominational establishments. Amongst the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hospitals</span>, that of the Deaconesses of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kaiserswerth </span>is exceedingly interesting, and well worthy of support.<br/>
<br/>
The Catacombs are about three miles from the Great<br/>
Square. They can be visited either by land or by sea. They<br/>
are of great extent, and the interior decoration is of good<br/>
and elegant workmanship.<br/>
<br/>
The so-called Baths of Cleopatra can be inspected<br/>
on returning by land to the city. They are simply some<br/>
excavations at the edge of the shore, and were probably<br/>
ancient tombs<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
