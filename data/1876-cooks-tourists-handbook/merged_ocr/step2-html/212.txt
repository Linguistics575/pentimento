<br/>
A small Temple of Athor, built by Nectanebo <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>,<br/>
near the southern end of the corridor.<br/>
<br/>
The so-called Pharaoh's Bed, on the east of the<br/>
island, a Ptolemaic edifice.<br/>
<br/>
An arched gate and staircase, connected with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">landingplace</span>, fragments of a Roman wall, and portions of the quay<br/>
that once surrounded the island, with various isolated<br/>
portions of ancient edifices, are also to be seen. In addition<br/>
there are some brick ruins of the Christian epoch.<br/>
<br/>
The adjacent island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biggeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>fine views of<br/>
Philae, especially from the rocks at the southern extremity.<br/>
On the island are portions of ruins of small Egyptian<br/>
temples, Christian churches, and Mahomedan mosques.<br/>
<br/>
Mahatta is a village on the east bank of the Nile,<br/>
between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>and the Cataract, where those wishing to make<br/>
the Descent <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Cataract can arrange to do so, but,<br/>
like the ascent, it is, to most, more interesting to watch from<br/>
the shore than to experience. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahatta</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">also</span>, dahabeahs<br/>
for the journey to the Second Cataract can be procured by<br/>
those who prefer that mode of travel. For the arrangements<br/>
made for proceeding by steamer to the Second Cataract at<br/>

Nubia in its widest sense comprehends the Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dependency</span>, bounded north by Upper Egypt, south by<br/>
Abyssinia, east by the Red Sea, and west by the Sahara;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">properly </span>speaking, the name only applies to the more<br/>
northern portion of this territory, along the Valley of the<br/>
Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the southern limit of Egypt to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">southern<br/>
