<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
Endless it would be to enter <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>details of this marvellous<br/>
pile; suffice it to say that the temple is about one mile and<br/>
three quarters in circumference, the walls eighty feet high<br/>
and twenty-five feet thick."<br/>
<br/>
The visitor enters the temple by the enormous propylon,<br/>
370 feet in breadth, and with one tower standing 140 feet in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">height</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>this tower can be ascended, and a good view<br/>
of the plan of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">obtained</span>. Through a court<br/>
surrounded by corridors, and with a small temple built by<br/>
Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, another immense propylon is reached with<br/>
statues of Rameses III. in red granite, and the Grand Hall<br/>
is then entered, whose columns are alluded to in the extract<br/>
given above. The most ancient cartouches in this hall are<br/>
those of Sethi I. (1450 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>.), but there is reason to infer<br/>
that Sethi was not the constructor of this hall, but that to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span>III. is due the honour of its erection. Originally<br/>
the hall was completely roofed <span style="color: #0000FF;">in-daylight </span>only came in by<br/>
the grilled windows, of which traces are still visible<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the<br/>
hall would therefore be pervaded, as M. Mariette points out,<br/>
by a sort of "dim religious light" very favourable to the<br/>
general effect by softening the crudity of the paintings on<br/>
the columns and ceilings.<br/>
<br/>
Through another <span style="color: #0000FF;">propylon</span>, much dilapidated, <span style="color: #ff0000;">anarrow<br/>
</span>court running across the building is <span style="color: #0000FF;">entered</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>here once<br/>
stood two obelisks of red granite, only one is now standing.<br/>
The names of Thothmes I. and Rameses II. are inscribed.<br/>
<br/>
A smaller propylon conducts to a court surrounded by<br/>
Osiride pillars<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>in which is standing the largest obelisk<br/>
known, being <span style="color: #0000FF;">ninety-two </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feet </span>in height and eight feet square,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>By this term is described the columns frequent in Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">arhitecture</span>, in which a figure of Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">adoss√© </span>"( as the French<br/>
say) to the column<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
