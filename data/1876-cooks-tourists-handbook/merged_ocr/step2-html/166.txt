tains several mosques, a Coptic monastery, and a Franciscan<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hospice </span>of refuge for persecuted Christians. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">remains </span>of two temples in the vicinity and some other ruins were<br/>
part of ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Panopolis</span>. Of this city, some have asserted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>to be the oldest in Egypt, assigning its foundation to<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ekhmeem</span>, son of Misraim, the offspring of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cash</span>, the son<br/>
of Ham." <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nestorius </span>died at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ekhmeem </span>in the fifth century.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mensheeyah </span>(W.), 318 miles from Cairo, has an ancient<br/>
stone quay. There is an excellent market. Here is produced the celebrated sweetmeat "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mensheeyeh-el-Neideh</span>."<br/>
The cemetery is extensive and curious, and the dead are<br/>
brought to it from a considerable distance round, as it is<br/>
above the level of the inundation. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemiis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hermii </span>was the<br/>
ancient Egyptian city <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>existing in this neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is now skirted for some distance on the east<br/>
bank by the hills called the Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tookh</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aysemt</span>, noted<br/>
for turkeys, is passed on the west bank<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Girgeh (<span style="color: #0000FF;">F</span>), named from its monastery of St. George, is<br/>
a dirty, uninteresting place. The church is half-buried<br/>
underground, formed of stone from the old ruins. It contains<br/>
a handsome screen of fretted woodwork, a wooden communion-table (stone altars being forbidden by the Alexandrian<br/>
Church), and some early <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>Liturgies, Coptic Scriptures, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bellianeh </span>(W.) This is the point from which to visit<br/>
the magnificent ruins of Abydos.<br/>
<br/>
Abydos is reached by a journey of six miles across the<br/>
plain on donkeys to the edge of the desert. Its most<br/>
ancient name was Thinis or This, famous as the birthplace<br/>
of Menes, and reputed burial-place of Osiris, and second<br/>
only to Thebes amongst the cities of Upper Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor to Abydos finds four principal objects <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">attraction-the </span>Temple of Sethi, the New Tablet of Abydos,<br/>
the Temple of Rameses, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
