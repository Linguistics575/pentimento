<span>MOSQUES. 45<br/>
<br/>
Mosque building about a century after the Hegira, and gradually the Saracenic style of architecture predominated<br/>
throughout the Mahomedan world. The chief Egyptian<br/>
Mosques are Saracenic.<br/>
<br/>
Islamism is an enemy to plastic art; in the Mosques are<br/>
found no pictures, no statues, no representations of living<br/>
creatures. Inscriptions from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kur-an</span>, a single <span style="color: #ff0000;">readingchair</span>, a pulpit, and numerous praying mats, are all that<br/>
adorns the interior of these immense edifices. Most of the<br/>
Mosques have considerable endowments in connection with<br/>
them, for purposes of education, piety, or benevolence.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Mosques contain almost nothing in them<br/>
except the worshippers, and none of the paintings or sculpture so common in <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>cathedrals, yet it must be<br/>
admitted that the Muslim artist does all he can to attain<br/>
elegance of form and harmony of colour, without infringing<br/>
his religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">sample</span>. The subject is well commented on<br/>
in the following passage from Mr. Ruskin's Stones <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>"It was contrary to the religion of the Arab to introduce<br/>
any animal form into his ornament<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but although all the<br/>
radiance of colour, all the refinements of proportion, and all<br/>
the intricacies of geometrical design were <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>to him, he<br/>
could not produce any noble work without an abstraction <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>. the forms of leafage, to be used in his capitals, and made the<br/>
ground plan of his chased ornaments. But I have above<br/>
noted that colouring is an entirely distinct and independent<br/>
art; and in the' Seven Lamps' we saw that this art had<br/>
most power when practised in arrangements of simple geometrical form<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage<br/>
in colouring, and he had all the noble elements of constructive and proportional beauty at his command; he might not<br/>
imitate the sea-shell, but he could build the dome. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
