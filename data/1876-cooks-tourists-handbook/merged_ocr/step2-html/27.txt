<br/>
</span>NILE TOURS TO THE FIRST AND SECOND<br/>
CATARACTS<br/>
For eight years the agency for Nile Tours has been committed to Messrs. COOK & SON by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive </span>Administration.<br/>
During that time constant improvements have been made in the<br/>
service; steamers have been converted into deck saloons and<br/>
the sleeping berths greatly improved. The food supplies have<br/>
been under their control to a great extent, and will be emphatically so in the future, as they intend to exercise more rigid<br/>
regulations for the interest and comfort of voyagers. Contractors,<br/>
dragomans, and servants of every grade will be most vigilantly<br/>
watched and rigidly dealt with if any incivility or inattention is<br/>
shown to passengers. The extension of arrangements for the<br/>
Second Cataract will be improved, and no doubt ere long a class<br/>
of steamers will <span style="color: #ff0000;">navigate </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lthe </span>Nile that will ensure a splendid<br/>
traffic.<br/>
<br/>
The service of each season will begin about the second<br/>
week in November, and Nile trips may precede or follow<br/>
trips to Palestine, as most convenient to the travellers who<br/>
wish to embrace the two objects in one visit to the East.<br/>
The trips to the First Cataract and back occupy twenty<br/>
days, and fourteen more are allowed for trips to the Second<br/>
Cataract<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>DAHABEAHS can also be secured on the best terms for all<br/>
who desire them, and dragomans and other necessary servants<br/>
and food supplies can be arranged by them on the best terms.<br/>
Messrs. COOK & SON'S office at Cairo, on the grounds of Shepheard's Hotel, affords excellent facilities for the management of<br/>
this business. Early application is necessary to secure the best<br/>
boats and the best men.<br/>
<br/>
TRIPS TO THE PYRAMIDS<br/>
<br/>
constitute a feature of all Eastern Tours. Personally-Conducted Tours always include a full week in Lower Egypt,<br/>
