under the Caliph Omar. The Caesareum has left a remnant of its greatness in the so-called Cleopatra's Needles.<br/>
Many other buildings might be enumerated, but as the tourist<br/>
would look in vain for any sign of their former existence,<br/>
this brief description will suffice to give some notion of the<br/>
former grandeur of Alexandria.<br/>
<br/>
When, in 640 A.D., Amer, the general of the Caliph<br/>
Omar, subdued Egypt, Alexandria had considerably declined,<br/>
but was still a great city. "I have taken the great city of<br/>
the West," he says, in writing to the Caliph. "It is impossible for me to enumerate the variety of its richness and<br/>
beauty, and I shall content myself with observing that it contains 4000 palaces, 400 baths, 400 theatres or places of<br/>
amusement, 12,000 shops for the sale of vegetables, and<br/>
40,000 tributary Jews."<br/>
<br/>
Passing over a dozen centuries, during which Alexandria<br/>
had gradually declined under the successive rule of the<br/>
Caliphs, Sultans, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>, we find the city at the<br/>
time of the French invasion had become small, <span style="color: #ff0000;">povertystricken</span>, and insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
During the present century a vast change has taken<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahomed </span>Ali rose to power "( 1804), says the<br/>
author of The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crescent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the Cross, "his clear intellect at once<br/>
comprehended the importance of the ancient emporium.<br/>
Alexandria was then become a mere harbour for <span style="color: #0000FF;">pirates-the<br/>
</span>desert and the sea were gradually encroaching on its <span style="color: #0000FF;">boundaries</span>. But the Pasha ordered the desert to bring forth corn<br/>
and the sea to retire<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the mandate of this Eastern<br/>
Canute was no idle word, it acted like an incantation to the<br/>
old Egyptian spirit of great works. Up rose a stately city,<br/>
containing 60,000 inhabitants, and as suddenly yawned the<br/>
<br/>
canal, which was to connect the new city with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
