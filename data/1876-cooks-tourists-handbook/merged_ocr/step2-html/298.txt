<br/>
whilst in every direction shepherds and herdsmen are seen<br/>
watching their flocks and herds, to keep them from straying<br/>
beyond the landmarks on to other fields.<br/>
<br/>
On the second day after leaving Kadesh, the Hill<br/>
Country of Judah is entered, and the ancient pass leading<br/>
towards Hebron is ascended. To the right lies the Dead<br/>
Sea<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but too much in the hollow to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>to the left is<br/>
the region between Beersheba and Hebron. Hills are seen<br/>
terraced to the summit, and wherever the rocks admit, crops<br/>
are seen growing, or husbandmen preparing the soil. The<br/>
plough is just such an instrument as was used thirty centuries <span style="color: #0000FF;">ago-two </span>pieces of wood with an iron point, mostly<br/>
drawn by oxen, sometimes by a camel.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller is now in the region in which David was<br/>
hunted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Saul </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>it is full of large caves, in many of which<br/>
the former may have hidden from the jealous king. The<br/>
route passes near Tell'Arad, which marks the site mentioned<br/>
in Josh. xii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>as a royal city of the Canaanites 5 also alluded<br/>
to in Num. xxi. I and xxxiii. 40, where "King Arad the<br/>
Canaanite "should read "the Canaanite King of Arad."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurmel </span>is the ancient Carmel, mentioned in Josh.<br/>
xv. <span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>. Here Nabal dwelt and sheared his sheep, and<br/>
churlishly repulsed the messengers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">David </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>and from<br/>
hence David took his favourite wife, "Abigail the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Carmelitess</span>" (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Sam. xxv.) In I Sam. xv. 12 we read of<br/>
Carmel in connection with Saul's return from the slaughter<br/>
of the Amalekites. Here were situated the vineyards of<br/>
King Uzziah (<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Chron. xxvi. <span style="color: #0000FF;">so</span>). When Eusebius wrote<br/>
there was a Roman garrison in this town. The extensive<br/>
ruins now seen are entirely of mediaeval origin.<br/>
<br/>
"The whole scene," says a recent traveller, "exactly<br/>
corresponds with the narrative. It is situated among rocky<br/>
hills fitted only for sheep pastures, and still used as such<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
