<span>19 2 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
so of columns appertaining to a small temple at the southern<br/>
extremity of the island, are a memorial of the king just<br/>
named, and in the great Ptolemaic temple, to be presently<br/>
described, the great gate of the propylon also bears the name<br/>
of Nectanebo, and is probably a relic of some earlier pile.<br/>
Under the Ptolemies and Emperors the island became covered<br/>
with religious edifices. From inscriptions on these it is<br/>
evident that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>was the last stronghold of the ancient<br/>
faith. Sixty years after Theodosius had by edict abolished<br/>
the Egyptian religion, Isis and Osiris were worshipped here,<br/>
and families of Egyptian priests had their dwelling place in<br/>
the island. Even under the reign of the Emperor Marcian,<br/>
this state of things continued, and to Philae, as to a Sacred<br/>
Island, the scattered votaries of the ancient gods of Egypt<br/>
turned with loving eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian deities were mostly worshipped in Triads.<br/>
The three to whom <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>was dedicated were Osiris, Isis,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>. Osiris was the first of Egyptian gods, and the<br/>
future judge of the dead, chiefly revered for his manifestation as incarnate god, his being sacrificed to Typhon, the<br/>
evil principle, and his resurrection. All these themes are<br/>
set forth in the sculptures of the sacred isle. In the name<br/>
of Osiris, the dead who passed the judgment were absolved<br/>
from sin and obtained eternal felicity. Isis, consort of<br/>
Osiris, was the first and loveliest of Egyptian goddesses,<br/>
and symbolized the earth or matter; whilst Osiris, her<br/>
spouse, represented the creative principle. Horus, the child<br/>
of these two, was the avenger of his father, and the conqueror<br/>
of the serpentine Typhon. Bearing these myths in his mind<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>the visitor will understand many of the sculptures at Philae.<br/>
<br/>
The principal ruins on the island are those of the great<br/>
Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Isis, founded by Ptolemy IL, or Philadelphus,<br/>
and comprising various additions made by later monarchs<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
