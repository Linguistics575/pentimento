<br/>
MODERN CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
is situated about twenty miles from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">.Delta </span>on the east<br/>
bank of the Nile, and contains a population of about 360,000.<br/>
Less exclusively Oriental than Damascus, and far less <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>than Alexandria, it possesses a character of its <span style="color: #ff0000;">own</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>and at every step the traveller is entertained by the aspect of<br/>
the streets he passes through, and the wonderful medley of<br/>
human life pouring along the (mostly narrow) thoroughfares.<br/>
Cairo, however, is still the city of Arabian Nights, and all<br/>
who are well up in those veracious chronicles will find themselves perpetually localizing the scenes and individualizing<br/>
the characters of which Scheherazade chattered so well and<br/>
to such <span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>purpose.<br/>
<br/>
The following description of the general aspect of Cairo<br/>
is by the French painter <span style="color: #0000FF;">Marilhat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>"The city lies before you like the thousand little turrets<br/>
of a Gothic edifice<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at the foot of a steep whitish mountain,<br/>
flanked by a citadel of towers and white domes, in the<br/>
Turkish taste. On one side, towards the mountain, is the<br/>
desert, in all its aridity and <span style="color: #0000FF;">desolation-its </span>loneliness increased by the City of the Tombs, with its streets and houses,<br/>
and quarters, and palaces, but no living inhabitants except<br/>
reptiles and solitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">birds-immense </span>vultures perching on<br/>
the minarets like the vedettes of this melancholy population.<br/>
On the other side, towards the Nile, are fields covered with<br/>
brilliant verdure, and at certain periods with charming pieces<br/>
of water, the remains of the annual inundation, sparkling<br/>
like mirrors in the midst of the greenness. Between these<br/>
two contrasting scenes stands the city, perfectly in harmony<br/>
with this singular landscape, an immense assemblage <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
