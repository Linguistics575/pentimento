<span>PENINSULA or SINAI. 24.7<br/>
<br/>
and peaks amongst which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédies </span>wind. Often the<br/>
traveller appears to be hemmed in in a complete cul de sac,<br/>
till, on advancing, an easy and ample passage suddenly opens<br/>
where least looked for.<br/>
<br/>
The scenery is, for the most part, exceedingly sterile.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neither </span>house nor garden, nor fence nor tree is seen for miles<br/>
and miles<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>only sand and rock, and occasionally a few small<br/>
bushes. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocky </span>cliffs are devoid of vegetation, and yet<br/>
possess a beauty of their own. "I cannot recall," says a<br/>
recent traveller in these regions, "a single aiguille or needle<br/>
such as constitute the glory of the Bernese Oberland<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>yet<br/>
still the variety of form and colour, and direction and constituent elements, is such, as continually to awaken admiration. Now it is a sandstone formation, scaled off by wind<br/>
and rain so as to look exactly like some old ruined <span style="color: #0000FF;">castle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>then again a huge mass of porphyritic granite rears itself in<br/>
one precipitous cliff. Sometimes the lofty walls of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy<br/>
</span>approach at one end within fifty feet of each other, as at the<br/>
Gates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feirén </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">257</span>), and these stand for several yards<br/>
as steep and smooth as if cut out by hand. Or, again, as at<br/>
a point a little below the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-el-Azim</span>, the cliffs of red<br/>
granite shoot out from their roots a low spur of grey granite<br/>
on each side, and these, almost meeting, give the appearance<br/>
of a gigantic gateway, at which you almost expect to see a<br/>
portcullis or a sentinel in armour. Yet even apart from<br/>
these exceptional cases, there is a charm in the very nakedness of the rocks which causes them to stand out each in<br/>
its own distinctive character. Often they are striped with<br/>
numberless veins of a brilliant hue, or shaped into rare and<br/>
fantastic forms. The unequalled clearness of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">atmosphere </span>gives peculiar power to light and shade, and often the<br/>
sunlight will cover a distant peak with purple and gold,<br/>
while nearer hills lie in deep shadow, and intermediate <span style="color: #ff0000;">cliffs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
