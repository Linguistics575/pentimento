<span>ABYDOS. 153<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tuary </span>as venerated by the ancient Egyptians as the Holy<br/>
Sepulchre by Christians" In this enclosure is a mound<br/>
called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kom- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Sultan</span>, formed of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">débris </span>of myriads<br/>
of tombs through successive ages. <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>Mariette hopes to<br/>
find, through the excavations now in progress, the tomb of<br/>
Osiris beneath this mound<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>The rich and powerful of the<br/>
Egyptians," says Plutarch, "are desirous <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">being </span>buried at<br/>
Abydos, in order to be, as it were, in the same grave with<br/>
Osiris himself." It is conjectured that it is the graves of these<br/>
worthies that have gradually formed the mound just described.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">NecrOpolis</span>, from which four-fifths of the stelae<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boulék </span>Museum, and many other objects, were<br/>
derived, is so completely altered and overturned as to present<br/>
little of interest to the general visitor. The tombs are chiefly<br/>
of the sixth dynasty (3700 <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.), the twelfth dynasty (3000<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.), and the thirteenth dynasty (2800 <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.) Those of the<br/>
latter epoch are mostly in the form of a pyramid of crude<br/>
brick, the interior being hollowed out into a cupola. But<br/>
amongst the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earliest </span>tombs (sixth dynasty) in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>,<br/>
a vaulted roof with a true arch, with bricks <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>formed<br/>
for its construction, is not unfrequent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshoot </span>(368 miles from Cairo) contains another of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s sugar factories. This district is inhabited by<br/>
descendants of the once powerful <span style="color: #ff0000;">Howéra </span>Arabs.<br/>
<br/>
From Girgeh to Keneh the scenery is in many parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">very<br/>
</span>fine. Theban palms, dates, and acacias are abundant<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Indian<br/>
corn, sugar-cane, and various leguminous herbs, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourishing </span>luxuriantly over the fertile land that delights the eye<br/>
with its perpetual greenness. Numerous small places are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">passed-amongst </span>them <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bajoom </span>(W.), How (W., anciently<br/>
Diospolis Parva), Kasr es <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sydd</span>, the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chenoboscion</span>,<br/>
formerly celebrated for its geese and now the largest <span style="color: #0000FF;">depth </span>of<br/>
turkeys on the Nile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dishneh </span>(W.) and Fow (E.<span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
