<br/>
presented in sculpture adoring the gods of the cataract.<br/>
Some of these are memorials of generals or princes commemorating their expeditions. The little island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehtiyl<br/>
</span>in the cataract is covered with these souvenirs, and from<br/>
them many historical facts, now universally accepted, have<br/>
been discovered.<br/>
<br/>
The view of Philae from the opposite shore is well<br/>
described by the poetical author of The Crescent and the<br/>
Cross. <span style="color: #ff0000;">*</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>All round us towered up vast masses of gloomy<br/>
rocks, piled one upon the other in the wildest <span style="color: #ff0000;">confusion</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>some of them, as it were, skeletons of pyramids; others<br/>
requiring only a few strokes of giant labour to form colossal<br/>
statues that might have startled the Anakim. Here spreads<br/>
a deep drift of silvery sand, fringed by rich verdure and<br/>
purple blossoms; there a grove of palms, intermingled with<br/>
the flowering acacia; and there through vistas of craggy<br/>
cliffs and plumy foliage, gleams a calm blue lake; with<br/>
the Sacred Island in the midst, <span style="color: #0000FF;">greed </span>to the water's<br/>
edge, except where the walls of the old temple city are<br/>
reflected. Above those shrub-tangled and pillared banks<br/>
were tall pyramids; columns airy yet massive in their proportion; palms, and towers, and terraces. Beyond the<br/>
island, the lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">glimmer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>through the ruins, and the whole<br/>
scene of peace and beauty is embosomed in a mountain<br/>
frowned over by a girdle of rugged mountains, all scattered<br/>
and dark, and desolate: withal, there was an air of repose,<br/>
of awe, and perfect calm over the whole region round, that<br/>
suited well with its character, and with the solemn purposes<br/>
to which it was consecrated."<br/>
<br/>
A few words will suffice for the history of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>. Its<br/>
most ancient monuments only date from a little prior to the<br/>
foundation of Alexandria, as no name earlier than that of<br/>
Nectanebo II. has been found on the island. The dozen <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
