<span>124. EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the mention of On (or Heliopolis) in<br/>
Gen. xli. 45, as being the place where <span style="color: #ff0000;">Poti-pherah </span>(whose<br/>
daughter Asenath was married to Joseph) was <span style="color: #0000FF;">priest-some<br/>
</span>other notices occur in the Scriptures. In Jer. xliii. 13, this<br/>
city is called Beth-shemesh, a term of similar meaning to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, City of the Sun. The passage referred to is,<br/>
"He shall break all the images of Beth-shemesh that is in<br/>
the land of Egypt, and the house of the gods of the Egyptians shall He burn with fire." In Ezek. xxx. 17, the place<br/>
is called Aven, and the destruction of its young men by the<br/>
sword foretold. Josephus says that On was the city given<br/>
for a residence to the family of Jacob on their first arrival in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
</span>North-east of Heliopolis are the ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aboo-Kesheyd</span>,<br/>
where are three figures cut on the granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-one </span>a<br/>
king, and the others divinities. This is thought by some to<br/>
represent all that is left of Rameses, the treasure city built<br/>
by the Israelites (Gen. xlvii. II <span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>Exod. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Num.<br/>
xxxiii. 2).<br/>
<br/>
Heliopolis, the Egyptian An, and Hebrew On, was also<br/>
called Ra, the City of the Sun, an appellation which its<br/>
Greek name has perpetuated. Already existing under the<br/>
ancient Empire, and flourishing long after as a great sacerdotal city, to whose colleges Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">philosophers </span>came to<br/>
learn wisdom from Egyptian priests, the story of its decadence is unknown. Strabo came here, and found only ruins<br/>
and desert. To-day all that remains of Heliopolis is the enclosure of the Temple and the wonderful Obelisk. Within<br/>
the enclosure referred to are ruins of houses, but these are<br/>
not the remains of the ancient city. They show how in the<br/>
Christian era a Coptic settlement used the walls of the<br/>
ancient Temple as an enclosure for a new town. Heliopolis<br/>
itself has disappeared to its very foundations, but doubtless <span style="color: #0000FF;">if<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
