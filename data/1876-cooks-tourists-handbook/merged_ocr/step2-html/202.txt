<span>186 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
a mile in length by fifty or sixty feet wide and eighty<br/>
deep. Many large masses remain as they were left by the<br/>
workmen, and all the processes of quarrying are plainly<br/>
exhibited."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kom-Omboo </span>(E.) presents an interesting relic<br/>
doomed to destruction, for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>is gradually undermining all that is left of the double temple where the<br/>
principle of light, under the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>, and the principle of darkness, under the form of the Crocodile God<br/>
Sebek, were worshipped by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ombites</span>. Here was the<br/>
tank where the sacred crocodile bathed, and the brick terrace where he took his daily "constitutional." This edifice,<br/>
reared by Greek princes, successors of Alexander, bears the<br/>
names of various Ptolemies.<br/>
<br/>
The journey from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omboo </span>to Assouan is not long<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>after<br/>
a few hours' journey, hills rise towards the south crowned<br/>
with forts; a green island is seen dividing the river into<br/>
two parts; to the left several white houses glitter in the midst<br/>
of an oasis of date-palms. Assouan seems to stand at the end<br/>
_ of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, as the eye, looking forward, vainly seeks an<br/>
opening for the river's course.<br/>
<br/>
"Assouan astonishes the traveller," says M. Mariette,<br/>
"one is tempted to think oneself in a new world; Egyptians,<br/>
Turks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barabras</span>, half-naked <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bicharis</span>, and Negroes of every<br/>
kind mingle here; the inhabitants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartoum </span>are especially striking by their grand mien, black faces, and their fine<br/>
heads, reminding one of the best types of northern races;<br/>
to complete the picture, the merchandise consists of exotic<br/>
gums, elephants' teeth, and the skins of beasts; in the<br/>
midst of the crowd circulate the hawkers, no longer dealing<br/>
in antiquities, but in clubs of ebony, pikes, lances, and<br/>
arrows, whose iron points are said to be poisoned."<br/>
<br/>
Assouan contains about 4000 inhabitants. It is <span style="color: #ff0000;">580<br/>
<br/>
