<span>MOUNT <span style="color: #0000FF;">SERBAL</span>. 253<br/>
<br/>
route diverges, which can be examined on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>return journey<br/>
by those who do not intend to proceed beyond Mount Sinai<br/>
(p. 260), the road now being described continues along the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Waldy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taiyibeh</span>, which is a wild but magnificent valley,<br/>
with intervals of vegetation, with stupendous ranges of rocks<br/>
on each side, often rising to the height of a thousand feet,<br/>
and very beautiful in their varied forms and colours. The<br/>
prevailing tint is a deep rich brown blended with light <span style="color: #0000FF;">chalk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>colour, with red, and sometimes with a deep black.<br/>
There is no doubt that Israel passed through this wonderful<br/>
valley, and then (as modern travellers still do) encamped by<br/>
the sea.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, "'the scene,' says the Rev. Dr. Harvey,<br/>
"is one of the grandest that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nature </span>affords. On the<br/>
west the sun was setting in marvellous splendour beyond<br/>
the sea, sinking behind the distant Arabian range. On the<br/>
north-east are piles of mountains, dark, but many hued, over<br/>
which towers in majesty, Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbél</span>, the rival of Sinai.<br/>
On the north the sea stretches its blue expanse towards Suez.<br/>
It would be difficult to find a grander spot on earth<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and we<br/>
can easily conceive the joy of Israel as the host emerged<br/>
from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taiyibeh</span>, and the dreary wastes of the wilderness, upon this great plain, and'encamped by the sea,' a<br/>
month after leaving the land of bondage."<br/>
<br/>
The dreary plains of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Murrkeiyeh </span>and El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Markhah</span>, by<br/>
the sea-side, are next crossed. At the promontory called the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rris </span>Aboo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeneemeh </span>is the tomb of the saint after whom<br/>
this headland is named. It is usually decorated with a very<br/>
miscellaneous assortment of gifts from the faithful. Along<br/>
the road, which is sometimes found very near to the edge of<br/>
the water, by projecting rocks the traveller proceeds to the<br/>
promontory projecting from the bold cliffs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebel-el-Markhah</span>. The flinty sandy plain of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Markhah </span>is then entered<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
