<span>1 72 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
The main part of the edifice consists of two immense<br/>
pyramidal towers. The exterior architecture merits careful<br/>
study, but it is in the interior decoration that the chief<br/>
interest of the palace centres. Here Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>is seen<br/>
at home, in the bosom of his family. One lady offers him<br/>
flowers<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in another picture he is caressing a favourite<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>in<br/>
a third he is invited by a lady to a game at draughts.<br/>
<br/>
In a building of such importance, Rameses was not<br/>
likely to omit to display himself as the great conqueror.<br/>
At the entry gate, he is shown presenting his prisoners<br/>
to the gods, and in these prisoners are very cleverly portrayed specimens of all the races inhabiting Western Asia,<br/>
Libya, and Soudan, in the thirteenth century before the<br/>
Christian Era. Similar pictures, with the ethnological<br/>
characteristics of the various races most carefully rendered,<br/>
are met with on various portions of the walls, and in the<br/>
inner courts of this palatial pile.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple to the north of the Palace is approached<br/>
by a doorway or pylon between the two towers. Over this<br/>
doorway are sculptures commemorating the victorious enterprises of Rameses against the Libyans and their allies. On<br/>
the northern facade of this pylon is a sculpture representing<br/>
the king receiving the falchion of vengeance from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Armachis</span>, who thus addresses the monarch, "I turn my<br/>
face toward the north, and I will that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phaenicia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">under<br/>
</span>thy feet; I will that the nations that acknowledge not Egypt,<br/>
bring thee their gold, their silver, and their precious stones.<br/>
<br/>
I turn my face toward the east <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>will that<br/>
Arabia provide thee perfumes and essences, rare woods, and<br/>
all its products, etc."<br/>
<br/>
The court now entered, measuring <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>by <span style="color: #ff0000;">13 </span>5 ft.,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>remarkable for the enormous Osiride columns, seven<br/>
in number, adorning one of its sides, and revealing <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
