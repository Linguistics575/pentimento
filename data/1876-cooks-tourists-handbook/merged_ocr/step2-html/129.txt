turies before the Christian era. The visitor must remember<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>different schools of Egyptologists differ at least<br/>
twenty centuries from each other in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">chronological</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>statements.<br/>
<br/>
Baron Bunsen claims for Egypt at least 6700 years of<br/>
civilized and well-governed prosperity before the building of<br/>
the Pyramids in the fourth Manetho dynasty. But Mr. Piazzi<br/>
Smyth believes that the Great Pyramid was the first reared<br/>
of Egyptian monuments, built immediately after the immigration into Egypt from the plains of Shinar, by Divine<br/>
Revelation for special objects. He considers the date of its<br/>
erection was 2170 <span style="color: #0000FF;">n.c.</span>, when the Pleiades were exactly<br/>
pointed at by the entrance passage. Those who are interested in seeing this theory very ingeniously worked out, and<br/>
the alleged relationship of the measurements of the Pyramid<br/>
to certain properties of the circle, the diurnal revolution of<br/>
the earth, and the standards of measure, weight, and capacity in various nations, should read Mr. Piazzi Smyth's work,<br/>
Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid. Mariette Bey, in<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">Itin√©raire </span>de la Haute Egypte, asserts that the Pyramids<br/>
are tombs, and nothing more, and in no case existing elsewhere than in a Necropolis.<br/>
<br/>
The Second Pyramid is assigned by Herodotus to<br/>
Cephrenes, the brother of Cheops. Cephrenes is considered<br/>
identical with the Shafra whose name is often found on<br/>
monuments. This Pyramid is 447 feet high, and has a base<br/>
line of 690 feet. This Pyramid is very difficult to ascend,<br/>
as towards the top the ancient polished casing still exists.<br/>
If the visitor cares to see the feat, one of the Arabs will run<br/>
down from the top of the Great Pyramid, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">across </span>to the<br/>
Second, and ascend to its summit, all in less than ten<br/>
minutes, for a trifling gratuity. The interior gallery and<br/>
chamber of this Pyramid were discovered by Belzoni <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
