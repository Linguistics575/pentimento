<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive </span>and the ladies of his harem, down to the<br/>
equivalent of a costermonger's cart; and every style of<br/>
person, from the ministers of state to the poorest fellah;<br/>
and every description of "mount," from the pure blood Arab<br/>
to the most jaded of sore-backed <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkeys</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and every variety<br/>
of costume, from the costly embroideries of Damascus to<br/>
the simplest calico fold around the waist, are to be seen<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
The palace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra </span>has nothing particular to distinguish<br/>
it from other Oriental palaces, but the gardens are <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>pretty;<br/>
orange, lemon, Citron, and pepper trees abound, and among<br/>
the flowers the <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>are intoxicating and the colours<br/>
dazzling. But the chief attraction is the Summer Palace,<br/>
having in the centre a large open basin, quite a miniature<br/>
lake, surrounded by a covered corridor of Carrara marble<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the midst of the lake is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marble island, supported on the<br/>
backs of crocodiles. Everywhere there are elegant lounges<br/>
spread abroad, and everywhere fountains are sending forth<br/>
their plashing waters. Coming from the glare and heat of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sun into the midst of this paradise of waters is like<br/>
realizing a fairy tale. In the four corners of the corridors<br/>
are divans elegantly fitted up with costly furniture and<br/>
massive curtains and hangings, the Turkish and European<br/>
styles being blended with considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. The drawingroom is gold and white satin; the ladies<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>room green satin<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">velvet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span>the billiard-room is a study on account of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elegance </span>of its details, every <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>being of wood inlaid <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
<br/>
</span>. costly materials, and of a curious device.<br/>
<br/>
HELIOPOLIS.<br/>
<br/>
From Cairo to the site of Heliopolis is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">five-miles</span>' drive,<br/>
for the most part shaded by plane trees and sycamores, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
