goals of travel they once were. Year by year the tide of<br/>
Tourists to these and other Eastern localities increases; and<br/>
to assist these in their necessarily brief and rapid survey, the<br/>
'present <span style="color: #0000FF;">volume </span>is prepared, which aims at being <span style="color: #0000FF;">cOmprehensive </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>voluminous, accurate though not tedious.<br/>
<br/>
From a great variety of works of travel and research,<br/>
the principal of which are named at p. 292, the Editor has<br/>
supplemented his own personal observations. Whenever it<br/>
has been his impression that a graphic piece of description<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>suggestive note by <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known </span>writer would add<br/>
interest to any scene, by being read at the locality to which it<br/>
refers, it has been extracted and given as a quotation in the<br/>
following pages.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor will be grateful for any information derived<br/>
from the personal observation of Tourists, which may serve<br/>
to correct errors or supply deficiencies in this Handbook.<br/>
Any communications on such subjects should be addressed,<br/>
