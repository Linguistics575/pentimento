<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">273 </span>THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spice </span>went up to view the Promised Land, and hither<br/>
they returned with grapes of Eshcol, and other proofs of<br/>
abundant plenty, but also with tales of terrible warriors and<br/>
giants. Israel murmured, and at this place received the sentence of forty years' wandering in the desert (Numb. xiii.<br/>
xiv.) Here, when determined to invade the land in their<br/>
own strength, the Israelites were defeated by the Ammonites,<br/>
and driven to Mount Seir (Deut. i. <span style="color: #0000FF;">44</span>). Thirty-eight years<br/>
passed away, and the host again returned to Kadesh <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barnes<br/>
</span>(Numb. xx.) Here Moses laid his sister Miriam in the<br/>
grave. Water was scarce, and a miraculous <span style="color: #0000FF;">supply </span>was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">obtained</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but in executing the miracle Moses and Aaron<br/>
offended God, and were told that they should not enter the<br/>
Promised Land. From Kadesh, Aaron went up to Mount Hor<br/>
to die. Then Israel being refused a passage through Edom,<br/>
the long weary journey was taken "to compass the mountains of Edom." In reading of these above events we<br/>
must remember that the district of Kadesh is sometimes<br/>
spoken of, and not the town. There are no rocks (see<br/>
Numb. xx. 11) at the site of the town, which was once an<br/>
important place, but now shows nothing but its clumps of<br/>
palm and rushes, and its wells of water.<br/>
<br/>
A weary ride of about nine hours brings the traveller to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nugh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufah</span>. This is a difficult mountain pass, occupying<br/>
two hours in its passage; the road is steep and slippery, and<br/>
it is often as much at the camels can do to cross it with their<br/>
burdens. From the summit the view of the'Arabah and the<br/>
mountains of Edom is magnificent.<br/>
<br/>
It was at this pass that Israel was defeated, when after<br/>
their rebellion and condemnation, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">presumed </span>to go up<br/>
unto the hill-top," to force their entrance into Canaan,<br/>
"and the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which<br/>
dwelt in that hill, and smote them." And no wonder<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
