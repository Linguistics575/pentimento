<br/>
There is a small and very dilapidated temple, built by<br/>
Ptolemy Physcon, close at hand. West of Edfou are marshes<br/>
where wild geese congregate.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Edfou, the tourist passes the ruins of the<br/>
fortified Arabian town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boodyb </span>(on the E.), also the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Silwek </span>on the same side. On the west bank the<br/>
ravine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shut-el-Ragel </span>is passed, in which some discoveries of value to Egyptologists have been made. On<br/>
the same side, farther on, are the hills Gebel Aboo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ghabah</span>,<br/>
in passing which gusty weather is often encountered.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hhgar-si1sileh</span>, or Gebel Silsileh, the Mountain<br/>
of the Chain, is 92 <span style="color: #0000FF;">miles </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Luxor. Arab tradition<br/>
affirms that at this point the navigation of the river was<br/>
stopped by a jealous king, who stretched a chain across the<br/>
narrow channel, which is little more than a thousand feet<br/>
broad at this point. On both sides of the river are quarries<br/>
from which the ancient kings procured the materials for<br/>
many of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>valley cities and monuments. The ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Silsilis </span>stood on the east bank. The quarries and grottoes<br/>
on the west bank are the most interesting; the principal<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>grotto contains a much admired tableau of a goddess suckling the infant Horus; the Triumph of Horus, the last<br/>
king of the eighteenth dynasty, is represented in another<br/>
striking bas-relief.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the quarries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hagar-Silsileh</span>, Dr. Olin says,<br/>
"The mountain, for an extent of several miles, is cut into<br/>
yawning chasms and high threatening precipices, that, in<br/>
their dimensions and variety of forms, mimic the sublime<br/>
workmanship of nature. As the stone immediately on this<br/>
bank of the river was porous, and less adapted to architectural<br/>
purposes, passages were cut through these useless masses<br/>
into the heart of the mountain. I did not measure these<br/>
avenues, but am sure that several of them are nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">half<br/>
<br/>
