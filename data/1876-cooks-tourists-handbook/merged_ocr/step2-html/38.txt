<span>24 INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
Children from three to ten years of age pay half fares for<br/>
the whole voyage; those under three years will go free<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>provided they do not exceed their <span style="color: #0000FF;">parents </span>in number, in which<br/>
case one-fourth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the passage rate will be charged for each<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
SECTION II.<br/>
FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND CATARACT.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span>Administration having placed a steamer<br/>
on the Upper Nile, to ply between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-Halfa</span>,<br/>
Messrs. COOK & SON inaugurated this new service in<br/>
1875. The experiment having proved a success, the Administration agreed to supply a larger and more comfortable<br/>
steamer than the one with which that service was previously<br/>
worked. The voyage to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-Halfa </span>and back may be<br/>
accomplished in twelve days, of which four-and-a-half are<br/>
employed in sight-seeing ashore, and, after the return journey,<br/>
passengers will have to make the Upper Nile steamer their<br/>
hotel for two or three extra days, waiting the arrival <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
Lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>steamer at Assouan to take them back to Cairo.<br/>
These few days will be found anything but unpleasant by those<br/>
who delight in a soft climate, and admire the beauties of nature.<br/>
Varied scenes may be enjoyed every day, either by going in a<br/>
boat around the island, or down the river through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">number</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>less rapids which precede the Cataracts, or by riding to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>neighbouring villages and the granite hills which border the<br/>
different camel paths towards Assouan. Were it only as a<br/>
resting-place, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>would still <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>found delightful. Although<br/>
navigation on the Upper Nile is quite as easy and secure, if not<br/>
easier than that on the Lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, it is desirable to allow three<br/>
days' margin in case of any unforeseen delay above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">First<br/>
</span>Cataract<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
