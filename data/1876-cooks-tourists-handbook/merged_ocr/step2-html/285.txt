left. Ragged garments presented by the Arabs as offerings<br/>
hang from the wooden rack above the grave. A three days'<br/>
festival is held here annually. The palm embowered <span style="color: #0000FF;">fours<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Win </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Suweirah </span>is a captal halting place for refreshment. Crossing some rough hills, the watershed between the two gulfs of'Akabah and Suez is reached.<br/>
<br/>
The Fer'a range is entered by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Sa'él. This is<br/>
mostly a narrow gorge between lofty mountains of greenstone, very beautiful in its golden <span style="color: #0000FF;">hues-it </span>is green inside<br/>
when broken. The valley abounds in acacia trees and<br/>
juniper bushes. Of the latter, charcoal is made by the<br/>
Arabs; allusion to which is made in the text referring to<br/>
"coals of juniper."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Debbet </span>er Ramleh, or the Sandy Plain, is an exception to the ordinary hard gravel or rock in the neighbourhood of Sinai. Here the El T ih mountains are full in<br/>
view, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Spanning </span>the Peninsula from Suez <span style="color: #0000FF;">to'Akabah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">looking<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">backward </span>the peaks of Sinai are seen rising in majestic grandeur from a wilderness of mountains.<br/>
<br/>
A steep pass conducts to the romantic glen of'Ain<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Huderah</span>, probably the Hazeroth of the Bible. This is a<br/>
deep ravine, nearly a mile long, and perhaps a third of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span>wide, completely shut in by mountains, except a narrow<br/>
path at each end. The spring is at the north-east end,<br/>
marked by a beautiful grove of palms and sycamores, and a<br/>
few small plots of grain. There is an abundance of sweet<br/>
water. From the upper pass the view is very fine. The<br/>
rocks all around are richly coloured; at the further<br/>
end nestles the little green oasis. On the summit of a<br/>
mountain in the distance is seen a mass of rock which is<br/>
considered to bear a striking resemblance to the Capitol at<br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Hitherto the traveller has pretty closely followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
