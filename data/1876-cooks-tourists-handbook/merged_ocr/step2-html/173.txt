side in the full light of the sun to the very limits of the<br/>
grand enclosure, whose crude brick walls were indeed the<br/>
true limits of the temple. In the temple (taken in its more<br/>
limited sense) were lodged the gods, there the sacred vestments were put on and all preparations made. It was a<br/>
sort of sacristy where the king and priests alone penetrated. In the enclosure, on the contrary, the long<br/>
processions developed, and even, if the public were not<br/>
admitted, there is reason to believe that certain initiates were<br/>
present."<br/>

The Temple of Denderah, though dating from <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span>later times, serves from its completeness to give a good<br/>
idea of the general arrangements of the older Pharaonic<br/>
temples. But in the decorations of the edifice an amount<br/>
of symbolism is evident, which was doubtless due to the<br/>
influence of the Platonists of Alexandria, who were seeking<br/>
to combine Greek philosophy with the old Egyptian mythology.<br/>
<br/>
The view from the roof. of the temple is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
cultivated land, the desert, the glistening <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and the chain<br/>
of hills that stretch away towards the shores of the Red<br/>
Sea. Numerous Coptic and Arabic habitations now cluster<br/>
round the temple and enclosure. To realize Denderah as<br/>
it was, the visitor must imagine all these swept away and<br/>
the sacred edifice standing in isolated majesty in the midst<br/>
of the vast area, compassed about with the high sombre<br/>
walls of brick that ensured the silence and solitude required<br/>
for the mystic ceremonies of the old Egyptian faith.<br/>

"On the ceiling of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">portico</span>," observes Mr.<br/>
Sharpe, "is the well-known zodiac which our antiquaries<br/>
once thought was of a great antiquity, but the sign of the<br/>
scales in the zodiac might alone have taught them that it<br/>
could not be older than the reign of Augustus, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">gave<br/>
