from any fear of Western prowess. But weary of the<br/>
continued attacks of the Christians against Damietta, the<br/>
Arabs destroyed the old city, and rebuilt the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mensheyah</span>, five miles further inland This latter town became<br/>
the modern Damietta, and preserves the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mensheeyah<br/>
</span>on one of its gates.<br/>
<br/>
Damietta is a good head-quarters for the sportsman who<br/>
wishes to' try his skill against the abundant water-fowl of the<br/>
neighbouring Lake Menzaleh (see below).<br/>
<br/>
The striped cloths known as dimity derive their name<br/>
from Damietta, from whence they were first introduced<br/>
into Europe.<br/>
<br/>
At the mouth of the Nile, near Damietta, there is<br/>
a lighthouse, from which a white light flashes at minute<br/>
intervals.<br/>

This excursion can be undertaken by hiring a boat at<br/>
Mansoorah (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span>8) and proceeding along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zrier </span>River or<br/>
Canal of Menzaleh. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ashmoon</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Berimbdl</span>, and other small places<br/>
are passed, and then the town of Menzaleh is reached.<br/>
Here another boat must be hired, as a barrier closes the<br/>
passage.<br/>
<br/>
An easier way of reaching Lake Menzaleh is by taking<br/>
the rail, via Zagazig (p. 217), either to Tel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phaltoos</span>, El Booka,<br/>
or Aboo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shekooh</span>, and then proceeding by boat. It can, of<br/>
course, also be visited from Port Said, or Kantarah (p. 227).<br/>
<br/>
Lake Menzaleh is the largest lake in Egypt, being<br/>
about <span style="color: #ff0000;">16 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>miles in circumference. It communicates towards<br/>
the north with the Mediterranean Sea, by three passages,<br/>
between which long banks of earth form the boundary.<br/>
On the west numerous small canals join it to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">principal<br/>
