<br/>
on, the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashoor </span>are seen and left<br/>
behind, and occasional views of the Nile and Arabian Hills<br/>
are enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kafr-el-Iyat</span>, and a few other places<br/>
of little importance, where, at each halt, children cluster<br/>
round, (in spite of savage demonstrations from the officials,)<br/>
and offer for sale, water, or bunches of beans, etc<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>in about<br/>
three hours El Wasta is <span style="color: #ff0000;">reached..<br/>
<br/>
</span>El Wasta (<span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>miles from Cairo) is the junction for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneb</span>, the chief town in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yoém</span>. Here <span style="color: #0000FF;">the.train<br/>
</span>from Upper Egypt must be waited for for some three <span style="color: #ff0000;">hours</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>on its arrival the branch train will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched</span>. There is<br/>
a fine view from near the station of the False Pyramid<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">11- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I35</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>The plain of the Nile'is now crossed nearly at right<br/>
angles to the previous course, towards the gap seen in the<br/>
Libyan Hills towards the West. F or. a time cultivated land<br/>
is crossed; villages are seen with their palm-groves. One<br/>
curious village, with innumerable pointed turrets for <span style="color: #ff0000;">pigeonhouses</span>, lies near the railway. After a time the cultivated<br/>
land, influenced by the Nile, is left behind, and a few miles<br/>
of desert crossed. "In scarcely more time," says a recent<br/>
traveller, "than is required to write these words, we found<br/>
ourselves in a bare yellow waste, and all the rich land of life<br/>
lying in a diminishing belt behind us. Some low ridges<br/>
soon hid it wholly from our view; a vast plain of gravel<br/>
dotted with stony <span style="color: #0000FF;">hummocks</span>, and pools of sand, where in<br/>
living regions one would look for water, stretched to the sky<br/>
on all sides. The air <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>on a sudden freshness and purity;<br/>
the life within me <span style="color: #0000FF;">heat </span>more joyously from its contrast with<br/>
the external lifelessness; it was the perfect atmosphere of<br/>
the desert at last! But to inhale it, thus, from the open<br/>
windows of a railway car, to see the yellow ridges appear<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
