<span>34 EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The vegetable productions of Egypt depend so completely<br/>
upon the annual inundation of the country by the waters of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, that it may be well here to give an account of that<br/>
phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
It is this inundation which annually renews the richness<br/>
of the Egyptian soil by depositing upon the land a coating of<br/>
mud, thus rendering the use of any other manure entirely<br/>
unnecessary. In many places no ploughing is <span style="color: #0000FF;">needed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>it is<br/>
only necessary to scatter the seed, and then turn <span style="color: #0000FF;">loose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>oxen or sheep or goats to trample in the grain. In other<br/>
parts agriculture is most carefully and laboriously attended<br/>
to, and artificial irrigation kept up in the intervals between<br/>
the inundations.<br/>
<br/>
The rise of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>can be seen at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gondokooroo</span>, lat. <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>,<br/>
in February, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartoom </span>in March, at Dongola in May, and<br/>
commences in Egypt about the end of June. It reaches its<br/>
greatest height towards the end of September, remaining for<br/>
about fifteen days at about <span style="color: #0000FF;">24 </span>ft. above the low water level,<br/>
after which a gradual subsidence takes place. If it rises to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">30 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>great damage ensues<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>if less than <span style="color: #ff0000;">18 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>famine results<br/>
in many parts. The following description of this remarkable phenomenon is from Osburn's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monumental </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">History<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span>"Perhaps there is not in nature <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>exhilarating sight<br/>
or one more strongly exciting to confidence in God, than the<br/>
rise of the Nile. Day by day and night by night its turbid<br/>
tide sweeps onward majestically over the parched sands of<br/>
the waste, howling wilderness. Almost hourly, as we<br/>
<br/>
tration of the minute accuracy of Scripture phraseology, to find that<br/>
they served the further purpose of guarding the land against the raids<br/>
of the Bedouin horsemen, who then, as now, infested the desert, and<br/>
whose depredations were checked by these canals.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
