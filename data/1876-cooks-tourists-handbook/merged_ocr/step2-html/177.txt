south, on the contrary, where the western chain continues<br/>
distant from the river, it remains open. The plain, therefore, on which Thebes was built, though limited in extent,<br/>
was yet sufficient to contain one of the largest cities of the<br/>
earth. According to Strabo, there is no doubt but that the<br/>
ancient city covered the whole plain. Thebes, therefore,<br/>
was built on the two banks of the Nile, without being <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected</span>, so far as we know, by means of a bridge."<br/>

The exact origin of Thebes, like that of Memphis, is<br/>
involved in obscurity. It was after the decline of This, or<br/>
Abydos, that Thebes rose to be the capital of Upper Egypt.<br/>
Two or three kings had reigned here before Abraham<br/>
entered the Delta. The first great kingly name in Theban<br/>
history is that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirtasen </span>I. "He was," says Bartlett,<br/>
"the builder of the older and smaller part of the Temple of<br/>
Karnak, which served as the nucleus around which his successors grouped other and more colossal additions. This<br/>
early Theban monarchy was, in fact, a religious community,<br/>
in which the palace was a temple, the people worshippers at<br/>
the gate, and the monarch the chief priest. The dynasty of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirtasen </span>was terminated by the conquest of Upper Egypt<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphian </span>kings who built the Pyramids."<br/>
<br/>
Thebes, like the other cities of Egypt, was for a time<br/>
subject to the Shepherd Kings, till Amosis of Thebes<br/>
expelled that alien race, and Upper Egypt began to rise to<br/>
its highest degree of power and glory. The temple at<br/>
Karnak received important: additions from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph</span>,<br/>
Thothmes, and the beautiful Queen Nitocris. Under<br/>
