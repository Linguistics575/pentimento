<br/>
The so-called Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo </span>consists<br/>
of the ruins of two temples, one of Thothmes III. and<br/>
another of Rameses III. In these ruins, under the Empire,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Coptic cathedral was found, and around it clustered a<br/>
Coptic village, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>. Hence the name<br/>
generally given to the ruins.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Thothmes III. is the smaller of<br/>
the two. The court (80 ft. by 125 ft.), by the flowered<br/>
capitals of its columns and the style of its sculptures and<br/>
hieroglyphics, belongs to the Roman epoch. It also bears<br/>
the names of Titus, Adrian, Antoninus, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this court, which is a Ptolemaic addition, is<br/>
another smaller court, with cartouches of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tirhakeh </span>(twentyfifth dynasty), and Nectanebo (thirtieth dynasty). The<br/>
Temple itself is more ancient still, being erected and<br/>
adorned by Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>and Thothmes III.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rame'ses </span>III. was erected by him<br/>
in the immediate vicinity of the smaller edifice just described.<br/>
This grand building is of great historical importance, and<br/>
by its style and general effect and variety of decoration,<br/>
makes a profound and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lasting </span>impression on all visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The edifice consists of a Palace and a Temple,<br/>
separated by a court, forming together a structure second<br/>
only to Karnak in grandeur of architecture and gorgeousness<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration-a </span>labyrinth of immense courts, innumerable<br/>
pillars, and superb colonnades. Many parts are still perfect,<br/>
but all around, columns bright and vivid with every colour of<br/>
the rainbow lie scattered in countless profusion.<br/>
<br/>
The Palace, though probably intended as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">grand<br/>
<br/>
</span>'monument of military architecture rather than as an actual<br/>
habitation, has all the characteristics of a royal residence<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
