PRACTICAL INFORMATION FOR TRAVELLERS.<br/>
<br/>
SEASON FOR EASTERN TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
ANY time from November to March may be selected. After<br/>
the early part of March the heat becomes almost unbearable,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dies </span>and water supplies of the Desert are generally<br/>
dried up. Travellers who are intending to visit Palestine as<br/>
well as Egypt, cannot do better than select December, January,<br/>
or February for their Nile journey, and March or April, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>most genial months of the year, for Palestine. If this is <span style="color: #0000FF;">inconvenient </span>the months of October and November are considered<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>by many travellers to be very favourable for Palestine travelling,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in which case the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>trip might be made on the return journey<br/>
<br/>
in December.<br/>
<br/>
BENEFITS OF ASSOCIATED TRAVEL.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the question of expense, travelling in the East,<br/>
either alone, or with only one or two companions, is not desirable. In Egypt, up the Nile, and through the Desert, the mode<br/>
<br/>
of life, language, and customs of the country are altogether <span style="color: #ff0000;">difI<br/>
