ploughing, etc., after a fashion already described (p. 79).<br/>
At length the visitor passes beyond the line of vegetation,<br/>
and reaches the great ocean of desert sand, on the shore of<br/>
which stand in desolation the colossal Pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
Upon a rocky plateau of limestone, about forty feet above<br/>
the surrounding plain, are situated the three Great Pyramids,<br/>
several smaller ones, many ancient tombs, and the colossal<br/>
Sphinx.<br/>
<br/>
From the vast immensity of the desert landscape, and<br/>
the absence of objects for comparison, the Pyramids seem<br/>
scarcely larger on approaching them than when seen two or<br/>
three miles off; but when actually reached, a sense of their<br/>
immensity comes over the mind with almost appalling effect.<br/>
The best way to get an idea of their immense magnitude, as<br/>
Zincke points out, is to stand in the centre of one side, and<br/>
look up to the summit. "The eye thus travels over all the<br/>
courses of stone from the very bottom to the apex, which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">literally </span>to pierce the blue vault above. This way of<br/>
looking at the Great Pyramid, perhaps, is a way which<br/>
exaggerates to the eye its magnitude <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfairly-makes </span>it look<br/>
Alpine in height, while it produces the strange effect just<br/>
noticed."<br/>
<br/>
Sir Gardner Wilkinson gives the dimensions of the<br/>
Great Pyramid, or Pyramid of Cheops, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>Base-line, formerly 756 feet, present 7 32 feet.<br/>
<br/>
Perpendicular height, formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">480 </span>feet, present 460 feet.<br/>
<br/>
Area, formerly 571,536 square feet, present 535,824.<br/>
<br/>
Probably most will be familiar with the oft-repeated<br/>
statements that the area of the Great Pyramid is equal to that<br/>
of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and that it is about sixty feet higher<br/>
than the cross of St. Paul's Cathedral.<br/>
<br/>
The usual process in Egyptian Pyramid building seems<br/>
to have been to leave a nucleus of solid rock, and enclose <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>
