<span>THE MOUNT OF THE LAW. 257<br/>
<br/>
("Hill of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Conference'O</span>, with its numerous inscriptions,<br/>
the various caves of the hermits, and remains of tombs and<br/>
ancient monastic buildings, affords further objects of interest<br/>
to inspect, if time allows.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feirau</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>three or four miles vegetation again<br/>
ceases. Passing some banks gradually deposited by floods,<br/>
the Gate of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Feirén </span>is passed through into the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Solaf</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soléf</span>, a number of the ancient stone<br/>
houses, shaped like beehives, and attributed by the Arabs to<br/>
the Israelites, are passed. From this <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish<br/>
</span>host are supposed to have passed to the Valley of Rest by<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-eSh-Sheykh</span>, but there is a shorter and more<br/>
magnificent pass further on, called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nugh </span>Hawa, or<br/>
Pass of the Wind, through which visitors can proceed on<br/>
horseback while the camels go round by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-eshSheykh</span>. This is one of the grandest passes on earth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>forms a fitting gateway to the awful heights of Sinai. It is<br/>
a narrow and at times precipitous passage through lofty<br/>
granite mountains rising to the height of <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>feet; while<br/>
large masses of rock on either side seem ready to fall on the<br/>
adventurous traveller.<br/>
<br/>
Emerging from the Pass into the Valley of Rahah,<br/>
or Valley of Rest, the sacred mountains of Sinai are seen in<br/>
full view. To the left stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">g </span>ebel-ed-Deyr, the Mount<br/>
of the Convent, at the foot of which runs the Valley of<br/>
Jethro, where stands the Greek Convent. On the right of<br/>
this rises <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rats </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufséfeh</span>, the Mount of the Law, <span style="color: #0000FF;">command</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>the whole plain and the valleys leading into it, and forming<br/>
the fitting height from which God spoke in audible voice to<br/>
man. Jebel Moosa, the traditional Sinai, lies directly behind<br/>
this, in the same range, but not visible from the plain<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>while on the extreme right, beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wad</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lejé</span>, stands<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I7<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
