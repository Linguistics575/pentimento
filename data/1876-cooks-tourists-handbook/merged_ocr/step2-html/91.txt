<br/>
described. The past living in the present, unaltered though<br/>
millenniums have rolled away, and great tides of civilizing<br/>
change have passed over all other phases of life. And to see<br/>
this from a railway train adds a new force to its <span style="color: #0000FF;">impressiveness</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>Kafr Douar is the first station, at which few strangers<br/>
alight unless bent on shooting in the vicinity. The halts at<br/>
the various stations on the line are very amusing. Motley<br/>
groups <span style="color: #0000FF;">assail </span>the train intent on selling sugar-canes, oranges,<br/>
mandarins, "Turkish delight," or other light refreshments to<br/>
the travellers. Some of the crowd are arrayed in costumes<br/>
extravagant in their profuseness, many in costumes so limited<br/>
that it is a compliment to call them costumes at all.<br/>
<br/>
At Aboo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hommoos </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal is left,<br/>
and the railway proceeds to Damanhoor. This is a large<br/>
town, with some cotton factories. There are a few good<br/>
houses, but most of the habitations are only of earth or dried<br/>
bricks. Indeed, the poorest part of the town may be described as a huge mud-heap, with a number of holes in it,<br/>
which are the doors leading into the separate burrows forming<br/>
the homes of the people. Some graceful tufts of palms in<br/>
the vicinity, and a few white minarets glistening in the sun,<br/>
serve to relieve the monotony, and give a picturesque aspect<br/>
to the scene.<br/>
<br/>
It was near Damanhoor that Napoleon so narrowly<br/>
escaped being taken prisoner by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks </span>in 1798, and<br/>
made the celebrated remark about not being fated to become<br/>
a prisoner of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>, but "<span style="color: #ff0000;">prissonier </span>des Anglais,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>la bonne heure! "<br/>
<br/>
After passing <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tel-el-Bark</span>, the Rosetta branch of<br/>
the Nile is crossed by an iron bridge, which opens to allow<br/>
large vessels to pass. It was here that the brother of the<br/>
present <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive </span>was drowned, a year after the railway <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
