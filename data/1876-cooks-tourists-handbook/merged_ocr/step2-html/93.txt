<br/>
best possible terms, notwithstanding the difference in their<br/>
size and habits. Beautiful little sac sacs (lapwings) fly about<br/>
like butterflies, while enormous cranes pull the feathers out of<br/>
their own necks with slow patience. The dromedaries and<br/>
buffaloes, which constantly meet each other on the road parallel<br/>
to the railway, look on tranquilly as the trains pass, with the<br/>
impassible serenity of Normandy cows, not to be disturbed<br/>
by steam whistles or engines."<br/>
<br/>
The tourist will be interested in watching the various industries of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>, as seen from the railway. Watering<br/>
the land seems to be one of the chief, and this is done by the<br/>
most old-fashioned appliances. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">shadoof </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>are both seen in frequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">operation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and as these are notable<br/>
Egyptian institutions, which will everywhere meet the traveller's eye as long as he journeys in the land, it would be<br/>
better once for all to describe them.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">shadoof </span>is the arrangement most in vogue. It consists of a long pole, made heavy at one end, and resting on a<br/>
pivot, at the other end a bucket, or large water-tight basket,<br/>
which is lowered to the water and filled, and, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">theth<br/>
</span>end of the pole goes down, turns out its contents into a little<br/>
gutter, whence it is worked by the foot into the appointed<br/>
channels. Sometimes this is superseded by the sakieh, which<br/>
is a water-mill of cogged wheels, turned by a buffalo, or perchance a camel, each revolution of the wheel working up a<br/>
series of earthen pitchers, which empty themselves into a<br/>
trough or pool. More primitive still is the practice, in frequent use, of raising the water without any mechanical contrivance.. Two men stand in the stream or canal with a<br/>
waterproof basket between them, which they swing as regularly as clockwork, and throw the water on to the bank, where<br/>
another stands ready to divert it into its proper place. It was<br/>
in contrast to this style of <span style="color: #0000FF;">work </span>that it was said in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scripture<br/>
