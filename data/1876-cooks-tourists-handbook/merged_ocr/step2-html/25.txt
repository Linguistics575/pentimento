<br/>
(2) ROUTES OF PERSONALLY-CONDUCTED TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
For long tours the usual course is to cross the English<br/>
Channel by either the Calais route, (the shortest sea passage,)<br/>
or by Dieppe, (the shortest distance to Paris). From Paris<br/>
direct to Turin by the Mont Cenis Tunnel, and from Turin by<br/>
Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi; thence by steamer to Corfu,<br/>
and then to Alexandria; after visiting Lower Egypt or going up<br/>
the Nile, cross the Land of Goshen to Ismailia, and there take<br/>
steamer on Suez Canal for Port Said; from Port Said sail to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa </span>and land there; make the tour <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>country, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">reembark </span>on steamer at Beyrout for Constantinople; thence to<br/>
Athens, and complete the tour of the Mediterranean and Adriatic<br/>
by landing at Trieste; returning through Italy by Venice, Milan<br/>
and Turin, and back to Paris and London.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst this is the general course of the conductors, many<br/>
modifications, extensions or <span style="color: #0000FF;">abridgments </span>may be made to suit<br/>
the convenience and meet the wishes of the travellers, who may<br/>
go through Italy and meet the conductor at Brindisi, or may go<br/>
round by Nice, Mentone, etc., and meet the party at any prac-.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ticable </span>point. The route from Palestine may be varied by going<br/>
direct from Smyrna to Athens, then to Constantinople and up<br/>
the Danube to Vienna, or from Trieste; any who choose can go<br/>
direct to Vienna.<br/>
<br/>
From other parts of Northern Italy the Alps can be crossed,<br/>
so as to return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or<br/>
other deviations from the beaten track can be provided for if<br/>
desired.<br/>
<br/>
The route for short tours to Lower Egypt and two or three<br/>
weeks in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as described above, then to Genoa and take steamer there for<br/>
Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, Naples and Messina. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Proceed<br/>
