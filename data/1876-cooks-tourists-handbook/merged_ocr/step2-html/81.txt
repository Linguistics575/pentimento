enable it to fulfil its destinies of becoming the emporium of<br/>
three quarters of the globe."<br/>
<br/>
The successors of Mahomed Ali have continued to improve the city and foster <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>commerce. The development<br/>
of steam communication with India by the overland route did<br/>
much to restore the ancient importance of Alexandria as a<br/>
gateway to the East.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria is mentioned once or twice in the New Testament. Alexandrian Jews were conspicuous amongst those<br/>
who compassed the death of Stephen. It was a ship sailing<br/>
from Alexandria to Italy in which St. Paul suffered shipwreck (Acts xxvii. 6), and it was in another Alexandrian<br/>
vessel, the Castor and Pollux, that the journey was completed from Melita to Puteoli (Acts. xxviii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>).<br/>
<br/>
MODERN ALEXANDRIA<br/>
<br/>
contains a population of about 220,000, of whom <span style="color: #ff0000;">threefourths </span>are native Egyptians of every kind, and the remainder<br/>
a strange medley of Moors, Arabs, adventurers from all the<br/>
Levantine shores, and a few thousand merchants, etc., from<br/>
the nations of Western Europe. Each nation has its consul, having a jurisdiction over all persons of his own nationality--an arrangement from which trouble and disorder <span style="color: #ff0000;">fre-L<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">quently </span>arises.<br/>
<br/>
Modern Alexandria is chiefly built on the isthmus now<br/>
connecting the mainland with what was once the Island of<br/>
Pharos, and also on the island itself, where the principal public<br/>
buildings are situated. The Frankish quarter is the handsomest portion of the city, and more nearly occupies the<br/>
site of the ancient town. The Great Square (more correctly<br/>
the Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méhémet </span>Ali) is the head-quarters of European<br/>
life and business. Here the chief banks, hotels, and merchants' offices are situated southward of the square; <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
