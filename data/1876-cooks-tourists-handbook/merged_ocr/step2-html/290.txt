<br/>
terraces, now mostly broken, and ruins of ancient aqueducts<br/>
and edifices are seen.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sik</span>, or Cleft, which forms the entrance to Petra, is<br/>
reached somewhat suddenly. It is a narrow ravine, with<br/>
rocks of red sandstone, from one hundred to three hundred<br/>
feet in height, rising perpendicularly on each <span style="color: #0000FF;">side</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow<br/>
</span>line of sky is mostly seen between, but at places the passage is<br/>
completely overarched. The Arab tradition asserts that this<br/>
was the cleft caused by the stroke of Moses' rod when the<br/>
Israelites were miraculously supplied at Kadesh.<br/>
<br/>
Dean Stanley identifies Petra with Kadesh Barnea.<br/>
<br/>
Near the entrance to the Sik are two temples with large<br/>
chambers, excavated in the solid rock, and ornamented with<br/>
columns and pyramidal towers. Chambers variously adorned<br/>
fill the rocks on either side the valley. Several immense<br/>
monoliths in the form of sarcophagi, evidently intended for<br/>
tombs, are carved out of the rock, and adorned with cornices<br/>
and bas-reliefs..<br/>
<br/>
Entering the Sik, the traveller soon passes under a beautiful Roman arch, 75 feet in height, which formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">sup </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ported </span>an aqueduct. Yew trees and creeping vines in<br/>
festoons clothe the recesses of the rocks. Along the cleft<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">flows </span>a stream, and here and there fragments of the old<br/>
Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>are perceptible. Niches, once filled with<br/>
statues, are seen on either side; and whenever a widening<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>gives space, ruins of temples can be observed.<br/>
For a mile and a half the traveller journeys through this<br/>
wonderful ravine, and then emerges on the wider valley,<br/>
called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Moosa.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Moosa, just opposite the Sik, stands the<br/>
edifice called by the Arabs El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khuzneh </span>Faraon, or<br/>
Treasury of Pharaoh. It is a temple or sepulchre, cut in<br/>
the rock, with a facade of two stories. The lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">story<br/>
