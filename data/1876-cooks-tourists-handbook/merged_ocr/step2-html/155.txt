<span>COPTIC CONVENT. 139<br/>
<br/>
The lofty precipices of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel-el-Tayr </span>soon present<br/>
themselves on the eastern shore. This mountain,<br/>
towering some hundred feet in height, consists of a long<br/>
range of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs </span>singularly broken and full of rifts and<br/>
chasms, rising perpendicularly from the east side of the<br/>
river for four miles. It is said to derive its name, which<br/>
means Mountain of the Birds, from the circumstance of the<br/>
birds meeting there annually and imprisoning one of their<br/>
number till their next visit. Why they do this is not<br/>
explained.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain is better known from its Coptic Convent of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sitteh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariam-el-Adra </span>(our Lady Mary the Virgin)<br/>
often called the Convent of the Pulley. It is, in reality, like<br/>
many of the Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dayrs</span>, a village of priests and wives,<br/>
and families and connections, surrounding a church, and all<br/>
walled in for protection from the Bedouins. There is a<br/>
well-hole in the rocks, up which the Convent on the summit<br/>
can be reached from the water's edge. Down this perpendicular tunnel the monks used to come swarming as the<br/>
steamer was seen approaching, swim to the vessel's side,<br/>
climb on deck, and solicit alms on the grounds of a common<br/>
Christianity, but the custom is now prohibited by order of<br/>
the patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Curzon, in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">.Monasteries </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Levant, gives an<br/>
amusing account of his ascent up the tunnel, or funnel, to the<br/>
Convent. Following the abbot "whom I saw striding and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sprawling </span>in the attitude of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">spread </span>eagle above my head,<br/>
my slippers soon fell off upon the head of a man under me,<br/>
whom, on looking down, I saw to be the reis, or captain of<br/>
my boat, whose immense turban formed the whole of his<br/>
costume. At least twenty men were scrambling and puffing<br/>
underneath <span style="color: #0000FF;">him-arms </span>and legs stretched out in all manner<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">attitudes-the </span>procession being led by the unrobed <span style="color: #ff0000;">eccle<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
