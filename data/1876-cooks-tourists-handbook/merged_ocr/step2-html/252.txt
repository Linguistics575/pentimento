and El Gara to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séewah </span>in eleven days. It can also be<br/>

Alexander the Great, in fifteen days; or from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém</span>, by<br/>
the Little Oasis, in ten days.<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis of Ammon <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>about nine miles long by. two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">broad</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>its population <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>about 8000. Dates are abundant, also<br/>
the usual cereals. There are some sulphurous springs, a salt<br/>
lake, many ruins of temples, a necropolis, and other remains.<br/>
At Om Baydah are the remains of the Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AmunNeph</span>, where the priests proclaimed Alexander the son of<br/>
their god. This temple is said to have been built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhther-Hebi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectabes </span>I. The Fountain of the Sun is<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séewah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shargieh</span>. It is a pool of considerable size<br/>
and depth, in which the water is constantly steaming and<br/>
bubbling, and is warmer by night than by day.<br/>

journey. It has a few monuments, but none anterior to<br/>
Roman times; the principal objects of interest are a triumphal arch, some subterraneous and other aqueducts, several<br/>
hot <span style="color: #ff0000;">Springs</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>necropolis, and a Christian church. There are<br/>
some smaller oases in the vicinity.<br/>

points, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aby </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dos</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshoot</span>, etc. The most convenient route is by way of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">146</span>).<br/>
