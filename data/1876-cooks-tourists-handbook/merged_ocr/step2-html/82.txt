<br/>
Rue Ch√©rif Pasha leads to the handsome Boulevard Ismail<br/>
and the Rosetta Gate<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>northward from the Great Square the<br/>
Rue <span style="color: #0000FF;">Raret.Teen </span>winds past the Governor's palace to the<br/>
Arsenal (p. 73), and the Palace of Ras-et-Teen (p. 73).<br/>
There are two harbours. The Eastern Harbour, or New<br/>
Port, is much exposed, and was, in days of Mahomedan exclusiveness, the only harbour permitted to foreign vessels.<br/>
The Western, or Eunostus Harbour, now called the Old<br/>
Port, is a well protected and commodious harbour, with<br/>
breakwater, mole, jetty, lighthouses, and spacious quays<br/>
(see p. 67), and crowded with the merchant ships of every<br/>
nation.<br/>
<br/>
The general aspect of the city is a strange mingling of<br/>
European and Oriental. The shops are much the same as<br/>
in any European city, the names of the streets being affixed<br/>
in French. The side streets, especially of the Arab Quarter,<br/>
wear more of an Eastern aspect, but the influence of the<br/>
stranger is everywhere visible. A day will probably suffice<br/>
for the tourist to see all that he wants to see in Alexandria.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage </span>for the day, at a cost of sixteen shillings, will<br/>
take him round to everything of importance. The views of<br/>
street life seen in the transit are intensely amusing.<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting as the sights of Alexandria are, there<br/>
is so strong an admixture of European manners, customs,<br/>
and habits with the Eastern, and this is so strikingly<br/>
apparent everywhere and in everything, that the traveller<br/>
does not need to be told he can here form no true idea<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>Eastern city. For that he must wait till he gets to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cane</span>. But he will find in the bazaars of Alexandria <span style="color: #0000FF;">what<br/>
