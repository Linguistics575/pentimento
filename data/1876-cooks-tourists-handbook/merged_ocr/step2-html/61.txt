<span>DYNASTIES. 47<br/>
<br/>
All asserted facts in the early history of Egypt must be<br/>
taken as, to a great extent, conjectural and uncertain. From<br/>
the brief records of Scripture, and the works of Herodotus,<br/>
Diodorus, Eratosthenes, and especially the historical fragments of Manetho, joined to a laborious investigation of<br/>
the monuments and papyrus records, a history of Egypt<br/>
has been developed, although on many points, especially as<br/>
regards chronology, Egyptologists hold very diverse views.<br/>
<br/>
In describing the monuments of Egypt in subsequent<br/>
pages of this work, it will sometimes be necessary to refer<br/>
to some or other of the various dynasties of Egyptian<br/>
kings. It will therefore be desirable now, as briefly as possible, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">epitomise </span>these. It should be observed that the<br/>
epithet Pharaoh, applied in Scripture to any King of Egypt,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a generic name, similar to Caesar or Augustus, probably<br/>
from the Egyptian word Phra, the Sun.<br/>
<br/>
DYNASTI ES.<br/>
<br/>
I. Founded by Menes, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">5004 </span>3.0. His capital was<br/>
This (Abydos), in Upper Egypt. There are no monuments of<br/>
this dynasty. Tetu, the second king, wrote on surgery, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hespu</span>, the fifth king, wrote sacred books.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">4.7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">51 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.) Includes nine kings, who have left some<br/>
rude remains of their work. No. 2, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kekeu</span>, built the oldest<br/>
Pyramid in Egypt, that at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>(p. 12 5), and introduced<br/>
the symbolic worship of Apis. N o. 8, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sesocris</span>, is described<br/>
as a giant.<br/>
<br/>
III. (4449 <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.) Memphis was now the capital. Tombs,<br/>
dating from Snefru, the last king but one in this dynasty,<br/>
are adorned with pictures, and prove a high degree of<br/>
civilization.<br/>
<br/>
IV. (42 3 5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.) Memphis capital. Numerous <span style="color: #ff0000;">monuments<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
