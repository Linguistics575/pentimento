and having a threefold purpose, irrigation, communication,<br/>
and defence. To Sesostris is attributed, by Strabo and others,<br/>
the formation of the first canal connecting the Pelusian<br/>
branch of the Nile with the Red Sea. At least, it seems<br/>
probable that a portion of the Canal, which was fortified as a<br/>
barrier against the Hyksos, was the work of that conqueror.<br/>
Herodotus says that Pharaoh N echo, son of Psammetichus,<br/>
was the first to carry out the project we are describing, at a<br/>
sacrifice of 120,000 lives, by forced labour. The work was<br/>
never completed, after all. The oracle declared that the work<br/>
would be of more service to the outer world than to Egypt.<br/>
Darius, the Persian conqueror, tried to carry out Necho's<br/>
plans, but was dissuaded by being assured that the Red Sea<br/>
was higher than the Mediterranean, and that if the connection was opened, Lower Egypt would be inundated with salt<br/>
water. For some time, accordingly, goods were brought<br/>
from the Nile along the Canal to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heriiopolis</span>, and then unloaded, and the cargo placed in Red Sea vessels. The more<br/>
enlightened Ptolemies remedied this state of things by cutting<br/>
a connection, and by means of locks and sluices prevented<br/>
the mingling of the salt and fresh water. Adrian and Trajan<br/>
are both credited with having improved the canalization of<br/>
the district; but under Mahomedan <span style="color: #0000FF;">rule </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>course <span style="color: #ff0000;">became </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>

<br/>
In more modern times Napoleon and Mahomed Ali both<br/>
nursed the idea of cutting a canal from the Red Sea to the<br/>
Mediterranean, but it was reserved for Vicomte Ferdinand de<br/>
Lesseps to bring the project into successful action. He first<br/>
considered the subject whilst in quarantine at Alexandria in<br/>
1831. Subsequently, he was much impressed by the<br/>
devotion of Lieutenant Waghorn, who lost health and fortune<br/>
in trying to induce the English Government to adopt the<br/>
overland route to India. Lesseps devoted his life to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
