seen. It does not seem real; it is hard to divest one's mind<br/>
of the thought that it is a great carnival, a mammoth masquerade, got up for the occasion. It is a vast crowd, a<br/>
stupendous noise, a new sensation.<br/>
<br/>
"A Babel of many tongues, a blaze of curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">costumes-these </span>are the first things of which you are conscious; then<br/>
you stand for a time to see the ceaseless crowd pass you, and<br/>
you single out the various nationalities. Those men with<br/>
the ringlets are Syrian Jews<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>those bedizened horsemen are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>those high-capped and black-habited men are Copts;<br/>
those youths enjoying themselves within an inch of their<br/>
lives are English midshipmen<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>that curious being in a<br/>
white dress like a ballet-dancer's, and legs tied up with<br/>
strings, is an Albanian<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>those blackies are Nubians.<br/>
There are French dandies, Italian beauties, Hindoo monstrosities, Bedouin brigands, women in trousers, men in<br/>
petticoats, Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers<br/>
in Mesopotamia and in India, in Cappadocia, in Pontus, and<br/>
Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia--every nation under the sun<br/>
seems to have sent forth its representative to Alexandria.<br/>
Now comes a string of camels, and the surging <span style="color: #0000FF;">crowds </span>jostle<br/>
among the vendors of fruit and cooked mysteries; then<br/>
there is a shout, and adventurous donkey-boys are urging on<br/>
their beasts, burdened with bundles of veiled beauty. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Now<br/>
</span>music is heard, and a crowd collects round a wandering<br/>
minstrel, soon to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">dispersed</span>, as a' <span style="color: #0000FF;">runner </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>cries out for<br/>
room for the carriage of a grandee. And, amid all the uproar, those grim old Turks sit cross-legged on the carpets<br/>
of their divans, or the dais of their stalls, and smoke their<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">narghilies</span>, and sip their coffee, as though they were in profound solitude."<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>Edwin Hodder<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
