</span>in improving and adorning their capital. When Cleopatra,<br/>
"serpent of old N ile," yielded name and fame, and life and<br/>
empire to the Roman invader, Egypt was soon subdued, and<br/>
Alexandria became, under the Caesars, the second city of the<br/>
Roman Empire, and the granary of Rome, celebrated at once<br/>
for its wealth and commerce, art and learning, luxury and<br/>
refinement.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient Alexandria, the city in which St. Mark preached<br/>
the gospel, bequeathed nothing but its ruins and its name to<br/>
the modern city. It is said to have been fifteen miles in circumference, containing in its most populous days no less<br/>
than <span style="color: #0000FF;">600,000 </span>inhabitants. Of its streets and theatres, and<br/>
walls, and gates, and temples scarcely a vestige remains.<br/>
The Pharos (on the site of which the old lighthouse<br/>
now stands) was one of the seven <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonders</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the world<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>a lofty building of white marble, with an exterior winding gallery, up which horses and chariots could ascend<br/>
to the summit. Ptolemy Philadelphus, who built the tower,<br/>
also constructed the Heptastadium, or famous causeway<br/>
connecting the city with the then island of Pharos. The<br/>
Museum was founded by Ptolemy Soter. With its schools<br/>
are inseparably linked the names of Euclid and Hipparchus,<br/>
Origen and Athanasius, and many another scientific student<br/>
or polemic <span style="color: #0000FF;">disputant-not </span>forgetting Hypatia, who has won<br/>
a second immortality in the pages of Kingsley's marvellous<br/>
story. Here also was the famous Library, collected at<br/>
enormous cost, and utterly destroyed by the Romans in<br/>
taking the city. In this Library was placed the celebrated<br/>
Septuagint translation of the Scriptures made by order of<br/>
Ptolemy Philadelphus. The Serapeum, or Serapeion,<br/>
scene of sanguinary struggles between Pagans and Christians when the old system was dying hard, had also a splendid<br/>
library, much pillaged in Roman times, and finally destroyed<br/>
