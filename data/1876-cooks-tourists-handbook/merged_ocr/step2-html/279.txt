<span>MOUNT SINAI<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>I<br/>
<br/>
It forms a portion of a considerable district of varied and<br/>
lofty elevation. Mountains and intervening <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédies</span>, or<br/>
valleys, are, as before stated, the prevailing characteristics of<br/>
the Sinaitic peninsula. Hence the force of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">texts-</span>" For<br/>
mischief did he bring them, to slay them in the mountains "<br/>
(Exod. xxxii. 12) 5 and "a great and strong wind rent the<br/>
mountains" (I Kings xix. <span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>).<br/>
<br/>
"Right in the heart of this large group of mountains,<br/>
and near its watershed, tradition has placed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">summit </span>for<br/>
ever consecrated as the scene of the giving of the law. And<br/>
it has chosen wisely. Just in front of Er <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rahéh</span>, the largest<br/>
plain in the region, stands a huge granite block, about two<br/>
miles long and a half-mile broad. The northern end of this<br/>
block rises directly from the plain, and is broken into three<br/>
or four peaks, one of which is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ras </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufsafeh</span>, from<br/>
which there is a clear and distinct view of the plain, and of<br/>
the attendant <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédies</span>. Here, doubtless, is "the nether part<br/>
of the mount "( Exod. xix. I 7), where the elders accompanied<br/>
Moses, and here the law was proclaimed to the people<br/>
assembled below. That there was room enough for them<br/>
has been proved by calculations made from actual measurements. The southern portion of the block, Jebel Moosa,<br/>
which rises 500 ft. higher than <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufsafeh</span>, is doubtless that<br/>
portion of the mount in which Moses was alone with God.<br/>
Between these two peaks, the vast mass is hollowed in the<br/>
shape of a cup, filled with huge boulders of purple, and green,<br/>
and yellow granite, and supplied with several <span style="color: #ff0000;">Springs </span>which<br/>
give sustenance, here and there, to a willow or cypress, or an<br/>
acacia. The walk through this basin is trying to most<br/>
persons, but a grander scene is rarely to be found. In these<br/>
bleak and lofty solitudes, Moses communed with his Maker.<br/>
Around their summits thunders roared and lightnings <span style="color: #0000FF;">flashed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>from their recesses rang out the notes of a trumpet blown <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
<br/>
