Coptos was the great emporium of Egypt's trade with the<br/>
East. From Berenice, on the Red Sea, the merchants came<br/>
by a well-beaten track to Coptos, from whence the riches<br/>
of the far East were floated down the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>to Alexandria.<br/>
Near the town is a narrow pass leading to the chain of<br/>
ravines through which this ancient pathway of commerce<br/>
was kept up. The vegetation in this district is very<br/>
luxuriant. Fine crops of sugar-cane and Indian corn cover<br/>
the fertile plain by the river side.<br/>

Ancient Thebes occupied the whole plain now seen on<br/>
each side of the Nile, but it was on the east bank that the<br/>
chief portion of the city was situated, the western side being<br/>
principally occupied by temples and palaces, and the tombs<br/>
of the dead. The city was never enclosed by walls, and<br/>
