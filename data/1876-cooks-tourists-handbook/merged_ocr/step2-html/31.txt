<span>ITINERARY TQ FIRST CATARACT. 17<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SEGON </span>D DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The excursion to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>and the Serapeum is made, starting early in the morning. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>may occur on returning,<br/>
and after having visited the site where Memphis stood, to witness an important fair, held every Wednesday, at a village on<br/>
our way. Back at about noon to the steamer, which starts immediately. In the afternoon pass on the right the curtailed<br/>
Pyramid, called "El <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kedab</span>," or False Pyramid. Towards<br/>
evening reach Wasta, a village of no importance, where the<br/>
steamer generally stops for the night, unless the night be clear<br/>
and moon-lit, in which case the steamer continues its course for<br/>
some time.<br/>
<br/>
THIRD DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Start early in the morning, in order to pass, before nightfall,<br/>
the mountain "Gebel-el-Tayr," on the top of which stands a<br/>
Coptic convent, whose inmates used to plunge into the river as<br/>
soon as a boat was in sight, and swimming towards it, with the<br/>
greatest dexterity catch hold of the small boat in tow, and climb<br/>
on deck to ask for backsheesh.' In the afternoon pass in succession the splendid sugar factories of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BibSFeshne</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghagha</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ben-in-Mar</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Samaloot</span>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Towards evening Minieh is reached<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it contains a fine<br/>
palace belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few<br/>
weeks here in the winter; and a most extensive sugar <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactory</span>, employing about 2,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>. A visit to this establishment will well repay the trouble, and every attention is <span style="color: #ff0000;">shown'<br/>
</span>to visitors. The works generally commence in the beginning of<br/>
January, and, when in activity, the evening is the usual time to<br/>
admit visitors.<br/>
<br/>
FOURTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
In two hours the boat reaches <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beni-Hassan</span>, another <span style="color: #ff0000;">haltingplace </span>for sight-seeing. Swarms of beggars, and miserable<br/>
donkeys without saddles or <span style="color: #0000FF;">bridles-the </span>worst all along the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-await </span>the arrival of the steamer. The Rock Tombs of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The practice is now prohibited by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Patriarch</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
