<br/>
small stream flowing through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy</span>. To the south rise<br/>
the sublime peaks of Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbél</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feirén</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan</span>, was once<br/>
an episcopal see. These mountains were then filled with<br/>
hermits, and a flourishing monastery maintained. The ruins<br/>
still stand on almost every height, but the modern village<br/>
consists of ugly and comfortless mud huts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Numerous<br/>
</span>capitals and broken shafts, etc., are all that remain of the<br/>
once important church.<br/>
<br/>
In the beautiful Oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feirén </span>one or two days may be<br/>
well spent. In addition to the natural charms of the valley,<br/>
and the interest attaching to the ruins of the old episcopal<br/>
city, there are several attractions in the neighbourhood. The<br/>
ascent of Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serb'al </span>is a good day's work, and should<br/>
not be attempted by those totally inexperienced in mountain<br/>
climbing. The summit consists of several peaks of almost<br/>
uniform height, rising from a ridge three miles in length,<br/>
and 4,000 feet above the valleys at its base. The highest<br/>
peak is 6,7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">34 </span>feet above the sea. The attempt of some to<br/>
identify Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbél </span>with the Biblical Mount Sinai is now<br/>
generally considered to be refuted. Mount Sinai must have<br/>
an adjacent plain, and there is none such at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbél</span>. On the<br/>
edge of a precipice not far from the summit of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbél </span>are<br/>
the remains of an ancient beacon-tower. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>from the<br/>
top is extensive and very varied.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">g </span>ebel-el-Tahooneh, opposite the hill of El<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maharrad</span>, is the traditional scene of the uplifting of the<br/>
hands of Moses by Aaron and Hur, whilst the battle between<br/>
Amalek and Israel raged below. There are remains of a<br/>
chapel once commemorative of this event at the top of the<br/>
hill, and also remains of station chapels on the sides, showing the reverence with which the spot was regarded in the<br/>
early ages of Christianity. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebel-el-Moneij </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ah<br/>
