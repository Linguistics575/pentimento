<span>CAIRO. <span style="color: #0000FF;">91<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bitb-el-Azah</span>. This gate is in the form of an elliptical<br/>
arch, with two enormous brickwork towers, built in alternate<br/>
bands of red and white. Hence a narrow winding path.<br/>
leads to the highest part of the Citadel.. In this defile the<br/>
slaughter of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks </span>took place in 1811. Only one<br/>
escaped by leaping his horse from the terrace on the eastern<br/>
platform called La Saut du Mameluke.<br/>
<br/>
Mahomed Ali had been much alarmed by the plots of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks </span>against his authority, and resolved on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>total annihilation of the order. To compass this, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">summoned </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlook </span>Beys to Cairo, for purposes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">consultation </span>and festivity.<br/>
<br/>
"The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bays </span>came, mounted on their finest horses, in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>uniforms, forming the most superb cavalry in<br/>
the world. After a very flattering reception from the Pasha,<br/>
they were requested to parade in the court of the Citadel.<br/>
They entered the fortification unsuspectingly; the portcullis<br/>
fell behind the last of the proud procession. A moment's<br/>
glance revealed to them their doom. They dashed forwards.<br/>
In vain; before, behind, around them, nothing was visible<br/>
but black, pitiless walls and barred windows<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the only opening was towards the bright blue sky; even that was soon<br/>
darkened by their funeral pile of smoke, as volley after<br/>
volley flashed from a thousand muskets behind the ramparts<br/>
upon their <span style="color: #0000FF;">defenseless </span>and devoted band. Startling and<br/>
fearfully sudden as was their death, they met it as became<br/>
their fearless <span style="color: #0000FF;">character-Hone </span>with arms crossed upon their<br/>
mailed bosoms, and turbaned heads devoutly bowed in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>some with flashing swords and fierce curses, alike<br/>
unavailing against their dastard and ruthless foe. All that<br/>
chivalrous and splendid throng, save one, sank rapidly beneath the deadly fire into a red and writhing <span style="color: #0000FF;">mass-that </span>one<br/>
was Emir Bey. He spurred his charger over a heap of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
<br/>
