<br/>
slippers before ascending to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deween</span>, or divan, with its<br/>
cushions. The harem, or private apartments of the master<br/>
and his wives and children, is usually in the upper story.<br/>
There are no special rooms for sleeping in. Any room, or<br/>
even the roof of the house, is utilized for the purpose, and<br/>
the beds are stowed away in cupboards in the day-time.<br/>
<br/>
The outer Dress of a respectable Egyptian who has not<br/>
surrendered himself to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Frank </span>fashions<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>consists of a long<br/>
striped gown or <span style="color: #ff0000;">chooftan</span>, a white or coloured belt, and a<br/>
cloth coat. On the head is a tight-fitting cap, then a tasselled<br/>
cap of red cloth, round which is twisted a cashmere shawl as<br/>
a turban. The turban is much reverenced; it has its own<br/>
special resting-place in great <span style="color: #0000FF;">houses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and it would seem that<br/>
a crowd has been known first to rescue the turban, and then<br/>
assist the owner, when both have been "spilt "together off<br/>
a donkey<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>Green turbans mark the <span style="color: #ff0000;">slzereefs</span>, or descendants<br/>
of the prophets; the Copts and Jews, etc., have to keep to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dark </span>colours. The Syrian turban may be known by its<br/>
much greater breadth.<br/>
<br/>
The dress of the women consists of wide trousers drawn<br/>
in at the waist and below the knees. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Then </span>a long <span style="color: #ff0000;">chooftan</span>,<br/>
with hanging sleeves, laced from the girdle to the bosom. A<br/>
loose shawl round the waist, and a loose coat something like<br/>
that worn by the men, completes the costume. The headdress is a close-fitting cap, with a handkerchief tied round it.<br/>
Those who can afford it wear also the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ekoors</span>, or crown of<br/>
gold. The head-veil of muslin, ornamented with gold and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">colOured </span>silk, reaches from the back of the head to the<br/>
ground. The hair is cut away over the forehead, but at each<br/>
side hangs the side-lock which Egyptian ladies take hold of<br/>
when they swear. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Out-of-doors</span>, the person is further enveloped<br/>
in a huge gown, and the face-veil, reaching from below the<br/>
eyes to the feet, is put on. The eyelids are usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">tinged<br/>
<br/>
