<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-el-Fyoém</span>, a town built with the remains of<br/>
ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé</span>--fine columns grotesquely mixed with<br/>
rough brickwork. Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh </span>are the site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arsinoe'<br/>
</span>(ancient Crocodilopolis), the site of the artificial <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Maris</span>, and the remains of the celebrated Labyrinth, described by Herodotus as surpassing the Pyramids (p. 212).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisooéf </span>(W., 73 miles from Cairo). Railway<br/>
Station. This is the capital of the province of the same<br/>
name, one of the most productive provinces of Egypt. The<br/>
town has a population of about 5000. There is a post-office<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">telegraph-oftirm </span>some factories of woollen and linen,<br/>
and a bazaar. The latter is a wretched little affair with<br/>
shops like cupboards. The scene on the shore is animated<br/>
and picturesque, boats of various kinds cluster at the margin<br/>
of the stream; people of all ages are <span style="color: #ff0000;">clamouring </span>or bargaining, children playing, picturesque old men in white<br/>
dresses lean on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">stages </span>and watch the crowd; girls<br/>
come down and fill their water-jars and gracefully poise<br/>
them on their heads as they walk away; dogs, goats,<br/>
poultry, cows, horses, camels, and buffaloes add to the noise<br/>
and excitement of the scene. Passing on from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisooéf<br/>
</span>numerous chimneys of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s sugar factories become<br/>
conspicuous from time to time.<br/>

beautiful veined marble for the mosque of Mahomed Ali was<br/>

<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibbeh </span>(W.) Railway Station. Here is a Coptic<br/>
convent where St. George has procured favour for the<br/>
inmates in past times by being described as a Muslim<br/>
saint under the name of .El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibbéwee</span>; the two creeds<br/>
seem to have got on comfortably together by this<br/>
arrangement, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans </span>still visit the convent <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
