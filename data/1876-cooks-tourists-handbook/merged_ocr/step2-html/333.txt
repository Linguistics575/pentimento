<br/>
THOMAS COOK & SON<br/>
<br/>
HAVE been enabled to secure the services of Mr. FLOYD, and in one of<br/>
those seasons of unusual difficulty, occasioned by snow storms in the<br/>
Lebanon, his services were appreciated at the highest value by a party of<br/>
nearly thirty, amongst whom were many distinguished travellers, both<br/>
American and English. Mr. FLOYD is now engaged to superintend the<br/>
business of THOMAS COOK & <span style="color: #0000FF;">Son </span>in Palestine and Syria, to engage the<br/>
best Dragomans of the country, and to travel with <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>many parties as possible.<br/>
<br/>
New and important <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangements </span>have been made with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">proprietor<br/>
</span>of the Jerusalem Hotel at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>a to accommodate our travellers, and to place<br/>
at our disposal all available carriages between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa </span>and Jerusalem. For<br/>
excess of numbers horses will continue to be provided for the best riders,<br/>
and the aim will be to complete the journey between the port and the Holy<br/>
City in a day. With a view to the probability of effecting such a desirable<br/>
arrangement, THOMAS <span style="color: #ff0000;">COOK </span>& SON last year purchased a large and convenient house outside the walls of Jerusalem, which may be used as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Depat<br/>
</span>for tent equipments and stores, and a centre of organizations for travelling<br/>
through the country.<br/>
<br/>
These new itineraries will be worked out under the supervision of Mr.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">FLOYD</span>, who has been engaged as the Palestine representative of THOMAS<br/>
COOK & SON, and who will have the selection of the best dragomans that<br/>
can be found in the country, such dragomans being under his control.<br/>
<br/>
Parties in any numbers can select any of the following itineraries, and<br/>
travel quite independent of any other parties, having their own dragomans<br/>
and camp servants<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The scale of charges will be regulated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>numbers, from two to ten<br/>
persons<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>ten and upwards being the numbers for which the lowest uniform<br/>
charges are made. Quotations of fares will be given when the numbers are<br/>
made up and the routes to and through Palestine are determined upon. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>can furnish tickets to travel by any line of Atlantic and Mediterranean<br/>
Steamers, and by any route over the European Continent, and it will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>to the interest of travellers to take through tickets from America, England,<br/>
or elsewhere, to Palestine and back.<br/>
