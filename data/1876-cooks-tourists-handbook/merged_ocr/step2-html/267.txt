<span>PASSAGE OF THE RED SEA. 249<br/>
<br/>
SUEZ TO <span style="color: #0000FF;">MOUNT.SINAI</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Suez (see p. 219).<br/>
<br/>
The route forward lies round the head of the gulf, and<br/>
across the Great Canal (p. 22 3). The camp is generally fixed<br/>
for the first night at Ain Moosa<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or the Wells of<br/>
Moses, so called from the Arab tradition that here Moses<br/>
refreshed the Israelites after the passage of the Red Sea. It<br/>
is an oasis on an elevated spot in the desert, consisting of<br/>
seven gardens or groves, chiefly date-palm and tamarisk,<br/>
created by twelve fountains of brackish water. Indeed,<br/>
water is found anywhere in this spot by digging a few feet.<br/>
There are two hotels here.<br/>
<br/>
The Passage of the Red Sea by the Children of<br/>
Israel was probably within<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>sight of this spot. Opinions<br/>
vary, however, on this point. Three localities are <span style="color: #ff0000;">specially'<br/>
</span>argued for by different scholars.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. Between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Att√©kah </span>on the western shore, and a tongue<br/>
of land opposite on the east shore; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish </span>host<br/>
turned aside by Divine command from the head of the gulf,<br/>
descended the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wzidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Twarik</span>, when, being shut in by mountains on either hand, the sea in front, and the Egyptian army<br/>
in the rear, a passage was miraculously opened to the farther<br/>
shore. Arab tradition favours this site. But the passage in<br/>
this case would be twelve miles from shore to shore, and it<br/>
is difficult to reconcile the events recorded with so long a<br/>
journey across.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span>. A point near Suez.<br/>
<br/>
3. A point above Suez. This latter hypothesis is based on<br/>
the idea that the Gulf once extended to the Bitter <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lakes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">possibly </span>even to Lake Timsah (p. 225).<br/>
<br/>
Either of the last two seem probable. But whatever<br/>
theory be adopted, the visitor to Ain Moosa can survey <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
