KANTARAH TO GAZA.' 28 I

David was approaching Carmel from the wilderness of
Paran, the region near the Dead Sea, where he had protected
N abal's flocks from the raids of the Bedouins, when Abigail
met him and appeased his anger. Such was, doubtless, the

and the beautiful adjacent valley come into view. For miles

the desert journey at Cairo, Kantarah (p. 227) can be readily
reached by railway and canal, and then the camels used
from that place forward.
