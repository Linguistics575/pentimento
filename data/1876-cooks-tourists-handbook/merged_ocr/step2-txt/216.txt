are remains of a temple, rich in hieroglyphics and sculptures
of the time of Augustus.

Gerf Hossayn (W.) has a temple of the time of
Rameses, dedicated to the god Phtah. _

"We passed through some corn fields," says a traveller;
"then came a strip of desert, then a tall cliff, and in it the
enormous propylon of the temple. This, though built by
human hands, stands out from the face of the mountain as if
it had formed part of it from creation; four giant statues
leaning against stone pillars support its massive entablature.
The vista of this colossal portico leads to a portal in the
living rock some twenty feet in height, and this is the
entrance to the temple. The coup d'teil as we entered was
very imposing. A group of swarthy Arabs were waving
blazing torches, and looked like officiating demon-priests to
the tall, awful, gigantic idols that towered above us; the
temple seemed full of these grim statues, though there are
only two rows, containing four in each. The massive
pedestals on which they stand are but ten feet apart, which
adds considerably to the effect of their enormous size.
Hence we passed into the lesser hall, and then into the
adytum. The numerous torches here gleamed upon walls
shadowily giving out pictured battles, and kneeling priests,
and stern deities, and in the centre of the'shrine was a rude
altar, beyond which sat four gigantic idols, with strangelooking crowns upon their heads, and mysterious emblems
in their hands.

"There were many other chambers, and everywhere pillar
and entablature were thickly encrusted with reliefs."
