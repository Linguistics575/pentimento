THEBES. I 67

Towards the middle of the tomb are the chambers which
chiefly merit attention. Very varied scenes are represented
amongst others the famous harpists may be noticed of
which so many copies have been made.

This tomb received its common name from the traveller
Bruce, who was the first to make it known to Europeans.
There was once a sarcophagus of red granite in the principal
chamber of this tomb, of which the lid is now at Cambridge
and the other portion at the Louvre.

Greek graffiti are found in the tomb we are describing,
as in many others; these show that they were visited by
strangers in the Ptolemaic era, and were probably those from
which the royal mummies had been taken and dispersed by
Cambyses.

The Tomb of Sethi II. (No. 15) is distinguished by
figures in high relief at the entrance.

The Tomb of Rameses IV. (No. 2) is distinguished
by its high ceiling and slight inclination, so that it could be
easily visited on horseback, at the end of the tomb the
granite sarcophagus of colossal proportions is still in its
place.

Tomb of Rameses VI. (No. 9) is 243 feet in
length, and is remarkable for the astronomical representations on its ceilings. In Ptolemaic times, for some unknown
reason, this tomb, as is shown by the Greek inscriptions,
was called the Tomb of Memnon.

Tomb of Rameses IX. (No. 6) contains very striking pictures representing the idea of resurrection after
death.

From Bab-el-Molook tourists can return by either of
two or three routes. There is one interesting route over
the mountain chain which should be taken if possible.
