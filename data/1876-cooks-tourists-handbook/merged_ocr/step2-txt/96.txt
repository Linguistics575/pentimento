number being on the ground floor, and the remainder on the
floor above. The rooms are cool, spacious, and convenient,
without being gaunt and grand. The situation is in the
midst of the most fashionable part of the town, and from the
large verandah, or court, in front of the hotel, all the'life'
of Cairo may be seen.

"Hotel charges in Cairo are arranged in this wise: so
much a day must be paid for bed-room, breakfast, luncheon,
and dinner; and the traveller who takes only one meal or
two, or all the meals but not the bed-room accommodation,
has to pay the full tariff notwithstanding."------( E. H.)
