CAIRO. 93

On the left of the entry a golden grill encloses the tomb
of Mahomed Ali, with the lamps perpetually burning. In
the court there is a pavilion in the gallery facing the Fountain of Ablutions, containing a clock presented to Mahomed
Ali by Louis Philippe. From above this pavilion there is a
splendid prospect of Cairo and Lower Egypt, which some
have asserted to be the finest view in the world. At the foot
of the Citadel, stretching northward, lies Cairo, with its
innumerable domes and minarets, beyond stretches the
verdant Delta. On the right are seen the Tombs of the
Memlooks, and the Obelisk of Heliopolis; on the left are
Old Cairo and the well-wooded Island of Roda, more domes

Nile, and beyond these the Pyramids of Ghizeh and Sakkarah, and the Great Desert of Libya. Turning to the
south, Mount Mokattam is seen, with its rugged steeps, its
quarries, and its ruins. Anyone staying at Cairo should
endeavour to see this view at least two or three times at
different periods of the day.

Joseph's Well is another of the curiosities of the
Citadel. It has nothing to do with the Patriarch, as popularly asserted, but owes its origin to Saladin, whose Arabic
name was Youssoof (Joseph), and was sunk for the military
necessities of the fortress. According to another account,
Saladin utilized an ancient Egyptian well discovered by him
in sinking for foundations. It is fifteen feet in diameter,
and reaches the Nile level at a depth of 290 feet. A winding staircase conducts to the bottom, where the donkeys are
seen at work raising the water to the top by means of an
endless chain, with vessels attached to it. There is also an
Aqueduct, bringing Nile water from Old Cairo to the
Citadel.
