16 INTRODUCTORY.

Dahabeahs can only be preferable to steamers for invalids or
families wishing to pass the winter on the Nile.

The writer says he could add a dozen or two more points to
those already enumerated; and states that the question of
expense needs no discussion, the fact being patent that the
rates by Steamer are much lower than those by Dahabeah.

Messrs. COOK & SON are quite prepared to book travellers
either Steamer or Dahabeah, and to make the best arrangements possible to be made by either mode of transit.



FROM CAIRO TO THE FIRST CATARACT
OF THE NILE.

DAILY ITINERARY.

SECTION I.
FIRST DAY.

The starting place is now from above the new iron bridge
. "Kasr-e1-Nil," which leads to the Pyramids of Ghizeh. The
steamer generally leaves at 3 p.m., and arrives same evening at
Bedreshayn (railway station, and starting point to visit the site
of Memphis, the Serapeum, and the Pyramids of Sakkarah
and Dash√©or). Donkeys sent from Cairo overnight will be
waiting at Bedreshayn to take the passengers to Memphis, the
Serapeum, etc., before the departure of the steamer the following
morning. These places, being so near to Cairo, and easily
accessible by rail, are generally visited from Cairo, donkeys
being sent on during the night, or taken along in the trains; but
steamers on their way up the Nile now allow time for sightseeing at this place.
