HEBRON. 29 I

territory is referred to by the phrase, "from Beersheba to
the valley of Hinnom" (Neh. xi. 43). Idolatrous worship
was carried on here in the time of Amos. In v. 4, f, the
prophet exhorts Israel to seek the Lord, and "pass not to
Beersheba," and in viii. 14, he declares that "they that
swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, o Dan,
liveth; or, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall
fall, and never rise up again." From the time of the return
from the Captivity, there is no mention of this place in the
Bible records. It was a place of some importance in the
time of Jerome, and subsequently became an episcopal see
under the Bishop of Jerusalem.

Jerusalem, see Cook's Tourists' Handbook for Palestine and
