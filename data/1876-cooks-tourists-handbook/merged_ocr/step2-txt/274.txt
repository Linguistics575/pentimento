The village of Feirén, the medieval Pharan, was once
an episcopal see. These mountains were then filled with
hermits, and a flourishing monastery maintained. The ruins
still stand on almost every height, but the modern village
consists of ugly and comfortless mud huts. Numerous
capitals and broken shafts, etc., are all that remain of the
once important church.

In the beautiful Oasis of Feirén one or two days may be
well spent. In addition to the natural charms of the valley,

generally considered to be refuted. Mount Sinai must have
an adjacent plain, and there is none such at Serbél. On the
edge of a precipice not far from the summit of Serbél are
the remains of an ancient beacon-tower. The view from the
top is extensive and very varied.

hill, and also remains of station chapels on the sides, showing the reverence with which the spot was regarded in the
early ages of Christianity. The Jebel-el-Moneij ah
