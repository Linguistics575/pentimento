252 THE DESERT.

Of the three routes leading from Wady-ed-Dehseh to the
Wédy Ghurundel, the central route is mostly chosen, through
the Wédy Sadur, the Wédy Wardan, and the Wzidy Amarah.
In the latter valley are seen the group of rocks called Hagarel-Rekkab, or Stone of the Rider.

Ain Hawarah (the Fountain of Destruction) is usually
identified with Marah, where the bitter waters were made
sweet; a few stunted palms and tamarisks surround a stone

numerous. The rocks are very fine, some exactly resemble
fortresses and battlements. The "lady Ethal and the
mouth of the may Shebeikah are next passed. Here a
