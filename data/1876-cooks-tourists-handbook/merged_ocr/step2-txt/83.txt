ALEXANDRIA. 69

seen. It does not seem real; it is hard to divest one's mind
of the thought that it is a great carnival, a mammoth masquerade, got up for the occasion. It is a vast crowd, a
stupendous noise, a new sensation.

"A Babel of many tongues, a blaze of curious costumes-these are the first things of which you are conscious; then
you stand for a time to see the ceaseless crowd pass you, and
you single out the various nationalities. Those men with
the ringlets are Syrian Jews, those bedizened horsemen are
Turks i those high-capped and black-habited men are Copts;
those youths enjoying themselves within an inch of their
lives are English midshipmen; that curious being in a
white dress like a ballet-dancer's, and legs tied up with
strings, is an Albanian, those blackies are Nubians.
There are French dandies, Italian beauties, Hindoo monstrosities, Bedouin brigands, women in trousers, men in
petticoats, Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers
in Mesopotamia and in India, in Cappadocia, in Pontus, and
Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia--every nation under the sun
seems to have sent forth its representative to Alexandria.
Now comes a string of camels, and the surging crowds jostle
among the vendors of fruit and cooked mysteries; then
there is a shout, and adventurous donkey-boys are urging on
their beasts, burdened with bundles of veiled beauty. Now
music is heard, and a crowd collects round a wandering
minstrel, soon to be dispersed, as a' runner t cries out for
room for the carriage of a grandee. And, amid all the uproar, those grim old Turks sit cross-legged on the carpets
of their divans, or the dais of their stalls, and smoke their
narghilies, and sip their coffee, as though they were in profound solitude."--( Edwin Hodder.)
