Passing El Helleh (E.) and the mounds of Kom Ayr
(W.), the last Pyramid within the limits of Egypt is seen,
that of El Kodla (W.), it is a limestone structure about
sixty feet square, and is now in a very ruinous condition-what remains is under forty feet in height. El Kom-el-Ahmar
(W.) is the site of Hieraconopolis, the City of the Hawks,

Egyptian article of commerce, is found in the vicinity.
