Bordighera is famous for its f1oriou1ture (roses, carnations, ane-
mones, etc.), which partly supplants olive-growing, and for its
date-palms (Phoenix dactylifera), of which, however, the fruit seldom
ripens smffieiently to be edible. Like Iles d'Hyere and Elche (see
Baedeker's Spain) Bordighera does a large business in supplying
ptlm-bramshetr to Roman Catholic churches for Palm Sunday and
to Jewish communities for the Feast of Tehernaeles. For the former
purpose the leaves are bleached on the trees by being tightly bound
up. - The iinegt palms are seen in the above-named gardens, in
that of the Villa Gamier (to the E. of the town), at Herr Winter's

Vallone Garden,'h M. to the E., near the Sasso bridge, and in the
