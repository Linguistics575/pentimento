Lugano (932 ft.), the largest and busiest town in the Swiss
canton of Ticino, with 9400 inhab., is charmingly situated on the
lake of the same name, and is a very pleasant place for a lengthened
stay, especially as a tramsitiim-stagty on the way farther south.
The winter temperature is somewhat higher than that of Montreux
or Meran; the heat of summer is seldom excessive; while in sprin g
and autumn N. winds prevail, from which, however, Castagnola
(p. li) is somewhat protected. The environs possess all the charms
of Italian mountain-se-; numerous villages, churches, chapels,
and country-seats are scattered along the banks of the lake, and
the lower hills are covered with vineyards and gardens, contrasting
beautifully with the dark-foliage of the chestnuts and walnuts in
the background. To the 8., immediately above the town, rises the
Monte San Salvatore o. 11), wooded to its summit; to the Isl.,
across the lake, is the Monte di Caprino, to the right is the Monte
Gmeroso (p. 13), to the left are the Monte Brt (p. li) and the
beautiful Monte Bo'glia (p. 12). On the N. opens the broad valley
of the Cassarate, backed by a. group of mountains among Which the
double peak of Monte Camoghé (p. 12) and the rugged Sasso Grand:
(4880_ft.), are conspicuous.

To the E. of the steamboat-pier of Lugano-Citti lies the Puzu
GIARDINO (P1. G, D, 3), an open space beautiiled by pleasure
grounds and a fountain. On its W. side rises the imposing Palasto
