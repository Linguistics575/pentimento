Environs ot'morenee." SAN MINIATO. 59. Route. 521

the large circular Piaualc Galileo (386 ft.; comp. Pl. th 8), is
continued as the Vialc Galileo (side-path to the Torre a1 Gallo, see
. 523) along the slopes to San Miniato and the Piazsale Michelangelo
{ see below). Lastly, under the name of Vialc Michelangelo (Pl. G,
B, 8), it descends in a long curve to the river, where it terminates
at the Ponte in Ferro, near the Barriers San Niceolb (Pl. B, 8).
This road, which is 60 ft. wide and nearly 33/. M. in length, is
bordered with charming pleasure-grounds, containing bsys, elms,
sycamores, and hedges of roses, over which delightful views are
obtained. - Part of the Viale dei Colli is traversed by the electric
tramway No. 8 (p. 434). The Piazzale Michelangelo and San Minieto
are, - however, more speedily reached from the Ports S. Niccolb
o. 520), which is passed try the electric tramway No. 7 (p. 434).
Near San Miniato the road passes the large *Piunle Hiehel-
angelo (340 ft.; Pl. F, G, 8), forming a kind of projecting terrace
5 min. from the Porta B. Niccolb (p. 520). In the Piazzsle caf√©-
restaurant) rises s bronze copy of Michael Angelo's David (p. 93),
the pedestal of which is surrounded by the four periods of the day
(p. 500). Charming'Vmw: to the N.E., on the hill, lies Fiesole;
then the city with B. Croce, the Cathedral, 8. Lorenzo, the Pthec-
chio, S. Maria Novella, and the Lungame; to the left are the villa-
covered heights, the Fortezzs del Belvedere, and the Monte Oliveto.
(b.) SAN anro, with its light-coloured marble facade, on
the hill to the S.E. of Florence, is a conspicuous object from many
different points. It may be reached in a few minutes by the road
and footpath diverging to the right from the Viale Galileo (see
above), just before the Piezzele Michelangelo. The fpotpath passes
the secularized Franciscan monastery of Ban Salvatore or Ban
Francesco a1 Monte (Pl. Ir, G, 8), with a church erected by Cronaca
in 1475-1504, the simple and chaste proportions of which were
deservedly praised by Michael Angelo, who called it'le belle ville-
ne11i. On the high-altar is a thuoif1xion with SS. Mary, J ohn, and
Francis, and above the left side-portal, e Pieth in the style of Giov.
delta Robbin, in painted terracotta. - We now ascend towards the
gateway of the old fortifioations, constructed by Michael Angelo in
1529 as engineer to the republic, and defended by him during an -
eleven months' siege of the city by the Imperial troops. Duke
Cosimo I. converted the hill Into a regular fort in 1652. Visitors
ring at the gate and bestow a gratuity of 16-20 o. on leaving. The
ch arehind the whole hill, the so-called Monte alle Croci, have been
used since 1839 as a Burial Ground (ilrtts views, especially from
the S. wall of the cemetery). The monuments show the taste of
the modern Florentine sculptors, who lay great stress upon an
accurate rendering of clothes, lace, ornaments, and the like, and
whose skill iindg numerous admirers..
The church of *Ban Hiniato al Monte is one of the f1myst ex-
