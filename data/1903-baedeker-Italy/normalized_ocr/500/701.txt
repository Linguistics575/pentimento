510 Route 58. FLORENCE._ h. Left Bank of the Arno:

The quaint and picturesque Ponte Veoohio (Pl. D, 6; pp. 445,
448), over which the covered passage mentioned "p. 468 is carried,
forms the most direct communication between the Piazza della
Signoria, with the Trfflzi, and the Palazzo Pitti. The bridge is
flanked with shops, which have belonged to the goldsmithe since
the 14th century. A bronze bust of Benvenuto Cellini (1500-72;
p. ddd), sculptor and goldsmith, by Raffaello Romanelli, was placed
here in 1901...

For the Via dt' Bardi, which leads to the left just beyond the Ponte
Vecchio, see p. 519.

The line of the Ponte Vecchio is continued by the VIA DB' GU10-
cnnmm (Pl. D, 6), which passes a small piazza adorned with a col-
umn dating from the 14th century. On the S. side of the piazza is
the old church of Santa Fclicitd (P1.'D, 6), restored in 1736 and
containing 1; Madonna with saints by Taddeo Gaddi (4th altar to the
right). At the end of the street, to the left (No. 17), is situated
the Palazzo thsieeiardini, where the historian Francesco Guiccier-
dini (1482-1540) lived; opposite to it, on the right (No. 16),
is the Cam Campigli or house of Machiavelli (15th cent; lately
'restored').

The'Pelazzo Pitti (P1. 0, 6), conspicuously situated osrthe
tslope of the Boboli hill, was designed by Brunelle8ehi about 1440
and begun by Luca Francelli, by order of Luca Pitti, the powerful
opponent of the Medici, whom he hoped to excel in exterml
grandeur by the erection of the most imposing palace yet built by
a private citizen. The failure of the conspiracy against Piero iid
Medici in 1466 cost Lucathe loss of his power and intiuenee, and
the building remained tintinitshed till the middle of the following
cent., when it had come, through a great-grandson of Luca, into
the potieMion of Eleonora, wife of Duke Cosimo I. (1549). The
palace, which somewhat resembles a castle or a prison, is remarkable
for its bold simplicity, and the unadorned blocks of stone are hewn
smooth at the Joints only. The central part has a third story. The
etreetivenetsg of the building is mainly produced by its tine pro-
portions (comp. p. xlv), and it shows u wonderful union of or-
cloPean massiveness with stately regularity' (George Eliot). The
facade is 119 ft. high and was originally only of the width of the
present top story. About the year 1568 Bartolomeo Ammanati
inserted the beautiful Renaissance windows of the grounMoor, and
added the waterspouts in the form of lions' heads. In 1658-70 he
constructed the large colonnaded court, which is adjoined by s grotto
with niches and fountains, and the Boboli Garden beyond them.
The wings of the palace were added by Alf. Parigi after 1620,
extending the length of the facade from 360 ft. to 672 ft. The two
1'rof, hi'ar, Tl1t, e: were added about 1763.

In 15 the Pitti Palace superseded the Palazzo Veeehio o. M6)
as the residence of the reigning sovereign, and it is now that of the
