gave a. renewed impulse to Its use. The industry now grown steadily-, in
1899 about 180,000 tons were exported from Cerrare alone. About BOO
quarries in all are in operation-, of these wi, with Mm workmen, are "
Carrartr, 50 (700 men) at Hana (see below), and the rest at Berauzza, Pietra-
'anta, Stazzema, and Anti. There are 109 marble-sawing works at Carrara,
employing about 600 men, and 28 at Muse, with about 170 men. The beet
and largest blocks ield the name atatuario. - The quarrymen, who
receive a wage of 1- fr. per day, quit work at 8 or t p.m.

A visit to the quarries (2-3 hrs-, guide, not indispensable, 2-3 fr.) is
best made early in the morning, when the weather is warm. From the
. above-mentioned Piezze dell' Academia we follow the Pia Santa Karin. to

the end of the town and ascend the valley along the left bank of the
Carrione. At (1/4 MO a group of houses a. path diverges to the right to
large quarries of inferior marble, but we cantinue to follow the road,
passing numerous marble cutting and polishing works. At the entrance
to the "MO village of Torano we turn to the right and climb the steep
lanes to the marble railway (see below), the metals of which we follow
in the narrow ehadelese u land valley, passing numerous quarries, to (1 M.)

staurant), but the accent is fatiguing, and ehould be attempted only when
time is abundant. A horn is blown as a signal when the rock is about
to be blasted. The. blocks of marble are carried away partly by means of
ox-waggons, partly by means of a railway trerrooia Marmitdra), which
sends branches into several of the lateral valleys. Visitors are sometimes
allowed to ride in the trains; the tunnel: are very cold.
