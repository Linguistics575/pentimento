bridge), with 3061 inhab., is finely situated 1 M. above the station,
at the entrance to the Val Toumanche. Its houses are pieturesquely
scattered over the gorge of the Matmoire or Marmara, a torrent de-
sending from the Matterhorn; and in the middle of the town is a.
bridge spanning the ravine in one fine arch. (To Val Tournanche,
and over the Théodule Pass to Zermatt, see Baedeker'g Switzerland.)

The line crosses the Matmoire, traverses a. deep cutting through a
deposit of debris, threads two tunnels, and reaches (671/2 M.) Cham-
bane (1655 ft.), noted for its wine. To the W. opens the view of the
beautiful valley of Aosta, rich in fruit and surrounded by lofty
mountains, with the three-peaked Rutor (p. 60) in the background.

Beyond a tunnel the line traverses a. mass of debris at Diemoz
(viaduct 107 yds. long), and crosses the Dora. To the left lies the
picturesque chateau of Fém'e (with old mural paintings), at the mouth
of the C'lavalité Valley, through which peeps the snowy peak of the
Tmtva (p. 58). The train crosses the Dora twice and reaches (72 M.)
Nu: (1755 ft.; Croce d'Oro), with a ruined castle, at the mouth of
the Val St. Barthélemy. We then recross to the right bank of the
Dora. On the slope above (73 M.) St. Marcel, which lies at the
mouth of the valley of the same name (p. 58), is the much-frequented

Aosta, lies at the eonthtenee of the Buthicr and the Doire or Dora

race, who commanded the passage of the Great and the Little
St. Bernard, the two chief routes fr'om Italy to Gaul. They frequently
harassed the Romans in various ways, until they were conquered in
B.0. 25 by Terentiue Varro, who sold many of them as slaves at

(1886), commemorating the king's sporting expeditions amid the
Greian Alps. A short walk brings us to the ancient Town Walla,
