66 Route 16. GENOA.

As the country iltmsrtr in many respects from Piedmont, so also do its
huum'ume, while their Genoese dialect, which is irtffleu1t for farei ners
to understand, occupies a middle place between the Gallic patois of pper
Italy and that of Sardinia. The historical development of the two countries
has also been widely different. The natural resource of the Ligum'am, or
the inhabitants of the Riviera, was the sea, and they were accordingly known
to the Greeks at a very early period as pirates and freebooters. As the Greek
Massalia. formed the centre of trade in 8. France, with Nikaea (Nice) "its
extreme outpost towards the lil., so Genoa constituted the natural outlet for
the traffic of the Riviera. During the 3rd cent. B.C. Genoa became subject
to the Romans, who In subsequent centuries had to wage long and obstinate
wars with the Ligurians, in order to secure the poeseseiou of the military
coast-road to Spain. As late as the reign of Augustus the Roman ou } ture
had made little progress here. At that period the inhabitants exported
timber, cattle, hides, wool, and honey, receiving wine and oil in exchange.
In the'tth cent. the Lombard: gained a. footing here, and theneeforth the
political state of the country was gradually altered. The W. part with
Nice belonged to Provence, but in 1388 came into the possession of the
Counts of'Savoy, forming their only access to the sea down to the eriod
when they acquired Genoa (1815). After the Austrian war of 185 Nice
(1512 sq. M.) and. Savoy (3889 sq. M.) were ceded by Italy to France in
1860 as B. compensation for the services rendered by Napoleon III.

The district of Liguria, consisting of the provinces of Porto Maurizio
and Genoa, with an area of 2040 sq. M. and 899,300 inhab., once formed the
REPUBLIC or GENOA, which in the 18th cent. became mistress of the W.
part of the Mediterranean, and afterwards fought against Venice for the
supremacy of the Levant. Genoa's greatness was founded on the ruin of
Pisa. The Tuscan hatred of the Genoeee was embodied in the saying -
'Mare senza. pesce, montagne eenza. elberi, uomini senza. fede, e donne senza
vergogms', and Dante ant. xxxiii. 151-53) addresses them with the words - I

'Ahi, Genovesi, uomini diversi

D'ogni costume, e pien d'ogni megagna;

Perche non eiete voi del mondo spent t'
Modern histm-ians describe the character of the Genoese in the middle
ages in a similar strain. The whole energy of the Genoese seems indeed I
to have been concentrated on commerce and the pursuit of gain. Notwith-
standing their proud naval supremacy, they participated little in the
intellectual development of Italy, and neither possessed a school of art,
nor produced any scholars of eminence. When at length the eeetts re-
public was incorporated with Piedmont, it became the representative of
radical principles as contrasted with the conservatism of the royalist terri-
tory. Giuseppe Mazzim' was born at Genoa. in 1808, and Garibaldi, thOugh
born at Nice (1807), was the son of a Genoese of Chiavari. The rivalry
of the once far-famed republic with the upstart Turin, and of the restless
harbour population with the stolid Piedmontese, have of recent years
been productive of very notable results. Modern Genoa has, moreover,
regained its ancient mercantile importanee, though its navel arsenal has
been transferred to Spezie.
