xl ITALIAN ART.

pression, warmly extolled their authors, and zealously proclaimed
how greatly they surpassed their ancestors. But succeeding g6Wera-
tions began to lose sight of this connection between ancient and
modern art. A mere anecdote was deemed tmffioitmt to connect
Giotto dl Bondene (1276-1337), the father of modern Italian art,
with GIOVANNI Cnum'm (d. after 1302), the most celebrated re-
presentative of the earlier style. (Cimabue is said to have watched
Giotto, when, as a tshepherd-boy, relieving the monotony of his
offltay by tracing the outlines of his sheep in the sand, and to have
received him as a pupil in consequence.) But it Was forgotten
that a revolution in artistic ideas and forms had taken place at
Rome and Siens still earlier than "Florence, that both Cimabue
and his pupil Giotto had numerous professional brethren, and
that the 4sornpositioti" of mosaics, as well as mural and ptmel-.
painting, was still successfully practised. Subsequent investigation
has rectified these errors, pointed out the Roman and Tuscan mosaics
"works of the tramsition-ptsriod, and restored the Sienese master
Duccio (ca. 1300), who wss remarkable for his sense of the beauti-
ful and the expressiveness of his flgures, to his merited rank.
Giotto, however, is fully entitled to rank in the highest class. The
amateur, who before entering Italy has become acquainted with
Giotto from imrigrtif1eent tsturel-pieturtsts only, often arbitrarily
attributed to this master, and even in Italy Itself encounters
little else than obliquely drawn eyes, clumsy features, and
cumbrous masses of drapery ss characteristics of his style, will
regard Giotto's reputation as ill-founded. He will be at a loss
to comprehend why Giotto is regarded as the insugurator of a
new era of art, and why the name of the old Florentine master
is only second in popularity to that of Raphael. The fact is that
ammo: Giotto's celebrity is not due to any single perfect work of
INPLUENCI- art. His indefatigable energy in different spheres of art, the
enthusiasm which he kindled in every direction, and the develop-
ment for which he paved the way, must be taken into consideration,
in order that his place in history may be understood. Even when,
in consonance with the poetical sentiments of his age, he embodies
allegorical conceptions, as poverty, chastity, obedience, or displays
to us a. ship as an emblem of the Church of Christ, he shows a
masterly acquaintance with the art of converting what is perhaps
in itself an ungrateful idea into a speaking, lifelike scene.
Giotto is an adept in narration, in imparting a faithful reality to
his compositions. The individual figures in his pictures may fail
to satisfy the expectations, and even earlier masters, such as
Duceio, may have surpassed him in execution, but intelligibility
of movement and dramatic effect were first naturalised in art by
Giotto. This is partly attributable to the luminous colouring
employed by him instead of the dark and heavy tones of his
predecessors, enabling him to impart the proper expression to
