to the church are two earlier frescoes: Adoration of the Shepherds by
Alum Baldomm (1460); Investiture of Filippo Benizzi founder o the
order, by Cosimo Rossetti (14.76). Then to the left follow "'Frescoes by
Andrea del Sarto: Ban Filippo clothing the sick (beside it, bust of Andrea,
by a. Caeeinir, Gamblers struck by lightning while mocking S. Filippo;
Cure of a possessed women; Dead man nised to life by the corpse of
S. Filippo; Boy healed by the ssint's robe.'Curied sway by his feeling
for harmony of colour, and charmed whenever he could reelize a vague
and vsporous twilight of tone (see especially the Death of the Seint), Andrea
was unable to combine that appearance with absolute neutral contrasts....
but the balance was almost restored by the facility with which he obtained
tmns'isrence, gay colours, and smoothness in the melting of tints into eseh
other. - 0. J: 0. - These paintings were executed by A. del Sarto while
still young (ca. 1510); he sppesrs es it flnUhed master in the'Freseoes
on the other side: Arrival of the Magi, executed with a still more running
hand (than the following) but with less cheetened sentiment, the flgttrei'
characterised by a. gelt-eonMent swing (th J: 0.), end the Nativity of Mary,
painted in 1514'on the highest level ever reached in fresco'. In the right
foreground of the former, facing the spectator, is a portrait of J ac. Sensovino,
while the printer himself is shown pointing towards the front. The dignified
women in the centre of the other fresco is A. del Ssrto's wife. - The

lignitted composition, and the beauty of the colouring, which is still
liseernible in spite of its damaged condition. Below it is the monument
tf the 1raleonieri, the founders of the church. On the same side is the
