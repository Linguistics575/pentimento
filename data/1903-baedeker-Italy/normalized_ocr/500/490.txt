Aquileia (Aquila Nera, well spoken of i Fortuna; Caf√© Pasta),
a village of 2300 inhab., which lies 3 M. to the S. It is now 6 M.
from the see, but is connected with the lagoons by canals. In the
vicinity are many fever-breeding riee-fieldg (p. 64).

The town of Aquileia, founded by the Romans in B. C. 181 as a bul-
wark against the Celts and Istrians, was already a commercial and trad-
ing place of great importance in the reign of Augustus; its chief products
were amber and glass ware. As a naval station and strong frontier-fortress,
it seen became the chief point d'appm' of the Romans in their campaigns
against Illyrie and the lands of the Danube. In 238 A.D. the town was
besieged in vain by Em. Maximinus Thrax, and in 4.52 it was destroyed
by Attila, after an obstinate resistance. Though soon rebuilt, it never

Aceor g to tradition, Aquileia was converted to Christianity in the
flr8t century of our era by St. Mark and St. Hermagoraa, the tuteiar and
Brat bishop of the town. It soon became a. metropolis of the new faith,
and its bishops assumed the atriarehal title in 557 (7). The strehbiahoprits

Of the Roman Aquileia all that has been discovered is the re-
mains of one street and the N.W. angle of the town-walls. The
sculptures and small works of art found in the excavations are pre-
served in the Aaumaor, oattuI, MUSEUM, founded in 1882, which
is open daily, 9-12 and 2-4 (in summer, 3-6; adm. 40 h.; plan of
the city and excavations 1 K.). Director, Prof. H. Maionica.

_ The chief mediaeval monument is the *CATHBDBAL, a tha-rooted
basilica with aisles and trensept, erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031
on the site of an early-Christian church. Destroyed try an earth-
quake in 1348, it was rebuilt try Patriarch Marquard about 1379 in
the Gothic style. The Renaissance additions date from the Venetian

p eriod (ea. 1600).

Ix'rnnlon. In the left aisle is a small circular chapel, in marble (1031). -
The c oir contains Renaissance stalls and an altar-pieee by Pellegrino da
San Daniele, in a flne old frame, with the tutelars of Rome (SS. Peter and
Paul) Aqufleia (SS. Hermagores and Fortunatus), and Venice (88. Mark
and Theodore). The freScoes in the apse, probably dating from the days
of Poppo and Marquerd represent the Consecration of the church in the
presence of Emp. Conrad II. (above) and the 8ulrer'utgs of St. Hermagoms
(below). - The wells of the crypt, which is a relic of the original early
Dhristian church, are painted with old frescoes of various dates. Behind
a screen is an old reliquary. - The right transept contains remains of
the ehoir-sereenssof the earlier building and a column with a. capital in
the Revenue style. Adjacent is the tomb of the patriarchs of the Milan
family of Della Torre (p. 111; 1273-1365).
