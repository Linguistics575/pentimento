works as mere studies, in which he tested his powers, and whiel

A reminiscence of his earlier period, when he wrought unde

be a genuine work. Several oil-pitirtgs, portraits (e. g. the tw

careful research inclines us to attribute them to his pupils. Urr

undoubted work of Leonardo's Milan period in Italy: the Les
Supper in Santa Maria delle Grezie o. 136). Although now a. tote
wreck, it is still well calculated to convey an idea of the net
epoch of Leonardo, tsspet01ly to those who have studied Morghen'
engraving of the picture. The spectator should iirat examine th
delicate equilibrium of the composition, and observe how the in

pervades every detail, the psychological digtinetnegg of charactel
and the dramatic life, together with the calmness of the entir
bearing of the picture. He will then comprehend that with Leonard,
s new era in Italian painting was inaugurated, that the devel

The accuracy of this assertion will perhaps be doubted by th
amateur when he turns from Leonardo to Michael Angelo (1475
cm" 1564). On the one hand he hears Michael Angelo extolle.
