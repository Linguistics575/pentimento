contest. - The S. side of the piazza is occupied by the Monte di
Piste, a plain Renaissance building begun in 1484; the E. half,
with a handsome loggie, was erected in 1597 by Pier Maria Bag-
nadore.

To the SE. of the Piazza del Comune is the Muomo Nuovo
(Pl. 0, 3), a handsome church begun in 1604 by Giov. Batt.Lantana

by the sacristan of the Duomo Nuovo). This massive dome-gtrue-
ture (of the 10th cent. t) is circular, as its name imports, with an
ambulatory, and rests on eight short pillars in the interior. Beneath
is the crypt, or Basilica di San Filaatra (now lighted by electricity),
supported by 42 eolumna. This represents an early- Christian
basilica, the ground-plan of which was probably followed in the
curious old addition on the E. side of the church, consisting of a
