though his oil-paintings ere distributed throughout the galleries of Europe,
several of his most striking works, ehitstV religious compositions, are
still reserved at Venice.

ueh was the vitality and vigour and so great were the reaourceo of
the Venetian School, that even muters of secondary rank fre uently pro-
duced works of the highest excellence. There is frequently ut little to
choose between them in their skill in using colour. Foremost among
them are Bebaauano del Rambo (1486-1547), who afterwards yielded to the
fascinating Ltthusnee of Michael Angelo, Rocco Harcom', the dreamy Lormo
Lotto (1480-1666), Bonifau'o 1. ('Bon. dd Nah", or'Bon. Treronere't comp. p. 1flk
'of whose life little is yet known, Giovanni Antonio (da) Pordenone (1
1539), whose tlegit-ttnts are unsurpueed, and Part: Bordone (1500-71),
whose portraits rival those of Titian. To a younger generation belongs
Jacopo 2% toretto (RoNati, 1519-94), who squandered excellent abilities on
superficial works (Veeari calls him HI pin terribile cervello, che ebbie
avuto mai la pittnra'), and In his eegernese for tstreet lost the golden tints
of his school. Paolo CdWiri, eurnamed Verona: (1528-88), on the other
hand, though more realistic, maintains the best traditions of his school. Last
among the masters of note were the Banano': (p. 258), Palma Giovane, and
Padovam'no. To the 18th cent. belong tNor. Batt: Tie olo (ea. 1698-1770),
a spirited decomtive artist, Antonio Canale (1697-17, an architectural
painter, end his pupil Bern. Belotto (1724-8) ), both summed Canaletto, all
much admired by their contemporaries.

Visitors to Venice should he provided with'Life on the Legoona,

- and edit., London, 1894), by Horatio F. Brown, an excellent little book,

which furnishes answers to most of the questions about Venice that eug-
geat themselves to the intelligent visitOr. The same author's'Veniee: an
Hutorieal Sketch of the Republic' (1893) end'Venetien Studies' (1887) are
also recommended. It is, of course, well to be familiar with RuNsu'8tones
of Venice', or at least with the'Introductory Chapters and Local Indices,
printed separately for the use of travellers' (in 2 octavo vole.; 1881). His
'St. lark'a Beet, the History of Venice written for the help of the few
travellers who still care for her Monumenta' is tuned in the seine form
as the better-known'Mornings in Florence'. The Neniee' of Mr. J. th
Hare (8rd edit, 1891) is an interesting and convenient manual; the
'Trenestitut Life' of Mr, W. D. Howell: is One of the most charming books
of its kind. Bernhard Berenson':'Venetian Painters of the Renaissance,
with an index to their workg' (i890, will be found useful by the art-
lover. The Rev. Dr. Alex. Robertson's'Fre Paolo Barpt' (2nd edit., 1894)
deals with a critical epoch of Venetian history, and his'Bible of St. Mark,
the Altar and Throne of Venice' deals exhaustively with the history,
mosaics; and sculptures of St. Mark's Church. See also the'Renaissance
in Italy, by J. A. Symonds;'venice', by the Hon. Alcthea Wm ('Story of
the Nation's Beriee'; 1894);'The Makers of Venice' by Era. Oltpham; and
'T5gsatiests' by-Granl Allen Historical Guides series). - Mr. Ruskin advises
the traveller who is fan ot paintings to devote his principal attention'to
the warke of Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and John Bellini; not of course
neglecting Titian, yet remembering that Titian can be well and thoroughly
studied in almost any reat European gallery while Tintoret and Bellini
can be judged of only in Veniee, and Paul eronese.... ie not to be
full eatimeted until he is seen at play among the fantastic ehequere of
the enetien ceilings'.
