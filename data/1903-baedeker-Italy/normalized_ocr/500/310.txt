Stresa (690 ft.), cooler and more breezy than the other places on
the lake, occupies a picturesque and attractive situation, with the
country-houses of many of the Italian noblesse, and is a suitable
spot for a lengthened May during the summer months. The Villa
Ducalc, adjoining the Alb. Milano on the W., belongs to the Duch-
ess of Genoa, and the new building in the park belongs to her son
the Duke of Genoa. - About 10 min. above the village, to the S.
(reached by ascending from the Alb. Reale), stands the Collegto
Roamim' (875 ft.), a Rosminian seminary. The church contains the
monument of the philosopher and statesman Ant. Rosmini (1797-
1855) with an admirable recumbent figure by Vela. The front of
the church commands a beautiful view of Pallanza, Intra, and the
islands. - Above the lake, 1/2 M. to the S.E., is the beautifully
situated Villa Patlatrieino, and 1/4 M. farther on is the Villa Vignb'lo,
both with tine gardens (visitors admitted).
