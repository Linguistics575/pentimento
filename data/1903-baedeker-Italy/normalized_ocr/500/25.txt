IV. Passports. Custom House, Luggage.

Passports, though not required in Italy, are oeossionslly useful.
Registered letters, for example, will not he delivered to strangers,
unless they exhibit a passport to prove their identity. The count-
enance and help of the English and American consuls can, of course,
be extended to those persons only who can prove their nationality.
The Italian police authorities are generally civil and obliging.

Foreign Office passports may be obtained through 0. Smith a Son,
63 Charing Cross, Buss, MO West Strand, W. J. Adams, tig Fleet Street,
or the usual tourist agents (Cook, Gaze, eta); charge 2nt sgent's fee u. 6d.

Custom House. The examination ot luggage at the Italian
frontier railway-tstations is generally lenient, but complaints are
sometimes made as to a deheieney of ofilttia1 courtesy at diligence
and steamer stations. Tobacco and cigars (only six pass free), playing
cards, and matches are the articles ehietly sought for. A duty of
30 e. per kilogramme (2t/elU) is levied on unexposed photograph
plates. The custom-house receipts should be preserved, as travellers
are sometimes challenged by the excise offleiah, In the interior. At
the gates of most of the Italian towns a tax (dasio comma) is levied
on comestibles, but trawsllers' luggage is passed at the barriers (limite
dasiario) on a simple declaration that It contains no such articles.

Luggage. If possible, luggage should never be sent to Italy
by goods-train, as it is liable to damage, pilferage,' and undue
custom-house detention. If the traveller is obliged to forward it in
this way, he should employ a trustworthy agent at the frontier and
send him the keys. As a rule it is advisable, and often in the end
less expensive' never to part from one's luggage, and to super-
intend the custom-house examination in person. (comp. p. xviii).

V. Public Safety. Beggars.
Public Safety in Northern Italy is on as stable a footing as to the
N. of the Alps. Travellers will naturally avoid lonely quarters
after night-fall, just "they would at home. The policeman in the
town is called Guardia; the gendarme In the country, Carabiniere
(black coat with red facings and cooked hat). No one may carry
weapons without a licence, on pain of imprisonment. Armi im-
