Pistoja (210 ft.), a pleasant town with 65,412 inheb. (incl. the
suburbs), is situated in the vicinity of the Ombrone, a small tributary
of the Arno, at the junction of the Iitsghorn-1r1orenee and Bologne-
Florence (R. 52) rai1way-lines. It has broad, well-built streets, end
important manufactories of guns and iron-ware. Pistols are exid to
have been invented at Pistoja, "and thence to derive their name.

Pietoja, the Roman Pistoria, near which Cetiline was defeated end
slain, B.C. 62, was in the middle ages the centre of the ilereeat struggles
between the Guelphe and Ghibellinee. In the year 1300 the thmeettieri
and Panciatichi, or Black and White parties, mentioned by Dante (Inferno.
xxiv. 143), who afterwards extended their intrigues to Florence and in-
flaeneed the fertunee of the feet himself, were formed here. Piataia had
to surrender to Florence in 351. It was the birthplace of the cele rated
jurist and poet Gino Sinibaldt' (1270-1338), a. friend of Dante, and of the
satirist Niccolo Forteguerra (16744785), author of the Rieeiardetto.

In the Hle'romr or ART, Pietoje, which eomewhet resembles Florence
in miniature, held an important rank In the early part of the middle
ages, and was foremost among the Tuscan republics in fostering artistic
progress. The older churches, such as the Cathedral and Saar Andrea,
exhibit a leaning to the Pisan style, which was extensively in vogue in

the 12th century. At Pistcja. we also meet with many of the earliest "I

tempts at sculpture in Tuscany, which are much ruder than contem-
poreneoue German and French works of the name kind, and with several
of the names of the oldest artiste (Gmamom and Adeodauu). After the
14th cent. Pieto'a became dependent on Florence both politically end in
the province 0 art. The town continued to be wealthy and embitious
enough to petroniee artiste, but thenceforth those of Florence were always
employed. Of the Galdtmith's Art we have an Important specimen in the
silver altar In the Cathedral.
