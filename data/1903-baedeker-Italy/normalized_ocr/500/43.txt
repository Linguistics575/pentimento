xxxii ITALIAN ART.

... criminate confusion of Greek and Roman styles is no longer to be
GnEEK AND apprehended. We are now well aware that the highest per-
Ronm fection of ancient architecture is realised in the HELLENIC
STYLES DIS- temple alone. The Dorie order, in which majestic gravity is
'rtr.t" m'meD. expressed by massive proportions and by a symmetrical de-
coration, which at the same time subserves a practical purpose,
and the Ionic structure, with its lighter and more graceful char-
acter, exhibit a creative spirit entirely different from that mani-.
fested in the sumptuous Roman edifleeg. Again, the most valuable
collection of ancient sculptures in Italy ig incapable of aitording so
admirable an insight into the development of Greek art as the sculp-
tures ot the Parthenon and other fragments of Greek ttsmpltr-arehi-
teeture preserved in the British Museum. But, while instruction is
afforded more abundantly by other than Italian sources, ancient art
is perhaps thoroughly admired in Italy alone, where works of art
encounter the eye with more appropriate adjuncts, and where climate,
scenery, and people materially contribute to intensify their impres-
siveness. An additional facility, moreover, is afforded by the circum-
stance, that in accordance with an admirable custom of classic
antiquity the once perfected type of a. plastic Arure was not again
arbitrarily abandoned, but rigidly adhered to, and continually re-
produced. Thus in numerous cases, where the more ancient Greek
original had been lost, it was preserved in subsequent copies; and
even in the works of the Roman imperial age Hellenic creative talent
is still reflected.
This supremacy of Greek intellect in Italy was established in a
Gim me twofold manner. In the ilrtst place Greek colonists intro-
wpnnn m duced their ancient native style into their new homes. This
har. is proved by the existence of several Doric temples in Sicily,
by the go-called Temple pf Neptune at Paestum, "well "by the
ruins "Metapontum. But, in the second place, the art of the Greeks
did not attain its universal supremacy in Italy till a later period,
when Hellas, nationally mined, had learned to obey the dictates of
her mighty conqueror, and the Romans had begun to combine with
their political superiority the rMnemtyntg of more advanced culture.
The ancient scenes of-artistic activity in Greece (Athens for example)
became re-people-il at the coat of Rome; Greek works of art and
Greek artists were in trodueed into Italy; and ostentatious pride in
the magnificence of booty acquired by victory led by an easy transi-
tion to a taste for such objects. To surround themselves with artistic
decoration thus gradually became the universal custom of the Ro-
mans, and the foundation of public monuments came to be regarded
es an indispensable duty of government..
Although the Roman works of art of the imperial epoch ere-
Bonn deficient in originality compared with the Greek, yet their
Ancmnc- authors never degenerate into more copyiets, or entirely re-
TURB. nounce independent teffort. This remark applies especially to
