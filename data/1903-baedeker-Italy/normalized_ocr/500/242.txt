a fine covered court, by L. Broggi (1899-1901). Facing the Via
Dante, on the N.W. side of the Piazza, is a bronze statue (by Luigi
Secchi; 1899) of Gius. Parini (1729-99), author of the satiric poem
'll Giorno'.

From the Piazza Cordusis a new series of streets leads, in a direct
line to the Castello. The flrgt part of this thoroughfare is the wide
and handsome FL DAN'rn (Pl. D, 5, 4; electric tramways Nos. 3 & 4,
see p. 113), which is continued, beyond the Foro Bonaparte, by the
Via Cair√©li (P1. D, 4). In the Foro Bonaparte is a bronze Equestrian
Statue of Garibaldi, by Ettore Ximenes (1895). The allegorical
female figures' on the pedestal represent Revolution and Liberty.

The I" csmtello 8forzesco (Pl. c, 3, o, the castle of Milan, was
originally built as the Castello dt Porta Giovia by Galeazzo 11. Via-
conti (1355-78), on the city-wall, adjoining the old Ports Gioiria.
It was destroyed by the Ambrosian Republic (p. Iii) in 1447, but
was rebuilt and enlarged by the Sforza after 1460. In 1893 et seq.
it Was restored in the 15th cent. style from the plans of Luca
Beltramt, and it now contains the municipal art-eollections. The
rectangular building, defended by four torner-turretg and a curtain
wall, comprises a large Anterior Court and two castles or palaces:
the Rocchctta, built by Franc. Sforza on the foundations of the Vis-
conti castle, and the Corte Ducale. Each of these, in turn, encloses

a smaller court.

The old Viseonti castle seems to have been built by Galeazzo 11., not
only as e bulwark against external foes but to protect the W. quarters of
the town against Bernebb Visconti, who had begun about 1888 to erect a
new castle on the site of the 1present Ospedale Maggiore (p. Ido), in addition
to the Pnlazzo di Corte (p. 20) Under Filippo Maria its main function

people to rebuild the stronghold that they had but a few years before
raeed to the ground amid universal jubilation. The forbidding character
of the structure was somewhat modified by the elegant tower-gateway
erected by Filareu in 1452-54 0n the side next the town. This, however,
was destroyed by an explosion of gunpowder in 1521. Behind the Castello
lay an extensive deer-park. Galeazzo Maria began to fit up both the palaces
with great luxury, and in 1477 Bona a Savoia, his widow, erected the
tower named after her at the E. angle of the Rocchetta. Lodorieo a Moro
emulated the artistic zeal of his brother, and Bramante and leonardo dd Wad

for the rebuilding of the main fagude was never executed.

An abrupt end was put to this brilliant period by the French invasion.
In 1552-70 the castle was surrounded with six bastions and separated from
the new town-walls (p. 116) by a broad moat. Throughout the Spanish
and Austrian domination it formed the focus of all the struggles tor the
possession of Lombardy. The republican movement of 1798 incited the
Milanese to a repetition of the events of 1447, but it was not till 1
