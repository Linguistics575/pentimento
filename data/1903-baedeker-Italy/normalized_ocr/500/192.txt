Ohmte. San Remo is sheltered by an unbroken semicircular hill
rising from the Capo Nero to the Piano Carparo (3000 no, culminating
in the Monte Gaggio (3576 ft.) and Monte Bianca: (4260 ft.), and descend-
ing thence to the Capo Verde, its summit being nowhere more than 4 M.
distant in a strai ht line. The N. winds are therefore entirely excluded
from this favoure spot, especially as a. iGih reuse a Alps rises behind
the town a. little farther back, while the force of the B. and W. winds
ismnch broken. Violent E. winds, however, frequently occur at the end
of February and the beginning of March, and the'lkigtrB1' is also an un-
welcome visitor at this season. - To consumptive and bronchial patients
the E. bay is recommended on account of its sheltered situation and humid
atmosphere while tsufferers from nervous and liver complaints will tind
the dry anti stimulating air of the W. bay more btrnethsits1. - The mean
temperature of the three winter months ia bio mar.

San Remo,' town of 20,0271nhab., lies in the middle of'
beautiful bay, 61/, M. long, embosomed in olive-grovee that cover
tU valleys and lower slopes and give place higher up to pines and
other coniferaa. It has been a health-resort since 1861.

The crowded houses of the old town occupy a steep hill be-
tween the short valleys of the Torrents del Convento and the Tor-
rente di San Romolo. A smaller quarter named Castigliuoli lies to
the W. of the latter stream. These older parts of the town consist
of t curious labyrinth of narrow lanes, flights of steps, erehweye,
lofty and sombre houses, and mouldering walls. The arches which
connect the houses high above the streets are intended to give them
stability in case of earthquakes. Vines are frequently seen clam-
bering up the houses and putting forth their tendrils and leaves
on the topmost stories.

The new town, occupying the alluvial land at the foot of the
hill, contains all the public buildings. The long Via Vittorio Ema-
nuele (P1. 0, D, 3), with its numerous shops, is the chief centre of
tafik. To the S.E. is the fort of Santa chla (Pl. D, 3, 4; now a.
Prison), constructed by the Geneese to defend the smell harbour,
Which is sheltered by a. tsielr1e-ishapei1 Bmxwunn 1300 ft. in
1eIlgth. A survey from the parapet of this M010 will convey an idea
0f the sheltered position of San Remo.
