200 Route 3d. BRESCIA. Munictpio.

Brescia (460 ft.), capital of a province and see of a bishop,
with 69,210-inhab., is beautifully situated at the foot of the Alps,
and its numerous fountains of limpid water lend it an additional
charm. Iron wares, and particularly weapons, form the staple com-
modities, many of the f1re-armt, used by the Italian army being made
here. The woollen, linen, and isil1Cfaetoritst, also deserve mention.

Brescia, the ancient Celtic BAria, afterwards a Roman colany, was
from 1167 one of the most active members of the tsonfederation of Lom-
bard towns. In 1268 it fell into the hands pf Ezulino (p. 223) and it
afterwards belonged successively to the Scaligers of Verona, the Viseonti
of Milan (1421-26), and the Venetians. It vied with Milan at the beginning
of the 16th cent. as one of the wealthiest cities of Lombardy, but in
1512 was sacked and burned by the French under Gaston de Feta: R; 395)
after an obstinate defence. Five years later it was restored to eniee,
to which it belonged till 1797, but It. has never recovered its ancient
importance. After the. unsuccessful revolt of 1818, Brescia- alone of all the
Lombard towns rallied, under the youthful Tito Bperi, to Charles Albert's
renewed attempt in 1849:, but it was bombarded by the Austrians under
Haynau and after ten days of obstinate tstreet-fighting was taken on
April 2nd. - Arnold of Brescia, a pupil of Abélerd, was one of the most
prominent leaders of the reforming movement in Italy in the middle ages;
he attacked the secular power and wealth of the clergy, and after being
excommunicated by Hadrian IV. was executed inf1lili.

Brescia is noteworthy in the history of art as the birthplace of
Alessandro Bonvtct'no, mrnamed t1 Moreno t1t98-ilBl5J, who appears to have
studied exclusively at his native place, and whose teacher is said to have
been Floriano Ferramola of Brescia. He has been classed with the Venetisn
school, but erroneously, for nearly all the schools of the'Terra Ferm'
have had an independent development; and, like the Veronese masterlt
he is distinguished from that school by the comparative soberness of
his colouring ('subdued silvery tone'), although he vies with the Ven-
etians in richness and briliitrmsy, while he sometimes reveals a full measure
of the ideality of the golden period of art. Bonvicino began his career
as a painter in his 18th year. He rarely extended the sphere of his labours
beyond his native place, and Brescia is therefore abundantly stored with
his works. The churches here (such as San Clemente, p. 2010 display his
fertility, both as a. painter'al fresco' and in oils, forming uite a museum
of his pictures. San Giovanni 1ihrtrngelitrtts (p. 205), Santi unto e Celso
(p. 205), and the Galleria Mertinengo (p. 20403.11 contain admirable specimens
of his powers. Among Moretto'g pupils was Giov. Bait. Aforoné (ca. 1523-78),
one of the best portrait-painters of the Renaissance. Another eminent
master of Brescia, a contemporary of Bonvicino, was Girol. Romanino
(1485-1566); his best works are to be seen in San.Frsneesco (p. 206), San
Giov. 1ilvtsngeliMa (p. 2010, and at Padua. - Brescis. also contains several
nteresting antiquities o, 202).

The centre of the town is the picturesque PuzzA DEL Conuxn
(formerly Piazza Vecchia), in which rises the *Hunioipio (P1. 14;
B, C, 2), usually called La Loggia, begun in the oarlg-Remsitnsaruas
style by Tomm. Fromentone of Vieenza. in 1492, bat uni1nitshed
until Jacopo Sansovino completed the upper part in 1554-74. The
window-moldings are by Palladio (1562). The large saloon on the
upper story and the lofty vaulted roof were destroyed by a fire In
1575. The exterior of this magnimsent structure is almost overladen
with ornamentation, including a charming'putto' frieze by 8amto-
vino. On the groundt1oor is a deep eolonnade; In front are pillars
and pilasters. The upper floor recedes considerably. The building
is now being restored, and it is said that the i1isriigrlring octagonal
