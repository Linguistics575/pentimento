"ariviii l ITALIAN ART.

properly 1haoBtoo (Cappcua del Santa) flourished. At Venice the Be.
naissance culminated in the first half of the 16th cent. in the work:
of the Florentine JAOOPO Smsovmo (properly TATTI, 1486-1570).
and at Genoa in those of Gmuzo ALBeer (1500-1672) of Perngie
(e.g. Santa. Maria di Carignano).
In the middle and latter half of the 16th cent, Venice, Gama,
Ascm- and Viccnw were zealous patrons of art. To this period
uc-runx AT belongs ANDREA Pummo of Vicenza (1518-80; p. 243),
VEtauu. the last of the great Renaissance architects, whose Venetian
churches (San Giorgio Maggiore and Redentore) and Vicentine palaces
are equally celebrated. The fundamental type of domestic archi-
tecture u Venice recurs with little variation. The nature of the
ground afforded little scope for the ceprice of the architect,
while the conservative spirit of the inhabitants inclined them to
adhere to the style established by custom. Nice distinctions of style
are therefore the more observable, and that which emanated from
u pure sense of form the more appreciable. Those who have been
convinced by careful comparison of the great superiority of the
Bihlioteea of Sansovino (in the Piazzetta; p. 275) over the new
Proeurasie of Scamoui (p. 271), although the two tsditigeg exactly
correspond in many respeetis, have made great progress towards an
accurate insight into the architecture of the Renaissance.
Much, however, would be lost by the traveller who devoted his
Mmon attention exclusively to the master-works which have been
Woaxa or extolled from time immemorial, or sso1tsly to the great mon-
Algl. umental structures. As even the inisigniitetmt vases (ma-
jolicas, manufactured at Pesaro, Urbiuo, Gubbio, Feenza, and
Castel-Durante) testify to the taste of the Italians, their partiality
for classical models, and their enthusiasm for purity of form, so
also in interior works, some of which fall within the province of a
mere handicraft, the peculiar beauties of the Renaissance style ere
often detected, and charming specimens of architecture are some-
times discovered in remote corners of Italian towns. Nor must the
vast domain of decorative sculpture be disregarded, as such works,
whether in metal, stone, or stucco, inlaid 0r carved wood (intaraiag,
often verge on the sphere of architecture in their designs, drawing,
and style of enrichment..,
On the whole it may be asserted that the architecture of the Re-
naissance, which in obedience to the requirements of modern life
scum"; manifests its greatest excellence in secular structgree, cannot
or run Ihr. fail to gratify the taste of the most su1periieial observer.
'" P"'""h With the sculpture of the same period, however, the case is
different. The Italian architecture of the 15th and 16th centuries
still possesses a practical value and is frequently imitated at-the
present day; and painting undoubtedly attained its highest eon-
summation at the same period; but the sculpture of the Rennie;
sance does not appear to us worthy of reviyal, and indeed cannot
