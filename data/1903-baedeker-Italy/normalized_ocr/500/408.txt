Madonna dew Arena. PA DUA. do. Route. 255

The Eremitani (P1. D, 3), an old Augustine church of the
middle of the 13th cent., restored in 1880, is a long building with
printed vaulting of wood, containing"Freseoes by Andrea Man-
tegna and his contemporaries of the school of Seuareione, which
are among the most important examples of Northern Italian art.

By the entrance-wall are two painted altars of terracotta, probably by
Giov. MneIlo, that to the right with a fresco of 1611. On the right and
left are the elaborate Gothic tombs of Uberttno "Cerrare (1838-45) and
hreopo (i1 Minors) da Carrara (1345-50), by Andriolo dai Bantt' of Venice,
brought hither from the church of Sant' Agostino (pulled down in 1820).
In the centre of the left wall is the tomb of the jurist Benavides (( 1.1582),
by the Florentine B. Ammanati.

0n the walls of the ihrom are poor frescoes, ascribed to t7uariento..
Astronomical representations, Scenes from the life of St. Augustine (re-
painted), etc. - In the chapel to the right of the high-altar: Guariento O,
Coronation of the Virgin. - Swmsrr (entrance from the choir, to the
left): Guido Rem', John the Baptist. _

The CAPPELLA SANT! Jacopo It Curaxorosur, adjoining the right trensept,
is embellished with celebrated frescoes, now damaged, yet still very at-
tractive, with ornamentation showing the indebtedness of the School of
Squarcione to its study of the antique. The Evangelists on the ceiling are
the poorest, and probably the earliest part of the work. The four upper
sections on the well on the right are also by inferior artists-, the two
highest scenes, representing St. J smes as s. worker of miracles, and St. J emes
befo're the king, are by an unknown muster (Marco Zappa U; the St.
Christopher with the Infant Christ is by Bono of Ferrara; the adoration
of the giant saint (central section on the right) is by Amm'no da For". The
paintings on the wall and vaulting of the recesses of the choir are by Nie.
told Pinata, an able Paduen, who died young. By far the most important
are the'Pietures with which Andrea Mantegna completed the cycle be-
tween 1153 and 1469. The left wall presents to us the life of St. James
from his cell to his execution. The lower scenes exhibit greater ability
and maturity than the upper, so that We can almost trace the maaterhs
progress step by step. The Execution and Burial of St. Christopher, the
lowest pictures 0n the right well, subsequently added by Mantegna, are
sadly injured. - The large terracotta tr1tai-relief of the Madonna and saints
is by Giov. da Pita, a pupil of Donatello o. 248), but has been spoiled by
a modern coat of paint.

On the N. side of the piazza in front of the church is the
entrance (h battlemented iron gate; if closed, ring; adm. 9-4, 1 fr.;
holidays 9-2, 20 0.; on certain high festivals, free) to the -

Madonna. dell' Arena (Pl. D, 3), situated in an oval garden
which shows the outlines of an ancient amphitheatre. The chapel,
oblong in form, was erected by Ã©lerovegno in 1303. Its walls and
vaulting are completely covered with a series of *'Frescoes by
Giotto, most of them well preserved (restored by Betti). The period
of their execution is determined by the fact that Dante and Giotto
met at Padua in 1306 (comp. pp. xl et seq.). Morning-light best.
Catalogues are provided for the use of visitors.

These frescoes represent the Blame: or ran Tmam AND Cnms'r, from
.the apocryphal Proto-Evangelium and the New Testament and end, accord-
mg to ancient custom, with the LAST JUDGMENT, iririiii1 0n the entrance
wall. The lower part of this last work, much injured, was probably exe-
cated chiefly by Giotto's pupils, but the master-hand is revealed in the
youthful Christ at the top, surrounded by apostles, angels, and saints.

The Paintings on the side-walls are arranged in four rows, one above
another. The Urrmmosw Row (beginning to the right of the ehoir-ave10
