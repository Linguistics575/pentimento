24 PIEDMONT.

The Iils'romr of the country is closely interwoven with that of its
dynasty. The House of Savoy (or Gaza Sabauda), a family of German
origin, professing even to trace their descent from the Saxon Duke
Wittekind, the opponent of Charlemagne, firgt became conspicuous among
the nobles of Upper Burgundy about the year 1000. Humbert I. t'Bian-
camano'; d. 1056) is generally regarded as the founder of the dynasty.
HU descendants, by judiciously espOusing the cause of the pope and the
emperor alternately, gradually succeeded in extending their supremacy
over Turin, Aosta, Susa, lvree, and Nice. Amadeus TU. (1343-83), known
as the'Conte Verde' ('grcen oount') from his usual dress extended the
power of his house in numerous feuds and warred in the East. Amo.
deus VIII., raised to the ducal dignity by Bmp. Sigismund in 1416, added
Geneva, Vercelli, and Piedmont to his possessions, and gave the princi-
pality its first legislative code. He retired to ehermitage at Ripaille, near
Thonon, in 1434, but was created pope es Fem: Ir. (1439-49) by the Council
of Bssle and died in 1151. - Situated between the two great medieval
powers of France on one side, and Austria and Spain on the other, the
princes of Savoy frequently changed sides, and although sometimes over-
taken by terrible disasters, they contrived to maintain, and even to extend,
their territory. At one period the greater part of the Dneh was annexed
to France, but Emmanuel Philibert ('Testa di Irerro', 1553- restored it
to its original extent, and became its second founder. This rince spent
25 years as a general in the service of Charles V, and won t e battle of
St. Quentin for Philip II. Under his son Charles Emmanuel I. (1530-1630)
the Duchy again became dependent on FranCe. From the sons of this
grincc are descended the elder branch of the family, which became extinct
n 1831, and the younger Csrignano line, which succeeded to the throne
in the person of Carlo Alberto. The following dukes were Vittorio Amedeo f.
(1630-37), Francesco Giacz'nto (1637-38), Carlo Emanuele 11. (1638-75), and
T'ittorio.Atnedeo II. (1675-1780). The last of these, having boldly allied him-
self with Austria during the S anish War of Succession, managed to throw
off the French suzerainty (170 J; he obtained Sicily as his reward, which
island, hdwever, he was afterwards obliged to exchange for Sardinia (1720),
and in 1713 assumed the title of KING, which was subsequently coupled
with the name of the latter island. His successors were Carlo Emanuele III.
(1730-73), and Vittorio Amedeo 111. (1773-96). After the battle of Turin
(1706), in which Prin√©e Eugene commanded the Imperialists, the Piedmont-
ese princes directed their attention to Prussia, which served as a model
for the organisation of their kingdom. In both countries the military
and feudal element prepouderated, and both were obliged to succumb
to the new powers evolved by the French Revolution. Carlo Emanuele I V.
(1796-1802) was deprived of all his continental possessions by the French
in 1798, and restricted to the island of Sardinia, which was protected
by the English fleet. Vittorio Emanuele A (1802-21) was at length rein-
stated in his dominions, with the addition of Genoa, by the Congress of
Vienna. The Napoleonic period had swept away the feudal institutions
of Piedmont, and had bequeathed in their Mead many of the bentsBte of
modern legislation, and high military renown. n is therefore Intelligible
that the clerical reaction, which set in with the kinghs return, gave rise
to an insurrection which caused the king to abdicate, and had to be
queued by Austrian troops. His brother Carlo Felice (1821-81) adhered
faithfully to Jesuitical principles, and lived on the whole in accordance
with his motto,'Non sono re per essere seccato' ('worried0. The older
line of the House of Savoy became extinct with this 2grinee, and was
succeeded by the collateral line of Carignano (p. hir, th April, 1881).
Carlo Alberto (b. 1798) who had been educated at a French military
school, and had Liiiriil the insurrection of 1821, was protected by France
and Russia. against the attempts of Austria to deprive him of his claims
to the throne. His own experiences, and the force of circumstances,
rendered him an implacable enemy of Austria. With him began the
national development of Piedmont, although his etforta were not always
cunsistent. The liberals called him the'Re Tenionna' (the vacillating),
while in 1813 he himself described his position as being'between the
