An earlier silver altar was plundered in 1295 by Vanni Fueei, for which
crime Dante gives him s place in the Inferno (m 124 et seq.).

The Curr, borne by six columns, is i'GiGiiiiiii.

The eampanile was originally a fortified tower (13th cent.),
called Torre del Podesth, and still bears the arms of governors of
the town. The three series of arches were added in Plan fashion
when the tower was adapted to its present purpose.

Opposite the cathedral is the octagonal'Battistero (San tho-
vanni Battista; Pl. 1), erected after 1339 by Cellino di Neat in the
Italian-Gothic style, according to Vasari from a design try Andrea
Pisano. On the exterior is a pulpit. The principal portal hes a flm,
wooden door. The large square font is embellished with richly-
decorated Slabs from the old pulpit (1199) of the cathedral.

Adjacent is the *Palazzo Pretoria (PI. 12), formerly Pal. dd
Podotit, a Gothic building of the 14th cent., with a modern upper
story. It now contains the courts of justice. The picturesque
'Quadrangle is enclosed by four round arches resting upon piers,
the arcades and the facade are adorned with numerous painted ar-
mortal bearings of the Podeisa's, remarkable for their admirable
heraldic style, restored in 1844. To the left of the entrance are the
stone table and seats of the ancient tribunal, bearing the inscrip-

1294-1385, with a vestibule. The black marble head near the
middle window, is said to represent Filippo Tediei, who sought to
betray the city to Castrmmio (p. 416). The large hall upstairs con-
