the traveller in the N. part of the country will rarely guffer from this
short-coming even in hotels of the second class, though those who

Emmi) or camphor somewhat repels their advances.

The'atuiire, or mosquitoes, are e source of great annoyance, and often

lentils, Ferrara, Ravenna), where the female of the Anopheles Olaoiger

be mefnlly closed before a light is introduced into the mom. Light muslin
curtains (zanzariers') round the beds, masks for the face, and oves are
