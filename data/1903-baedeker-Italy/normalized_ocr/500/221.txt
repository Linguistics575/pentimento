110 LOMBABDY.

The name of the Germanic tribe that invaded Italy in NB is now
applied to the country between the Alps and the Po, which is separated
from Piedmont by the thino, end from Venetia by the Iincio. It in
divided into the eight provinces of Como Huano, Pavia, Sondn'o, Ber-
gamo, Cremona, Brescia, and Kantova, cove "an area of about 8000 MI. IL,
and containing 3,718,300 inhabitants. The name was Once applied to a
much larger tract. Lombardy hes not ina tly been likened to an
artichoke, the leaves of which were eaten o in succession by the lords
of Piedmont; thus in 1427 they appropriated Vercellt, in 1531 Aeti, in 1703
Val Beeia, in 1706 A1trsatuti1rits, in 1786 Tortone and Novara, and in 1743
Domodoasola. The heart of the country, if we continue to nae the
eimile, would then be the Dunner or MILAN, or the tract lying between
the Ticino, Po, and Adda. The three zones of cultivation are the same
as in Piedmont) m. the region of pastures among the mountains, that
of the vine, fruit-treee, end the ailk-culture on the lower undulating
country and the slopes adjoining the lakes, and that of wheat, maize,
and meadows in the plains, the yield of these last being, however, far
more abundant than in Piedmont. The climate of Lombardy is thoroughly
continental: winter in the plains, which are scourged by bitter winds, is
very cold (minimum at Milan, 1.4' Fahr.) and abounds in snow and mist
(in 1899 at Milan snow occurred on 18 days, mist on 50) - while in summer
the heat is greater than that of 8. Italy (maximum at hiiiii',' W' Fahr.).
la the height of summer rain is rare beyond the lower Alps, and falls
more frequently when the wind is from the E. than from the W., aathe
moisture of the letter is absorbed by the Maritime Alps and the Apenninea;
but a thorough eyetem of irrigation, without a parallel in any other part
of Europe, prevails here, so that a failure of the crops is hardly possible. In
the middle ages the importance of Milan was due to its woollen industriu,
but sheep-breeding has in modern times been largely superseded by the
tsilk-culture, an industry which has so materially increased the wealth of
the country, that it used to be said during the Austrian regime that the
army and the others lived on mulberry leaves, "their produce alone
truffietsd to pay the land taxes. Under these circumstances the population
is unusually dense, being about 380 persons to the sq. mile, or only a
little less dense than in Liguria and Campanie.

The central situation, and the wealth of the country, have ever rem
dered it an apple of discord to the difrerent European nations._ In tht
earliest period known to us it was occupied by the Etruscan, an Italian
race, which about 400 13.0 was aubjugated or expelled by Celts from tht
w. These immigrants founded Hediolanum (Milan), near the site of th,
Etruscan Melpum, destroyed in 896 MAJ. Traces of their language etil
survive in the modern dialect of the country, as it does in the dialect
of Piedmont and Emilia. It was but slowly that the Italians subdued o
assimilated these foreigners, and it was not till B.C. 222 that the Roman
extended their supremacy to the banks of the Po by their victory a

Of Northern Italy formed the chief buttress of the power of Rome. Won
the 4th cent. on Milan surpassed Rome in extent, and, in many respects
in importance also. It became an imperial residence, and the ehurd
founded here by St. Ambrosius (who was bishop of Milan in 374-97), lon
maintained its independence of the popes.

The Lombard dialect also contains a good many words derived from tht
German (thus, bran, past, are, pie, smasor, starts, and stout, from th,
German Brnnnen, Gast, Greis, Pflag, Meseer, attiren, and etoesen). Th,
crown of Lombardy was worn successively by the hanconian and by th,
German Kings, the latter of whom, particularly the Othos, did much t,
promote the prosperity of the towns. When the ru turd between tht
