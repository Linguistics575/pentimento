Albertoni, Dr. L. Gallo (d. 1857), by Vela, and Prof. Timermans
(d. 1875), by Tebacchi; and of Peseatore, the jurist, by Dini. The
University Library, now the Biblioteca Nasionale (adm., see p. 26),
was founded in 1720 by Vittorio Amadeo II.

The nucleus of the collection, which numbers over 250,0? 0 printed
vols. and 4138 MSS., consists of the former library of the house of Savoy
and some valuable MSS. from Bobbio (p. 336). There are numerous Oriental
MSS., about 400 Greek MSS. (including Theodoret's Commentary on the
Minor Prophets, with Bymn tine miniatures; 9th cent.), and 1200 Latin MSS.,
including palimpsests of Cicero and CassiodorUS, the Theodosian codex,
two Irish MSS. of the 7th cent., and Pliny's Histo: ia. 1ftrtaralit, with
miniatures of the school of Mantegna. - Among the 1095 incunabula is
the Rationale of Guglielmo Duranli, printed by Fust at Mayence in 1459.
The library contains also many Aldine editions and a copy of the great
Bible of Plantin, presented by Philip Tr. of Spain to Charles Emmanuel.
Some old plaiipg-eards (15th cent.), F r. Basso's map of the world (1570),
and about 10,000 woodcuts and engravings of various schools are also
ameng the treasures of the library.

No. 6, to the right in the Wa Aceademia Albertina, is the
Aecademia Albertina di Belle Arti (Pl. B, F, 3; adm., see p.' 26),
founded in 1652, and transferred hither In 1833. It contains a
small collection of pictures. Among the best of the older works
(many copies) are: 126. Quintcn Matsys O), Head of Christ; 140,
Mt. Irq Filippo Lippi, Four Fathers of the Church (wings of altar-
piece). Also numerous *Cartoons by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Bern.

The Via Montebello, the next erotrir-tstreet, leads to the so-called
Hole Antonelliane (Pl. F, 3; adm., see p. 27), begun in 1863
as a synagogue by Al. Antonelli (d. 1888) and completed by the city
in 1878-89. It will be fitted up as a Museo del Risorgimcnto (comp.
p. 36). It is a square building (44 yds. each way) resembling a
tower, with a singular facade formed of several rows of columns;
its height to the head of the copper statue (13 ft. high) at the top
is 538 ft. (Washington Obelisk M6 ft.). The dome is striking from
its bold disregard of the ordinary technical rules of construction.
The hall beneath the dome is 84 ft. square and upwards of 300 ft.
high, and contailis three galleries one above the other. The upper-
most gallery commands a splendid *View of the city and the Alps,
best by morning light. (Comp. the Panorama, p. 38.)

The raminent heights are: to the N., the snowy peaks of Monte
Rosa (15, 5 ft.); to the N, W., the Gran Paradiso (13,824 ft); more to the w.
is the RocciamelOne (11,604 ft.), cancealing Mt. Cents, then, to the left, the

valley of Susa (p. 40, with the Segre di San Michele (p. 3) on a conspicuous
hill; farther to the S.W. Monte Vise (12,670 ft.).

In the Via di Gaudenzio Ferrari, No. 1, is the Museo Civico or
Innieipale d'Arte Antics (Pl. F, 3; adm., see p. 27).
