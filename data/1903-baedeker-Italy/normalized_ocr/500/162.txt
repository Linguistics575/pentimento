History. GENOA. 16. Route. 71

The internal histOry of the city was no less chequered than the ex-
ternal. The ptsrty-eonfliett' between the great families of the Doria,
Spinola, Adorm', and Freaost (Ghibellines) on one side, and the Grimaldi,
'iettsltt', auarohi, and 3fontaldi (Guelphs) on the other, led to some extra..
ordinary results. The defeated party'used, at the expense of their own
independence, to invoke the aid of some foreign prince, and accordingly
we find that after the 14th cent. the kings of Naples and France, the
marquises of Montferrat, and the dukes of Milan were alternately masters
of Genoa. Nor was this Mate of affairs materially altered by the revolution
of 1339, by which the exclusive sway of the nobility wee overthrown,
and a poge, elected for life, invested with the supreme power. In the
midst of all this confusion the only stable element was the mercantile
Banco di San Giorgio, which had acquired extensive possessions, ehiefly
in Corsica, and would, perhaps, have eventually absorbed the whole of the
republic and converted it into a commercial aristocracy, had not Genoa
lost its power of independent development bg becoming involved in the
wars of the great powers. Agdrea poria (p. 1), the admiral of Emperor
Charles Tr., at length restored peace by the establishment of a new oligarohte
constitution (1628), and the unsuccessful conspiracy of Fieeco in 1647 was
one of the last instances of an attempt to make the supreme power
dependent on unbridled personal ambition. But the power of Genoa was
already on the wane. The Turks conquered its Oriental possessions one
after another, and the city was subjected to severe humiliation, by
Louis XIV. of France, whose fleet under Duquemc bombarded Genoa in
1B4, and by the Imperial troops by whom the city was occupied for
some months in 1746. These last were expelled by a. popular rising,
begun by a stone thrown by Balilla, a lad of 16 years. A revolt in Corsica,
which began in 1729 was suppressed only with the aid of the French,
who afterwards (1766) took possession of the island on their own behalf.
In i297 the aristocratic government of Genoa was superseded by the
democratic'Ligurien Republie', established by Napoleon. In 1805 Genoa
was formally annexed to the Empire of France, and in 1815 to the Kingdom
of Sardinia.

lo the student of art Genoa. offers much of interest. Some of the
smller churches are of very ancient origin, though usual ] y altered in the
Gothic period. The Renaissance palaces of the Genoeae noblesee are, on
the other hand, of the greatest im ortance, surpassing in number and
magnificence those of any other city tl Italy. Many of these palaces were
erected by Galeazzo Aleut (a. pupil of Michael Angelo, born at Perugie
W), d. 1572), whose style was followed by subsequent architects. In
spite of occasional defects, Alessi's architecture is of an imposing and
uniform character, and displays great Ingenuity In making the best of an
11nfhvourahle and limited site. The palaces, moreover, contain a consid-
erable number of works of art, while Rubens, who resided at Genoa in

, and Pan Dyck at a later period, have preserved the memory of
many members of the noblesse. The native school of art, however, never
rose to importance, and was far from being bemstlted by the zeal of its
artists in painting fagades. The chief painters were Luca Cambium (1527-85),
Bernardo Stroui, surnamed Il Cappuccino or Prete Genovese (1581-1644),
Giov. Batt. Paggi (1554-1627), Benedetto Gastiglione (1616-70), and Bartolomeo
Bueatno (1632-57).

a. The Harbour and the Adjoining Streets.

Until recently the harbour consisted solely of the Porto or inner
harbour, which was closed on the B. by the Mole Vecchio (492 yds.
long), said to have been constructed in 1134, and by the Meta Nu-.
ovo (722 yds. long), dating from the 18th century. In 1877-95,
however, very extensive additions were shade, a sum of 20 million
francs having been presented to the city for the purpose by the Mer-
