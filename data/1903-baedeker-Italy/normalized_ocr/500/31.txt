expected to dine "the table-d'hdte; otherwise the charge for rooms
is apt to be raised. The charges for meals furnished in private rooms
or "unusual times are much higher. Other'extras' are also dear.
The cuisine is a mixture of French and Italian. During the season
and at the more frequented resorts it is advisable to engage rooms
in advance, especially if arriving in the evening. It is advisable to
prepay the answer, to prevent disappointment on arrival. Gentlemen
travelling alone may leave their luggage at the station until rooms
have been secured. The charge for the use of the hotel-omnibus
from the station to the hotel is so high (1-11/2 fr. each), that it is
often cheaper to take a cab. It is also easier for those who use a cab to
proceed to anotherhotel, should they not like the rooms oirered them.

The SECOND CLASS Horns (Alberghi; in the S. districts, also Lo-
cande) are less comfortable and thoroughly Italian in their arrange-
ments. The charges are little more than one-half of the above: room
1-3, attendance 1/2, omnibus 1/2-1fr. They have no table-d'héte, but
there is generally atrattoria connected with the house, where refresh-
ments t la carte, or a dinner a preszo (iiuto, may be procured. Fair
native wines, usually on draught, are furnished in these houses at
moderate prices. Morning coffee is usually taken at a cafe and not
at the inn. It is customary to make enquiries beforehand as to the
charges for rooms, not forgetting the servizio e candela; and the
price of the dinner (if not a la carte) should also be agreed upon
(2-4 fr., with wine 21/2-41/2 fr.). These inns will often be found
convenient and economical by the voyageur en garpon, and the better
houses of this class may even be visited by ladies, when at home in
Italian; the new-comer should frequent hotels of the first class only.

Horan Gums are to be found in most of the larger towns,
with charges for rooms similar to those in the geeond-elags hotels.

As matches are rarely found in hotels, the guest should provide himself
with a sup 1y of the wax-matches tcerintO sold in the streets (1-2 boxes
1045 c.). gap is also a high-prieed'extra'.

Money or objects of value should either be carried -on the trtrve11er" s
person or_left with the landlord in exchange for a receipt.

The PENSIONS of the larger towns and resorts also receive'passing
travellers. The charge is about the same as that of the seeond-class
inns and usually includes table-wine. As, however, the price of
déjeuner is usually (though not universally) included in the tiared
daily charge, the traveller has either to saerifiee some of the beat hours
for visiting the galleries or to pay for a meal he does not consume.

For a prolonged stay in one place families will find it much,
cheaper to hire PRIVATE Aranmnms and do their own housekeep-
ing. A rent lower than that first asked for is often accepted. When
a whole suite of apartments is hired, a written contract on stamped
paper should be drawn up with the aid of someone acquainted
with the language and customs of the place (c.g. a banker), in order
that'misunderstandings' may be prevented. A payment of part of
