'Thou art the garden of the world, the home

Of 311 Art yields, and Nature can decree;
.1il'en in thy desert, what is like to thee?

Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste

More rich than other elimea' fertility,

Thy wreck a glory, _and thy ruin graced

With an immaculate charm whichcennot be defaced.

I. Travelling Expenses. Money.

Expenses. The cost of a tour in Italy depends, of course, on the
trave11er's'resources and habits, but, as a rule, it need not exceed
that incurred in other 1m1eh-fregmsnted parts of the comment. The
average expenditure of a single traveller, apart from railway-fares,
may be estimated at 15-25 francs per day, or "10-20 francs when
a prolonged stay is made at one place; but persons acquainted with
the language and habits of the country may easily restrict their ex-
penses to still narrower limits. Those who travel as members of a
party effect a considerable saving by sharing the expense of guides,
carriages, and other items. When ladies are of the party, the ex-
penses are generally greater.

Money. The French monetary system is now in use throughout
the whole of Italy. The franc (lira or franco) contains 100 eenteaimi,
ltr. 25 c. == 1 a. (comp. p. ii). In copper (bronzo or rams) there are
coins of 1, 2, 5, and 10 centeaimi, and in nickel pieces of 20 and
M) o. In silver there are pieces of i, 2, and 5 fr., but coins issued
before 1863 are refused. The gold coins (10, 20, 50, and 100 fr.)
have disappeared entirely from circulation, their place being taken
by Biglictti di Stato (treasury-notes) of 5, io, and 26 fr., and the
banknotes of the Banca dUtalia. All other banknotes should be
refused .--- A11 foreign silver and. cepper coins should also be refused,
