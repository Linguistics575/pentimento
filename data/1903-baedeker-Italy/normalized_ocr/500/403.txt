the two Piazzas rises the Palazzo delta Regions (P1. c, k), briefly
called the Salone, a'Juris Basilica' as the inscription records,
erected in 1172-1219. The logge were added in 1306. The name
'Sa1one' it derives from its great Hall on the upper floor, formed
in 1420. Entrance, Via. del Municipio (by the Iron gate to the
left); fee 1/2 fr..

The Great Hall, with vaulted wooden ceiling,'is 91 yds. in lenglh,
30 yds. in breadth, and 95 ft. in height. By the entrance-wall are two
colossal Egyptian statues of Neith, and the'Petrone' or'Pietra del Vitupero'
(lapis vituper'iz' et cessz'om's bonorum), a kind of stone pillory on which ie
faulting debtors were exposed to the jeers of the populace in the market-
place. The hall also contains a wooden model of Donatello', horse in the
monument of Gattamelata (copied from the ancient horses of St. Mark's
at Venice, p. 272). Behind the horse is the tombstone of T. Livins Halya,
a freedman of the family of the historian Livy (p. 352). The walls are
adorned with 300 frescoes, painted after 1420 by Giov. Mireuo and others
(much retouched), representing the influenee of the constellations and the
seasons on mankind. - The logge contain Roman inscriptions and other
antiquities.

Adjacent, in the Puzu mam' UNIT"; dTrAzax (formerly P. de'
Signori; Pl. tl, 4), rises the Loggia del Consiglio, a fine early-Re-
naissance work of 1493, consisting of an open arcade above a. broad
flight of steps, and containing a. statue of Victor Emmanuel II. by
Tabacchi. The interior, by Biagio Rossetti, was not completed until
1523-26. In front stands an ancient Column with the Lion of St,
Mark (p. 221) .--- At the end of the piazza is the Pal. del Capitanio,
with a clock-tower, once the seat of the Venetian governor, with
a. portal by Falconetto (1532). Behind is the University Library
(Pl. B, 4).

The Cathedral (Pl. B, 4), with an 11ndinighed fatade, was built
by Andr. della Valle and Ag. Righetto in 1651-77, in the late-Re-
naissance style. The Treasury (Tesoro) contains miniatures of the
12-15th centuries and handsome ecclesiastical vessels. Adjoining
the cathedral on the N. is the Baptistery, an elegant brick structure
of the 12th cent., adorned with frescoes of 1380, ascribed to Gusto
Padovano (opened try the sacristan). - In the adjacent EPISCOPAL
PALACE is a hall with portraits of the bishops, painted in fresco
by Montagnana, including a portrait of Petrarch. The vestibule
and the adjacent library of the Cathedral Chapter each contain an
interesting painting by Semitecolo of Venice (1367).

From the Via Otto Febbraio (p. 249) a side-street, skirting the
S. side of the university, leads to the Ponte San Lorenzo (Pl. D, 4).
No. 3359 in this street is Dante's House (comp. p. 255). In front
of it is a medieval sarcophagus of 1283, known as the Tomb Of
Antenor (comp. ll. 248).

A few paces farther on (finger-post,'al Banto') is the Via (361
Santo, leading to the right to the (6 min.) PIAZZA DBL SANTO
(Pl. D, Co).
