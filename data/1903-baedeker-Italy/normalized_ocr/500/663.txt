Quitting the Piazza delle Signoria. o. 445), we follow the Via
de' Gondi to the right, which leads us to the Puzu SAN FIBBNZB
(Pl. F, ti), with the church of that name. No. i, on the W. side
of this Piazza, is the Patasso Gondi, begin about 1490 by Ginlimo
da Sengallo, and remodelled in 1874 by Poggi, with a rustic: facade
tapering towards the top and a handsome court. In one of the rooms
on the first floor is a marble ohimmsy-pitsoe, with a relief by G. d:
Sangallo.

Immediately on the right in the VIA DBL PaocomsoLo (P1. F, 5),
which leads hence to the N. to the Piazza del Duomo, rises (No. l)
the Palazzo del Pedesth, commonly known as *11 Bargello (Pl. F, 5),
begun in 1255 for the Capitano del Popolo (p. 440), and from 12610)
the residence of the Podcsth, or chief magistrate of Florence. The
building was repeatedly damaged by riots, ilrty (1332), and water
(1333) during the 14th century. From 1574 it served as a prison and
seat of the head of the police (Bargello). The oldest part of the
building, towards the Via. Proconsolo, is of ashlar, the upper story
(added after 1332) and the extension towards the E. are of rough,
unhewn stone. Between 1867 and 1865 the imposing structure
was judiciously restored by Franc. Mazzei and ilttei1 up for the
"National Museum (Museo Nasionale), illustrative of the medianl
and modern history of Italian culture and art. It contains several
admirable Renaissance bronzes and marbles (comp. p. I). Admir
sion, see p. 437; catalogue (1898) by the curator I. B. Supino, 8 tr.
The more important works are labelled with the masters' names and
short explanations.

The two front rooms of the GROUND FLOOR contain a valuable
collection of weapons, comprising many pieces of great worth and
beauty formerly in the possession of the Medici. In the MAIN Room,

wheel-look muskets inlaid with ivory; in the last cabinet on the left,
helmet and shield by Gasparo Mala (17th cent.). The adjoining
room in the tower contains armour and a Turkish saddle.

We then enter the picturesque "Grmer, embellished with the
armorial bearings pf former Podestés, and forming with its massive
colonnades and tine flight of steps (built in 1345-67) a dignified
and eloquent picture of the spirit of the 14th century. The walls
under the colonnades are painted with the armorial bearings of the
different quarters of the town. On the N. side: 3. Niccolb d'Aresso,
