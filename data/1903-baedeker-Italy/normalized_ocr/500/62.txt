ITALIAN ART. 1i

Aunno (creator of the Cappelle Colleoni at Bergamo), and, at a
later period, Cms'rorono SOLARI, surnamed IL GonBo; Venice
abounds in works by the LOMBABDI, including ALBSBANDBO Lno-
rm: (d. 1522), the most famous sculptor of his period; Riccro or
Bnlosco (p. xlvii) wrought at Padua; Aeosmo Bum, IL Burma
(ea. 14804548), and the above-mentioned Cms'rorono SOLABI, were
actively engaged at Milan; and Modena "oriled employment to
MAZZONI and BBGABBLLI (p. 348), artists in terracotta.

Among the various works executed by these masters, Monumental
Tombs largely predominate. While these monuments are often of
I somewhat bombastic character, they afford an excellent t1lmr.
tration of the high value attached to individuality and personal
culture during the Renaissance period. We may perhaps also fre-
quently take exception to the monotony of their style, which
remained almost unaltered for a whole century, but we cannot fail
to derive genuine pleasure from the inexhaustible freshness of
imagination and richness of detail displayed within so narrow limits.

As museums cannot convey an adequate idea of the sculpture
of the 15th century, "the picture galleries will not afford an
accurate insight into the painting of that period. Sculp- Pun,"
taxes are frequently removed from their original position, or nu: Cm.
meny of those belonging to the Florentine churches, for WEWNTO-
example, having been of late transferred to museums; but mural
paintings are of course generally inseparable from the walls which
they adorn. 0f the frescoes of the 15th century of which a record has
been preserved, perhaps one-half have been destroyed or obliterated,
but those still extant are the most instructive and attractive ex-
: mples of the art of this period. The mural paintings in the church
of Santa Maria del Carmine (Cappella Braneaeei) at Florence o. 509)
are usually spoken of as the earliest specimens of the painting of
the Renaissance. On material grounds the e1agidfieuion is jmetifiable,
Is this cycle of pictures may be regarded as a programme of the
earlier art of the Renaissance, the importance of which it served to
mtintein, even during the age of Raphael. Here the beauty of the
nude was first revealed, and here a calm dignity was for the f1rat
time imparted to the individual figures, as well as to the general
amngement; and the transformation of a group of indifferent specta-
tors in the composition into a sympathising choir, forming as it were
a frame to the principal actors in the scene, was first successfully
effected. It is, therefore, natural that these frescoes shoulti still be
regarded "models for imitation, and that, when the attention of
connoisseurs was again directed during the 18th century to the
beauties of the prts-Raphaelite period, the works of MASOIJNO O)
md MABAOOIO (1401-28) should have been eagerly rescued from
oblivion.

A visit to the churches and eonvents ofFlorenee is well calculated
to convey an idea of the subsequent rapid development of the art of

day
