lost its prosperity for ever. Theneeforward until 1797, and again in
1815-60, it belonged to the States of the Church. In Aug., 1849, Garibaldi
found refuge at Revenue. from the pursuing Austrians, while his wife
Anita succumbed to the fatigues of the flight.

In the History of Eerly Christian Art of the 5-8th century, Revenue is
the most Important place in Italy next to Rome. While most of the other
Italian cities fell into decay after the barbarian invasion, Revenue saw
new and imposing structures rising in her midst "that period. The
connection of Roman and Byzantine art may best be studied at Revenue.
Here, as at Constantinople, also formerly the centre of a brilliant archi-
tectural period, the traveller will observe how the capitals of the columns
were gradually remodelled, and a new style of ornamentation introduced.
Besides the basilicas there are also dome-structures, which form a link
between Byzantium and some of the churches of N. Italy and the cathedral
at Aix-le-Chapelle. The ancient Bunbmes of Revenue belong to three
different periods, the i1rat being that of Honorius and his sister Gall:
Placidia, 402-450 (Cathedral, Sant' Agata, San Giovanni Evangelina, San
Giovanni Battisfa, Mausoleum of Galla Placidt'a, Archiept'scopal Chapel,
Baptistery of the Orthodox, and San Francuco); the second a Gothic period
from MB to about 539 (St. Martina: or Sam" Apomnare Nuovo, Spirilo
Santa, Baptistery of the Ariana or Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and the Palace
and Mausoleum of TheodoritV, and the third a Byzantine period from 539
onwards (San Vitals and Sant' Apollc'nare in Claus, both begun in the pre-
ceding period). The basilicas of Revenue differ from the Roman in having
their porticoes converted into a closed anterior structure, in possessing
columns expressly designed for their object (by Byzantine architects in
Istria) instead of being brought from other buildings, and in showing a
consistent use of the round arch with corresponding articulation on the
external walls (Palace of Theodorie; Ssnt' Apollinare in Classe). This last
feature ap ears also in Diocletian's buildings at Selena. Round campanili,
detached rom the churches, begin to appear in the 8th century. Transepts
are wanting, as also was probably the case originally In most of the Roman
baailieaa. Notwithstanding the alterations of subsequent ages, and the
raising of the pavements by several feet, which was rendered necessary by
the gradually increasing elevation of the surrounding soil, these noble
monuments of triumphant Christianity are profoundly impressive, and their
effect is greatly enhanced by the stillness and solitude of the environs. -
MosAIc PAINTING was also extensively practised "Revenue. The earlier
symbolism (Baptistery of the Orthodox, Mausoleum of Galla Placidia) was
gradually abandoned for the historical Christian style (8ant' Apollinare
Nuovo, San Vitale), but at the same time the fHtslity to nature became
less and the designs became stiff and conventional. At this period, too,
the costly but stiff costumes, and the ceremouial air of the Byzantine court,
began to affect the designs, thus preparing the way for the later Byzantine
style. - The traveller will also have an opportunity here of examining
SAROOPHAGI, Ivonr CABVINO (Throne of Archbp. Maximian, ll; 387), Brucco
Remus (Baptistery of the Orthodox, p. 388), and other wor s of the early
Christian period, and thus obtain a very comprehensive review of the art
products of the centuries preceding the Carlovingian era.

Lord Byron, who preferred Revenue to all the other towns of Italy,
and was influenced in some measure by his intimacy with the Countess
Gniccioli, a member of the Gemba family of Revenue, spent two years
here (June, 1819, to October, 1821; see p. 389).

From the station (Pl. G, 3, 4), in front of which rises a statue to
the Italian patriot L. C. Farini, Dictator of the Emilia in 1860, we
pass the Piazza Anita Garibaldi, with the church of San Giovanni
Evangelism (p. 392) and a monument (by Zocchi; 1888) to the
champions of Italian liberty, and crossing the Corso Giuseppe (hd-
baldi (to the right, Spirito Santo and theBaptistery of the Ariana,
p. 392), proceed straight on through the Via Farini to the Puzu
