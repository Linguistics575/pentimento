whose immediate successors were Peselh'no (1422-57), Amado Bahiorineili
(1427-99), and the brothers Antonio and Piero Pollajuolo (1429-98 and 1443-
ca. 1496). The chief aims of the school were to master the technical
intricacies of the art, to invest each f1gare with beauty, to arrange the
groups harmoniously, and to cultivate a. faithful portraiture of real life,

a son of Fra Filippo, and Domenico Ghirlandajo (1449-94). The history of
Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo Buonarroti, and Raphael, the princes of
Italian art, is not permanently associated with Florence, but their residue:
in this city exercised a material'tnf1aenee on their respective careers.
Leonardo and Michael Angelo, both Tuscans, may be regarded as belonging
to Florence owing to the completion of their studies there, and it was at
Florence that Raphael supplemented his art education and shook off the
trammels of the Umbrian school. About 1506 the art history of Flerence
attained its most glorious period. Leonardo, Michael Angelo, and Raphael
wore then engaged here together, and with them were associated Lorena
di Credi (1159-1537), a master closely allied to Leonardo, the fanciful
Piero dd Can'mo (tu2-1521), Pra Bartolomeo (1475-1517), an intimate friend
of Raphael, and the talented colourist Andrea del Sarto (1487-1531), while
the last two were rivalled by Albertinelli, Wamsabigio, and Pontornw.
Ridolfo Ghirlaudajo follows the steps of Leonardo and Raphael, at least
in his ortraits. The union of the greatest masters at Rome, effected by
Julius. and Leo X., at length detracted from the reputation of Florence,
and, the despotic sway of the Medici tended to cheek farther development.
After the 16th cent. Florence produced no architecture worthy of note;
and the provinces of painting and sculpture, although cultivated with
more success, now proved destitute of depth and independence. Florence
was the chief headquarters of the mannerist imitators of Michael Angelo,
the most eminent of whom were Giorgio Vasari, the well-known biographer
of artists (1511-74), Angelo Bronzino, and Alessandro Allori. Among' sculp-
tors may be mentioned Benoenuto Cellim" (1500-1572), also eminent as I
gphlamith, and Giovanni da Bologna (1524-1603), properly Jean Boulom
of Douai, in French Flanders. In the 17th cent. the principal Florentine
artists were Iodooico Cardi, surnamed Gigoli t1559-1613), 0ristofano Allan
(1577-1621), Francaco Furim' (ca. 1600-46), and the insipidly sweet Carlo

Florence was originally situated wholly on the right bank of the
Arno, but It extended at an early period in the middle ages to the
opposite bank also. The walls of the city, which have been almost
entirely removed since 1865, were constructed "the same time as
the cathedral, between 1285 and 1388. The ancient Gums, however,
nearly all altered or added to in 1529, have been spared. The follow.

erected in 1330; Porta San Frediano (P1. B, 4), erected in 1332 by
Andrea Pisano (f); Porta Romana (P1. A, 7), erected in 1328 by
J acopo Orcagna; and Porta San Miniato (Pl. F, 8). The New QUABTBBS

San Gallo, and to the E. of the old town. The broad Viali di Circon-
vallasione encircle the town on the right bank under various names
and occupy the site of the old fortifications. Since 1888 the narrow
