Ferrara (30 ft.), the ancient Forum Alieni, situated 31/2 M. to
the S. of the Po, in a fertile plain, is the capital of a province, with
M, 301 1nhab., and the seat of an archbishop and of a university.
It possesses broad streets, numerous palaces, and other reminiscen-
ces of its golden period, when it was a prosperous commercial place,
numbering 100,000 inhab., and the seat of the celebrated court

of the House of Este.

The ht) lr, of Bate was probably descended from the Carlovingien
governors of eutonie origin, and derived ita feudal nme from the castle
mentioned at p. 241. Ana II. (d. 1097) became Count or Menu on
Ear: under Bmp. Henry IV. Hie eon Wetf (founder of the younger branch
of the Guelpha) was invested with the Duchy of Bavaria, and his son
Henry the Proud became the founder of the families of Brunswick and
Hanover. Folco (ea. 1097-1135), the eldest eon of A220 was the ancestor
of the Italian house of Blue. Obizzo II. (d. 1298), who established a
permanent dominion over Modem. in 1288 and Reggie in 1289, considerably
extended the power of his house. Niccolo III. (d. Itil) summoned to his
court in MN the erudite Gumbo (1370-1460), who here laid the founda-
tion of a. roaperoue school of libenl learning. In 1452 Niccolo's eon
Borso rece ved the title of Dunn or Monnu AND Rnaaxo from Emg.
Frederick III. and in 1470 that of Done or anuu from Pope Peul I.
He died in ith.' His brother Hercule: I. (1471-1605) and the son of the
letter, Alphonso I. (15115-34), whose second wife was the infamous Luerezie
Borgia, were powerful and influential princes. Lodovtco Ariosto (1474-1533;
p. 880), the greatest Italian poet of the 16th cent., was in the service of
Alphonso from 1518. Though bloody feuds distracted the ruling family,
the city steadily grew in prosperity. Hercules 11. (1584-58) non of Alphonso,
was the husband of Renata, daughter of Louis XII. of rance, petronese
of the Reformere Calvin and Merot, to whom she accorded an asylum.
Having deelued herself in favour of the reformed doctrines, she was
seguted from her husband and children. Her son Alphonso II. (1558-97)
re. ed the glory of Ferrera to its culminating point, but with him the
family became extinct, his three marriages being childless. He was the
patron of the poeta Tauo (1544-95) and Guan'nt (author of the'Pastor Fido';
born "Ferret: in 1637, died at Venice in 1612). Goethe in his'Torquato

1575, although a somewhat ideal colouring is given to some of the characters.
Hm description of the attachment of Tessa to Eleonora (153781), the
YOungeet unmarried sister of the duke seems to have a poetical founda-
tion only. Anna (1581-1607), one of the sisters, was married to the Due
do Guise, and afterwards to the Duo de Nemours; Lucretia (153448), the
other sister was the wife of the Duke of Urbino. Alphonso, II. was suc-
