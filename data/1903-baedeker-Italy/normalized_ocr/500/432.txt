each other. They are said also to have been brought from Ptolemais
and are the subject of various legends (see Here's'Venice').
The square Oampanile (di San Marco), 822 ft. in height, which
', rose opposite St. Mark's, to the S.W., collapsed on July 14th, 1902,
crushing the Loggetta at its foot. It was begun in 888, rebuilt in
, 1329, provided with a marble top in 1417, and in 1517 crowned
I with the figure of an angel nearly 16 ft. high (now destroyed). The
Loggctta, or vestibule, on the B. side of the Campanile, erected by
Sansovino in 1540, was once a rendezvous of the Nobili and after-
wards a waiting-room for the guards during the sessions of the great
Council. The bronze statues of Peace, Mercury, Apollo, and Pallas,
and the reliefs on the lower part of the walls, by Sansovino, as well
M the Bronze Gain, cast in 1750, have partially escaped destruction.
Both the Campanile and Loggetta will be rebuilt.
The Clock Tower (La Torre dell' Orologio; Pi. G, H, 5), on the
[ opposite side, at the B. end of the Old Proeuratie, erected in 1496-99
- perhaps from designs by Moro Coducci (?), rises over a lofty gateway,
[ which forms the entrance to the Ifereeria (p. 298). On the platform
are two giants in bronze (by Ant. Rizzo 8, who strike the hours on a
' bell. The custodian of the clock explains the mechanism (1/2 fr.);
entrance under the archway to the left, indicated by a notice.

From the S.E. corner of the Piazza of St. Mark to the Lagune
extends the'Piauetta (Pl. B, 5, 6), bounded on the W. by the
Library, and on the E. by the Palace of the Doges. On the side
next the Lagune are two Granite Columns, from Syria or Constan-
tinople, erected here in 1180; one of them bears the Winged Lion
of M. Mark (shattered "Paris in 1815, but put together again in
1893); the other, St. Theodore on a crocodile, patron of the ancient
republic, placed here in 1329. This used to be the place of execu-
tion; it is now (at the Halo) the chief stand for gondolas o. 260).
The Venetian phrase'Ira Marco e Todard corresponds to our'be-
tween hammer and anvil'.

The former I" Library (Libreria Vecchia), begun by Sansovino
in 1536, is a magnitieent building of the 16th cent., and one of
the ilnegt secular edifiees in Italy. In plan it consists of a double
eolonnade with arches and embedded columns. In the upper eol-
onnade the arches rest upon a series of smaller fluted columns of the
ionic order. The efreot is so fine as' to justify certain liberties
Sansovino has taken, such as that of enlarging the metopee at
: he expense of the triglyphs and architrave. The caryatides at
he main portal are by Al. Vittoria. The interesting interior, now
mited with the Procuratie Nuove to form the royal palace (p. 271),
: ontains a ceiling-painting representing Wisdom, by Titian (a late
work), and in the hall of the library are ceiling-paintings by P. Vero-
"ae, 8ehiavone, and others, and wall-paintings by Tintoretto and
1folinari. The N.E. end was seriously damaged by the fall of the
lampanile on J uly 14th, 1902.
