the 15th cent. en evil omen occurred: popatantuop1e was captured by the
Turks in 1453, and the supremecy of Venice in the East was thus under-
mined. The crowning blow, however, was the discovery of the new eel-
rontes to India. "the close of the century, by which its commerce wu
diverted to the Portuguese. Yet'the arts, which had meanwhile been
silently developing, shed a glorious sunset over the waning glory of the
mighty Republic'.

The opening of the 16th cent. brought new losses. In 1503 Venice I
signed a. humiliating peace with iazat IL, to whom the ceded the whole
of the Morel. The League of Cam mi, formed by the Pope, the Emperor,
and the Kings of France and Aragon against Venice in 1513, and the victory
of the French at Agnadello in 1509 occasioned aerioue losses to the Re ublie.
The were between Emp. Charles V. and Francis I. ot France (1521- J were
also prejudicial to Venice, but her power was most seriously impaired by
her continuous struggle against the Osmans. In 1540 she lost Nauplia, the
ialnnds of Chioa, Paros, end others, and in 1571 Cyprus also, notwith-
standing its brave defence by Bragadino. In the navel battle of Le anto
fiat Oct. 1571) the Venetian fleet distinguished itself greatly. In 16 the
island Cl Candie was conquered by the Turks. The Venetiane, however,
under Francesco Horosim''Nopoanotaetu') and Konigsmarck, were victor-
ione in the Morea in 1 t and conquered Coron, Patras, Corinth, and
Athens; in 1696 and 1698 the again defeated the Turkish tleeu and by
the Peace of Carlowitz in 17 they regained the Korea; but the Turks
reeonqnered the peninsula in 1715, and in 1718 were eondrmed in their
possession by the Peace of Paasarowitz.

From' this period Venice ceases to occupy a prominent position in
history. She retained her N. Italian possessions only, remained neutral
in every war, and continued to decline in power. On the outbreak of the
French Revolution Venice at flrtst atontly opposed the new principles; on
the victorious advance of the French she endeavoured to preserve her
neutrality, and repeatedly rejected Bontrptrrte't' proposals of alliance.
Irritated by this pppoaitiop he broke off his negotiation and took possession
of the city on 16th May,'iWrf',' and the last (loge Ludovico Afanin (1788-97),
abdicated. By the Peace of Cempo Formio (1 ti?) Venetia was assigned to
Austria, by that of Pressburg (18%) to the kingdom of Italy and in 1814
to Austria. At length in 1848 Venice declared herself a Repubiio under the
presidency of Daniele Hanin; but after a siege of 15 months she was taken
by Badetzky in Aug., 1849. Lastly, the war of 1866 led to the union of
Venetie with the kingdom of Italy. Bee gr. F. BrounN'W8torr of Venice',

In the History of Art Venice has shown herself .05 independent of
the mainland ea in situation and political history. The surprise of the
traveller who beholds Venice for the firat time, even after having seen
the rest of Italy, will also be felt by those who study her art. The earliest
monuments of Venice at once betray the fact that her sweetness was
founded on her Oriental commerce. The church of St. Mark is in the
BIzAN'rnu style, the oldest mosaics bear a Byzantine impress end the
same type is observable in other branches of art. The Palezzt Farsetti,

during the period 01 Gormc Am the Venetians differed in their style from
the rest of Italy. In ecclesiastical architecture these dlfrerenees were com-
paratively slight, but the Venetian palaces, which, as generally in Up er
Italy, are the chief Gothic buildings, possess a more marked individual ty,
and foremost among them is that of the Doges. They possess a large

and everywhere a wealth Cl decoration and colour. Such are the tht Doro,
the Palazzo Foscari, and many others on the Canal Grande. Still more
