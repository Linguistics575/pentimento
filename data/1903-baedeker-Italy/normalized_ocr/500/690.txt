The CLoxsms, immediately adjoining the church, with double'
arcades attributed to Brunelleaehi, form a striking reminiscence of the
great period of the Medici. Immediately to the right is a statue of
Paolo Giovio (1483-1655), the historian, by Francesco da Sangauo
(1560).

A staircase, beginning in the passage to the right of the entrance
to the church, ascends to the upper story of the cloisters and to the
Biblioteoe Laursnziana (P1. E, F, 4; adm., see p. 437; gratuities
forbidden), a library founded try Cosimo the Elder in 1444, and
gradually enlarged by the Medici. Its chief treasure consists of
about 10,000 MSS. of Greek and Latin classical authors, many of
which are extremely valuable. The building was begun in 1523-6
from the design of Michael Angelo, the portico was built by him
(very effective in spite of seven ] tstsetmtritsititstr, such as the columns
inserted in the walls, with massive volutes below), and the staircase
Ewhich was also designed by Michael Angelo) was completed in

558-71 by Vasari t' the rotunda containing the Bibi. Delciena, was
, erected in 1841, from Poeeianti'8 design.

The wooden ceiling of the Library was executed by a. B. dd Tauo and
Carota, from Michael Angelou designs (after 1529?). The last else fur.
nished the design for the 88'plutei' to which the M88. are attached. Among
these ere a number of codices of rare value: Virgil of the Ath or 5th cent;

To San Lorenzo belong also the New Sacristy and the Chapel of
the Princes, the entrance to Which, however, is now in the Puzzs
MADONNA (Pl. E, 3; adm., see p. 437), at the back of the church.
From the vestibule we ascend a flight of steps to the left, and reach
first the chapel of the princes, and then the new sacristy (on the left).

The CHAPEL or m Pamons (Cappelta dei Principi), the burial
chapel of the grand-dukes of the Medici family, was constructed after
1604 by Matteo Nigetti, from the designs of Giovanni de' Medici.

T It is octagonal in form, covered by a dome and gorgeously decorated
