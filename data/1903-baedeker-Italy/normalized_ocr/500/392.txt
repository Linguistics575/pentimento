Vicenza (105 ft.), the ancient Vicetia, capital of s province and
see of a bishop, with 43,703 inhab., lies at the N. base of the Monti
Berici (p. 242), on both sides of the Bacchiglione, at its con-
fr1enee with the Retronc. Although closely built, the town possesses
many interesting palaces, to which, with the picturesque environs,

a short visit may profitably be devoted.

Vicenza, like most of the larger towns of N. Italy, boasted in the 15th
cent. of a 808001. or PAINTING, which, though it was strongly influenced
by Mantegna (born here in 1431, but active in Padua and Mantua alone),
i''and never produced masters of the highest rank, yielded results of consider-
. able importance. The earliest master of note was Giovanni tit anza, who,

however, was soon surpassed by Bartolomeo Mantegna (ca. 1 4523). The
gallery and the churches (Cathedral, Santa Corona) of Vicenza contain
'. works by the latter. His compositions are strongly realistic, and he shows
a predilection for muscular figures, and for colouring of a rich brownish
tint. His drapery is ungrsceful, but, like that of Diirer, boldly defined.
_ Bis son, Benedetto Montagna, was unimportant, but his contemporary trio-
vanni Buoneonst'irtio, surnamed Harescalco. (d. 1530), resembling the Tren-
.etians both in conception and colouring, ranks as the second master of
, note. His chief works are the Pietit in the Museum (p. 245), and the
.Iadonns at Ban Rocco (p. 246). In the 16th cent. Vicenza lost its im-
- portence as a school of painting, but attained a high reputation in the
province of ARCHITECTURE, having given birth to Andrea Palladio (1518-80),
the last great architect of the Renaissance, the chief sphere of whose
operations was his native town. By his study of the antique in Rome he
was enabled to effect a revival of what may be termed the ancient language
of forms, and he made it his endeavour to exhibit in his buildings the
organic connection between the different members. The chief character-
istic of his schooi consists in a. studious adherence to impressive simplicity
of form, and a. very sparing indulgence in the lavish enrichments in which
the early-Rensissence was too apt to revel. His flttegt churches are at
Venice (comp. p. 267), bat his most numerous palaces are at Vieenza, to
which they impart a uniform and handsome appearance.

We enter the town by the w. gate, Porta del Castello (Pl. B, 3).
Immediately to the right, on _thts S. side of the narrow Piazza del
Castello, is the Palasso Giulio Porto, formerly called Casa del Diavolo,
a large unfinished palace by Palladio, with two stories united by a
row of Corinthian columns with a. rich cornice. To the left rises a
monument to Garibaldi by Ferrari, erected in 1887.

Near the statue, at the beginning of the 00350 PnINCIrB The.
BBBTO, which intersects the entire town, lies the Palaszo Bonin,
by Vine. Scsmozzi. 0n the right, opposite the church of San Filippo
Nari (P1. B, 3; 1719), stands the Palazzo Loschi (18th cent.). -
The Strada Loschi, the next cross-street on the right, leads to the
