windows on the groundi1oor) and the Palauo Buturlin (Pl. ll, 4;
formerly Pal. Niccolini) on the left (No. 16), with its handsome
court and modern painting. The former was erected by B. Ammanati,
the latter by Domenico, son of Baceio d'Agnolo. We then reach
the Piazza dell' Annunziata.

The large block of buildings in the adjacent Via de' Pueci is
the Palasso Pucci (Pl. F, 4), dating from the 15th cent., but partly
rebuilt in the 16th and 17th by Bart. Ammanati and 1raleonierr.

In the Via degli Alfani, to the right, a little short of the Piazza,
rises the former Camaldulensian convent of SANTA MARIA DBGLI
ANGIOLI (Pl. c, 4), founded in 1296, with an unfinished octagonal
Oratory with _nie1ieir, by Brunelleschi. - Opposite (No. 50) is the
Palazso Giugni, built by Ammanati in 1660, with a tine court.

At the left corner of the Puzzs DELL' ANNUNZIATA (Pl. G, 3, 4)
is (No. 1) the Palazzo Riccardi-Mannclli, a brick edifiee with orm-

Tacea (1629), and the Equestrian Statue of theWrand-Duke Fer-

naissance architecture, begun in 1419 by Brunelleeehi, continued
by his pupil Francesco delta Luna, and completed in 1451, "the

della Robbia. To the left in the court, over the door leading to
the church of SANTA Mum. DEGLI INNOCBNTI, is a good Annun-
ciation by Andrea della Robbia. The interior contains an altar-pieee
(covered), the *Adoration of the Magi, by Domenico Ghirlandajo
(1488), and a relief of the Madonna by Luca della Robbia. On the
right side of the court is the entrance to a small pieture-gallery
(Piero di Cosimo, etc.). - Opposite the Spedale is the hall of the
Servi di Santa Maria brotherhood, erected by Antonio da Saugallo
the Elder and Baccio dUgnolo (1518).
