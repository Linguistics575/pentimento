the poet's teachers and patrons (Virgil, Brunette Latini, Can Grande della
Scale, and Guido "Polenta) -, opposite the entrance is a half-length relief of
Dante, and below it a sarcophagus, a. marble urn in which now contains the
poet's remains. It been an epitaph composed by Bern. Ganaccio in 1357: -

Jura Moaarehiae, Super", Phlegethonta lamque
Lustrando cecim', voluerunt fata quousque,

Sod quia pars ccuit melioribu: hospita caun's,
AtuJetoremgtut mum petiit folict'or astris,

Hie claudor Dames, patriis extorris ab ora,
Quem trenuit parm' Florencia mater ameris.

A marble slab opposite the tomb indicates the site of the house
in which Guido da.Polenta entertained the poet (1317). - To the
'right of the tomb is the eo-called & polereto di Braccioforte, a smell
court with eleven Early Christian Bareophagt, some of which, how..
ever, were found elsewhere. The largest (4th cent.) has a represen-
tation of Christ between St. Peter and St. Paul, with the Annun-
ciation end Visitation at the sides. The remains of Dante, which
had been lost sight of in 1810, were rediscovered here in 1865.

SAN MICHELE IN Armoxsco (P1. 20, D 4; entrance, Via Rattazzi 7),
erected in the 6th cent, is now destroyed with the exception of the
apse and the campanile (15th cent) .--Near by is the Torre
Comunale (P1. 42; D, 3), a tower of the 11th or 12th cent., 130 ft. high.

SAN DOMBNIOO (Pl. 0, 3, 4), a basilica founded in 1269 and
rebuilt by a. B, Contini about 1700, is adorned with four paintings
by N. Rondinclli. - In the Via Cure, to the S. of the Porta Adri ans,
is the picturesque church of 8anti Giowanni e Paolo (P1. B, 3, 4), of
ancient foundation, but rebuilt by Dom. Barbiani in 1768; the
lower part of the tower belonged to the original edifiee. An ambo
of 596 in the interior resembles that in the cathedral (p. 387).

*Ban Vitals CPI. c, 3) was erected under the superintendents
of Julienne Argentarius by Arehbp. Ecclesius (521-534) on the spot
where St. Vitalis suffered martyrdom, and was consecrated by St.
Maximian in 547. It was probably originally the oourt-ehureh,
and served as a model to Charlemagne for the cathedral of Aix-
hr-Chapelle. The church is octagonal (371/2 yds. in diameter), with
a choir, three-sided on the exterior, and round in the interior,
added to it on the E. side. The vestibule adjoining the church
obliquely on the W. side was originally flanked by two towers, of
which that on the N. was pulled down in 1539, while that on the S.
was replaced at an early date by a oampanile, restored in 1688.

The INTERIOR, remodelled in 1530-40, was restored by Corrado Rind
in 1898-1900 and freed from inappropriate additions, with the exception of
the baroque frescoes by J? eraJtno Baroggi and others in the dome. It is
divided by eight massive pillars into a. central space and a surrounding
ambulatory. Between the pillars are semicircular niches with pairs of
columns and arches, in two series, one above the other, over which rises
the dome, constructed of earthen vessels. Each of the windows in the
dome is divided by a mullion into two round-arched lights. The lower
parts of the pillars are still incrusted with their original coating of rare
marble t Airrieauo0. The upper columns have capitals of several pieces.
the lower columns tine traptssium-etpitals (perhaps the earliest in Revenue).
The pavement has been raised about 21/: ft. in the course of centuries.
