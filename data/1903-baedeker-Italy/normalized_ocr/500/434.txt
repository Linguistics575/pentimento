Pal. of the Doges. VENICE. d2. Route. 277

Lion of M. Mark ind the kneeling figure of Doge Wane. Foscari,
above the portal, is modern (comp. p. 281).

The magnitietsnt *0omvr was begun about 1483 by Ant. Risso,
continued in 1499-1511 by Pietro Lombardo end in 1545-50 by Ant.
& atpasrnino, but only partly completed. The tlorid facade on the E.
side is probably by Rizzo. The little'Faeade adjoining St. Mark's
at the NE. corner, attributed to Gugl. Bcrgamaaco (1520), is less
gorgeous, but more happily proportioned. Within one of the highest
windows to the left of the main facade was the prison of the poet
Count Silvio Pellieo in 1822, before he was removed to the Spiel-
berg "Briinn (comp. p. 43). In the centre of the court are two
Well Heads in bronze, of 1556 and 1559. On the facade of the
Clock Tourer, to the right, is a statue of the Venetian general Duke
Francis Maria I. of Urbino (d. 1538) by the Florentine sculptor
o, Bandini. The other statues are antique, but freely restored.

The richly ornamented Scala det Giganti, the flight of steps leading
to the palace, derives its name from the colossal statues of Mars and
Neptune at the top, by Samovino (1554). On the highest landing of
these steps, in the later period of the Republic, the doges were
crowned. Opposite are beautiful statues of Mdam and Eve, by
Antonio Rizzo (1464).

The *IN'rnnIon (admission, see p. 265; offiee on the tlrgt iioor,
to the right) is another prominent specimen of Venetian art,
although it was robbed of many treasures by the French in 1797.
While the earliest native painters devoted their energies to the
church of St. Mark, the great masters of the 15th and 16th cent.
were tshiet1y engaged in the Palace of the Doges. As, however,
their works were destroyed by the great fire of 1577, the palace
now forms a museum of later masters only, such asTintorctto,
Paolo Vcroneac, and Palma 6qovane, but it still presents a most
brilliant display of Venetian painting, so far as executed for behoof
of the state. The excellent condition of the paintings is note-
worthy; the gorgeous colouring of P. Vcronesc is nowhere better
illustrated. Lists of the pictures are placed in the principal rooms
(except on Sun. and holidays; printed description 50 0.).

We ascend the Scala dei Giganti. Around the upper eolonnade
are modern busts of Venetian scholars, artists, and doges, and a
few antiques from the Archaeological Museum (p. 281; Dionysus
and a satyr, Apollo resting, two Muses). Tickets of admission are
sold opposite the staircase (see p. 265). To the right is the richly
decorated Scala d'Oro of Sansovino, completed in 1577, once
accessible to those only whose names were entered as'Nobili' in
the Golden Book. The stucco-work is by Al. Vittoria, the paintings
by a. B. Franco. By this staircase we ascend on week-daye direct
to the upper story. - The next staircase, the Scala dei Censori, is
the entrance on Sundays and festivals (p. 279).

The UPPER FLOOR contains the apartments in which the author-
