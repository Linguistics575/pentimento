Novella.

From the entrance of the Wa de' Cerretani, which leads straight
from the Piazza del Duomo (p. 450) to Santa Maria Novella, the Borgo
S. Lorenzo runs to the right to the PIAZZA SAN LonBNzo (Pl. F, 4).
To the left in this square is the church of S. Lorenzo, and at its
N. end, near the Via de' Ginori (p. 490), is a statue of Giovanni
delle Bande Nere (p. 442), by Baccio Bandinelli (1540), on a
pedestal ('Base di Ban Lorenzo'), with reliefs referring to Giovanni's
victories.

*San Lorenzo (P1. E, F, 3, 4), founded and consecrated by St. Am..
brose in 394 and restored in the iith cent., is one of the most
ancient churches in Italy. In 1425 the Medici and seven other fam.
ilies began a complete reconstruction of the church on a lager
scale from the designs of Filippo Brunelleschi, who restored the
form of the early-Christian basilica, consisting of a nave and aisles
terminated by a transept, the nave being covered with a flat ceiling,
and the aisles with groined vaulting. He then added low chapels
resembling recesses on each side. Over the columns (14 in number,
and two pillars) he replaced the ancient architreve which had been
removed in the middle ages, and now support the fine projecting
arches. The cupola, which rests upon the cross without the inter-
position of a drum, was added by Brune11estshih, successor, Ag.
Manettt (d. 1460). The high-altar was consecrated in 1461. The
inner wall of the facade is by Michael Angelo, who also added the
New Saoristy (p. 500) and the Laurentian Library. His design for
the outside of the facade (1516) was unfortunately never executed,
but is preserved in the Galleria Buonarroti (p. 480). The com-
