compete with that of antiquity. Yet the plastic art, tar from
enjoying a lower degree of favour, was rather viewed by the ar-
tists of that age as the proper centre of their sphere of activity.
Sculpture was the first art in Italy which was launched into the
stream of the Renaissance, in its development it was ever a step
in sdvanee of the other arts, and in the popular opinion possessed
the advantage of most clearly embodying the current ideas of the
age, and of "ording the most brilliant evidence of the re-a'wekened
lave of art. Owing probably to the closeness of the connection be-
tween the plastic art of the Renaissance and the peculiar national
culture, the former lost much of its value after the decline of the
letter, and was less appreciated than pictorial and architectural
works, in which adventitious historical origin is obviously less im-
portant than general efteet. In tracing the progress of the sculpture
of the Renaissance, the enquirer at once encounters serious de-
vistions from strict precepts, and numerous infringements of aesthetic
rules. The execution of reliefs constitutes by far the widest sphere
of action of the Italian sculptors of the 15th century. These,
however, contrary to immemorial usage, are executed in a pictorial
style. LonBNzo GHIBBBTI (1378-1455), for example, in his cel-
ebrated (eastern) door of the Bsptistery of Florence, is not satis-
fied with grouping the figures as in a printing, and placing them
in :3 rich landscape copied from nature. Be treats the background
in accordance with the rules of perspective; the figaress at a dis-
tance are smaller and less raised than those in the foreground.
He oversteps the limits of the plastic art, and above all violates
the laws of the relief-style, according to which the figures are
always represented in an imaginary space, and the usual system
of a mere design in profile seldom departed from. In like manner
the painted reliefs in terracotta by LUCA DELLA Roman. (1399-1482)
are somewhat inconsistent with purity of plastic form. But if
it be home in mind that the sculptors of the Renaissance did not
derive their ideas from a previously defined system, or adhere to
abstract rules, the fresh and lifelike vigour of their works (espe-
cially those of the 15th century) will not be disputed, and pre-
judice will he dispelled by the great attractions of the reliefs
themselves. The sculpture of the Renaissance adheres as strictly
as the other arts to the fundamental principle of representation;
scrupulous care is bestowed on the faithful and attractive ren-
dering of the individual objects; the taste is gratified by express-
ive heads, graceful female figures, ind Joyous children; the sculp-
tors have a keen appreciation of the beauty of the nude, and
the importance of a. calm and dignified flow of drapery. In their
anxiety for fidelity of representation, however, they do not shrink
from harshness of expression or rigidity of form. Their predi-
lection for bronze-casting, an art which was less in vogue in the
16th cent., accords with their love of indivii1ua1issing their charact-
