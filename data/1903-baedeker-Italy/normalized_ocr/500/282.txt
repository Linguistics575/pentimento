Verena. (P & R; "Hét. Royal;
Alb. Vittoria, pens. tMi/tfr.'t Alb.
Olivcdo) is charmingly situated
on a promontory surrounded by
gardens (Isimbardi, Lelia, Venini,
Keee), "the mouth of the Val
d'Esino. In the vicinity both road
and railway pass through several
tunnels.' Most of the marble
quarried in the neighbourhood is
cut and polished in the town.

About'h M. to the B. of Ya-
renna the Fiume Latte ('milk
brook', from its colour) is precip-
itated in several leaps from a
height of 1000 ft., forming an im-
posing cascade in spring, but gen-
erally dried up at other seasons.

The ruins of Torre ds' Trezio beside
the high-lying hemlet 0t, Vezio
(1/3 hr.) command a beautiful view.
- From Varanna a fatiguing foot-
path leads past Regoledo (p. 160)
and above the Orrfdo di' Beltane to
(1% hr.) Banana (p. 160).

The "lento Grigne (790611.) is a.
