144 Route 19. GERTOSA DI PAVIA. Excursions

1782, was restored to its original destination in 1844 and presented
to the Carthusians. Since the suppression of the Italian monasteries
(i866) it has been maintained as a'National Monument'.

An inspection of the Gertosa, which is open from 8 to 5.30 in
summer and from 9 to 4 in winter (on Sun. & holidays 10-2), takes
11/2-'2 hrs. (adm. i fr., Sun. free; guide imperative, gratuities for-
hidden).

Beyond the VBSTIBULB (tieket-ofiiet0, with sadly-damaged fres-
coes by Bern. Luini (SS. Sebastian and Christopher) and others,
we enter the PIAZZALE, or fore-court, surrounded by the former
Farmacia or laboratory (now a liqueur-distillery), the Foressteria, or
pilgrims' lodging-house, and the Palazzo Ducalc (now a Museum,
p. 145), built about 1625 by Bicehini for distinguished visitors to
the monastery. 0n the E. side of the court rises the celebrated
facade of the church.

The "FACADB, unquestionably the finest example of early-
Renaissance decorative work in N. Italy, is perhaps the most masterly
creation of its kind of the 15th century. Its design, independent
of the antique orders of architecture, is in the Lombard-Romanesque
style of graduated ohureh-fronts, with projecting pillars and trans-
verse arcades, while within these well-defined structural features
it embraces a wonderful and judiciously distributed wealth of
ornament. - The plinth is adorned with medallions of Roman
emperors, above which are reliefs representing Biblical history and
scenes from the life of Gian Galeazzo (including the transference
of the bones of the founder to the Gertosa in 1474). Below the
four magnifleent windows is a. row of angels' heads, and above them
are niches with numerous statues. A relief by the main portal
represents the dedication of the church in 1497.

The beautiful and spacious *INTnmon has a purely Gothic nave,
supported by eight handsome pillars, with aisles and "chapels;
while Renaissance forms begin to appear in the transepts and 01101 ]
(each with a triple absidal ending) and in the dome above the
crossing. The originally handsome decorations designed by Bor-
goynone and the tine stained-glass windows of the 15th cent. haw
nearly all disappeared. Most of the altar-pieces and the present
florid enriehments of the chapels date from the 17th century. Tht
beautiful choir-screen of iron and bronze was executed about 166!
by Fr. Villa and P. P. Ripa. The mosaic pavement, originally lait
down by Rinaldo de Stauris (i450), was restored in 1850.
