History. FLORENCE. 68. Route. 439

the mirror of the lake, so rests on this lovely ground the still more lovely
.Florence, with its everlasting works and its inexhaustible riches. From
the bold airy tower of the palace, rising like tb slender meat, to Brunel-
leschi's wondrous dome of the Cathedral, from the old house of the Spini
to the Pitti Palace, the moat imposing the world has ever seen, from the
garden of the Franciscan convent to the beautiful environs of the Cucine
all ere full of incom arable grace. Each street of Florence contains a Tail
of art; the walla o the city are the calyx containing the fairest flower,
of the human mind; - and this is but the richest gem in the diedem
with which the Italian people have adorned the earth.' (Leo).

Florence (180 ft.), Italian Firenze, formerly Fiorema, from the
Latin Plorentia, justly entitled'la bella', is situated in 43°46' N.
latitude, and Iio2i' E. longitude, on both banks of the Arno, an in-
istgnifieant river except in rainy weather, in a charming valley of
moderate width, picturesquely enclosed by the spurs of the Apen-
nines, the highest visible peak of which (Monte Moreno, p. 5'26)
rises to the N. 0n the S. the heights rise more immediately from
the river, on the N. they are 3-4 M. distant, while towards the
N .W., in the direction of Prato and Pistoj a, the valley expands con-
siderably. The sudden transitions of temperature which frequently
occur here are trying to person in delicate health. The pleasantest
months are April, May, and the first half of June, September,
October, and November. The winter is disproportionately cold,
the mean temperature of January being about MP Fahr.; July
(mean 78°; maximum in 1897, 103°) and August are very hot, and
colds are most dangerous at this season. - The drinking-water of

Florence, mainly filtered water from the Arno, is not considered

very wholesome.

Daring the struggle for the creation of a'United Italy' Florence
was for a short time (1864-71) the capital of the country; but this
honour, though it gave a momentary stimulus to the progress of the
city, ultimately (1878) resulted in a flnaneial collapse, from which it
has only now recovered. As early as the 15th cent. Florence con tained
90,000 inhab., in 1881 it had 168,915, and in 1901 the number was
198, 408. The Florentine, have ever been noted for the vigour of
their reasoning powers and for their pre-eminence in artistic talent.

Eietory. According to recent discoveries, there seems to have been
a. settlement on the present site of Florence at a very early date (in the
eo-called'Villenove period'). This did not attain any great importance
until about RC. 187, when the Roman Via 00mm was prolonged to Arezzo
Floren tin, and Bologna. In 3.0. 90 morentiausnd Feesulaa (Fiesole) receiveti
the Latin municipal fnnehiee, and a decade later, under Sulle, they be-
came military colonies. The Roman Florence, which lay near the Arno,
to the N. of the present Ponte Vecchio, possessed tb Capitol, a Temple of
the Triad (Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva), Thermae for men and women,
and an Amphitheatre.

Only the aeentiest records of its history during the early middle ages are
',0 be found; but it ie tolerably certain that until the death of Countess
Katilda (p. 398) in 1115 Florence remained a place of little importance.
its earliest chroaieler definitely dates the rise of its prosperity from 1120,
n which year Fiesole was destroyed and its inhabitants transplanted to
i'lorenee. But by the beginning of the following century its success in
varfare and its greet and rapidly growing manufactures had already
ransformed it into the most important eammunity in Central Italy. The
