The visitor imbued with the modern taste for the eriod of the Re.
neiasance will ttnd little attraction in the works of the xvnxnnx-m Cm: -
TOBY, which form the chief boast of this gallery. Although it would be
unfair to depreciate the undoubted talent and skill of these late masters,
. their works are unsatisfacto owing to the absence of any definite aim or

indication of progress, and7rom the obvious pains which have been taken
to reproduce trite themes In an interesting manner. In the department
of fretuso-ptstnting the works of these Bolognese eclectics (see p. 365) are

Massacre of the Innocents, exeepttontuly harmonious and dignified MI
character; No. 139, 8ant' Andrea. Corsini, an excellent specimen of Gnido's

work of Lodom'co Oarracei is probably No. M, the Nativity of the Btsptut,
Anm'bale Oarracci': Madonna and saints (No. 36) has the merit of stately
architectural arrangement. The Communion of St. Jerome (N0. 34) by
100mm Carraeed is very inferior to Domenichino's treatment of the same
subject In the Vatican. Domenichino's scenes of martyrdom are far from
