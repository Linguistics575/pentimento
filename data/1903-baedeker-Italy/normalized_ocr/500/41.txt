warm days it is advisable to drive thither and walk back, as other-
wise the visitor enters the cool building in a heated state and has
afterwards no opportunity of regaining the desirable temperature
through exercise. Exposure to the tmmmer-tN1rt should be avoided
as much as possible. According to a Roman proverb, dogs and for-
eigners (Inglesi) alone walk in the sun, Christians in the shade. Tha-
brellas, or spectacles of coloured glass (grey, concave glasses to pro-
tect the whole eye are best), may be used with advantage. Blue veils
are recommended to ladies. Repose during the hottest hours is ad-
visable, and a moderate siesta is often refreshing.

Great care should, also be taken in the selection of an apartment.
Carpets and stoves are indispensable in winter. A southern aspect in
winter is an absolute essential for delicate persons, and highly desir-
able for the robust. The visitor should see that all the doors and
windows close satisfactorily. Windows should be closed at night. If
there is the slightest suspicion of dampness in the bed-clothes,
recourse should be had to the warming-pan (mettere tl fuoco nel letto).

mended in preference to the Italian, whose drugs are "once dearer
and of poorer quality. Foreigners frequently suffer from diarrhea in
Italy, which is generally occasioned by the unwonted heat. The
homeopathic tincture of camphor may be mentioned as a remedy,
but regulated diet and thorough repose are the chief desiderata.'A
small portable tmsdieims-eass, such "those prepared and stocked with
tabloid drugs by Messrs. Burroughs, Wellcome, f 00., Holhom Via-
duet, London, will often be found useful. -
