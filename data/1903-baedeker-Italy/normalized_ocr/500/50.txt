ITALIAN ART. xxxix

interior, inviting, as it were, to calm enjoyment, while the cath-
edrals of the north seem to produce a sense of oppression, the pre-
dominenoe of horizontal lines, the playful application of pointed
arches and gables, of finituty and canopies, prove that an organic
coherence of the different architectural distinguishing members was
here bat little considered. The characteristics of Gothic architecture,
the towers immediately connected with the facade, and the promi-
nent tlying buttresses are frequently wanting in Italian Gothic edi-
fioes, - whether to their disadvantage, it may be doubted. It is not
so much the sumptuousness of the materials which disposes the
spectator to pronounce a lenient Judgment, as a feeling that Italian
architects pursued the only course by which the Gothic style could
be reconciled with the atmosphere and light, the climate and natural,
features of Italy. Gothic lostmuoh of its peculiar character in Italy,
bat by these deviations from the customary type it there became
capable of being nationalised, especially as at the same period the
other branches of art also aimed at a greater degree of nationality, and
entered into a new combination with the fundamental trait of the
Italian character. that of retrospective adherence to the antique.

The apparently sudden and mqTepareil-tor revival of ancient
ideals in the 13th century is one of the most interesting phenomena
in the history of art. The Italians themselves could only REVIVAL
account for this by attributing it to chance. The popular or Auemm
story was that the sculptor Niccom PISANO (ea. 1206-80) ART Inum
' wee induced by an inspection of ancient sarcophagi to exchange the
prevailing style for the ancient, and indeed in one case we can trace
back a work ot his to its antique prototype. We refer to a relief on
the pulpit in the Beptistery at Pisa, several tlgt1ras in which are
borrowed from a Bacchus vase still preserved in the Gampo Santo
of that city (pp. 408, 410). Whether Niccolo Pisano was a member
of a local school or was trained under foreign influences we are as
yet unable to determine. His sculptures on the pulpits in the
Baptistery of Pisa. and the Cathedral of Siena introduce us at once
into a new world. It is not merely their obvious resemblance to the
works of antiquity that arrests the eye; a still higher charm is
exercised by the peculiarly fresh and direct life that animates the
separate figures. By his son, Giovanni Pisano (ca.1250- ca.1328) and
his followers of the Pisan School, ancient characteristics were placed
in the background, and importance was attached solely to life and
expression (e.g. reliefs on the facade of the Cathedral at Orvieto).
Artists now began to impart to their compositions the impress of their
own peculiar views, and the public taste for poetry, which had already
strongly manifested itself, was now succeeded by a love of art also.

From this period (14th century) therefore the Italians date the
origin of their modern art. Contemporaneous writers who ob- RISE or
served the change of views, the revolution in sense of form, Mommy
and the'superiority of the more recent works in life and ex- Awr.
