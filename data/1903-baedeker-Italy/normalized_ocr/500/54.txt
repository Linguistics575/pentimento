ITALIAN ART. xliii

truth, fidelity to nature, and a correct rendering of real life in
its minuteet details are among the necessary qualities in a
perfect work. The realism of the representation is, however, 051533;;
only the basis for the expression of lifelike character and "mum;
present enjoyment. The earlier artists of the Renaissance ARTISTS TO
rarely exhibit partiality for pathetic scenes, or events which NATURE
awaken painful emotions and turbulent passions, and when such
incidents are represented, they are apt to be somewhat exagger-
ated. The preference of these masters obviously inclines to cheerful
end joyous subjects. In the works of the 15th century strict faith-
fulness, In an objective sense, must not be looked for. Whether the
topic be derived from the Old or the New Testament, from history or
table, it is always transplanted to the immediate present, and adorn-
ed with the colours of actual life. Thus Florentinee of the genuine
national type are represented as surrounding the patriarche, visiting
Elizabeth after the birth of her son, or witnessing the miracles of
Christ. This transference of remote events to the present bears a
striking resemblance to the naive and not unpleaeing tone of the
chxonieler. The development of Italian art, however, by no means
tenninetes with mere ildts1itr to nature, a quality likewise displayed
by the contemporaneous art of the North. A tmpert1eial glance at
the works of the Italian Renaissance enables one to'recogniae the
higher goal of imagination. The carefully selected groups of digni-
Mil men, beautiful women, and pleasing children, occasionally
without internal necessity placed in the foreground, pzove that at-
tmetivenegg wee pre-eminently aimed at. This is also evidenced by
the early-awakened enthusiasm for the nude, by the skill in ditspos-
ition of drapery, and the care devoted to boldness of outline and
accuracy of form. This aim is still more obvious from the keen
sense of symmetry observable in all the better artists. The indi-
vidual ilgt1ress are not coldly and accurately drawn in conformity
with systematic rules. They are executed with refined taste and
feeling; harshness of expression and unpleaeing characteristics are
aedulouely avoided, while in the art of the North (ag. in wood-cuts
and engravin gs) physiognomic fidelity is usually accompanied by ex-
treme rigidity. A taste for symmetry does not prevail in the forma-
tion of the individual figure only; obedience to rhythmical precepts
is perceptible in the disposition of the groups also, and in the com-
position of the entire work. The intimate connection between Italian
ptinting (fresco) and architecture naturally leads to the transference
of "ehtteetttral rules to the province of pictorial art, whereby not
truly the invasion of a mere luxuriant naturalism was obviated, but
the fullest scope was afforded to the artist for the execution of his
tut. For, to discover the most eifeetive proportions, to inspire life
into a scene by the very rhythm of the lineamtsntts, are not accom-
plishments to be acquired by extraneous aid; precise measurement
and etleulation are here of no avail; a discriminating eye, refined
