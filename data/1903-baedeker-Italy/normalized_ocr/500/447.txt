'It was in the nature of Titian to represent a subject like this as
a domestic pageant of his own time, and seen in this light it is ex-
ceedingly touching and surprisingly beautiful. Mary in a dress of celesti-
sl blue ascends the steps of the temple in a halo of radiance. She pauses
on the iirat landing place, and gathers her skirts, to ascend to the Me
ond.... Uniting the majestic lines of a. composition perfect in the bal.
ance of its masses with an eifect unsurpassed in its contrasts of light
and shade, the genius of the master has laid the scene in palatial archi-
tecture of grand simplicity.... The harmony of the colours is so true
and ringing, and the chords are so subtle, that the eye takes in the scene

the Ponte di Ferro (Pl. E, 6), the Pants di Rialto (Pl. ll, o, and
the Pants alla Stazione (Pl. D, 3), while small steamers and hun-
dreds of gondolas and other craft are seen gliding in every direction.
Handsome houses and magnitltsent palaces rise on the banks, for
this is the street of the Nobili, the ancient aristocracy of Venice.
