332 w. THE EMILIA.

Caesar, although the Roman language and customs had spread rapidly here,
the district was offieitr11y known as the'Province of Gaul on this side of
the Po', and the Rubicon formed the frontier of Italy-, but in B.0. 43 it
was finally united with the latter.

The institutions of antiquity litfiered here longer than in any other
art of Italy. In 402 the Emperor onoriua transferred his residence to
avenna, which also continued to be the capital of the Gothic kings.

After the overthrow of Gothic domination by Belisan'us in 539, Revenue
became the seat of the Ezarchs, and the Italian centre of the Eastern
Roman Empire. The Lombard: afterwards attacked and took possession
of it, but "was soon wrested from them by the Frankish king Pepin,
who is said to have presented the whole exarchate, ale. the tsoagbdistriet
from the Po to Aneona, to the Romish Church in 755. At flrest, however,
the real supremacy over the district was held by the Archbishop of Br
Venna. The Suns or nu: Gannon never constituted a uniform whole
like those of Milan or Venice. They consisted of a number of towns,
principalities, and monasteries, often estranged from the pontiflea1 throne,
and not unfrequently in arms against it. The pope appointed cardinals as
his legates in the different districts, but their power was limited, since the
most important prerogatives were usurped by his subjects. Meanwhile
the Towns in the Emilia prospered greatly, and became famous as cradle
of Scmncn, notwithstanding the feud between Gnelphs and Ghibellinea,
princes, nobles, and burghers, Which raged within and without their walls.
Roman Law, which after the Germanic invasion had been preserved in
several towns and districts, began to be studied trisientii1ea11y at Ramma
'in the 11th century. From the 12th cent. onwards, owing to the unsettled
condition of rights, the study became very prevalent, Bologna being its
great centre, whence a knowledge of Roman Law gradually extended over
the other countries of Europe (comp. p. 364).

The POLITICAL" Hls'romr of these districts during the middle ages re-

cords continual struggles for precedence among several rival powers. ht
long as the power of the emperors was in the ascendant, they kept the
pretensions of the popes in cheek. Nicholas m. was the first popetu
obtain control of the entire Romagna (in 1278). During the exile of the
popes at Avignon, the dismemberment of the papal dominion, seemed
imminent, but after protracted combats it was prevented by Cardinal dur
hornet, a valiant Spaniard who was sent to Italy by Innocent I V. in 1353-
Jilvest those princes, however, who consented to acknowledge the psptl
supremacy, still continued practically independent. It is diftuult to MY
how often the stubborn citizens of Bolognts were subdued by the popes,
only to rise again in successful revolt. Alexander VI. and his son Cesare
Borgia at length put an end to this inaubordinatiou about 1499; the!
.extirpated the dynasties of the Romagne with fire and sword, and from
that period the papal thsfts began to be gradually converted into a state
in the modem sense. Under Julia: If. and Leo t the pa Al supremacy
.was farther extended to Modena, Parma, and Piaeenza.' la 545 Paul Ill,
.Famese invested Pier Luigi, his natural son, with the last two as a duehy,
which, on the extinction of the Farneee in 1731, came into the possession
of the Spanish Baurbom. In Modena and Reggio, the house of: Este maim
tained its supremacy in spite of the papal pretensions, while Femn in
1597 was incorporated with the States of the Church. a

The whole of the existing institutions were at length overthrown lv
the French Revolution. NAPOLEON united Parma to France, and annexed
Modena and the Romagna to his kingdom of Italy. Though thug under
foreign domination, the country now enjoyed a period of active and useful
internal reform, which, however, was rudely interrupted by the fall of
Napoleon and the establishment of Austrian supremacy over these dutriets
Parma was awarded to Itarie Louise, and Modems to Archduke hands, the
