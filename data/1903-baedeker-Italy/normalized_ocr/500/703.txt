are of unquestioned authenticity, though they display neither the
independence of conception nor the finished mastery of his later
Roman portraits. The'thavida' (229; see below) is not free from
doubt. - The Venetian School also occupies an important place
in the Pitti Gallery. Thus t7iorgioneh, Concert (186; p. 613); Seb-
astian del Piombo'a St. Agatha (179; p. 613); Titian'a portraits
of Cardinal Ippo1tto de' Medici (201; p. 613), Aretino (64; p. 616).
and the Young Englishman (92; p. 616), his Belle (18; p. 616),
and his Mary Magdalen (67; p. 616); Tintorctto's Vulcan with
Venus and Cupid (3; p. 616). An excellent work of. later
period is Cristofano AUoriht Judith (96; p. 616). - Among the
non-Italian pictures we must mention two landscapes (9, 14;
p. 616), four portraits (86; p. 616), and the Allegory of War (86;
p. 616), by Rubens; Cardinal Bentivoglio (82; p. 616), by Van
Dyck; two portraits (16, 60; pp. 616, 616) by Rembrandt; and lutiy

The ENTRANCE (comp. p. 437) is in the B. angle of the Pints
Pitti, in the archway leading to the Boholi Garden. (Or we msy
approach the gallery by the connecting passage from the Ufflxi;
sticks and umbrellas, see p. 437).

Tickets are obtained in the vestibule, to the right. The Scale
del Re, a new staircase in pietra serene, constructed by Luigi del
Moro in 1896-96 in the style of Brunellesehi, leads to a large ante-
chamber, with a richly eoftered ceiling and a marble fountain of
the Renaissance, by Franc. di Simone O), from the Villa Renle di
Castello (p. 626). The adjoining room, with the ingress from the
1Jfiizi, contains a large basin of porphyry.

The gallery extends through a suite of splendid "looms, ricth
adorned in the baroque style by Pietro da Cortona (ea. 1600) and
embellished with allegorical ceiling-paintinge whence their names
are derived. They are sumptuousiy fitted up with marble and
mosaic tables and velvet-covered seats, but are very cold in winter.
The pictures are provided with the name of the artist and the sub-
ject represented. Catalogue (1897; in French), 2% fr.

The six principal saloons are firitt visited; the entrance was
formerly at the opposite extremity, so that the numbers of the
pictures, as enumerated below, are now in the reverse order. We
then return to the saloon of the Iliad, and enter the saloon
of the Education of J upiter o. 616), which adjoins It on the south.
In the following description, we begin in each case with the en-
trance-wall.

SALOON or THE ILIAD, so named from the subject of the fres-
coes by Luigi BahateUt. It contains four tables of coloured marbles,
lapis lazuli, granite, and jasper, and four vases of black marble
Otero entice); in the centre a Caritas in marble by lor. Bartolini.
