Italian Art.

A Historical Sketch try Professor Anton Springer.



One of the primary objects of the enlightened traveller in Italy
is _usua.11y to form some acquaintance with its treasures of art.
Even those whose usual avocations are of the most prosaic
nature unconsciously become admirers of poetry and art in
Italy. The traveller here finds them so interwoven with scenes of
everyday life, that he encounters their influence at every step, and
irwoh1ntarily becomes susceptible to their power. A single visit
can hardly tyuflets to enable any one justly to appreciate the
numerous works of art heaneetg with in the course of his-tour, nor
can a guide-book teach him to fathom the mysterious depths of
Italian creative genius, the past history of which is particularly at-
tractive; but the perusal' of a few remarks on this subject will be
found materially to enhance the pleasure and facilitate the researches
of even the most unpretending lover of art. Works of the highest class,
the most perfect creations of genius, lose nothing of their charm by
being pointed out as specimens of the best period of art; while
those of inferior merit are invested with far higher interest when
they are shown to be necessary links in the chain of development,
and when, on comparison with earlier or later works, their relative
defects or superiority are recognised. The following observations,
therefore, will hardly be deemed out of place in a work designed to
aid the traveller In deriving the greatest possible amount of enjoy-
ment and instruction from his sojourn in Italy.

The two great epochs in the history of art which principally
arrest the attention are those of Classic Antiquity, and of the Guam ARD
16th century, the culminating period of the tstr-eil Renata- mums.

for this interval not only continues to exhibit vestiges of the first
epoch, but gradually paves the way for the second. It is a common
error to suppose that in Italy alone the character of ancient art can
be thoroughly appreciated. This idea dates from the period when no
precise distinction was made between Week and Roman art, when
the connection of the former with a particular land and nation,
and the tendency of the latter to pursue an independent course
were alike overlooked. Now, however, that we are acquainted
