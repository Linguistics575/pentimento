Ventimiglia (45 ft.; w. Wntitnille), the Roman Albintemelium,
the Italian frontier-town, with 11,468 inhab. and the seat of a bishop,
lies picturesquely on a hill beyond the Roja. In the Municipio is
a small collection of Roman antiquities from Nervia (see p. 95).
The Cathedral and the little church of San Michele are interesting;
the columns of the vaulted crypt of the latter bear Roman inscrip-
tions. Fine view of the Roja valley through the Porta Romano.

vegetation is less luxuriant than on the Riviera di Ponente (p. 85);

The train crosses the insignifleant Bisagno, and passes undet
