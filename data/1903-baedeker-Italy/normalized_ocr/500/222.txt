king. Although banished for a time by the Guelph family Della Torre,
both Matteo and his sons and their posterity contrived to assert their
right to the Signoris. The greatest of this family were Iueehino Viscose"

father Gakazzo II. o. 129; d. 1378) as ruler of the W. portion of the
district of Milan. In 1885 Giovanni wrested the reins of government in
the E. portion also from his uncle Bernabo, and afterwards extended his
duchy to Piss. and Bologna, and even as far ss Perugia and Spoleto. Bis

of Italy. Since that time Italy has at once been the battlefield and the
