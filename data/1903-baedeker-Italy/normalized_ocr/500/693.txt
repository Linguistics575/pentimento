The church of Muna Maria Novella (Pl. D, 3), begun In 1278
on the site of an earlier tsdiilee, from designs by the Dominican monks
_ Fm Sisto and Pra Ristoro, and completed in the interior after 1350
by Fra Jae. Talenti, is'perhaps the purest and most elegant example
of Tuscan Gothic'. In 1456-70 it was furnished with a beautiful
marble facade (begun in the lower, Gothic portion as early as about
1350) and a tine portal, executed by Giov. Bertini from the designs
- of Leon Battiata Alberti, who iirst employed volntes here to connect
the nave and aisles. A quadrant and two concentric meridians on
the right and left were constructed by P. Ignazio Danti in 1572. -
The pointed arcades ('avts1li' Le. vaults) of black and white marble,
which adjoin the church on the lil., were originally constructed in the
14th cent, and were restored in 1870; they were used as tombs for
the nobility. The best view of the medieval building, with its

tasteful campanile (restored in 1895113 obtained from the N.E. side.

This is the picture which, according to Vasari was borne in solemn pro-
cessiou from the painter's studio to the church (ca. 1280),'followed by the
whole population, and with such triumph and rejoicings that the quarter
where the painter dwelt obtained the name, which it has ever since
retained, of Borgo Allegri' (Lindsay's'Christian Art'). In this chnpel are
