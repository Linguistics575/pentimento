Como (705 ft.), a flourishing industrial town, the capital of a
province, and the see of a bishop, with 38,174 inhab. and large silk-
faetories and dye-works, lies at the S.W. end of the Lake of Como,
end is enclosed by an amphitheatre of mountains. The small stream
Coda enters the lake here. Como is the Roman Oomum, the birth-
place ofthe elder and younger Pliny. The electrician and philosopher
Volts (1745-1826; whose Statue by P. Marehesi is in the Piazza
Volta, to the S.W. of the quay), was born at Como in the house
marked.'Casa Volta' on the Plan.

The Piazza Cavour, a large square near the harbour, and the
new streets skirting the harbour to the E. and W. of it are the most
animated parts of the town. A short street leads to the SE. from
the Piazza Cavour to the Piazza del Duomo. To the left of the
cathedral is the Brotetto (now a public offlet0, constructed of alter-
nate courses of black and white stone, and completed in 1215.

The'Cm'nlnm, built entirely of marble, is one of the best
in N. Italy. The nave was rebuilt in the Gothic style about 1396,
the facade in 1467-86 ttry Duchino da Milano); and in 1487-1626
the transepts, choir, and exterior of the nave were altered in the
Renaissance style by Tommaso Rodari. The S. portal (1491) is
built in Bramante'e style by an unknown architect; the modern
dome is by Fit. Juvara. The greater part of the sumptuous plastic
ornamentation is by Tomm. Rodari and his brother Jacopo. Over
the magnitLsent W. portal are reliefs (Adoration of the Magi) and
statuettes (Mary with Sant' Abbondio and San Protus etc.); at the
sides are statues of the two Plinys, erected in 149. The over-

deeorated N. portal (Ports. della Rana) dates from 1505-9.

In the Aria Vittorio Emanuele, which runs S.W. from the cath-
edral, is the rear of the Romanesque church of San Pedele, with a.
firm pentagona1 apse. The chief faeade of the church, in the Piazza
de Mercato, is as little worthy of attention sit the completely mod-
ernized interior. - The Palazzo Giovio, on the left, at the end of
the street, contains the Museo Civico, opened in 1897 (adm. daily
