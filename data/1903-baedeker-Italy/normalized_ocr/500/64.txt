mm MANTZBGN'A (1431-1506; at Padua and Mantua) derive
much interest from having exercised a marked inf1uenety on the
German masters Holbein and Diirer, and surpass all the other works
of his time in fidelity to nature and excellence of perspective
(p. 222). - The earlier masters of the Venetian School (VIVABINI,
Guyana) were to some extent adherents of the Paduan school, to
which Mantegna belonged, but the peculiar Venetian style, mainly
founded on local characteristics, and admirably successful In its rich
portraiture of noble and dignified personages, was soon afterwards
elaborated by GBNTILB BBLLINI (id27-i507) and his brother tho-
mnn (1428-1516), sons of Giacomo. - The Umhrian School also,
which originated at Gubbio, and is admirably represented early in
the 15th century by Ormmo Nmaa, blending with the Tuscan
school in GENTILB DA Funuxo (ca. 1370-1428) and culminating
in its last masters PIBTBO Vmcor, surnamed PBBUGINO (1446-
1524), and Bnmunnmo BETTI, surnamed PIN'rvmoomo (1454-
1513), merits attention, not only because Raphael was one of its
adherents during his flrtyt period, but because it supplements the
brotder Florentine style, and notwithstanding its peculiar and limit-
ed bias is impressive in its character of lyric sentiment and relig-
ious devotion (e. g. Madonnas). V

shows that the climax of art was still unattained. The forms em-
ployed, graceful and pleasing though they be, are not yet lofty and
pure enough to be regarded as embodiments of the highest and
noblest conceptions. The thp1res still present a local colouring,
having been selected by the artists "physically attractive, rather
than as characteristic and expressive of their ideas. A portrait style

abundant scope was therefore now afforded for the labours of the
