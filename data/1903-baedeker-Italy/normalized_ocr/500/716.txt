of Florence. CERTOSA DI VAL D'EMA. 59. Route. 523

We ascend slightly in a straight direction by a footpath to the (2 min.)
old Torre al Gallo (62lUt0, so called after a family named Gslli, and
now belonging to Count Galletti, who has restored it in the style of
the 14th century. It contains a telescope and various other remini-
scences of Galileo, who from this tower is said to have made several
Important astronomical observations. In the basement are a portrait
of Galileo by Sustcrmam, a portrait of Michael Angelo, and other
objects of little interest. The platform at the top of the tower affords
a splendid *Panorama of Florence and the valley of the Arno, ex-
tending on the E. to the mountains of Pratomagno (best by evening
light; adm. 1/2 in). - From the small piazza mentioned at p. 622 the
Via della Torre sl Gallo (views) descends in 1/4 hr. to the Viale
dei Colli (station of the electric tramway, p. 434), whence we may
proceed to the right to (10 min.) the Piazzale Michelangelo and San
Miniato (comp. Map).

The road diverging to the right from the small square at Torre s1 Gallo
leads to Ct min.) the Ville of Galileo, marked by a bust and insert tion,
where the great aetrouomer passed the last years of his 1ife (i I-W,
surrounded by a few faithful friends and latterly deprived of sight, and
where he was visited by his illustrious eoutemporsry Milton. - The road
then ascends in windin s to the church of Santa Hargherna a Honttci and
to the Villa Harocchi, w ere Francesco t7uteeiardint' is said to have flnighed
his history of Italy. Here too, on 12th Aug., 1530, the Florentinea, who
had been betrayed by their general Melsteste Baglione, signed the articles
by which the city was surrendered to the Imperial troops and thug became
subject to the rule of the Medici. From that event the house derives its
name Villa dour. Bugi√© ('vilis of lies').

(d. J LA CBBTOBA lies on the monotonous highrosd to Siena, 3 M.
from the Porta Romana (P1. A, 7; trtearn-trarnway thence, see No. 1,
p. 434; also omnibus every 1/2 hr., 25 c.; can. 6 fr., via Poggio
Imperisle a little more). The sstearn-trarnway ascends from the Porta
Romana to Gelsomino, below Poggio Imperialc (p. 622), where it
unites with the electric line from the Piazza del Duomo (No. 8, p. 434).
At Due Mrade it reaches the highroad to the Certosa. Farther on,
to the right, is the Protestant Cemetery of Florence (also used by
members of the Greek church), beyond which are the village of
Galluzzo (several unpretending trattorie, with gardens) and, a little
farther on, the brook Ema. On the hill of Montaguto, which is
clothed with cypresses and olive-trees, at the eonf1uenee of the
Ema with the Grove and 5 min. above the road, rises the imposing
Certose di Val d'Eme (375 ft.), resembling a medieval fortress. The
monastery, which is approaching dissolution and contains a few In-
mates only, was founded in 1341 by Nieeolt Aeeiajoti, a. Flor-
entine who had settled at Naples and there amassed a. large fortune
by trading. One of the monks (1-2 pers. 50 is.) shows the churches
and the monastery with its various eloisters.
