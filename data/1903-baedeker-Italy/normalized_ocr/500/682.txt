to Ham dell' fndipendensa. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 491

Adjacent to the church is the entrance to the once far-famedV
'10th of San Marco (Pl. G, 3), suppressed in 1867, and now
restored and fitted up as the Mmeo diSan Marco (adm., see p. 487;
catalogue, 1869, 11/2 fr.). The building was originally occupied
by'M1vestrtms' monks, but was transferred under Cosimo the Elder
to the Dominicans, who were favoured by the Medici. In 1437-43
it was restored in a handsome style from designs by Mielietosso,
and shortly afterwards it was decorated by Fra Giovanni Angelica
da Ficsole (1387-1465) with those charming I" Frescoes which to this
day are unrivalled in their portrayal of profound and devoted piety.
The painter Fra Bartolomeo delta Porta (1475-1517) was a monk
in this monastery from 1500 and the powerful preacher Girolamo
8avonarola (burned "the stake in 1498, see p. 442) also once

lived here.
