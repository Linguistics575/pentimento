Verona (156 ft.), the capital of a province, with 73,914 inheb. l
and a garrison of 6000 men, lies on both banks, of the rapid Ad'tge.,
which has been enclosed by high embankment, since 1896. A1
fortress of the i1rgt class, and seat of the commandant of the 3rd,
Army Corps, it is the most important and beautiful town of the;
Venetian'term ferma'. In 1527 et seq. Verona was surrounded with:
new walls and bastions by Sanmicheli. After It came into the pos-
session of the Austrians in 1814 it was again strongly fortified, end
along with Pesehiera, Mantua, and Legnago formed the famous
'_0wrdri1atera1', the chief support of Austrian rule in Italy until 1866.

Founded by the Rheetiens and Eugeneens, and afterwards ttntt by
the Celtic Cenomeni, Verona was made a Roman colony in 3.0.' md

.beceme one of the most prosperous towns of Upper Italy. Its castle pf s_en
Pietro was a residence of the Oatrogoth Theodora: the Great, the'Dletnoh
of Bern' (Le. Verona.) of German lore (d. 526). In M8 the town was "ken
by the Lombard king Albot'n, who fell a victim to the vengeance at his
wife Rosamunde, daughter of the command ruler of Verona, whom he
had forced to drink wine out of her father's skull. The Frenkiah monarch!
