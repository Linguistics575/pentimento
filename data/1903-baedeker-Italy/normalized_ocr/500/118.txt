Quarters. TURIN. 7' Route. 35

The Aria della Consolata leads from the Piazza Savoia to the N.
to the church of La Consolata. At the S. end of this street (No. 1)
is the Patasso Paesana (P1. 45; D, 2), built in the 18th cent. by
Planted, a pupil of Juvara, with an imposing hall and staircase.

La Consolata. (P1. 2; D, 2), formed by the union of three
churches, is a building in the baroque style, erected by Guarini in
1679, and decorated by Juvara in 1714. The oval church of Sant'
Andrea is edjeined by a Campanile (10th eent.?), a relic of the
convent of Suit' Andrea, and beyond the hexagonal Bantuario della
Consolata, which contains a highly revered Madonna, we enter a
circular Sacristy, forming the third member of the group. The
passage on the right is hung with votive pictures. A new chapel
to the left contains kneeling statues in marble of Maria Theresa,
Queen of Charles Albert, and Magia Adelaide, Queen of Wot or Em-
manuel II. (both of whom died in 1855), by Vela, erected in 1861.

A little to the N.E., and intersected by the Corao Regine Mu- gherite,
lies the Fuzz; EMANUELE FILInnn'ro (Pl. D, E, I, 2), adjoined on the N.
by the Piazza dei Molini. To the N. of the latter tune the Via Ponte
Hosea (P1. E, 1), on the right side of which is the church of Ban Goaehino
(Pl. 12), a basilica in the Lombard style, with a campanile 150 ft. high
erected in 1876-82 by Count Oeppi. - The street then crosses the Dora
Riparia by the Ponte Mocca, a handsome bridge of one arch, constructed
in 1830, and affording a thu, view of the Superga and of the Graian Alps.

From the Piazza Cestello (p. 28) the Via Garibaldi leads to the
Puzu DBLLO Sumo (Pl. 0, 2), with the huge Mont Cent's Tunnel
Menu ment, by Tabacehi (1879): the Genius of Science 80am above
a pile of granite rocks, on which lie the tstuptsfisil and conquered
giants of the mountain. On a tablet are the names of the engineers.

From the Wa Garibaldi we proceed to the S. by the Oorso Sic-
cardi to the Giardino della Cittade11tt (Pl. 0, D, 2), where statues
were er ected in 1871 to Btof'erio (d. 1866), poet and radical poli-
tician, and opposite, in 1873, to the jurist G. B. Cassinis. u--
Farther on, at the corner of the Aria della Cernaia, is a monument
by Gina. Bogliani (1834) in memory of Pietro Micca (P1. 35; C, 3),
the heroic'goldato minatore', who at the saerifue of his own life
saved the citadel of Turin, on 30th Aug., 1706, by springing a mine
when the French grenadhirs.had already advanced to the very gates..
Nearly opposite is a bust of Al. Borella, the author, and in the Via
della Cernaia rises the statue of General Alex. Lamarmora (d. 1855
in the Crimea), by Cassano (1867).

The Mesohio della Cittadelle (Pl. 20; O, 3) is the former en-
trance to the citadel, erected in 1565 and nearly all pulled down
in 1857. A marble tablet above the gateway commemorates the
Italian soldiers who fell in Africa in 1887. The interior accommod-
ates the Musco Nasionale d'Arh'gliertkr, a collection of ordnance from
the 14th cent. to the present day; adm. only by permissio'n from.
the'Direzione dell' Offhyina di Oosttuzione d'Arttglieria'.
