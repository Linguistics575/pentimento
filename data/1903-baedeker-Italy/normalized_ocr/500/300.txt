Lago Maggiorc. LOCARNO. 28. Route. 173

Glimete. Owing to its sheltered and sunny position on the B. slopes
of e lofty and uninterrupted mountMn-quin, Loeerno has of late ears
become a. frequented health-resort, especially for German and wise
visitors. The quarter tshitsfly selected for this purpose, with most of the
hotels and fine gardens with sub-tropieal vegetetion, is Hwauo, situeted
immediately beside the lake, to the E. of the Bmogne.

Locamo (680 ft.; pop. 3600), suitable for a prolonged stay, is
situated on the N. shore of the lake, at the mouth of the Maggia,
the deposits of which have formed a considerable delta. In the
middle ages Locarno belonged to the bishops of Como and after-
wards to Milan. It has been Swiss (Canton Ticino) since 1513,
but the character of the architecture, scenery, and population is
Italian. The expulsion of the Protestants in 1553 arrested the devel-
opment of the town.

From the pier we proceed to the W. to the Piazza Grende, or
rmrrket-plaee, in which are the former Government Buildings and the
Town Hall; the houses have arcades on the groandtioor. On the W.
side a monument has been erected to the deputy Mordaeini (d. 1888).
--- To the W. a fountain in front of the church of Sant' Antonio
(restored 1671) commemorates the Marchcse Mareaeet (d. 1854), a
benefactor of the town. - At the S.W. end of the town is the old
Caelello of the Visconti, besieged in vain by 10,000 Swiss in 1502,
partly demolished in 1518, and now occupied as a law-court and
prison. At the neighbouring & abtlimento Rimoldi (p. 172) trout-
breeding is carried on.

At Muralto £1500 inhab.) is the old parish-church of San Vittorc
(rebuilt in the 2th cent.), with an ancient crypt. On the tower is
a large relief, pljobebly representing St. Victor on horseback.

The pilgrimage-church of "Madonna del Saaso (1170 ft.), on a
wooded eminence above the town, was founded in 1569 and is en-
nuelly the scene of a festival on 8th Sept, the Nativity of the Virgin.
The ascent (1/2 hr.) leads from the Piazza Grande by the Via delle
Monache and then by a steep paved path passing to the left of
the'Scuola Normele l? emminile'. The church contains an 1ilntomb-
ment, by Ciseri (to the left), and a Flight into Egypt, by Braman-'
tino (to the right). Passing through the convent-buildings, and
turning to the left again across a wooden bridge, and ascending
rapidly, we reach (5-6 min.) 3. Chapel, commanding a charmingly
picturesque retrospect of the Madonna del $ 3380. The chapel con-
aim: a painted terracotta group of the Resurrection by Rossi (1887).
Still higher up is the chapel of Trinitd dd Monte, whence we have
1 view of the uppelj part of the Lago Maggiore. The whole walk
