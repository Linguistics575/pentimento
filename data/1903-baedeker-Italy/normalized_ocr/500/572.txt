East Quarters. RAVENNA. M. Route. 393

On the left, the swings and miredes of Christ (without 3 heard); on the
right, the history of the Passion from the Last Supper to the Resurrection
(Christ with a heard). The omission of the Crueif1xion itself points to
the origin of these mosaics "an early period when representations of the
kind were ebhorred. - The lut chapel (Cappella dolls Reuqtm) on the
left, in which the marble lining of the walls still remains, contains an
ancient marble episcopal throne, broken marble screens which belonged
to the ambo of the nave, and on the wall a. portrait of Justinian: in mosaic,
restored in 1868. At the alter ere four porphyry columns from the ancient
ciborium.

At the corner of the Via. Alberoni, a few paces to the S. of
S. Apollinare Nuovo, some remains of the Palace of Theodorie
(P1. 39; E, 5) are still extant, unless indeed, as is possible, these
date from an addition erected in the time of the exarchs.

The remains include a narrow fayrde with round-arched blind arcades
and with a central niche (exedra) in the upper story (disengaged in 1898
and at the same time freely restored), a colannnde in two stories, the
bases of two round towers, etc. (key kept by the sacristan of B. A ollinare;
fee 30-60 0.). - The palace was plundered by Beliserius in 53, and in
784 its treasures of art and most of its columns were removed to Aix-la..
Chapelle by Charlemagne. The niece and its gardens extended E. to the
Viale Pallavicino, and down tol the sea. ad oined it at the back. The
masaive principal tower was standing until 1 M.

Still farther to the S. is Santa. Maria. in Porte (Pl. F, 6) erected
in 1553 from the remnants of San Lorenzo In Cesarea (p. Air, and
restored in 1895-98. The faeade dates from 1784. The church
consists of nave and aisles with transept and an octagonal dome,
the roof borne by columns and pillars placed alternately. The choir
contains an ancient vase in porphyry. In the N. transept is a Br-
[ zantine marble relief of the Virgin (8th cent. t), - The adjacent
l Monastery, now a barreek, has two handsome Renaissance cloisters
(16th cent.). - tn the Ippodromo, behind the church, a fragment
of the town-wall (6th cent.) is preserved.

About 1/2 M. to the E. of the Porta Serrata (Pl. D, B, 1; p. 392),
r beyond the railway, is the mausoleum of Theodorie the Great
. (P1. G, 1; fee 30-60 0.), or Santa Maria delta Rotonda, as it was

called after the remains of the heretic were scattered and the church
. became a. Roman Catholic place of worship. In the middle ages it
was the church of the adjoining Benedictine monastery and the
Pantheon of Ravenna, bat it was disengaged again from the sur-
rounding buildings in 1719. Probably erected by Theodoric him-
self (about 520), it is a. two-storied structure of decagonal shape in
the style of the ancient Roman tombs, and the flat dome, 36 ft. in
diameter, consists of a single huge block of Istrian rock, which is
said to weigh 470 tons. Some remains of the colonnade which
encircled the somewhat retreating upper story are now preserved
in the interior. The substructure long lay half under water; the
upper part is approached by a double staircase of marble (1774).

About 2 M. to the NE. of the rail. station, on the Canale Cor-
eini (p. 385) and at the beginning of the Pineta (p. 395), is the
Cimitero Monumentale, laid out since 1879 01ms monuments).
