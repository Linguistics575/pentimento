Florence, formerly the capital of the Grand-Duchy of Tuscany,
in 1865-70 that of the Kingdom of Italy, and now that of the
province of its own name, the seat of an archbishop, and the head-
quarters of the VIII. Corps d'Arm√©e, ranks with Rome, Naples, and
Venice as one of the most attractive towns in Italy. While in ancient
times Rome was the grand centre of Italian development, Florence
has since the middle ages superseded it as the focus of intellectual
life. The modern Italian language and literature have emanated
ehtefly from Florence t and the fine arts also attained the zenith of
their glory here. An amazing profusion of treasures of art, such as
no other locality possesses within so narrow limits, reminiscences
of a history which has influenced the whole of Europe, perpetuated
by numerous and imposing monuments, and lastly the delightful
environs of the city combine to render Florence one of the most
interesting and attractive places in the world.

'Who can describe the enchanting view of this art-city of Tuaeaety
and the world, Florence, with its surrounding gardens? who paint the
