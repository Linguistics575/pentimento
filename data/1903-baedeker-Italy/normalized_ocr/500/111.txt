Wa Pietro Mieea, Via Garibaldi, Wa dell' Aeeademia delle tletense,

the Po, and flanked by arcades, containing shops. The University

end of which is in the Piazza Carlo Alberto o. 3 J.

The Palazzo Madame (P1. E, 3), a lofty end cumbrous pile in
the centre of the Piazza Castello, had as its nucleus a medieval castle
built on the site of the Roman Porta Deeumana (see p. 27). This
Castrum Portae Phibellonae, strongly fortified by William of Mont-
ferrat towards the end of the 13th cent., was extended on the E.
side and protected by two lofty sixteen-sided towers in 1416
by Lodovieo d'Acaja. Farther alterations were made by Charles
E mmanuel 11., but the building owes its present name to his widow,
Maria, who as Dowager Duchess f'hfadama Reale') embellished it
in 1718 by the addition of a handsome double flight of steps and the
facade on the W. side, from a design by Fit. Juvara. The apart-
ments on the first floor, which were redecorated at the same period,
were used from 1848 to 1860 as the meeting-place of the Sudinian
Senate. The palace now contains several institutions, including the
State Archive offee and an Observatory, In the towers concealed by
the W. facade. - In front of It stands a Monument to the Sardinian
Army (P1. 28), by Vine. Vela, erected by the Milanese in 1859.

or Royal Palace (P1. E, 2), a plain brick ed1flee begun in 1646 under
