eornioes, immediately above which are the handsome windows, with
their columnar mullions. The celebrated t0p. cornice (uniinitshssdJ,
by Cronaca, is an enlarged copy from an antique Roman fragment.
The fanali or corner-lanterns (by Caparra), the link-holders, and
the rings are among the finegt specimens of Italian iron-work of the
period. The court, added by Cronaca, is also impressive.

Nearly opposite, on the E. side of the piazza, is the Palauo
Strozzino (Pl. E, 5), a smaller building in a similar style, with a
tine court, ascribed to Giuliano da Majano (ca. 1460). Farther on
the street reaches the Piazza Tritt. Emanuele (p. 504).

The back of the Pal. Strozzi abuts on the VIA TORNABUONI
(Pl. D, 4, 5), the most fashionable street in Florence, with hand-
some palazzi and tine shops. On the right (No. 20), is the Palazzo
Corsi-Salviati (Pl. D, E, I), formerly T omabuoni, originally by
Michelosso, but remodelled in 1867. No. 19, on the left, is the fine
Palazzo Larderel (P1. D, 4), formerly Giaeamini, in the developed
Renaissance style, by Giov. Ant. Dosio (1558-80). No. 3, also on
the left, facing the Piazza Antinori (Pl. E, 4), is the Palazso
AntinOri (Pl. E, 4), with its elegant early-Renaissance facade, said
to have been built by Giuliano da Sangallo. - Opposite is the
church of Santi Michele e Gaetano, rebuilt by Matteo Nigetti in
1604-48. Adjacent, to the left, is the Cappella San Gactano
(sacristan in the lane to the left), containing a relief of the Madonna
by Andrea delta Robbia.

Two streets lead to the W. from the Pal. Strozzi: the Via della
Vigna Nuova, to the left, and the Via della Spade, to the right. In
the former (No. 20) is the *PaJazzo Rucellai (Pl. D, 4), erected in
1446-51 by Bern. Rosscllino from a design by Leon Battista Alberti,
who for the tirgt time here employed a combination of rustica and
pilasters. Opposite is a loggia of 1468, now built up. - In the
Via. della Spade are the former church of San Panerasio (now a cigar-
factory), in the Piazza S. Pancrazio, and the Cappella de' Rueellai
(key kept by the porter of the Pal. Rucellai; fee 1/2 fr.). The chapel
contains an ideal imitation in marble of the Holy Bepulehre at
J erusalem, a charming early-Renaissance structure, also by Alberti

The Via Tornabuoni ends on the S. in the long PIAZZA SANTA
Tnnu'rl (P1. D, 5). The N. end of the square is adorned with a
Granite Column from the Baths of Caracalla at Rome, erected here
in 1563, and furnished in 1570 with an inscription in honour of
Cosimo L, who had Just been made grand-duke by the pope. On
the summit is placed a. statue of J ustice in porphyry, by Fr. Tadda,
added in 1581. The figure was afterwards, considered too slender,
and consequently draped with a robe of bronze.

The church of *Banta. Trinith (P1. D, IV, pronouued Trtnita by
the Florentines), one of the oldest buildings in the city, was in the
