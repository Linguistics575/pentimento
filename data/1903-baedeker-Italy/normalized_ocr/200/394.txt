denth, by Scamaui, Ind innugunted by the performance of the
'adipus Tynnnua' of Sophoclel. Pulladio adhered generally to the
precepts of Vitmvius u to the construction of ancient theatres, but
the building is far trom being I mere Imitation. The Auditorium
rises In thirteen aemi-ovnl tiers, while the oreheltn and the two-
storied stnge lie 5 ft. below the level of the seats. The three door-
openings at the hunk of the stage afford view: of ucending: treets,
in curiously deceptive relief.
