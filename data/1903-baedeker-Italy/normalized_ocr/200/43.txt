_ nriminate contusion of Greek uni anau styles in no longer to be
Gnu "m apprehended. We are now well aware that the highest per-
Bonn fection of Intient architecture is realised in the Humane
SH"! DIB-t temple alone The Dorie order, in which majestic gravity is
""mm" expressed by massive proportions and by a symmetrical de-
coration t which at the same time subserves a prmtical purpose,
and the Ionic structure, with Its lighter and more graceful char-
acter, exhibit I creative spirit entirely different from that mani-
tested in the sumytuons Roman tsilititas. Again, the most v-luable
collection of encient sculpture: in Italy ie incepnble of Mror6ia1g so
admirable an insight into the development of Greek "t In the soul }; -
turee of the Parthenon and other i'ngmente of Greek temple-Irchi-
tecture preserved in the British Museum. But, while instruction is
MroriUd more Ibundlutly by other than Itelien sources, andent art
is perhaps thoroughly admired in Italy alone, where works ot art
encounter the eye with more Ippropriete Idjuncte, anti where climate,
scenery, Ind people materially contribute to intensify their imprms-
siveneea. An miditioml facility, moreover, in MforMi1 by the giroum-
etlnee, that in aoeordmce with In adminhle custom of classic
antiquity the once perfected type of I pllatic Ap1re we: not agein
arbitrarily ahmdoned, but rigidly Idhererl to, end continually re-
produced. Thus in numerous cues, where the more luck!" Greek
originll had been lost, It was preserved in subsequent copies; and
even in the works or the Romnu imperill Ige Hellenic creldve talent
is still rettoettri1.
This supremacy of Greek intellect in Itnly wu established in a
an"; twofold manner. In the lint piece Greek eoioniate intro-
wrura "uiuced their ancient nltive style into their new homes. This
Aar. is proved by the existence of several Dorie temples in Sicily,
by tho so-tallied Temple of Neptune at Pautum, us well n by the
ruins It Metaponlum. But, in the second place, the art of the Greeks
did not attain its universal supremacy in Italy till a later period,
when Hellas, nationally mined, had learned to obey the dicatee of
her mighty conqueror, and the Romans had begun to combine with
their poiiticll superiority the rMmmuynta of more advanced culture.
The ancient scenes of artistic activity in Greew (Athem for example)
became re-peop1m1 "the can of Rome; Greek works of art and
Greek Artists were introduced into Italy; and ostentltinua pride in
the mNp1itietmee of booty acquired by victory led by In any trunni-
tlon to a taste for such objects. To surround theineelvee with artistic
decorltion thus gradually became the universal cuetmn of the Ro-
mans, and the foundution of public monuments came to be regarded
es an indispensable duty of government.
Although the Rounu works of art of the imperill epoch era
Bonn Mf1ir'urttti in originality compared with the Greek, yet their
Axomnc- nuthore never degenerate into mare copying, er entirely re-
