xxxiv ITALIAN ART.

Roman art, and I sudden and spontaneous invention of I new style.
But the eye and the hand Idhete to custom more tenleionlly then
the mind. While new ideas, and altered views of the ehnacter of
the Deity and the destination or man were'srstsrtaintrd, the wanted
tonne were still necessarily employed in the expression of these
thoughts. Moreover the heathen sovereigns had by no means heen
nnremittingly hoisti1irto 13hristianity he most bitter persecutions
did not take place till the 3rd century, Ind the new doctrine- were
permitted to expand, take deeper root, Ind organise themselves in
the midst of heathen society. The consequence wen, that the trunn-
ition from heathen to Christian Mela of Art wee I gradual one, end
thet in point of form early Christian art continued to follow up the
lessons of the ancient. The best proof of this is Mrordeil by the
paintings in the Roman CArAcemae, the bnrial-plntes of the early
Christian community In these the Irtietic principles of pagan
antiquity are adhered to, Mike in decorative forms, design, ehoioe
of colour, grouping of figures, and treatment of subject. Even the
SAneormous chLr-rvnee of the 4th and 5th centuries differ in
purport only, and not in technic-l treatment, from the type exhibited
in the tomb-re1ieis of heathen Rome. Five centuries ehpeed be-
fore a new utistic style sprang up in painting and in the greetly
neglected pllstic arts. Meanwhile architecture had developed iteelf
mrmrmuuarately with the requirements of Christian worship, And,
in connection with the new modes of building, painting Icqnired a
different character.

courts "judicature and public lasemhly-hnlle. The belief that
these were afterwards fitted up tor the purposes of Christian worship
is now exploded, but in their main features they served as models
for the construction of Christian churches. After the 4th cent.
the following became the established type of the Christian has-
ilica. In front in a quadrangular fore-court (atrium), of the enme
width as the basilica itself, surrounded with an open oolonnede
And provided with a fountain (cantharns) for the ahlutiann of the
devout. This forms the approach to the interior of the church,
which usually consisted of a neve and two aisles, the letter lower
than the former, and eepanted from it by two rows of columns, the
whole terminating in a semicircle (eysie). In front "the Ipee there
was sometimes a transverse space (tranaept); the altar, tsurmtrustteit
by a columnar structure, occupied a detached position in the Ipee;
the space in front of it, bounded by emcelli or railings, was
destined for the choir of ordieitrting priests, Ind contained the two
