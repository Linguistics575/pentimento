Whether the pnlm be due to Micheal Angelo or to Replies! (1483-
i520) Among the artists of Italy is a question which formerly gave
rise to vehement discussion among artiste and: mlteuxe. Run".
The admirer of Michael Angelo need, however, by no mean:
he precluded from enjoying the works of Raphael. We now know
tlut it in { u more Idvnntegeoue to form m ncqmintmce with
elch mute: in his peculiar province, than uixionsly to weigh
their respective merits; and the more minutely we examine their
works, the more tlrm1y we Me persuaded that neither in any way
obstructed the progress of the other, and that a 8o-tyaued higher
wmhination of the two styles wee impossible. Michael Angela's
unique position among hie "onttsmportrries was such, that no one,
ihphml not excepted, wee entirely exempt from his intiueaee;
bat the result of preceding development was turned to the best
Imunt, not by him, but by Raphnel, whose eueceptible Ind
beriminsting character enabled him at once to combine i1ifrisrent
tendencies within himself, and to avoid the faults "his pre-
decessors. Raphael's pictures Ire replete with indications of pro-
found "ntimept, but his imagimtion was so constituted that he did
not distort the ideas which he had to embody in order to accommo-
ate them to his own views, but rather strove to identify himself
with them, end to reproduce them with the utmost tiilelity. In the
me of Raphael, therefore, a knowledge of his works tad the en-
joyment of them are Ilmaet inseparable, mvl it is iiiftiiaUt to point
out my single sphere with which he we:'sspet0lly familiar. He
presents to us with equal enthusiasm picture: of the Madonna, And
the myth of Cuyid and Psyche; in great cyclic'sompositions he is
Is brilliant es in the limited sphere of portrHinting, "one
time he uppem to attach paramount importance to strict'neee "
style, "ohiteetural emngement, symmetry of groups, etc. "t at other
times one is tempted to believe that he regarded colour as his most
effective euxilinry. Hie excellence consists in his rendering equal
justice to the most vnried subjects, and in each case n unhesitat-
ingly pursuing the right course, both in his Bpprelumsion of the
idea Ind selection of form, as it he had never followed my other.

Little is known of Raphael's private life, nor is it known by
Whit muster he was mined liter the death of Giovanni, his father
(WU). In 1500 he entered the studio of Peruyina (p. liii), and
pmhabiy soan nssisted in the execution of some of the works of his
Fro1iiiis master. Ot Raphael's early or Umbrian period there are
Emnples in the Vatican Gallery (Coronation of Mary) and the Bren
at Milan (8posauiio of the Madonna, 1504). On settling at Florence
