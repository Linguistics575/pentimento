II. Purina Ind Pun of Tour.

Semen. As a general rule, the spring and autumn months are
the best season { or I tour in North Italy, especially April and May
or September and October. Winter in Lombardy (apart from a few
favoured spots on the shore: of the lakes) Ind Piedmont ie genenlly
a much colder season then it is in England, but the Ligurinn Riviera
(Genoa excepted) affords pleasant and sheltered quarters. The
height of summer can hardly be remmmended for travelling. The
scenery, indeed, is then in perfection, and the long day! are hailed
with utisfection by the enterprising traveller; but the ttSree rays of
an Italian sun seldom fail to impair the phyeicll and mental energies.

Plan. The following short itinerary, beginning Ind ending at
Milan, though very far from exhausting the henutiee "North Italy,
includes'most of the plneee usually visited, with the time required
for a glimpse "each.
