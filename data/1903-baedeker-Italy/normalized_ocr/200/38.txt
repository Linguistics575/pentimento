CLIMATE. xxvii

quent; and the humidity "the atmosphere, occasioned in put by
the numerous canals and riots-marshes, is Ilsa very considerable.
A prolonged residence in Turin "Milan should therefore he Ivoidud
by invelide, while even robust travellers should be on their guard
egnimt the trying climate. As we appxonch the Adriatic Sea the
climate of the Lombard pleiu laees its continental character end
nppmxjmates more closely to thnt of the rest of the peninsula. The
climatic peeuliarities of Venice Ire described at p. 264.

As soon as we erase the mountains whieh bound the S. margin
of the Lombard plain and teach the Mediterranean coast, we ttnd b
remarkable change in the climettc conditions. Here an almost un-
interrupted series of winter-resorts extends Ilong the Lig mien
Riviera as far S. as Leghorn, and these are rapidly increasing
both in number and popularity. The - or the mild and pleas-
Int climate at these places is not far to seek. The Maritime
Alps and the Ligurien Apeunines form such "admirable screen
on the N., that the cold N. winds which'pues these mountains do
eat Much the district immediately at their feet, bat are first per-
ceptible an the eel 6-10 M. from the coast. It is of no unfrequent
occurrence in the Riviera that the harbours Ire perfectly smooth
while the open sea is agitated by a brisk tempest. Most of the town-
and villages on the coast lie in "estsent-sUped hays, opening
towards the 8., while on the landward side they are protected by
an amphitheatre of hills. These hills are exposed to the full farce
of the sun's rays, and the limestone of which they are composed
absorbs an immense amount of heat. It is therefore not to be
wondered "that these hothouees of theRiviera show a higher ttm-.
perature in winter then many places much further to the S. Thus,
while the mean tempenture "Rome in the three coldest months fr
MP Fahr., that of the Riviera is 48-60" (Newt W', San Remo W';
Pisa, on the other hand, only 42").

It would, however, be a mtstnke to suppose that this strip of
west is entirely free from wind. The rapid heating and cooling of
the strand produces numerous light breezes, while the ruefeetion
of the mule! of ti! try the strength of the sun gives rise to Itrong
current: rushing in from the E. 1nd W. to supply the vacuum.
The most notorious of these coaet-winds is the Mistral, which is
"its went at Avignon and other places In the BMrus Valley (see
Baedeger'e Southern France). The N.E. wind on the contrary
is much etrongex in Alueio and Sun Remo than on the coast of
Provence. The Sciwcco "known on the Lignxian. coast is by no
mean the dry and parching wind experienced in Sicily and even
at Rome; passing Is it does over immense tncts of see, it is gener-
ally chuged with moisture and is often followed by rein.

The prevalent belief that the Bivien ha I moist climate, on
: cwnnt or its proximity to the eel, is mtural but erroneous. The
atmosphere, on the contrary, is rather dry, especially in the W.
