ITALIAN ART. iv

and psinting. Nor is an inspection of this illustrious muter's
works calculated to dispel the doubt. Unnatuul end arbitrary
futures often appear in Juxtngosltlon with what is perfect, pro-
(oundly tsignimmst, Ind faithfully conceived. As in the case of
Leonardo, we shlll itud that it is only by studying the master's bio-
gnphy thst we can obtsin en explsnation of these nnomslies, Ind
meh I true appreciation of Michael Angela's artistic greatness.
Educated as a sculptor, he exhibits partislitr to the nude, sud
treats the drnyery in many respects ir1mmmtly from his professioml
brethren. But, like them, his aim is to inspire his figures with life,
and he seeks to attain it by imparting to them an imposing and im-
ymsive ehsracter. Atthe same time he occupies anisolated position,
"variance with mlny of the tendencies of his age. Nsturslly pre-
disposed to melsneholy, concealing a gentle and slmost tsirtsrnirute
tempersment henesth a mask of austerity, Michael Angelo w" con-
hmrtil in his peeulisrities bythe political and ecclesiastical trirtmm-
atsnces of his time, and wrapped himself up within the delaths of
his awn absorbing thoughts. His sculyturs most clearly manifests
tint profound sentiment to which, however, he often "eridteml sym-
metry of form. His tigrsres are therefore anomalous, exhibiting I
grind conception, but no distinct or tnngible thoughts, and least of
all the traditional ldess. It is iiiftteult now to fathom the hidden
sentiments which the master intended to embody in his stntues and
yietures; his imitators seam to have seen in themnothing butmsssive
uni clumsy form s, and soon degenented into meaningless mannerism.
Th6 deceptive affeut produced by Michael Angela's style is best ex-
tsmIUit1tsd by some of his later works. His Mans in San Pietro in
Viuwli is of impossible proportions; such a mm can never have
existed; the smell head, the huge arms, end the gigmtic torso Ire
1stterly disproportionate; the robe which falls over the celebrated
knee could not be folded as it is represented. Nevertheless the
work is grsui1V impressive; and so also are the Manummu of the
Medici in the New Secristy of San Lorenzo st Florence (p. 500),
in spite of the foxeed attitude sud arbitrary moulding of some of
the "urea. Michsel Angelo only isatsriiitass securscy of detail in
order to enhance the aggregate tstreet. Had so great and talented n
mater not presided over the whole, the danger of an iniUted style
veuld hue been incurred, the forms selected would have been
exaggerated, and s professional mmnedsm would hnve been the
result. Michael Mgelo's numerous pupils, in their anxiety to
follow the example of his Lest Judgment in the Sistine, suceeeded
ally in representing complicated grouys of unnaturally foreshort-
cued nude Mures, while Baceio Bmdinelli, thinking even to surpass
Michel Angelo, produced in his group of Hercules and Cam: (in
the Piszz: della Signoria at Florence) A mere esricnture of his model.

Michael Angelo lived and worked at Florence and Rome alter-
nmly. We thid him slresdy in Rome at the age "21 years (1496),
