After the storm raised by Sevonarole hail passed over, glorious days
were in store for Florence. Leonardo, after his return from Milan,
and Michael Angelo were engaged here on their cartoon: for the
detention of the great hell in the Palauo Vecehio (p. 446); and it
was their example, and more particularly the stirnu1sting 1nt1ueuee
of Leonardo, that awakened the genius and called forth the highest
energies of all their younger contemporaries.

The fame of the Florentine school was at this period ohietip

quillity of expression, end the architectural symmetry of grouping
in which he excelled. His tinest pictures are the Christ with the four
Saints, the Descent from the Cross (or Pietra); the St. Mark in the Pitti
Gallery, and the Madonna in the cathedral It Lueea. The traveller
would not do justice to Andrea del Sarto, a master of rich colouring,
wane he to confine his attention to that artist's works in the two
great Florentine galleries. Sarto's Freeway in the Annunziala
(p. 483) end in the Scalzo (History of John the Baptist, p. 497) are
among the tlnest creations of the eim1uemsnto. Such, too, was the
stimulus given to the artists of this period by their great contem-
poraries at Florence that even those of subordinate merit have 1MMttL-
sionally produced works of the highest excellence, as, for instance,
the Salutation of Annsn'rmux end the Zenoblue pictures of IU-
nom'o Gemnmnuo in the Uftizi. The last masters of the local
Florentine school were Powronmo and ANGELO Ihumvaro.

Raphael's style was more particularly inmurueed by his relations
to Fra Bartolomeo, and the traveller will ttad it most interesting
to compare their works and to determine to what extent each derived
suggestions from the other. The best authenticated works in
Italy of Raphael's Florentine period are the Madonna del Granduca
(Ping, the Madonna del Cardcllino (Uffizt0, the Entomliment (ma.
Borghese in Rome), the Puddle in the Vatican, the portraits of
Angela and Maddalena Dom' (Pitti), and the Portrait of Himself
(Unui; p. 458). The Portrait of a Lady in the Pitti gallery is of
doubtful origin, end the Madonna det Baldaeehino in the same gal-
lery was only begun by Raphael.

When Raphael went to Rome in 1508 he found a large circle
