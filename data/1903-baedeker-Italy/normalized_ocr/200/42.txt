Italian Art.

A llistoricel Sketch by Professor Anton Springer.



One of the primary objects of the enlightened tnveljer in Italy

is pluelly to form some acquaintance with its treasures of nt.
Even those whose usual evocation: are of the moat prosaic
ntture unconsciously become admirers of poetry and ut in
luly. The tnveller here finds them so interwoven with scenes of
everyday life, that he encounters their iniluenet, at every step, and
involuntarily becomes susceptible to their power. A single visit
an hardly Buftiia, to enable my one justly to Appreciate the
numerous works of art he meets with in the course of his tour, nor
an e gnide-book teach him to flthom the mysterious depths of
lulieu creative genius, the pest history of which is particularly at-
mctive; but the perusal of I few remarks on this subject will he
lonnd materielly to enhlnce the pleuuxe end feciiitete the researches
of even the most 1uq? retesni1ing lover "art. Works ofthe highest class,
the most perfect ere-tions of genius, lose nothing of their chem by
being pointed out "specimens of the best period of art; while
those of inferior merit are invested with far higher interest when
they are shown to be necessary links in the chein of development,
And when, on 1romparisor1 with audit" or inter works, their rehtive
delecte or superiority Ire recognised. The following observations,
therefore, will hardly be deemed oat of piece in a work designed to
aid the traveller in deriving the greatest possible Amount of enjoy-
ment and instruction from his sojourn in Itlly.

The two great ewchs in the history of art which princiyally
meet the attention ere those of Classic Antiquity, end of the cuumw
likh century, the culminating period of theeo-called Renuiu- R-
me. The intervening 517109. of more then I thousand yeue M303

hr this intern! not only continues to exhibit vestiges "the ttrat
epoch, but gradually paves the way for the second. It is e common
error to Inp'pole that in Italy alone the character of ancient ext can
be thoroughly Appreciated. This idea antes from the period when no
piecing distinction was nude between Week and Roman art, when
the eonnection of the former with a puticulex lend and nation,
Ind the tendency or the latter to pursue an independent course
were elike overlooked. Now, however, that we are acquainted
with more numerous Greek originals, Iud heve eequiled e
ioeper insight into the development of Hellenic art, bn indis-
