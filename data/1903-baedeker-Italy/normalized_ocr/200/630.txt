Florence (18011.), Itnlinn Fireme, formerly Fianna, trom the
Latin Florentia, justly entitled'la bella', is situated in 43" 46' N.
latitude, Ind 11" 2i' B. longitude, on both banks of the Arno, an in-
isigniiieant river except in rainy weather, in a charming valley of
moderate width, p1eturissqmrly enclosed by the Ipurs ot the Apen-
nines, the highest visible peek of which [ Monte Moreno, p. 526)
rises to the N. On the S. the heights rise more immedlttely from
the river, on the N. they are 3-4 M. distant, while townde the
N.W., in the direction of Prato and Pistols, the valley expands eon-
eidenbly. The sudden transitions of temperature which frequently
occur here are trying to person in delicate health. The plensentest
months are April, MIY, end the first half of June, September,
October, and November. The winter is dfsproportioastety cold,
the mean temperature of January being about MP Fahr.; July
(mean 78"; maximum In 1897, 103Â°) and August are very hot, and
colds are most dangerous at this sensou. - The drinking-water of

Florence, mainly tiltped water from the Arno, is not considered
very wholesome.

During the struggle for the creation of a'United Italy' Florence
was for. short time (1864-71) the capital of the country; but this
honour, though it gave 5 momentary stimulus to the progress of the
city, ultimately (1878) resulted in a timmeial collapse, from which it
has only now recovered. As early as the 15th cent. Florence wntlined
90,000 inhnh.Y in 1881 It had 168,915, and in 1901 the number was
198, 408. The Florentinee have ever been noted for the vigour of
their reasoning powers and for their pre-eminence in "time talent.
