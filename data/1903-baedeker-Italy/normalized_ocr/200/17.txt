vi PREFACE.

HEIGHTS are given in English feet (iJihtgl. ft.---- 0,3048
metre), end Dismmms in English miles (comp. p. ii). The
Poynmmous given are those of the communal districts
femmsni) according to the census of 1901; the populations of
the separate towns and villages fyopoldeione aggltrmerata),
which are usually considerably lower than the figures in the
Handbook, have not yet been published.

HOTELS (comp, p, xix). Besides the modern palatial and
expensive establishments the Handbook also mentions a Be-
lection of modest, old-fashioned inns, which not unfrequently
afford good accommodation at moderate charges. The asterisks
indicate those hotels which the Editor has reason to believe
from his own experience, as well as from information supplied
by numerous travellers, to be respectable, clean, reasonable,
and fairly well provided with the comforts and conveniences
expected in an up-to-date establishment. Houses of a more
primitive character, when good of their class, are described as
'fair' or'very fair'. At the same time the Editor does not doubt
that comfortable quarters may occasionally be obtained at inns
which he has not recommended or even mentioned. The
average charges are stated in accordance with the Editor's
own experience, or from the bills furnished to him by trav-
ellers. Although changes frequently take place, and prices
generally have an upward tendency, the approximate thate-
ment of these items which is thus supplied will "least enable
the tmveller to form an estimate of his probable expenditure.

To hotel-proprietors, tradesmen, and others the Editor
begs to intimate that a. character for fair dealing and courtesy
towards travellers forms the sole passport to his eouttnend-
ation, and that advertisements of every kind are strictly ex-
eluded from his Handbooks. Hotel-keepers are also warned
against persune representing themselves 9.9 agents for
Baedeker's Handbooks.
