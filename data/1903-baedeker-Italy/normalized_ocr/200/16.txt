574* PREFACE.

l9 0 3..

jk; elljecte of the Handbook for Italy, which consists of
three volumes, each complete in itself, are to supply the trtw-
ellei- with some information regarding the culture and nt of
the people he is about to visit; as well as regarding the nat-
ural features of the country, to render him as independent as
possible of the services of guides and viutstir-do-pItuse, to pro-
tect him against extortion, and in every way to aid him in
deriving enjoyment and instruction from his tour in one of
the most fascinating countries in the world.

The Handbook is founded on the Editor's personal ac-
quaintance with the places described, most of which he has
repeatedly and carefully explored. As, however, changes
are constantly taking place, he will highly appreciate any
communications with which travellers may kindly favour
him, if the result of their own observation. The information
already received from correspondents, which he gratefully
acknowledges, hat in many cases proved most serviceable.

The present volume, corresponding to the sixteenth Ger-
man edition, has, like its predecessor, been thoroughly revised
and considerably augmented. Its contents have been divided
into groups of routes arranged historically and geographically
{ Hsdmonh Ligun'a, Lombardy, sztia, The Emilia, and
Tuscany), each group being provided with e. prefatory outline
of the history of the district. Each section is also prefaced
with a list of the routes it contains, and may be removed
from the volume and need separately if desired.

The introductory article on Art, which has special re.
ference to Northern Italy and Florence, and the Brt-l0toriiyB1
notices preiixed to the descriptions of the larger towns and
principal pioturts-gssllaritss are due to the late Profeuor
Springer, of Leipzig. In the descriptions of individual pie-
tures the works of Morel", Crowe and Cavalcaulle, andBurck-
hard! have been laid extensively under contribution, and also
occasionally those of Ruskin and others.
