VIII. Cycling.

The environs of Milan, Turin, Verona, and Bologna, the neigh-
bourhood of the Italian Lakes, and the Riviera all offer many attrac-
tions for the cyclist. The roads are good on the whole, though often
very dusty in summer (especially in the N. Italian plain) and
wrrespondingly muddy in wet weather. - English riders should
remember that the rule of the road in Italy is the reverse of that
in England: keep to the right on meeting, to the left in overtaking
another vehicle.

The unattached cyzlist on entering Italy with his wheel must
deposit 42 fr. 60 tr. with the custom-houee authorities, which sum
is returned to him (though sometimes not without t1iituruW1e s), when
he quits the country. Members of well-known eyelist associntions,
such as the Cycliala' Touring Club (London; "Vioton'e Sh, S.W.)
or the Touriny Club de France (Paris; 10 Place de la Bourse), are7
however, spared this formality, on conditions explained in the
Mndbooks of these clubs. A "ertitieete of re-exportation (eertilieato
di uarico) should always be obtained, as otherwise the club of
which the cyclist is a member, may be called upon subsequently to
pay the duty as above.

On the railways cycles are treated as ordinary passengers' lug-
gage (p. xviii). Valises should not be left strapped to cycles when

sent by rail, owing to the righ of theft fp. xviii).
