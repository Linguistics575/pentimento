Magghre, It was at that period the Ingest church in existence
and it is still one of the largest and most sumptuous in the world.
This huge structure cover: In are: of 14,000 sq. yds. (of which about
2400 sq. yds. Are taken up by the walls and yiiius), and holds about
$ 0,000 people. The interior is 162 yds. in length, the tnnsept
96 yds. in breadth, the _ 73 yds. in breadth; nave 157 ft. in
height, 18 yds. in breadth. The dome is 220 ft. in height, the tower
360 ft. above the pavement. The roof, marble like the rest of the
building, is adorned with 98 turrets, and the exterior with upwaxde
of 2000 statues in marble. The steined-gluee windows in the choir
are said to be the largest in the world. The eathodul was founded
by the splendour-loving' Galelzzo Viswnti in 1386. The genenl
style of the building is Gothic, but shows many peculiarities. The
author of the original design is unknown; Marco da Campioue ft.
1390) and Simone da Organigo (who wns 1murter-baiUer in 1387)
have been named, bat without any positive proof. The building
progressed but slowly, owing to the dimensions between the Italian
architeete and the Germnn and French masters (Nicholas de Bana-
venturi, Ham van Freiburg, Heimich van thntind, Ulrich van Iii: -
sirsgen, Jean Mignot, Ind others, who were frequently called to
their aid. Between 1459 and 1 0 Guiniforte Solari is mentioned
among the superintendents or the huilding-opent'lone; about 1500
Francuea di Giorgio of Stems and Giov. Ant. Amadeo appear to
have been Isaocieted in the that oiiles; and after them the work
was conducted by Dolcebuono, Cricinforo Solari, etc. The cryyt and
the hnptistery, the style of which is quite out of harmony with the
general design of the building, were added in the second half of
the 16th cent. by Pellegrino Tibaldi, who also laid down the marble
pavement and designed a baroque facade. The church was Bon-
secrated by Sen 03110 Borromeo on Oct. 20th, 1577. The dome was
begun in 1759 by the architects Croce end Mania, and was finished
in 1775. The facade, begun in 1615 after Tibuhii's design, remained
umrompiettsd, until in 1805 Napoleon (whole mnrhle statue, in
antique costume, is among those on the roof) caused the works to
be resumed, with modiMatiort8 by Amati. But this entire facade
is being gradually removed since 1900, and a new one in strict har...
mony with the style of the rest of the church erected weanling to
the plan of the young architect Giuseppe Brentano (d. 1889), whose
design won the flrst prize in an open competition in 1888.

The church is cruciform in shape, with double aisles and a tun-
sept, the latter also mutkedwith aisles. The Immune is supported
by fifty-two pillars, each 16 pnoes in circumference, the summits
of which are adorned with canopied niches with statues instead of
capitals. The pavement consists of mosaic In marble of ditrtrreut
colours.
