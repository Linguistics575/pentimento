secessible) vie with Raphael's works in tenderness and greoe. A
still more numerous circle of pupils, however, soon assembled tround

Attended by this distinguished retinue, Reyheel enjoyed MI the
honours of a prime, although, in the Roman at world, Bramante
(p. xlvii) and Michael Angelo occupied an equally high rank. The
latter did not, however, trench on Raphael's province as a painter
so much as was formerly supposed, and the jealousy of each other
which they no said to have entertained was probably "hitsiiy etrntined v
to their respective followers. Raphael had doubtless exum'ued the
ceiling of the Sistine with the utmost care, and Wes indebted to
Michael Angelo for much instruction; but it is very important to
note that he neither followed in the footsteps, nor suffered his native
genius to be binssed in the slightest degree by the example of his
great rival. A signal proof of this independence is sitoriity1 by the
Gibyla which he painted in the church of Santa Maria della Pace in
1514, end which, though conceived in a very different spirit from
the imposing figures in the Sistine, ll'e not the less admirable. In
order duly to Ippreciste the works produced by Raphael Aiming his
Roman period, the traveller should "hitrfly direct his attention to
the master's frescoes. The Stanza in the Vatican, the Maury, the
Loyye, the finest work of decont'lve nrt in existence, the Dome
Monies in Santa Maria dei Popolo (Cayp. Chigi), tsnd' the Galatm
Ind Myth of Psyche in the Famesins together constitute the treasure
bequeathed to Rome by the genius of the prince of painters. (Far-
ther pstticuhrs as to these works will be found in the second volume
of this Handbook.)

Many, and some of the best, of Raphael's eesel-pictm'es of his
Roman period are now beyond the Alps. Italy, however, still pos-
sesses the Madonna della Sadie, the most mundane, but most
ehmning of his Msdonms (Pitti), the Madonna dell' Impannam
(Pitti), the Madonna col Divine Amore (Naples), the Madonna di
Fatigue and the Iran8litrtsratiots (in the Vatican), 8t. Cecilia (Bo-
logs"), and the Young tlt. John (Uftizij. The finest of his portraits
ire those of Pope Julius II. (Umzi) and Leo t with two Cardinals
Witti). Besides these works we must also mention the -lled
anarimz (in the PM. Barberini at Rome), Ind the Portrait of a
Lady (Pitti, No. 245), which may represent the same origins ] and
also recalls the Sistine Madam".

After Raphael's death the progress of Irt did not merely come
to I stendstill, bat a period of rapid DECLINE set in. The conquest
and plundering of Rome in 1527 entirely paralysed all nrtletic effort

Italy. Raphael's pupils migrated from Rome to various provincial
