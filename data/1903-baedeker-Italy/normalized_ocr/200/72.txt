Splin. The natural result "this wns that the pnintiug of portraits
and of mythologbul subjects engrossed the greater part of his time
end talents. That Titian's genius, however, was by no means alien
to religion and deep feeling in art, and that his imagination was as
rich and powerful in this turld as in pourtraying realistic and een-
unlly nttr-etive forms of existence, is proved by his eceleeiletiul
paintings, of which the finest are the Penn) Madonna (p. 311), the
Hnrtyrdom of St. Lawrence o. 301), the Presentation in the Temple
(r. 290), end the Assumption (p. 286) at Venice.

Owing to the soundness of the principles on which the Venetian
mhool wn lnsed, there is no wide gulf between its masters of the
highest end thone of secondlry rank, as is "often the cute in the
other Italian echooll; end we Accordingly ilnd that works by Lo-
uno Lone, Ssmarux DEL Plano (p.1vil), the Bomuzros, Pox-

Bren PAOLO 0mm, sumamed Vmwrmen Ct528-88), the lut great

delicate silvery tint: and the spirit and richness of his compositions.

Grrreggio, us well ta subsequent Venetian mnsters, were fre-

make the great cinqueeentists their princiytl study will doubtless
be leth to examine the works of their successors. MNpriiiiumt da-
wntive works Ire occasionally encountered, but the tutu is
oirepded by the undisgrdsei1 love of pomp and suprsrf1isU1 man-
nerlsm which they genernlly display. Artiste no longer ear-
nestly identify themselves with the ideas they embody; they
meehurieally reproduce the customary themes, they lose the desire,
And finally the ability to compose independently. They are, more-
over, "tttyieut in taste for beauty of form, which, as is well known,
is most attractive when most simple and natural. Their teehnlul
skill is not the result of mature experience, slowly acquired and
justly vnlued: they came into eley possession of great resources at
art, which they rrivotous1y and unworthily squander. The quaint,
the extr-vegtnt, the Piguant Ilene stimulates their taste; rapidity,
not excellence of workmanship, is their aim. Abundant specimens
of this mannerism, extrmpliiled in the works of Zvcceno, D'Anrmo,
Tmrmsrx, and others, are encountered "Rome and Florence

due produce 1 less unflvounble impression does not alter their
general ponition, "it is not want of talent so much "of con-
seiaatitrmmess which is attributed to these artists.
