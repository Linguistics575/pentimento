neglect of external Architecture, the chief importenee being It-
uehed to the interior, the decorations of which, however, especially
in only mediavei times, were often procured by plundering the
ancient Roman tsdiihees, Ind tteneferring the spoil to the ehurehel
with little regard to harmony of style And materiel. The most Ne
pmpriete ornaments of the churches were the metallic objects, Inoh
"amuse end iuetree, end the tapestry bestowed on them by pepei
piety; while the chief decoration of the wells ooneieteti of moeliu,
apeci-iiy those covering the background of the apee and the
'triumphsl' etch which eeperatee the Ipee from the nave. The
moseiee, Is far at ielet es the materiel wee concerned, were of I
sterling monumental character, end contributed to give rise to a
new style of pictoriel art; in them ancient tradition was for the
fmt time ehmdoned, end the hush end austere style erroneously
termed Byzantine gradmliy introduced.

Christian ext originated at Rome, but its development Wll
actively promoted in other Iteiieu districts, especially "RAVENIIA,
where during the Oetrogothie eupremeey (493-589), M well
"under the eneceediug Byzentine empire, architecture
us zellouely eultivlted. The "silie-type was there more
highly metered, the extemll uehiteotnre enlivened by iow arches
end projecting buttresses, and the cepitele of the columns in the
interior appropriately moulded with relerence to the euperineumb-
ent arches. There, too, the ext of mosaic painting wu sedu-
lonaly cultivated, exhibiting in its euiier specimens (in the Bap-
tWrg ofthe Orthodox and Tomb of Guild Placidta) grater teohnicel
excellence and better drawing than the isontetrqr0ramsous Roman
works. At Revenue the Western style also eypeeu in eombinetion
with the Eutem, and the church of San Vital: (dating from M7)
may be regarded IS a ting exemyie of a Byzantine structure.

The term'Bmmn' in often mienpplied. Every work of the
walled dark centuries of the middle ages, everything in etchi-
wcture that intervenes between the nncient and the Gothie, every-
thing in painting which repels by its unoouth, 1tl-proporttomsil
farm, is apt to be termed Byzantine; And it is commonly supposed
lint the practice of wrt in Itlly was entrusted exclusively to By-
unttne hands from the MI ot the Western Empire to an Bd-
unced period of the 13th century. This belief in the univerul

Idea that it is 1t1vsrisb1y of e clumsy and lifeless chenotar, is
entirely unfounded. The forms of Byzantine architecture are
"ieest strongly and clearly defined. While the beeilioa in e
