Lugano (932 ft.), the largest and busiest town in the Swiss
canton "2Seino, with 9400 inhah., ls charmingly situated on the
laka of the same name, and is u very pleasant place for a lengthened
stay, especially as a tramritioa-stsge on the way farther south.
The winter temperature is somewhat higher than that of Montreux
or Mann; the heat of summer is seldom excessive; while in spring
and autumn N. winds prevail, from which, however, Gastagnola
(p. It) is somewhat protected. The environs possess all the charms
of Italian moantsin-sonerr, numerous villages, churches, chapels,
Ind eountry-seMs are scattered along the banks of the lake, Ind
the lower hills Ire covered with vineyards and gardens, contrasting
beautifully with the datkfoliage of the chestnuts and walnuts in
the background. To the s., immediately above the town, rises the
Monte San 8alvatore (p. 11), wooded to its summit; to the 11.,
mass the lake, is the Monte di Caprino, to the right is the Monte
Gamma (pt 13), to the left are the Monte Br? (p. M) and the
beautiful Monte Bdgua (p. 12). On the N. opens the broad valley

double peak of Monte Carnoghé (p. 12) and the rugged Sam) Grande
(k880ft0, are conspicuous.
