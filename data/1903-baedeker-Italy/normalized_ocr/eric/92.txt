to Como.. LUGANO.' 3. Route. 11

extended from Gentilino to Montagnola and thence back via Sant'
Abbondio (1 hr.) .--- To the E., from the Piazza dell' Indipendenza
(Pl. D, 3), we may follow the Via Carlo Cattaneo, which crosses the
(1/4 M.) Caesar-ate, to (3/4 M.) Cassaratc (Pl. G, 3; electric car, p. 9),
and thence proceed by the sunny highroad skirting the foot of the
lite. Bre to 1 M.) Castagnola (1080 ft.; good restaurant in the Villa
Moritz, p.). At No. 78 in the Piazza dell' Indipendenza is the
entrance to the shady grounds of the Villa Gabrini (P1. D, 19,3),
with a beautiful figure of a mourning woman ('La Desolazione'), by
Vine. Vela (gardener 1/2-1 fr.) .--From Castagnola a hilly foot-
path leads to (3 M.) Gandria (p. 164), where some of the steam-
ers touch.

The most interesting excursion is the'Asoinr or me Home San SAL-
varona, by cable-railway (1800 yds. long), from Paradiso in 1/: hr. (fare
3, down 2, return-ticket 4 fr., incl. R... 8., a B. 10 fr.). The lower station
(Pl. A, 6-, 1245 IL; Restaurant, déj. 3, D. 4 fr.) lies at the terminus of the
electric tramway (p. 9), 1/4 H. from the steamboat-pier Lugaao-Paradt'so.
--The railway, w h an initial gradient of 17: 100, crosses the St. Gott-
hard Railway, traverses a viaduct (110 yds. long; gradient 38:100) and
reaches the halfway station of Panallo (1600 it.) where carriages are
changed. Here is the machine-house for the electric motor. The line
now ascends over dolomite rock, at an increasing gradient (finally 60: 100),
to the terminus (2900 ft.; Hfiiel Kulm, R. 21/2-4, B. 1%. déj. 3, D. 4, pens.
8fr.). Thence we ascend on foot to the (7 min.) summit (Yetta) of the
lonte Ban Salvatore (2980 ft.), on which there is a pilgrimage-chapel.
The *Vrnw embraces all the arms of the Lake of Lugano, the mountains
and their wooded slopes, gpecially those above Lugano, sprinkled with
numerous villas. To the. above Porlezza is Monte Le one (p. 150);
N. above Lugano the double peak of Monte Camoghe (p. 2), to the left
of this the distant Rheinwald mountains; W. the chain of Monte Rosa,
with the Matterhorn and other Alps of the Valais. This view is seen to
best advantage in the morning (panorama by Imfeld) .--Walkers (from
Lugano to the top 2 hrs.) pass under the Gotthard line and the [ cable-
railway and follow the road from Paradise (comp. Pl. A, 6) to (11/2 M.)
Pazzallo; here they turn to the E., following the narrowstreet named
'Al lionte', and farther on cross (12 min.) the funicular railway.

The ascent of "lento Bra (3050 ft.) to the E. of Lugano, is another easy
excursion (up 21/2-3 hrs., down 13/4 hr., guide needless; mule 10 in).
We take the electric tramway to Generate (see above), whence a road
leads to the N. to P ]. M.) Viganeflo (1 (1)? ft.). Below the hill crowned by
the church of Pazzalino a bridle-path ascends to the right partly between
Walls, and among chestnuts figs, and vines, via (11/: M.) Albanago (1525 ft.),
to (3/4 hr.) Aldesago (1950 it), the highest village on the W. mountain-
slope. Aldesago may also be reached in 8/4-1 hr. from Castagnola (see
above), via Rudgtiana. Above Aldesago the nth divides: both branches
lead round to the (1/9 ]; hr.) village of Bré (2 ft.; restaurant), at the back
of the hill. From the church of Br6 we ascend by a narrow path to the
summit of the mountain in 1/; hr., either traversing the highest crest of
the hill to the right, or crossing the spur to the left, in the direction of
Pagano. The view of the several arms of the Lake of Lugano, especially
in the direction of Porlezza, and the surrounding mountains, is very fine.
Lngano itself is not visible from the summit, but from the above-mentioned
'Pnr a good view of it may be obtained.

A pleasant walk may be taken on the highroad from Campione
(Steamboat-station), past the Madonna dew Annuaziata, with 16th cent.

coes, to (1/4 hr.) Bissons (steamboat-station) and by the railway
embankment to (20 min.) Halide (steamboat and railway station; see
P. 13). Thence in 1/2 hr. to San Martino (p. 10).
