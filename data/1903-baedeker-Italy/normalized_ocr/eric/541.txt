the Madonna (formerly gilded) by Niccolo dell' Area (1478).

A wide staircase, ascribed to Bramnte, ascends from the KW. angle
of the anterior court to the first floor. The Hercules Room here contains

a sitting figure of Hercules (in plaster) by Alf. Lombardi and a faded fresco,
by Franc. Francta (1505), representing the Madonna del Terremoto (the.
Madonna in clouds above the city of Bologna) .--0n the second floor is'

the Sala Farnese, with frescoes by Carlo Otgnam'.

Opposite, on the E. side of the Piazza del Nettuno, is the Pal--i

use del Podesta (P1. 29; E, 4), now the town hall, of 1201, but
practically rebuilt in the early-Renaissance style in 1492-94. The
great hall, in which the conclave for the election of Pope John XXIII.
was held in 1410, is called Sala del Re Ensio, after the young and
poetically-gifted King Enzio, who was kept a prisoner by the Bolog-
nese from 1249 to 1272 in one of the neighbouring houses. Enxio
was solaced by his attachment to the beautiful Lucia Viadagols,
from whom the Bentivoglio family is descended .--The adjoining
Portico de' Banchi, erected in 1400, rebuilt by Vignola in 1562,
and restored in 1888, is used for shops.

In the 8.13. angle of the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele we observe
the unfinished facade of -

I" Ban Petronio (Pl. E, 5), the largest church in the town and de-
dicated to its patron-saint, begun in emulation of the'cathedral of
Florence in the Gothic style in 1390 from a design by Antonio Via-
censi, but never completed (comp. pp. 364, 452). The building was
planned as a cruciform basilica, with d0uble aisles to both nave
and choir, and an octagonal dome rising above the centre between
four towers was to be erected. The projected length was upwards
of 700 ft., that of the transept 460 ft., while the dome was to be
500 ft. high. Only the nave and aisles as far as the transept were
completed, and they are now terminated by a wall and an apse of
the breadth of the nave. Length 384 ft., breadth 157 ft. The nave
is 132 ft. high and 47 ft. broad; its pointed vaulting, made quadri-
partite by Girol. Rinaldi in 1626--54 (?), is borne by twelve pillars.
The aisles, lower and about half as broad, are flanked with still lower
chapels. Below the vaulting of the nave are small round windows.
