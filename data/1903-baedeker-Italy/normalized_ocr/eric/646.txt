Opposite the choir of the cathedral is situated the Opera del
Duomo (Pl. F, 4; No. 24, entrance to the left in the court). Here
was opened in 1891 the IIICathedral Huseum, or Muaeo di Santa
Maria del Fiore, containing chiefly works of art from the cathedral
and the baptistery (adm., see p. 437). Lists of the works of art are
supplied for the use of visitors. Catalogue (1891) 1/2 fr.

GROUND FLOOR. In the vestibule, a bust of Brunelleschi, after
his death-mask, by his pupil Buggiano. Above the door (left), St. Ze-
nobius between two angels, a fine coloured relief from the studio
of Luca delta Robbia (ca. 1450) .--The hall contains numerous
architectural fragments: also 40. Figure of the Madonna, by a

Robbia (1431-38) and Donatello (1433-38), taken down in 1688 and
put together again, with additions, in 1890 by Luigi del More. The
na'ive charm of childhood has probably never been better expressed
than in the ten clearly and beautifully arranged I"" Grronps of singing
ind dancing boys and girls by Luca della Robbia, which are equally
Lttractive for their truth and naturalness and for their grace of
novement and form. The four *Reliefs of dancing Genii by Dona-
ello are full of vigour and expression, but meant to be seen from
r distance. In their exuberant vigour, they present a very signi-
lcant specimen of the master's work .--Also on the right end-
