the modern Italian language. In 1302 he was banished with his party,
and in 1321 died at Raveuna. Giovanni Boccacct'o, the first expounder of
the illustrious Dante and celebrated for his'Decamerone', which served
as a model for the'danterbury Tales' of Chaucer, also lived at Florence.
Florence, too, was the chief cradle of the school of the Humanists (15th
cent), who aimed at a universal and harmonious development of the per-
sonal character and whose contemplative life was far exalted above
every-day realities. This was the home of Salutato, Ltonardo Brunt, and
Harsuppt'nt, the'Pagan', whose firmly moulded characters recall the per-
sonages of antiquity; it was here that the sources of classic literature were
re-discovered by Niccolo de' Niccolt', Traversan', and other enthusiastic col-
lectors of books; it was here that the Platonic Academy developed the
study of the antique into a species of religious worship, and most of the
humanists, including Ficino, Poggto, Landint, Pica delta Mtrandola, and
Petition, who resided here for longer or shorter periods, received encourage-
ment and distinction at Florence. Even after the decline of'humanism'
Florence continued to surpass the rest of ltaly in intellectual culture, as
the names of Machiavelli, Vat-chi, Guiectardtni and Galileo testify.

In the development of the Fun: Aura Florence has played so im-
portant a part, that her art-history is in man respects nearly coincident
with that of the whole of Italy. We there ore refer the reader to our
prefatory article on the subject, and shall now merely direct his atten-
tion to those points which more specially concern Florence. In the 13th
cent. when frequent changes of the constitution and constantly recur-
ring dissensions of factions began to take place, and when private citi-
zens for the first time manifested an interest in public life, a general
taste for art gradually sprang up at Florence. With characteristic pride
the Florentines proceeded to erect their cathedral, which was begun by
Arnolfo dt Gambia (1232-1301), and in the form of their Palazzo Vecchio,
the restless aspect of their political life is distinctly reflected. The la-
hours of Giotto (1278-1837) entitled Florence to be regarded as the head-
quarters of the Italian aintin of the 14th cent., while the journeys under-
taken by him from Pa ua to aples were the means of rendering his style
predominant throughout the peninsula. Among Giotto's most distin-
guished pupils we may mention Taddeo.and Agaolo Gaddi, Oreagaa, who
was also noted as an architect and sculptor, Spinello Aretino, and Gtotttno.
This school flourished for nearly a century. The year 1402 may be accepted
as the dawn of the Rnnsrssxnea in Florence, for from that year dates the
Abraham's Sacrifice and the com elition for the doors or the Baptistery
(p. 460). In architecture, however, t e new spirit did not find expression until
two decades later (comp. pp. 482. 498). While Brunettescht' (1379-1446) had
adhered to the national traditions in his palatial architecture (Palazzo Pitti),
he derived numerous suggestions for his churches from a study of the
antique, particularly in the execution of details. His successors were
Leon Battieta Albertt (1404-72), Htchelouo (1391-1472), Benedetto da Hajano,
and Cronaca. Stimulated by the example of the humanists, the artists of
this period aimed at versatility, and were not content to confine their
labours to one sphere-of art; so that we frequently hear of architects who
were at the same time sculptors, and soul tors and goldsmiths who were
also painters. Among the most distinguis ed Florentine sculptors of the
Renaissance were Lorenzo Ghtbertt (1378-1455), Luca delta Robbie (1399-1482),
who has given his name to the glazed reliefs in terracotta, and above all
Donatello (1386-1466), the greatest master of the century, who exercised a
protound influence on the development of Italian sculpture, and is justly
regarded as the precursor of Michael Angelo. The energetic life and
strong individuality of his figures are such, that their deficiency in grace-
fulness is well-nigh forgotten. After Donatello's death, Andrea Verrocehto
11435-33), noted also as a painter (see p. 444), became the centre of a large
artistic circle. Beside these celebrated sculptors there were many of inferior
reputation, who were fully occupied both here and at Rome in the execution
of tombstones. _

The pioneers of painting in the Renaissance period were Hasacmo
(1401-28), Andreang Oastaaao (1390-1457), and Paolo Uccelto (1397-1475),
