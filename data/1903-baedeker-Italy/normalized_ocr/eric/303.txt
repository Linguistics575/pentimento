slepes, and Ghifi'a (small-boat station; *Hdtel Ghifl'a, pens. 6 ft.),
on the W. bank, and Porto .Valtravaglia (R.; Osteria Antica) on
the E. In a wooded bay beyond the last lies Calde, with the an-
cient tower of the Costello di Calde on an eminence. To the S.
appears the green Sasso di Ferro (see below), and to the W. the
Monte Rosa and Simplon groups. Then, to the E. ,---

Laveno (R.; Posta, at the E. and of the town, fair, 3.21/2, B. 11/4,
de'j. or D. 21/2-3 fr.; Moro, near the quay, R. 2 fr., Italian, un-
pretending), situated at the foot of the Sasso di Ferro, on a bay at
the mouth of the Boesio, formerly a fortified harbour for the Austrian
gun-boats. Laveno (20001nhab.) is adapted for a prolonged stay on
account of its beautiful situation and ample railway and steamer
facilities. The quay is close to the station of the Fee-route Nord,
while that of the Rete Mediterranea lies 1/2 M. farther on in the same
direction (omn.). A monument near the quay commemorates the
Garibaldians who fell in 1859. The site of Fort San Michele (to the
left as the steamer approaches) is now occupied by a pottery belong-
ing to the Societd Ceramica Italiana. Above it is the Villa Patti,
with a belvedere, which contains a few relics of 1869.

Behind Laveno rises the green Basso di Ferro (3485 ft.), the most
beautiful mountain on the lake, easily ascended in 21/2-8 hrs. (red way-
marks), and commanding a magnificent view of the lake, the plain as far
as Milan, and the Monte Rosa chain .--About 7 M. to the N.E. of Laveno,
behind the Sasso di Ferro, lies the hamlet of Vararo (2625 ft.), whence
we may ascend the *Monte Nudo (4052 ft.; 11/; hr.), perhaps the finest
view-point in the district, commanding an imposing survey of the Lago
Maggiore, the Lago di Lugano, the Lago di Varese, and the Valaisian Alps.
--Interesting excursion to the convent of Santa Catarina del Basso,
11/4 hr. from Laveno, high above the lake. We may go either by land
(carr. 6 fr.) via Cert-o, to which a road diverges to the right beyond the
bridge over the Boesio and a little short of the Mediterranean station (see
above), and thence by a picturesque footpath; or direct by boat (3 fr.)
from Laveno. Imbedded in the vaulted roof of the church is a rock,
which fell upon it in the 17th century. View of the Borromean Islands
and the snow mountains to the W.

soil, between the Torrente San Giovanni and the Ton-ante Sat
