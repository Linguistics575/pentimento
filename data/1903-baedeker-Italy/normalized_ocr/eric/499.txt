336 Route 45. PIACENZA. From Milan

The Via San Sisto, diverging on the right from the Via Borghetto,
the continuation of the Via Fol. Cavallotti, brings us to the rich
church of--

"SAN Srs'ro (Pl. 0, 1), an ancient edifice, rebuilt in 1499--1511
in the Renaissance style, with a fine Ionic atrium in front of the
baroque facade.

About 1515 Raphael painted for this, church the Sistine Mad onna (now at
Dresden), which was sold in 1753 to Augustus 111., King of Poland and ]
Elector of Saxony, for 20,000 dueats and replaced by a copy by Avanzini.
The choir contains pictures by Camille Procaccini, Palma Gtovane, etc., and
also several good intarsias by Bart. da Busseto. In the left transept is the un-
finished manument of Margaret of Austria (d. 1586), daughter of Charles V. and

-wife of Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma, the father of Alessandro Farnese. 1'

From the W. side of the Piazza de' Cavalli the Via Umberto
and the Via di Campagna lead past the church of Santa Sepotcro'
(Pl. B, 2), an early--Renaissance structure of 1488 (now an artillery
magazine), and the convent of the same name, built in 1503 inthe
style of Bramante by Aless. Tramelli, to the church of--

SANTA MARIA DI CAMPAGNA (Pl. A, 1, 2), an early-Renaissance
building of the 15th cent., disfigured by alterations. It contains
admirable frescoes by Pordcnone (1529-31; to the left of the entrance
St. Augustine, to the right, St. George, in the two chapels on the
left scenes from the life of the Virgin and of St. Catharine, and in
the large dome prophets and sibyls, etc.).

A STEAM TRAMWAY, starting near the railway-station and passing (10 ll.)
Graszano, connects Piacenza with Ponte dell' Olio (Albergo del Sole, poor),
a small manufacturing town, picturesquely situated at the mouth of the
Val ds' Nun, 15 M. to the 8. On market-days (Tuesdays) it presents a
very interesting picture of Italian peasant life. From Ponte dell' Olio the
tramway goes on to (22% M.) Bettola (Alb. dell' Agnello, rustic).

The remains of the ancient town of Velleia, which is believed to
have been buried by a landslip in the reign of the Emp. Probus (about
278 A.D.), lie 9 M. to the SE. of Ponte dell' Olio. Various antiquities exca-
vated here in 1760-76 are now in the museum at Parma (p. 343). An amphi-,
theatre, temple, forum, and some Ligurian tombs of the pro--Roman epoch
have also been discovered.

From Grazzano (see above) a narrow-gauge line runs to (5 M.) River-gate
(460 ft.), situated in the valley of the Trebbc'a, on the highroad from Piacenu
to (88 M.) Genoa. Beyond River are the road ascends the Trebbia to the
S.W., vifi. (171/21) Bobbie (915 ft.), once noted for its convent-library (for
the most part now in the Vatican), and (351/2 M) Ottone (1670 ft.), to (56 I.)
Ton- { gm (2505 ft.), and then descends, beyond the (61 1!.) Calls delta
Scofera (2225 ft), into the Bisagno valley passing Bargagls' (1345 ft.), Praia,
Doria (255 ft.), and Staglieno (p. 85) .--273 M. Genoa, see p. 66.





The RAILWAY rnon PIAon-NZA T0 BOLOGNA follows the direc-
tion of the Via Emilia (comp. p. 331), several traces of which still
exist. View of the Apennines on the right. To the left lies San
Lamar-o, an ecclesiastical seminary greatly enriched by Cardinal
Alberoni (d. 1752). The church contains his tomb, and pictures
by Procaccini, Zucchero, and other masters.
