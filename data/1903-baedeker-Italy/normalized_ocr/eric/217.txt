fapade and good sculptures. The church of the worn" DELL! Gaunt also
has sumptuous decorations in marble.'

The Iarhle Quarries (Cave) of Barrera enjoy a worldwide fame.
The deposits of marble occur throughout almost the whole of the Apnea
Alps (see below), from the little river Aulella on the N. to Pietrasanta
(p. 107) on the S. and Gastelnuovo di Garfagnana on the E. The quarries
in the valleys of Fantacrim, Colonnata, and Toraao (see below) were
worked by the Romans, but after the downfall of the West Roman Empire,
the'marmor Lunense' (so named from the seaport of Luna, p. 105) was
almost entirely forgotten. The building of the cathedral of Pisa and the
churches of Lucca, Pistoja, and other neighbouring towns a ain created
a demand for Carrara marble; and the artistic activity of the -16th cent.
gave a renewed impulse to its use. The industry now grows steadily; in
1899 about 180,") 0 tons were exported from Carrara alone. About 600
quarries in all are in operation; of these 346, with 44m workmen, are at
Carrara. DO (700 men) at Hana (see below), and the rest at Set-arena, Ma-
santa, Stazzema, and Anti. There are 109 marble-sawing works at Cat-rare,
employing about 000 men, and 28 at Massa, with about 170 men. The best
and largest blocks ield the name statuario .--The quarrymen, who
receive a wage of 1- fr. per day, quit work at 3 or 4 p.m.

A visit to the quarries (2-3 hrs.; guide, not indispensable, 2-3 fr.) is
best made early in the morning, when the weather is warm. From the
, above-mentioned Piazza dell' Accademia we follow the Via Santa Maria to
the end of the town and ascend the valley along the left bank of the
Carrione. At (1 ]. M.) a group of houses a path diverges to the right to
large quarries of inferior marble, but we continue to follow the road,
passing numerous marble cutting and polishing works. At the entrance
to the (1 M.) village of Tarano we turn to the right and climb the steep
lanes to the marble railway (see below), the metals of which we follow
in the narrow shadeless u land valley, passing numerous quarries, to (1 II.)
the station of Hastra. e may push on to the highest station (small re-
staurant), but the ascent is fatiguing, and should be attempted only when
time is abundant. A horn is blown as a signal when the rock is about
to be blasted. Theblocks of marble are carried away partly by means of
ox-waggons, partly by means of a railway (Ferrooia Harmffera), which
sends branches into several of the lateral valleys. Visitors are sometimes
allowed to ride in the trains; the tunnels are very cold.

761/2 M. [ use (195 ft.; Hotel Massa, with garden, Alb. Giappone,
both very fair; omn. from the station to the town and to Garrara),
formerly the capital of the Duchy of Massa--Carrara, with 10,000 in-
hab., is pleasantly situated amidst marble--yielding hills, and enjoys
a mild climate. The handsome Palasso Ducaie (1701; now the
prefecture), with its fine court, was a summer--residence of Napo-
leon's sister Elisa Baciocchi (p. 416). The loftily situated Casteuo,
now a prison, commands a splendid view (permesso at the prefecture).
---- Narrow-gauge railway to the Marina d'Avenza (p. 105).

Country fertile and well cultivated. The picturesque ruined
castle of Montignoso occupies an abrupt hill to the left .--801/2 M.
Seravezza, an agreeable summer-resort, with large marble-quarries,
lies 2 M. to the N.E. of the station.

Serravezza is the starting-point for the exploration of the 8. portion
of the Alpi Apuane, the S.W. chain of the Central Apennines, remarkable
for the bold shapes of its peaks. Near the centre of the mountains, above
the village of Stazzéma (Locanda del Procincto), noted for its marble-
quarries, lie the Albergo Alpine (2295 ft.), on the 8.W. s10pe of the Hon"
Panto (6100 ft.), the Alb. del Hatcmna, in Palagnana, and a dépendance of
the latter on the Pratt dt' Picm d'Orst'aa (3412 ft.), all three much frequented
