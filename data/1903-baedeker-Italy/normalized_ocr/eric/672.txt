'In the Madonna on the Steps the traces of his apprenticeship are still
very evident. The dignified figure of the Madonna, who is nursing the
Child, the flowing drapery, and the corporeal forms recall the powerful
women of Domenico G irlandajo; while the technical execution, with the
outlines fading into the background and the gentle raising of the inner
planes, suggests the influence of Donatello.'--- Springer.
