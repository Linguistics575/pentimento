San Petronio were executed by Jacopo delta Qaercia (1874-1438) of Siena,
one of the founders of Renaissance sculpture. A litle later the most pro-
minent sculptors were Southern Italians: Niccolo den" Area (6.. 1494), of Bari,
and Viacmo Onofri. Michael Angelo worked here more than once. In 1494,
when a fugitive from Florence shortly before the banishment of the Medici,
he found occupation in the church of S. Domenico; and in 15w-8 he
executed the bronze statue of Pope Julius II. for the facade of S. Petronio
(p. 369). Of the other Renaissance masters, who are well represented at
Bologna, Alfonso Lombardi, or properly Oittadeua of Lucca (1488-1537),
holds the highest rank; he was the son of a native of Lucca who emigrated
to Ferrara in 1496. Bologna was also the birthplace of Proper dc'Rosri
(1490-1630), one of the few women who have devoted themselves to sculpture.

In the province of Pumas we are struck by Relegna's close connec-
tion with the School of Ferrara, due robably to the dearth of impor-
tant native masters (comp. p. 356). The rat Bolognese master who attained
more than a local reputation was Francesco Francta (1450-1617), the gold-
smith, who owed much to Lorenzo Costa of Ferrara. In the devotion and.
gracefulness of his female figures he almost rivals Perugino, as well as in
his portraits. Francis, like Costa, must be judged by his easel-paintings
(in 9. Giacomo Maggiore, 8. Giovanni in Monte, Pinacoteca), not by his
frescoes, in which both are far inferior to their Florentine contemporaries.
Timotso Vitt', a upil of Francis, is mentioned at Urbino as Raphael's
first master. W th Francesco's sen Giacomo Francia, for a time influenced
by the Venetian school, begins a period of decline, which was not arrested
even by hael's influence, re resented in Bologna by Bartel. Ramenghi,
int-named agnacavallo (d. 1), and Innocence da Imdla (1494-1549).
Bologna attained its greatest importance at the close of the 18th century.
[ he mannerism into which Italian painting had gradually lapsed was
'esisted by the Eonae'rros, whose style was mainly introduced by Lo-
iom'co Gan-acct (1555-1919). In teaching at his academy he inculcated a
thorough mastery of the elements of art, a comprehensive education, and
l careful study of the great masters. The school was afterwards carried
in by his cousins Agostino (1658-1601) and Armibale Gan-acct (1560-1809),
me last of whom in particular possessed a refined sense of colour, devel-
) ped b the study of Correggio. To this school belonged also Guido Rem"
1574-1 2), Domenichs'no (Domenico Zamps'eri; 1581-1841), Alessandro Ttartnt
1577-1668), Guerdno (p. 954), and Franc. Album (1578-1660), who exercised a
{ feat influence on Italian art in the 17th cent., and effected a temporary revi-
ral of good taste. They afterwards came into collision with the naturalists,
: hieily at Rome and Naples, but at Bologna their sway was undisputed.

Emmanuel II., in bronze, by Monteverdc, erected in 1888. The king

d' the most efl'ective works of the late Renaissance, erected in
1564-68 from the design of Tomm. Laurati of Paloma, with a
