POST OFFICE. TELEGRAPH. xxv

evening--resort of the Italians, who seldom observe strict silence
during the performance of the orchestra. The intervals between the
acts are usually very long. Cloak-rooms are found only in, a few of
the best theatres. Gentlemen usually wear their hats until the
curtain rises.

Shops. Fixed prices have of late become much more general
in N. Italy, but a reduction may usually be obtained on purchases
of large amount. The traveller's demeanour should be polite but
decided. Purchases should never be made in presence of a valet-
tic-place or through the agency of a betel-employee. These indivi-
duals, by tacit agreement, receive a commission on the purchase-
money, which of course comes out of the purchaser's pocket. On the

other hand, the presence of an Italian friend is a distinct advantage.
An active trade is driven in spurious antiquities, especially in Venice
and Florence. Ancient works of art should never be purchased without
a written guarantee offitheir authenticity. The'lucky discoveries' offered
by the smaller dealers are usually nothing but traps for the unwary.
Some caution is necessary in buying articles to be sent home. The
full amount should never be paid until the package has arrived and its
contents have been examined. If the shopkeeper does not agree to a written
agreement as to the method of packing, the means of transport, and com-.
pensation for breakages, it is advisable to cut the transaction short. The
transmission of large objects should be entrusted to a goods-agent.

X11. Post Office. Telegrap.

In the larger towns the Post Office is open daily from 8 am. to
8 or 9.30 p.m. (also on Sundays and holidays); in smaller places
it is generally closed in the middle of the day for two or three hours.
Letters (whether'poste restante', Italian'ferma in posta', or to
the traveller's hotel) should be addressed very distinctly, and the
name of the place should be in Italian. The surname (cognomc, -
Ghristian name, name) should be underlined. When asking for let-
ters the traveller, should show his visiting-card instead of pronoun c-
ing his name. Postage-stamps (francobolli) are sold at the post-
offlces and tobacco-shops. The mail-boxes (ham or cassette) are lab-
elled'pcr lc lettere', for letters, and'per le stampe', for printed matter.

Inns, see p. xii. Sums not exceeding 25fr. may be sent within Italy
by the so-called cartoltna vagh'a (fee 10 e. for 1-5 fr. and 5 c. for each 5 fr.
more). Money may also be transmitted by telegraph. To secure registered
letters or the payment of money orders, the stranger must show his ass-
port or be identified by two witnesses known to the postal authorities.
It is therefore often convenient to arrange to have the money sent to
Ono's landlord.
