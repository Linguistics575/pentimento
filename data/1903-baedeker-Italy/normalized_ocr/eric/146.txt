prominent. A good bridle-path ascends from Courmayeur, by La Saxe
(p. 56) and Villair, to the (2 hrs.) Chalets da Pre (6480 ft.) and the (1 hr.)
summit. The descent may be made by the Chalet; du Leuchi (6295 ft.) into
the Val Ferret .--Excursions in the Mont Blanc chain, to Chamonix, etc.,

13. From Aosta to the Graian Alps.

The Gnaran ALrs, an extensive mountain-system culminating in the
Gran Paradiso (18,324 ft.) and the Grivola (13,022 ft.), lie between the
valleys of the Dora Battea and the Isere on the N.. and those of the
Dora Rtparia and the Are on the S. We here describe a few of the most
interesting routes through the E. part of this grand mountain-region,
in the form of a circular tour of four days from Aosta, taking in Gogne,
Valsaearanche, Rhe'mes Nata-Dame, Valgrtsanche, and Liverogne. Cogne is
the best centre for excursions.

The mountains of Cogne formed a favourite chases of King Humbert,
as they did of his father Victor Emmanuel (p. 53), and the mountain
goat ('Steinbock', Ital.'stambecco', Fr.'bouquetin'), elsewhere nearly
extinct, is still found here. Several excellent bridle-paths, leading to the
royal shooting-lodges, are a great assistance to the pedestrian.

ist Day .---- From Aos'ra T0 Coenn (61/2 hrs.). As far as (6 M.)
Aymavilte (2120 ft.) we may follow the highroad (p. 56), but it is
preferable to cross the Dora near Aosta, and to go by Gressan and Jo-
vengan, across meadows and fields. The bridle-path then ascends
rapidly past the church of St. Martin to Pain (2790 ft.), and enters
the monotonous, Val de Cogne at a great height above the ravine of
the brawling Grand' Eym'e. Far below we soon observe the houses
of Pont d'Ael (2865 ft.), with its admirably preserved *Roman
Bridge (formerly an aqueduct), 60 yds. long and 390 ft. above the
stream. It was erected in the reign of Augustus. The valley con-
tracts. Near the bridge by which we cross the stream we obtain a
View of "the Grivola for a short time. We next reach (11/2 hr.)
Viéyes (3714 ft.; cantine), at the mouth of the Combs de Nomenon
(pretty waterfall), with the Grivola and the Gran Nomenon
(11,440 ft.) in the background. Beyond (1 ], hr.) Sitesnoire (right)
and a deserted iron-foundry we again cross the brook by the Pont'
de Local (4480 ft.), where the mountains of Cogne are revealed,
to (11/3 hr.) hind (4760 ft.), Opposite the lofty Punta del Pousset
(see below) and the Trajo Glacier. At (1/2 hr.) Ore'taz the Val-
nontey descends from the S. to the Grand' Eyvie; (20 min.) Cogne.
Gogne (5033 ft »; *Couronne, R. 11/2-21/2, B. 11/2, déj. 21/2, D. 31/2,
pens. 61/2 fr.; Grivola, similar charges, clean), charmingly situated,
with a beautiful view of the Gran Paradise and the Tour du Grand
St. Pierre, with their glaciers (Glacier de la Tribulation, du Grand
Crou, du Money, etc.) to the S., and of the Mont Blanc to the N.W.,
is an excellent starting--point for excursions. Three valleys converge
here: the Valtone di Valnontey from the 8., the Vattone d'Urtier
from the S.E., and the Vallone di Grauson from the N.E.
Asonn-rs AND Passes (no authorized guides).'Punta del Pousset (9994 ft.;
