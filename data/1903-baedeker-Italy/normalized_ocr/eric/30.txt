person at the steamboat-agencies. Ladies should travel first-class, but
gentlemen of modest requirements will find the second cabin very fair.
The steward expects a gratuity of about 1 fr. per day, or more if the tray;
eller has given him extra trouble .--- The inadequate arrangements for
embarking and disembarking've great annoyance. The tariff is usually
1-11 ]: fr. for each person, including luggage; but the passengers are generally
left at the mercy of the boatmen, who often make extortionate demands.
The traveller should not enter the boat until a clear bargain has been
made for the transport of himself and his impediments, and should not
pay until everythin has been deposited on deck or on shore. Small articles
of luggage should e kept in one's own hands.

VIII. Cycling.

The environs of Milan, Turin, Verona, and Bologna, the neigh-
bourhood of .the Italian Lakes, and the Riviera all offer many attrac-
tions for the cyclist. The roads are good on the whole, though often
very dusty in summer (especially in the N. Italian plain) and
correspondingly muddy in wet weather .--English riders should
remember that the rule of the road in Italy is the reverse of that
in England: keep to the right on meeting, to the left in overtaking
another vehicle..'

The unattached cyclist on entering Italy with his wheel must
deposit 42 fr. 60 c. with the custom-house authorities, which sum
is returned to him (though sometimes not without difficulties), when
he quits the country. Members of well--known cyclist associations,
such as the Cyclists' Touring Club (London; 47 Victoria St.', S.W.)
or the Touring Club de France (Paris; 10 Place de la Bourse), are,
however, spared this formality, on conditions explained in the
handbooks of these clubs. A certificate of re-exportation (certificate
di scarico) should always be obtained, as otherwise the club of
which the cyclist is a member, may be called upon subsequently to
pay the duty as above.,

On the railways cycles are treated as ordinary passengers' lug-
gage (p. xviii). Valises should not be left strapped to cycles when

sent by rail, owing to the risk of theft (p. xviii).

Members of the Touring Club Italians (Milan, Via Giulini 2:, entrance
fee 2 fr. annual subscription 5 fr.) command advantageous terms at nu-
merous hotels, besides having access to the special information and maps
of tlie club. One of its best guides is L. V. Bertarelli's Guide Itinerario
delle Strade di grands Oomunicazione dell' Italia (3rd ed.; Milan, 19 (1) ),
with numerous maps and plans.

1X. Hotels.

Fms'r Gnass Ho'rBLs, comfortably fitted up, are to be found at
all the principal reserts. of travellers in Northern Italy, most of them
having fixed charges: room 3-10 fr. for each person, light 75 c. to

luncheon (colaziom, dc'jeuner) 3-4 fr., dinner (promo, diner) 4--6 fr.
The charge for dinnerdoes not include wine, which is usually dear and
often poor. For a prolonged stay an agreement may generally be made
