Aquileia (Aquila New, well spoken of; Fortuna; Caf√© Pasta),
a village of 2300 inhab., which lies 3 M. to the S. It is now 6 M.
from the see, but is connected with the lagoons by canals. In the
vicinity are many fever--breeding rice-fields (p. 64).

The town of Aquileia, founded by the Romans in B. C. 181 as a bul-
wark against the Celts and Istrians, was already a commercial and trad-
ing place of great importance in the reign of Augustus; its chief products
were amber and glass ware. As a naval station and strong frontier-fortress,
it soon became the chief point d'appui of the Romans in their campaigns
against Illyria and the lands of the Danube. In 238 A.D. the town was
besieged in vain by Em. Maximinus Thrax, and in 452 it was destroyed
by Attila, after an obstinate resistance. Though soon rebuilt, it never
thanks to the silting up of the lagoons and the rivalry of Grado, regained
its former rosperity.

Accor g to tradition, Aqulleia was converted to Christianity in the
first century of our era by St. Mark and St. Hermagoras, the tutelar and
first bishop of the town. It soon became a metropolis of the new faith,
and its bishOps assumed the atriarchal title in 557 (7). The archbishopric
was removed to Udine in 17 2.

Of the Roman Aquileia all that has been discovered is the re-
mains of one street and the N.W. angle of the town-walls. The
sculptures and small works of art found in the excavations are pre-
served in the Anonmomorosr. Museum, founded in 1882, which
is open daily, 9--12 and 2-4 (in summer, 3-6; adm. 40 h.; plan of
the city and excavations 1 K.). Director, Prof. H. Maionica.'

, The chief mediaeval monument is the *CaanDnAL, a flat-roofed
basilica with aisles and transept, erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031
on the site of an early-Christian church. Destroyed by an earth-
quake in 1348, it was rebuilt by Patriarch Marquard about 1379 in
the Gothic style. The Renaissance additions date from the Venetian
p eriod (ca. 1500).'

Irr'rnmon. In the left aisle is a small circular chapel, in marble (1031) .----
The c oir contains Renaissance stalls and an altar-piece by Pellcgrino do
San Daniele, in a fine old frame, with the tutelars of Rome (SS. Peter and
Paul) Aqufleia (SS. Hermagoras and Fortunatus), and Venice (83. Mark
and II'heodore). The frescoes in the apes, probably dating from the days
of Poppo and Marquard represent the Consecration of the church in the
presence of Emp. Conrad II. (above) and the Sull'erings of St. Hermagoras

Dhristian church, are painted with old frescoes of various dates. Behind

the choir-screena-tof the earlier building and a column with a capital in
the Ravenna style. Adjacent is the tomb of the patriarchs of the Milan
family of Della Torre (p. 111; 1273-1365).
