_ Como (705 ft.), a flourishing industrial town, the capital of a
province, and the see of a bishop, with 38,174 inhab. and large silk-
faetories and dye--works, lies at the S.W. end of the Lake of Como,
and is enclosed by an amphitheatre of mountains. The small stream
Costa enters the lake here. Como is the Roman Oomum, the birth-
place of the elder and younger Pliny. The electrician and philosopher
Volta (1745-1826; whose Statue by P. Marchesi is in the Piazza
Volta, to the S.W. of the quay), was born at Come in the house
marked'Gasa Volta' on the Plan.

The Piazza Caoour, a large square near the harbour, and the
new streets skirting the harbour to the E. and W. of it are the most
animated parts of the town. A short street leads to the S.E. from
the Piazza Cavour to the Piazza del Duomo. To the left of the
cathedral is the Broletto (now a public office), constructed of alter-
nate courses of black and white stone, and completed in 1215.

The *Ca'rnnnnan, built entirely of marble, is one of the best
in N. Italy. The nave was rebuilt in the Gothic style about 1396,
the facade in 1457-86 (by Duchino da Milano); and in 1487-1526
the transepts, choir, and exterior of the nave were altered in the
Renaissance style by Tommaso Rodari. The S. portal (1491) is
buflt in Bramante's style by an unknown architect; the modern
dome is by Fit. Juoara. The greater part of the sumptuous plastic
ornamentation is by Tomm. Rodari and his brother Jacopo. Over
the magnificent W. portal are reliefs (Adoration of the Magi) and
statuettes (Mary with Sant' Abbondio and San Protus etc.); at the
sides are statues of the two Plinys, erected in 149. The over-
decorated N. portal (Porta della Rana) dates from 1505-9.

Inmmon. The heavy and gaudy vaulting, restored in 1838, destroys
the efi'ect of the fine roportions, which resemble those of the Certosa
near Pavia (p. 144) .---- o the right of the entrance is the monument of
Cardinal Telemeo Gallic (1861). Farther on, to the right, second altar, with
handsome wood-carving, and scenes from the life of St. Abondius (1514);
adjoining (1.) the'Adoration of the Magi, by Bern. Mint, and (r.) the
Flight into Egypt, by Gaud. Ferrari. Over the third altar, a Madonna by
B. Luc'm' In the 011012, the Apostles, by Pmnpeo Mar-chest. The Saonrs'rr
contains pictures by Guido Bent, Paolo Veroaue (?), etc. Fine statue of
Bt. Sebastian (1481) in the N. TBANBBPT. In the LEI-r Arena: at the first
altar, Entombment by Tommaso Radar-1' (1498); at the second altar, l.
G. Ferrari, Nuptials of the Virgin, r. B. Lugni, Nativity; by the third altar, the
busts of Pope Innocent XI. (Odescalchi) and Carlo Rovelli, Bishop of Como.

In the Via Vittorio Emanuele, which runs S.W. from the oath-
edral, is the rear of the Romanesque church of San Fedele, with a
fine pentagonal apse. The chief facade of the church, in the Piazza
de Mercato, is as little worthy of attention as the completely mod-
ernized interior .---- The Palazzo Gtooio, on the left, at the end of
the street, contains the Museo Civico, opened in 1897 (adm. daily
except Tues., 10-4, 60 c., Frid. 1 fr.; catalogue 1 fr.).

(1807-96) the historian; viewsof Como, etc. -. On the first floor are pre-
