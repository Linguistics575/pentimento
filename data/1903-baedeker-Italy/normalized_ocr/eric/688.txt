' and Via Caoour. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 497

z-ohe Ohiostro dollo Boalso (Pl. G, 2), an elegant court of the earlyL"

t Renaissance, surrounded with colonnades and adorned with ad-
mirable'Frescoes in two shades of brown from the history of John -'
the Baptist, with allegorical figures and rich ornamentation, by
Andrea dcl Sarto and Franciabigio (ca. 1514-26). Adm., see p. 437.

On the right: 1. Allegsorical fi ure of Faith (ca. 1520); 2. The Angel
sf caring to Zacharias (15); 3. Via tation (1524); 4. Nativity of the Baptist
(5%; with the noble figure of Zacharias writing); 5. Departure of John
from his father's house, and 6. His meeting with Christ (these two by
Franctabtato, 1518-19) .--7. Baptism of Christ (the earliest and weakest

' of all, perhaps painted by the two artists in common, 1514?) 8. Allegorical
figure of Love (c. 1520); 9. Allegorical figure of Justice (1515); 10. John
preaching in the desert (1514?) - 11. John baptising (1517); 12. John made
prisoner (1517); 13. Dance of Galome (1522); 14. Death of John; 15. His
head branght in on a charger; 18. Allegorical figure of Hope (the last three
painted in 1523) .--- It is interesting to remark in several of these frescoes
the influence of Albert Driver. For example, in the Semen of John, the
Pharisee in the long robe and the woman with the child are borrowed
{ mm the engravings of the German master.

Proceeding farther to the N.E., we traverse the Via Salvestrina
to the left, and enter the Via San Gallo, No. 74 in which, a corner
house, is the *Palasso chint, formerly the Palazzo Pandolflni
(P1. G, H,'2), erected in 1516-20 by Giov. Franc. da Sangallo, from

.the designs of Raphael.

A little to the N.W. of the Piazza San Marco, at Via Ventisette
'Aprile A, is the little Conacolo di Bant' Apollonia (Pl. G, 3), the
refectory of a monastery of that name (founded in 1339), now used
as a military store. Since 1890 the Cenacolo has contained a small
picture-gallery (adm., see p. 437).

In the Aura-Boon are paintings of the 15th cent, chiefly from the studio
of Dom. Ghirlandqio .--The Mam Boon contains several works by Andrea
idel Castagno. On three of the walls are frescoes (about 1435?) transferred
to canvas and partly retouched (previously in the Villa Pandolflni at
Legnaja), of nine portrait-figures: Filippo Scolari, surnamed Pippo 8 arm,
Le.'Oberges an' or supreme count of Temesvar, the conqueror o the
Turks; *F nata degli Uberti, leader of the Ghibellines; Nic. Acciaduoli,
mentioned on p. 524; the Cumaean Sibyl; Tomyris; Dante; Petrarch;
and Boccaccio. On the wall to the right is an admirably preserved
*Freeco of the Last Supper, with figures charged with life (a late work
of the master; ca. 1450?): above, the Crucifixion, with the Entombment
on the right and the Resurrection (beardless Christ) on the left.

The Via Ventisette Aprils ends on the N. W. at the large Piazza
dell' Indipendenza (Pl. F, 2; omn., see p. 434), which is em-
bellished with bronze statues of the statesmen Bettina Ricasoti
(1809-80), by Augusto Rivalta, and Ubaldino Peruszi (1822-91;
Sindaco of Florence from 1864 to 1878), by R. Romanelli, both
erected in 1897.

The Via della Fortezza leads hence to the Vials Filippo Strozzi
(electric tramway No. 1, p. 434), and to the Fortesza San Giovanni
Battista, now the Fortcsza do Basso (Pl. E, F, 1), built by Duke
Alexander in 1534--35 to overawe the city .--- From the E. side of
the fort pleasant public gardens extend as far as the picturesque
Via Lama it Mugaonc (Pl. F, H, 1).
