In the Lungarno Mediceo (to the E. of the Ponte di Mezzo) is
the Palazzo Lanfranchi (now Tosoanelli), erroneously attributed
to Michael Angelo, and occupied by Lord Byron in 1822. Farther
on is the Piazza Mazzini (Pl. F, 4, 5), with a marble Statue of Maz-
sim' (1883), and at the end of the Lungarno is the Ports alle Piagge
(see below).

On the LEFT BANK or THE ARNO, near the Porta a Mare, at the
W. endof the town, is situated -

*Ban Paolo a Bipa d'Arno (Pl. B, 6), a basilica with nave
and aisles, probably dating in its present form from the 13th cent,
with a fine facade embellished with three rows of columns, the
finest at Pisa after that of the cathedral. The interior is adorned
with badly preserved frescoes of 1400.

Farther to the E., beyond the Ponte Solferino (p. 406), rises-

*Santa Maria della Spine (Pl. 0, 5), so called from a fragment
of the veritable'Crown of Thorns' once preserved here, an elegant
little church in the French Gothic style, erected in 1230 for sailors
about to go to sea. It was enlarged in 1323, and adorned with
sculptures by pupils of Giovanni Piscmo and by Nina, the son of
Andrea Pisano. The interior is plain (key kept at the opposite
house; fee 30 c.). The church was restored in 1872 and raised by 3 it.

Near the Ponte di Mezzo (see pp. 406, 413; P1. D, 4) are
situated the Loggia de' Banchi (Pl. 4; D, 5), erected in 1605 by Buon-
talenti, now the corn-exchange, and the handsome Palazzo dd
Oomune (Pl. 5, D 6; formerly Gambacorti). The latter contains the
Archioio di Stato, or the city-archives, which occupy ten rooms, and
comprise abo at 16,000 parchment charters (one granted by Frederick
Barbarossa in 1162, one by Richard Cmur--de-Lion in 1192, and
others of very early date; catalogue kept by the custodian).

The octagonal church of Santa Sepolcro (P1. E, 5), of the 12th
cent., is now largely restored .--At the end of the Lungarno Gali-
leo, farther up the river, opposite the Panic alla Fortczsa (Pl. F, 5),
is a passage leading to the house (Pl. F, 6) in which the astronomer
Galileo Gatilei (1564-1642) was born (tablet).

The church of San Domenico (Pl. D, 7), at the 8. end of the
Via Vitt. Emanuele, which leads from the Ponte di Mezzo to the
railway-station, contains an altar-piece (Crucifixion) by Benoszo
Gozzoli. The suppressed monastery adjoining has several frescoes
by the same master.
