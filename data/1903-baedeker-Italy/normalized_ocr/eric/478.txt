fishing-town with 8074 inhab., the excursionists are taken to see
the interesting Royal school of lace-making (p. 263), which em-

Torccllo, which now belongs to Burano and consists of a few
small houses and two well--preserved churches. The *OATHnDnsL
or SANTA MARIA, founded in the 7th cent. and rebuilt in 864 and
(partly) 1008, is a basilica in the early--Christian style, supported
by columns.

Isranron. On the W. wall of the interior are six rows of mosaics of
the 12th cent., representing the Sacrifice of Christ, the Resurrection, Last
Judgment, etc., recently restored. At the reading-desk and on the pulpit-
steps are ornaments and figures in low relief. The principal object of in-
terest is the ancient arrangement of the semicircular seats of the priests
on the tribuna (restored in 1890), rising in steps and commanded y the
lofty episc0pal throne in the centre. Above, a Madonna and the Apostles
in Byzantine mosaic. Similar mosaics of Christ and the Apostles, etc., in
the right apse. Below is an ancient Crypt with a font.

The ruins of an octagonal ersrnnr of 1008 adjoin the cath-
edral .--- The tap of the CAMPANILE commands an admirable view of
the lagoons and the sea .--- SANTA Fosca, built on a Byzantine
model and dating in its present form from the 12th cent., is ex-
ternally octagonal (interior intended for a dome, but at present
covered with a flat roof) and is of interest for architects. On five
sides it is enclosed by an arcade supported by sixteen columns and
four corner - pillars .---- The antiquities discovered in Torcello have
been collected in two small Museums.'

island of the same name, 2 M. to the S. of Venice, contains a con-
siderable Oriental library, and a printing-office (shown by a monk;
fee to the door-keeper). Byron studied Armenian here in 1816. On
the way to S. Lazzaro we pass the island San Servolo, with the provin-
cial lunatic asylum (Manicomio). S. Lazzaro is more easily visited
from the Lido (gondola with one rower there and back 11/2 fr.,
bargaining necessary; advisable only when the tide is coming in).

The steamer passes the islands of S. Servolo and S. Lazzaro (see
above) and touches at (5 M.) Malamocco (p. 318). At (71/2 M.)
