his younger brother Philip; in 1807 it was annexed to France, and in 1816

awarded to Marie Louise, the wife of Napoleon I. In 1847, after her death,

it came into the possession of the Bourbons, who had hitherto been in-

demnified with Lucca. Charles I I. (d. 1883) was banished in 1848, Charles I I 1.

was assassinated in the open street in 1864, and in 1859 his widow with-

drew along with the Austrian garrison. The Duchy covered an area of
16 sq. 1L, and had a population of about half-a-million souls.

Parma owes its importance in the Hrsronr or AM to Antonio Allegri
of Corregoio (1494--1534; p. 839), who, after his early studies in Fer-rare,
lived here in a quiet and modest style, and died early. It was not till
alater period, when he was followed by the Carracci, that his merits were
duly appreciated (characteristics, see p. 11). The best-known of his pupils
is Francesco Hazzdla, surnamed Parmigtam'no (1603-40), an excellent portrait
painter, and a native of Fame.

The ancient Via Emilia (p. 331) intersects the town, from the
Barriera Vittorio Emanuele (Pl. G, 4) to the Barriera Massimo
d'Azeglio (Pl. A, 4), crossing the PIAZZA (human): (Pl. D, 4), in
which stand the Palazao del Governo and the Palazzo Municipale,
built after 1627 by Giov. Batt. Magnani. In front of the latter are
statues of Correggio, by Ferrarini (1870), and Garibaldi, by Galandra
[ 1893) .--A little to the N.E., in the Piazza del Duomo, rises the -

*Oathedral (ll Duomo; P1. E, 3), an admirable example of
the Lombard-Romanesque style, begun in 1058, but not completed
till the 13th century. It is a cruciform building covered with a
dome, with a somewhat raised choir above a crypt, and a broad facade
with a triple columnar gallery. The three portals are embellished
with two huge lions (executed in 1281 by Bone da Bisone) and four
of smaller size, all of red marble, and sculptures by Lucchino
Bianchini (1493).

The Inrnuron, consisting of nave and aisles, rests on fourteen piers
above which runs a fine triforium. The vaulting of the nave was painte
by Girolamo Marsala and by Lattaneio Gambara of Brescia (ca. 1570).

Antelami (1178); 4th chapel, frescoes of the 15th cent. 5 5th chapel, frescoes

is the Cappella del Gaussian, with an altar-piece (Crucifixion by Gatti, and
on the ri ht a bust of Petrarch, who was archdeacon of the cathedral, a
work of 713.'

The octagonal Dom: is adorned with an "Assumption by C'orreggio (1526-
30), unfortunately much injured by damp (best light about noon).'It
seems as if some mighty upward impulse had imgellcd the whole armies
of Christendom to soar away from earth in joyful liss. A striking feature
of the work is that the figures seem to cleave the vaulting and to be in
the act of forcing their way out of the church-walls into bright ether.
The masterly and almost playful manner in which the greatest difficulties
in the work have been overcome has ever been an object of the highest
admiration' .---'Oorreggio', by Dr. Julius Meyer. Visitors may ascend into
the dome to examine the painting more closely (1/24 fr.; fatiguing but
attractive); a fine view is commanded from the outside gallery (for persons
free from dizziness).
