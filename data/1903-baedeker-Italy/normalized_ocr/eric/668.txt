preserved grafflto decorations. No. 18 (left), the Palaazo Altovitt

In the Via Ghibellina (which leads from the Bargello), a little
to the S. of the Borgo degl Albizzi, is the building occupied by

Athens (p. 441) from Florence on the festival of St. Anne, 1343',
interesting also on account of the view it contains of the Palazzo
Vecchio (entrance by No. 83; the custodian shows the fresco).

the commercial family of that name (p. 441), whose influence cul-

curve of the Roman amphitheatre may still be traced in the position
of the buildings.

true were the popular favourites among the monkish bodies. It
was completed in 1442, with the exception of the unattractive
acade, which was executed in 1857-63 by Niccolo Matas, at the
