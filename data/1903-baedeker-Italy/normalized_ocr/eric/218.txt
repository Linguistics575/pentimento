Viarcggio (13 ft.), founded by Lucca in 1171, is a quiet country-
town (17,2401nhab.), with regular and monotonous streets, situated
in a spacious and somewhat marshy plain on the sea, about 3 M.
to the 8.111. of the Monti delta Versilia, spurs of the Alpi Apuane.
Its excellent sandy beach attracts numerous sea-bathers (especially
from Tuscany) in July and Aug., and in winter, in spite of its
want of protection against the wind, it is occasionally visited as a
winter--station.

From the railway-station a road leads to the W. direct to the
beach, crossing the Pants di Pisa, skirting the Fosso Burlamacca
