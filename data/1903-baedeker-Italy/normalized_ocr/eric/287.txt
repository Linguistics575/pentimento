164 Route 23. MORCOTE.

The steamer now steers obliquely .across the lake to Banis-
mette (Stella d'Italia; Pena. Amster), beautifully situated at the
mouth of the picturesque Val Sotda, with Caetello high above it
(p. 12). Beyond Oria, the station for Albogasio, begins the Swiss
part of the lake. The slopes of the Mte. di Caprino (p. 12), to the
S., are also in Switzerland. On the N. bank the steamer touches at
Gandria (walk to Lugano, see p. 11), with its arcades and its vine-
terraces, and then turns into the pretty bay of Lugano, leaving
Castagnola (p. 11), at the foot of Mte. Bre (p. 11), to the right. The
Mte. San Salvatore rises conspicuously on the B. side of the bay.

Lugano (three piers), see p. 7. The station of the St. Gott-
hard Railway lies high above the town, 1 M. from the lake (cable
railway 1/4 M. from the Lugano-Citta pier).

As we leave Lugano, we enjoy a fine retrospect of the town and
Mte. Bria. The steamer rounds the promontory of San Martino, the
E. spur of Monte San Salvatore, on the right. On some trips the
steamer calls at Campione, an Italian enclave in Swiss territory.-
This village was the home of the Lombard sculptors of the 13-
14th cent. known as the'Campionesi'. The church of the Madonna
dell' Annunziata contains some old frescoes. To the left rise the
steep flanks of Mte. Generoso (p. 13). The boat now passes, with
lowered tunnel, through an arch of the viaduct mentioned at p.13,
and touches at Melide (p. 13) on the W. and sometimes at Dissent
on the E. bank.

At this point a fine view is obtained to the left of the SE.
arm of the lake (Lake of Capolago, see p. 13), which the Mte. San
Giorgio (3590 ft.) separates from the S.W. arm. The steamer enters
the latter (to the left, Brusin Arsizio) and steps at Moreote (Hotel-
Reatam-ant Moreote, on the lake,'R. from 1, pens. from 41/2 fr.), a
small town with arcaded houses, picturesquely situated on the
vine-clad Monte Arboatora (2710 ft.) and commanded by a church
and a ruined castle.

The steamer now plies obliquely across the lake to the small bay
of Porto Ceresio, situated on Italian soil (railway to Varese and
Milan, see p. 167). To the S. opens the Val Brivio, with Mte. Userid
(p. 167). The steamer turns to the N. and reaches the W. part Of
the lake. To the left, in Italy, lies Brusimpiano (not always touched
at), where Mte. San Salvatore again comes into sight to the NE
The boat passes to the left of the Lake of Agno (p. 165), the back:

other summits, and steers through the Stretto di Lavena, a narrowi
channel leading into the westernmost bay of the lake, which i1
almost completely enclosed by mountains. To the left, is fill
village of Lavena; to the right, the sheer Monte Castano (1740 ft.)
At the W. end of the bay is----.
