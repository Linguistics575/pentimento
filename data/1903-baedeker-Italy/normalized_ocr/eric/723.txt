(i.) VALLOMBBOSA. A visit to this celebrated monastery is
easily accomplished in one day with the aid of the cable-rail _
. from Sant' Ellero to Saltino; but in summer several days maybe
pleasantly spent at Vallombrosa (rooms should be ordered in advance
in July and August). The drive from Florence or Pontassieve (see

Pontassieve (320 ft.), a small villageat the confluence of the Sim
and the Arno, formerly derived some importance from its situation
on the highroad over the Apennines to Forli.

The road from Pontassieve to (5 hrs.) Vallombrosa crosses the Sieve
beyond the village and ascends the valley of the Arno. About 1 I. iron
Pontassieve, where the road forks, we keep to the left. From the soon-l
fork (11/; M. farther) the left branch leads to the Consume Pass and the
Casentino (p. 532), the right follows the ridge to (3 M.) the village of Paton
(Locanda della Pace), the birthplace of Lor. Ghiberti, and (21/4 M.) Pm
formerly a monastery-farm, and thence ascends a picturesque gorge (steep
towards the end) to the village of Tori, 21/: M. farther on. The road
steadily ascends, usually through woods, to (ii/r hr.) 17an (p. 31).

16 M. Bant' Ellero (365 ft.; no inn) is an insignificant village 1

with an old castle .--From S. Ellero to Arezzo (p. 634; 38 M., is
21/2 hrs.), see Bacdcker's Central Italy.

with a maximum gradient of 22: 100. The ascent takes about 1 he; {

fare 4, return-ticket 6 fr. The time--table changes so frequently,
that previous enquiry is necessary .--The train starts from the
railway-station at S. Ellero and ascends through a grove of oaks.
on the bank of the torrent Vicano, to the crest of one of the nu-
merous spurs which the Pratomagno range throws out into the valley

of the Arno. A striking view is disclosed; straight on, Salflno.

appears, above a steep slope .--1 M. Donnini. We now traverse
a well--cultivated district high above the Vicano, and then ascend
gently on the right bank of the Ciliana to (23/4 M.) Filiberti, beauti-
fully situated at the foot of the Pratomagno chain. The railway shit"
the sloPe in windings (fine views) .---- 5 M. Saltino (3140 ft), M
