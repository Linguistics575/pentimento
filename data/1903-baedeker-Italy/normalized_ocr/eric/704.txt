to Raphael (known as'La Donna Gravida'); 228. Titian, Haifa Â»
length of the Saviour, a youthful work .--l" 225. A. del Sarto,
. Assumption.

This picture shows with what versatility Del Sarto was gifted. It
is marked by quiet and orderly distribution, and something reminiscent Of
Fra Bartolommeo. The Virgin is raised 11 towards heaven most gracefully,
and there is an atmosphere almost like orregglo's in the glory (C. J: 0.).

'At Florence only can one trace and tell how great a painter and how
various Andrea was. There only, but surely there, can the spirit and pre-
sence of the things of time on his immortal spirit be understood' (Swinburne).

monk who has struck a chord, another monk with a lute, and a
youth in a hat and plume listening.

'In one of the simplest arrangements of half lengths which it is
gossible to conceive, movement, gesture, and ex ression tell an entire
Sale.... The subtlety with which the tones are roken is extreme, but
: he soberness of the general intonation is magical. Warm and spacious
ights, strong shadows, delicate reflections, gay varieties of tints, yield a
oer-fact harmony... How fresh and clean are the extremities, and with
what masterly ease they are done at the finish? What sleight of hand in the
'urs, what pearly delicacy in the lawn of the white sleeves?'--C. d: C.

"'17. Raphael, Madonna del Granduca, a work of the master's
F'lorentine period, formerly in the grand-ducal apartments.

'Painted in light colours and modelled with extraordinary delicacy,
he picture captivates us chiefly by the half-concealed beauty of the Ma-
.onna, who, scarcely daring to raise her eyes, rejoices over the Child
rith tender bashfulness. The Infant, held by the mother with both hands,
azes straight out of the picture and possesses all the charming grace
rhich characterises Raphael's later representations of children.'--Springer.
