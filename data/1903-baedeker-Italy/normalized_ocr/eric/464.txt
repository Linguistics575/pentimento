The adjacent church of SAN Grusnrrn DI CASTBLLO (P1. L, M, 6),
entered from the N. side of the Rio di S. Giuseppe, beyond the
bridge, contains ceiling-paintings with very effective perspective.
To the right are an altar-piece by Joe. Tintoretto, representing
Archangel Michael and Senator Michiel Buono, and the monument
of Dogs Marine Grimani and his wife, by Scamossi; behind the high-
altar, Adoration of the Shepherds, by Paolo Veroncse; adjacent,
to the left, bust of Girolamo Grimani by Al. Vittoria (1570).

San Pietro di Castello (P1. M, 5), a domed church on the island
of San Pietro, separated from the town by the broad Canal di S.
Pietro, an ancient foundation, was the cathedral of the Patriarch of
Venice from 1451 to 1807, when Napoleon transferred the Patriarch-
ate to St. Mark's (p. 272). The facade, erected by Franc. Smsraldi
in 1594-96, is said to reproduce a design of Palladio (1557); the
interior was restored in 1621. Handsome campanile of 1474 rebuilt
by Moro Coducci, and again in the 17th century.

The Inrnnron is of little interest. Above the side-entrance on the
left is a monument of the 14th century. Between the 2nd and 8rd altars
on the right is a marble throne from Antioch, with Saracenic ornament-
ation and verses from the Koran in Cuflc characters. By the third altar
is a late work of Marco Basal", representing St. Peter enthroned, with four
other saints. The high-altar, designed by Longhena, enshrines the bones
of San Lorenzo Giustiniani (d. 1455), first patriarch of Venice. A statue of
the saint (15th cent.) occupies a niche behind. In the left transept is the
baroque Cappella Vendrarnin, built by Longhena, with two altmreliefs in
marble, by Mick. Ongaro, 17th cent.: Consecration by Pope Paul V. of
the Patriarch Franc. Vendramin as cardinal, and an allegory of death.

This was the scene of the Rape of the Venetian Maidens by the
I'riestine pirates in 944, the story of which has been told by Rogers in
his'Brides of Venice'. The pirates were followed and vanquished, and
: he brides brought back in triumph.

f. Quarters to the West of the Canal Grands.

The Poms Rialto (Pl. G, 4; pp. 294 and 299) is a good starting-
mint for a visit to the quarters of the city lying W. of the Grand
lanal. Immediately beyond the bridge is (left) thexPal. de' Camer-
enghi (p. 295). Farther on (right) is San Giacomo di Rialto, the
ldest church in Venice, said to have been built about 520, now
estored, with interesting inscriptions on the gable .--- In the Vege-
able Market here (Erberia; Pl. G 4; p. 295) fruit is generally good
and cheap, especially in the morning. On the farther side of the
market is a short column of Egyptian granite, to which a flight
f steps ascends, borne by a kneeling. figure,'Il Gobbo di Riatto'
16th cent.). From this column were promulgated the laws of the
"Public .--- Beyond the Vegetable Market is the Poacher-Ea or Fish
Jafkfl (see p. 295)..
