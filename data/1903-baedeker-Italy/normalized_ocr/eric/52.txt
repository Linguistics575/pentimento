ITALIAN ART. _ xli

his artistic and novel conceptions. On these grounds there-
fore Giotto, so versatile and so active in the most extended spheres,
was accounted the purest type of his century, and succeeding
generations founded a regular school of art in his name. As
in the case of all the earlier Italian painters, so in that of Giotto
and his successors, an opinion of their true merits can be formed
from their mural paintings alone. The intimate connection of the
picture with the architecture, of which it constituted the living
ornament, compelled artists to study the rules of symmetry and
harmonious composition, developed their sense of style, and, as
extensive spaces were placed at their disposal, admitted of broad
and unshackled delineation. Almost every church in Florence
boasted of specimens of art in the style of Giotto, and almost ev-
ery town in Central Italy in the 14th century practised some
branch of art akin to Giotto's. The most valuable works of this style
are preserved in the churches of Santa Croce (especially the choir
chapels) and Santa Maria Novella at Florence. Beyond the precincts
of the Tuscan capital the finest works of Giotto are to be found at
Assisi and in the Madonna dell' Arena at Padua, where about 1306
he executed a representation of scenes from the lives of the Virgin
and the Saviour. The Campo Santa of Pisa (p. 408) affords specimens
of the handiwork of his pupils and contemporaries. In the works
on the walls of this unique national museum the spectator cannot
fail to be struck by their finely-conceived, poetical character (e. g.
the Triumph of Death), their sublimity (Last Judgment, Trials of
Job), or their richness in dramatic effect (History of St. Rainerus,
and of the Martyrs Ephesus and Potitus).

In the 15th century, as well as in the 14th, Florence continued
to take the lead amongst the capitals of Italy in matters of art.
Vasari attributes this. merit to its pure and delicious atmo- FLORENCE
sphere, which he regards as highly conducive to intelligence a Grants
and refinement. The fact, however, is, that Florence did not 01' ART-
itself produce a greater number of eminent artists than other places.
During a long period Siena successfully vied with her in artistic
fertility, and Upper Italy in the 14th century gave birth to the two
painters Jacoro n'Avanzo and ALrIcnrnnI (paintings in the Chapel
of San Giorgio in Padua, p. 252), who far surpass Giotto's ordinary
style. 011 the other hand, no Italian- city afi'orded in its political in-
stitutions and public life so many favourable stimulants to artistic
imagination, or promoted intellectual activity in so marked a degree,
or combined ease and dignity so harmoniously as Florence. What
therefore was but obscurely experienced in the rest of Italy, and
manifested at irregular intervals only, was generally first realised
here with tangible distinctness. Florence became the birthplace of
the revolution in art eiiected by Giotto, and Florence was the home
of the art of the Renaissance, which began to prevail soon after the
beginning of the 15th century and superseded the style of Giotto.
