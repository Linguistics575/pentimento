to Florence. PRATO. 57. Route. 429

Andrea delta Robbta, and a superb bronze screen bear testimony to the
: importance of Prato in the history of Renaissance sculpture. Among the
' painters of the place were Filippo and Filippino Lippi, Sandro Botticelli,
. and Fra Diamante. The church of the Hadonna detle Careeri at Prato also
' forms a very striking example of Renaissance architecture. This edifice
' (erected by Giuliano da Sangatlo) exhibits the transition from early to
high Renaissance, and shows how anxiously the architects of the day
directed their attention to the design of a Greek cross covered with a dome.

From the station we follow the Via Magnolfi, the first street to
the left, to the (4 min.) Piazza del Duomo, which is embellished
with a monument to the patriot Giuseppe Mazzoni (1897).'

The Duomo, begun in the 12th cent. in the Tuscan-Romanesque
style, was completed by Giovanni Pisano in 1317-20 in the Gothic
style. The campanile, in the Lombard style, is by Niccolo di Ceceo
(1340). On the facade, rebuilt after 1413 by Niccolo d'Arezxo, is a
pulpit, adorned by Donatello and Miehelozzo, in 1434-38, with I" Re-
liefs (dancing children) and a fine bronze capital. From the pulpit
the highly-revered Sacra Cintb'la, or'girdle of the Virgin', preserved
in the cathedral, is periodically exhibited to the people. Over the
principal entrance a I" Madonna with SS. Stephen and Lawrence in

terracotta, by Andrea delta Robbia (1489).
