0n the exit-wall, I" 626. Titian, Presentation in the Temple,
painted in 1638 for this room, then the Sale dell' Albergo of the
Brotherhood della Carita (damaged).

'It was in the nature of Titian to represent a subject like this as
a domestic pageant of his own time, and seen in this light it is ex-
ceedingly touching and surprisingly beautiful. Mary in a dress of celesti-
al blue ascends the steps of the temple in a halo of radiance. She pauses
on the first landing place, and gathers her skirts, to ascend to the sec-
ond.... Uniting the majestic lines of a composition perfect in the bal-
ance of its masses with an effect unsurpassed in its contrasts of light
and shade, the genius of the master has laid the scene in palatial archi-
tecture of grand simplicity.... The harmony of the colours is so true
and ringing, and the chords are so subtle, that the eye takes in the scene
as if it were one of natural richness, unconscious of the means by which
that richness is attained.... In this gorgeous yet masculine and robust

realism Titian shows his great originalityrand claims to be the noblest
representative of the Venetian school of cblour' .--C. J: C

in the Wilderness; I" 625. Ant. Viva-rini and Giov. Alcmanno, Ma-
donna enthroned, with angels and the four Fathers of the Church

0. Canal Grands.

The "Grand Canal, or Canalaazo, the main artery of the traffic
of Venice, fully 2 M. in length, with an average width of 75 yds.
and a depth of 16 ft., intersects the city from N.W. to S.E., and
resembles an inverted S in shape. It is crossed by three bridges,
the Pants di Ferro (Pl. E, 6), the Pants di Rialto (Pl. G, 4), and
the I'onte atla Staziom (Pl. D, 3), while small steamers and hun-
dreds of gondolas and other craft are seen gliding in every direction.
Handsome houses and magnificent palaces rise on the banks, for
this is the street of the Nobili, the ancient aristocracy of Venice.
A trip on the canal is extremely interesting; 3/4 hr. at least should
be devoted to it in order to obtain a glimpse of the principal palaces.
The gondolier points out the chief edifices; comp. also the Album
by Ongcmia (1 fr.; p. 263). The posts (pali) display the heraldit
colours of their owners. The following list begins at the Piazzetta.
