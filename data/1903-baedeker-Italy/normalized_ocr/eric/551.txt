University (Pl. G, 3, 4; comp. p. 364), established since 1803

anatomical collection and the collection of minerals. The Tower

The visitor imbued with the modern taste for the eriod of the Be-
naissance will find little attraction in the works of the nvnxrsnn-rn Cas-
rnnv, which form the chief boast of this gallery. Although it would be
unfair to depreciate the undoubted talent and skill of these late masters,
- their works are unsatisfacto owing to the absence of any definite aim or

indication of progress, and7rom the obvious pains which have been taken
to reproduce trite themes in an interesting manner. In the department
of fresco-painting the works of these Bolognese eclectics (see p. 865) are
most numerous at Rome but they are admirably represented here by a
series of oil-paintings. We may first mention several works by Guido
Rent, the most talented master of this school: No. 134, Hadenna della
Pieta remarkable for its masterly grouping, which again occurs in No. 138,
the Crucifixion, and places these two pictures on a level with the
finest werks of the 16th cent. in point of composition; No. 135, the
Massacre of the Innocents, exceptionally harmonious and digmfied 131
character; No. 139, Sant' Andrea Corsini, an excellent specimen of Guido s

owers as a colourist; No. 142 a masterly drawing in chalks for the Bees

omo which was so popular in the 17th century. The most interesting
work of Ludovico Carracei is probably No. L5, the Nativity of the Baptist.
Annibale Garracci's Madonna and saints (No. 36) has the merit of stately
architectural arrangement. The Communion of St. Jerome (NO- 34) 1'!
Avom'no Carracct' is very inferior to Domenichino's treatment of the same
subject in the Vatican. Domentcht'ao's scenes of martyrdom are far from
