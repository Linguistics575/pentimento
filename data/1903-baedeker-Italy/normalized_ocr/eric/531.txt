The University (Pl. D, E, 5, 6), with faculties of medicine,
mathematics, and jurisprudence, now attended by barely 100 stud-
ents, occupies a building erected by G. B. Alcotti in in 1587. In
the court are Latin inscriptions, Roman and early-Christian sarco-
phagi, and a few Romanesque sculptures.

The Umvnnsr'rr Lransnr possesses about 100,000 vols. and 2000 1188.
Among the latter are several cantos of the'Orlando Furioso' in Adam's
handwriting; a copy of Tauo's Gerusalemme Liberata', with numerous
corrections; letters and poems written by Tasso in prison; and Gum-ins":
MS. of the'Pastor Fido'. Among the printed books are fifty-two old edi-

San Francesco (Pl. E, 5), a brick church in the early--Renais-
sance style, erected in 1494-1630 by Biagio Rossetti, is entirely
covered with domes, and each aisle is flanked with chapels and
elaborately painted. The frieze of'putti' and foliage is by Gimp
lama do Oarpi (ca. 1560). In the 1st Chapel on the left are frescoes
by Garofalo, the Kiss of Judas, with the donors. A famous echo here
(under the second dome in the nave) answers sixteen times if
awakened with due energy .--A simple slab outside, to the right
of the entrance, commemorates Giambattista Pigna, the secretary
of Alphonso II. and alleged rival of Tasso.

The Case Romei (Pl. E, 5), Via Savonarola 18 his, decorated in
the interior with terracotta ornamentation and frescoes of the school
of Dosso Dossi, affords a good idea of an aristocratic residence of
the Renaissance period.

Borgia, Isabella d'Este (p. 236), Duke Hercules 11., and his daugh-

Ferrara, but altered in the early-Renaissance style after 1495 by
Biagio Rossetti and Bartolomeo Tristani according to plans by Er-

on ten columns, and surmounted by a dome. It contains fine fres-
coes by Carlo Bononi.

At No. 23, Strada della Scandiana, is the Palauo Bohifnnoja
(P1. F, 6), once a chateau of the Este family, and now the pro-
perty of the town. It was begun by Alberto d'Este in 1391, and
completed under Borso by Pietro Benvenuti in 1466--69. Over the
handsome portal is the unicorn from Borso's armorial bearings. In
1898 the palazzo was fitted up as the Musno Summon, for the
municipal collection of antiquities.
