ITALIAN ART.' liii

ANDREA MANTBGNA (1431-1506; at Padua and Mantua) derive
much interest from having exercised a marked influence on the
German masters Holbein and Diirer, and surpass all the other works
of his time in fidelity to nature and excellence of perspective
(p. 222) .--The earlier masters of the Venetian School (Vivanmr,
GarvBLLI) were to some extent adherents of the Paduan school, to
which Mantegna belonged, but the peculiar Venetian style, mainly
founded on local characteristics, and admirably successful in its rich
portraiture of noble and dignified personages, was soon afterwards
elaborated by GENTILB BBLLINI (1427-1507) and his brother Gro-
vam (1428-1516), sons of Giacomo .--The Umbrian School also,
which originated at Gubbio, and is admirably represented early in
the 15th century by OrravIANO NBLLI, blending with the Tuscan
school in GBZNTILB nA FAnnrANo (ca. 1370--1428) and culminating
in its last masters Pmrno VANUcoI, surnamed Pnnuemo (1446-
1524), and BERNAnDINo Bn'r'rr, surnamed PIN'rumocmo (1454-
1513), merits attention, not only because Raphael was one of its
adherents during his first period, but because it supplements the
broader Florentine style, and notwithstanding its peculiar and limit-
ed bias is impressive in its character of lyric sentiment and relig-
ious devotion (e. g. Madonnas).'

The fact that the various points of excellence were distributed
among different local schools showed the necessity of a loftier union.

shows that the climax of art was still unattained. The forms em-
ployed, graceful and pleasing though they be, are not yet lofty and
pure enough to be regarded as embodiments of the highest and
noblest conceptions. The figures still present a local colouring,
having been selected by the artists as physically attractive, rather
than as characteristic and expressive of their ideas. A portrait style
still predominates, the actual representation does not appear
always wisely balanced with the internal significance of the' event,
and the dramatic element is insufficiently emphasised. The most
abundant scope was therefore now afi'orded for the labours of the
great triumvirate, LEONAnno DA VINOI, MICHAEL ANGELO 13001113-
11011, and RAPHAEL SANTI, by whom an entirely new era was in-
augurated.

Leonardo's (1452-1519) remarkable character can only be thor-'

the goal of his aspirations; a division of labour, a partition
of individual tasks were principles unknown to him. He laid,
as it were, his entire personality into the scale in all that he
