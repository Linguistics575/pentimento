see p. 261). Behind are the Pal.
Labia and the Ghetto Vecchio
(see below).

Pal. Flangini (now Clary), late-
Renaissance (unfinished), per-
haps by Longhena ('2).

*Chiesa degli Scalai (Pl. D, 3:
steamboat-station, see p. 261),
the former church of the bare-
footed friars, begun in 1649 by
Longhena, with a fine facade
added by Gina. Sardi in 1683-89,
is perhaps the most imposing
specimen of the Venetian baroque
style. It was much damaged by
the bombardment 0131849, but was
restored in 1863-62.

The ceiling is decorated with a
large fresco by Tiepolo, representing
the miraculous removal of the house
of the Virgin to Loreto. The high-
altar, by Gina. Pozzo, with its eight
twisted columns, is a characteristic
example of the architectonic perver-
sities of the age of its construction.

Adjoining the Scalzi is the Ponte 811a Btazione (Pl. D, 3), or
station-bridge, completed in 1858.

San Simeonc Piccolo (Pl. D, 3, | Stazione delta Strada Ferrata
4), rebuilt in 1718-38 by Scal- (Rail. Station), see p. 258.
farotto, is an imitation of the Steamboat-station Santa Lucia
Pantheon at Rome. (Pl D, 4), see p. 262.

To the left, near the point where the Canal turns to the N.W.,
is the well--kept Giardino Papadopfili (Pl. C, D, 4; permesso at
the Pal. Papadopoli, p. 293). Farther on is the last steamboat
station, Santa Chiara (Pl. 0, 4; see p. 262).

In the CANNAREGIO, which diverges from the Canal Grande at
San Geremia, rises, on the left, the Pal. Labia (P1. D, E, 3;
adm. 1 fr.), a handsome but neglected edifice by Andr. Cominelli
(1720-50), with *Frescoes by Ticpolo in the principal hall on the
first floor (Antony and Cleopatra) .--Farther on, to the left, is the
Pal. Manfrin, formerly celebrated for its picture gallery.

Opposite, on the right side of the canal, is the Ghetto Vccchio
(P1. D, E, 2), with its high, many-storied houses, long the quarter
of the Jews, who were originally settled in the Giudecca. The
Tempio Israelitico Spagnuolo (Pl. E, 2), or synagogue of the Spanish
Jews (p. 266), was rebuilt by Longhena in 1655. Following the
Cannaregio farther, we reach -
