Leaving the Piazza del Dudmo (p. 460) by the VIA 133' Sun
(Pl. F, G, 4), we pass the Palazao Fiaschi (No. 10) on the right (fine
windows on the groundfloor) and the Palazzo Buturlin (Pl. G, 4;
formerly Pal. Niccolini) on the left (No. 16), with its handsome
court and modern painting. The former was erected by B. Ammanati,
the latter by Domenico, son of Baccio d'Agnolo. We then reach
the Piazza dell' Annunziata.

The large block of buildings in the adjacent Via de' Pucci is
the Palazzo Pucci (Pl. F, 4), dating from the 16th cent., but partly
rebuilt in the 16th and 17th by Bart. Ammanati and Falconleri'.

. In the Via degli Alfani, to the right, a little short of the piazn,
rises the former Camaldulensian convent of SANTA MARIA nnom
ANGIoLI (Pl. G, 4), founded in 1295, with an unfinished octagonal
Oratory with niches, by anellcschi .--- Opposite (No. 50) is the
Palazzo Giugni, built by Ammanati in 1560, with a fine court.

At the left corner of the PrAzzA DELL' ANNUNZIATA. (Pl. G, 3, 4)
is (No. 1) the Palazzo Riccardi-Mannclli, a brick edifice with orna-
mentation in stone of Fiesole, erected by Bern. Buontalenti in1565.
The piazza is embellished with two baroque fountains by Pietro
Tacca (1629), and the Equestrian Statue of the Grand-Dulce Fer-
dinand I., by Giovanni da Bologna (his last, but not his best work),
erected in 1608, and cast of metal captured from the Turks. The
pedestal was adorned in 1640, in the reign of Ferdinand II.

On the S.E. side of the piazza rises the *Spedale dogli Inno-
centi, or Foundling Hospital (Pl. G, 4), the initial work of Be-
naissance architecture, begun in 1419 by Brunelleschi, continued
by his pupil Francesco della Luna, and completed in 1451, at the
expense of the Guild of Silk Workers. The medallions with charm-

the Elder and Baccio d'Agnolo (1518).

The church of the *Santissima Annunziata (P1. G, H, 3), on
