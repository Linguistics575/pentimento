Bologna (165 ft.), with 147,898 inhab., one of the most ancient
and important towns in Italy, the capital of the Emilia, and a strong
fortress, is situated in a fertile plain at the base of the Apennines,
between the Reno (p. 340), the'Aposa, and the Savcna. It possesses
I venerable and celebrated university, whence the inscription on
old coins'Bononia docet', and is the seat of an archbishop and the
headquarters of the 6th army corps. The usually long and narrow
streets with arcades on both sides, the numerous old palaces, and
the venerable churches surmounted by quaint-looking towers, all
bear testimony to the peculiar character and at the same time to the
prosperity of Bologna. The mean annual temperature is 2° Fahr.
