'An attractive narrative composition, affording us a glimpse of the
private life of a Venetian aristocrat. In the splendour of the colouring,
the beauty of the forms, and the charm .of the landscape in the back-

ground, we may recOgnize the influence of Titian's masterpieces of ca.
1510-20' .--- Burckhardt.

Palma Vecchio, St. Peter enthroned, with six saints (retouched);

was engaged at the time of his death in his 99th year, completed
by Palma Giovanc in 1576, as the inscription records.

'It may be that looking closely at the'Pieta', our e es will lose
hemselves in a chaos of touches; but retiring to the focal istance, they
ecover themselves and distinguish all that Titian meant to convey. In
he group of the Virgin and Christ--- a group full of the deepest and

recent feeling - there lies a grandeur comparable in one sense with that
vhich strikes us in the'Pieta' of Michaelangelo.'--0. d: C.

it. Francis, St. Augustine, and three other figures.

'The composition unites all the peculiar qualities of the master, and
re can see that a supreme efi'ort has been made to produce a grand im-
ressron. The work, however, cannot be put on a level with the great
reations of Titian' .--- 0. J: C'.'
