146 Route 20. MONZA. From Milan

trees leads W. from the station to the SANTUABIO DELLA Beau

'ZVBRGINE, a celebrated pilgrimage-church, built at difi'erent times

between the end of the 15th and the end of the 17th cent., chiefly in

a pompous baroque style. It contains a series of admirable *Frescoes.

The paintings in the interior of the dome represent a concert of
angels, and are by Gaudenzio Ferrari. Round the drum are several wooden
statues by Andrea Farina. The frescoes immediately below the drum are
by Lam'm', those in the next section by Cesare del Hague and Bernardiao
Luim' (SS. Rochus and Sebastian). The remaining frescoes are all by
Luini, who, as the story goes, sought an asylum in the sanctuary of Ba-
ronno after killing a man in self-defence, and had to werk at the bidding

'of the monks. In the passage leading to the choir are depicted the Mar-

riage of the Virgin and Christ among the doctOrs; in the choir itself,
the'Adoration of the Magi and the Presentation in the Temple. Above,
in the panels and lunettes, are Siby ls, Evangelists, and Church Fathers.
A small apse built out f1 om the choir contains paintings of'St. Apollonia
to the right, and "St. Catharine to the left, each with an angel.'
