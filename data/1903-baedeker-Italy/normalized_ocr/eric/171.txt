On the left side, No. 4, is the'Palazzo Balbi-Senarega (Pl. D, 3),
begun early in the 17th cent. by Bart. Bianca, and enlarged in the
18th by Pier Ant. Corradi. It still belongs to the family who built
it, and after whom the street is named. The superb court, with its
Doric colonnades, afi'ords a glimpse of the orangery. The interesting
Picture Gallery on the second floor is shown on introduction only.

On the right side of the street, No. 5, is, the Palauo dell'
Universita (Pl. D, 3'), begun as a Jesuit college by Bart. Bianca in
1623, and created a university in 1812. The'Oourt and stair-
case are probably the finest at Genoa. The second floor contains a
library, a natural history museum, and an aula with six allegorical
bronze statues and reliefs by Giovanni da Bologna. A. staircase
leads hence to the high-lying Botanical Garden of the University
(ring at the iron gate). Adjoining the upper entrance. in the Oorso
Dogali (p. 85), is the Botanic Institute, founded in 1897.

On the right is San Carlo, with sculptures by Algardi (1650).

by the Lombard architects Franc. Cantanc and Gian. Ang. Falconci
for the Durazzo family, and extended in 1706 by Carlo Fantana
of Rome. It was purchased by the royal family in 1817, and restored
in 1842. The palace contains handsome staircases and balconies (finer
views), and is sumptuously furnished (adm., see p. 70). The pictures
and antiquities are of no great value.
