the two Piazzas rises the Palazzo della Ragione (P1. C, 4), briefly
called the Salons, a'Juris Basilica' as the inscription records,
erected in 1172-1219. The logge were added in 1306. The name
'Salone' it derives from its great Hall on the upper floor, formed
in 1420. Entrance, Via del Municipio (by the iron gate to the

The Great Hall, with vaulted wooden ceiling,'is 91 yds. in length,
30 yds. in breadth, and 95 ft. in height. By the entrance-wall are two
colossal Egyptian statues of Neith, and the'Petrone' or'Pietra dcl Vitupero'
(lape'e eituperii et cessionis bonorum), a kind of stone pillory on which de-
faulting debtors were exposed to the jeers of the populace in the market-
place. The hall also contains a wooden model of Donatello's horse in the
monument of Gattamelata (copied from the ancient horses of St. Mark's
at Venice, p. 272). Behind the horse is the tombstone of T. Livins Halys,
a freedman of the family of the histOrian Livy (p. 352). The walls are
adorned with 300 frescoes, painted after 1420 by Giov. Hiretto and others
(much retouched), representing the influence of the constellations and the
seasons on mankind .--The logge contain Roman inscriptions and other
antiquities.

Signori; Pl. 0, 4), rises the Loggia del Consiglio, a line early--Re-
naissance work of 1493, consisting of an open arcade above a broad
flight of steps, and containing a statue of Victor Emmanuel II. by
Tabacchi. The interior, by Biagio Rossetti, was not completed until
1523--26. In front stands an ancient Column with the Lion of St.
Mark (p. 221) .---- - At the end of the piazza is the Pal. del Capitanio,
with a clock-tower, once the seat of the Venetian governor, with
a portal by Falconetto (1532). Behind is the University Library
(P1. B, 4).

The Cathedral (Pl. B, 4), with an unfinished facade, was built
by Andr. della Valle and Ag. Righetto in 1551-77, in the late-Re-
naissance style. The Treasury (Tesoro) contains miniatures of the
12-15th centuries and handsome ecclesiastical vessels. Adjoining
the cathedral on the N. is the Baptistery, an elegant brick structure
of the 12th cent., adorned with frescoes of 1380, ascribed to Giusto
Padovano (opened by the sacristan) .--In the adjacent ErrscomL
PALACE is a hall with portraits of the bishOps, painted in fresco
by Montagnana, including a portrait of Petrarch. The vestibule
and the adjacent library of the Cathedral Chapter each contain an
interesting painting by Semitecolo of Venice (1367).
