era. In this material, decision and pregnancy of form are expressed
without restraint, and almost, as it were, spontaneously. Works i1
marble also occur, but these generally trench on the province 0
decoration, and seldom display the bold and unfettered aspiration
which are apparent in the works in bronze.

The churches have always afforded the most important field to:

the labours of the Italian sculptors, some of them, such as Sana
Croce at Florence, the Frari and Santi Giovanni e Paolo at Venice
and Sant' Antonio at Padua, forming very museums of Renaissanc
sculpture. At the same time many of the wealthier families (th.
'Medici and others) embellished their mansions with statuary, an:
the art Of the sculptor was frequently invoked with a view to erec
a fitting tribute to the memory of some public benefactor (such a
the equestrian statues at Venice and Padua).

At Florence, the cradle Of Renaissance sculpture, we becom

of life and character. The Judith Group in the Loggia de' Lanz
is an exaggerated and unpleasing example Of this style, the masts
having aimed at the utmost possible expressiveness, while the line
and contours are entirely destitute of ease. Among Donatello'
most successful works on the other hand are his statue of St. Georg
and his Victorious David in bronze in the Museo Nazionale (p. 4733

characterise the early Renaissance are admirably exemplified in th
works Of the comparatively unknown MATTBO CIvITALI Of Lucc
(p. 416). Important Florentine masters of the first half of th'

6th cent. were Glov. FnANc. Rus'rror (1474-1554), who was perhap
inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, and particularly ANDREA SANBOYIN
(1460-1529), the author Of the exquisite group of Christ and the Bap
tist in the Baptistery at Florence, of superb monuments at Rome (i
the choir of S. Maria del Popolo), and of part of the sculptures whic
adorn the Santa Gasa near Ancona. Northern Italy also contribute
largely to the development of the plastic art. The Gertosa at Pavit
for example, afforded occupation during several decades to numercu
artists, among whom the most eminent were GrovANNr ANTON ]
