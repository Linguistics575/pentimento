Pegli (20 ft.), with 9226 inhab., a much visited summer sea-
bathing place, is cooler and moister than the W. wintering-places
on the Riviera and is itself visited as a winter-station by nervous
sufferers. _

Numerous beautiful walks in the wooded valleys and on the
hill--slepes lend a peculiar charm to Pegli, as compared with places
on the Riviera, better protected by the mountains but more hemmed
in. The Passeggiata dei Villini, in the grounds of the former Villa
Elena, may be specially mentioned (fine views). Among the villas
are the Villa Boston, with grounds in the English style, the Villa
Pignone, and the Villa Doria (permesso in the Pal. Doria in Genoa).
The chief attraction is, however, the -

*Villa Pallavicini (open on week-days 10-3, on Sun. &: holidays
9-2; closed on Frid., Maundy Thursday, Easter, Whitsunday, All
Saints Day, and Christmas). The entrance is immediately to the

left of the exit from the station; permessi are obtained at the!

steward's office, where visitors write their names in a book and re-
ceive a guide (fee 1-2 fr.). The visit takes about 2 hrs.

The grounds extending along the slapes of the coast display a profusion
of luxuriant vegetation and afford delightful prospects of Genoa, the sea, the
coast, and the mountains. 0n the highest point (to which visitors should
insist upon proceeding) stands a castle in the medieval style with a tower
(*View). Around it are indications of a simulated siege. Farther on is
a stalactite grotto with a subterranean piece of water; under the bridge
a striking glimpse of the lighthouse of Genoa and the sea. There are
also summer-houses in the Pompeian, Turkish, and Chinese styles, an
obelisk, fountains, surprise water-works, etc. The gardens contain fine
examples of the vanilla, cinnamon, and camphor plants, sugar-canes,
palms, cedars, magnolias, and azaleas. A

71/2 M. Pra, a ship--building place; 81/2 M. Voltri (Gallo; Villa),
a town with 14,815 inhab., at the mouth of the Gemsa, near which
is the Villa Brignole-Salc (now Galliera) .---- Numerous tunnels
and bridges over small coast-streams.
