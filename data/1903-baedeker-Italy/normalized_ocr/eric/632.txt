among whom was the poet Dante Alighieri, were banished. The poorer
families of the nobility entered the greater guilds, and a new aristocracy
arose, rominent among whom were the Acciajoli, Alberti, Buonaccorsi,
Mancini, Peruzzi, Rucellai, Strozzi, and Ricci. The lower ranks of the
peeple - the po 010 minute--were still excluded from offl'ce. A large
portion of the city was burned down in 1304, during a contest between
the nobles and the people. In the meantime various attempts had been
made to secure peace and order by appointing a foreign prince as lord of
the city. Walter of Brianne, Duke of Athens, the last of these governors,
abolished the constitution by force in 1342, but in the following year he
was expelled. Power now fell into the bands of an oligarchy, mainly
consisting of recently enriched commercial families, who exercised an in-
fluence on every department of government through the'Capitani di Parte
Gaclfa', appointed to administer the estates of the Ghibelline citizens. The
position and the sentiments of the burghers had been much altered by
commercial crises, such as that of 1346, by famine, and by the plague
of 1348, of which Boccaccio has left a description. An insurrection of
the poorer classes--the'Tumulto dei Ciompi'--in 1378 was followed by
three years of anarchy and confusion, until the helm was once mere seized
by the aristocratic party, headed by the Albizzi. Haw Albizzi (d. 1417) was
succeeded by his son Rinaldo, with whom were associated Niccolo da throne
and Patio Strozzi. Under these rulers Florence enjoyed the greatest pro-
sperity; successful campaigns were waged against the Visconti of Milan
and Ladislaus of Naples; Pisa was captured in 1406, Cartoon in 1411, Leg-
horn in 1421. The opulence of the city increased, and the lower cla=ses,
encouraged by their rapid prosperity, now sought a share in the govern-
ment. Among the'POpulani' who were carried along on the crest of
the wave, now appear the Me ici, who had acquired immense wealth by.a
series of successful financial speculations (see the Genealogy on p. 442).
The founder of the Medici dynasty was Giovanni ds' Medici (d. 1429).
His son Cosmo was overthrown by the Albizzi in 1433, but returned after
an exile of one year, and resumed the reins of government with almost
princely magnificence, without, however, interfering with thesoutward
forms of the republican constitution. A war with Milan was terminated
my the victory of Anghiari in 1440. Pepe Eugenics IV., who lived in
Florence from 1434 till 1443, transferred hither in 1439 the Council of
ierrara (p. 359), by which the union of the Roman and Greek churches
was decreed. Cosimo employed his wealth liberally in the advancement
if art and science, he was the patron of Brunelleschi, Donatello, Miche-
ozzo, Masaccio and Lippi, and he founded the Platonic Academy (p. 443)
.nd the Medici Library. At the close of his life he was not undeservedly
urnamed pater patriae by the Florentines. He was succeeded by his
nfirm son Picro in 1464, and in 1469 by his grandson Lonnuzo, surnamed
'l Magnifico, who, as a statesman, poet, and patron of art and science
ttained a very high reputation. Florence now became the great centre of
he Renaissance, the object of which was to revive the poetry, the ele-
uence, and the art and science of antiquity. Contemporaneously with the
lost eminent artists the brilliant court of the Medici was graced by the
arlieet of modern philologists. The conspiracy of the Pazzi (1478), to which
.orenzo's brother Giuliano fell a victim, did not avail to undermine the
ower of this ruler, but brought the bloody revenge of the peeple on
is opponents. Lorenzo knew both how to defend himself against ex-
: rnal dangers by prudent alliances, and to secure his position at home

After the death of Lorenzo, the Florentine love of liberty, largely ex
'ted by the voice of the Dominican friar Girolamo Saconarola, rebelled
gainst the magnificent rule of the Medici. Piero, the feeble son of L0-
: nzo, resigned the frontier-fortresses into the hands of Charles VIII. of
rance, on his campaign against Naples, and, on the king's departure, he
as expelled, with his brothers Giovanni and Giuliano, and the government
ntrusted to a democratic Great Council (1494). Savonarola, having attacked
