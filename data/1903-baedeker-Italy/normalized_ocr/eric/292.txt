Arena (740 ft.), an ancient town with 4578 inhab., lies on the
W. bank of the Lago Maggiore, about 3 M. from its S. extremity.
In the principal church of Santa Maria the chapel of the Borromean
family, to the right of the high-altar, contains the *Holy Family
as an altar-piece, by Gaudemio Ferrari (1511); it is surrounded by
the smaller pictures, the upper representing God the Father, fat
the sides eight saints and the donatrix. The adjacent Gothic church
01" Santi Martin" contains a high-altar-piece by Ambr. Borgognone.

On a height overlooking the entire district, 1/2 hr. to the N. of
the station and pier, is a colossal Statue of San Carlo, 70 ft. in
height, resting on a pedestal 42 ft. high, erected in 1697 in honour
of the celebrated Count Carlo Borromeo, Cardinal-Archbishop of
Milan (born here in 1538, died 1584, canonised 1610). The head,
hands, and feet of the statue are of bronze, the robe of wrought
copper. The enterprising visitor may enter the interior (50 c.) and
Elimb to the head of the statue, but the ascent is far from pleasant.
The adjacent church contains a few relics of S. Carlo. The ex-
tensive building in the vicinity is an Ecclesiastical Seminary.
