by the aqueduct mentioned at p. 382.

The town was perhaps foundedfigg the'Ligurians and afterwards oc-
mied by the Umbrians (ca._800- B.C.?) and the Etruscans (ca. sm-
B.C.), who named it Felsz'na. It was afterwards conquered by the
Gallic Boii, and by them called Bononia. In the Panic War it espoused
the cause of Hannibal after which, 3.0. 189, it was converted into a
Roman colony, a little before Parma and Mutina (Modena), by the consul
C. Lselius, and as such was a place of very great importance. It after-
wards belonged to the Greek Exarchate, and then to the Lombards and
Franks. In 1112 Emp. Henry V. constituted Bologna a free town (whence
its motto'Lt'bertas'). The Unmnsrrr, said to have been originally
founded by Theodosius the Great (4.25), acquired a European reputation
as a School of Indra-grime under Imerius, who introduced the study of
Roman law about 1, and his successors, the'Glossatores'. Students
streamed to it not only from all parts of Italy but also from the countries
of the North. In the 12-13th cent. their number was generally 3-501)
and in 1262 it is said to have attained to nearly 10,00). The study of med-
icine and philos0phy was introduced at a later period, and a theologies ]
faculty was established by Pope Innocent VI. The anatomy of the human
frame was tlrst taught here in the 14th cent., and galvanism was disco-
vered here by Luigi Galeum' in 1789. It is a remarkable fact that the uni-
vereity of Bologna has numbered women among its professors. Thus, in
the 14th cent., Novella d'Andrea, a lady of great personal attractions, who
is said to have been concealed by a curtain during her lectures; at a subse-
vent eriod Laura Basst' (d. 1778; mathematics and physical science),

exercised little influence on the development of art.

Bologna acted a very prominent part in the contests of the Guelphs
and Ghibellines; as a member of the league of Lombard cities it espoused
the cause of the former in 1167, and allied itself with the Pope against
Emp. Frederick 11. In a sanguinary encounter at Fossalta, in May, 1249.
King Emio, son of the Emperor, was captured by the Bolognese, who
kept him in confinement for the rest of his life (22 years, p. 366). The
possession of Bologna was energetically disputed in the 14th cent. by the
Pepolt of BoIOgna, the Viscouti of Milan, and the popes; but in 1101 the
powerful family of the Beutt'voglt' succeeded in making themselves masters
of the city. Protracted feuds with the papal throne followed, until in
1506 Po Julius II. incorporated Bologna with the States of the Church.

Em. Charles V. Here, too, the Council of Trent held a meeting in 1547.
In 796 Bologna was annexed to the'Cisalpine Re ublic' by Na leon- in
1815 it again became subject to the States of the hutch; m1 1 and fess
revolutions broke out, and in 1860 the town finally united itself to the
kingdom of Italy.

In the History of Art Bologna did not attain to any distinction till
a comparatively late period. In the Gothic era it at length became an-
bitious of possessing within its walls the largest church in Italy. To
this ambition it was indebted for San.Petrom'o, which, had it been com-
pleted, would have surpassed in size all the other cathedrals in Italy.
Unfortunately, however, it remained a torso, and gave rise to innu-
merable disputes. The EARLY Rsxarsssnca style is abundantly represented
here. The Palatt'al Edifices, constructed of brick, with their ground
floors Opening in arcades towards the street, impart a peculiar charm to
the town. Baldassare Pet-uzzt' (1481-1596), the famous Sienese architect.
