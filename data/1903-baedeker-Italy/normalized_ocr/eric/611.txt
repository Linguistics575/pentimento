Pistoja ('210 ft.), a pleasant town with 65,412 inhab. (incl. the
suburbs), is situated in the vicinity of the Ombrone, a small tributary
of the Arno, at the junction of the Leghom-Florence and Bologna-
Florence (R. 52) railway-lines. It has broad, well-built streets, and
important manufactories of guns and iron-ware. Pistols are said to

have been invented at Pistoja,'and thence to derive their name.

Pistoja, the Roman Piston'a, near which Catiline was defeated and
slain, 13.0. 62, was in the middle ages the centre of the fiercest struggle:
between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. In the year 1300 the Camellia-i
and Panciatichi, or Black and White parties, mentioned by Dante (Inferno.
xxiv. 143), who afterwards extended their intrigues to Florence and in-
fluenced the fortunes of the oet himself, were formed here. Pistoja had
to surrender to Florence in 351. It was the birthplace of the celebrated
jurist and poet Gino Sinibalds' (1270--1336), a friend of Dante, and of the
satirist Niccolo Forteguerra (1674-1735), author of the Ricciardetto.

In the Hrsroar or Anr, Pistoja, which somewhat resembles Florence
in miniature, held an important rank in the early part of the middle
ages, and was foremost among the Tuscan republics in fostering artistic
progress. The older churches, such as the Cathedral and San! Andres.
exhibit a leaning to the Pisan style, which was extensively in vogue in

the 12th century. At Pistoja we also meet with many of the earliest at-'

tempts at sculpture in Tuscany, which are much ruder than contem-
poraneOus German and French works of the same kind, and with several
of the names of the oldest artists (Grumman: and Adeodatus). Afmr the
14th cent. Pisto'a became dependent on Florence both politically and in
the province 0 art. The town continued to be wealthy and ambitious
enough to patronise artists, but thenceforth those of Florence were always
employed. 0f the Goldsmith": Art we have an important specimen in the
silver altar in the Cathedral.
