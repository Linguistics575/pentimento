The S.E. side of the busy Piazza delle Erbe, close by, is occupied
by the Torre deu' Orologio and the old Gothic Palauo dclla Ragione
(Pl. 0, 3), originally of the 13th cent. but entirely altered since
then. 0n the N.E. facade of this palazzo, in the little Piazza
Broletto, is an ancient relief of Virgil (1220).

A little farther on is the PIAZZA SonnnLLo (Pl. 0, D, 2), in the
centre .of which rises a monument to the political martyrs of the

battlements, both long in the possession of the Bonacolsi (p; 236),
viz. the Palasso Cadcnaazi (12-13th cent.), with the Torre delta
Gabbia (180 ft.), named from the iron cage on the S.W. side, and

remodelled about 1545 by G. B. Bertani from designs by Giulio
Romano, has a fine fretted ceiling; the rows of chapels flanking
the outer aisles are domed. 0n the left of the entrance is an ancient

nata. and the Chapel of the Sacrament of 1652. In the sacristy is
