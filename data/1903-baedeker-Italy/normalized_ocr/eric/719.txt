Sesto is the best starting-point for an ascent of lento Horello (335 (L;
there and back 6--7 hrs.). We go viii. Doccia (p. 525) to (11/: hr.) Le
Molina, whence we proceed to the left, via Moreno, to (25 min.) Gualdo
where the easier of the two paths to the summit diverges beyond the church
Passing (10 min.) a cattle-shed (to the left), we reach the S.E. peak, La
Casaccia (3020 ft.), which is crowned with a ruined convent and commands
an extensive and splendid view. The highest peak, named RAM, is
reached in 1/. hr. more. In returning we may proceed to the N.E. vii

(9.) FIBSOLB, on the height about 3 M. to the N.E. of Florence,
may be reached by walkers in 11/2 hr. The most convenient of the
various routes is offered by the electric tramway (No. 4; p. 434;
best views on the right). The steep old road between San Domenico
and Fiesole should be traversed once at least on foot for the sake
of the beautiful views. (Visit to the Radio, see p. 524.) Those
who go by carriage (about 8 fr.; comp. p. 433) should stipulate for
the inclusion of the Badia; the return may be made from Fiesole

carr. about 10--12 fr.) .--The electric tramway leads from the Piazza
del Duomo through the Piazza dell' Annunziata (Pl. G, 3, 4; p. 482)
and the Piazza Savonarola (P1. 1, 2) to the Barriera delta Qua-cc,
where the precincts of the city are left. It then crosses the railway
0 Rome and ascends to San Gemasio, soon afiording a fine view
of the hills on the 8. bank of the Arno. Beyond Le Lune ('Hét-
Pens. Le Lune) the route winds up through a picturesque hilly
district to San Domenico (see below).

trium ha ] arch, erected in 1739, commemorates the entry of Grand--duke
Francis IL, to the Barriers delle Cure (comp. Pl. 1, 1; omn., see p. 4.3L)
and ascend the Via Boccaccio to the N.E., on the left bank of the Hay-
none, an insignificant stream. The Villa Palmicri, the roperty of the
Earl of Crawford, where Queen Victoria resided in 1, is passed on
the right. Boccaccio makes this the residence of the narrators in his
'Decamerone' during the lague in 1348. [ The Villa thrardo or Ross, on
the way to Settignano (p. 329), is supposed to have been the first meeting-
place of the story-tellers, whence they afterwards migrated by a path
'full west' to the Villa Palmieri. ] The road then ascends rapidly between
garden-walls to San Domenico .--Another route for walkers ascends from
the Barriera della Querce (see above) to the NE. by the Via delle Forbid.
