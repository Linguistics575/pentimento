The old Town Wall is intact except near the lake; on the S.E.

Torre, now known as the Porta Vittoria, being a massive five-storied
structure. Outside the gate, in the Piazza Vittoria, is a bronze Statue
of Garibaldi, by Vela (1889) .--- In the .Viale Varese, a promenade
shaded with plane-trees and skirting the S.W. town-wall, is the
church of Santtsstma Annumiata, of the 17th cent., also known
as the Chiesa dcl Croccfisso, from a miraculous image.

Farther on, on the slope of the mountain on the other side of the
Costa, is the fine old Basilica Sant' Abbondio, originally a Lombard
structure of the 8th cent., rebuilt in the 11th cent., and restored in
1863--88. Beneath it the remains of a church of the 5th cent. have
been found.
