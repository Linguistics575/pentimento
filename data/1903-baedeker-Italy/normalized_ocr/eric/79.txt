4 Route 2. SIMPLON.

Glacier descends. The part of the road between the Fifth Refuge
(6345 ft.) and the culminating point is protected from avalanches
by several galleries. From the Sixth Refuge (6540 ft.) a splendid
final view is enjoyed of the Bernese Alps. _

At the (5 min.) summit of the Bimplon Pass (6590 ft.) stands
the Hétel Bellevue (R. 21/2-6, B. 11/2, déj. 3, D. 4 fr.). About 1/2 M.
farther on (6 M. from Berisal) is the Hospice (6666 ft.; plain ac-
commodation), a spacious building at the foot of the Hz'lbschhom
(10,605 it.) We then descend gradually through a broad valley,
bounded by snow-capped heights.

20 M. Bimplon, Ital. Sempione (4855 ft'.; Paste, R. 21/2-3,
D. 3-31/2 fr.; Hotel Fletachhom), is a village situated on green mea-
dows, where the diligence halts for dinner. The road (to the left,.
short-cut for walkers) now describes a long curve and enters the
Laquin Valley. At (2 M.) Algaby we cross the Krummbach, now.
called the Diveria or Doveria.

Beyond the ('/4 M.) Algaby Gallery begins the wild and grand:
Ravine of Gondo. We cross the stream twice, and at the Ninth.
Refuge (3514 ft.) enter the Gondo Gallery. At the end of this'
tunnel the Fressinone (or Alpienbach) forms a fine waterfall, which;
is crossed by a slender bridge; on both sides the rocks tower to a.
height of over 2000 ft., presenting a most imposing picture .--;
33/4 M. Gondo (2816 ft.) is the last Swiss village (custom-house);
3/4 M. farther on is Paglino, the first Italian village. The valley now
assumes the name of Val di Vedro.

29 M. Iselle (2155 ft.; Pasta) is the seat of the Italian custom-
house. The valley, although now less wild, continues to be ex-
tremely picturesque. Beyond Oréoola (1100 ft.) it unites with the
broad and fertile valley of the Tom (or Toes), here called the Val
d'Oas'o'la. The scenery now assumes a distinctly Italian character.

40 M. Domodossola (920 ft.; _'H6tel de la Ville, R. 31/2, déj. 3,
'D. 41/2 fr.; *Términus et Espagne, R. 21/2-4, dej. 21/2, D. 4 fr.; Na-
tional; Albergo Martini, - Bufiet), the ancient Oscela, a small town with
3700 inhab., beautifully situated. The Palaszo Silva (16th cent.)
contains a small museum. The Calvary He'll, 20 min. to the 8.,
commands a superb view towards the N.

About 41/2 M. to the W. lies Bognanco (2083 ft.) the chief place of the
valley of that name, with mineral Springs and a hydrOpathic establishment.
