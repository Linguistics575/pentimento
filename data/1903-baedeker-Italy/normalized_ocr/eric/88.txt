Lugano (932 ft.), the largest and busiest town in the Swiss
canton of Ticino, with 9400 inhab., is charmingly situated on the
lake of the same name, and is a very pleasant place for a lengthened
stay, especially as a transition--stage on the way farther south.
The winter temperature is somewhat higher than that of Montreux
or Moran; the heat of summer is seldom excessive; while in spring
and autumn N. winds prevail, from which, however, Oastagnola
(p. 11) is somewhat protected. The environs possess all the charms
of Italian mountain-scenery; numerous villages, churches, chapels,
and country-seats are scattered along the banks of the lake, and
the lower hills are covered with vineyards and gardens, contrasting
beautifully with the darkfoliage of the chestnuts and walnuts in
the background. To the 8., immediately above the town, rises the
Monte San Salvatore (p. 11), wooded to its summit; to the E.,
across the lake, is the Monte dt Caprino, to the right is the Monte
Gmeroso (p. 13), to the left are the Monte Bré (p. 11) and the
beautiful Monte Bo'glia (p. 12). On the N. opens the broad valley
of the Cassarate, backed by a group of mountains among which the
double peak of Monte Camoghe (p. 12) and the rugged Basso Grande
(4880_ft.), are conspicuous.

To the E. of the steamboat-pier of Lugano-Citt'a lies the PIAZZA
Guanine (P1. 0, D, 3), an Open space beautifled by pleasure
grounds and a fountain. On its W. side rises the imposing Palasso
