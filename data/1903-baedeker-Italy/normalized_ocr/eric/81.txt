ascent) now carry us to the Upper Meienreuss Bridge, where we cross
the wild and deep ravine of the Meienreuss for the third time.
Passing through another tunnel and skirting the face of the moun-

just traversed. Opposite rises the Rienser Stock (9785 it.) We
next cross two fine bridges, penetrate the Naxberg Tunnel (1 M. long;
ascent of 118ft.), and, immediately beyond the village of Goeschenen,
cross the deep gorge of the Goeachenen-Reuaa (view of the Goe-
schenen- Thal to the right, with the beautiful Dammafirn).
