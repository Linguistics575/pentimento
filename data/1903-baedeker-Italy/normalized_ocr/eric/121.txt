The Via di Po (p. 37) ends at the large PIAZZA Vrr'romo Enu-
NUELB PBINO (Pl. F, 4), on the other side of which is the handsome
Ponte Vittorio Emanuele Prime (Pl. F, G, 4), crossing to the Gran
Madre di Dio (see below). From the S. side of the piazza the Corso
Cairoli (Pl. F, 4, 5), adorned with a Monument of Garibaldi by
Tabacchi (1887), leads up the river to the Ponte Umberto Primo
(Pl. F, 5), the new iron bridge at the E. end of the Curse Vitt.
Emanuele II. (p. 36), and to the Giardino Pubblico.

The Giardino Pubblieo or Parco del Valentino Pl. E, 5-7), an
attractive promenade (cafe-restaurant), was in 190 the site of the
International Exhibition of Industrial Art. It comprises also the
Botanical Garden and the *Castello del Valentino, a building in the
French style with four towers, begun in 1650 for the Madame Beale
Christine, wife of Vittorio Amedeo I., by a pupil of Sal. Debrosse,
but left unfinished. The chateau is now occupied by the Polytechnic
School (Reale Swola d'Applicazione per gli Ingegneri). In the court
is a bronze statue of Quintino Sella, the scholar and statesman, by
Ces. Reduzzi (1894). On the S. side of the garden is the Costello
Medioevale (adm., see p. 27), a reproduction of a castle of the
15th cent, erected for the exhibition of 1884 (restaurant).

0n the Right Bank of the river, at the E. end of the Curse Vittorio
Emanuele Secondo (p. 36), stands the large Crimean Monument
(P1. 25; F, 5), by Luigi Belli, erected in 1892 to commemorate the
war of 1855-56.

The Via Moncalieri leads from the bridge to the left, along the
bank of the river, to (5 min.) the Monte dei Cappuccini (Pl. F, G, 5;
955 ft. above the sea), a wooded hill rising 164 ft. above the Po
and ascended by a cable-tramway (return-fare 15 0.). At the t0p
are a Capuchin monastery, founded in 1583, the church of Santa
Maria del Monte, a small garden-restaurant, and a Station of the
Italian Alpine Club, with maps and other collections, and abelvedere
(adm., see p. 27). The *View (best by morning-light) embraces the
river, city, plain, and the chain of the Alps in the background;
comp. the opposite Panorama.
