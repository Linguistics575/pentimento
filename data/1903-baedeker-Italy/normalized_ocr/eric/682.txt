Adjacent to the church is the entrance to the once far--famedV
monastery of San Marco (Pl. G, 3), suppressed in 1867, and now
restored and fitted up as the Museo diSan Marco (adm., see p. 437;
catalogue, 1869, 11/2 fr.). The building was originally occupied
by'Silvestrine' monks, but was transferred under Cosimo the Elder
to the Dominicans, who were favoured by the Medici. In 1437-43
it was restored in a handsome style from designs by Mieheloazo,
and shortly afterwards it was decorated by Fra Giovanni Angelica
da Fiesole (1387-1465) with those charming *Frescoes which to this
day are unrivalled in their portrayal of profound and devoted piety.
The painter Fro Bartolomeo delta Porta (1475-1517) was a monk
in this monastery from 1500 and the powerful preacher Girolama
Sacanarola (burned at the stake in 1498, see p. 442) also once
lived here.

the wall, opposite the entrance leads to the CHAPTER House, which contains
a large'Crucifixion (Christ between the thieves), surrounded by a group of

The sympathetic grief of the saints is most poignantly expressed.

The door in the E. corner of the cloisters leads to a vestibule contain-
ing photographs of Fra Angelico's paintings, beyond which is the Guru
Burnoronr. The back-wall of the latter is adorned with the so-called
*Providenza (the brothers and St. Dominic seated at a table and fed by
two angels), and a Crucifixion by Gian. Ant. Sogltant.

The door to the left of the chapter-house leads to the SECOND Caorsrass,
which, with the rooms on the right, have accommodated since 1898 the
