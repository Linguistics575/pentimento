The Bagnidi Lucca (season, May 1st to Sept. 15th), which were known
as early as the 10th cent. under the name of the'Baths of Corsena', with
sp varying in temperature from 98° to 130° Fahr., consist of several
ditYerent villages in the valley of the Lima. They are much frequented
by English and American visitors. Ponte a Berraglio (ca. 410 ft.), the
chief of these villages. is picturesqnely situated on the bend of the rivalet.
Here are'Pag'nr'ni's Ham d'Europs ct d'Amét-ique,'Psra's Halal New York,
and the Grand Hatel des Batns ds Lacquer, with little difference in their
charges (cheaper in Sept); the Cafes Pasta and Italta, in the Piazza del
Ponte; the best Baths } - a Casino, with billiard and ball, rooms; and the Post
Office. Good furnished apartments, carriages, and donkeys may be had,
but the shops are poor. Physician, Dr. Marchi .--- Adjoini the Hotel
Pagnini, on the Lima, is the ro al Casino Bidet", built in 1.

Beautiful avenues ascend ually from Ponte a Serraglio to (1 hi.) Villa
(ca. 490a,'Hdt. Vittoria, -' 0t. du Parc, pens. 6-8 in; Heat Omtinental;
Hat. du Pam'llon; Hat. Queen Victoria, all with gardens; English chemist),
where are the best and quietest a artments (leasantest on the river-side
of the main street) the English ch (serv ces in summer at 10.30 lit 6,
conducted by the English chaplain from Pisa, p. AOL), and a Casino (with
reading and ball-rooms, concerts, etc.), and to ('Is M.) Bagni Caldi ('Grand
Ham dos Therm, formerly the chateau of the Grand--Duke of Tuscany,
pens. 6-8 fr.). The mud-baths of Bagni Caldi are efficacious in rheumatism
and gout; and there is a grotto with a natural vapour bath. The freedom
from dust, glare, and excessive heat makes this a delightful summer-resort.

---- To the baths of Lucca belong also the establishments of Bernabb (named
after an inhabitant of Pistoja cured here in the 16th cent), Docce Barre,
and San Giovanni.

The valley of the Lima is cool and well-shaded, chiefly with chest-
nut-trees, affording pleasant walks. Only the paths between Ponte a
Berraglio and Villa and Bagnl Caldi are provided with benches. There
are footpaths on both banks of the stream as far as the suspension-bridge
it Fornolt. Beautiful excursions may also be taken among the mountains,
uuch as to the village of Lualtano, to Benabbto (with an.old castle, and
.o' the top ofrthe Monte Prato Fiort'to (426011.) .--Boscolango (p.) may
