ITALIAN ART. xliii

truth, fidelity to nature, and a correct rendering of real life in
its minutest details are among the necessary qualities in a
perfect work. The realism of the representation. is, however, 011: 1:33;;
only the basis for the expression of lifelike character and "Issues
present enjoyment. The earlier artists of the Renaissance ARTISTS T0
rarely exhibit partiality for pathetic scenes, or events which "URE'
awaken painful emotions and turbulent passions, and when such
incidents are represented, they are apt to be somewhat exagger-
ated. The preference of these masters obviously inclines to cheerful
and joyous subjects. In the works of the 15th century strict faith-
fulness, in an objective sense, must not be looked for. Whether the
topic be derived from the Old or the New Testament, from history or
fable, it is always transplanted to the immediate present, and adorn-
ed with the colours of actual life. Thus Florentines of the genuine
national type are represented as surrounding the patriarchs, visiting
Elizabeth after the birth of her son, or witnessing the miracles of
Christ. This transference of remote events to the present bears a
striking resemblance to the naive and not unpleasing tone of the
chronicler. The development of Italian art, however, by no means
terminates with mere fidelity to nature, a quality likewise displayed
by the contemporaneous art of the North. A superficial glance at
the works of the Italian Renaissance enables one to recognise the
higher goal of imagination. The carefully selected groups of digni-
fled men, beautiful women, and pleasing children, occasionally
without internal necessity placed in the foreground, prove that at-
tractiveness was pre--eminently aimed at. This is also evidenced by
the early-awakened enthusiasm for the nude, by the skill in dispos-
ition of drapery, and the care devoted to boldness of outline and
accuracy of form. This aim is still more obvious from the keen
sense of symmetry observable in all the better artists. The indi-
Vidual figures are not coldly and accurately drawn in conformity
with systematic rules. They are executed with refined taste and
feeling; harshness of expression and unpleasing characteristics are
sedulously avoided, while in the art of the North (ag. in wood-cuts
and engravings) physiognomic fidelity is usually accompanied by ex-
treme rigidity. A taste for symmetry does not prevail in the forma-
tion of the individual figure only; obedience to rhythmical precepts
is perceptible in the disposition of the groups also, and in the com-
position of the entire work. The intimate connection between Italian
painting (fresco) and architecture naturally leads to the transference
of architectural rules to the province of pictorial art, whereby not
only the invasion of a mere luxuriant naturalism was obviated, but
the fullest scope was afi'orded to the artist for the execution of his
task. For, to discover the most efi'ective proportions, to inspire life
into a scene by the very rhythm of the lineaments, are not accom-
plishments to be acquired by extraneous aid; precise measurement
and calculation are here of no avail; a discriminating eye, refined
