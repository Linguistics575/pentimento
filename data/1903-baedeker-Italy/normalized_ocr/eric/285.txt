The HIGH Roan ascends along the vine-clad slo as to Bernie (2083 ft.).
To the N. rises the precipitous Home Hasuces'o 0 it), a landslip from
which in 1807 blocked up the narrow channel of the Adda, and converted
the. valley as far as Tovo into a vast lake. At (8 M.) Mano the road
crosses to the right bank of the Adda, and beyond Grosotto (1965 ft.; Alb.
Pini) it crosses the Roasco which here issues from the Val Grose'na. To
the left, at the mouth of1 the latter, is the imposing ruined castle of
Venosla. Beyond Grosto the road recrosses to the left bank .--6 M. -

Austrians and Garibaldiaus. At the end of the pass, in the green Valle
di Sotto, lie the hamlets of Morignone and (farther on) Sant' Antonio.

Beyond (18'I2 M'.) Ceppina (Osteria Piccagnoni) we reach the level green
valley (Piano) of Bormio, enclosed by lofty mountains, the lower elapse
of which are clothed with pines, and the upper in part with snow. At
Santa Lucia (3340 ft.) we cross the Frodolfo just above its confluence with
the Adda. The road runs to the N.E. to (91/: M.) -

B. 11/2, D. 4, S. 3, pens. 8-12 fr.) and are closed from the middle of Oct

Bormio, are a little higher up (4750 ft.), perched on the rocks below the
road; a picturesque footpath, shorter than the road, ascends to them in
'/4 hr. (good hotel, less expensive than the New Baths). The seven springs,
containing salt and sulphur (NO-105Â° Fahr.), rise in the Dolomite cliffs
near the old baths, whence the water is conducted to the new baths in
pipes. They are mentioned by Pliny and Cassiodorus. The old Roman
baths (pacine) hewn in the rock are interesting .--- From Bormio over
