Turin (785 ft.), Ital. Torino, the ancient Taurasia, capital of
the Taurini, a Ligurian-Celtic tribe, destroyed by Hannibal B.C.
218, afterwards the Roman Augusta Taurinorum, was the capital
of the County of Piedmont in the middle ages, and in 1418 became
subject to the Dukes of Savoy, who frequently resided here. From
1720 it was the capital of the-Kingdom of Sardinia, and from 1869
to 1865 of Italy. The seat of a university (founded in 1404), of
In archbishop, and of a military academy, and headquarters of the
ist Italian Corps d'Arme'e, this great city lies in an extensive plain
on the Po, which receives the waters of the Dom Riparia below
the city. The plain of the P0 is bounded on the W. by the Graian
and Cottian Alps, and on the E. by a range of hills rising on the
right bank, opposite the city (Monte dei Cappuccini, p. 39; Superga,
p. 39). Turin was the chief centre of those national struggles which
led to the unification of Ital y. The removal of the seat of government
to Florence seriously impaired the prosperity of the citizens for a
time, but they have long since recovered their losses. The rapidly
increasing population new numbers upwards of 329,600, including
the suburbs.

. Turin is conspicuous among the cities of Italy for the regularity of

Its construction. Its plan presents rectangular blocks of houses (hole), long,

broad, straight streets (Vie), frequently with arcades (Portia), and spacious

squares. Its history explains this. The plan of the old town, with slight

Variations, is the same as that of the colony founded by the Emperor

Augustus, or even of an older Roman camp. It formed a rectangle of

2210 ft. in length and 1370 ft. in breadth, and had eleven towers on

Etch side. Its site is now bounded by the Piazza Castello on the E., the

Via della Consolata and the Corso Siccardi on the W... the Via. Giulio on

the N., and the Via. Santa Teresa on the S. The ancient Via Decumana
