Near the Monte dei Cappuccini, opposite the Ponte Vittorio
Emanuele Prime (see above), stands the large domed church of
"Indra di Dio (Pl. G, 4), erected by Ferd. Bonsignore in 1818-31
in imitation of the Pantheon at Reme, to commemorate the return
of King Victor Emmanuel I. in 1814. In front of the church rises a
Honument of Victor Emmanuel I. (d. 1824), by Gaggini .---- A few
hundred yards to the E. is the Villa delta Regina. (P1. H, 5), now a
school for the daughters of officers who have fallen in battle.

Polite delle Benne by the Strada del Regio Parco, a shady avenue
(steam-tramway from the Piazza Emanuele Filiberto, p. 36). In the
front section, to the left by the wall, is the tomb of Silvio Pellico

The *Superga. (2205 ft.), the royal burial-church since 1778,
umpicuously situated on a hill to the E. of Turin, is well worthy

The Superga, a votive offering dedicated by Victor Amadeus II.
on the occasion of the raising of the siege of Turin in 1706 (p. 24),
and erected in 1717-31 from designs by Juvara, is a handsome
edifice with a lofty dome and an imposing portico in the style of an
antique temple, and has a spacious octagonal interior. It includes
{ library and a suite of royal apartments (never occupied). We enter
