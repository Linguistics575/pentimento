'Thou art the garden of the world, the home

Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;
.E'en in thy desert, what is like to thee?

Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste

More rich than other climes fertility,

Thy wreck a. glory, and thy ruin graced

With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.

I. Travelling Expenses. Money.

Expenses. The cost of a tour in Italy depends, of course, on the
traveller's resources and habits, but, as a rule, it need not exceed
that incurred in other much-frequented parts of the continent. The
average expenditure of a single traveller, apart from railway-fares,
may be estimated at 15- 25 francs per day, or at 10- 20 francs when
a prolonged stay is made at one place; but persons acquainted with
the language and habits of the country may easily restrict their ex-
penses to still narrower limits. Those who travel as members of a
party effect a considerable saving by sharing the expense of guides,
carriages, and other items. When ladies are of the party, the ex-
penses are generally greater.

Money. The French monetary system is now in use throughout
the vvhole of Italy. The franc (lira or frame) contains 100 cmtesimi,
lfr. 250. =--- 1 a. (comp. p. ii). In copper (bronze or rams) there are
coins of 1, 2, 5, and 10 centesimi, and in nickel pieces of 20 and
40 c. In silver there are pieces of 1, 2, and 5 fr., but coins issued
before 1863 are refused. The gold coins (10, 20, 50, and 100 fr.)
have disappeared entirely from circulation, their place being taken
by Biglietti di State (treasury-notes) of 5,10, and 25 fr.., and the
banknotes of the Banca d'Italia. All other banknotes should be
refused .---- All foreign silver and copper coins should also be refused,
