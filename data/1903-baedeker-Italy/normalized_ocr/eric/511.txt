Piazza. del Duomo, built in the Lombard-Romanesque style in 1196-
1270, externally octagonal, with three round-arched portals, is
constructed of Veronese marble, and consists of five stories with
colonnades; the flat roof is surmounted by seven pyramidal turrets
and by a belfry added in the 17th century. Around nearly the whole
exterior of the building runs a series of medallions, representing
various animals of symbolical import. The portals are adorned with ยง
the following Scriptural subjects :--'

At the N. Portal (towards the Piazza), above, is the Adoration of the
Magi; then the History of John the Baptist; on the doonposts are genea-
logical trees of Jacob and of Jesse .--- At the W. Portal, above, a curious'
representation of the Last Judgment. On the door-posts to the left, Christ'
performing works of mercy; on the right, the six ages of man .--On the
S. side is an Allegory of Death from the story of Barlaam and Josaphat.'
All these are probably by Benedetto Antelamt, whose name appears as the
master from the inscription on the N. partal.

The INTERIOR (closed; key in the house No. 2, opposite the S. entrance)
is sixteen-sided, with thirteen niches and three doorways below and two
galleries above, and graceful columns on the walls. The sculptures have 1
been only partly completed. Above the doors are sculptures of the 13th cent,
and on the E. side of the lower galleries is a series of *Reliefs of the 1
months (incomplete) and other works of the 13th century. The Roman--:
enque frescoes in the dome (13th cent.), representing the history of John,
the Baptist and prophets, are of interest to students of art .--The whole 1
population of Parma since 1216 is said to have been baptised here. The,
font dates from 1294.'
