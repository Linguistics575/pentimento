The Via Balbi ends at the PIAZZA Aoousvnnnn (P1. 0, 2), the
large square in front of the railway-station, the terminus of the
electric tramway along the Via di Girconvallazione a Monte, and a
station on the electric line to the Piazza Deferrari (comp. p. 68).
On the N. side of the Piazza, embosomed in palm-trees, rises the
marble Statue of Columbus (erected in 1862), who was probably
born at Genoa in 1446 or 1447 (d. in 1506 at Valladolid). At the
feet of the statue, which leans on an anchor, kneels the figure
of America .--- Opposite (SE)'is the Palazzo Faraggiana, with a
marble relief in the pediment representing scenes from the life of
Columbus.

To the W. of the station is the PIAZZA mu. PRINCIPE (Pl. B, 2),
which commands a good view of part of the old fortifications. A
large Bronze Monument, 40 ft. high, by Giulio Monteverde, was
erected here in 1896 in honour of the Duke of Galtiera (pp. 71,72).
It represents Liberality, led by a winged genius and handing to
Mercury treasures from her cup. On the pedestal is a medallion of
the duke .--- No. 4 in the piazza W. side) is the long---

Palazzo Doria (Pl. A, B,, presented in 1522 to Andrea
Doria,'padre della patria' (d. 156, at the age of 92). It was remod-
elled in 1529 from designs by Era Gino. Ang. Montorsoli, and
adorned with frescoes and grotesques by Perin del Vega. The elder
branch of the Doria family, to which the palace belongs, has allied
itself with the Pamphili family, and generally resides at Rome.

The long Latin inscription on the side next the street records that
Andrea d'Ore'a, admiral of the Papal, Imperial, French, and native fleets,
in order to close his eventful career in honourable repose, caused the
palace to be rebuilt for himself and his successors. His praises were
thus sung by Ariosto:'questo e quel Doria, che fa dai pirati sicuro il
Yostro mar per tutti i lati'.

To the right in the court is a large arcaded loggia, to the left a taste-
ful garden and a fountain by the Carlene (1599- 601), with a statue of
Andrea Doria as Neptune .--- The last door on the right admits us to the
apartments with Perm del Vaga's Fnascoas (restored in 1845). On the ceiling,
vaulting, and lunettes of the great entrance-hall are scenes from Roman
history, below which are reliefs by Montorsoh'; on the staircase are taste;
ful grotesques. A corridor on the first floor, with portraits of the Doria
family, is charmingly decorated with stucco and painted ornaments in the
gtyle of Raphael's loggie in the Vatican; a saloon with a large ceiling-paint-
mg, Jupiter overthrowing the Titans (superb chimney-piece); and a side-
room with a ceiling-fresco of the Carita Romana.

The gardens on the hill beyond the railway-line, with a colossal
statue of Hercules ('Il Gigante') in a niche, also belong to the estate.

A Cable Tramway (No. 3, p. 68) ascends from the Piazza Principe to
Granarolo (770 ft.; Ristorante Beda, which commands a fine view of the
town and the Val Polcevera (p.).
