Climate. Rapallo is surrounded on the N. by a semicircle ot' moun-
tains, which unite with the promontory of Portotino on the W., to forms
tolerable shelter against the wind. Bapallo is cooler, moister, and, rainier
than Nervi, but far excels it in the number of its attractive walks.

Rapallo, a small seaport with 10,343 inhab., who make lace and
do a brisk trade in olive-oil, has become a frequented winter-resort,
owing to its agreeable climate and beautiful situation. The old
Castello, on the beach, is now a prison and coast--guard station. An
ancient Roman bridge here is known as'Hannibal's Bridge'.
