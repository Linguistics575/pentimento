Room XXIII ('Rafi'aello'). "Raphael's far-famed Sposalizio, or
the Nuptials of the Virgin, painted in 1504 for the church of San
Francesco in Citta di Castello, where it remained till 1798.

The composition closely resembles that of the Sposalizio of Perugz'no
(now at Cabin), in whose studio Raphael then worked.'In both paintings
the top is rounded, and in both a small polygonal temple, a charming
forecast of Bramante's buildings, rises in the background. The central

art of the foreground is occupied by the long-bearded high-priest, who
wins the hands of the bridal pair; Mary is attended by a group of graceful
virgins, while near Joseph stand the rejected suitors, the most passionate
of whom breaks his shrivelled wand. A closer examination of Raphael's
work, however, divulges so many points of divergence as to make the
observer almost oblivious to its Peruginesque character. The transposition
of the bride and bridegroom with their attendant groups to opposite
sides of the canvas is a purely external difference and one of little signi-
ficance, but the conception and drawing of the individual figures and the
more delicate disposition of the grouping reveal the original and peculiar
genius of the younger artist" .--'Rafiael and Michelangelo', by Prof. An;
