N.E.' to the Piazza delle Erbe by the narrow VIA NuovA LAs'rmcarA
and its prolongation, the VIA NuovA (Pl. E, 3), tOgether forming
the chief thoroughfare of the city (corso in the evening).

In the Via della Seals, one of the 8. side-streets of the Via Nuova,
is the church of Santa Marta delta Scala (Pl. E, 8), with an early-Renais-
sance portal and frescoes of the school of Vittore Pisano (in the bell
chamber, to the right of the high-altar) .--- This street is prolonged by
the Via San Cosimo, at No. 8 in which (Marciano mm) is a good
replica of Seb. del Piombo's so-called'Dorothea' at Berlin.

the Piazza delle Erbe (Pl. E, 3), an old house (Nos. 19-25) on the
