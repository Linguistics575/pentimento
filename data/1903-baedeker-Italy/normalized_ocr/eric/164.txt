new Magazzim' Generali. 5---- The Via San Lorenzo ascends from the
Via Vittorio Emanuele to the cathedral, see p. 74.

A Bow IN THE Hannoun (2 fr. per hour for 1-4 perm; bargain before-
hand) is very attractive when the sky is clear and the sea calm. We first
proceed to the end of the Halo Vecchto, on which stands a small Fanale
or lighthouse (Pl. A, 5; no admission). Thence we cross to the Bacim'
dt' Carmaaio (Pl. 0, D, 7, 8), large dry docks constructed in 189395.
After seeing these, we row past the end of the Halo Giana (lighthouse;
Pl. 0, 8, 9) to the Halo Daca at Galliera, which commands a fine view of
the city and mountains. Hence we return on foot. passing the Quarantine
Station, and traverse the Mole Nuovo to the large lighthouse (p. 8?), which
may now be visited. Then by electric tramway (No. 11; p. 88) to the
Darsena (p. 72).

The following route avoids the noisy and crowded streets near
the harbour. From the SE. end of the Darsena (Pl. 0, 3), whence
the Via delle Fontane leads to the left to the Piazza dell' Annunziata
(p. 79), we pass through the Gothic Porto dei Vacca, erected on the
site of the N.W. town-gate of 1159 and adorned with mediaeval
sculptures and towers, to the Via del Campo (Pl. D, 4) and the
PIAZZA FOSBATBLLO (Pl. D, 4). From this piazza the Via Lomellini,
with the Palazzo Centurione (No. 1), by Alessi (?), and the house
in which Mazzini was born (No. 33), leads to the left to the Piazza
dell' Annunziata (p. 79).

In'the small Piazza San Siro, a few paces to the E. from the
Piazza Fossatello, is the old cathedral of SAN SIBO (Pl. D, E, 4),
rebuilt about 1578, with a facade of 1830, containing frescoes by
Gioo. Batt. Carlene.

Then through the Via di San Luca to the PIAZZA Barrera, with
the Exchange (Loggia de' Bambi, Borsa; Pl. D, 5), adorned with
a marble figure of Caoour by Vine. Vela (business-hours, 11-3) .--
To the left of the Exchange, the narrow VIA Onnrror (Pl. D, E, 5),
with numerous goldsmiths' shops (a door on the right is adorned
with an Adoration of the Magi in relief, 15th cent.), and then the
Piazza Soziglia (P1. E, 5) and the Via Luccoli, lead to the Piazza
delle Fontane Marose (p. 76).

To the N. of the Piazza Soziglia is the church of Santa Maria delle
Visas (Pl. E, 5), with three Gothic figures above the side-portal on the
l'lght, and a tower of the 13th century. The fine interior was restored in
the late~Renaissance style in 1586; in the chapel to the left of the choir is a
wooden crucifix with painted statues of the Virgin and St. John, by
Hwagliano. The church is adjoined by a ruined cloister of the 11th century.
- 0n the'3. side of the Piazza Soziglia (Piazza Campetto, No. 8) is the
handsome Palauo Imperiali, by G. B. Castello (1560). -

From the Exchange the Via San Pietro della Porta, passing the
former church of San Pietro de' Banchi (1583), with its high flight
of steps, leads to the S. to the Via San Lorenzo (see p. 74).

' The steep streets to the S. of the Via Vitt. Emanuele (p. 72) and the

188m Lorenzo, in the'oldest and most unsavoury part of Genoa, contain
several churches of considerable artistic interest. The Vin San Giorgio,
a side-street of the Via Vitt. Emanuele, and the continuation of the above.
mentioned Via San Pietro della Ports, both lead to the Fuzz; San Grenoro
(Pl- D, 6), on the 8.13. side of which stands the church of San Giorgio, a
baroque structure with a dome, containing a Pieta by the Spanish master:
