lx ITALIAN ART.

towns. GIULIO Romano, for example, entered the service of the
Duke of Mantua, embellished his palace with paintings, and
1333;" designed the Palazzo del re (p. 240), while Pram em. VAGA
' settled at Genoa (Pal. Doria). These offshoots of Raphael's

school, however, soon languished, and ere long ceased to exist.
The NORTHERN Sonoons of Italy, on the other hand, retained
their vitality and independence for a somewhat longer period. At
Bologna the local style, modified by the influence of Raphael,
was successfully practised by Ban'r. Rmnxom, surnamed
8135222," Baoxaoavmo (1484--1542). Fen-am boasted of Bone
'' Dossr (ca. 1479-1542) and Bnmmrro Trsr, surnamed Gane-
PALO (1481-1559). At Verona the reputation of the school was
maintained by Funcnsoo Gaao'ro (1470-1546) and PAOLO Momma,

surnamed Cavazzona (1486-1622).

The most important works produced in Northern Italy were those
of ANTONIO ALLEGBI, surnamed Connnooro (1494-1534), and of
the Venetian masters. Those who visit Parma after Rome
and Florence will certainly be disappointed with the pie-
tures of Correggio. They will discover a realistic tendency in his
works, and they will observe, not only that his treatment of space
(as in the perspective painting of domes) is unrefined, but that
his individual figures possess little attraction beyond mere natural
charms, and that their want of repose is apt to displease and fatigue
the eye. The fact is, that Correggio was not a painter of all-em-
bracing genius and far-reaching culture, but merely an adopt in
chiaroscuro,'who left all the other resources of his art undeveloped.
In examining the principal works of the VBNBTIAN SCHOOL, how-
ever, the traveller will experience no such dissatisfaction (comp.
p. 268). From the school of Giovanni Bellini (p.1ii) emanated
the greatest representatives of Venetian painting--- Groa-
GIONB, properly Bmmur (1477? -1510), whose works
have unfortunately not yet been sufficiently well identified, the
elder Puma (1480-1528), and Tiaiano Veoellio (1477-1576), who
for nearly three quarters of a century maintained his native style at
its culminating point. These masters are far from being mere colo-
rists; nor do they owe their peculiar attraction to local inspiration
alone. The enjoyment of life and pleasure which they so happily
pourtray is a theme dictated by the culture of the Renaissance (a
culture possessed in an eminent degree by Titian, as indicated by
his intimacy with the'divine' Aretino). Their serene and joyous
characters often recall some of the ancient gods, showing the manner
in which the artists of the Renaissance had profited by the revived
study of the antique. Properly to appreciate Titian it is of impor-
tance to remember how much of his activity was displayed in the
service of the different courts. His connection with the family of
Este began at an early period; he carried on an active intercourse
with the Gonzagas at Mantua, and executed numerous pictures for

Courtroom.
