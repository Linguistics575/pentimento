402 Route 55. PONTEDERA. From Leghorn

by Gino. dall' Opera, with four Turkish slaves ('I quattro Mori') in
bronze by Pietro Taeea. The harbour consists of the inner harbour
(Porto Vecchio, or Medieeo), too shallow to admit vessels of large
tonnage, and the Porto Nuooo, constructed from 1854 onwards,
protected from the open sea by a semicircular mole. An excursion
by boat will be found pleasant in fine weather (1-11/2 fr. per hr.,
bargain necessary). The platform of the lighthouses (Faro; Pl. A, 1,
and A, 3) on the outer mole affords a good survey of the town and
the sea, with the islands of Elba, Gorgona, and Capraja .--The old
Protestant Cemetery, adjoining the English Church (p. 400), con-
