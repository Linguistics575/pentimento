to the Piazza del Duomo. The Via di Ports Rossa, the first side-
street to the left, leads to the Mercato Nuovo, where flowers and
straw and woollen wares are now sold. The market is adorned with
a good copy of the antique boar in bronze (p. 469, by Pietro Tacea;
the handsome arcades are by G. B. Tasso (164). In the niches
are modern statues of celebrated Florentines, among them Michele
diLando by Ant. Bortone, Giov. Villani by Trentanove, and Fernando
Gennini by Mancini. Farther on in the same street (No. 9; on
the left) is the Paloma Davanzatt (Pl. E, 6), a well-preserved
castellated building of the 14th cent., with a picturesque court
(hence to Santa Trinitd, see p. 606).

In the Via de' Calzajoli, on the left, rises the church of *Or
San Michele (Pl. E, 6), so called after the church of San Michele
in Orto, which originally occupied this site and was replaced by
a grain market in 1284. Only the lower story of the present build-
ing, dating from 1336-1412, is used as a church, the upper story,
which served as a com-magazine down to the middle of the
16th cent., being now used for lectures upon Dante. The window-
tracery is very beautiful. The external decoration of the edifice
with statues was undertaken by the twelve guilds, whose armorial
bearings, some by Luca della Robbia, are placed above the niches.

Bologna, 1002 (judges and notaries; comp. p. 440); *Christ and St. Thomas,

the left, on the 8. side, (r.) St. John, by Baccto da Hontelupo, 1616 (silk-

by Ghs'bertt and Michelson, 1422 (money-changers); above the last, two
charming statuettes (the Annunciation) by Niccolo d'Areuo (ca. 1400) .--On
the N. side, (r.) St. George by Donatello (armourers), a bronze capy of the

statuettes and reliefs from sacred history, completed, according to the in-
scription. in 1369, and erected over the miracle-working picture of the
Virgin. The best reliefs are the Annunciation and Marriage of the Virgin
