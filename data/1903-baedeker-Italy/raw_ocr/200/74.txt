ITALIAN' ART. lxiii

oemin eddtees in the Irrangemant " iigums, they preserve their
reputation u ingenious decorators, Ind underetend the art of once-
Iionllly imparting en idtml impress to their pictures; even down to
e late period in the 18th century they excel in ethtots of colour,
end by devoting attention to the yrovince of genre and lmdscape-
pelnting they 111-7 boast of having extended the sphere of their
netive ert. At the same time they cannot conceal the feet that they
have lost all faith in the ancient ideals, that they Ire incapable of
new and earnest tasks. They breathe a close, academic atmosphere,
they no longer labour like their predecessors in an independent
and healthy sphere, and their productions are therefore devoid of
absorbing and permanent interest.

This slight outline of the decline of Italian art brings us to
the close of our brief and imperfect historical sketch, which, be
it agein observed, is deeigned merely to guide the eye " the
enlightened traveller, and to aid the uninitiated in independent
discrimination uni research.
