xiii ITALIAN ART.

The word Benniuuwo is commonly understood to denigrate n
Rum? revival of the antique; but while Incient at now begun to
BAIOI lMutmim artistic taste more powerfully, and in study to he
CuLrmur. more zelionsiy prosecuted, the eeeentili ehuemer ol the
Renaissance consists by no menu exclluiveiy, or even principnily,
in the imitation " the unique; nor mm the term be tNrrtthttril
merely to nrt, Is it truly embraces the whole ymgreu of civili-
setion in Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries. How the
Renaieennce manifested itself in political life, and the diiNrttrrt
phases it uenmee in the "itmtilig Ind the eoeinl world, cannot
here be discussed. It may, however, be oheerved that the Bar-
nniesnnce in eochl life wee ohitrt1y promoted by the ‘hununieu',
who preferred geneui culture to greet profeelioml attMnnttmtrr,
who enthusustitauy reguded chelicli antiquity " the golden
age of great men , end who examined the most extensive In-
burners Ott the bins of artistic down. In the yetiod of the Re..
naissance the position of the artist with xegud to hll work , And
the nature Ind aspect of the letter are changed. The adulation 1nd
tlste ot the individual ienve & more muked impress on the work of
the nuthar then wee ever before the cue; his emtiom Ire prtr-tsmut-
ently the "Metion of his intellect; hie Alone is the ruponeibiiity,
his the rewnrd of Iucceee or the mortitieMitrn " failure. Artiste
now seek to attain wiebrity, they desire their works to be examined
and judged n tentimenida of their personnl endowments. Mere
technical skill by no means satisittyg them, although they are far
from deepising the drudgery of A handicralt (many of the melt emin-
ent quettrocentiets having received the rudiments oftheir education
in the workshop of a goldemith); the exelneive pursuit of 3 single
sphere of art is regarded by them as In indication of intellectuni
yoverty, although they aim " mutating the technique of -
brunch. They work simultaneously as painters Ind eenlptore, and
when they devote themselves to architecture, it is deemed nothing
unwanted or anomalous. A comprehensive and venttiie education,
united with refined personal eentimenm, forms their 1ottitst aim. This
they Ittnin in but few inetlnces, but thnt they eagerly uphed to it
is proved by the biography of the illustrious Leon Berna“ Aunx-n
fiMH-72), who is entitled to the ume nnk in the 15th eenmry "
Leonardo de Vinci in the 16th. Rhtioneiiy eduuted, phyaiuiiy md
morally hellthy, keenly elive to the 031111 enjoymentl of life, end
possessing clearly ileitnm1 ideas and (leeided testes, the Rsn-ieunce
ertiete necessarily xeguded m.tme and her ertietic embodiment
with Mtterent views from their predecessors. A fresh end joyous love
of nature seems to pervade the whole of this period. She not only
Mrorded an unbounded tieid to the "lentitre, but lmM-l aim Itrove
to approach her " first by a careful study of her vlrioue phenom-

and colour are zeeloueiy pursued Ind practically npplied. External
