. . 467), 1itiathl?torts (626; p. 467), two works by Giorgiane (62t,
630; p. M8), end a number of portraits.

The gol1giatiot1 is also rich in works of northern origin, the
better -of which, in spite of the proximity of the more studied
Italian pictures, maintain their peculiar charm, owing to their
depth of colouring end their unsophisticated realism. Among the
works of the EM? Fumes ScnooL, en Adoration of the Child,
the chief work of the rare master Hugo mm der Goes (48-50; p. Md)
and I smell Madonna by Memliny (703; p. 466) are specially at-
tractive. Among the principal (issuer! masters, Diirer, whose works
were highly prized in Italy and much followed by Italian painters
even before his death, is reprtssrsnbsd by an Adoration of the Magi
(in the Tribune, ly. 463), a portrait of his father (766; p. 466), two
heads of Apostles (768, 777; p.466), and an unattractive Medemu

851; p. 466). Holbain’a portrait " Richard Southwell, dating from
537 (765; p. 465), is an edminhle work. The Nerumem
SonooLs of the 17th cent. are also represented by seven] excellent
works. Among those by Ruben: Ire the portrait of his timt wife
(in the Tribune; p. 462), a smell Iheteh of the Graves (842; p. 456].
his own portrait 228; p. 459), end two pictures " scenes from the
life ofHem-l IV( 40, 147; p. Mil). The best of Rembrandt’e worn
preserved here are the two portraits of himself (451, 452; p. 459].
The Dutch gtsnrer-psinters (p. 465) have also enriched the gallery
with several important and well-yreserved works, such as Ger,
Dau’s Oake-womnn (926), a. Metm’a Lute-player (918) end the
Huntsman (972), and Jan Stem" Family feast (977). Among the
