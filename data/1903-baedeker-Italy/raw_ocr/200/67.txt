the Bacchus. 1n the beginning of the 16th cent. he returned to hie
home, where he produced his David and began work on the cycle
of freeeoel destined for the great hell of the Pelluo Veechio

the Sistine Chapel absorbed his whole attention from 1508 to 1512.
After the death of Julius, hie monument wee resumed on I more
extensive scale. The commands of the new pope, Leo X., however,
who wished to employ the artist ror the gltrritieation " hie own
femily, soon brought the embitioualy designed memorial once more
to l standstill. From 1516 onwards Michael Angelo dwelt " Darren
and Florence, occupied at tlrst with the construction Ind embellilh-
ment of the Facade of San Lorenzo, which was never completed,
end then with the Tombs of the Medici. This work .130 edvuwed
very slowly towards maturity, and " lest the "tist, disgusted with
the tyranny of the Medici, set up in their pluses those of the etetnes
which were th1iished, And mignted to Rome (about 1534). Hie ttrst
work here was the Lat Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, his next
the erection of the scanty fragments of the tomb of Pope Julius.
His lest years were mainly devoted to Architecture (St. Peter‘s).
Amateurs will best be enabled to render justice to Michael
Angelo by ilrgt devoting their attention to hie eerlier works,
among which in the provinee of sculpture the group of the Fiat!
'in St. Peter's occupies the highest rank. The statues of Becchue
and David (st Florence; pp. 473, 493) likewise do not mnemee
the cuetomery precepts of the art of the Remiaemee. Paintings of
Michael Angelo's earlier period are rare; the tineat, whether con-
ceived in the midst of hie youthful studies, or in his mntm’er years,
is unquestionably the "tailing-painting in the Sistine. The Brtthitets-
tunl arrangement of the ceiling, end the composition of the several
pictures ere equally meeterly; the taste and dls0rim'uutior1 of the
pninter end sculptor are admirably combined. In God the Father,
Michael Angelo produced I perfect type of its kind; he under-
stood how to inspire with dramatic life the Ibltnct idea of the
wt of creation, which he conceived " motion. In the prophets and
eibyle, notwithstanding the nppnrent monotony of the fundamental
intention [foreshadowing " the Retlemptio), b great variety of
psychological incidents are disylnyed end embodied in dintinet
characters. Lastly, in the so-oelled Ancestors of Christ, the forms
represented are the genuine emnuetione of Micheal Angela’s genius,
yervnded by his profound end sombre sentiments, ind yet by no
meme destitute of grecefnlneee end beauty. The demntive ttgurms
