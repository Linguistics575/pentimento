included), lies It the junction of the Valle Brembuna, watered by
the Brembo, and the Valle Seriamz, named after the rapid Sarto

Imlller trading and mamdseturing towns In Italy, although its once
fumouz fair (Tiers di Sant‘ Alessandro, middle of August to middle
of September) has lost its importmce. The town consists of two
diatinet puts, the Cittlt Alta, picturesquely situated on hills and
strongly fortiiigil by the Venetiens in 1561-88, and the much larger
new quarters in the plain (Barge San Leonardo, Barge Pignola,
Barge San Tammalo), with numerous cotton, silk, and other fac-
tories and an interesting piazza (Fina; PI. D, d).
