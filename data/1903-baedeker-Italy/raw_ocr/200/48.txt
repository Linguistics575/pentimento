while urchitectnre alone "tityiitsi1 artistic, requirements, the It-
tempte at painting and sculpture being barbarous in the ex-
treme; these, however, were the germs of the subsequent devel-
opment of ut observe'ble u ts.rly an the 11th and 12th centuries.
This has been aptly deeigmted the Romanesque period (11th-
13th cent.), and the then prevalent forms of art the Bo-
molquo style. As the Rommce languages, notwithstanding
Alterations, Idditione, and corruptions, mlintain their i11Ul rels-
tion to the Imguege of the Romans, BO Itoaunesqms Art, in
spite of m rude Ind barhmns aspect, reveals its immediate
t1eswmt from the nt of that people. The Tuscnn town! were the
principll scene " the prosecution of median} art. There an in-
dustrial populntion gndually arose, treleuree of commerce were
oollected, independent Views of life were acquired in active putty
txrntlieta, loftier common interests beeune interwoven with those
of private life, and education entered I broader and more enlight-
ened truck; and thus a taste for art also was Iwekened, And
mhetle perception developed itself. When Italinn Irehiteeture
" the Rommeeque period is examined, the ilithmnuye, between its
muster end that of contemporaneous northern works is " once
apparent. In the letter the principal aim is perfection in the
construction of vaulting. French, English, and Gemini churches
Ire unquestionably the more organically conceived, the individual
puts ere more inseparable and more appropriately arranged. But
the lnhordination " ll! other aims to that of the secure and ac-
curate formation of the vaulting does not admit of m unrestrained
mmifestation of the sense of form. The columns are apt'to he
heevy, symmetry and hmnony in the constituent members to be
disregarded. On Italian soil new architecture] ideas Ire rarely
found, constructive boldness not being here the chief object; on the
ether hand, the decorative aerengements are richer and more grate-
NI, the eeme of rhythm and symmetry more pronounced. The enth-
ednl " Piss or the church of San Miniato near Florence, both
handed as euly " the 11th century, may be taken as an exlmple
of this. The interior with its rows of columns, the mouldings
throughout, end the frat ceiling recall the basilica-type; while the
exterior, especially the (neede destitute of tower, with the small
arudes one above the other, and the variegated colours of the courses
of stone, present; a tim, deeoretive effect. At the same time the con-
struction end decoration of the wells slreairy eviuee a taste for the
elegant proportion: which we admire in later Italian structures;
the formntion of the capitals, and the design of the outlines prove
that the precepts of Intiquity were not entirely forgotten. A pe-
eulllr wneervltive spirit yervedee the medirevnl architecture of
Italy, artiste do not aim at an unknown and remote object;
the ideal which they heve in view, Although perhaps instinctive:
