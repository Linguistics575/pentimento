model was aftoriiid by Greek erehitecture, And yet the current
Greek tome Iypenred too beautilul to be lightly dioregsrdsd. The
Romnns therefore preferred to wmhine them with the nrch-prln-
tiple, Ind apply this combinction to their new arehiteeturel designs.
The individuality of the Greek orders, Illd their originally an-

prominently illustrated as in Rome or S. Italy. Nevertheless N.
Italy else contains mlny interesting relics of Roman architecture
[such as the Amphithestre at Verona, the Triumphal Arches at Anna

miration in the antique sculptures in the celle ctious " Turin, Breach,
Manma, and Florence. - Upper Italy and Tuscany stand, on the
other hand, In the very forefront of the artistic life of the middle
ages and early Renaissance, and Venice mey boast of having brilliant-
