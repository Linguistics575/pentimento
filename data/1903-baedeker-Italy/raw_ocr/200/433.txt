276 Route 42. VENICE. a. Piano ofSl. Mark:

'The Libmy or at. Mark remains the crowning triumph of Venetian
m. It is impossible to contemplate its noble double row or open nrchex
without echoing the judgment of Pularlio that nothing more eumytuanl
or beautiful bad been invented since the Age of Ancient Rome M. A. W).

On the Lagune, between the Libruy end the Royal Gardm,‘ is
the old. Zecnn (Pl. B, 6; hence 'zeeohino' or %sguitrO ox Mint, also
built by Snnsovino in 1536. The interior has just been altered to
accommodate the library of St. Mark (p. 281). Beautiful coun.

The “Puma " the Dozen (Paloma Ducale; Pr. B, 5), the W.
side of which (82 yds.) faces the Piazzetts, and the S. side (78 yds.)
the M010 and the Legune, is said to have been founded beside the
church of St. Theodore about 814 for the ttrat Dogs of Venice. It
was rebuilt after "tmf/ions in 976 and 1105, and has been
repeatedly altered and restored. The Gothic exterior, lined with
smell slabs of coloured marble, and with two pointed exudes of 107
columns C36 below, 71 above), one above the other, was thoroughly
restored in 1873-89. The 8. part dates from the 14th cent. (1309

et eeq.; large window, 1404), while the W. facade is slid to hue I

been built in 1424-33 by Giovanni Bum and his sons Pantaleane
and Bartolomeo Buon the Elder. The mNpiitiosmt tracery of the
windows In the hyper story has almost entirely disappeared in the
course of one of the restorations.

The upper arcade, called ‘La Lsggid, is remarkably righ. Won

between the two wlnmne of red marble (9th end 10th from the _

principal portal) the Republic causea’l its sentence: of death to he
proclaimed. The capitals of the short columns below (which have
no bases) are richly decorated with foliage, figures of men, and
animals. On the oorner-pillsr next the portal are interesting tigures
of Numa Pompilius, Scipio, Emperor Trajan judging the cause at
a widow, Justice, etc, s11 with inscriptions. The grnup above these
is the 'Judgment of Solomon by two unknown 1rioseutimss. At the
corner towards the Lagune, Adam uni Eve. Mr. Ruskin, who gives
an elaborate description of these sculptures in his 'Stones of Venice’,
Mrira1s that the capital under this group, 'in the workmanship and
grouping of its foliage’, is, on the whole, the tlnest he knows in
Europe. At the 8.E. angle, the sin of Noah. All these are Gothic.
In the centre of the Piazzetta facade is an alto-reliei of the Lion
of St. Mark with a kneeling Mare of Doge Andrea Witti (1523-38),
which was destroyed by the Radicals in 1797 and restored by Ur-

The transition from iate-uothie to Renaissance forms is illus-
trated by the tine portal adjoining St. Msrk's, built in 143%
