tnvellerâ€™ 3 resources and habits, but, as a rule, it need not exceed
that incurred in other 'iiUiii'-Ti't1iiii'tii' parts of the continent. The
Henge expenditure " I single traveller, apart from railwey-fares,
may be estimated at 15- 25 francs per day, or " 10- 20 francs when
a prolonged stay is made It nne place- , but yersons acquainted with
the Language and habits of the conntrymay easily restrict their ex-
yenses to still narrower limits. Those who travel as members of a
party effect a considerable saving by sharing the expense of guides,
carriages, and other items. When ladies are of the party, the ex-
penses Are generally greater.

the whole of Italy. The franc {lira orfranco) contains t00eentesimi,
ltr. 250. == 1 e. (comp. p. Ii). In copper (bromo or rame) there are
wine of I, 2, 5, and 10 eenteirimi, and in nickel pieces of 20 and
40 c. In silver there are pieces of f, 2, and 5 fr., but coins issued
before 1863 are refused. The gold coins (10, 20, 50, and 100 fr.)

by Bigtietti di State (treasury-notes) of 5, fo, end 25 m, me the
bmknotes of the Baum dUtams. All other banknote; should he
