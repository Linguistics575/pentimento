according to Vsssri, was iiriishtyd by his pupil Leonardo dd Vinci,
betrays A certain crudity in the Bgare of the Bsptist, while the
lendscspe and the two Angels distantly recall Leonsrdo’s teohnioel
skill and sense of form. Sandra Botticelli's Spring (Room IV,
No. 80), which transports us to the reslm of antique myth, is the
most popular picture in the gallery, owing to its tUry-libs charm.
Domenico Ghirlandajo was thoroughly conversant with traditional
forms, and with their aid he hss been enabled to produce majestic
and spirited Mares, and to unite in them the result of the labour
of two generations. His Madonna and angels (Room 111, No. 66 is
better preserved then the Nativity of Christ (Room VII, tG. 1 5).
A ssompsrisot1 of Ghirisndajo's simplicity of style, the outcome of
1 mature imagination, with the elsborate and exaggersted msnner
of many old masters, is most instructive. Lorenzo di Credi's Nativity
(Room Y, No. 92) is attractive on account of its beauty of expression
and the careful execution of the isudscepe. Among FmBartolameo's
yictures, Mary sppeering to St. Bernard (Room Y, No. 97) is parti-
culnly worthy of notice, us it affords u: Insight into the master’s
method " painting. Marietta Albertinelli, who is closely allied to
En Bsrtolomeo, is wellrepresented by ll Trinity (Boom m, No. 63);
his Annunciation (Room wr, No. 189) is no longer in its original
condition.

This gallery is important niso to the student of Umbrian art in
the 16th century. It possesses one of the chief works of Gentile da
Fabriano, en Umbrisn master, closely allied to Pm Angelica in his
modes of thought(Adozstion of the Magi; Room XVI, No. 165). This
work affords distinct evidence of the unity of sentiment which
existed. between the Schools " the North and South in the 15th cent.,
notwithstanding their external independence. Perurino'8 pictures
are greatly show the average merit of his works: in his Pietl
(Room III, No. 56) an admirable indHidturrity of chlrseter is ex-
hibited; his skill as a colourist is shown in his Mount of Olives
(IB), and his Assumption (57), admirable both in composition
and execution, xeveels him " the zenith of his power.

From the Vnsrmun (Room I), in which is the titMst-offims, we
proceed straight on to Roost II, the hrat portion of which is hung
with ttms Flanders tapestry (scenes from the Creation), in the style
of Baum! mm Orlay (d. 1541).
