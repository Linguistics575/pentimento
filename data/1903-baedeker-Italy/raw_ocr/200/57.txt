xlvi ITALIAN ART.

Italy in particular no worthy of examination. The iiret only Re
nnissnnca work constructed in this part " the country was thefwule
of the Canola ofPavia, a superb example of decontin architecture.
Besides the muble edifices " this period we also observe structures
in brick, in which the vaulting and pillars form prominent features.
The favourite form was either circular or that of the Greek m
(with equal ulna), the tsi1it1oty being usually crowned with a dome,
and disylaying in its interior nn exuheunt taste for lnieh enrich-
ment. or this type Me the church of the Madonna delta Croet mm
Creme Ind eevenl others at Pimema and Farm (Madonna della
Steccata). It was in this region that Bnnnwm prosecuted the studies
of which Rome afterwards reaped the bemrtit. Among the secular
buildings of N. Italy we may mention the Ospedale Maggie’s at
Milan, which shows the transition from Gothin to Rennieunoe. The
best survey of the paletill "ifitytse built of brick will be obtained
try walking through the streets of Bolom (p. 862).

The visitor to Venice will hive nn opportunity of tneing within
I very limited space the progress ot Remiselme nrehiteeture. The
church of San Ztreearia is an example of early Rennileance still in
tanWet with Gothic, while the richly coloured church of Santa Maria
dei Mirmli end the Scuola di San Marco exhibit the style in its
perfection. Foremost among the architects of Venice must be
mentioned the Lombardi, to whom most of the Venetian buildings
of the 15th cent. are attributed; but we shall nfterwutis advert to
the farther progress of Venetian arehitectnre o. xlviii). One of the
most famous architects of N. Italy was Fm 01000100 of Vanna
(1435-1515), a monk, a philologist (the disuoverex of the letters
of the younger Pliny), I botanist, an engineer, and a thoroughly
well trained architect, who at a very advanced age, after the death
of Bramante, was summoned to Rome to saperfntertd the building
of St. Peter‘s.

Examples of early RenaiSSence architecture abound In the towns
of Tuscany. At Florence, the scene of Fun?!) Bnmnzascm’s
labours (1379-1446), the attention is tshieily arrested by the church
of San Lorenzo (1425), with its two eacristies (the earlier, after
1421, by Brar1ellesehi, the later by Michael Angelo, which it "
interesting to wmpare), while the smell Cappella dei Pmi near
Santa Croce is also noticeable. The Palazza Rucellai is also import-
ant as showing the combination of pilesters with ‘mstien' , 'the
greatest advance achieved by the early Renaissance. Mena, with Its
numerous palaces, Pienm, the model " a Reneissnnee town, and
Urbino also trfrord excellent examples of the art of the Quett-roesn-
tists, but Ire beyond the limits of the present volume. While all
these ilitterent ediilees possess many features in common, they may
be classed in a number of groups, i11ffering in mlteritl and vnrio'ue
other oursstaristitss, and entirely relieving them from any reproach
of monotony.
