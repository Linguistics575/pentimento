xxviii CLIMATE.

btlf " It, while the humidity rapidly increases " we approach
the Riviera di Levmte. The name holds good of the rainfall.
While San Remo has " rainy days between November and April,
Newt Us 54, end Pisa 57. The avenge number of rainy days
during the three winter months in the Riviera is 16. Snow is
rarely seen; it fella perhaps once or twiee in the course of the
winter, but genenlly lien only for I few hours, while many yeue
plan without the eypeannee of a nlngle mow-luke. Fog! are very
rate on the Lignrlnn coast; but a heavy dew-fall in the evening is
the rule. In wmperllon with the Oiulpine districts, the Riviera
enjoys a very high proportion of bright, sunny wenther.

The above conaideretione will show that It is often necessary to
discount the unpropitious opinions of those who happen to have
visited the Riviera under peculiarly unfavourable trliaratio eon-
ditione. Not only do the ordinary four seasons differ from each other
on the Riviera, but the different parts of winter are also sharply
discriminated. A short rMny season may be counted on with almost
complete certainty between the beginning of October and the middle
of November, which restricte, bat by no means abolishes, open-air
exercise. Then follows from December to Februnry usually an un-
interrupted series of warm and sunshiny dlye, but invalide have
sometimes to be on their guard against wind. Much here, as else-
where in the south, is the windiest month of all, but is much less
boisterous in the Itllitm pert of the Riviera then in Provence.
April end May ere delightful months for those who require out-door
life in a warm climate.

The wildness of the climate of the Riviera requires, perhlpe, no
better proof than its rich southern vegeution. The Olive, which is
already found in the neighbourhood of the N. Italian liken, here
attains its full growth, while the Eucalyptus globulu: (which growe
rapidly and to an astonishing height), the Orange, the Lemon, ind
seveul varieties ot Palm also flourish.

The geological character of the Riviera is Ilse of Ianitery signi-
ihunge. The pxeuiling famation is limestone, which eheorbe the

. sunâ€™s rays with remnkehle rapidity Ind radiates it with aquel lpeed,
thus fanning an important ftctor in msking the most of the winter
sunshine. 0n aeeount " its mums it ig Mo extenlively used

forms the chief objection to a region lreqnentad by so many per-
eons with walk lungs. The authorities: of the vuioue htrstth-resoru,
however, take great pains to mitigate this evil " far as pnetluble.
