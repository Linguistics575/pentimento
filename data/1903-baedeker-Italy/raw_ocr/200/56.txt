convinced of the Mrrupt contrast between the medisevel end the
Rennieemee styles. Thus prepued, he may, for exlmple, proceed
to inspect the Pitti Palace at Florence, which, undegorsted and
pnorgmieed as it is, would scarcely be diatinguiaUbltr from a rude
pile of stones, it a Judgment were formed from the mere tLrseriptiou.
The emetic chum consists in the simplicity of the ymportions,
the jnet'neee otproportion in the elevation " the stories', and the
tuteful :djuetment " the windows in the vest surface of the fa-
ode. That the architects thoroughly understood the aesthetic effect
of symmetrical proportions is proved by the mode " t3oustra0-
tion adopted in the somewhlt more recent Florentine pllecee , in
which the roughly hewn blocks (rustice) in the successive etotiea
recede in grsGtious, end by their cueful experiments as to whether
the cornice amounting the structure should hear reference to the
highest story, or to the entire twede. The same hiae menifeete
itself in Bremlnte'e imagination; and when, tfter the exmpla of
Pelledio in chuxeh-fwedee, I Iingle series of columns wee aub-
stituted for those resting Ibove one another, symmetry of proportion
was also the object in view.

From the works of Brunelleechi o. xivi), the greatest mnter of

A taste for beauty of detail, wave] with the realistic tendency of
painting, producesjn the architecture of the 15th century an exten-
Iive applieetion of graceful and attractive ornaments, which entirely
eover the surfaces, and throw the real orgmieetion of the gdiihre into
the beekgroand. For a time the true aim of Renaissance m hype“:
to have been departed from i nuxioue care is devoted to detail instead
of to general effect; the r&epyliutiou or columns did not It tttst
admit of spacious structures; the dome rose but timidly above the
level of the roof. But this attention to minutiae, this disregard of
effect on the pm of these architects, was only, as it were, a re-.
maining of their power, in order the more completely to master,
the more grendly to develop the art.

There is no doubt that the Renaissance palates (among which
that of Urhino, mentioned in vol. ii of this Handbook, has always
been regarded u pze-eminently typical) ate more attractive then the
ehnxehes. These last, however , though destitute of the venerable
ummtione mnnected with the medieval osthedrals, beer ample
testimony to the ability of their builders. The churches ofNerthern
