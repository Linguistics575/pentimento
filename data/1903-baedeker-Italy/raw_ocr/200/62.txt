Among the various works executed by these masters, Monumental

I somewhat bombastic oharturter, they Mrord an excellent mill-
tration of the high value Mtatyheil to individudity and personal

remelned almost unaltered tor a whole century, but we cannot fail
to derive genuine pleasure from the inexhaustible fxeehneel of
