one'for the Piazzetta and one for the Giudecca (see p. 261). The
street to the right of the church leads to (3 min.) the Academy
(p. 283).

g. From the Piazza of St. Mark on foot to the Academy and
Santa Maria della Salute. San Giorgio Maggiore. Giudecca.

The passage in the S.W. corner of the Piazza of St. Mark leads
to the Ssuzzana SAN Moran, with its numerous shops. To the
right is the Frczseria (p. 2633), another busy street. To the left is
the church of Ban noise (Pl. G, 6), with an over-decorated facade
by Al. Tremignan (1668), ‘notable’, says Mr. Ruskin, ‘as one of the
basest examples of the basest school of the Renaissance’. John
Law (1671-1729), originator of the ‘Mississippi Scheme’, is buried
in this church. Beyond it we cross the bridge and proceed straight
on along the VIA VENr-rnun Manzo.

The second side-street to the right, the Calle delie Vests leads to the
Campo San Fantino, in which are situated the Teatro Fenicc 1. F, 6):, the
Alonso Vanda (see p. 263), aRenaissance building by Al. Vittoria, formerly
the Swola at San Girolamo; and the church of SAN FANTINO, built in the
early-B enaissance style after 1500, with a fine choir by Jac. Samovtno (1533).

The Via Ventidue Marzo crosses a second bridge and leads to
the church of Santa Maria Zobenigo (Pl. F, 6), erected in 1680-83
by Gina. Hawaii for the Barbaro family (‘barbaro monumento dcl
decadimcnto dell’ arte’, as it has been called). The niches of the
baroque facade contain statues of members of the family. At the
base of the lower row of columns are plans of Zara, Candis, Padua,
Rome, Corfu, and Spalato, hewn in the stone; above are representa-
tions of naval battles.

Leaving this church, we cross the Campo San Maurizio, where
the small church of that name is situated, to the larger Castro
Fnancnsco MonosINr (Pl. E, F, 6), which has been embellished
since 1882 with a marble statue of Niccolb Tommasco, philosopher
and teacher (d. 1874), by Franc. Barzaghi, of Milan. To the left
is the Pal. Morosini and to the right is -—

*Santo Stefano Pl. F, 5, 6), a Gothic church of the 14th cent.,
with an elegant facade in brick and good window-mouldin gs in terra-
cotta. The interior has a peculiarly constructed vaulting of wood,
which, along with the wide intervals of the slender columns, im-
parts a very pleasing appearance to the interior and recalls San
Fermo at Verona (p. 230). On the walls are ancient frescoes, re-
cently discovered and found to be in good condition.

ENTRANCE WALL, above the principal door, equestrian statue of Dom.
Contarini, middle of 17th cent; adjacent, (1.) the fine tomb of the physician
Jacopo Suriano (d. 1511). On the PAVEMENT of the nave is the large tomb-
