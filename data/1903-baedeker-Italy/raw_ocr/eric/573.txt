394 Route 53. RAVENNA. Erwirons.

About 2 M. from the Porto Nuova (Pl. F, 7), and not far
from the ancient harbour of Ravenna, which has been entirely
silted up since the 18th cent., is the church of Santalaria in
Porto Fuori, a basilica with open roof, erected by the Blessed
Pietro degli Onesti (‘Pietro il Peccatore’) in 1096 et seq. The left
aisle contains an ancient Christian sarcophagus with the bones of
the founder (d. 1119). The choir and the adjacent chapels contain
beautiful frescoes by masters of the Bimini school (13- 14th cent).
The massive substructures of the lofty square campanile are said to
have belonged to an old lighthouse (fare). The church is mentioned
by Dante (Paradise xxr, 123). .

No traveller should quit Ravenna without visiting the church of Sasr‘
Aroursans IN CLASSE, situated 3 M. to the S.E. of the Porta Nuova. This
may be done either by carriage (with one horse, there and back, about
3—4 fr.- comp. p. 384), or by the railwa between Revenue. and Bimini,
or by the steam-tramway mentioned at . (trains step at Claus between
June ist and Sept. 30th only; fares , 45, 35c.). About halfway, both
the road and the railway cross the united rivers (Fiumt' Unfit) Rosco and
Montana.

*Bant’ Apollinare in Closes Fuori, erected under Archbishop
Ursicinus (536—38) by Julianna Argcntarius (‘the treasurer’) outside
the gates of Classis, was consecrated in 549 by St. Maximian, after-
wards belonged for a long period to a Camaldulensian monastery
(comp. p. 385), and was restored in 1779. This is the largest of the
basilicas still existing at Ravenna. It consists of a nave and aisles,
with a vestibule at the W. end, and a handsome round campanile.
The exterior exhibits traces of an attempt to relieve the surfaces of
the walls with indications of pilasters and arches: (For unlocking
the doors, 60 c.) .

The spacious Inrnnron (now almost destitute of colour) rests on twenty-
fonr cipollino columns, and has an open roof added in the middle ages.
The walls of the Nave and Aisles, which were stripped of their marble

anelling by Sigismundo Malatesta in 1149, have been adorned since the
¥8th cent. with portraits of bishops and archbishops of Bavenna, an un-
broken series of 130, from the ﬁrst successor of St. Apollinaris, who
suffered martyrdom in 74 under Vespasian, to the present archbishOp Each
aisle contains four marble sarcophagi of archbishops (68th cent). A
niche in the right aisle robably once contained the remains of St. Apolli-
naris. In the left aisle rs an inscription relating to the penance performed
here by Emp. Otho III. at the instigation of St. Romuald. Farther on
is an ancient capital used as a holy water basin. At the end of the aisle
is a tabernacle of the 9th cent., with an altar of the 15th century. —- The
Nuts contains a marble altar, in the ancient fashion, said to have been
erected by St. Maximianus. — The Cnrrr (12th cent), a kind of corridor
in which the remains of St. Apollinaris were deposited in 1173, is some-
times under water. The bronze window-grating, seen from without, is
ancient. — Above the crypt is the broad ﬂight of steps (restored in 1728]
leading to the Taurus, with the high-altar. The modern canopy of the
latter is borne by four ancient columns of black and white Oriental
marble. The two ends of the choir-bench terminate in the episcopal
throne of St. Damianus (688-705), which has been sawn through. The
dome of the tribune is adomed with well-preserved Mosaics of the 6th
and 7th.cent.: in the centre, a large cross on a blue ground with gilded
stars,,w1th the Transﬁguration, at the sides, Moses and Elias, below when
