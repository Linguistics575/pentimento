Apicture by Boccaccio Boccaccino (Room XVII, No. 600), a little-
known master of the earlier school, is one of the best of that period.
Palma Vccchio is represented here by one of his best works, a
recently acquired Holy Family (R. V11). Rocco Marconi’s Descent
from the Cross (R. V, No. 166) is one of his ﬁnest eﬁ‘orts. Titian’s
masterpiece, the Assumption of the Virgin (R. II, No. 40), requires
no comment; the glowing rapture of the apostles, the jubilant
delight of the angels, the beaming bliss of the Madonna, and the
magniﬁcence of the colouring cannot fail to strike the eye of every
beholder. The gallery comprises also the last, uncompleted creation
of this master: the Piste in R. X (No. 400). His Presentation in
d the Temple (R. XX, No. 626) is also very attractive owing to the
spirited grouping and the beauty of the individual ﬁgures. Boni-
fazio L’s wealth of colour is displayed in the Story of Dives (R. X,
No. 291), the Massacre of the Innocents (R. X, No. 319), and his
small Madonna (R. X, No. 269). The Miracle of St. Mark (R. II,
' No. 42) by Jacopo Tintorctto, and the Supper in. the house of Levi
3‘. (R. IX, No. 203) by Paolo Veroncsc, are specially interesting.

ROOM 11 (Sale. dell’ Assunta): “40. Titian, Assumption (‘As-
*sunta’), painted in 1516-18 for the Frari (p. 310), whose high-
faltar it once adorned, and several times restored.

, ‘There is nothing so remarkable in this enchanting picture as the con—
trast between the apparent simwicity of the results, and the science with
which these results are brought about. Focal concentration is attained by
perspective science, ap lied alike to lines and to atmosphere, at the same
tl_me that a deep an studied intention is discoverable in the subtle
distribution of radiance and gloom. . . . Something indescribable strikes
us in the joyful innocence of the heavenly company whose winged units
crowd together singing, playing, wondering and praying, some in light,
some in half light others in gloom, with a spirit of life moving in them

the Vlrgin, whose noble face is transﬁgured with gladness, whose step is
momentarily arrested as she ascends on the clouds, and with upturned

face and outstretched arms longs for the heaven out of which the Eternal
looks down. To this central point in the picture Titian invites us by all
