At Gloggnitz (1 50 ft.) begins the *Snuunnmo RAILWAY, the oldest

rapidly on the S. slope of the valley (gradient 1 :40). Beyond four
tunnels it reaches (60 M.) Klamm (2290 ft.), with a half-ruined
castle of Prince Liechtenstein, on a rocky pinnacle. Far below runs
the old Semmering road. The train now skirts the Weinzettelwand
by a long gallery and reaches (641/2 M.) Breitenstein (2530 ft.). The
ravines of the Kalte Rinne and the Untere Adtitzgraben are crossed
by lofty viaducts, between which the line ascends in curves.

Beyond (691/2 M.) Bemmering (2930 ft.) the train passes from
Austria into Styria by means of the Emma-tug Tunnel, nearly 1 M.
long. It then descends the valley of the Froeschnitz to (751/2 M.)

The STAATSBAHN, which we now follow, diverges to the right
from the South Railway, crosses the Mar, and ascends the narrow
valley of that river. Beyond (114 M.) Niklasdorf we again cross the
