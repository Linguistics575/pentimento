and MUBANO, 11/2 M. to the N. of Venice, every 1/4 hr., starting

island stands the church of S. Michele, built by Moro Coducci after
1466, and next to San Zaccaria (p. 301) the oldest Renaissance

Cappella Emiliana, erected by Gugl. Bergamasco in 1534, with three

G. P. R. James ((1. 1860), the novelist, Eugene Schuyler (d. 1890),
and Rawdon Brown are buried in the Protestant Cemetery.

Huano, a small island with 3600 inhab., has been, since the
