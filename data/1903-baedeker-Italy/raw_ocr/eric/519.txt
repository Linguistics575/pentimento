and became the scene of violent conﬂicts between the Guelphs and Ghibel-
lines, until in 1288 it eventually came into the possession of Obt'uo II.
d‘Este (d. 1293; see p. 355). -— On the death of Alphonso 11., without issue
(1597), the states of Modena and Reggio (but not that of Ferrara) fell to his
kinsman Cesare d°Este (1598), husband of Virginia de’ Medici, daughter
of Grand-duke Cosimo I. of Florence. 0n the death of Francis II. (d. 1694)
this collateral line became extinct, and the succession was taken u by
Rinaldo (d. 1737), younger son of Duke Francis 1. Hercules III. (d.1
who by the Peace of Luneville lost Modena in 1801, was the last of the
family of Este. Through his daughter Beatrice, who married Archduke
Ferdinand, the duchy came into the possession of the young? branch of
the House of Austria in 1814. The insurrections of 1821, 1 1, and 1848
were quelled with cruel severity., Francis V., the last duke, quitted his
dominions in 1859 and went over to the Austrians. After his death in
1875 the name of Este passed to the Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand.
A specialty of Modena with regard to art-history was the sculptur-
ing of Tannscorras, the aim of the artists being to represent dramatic
groups rather in accordance with pictorial than plastic rinciples, and
therefore calculated only for being exhibited in niches. his branch of
art was first fully developed by the strongly realistic master Guido Ha:-
som’ (1450-1518), who worked also in Naples and at the court of France.
Some of his works are in the crypt of the cathedral (p. 349), and in San
Giovanni Battista (p. 349). The art was next practised in a more reﬁned
style by Antonio Begarells’ (14.98.1565), who, imbued with the best spirit of
the Renaissance, usually rejected the aid of painting, and brought it to the
utmost perfection of which it seems capable. '

In the PIAZZA Gannon, in the centreIof the city, near the Corso
della Via Emilia (p. 349), stands the —

*Cathedral (P1. B, 4), begun in the Romanesque style in 1099
by Lanfranco and consecrated in 1184, with a superstructure of
later date. The facade is relieved by a large rose-window and a
simple colonnade (groups of three arches each enclosed by a larger
arch), which is continued round the whole building. The portals
are adorned with the usual marble lions. The sculptures of the
facade, representing the Creation and the history of the ﬁrst men
down to Noah, are by Nicolaus and Wiligelmus (1099; comp. p. 349);
those on the ﬁrst S. portal (left) are by Anselmo do Campione (1299);
and on the last S. portal, to the right near the choir, is the history
of St. Geminianus, by Agostino di Ducci of Florence (1442). The
old sculptures of the N. lateral portal are also interesting. The
choir has a tripartite semicircular termination.

The INTERIOR has been restored since 1897. The nave and aisles are
supported by alternate pillars and columns, over which runs a tnformm:
