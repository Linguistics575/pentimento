The suppressed abbey of Camaldoli (2717 ft.; I"Granola Alba-go,

pens. with wine 1‘2 fr.; Restaurant, on the groundﬂoor, cheaper) is
prettily situated in a narrow wooded valley. It was founded in
1012 by St. Romuald (d. 1027) but frequently destroyed by fire
and devastated by war. The environs are wild and beautiful.
A steep road ascends to (11/‘ hr.) the Sacro Er‘émo (3680 ft.), a
monastery with hermitages, founded in 1046 and surrounded by
ﬁne pine-woods.
. The name of the lace is said to be derived from Campus Maldoli,
after a certain pious ount Maldolus, who presented it to his friend 8t.
Romuald. From this spot the reputation of the order for austere discipline,
sanctity, and erudition extended throughout the whole of Italy, although
the number of their cloisters was never great. Camaldoli, as well as
Vallombrosa, lost its valuable library and many treasures of art through
the rapacity of the French in 1809.

The ‘Views from the narrow ridge of the A ennines at the back of
Sacro Eremo especially from the summit which s not planted with trees
called the ‘Igrato dt Ber-lone or the Prato a1 Soglto are very extensive an
beautiful. To the RE. the houses of Forli may he distinguished in clear
weather, still farther off the site of Revenue, and in the extreme distance
the glittering Adriatic; W. the chain of the Pratomagno, the lower valley
of the Arno as far as Pisa and Leghorn, and beyond them the Mediter-
ranean. The spectator here stands on one of the summits of the ‘back-
bone of Italy‘, whence innumerable mountains and valleys, as well as
the two different seas, are visible.

Walkers from Camaldoli may reach the highroad from Cesena
to Bibbiena in 11/2hr. by a rough and stony track, and then proceed
via Parttna to (6 M.) Bibbiena (p. 534). If time allows, however,
the road from Camaldoli to (71/2 M.) Pappi (p. 534) is preferable.
In the Opposite direction Camaldoli may be reached by carriage from
Poppi in '2, from Bibbiena in 21/2 hrs.

Fnou Gammon! 'ro La Vanna on foot. Pedestrians should

marshes. Above this rises the abrupt sandstone mass of the Verna,
to a height of 850 ft. On its S.W. slope, one-third of the way up, and
3660 ft. above the sea-level, is seen a wall with small windows, the
