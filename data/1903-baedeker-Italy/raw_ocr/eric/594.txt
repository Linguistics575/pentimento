Cmo Santa. ' PISA. 56. Route. 409

Paintings. To the right of the chapel, on the E. WALL: Cruciﬁxion,
ascension, the Doubting Thomas, and Resurrection, by aFoltower of Giotto
(14th cent), said by Vasari to be Buﬁ'atmacco. All these have been repainted.

0n the S. WALL: ”Triumph of Death: to the left are represented the

retired life of the pious hermit and the worldliness of the wealthy who
on their way to the chase are suddenly reminded by three open cofﬁns of
the transitoriness of human pleasures; in the centre is Death, invoked
in vain by the poor and wretched; above are devils bearing away the
souls of the deceased to a ﬁery punishment; to the right, the eternal
happiness of the blessed, who are seated in a garden, beneath pomegranate
trees; above are angels with the souls of the redeemed. Next are the
aLest Judgment (attitude of the Judge celebrated and imitated even by
Frs Bartolomeo and Michael Angelo) and Hell (lower half entirely repainted).
These three are attributed by Vasari to Andrea Orcagna, but modern critics
believe that they were executed about 1350 by Pisan masters (perhaps
Franc. Traint). The following fresco, representing the Life (temptations
and miracles) of the holy hermits in the Theban wilderness, which Vasari
ascribes to Pietro Lorenzetti of Siena, is by an unidentiﬁed hand. Above
the entrance is a'Madonna ‘in excelsis‘ by F. Trat'ni. —— Between the two
entrances, the life of St. Rainerus, the tutelary saint of Pisa. The four
ipper scenes (conversion from a worldly life, journey to Palestine, victory
aver temptation, retirement to a monastery) were completed by Andrea
ta Finn“ in 1377 (of which there is documentary proof, though Vasari
ttributes them to Simone Martini of Siena). The four lower and better-
xecuted scenes (return from Palestine, miracles, death, and removal of
[is body to the cathedral of Pisa, the last much injured) were painted
y Antonio Veneriano in 1386-7. -- Then, above, scenes from the life of
t. Ephesus (who as a Roman general, ﬁghting against the heathens,
:ceives a ﬂag of victory from the Archangel Michael, but is afterwards
indemned and executed); below, scenes from the life of St. Potitus,
lmirably portrayed by Spindle Aretino in 1391, but now almost obliterated.
Lastly, the history of Job, by Francesco da Volterra (erroneously attributed
Giotto), begun in 1370, in bad preservation.

0n the W. WALL no paintings of importance.

On the N. WALL the history of Genesis: ﬁrst the Creation (God the
tther holding the world in both hands, ‘il mappamondo‘); then in the
tper series, Creation of Man the Fall, Ex ulsion from Paradise, Cain
d Abel, Building of the Ar’k, Deluge, an Noah‘s Sacriﬁce, by Pietro
Puccio of Orvieto about 1390 (erroneously attributed by Vasari to
fohnaoco). — The lower series and all the following paintings on the N.
ii] are by Banana Gouolt of Florence (1469-86), twenty-three Representations
nm the Old Testament, admirably executed ‘a tempera‘ and important as
ustrations of the manners of the painter‘e contemporaries: Noah‘s Vintage
iDrunkenness (with the ‘ Vsrgognosa dt' Pisa‘, or scandalised female
:ctator), the Curse of Ham the Tower of Babel (with portraits of
itemporary celebrities, Cosimo de‘ Medici, his son Pietro, and his
endsons Lorenzo and Giuliano), the History of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob
l Esau, Joseph, Moses and Aaron, Fall of the Walls of Jericho, History
David, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba; these last much injured.
e ﬁrst of these frescoes, the Vintage, is the most pleasing composition,

the most’striking one for the richness of its episodes, its architecture,
. its landscape. In the midst of the short-comings of the others, however,
10220 has moments of luck, and they reveal occasional pretty episodes
