0. From the Piazza del Duomo to the Piazza San Marco and
Piazza dell’ Indipendenza by the Via Carour.

The VIA DB’ Manmnr (Pl. F, 4), beginning at the Baptistery,
and its continuation, the wide VIA Cavoun (Pl. F—H, 3, 2; formerly
Via Larga), together form the most important thoroughfare in the
N. part of the city.

At the corner of the Via de’ Martelli and the Via de’ Gori rises
the church of Ban Giovannino degli Boolﬁpi (i.e. of the Padri delle
Scuole Pie; Pl. F, 4), erected in 1352, remodelled after 1579 by
B. Ammanati, completed in 1661 by Alfonso Parigi, and in the pos-
session of the Jesuits from 1557 to 1775. The church contains pic-
tures by Allori, Franc. Can-ado, etc.

Opposite, to the right, at the beginning of the Via Cavour, is
the Palazzo Pancidtichi (Pl. F, 4), built about 1700 by Carlo Fontana,
with a relief of the Madonna by Desid erio da Settignano at the corner.

The adjoining building on the left, which has been in possess-
ion of the government gince 1814 and is now occupied by the
prefecture, is the old palace of the Medici, generally called
after its later owners the ‘Palazzo Riccardi (Pl. F, 3, 4). It was
erected about 1435 under Cosimo Pater Patrim by Michelozzo, who
here introduced the practice of tapering the rustica in the different
stories. The unsymmetrical facade is surmounted by a rich and
heavy cornice. Here Cosimo’s grandson Lorenzo i1 Magniﬂco was
born on Jan. 1st, 1449, and here he maintained his brilliant estab-
lishment. Lorenzo’s sons Piero, Giovanni, and Giuliano also ﬁrst
saw the light within its walls. Giulio, Ippolito, Alessandro, and
Cosimo I. de’ Medici (the last till 1540; comp. pp. 445, 510)
subsequently resided here, and the family continued in possession
of the palace until it was sold in 1659 by the Grand-Duke Ferdi-
nand II. to the Riccardi family, who extended it considerably to the
N. in 1714, enclosing within its precincts the Strada del Traditore,
where Duke Alessandro was assassinated by Lorenzino de’ Medici
