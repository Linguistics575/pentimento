322 Route 43. TREVISO.

esque town at the end of the lagoons, with 31,218 inhab., mostly
employed in the ﬁsheries, was founded before Venice, by which it
was soon conquered. During the war with Genoa it was taken by
the Genoese (1379), but recovered by the Venetians the following
year (comp. p. 266). The inhabitants have always differed materially
in language and customs from the other inhabitants of the lagoon-
districts; but the quaint costume of the women is now to be seen
only on a few feast-days. None of the churches are worthy of note.

Trcoiso (33 ft.), with 32,793 inhab., the capital of the province
of its own name and the see of a bishop, lies on the small river
Site, at its conﬂuence with the Botteniga, which is mentioned by
Dante (Paradise, IX, 43) under the name of Cagnan. Under the
name of Tarvisium Treviso was a place of some importance .in the
Roman era, and from 1339 onwards it belonged to Venice. It was
the birthplace of three distinguished Venetian painters, Lore-mo
Lotto, Rocco Marconi, and Paris Bordonc. Some of the narrow streets
are ﬂanked with arcades, and the facades of many houses show traces
of ancient frescoes. The city-walls, bordered by the Sile and several
canals, were constructed by Era Giocondo (p. 223) at the end of the ‘
15th cent. and are still in good preservation. .
