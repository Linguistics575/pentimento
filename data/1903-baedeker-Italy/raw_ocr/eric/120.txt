the brothers Collino; of the physicians, Prof. Riberi (d. 1861), by
Albertoni, Dr. L. Gallo (d. 1857), by Vela, and Prof. Timermans
(d. 1875), by Tabaechi; and of Pescatorc, the jurist, by Dini. The
University Library, now the Biblioteca Nazionalc (adm., see p. 26),
was founded in 1720 by Vittorio Amadeo II.

' The nucleus of the collection, which numbers over 250,030 printed
vols. and 4138 MSS., consists of the former library of the house of Savoy
and some valuable MSS. from Bobbio (p. 336). There are numerous Oriental
1135., about 400 Greek MSS. (including Theodoret‘s Commentary on the
Minor Prophets, with By7an tine miniatures; 9th cent), and 1200 Latin MSS.,
including palimpsests of Cicero and Cassiodorus, the Theodosian codex,
two Irish MSS. of the 7th cent., and Pliny‘s Histo:ia Naturalis, with
miniatures of the school of Mantegna. — Among the 1095 incunabula is
the Rationale of Guglielmo Duranti. printed by Fust at Mayence in 1459.
The library contains also many Aldine editions and a copy of the great
Bible of Plantin, presented by Philip II. of Spain to Charles Emmanuel.
Some old playing-cards (15th cent.), Fr. Basso‘s map of the world (1570),
and about 10,000 woodcuts and engravings of various schools are also
among the treasures of the library.

No. 6, to the right in the Via Accademia Albertina, is the
Accademia Albertina di Belle Arti (Pl. E, F, 3; adm., see p. 26),
founded in 1652, and transferred hither in 1833. It contains a
small collection of pictures. Among the best of the older works
(many copies) are: 126. Quinton Matsys (‘1’), Head of Christ; 140,
141. Fra Filippo Lippi, Four Fathers of the Church (wings of altar-
piece). Also numerous *Cartoons by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Bern.
Lanini, and a cartoon of Leon. da Vinci’s St. Anna with the Virgin
and Holy Child (not genuine).

The Via Montebello, the next cross-street, leads to the so-called
Mole Antonelliana (Pl. F, 3; adm., see p. 27), begun in 1863
as a synagogue by Al. Antonelli (d. 1888) and completed by the city
in 1878-89. It will be ﬁtted up as a Museo del Risorgimento (comp.
p. 36). It is a square building (44 yds. each way) resembling a
tower, with a singular facade formed of several rows of columns;
its height to the head of the copper statue ( 13 ft. high) at the t0p
is 538 ft. (Washington Obelisk 555 ft.). The dome is striking from
its bold disregard of the ordinary technical rules of construction.
The hall beneath the dome is 84 ft. square and upwards of 300 ft.
high, and contains three galleries one above the other. The upper-
most gallery commands a splendid *View of the city and the Alps,
best by morning light. (Comp. the Panorama, p. 38.)

The rominent heights are: to the N., the snowy peaks of Monte
Rosa (15, 5 ft.); to the N.W., the Gran Paradiso (13,324 ft); more to the W.
is the Rocciamelone (11,604 ft.), concealing Mt. Cenis; then, to the left, the

valley of Susa (p. 4!), with. the Sagra di San Michele (p. 3) on a conspicuous
hill; farther to the S.W. Monte Viso (12,670 ft.).

In the Via di Gaudenzio Ferrari, No. 1, is the Museo Civieo or
Innieipale d’Arte Antics. (P1. F, 3; adm., see p. 27).
