0n the N.E. side of the cathedral begins the *Conso Vrr'ronro
EMANUEL]; (Pl. F, G, 4, 5; electric tramway, see p. 114), which,
with its prolongation, the Corso Venezia (Pl. G, H, 4, 3), leads to
the Giardini Pubblici. This is the principal business-street in Milan,
containing the best shops. At No. 22 is an antique statue, known as
‘l'uomo di pietra’. Farther on is the church of San Carlo Borromeo
(Pl. F, 4, 51) a rotunda in the style of the Pantheon at Rome, eon-
secrated in 647. The adjacent Galleria dc’ Cristoforis, occupied with
sheps, was erected by Pizzala in 1830—32.

To the right, farther on, at the corner of the:r Conso Vnnnzm
and the Via Monforte, is the small Romanesque church of Santa
Babila (Pl. G, 4), near which is an old Column with a lion, the
cognizance of this quarter of the town.

In Via Monforte, to the left, is situated the Palazzo di Prefet-
tura (Pl. G, 11, 4), with a modern facade. — To the S. of this point,
in the Via 'del Conservatorio, is the church of Santa Maria della
,Passione (P1. H, 5), ‘amori et dolori sacrum’, with a spacious dome
,by Grist. Solari (1530), and a nave and facade of 169‘).

It contains a Last Supper by Gaud. Ferrari (left transept), a *Pieta
by Luini (behind the high-altar; with a predella, representing scenes
from the life of Constantine and Helena, the earliest known work of
this master, showing the inﬂuence of Borgognone and Bramantino), and
the tomb of Abp. Birago by Andrea Fusina (1495; right transe t). The
14 pilasters are adorned with ﬁgures of saints by Daniele Crcspi (1632). The
ceiling of the sacristy was painted by Bm-gognone.

The Conservatory of Music occupies the old monastery buildings.
—— In the vicinity is the Gothic monastic church of San Pietro in
Gcssatc (Pl. G, 5), built about 1460, containing much defaced fres-
coes by Bern. Buttinone and Bern. Zenale, and the monument of
Ambrogio Grifo (d. 1493) by C. Solari. The cloisters, with two
early—Renaissance courts, are now occupied by the Orfanotroﬁo, or
orphanage.

At the E. end of the Corso di Porta Vittoria, near the gate of that
name (Pl. H, 5; electric tramway, see p. 114), is a Emmi commemorat-
ing the Cinque Giornate (p. 116), designed by Gina. Grandi (d. 1894) and
unveiled in 1895.

We now return to the Corso Venezia. On the left, on this
side of the canal, is the Archicpiscopal Seminary (Pl. F, G, 4), by
Gius. Mode (1570), with a baroque portal and a ﬁne court. In the
Via del Senate, which diverges to the left by the Naviglio, is
(No. 10) the Palaszo del Senate (Pl. G, 3; formerly Pal. Eleetico),
built about 1600 by Fabio Mangonc, now containing the provincial
archives; in the court is a colossal equestrian statue of Napoleon III.
(bronze), by Barzaghi. Adjacent, at the beginning of the avenue
(Boschetti) leading to the Giardini Pubblici, is a marble statue of
