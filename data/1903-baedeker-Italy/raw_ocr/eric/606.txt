to Florence. , LUCCA. 67. Route. 419

A little to the N.W. stands the small church of San Giusto
(Pl. 0, D, 3), with a ﬁne portal of the 12th century. Near this
spot stood the palace of the Lombard dukes. —— The Romanesque
church of San Cristoforo (Pl. 7; D, 3), in the Via Fillungo, dates
from the 11-12th centuries. Pretty facade.

On the W. side of the Piazza Napoleone (p. 417) is situated the
Palaazo Provinciale (P1. 10; C, 3), formerly Pal. Ducalc, begun in
1578 by Bart. Ammanati on the site of a palace (destroyed in 1576)
of Castruccio land the Guinigi, continued in 1728 by Franc. Pint“
and Fat. Juvara with important deviations from the original plan,
and still unﬁnished. In the imposing inner court stands a monu-
ment, by Augusto Passaglia, to the jurist Franc. Cars-arc (1805-88).

In the archway leading to the second court is (left) the entrance
to the Preronn GALLERY (Pinacotcca), important on account of two
paintings (from San Romano) by Fra Bartolomeo and sculptures by

Matteo Civitali (open daily, 10-2, free; at other times 1 fr.; closed

on Mon., Easter Sun., and Christmas Day).

From the Vssrraou, which contains medieval sculptures, we ascend
the staircase to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

— ‘In this most admirable production for feeling as well as form, a special
attractiveness is created by colouring redolent of Venetian richness and
brilliancy, and b atmos’phere successfully attained in gradations of land-
scape-tints and y chiaroscuro after the method of Da Vinci in the Mona
Lisa, or of Raphael in the ortrait of Leo the Tenth‘ (0. J: 0.). —- Oppo-

the Moncalieri family, of 1515; also injured by restoration. —- The classic
movement of the principal ﬁgure, the varied but always elegant attitudes
and action of the remainder are almost matchless instances of the mode
in which scientiﬁc calculation gives nature as a result. In most of the
minutiae unusual power of observation is revealed. Nothing can be more
pleasing than the manner of dividing the ﬁngers with their play suggesting
unconsciousness. Admirable are the draperies in which the folds are con-
:entrated on the bends‘ (0. d- 0.). —- In this room also are: 1. Pompeo
Batoni, Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew; 3. Pietro Paolim’, Madonna en-
