Ferraro (30 ft.), the ancient Forum Aliem', situated 31/2 M. to
the S. of the P0, in a fertile plain, is the capital of a province, with
81, 301 inhab., and the seat of an archbishop and of a university.
It possesses broad streets, numerous palaces, and other reminiscen-
cos of its golden period, when it was a prosperous commercial place,
numbering 100,000 inhab., and the seat of the celebrated court

of the House of Beta.
The famil of Este was probably descended from the Carlovingian
governors of eutonic origin, and derived its feudal name from the castle
~ mentioned at p. 241. Area II. (d. 1097) became Count or Manonavn or
; Esra under Emp. Henry IV. His son Welf (founder of the younger branch
I of the Guelphs) was invested with the Duchy of Bavaria, and his son
Henry the Proud became the founder of the families of Brunswick and
Hanover. Folco (ca. 1097-1135), the eldest son of A220 was the ancestor
of the Italian house of Este. Obizzo II. (d. 1293), who established a
permanent dominion over Modena in 1288 and Reggio in 1289, considerably
extended the power of his house. Niccolo III. (d. 1441) summoned to his
court in 1424 the erudite Guan'no (1370-1460), who here laid the founda-
tion of a rosperous school of liberal learning. In 1452 Niccolo‘s son
Borso rece ved the title of Dunn: or Momma am) Rnooxo from Emyi.
Frederick III. and in 1470 that of Duns: or annana from Pope Paul I .
He died in 1411. His brother Hercules I. (1471-1606) and the son of the
latter, Alphonso I. (1515-34), whose second wife was t e infamous Lucrezia
Borgia, were powerful and inﬂuential princes. Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1033;
p. 800), the greatest Italian poet of the 16th cent., was in the service of
Alphonso from 1518. Though bloody feuds distracted the ruling family,
the city steadily grew in prosperity. Hercules II. (1684-58) son of Alphonso,
was the husband of Renata, daughter of Louis XII. of Prance, patroness
of the Reformers Calvin and Marot, to whom she accorded an asylum.
Having declared herself in favour of the reformed doctrines, she was
serrated from her husband and children. Her son Alphonso II. (1558-97)
ra ed the glory of Ferrara to its culminating point, but with him the
family became extinct, his three marriages being childless. He was the
patron of the poets Torso (1514-95) and Guariul (author of the ‘Pastor Fido‘;
born at Ferrara in 1537, died at Venice in 1612). Goethe in his ‘Torquato
Tasso‘ has drawn a faithful picture of the court of Ferrara about the year
15:75, although a somewhat ideal colouring is given to some of the characters.
His description of the attachment of Tasso to Eleonora (1537-81), the
youngest unmarried sister of the duke seems to have a poetical founda-
tion only. Am (1531—1607), one of the sisters, was married to the Due
do Guise, and afterwards to the Due de Nemours; Lucretia (1534.98), the
other sister was the wife of the Duke of Urbino. Alphonso II. was suc-
ceeded by (laws d’Esle, descendant of a natural son of Alphonso 1., but
