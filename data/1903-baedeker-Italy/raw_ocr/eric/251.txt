The church of San Giorgio a1 Palazzo (Pl. D, 6), farther on, to
the right, contains in the 1st chapel on the right a St. Jerome by
Gaud. Ferrari; in the 3rd chapel on the right, *Paintings by Luini:
above the altar, Entombment and Crowning with thorns; at the
sides, Scourging and Ecce Home; in the dome, Cruciﬁxion (fresco).
— Farther to the N.W., in the Piazza Mentana (Pl. D, 6), is a Moa-
umcnt by Luigi Betti, erected in 1880 in memory of the Italians who
fell at Montana.

To the S. the Via Torino is continued by the Conso m Penn TI-
cmnsn (Pl. D, 7, 8), in which, on the left, is a large ancient *Conon-
NADB (Pl. D, 7) of sixteen Corinthian columns, the most important
relic of the Roman Mediolanum. Adjacent is the entrance to —

*Ban Lorenzo (Pl. D, 7), the most ancient church in Milan.
Whether the handsome interior once formed the principal hall of
the Thermae, or of a palace of Maximian (4th cent. ), to which the
above-mentioned colonnade belonged, or a very ancient Christian
place of worship, like San Vitale at Ravenna, is uncertain. It was
subsequently altered at least three times, the last time by Martino
Bassi about 1573. It is octagonal in form, and covered with a
dome. On the four principal sides are large semicircular apses in
two stories, each borne by four columns alternately octagonal and
round. -

At the back of the hi hsaltar is the ancient Cappclla di Sant‘ Ippolito,
containing the tomb of ount Giov. Maria Visconti, by Marco Agra“
(1559). — To the right of the church is the very ancient Cappeua di Sant‘
Aquilino (closed), containing mosaics of the 6th and 7th cent. (Christ and
the Apostles and Annunciation to the Shepherds, the latter freely restored),
and an ancient Christian sarc0phagus. The entrance to the chapel from

the church is adorned with an antique marble frame, on which appears
a Bacchante riding a goat (to the left).

Farther to- the S., beyond the Naviglio, rises the ancient church
of Bant’ Eustorgio (Pl. D, 8), founded in the 4th cent., re-erected
in the Gothic style in 1278, renewed in the bad taste of the 17th
cent. by Ricchini, and recently again restored. The modern facade
is by Giov. Brocca (1862).

right, Gothic monument of Stefano Visconti (ca. 1337), by one of the
Campionesi; 6th Chapel, Monuments of Gaspare Visconti and his wife
Agnes (d. 1417). Farther on, on the same side, the Cappella de‘ Magi, con-
taining a. relief of 1847 and a late—Romanesque sarcophagus, in which the
‘bones of the Magi‘ were preserved until they were presented to the city
of Cologne by Frederick Barbarossa after the conquest of Milan in 1162.
By the high-altar are reliefs of the Passion, dating from the 14th century.
In a modern sarcophagus (1900) below are deposited the bones of Eustor-
gins, Magnus, and Honoratus, three archbishops of Milan in the 4th cen-
tury. -— At the back of the choir is the ‘Cappella Portinari, with a ﬁne
cupola and a charming frieze of angels, built in 1482-66 by Michalozzo of
Florence (p. 443). It contains the magniﬁcent Gothic tomb of St. Peter
Martyr by Gian. di Balduccio of Pisa (1339). This saint, the Dominican
Fra Pietro of Veron , was murdered in 1252 in the forest of Barlasaina.
