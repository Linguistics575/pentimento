The round *Campanile, or bell-tower, begun by the architects
Bonannus of Pisa and William of Innsbruck in 1174, and completed
in 1350, rises in eight diiierent stories, which, like the Baptistery,
are surrounded with half-columns and six colonnades. Owing to its
remarkable oblique position, 14 ft. out of the perpendicular (height
179 ft. ), it is usually known as the Leaning Tower. The question
whether this peculiarity was intentional or accidental has frequently
been discussed, but it is now pretty generally believed that the
foundations on the S. side sank in the course of building, and that
from the third story upwards an inclination in the Opposite
direction was given. Galileo availed himself of the oblique position
of the tower in making his experiments regarding the laws of gravi-
tation. The l"View from the platform is very beautiful, embracing
the town and environs, the sea, and the mouth of the Arno to the W.,
Leghorn to the S.W., the Apuan Alps to the N., and ‘the Monti
Pisani to the N.E. (best at sunset, with brilliant lights over the
Carrara Mts.). A good staircase of 294 steps leads to the top (adm.,

Gothic structure which surrounds the churchyard was began about
1270 from the plans of Giovanni Pisano, and consecrated in 1278.
but it was not ﬁnally completed till the 14th century. It is 138 yds.
in length, 57 yds. in width, and 48 ft. in height. Externally there
are 43 shallow arcades resting on pilasters, the capitals adorned
with ﬁgures. There are two entrances, over the earlier of which
(to the right) is a marble canopy, with a Madonna of the school of
Giovanni Pisano. In the interior the green quadrangle is surrounded
by a spacious cloister, with unglazed, round-arched windows ﬁlled

with beautiful tracery. Three chapels adjoin the cloister; the oldest .

is in the centre of the E. side, with dome of later date. The walls are
covered with *Frescoes by painters of the Tuscan school of the 14th
and 15th cent. (comp. p. 406), unfortunately in bad' preservation
and restored by Botti. Below these is a collection of Roman,_Etruscan.
and mediasval sculptures, these last being important links in the

history of early Italian sculpture. The tombstones of persons interred I

here form the pavement.
