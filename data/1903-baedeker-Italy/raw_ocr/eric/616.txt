statue of the sculptor (‘1’) — We now return and take the Via Pacini,

on the right, to the —

Oapadale del Ceppo (Pl. 0, 2), erected in 1277, but afterwards
rebuilt. “ On the vestibule is a long 'Frieze by Gian. delta Robbie
(1514. 25), consisting of reliefs in terracotta, beautifully coloured
and glazed, representing the seven works of mercy (the last relief
on the right, unglazed, was added in 1586 by Fit. Paladim'); be-

architrave of the entrance are sculptures of 1166, representing the
Adoration of the Magi, with the inscription: ‘Fecit hoc Opus Grua-

of the Innocents, Symbols of three of the Evangelists (the eagle, now
wanting, probably served as a Wooden lectern), Cruciﬁxion, three Prephets,

even as the models for Michael Angelo’s Sibyls) and in the spandrels twelve
prophets, the whole being borne by seven columns of red marble, a lion
