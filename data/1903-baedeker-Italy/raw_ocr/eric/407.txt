The Via Donatello leads to the W. from the Botanic Garden to

bieski, Gustavus Adolphus, Livy, in the outer row Tasso, Arioslo,

the time of the fair (ﬁe'ra), which begins on the festival of St. Anthony
(13th June) and lasts for three days. -— 0n the W. side of the
piazza is the Loggia Amulea (Pl. 0, 6), a modern Gothic structure,

June. Below are marble Statues of Dante and Giotto, by Vincenzo
Vela (1865). —

At the S.E. angle of the Piazza is *Banta Giustina (Pl. D, 7), a
Renaissance church of imposing proportions, begun by Girol. do
Brescia in 1501, continued by Al. Leopardi in 1521-22, and com-
pleted in 1532 by Morone of Bergamo. The unadorned brick facade
is approached by a handsome ﬂight of twelve steps. The interior
consists of nave and aisles, ﬂanked with rows of chapels; it is 364 ft-
long and 98 ft. wide, with a transept 250 ft. lorig. The aisles are
roofed with barrel-vaulting, the nave with three ﬂat domes. The
transept and choir terminate in semicircular recesses and are sur—
mounted by four lofty cupolas.

The church is paved with coloured marble. Behind the high-altar,
which contains the tomb of St. Justina (d. 303), is the ‘Martyrdom of St.
Justina, by Paolo Veronese. Beautifully carved ‘Choir Stalls from drawings
of Campagnola (1560), New Testament subjects above, and Old Testament,

accessible, being used for military purposes. ‘
