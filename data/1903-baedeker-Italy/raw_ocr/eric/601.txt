Lucca (62 ft), formerly the capital of the duchy of that name
and now of a province, and also the see of an archbishop, with
73,465 inhab., is an antiquated place situated in a fertile plain be-
tween the Monti Pisani and the Alpi Apuane, with well—preserved

fortiﬁcations of 1561-1650 and many interesting churches. ‘Lucca ~

l’industriosa' is noted for its silk-factories, a branch of industry in-
’ troduced from Sicily in the 14th cent, and also for its woollen goods
and oil. An aqueduct, built in 1823-32 by Lor. Nottolini and re-
calling with its 459 arches the aqueducts of the Roman Campagns,

supplies the city with good drinking-water from the Pisan mountains.

Lucca (Roman Luca) was founded at a very remote period. It
ﬁrst belonged to Etruria, afterwards to Liguria, and after its capture by
the Romans in 177 B. 0., it was garrisoned by a Roman colony and was
included in the province of Gallia Cisalpina. In B. C. 56 Julius Caesar,
who was then governor of Gaul , held a conference here with Pompey
and Grassus, with whom he had been associated since B. O. 60, in order“
discuss a plan for the administration of the Roman empire for the ensuint
five years. The splendour of Lucca at that period is still indicated by the
remains of a Roman Amphitheatre. After the fall of the Roman Empire.
Lucca belonged successively to the Goths, Lombards, and Franks, then
became a duchy, and in 1115, after the death of the Countess Matilda (pm,
a republic. The feuds of the Guelphs and Ghibellines impaired the strength
of the place so seriously that in 1314 it was compelled to succumb to

Uguccione delta Faggz’uola of Arezzo, the warlike governor of Pisa. Dante '

resided with his friend Uguccione at Lucca in 1314, and there became
enamoured of the youthful Gentucca (Purgatorio, xxiv. 43), but he does not
describe the inhabitants in very ﬂattering terms (Inferno, xxi. 4.1). After
the expulsion of Uguccione, Lucca fell in 1322 into the hands of the
powerful Castruccic Gastracani degle‘ Anteiminelli of Lucca, who was also
master of Pisa and Pistoj a. On 23rd Sept, 1325, he defeated the Flor-entices
at Altopascio, and in 1327 was nominated imperial governor in Pisa, with
the title of duke, by Emp. Lewis the Bavarian. On his death in 1398
the power of Lucca declined; its next master was Mastinc delta Scale; it
subsequently came into the possession of Florence and then (in 1843) of
Pisa, but in 1369 it purchased its freedom from Charles IV. for SQUID florins,
and with the exception of the rule of the native famil of the Guiaigi
(1395—1430), it remained independent till the invasion 0 the French in
1799. In 1805 Napoleon gave Lucca as a principality to his sister Elisa
Baciocche'; in 1814 it came into the possession of the dukes of Parma of
the house of Bourbon, who, on succeeding to the throne of Parma after
the death of Marie Louise, ceded it to Tuscany in 1847. -

In the Hrsroar or MEDIEVAL Anonrrnc'runn Lucca occupied an im-
portant position from the period of the Lombards onward. The oldest
churches have unfortunately preserved their early-medimval character very
' imperfectly, but their columns, like those of the early-Christian basilica:
of Rome, .are antique. The taste for buildin , probably stimulated by
rivalry Wlth Pisa, was again revived in the th cent, when the older
churches were altered and restored, doubtless in accordance with
models. — Towards the end of the 15th cent. Alamo Ofeﬂah' (1M):
