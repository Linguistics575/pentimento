524 Route 59. OASOINE. Environs

Gigolt (St. Francis receiving the stigmata). -— A staircase descends hence
to the Lowan Cannon, with the tombs of the Acciajoli. In the chapel
immediately in front of us are the mural monument of Niccolo AccisJoli
(d. 1366), founder of the church, by 0rcagna(?), and three Gothic monu-
mental slabs, the best of which is that of the youthful Lor. Acciajoli
(d. 1363). The side-chapel to the left of the entrance contains the Renais-
sance monument (restored in 1550) of Cardinal Angelo Acciajoli (d. 14%).
-— We then return through the main church and enter the Czorsrm, with
stained glass in the style of Giovanni do Udt'ne. -— To the ri tin the
Gamma House: Marietta Albertina“, Cruciﬁxion (fresco of 1 ); monu-
ment of the Carthusian Leonardo Buonafede by Franc. da Sangauo (1545).
— We next enter the Horus-ram Gasman, which also serves as a burial-
ground, and is surrounded by handsome cloisters. At the sides are 18 mostly
empty cells, which enclose the building like pinnacles. The projecting
Tnnmcns on the N. side commands a picturesque view of the hills of
Florence and Fiesole. '

(9.) Mom OLIvn'ro AND Bannoseuanno. About 1/3 M. beyond
the Ports San Frediano (Pl. B, 4; omnibus, p. 434) the ‘Via di
Monte Oliveto’ diverges to the left from the Empoli and Pisa road,
and reaches the (1/2 M.) entrance to the garden of the Badia di Ban
Bartolomeo di Monte Oliveto (270 ft.) founded in 1334 (key next
door, No. 10; fee 20—30 c.). A slight eminence here, planted with
cypresses, commands an admirable view, now somewhat interrupted
by trees. -— The monastery-buildings are now used as a military
hospital. The church, restored in the style of Michelozzo in 1472,
possesses frescoes by Poccetti. In the priest‘s house are the remains
of a fresco of the Last Supper by Sodoma.

From the Monte Oliveto the Via di Monte Oliveto leads to the
S., crossing a small square, to (1/2 M.) the Villa Bellosguardo,
near the entrance of which we obtain one of the ﬁnest *Views of
Florence. Adjacent is the Villa Zoubow, occupied by Galileo in
1617-31, and now marked by inscription and bust. We return to
the city from the above-mentioned square by the Via di Bello-
sguardo (to the E.), the Via di San Francesco di Paola (Pl. A, 5),
and the Barriers Petrarca.

(f. ) The Casci'ne, or park of Florence, lies to the W., beginning
at the Piazza degli Zuavi' (Pl. A, B, 1, 2), and is about 2 M. in
length, but of moderate breadth, being bounded by the Arno and
the Mugnone (p. 526). It affords delightful and refreshing walks
to the traveller fatigued with sight-seeing; in the more distant
parts it is covered with woods. The name is derived from a farm to
which it once belonged (cascina == dairy). In the proper season it
is a fashionable rendezvous in the late afternoon, particularly for
driving. — Outside the town, immediately to the left, is a small
Cafe' Restaurant. — About the middle of the Caseine is a large Open
space, the Piazzalc del Re (where a military band plays on Sun. and
festivals in summer), with the Casino delle Cascine, a frequented
cafe-restaurant. Beyond this spot the park is comparatively deserted,
and it terminates about 1 M. farther on at the monument of the
Rajah of Holapore, who died at Florence in 1870, and whose body
was burnt at this spot. Fine view of the W. environs of Florence,
