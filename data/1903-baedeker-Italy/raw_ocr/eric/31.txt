is apt to be raised. The charges for meals furnished in private rooms
or at unusual times are much higher. Other ‘extras’ are also dear.
The cuisine is a mixture of French and Italian. During the season
and at the more frequented resorts it is advisable to engage rooms
in advance, especially if arriving in the evening. It is advisable to
prepay the answer, to prevent disappointment on arrival. Gentlemen
travelling alone may leave their luggage at the station until rooms
have been secured. The charge for the use of the hotel-omnibus
from the station to the hotel is so high (1-11/2 fr. each), that it is
often cheaper to take a cab. It is also easier for those who use a cab to
proceed to another hotel, should they not like the rooms oﬁered them.

The Sncorvn CLASS Ho'rBLs (Alberghi; in the S. districts, also Lo-
cande) are less comfortable and thoroughly Italian in their arrange—
ments. The charges are little more than one—half of the above: room

native wines, usually on draught, are furnished in these houses at

convenient and economical by the voyageur en gar-con, and the better
houses of this class may even be visited by ladies, when at home in
Italian; the new-comer should frequent hotels of the ﬁrst class only.

The ‘Pnnsrons of the larger towns and resorts also receive passing
travellers. The charge is about the same as that of the second-class
inns and usually includes table-wine. As, however, the price of
