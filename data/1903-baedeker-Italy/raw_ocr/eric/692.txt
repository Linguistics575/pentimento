to Santa Maria Novella. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 501.

Opposite is the ‘Moxuxsnr or Lonsnzo or." Humor, who in contrast
to Giuliano is represented in profound meditation (hence called it pen-
sicro); below it his sarcophagus, which contains also the body of Duke
Alessandro, assassinated in 1537, with “Statues of Evening and Dawn
(Crepuscuto e Aurora). The original signiﬁcance which Michael Angelo
meant to convey before the siege of Florence by the allegorical ﬁgures
is somewhat obscure and artiﬁcial. The periods of the day represent as
it were the various members of the universe, which are sunk in grief at
the death of the heroes. The statues are not portraits, but ideal forms,
in which are reﬂected the two chief sides of a heroic nature, —- self-
devoted absorption in noble designs, and conﬁdent energy. It is certain
that sorrow at the fate of his country, scourged by pestilence and war,
which delayed the completion of the statues, exercised a great inﬂuence
on the master‘s chisel, though the theory that Michael Angelo was from
the beginning bent upon producing a purely political monument cannot
stand the test.

The remaining statues in the chapel, an unﬁnished Madonna, by
Michael Angelo, and the two patron saints of the Medici, 8t. Damianus (1.)
by Raﬁaello da Honielupo, and St. Cosmas (r.) b Fra Giovanni Anyiolo da.
Montorsoli (who also assisted Michael Angelo in 533 on the statue of Giu-
liano), were originally intended for the mausoleum of Lorenzo the Magni-
ﬁcent and his brother Giuliano. These two members of the Medici family
are buried beneath the ﬁgure of the Madonna, in cofﬁns renewed in 1895.

quent scene of festivals and games in former times. The Patio dci
Cocchi, the chief of these, instituted in the reign of Cosimo I. in
1563, took place on the eve of the festival of St. John, and consisted
of a race of four four-horse chariots. Two obelisks of marble of 1608,
standing on brazen tortoises, perhaps by Giov. da Bologna, served
