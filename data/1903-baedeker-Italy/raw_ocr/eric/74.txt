ITALIAN, ART. lxiii

certain address in the arrangement of ﬁgures, they preserve their
reputation as ingenious decorators, and understand the art of occa-
sionally imparting an ideal impress to their pictures; even down to
a late period in the 18th century they excel in effects of colour,
and by devoting attention to the province of genre and landscape-
painting they may boast of having extended the sphere of their
native art. At the same time they cannot conceal the fact that they
have lost all faith in the ancient ideals, that they are incapable of
new and earnest tasks. They breathe a close, academic atmosphere,
they no longer labour like their predecessors in an independent
and healthy sphere, and their productions are therefore devoid of
absorbing and permanent interest.

This slight outline of the decline of Italian art brings us to_
the close of our brief and imperfect historical sketch, which, be
it again observed, is designed merely to guide the eye of the
enlightened traveller, and to aid the uninitiated in independent
discrimination and research.
