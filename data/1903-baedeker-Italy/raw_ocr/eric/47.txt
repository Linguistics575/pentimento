xxx vi ITALIAN ART.

signiﬁcant passages; the apse loses its intimate connection with
the nave, being separated from it; the most conspicuous feature
in the building consists of the central square space , bounded
by four massive pillars which support the dome. These are the
essential characteristics of the Byzantine style, which culminates
in the magniﬁcent church of St. Sophia at Constantinople, and pre-
vails throughout Oriental Christendom, but in the West, including
Italy only, occurs sporadically. With the exception of the churches
of San Vitale at Ravenna, and St. Mark at Venice, the ediﬁces of
Lower Italy alone show a frequent application of this style.
The Byzantine imagination does not appear to have exercised a
Gnow'rn greater inﬂuence on the growth of other branches of Italian
or Ana- rs art than on architecture. A brisk trafﬁc in works of art
”A“; was carried on by Venice, Amalﬁ, and other Italian towns,
with the Levant; the position of Constantinople resembled that of
the modern Lyons; silk wares, tapestry, and jewellery were most
highly valued when imported from the Eastern metropolis. By-
zantine artists were always welcome visitors to Italy , Italian con-
noisseurs ordered works to be executed at Constantinople, chieﬂy
those in metal, and the superiority of Byzantine workmanship
was universally acknowledged. All this, however, does not justify
the inference that Italian art was quite subordinate to Byzantine.
0n the contrary, notwithstanding various external inﬂuences , it
underwent an independent and unbiassed development, and never
entirely abandoned its ancient principles. A considerable interval
indeed elapsed before the fusion of the original inhabitants with
the early medizeval immigrants was complete, before the aggregate
of different tribes, languages, customs, and ideas became blended
into a single nationality, and before the people attained sufﬁcient
concentration and independence of spirit to devote themselves
successfully to the cultivation of art. Unproductive in the pro—
.vince of art as this early period is, yet an entire departure from
native tradition, or a serious conﬂict of the latter with extraneous
innovation never took place. It may be' admitted, that in the
massive columns and cumbrous capitals of the churches of Upper
Italy, and in the art of vaulting which was developed here at an
early period , symptoms of the Germanic character of the inhabit-
ants are- manifested, and that in the Lower Italian and especially
Sicilian structures, traces of Arabian and Norman inﬂuence are
unmistakable. In the essentials, however, the foreigners continue
:to be the recipients; the might of ancient tradition and the
.national idea of form might be repressed but they could not be
obliterated. _
About the middle of the 11th century a zealous and promis-
Rouax- ing artistic movement took place in Italy, and the seeds
guns were sown which three or four centuries later yielded so
ﬂu" luxuriant a growth. As yet nothing was matured, nothing
