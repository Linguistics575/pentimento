A few paces to the S. of the main street, in the Piazza San
Prospero, is the church of SAN Pnosrnno (P1. 0, 3), re-erected in
1504 by Gasparo Bisi on the site of an earlier Romanesque ediﬁce,

naissance facade, completed only in the lower part, in which in—
teresting traces of the earlier Romanesque church of the 12th cent.

ing hence to the W. by the Via San Pietro Martire, we reach the

from a design by Balbi, in the form of a Greek cross covered with
a dome. It was ﬁnished after Balbi’s death by Franc. Pacchioni,

and was restored in 1890 (closed 12.30-4).

for its charming decorations in stucco. It is adorned with frescoes in the
nave as far as the dome and in the left transept by Luca Ferrari (1605-54)

markably ﬁne ediﬁce for so small a town. — The Museum (Pl. 0, 2)
