98 Route 18. NERVI. From Genoa

promontory of Portoﬁno, while it lies fully exposed to the S.E. wind.
Its mean winter temperature (52" Fahr.) is almost the same as that 01
the W. Riviera, but the rainfall at Net-vi is more cepious and the periods
of dry weather less prolonged. The relative moisture of the three winte:
months is 63 per cent.

Nervi, a small town with 6317 inhab., surrounded with grove:
of olives, oranges, and lemons, is much frequented in winter b]
English and Germans, as a health-resort. The Viale Vittorit
Emanuele, with its ﬁne palms, leads to the N. frOm the railway-
station to the (3 min.) town, which is intersected from W. to E. b:
the highroad, here called Via Cavour (to the W.) and Via del Pow
(to the E.). In the Via Cavour are the Giardino Pubblico (left) am
the Villa Croce (N o. 113 ; right); in the Via del Pozzo are the beauti'
i'ul Park of the Marchese Grapallo (entrance No. 55, fee 1/2 fr. 5 some
times closed), with an old watch-tower on the Coast Promenade
and the Villa Serra. All these are noteworthy for their luxurian
vegetation (orange-trees, aloes, palms, etc.).

A feature of the place is the dust-free and sunny l“Coast Prom-
enade, which runs along the shore above the rocky beach, and i:
protected by a lofty wall on the landward side. Pleasantly placec‘
benches on the promenade and in the adjoining gardens aﬂ'ord rest-
ing-places for patients who wish to be much in the open air without
taking active exercise.

The Via Belvedere, beginning at the Piazza Belvedere, about the middle
of the main street, ascends in curves to (3/4 hr.) the church of Sant‘ Iiario
halfway up the Monte Giugo (1594 ft). 0n the way, and from beside tht
church, we obtain admirable views as far as Portoﬁno on the E. and o
the Riviera di Ponente and the Ligurian Alps on the W. The t’ootpau
(short-cut) may be‘ chosen for the descent; or we may follow the bill it
the W. and descend via the Cappella San Rocco (655 ft.) to the Giardim
Pubblico. -— A rough footpath, beginning at the W. end of the town
ascends the Nerm' Valley to (3/4 hr.) some mills. — The ascent of Mont
Fasce (2730 ft.; 21/2 hrs.) is also worth making.

The numerous tunnels that now follow sadly interfere with th
enjoyment of the view. — 9 M. Bogliasco; 91/2 M. Piece di Son
101/2 M. Sort (65 ft.) is beautifully situated at the mouth of'
pretty valley, up which a road runs to (13/4 M.) Canepa. We enjo
a noble survey of sea and valley from the viaduct which passe
high above the town and rivulet.

The ”Roaornou Baooo 'ro Baeanno ascends the mountain-slepe t
the S.E., with a view, to the right, of Camogli (p. 99) and the pop
ulous coast. then skirts Monte Esoh‘ (see p. 99), and reaches (21/21) But
(930 ft,; 36:. d‘Itah‘e, ens. 6 fix), a villa e commanding a magniﬁcer
retrospect of the Gulf o Genoa. The road t on traverses a tunnel (80de
long; curious view) and descends in wide bends via San Lorenzo delta Cost
(Flemish altar-piece of 1499 in the church) and through the fertile hill
above Santa Margherita ( . 99) to the beautiful bay of (7 M.) Rapauo (p. 1001

The ascent of the ' onte di Portoﬁno (2010 ft.; guide not necessary
provisions required) is attractive. A good footpath, commanding ﬁne view
of both the Rivieras, gradually ascends from Buta in 1% hr. to a ﬁngel
post on the top of the N. ridge, where we follow the middle path to th
(1/: hr.) summit, with a former signal-station and a magniﬁcent curve
