Venetian pictures Giovanni Bellini’s Madonna by the lake (631;
p. 467), Titian’sFlora (626; p. 467), two works by Giorgione (621,
630; p. 468), and a number of portraits.

The collection is also rich in works of northern origin, the
better-Of which, in spite of the proximity of the more studied
Italian pictures, maintain their peculiar charm, owing to their
depth of colouring and their uns0phisticated realism. Among the
works Of the EARLY FLEMIBH SCHOOL, an Adoration Of the Child,
the chief work Of the rare master Hugo van der Goes (48-50; 1). 461),
and a small Madonna by Memling (703; p. 466) are specially at-
tractive. Among the principal GERMAN masters, Dita-er, whose works
were highly prized in Italy and much followed by Italian painters
even before his death, is represented by an Adoration of the Magi
(in the Tribune, .p. 463), a portrait of his father (766; p. 466), two
heads Of Apostles (768, 777; p. 466), and an unattractive Madonna

851; p. 466). *Holbein’s portrait of Richard Southwell, dating from

537 (765; p. 465), is an admirable work. The Nnrnnmnns
Sonoons of the 17th cent. are also represented by several excellent
works. Among those by Rubens are the portrait of his ﬁrst wife
(in the Tribune; p. 462), a small sketch of“ the‘Graces (842; p. 465).
his own portrait (228; p. 459), and two pictures of scenes from the
life of Henri IV( 40, 147; p. 469). The best of Rembrandt’s works
preserved here are the two portraits of himself (451, 452; p. 459).
The Dutch genre+painters (p. 465) have also enriched the gallery
with several important and well-preserved works, such as Ger.
Dou’s Cake-woman (926), G. Metsu’s Lute-player (918) and the
Huntsman (972), and Jan Steen’s Family feast (977). Among the
portraits of the painters (see below) those by the Netherlands
masters also occupy a high rank.
