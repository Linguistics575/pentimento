Tuscany which covers an area of 9%7 sq. M. and contains 2,228,200
.nhab., is divided into eight provinces of very did’erent sizes; viz. Nassa-
L‘arrara, 687 sq. M. in area, lon an independent duchy and afterwards
inited with Modena down to 185 ; Lucca, 575 sq. M. in area, also long
ndependent, but incorporated with the duchy of Parma from 1814 to 1847;
Florence the largest province, 2267 sq. M. in area; Leghorn, the smallest,
thout 156 sq. M. in area; and Pisa, Arena, Siena, and Grosseto. The
lensity of the population, too, varies greatly in diii‘erent parts of the
pantry. In the province of Lucca there are about 431 inhab. to the square
nile, in Florence 295, in Siena 127, and in Grosseto not more than 57.
With the exception ofthe coast-districts and the valleys, the country is
Lilly, and intersected by the spurs and ramiﬁcations of the Bub-Apenntnes.
the N. part, adjoining the Arno, is most fertile, the plains and slopes of
he hills being richly cultivated. A strong contrast to this smiling region
3 presented by the marshy coast district below Leghorn, where malarial
evers have wielded their destructive sway since the depOpulation which

voor, but some compensation is afforded for this by its copper and other
nines. Tuscany, indeed, possesses greater mineral wealth than any other
tart of Italy, and to this circumstance is due the fact that it was earlier
:ivilised than the rest of the peninsula.

Tuscany still retains the name of its ﬁrst inhabitants, the Tarot or
E'trusci (Greek Tyrrhenians). The excellent iron of Elba and the rich
:Opper mines of Volterra afforded them materials for establishing thriv-
ng industries, the products of which were in demand far and wide at an
