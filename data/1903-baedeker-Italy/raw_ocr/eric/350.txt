Lego di Garda. DESENZANO. 36. Route. 211

fectly calm, and in ﬁne weather is often considerably agitated about
midday by a local wind from the S. (Ora; cold in winter). In a
storm from the N. the lake is sometimes almost as roughi’as the sea,
as recorded by Virgil (Georg. ii. 160). The water is generally of an
azure blue.

The Vnen'rs'rron is very luxuriant, especially on the more sheltered
stretches of the coast, near Garda and on the Riviera. Even the sensitive
lemon (Hmone) arrives at maturity on the Riviera. and near Limone, but
in winter the trees require to be carefully enclosed by wooden shelters
(serve). This is done with the aid of numerous white brick pillars, which
gleam picturesquely amid the soft green foliage. In consequence of the
disease known as ‘gumming‘ the annual yield of lemons has fallen from
10-16 millions (1862) to about 3 millions. Citrons (citrus medica) also are
extensively cultivated on the Riviera. Caper-shrubs (cappars‘s spinosa) ﬂourish
in the chinks of old walls. The tall laurel trees (laum name's), which
shade most of the roads, are characteristic of the Riviera. Groves of olives,
as in the Sarca valley, stretch up the hill-slepes to a. height of 980 ft;
but the trees suﬂ‘er a good deal from ‘scale‘ (fungus), which renders it
necessary to hollow out the trunks artiﬁcially.

The trota, or trout, which attains 25 lbs., the carpione, or salmon-trout,
the anym’lla, or eel, and the luccs'o, or pike, are excellent ﬁsh.

called Grotto ds' Camila, the considerable relics of a Roman building ex-
tending into the lake, said to have been the country-house of Catullus,
who wrote his poems here (‘peninsularum, Sirmio, insularumque ocelle’).
Tennyson celebrates ‘olive silvery‘ Sirmio and its connection with Catullus
in one of the most musical of his short poems. — The Sergeants, a warm
