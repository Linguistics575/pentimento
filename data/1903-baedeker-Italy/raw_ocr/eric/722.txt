restored in 1541. The great terrace affOrds a splendid ‘Panorama of the
surrounding mountains, with distant views of Fiesole and Florence, seen

monastery of San Salvi, founded before 1084, where in 1312 Emp.
Henry VI]. established his headquarters during the siege of Florence,
only the remains are now extant. The district adjoining the Campo

see p. 438) contains a collection of old paintings belonging to the
Florentine galleries and a *Fresco by Andrea dot Sarto (1526-27),
representing the Last Supper.

The painting ‘is calculated to be seen at a burst on entering the door.
, , . It is marvellous how the shadows cast by the ﬁgures, and the parts
in them turned away from the light, keep their value; how the varie-
gated tints preserve their harmony‘. — C. d‘ C.
