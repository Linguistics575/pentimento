More elaborate and studied, and in every sense grandiose, the ‘Ma-
donna di Cass Pesero‘ reveals more surely than the ‘Annunciation‘ (Scuola
di 8. Rocco, p. 818) the breadth of Titian‘s talent, and takes us, not
without preparation, to the height of his pictorial fame. He has brought
to perfection the last and ﬁnest of all forms of presentation pictures, the
noblest combination of the homely and devotional with palatial archi-
tecture -— the most splendid and solemn union of the laws of composition
