‘ Archaeological Museum.

Leaving the Piazza del Dudmo (p. 460) by the VIA 133’ Sun
(Pl. F, G, 4), we pass the Palazao Fiaschi (No. 10) on the right (ﬁne
windows on the groundﬂoor) and the Palazzo Buturlin (Pl. G, 4;
formerly Pal. Niccolini) on the left (No. 16), with its handsome
court and modern painting. The former was erected by B. Ammanati,
the latter by Domenico, son of Baccio d’Agnolo. We then reach
the Piazza dell’ Annunziata.

The large block of buildings in the adjacent Via de’ Pucci is
the Palazzo Pucci (Pl. F, 4), dating from the 16th cent. , but partly
rebuilt in the 16th and 17th by Bart. Ammanati and Falconleri‘.

. In the Via degli Alfani, to the right, a little short of the piazn,
rises the former Camaldulensian convent of SANTA MARIA nnom
ANGIoLI (Pl. G, 4), founded in 1295, with an unfinished octagonal
Oratory with niches, by anellcschi. -— Opposite (No. 50) is the
Palazzo Giugni, built by Ammanati in 1560, with a ﬁne court.

At the left corner of the PrAzzA DELL’ ANNUNZIATA. (Pl. G, 3, 4)
is (No. 1) the Palazzo Riccardi-Mannclli, a brick ediﬁce with orna-
mentation in stone of Fiesole, erected by Bern. Buontalenti in1565.
The piazza is embellished with two baroque fountains by Pietro
Tacca (1629), and the Equestrian Statue of the Grand-Dulce Fer-
dinand I ., by Giovanni da Bologna (his last, but not his best work),
erected in 1608, and cast of metal captured from the Turks. The
pedestal was adorned in 1640, in the reign of Ferdinand II.

On the S.E. side of the piazza rises the *Spedale dogli Inno-
centi, or Foundling Hospital (Pl. G, 4), the initial work of Be-
naissance architecture, begun in 1419 by Brunelleschi, continued
by his pupil Francesco della Luna, and completed in 1451, at the
expense of the Guild of Silk Workers. The medallions with charm-

the church of SANTA MARIA DEGLI Innoonnrr, is a good Annun-
ciation by Andrea delta Robbia. The interior contains an altar-piece
(covered), the I"Adoration of the Magi, by Domenico Ghirlandajo
(1488), and a relief of the Madonna by Law della Robbie. 0n the
right side of the court is the entrance to a small picture-gallery
(Piero di Cosimo, etc.). — Opposite the Spedale is the hall of the
Sec-oi di Santa Maria brotherhood, erected by Antonio do Sangallo
the Elder and Baccio d’Agnolo (1518).

The church of the *Santissima Annunziata (P1. G, H, 3), on
