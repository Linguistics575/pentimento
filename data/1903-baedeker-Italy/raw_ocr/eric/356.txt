the tower; fee). Goethe was arrested here in 1786 when sketching
by the Venetian ofﬁcials (see his ‘Italienische Reise’). The parish-
church contains a Descent from the Cross by Girolamo dai Libri, a
richly coloured masterpiece (ist altar on the right). Beautiful road
hence to (16 M.) Garda (see below). _

Trimclone. The next stations are Asscnza, Magugnano, Castcllctto
diBmtzone (P; Alb. del Sole), and Torr-i dcl Benaco (P; Alb. Cal-
rinardi), with an imposing ruined castle and large quarries of yellow
marble. The stretch between Terri and Gerda is the most beautiful
part of the E. bank. The banks become ﬂatter. The promontory of
'San Vigilio (osteria) with the neglected Villa Brenzoni, 21/4 M. to
the W. of Garda, extends far into the lake. In the beautiful Bay
of Gerda, sheltered from the N. by Monte Baldo, lie the villas of
Marchese Oarlotti and Count Albertini of Verona, both with ﬁne
parks, with pine-trees. The picturesque old town of Gerda (P;
Hot. Gerda; H6t.-Pem. Sam Vigilio), at the inﬂux of the Tcsino,
which descends from Monte Baldo, gives the lake its name.

. About 21/4 M. to the S.E. is the Rocca ds' Garda (984 11.; view), with a
mined castle. U on the wooded heights opposite are the hermitages of
San!“ Eremo 101 ft.). -— From Garcia to the Monte Baldo and Verona,

fruit-trees. We enjoy a tine view of the lake-expanse, with Cape
Manerba and Sirmione in the distance. The next places are Bar-
dolino (P; Alb. Bardoling) and Lazisc (P),with a picturesque old castle.
