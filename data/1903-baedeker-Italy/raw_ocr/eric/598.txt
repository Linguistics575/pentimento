In and near the LUNGABNO are several other interesting build-
ngs, with which we may terminate our walk.

San Niccolo. (Pl. 0, 4), founded about the year 1000 by Count
Iugo of Tuscia as a Benedictine abbey, has an obliquely placed
lampam'lc, which contains an admirable winding staircase ascribed
3 Niccolo Pisano. — The Piazza in front of the church is adorned
rith a Statue ofFerdinand I., by a pupil of Giov. da Bologna (1595).

In the Lungarno Regio (p. 406) is the Palazzo Lanfreducci (Pl. (5;
, D, 4), now Uppezinghi, designed by Cosimo Pagliani, with the
'agment of a chain over the entrance, with the motto ‘alla giornata’.
— A little to the E., just before the Ponte di Mezzo, rises the
Palazzo Agostini, a ﬁne Gothic brick ediﬁce of the 15th century.

At the N. end of the Ponte di Mezzo is the Piazza Garibaldi
'l. D, E, 4), with an excellent bronze Statue of Garibaldi, by
a. Ferrari (1892; good reliefs on the pedestal). — In the busy
3. del Borgo, a few yards to the N. of the bridge, rises —

San Michele in Borgo (Pl. E, 4), a ﬂat-roofed basilica, prob-
[y of the 11th cent., with an old crypt. The facade, which is said
have been designed by Niccolo Pisano (but more probably by his
pil Fra Guglielmo), was partly rebuilt in the Gothic style.

The mosaic ﬂooring in San Picrino (Pl. E, 4), near the Piazza
iroli, is of early-Christian origin, and some of the columns are
.ique. —— The narrow Via. delle Belle Ton-i, leading to the E. from

Piazza Cairoli, still preserves a distinctly mediasval impress.
