banks of the Arno is the Ponte allc Grazia (Pl. E, F, 8, 7; p. 519),
or Rubaconte, constructed in 1237, modernized and widened in
1874. The Panic Vecchio (Pl. D, E, 6; p. 510), which is said to
have existed as early as the Roman period, and was ﬁnally rebuilt,
after its repeated demolition, by Taddeo Gaddi in 1345, consists of
three arches. The Panic Santa Trinita (Pl. D, 5; p. 503) was
originally erected in 1252, and rebuilt in 1567—70 by Bartolomeo
Ammanati. The Panic alla Carraja (Pl. 0, 4; p. 507), originally built
in 1218-20, destroyed together with the Ponte Vecchio by an in-
undation in 1333, and restored in 1337, was partly rebuilt in 1559
by Ammanati and restored and widened in 1867. Besides these, there
is an Iron Bridge at each end of the town (tell 5 c., carriages 42 c.).
