74 Route 16. ,GENOA. 6. From the Harbour

Sanchez Coello (1st chapel to the left of the choir), and three paintings by
Luca Cambiaso. Adjoining it on the left is the charming little church
of San Torpete, by Ant. Rocca (1631). A few yards to the S.W. of the
latter is the Piazza Cananno, named aﬁer the Palazso Cattaneo, which
has a tasteful Renaissance portal by Tamagnini and others. The Via
delle Gracie and then the Vice di San Cosmo (to the left) lead hence to
the Romanesque church of Scott Cosmo s Danu’ano, which contains a Madonna
of the 14th cent. (left of the high-altar). — Continuing to ascend beyond
San Cosmo, we reach the church of Santa Maria di Oastello (Pl. D, 6),
a Romanesque building (perhaps of the 11th cent), on the site of the
Roman castle. Above the portal is an ancient architrave; ten of the shafts
of the columns in the interior are also ancient. In the ﬁrst chapel on the
left is a Roman sarcophagus, used as an altar; in the second chapel on
the right is a Coronation of the Virgin by Lod. Brett,- and the third has
tasteful mural decorations (tiles) and an altar-piece by Saccht' (1526). The
choir was added in the 15th century. In the cloisters are ceiling-frescoes
of Sibyls and PrOphets and a Madonna by Justus do Allamagna (1451 5 under
glass). —- We now descend to the E. to San Donate (Pl. E, 6), a Romanesque
structure of the 12th cent. (restored in 1900), containing some ancient
columns. The architrave and columns of the entrance show an archaistic
tendency like those of the cathedral. In the interior are some antique
columns and (1st altar on the left) a ﬁne Adoration of the Magi, by the
Master of the Death of the Virgin (covered). -—- We may proceed hence
either via the Salita Pollajuoli to the NE. to the Piazza Umberto Primo
(p. 76) or via the Vico del Fico to the E. to the Piano di Sant‘ Andrea,
and thence pass under the Gothic Porto Soprano and descend the Vice
Dritto di Ponticello to the Via Venti Settembre (p. '76). No. 37, on the
left side of the Vice Dritto di Ponticello, is the small Ancestral House of
Columbus (Pl. E, 6; p. 81).

b. From the Harbour through the Via San Lorenzo to the Piazza
Umberto Prime and the Piazza Deferrari.

Near the beginning of the Via Vitt. Emanuele (p. 72) is the
busy VIA SAN Lonnrtzo, running towards the S.E. It contains the
cathedral of -—-

*San Lorenzo (Pl. E, 5, 6), founded in 985, re-erected about 1100
in the Romanesque style, restored in the Gothic style in 1307, and
provided with a Renaissance dome by Galeazzo Alessi in 1567. The
choir was modernized in 1617, and a harmonious restoration of the
interior was carried out since 1896. The lower part of the facade,
which consists of alternate courses of black and white marble, was con-
structed in imitation of the French Gothic churches; the two lower
of the recumbent lions which adorn it on the right and left of the
steps are modern. Only one of the towers is completed. The sculp-
tures of the principal portal date from the end of the 13th century.
The Romanesque entrances to the aisles are richly decorated with
sculptures of the 12-14th cent. (on the N. portal, 3. carver’s inscrip-
tion of 1342) and with archaistic ornamentation on the entablature
and capitals. A small Gothic oriel of 1402, formerly belonging to

the Hospital of St. John, has been built into the right aisle.

The INTERIOR, to which the massive substructure of the towers forms
a kind of atrium, still retains 16 Corinthian columns from the original
Romanesque building. The upper series of columns alternating with piers,
and also the whole of the vaulting, belong to the building of 1301. On
