the rent in advance is a customary stipulation; but such payments
should never be made until after the landlord has redeemed all his
undertakings with regard to repairs, furnishing, etc. For single
travellers a verbal agreement with regard to attendance, linen, stoves
and carpets in winter, a receptacle for coal, and other details will
generally suffice. Comp. p. xxx.

The popular idea of cleanliness in Italy is behind the age; but
the traveller in the N. part of the country will rarely suffer from this
short-coming even in hotels of the second class, though those who
quit the beaten track must be prepared for privations. Iron bedsteads
should if possible be selected, as they are less likely to harbour the
enemies of repose. Insect—powder (polvere insetticida or contro gli
imam) or camphor somewhat repels their advances.

The zanzr‘irs, or mosquitoes, are a source of great annoyance, and often
of suﬂering, during summer and autumn and, on the Riviera, even. in
winter. Only a few parts of N. Italy (eg. Piedmont, the W. lakes, and
BoIOgna) are free from this pest, which is always worst in the neigh'
hourhood of plantations, canals, or ponds. Between June and October the
night should never be spent in malarial districts (Colico, Mortars, Pavia.
lantua, Ferrara, Ravenna), where the female of the Anopheles Glaos'ger
frequently conveys the infection of malarial fever with its sting. Small
doses of quinine may be used as a prophylactic. Windows should always
be carefully closed before a light is introduced into the room. Light muslin
curtains (tamer-fort) round the beds masks for the face, and oves are
employed to ward off the attacks of these pertinacious intru era. The
burning of pastilles (ﬂdibus contra ls suntan; in Venice, chiods'), which may
he purchased of the principal chemists, is efﬁcacious, but is accompanied
by a scarcely agreeable odour. A weak solution of carbolie acid in water
is efﬁcacious in allaying the discomerts occasioned by the bites.

A list of the Italian names of the ordinary articles of underclothing
(la Manchu-fa) will be useful in dealing with the washerwoman: Shirt
(linen, cotton, woollen), la camicfa (ds' tela, ds' cotonc, ds' land); night-shirt,
to camicfa da nous; collar, t‘l solino, it colleuo; end, it polsfno; drawers,
ls mutande; woollen under-shirt, una ﬂanslla or gfubba di ﬂanslla or maglia;
petticoat, la sottaua; stocking, la calza; sock, la calzctta; handkerchief
(silk), r'l fazoleuo (di seta). To give out to wash, dare a bucato (df bucato,
newly washed); washing list, la nota; washerwoman, laundress. la stim-
lrics, Ia laoandaja; buttons, s' bottom‘.

X. Restaurants. Cafes. Birrerie.

Restaurants (Ristoranti, Traitor-is) are frequented between 11 am.
and 2pm. for luncheon (collaaionc) and between 6 and 8 p.m. for
dinner (promo). Meals are usually served aua carta at moderate
prices; meals a promo ﬁsso (2—5 fr.) are not customary except in a
few restaurants largely frequented by foreigners and are, in general,
not recommended. When there is no bill of fare the waiter (camcricre)
will recite the list of dishes. If too importuuate in his recom-
mendations or suggestions he may be checked with the word ‘basta’.
The diner calls for his bill ( which should be carefully scrutinized)
with the words ‘il conto’. The waiter expects, a gratuity of about
be. for each franc of the bill (comp. p. xv). — Residents for some
time in a town should arrange to pay a fortnightly or monthly sub-
scription (‘psmions‘J at a lower rate. * ‘ ' ‘
