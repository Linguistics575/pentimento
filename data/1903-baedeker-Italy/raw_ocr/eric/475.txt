C'ampam; last altar, Martyrdom of St. Lucia by Leandra Banana; mon-
ument of the Dogs Harcantonio Memmo (d. 1615).

An easy ascent on 32 inclined planes leads from the choir to
the summit of the Campanile (before ascending, enquire whether
the door at the top is open), which commands perhaps the best
*Vrnw of the city and the Lagune. — The Dominican monastery,
to which the church belonged, is now an artillery barrack and arsenal.

The adjoining island of Giudecca (steamboat, see p. 261; return-
ing in about half-an—hour on the way back) is separated from the
mainland by the Giudecca Canal, which is 1 M. long and nearly
1/4 M. wide at its widest part.

On this island stands the formerly Franciscan church of the —

II‘Bedentt'n'e (St. Saciour’s; Pl. F, 8), begun in 1577 by Palladio
but not ﬁnished until 1592, a much vaunted ediﬁce, chieﬂy in-
teresting in the interior.

ing, Tintoretto. On run Lars: 2nd, Resurrection, F. Banana,- 1st, Ascen-

' 0n the Festa del Redemore (third Sun. in July) at bridge-of-boats is formed
across the Giudecca to this church and a water-festival is held all night long.

Visitors who have not yet seen the church of San Sebastiano
(p. 314) may here take one of the steamboats mentioned at p. 262
to the Fondamenta delle Zattere.

h. Excursions.

1. A visit to the Lido, which is specially animated during the
bathing-season, is the favourite excursion from Venice. Steamboat,
see p. 262; the last steamboat leaves the Lido in winter a little be-
fore sunset (previous enquiries advisable). A gondola takes at least
1/2 hr. (two gondoliers desirable at all times and necessary in wind).

From Santa Maria Elisabetta, the landing-place (hotel-restau-
rants, Pl. 2, 3, 4, see p. 262), a road (tramway) runs across the island
in 8 min. to the Bathing Establishment (p. 262) and the Gr. Hot. des
Bains (Pl. 1; p. 262). The sea-baths at the establishment are fre-
quented by Italians in summer, but in spring and autumn almost
exclusively by foreigners. A pleasant walk along the beach may be
taken to the S.W., past the Ospiaio Marino and the dismantled Forte
Quattro Fontane, to (11/4 hr.) Malamocco (p. 321). — The N. end
of the Lido (also connected with Venice by steamer; line No. 5,
p. 262), is defended by the Forte San Niccolo and (to the W., beyond
the Porto di Lido, p. 270) the former Forte Sant’ Andrea di Lido,
erected in 1644 by Sanmicheli, as architect of the Republic. Within
the fort of S. Niccolo is the Old Protestant Cemetery, with the grave
