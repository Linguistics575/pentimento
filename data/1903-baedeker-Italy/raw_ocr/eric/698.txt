The Lungarno Corsini ends at the PIAZZA mar. Port'rn ALLA
CAnnAJA (Pl. 0, D, 4), whence the bridge mentioned at p. 445
spans the Arno, and the Via de’ Fossi, with its numerous shops,
branches oﬂ’ on the N.E. to the Piazza Santa Maria Novella (p. 501 .
Opposite the bridge is a marble statue of Goldoni, the post (1873

by Ulisse Cambi (1873).

The continuation of the Lungarno is known as the LUNGABNO
Annnreo Vnsruoor after Amerigo Vespucci (1451-1512; see below),
; the navigator, a native of this neighbourhood who gave his name
' to America. — Near the beginning of the Lungarno Amerigo Vespucci
expands the PIAzzA MANIN (P1. C, 4), bounded on the N .E. by the
Borgo Ognissanti, which runs parallel with the Lungamo, with a
bronze Statue of Daniele Martin (p. 267) by Urbano None (1890).

The suppressed Minorite monastery of Oynissanti (now barracks)
on the E. side of the piazza was occupied from 1256 by members
of the Lombard order of Humiliati, who did much to improve the
woollen-manufacture. Beside it is the church of Ban Salvadore
d’Ognissanti (P1. C, 3), erected in 1554, remodelled in 1627, the
facade by Matteo Nigetti (restored in 1882), with lunette by Giov.

delta Robbie, representing the Coronation of Mary.

cordia, two frescoes by Dom. Ghirlandajo (1480), with several portraits of
the Vespucci family. On the wall to the left are the arms of the family,
and on a slab in the pavement in front is the inscription: ‘Amerigo
Vespnccio posteris suis 1471‘. Between the 3rd and 4th altars are frescoes
on both sides: on the right St. Augustine, by S. Botticelli, on the left,

’

St. Jerome, by Domenico Ghirlandajo. A chapel in the left transept, ap-‘

proached by steps, contains a cruciﬁx by Giotto. Opposite is the entrance to
the sacristy, which contains a fresco of the Cruciﬂed, with angels, monks,
and saints, of the school of Giotto. — Adjacent is the entrance to the

old San Giovanni, Ligozzi, and others. — The old Rnracronr (adm., see p. 437),
