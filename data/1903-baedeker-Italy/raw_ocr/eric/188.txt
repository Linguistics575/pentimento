to Veuenigua. SAN REMO. 17. Route. 89

The train crosses'the broad and stony bed of the Impero, which
the road crosses to the ‘left by a suspension-bridge. — 70 M. Porto
Maurizio (Hotel de France, at the station; Commercio, in the town),
with 7 207 inhab. and a good harbour, is most picturesquely situated
on a promontory amidst dense olive—groves. Olive-oil is the staple
Commodity, the ﬁnest kinds being produced here and at Oneglia.
Porto Maurizio, with a ﬁne domed church and a charming Giardino
Pubblico, is visited for sea-bathing.

_ 73 M. San Lorenzo alMare. The low, massive towers which rise
at intervals along the coast to the right of the line, some of them
converted into dwelling-houses, were erected in the 9th and 10th
centuries. -— 771/2 M. Santa Stefano - Rivaligure. To the right on
the hill is the fortiﬁed Santa Stefano. The train crosses the Taggia,

" The picturesque little town of Taggia (omn. from San Remo, p. 90)
lies 2‘]: M. up the valley of the river. Gian. Dom. Rufﬁnt (1807-81), poet
and patriot, lived here from 1875 till his death. The road goes on viii
(7 H.) Badalucco, at the beginning of the San Remo acqueduct, and Mon-
talto 'to (121/2 M.) Trtora. ﬁnely situated among the mountains.

Beyond a short tunnel a valley on the right affords a charming
view of Bussana Vecchia, romantically perched on a hillock. The
mine of this village, which was completely destroyed by the earth-
quake of 1887, are worth visiting (key of the ruined church at
Bussana Nuova, 11/2 M. lower down). The village opposite is
Paggio, which ﬁrst becomes visible. Then a tunnel under the
