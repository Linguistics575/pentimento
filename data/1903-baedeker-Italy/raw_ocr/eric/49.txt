Xxxviii ITALIAN ART.

1y only, lies in the past; to conjure up this, and bring about
a Renaissance of the antique, appears to be the goal of their
aspirations. They apply themselves to their task with calmness
and concentration, they indulge in no bold or novel schemes, but
are content to display their love of form in the execution of details.
What architecture as a whole loses in historical attraction is
compensated by the beauty of the individual ediﬁces. While
the North possesses structures of greater importance in the deve10p-
ment of art, Italy boasts of a far greater number of pleasing works.
There is hardly a district in Italy which does not boast of
interesting examples of Romanesque architecture. At Verona we
Ron”, may mention the famous church of St. Zeno, with its sculp-
nsqun tured portals. In the same style are the cathedrals of Far--
Gamma“ rara, Modena. Puma, and Piacenza, the church of Sant’ Am-
brogio at Milan, with its characteristic fore-court and facade, and
that of San Michele at Pavia. Tuscany abounds with Romanesque
ediﬁces. Among these the palm is due to the cathedral of Pisa, a
- church of spacious dimensions in the interior, superbly embellished
with its marble of two colours and the rows of columns on its facade.
To the same period also belong the neighbouring Leaning Tower and
the Baptistery. The churches of Lucea are copies of those at Pisa.
Those of Florence, however, such as the octagonal, dome-covered
Baptistery and the above-mentioned church of San Miniato, exhibit
an independent style.

The position occupied by Italy with regard to Gothic archi.
tecture is thus rendere‘d obvious. She could not entirely
ignore its inﬂuence, although incapable of according an un.
conditional reception to this, the highest development 01
vault-architecture. Gothic was introduced into Italy in a mature
and perfected condition. It did not of necessity, as in France,
develop itself from the earlier (Romanesque) style, its progress
cannot be traced step by step; it was imported by foreign architects
and adopted as being in consonance with the tendency of the age;
it found numerous admirers among the mendicant orders of monks
and the humbler classes of citizens, but could never quite dis-
engage itself from Italianising inﬂuences. It was so far transformed
that the constructive constituents of Gothic are degraded to a de-
corative ofﬁce, and the national taste thus became reconciled to it.
The cathedral of Milan cannot be regarded as a fair specimen 01
Italian Gothic, but this style must rather be sought for in the
medizeval cathedrals of Florence, Siena, Owieto, in the church 01
San Petronio at Bologna, and in numerous secular ediﬁces, such
as the Loggia dei Lanzi at Florence, the communal palaces 01
towns in Central Italy, and the palaces of Venice. An acquaintance
with true Gothic construction, so contracted notwithstanding all its
apparent richness, so exclusively adapted to practical requirements,
can certainly not be acquired from these cathedrals. The spacious
