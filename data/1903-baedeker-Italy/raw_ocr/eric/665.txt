IV. SALOON, originally a chapel, afterwards (from about 1630)
a prison for those condemned to death, adorned with sadly damaged
frescoes, ascribed to Giotto, but perhaps executed after the ﬁre in
1337 by his pupils (restored after 1840).

(p. 225). —- The Sum ROOM, to the right, contains ﬁne specimens
of weaving and embroidery and handsome ecclesiastical vestments
(Carrand Collection).

bequeathed by C. Ressmann (1900), the statesman. The two central
cases contain carvings in ivory. In the ﬁrst are two triptychs by
Baldassare degti Embriarchi (p. 145); leaf of a consular triptych Oi

bcrti, and the same by Fit. anelteschi, the earliest Renaissance
sculptures, produced in their competition for the execution of the
gates Of the Baptistery (p. 451). The composition of Ghiberti is
the less harmonious but the calmer of the two. Its digniﬁed draped
ﬁgures, especially that of Isaac, are full of a true antique feeling
for beauty, while in Brunelleschi’s relief the principal ﬁgures are
represented in violent movement, and Isaac is besides remarkably
ugly. The subordinate ﬁgures, including the ram, are also in posi.
tions of over—strained activity. In technical execution Ghiberti is
superior. 14, 15. Cruciﬁxion (relief) and a small Frieze of children
