the square in front of the theatre is a bronze Statue of Victor Em-
manuel II. A bronze bust commemorates Pietro Cerretti, the philo-
sOpher, who was born at Intra in 1823. In the vicinity are several
ﬁne villas with beautiful gardens. The *Villa Framosini (Count
Barbe), 1/2 M. to the N.E., and the Villa Ada of M. Ceriani, 3/, M.

To the S. of Intra the Punta Castagnola, with its wealth of
luxuriant vegetation, stretches far into the lake. As soon as we
double the cape and enter the wide W. bay of the lake, we obtain
a ’View of the Borromean Islands (p. 179): near the S. bank is the
15019. Bella, to the W. of it, the Isola dei Pescatori, in front, the
Isola Madre. The little Isola San Giovanni (no adm.), close to the
N. bank, with its chapel, house, and garden, is also one of the Bor—
romean Islands. Behind the Isola dei Pescatori rises the blunt
pyramid of the Mottarone (p. 181); farther to the W. appear the
White quarries near Baveno; while the background is ﬁlled up by
the snow-clad mountains between the Simplon and the Monte Rosa.
