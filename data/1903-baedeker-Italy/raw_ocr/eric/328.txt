- Bergamo (820-1200 ft.), the ancient Bergomum, a Milanese
town from 1264 to 1428 but after that Venetian until 1797, now a
provincial capital and episcopal see, with 46,861 inhab. (suburbs
included), lies at the junction of the Valle Brembana, watered by
the Brcmbo, and the Valle Set-lama, named after the rapid Set-lo
(another afﬂuent of the Adda). This is one of the busiest of the
smaller trading and manufacturing towns in Italy, although its once
famous fair (Fiera di Sant’ Alessandro, middle of August to middle
of September) has lost its importance. The town consists of two
distinct parts, the Cittzt Alla, picturesquely situated on hills and
strongly fortiﬁed by the Venetians in 1561-88, and the much larger
new quarters in the plain (Borgo Sam Leonardo, Borgo Pignolo,
30790 San Tommaso), with numerous cotton, silk, and other fac-
tories and an interesting piazza (Fiera; Pl. D, 4).

From the railway-station (Pl. D, E, 6) the broad Vials della
Stazione leads to the PIAZZA Vn'ronro EMANUELE (P1. D, 5), with
a statue of Victor Emmanuel II. by Barzaghi (PL 19). The Via
Borfuro leads hence to the W. to Sant’ Alessandro in Colonna (Pl. 5;
C, 5), containing a ﬁne I"Assumption by Romanino (left transept).
The church is named from the partly antique column in front of
it, at which St. Alexander, tutelary saint of Bergamo, is said to
have suffered martyrdom.

To the N.E., beyond the Teatro Gaetano Doniselti (P1. 25; D, 6),
is the PIAZZA Domzn'rrr, with a monument by Franc. J erace (1897)
to Gaetano Donizcttl (1798-1848), who was a native of Bergamo;
the composer, seated upon an ancient Greek exedra, receives the
inepiration of a Muse. — In the Via Torquato Tasso, on the N.
