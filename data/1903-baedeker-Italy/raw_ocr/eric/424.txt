though his oil-paintings are distributed throughout the galleries of Europe,
several of his most striking works, chieﬂy religious compositions, are
still reserved at Venice.

uch was the vitality and vigour and so great were the resources of
the Venetian School, that even masters of secondary rank fre uently pro-
duced works of the highest excellence. There is frequently ut little to
choose between them in their skill in using colour. Foremost among
them are Sebasuano del Pionabo (1485-1547), who afterwards yielded to the
fascinating inﬂuence of Michael Angelo, Rocco Marconi, the dreamy Lorenzo
Lotto (1480-1656), Bonifazs’o I. (‘Bon. dot Pitch", or ‘Bon. Veroneu‘: comp. p. 2‘23,
*of whose life little is yet known, Giovanni Antonio (do) Pordenone (1
1539), whose ﬂesh-tints are unsurpassed, and Paris Bordons (1600-71),
whose partraits rival those of Titian. To a younger generation belongs
Jacopo Tintoretto (Robustt', 1519-94), who squandered excellent abilities on
superficial works (Vasari calls him ‘il piu terribile cervello, che abbia
avuto mai la pittura‘), and in his eagerness for eﬁ‘ect lost the golden tints
of his school. Paolo Caliéri, surnamed Vsronesc (1528-88), on the other
hand, though more realistic, maintains the best traditions of his school. Last
among the masters of note were the Bassano‘s (p. 258), Palma Gioranc, and
Padoranino. To the 18th cent. belong Gtoo. Baa; Tis olo (ca. 1693-1770),
a spirited decorative artist, Antonio Canals (1697-17 , an architectural
painter, and his pupil Bern. Belotto (1724-80), both surnamed Canaletto, all
much admired by their contemporaries.

Visitors to Venice should be provided with ‘Life on the Lagoons,

if (2nd edit., London, 1894), by Horatio F. Brown, an excellent little book,

which furnishes answers to most of the questions about Venice that sug-
gest themselves to the intelligent visitor. The same author‘s ‘Venice: an
Historical Sketch of the Republic’ (1893) and ‘Venetian Studies‘ (1887) are
also recommended. It is, of course, well to be familiar with Ruskin‘s‘atones

. of Venice‘, or at least with the ‘Introductory Chapters and Local ludices,

printed separately for the use of travellers‘ (in 2 octave vols.; 1881). His
‘St. Mark‘s Rest, the History of Venice written for the help of the few
travellers who still care for her Monuments‘ is issued in the same form
as the better-known ‘liornings in Florence‘. The ‘Venice‘ of Mr. J. 0.
Bare (3rd edit. , 1891) is an interesting and convenient manual; the
‘Venetian Life‘ of Mr. W. D. Howells is one of the most charming books
of its kind. Bernhard Bermon‘s “Venetian Painters of the Renaissance,
with an index to their works‘ (1894), will be found useful b the art-

‘ lover. The Rev. Dr. Alex. Robertson‘s ‘Fra Paolo Sarpi‘ (2nd e it., 1894)

deals with a critical epoch of Venetian history, and his ‘Bible of St. Mark,
the Altar and Throne of Venice‘ deals exhaustively with the history,
mosaics, and sculptures of St. Mark‘s Church. See also the ‘Renaissance
in Italy , by J. A. Symondsz- ‘Venice‘, by the Hon. Alsthea Wtsl (‘Btory of
the Nation's Series‘; 1894):, The Makers of Venice‘ by Hrs. oupam; and
‘Vﬁnice‘ by-Grant Allen Historical Guides series). - Mr. Ruskin advises
the traveller who is fan of paintings to devote his principal attention ‘to
the works of Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and John Bellini; not of course
neglecting Titian, yet remembering that Titian can- be well and thoroughly
studied in almost an great EurOpean gallery while Tintoret and Bellini
can be judged of on y in Venice, and Paul eronese . . . . is not to be
full estimated until he is seen at play among the fantastic chequers oi
the enetian ceilings‘.
