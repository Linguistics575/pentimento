of Florence. CERTOSA DI VAL D’EMA. 59. Route. 523

We ascend slightly in a straight direction by a footpath to the (‘2 min.)
old Torre a1 Gallo (625 ft.), so called after a family named Galli, and
now belonging to Count Galletti, who has restored it in the style of
the 14th century. It contains a telescope and various other remini-
scences of Galileo, who from this tower is said to have made several
important astronomical observations. In the basement are a portrait
of Galileo by Sustcrmans, a portrait of Michael Angelo, and other
objects of little interest. The platform at the top of the tower affords
a splendid 'Panorama of Florence and the valley of the Arno, ex-
tending on the E. to the mountains of Pratomagno (best by evening
light; adm. 1/2 in). —-— From the small piazza mentioned at p. 5‘22 the
Via della Torre al Gallo (views) descends in 1/4 hr. to the Viale
dei Colli (station of the electric tramway, p. 434), whence we may
proceed to the right to (10 min.) the Piazzale Michelangelo and San
Miniato (comp. Map).

The road diverging to the right from the small square at Torre a] Gallo
leads to ('l min.) the Villa of Galileo, marked by a bust and inscri tion,
where the great astronomer passed the last years of his life (165,142),
surrounded by a few faithful friends and latterly deprived of sight, and
where he was visited by his illustrious contemporary Milton. -— The road
then ascends in windin s to the church of Santa Hargherita a Kontlci and
to the Villa Harocchi, w ere Francesco Gus'cciardini is said to have finished
his histOry of Italy. Here too, on 12th Aug, 1530, the Florentines, who
had been betrayed by their general Malatesta Bsglione, signed the articles
by which the city was surrendered to the Imperial troops and thus became
subject to the rule of the Medici. From that event the house derives its
name Villa della Bugle (‘villa of lies‘).

(d. ) La Cnn'rosa lies on the monotonous highroad to Siena, 3 M.
from the Porta Romans. (Pl. A, 7; steam-tramway thence, see No. 1,
p. 434; also omnibus every 1/2 hr., 25 c.; carr. 6 fr., via Poggio
Imperiale a little more). The steam—tramway ascends from the Porta
Romans to Gelsomino, below Pogglo Imperialc (p. 522), where it
unites with the electric line from the Piazza del Duomo (No.8, p. 434).
At Due Strade it reaches the highroad to the Certosa. Farther on,
to the right, is the Protestant Cemetery of Florence (also used by
members of the Greek church), beyond which are the village of
Galluzzo (several unpretending trattor‘ie, with gardens) and, a little
farther on, the brook Ema. On the hill of Montaguto, which is
clothed with cypresses and olive-trees, at the conﬂuence of the
Ema with the Grave and 5 min. above the road, rises the imposing
Gertosa di Val d’Ema (375 ft.), resembling a mediasval fortress. The
monastery, which is approaching dissolution and contains a few in—
mates only, was founded in 1341 by Niccolo Acciajoli, a Flor-
entine who had settled at Naples and there amassed a large fortune
by trading. One of the monks (1—2 pers. 50 c.) shows the churches

and the monastery with its various cloisters.
