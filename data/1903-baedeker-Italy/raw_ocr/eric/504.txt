Quattro Castella, with the ruins of four castles which Once belonged to the
Countess Matilda of Tuscany (d. 1115), San Polo d‘Enza (p. 346), and Vice,
to Oiano d‘Enza. whence a bridle-path ascends to the castle. The drive
via Pujancllo and Pccorile (785 ft.) is, however, prettier, and beyond the
latter village the route (on horseback or on feet) cannot be mistaken.
The path leads through the village, and then to the right towards the
church of Casela, which is left on the hill to the right; at the angle
of the hill Canossa comes in sight, and the path leads in the direction
of the village along the Campela. The walk to the foot of the castle-hill
takes 1 hr.; we then ascend for 1/2 hr. in the direction of the church
of San Paolo, which lies three-quarters of the way up the hill, fellow a
level path round the castle-rock and at the back of the small village of
Canona, and lastly mount to the summit of the rock, which is crowned
by the scanty, ivy-clad ruins of the castle of Oanoua. The castle once
belonged to the Countess of Tuscan above mentioned and was destroyed
by the inhabitants of Reggie in 1&6. The Emp. I-I’enry IV. performed
penance here in presence of Pepe Gregory VII. during three days in 1077.
