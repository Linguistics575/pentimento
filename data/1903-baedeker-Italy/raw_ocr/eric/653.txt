of‘ancient sculpture and modern painting. The hall was constructed
by Bernardo Buontalcnti ,- the decorations are by Bernard ino Poccetti.
In the centre are placed ﬁve celebrated marble sculptures: *Satyr
playing on the cymbal and pressing the scabellum or hmpeaion with
his foot; the admirable head and the arms were restored by Michael
Angelo (‘2). *Group of the Wrestler-3',- the heads, which resemble
those of the Children of Niobe, do not belong-to the ﬁgures, and
the greater part of the legs and arms is modern; the right arm of
the victor is erroneously restored. *Medici Venus, found at Rome
in the 16th cent., and brought to Florence in 1680; the affected];
held ﬁngers and the inscription on the base are modern. The
*Grinder, a Scythian whetting his knife to ﬂay Marsyas, found at
Rome in the 16th cent. (from the same group as the Marsyas,
No. 156, mentioned on p. 461). The I"Apollino, or young Apollo
(freely restored).

PAINTINGS. To the right of the entrance: “1129. Raphael, Ma-
donna and Child with the goldﬁnch (‘cardellino’), painted in Florence
about 1507, pieced together again after a ﬁre in 1548.

The ‘Madonna del Cardellino‘, the ‘Madonna a1 Verde’ at Vienna.
and ‘La belle Jardiniére‘ in the Louvre form a group nearly allied in
point of conception. To the earlier and simpler representations of the
Madonna, in which Mary and her Son alone appear, the child John the
Baptist has been added. This not only admits of the delineation of ad-
ditional features of child-lite, but; also makes possible the construction
of a regularly-arranged group. The two children, standing at the feet a!
the Madonna, form a broad base for the composition, which tapers up-
wards easily and naturally to the head of the Virgin. This arrangement I
ﬁrst found ex ression within the realms of sculpture, whence it was
eagerly adOpte by the Florentine painters. -— Springer. \

(1494).

*1117. Titian, Venus of Urbino (probably the Duchess Ele
nora; p. 467), painted for Francesco della Revere, Duke of Urbm
about 1537.

‘Not after the model of a Phryne, nor yet with the thought of rel}-
izing anything more sublime than woman in her fairest aspect,
Titian conceive this picture. Nature as he presents it hereis young anal
lovely, not transﬁgured into ineﬂ'able noblesse, but conscious and trim!”
