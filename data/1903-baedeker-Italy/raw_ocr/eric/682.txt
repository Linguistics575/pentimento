Adjacent to the church is the entrance to the once far—famedV
monastery of San Marco (Pl. G, 3), suppressed in 1867, and now
restored and ﬁtted up as the Museo diSan Marco (adm., see p. 437;
catalogue, 1869, 11/2 fr.). The building was originally occupied
by ‘Silvestrine' monks, but was transferred under Cosimo the Elder
to the Dominicans, who were favoured by the Medici. In 1437-43
it was restored in a handsome style from designs by Mieheloazo,
and shortly afterwards it was decorated by Fra Giovanni Angelica
da Fiesole (1387-1465) with those charming *Frescoes which to this
day are unrivalled in their portrayal of profound and devoted piety.
The painter Fro Bartolomeo delta Porta (1475-1517) was a monk
in this monastery from 1500 and the powerful preacher Girolama
Sacanarola (burned at the stake in 1498, see p. 442) also once
lived here.

The Frnsr CLorsrans, which are entered immediately from the street,
contain a fresco by Pbccettt in the 6th lunette to the right of the entrance,
showing the original facade of the cathedral (comp. p. 4.62), and four
otherlunettes with frescoes by I‘m Angelica .- to the left of Poccetti‘s fresco,
over the entrance to the ‘foresteria‘, or apartments devoted to hospitality,
'Christ as a pilgrim welcomed by two Dominican monks (‘No scene more
true, more noble, or more exquisitely rendered than this, can be
imagined‘: 0. at 0.); over the door of the refectory, Christ with the
wound-prints, the head of elevated beaut and divine gentleness; over the
door to the chapter-house (see below), t. Dominic with the scourge of
nine thongs (damaged); farther on, over the door to the sacristy, St. Peter
the Martyr, indicating the rule of silence peculiar to the order by placing
his ﬁnger on his lips. To the right of the last is a ﬁfth fresco y Fm
Angelica Christ on the Cross, with St. Dominic. — The second door in
the wall, opposite the entrance leads to the CHAPTER House, which contains
a large ‘Cruciﬁxion (Christ between the thieves), surrounded by a group of
twenty saints. all lifesize, with busts of Dominicans below, by Fra Angelica.
The sympathetic grief of the saints is most poignantly expressed.

The door in the E. corner of the cloisters leads to a vestibule contain-
ing photographs of Fra Angelico‘s paintings, beyond which is the Guru
Burnoronr. The back-wall of the latter is adorned with the so-called
*Providenza (the brothers and St. Dominic seated at a table and fed by
two angels), and a Cruciﬁxion by Gian. Ant. Sogltant.

The door to the left of the chapter-house leads to the SECOND Caorsrass,
which, with the rooms on the right, have accommodated since 1898 the
architectural fragments (chieﬂy mediteval), coats-of-arms inscriptions,
squ tures, and frescoes removed from the demolished palazzi of the Centro
