bridge), with 3061 inhab., is ﬁnely situated 1 M. above the station,
at the entrance to the Val Toumanche. Its houses are picturesquely
scattered over the gorge of the Matmoirc or Mai-more, a torrent de-
scendiug from the Matterhorn; and in the middle of the town is a
bridge spanning the ravine in one ﬁne arch. (To Val Tournanche,
and over the Theodule Pass to Zermatt, see Bacdcker’s Switzerland.)

The line crosses the Matmoire, traverses a deep cutting through a
deposit of debris, threads two tunnels, and reaches (671/2 M.) Cham-
bavc (1555 ft.), noted for its wine. To the W. opens the view of the
beautiful valley of Aosta, rich in fruit and surrounded by lofty
mountains, with the three-peaked Ruter (p. 60) in the background.

Beyond a tunnel the line traverses a mass of debris at Diemoz
(viaduct 107 yds. long), and crosses the Dora. To the left lies the
picturesque chateau of Finis (with old mural paintings), at the mouth
of the Clavalitc’ Valley, through which peeps the snowy peak of the
Tmica (p. 58). The train crosses the Dora twice and reaches (72 M.)
Nu: (1755 ft.; Croce d’Oro), with a mined castle, at the mouth of
the Val St. Barthélemy. We then recross to the right bank of the
Dora. 0n the SIOpe above (73 M.) St. Marcel, which lies at the
mouth of the valley of the same name (p. 58), is the much-frequented
pilgrimage-church of Plan. We again cross the Dora to (741/2 M.)
Quart- Villefranchc (1755 ft), with the chateau of Quart on a hill to

Aosta (1910 ft.), with 7554 inhab., the Augusta Praetoria Salas-
serum of the Romans and now the capital of the Italian province of
Aosta, lies at the conﬂuence of the Buthier and the Doirc or Dora
Baltea. The valley 'was anciently inhabited by the Salassi, a Celtic
me, who commanded the passage of the Great and the Little
St. Bernard,the two chief routes fr'om Italy to Gaul. They frequently
harassed the Romans in various ways, until they were conquered in
M). 25 by Terentius Varro, who sold many of them as slaves at
Eporedia (p. 51). To protect the roads Varro then founded a camp,
790 yds. long and 625 yds. broad, with 2‘2. square towers, and gar-
risoned it with 3000 soldiers of the Praetorian cohorts. The import-
ance of the Roman Aosta is indicated by the extant remains.

Near the railway-station, which lies on the S. side of the town,
is an excellent bronze Statue of Victor Emmanuel II., by Tortone
(1886), commemorating the king’s sporting expeditions amid the
Graian Alps. A short walk brings us to the ancient Town Walls.
