The Maritime and Liam-tan Alps and the contiguous Apennines (the bound-
ary between which is some 20 M. to the W. of Genoa) slope gentlynortho
wards to the P0 in the form of an extensive rolling country, and descend
abruptly towards the sea to the S. The narrow Rrvmna, or coast-district,
is sheltered from the N. wind by the mountains, and enjoys a ﬁne sunny
aspect. While the mean temperature at Turin is 52° Fahr., it is no less
than 61° at Genoa; and again, while the temperature of January averages
31' at the former, and occasional] falls below zero, it averages 46" at the
latter, and is rarely lower than 2 °. The climate of the Riviera is there-
fore milder than that of Rome, and ever since the middle of the 19th cent.
has attracted crowds of visitors, ﬂeeing from the northern winters.

The Riviera, divided by Genoa into an eastern (Riviera dt‘ Levante; p. 96)
and a larger western half (Riviera dt' Ponsnte), which belongs to France from
Ventimiglia westwards, is one of the most picturesque regions of Italy. It
affords a delightful variety of landscapes bold and lofty promontories alter-
nating with wooded hills, and richly cu tivated plains near the coast. At
places the road passes precipitous and frowning cliffs, washed by the surf
of the Mediterranean, while the summits are crowned with the venerable
ruins of towers erected in bygone ages for protection against pirates. At
other places extensive plantations of olives, with their grotesque and gnarled
stems, bright green pine-forests, and luxuriant growths of ﬁgs, vines,
citrons, oranges oleanders, myrtles, and aloes meet the view, and even
palms are occasionally seen. Many of the towns are charmingly situated
in fertile spots Or on picturesque hills; others, commanded by ancient
strongholds, are perched like nests among the rocks. Little churches and
chapels peering from the sombre foliage of cypresses, and gigantic grey
pinnacles of rock frowning upon the smiling plains, frequently enhance
the charms of the scenery, while the vast expanse of the Mediterranean,
with its ever—varying hues, forms one of the chief attractions. At one
ﬁne the sea is bathed in a ﬂood of sunshine, at. another its. beautiful blue
colour arrests the eye; or while the shore immediately below the spectator
is fashed with wild breakers, the snowy crests of the waves are gradually
loftened to view in the purple distance. ,
