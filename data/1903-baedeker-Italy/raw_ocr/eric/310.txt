Stresa (690 ft.), cooler and more breezy than the other places on
the lake, occupies a picturesque and attractive situation, with the
country-houses of many of the Italian noblesse, and is a suitable
spot for a lengthened stay during the summer months. The Villa
Ductile, adjoining the Alb. Milano on the W., belongs to the Duch—
ess of Genoa, and the new building in the park belongs to her son
the Duke of Genoa. — About 10 min. above the village, to the S.
(reached by ascending from the Alb. Reale), stands the Collegio
Romini (875 ft), a Rosminian seminary. The church contains the
monument of the philosopher and statesman Ant. Rosmim‘ (1797-
1855) with an admirable recumbent ﬁgure by Vela. The front of
the church commands a beautiful view of Pallanza, Intra, and the
islands. -— Above the lake, 1/2 M. to the S.E., is the beautifully
situated Villa Pallavicino, and 1/4 M. farther on is the Villa Vignﬁlo,
both with ﬁne gardens (visitors admitted).
