LEGHOBN. 55. Route. 401

Leghorn (Ital. Liuorno , French Ltvourne), which was a very
insigniﬁcant place in the 16th cent. (in 1551 only 749 inhab.), now
the capital of a province, the seat of the Royal Marine Academy,
and the most important commercial place in Italy after Genoa, is
indebted for its size and importance to the Medici, who invited
hither the oppressed and discontented from all parts of the con-
tinent, as, for example Roman Catholics from England, Jews and
Moors from Spain and Portugal, and merchants from Marseilles, who
were anxious to escape from the perils of civil war. Montesquieu
consequently calls Leghorn ‘the masterpiece of the dynasty of the
Medici’. The town is uncompromisingiy modern and has no import-
ant monuments of art. The population amounts to 96,628 (many
Jews), exclusive of a ﬂuctuating sea—faring community of fully
3000. Leghorn carries on a brisk trade with the Levant in cotton,
wool, and unbleached silk, and with the Black Sea in grain and
petroleum. The most important industrial establishments are the
ship-building yard of the Brothers Orlando (p. 402), the Metal-
!nrgica Italians (a large iron-foundry), the large glass-works in
l‘orretta (the N. suburb), the porcelain-factories, and the oil-mills.
The town isintersected by canals, and connected by a navigable canal
vith the Arno, which ﬂows into the Mediterranean 9 M. to the N.
