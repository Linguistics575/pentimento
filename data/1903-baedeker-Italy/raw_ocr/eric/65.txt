undertook. He regarded careful physical training as scarcely less
important than comprehensive culture of the mind; the vigour 0:
his imagination served also to stimulate the exercise of his intellect:
and his minute observation of nature deve10ped his artistic taste and
organ of form. One is frequently tempted to regard Leonardo’:
works as mere studies , in which he tested his powers, and whicl
occupied his attention so far only as they gratiﬁed his .love 0;
investigation and experiment. At all events his personal impor-
tance has exercised a greater inﬂuence than his productions at
an artist, especially as his prejudiced age strenuously sought tc
obliterate all trace of the latter. Few of Leonardo’s work
have been preserved in Italy, and these sadly marred by neglect

careful research inclines us to attribute them to his pupils. Un.

The best idea of his reforms in the art of colouring is obtained b1
an attentive examination of the works of the Milan school_(Lm1n
Sanamo; p. 117), as these are far better preserved than the em:
undoubted work of Leonardo’s Milan period in Italy: the Las
Supper in Santa Maria delle Grazie (p. 136). Although now a total
wreck, it is still well calculated to convey an idea of the net
epoch of Leonardo, especially to those who have studied Morghen’
engraving of the picture. The spectator should ﬁrst examine th
delicate equilibrium of the composition, and observe how the in
dividual groups are complete in themselves, and yet simultaneousl
point to a common centre and impart a monumental character t
the work; then the remarkable physiognomical ﬁdelity whici
pervades every detail, the psychological distinctness of char-acts]
and the dramatic life, together with the calmness of the entir
bearing of the picture. He will then comprehend that with Leonard.
a new era in Italian painting was inaugurated, that the devel
opment of art had attained its perfection.

The accuracy of this assertion will perhaps be doubted by th
amateur when he turns from Leonardo to Michael Angelo (1475
can; 1564). On the one hand he hears Michael Angelo extolle.
