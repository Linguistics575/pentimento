218 Route 36. CHIARANO.

Spanish Succession. Almost entirely shut in on the N., E., and
W. by lofty mountains, Arco is frequented as a winter-resort by
consumptive and nervous patients. The climate resembles that
of Gardens (p. 212), but Arco has fewer showers and is somewhat
less moist (relative moisture 72 per cent) and cooler in winter. The
Ora (p. 211) is sometimes troublesome, especially at the beginning
of spring. The vegetation is thoroughly southern in character
(p. 211); numerous olive-groves.

The most frequented resorts of the visitors are in the neigh-
bourhood of the two largest hotels and the new Salons Municipale,
and the Ourplats, a little to the E. To the N. of the last are the
Collegiate Church (1603-18) and the old town-palace of the Counts
of Area, with faded frescoes.

The magnolia avenue between the two chief hotels is continued
to the W., by a road passing numerous villas, to Chiarano (see below).
A side-road at the W. end of the avenue leads to the right to the
garden and villa of the Archduke Frederick (no adm.).

Exounsrons. To the N. by sunny paths to the 0am Bianca, Yeduta
Maria, and the live-oaks (in all 3/4-1 hr.- guide-posts). The Castle of Area
is reached from the Curplatz in less than Ilg hr. (key at one of the chemists;
fee 60-80 Ia). — The romantic Via di Prabz', diver ing to the left on this
side of the bridge, between the castle-rock and t e Sarca, traverses the
imposing remains of a huge landslip to (1 hr.) Geniga (inn), whence we
may return by a stony path through the Laghel Valley, passing the small
Lake Laahel, which is dry in summer (13/. hr.).

Pleasant walk to the W. hamlet of (“/4 M.) Chiarano, with the Villa
Angerer (rich Mediterranean ﬂora in the garden) and the Villa Garda, pre-
sented to the German emperor in 1901 by Herr Hildebrand, and now
a convalescent home for ofﬁcers. Fine views. Thence we proceed either
by the road to the left, via the convent of Santa Maﬁa della Grazia to
(3 M.) Var-one (p. 216), or to the right via Wane to (3/4 H.) Varignano and
thence ascend to the right by a rough path, affording beautiful views, to
(11/4 hr.) Tenno (p. 218). From Tenno we descend by Cologne to (40 min.)
Var-one, and return across the plain to (3 M.) Arco.
