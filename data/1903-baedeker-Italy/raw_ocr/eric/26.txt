Begging (accattonaggio), always one of those national nuisances
to which the traveller in Italy must accustom himself, has recently
somewhat in creased, especially in Tuscany, owing partly to growing
poverty, but largely also to the misplaced generosity of travellers.
As the proﬁts of street- beggars too frequently go for the support of
able—bodied loafers, travellers should either give nothing, or restrict
their charity to the obviously inﬁrm. Gratuities to children are
entirely reprehensible. --- Importunate beggars should be dismissed
with ‘niente’ or by a gesture of negation.

VI. Gratuities. Guides.

Gratuities. — The traveller should always be abundantly
supplied with supper and nickel coin in a country where triﬂing
donations are in constant demand. ‘Drivers, guides, and other per-
sons of the same class invariably eXpect, and often demand-as their
right, a gratuity (buona mane, mancia, da bcrc, bottiglia, caﬂ’c,
sigd'ro) in addition to the hire agreed on, varying according to circum-
stances from 2-3 sons to a franc or more. The traveller need have
no sample in limiting his donations to the smallest possible sums.
The following hints will be found useful by the average tourist. In
private collections 1-2 visitors should bestow a gratuity of 1/2-1 fr.,
34 pers. 14% fr. For repeated visits 25 c. is enough for a single
visitor. For opening a church—door, etc., 109-20 c. is enough, but if
extra services are rendered (43.9. uncovering an altar-piece, lighting
candles, etc.) from 1/4 to 1 fr. may be given. The Omtodi of all
public collections where an admission—fee is charged are forbidden
to accept gratuities. ~— In hotels and restaurants‘about 5-10 per
cent of the reckoning should be given in gratuities, or less if service
is charged for.

, Valets de Place ( Guide, sing. la Guide) may be hired at 6-10 fr.
per day. The most trustworthy are those attached to the chief
hotels. In some towns the better guides have formed societies as
‘Gnide patentate’ or ‘Gnid e autorizzate’. ‘ Their services may generally
well be dispensed with by those who are not pressed for time. Pur-
chases should never be made, nor contracts with vetturini or other
persons drawn up, in presence or with the aid of a commissionnaire,
as any such intervention. tends considerably to increase the prices.
