The little town of Orta (1029 inhab.) consists mainly of 3. Frame,
Open on the side next the lake, one long narrow street, and a
number of villas lining the road to the station. It lies opposite
the small Isola San Giulio, at the S.W. base of the Monte d’Orta
(1315 ft.), or Sacra Monte, a beautifully wooded hill, stretching
out into the lake. The ascent of the Sacro Monte may be made
either from a point halfway between the town and the station (see
above) or from the Piazza, through the grounds of the Villa of
Marchcsc Natta (50 c.). In the 16th cent. 20 chapels were erected
here in honour of St. Francis of Assisi, each containing a scene from
his history in painted lifesize ﬁgures of terracotta, with a back—
ground ‘al fresco’. The best groups are in the 13th, 16th, and
20th chapels; in the last is represented the canonisation of the
saint (fee for adm. to each chapel, 20-30 c.). Various points on the
hill command charming surveys of the lake, while the panorama from
the Campanile at the t0p (50 c.) includes the snowy Monte Rosa,
rising above the lower hills to the W.

A boat to the lack: San Giulio and back costs 11/2 fr. The ancient church
here was founded, according to the legend, by St. Julius, who came from
Greece in 379 to convert the natives, and has been frequently restored.
It contains reliefs, old frescoes, and a Romanesque pulpit. In the sacristy
are a Madonna by Gaudenzio Ferrari and some old vestments, while the
Crypt, below the high-altar, contains a shrine of silver and crystal, with
the body of St. Julius.
