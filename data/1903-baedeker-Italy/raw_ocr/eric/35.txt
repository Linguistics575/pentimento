XI. Sights. Theatres. Shops.

The larger Churches are epen in the morning till 12, and generally
again from 2, 3, or 4 to 7 p.m., while the most important are often
open the whole day. Many of the smaller churches are Open only
till 8 or 9 a.m. Visitors may inspect the works of art even during
divine service, provided they move about noiselessly, and keep
aloof from the altar where the clergy are ofﬁciating. On the occasion
of festivals and for a week or two before Easter the works of art
are often entirely concealed by the temporary decorations. Those
always covered are shown by the verger (sagratano), who expects
30-50 c. from a single traveller, more from a party (p. xv).

Museums, picture-galleries, etc., are usually open from 9 or 10
to 4 o’clock. All the collections which belong to government are
open free on Sun. and holidays, but on week-days a charge is usually
made. Gratuities are forbidden. The cillectlons are closed on the
following public holidays: New Year’s Day, Epiphany (6th Jan.),
Easter Sunday, Ascension Day (Ascensione), Whitsunday, Féte
de Dieu (Corpus Christi), the Festa dello Statute (ﬁrst Sunday in
June), Assumption of the Virgin (Assunzione; 16th Aug), Nativity
of the Virgin (8th Sept), Festival of the Annunciation (25th Mar.),
All Saints’ Day (1st Nov.), and Christmas Day; also the birthdays
of the king (11th Nov.) and queen (8th Jan). The arrangements,
however, vary in different places. For Florence, see p. 436.

Artists, archaeologists, and scholars, on making application to the
Ministry of Education on a. stamped form (1 fr. ‘20 c.), receive free tickets
(tassera ds‘ libero ingresso), valid all over the country. For a single town
the application is made to the Director of the Gallery (stamp 60 0.). The
application must be accompanied by an unmounted photograph and by a
certiﬁcate from a university or some similar body, countersigned by an
Italian consul in the applicant‘s country.

Theatres. Performances begin at 8, 8.30, or 9, and terminate at mid-
night or later. In the large theatres, in which the season (stagionc,l
frequently lasts only from St. Stephen’s Day (Dec. 26th) to the end
of the Carnival, operas and ballets are exclusively performed. The
ﬁrst act- of an opera is usually succeeded by a. ballet of three acts
or more. The pit (platEa), to which the ‘biglietto d’ingmto’ gives
access, has standing-room only; for seats additional tickets must
be taken (usually in advance in the larger towns). A boxfpalco di
primo, secondo, terse ordine), which must always be secured in ad-
vance, is the pleasantest place for ladies or for a party of several
persons. Evening dress is generally worn in the boxes. Other re“-
served seats are the pom-one (front stalls) and the posti distinti or sedit
(rear stalls). In some of the larger theatres good seats may be ob-?
tained in the anﬁteatro or prfma galleria. The theatre is the usual
