and colour with magic light and shade. . . . Far away from those humble
conceptions of place which mark the saintly pictures of earlier times, the
Pesari kneel in the portico of a temple, the pillars of which soar to the
sky in preportions hitherto unseen. . . . The Virgin sits on her throne,
bending down in a graceful kindly way, and directs her glance towards
the kneeling ‘Bafi‘o‘ (Jacopo Pesaro, BishOp of Paphos), her white veil
falling over one shoulder, but caught on the other by the infant Christ ‘
who peeps with delightful glee from beneath it at St. Francis (behind
whom, in the background, is St. Anthony of Padua). . . . To the left front
of the throne St. Peter at a desk interrupts his reading, and marks the
line with his ﬁnger as he turns to look down at Baﬁ'o, who kneels in
prayer on the ﬂoor below. In the rear between both an armed knight
with the standard of the church unfurled and a captive Turk bound by
a rope symbolizes the victory of the Pesari. Below, to the right, are
Benedetto Pesaro and the members of his family (0'. d- 0.).

Monument of Dogs Giov. Pesaro (d. 1659), of a rich baroque archi-
tectural character, occupying the entire wall, with ﬁgures of negroes as
bearers, by Melchior Barthel and Longhena. Mausoleum of Canova (d. 1822),
‘principt sculptorum aetatts mae‘, erected in 1827 from the master‘s own
design for Titian‘s monument, executed by Canova‘s pupils. — By the
entrance-wall, to the right of the principal portal, the tomb of Pietro Ber-
nardo (d. 1538), executed about 1520 by Tuttio Lombardo, with ﬁgures of
Christ, St. Peter, and the deceased: ‘nothing can be more detestable or
mindless in general design, or more beautiful in execution‘ (Ruskin).
Adjacent, in the left aisle (above), the unpretentious monument of Simone
Dandolo (d. 1360), by the Massegne (1396).

In the Nave a high screen of marble, covered with two series of
reliefs and with statues and two pulpits on the front, separates the monks‘
choir from the rest of the church. Elegantly carved stalls, by Karen do
Vicema, 1468, semi-Gothic in style.

The adjacent monastery contains the Archives of Venice, one of
the most magniﬁcent collections of the kind in the world, compris-
ing about 14 million documents , the earliest of which dates from
883. They are deposited in 298 different apartments (open on
week-days, 10—1130 &1.30-3). —— In this neighbourhood is the
Seven n1 SAN GIOVANNI Evanenmsra (P1. E, 4), founded in the
14th cent., but entirely modernized. One side of the handsome
old vestibule in the style of the Lombardi (1481) is still preserved.

Beyond the Archives is the church of San Rocco (P1. D, E, 4, 5),
built in 1490 and restored in 1725, with a facade of 1771 by Macca-
ruzoi. Like the adjacent Scuola di S. Rocco, which we visit in con-
nection with it, it contains numerous pictures by Tintoretto. (These
are all described by Mr. Ruskin in the ‘Venetian Index’ of ‘Stones
of Venice’.)
