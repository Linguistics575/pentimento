Whether the palm be due to Michael Angelo or to Raphael (1.483-
1520) among the artists of Italy is a question which formerly gave
rise to vehement discussion among artists and amateurs. RAPHAEL.
The admirer of Michael Angelo need, however, by no means‘
he precluded from enjoying the works of Raphael. We now know
that it is far more advantageous to form an acquaintance with
each master in his peculiar province, than anxiously to weigh
their respective merits; and the more minutely we examine their _
works, the more ﬁrmly we are persuaded that neither in any way
obstructed the progress of the other, and that a so—called higher
combination of the two styles was impossible. Michael Angelo’s
unique position among his contemporaries was such, that no one,
Raphael not excepted, was entirely exempt from his inﬂuence;
but the result of preceding development was tumed to the best
account, not by him, but by Raphael, whose susceptible and
discriminating character enabled him at once to combine diﬂ’erent
tendencies within himself, and to avoid the faults of his pre—
decessors. Raphael’s pictures are replete with indications of pro-
found sentiment, but his imagination was so constituted that he did
not distort the ideas which he had to embody in order to accommo-
date them to his own views, but rather strove to identify himself
with them, and to reproduce them with the utmost ﬁdelity. In the
case of Raphael, therefore, a knowledge of his works and the en-
joyment of them are almost inseparable, and it is difﬁcult to point
out any single sphere with which he was especially familiar. He
presents to us with equal enthusiasm pictures of the Madonna, and
the myth of Cupid and Psyche; in great cyclic compositions he is
as brilliant as in the limited sphere of portrait—painting; at one
time he appears to attach paramount importance to strictness of
style, architectural arrangement, symmetry of groups, etc. ; at other
times one is tempted to believe that he regarded colour as his most
effective auxiliary. His excellence consists in his rendering equal
Justice to the most varied subjects, and in each case as unhesitat—
ingly pursuing the right course, both in his apprehension of the
idea and selection of form, as if he had never followed any other.

Little is known of Raphael’s private life, nor is it known by
what master he was trained after the death of Giovanni, his father
[1494). In 1500 he entered the studio of Perugino (p. liii), and
probably soon assisted in the execution of some of the works of his
proliﬁc master. 0f Raphael’s early or Umbrian period there are
enmples in the Vatican Gallery (Coronation of Mary) and the Brera
at Milan (Sposalizio of the Madonna, 1504). On settling at Florence
