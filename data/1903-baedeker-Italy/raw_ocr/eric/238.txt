ROOM VII: Venetian School of the 16th century. Lorenzo Lotto,
*Portrait of a lady; *Portraits— of two men.

‘The ﬁne-chiselled features (of the lady), extremely pure in drawing,
Charm by their mild expression. A delicate but healthy com lexion is
displayed in warm sweet tones of extraordinary transparence; an masterly
transitions lead the eye from opal lights into rich and coloured shadows.
A half length in the same collection represents a man of lean and bony
make with a swallow-tailed beard, a grey eye, close set features, and a
grave aspect. . . . A third half length, companion to these, offers another
variety of type and execution. A man stands at a table in a pelisse with
a fox skin collar; he is bare-headed and bearded. His right hand rests
on the table and grips a handkerchief. The ruddy skin of the face is
broken with touches now warm now cold by which the play of light and
reflections is rendered with deceptive truth'. -—- 0. d: C.

ROOM VIII: Venetian Schools of the 15-16th centuries. Carlo
Crivelli, I"Madonna. enthroned; *Madonna enthroned, with four saints
(1482); Cruciﬁxion, with the Madonna and St. John; Coronation
of the Virgin, with a Pieta above it (1493). — Andrea Mantegna,
Large altar-piece, at the t0p the Madonna and St. John weeping
over the dead body of Christ, below St. Luke and other saints,
painted in 1454, and a proof of the early maturity of the artist, then
23 years old; *Madonna in a nimbus of angels’ heads; *Pieta.

‘It is a dpicture 'in which Mantegna‘s grandest style is impressed,
foreshortene with disagreeable boldness, but with sur rising truth,
studied from nature, and imitating light shade, and re action with a
carefulness and perseverance only equalled by Leonardo and Diirer; dis-
playing at the same time an excess of tragic realism, and a painful un-
attractiveness in the faces of the Marys.’ — 0. d: 0‘.
