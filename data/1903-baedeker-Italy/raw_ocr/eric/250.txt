selves to be crowned here with the iron crown, which since the time

ancient pillar at which they took the coronation-oath before being
crowned is still preserved under the lime-trees in the piazza.

the Piazza del Duomo. To the left is the small church of San Satiro

The facade has been restored. The apparent choir is only painted
in perspective. The octagonal *Baptistery (off the right transept)
is also by Bramante, and has a beautiful frieze by Ca-radosso (putti,
and heads in medallions). At the end of the left transept is a curious
little building with a cupola, belonging, like the belfry, to the
original structure; it contains a Pieta, in painted terracotta, by
Caradosso (? covered).
