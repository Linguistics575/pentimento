220 - VENETIA.

used by men of letters, as for example by Goldoni in his comedies, and
is the softest of all the Italian dialects, the ﬂattening and elision of the
consonants being very common. Thus nevode for nipotc, war for sudare
fogs for fuoco, star for signers. Another characteristic is the conversion oi
a into 2, as tents for acute, coma for prior-no, mazore for maygiore. '

The history of the country has always been inﬂuenced by the proﬂmti
of the sea and the peculiar formation of the coast. In the lower part 9f
its course the Po diﬂ‘ers widely in character from all the other rivers in
EurOpe. Its fall is very gradual, being for a considerable distance 21/:
inches only, and latterly little more than 1/, inch per English mile. T0-
w‘ards the end of its course, moreover, it receives its most important
tributaries. The result is that the adjacent districts are much exposed to
inundations, a danger which has to be averted by the construction of huge
dykes; and these works frequently require to be raised, as the bed of the
river is constantly rising. The P0, together with the Tagltamento, License,
Have, Brenta, Adige, and other coast-rivers, terminates in a vast delta which
extends along the whole coast of Venetia. The quantity of alluvial depoeli
is so great, that the coast-district between Tagliamento and Ravenna alone
was increased by about 295 sq. M. in the course of the.19th century. Frem
the same cause the beds of the streams are continually undergoing change
and subdivision. Thus the ancient seaport of Hatria now lies 151/: M. from
the coast, and while the Po formerly ﬂowed towards the 8., it has formed
its present embouchure since 1150. The extensive lagoons (lagune), sep-
arated from the sea by narrow strips of land (lids), and connected with it
by outlets, would render the whole coast uninhabitable in summer, were
it not for the ebb and ﬂow of the tide, which distinguishes the Adriatic from
other parts of the Mediterranean (comp. p. 270), and prevents malarious
exhalations. This extensive alluvial territory, which reminds one of
Holland, called into activity the ingenuity and enterprise of its inhabitant!
at an early period and a temperate and conservative character has thus
been imparted to their history.

The Venétt', a branch of the Illyrian stock, kept entirely alool
from the immigrating Celtic tribes. The seaports of Entries and Spin“:
at the mouths of the Po, carried on a considerable trade at an early
period, and several canals on a lar e scale were constructed as early
as B. C. 380. In the 3rd cent. the eneti, together with the Cenomam,
a Celtic tribe which occupied Brescia and Verona, entered into an
alliance with Rome. While the Romanisation of Lombardy and Pied-
mont was attended with violent struggles, it was rapidly effected here.

as 181 B. ., and the boundary of Italy was thus laid down at the point.
to which it still extends. Owing to its industries, cattle-breeding, and
agriculture, Venetia prospered greatly under the emperors. Padua was'
the wealthiest town in Italy next to Rome, and was rivalled in W. Eu-y
rope by Cadiz alone, as it numbered during the reign of Augustus no
fewer than 500 citizens of knightly fortune (t. e. upwards of about WI
The city was afterwards destroyed by Attila, and a similar fate betel
Autumn, a prosperous commercial town in the Lagoons, and Aquileia,
which in ancient times was of a similar importance to the modern Trieste.
The inhabitants of these coast-towns sought refuge from their conquerors
in the islands of the Lagoons, where they founded Heraclea, Grade (Aquiht'a
Nova), Caorle, Torcello, Burano, Martino Malamocco, Pellestrt'na, ' .
and other places. The Lombards (p. 116) were repulsed with aid on!
the Byzantine emperors; but in the following century the necessity 0 h
closer union for mutual support led to the establishment of a confed is
state. In 697 Pauluc‘t'us Anafestus (d. 716) was elected the ﬁrst Dua- or Dope
of this naval union, while Heraclea was chosen as the seat of government.
In 707, however, the latter was transferred to Halamocco. Removed from
Teutonic inﬂuences, and under the protection of the Byzantine Empire,
the most famous of mediseval states took its rise here from ap arently in-
signiﬁcant beginnings. In 809 the islands repulsed an attack of ing Pepin,
the 30“ 0‘ Charlemagne, but on the capture of Malamocco the inhabitants
were crowded together in the islands of Rtvoalto and Torcdlo.
