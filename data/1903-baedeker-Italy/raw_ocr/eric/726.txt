of Florence. VALLOMBBOSA. 59. Route. 531

the station are the Hdtcl Vallombrosa (burned down in Aug., 1902)
and the Hotel Grace di Savoja; 1/2 M. farther on is the Grand Hdtcl
Costello di Acquabella (pens. 12-15 in).

The carriage-road leads through a dense grove of hrs to (11/4 M.)
Vallombrosa. The road which diverges to the right at the station
and passes the Scoglio dcl Saltino, a projecting rock with a ﬁne view
of the Arno valley, is only a little longer.

The convent of Vallombrosa (3140 ft.), situated in a shaded and
sequestered spot on the N.W. slope of the Pratomagno chain, was
founded in 1016 and suppressed in 1866. The present buildings,
dating from 1637, have been occupied since 1870 by the Realc
Istituto Forestalc, the only advanced school of forestry in Italy.
There are now only three monks here, who celebrate service in the
church, and attend to the meteorological observatory. Hotel: Albergo
della Foresta (the former Foresteria), R. from 31/9, B. 1, luncheon
21/2, D. 4, pension (L. and wine extra) 7-12, in July and August
8-12, omn. from the cable-railway 1/, fr.

The monastery of Vallombrosa was founded by San Giovanni Gualbcrto
(85-1073), the scion of a wealthy and powerful family of Florence, who after
a career of youthful proﬂigacy resolved to devote the remainder of his life
to the most austere acts of penance. His brother Hugo having fallen by
the knife of an assassin, Gualberto was bound by the customs of the age
to follow the bloody law of retaliation. Descending one Good Friday
from the church of Ban liniato near Florence, accompanied by armed fol-
lowers, he suddenly encountered the assassin at a narrow part of the
road. The latter fell at his feet and implored mercy. The knight
forgave his enemy, and led him to Ban Miniato,where he himself assumed
the cowl. Finding the discipline there ton lax, however, he betook himself
to this lonely spot and founded Vallombroaa.

It Paradisino (3336 ft.), a small hermitage situated on a rock
1/4 hr. to the left above the monastery, is now an annexe to the Alb.
della Forests. (see above; rooms not very comfortable). The plat-
form in front commands an admirable l’Survey of the monastic
buildings, and of the broad valley of the Arno as far as Florence, half
of the cathedral-dome of which is visible behind a hill. The horizon
is bounded by the Alpi Apuane (p. 106). -— Another pleasant wall:
may be taken on the road leading from the hotel towards the N.E.
along the mountain-slopes to (21/4 M.) Logo, which is to be con-
tinned to the Consume Pass (p. 632).

The ascent of the Becchieta (4755 ft.) the'N. summit of the Halo-
magno Chain, from Vallombrosa occupies 1112-2 hrs. (guide not indispensable
for experts). The path diverges to the right, a little before we reach the
Paradisino (see above) and ascends to the S.E. mostly through dense pine
forest and afterwards over pastures, passing the so-called Romiton'o della
Hacinqja, to the crest of the ridge, which it reaches at a narrow depres-
sion. Hence we ascend to the left to (25 min.) the Tabernacolo at Don
Ps‘cro, an old chapel commanding a splendid ‘View. To the E. lies the
green Casentino Valley, bounded on the N.E. by the lofty Monte Falterona,
where the Arno rises; to the W. the fertile and richly-cultivated valley
of the Arno stretches as far as the dome of the cathedral of Florence,
beyond which the blue Mediterranean is sometimes visible in the extreme
distance. — We may return to Vallombrosa from the chapel by kee ing
to the N.W., viﬁ the Grace Rona; or we may descend to the W. mm
the Romitorio to Saltino direct vii the bare ridge of the Becca ds' Lupe.
