Varenna (P &R; ’Hét. Royal,-
Alb. Vitton‘a, pens. 5-71/2 fr. ; Alb.
Oliecdo) is charmingly situated
on a promontory surrounded by
gardens (Isimbardi, Lelia, Venini,
Kees), at the mouth of the Val
d‘Esino. In the vicinity both road
and railway pass through several
tunnels. . Most of the marble
quarried in the neighbourhood is
cut and polished in the town.

About 3/4, M. to the S. of Va-
renna the Fiume Latte (‘milk
brook’, from its colour) is precip-
itated in several leaps from a
height of 1000 ft., forming an im-
posing cascade in spring, but gen-
erally dried up at other seasons.

The ruins of Torre dt' Vesta beside
the high-lying hamlet of Vezio
(1/9 hr.) command a beautiful view.
— From Varenna a fatiguing foot-
path leads past Regolsdo (p. 160)
and above the Orrtdo dt' Beltane to
(13/; hr.) Beltane (p. 160).

The “lento Grigna (7905 ft.) is a
very ﬁne point. From Varenna a

Alpine chain from the Mtc. Viso
to the Ortler (the lite. Rosa group
particularly ﬁne), and of the plains
of Lombardy to the distant Apen-
nines. We may descend to the W.
