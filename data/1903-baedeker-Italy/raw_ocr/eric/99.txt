Trent (640 ft.), or Trento, Lat. Tridentum, with 21,600 in-
hab., formerly the wealthiest and most important town in Tyrol,
possesses numerous towers, palaces, and broad streets, and presents
an imposing appearance. The pretty groands (Piazza Dante) ad-
joining the station are adorned with a lofty Monument to Dante,
designed by Cesare Zocchi (1896).

The ‘Cathedral, founded in 1048, rebuilt in 1212 et seq., and
restored in 1882-99, is a Romanesque church surmounted by a dome.
The N. portal, as at Botzen, is adorned with a pair of lions. In the
S. transept are frescoes and the marble tomb of the Venetian general
Sanseverino, who was drowned in the Adige in 1487 after his defeat
by the Tridentines at Calliano (see below). —— In the Piazza Grands
(at the cathedral), which is embellished with the tasteful Neptune
Fountain (1769), stands the Palazso Pretoria (now the military head-
quarters), with the old Torre Grande (clock-tower).

Santa Maria Maggiore, begun in 1520, contains a picture (1563),
in the choir, with portraits of the members of the Council of Trent
which assembled here in 1545-63. The handsome organ-loft is in
the Renaissance style.

The Palazeo Municipale, in the Via Larga, to the N. of the cath-
edral, contains the Public Library and the Museum, the latter con-
sisting of collections of natural history specimens, 8. Tyrolese anti-
quities, coins, etc.

On the E. side of the town rises the imposing Castetlo del Buon
Consiglio (adm. 9-11 and 2—4), formerly the seat of the prince-bish0ps
and now a barrack. A ﬁne view is enjoyed from the huge Torre di
Augusto. — A good view of the town is also obtained from the Ca-
