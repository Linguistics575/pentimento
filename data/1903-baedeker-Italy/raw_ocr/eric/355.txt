214 Route 36. GARGNANO. Lago di Garda.

We next pass Fasano (P; hotels, see p. 212), 20 min. to the
N.E. of Gardone di Sotto, and the beautifully situated Villa
Zanardelli. —- Radar-no (P; Hot. San Marco, well spoken oi, B.
11/2-2, pens. 6-7 fr.; H6t.-Pem. Lignet, pens. 6-7 fr.; Pens. Vic-
toria) lies at the base of Mte. Piuocolo (see p. 213), on a promontory
extending far into the lake. In the early middle ages it was the capital
of the Magniﬁca Patria delta Riviera, which was acquired by Venice
in 1426. The Campanile behind the parish-church is the who of a
castle destroyed by the French in 1797. The old church of Sant’
Andrea, altered in the interior, has a Romanesque facade (12th
cent.) and Roman reliefs on the external wall. Steamer to P6-
schiera, see p. 210. Steam—tramway to Sale and Brescia, p. 209.

The following places, Toscolano (Cavallo Bianco), Casino, and
Bogliaco, with a large chateau of Count Belloni of Brescia, are not
steamer - stations. —- Gargnano (P; H6t.-Pem. Gargnano, Geno,
at both R. 11/g-2, pens. 6-7 fr.), an important-looking village amidst
lemon and olive plantations, marks the N. limit of the Riviera.

The mountains now become loftier, recalling the scenery of the
Norwegian fjords. Tignale (B) is the station for Piovere, , Gardola,
and other mountain-villages not visible from the lake, which are
reached also by a mule-track from Gargnano. The steamer than
steers past the steep Monte Castello (2550ft.) to Campione (P), which
lies upon a narrow strip of level ground at the mouth of a brook-
The large cotton-spinnery (cotoniﬁzio) here is worked by electricity.

A pleasant excursion may be made hence to (2hrs.) the Hadoaaa'di
Monte Costello, on the 8. slope of the mountain. Thence we may descend
vii Gardola (see above) to Tignale, or via Rovers to Gar-guano.

Tremosine (1355 ft.), with its little church, situated.high above
the lake, is reached by a zigzag-path from the small-boat station.

In a bay farther on are the white houses of Limone (P; Alb. del
Gallo; Rislorante Belvedere), another lemon and olive producing
village. A few small steamers (torpediniere) are stationed here to
prevent smuggling; the entire N. and of the lake is illumined at
night by their search-lights.

To the N. of Limone we cross the Austrian frontier and soon after
pass the gorge of the Val di Ledro (below, the Ponale Fall); high
above the lake is the Ponale Road (p. 216), running along the vertical
face of the cliff.
