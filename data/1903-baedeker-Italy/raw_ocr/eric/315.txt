Pavia (250 ft. ), with 33,922 inhab., capital of the province of
the same name, the see of a bishop, and the seat of a university,
is situated near the conﬂuence of the Ticino and the Po and is con—
nected with Milan by the Naviglio‘di Pavia (p. 115). Of the nu-
merous towers, which won for it the title of ‘Citta delle Cento Torri’,

and of the churches, which are said to have numbered 165 in the .

14th cent., only a few new remain; but parts of the ancient ram-
parts and bulwarks still attest the ancient importance of the town.

Pavia is the Ticinum of the ancients, subsequently Papia, and was the
capital of the Lombards from 572 to 774. In the middle ages it was the
faithful ally of the German emperors, until it was handed over in 1360,
by Emp. Charles IV., to Galeazzo II. Visconti (p. 111), asimperial vicar. ——
The battle of Pavia, at which Francis I. of France was defeated and taken

prisoner by Lannoy, general of Charles V., took place in the park of the ‘

castle on 24th Feb., 1525.

Leaving the railway-station, we enter the 003.30 CAvoun (Pl.
A, B, 3) through the Porta Cavour (in a wall to the right is the
statue of a Roman magistrate), and following the Via Bossolaro to
the right reach the Piazza del Duomo.

The CATHEDRAL (Pl. B, 3), begun in the early-Renaissance ‘

style by Cristoforo Rocchi in 1488 on the site of two churches of
the Lombard period and continued with the co-operation of Amadeo
and Bramantc, but never completed, is a vast ‘central’ structure
(comp. p. lxiv) with four arms. The facade (1898) and the dome
(300 ft. high) are modern.

In the INTERIOR are altar-pieces by Gianpt‘etn'no (1521; in the original
frame), Bern. Gattt' (Madonna with the rosary, 1531), Gtov. Bait, Graspi,
Daniele Creepi, and Fed. Farufﬁm' (1854). In the crypt is the handsome
marble altar (by Tomm. Orsoh'no, 1653) of St. Syrus (2nd cent.), who, accord-
ing to the legend, was ﬁrst bishop of Pavia.

Adjoining the church to the left rises the massive Torre Maggiore
(256 ft. high), a tower mentioned as early as 1330; the top story
was begun in 1583 by Pellegrino Tibaldi.

We may now proceed to the Conso Vrrronro EMANUELE (P1. B,
1—4), a street intersecting the town in a straight direction from N.
to S., from the Ports di Milano to the Ports Ticinese, and leading to
the Covered Bridge (14th cent. ; a pleasant promenade with pictur—

esque view) over the Ticino. A chapel stands on the bridge, half- .

way across.

SAN MrcnnLn MAeGronn (Pl. 0, 4), to which the third side-
street to the right leads (coming from the bridge), a basilica of the

Lombard period, dates in its present Lombard—Romanesque form,
