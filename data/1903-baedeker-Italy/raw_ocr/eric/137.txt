We next cross the Lys and follow the broad valley, ﬂanked
by ﬁne mountains , to (501/2 M.) the prettily—sitnated Donnaz

of Savoy after a long siege, while in May, 1800, before the battle of
Marengo, it was gallantly defended by 400 Austrians, who kept the
French army in check for a week. The train then crosses the Dora
to (52 M.) Hone-Bard, beautifully situated. On the left opens the
Val di Camporciero, or Champorcher, with its ﬁne rocky peaks (p. 58);

with 1277 inhab. and the old castle of Rocca, belonging to the
former Counts of Challant (built in 1390, refortiﬂed in 1536), lies
picturesquely at the entrance of the Val Chauant, 3/4 M. from the

the Franks and the Longobards, and belonged to the Franconian Empire,
in consequence of which a South French dialect (langue valddtae‘ne) still
predominates in these Italian districts. The village of Bard (below the fort)
is the point of transition from Italian to French.

Above Verrés the valley expands, but soon contracts again. Ex—
tensive vineyards are passed. We cross the Evancon and the Dora.
