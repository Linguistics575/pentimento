whose immediate successors were Pesellino (1422-57), Aleuio Baldorineui
(1427-99), and the brothers Antonio and Piers Pollajuolo (1429-98 and 1443-
ca. 1496). The chief aims of the school were to master the technical
intricacies of the art, to invest each ﬁgure with beauty, to arrange the
groups harmoniously, and to cultivate a faithful portraiture of real life.

a son of Fra Filippo, and Domenico Ghii'landqjo (1449-94). The history of
Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo Buonarroli, and Raphael, the princes of
Italian art, is not permanently associated with Florence, but their residence
in this city exercised a material influence on their respective careers.
Leonardo and Michael Angelo, both Tuscans, may be regarded as belonging
to Florence owing to the completion of their studies there, and it was at
Florence that Raphael supplemented his art education and shook of the
trammels of the Umbrian school. About 1506 the art history of Florence
attained its most glorious period. Leonardo, Michael Angelo, and Raphael
were then engaged here together, and with them were associated Lorena
di Credi (1159-1537), a master closely allied to Leonardo, the fanciful
Piero di Cosimo (1462-1521), Fra Bartolomeo (1475-1517), an intimate friend
of Raphael, and the talented colourist Andrea del Sarto (1487-1531), while
the last two were rivalled by Albertinelli, Franciabigio, and Pontormo.
Ridolfo Ghirlandajo follows the steps of Leonardo and Raphael, at least
in his ortraits. The union of the greatest masters at Rome, effected by
Julius . and Leo X., at length detracted from the reputation of Florence
and, the despotic sway of the Medici tended to check farther development
After the 16th cent. Florence produced no architecture worthy of note;
and the provinces of painting and sculpture, although cultivated with
more success, now proved destitute of depth and independence. Florence
was the chief headquarters of the mannerist imitators of Michael Angelo:
the most eminent of whom were Giorgio Vasari, the well-known biographer
of artists (1511-74), Angelo Bronzino, and Alessandro Allon‘. Among sculp-
tors may be mentioned Bennett-ale Cellini (1500-1572), also eminent as I
goldsmith, and Giovanni da Bologna (1524-1603), properly Jean Bottom.
of Douai, in French Flanders. In the 17th cent_. the principal Florentine
artists were Lodom'co Cardi, surnamed Gigoli (1059-1613), Gristofano Allan
(1577-1621), Francesco Furini (ca. 1600-46), and the insipidly sweet Carlo
Dolci (161686).

Florence was originally situated wholly on the right bank of the
Arno, but it extended at an early period in the middle ages to the
opposite bank also. The walls of the city, which have been almost
entirely removed since 1865, were constructed at the same time as
the cathedral, between 1285 and 1388. The ancient Gangs, however,
nearly all altered or added to in 1529, have been spared. The follow-
in are the most interesting: Poe-ta alla Croce (Pl. 1, 6), erected in

Andrea Pisano (‘2); Perla Romana (P1. A, 7), erected in 1328 by
J acopo Orcagna; and Porto San Miniato (Pl. F, 8). The NEW QUABTBBS
of the town are at the W. end, on the right bank of the Arno, extend-
ing as far as the Cascine (p. 624), and also to the N. and E. of the Ports
San Gallo, and to the E. of the old town. The broad Viali di Circon-
vallazione encircle the town on the right bank under various names
and occupy the site of the old fortiﬁcations. Since 1888 the narrow
