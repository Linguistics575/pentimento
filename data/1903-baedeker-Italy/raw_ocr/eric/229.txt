History. The favourable situation of Milan in the centre of Lombardy,
near the beginning of several of the great Alpine passes, has always secured
for it a high degree of prosperity. Under the Romans, who conquered it
in B. 0. 222, it was one of the largest cities in Italy, but owing to its
re eated destruction hardly a trace of that period has been left (p. 138).
Agei- the decay of the Lombard sovereignty the power of the archbishops
(p. 111) increased enormously, es ecially under Artbsrt (1018-46), against
whom the smaller vessels were orced to form a league, known as the
Motta. At a later date the pe0ple, grouped round the Garroceio, fought
for the ArchbishOps ainst Conrad II. and the noblesse, expelling the
latter from the city in 041. At this time Milan is said to have contained
300,000(?) inhab., and its trade and industry especially the weaving of
woollen goods and the making of arms and objects in gold, had become
very im ortant. The Roman walls had long since become too cramped,
and in 157 an almost circular moat, still preserved in the inner canal
(Naotglt'o), was constructed round the town. Neither this fortiﬁcation,
however, nor the heroic courage of the Milanese could resist the Em.
Frederick Barbaroua, who, with the help of the Ghibelline towns of Lom-
bardy, totally destroyed the city in 11 2, with the exception of a few
churches. The emperor‘s severe rule, however, soon roused the whole of
Lombardy against him; five years later (I167) Milan was-rebuilt by the
allied cities of Brescia Bergamo, Mantua, and Verona, while the battle
of Legnano (p. 165; 117,6) ﬁnally shattered Barbarossa‘s hopes of reoestab-
lishing the empire of Charlemagne (comp. p. 111). .

The Viscona' (p. 111), who became ‘Signori‘ of Milan in 1277 and
furnished several occupants to the archiepiscopal chair, made an end of
the city’s constitutional independence, but contributed to its well-being by
the introduction of the-silk-industry (ca. 1340) and by the wide extension
of their sway. A new outer rampart (the Reform or Redefosso) was con-
structed in this period to protect the suburbs. The drones (14.50-1535)
endeavoured to reconcile the Milanese to their loss of liberty by the bril-
liancy of their court and their patronage of art. .

The wars of the early part of the 16th cent. and the heavy taxes of
the Spanish Period did not prevent the growth of the city, which in 1590
numbered 246,000 inhabitants. In 1527 city-walls were erected on the
site of the outer ramparts, and in 1519 a new series of fortiﬁed and bastioned
walls were begun. In 1714 Milan, with the rest of Lombardy, passed into
the hands of Austria. In 1797 it became the capital of the ‘Gt'salpine Re-
public”, and then (down to 1815) that of the Kingdom of Italy. The bloody
insurrection of the Cheque Giornate (March 17th-22nd, 1848) compelled the
Austrians to evacuate the city, and the patriotic agitations which ensued
were happily ended by the desired union with the new kingdom of Italy
in 1859. No town in Italy has undergone such marked improvement as
Milan since this date.

Art History. The only buildings of the early-Christian and Romance ue’
periods that survived the destruction of 1162 were the churches of an
Lorenzo (the oldest church in Milan), Sant‘ Ambrogio (the quaintest church
in Milan), San Simpliciano, San Sepolcro, San Celso, and Santa Babila.
The Gothic churches are more of decorative than constructive value;
some, like the cathedral, represent a not very successful compromise be-
tween the styles of the N. and of Italy‘, while others follow Venetian
models (the Frari). '

It was not till after 1450 that Filarete (tower-gate of the Castello, Ospe-
tale Maggiore) and Michelouo (Pal. Medici, Gappella Pertinari in -Sant‘
