—- A dining-car is attached to the express train (dé'. 4, D. 5 fr.) and also (as
far as Chiasso) to the afternoon fast train (déJ. 1/2, D. 4 fr.). The night
express has a sleeping-carriage. A table-d‘hﬁte dinner (81/: fr., inelud. wine)
for passengers by the day-train is provided at Goesehenen, where the
traveller should be careful to avoid an involuntary change of carriages,
or even of trains. —- Finest views from Lucerne to Fliielen to the right,
from Fliielen to Goeschenen to the left, from Ariolo to Bellinzona to the
right, and at Lugano and Como to the left. — The "Bteamboat Voyage on
the Lake of Lucerne from Lucerne to Fliielen (21/4-23/4 hrs.) is much
pleasanter than the railway-journey (1-11/2 hr.) and is recommended to
those who are not pressed for time. Comp. Baedeker’s Switzerland.

The ‘St. Gotthard Railway was constructed in 1872-82, at a total cost
of 271 million francs. Its highest point is in the middle of the great tunnel
and is 3787 ft. above the level of the sea. The inclines (maximum gradient
26:10)) have partly been surmounted by large spiral tunnels, of which
there are three on the N. side of the St. Gotthard and four on the 8. In
all the railway has 80 tunnels (with an aggregate length of 29 111.), 83 large
bridges, 32 minor bridges, and 14 viaducts. The great tunnel alone cost
nearly 57 million francs. Lam's Faere, the engineer, died of ap0plexy in
the tunnel on July 19th, 1879.

Lucerne (1437 ft), the capital of the canton of that name , is
beautifully situated at the efﬂux of the Reuse from the Lake of
Luceme. The best view is obtained from the Gittsch (1722 ft.), at
the N.W.‘ end of the town, 1/2 M. from the station (wire-rope rail-
way). The celebrated Lion of Lucerne, designed by Thorvaldsen,
lies 1/4 M. to the N. of the Schweizerhof-Quai. For details, see
Baedeker’s Switzerland. ,

The railway skirts Lucerne in two tunnels and then runs towards
the Kiissnach arm of the Lake of Lucerne. The, view is very ﬁne,
with the Rigi rising in front of us. —-— 12 M. Immensee (1520‘ft.),

bridge, commanding a view of the Maderaner-Thal, to the left, and
of the Reuse-The], to the right, and is then carried through the slope
of the Bristenstock (10,085 ft.) by means of two tunnels, and across
the Reuse by an iron bridge, 256 ft. high. We now follow the left
bank of the picturesque Reuse valley, traverse a tunnel, cross the
Inschialp-Bach and the Zgraggen- That, and skirt the mountain
through three tunnels and over a viaduct. —— Beyond (50 M.) Gart-
Mlten (2300 ft.) the train crosses the Gorneren—Bach and the Hae~
