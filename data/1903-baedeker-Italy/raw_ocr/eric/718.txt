stands the Villa, built about 1480 for Lorenzo il lagniﬁco by Giuliauo
da ﬂangallo in a simple rustic st lo, and still entirely without modern
additions. It is surrounded by a ne old park and commands a beautiful
view of the Tuscan mountains. It is now a royal possession. The chief
room of the 2nd story is adorned with frescoes by Andrea dcl Sarto (1521;
Caesar receiving the tribute of Egypt), Fraaclabigto (Triumph of Cicero),
and Alcss. Allorl (Flamininus in Greece, and Scipio in the house of Byphax,
1580); the subjects are supposed to typify events in the history of the
Medici as narrated by Paolo Giovio. — The loggia has a ﬁne stucco-ceiling.

The electric railway to Sesto (No. 3; p. 434) proceeds ﬁrst to Posts
a Rifrcdt’ (railway-station, see p. 430), with the ancient church of Santa
Stefano in Parts. To the N.E., about 2 M. from Bifredi, at the foot of
the hills, lies the Villa Iedicca in Oareggi. the property of the grand-
dukes down to 1780 (closed at present). The villa, which contains some
frescoes by G. F. Watts, was erected by Michelouo ('3) for the ﬁrst Cosimo
who terminated his brilliant career in 1464 at this house which still
practically retains its original form. This was also once a favourite seat
of the Platonic Academy (a) 443), which met in the noble loggia. Lorenzo
il Magniﬁco grandson of osimo, also died at Careggi (1492), after Savona-
rola had re used him abeolntion because he would not restore her liberty
to Florence. Fine view of the environs, especially from the projecting
passage below the roof.

is the Beale Istltuto dclla Quicte, a girls‘ school, with admirable sculptures
by the Della Robbia(including a terracotta replica of Verrocchio‘s Doubting
Thomas), and paintings by Botticelli(?) and Ghirlandajo. — A few yards
farther on is the Villa Qua-lo, with beautiful gardens, erected for Duke
Cosimo I. by Tribolo, now in the possession of Countess Stroganoﬁ‘.

Brunellescbi in the 14th cent. but remodelled b Buoatalentl in the
Renaissance style in 1676 for the Card. Ferdinando e‘ ledici. It is now
ﬁtted up as a royal residence (permesso at the Pal. Pitti), and is provided
with a curious modern adaptation of a Roman ‘atrium‘. The interior is
adorned with frescoes by Vollcrrano (1638) and contains an unimportant
altar- iece by Andrea dsl Sarto. The delightful gardens contain a fine
oak, years old, with a platform among its branches which used to be
a favourite resort of Victor Emmanuel II. — Immediately to the W. lies
