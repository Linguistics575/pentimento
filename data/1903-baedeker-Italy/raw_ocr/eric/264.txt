to Como. MONZA. 20. Route. 147

Via Italia to the right, we pass the church of Santa Maria in Istrada
gsecond on the right), with a Gothic brick facade of 1393, and in
0 min. reach the Piazza Roma, the centre of the town, with the
handsome Gothic Municipio or town—hall, also called Pataszo
Arengan‘o (13th cent.). —— A few paces distant is the Piazza del
Duomo, in which rises the — ,

CATHEDRAL (San Giovanni), the chief object of interest. It was
erected in the 14th cent. in the Lombard Gothic style by Matteo do
Campionc on the site of a church founded in 590 by the Lombard
queen Theodolinda and afterwards replaced by a Romanesque
structure. The interior, with both aisles ﬂanked by chapels, has
been almost entirely modernized since the 17th century. The ﬁne
facade was restored in 1899-1901. Above the portal is a very
curious relief representing Queen Theodolinda amid her treasures;

below, the Baptism of Christ.

Iumnron. In the E. transept is a relief representing the coronation
0f a German king, from the former imperial gallery of 1!. da Campinas
(now the organ-loft). — The chapel to the left of the choir, restored in
1890, contains the plain sarcOphagus of Queen Theodolinda (14th cent.)
and frescoes of scenes from her life by Zarattam' (1444). Here also is
preserved the celebrated Inon CROWN, supposed to have been the royal
crown'of the Lombards, with Which the German emperors were crowned
as kings of Italy, from the 13th cent. onwards. This venerable relic was
used at the coronation of the Emp. Charles V. in 1530, of Napoleon at
[ﬂan in 1805, and of Emp. Ferdinand I. in 1838. It consists of a broad
PM of gold adorned with precious stones, round the interior of which
15: thin strip of iron, said to have been made from a nail of the true
'Cross brought by the Empress Helena from Palestine. In its present form
u is, perhaps, a work of the 12th centu . In 1859 it was carried off by
the Austrians, but after the peace of 1 it was restored. (Fee for seeing
the crown and treasury, 5 fr.) —— The *Tnnasunr (fee 1 fr.) contains several
objects of historical interest: a hen with seven chickens in silver-gilt
(On a modern copper base), perhaps representing Lombardy and its seven
PPDVinces, executed by order of Queen Theodolinda; the queen‘s crown,
fan, and comb; a richly-adorned book-cover with an inscription of Theo-
dolinda; ﬁne diptychs of the 4-6th cent.; reliquary of Berengarius; goblet
of sapphire, with a stem of Gothic. workmanship; Gothic goblet of Gian
Galeazzo Visoonti; Gothic carvings in ivory. -— In a wall-recess of the old
cemetery, on the N. side of the cathedral, is the mummy of Ettore Visconti
(d. 1413), shown by the verger. ‘

In the Via Matteo da Campione, in the N .W. part of the town,

assassinated, on July 29th, 1900.
