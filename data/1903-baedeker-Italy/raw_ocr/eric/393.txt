244 Route 39. VIOENZA. From Verona

Duomo (Pl. B, 3), consisting of a broad and low Gothic nave
with wide vaulted arches, side—chapels in place of aisles, a Renais—
sance choir, much raised, and dams, and a crypt of the 18th century.
In the 4th chapel to the left are frescoes and a Madonna with saints
by Bart. Montagma, in an old frame; in the 5th to the right is a
Death of the Virgin by Lor. Veneziano (1366). —— To the right in
the piazza is the Vescovado, or episcOpal palace, -with a facade of
1819; the court to the right contains an elegant little early-Renais-
sance arcade by Tomm. Fromentone (1494). The piazza is em-
bellished with a Status of Victor Emmanuel 1]., by Benvenuti,
erected in 1880. '

We continue to follow the Corso. 0n the left is the Gothic
Palazzo Thienc, and farther on, beyond the Contrada Pozzo Rosso
(p. 246), is the Pal. Braschi (usually known as the Casino Vecchio),
two Gothic ediﬁces of the 15th century. On the right, beyond the
Contrada Cavour, is the handsome Pala-zzo Porto (formerly Pal. Tris-
sino-Baaton), by Scamozzi (1588-1662).

The Contrada Cavour leads to the handsome PIAZZA Dn’ SIGNonI,
with two columns of the Venetian period. Here rises the I”Basilica
Palladiana (Pl. 0, 2, 3), with its grand colonnades in two stories,
the lower Doric, the upper Ionic, surrounding the Palazzo della
Ragionc (town—hall), an earlier building in the pointed style. These
colonnades, begun in 1549 but not ﬁnished until 1614, are one of
Palladio’s earliest works. 0n the ﬁrst ﬂoor is a large ball with a
ﬁnely vaulted wooden roof (not always open). The slender red brick
tower is 265 ft. in height. Adjacent, at the corner of the Piazza
della Biava, is the Tribunals. — Opposite the Basilica is the un-
ﬁnished Loggia del Capitam‘o (p. 250), also by Palladio (1571), over-
laden with plastic embellishments; it now belongs to the Municipio.
Adjoining it on the right is the Monte di PietZz, erected in 1704 for
the Biblioleoa Bertoliana, by Ant. Muttoni. -— By the Basilica rises
a Status of Palladio in marble, by Gajassi (1859).

We return to the Corso, in which, to the left, beyond the Con-
trada Giacomo Zanella (p. 245), are the Pal. Da Schio (Gothic, with
early-Renaissance portal) and, at the end of the Corso, the Casa di
Palladio, the facade of which was once painted (1566). We next
reach, on the right, in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, the —

Huseo Civioo (Pl. 0, 2), established in the Pal. Chiericati, one
of Palladio’s ﬁnest ediﬁces, seriously injured in 1848, but restored
in 1855 (open daily 11-2, free; 9-11 and ‘2—4, fee 1/2-1 fr.).
