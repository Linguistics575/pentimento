of the Canal Grande, erected in 1631-56 by Longhena, in commem-
oration of the plague in 1630. ‘Considering the age in which it
was erected, it is singularly pure’, though ‘externally it is open to
the criticism of being rather too overloaded with decoration’ (Fer-
gusson). The octagonal interior, with an ambulatory all round, is
very handsome.
