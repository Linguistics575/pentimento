xlii ITALIAN ART.

The word Renaissance is commonly understood to designate a
REM“. revival of the antique; but while ancient art now began to
sanon inﬂuence artistic taste more powerfully, and its study to be
CULTUH- more zealously prosecuted , the essential character of the
Renaissance consists by no means exclusively, or even principally,
in the imitation of the antique; nor must the term be conﬁned
merely to art, as it truly embraces the whole progress of civili-
sation in Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries. How the
Renaissance manifested itself in political life, and the diﬁ'erent
phases it assumes in the scientiﬁc and the social world, cannot
here be discussed. It may, however, be observed that the Be-
naissance in social life was chieﬂy promoted by the ‘humanists’,
who preferred general culture to great professional attainments,
who enthusiastically regarded classical antiquity as the golden
age of great men , and who exercised the most extensive in-
ﬂuence on the bias of artistic views. In the period of the Re-
naissance the position of the artist with regard to his work , and
the nature and aspect of the latter are changed. The education and
taste of the individual leave a more marked impress on the work of
the author than was ever before the case; his creations are pro-emin—
ently the reﬂection of his intellect; his alone is the responsibility,
his the reward of success or the mortiﬁcation of failure. Artists
now seek to attain celebrity, they desire their works to be examined
and judged as testimonials of their personal endowments. Mere
technical skill by no means satisﬁes them, although they are far
from despising the drudgery of a handicraft (many of the most emin-
ent quattrocentists having received the rudiments of their education
in the workshop of a goldsmith); the exclusive pursuit of a single
sphere of art is regarded by them as an indication of intellectual
poverty, although they aim at mastering the technique of every
branch. They work simultaneously as painters and sculptors , and
when they devote themselves to architecture, it is deemed nothing
unwonted or anomalous. A comprehensive and versatile education,
united with reﬁned personal sentiments, forms their loftiest aim. This
they attain in but few instances, but that they eagerly aspired to it
is proved by the biography of the illustrious Lnon Barrrs'ra Annular
(1404—72), who is entitled to the same rank in the 15th century as
Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th. Rationally educated, physically and
morally healthy , keenly alive to the calm enjoyments of life, and
possessing clearly deﬁned ideas and decided tastes, the Renaissance
artists necessarily regarded nature and her artistic embodiment
with diiferent views from their predecessors. A fresh and ,joyous love
of nature seems to pervade the whole of this period. She not only
afforded an unbounded ﬁeld to the scientiﬁc, but artists also strove
to approach her at ﬁrst by a careful study of her various phenom-
ena. Anatomy, geometry, perspective, and the study of drapery
and colour are zealously pursued and practically applied. External
