in front of the Palazzo Vecchio (p. 446).

‘No plastic work of Michael Angelo earned such a harvest of laudation
among his contemporaries as the ‘David‘. Vasari sings the praises of the
miracle-worker, who raised the dead, spoiled block to new life, and
assures us that Michael Angelo‘s David is vastly superior to all ancient and
modern statues whatever. The boldness and assured touch of the great
sculptor certainly awake our admiring astonishment. Not only the sub-
ject was prescribed to him, but also its size and preportions, added to
which he was conﬁned to the narrowest limits for the development of the
attitude and motion. Yet this constraint is not perceptible, and the history
of the statue could by no means he divined from its appearance. Out
wardly the demeanour of the young hero is composed and quiet; but
each limb is animated by a common impulse from within and the whole
.body is braced up for one action. The raised left arm holds the sling in
readiness, the right hand hanging at his side holds the handle of the
sling; next instant he will make the attack‘. — Springer.
