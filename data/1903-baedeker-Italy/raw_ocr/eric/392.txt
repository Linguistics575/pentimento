Vicenza (106 ft.), the ancient Vicetia, capital of a province and
see of a bishOp, with 43,703 inhab., lies at the N. base of the Monti
Berici (p. 242), on both sides of the Bacchiglione, at its con-
ﬂuence with the Retrone. Although closely built, the town possesses
many interesting palaces, to which, with the picturesque environs,

a short visit may proﬁtably be devoted.

Vicenza, like most of the larger towns of N. Italy, boasted in the 15th
cent. of a Sonoor. or Pamrmo, which, though it was strongly inﬂuenced
by Mantegna (born here in 1431, but active in Padua and Mantua alone),
and never produced masters of the highest rank, yielded results of consider-
, able importance. The earliest mastu of note was Giovanni eranza, who,
however, was soon surpassed by Bartolomeo Montagna (ca. 1 4523). The
gallery and the churches (Cathedral, Santa Corona) of Vicenza contain
" works by the latter. His compositions are strongly realistic, and he shows
a predilection for muscular ﬁgures, and for colouring of a rich brownish
tint. His drapery is ungraceful, but, like that of Diirer, boldly deﬁned.
' His son, Benedetto Montagna, was unimportant, but his contemporary Gio-
vanni Buonconsz‘glio, surnamed Marescalco. (d. 1530), resembling the Ven-
.etians both in conception and colouring, ranks as the second master of
, note. His chief works are the Pieta in the Museum (p. 245), and the
.Iadonna at San Rocco (p. 246). In the 16th cent. Vicenza lost its im-
- portance as a school of painting, but attained a high reputation in the
province of Ancmrscruns, having given birth to Andrea Palladio (1518-80),
the last great architect of the Renaissance, the chief sphere of whose
operations was his native town. By his study of the antique in Rome he
was enabled to effect a revival of what may be termed the ancient language
of forms, and he made it his endeavour to exhibit in his buildings the
organic connection between the different members. The chief character-
istic of his school consists in a studious adherence to impressive simmicity
of form, and a very sparing indulgence in the lavish enrichments in which
the early-Renaissance was too apt to revel. His ﬁnest churches are at
Venice (comp. p. 267), but his most numerous palaces are at Vicenza, to
which they impart a uniform and handsome appearance.

We enter the town by the W. gate, Porto del Costello (P1. B, 3).
Immediately to the right, on the S. side of the narrow Piazza del
Castello, is the Palazzo Giulio Porto, formerly called Casa del Dia'oolo,
a large unﬁnished palace by Palladio, with two stories united by a
row of Corinthian columns with a rich cornice. To the left rises a
monument to Garibaldi by Ferrari, erected in 1887.

Near the status, at the beginning of the 00380 ancrrn UM-
Bnn'ro, which intersects the entire town, lies the Palaazo Benin,
by Vino. Scamozzi. 0n the right, Opposite the church of San Filippo
Nari (P1. B, 3; 1719), stands the Palazzo Loschi ( 18th cent.) ——
