In the Non-m or Iranr the following are the best wines: the care-

In LIGURIA the local wines of the Val Polcavera (best Coronata) and the
Cirque Terra share the popularity of the Piedmontese and Tuscan vintages.

In Tuscan! the best wines (almost all red) are: Chianti (best Broglio),
Rufma (best Pomino), Nipozzdno, Altomeaa, and Carmtgmano, and Aleatico
(sweet). Ordeto and Montepulciano are produced farther to the south. —
In Tuscany the Ordinary table-wine, which is met which all over N. Italy
under the name ‘Chianti‘, is generally served in a ‘ﬂasco‘, or straw-covered
ﬂask holding three ordinary bottles, but only the quantity consumed is paid
for. Smaller bottles may be obtained: mezzo ﬁasco (1/2), quarto ﬁasco (1/4),
ﬂaschctto or ~ottavt'no (1/3).

Like the trattorie with ‘Cucina alla casalmga’ (‘homely fare’),
the OSTBBIE, or ordinary wine-shoPs, are almost exclusively fre-
quented by the lower ranks. The prices are often inscribed on the
outside of the shop (‘6’, ‘7’, ‘8’, meaning that half a litre costs 6,
7, or 8 soldi). Some of the better wine-rooms (B‘iaschetterie) selling
Tuscan wines provide also very tolerable meals.

Cafes are frequented for breakfast and luncheon, and in the
evening by numerous consumers of ices, coffee, beer, vermouth (usu-
ally with Seltzer water), etc. The tobacco smoke is often very dense.

Cafe acre, or cod‘ee without milk, is usually drunk (15-25 e. per cup).
Cafe latte is coffee mixed with milk before served (25-50 c.- ‘cappuccs‘no‘,
or small cup, cheaper). Chocolate (cioccolata) costs 25-50 c. flail (pane) 5,
with butter (parts at barre) 20 c. cakes or biscuits (paste) 5-16 0.

Ices (gelato) of every possible variety are supplied at the cafes at -
50—90 0. per portion; or half a portion (mezzo) may be ordered. Sorbctto,
or half-frozen ice, is much in vogne'in the forenoon. Granita is water-
ice (limonata, lemon; aranciata, orange; di cafe, coffee). Ghiacct'ate and
spremuto, lemonade ﬂavoured with 'fruitsyrup, may be rcommended to
ladies. Gassosa, aerated lemonade, is also frequently ordered. The waiters
eXpect a sou-or more, according to the amount of the payment.

The principal Parisian and Viennese newspapers (giomah’) are to be
found at all the larger cafes, English less often. Italian papers (5-10 0.)
are everywhere otfered by newsvendors. The Corricra delta Hera (p.114)
give: most of the foreign despatches.

Birrerio, corresponding to the French ‘Brasseries’, are now found
in all the larger towns and chief resorts of visitors. Munich, Pilsen,
or Gratz beer may generally be procured at these. A small glass
(piccola taste) costs 30—40 c., alarge glass (generally holding an
mezzo tits-o) 50-60 c. Luncheon may usually be obtained at these.

Cigars (Sigiiri) in Italy are a monopoly of Government, and
usually bad: Conchas and Trabucos, 20 c., Minghettis, 15 c., Grimaldis,
10 c., Virginias, 71/2: 1‘2, or 15 c., Toscani, Napoletam’, Cavours,
“lg-10 c., etc. Good imported cigars may be bought at the better
shops in the large tons for 25-60 c. each, and also foreign cigarettes.
-— Travellers who import their own cigars, paying the heavy duty,
should keep the customs receipt, as they are liable to be challenged,
