Via Aurelia), which ends on the W.- at the Borghetto brook. This
ﬁne street aﬂ'ords charming views of the palm-gardens of the H6tel
Angst and the Villa Etelinda (built by Garnier). On its S. side, below
the Hotel de Londres, is the New Museum, or International Free
- Library, founded by Mr. Bicknell and containing a reading-room,
aconcert-hall, a small library, a unique collection of the ﬂora of
the Riviera, a collection of minerals, and an archaeological collection
(including fragments and casts of the rock-inscriptions mentioned
at p. 46). — A magniﬁcent I"View is obtained from the Spicnata
del Capo, on the top of the promontory, at the E. end of the road:
to the left, the bay of Ospedaletti ; to the right, Ventimiglia, Mentone,
Gap Martin, Monaco, the Monts Esterel, and the snow-ﬂeckedAlpes
Maritimes.

Bordighera is famous for its ﬂoriculture (roses, carnations, ane-
mones, etc.), which partly supplants olive-growing, and for its
date-palms (Phoenix dactylifera), of which, however, the fruit seldom
ripens sufﬁciently to be edible. Like Iles d’Hyere and Elche (see
Baedeker’s Spain) Bordighera does a large business in supplying
palm-branches to Roman Catholic churches for Palm Sunday and
to Jewish communities for the Feast of Tabernacles. For the former
purpose the leaves are bleached on the trees by being tightly bound
up. — The ﬁnest palms are seen in the above-named gardens, in
that of the Villa Gamier (to the E. of the town), at Herr Winter’s

Vallone Garden, 3/, M. to the E., near the Sasso bridge, and in the
‘Madonna Garden at Ruota, 3/4 M. beyond the bridge, belonging
to the same owner and containing the celebrated Scheﬂ‘el Palms
(Open at all hours). .

From the Vallone Garden we may ascend the Valley of the Sasso
{in dry weather) to the (21/2 M.) Aqueduct and return thence to
(1 M.) Bordighera along the conduit. — Another pleasant walk is
afforded by the Strada dei Colli, to the N. of the old town. At
the end of the road, immediately beyond the Villa Biancheri, a
footpath leads to the left to the Torre dei Mostaccint, a good view-
point (key kept by Avvocato Cabagni, Via Vittorio Emanuele).

Grace (1060 it; there and back 2-3 hrs.) is highly attractive. Crossing
the Borghetto at the W. end of the Strada Romans, we proceed past the
Chapel of the Madonna di Loreto to the valley of Vallecrosia; a foot ath
0n the opposite side of the ‘valley ascends to the N. over the ridge ( ima

mad; on the left are scanty remains of the Roman theatre of Nervia.
