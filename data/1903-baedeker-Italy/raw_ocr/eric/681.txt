of a pompous progress into one long series filling the walls of the body
of the building. The kings, in gorgeous state, are accompanied on their
march by knights and pages in sumptuous dresses, by hunters and followers
of all kinds, and the spectator glances by turns at the forms of crowned
kings, of squires, and attendants with hunting le0pards, all winding their
