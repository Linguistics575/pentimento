472 Route; 58. FLORENCE.

c. From the Piazza della Signoria to Santa Croce and the Piazza
d’Azeglio. National Museum.

Quitting the Piazza della Signoria (p. 445), we follow the Via
de’ Gondi to the right, which leads us to the PIAZZA SAN anst
(Pl. F, 5), with the church of that name. No. 1, on the W. side
of this Piazza, is the Palaaso Gondi, begun about 1490 by Giuliano
da Sangallo, and remodelled in 1874 by Poggi, with a rustica facade
tapering towards the top and a handsome court. In one of the rooms
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor is a marble chimney-piece, with a relief by G. da
Sangallo.

Immediately on the right in the VIA n31. Pnoconsono (Pl. F, 5 ,
which leads hence to the N. to the Piazza del Duomo, rises (No. )
the Palazzo dcl Podcsla, commonly known as l"II Bargello (P1. F, 5),
begun in 1255 for the Capitano del Pepolo (p. 440), and from 1261 (‘3)
the residence of the Podcsta, or chief magistrate of Florence. The
building was repeatedly damaged by riots, ﬁre (1332), and water
(1333) during the 14th century. From 1574 it served as a prison and
seat of the head of the police (Bargello). The oldest part of the
building, towards the Via Proconsolo, is of ashlar, the upper story
(added after 1332) and the extension towards the E. are of rough,
unhewn stone. Between 1857 and 1865 the imposing structure
was judiciously restored by Franc. Mazsci and ﬁtted up for the
”National Museum (Marco Nazionalc), illustrative of the medieval
and modern history of Italian culture and art. It contains several
admirable Renaissance bronzes and marbles (comp. p. l). Admis—
sion, see p. 437; catalogue (1898) by the curator I. B. Supino, 3 fr.
The more important works are labelled with the masters’ names and
short explanations.

The two front rooms of the GROUND FLOOR contain a valuable
collection of weapons, comprising many pieces of great worth and
beauty formerly in the possession of the Medici. In the MAIN R0011,
to the right, an interesting monster cannon in bronze, cast in 1638
by Cosimo Cami ; in the middle cabinet at the S. end of the room,
wheel-lock muskets inlaid with ivory; in the last cabinet on the left,
helmet and shield by Gasparo Mala (17th cent). The adjoining
room in the tower contains armour and a Turkish saddle.

We then enter the picturesque ‘COUM‘, embellished with the
armorial bearings of former Podesths, and forming with its massive
colonnades and ﬁne ﬂight of steps (built in 1345-67) a digniﬁed
and eloquent picture of the spirit of the 14th century. The walls
under the colonnades are painted with the armorial bearings of the
different quarters of the town. On the N. side: 3. Niccolo d’Arcuo,
St. Luke (1401); 5. Piero di Giovanni Tedcsco, St. John (two statues
