xlvi ITALIAN ART.

Italy in particular are worthy of examination. The ﬁrst early Re-
naissance work constructed in this part of the country was thefacadc
of the Certosa ofPavia, a superb example of decorative architecture.
Besides the marble ediﬁces of this period we also observe structures
in brick, in which the vaulting and pillars form prominent features.
The favourite form was either circular or that of the Greek cross
(with equal arms), the ediﬁce being usually crowned with a dome,
and displaying in its interior an exuberant taste for lavish enrich—
ment. Of this type are the church of the Madonna dclla Croce near
Orema and several others at Piacenza and Farm (Madonna della
Steccata). It was in this region that Bnam'rn prosecuted the studies
of which Rome afterwards reaped the beneﬁt. Among the secular
buildings of N. Italy we may mention the Ospcdalc Maggiore at
Milan, which shows the transition from Gothic to Renaissance. The
best survey of the palatial ediﬁces built of brick will be obtained
by walking through the streets of Bologna (p. 362).

The visitor to Venice will have an opportunity of tracing within
a very limited space the progress of Renaissance architecture. The
church of San Zaccaria is an example of early Renaissance still in
conﬂict with Gothic, while the richly coloured church of Santa Maria
dei Miracoli and the Scuola di San Marco exhibit the style in its
perfection. Foremost among the architects of Venice must be
mentioned the Lombardi, to whom most of the Venetian buildings
of the 15th cent. are attributed; but we shall afterwards advert to
the farther progress of Venetian architecture (p. xlviii). One of the
most famous architects of N. Italy was Fna Grooonno of Verona
(1435—1515), a monk, a philologist (the discoverer of the letters
of the younger Pliny), a botanist, an engineer, and a thoroughly
well trained architect, who at a very advanced age, after the death
of Bramante, was summoned to Rome to superintend the building
of St. Peter’s.

Examples of early Renaissance architecture abound in the towns
of Tuscany. At Florence, the scene of FILIPPO Bnmnnnscm’s
labours (1379-1446), the attention is chieﬂy arrested by the church
of San Lorenzo (1425), with its two sacristies (the earlier, after
1421, by Brunelleschi, the later by Michael Angelo, which it is
interesting to compare), while the small Cappclla dci Pazai near
Santa Croce is also noticeable. The Palazzo Rucellai is also import-
ant as showing the combination of pilasters with ‘rustica’ , ‘the
greatest advance achieved by the early Renaissance. Sicna, with its
numerous palaces, Pienza, the model of a Renaissance town, and
Urbino also afford excellent examples of the art of the ‘Quattrocen-
tists, but are beyond the limits of the present volume. While all
these diﬁerent ediﬁces possess many features in common, they may
be classed in a number of groups, diiiering in material and various
other characteristics, and entirely relieving them from any reproach
of monotony. .
