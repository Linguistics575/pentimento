The Bagnidi Lucca (season, May 1st to Sept. 15th), which were known
as early as the 10th cent. under the name of the ‘Baths of Corsena‘, with
sp varying in temperature from 98° to 130° Fahr., consist of several
ditYerent villages in the valley of the Lima. They are much frequented
by English and American visitors. Ponte a Berraglio (ca. 410 ft.), the
chief of these villages. is picturesqnely situated on the bend of the rivalet.
Here are ‘Pag‘nr'ni‘s Ham d‘Europs ct d‘Amét-ique, ‘Psra‘s Halal New York,
and the Grand Hatel des Batns ds Lacquer, with little difference in their
charges (cheaper in Sept); the Cafes Pasta and Italta, in the Piazza del
Ponte; the best Baths}- a Casino, with billiard and ball,rooms; and the Post
Ofﬁce. Good furnished apartments, carriages, and donkeys may be had,
but the shops are poor. Physician, Dr. Marchi. -— Adjoini the Hotel

Beautiful avenues ascend ually from Ponte a Serraglio to (1 hi.) Villa
(ca. 490a, ‘Hdt. Vittoria,- ‘ 0t. du Parc, pens. 6-8 in; Heat Omtinental;

reading and ball-rooms, concerts, etc.), and to (’Is M.) Bagni Caldi (‘Grand
Ham dos Therm, formerly the chateau of the Grand—Duke of Tuscany,
pens. 6-8 fr.). The mud-baths of Bagni Caldi are efﬁcacious in rheumatism
and gout; and there is a grotto with a natural vapour bath. The freedom
from dust, glare, and excessive heat makes this a delightful summer-resort.

after an inhabitant of Pistoja cured here in the 16th cent), Docce Barre,
and San Giovanni.
