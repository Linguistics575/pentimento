from the latter part of the 11th century. The facade is adorned
with numerous reliefs in sandstone, in ribbon-like stripes, and
a curious gabled gallery.

The vaulted Isrnaron restored in 1860-75, is supported by eight
pillars, from which rise double round arches. Over the centre of the
transept rises an octagonal dome. The pillars of the nave bear traces of
ancient frescoes. The tomb of Mart. Salimbene, in the crypt, is attributed
to Gian. Ant. Amadeo (1491).

Near the middle of the Corso Vitt. Emanuele is the Mercato
Coperto (Pl. B, 3), built by Balossi in 1881—82. Behind it, in the
Piazza del Popolo, is a monument, by Enrico Cassi (1900), to the
Cairdli Family of Pavia: Adelaide Cairoli entrusts a banner to her
ﬁve sons, illustrious in the war of independence; in front, to the
left, is Benedetto Cairoli (1825-89), the statesman.

In the N. part of the Corso Vitt. Emanuele, to the right, stands
the UNIVERSITY (Pl. B, G, 2, 3), founded by Galeazzo II. Visconti
in 1361 on the site of a school of law, which had existed here since
the 11th century. The present imposing building, begun in 1490
under Lodovico i1 Moro, was greatly extended about 1770 by Gius.
Piermarini. The handsome quadrangles are embellished with mem-
orial tablets, busts, and monuments of celebrated professors and
students. In the second court are a statue of Volta, by Ant. Tan-
tardim’ (1878), and memorial reliefs of professors. In the library
(ca. 200,000 vols.) are preserved some of the ashes of Columbus

containing a handsome court of the 14th cent. (adm. by permission
of the ofﬁcer on guard). '

Lombard-Romanesque style, was restored in 1876-99 by Any. Sa-
voldi. The exterior of the choir should be noticed.

In'rrcmon. In the high choir is the sumptuous *Arca dr' Sant‘Agostt‘no,
adorned with 95 statuettes and 50 reliefs executed by Bonino da Campione
or some other of the Campt'onest' after 1362. On the sarcophagus is the
recumbent ﬁgure of St. Augustine, whose relics were brought from Bar-
