Pal. of the Doges. VENICE. 42. Route. 277

Lion of St. Mark and the kneeling ﬁgure of Doge Franc. Foscari,
above the portal, is modern (comp. p. 281).

The magniﬁcent I“Comm was begun about 1483 by Ant. Risso,
continued in 1499-1511 by Pietro Lombardoand in 1545-50 by Ant.
Searpagnino, but only partly completed. The ﬂorid facade on the E.
side is probably by Rizzo. The little ‘Facade adjoining St. Mark’s
at the N.E. corner, attributed to Gugl. Bergamasco (1520), is less
gorgeous, but more happily pr0portioned. Within one of the highest
windows to the left of the main facade was the prison of the poet
Count Silvio Pellico in 1822, before he was removed to the Spiel-
berg at Briinn (comp. p. 43). In the centre of the court are two
Well Heads in bronze, of 1556 and 1559. On the facade of the
Clock Tower, to the right, is a statue of the Venetian general Duke
Francis Maria I. of Urbino (d. 1538) by the Florentine sculptor
G. Bandini. The other statues are antique, but freely restored.

The richly ornamented Scala dci Giganti, the ﬂight of steps leading
to the palace, derives its name from the colossal statues of Mars and
Neptune at the top, by Sansooino (1554). On the highest landing of
these steps, in the later period of the Republic, the doges were
crowned. Opposite are beautiful statues of I"Adam and Eve, by
Antonio Rizzo (1464).

The *IN'rnnIon (admission, see p. 265; office on the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
to the right) is another prominent specimen of Venetian art,
although it was robbed of many treasures by the French in 1797.
While the earliest native painters devoted their energies to the
church of St. Mark, the great masters of the 15th and 16th cent.
were chieﬂy engaged in the Palace of the Doges. As, however,
their works were destroyed by the great ﬁre of 1577, the palace
now forms a museum of later masters only, such asTintoretto,
Paolo Veroncsc, and Palma G‘iovanc, but it still presents a most
brilliant display of Venetian painting, so far as executed for behoof
of the state. The excellent condition of the paintings is note-
worthy; the gorgeous colouring of P. Veroncsc is nowhere better
illustrated. Lists of the pictures are placed in the principal rooms
(except on Sun. and holidays; printed description 50 0.).

We ascend the Scala clei Giganti. Around the upper colonnade
are modern busts of Venetian scholars, artists, and doges, and a
few antiques from the Archaeological Museum (p. 281; Dionysus
and a satyr, Apollo resting, two Muses). Tickets of admission are
sold opposite the staircase (see p. 265). To the right is the richly
decorated Scale d’Oro of Sansovino, completed in 1577 , once
accessible to those only whose names were entered as ‘Nobili’ in
the Golden Book. The stucco-work is by Al. Vittoria, the paintings
by G. B. Franco. By this staircase we ascend on week-days direct
to the upper story. —- The next staircase, the Scala dci Consort, is
the entrance on Sundays and festivals (p. 279).

The UPPER FLoon contains the apartments in which the author-
