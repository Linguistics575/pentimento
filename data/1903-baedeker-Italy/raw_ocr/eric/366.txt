VERONA. 37. Bouts. 221

Rivoalto, the most secure of all the islands, was selected in 811 as

the seat of government, and here accordingly the city of Venice was founded.
Ammo Portsctpottus is said to have been the ﬁrst doge whose residence
occupied the site of the present Palace of the Doges. Situated between
the Byzantine and Franconian empires , Venice became a connecting link
between the trade of each and the great depot of the trafﬁc between the
East and the West. In 8% a Venetian ﬂeet brought the body of St. Mark
to Venice, and thenceforth the Venetians revered him as their tutelary
saint, using his emblem, the lion (Rev. iv. 7), as their cagnisance, and his
name as synonymous with the republic while their supreme ofﬁcial func-
tionaries were styled ‘Procurators of St. Mark‘. In the interests of her
commerce Venice was at length induced to make foreign conquests. These
were at ﬁrst conﬁned to the Istrian and Dalmatian coasts for the purpose
of procuring timber and suppressing piracy. The rivalry that s rang up with
Genoa during the Crusades led the Venetians to effect a footing n the Levant,
and to establish extensive colonies. At the same time the constitution of the
state develo d into a rigorous oligarchy, which with terrible impartial-
ity contrive to keep both the nobility and peeple in check, and eﬁ‘ectu-
ally to curb the national desire for liberty. In the neighbouring towns
the supreme power rested on a foundation altogether diti‘erent‘. The re-
publics had been overthrown by the despots, who, supported by mercen-
ary troops and the favour of the lower classes, had founded principali-
ties in the modern sense of the word. Such were the Visconti in Milan,
the Scali ers in Verona, the Carrara in Poduo, the Gonzaga in Hontuo,
and the ate in Ferraro. The danger of collision with warlike princes,
and the support they aﬁorded to every attempt to overthrow the Venetian
constitution, led to their own downfall. Venice, having made conquests
on the mainland (tsrro forum) for the sake of her own safety , soon he‘
come one of the chief Italian powers, and was thus involved in all the
interminable wars caused by the rivalry of the different states. She ob-
tained permanent possession of Trseiso in 1339, Viacom in 1404., Paduo and
Verona in 1405, Ointdats in 11.19, Udtne in 1420, Brsscto in 1426, Bergerac in
1128, Drama in 1664, and Bantam in 1484. In the market-places of these
towns the lion of St. Mark was erected as a token of their sub'ugation, and
Venetian nobles were appointed their governors. The dist ct thus con-
md extended to about 13,20) sq. M.,.besides the Dalmatian possessions
I sq. M.) and thesettlements in the Levant. Napoleon at length over-
threw the Republic, which had long been in a tottering condition. On
15th and 16th May, 1791, Venice was occupied by French troops under
Baroguoy d‘Hiluers, this being the ﬁrst occasion on which it had ever
been captured by an enemy.‘ In the Peace of Campoformio (1797) it was
adjudged to Austria, but by the Peace of Pressburg in 1805 the Austrians
were compelled to cede it to Italy. On the fall of Napoleon it was again
trafrded to Austria, but in 1868 it was ﬁnally incorporated with the Kingdom
