to the Piazza del Duomo. The Via di Ports Rossa, the ﬁrst side—
street to the left, leads to the Mercato Nuovo, where ﬂowers and
straw and woollen wares are now sold. The market is adorned with
a good copy of the antique boar in bronze (p. 469 , by Pietro Tacea;
the handsome arcades are by G. B. Tasso (164 ). In the niches
are modern statues of celebrated Florentines, among them Michele
diLando by Ant. Bortone, Giov. Villani by Trentanove, and Fernando
Gennini by Mancini. Farther on in the same street (No. 9; on
the left) is the Paloma Davanzatt (Pl. E, 6), a well-preserved
castellated building of the 14th cent., with a picturesque court
(hence to Santa Trinitd, see p. 606).

In the Via de’ Calzajoli, on the left, rises the church of *Or
San Michele (Pl. E, 6), so called after the church of San Michele
in Orto, which originally occupied this site and was replaced by
a grain market in 1284. Only the lower story of the present build-
ing, dating from 1336-1412, is used as a church, the upper story,
which served as a com-magazine down to the middle of the
16th cent., being now used for lectures upon Dante. The window-
tracery is very beautiful. The external decoration of the ediﬁce
with statues was undertaken by the twelve guilds, whose armorial
bearings, some by Luca della Robbia, are placed above the niches.

Bologna, 1002 (judges and notaries; comp. p. 440); *Christ and St. Thomas,

tello (‘strikingly truthful in action and expression, though somewhat over-
laden with drapery‘); (1.) John the Baptist, by Lor. th'bertt‘, 1414 (guild

the left, on the 8. side, (r.) St. John, by Baccto da Hontelupo, 1616 (silk-
weavers; p. 440). Beneath the adjacent canOpy (physicians and apothecaries)
was formerly placed a Madonna which has been removed to the in-
terior of the church. — On the left, St. James, by Ciuﬁagnt (furriers)°
St. Mark, by Donatello, 1413 Qoiners; ‘it would have been impossible‘ said
Michael Angelo, ‘to have rejected the Gospel of such a straightforward
man as this‘). — 0n the W. facade, (r.) St. Eligius, by Nannt df Banco
(farriers; 1416); St. Stephen, by Lorenzo Ght‘bsrtr‘, 1428 (wool-weavers;
‘of simple but imposing grace in attitude and drapery‘); (1.) St. Matthew
by Ghs’bertt and Michelson, 1422 (money-changers); above the last, two
charming statuettes (the Annunciation) by Niccolo d‘Areuo (ca. 1400). — On
the N. side, (r.) St. George by Donatello (armourers), a bronze capy of the
original ﬁgure (1416) now in the National Museum (p. 473); below, a ﬁne
marble'relief of St. Oeorge by Nmt dt Banco; then four saints by Narmt

sists of a double nave, divided by pillars, to the right, the celebrated
‘Oanopy of Andrea Orcagna, in marble and precious stones, with numerous
statuettes and reliefs from sacred history, completed, according to the in-
scription. in 1369, and erected over the miracle-working picture of the
Virgin. The best reliefs are the Annunciation and Marriage of the Virgin
in front and her Death and Assumption, on the back. Over the altar
is a Hedonna ascribed to Ugoh‘m do 3m (1362).
