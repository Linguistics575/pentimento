454 Route 58. FLORENCE. a. Piazza del Duomo:

ciolini Cl), secretary of state, by Donatello, admirably individualised. Bust
of the architect De Fabris (d. 1888; p. 462). On the ﬁrst pillar, 8t. Zeno-
bius, a picture of the school of Orcagna.

The Asoas'r orlrna Don (p. 452) is very interesting, both for the
sake of obtaining an idea of its construction, and for the ‘View (more
extensive than from the Campanile, see below). Entrance by .a small door
in the left aisle (Open 7-12 in summer, 9-12 in winter; adm. 00¢); easy
ascent of 463 steps to the upper gallery, whence the adventurous visitor
may clamber up a ladder of 7 steps more to the cross on the summit.

The I"Campanile (Pl. F, 4), or bell-tower, begun by Giotto in
1334—36, carried on after his death by Andrea Phone and Franc.
Talenti, and completed in 1387, a square structure 292 ft. in height,
is regarded as one of the ﬁnest existing works of the kind. It consists
of four stories, richly decorated with coloured marble. The win-
dows, which increase in size with the diiierent stories, are enriched
with beautiful tracery in the Italian Gothic style. On the W. side are
four statues, the first three of which are by Donatello, viz. John the
Baptist (1416; little inferior to the St. George, p. 473), *David ('2'),
the celebrated ‘Zuccone’ or bald-head, and *Jeremiah. The fourth
(Obadiah) is by his assistant Rosco (1420). On the E. side are
Habakkuk and Abraham’s Oiiering, by Donatello (the latter, 1421,
partly by Rosso), and two patriarchs (Moses and Joshua?) by Rosco
(1421; the former partly by Donatello). On the N. and S. are sibyls
and prophets. Below these ﬁgures, on the sides of the tower, are
I"Baa-reliefs; those on the W., S., and E. sides by Andrea Piano
(from alleged designs by Giotto) and those on the N. by Luca delta
Robbia (1437): the Seven Cardinal Virtues, the Seven Works of
Mercy, the Seven Beatitudes, and the Seven Sacraments. In the
lower series is represented the deve10pment of mankind from the
Creation to the climax of Greek science (among the best are the
Creation of Eve, Adam and Eve at work, Dwellers in tents, Astro-
nomer, Rider, Weaving, Navigation, Agriculture), while the
liberal arts are represented by ﬁgures of Phidias, Apelles, Donates,
Orpheus, Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Euclid, and a musician.

‘The characteristics of Power and Beauty occur more or less in diii'erent
buildings, some in one and some in another. But all together, and all
in their highest possible relative degrees, they exist, so far as I know,
only in one building in the world, the Campanile of Giotto‘. —— Ruskin”:
‘Seven Lamps of Architecture‘. . '

The campanile is ascended by a good staircase of 414 steps (fee
I[2-1 fr.). Beautiful VIEW from the tap, embracing the city, the

valley in which it lies, the neighbouring heights, studded with villas and
richly cultivated, and the mountains to the N., 8., and E. At the summit

 

are seen the piers on which, according to Giotto‘s plan, it was pr0posed to ,

raise a spire of 100 ft.

On the B. side of the cathedral is the Canonry (Palauo def .

Canonici; Pl. F, 4), erected in 1827 by Gaetano Baccani; at the portal
are statues ofﬁrnolfo di Cambio and Filippo Brunelleschi, both by
Luigi Pampaloni (1830). — Into the wall of one of the following
houses (No. 29) is built the Sasso di Dante, a stone on which the
great poet is said to have been wont to sit on summer evenings. -
