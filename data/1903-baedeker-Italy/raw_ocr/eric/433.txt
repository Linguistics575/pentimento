276 Route 42. ' VENICE. a. Piazza of St. Mark:

‘The Library of St. Mark remains the crowning triumph of Venetian
art. It is impossible to contemplate its noble double row of open arches
without echoing the judgment of Palladio, that nothing more sumptuous
or beautiful had been invented since the age of ancient Rome” (J. A. Smnds).

0n the Lagune, between the Library and the Royal Garden, is
the old Zecca (P1. H, 6; hence ‘zecchino’ or ‘sequin’) or Mint, also
built by Sansovino in 1536. The interior has just been altered to
accommodate the library of St. Mark (p. 281). Beautiful court.

The ”Palace of the Doges (Palazzo Ducale; Pl. H, 5), the W.
side of which (82 yds.) faces the Piazzetta, and the S. side (78 yds.)
the Mole and the Lagune, is said to have been founded beside the
church of St. Theodore about 814 for the ﬁrst Doge of Venice. It
was rebuilt after conﬂagrations in 976 and 1105, and has been
repeatedly altered and restored. The Gothic exterior, lined with
small slabs of coloured marble, and with two pointed arcades of 107
columns (36 below, 71 above), one above the other, was thoroughly
restored in 1873-89. The S. part dates from the 14th cent. (1309

7 et seq.; large window, 1404), while the W. facade is said to have

been built in 1424—38 by Giovanni Buon and his sons Pantaleom
and Bartolomeo Buon the Elder. The magniﬁcent tracery of the
windows in the upper story has almost entirely disappeared in the
course of one of the restorations.

The upper arcade, called ‘La Laggia’, is remarkably rich. From
between the two columns of red marble (9th and 10th from the
principal portal) the Republic caused its sentences of death to be
proclaimed. The capitals of the short columns below (which have

no bases) are richly decorated with foliage, ﬁgures of men, and '

animals. On the corner-pillar next the portal are interesting ﬁgures
of Numa Pompilius, Scipio, Emperor Trajan judging the cause of
a widow, Justice, etc., all with inscriptions. The group above these
is the *Judgment of Solomon by two unknown Florentines. At the
corner towards the Lagune, Adam and Eve. Mr. Ruskin, who gives
an elaborate description of these sculptures in his ‘Stones of Venice’,
aﬂ‘irms that the capital under this group, ‘in the workmanship and
grouping of its foliage’, is, on the whole, the ﬁnest he knows in
Eur0pe. At the 8.133. angle, the sin of Noah. All these are Gothic.
In the centre of the Piazzetta facade is an alto-relief of the Lion
of St. Mark with a kneeling ﬁgure of Doge Andrea Gritti (1523-38),
which was destroyed by the Radicals in 1797 and restored by Cr-
bano Bottasso in 1897. Adjacent is a Venetia enthroned.

The transition from late—Gothic to Renaissance forms is illus-
trated by the ﬁne portal adjoining St. Mark’s, built in 1438—43
by Gino. and Bart. Buon the Elder. It is called *Porta della Carla
from the placards which announced the decrees of the Republic
here. The ﬁgure of Temperance, below to the left, the charming
Putti, climbing among the Gothic foliage of the tympanum, and the
ﬁgure of Justice, above, are especially attractive. The relief of the
