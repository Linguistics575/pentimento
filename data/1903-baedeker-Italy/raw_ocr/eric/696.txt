cornices, immediately above which are the handsome windows, with
their columnar mullions. The celebrated tep. cornice (unﬁnished),
by Cronaca, is an enlarged cepy from an antique Roman fragment.
The fanali or corner—lanterns (by Caparra), the link-holders, and
the rings are among the ﬁnest specimens of Italian iron-work of the
period. The court, added by Cronaca, is also impressive.

Nearly Opposite, on the E. side of the piazza, is the Palaszo
Strozsino (Pl. E, 6), a smaller building in a similar style, with a
ﬁne court, ascribed to Giuliano da Majano (ca. 1460). Farther on
the street reaches the Piazza Vitt. Emanuele (p. 604).

The back of the Pal. Strozzi abuts on the VLa Tonnanuom
(Pl. D, 4, 6), the most fashionable street in Florence, with hand-
some palazzi and ﬁne shops. On the right (No. ‘20), is the Palazzo
Corsi—Salviati (Pl. D, E, 4), formerly Tomabuoni, originally by
M ichelosso, but remodelled in 1867. No. 19, on the left, is the ﬁne
Palazso Larderel (P1. D, 4), formerly Giacomlni, in the develoPed
Renaissance style, by Giov. Ant. Dosio (1668-80). No. 3, also on
the left, facing the Piazza Antinori (Pl. E, 4), is the Palazso
AnlinOri (Pl. E, 4), with its elegant early-Renaissance facade, said
to have been built by Giuliano da Sangallo. — Opposite is the
church of Sanli Michele e Gaelano, rebuilt by Matteo Nigetti in
1604-48. Adjacent, to the left, is the Cappella San Gaetano
(sacristan in the lane to the left), containing a relief of the Madonna
by Andrea della Robbin.

Two streets lead to the W. from the Pal. Strozzi: the Via della
Vigna Nuova, to the left, and the Via della Spada, to the right. In
the former (No. ‘20) is the *Palazzo Bucellai (Pl. D, 4), erected in
1446-61 by Bern. Rossellino from a design by Leon Battista Alberti,
who for the ﬁrst time here employed a combination of rustica and
pilasters. Opposite is a 10ggia of 1468, now built up. — In the
'Via. della Spada are the former church of San Pancrasio (now a cigar-
factory), in the Piazza S. Pancrazio, and the Cappella de’ Rucellai
(key kept by the porter of the Pal. Rucellai; fee 1/2 fr.). The chapel
contains an ideal imitation in marble of the Holy Sepulchre at
Jerusalem, a shaming early-Renaissance structure, also by Alberli
(1467). -— The continuation of the Via della Spada, Via di Palazzuolo,

The Via Tornabuoni ends on the S. in the long Piazza SANTA
TnINI'rA (P1. D, 6). The N. end of the square is adorned with a
Granite Column from the Baths of Caracalla at Rome, erected here
in 1563, and furnished in 1670 with an inscription in honour of
Cosimo I., who had just been made grand—duke by the pope. On
the summit is placed a statue of Justice in porphyry, by Fr. Tadda,
added in 1681. The ﬁgure was afterwards considered too slender,
and consequently draped with a robe of bronze.

The church of *Banta Trinita (Pl. D, 6; pronouned Trl'm'ta by
the Florentines), one of the oldest buildings in the city, was in the
