docks mentioned at p. 73; then, under the name of Corso Aurelio
Saﬂ‘i (Pl. EH, 9, 10), it ascends gradually, skirts the sea beneath
the hill crowned by the church of Santa Maria di Garignano (p.83),
and ﬁnally ascends the right bank of the Besagno to the Ponte Pile
(Pl. H, I, 7; p. 76), whence it is continued by the Via Canevari,
leading to the Campo Santo (p. 86).

The Roan ro Nsnvr (carriage-tariff, see p. 68), the E. continuation of the

The main road, at present served by an omnibus-line only, runs due E.
viii the Collina d‘Albaro. In San Francesco d‘Albaro, at the top of the ridge,
are the house occupied by Lord Byron in 1822-23 (Via Albaro 10), the
Palazzo del Paradiso (16th cent), the Villa Cambiaso (1557), and other ﬁne

From Starla (23 ft.; p. 97), where the routes reunite, we skirt the
coast, with continuous ﬁne views of both Rivieras (p. 65), to the station

side of this piazza begins the '"Via. di Circonvallazione a Monte, a
magniﬁcent route laid out since 1876 on the hills at the back of the
town (electric line No. 2, see p. 68). It skirts the hillside to the
W. in long windings, under various names (Corso Principe Amedeo,
Corso Solfe-rino, Corso Magenta, Corso Paganini), and leads to the
Spianata Castelletto (Pl. E, 3), commanding one of the ﬁnest views
of Genoa. Here it takes the name of Corso Firense and runs to the
N. to the church and cable-car station (No. 1; p. 68) of San Nicole

and the charmingly situated Costello d’Albertis (Pl. 0, D, 1), a villa
in the style of a mediaaval castle, to the Cor-so Ugo Bassi, whence it
winds down under various names to the Piazza Acquaverde (p. 81).
