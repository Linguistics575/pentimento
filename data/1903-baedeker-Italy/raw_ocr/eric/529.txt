only as Duke of Modena and Reggio Ferrara and Comacchio having been
claimed by Pepe Clement VIII. in 1.897 as vacant ﬁefs. In the history of
art and-science the renown of the Heuse of Este is immortal.

‘Whoe‘er in Italy is known to fame
_ This lordly House as frequent guest can claim.‘

, _ The art of Painting was liberally patronised at Ferrara, as at all the
other Italian courts, but the Ferrarese painters did not succeed in main-
taining full independence. In the 15th century they were chieﬂy inﬂu-
enced by the Paduan school and by Piero della Francesca of Umbria.
This double inﬂuence is shown in the case of Cosimo Tara (1432-1M),
of Francesco Cocoa (d. at Bologna in 1480), whose easel-paintings are fre-
quently crude and angular, and of Ercole de‘ Roberti (d. 1496). the most
eminent of the early-Renaissance painters of Ferraro. next to Tara. The
chief works of this period are the frescoes in the Palace Schifanojs
(p. 358). — Lorenzo Costa (1460-1535; comp. p. 236). another Ferraresc
master, left his home in his youth and came into intimate relations of
action and reaction with Francesco Francis, the chief master of the B010:-
ncse school (comp. p. 365). The other great masters of the 16th cent. also
owed much to external sources. At their head stands Douo Dossi (ca. 1479-
1542), who shows the inﬂuence of Ariosto in his poetically conceived genre
works and of Giorgione in his landscapes. - Benoonuto Tm (1481-1559),
usually known as Gardfalo from his birthplace, long associated with
Dossi, is best represented in the galleries of Rome. The attempts of this
somewhat prosaic master ,to' rival the idealistic conceptions of Raphael
resulted disastrously. The productions of his later period, such as those
in the Pal. de’ Diamanti (p. 359), though of great technical perfection,
become tedious through the insipid sweetness and empty conventional“!
of the heads. — Lodom‘co Mazzolino (1481-1530) is known for his ﬁery red
colouring, but sinks into insigniﬁcance when compared with his great
contemporaries. — Correggio (p. 341) received his 'ﬁrst artistic training in
the school of Fer-rare. —- The Princes of Beta, especially Isabella d‘Este
who married a Duke of Mantua (p. 236), were eager collectors of the works
of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci. Titian also occasionally resided at
Ferrara, where he painted three Bacchanalian scenes (now in London and
Madrid) for Alphonso I.

We approach the town from the station by the broad VIALB
Cavern (Pl. B, 0, D, 2-4), which is shaded by plane-trees. —- At
the end of this street rises the —

*Castello (Pl. D, 4), an ancient and picturesque ediﬁce with

four towers, surrounded by a most. It was built after 1385 by Bare ‘

tolino da Novam for Niccolo II., and partly restored after a ﬁre in

1,554, and is now occupied by the prefect and other local authorities. ‘

The custodian is to be found at the S.W. entrance (ring at the iron
gate to the right; fee 1/2—1 fr.). The Sdla dcl Consiglio and the ad-
jacent Sula di Napoli, in the apartments of the prefecture, contain
frescoes of the school of Dosso Dossi, representing wrestling-matches
of the ancient palastra. The Sala dcll’ Aurora (said to be Eleonora’s
room) contains a ﬁne I"Frieze with children (‘putti’). Adjacent is a
cabinet with three Bacchanalia by followers of Gardfalo.

The custodian shows also a dungeon at the base of the ‘lion tower‘,
where the Mar-grave Nicholas III. conﬁned his faithless wife Pat-aim
Halatesta and his natural son Hugo, her paramour, before beheading them
(May 21st 1425). Lord Byron in his poem of ‘Parisina‘ substitutes the
name of A50 for Nicholas as being more metrical. Visitors also'see the
Risen m which Alphonso I. conﬁned for'llfe his brother Julius and the

ince Ferrante d‘Este after their conspiracy in 1508.
