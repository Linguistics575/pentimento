ITALIAN ART. ll

Alanna (creator of the Cappella Colleoni at Bergamo), and, at a
later period, Cmsrorono Sonanr, surnamed IL Gonno; Venice
abounds in works by the Lounannr, including Annssannno Lno-
mam (d. 1522), the most famous sculptor of his period; chero or
Bmosco (p. xlvii) wrought at Padua; AeosrrNo Bus'rr, n. Barman
(ca. 14804548), and the above-mentioned Onrs'rorono Sonanr, were
actively engaged at Milan; and Modcna aﬁ’orded employment to
Mazzom and BBGABBLLI (p. 348), artists in terracotta.

Among the various works executed by these masters, Monumental
Tombs largely predominate. While these monuments are often of
a somewhat bombastic character, they aﬁ‘ord an excellent illus-
tration of the high value attached to individuality and personal
culture during the Renaissance period. We may perhaps also fre-
quently take exception to the monotony of their style , which
remained almost unaltered for a whole century, but we cannot fail
to derive genuine pleasure from the inexhaustible freshness of
imagination and richness of detail displayed within so narrow limits.

As museums cannot convey an adequate idea of the sculpture
of the 15th century, so the picture galleries will not afford an
accurate insight into the painting of that period. Sculp- pumm
tures are frequently removed from their original position, or run Cm-
many of those belonging to the Florentine churches, for QWWNTO-
example , having been of late transferred to museums; but mural
paintings are of course generally inseparable from the walls which
they adorn. 0f the frescoes of the 15th century of which a record has
been preserved, perhaps one-half have been destroyed or obliterated,
but those still extant are the most instructive and attractive ex-
amples of the art of this period. The mural paintings in the church
of Santa Maria dcl Carmine ( Cappella Brancacci) at Florence (p. 509)
are usually spoken of as the earliest specimens of the painting of
the Renaissance. On material grounds the classiﬁcation is justiﬁable,
as this cycle of pictures may be regarded as a programme of the
earlier art of the Renaissance, the importance of which it served to
maintain, even during the age of Raphael. Here the beauty of the
nude was ﬁrst revealed, and here a calm dignity was for the ﬁrst
time imparted to the individual ﬁgures, as well as to the general
arrangement; and the transformation of a group of indiﬁ‘erent specta-
tors in the composition into a sympathising choir, forming as it were
a frame to the principal actors in the scene, was ﬁrst successfully
cﬁ’ected. It is, therefore, natural that these frescoes should still be
regarded as models for imitation, and that, when the attention of
connoisseurs was again directed during the 18th century to the
beauties of the pre—Raphaelite period, the works of Masonmo (9)
and Masaooro (1401-28) should have been eagerly rescued from
oblivion.

A visit to the churches and convents of Florence is well calculated
to convey an idea of the subsequent rapid development of the art of
