in 1867 et seq., contains excellent works by Paolo Veronese, and his

jacent are a large cotton-factory (‘cotoniﬂcio‘) and the harbour-
structures at the Stations Marittima (p. 270; steamer, see p. 261).

We may return from San Sebastiano by the Formamm'rn BELLE
Za'r'rnnn (Pl. D, E, 7), skirting the Giudecca Canal (p. 318) and
affording a pretty View of the Redentore (p. 318). The church of
San Trovaso (Pl. E, 6), near this quay, contains three paintings
by J ac. Tintoretto: Last Supper, Adoration of the Magi, and Rejec—
tion of Joachim’s Sacriﬁce.

This church stands on the border—line between the ‘Nicolotti‘ and the
‘Castellani’, the two factions into which the Venetians are divided (see
H. F. Brown‘s ‘Life on the Lagoons‘). The father and godfather of a child
christened here, if of apposite factions, leave the church by diﬂ'erent doors.

On the quay itself lie the Pal. Giustiniani-Rccanati (No. 1402),
with a number of antique works in marble, including a ﬁne Attic
funeral relief, and the church of I Gesuati or Madonna del Rosario
(Pl. E, 7), built in 1726-43 by Giorgio Massari. The ceiling of
the church is adorned with ﬁne frescoes by Ticpolo, representing
the institution of the festival of the rosary (in the middle), with
a vision of the Madonna and the gloriﬁcation of St. Dominic. BY
