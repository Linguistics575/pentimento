238 Route 33. MANTUA. From Verona

The entire quarter between the Piazza Sordello and the Lago
Inferiore is occupied by the spacious Reggie, or Carts Beale
(Pl. D, 2), originally a palace of the Bonacolsi (1302), afterwards
frequently added to by the Gonzagas, but now in great part un-
occupied. The original Gothic facade, with its battlements, is still
in good preservation. The original splendour of the palace is still
represented in the apartments of Isabella d’Este (p. 236) as well
as in those altered for Federico II. in 1525-31 by Giulio Romano.
The elegant decorations in the classicist style, now to be seen in
several of the rooms destroyed by the Austrians in 1630, date from
the reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph II.‘ and from the time of
the viceroy Eugene Beaubarnais (p. 111).

. A visit to the palace requires not less than 1 hr. The custodian is
to be found under the second large arched gateway to the left (fee 1 fr.).

Ground Floor. The so-called Seaman, embellished with ﬁne gro-
tesques and frescoes (hunting-scenes with Diana, etc.), by Giulio Romano, is
,now the solitary relic of the Appartamento della Gretta, prepared for
Isabella d‘Este and once ﬁlled with art-treasures.

The Upper Floor is reached by means of a handsome staircase dating
from 1640. The Sana nm Doom is hung with portraits of all the Gon-
zagas. -- The Arranrauanro DELI.‘ Inrnnarnroa was altered under Iaria
Theresa by Gina. Hermara‘m‘ (p. 147). In the last room is the bed used by
Eugene Beauharnais (1812). — The adjoining Sana out From is embellished
with allegorical ﬁgures of the rivers near Mantua, by Giorgio Amine
(1776). In front of it is the new Giardino Pensile, or hanging garden. --
The Sam Dunno Zomaco has ceiling-paintings of the signs of the zodiac,
by Lora Gotta the Younger,- the mural decorations date from 1808. -— The
Arranrannuro DELL‘ Inrnnaroan, altered for Joseph II. in 1783 by Paolo
Pozzo, has been tastefully decorated by the Mantuan artists, And. How
and 0. B. Marconi. On some of the walls are painted copies (by Fol.
Gampt') of the tapestry brought hither by Maria Theresa from the church
of Santa Barbara. The tapestry itself (cepies of Raphael‘s tapestry in
the Vatican) is now in Vienna. Napoleon I. once slept in the ﬁrst room. —
The Prcruau GALLERY (Galleria def Quaw-t‘) contains unimportant paintings
and two portrait-busts by Bernim‘. — The Arranrausnro Ducana, builtby Ant.
Want under Vincenzo I. (1587-1812), is at present empty. — The ‘Arranra-
unnro our. Pauanrso, consisting of the four little Camertnt of Isabella
d‘Este, is interesting for its early-Renaissance decorations, still in tolerable
repair. We observe here particularly the intarsia, the beautiful reliefs
on the marble door, and the delicate ceiling-painting. The motto of the
princess, ‘nec spe nee metu’, appears several times. The corner- room
commands a charming view of the now neglected garden and of the Lego
Inferiore. In the last room are some remains of the old frieze from the
Sale dello Zodiaco (see above). -— The sumptuous Sana neon: Srsccur
(room of mirrors) is embellished with frescoes by pupils of Giulio Romano. —
We now pass through the Arranrannro nr Taosa, some of the richly
decorated rooms of which are in sad disrepair: Sala di Manto, formerly
a banquet-room; Sela del Giuramento, with a (restored) fresco of Luigi
Gonzaga (p. 236) receiving the allegiance of the pe0ple; Sale dei Cimieri,
with charming stucco ornamentation by Fr. Primaticct‘o and [a view of
the Castello di Corte, Ponte San Giorgio, Lago Inferiore, and Lago di
Mezzo; Sala del Trion'fo diiGiulio Cesare, so called from the series of
nine paintings by Andrea Mantegna, now at Hampton Court; two rooms
with elegant grotesques (adjoined by a loggia and the old hanging garden);
Stanza del Giove, with a ceiling—painting by GiulioRomano; Sale. di Tro'a,
withﬂfrescoes by Giulio Romano (poorly restored in 1846); and ‘Sala ei
Marni, tastefully decorated in the style of the ancient thermaa. —- The
GALLERIA DELLA Mosraa, at one time occupied by the natural history
museum, retains traces of its,.old ceiling, painted by Giulio Romano._ _It
