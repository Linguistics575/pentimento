On the N. side of the Campo rises the rich facade of the *Scuola
di San Marco (Pl. H, 4), erected in 1485-95 by Moro Coducci and
the Lombardi, with singular reliefs in perspective of two lions. In
the pediment over the portal is a good relief representing St. Mark
surrounded by his fraternity. The building, with the adjacent
Dominican monastery, has been used as a hospital (Ospedale Civilc)
since 1815. The chief ward has a magniﬁcent ceiling. Connected
with it is the old chapel of Santa Maria della Pace, which once con-
tained Marine Falieri’s tomb (p. 266).

In the centre of the Campo are a ﬁne Welt Head and the
equestrian “Statue of Bartolommeo Colleeni (d. 1475; buried at
Bergamo, p. 195), general of the Republic, modelled by Leonardo
da Vinci’s teacher Andr. Vcrrocchio (d. 1488; his last work) and
cast in bronze by Aless. Leapardi, who also designed the lofty marble
pedestal (1490-95).

‘1 do not believe there is a more glorious work of sculpture existing in
the world than the equestrian statue of Bartolommeo Golleoni‘. — Ruskin.

*Santa Maria dei Miracoli (Pl. G. H, 4), in the vicinity, recently
restored, is a small, early-Renaissance church without aisles,
erected in 1480-89 under the superintendence of Pietro Lombardo,
and richly encrusted with marble both without and within. The
quadrangular domed choir, fourteen steps higher than the nave, is
peculiar (below it is the sacristy). On the right and left are am-
bones, or lecterns where the epistles and gospels are read, as in
ancient Christian churches. The barrel vaulting, with its richly
gilded coﬂ‘ers, is painted by Girol. da Treviso. In the passage beside
the sacristy is an unﬁnished relief of the Last Supper, by Tullio
Lombardo.
