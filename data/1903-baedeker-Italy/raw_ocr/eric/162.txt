History. GENOA. 16. Route. 71

The internal history of the city was no less chequered than the ex-
ternal. The party-conﬂicts between the great families of the Doria,
sz’nola, Adorm', and Frcgost (Ghibellines) on one side, and the Grimaldi,
Piesdu', Guarani, and Montalds' (Guelphs) on the other, led to some extra-
ordinary results. The defeated party ~used, at the expense of their own
independence, to invoke the aid of some foreign prince, and accordingly
we ﬁnd that after the 14th cent. the kings of Naples and France, the
marquises of Montferrat, and the dukes of Milan were alternately masters
of Genoa. Nor was this state of affairs materially altered by the revolution
of 1339, by which the exclusive sway of the nobility was overthrown,
and a Dogs, elected for life, invested with the supreme power. In the
midst of all this confusion the only stable element was the mercantile
Banco dt San Giorgio, which had acquired extensive possessions, chieﬂy
in Corsica, and would, perhaps, have eventually absorbed the whole of the
republic and converted it into a commercial aristocracy, had not Genoa
lost its power of independent development bg becoming involved in the
wars of the great powers. And?” .Dorja (p. 1), the admiral of Emperor
Charles V., at length restored peace by the establishment of a new oligarchic
constitution (1528), and the unsuccessful conspiracy of Fiesco in 1647 was
one of the last instances of an attempt to make the supreme power
dependent on unbridled personal ambition. But the power of Genoa was
already on the wane. The Turks conquered its Oriental possessions one
after another, and the city was subjected to severe humiliations by
Louis XIV. of France, whose ﬂeet under Duquems bombarded Genoa in
1&4, and by the Imperial troops by whom the city was occupied for
some months in 1746. These last were expelled by a papular rising,
begun by a stone thrown by Balilla, a lad of 16 years. A revolt in Corsica,
which began in 1729 was suppressed only with the aid of the French,
who afterwards (1766) took possession of the island on their own behalf.
In 1797 the aristocratic government of Genoa was superseded by the
democratic ‘Ligurian Bepublic‘, established by Napoleon. In 1805 Genoa
was formally annexed to the Empire of France, and in 1815 to the Kingdom
of Sardinia.

To the student of art Genoa offers much of interest. Some of the
smaller churches are of very ancient origin, though usually altered in the
Gothic period. The Renaissance palaces of the enoese noblesse are, on
the other hand, of the greatest importance, surpassing in number and
magniﬁcence those of any other city in Italy. Many of these palaces were
erected by Galcazzo Alesst (a pupil of Michael Angelo, born at Perugia
1&1), d. 1572), whose style was followed by subsequent architects. In
spite of occasional defects, Alessi’s architecture is of an imposing and
uniform character, and displays great ingenuity in making the best of an
unfavourable and limited site. The palaces, moreover, contain a consid-
erable number of works of art, while Rubens, who resided at Genoa in

, and Van Dyck at a later period, have preserved the memory of
many members of the noblesse. The native school of art, however, never
rose to importance, and was far from being beneﬁted by the zeal of its
artists in painting facades. The chief painters were Luca Cambium (1527-85),
Bernardo Strozzi, surnamed It Cappuccino or Prete Genovese (1581-1 ),
Gian. Bait. Paggi (1554-1627), Benedetto Oastt'glione (1616-70), and Bartolomeo
Biscaino (1632-57).

a. The Harbour and the Adjoining Streets.

Until recently the harbour consisted solely of the Porto or inner
harbour, which was closed on the S. by the M010 Vccchio (492 yds.
long), said to have been constructed in 1134, and by the M010 Nu-
ovo (722 yds. long), dating from the 18th century. In 1877-96,
however, very extensive additions were made, a sum of 20 million
francs having been presented to the city for the purpose by the Mar-
