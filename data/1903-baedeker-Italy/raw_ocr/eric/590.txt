History. PISA. . 56. Route. 405

Pisa, a quiet town with 60,255 inhab., the capital of a province,
the see of an archbishop, and the seat of a university, is situated
on both banks of the Amo, 6 M. from the sea and about 4 M. from
the base of the Monti Pisani (p. 415). Its climate is ‘moist and
fairly mild, but the town has always had the reputation of being
rainy. Good drinking-water is brought from the neighbourhood of
Asciano (p. 415).

Pisa was the Pine of the ancients, and once lay at the conﬂuence of the
Amos and Amer (Serchio), which last has now an estuary of its own.
It became a Roman colony in B.C. 180. Augustus gave it the name of
Colonic Julia Pisana and Hadrian and Antoninus Pius erected temples,
theatres, and triumphal arches here. At that period the town must have
been a place of considerable importance, but all its ancient monuments,
have disappeared with the exception of a few scanty relics of some
thermm (‘Bagni di Nerone‘) near the Porta Lucca (Pl. D, 1; tablet). At
the beginning of the 11th cent. Pisa attained the rank of one of the
greatest commercial and seafaring towns on the Mediterranean, and became
a rival of Venice and Genoa. It was chieﬂy indebted for its power to the
seal with which it took the lead in the wars against the Inﬂdels. In
1025 the Pisans expelled the Saracens from Sardinia and took permanent
possession of the island. In 1030 and 1089 they again defeated the Saracens
at Tunis, and in 1063 destroyed their ﬂeet near Palermo. In 1114 they
conquered the Balearic Islands, and soon afterwards took a prominent
part in the Crusades. In the 12th and 13th centuries their power had
reached its zenith; their trade extended over the entire Mediterranean,
and their supremacy embraced the Italian islands and the whole of the
coast from La Spezia to Civith Vecchia. In the intestine wars of the
peninsula Pisa was the mo t powerful adherent of the Ghibellines, and
therefore sustained a save e shock through the downfall of the Hohen-
staufen. The protracted wars which the citizens carried on with Genoa led
to their disastrous defeat at Meloria near Leghorn on 6th Aug., 1284 (p. 76),
and the peace concluded in 1300 compelled them to evacuate Corsica and
atber possessions. In 1320 the pope invested the kings of Aragon with
Sardinia, and Pisa was thus deprived of this important island also. The
:ity was farther weakened by internal dissensions, and fell a victim to the
Lmbition of the condottieri. In 1405 it was sold to Florence, but on the
irrival of Charles VIII. it endeavoured to shake 03‘ the yoke of its arrogant
neighbour. In 1509, however, it was besieged and again occupied by the
florentines, to whom it thenceforth continued subject.

In the History of Art Pisa occupied an impertant position at an
arly period, but was obliged to yield up its artistic precedence earlier
han its political to the more fortunate Florence. The progress of art at
’isa was more rapid than in the rest of Tuscany, owing perhaps to the
sﬂuence of its numerous and handsome ancient monuments, as Roman
)rms repeatedly recur in the buildings. With the foundation of the
ATHEDRAL of Pisa began the dawn of mediseval Italian art. This church
I in the old basilica style, but with the not unimportant innovation of
aving a dome over the centre of the cross. The magniﬁcent building Opera-
ons of the Pisans continued throughout the whole of the 12th cent., and
:rminated with the erection of the charming church of Santa Maria della
pina (1230), that of Santa Caterina(1253), and the Campo Saute (1278). In
re 13th cent. Pisa was also important as a cradle of SCULPTURE, and gave
Lrth to Niccolo Pisano (ca. 1206-80), a precursor of the Renaissance. Under
hat inﬂuences Niccolo was trained is uncertain, but there is a marked
ﬂ’erence between his works, with their somewhat antique cast, and those

his Pisan predecessors (such as the bronze door of the cathedral by Bo-
mnus). His son, Giovanni Pisano (ca. 1250- ca. 1328), also noted as an
chitect. was no less famous than his father, whose antique style, however,
did not follow. Keen observation of nature and a highly picturesque
rle distinguish his works; his ﬁgures are charged with passionate move-
