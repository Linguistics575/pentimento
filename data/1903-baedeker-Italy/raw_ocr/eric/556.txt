About 11/4 M. outside the Pears SAN'r’ Isau (Pl. A, 4), to the
W. of the town, is situated the Cartoon (formerly a Carthusian
monastery), erected in 1335, and consecrated in 1801 as a Campo
Santa. It occupies the site of an old Etruscan burial-ground, dis-
covered here in 1869. Open daily 8-6 (in winter 9-4). The en~
trance is in the N.W. corner; the custodian (ﬁrst court, to the left)
is well-informed (1/2-1 in). The Certosa may be reached by tram-
way (p. 362) or in 1/4 hr. from Meloncello (see below).

The church contains a few paintings by Elisabetta Hiram“ and Bart. Cost,
and wood-carving of 1.539 and 611. -- At the beginning of the CLors'rnns
are ancient tombstones from suppressed churches, arranged according to
centuries: at the entrance 18th cent, than 15th on the right, 14th farther

On the Monte della Guardia, an eminence 3M. to the S.W. of
the Pours Sanaoozzs (Pl. A, 6), rises the handsome pilgrimage
church of the Madonna di San Luca (950 ft.), erected by Dotti in 1732
et seq. , and so called from an ancient picture of the Virgin, ascribed
to St. Luke and brought from Constantinople in 1160. The hill is
ascended in about 50 min. by a series of Arcades, consisting of
666 arches with numerous chapels, constructed in 1674-1739, and
31/2 M. in length. They begin a short way beyond the gate and
send a branch to the Campo Santo (see above). Steam-tramway
from the Piazza Malpighi to Meloncello at the foot of the hill (p. 362).
Thence the steps may be avoided by following the road along the
arcades. A better road (carriage with one horse 10 fr.) diverges to
the left into the valley of the Rio Banana, 1/2 M. outside the Porta
Saragozza, and ascends in windings. At the (1 hr.) fork, the road to
San Luca diverges to the right, making a wide curve past Monte
Albano, and reaches the church in 3/4 hr. more. The *View, partic-
