266 Route 42. VENICE. History.

The Carnival, which formerly presented a gayer and lighter scene at
Venice than in any other city of Italy, has of late entirely lost its signi-
ﬁcance. -— The city authorities sometimes give Beremdes, i.e. concerts with
illuminations on the Canal Grands. -— The Regatta: held periodically on
the Grand Canal are characteristic and interesting. The course is from
the Public Gardens to the Railway Station and back to the Pal Foscari.
-- The Meta del Mentors (second Sun. in July) is also interesting.

 

History. For the early history of Venice, see p. 220. The foundation
of the Eastern supremacy of Venice was laid by Dogs Enrico Daadolo
(1192-1205), who conquered Constantinople in 1204. In consequence of this

Venice gained possession of numerous places on the coasts of the Adriatic I

and the Levant, from Durazzo to Trebisond, and of most of the Greek
islands, including Candis, which was administered on the model of the
mother-city. During the conquest and administration of these new terri-
tories there arose a class of nobles, who declared themselves hereditary
in 1297 and excluded the rest of the people from all share in the govern-
ment. The supreme authority lay with the Great Council (Happier Con-
sigh’o), which consisted of all members of the Nomi above twenty. The
executive was vested in a Boys, or Duke, and six counselldrs, with
whom was associated the Council of the Pregadi. The Pregadi were after-
wards united with the higher ofﬁcials to form the Senate. The duty of
the Asoogadori di Commas was to see that the public ofﬁcials governed
constitutionally. After the conspiracy of quamonte Tiepolo (1310) the
chief power was vested in the Council of Ten (Consiglio dei Disc-i), elected
yearly by the Maggior Consiglio; and this tribunal, from which the State
Inquisition was developed in the 18th cent, controlled, in conjunction
with the dOge and his councillors every department of government.
With her rival Genoa the public came repeatedly into violent
conﬂict, losing many of her conquests in the East; but the Genoese were

at length totally defeated by Dogs Andrea Dandolo in 1852. His successOr i

(1382-1400) occupied the island of Corfu, and afterwards D‘urazeo, Argos,
etc. Under Michele Stem (1400-1414) the Venetian general Halatesta con-
quered Vicenza, Belluno, Feltre Rovigo, Verona, and Padua (1405); in
408 the Republic gained possession of Lepanto and Patras, and in 1409 of
Guastalla and Casalmaggiore. In 1421 Tomaso Hocem'yo waged war suc-
cessfully against Hungary. In 1418 the Venetian ﬂeet under Landau defeated
the Turkish at Gallipoli, and in 1421 it subdued all the towns of the Dal-
matian coast, so that Venice now held the entire coast from the estuary
of the P0 to the island of Corfu. Mocenigo‘s successor was Francesco Fos-
cart' (1423-57). In 1426 Brescia fell into the hands of the Venetian general
Camagnola (p. 47). In 1449 the Venetians took Cr'ema, but were unable
to prevent the elevation of Sforza to the dukedom of Milan (1450). A sad
ending awaited the long and glorious career of Foscari. Suspected by the
Council of Ten, and weakened by contentions with the Loredani and other
private feuds, he was do need in 1457 and died a few days afterwards. -
Under Cristoforo Hora { 462-71) the Turks conquered the Korea, where a
few fortresses only were retained by Venice. In 1483 the Republic acquired
Zante, and in 1489 Cyprus also, which was ceded by Catharine Cornaro,
a Venetian lady, widow of King James of Cyprus.
