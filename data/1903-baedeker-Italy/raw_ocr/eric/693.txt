as goals. —— On the Losers DI SAN PAOLO, an arcade opposite the
church, erected in 1489-96, is a good terracotta-relief by Andrea
delta Robbie, representing the meeting of St. Francis and St. Do-
minic. —- The canopy at the corner of‘the Via della Scala (p. 501)
is by Franc. Fiorentino, a pupil of Lorenzo Monaco (15th cent).

The church of 'Banta Maria Novella (Pl. D, 3), begun in 1278
on the site of an earlier ediﬁce, from designs by the Dominican monks
' Fra Sisto and Pro Ristoro, and completed in the interior after 1350
by Fra Jae. Talenti, is ‘perhaps the purest and most elegant example
of Tuscan Gothic’. In 1456-70 it was furnished with a beautiful
marble facade (begun in the lower, Gothic portion as early as about
1300) and a ﬁne portal, executed by Giov. Bertini from the designs
- of Leon Battiata Alberti, who ﬁrst employed volutes here to connect
the nave and aisles. A quadrant and two concentric meridians on
the right and left were constructed by P. Ignacio Danti in 1572. —-
The pointed arcades (‘avelli’ i.e. vaults) of black and white marble,
which adjoin the church on the E., were originally constructed in the
14th cent, and were restored in 1870; they were used as tombs for
the nobility. The best view of the mediaaval building, with its

tasteful campanile (restOred in 1895), is obtained from the N.E. side.

The spacious Interior, in the form of a vaulted Gothic basilica, con-
sists of nave and aisles resting on 12 alternately thin and thick iers. his
325 ft. long and 93 ft. wide: the transept is 202 ft. in length. e unequal
distances between the pillars, varying from 37 ft. to 49 ft., are an as-
explained peculiarity. (The visitor is warned not to overlook the two step
halfway up the church.)

Nave. On the entrance-wall, to the left of the central door, the
'Trinity with the Virgin and St. John and two donors, in fresco (much
injured), one of the best works of Masaccio; on the right, Annunciation,
fresco of the 14th century. Over the door, a crucifix in the style of Giotto.
—- The altar-pieces are by Vasart‘ (4th altar on the left, Resurrection)
Jae. Ligorn', etc. -— In the RIGHT Tnaxsnr'r, to the right, monument oi
Bish0p Aliotti (d. 1336) by Tina dz“ Germaine; farther on, the Gothic monu-
ment of the Patriarch Joseph of Constantinople (d. 1440), who died while
attending the Great Council of 1439 (p. 441). Above the monument is a
Madonna by Nina mane. —- We now ascend the steps to the Curran
RUOELLAI, which contains a large Madonna with angels, by C's‘mabuem.
This is the picture which, according to Vasari was borne in solemn pro-
cession from the painter‘s studio to the church (ca. 1280), ‘followed by the
whole p0pulation, and with such triumph and rejoicings that the quartet
where the painter dwelt obtained the name, which it has ever since
retained, of Borgo Allegri‘ (Lindsay‘s ‘Christian Art”). In this chapel are
also the monument of Beata Villana by Bernardo Rossellino (14.51) and a
Martyrdom of St. Catherine by Bugiardt'ni (partly copied from a drawing
by Michael Angelo). —— To the right of the choir is the Omar. or Flam
S'rnozzr, with his *Monument by Ben. da Majano (1491), and frescoes by
Filippino Lippi (1502): on the left, St. John resuscitating Drusiana, and
Martyrdom of St. John in a caldron of boiling oil; on the ri t, St. Philip
exorcising a dragon; above is a fine stained-glass window r a
by Ffupptno.

The Cnom contains "Frescoes by Domenico Ght'rlandajo, which form
that master‘s most pOpular work, and are also the ﬁnest specimens of
Florentine art before Leon. daVinci, Michael Angela, and Raphael. Accord-
ing to the inscription they were painted ‘anno 1490, quo pulcherrima civital
cpibus victor-its artibus, aediﬁciisque nobilis copia salubritate pace per-

ruebatur‘. On the upper part of the wall of the altar is a Coronation of
