Florence, formerly the capital of the Grand-Duchy of Tuscany,
in 1865-70 that of the Kingdom of Italy, and now that of the
province of its own name, the seat of an archbish0p, and the head- .
quarters of the VIII. Corps d’Armo’e, ranks with Rome, Naples, and

no other locality possesses within so narrow limits, reminiscences
of a history which has inﬂuenced the whole of Europe, perpetuated
by numerous and imposing monuments, and lastly the delighth
environs of the city combine to render Florence one of the most
interesting and attractive places in the world.
