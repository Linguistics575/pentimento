Excursions. MILAN. 19. Route. 143

The Gimitero di Musocco, 2 M. to the N.W. of the Porto del
Sempione (p. 133), was laid out in 1895 and is twice the size of
the Cimitero Monumentale. It is reached either by the Corso del
Sempionc (Pl. B, A, 1) or by the Corso at Oimitcro di Musocco (elec-
tric tramway), beginning at the Piazza San Michele, to the W. of

Excursion from Milan to the Certosa di Pavia.

To visit the Certosa di Pavia we may use either the RAILWAY to Cer-
tota, on the Pavia-Voghera line, or the Pavia Srsax Tnauwar as far as
Tom dt Manama. The railway starts from the Central Station and takes
1/:-1 hr. (fares 3 fr. 30, 2 fr. 30, 1 fr. 50c.:, return-fares 4 fr. 75, 2 fr. 50,
Mr. 60 c.). The tramway starts about every 2 hrs. from the Porta Tici-
nese (Pl. D, 8; electric tramway from the Piazza del Duomo, see p. 114) and
takes 11/3-13/4 hr. (return-fares 2 fr. 40, 1 fr. 50 c., or, incl. omn. to the Cer-
tosa, 2fr. 70, 1 fr. 80 c.). The whole excursion takes 1[a day.

The district traversed between Milan and Pavia consists of alter-
nate stretches of rice-ﬁelds and underwood and oﬁ’ers little of in-
terest. At (41/2 M.) Rogoredo the RAILWAY diverges to the S. from
the line to Piacenza (p. 333). —— 51/2 M. Chiaravalle Milanese, with
its Cistercian *Church, a ﬁne brick ediﬁce with a lofty domed tower,
in the so-called Romanesque Transition style, dedicated in 1221,
but partly modernised. The interior is adorned with frescoes by
Milanese painters of the 16th cent. and contains choir-stalls of
1465. — 91/2 M. Locate; 121/2 M. Villamaggiore.

171/2 M. Stasionc delta Certosa (Hotel de la Ville, dej. 3 fr.),
whence two routes lead along the enclosing wall (right and left) to
the entrance (W. side) of the Gertosa (walk of 1/4 hr. ; omn., 30 or
50 c.). — On the 8. side of the Certosa is the modest Alb. Milano.

The STEAM Tnauwar follows the highroad and passes Binasco, with
an ancient castle, in which the jealous Duke Filippo Maria Visconti
caused his noble and innocent wife Beatrice di Tenda (p. 45) to be put

10 death in 1418. The station of Torre dt‘ Manama (All). Italia clean,
déj. 211;, D. a in, wine included), on the Naviglio di Pavia (p. 156), lies
about 1/2 M. to the W. of the Ger-toss. (omn. 30c.).

The *Certosa di Pavia, or Garthusian monastery, the splendid
memorial of the Milan dynasties, was begun in 1396 by Gian
Galeazzo Visconti (p. 111) in fulﬁlment of a vow made by his wife
Catharina. The monastic buildings were practically completed
about 1450, under the direction of Bern. da Venezia, Cristof. da
Conigo , and others; while the church, originally begun in a N.
Gothic style, reﬂecting the inﬂuence of Milan Cathedral, was con-
tinued after 1453 by Guinifortc Solari (d. 1481) in the Lombard
Transition style, with exterior arcading and elaborate terracotta
ornamentation. Between 1491 and 1499 Giov. Ant. Amadeo and
numerous other sculptors shared in the embellishment of the facade
0f white marble (from Carrara and Candoglia, p. 179), which was
ﬁnally completed (lower part only) by Ben. Briosco and others in
1007. The monastery, suppressed under Emperor Joseph II. in
