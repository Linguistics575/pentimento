Luino (690 ft.), a pleasant and busy town with 6000 inhab., is
Situated a little to the N. of the mouth of the Tresa (p. 164). The
Statue of Garibaldi, near the pier, commemorates his brave but futile
attempt to continue the contest here with his devoted guerilla band
after the conclusion of the armistice between Piedmont and Austria
on Aug. 15th, 1848. The church of San Pietro, in the S.W. of the
town, contains injured frescoes by Bernardino Luini, a native of
the place (ca.,1470-1530). Among the numerous tasteful villas in
the vicinity is the Palazzo Crivclli, to the N. , surrounded by pines.
1* Pleasant walk to Maccagno (see above). — At the mouth of the Tresa,
I: M. to the S.W.. lies Germingnaga, with the large silk-spinning (ﬁlande)
and winding (ﬁlataz‘e) factories of E. Stehli-Hirt of Ziirich. — To Varese
thrOngh the Val Travagh‘a and Valganna, see p. 167.

On the W. bank rise two grotesque-looking castles (Castclli di
Camera), half in ruins, the property of Count Borromeo. In the
15th cent. they harboured the ﬁve brothers Mazzarda, notorious
bﬂsands, the terror of the district. -— Cannsro (H6t.-Pens. Nizza;
Alb- San Remo; Alb. Cannero) is beautifully situated on the sunny
3- 310pes of Monte Oar-ea, in the midst of vineyards and orchards.
BeYond it is the little village of Barbe, with its slender campanile.
