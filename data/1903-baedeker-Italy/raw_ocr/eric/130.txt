(E.) begin, is now closed to ordinary trafﬁc. The new road, constructed
in 1883, penetrates the Tenda by means of a tunnel, about 11/2 M. long
(N. entrance 4330.ft., S. entrance 4196 ft.). From the central point both
ends are visible. The road then descends through the valley of the Roja,
to (9 M.) Vievola (see below).

The railway now traverses the Tenda Tunnel (5 M. long), com-
pleted in 1899, and enters the valley of the Boys. -- 82 M. Vievola

The ﬁne Roan T0 VnN'rmIGLIA passes through a ravine, enclosed
by curious sandstone rocks, and reaches — ‘

21/2 M. (from Vievola) Tends. (2675 ft-.; Alb. Nationals, Lama,
Grace Bianca, Stazione, all plain; post-omnibus to Nice), 8. pic-
turesque little town with 2279 inhab., overhung by precipitous walls
of rock. Fragments of the castle where Beatrice di Tenda was born
(comp. p. 143) stand on a rock here.

Excursions (guide, Maurizio Sassi) may be made from Tenda through
the Um Wood to (4 hrs.) the t0p of the Monte Ciagorc (7525 ft.), which
commands a view extending to the sea; to the N.E., through the pic-
turesque valley of the Rio Freddo and over the (4 hrs.) Colic dei Signom‘
(refuge—hut), to the top of the Cima ds' Harguarei: (8890 ft.), the highest
summit of the Ligurian Alps (*View).

We. now descend through a narrow rocky valley to —

51/2 M. San Dalmazzo di Tends. (2200 ft.; Italian custom—house),
situated amid luxuriant groves of chestnut, with several villas and
an old Carthusian abbey, ﬁtted up as a hotel and hydropathic (open
from mid-April to the end of Oct., pens. 8 fr.; Engl. Ch. service).
Some interesting caves have recently been discovered in the vicinity.

About 2 M. to the E. of San Dalmazzo lies Briga (2500 ft..; Hotel de la
Source, well spoken of), in the valley of the Levenza, with an interesting
church. A little to the S. is the pine-forest of Pine. —-— A bridle-path leads
to the W. to (3 hrs.) Oasterino (5110 it; good accommodation), in an
attractive valley, surrounded by larch-woods. Excursions (guides) may
he made from this point past the old silver and lead mine of Vallaurt'a,
once worked by the Saracens, to the wild Valle dew Inferno, strewn with
huge blocks of rock and containing 14 small lakes, and on to (3 hrs.) the
Heraos'gh'e (7218 ft.), rocks of slate inscribed with rude drawings of unknown
antiquity; via. the Fontanalba Valley, with similar drawings, to the (5 hrs.)
top of the ‘Monte Bego (942511.), which commands a splendid view of the
Alps, Nice, and the Riviera (ascent fatiguing but not difﬁcult); and to
the three large mountain-lakes of *Valmasca, which lie in a rocky solitude,
one above another, the largest (21/2 hrs; toilsome walk) at a height of
7675 ft. at the foot of the Hts. Ciamtneias (9556 ft.).

Near the (8 M.) French frontier the valley contracts to the *Gola
di Gaudarena, one of the most imposing gorges of the Alps, so nar-
row at places as barely to leave room for river and road between
the perpendicular rocks (700-800 ft.). -— At (101/2 M.) Fontana
(Fr. Fontan, 1424 ft.), with the French custom-house, the scenery
assumes a more southern character and the ﬁrst olives appear.
Farther on Saorgio (Fr. Saorgc), on a lofty rocky terrace to the left,
with the ruins of a castle destroyed by the French in 1702, com-
mands the road. Adjacent is a large monastery.
