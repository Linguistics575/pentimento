Crcmona 165 ft.), the capital of a province and an epismpal
see, with 36, 18 inhab., lies in a fertile plain on the left bank of

the Po, and carries on considerable silk-manufactures.

The original town was wrested by the Romans from the Gallic Ceno-
mani and colonised by them at the beginning of the second Punic war
(3.0. 218). It became one of the most ﬂourishing towns in E. Italy, bui
in 70 A.D., during the civil wars, it. was reduced to ruins by the Emp.
Vespasian, who, however, afterwards restored it. ‘Bellas exteruis intacta
civilibus infelix‘ is the summary of its history by Tacitus. The Goths and
Lombards, especially King Agilulf, as. well as the subsequent conﬂicts
between Guelphs and Ghibellines, did great damage to the town. Cremons
espoused the cause of Frederick Barbarossa against Milan and Creme, and
subsequently came into the possession of the Visconti and of Francesco
Sforza (p. 111), after which it belonged to Milan. On 1st Feb., 1702,_Prince
Eugene surprised the French marshal Villeroi here and took him prisoner.
In 1799 the Austrians defeated the French here.

The manufacturers of the far-famed Vromxs and VIOLAB of Cremons
were Andrea Amati (ca. 1510-80) and Niccolo Amati (1596-1684), Antonio
Stradivart‘ (1644-1728) and Giuseppe Ant. Guarnen' (1683-1715).

PAINTING. Boccaccio Boccaccino (ca. 1460-1518), who for a time seems
to have belonged to the circle of Giov. Bellini (p. 288), in Venice, is gen-
erally regarded as the founder of the Gremona school of painting. The
frescoes of his assistants Altobello Malone and Gian Fram. Bsmbo show the
inﬂuence of Romanino (p. 200) and POrdenone (p. 268), who worked side
by side with them in the cathedral. The traditions of Boccaccino were
continued by his son, Gamma Boccacoino, and by Galeazzo Campi (d. 1535]-
The younger Campi, Giulio and Antonio, were mainly subject to the am?
of Giulio Romano. Cremona was the birthplace of Sofonisba d‘Anguisa'ola
(1535-1626), who, like her ﬁve sisters, practised the art of painting, and
was highly esteemed by her contemporaries. She afterwards retired to
Genoa, and even in her old age attracted the admiration of Van Dyck. ‘

In the PIAZZA DBL COMUNB (Pl. -F, 4) rises the Torrasso, a tower
397 ft. in height, erected in 1261-84, and connected with the cath-
edral by a series of loggc. Extensive view from the top. —— Oppo-
site the tower is the Gothic ‘Palazzo Pubbl-ico (new the Munictpio)
of 1245 (restored), containing a few pictures by masters of the
Cremona school and a rich marble chimney-piece by Pedone (1502}.
Adjacent is the Gothic Palarzo de’ Gonfalonicri or dc’ Giurecansulti,
of 1292.

The "CATHBDRAL (P1. F, 4), a vaulted structure in the Roman-
esque—Lombard style, erected in 1107-90, has a rich main facade
embellished with columns (partly remodelled in 1491) and tasteful
brick facades on the transepts, especially the S.
