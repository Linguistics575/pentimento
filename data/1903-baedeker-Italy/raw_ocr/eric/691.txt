(Creation, Fall, Death of Abel, Sacriﬁce of Noah, Nativi , Death and
Resurrection, Last Judgment) are by Pietro Benoenuti (1 . In six
niches below are the granite sarcOphagi of the rinces, some of them with
gilded bronze statues , from Cosimo I. (d. 157 ) to Cosimo III. (d. 1723;
comp. p. 399). On the c0ping round the chapel are placed the armorial
bearings of 16 Tuscan towns in exquisite stone-mosaic. A new ﬂoor was
begun in 1888. —- A sum of 22 million lire (about 880,0)01.) was expended
y the Medici family on the construction and decoration of this chapel.

The “New Sacristy (Sagrestia Nuooa; admission, see p. 437;
'50 0.), built by Michael Angelo for Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici (who
became Pope Clement VII. in 1523) in 1520-24, as a mausoleum
for the house of the Medici, is a simple quadrangular ediﬁce sur-
mounted by a dome and articulated by pilasters, can0pies, and re-
cesses. In form it corresponds with the old sacristy by Brunelleschi.
The sculptures with which it was to have been ﬁlled (monuments
to Lorenzo the Magniﬁcent and his brother Giuliano, Pepes Leol.
and Clement VII., and to the younger Giuliano and Lorenzo de‘
Medici) have been conﬁned to the monuments of the two last-named.
Giuliano de’ Medici (d. 1516), created Due de Nemours by the King
of France, and Lorenzo de’ Medici (d. 1519), who became Duke
of Urbino under Lee K. The great master worked at his task full
of bitter feelings at the abolition of the republic by Alessandro de’
‘Medici, and in 1534 left it unﬁnished, as he feared the tyrant’s
hate after the death of the Pope. In spite of these unfavourable cir—
cumstances Michael Angelo has here produced a congruous whole of
the greatest beauty. Architecture and sculpture are as harmonious
as if the master had modelled sarcOphagi and statues, cornices and
lniches, doors and windows out of one and the same clay.

presented as General of the Church, holding the commander‘s baton
in his hand. Full of proud conﬁdence and energy he gazes befOre him,

Day and Night, the latter especially admired. A contemporary poet, Gio-
yanni Battista Strozzi, wrote upon it the lines:

Michael Angelo, in allusion to the suppression of political liberty
(see above), answered:
