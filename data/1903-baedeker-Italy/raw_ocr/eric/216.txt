Rom. Bergiana, or Luna Nova, from its having succeeded the ancient
Luna, with the picturesque fortiﬁcation of Sarcanello, constructed
by Castruccio Castracani (d. 1328), was taken by the Florentines in

Charles VIII. of France. It subsequently belonged to Genoa. Sarzana,
the seat of a bishOp since 1204, was the birthplace of Pope Nicho-
