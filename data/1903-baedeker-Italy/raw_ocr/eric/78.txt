.BRIGUE. 2. Route. 3

(1160 ft.) the line traverses the Ohiuse, a narrow pass, fortiﬁed by
the Lombards, between the Monte Pirchiriano (3100 ft.; right) and
the Monte Caprasio (left), where Charlemagne defeated the Lombard

King Desiderius in 774.

A bridle-path ascends in 13/4 hr. from Sant‘ Ambrogio to the “Segra di
San lichele, a monastery founded in 999 upon the rocky summit of the
lonte Pirchiriano (Alb. Giacosa, clean, at San Pietro, 1/4 hr. from the top).
The monastery, enlarged by the Benedictines in the 12th cent., is now
occupied by a few Rosminian monks (p. 181). The Bcalone de‘ Marti, a
staircase hewn in the rock, ascends through the Porta dello Zodiaco
(Romanesque sculptures) to the Romanesque church, the spec of which
rests upon massive foundations, 75 ft. deep. Various scions of the House
of Savoy are interred in the crypt. The ﬁne view ranges over the valley
of Busa, the Alps, and the plain of Piedmont. Another bridle-path de—
scends to Aviguana.

At (485 M.) Avigliana, a medimval town with a large dynamite
factory, the valley expands into a broad plain. — 488 M. Rosta.

About 3 M. from Rosta lies the Abbazr'a di Sant‘ Antonio di Ranserso,
founded in 1188, with a Gothic facade of three gables. The high-altar—piece
is a Nativity, by Defendente do Ferrari; in the sacrlsty is a 15th cent. fresco
of the Bearing of the Cross.

499 M. Turin, see p. 25.

2. From Brigue over the Simplon to Domodossola.

40 M. Dimension from Brigue to'Domodossola twice daily in summer
in 9-91]: hrs. (fare 10 fr. 0, coupe 19 fr. 90 c.). Ex'rna Pos'r (landaus) with
two horses (8-8‘]: .hrs.) 91 fr. 80 c.; horses are changed three times (pre-
ferable to the carriages of the Brigue hotels).

Brigne (2245 ft.; Hotel des Oouronnes et Paste; Angteterre;
Terminus ﬁr Rail-way Restaurant), a well-built little town, with a
turrcted chateau , is the terminus of the railway (see Baedeher’s
Switzerland), and the beginning of the Simplon Route, constructed
by order of Napoleon in 1800-1806, which here quits the valley of

the Rhone, and ascends in numerous windings.

0n the left bank of the Rhone, 11/; M. above Brigue, is the N. entrance
of the Simplon Tunnel, the construction of which, begun at both the Swiss
and the Italian ends in Nov., 1898, is expected to take 51/2 years, at an
estimated cost of 69,500,000 fr. This tunnel, which is to be 121/, M. in
length, diﬁ‘ers from all similar constructions inasmuch as it consists of two
pardlel tunnels, 55 ft. apart but connected with each other by transverse
shafts at intervals of 220de. Only one of these tunnels is at present being
completely ﬁnished, the other being used for ventilation, for the supply of
water, and for the conveyance of the material and workmen. From the
N. entrance (2‘25!) ft.) the tunnel ascends at the radiant of 20 : 1000 to the
(53/. ll.) culminating point (2303 ft.), which lies 7 ft. below the mountain-
mrfaee above (between the Furg enbaumhorn and the Wasenhorn); then,
after remaining on the level for 50 yds., it descends (gradient 70: 1000) to
the (61/. M.) 8. entrance (2080ft.), at Iselle, in the valley of the Diveria
(p. 4). Ten or twelve hydraulic boring-machines are in Operation at either
end; visitors are admitted to the works on Tues. and Frid. at 3 p.m.
(tickets at Brigue Station, gratis).

9 M. Berisal (5005 ft.), the Third Refuge (Hetel de la Poste).
Above the Fourth Refuge (5645 ft.) a retrospect is obtained in
clear weather of the Bernese Alps to the N., from which the Aletsch
