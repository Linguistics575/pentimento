1m ITALIAN ART.

The condition of Italian art, that of painting at least, improved

to some extent towards the close of the 16th century, when thus
was a kind of second efﬂorescence, known in the schools as
553????“ the ‘revival of good taste’, which is said to have chieﬂy
° manifested itself in two directions , the eclectic and the na-
turalistic. But these are terms of little or no moment in the study
of art, and the amateur had better disregard them. This period of art
also should be studied historically. The principal architectural mon-
uments of the 17th century are the churches of the Jesuits, which
unquestionably produce a most imposing effect; but the historical
enquirer will not easily be dazzled by their meretrioious magni-
ficence. He will perceive the absence of organic forms and the
impropriety of combining totally different styles, and he will steel
himself against the gorgeous, but monotonous attractions of the
paintings and other works of the same period. The bright Renais-
sance is extinct, simple pleasure in the natural and human is ob-
. literated. A gradual change in the views of the Italian public and
in the position of the church did not fail to inﬂuence the tendencies
of art, and in the 17th century artists again devoted their energies
more immediately to the service of the church. Devotional pictures
now became more frequent, but at the same time a sensual, natural-
istic element gained ground. At one time it veils itself in beauty
of form, at another it is manifested in the representation of volup-
tuous and passionate emotions; classic dignity and noble symmetry
are never attained. Gmsrorono ALLonr’s Judith (p. 516) should be
compared with the beauties of Titian, and the frescoes of Amman]:
Cmaoal in the Palazzo Famese at Rome with Raphael’s ceiling-
paintings in the Farnesina, in order that the difference between the
16th and 17th centuries may be clearly understood; and the enquirer
will be still farther aided by consulting the coeval Italian poetry, and
observing the development of the lyric drama or opera. The poetry of
the period thus furnishes a key to the mythological representations
of the School of the Carracci. Gems of art, however, were not un-
frequently produced during the 17th century, and many of the frescoes
of this period are admirable, such as those by Gmno Rum and
Domamonnvo at Rome. Beautiful oil-paintings by various masters
are also preserved in the galleries of Bologna (p. 362), Naples, and
elsewhere. The so-called gallery-pieces, ﬁgures and scenes desig-
nated by imposing titles, and painted in the prevailing taste of the
17th century, were readily received, and indeed most appropriately
placed in the palaces of the nobles. This retreat of art to the privacy
of the apartments of the great may be regarded as a symptom of the
universal withdrawal of the Italians from public life. Artists, too,
henceforth occupy an isolated position, unchecked by public opinion,
exposed to the caprices of amateurs, and themselves inclined to an
arbitrary department. Several qualities , however, still exist of
which Italian artists are never "entirely divested; they retain a
