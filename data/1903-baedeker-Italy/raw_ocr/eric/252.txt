the life of St. Peter Martyr, the Annunciation, and the Assam tion, prob-
ably by Vine. Poppa. —— In the sacristy is a Penitent 8t. erome, by
Boraognone. — The adjacent convent is now a barrack.

We follow the street to the Porta Ticincsc (Pl. D, 8), originally
intended to commemorate the Battle of Marengo, but inscribed in
1815 ‘Paci Populorum Sospitae’. We then turn to the E. and skirt
the city-walls to the Porta Lodovica (Pl. E, 8), whence we follow
the 00330 SAN Gano (P1. E, 8, 7), to the left, to the church of
Santa Maria presso San Celso (P1. E, 8), built in the Renaissance
style by Giov. Dolccbuono after 1490. It possesses a handsome
atrium (1514), groundlessly attributed to Bramantc, and a rich
facade by Galeazzo Alcssi (1569-72). On the right and left of the
portal are Adam and Eve by Stoldo Lorenai.

The INTERIOR is in the form of a basilica with barrel-vaulting over
the nave, a dodecagonal cupola, and an ambulatory. By the 2nd altar to '
the right, Holy Family and 8t. Jerome, by Paris Bot-done; Gauderm‘o Fer-
rari, Baptism of Christ (behind the high-altar); at the beginning of the
left aisle, Borg'ognons, Madonna and saints; below it, Bassoferrato, Madonna.
The 2nd chapel on the left contains a sarcophagus with the relics of St. Cel-
sus. The cupola is decorated with frescoes by Apptam’ (1795). -— In the
sacristy are some ﬁne specimens of goldsmith‘s work.

Adjacent is the Romanesque church of San Celso, docked of its
W. half in 1826 and now possessing few remains of the original
structure. Altar-piece by Moretto: Conversion of St. Paul.

At the N. end of the Corso San Celso is the Piazza Sant’ Eu-
fcmia, in which, to the right, stands the church of that name (Pl. E,7),
dating from the 5th cent., and recently restored. In the third
chapel on the left is a Madonna with saints and angels, by Marco
d’ Oggiono. — A little to the S. is the church of San Paolo, a richly
ornamented and characteristic building of the middle of the 16th
century. The architectural decorations of the facade already i1-
lustrate the principles of the later baroque style, and this is seen
even more strongly in the interior, which is adorned with frescoes
by the brothers Giulio, Antonio, and Vincenzo Oampi of Gremona.

The Via Amedei leads hence towards the N. to Sant’ Alessandro
(Pl. E, 6), erected about 1602 by Lor. Binago, a reduced and in
the interior successful copy of St. Peter’s at Rome, with two W.
towers. The sumptuous decorations date from the close of the
17th century. High-altar adorned with precious stones. -—-Adjacent
is the Palazzo Trivulzio, with a handsome baroque portal. This
palazzo (adm. by special introduction only) contains a valuable art-
eollection, in which the most noteworthy objects are the tomb of
Azzone Visconti (1328-39) from San Gottardo; the statuette of a
Warrior, being a bronze c0py of one of the ﬁgures of Leon. da Vinci’s
ﬁrst model for the equestrian monument to Franc. Sforza (p. 117);
a relief-portrait by Cristoforo Solari; a portrait by Antonello da
Marina; and a Madonna by Mantegna (1497). The extensive
library contains a Dante codex of 1337, a MS. of Leonardo da
Vinci, and other rarities.
