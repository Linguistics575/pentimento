The old Town Wall is intact except near the lake; on the S.E.
side are three well-preserved towers, that in the middle, the Ports
Torre, now known as the Porta Vittoria, being a massive ﬁve-storied
structure. Outside the gate, in the Piazza Vittoria, is a bronze Statue
of Garibaldi, by Vela (1889). —- In the .Viale Varese, a promenade
shaded with plane-trees and skirting the S.W. town-wall, is the
church of Santtsstma Annumiata, of the 17th cent., also known
as the Chiesa dcl Croccﬁsso, from a miraculous image.

Farther on, on the slope of the mountain on the other side of the
Costa, is the ﬁne old Basilica Sant’ Abbondio, originally a Lombard
structure of the 8th cent., rebuilt in the 11th cent., and restored in
1863—88. Beneath it the remains of a church of the 5th cent. have
been found.
