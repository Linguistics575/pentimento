Min, and, after the Carlovingian epoch, Berengarius 1., ruled here. Verona
afterwards headed the league of Venetian cities against Frederick Barba-
rasss. During the ﬁerce contests between Guel he and Ghibellines the
terrible Esselino da Romano (d. 1259) endeavours to establish a lordship
at Verona. The year after Easelino‘s death Martino delta Beale, another
Ghibelline, was elected Podesta. The Scaligers, the great princes of his
house, inaugurated a glorious period for the city. Mastino was assassinated
in 1277, but his brother and successor Albert secured the supremacy of
his line. Romeo and Juliet are said to have loved and died in the reign
ofAlbert‘s son Bartolomeo (1301-04). The greatest member of this illus—
trious family was Can Francesco, or ‘ Can Grands I.‘ (1312-29) who captured
Vicenza and subdued Padua after a long struggle. His brilliant court
numbered Dante among its guests. Mastino 11. (1329-51) at ﬁrst conquered
Brescia, Farms, and Lucca, but his rule was afterwards restricted to
Verona and Vicenza by a league fermed by Florence Venice, and Milan.
Gas Grands 1]., his successor, was murdered by his brother Gan Signor-in
i111”; and in 1387 the latter’s son Antonio, who had also endeavoured
to secure his possession by fratricide, was expelled by Gian Galeaszo Vis-
costi, Lord of Milan. Through the widow of Visconti the town passed in
1105 to the Venetians, to whom with short interruptions, it remained
‘ subject down to the end of the heypublic.

In the history of Aneurrno'ruaa erona is important, both on account of
itsmedieeval buildings, and as the birthplace of Fra Giocondo (ca. 1436-1514),
one of the most famous architects of the early Renaissance whose works
are to be found at Venice, Paris, Treviso (fortiﬁcations), an Rome, and as
the home of Michele Sanmicheli (1484-1559), who sought to unite the beauty
of the Ionic order with the grim strength of military fortiﬁcations and
adorned the city with a series of sumptuous ediﬁces. In judging of the
Verona palaces, we must bear in mind that it was customary here, as at

, various other towns of the Venetian ‘terra ferma’, to adorn the facades
with paintings. The painted facades of houses near San Fermo, by the
Ports Borsari in Piazza delle Erbe, and others partly recall the Paduan
style of the 16th century. — The earlier Veronese Pamrans of the second
half of the 14th cent. were an erior especially in colouring to the Floren-
tine school of Giotto and he] themselves clear of its‘inﬁuence. The chief
of these masters was Aliichieri, to whom is ascribed the fresco in Bant‘
Anastasia (p. 225), the only monument of the period in Verona (other free-
coes in Padua, see p. 251). A new period of importance began in the 15th
century. Among the chief masters were Vittore Pisano (d. ca. 1451), the
celebrated medallist; Liberals da Verona, especially noteworthy for his
miniatures; Dummies and his son Franc. Morons,- Francesco Garcia (14.70-
1546)- Girolamo dai Libri (1474-1556); and Paolo ﬁlm-undo, surnamed Ca-
razzoia (1486-1522). The artistic family of the Bonifazios, though originating
in Verona, ﬂourished mainly in Venice. On the other hand Paolo Oaiidri,
anrnamed Veronese (1528-88) also resident in Venice, owed his artistic
development mainly to the inﬂuence of his native place. -— In the history
of SCULPTURE Verona also holds a place of some importance, as is evidenced
by the Romanesque reliefs on the facade of San Zeno (p. 229), the font
of San Giovanni in Fonte (p. 226), and the Gothic monuments of the Sea-
ligers (p. 225).
