162 Route 22. BORMIO.

The HIGH Roan ascends along the vine-clad slo as to Bernie (2083 ft.).
To the N. rises the precipitous Home Hasuces'o 0 it), a landslip from
which in 1807 blocked up the narrow channel of the Adda, and converted
the. valley as far as Tovo into a vast lake. At (8 M.) Mano the road
crosses to the right bank of the Adda, and beyond Grosotto (1965 ft.; Alb.
Pini) it crosses the Roasco which here issues from the Val Grose'na. To
the left, at the mouth of1 the latter, is the imposing ruined castle of
Venosla. Beyond Grosto the road recrosses to the left bank. — 6 M. —

12 M. Bolladore (2840 ft.; Pasta or Angela, R. ilk-21]: fr.:, Hotel des
Alpes, well spoken of). On the mountain-slope to the N. rises the church
of Sandals. The valley contracts; the southern vegetation disappears;
far below rushes the grey glacier-water of the Adda. 13'/2 M. Mondadizza,
'with a curious old church. At (15 M.) Le Press (3110 ft. :, inn) we again cross
the Adda. We then enter the deﬁle of Berra di Horignons, about 31/: M.
in length, which separates the Val Tellina from the region of Bormio.
In 1859 the Pants 'del Diaeolo was the scene of an engagement between
Austrians and Garibaldiaus. At the end of the pass, in the green Valle
di Sotto, lie the hamlets of Morignone and (farther on) Sant’ Antonio.

Beyond (18‘I2 M‘.) Ceppina (Osteria Piccagnoni) we reach the level green
valley (Piano) of Bormio, enclosed by lofty mountains, the lower elapse
of which are clothed with pines, and the upper in part with snow. At
Santa Lucia (3340 ft.) we cross the Frodolfo just above its conﬂuence with
the Adda. The road runs to the N.E. to (91/: M.) —

251/2 M. Bormio, Ger. Worms (4020 ft.; Pasta or Lem d‘Oro; Alb.
della Torre, R. 112, B. 1/2 fr., moderate), an antiquated little Italian town

the entrance to the Val Furva. — The diligence goes on hence, ascendingr
the winding Stelvio route, to the —

271/2 M. Bagni di Bormio. The New Baths (Bagni Nuoes'; 4380 ft.), a
handsome building surrounded with gardens on a terrace commanding a
ﬁne survey of the valley of Bormio and the surrounding mountains, are
much frequented in July and Aug. (at the ‘Hotel, R. d: A. 3-5, L. 1/2,
B. 11/2, D. 4, S. 3, pens. 8-12 fr.) and are closed from the middle of Oct
(Engl. Church Service in summer). The Bagm' Veccht', or Old Baths of
Bormio, are a little higher up (4750 ft.), perched on the rocks below the
road; a picturesque footpath, shorter than the road, ascends to them in
'/4 hr. (good hotel, less expensive than the New Baths). The seven springs,
containing salt and sulphur (NO-105° Fahr.), rise in the Dolomite cliffs
near the old baths, whence the water is conducted to the new baths in
pipes. They are mentioned by Pliny and Cassiodorus. The old Roman
baths (pacine) hewn in the rock are interesting. —- From Bormio over
