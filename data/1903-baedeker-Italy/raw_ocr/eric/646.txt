Cathedral Museum. FLORENCE. 68. Route. 455

Farther on, at the corner of the Via dell’ Orivolo (p. 466), is the
Pataazo Riccardi, formerly Guadagni (Pl. F, 4, 5).

Opposite the choir of the cathedral is situated the Opera del
Duomo (Pl. F, 4; No. 24, entrance to the left in the court). Here
was opened in 1891 the IIICathedral Huseum, or Muaeo di Santa
Maria del Fiore, containing chieﬂy works of art from the cathedral
and the baptistery (adm., see p. 437). Lists of the works of art are
supplied for the use of visitors. Catalogue (1891) 1/2 fr.

GROUND FLOOR. In the vestibule, a bust of Brunelleschi, after
his death-mask, by his pupil Buggiano. Above the door (left), St. Ze—
nobius between two angels, a ﬁne coloured relief from the studio
of Luca delta Robbia (ca. 1450). — The hall contains numerous
architectural fragments: also 40. Figure of the Madonna, by a
master of the Plaan School [13th cent.); 51. (by the staircase),
Etruscan relief. — On the staircase are reliefs from the choir—screen
of the cathedral, by Baccio Bandinetti and Giovanni datl’ Opera.

Fms'r FLOOR. In the large hall, on the end-walls (71 to the right,
and 72 to the left), are the *SINGING GALLERIES (Cantorie) from the
cathedral, with the celebrated reliefs of children by Luca delta
Robbia (1431-38) and Donatello (1433-38), taken down in 1688 and
put together again, with additions, in 1890 by Luigi del More. The
na'ive charm of childhood has probably never been better expressed
than in the ten clearly and beautifully arranged I""Grronps of singing
ind dancing boys and girls by Luca della Robbia, which are equally
Lttractive for their truth and naturalness and for their grace of
novement and form. The four *Reliefs of dancing Genii by Dona-
ello are full of vigour and expression, but meant to be seen from
r distance. In their exuberant vigour, they present a very signi-
lcant specimen of the master’s work. — Also on the right end-
vall: 108. Intarsia Tablet, representing St. Zenobius between two
leacons, by Giuliano da Majano. —-— On the left side-wall: De Fabris’
dodel for the facade of the Cathedral; 77. Relief of the Madonna, by

he right side-wall: 9‘2, 93. St. Reparata and Christ, marble statuettes
ry Andrea Pisano; 94. Madonna, a relief by Portigiani; 95, 96. An-
runciation, group by Niccolo d’Arezzo. «— ‘97. Massive Silver Altar
