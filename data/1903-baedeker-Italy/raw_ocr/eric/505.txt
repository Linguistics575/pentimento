Fame (170 ft.), situated on the river Par-ma, a small tributary
of the Po, the capital of a province (formerly a duchy), is a town of
entirely modern appearance, but of very ancient origin, with broad
streets , and 48,523 inhabitants. It is a bishop’s see and possesses
a university founded in 1422. .

The foundation of Parma is probably to be ascribed to the consul
M. Emilius (B.C. 183), though the discovery of a lake-dwelling of the
bronze period in 1864 proves that a human settlement existed here in pre-
historic times. The town offered a determined resistance to the attacks
of the Ligurians, but it was destroyed by Mark Antony as the birthplace
of Cassius, one of Caesar‘s murderers. Under Augustus, who named it
Colonist Julia Augusta Parma it attained to new prosperity; and repeated
devastations in the early middle ages proved only temporary checks to
the growth of its importance, which arose mainly from its woollen
manufactories. Parma participated in the general development of the
towns of U per Italy, zealously espoused the cause of the Guelphﬂa
and in 1247 was long unsuccessfully besieged by Emp. Frederick 11.
In 1303 Giberto da Correggio obtained possession of the supreme power.
In 1348, after various vicissitudes, Parma came into the hands of the
Viecontz‘, and from that period down to 1512 it was generally united with
the Duchy of Milan. In 154.5, after it had been annexed to the States of
,the Church, it was presented by Pope Paul 111., with Piacenza, to his
infamous son Pier Luigi Furnace. This prince was assassinated in 1547,
and was succeeded by seven dukes of his family, including W
Far-nae (1586-92), who took part in the battle of Lepanto (1571;I and after-
wards attained great military distinction as Viceroy of the ether-lands
under Philip II. The male line became extinct in 1731. Elizabeth, the
daughter and sole heiress of Duke Ranuccio II. (d. 169-1), was married to
King Philip V. of Spain, and by the quadruple alliance concluded at London
in 1718, the succession was secured to their son Charles, who, however:
ascended the throne of Naples in 1734, and deprived Parma of -many
treasures of art which now grace the national museum at Naples. 3!
the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 the duchy was ceded by Austria ‘0
