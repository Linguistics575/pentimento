CHIAVENNA. 4. Route. 15

From Pianaaao a road ascends to the N.E. to (ill. M.) Madesimo
(1920 ft.), a prettily situated village with a chalybeate spring and a i'Hydro-
panic.

34 M. Campodolcino [3456 ft.; Croce d‘0ro) consists of four
large groups of houses. The second contains the church. The Liro
Valley ( Vane San Giacomo) is strewn with fragments of rock, but
the wildness of the scene is softened by the luxuriant foliage of
the chestnuts lower down, from which rises the slender campanile
of the church of Gauivaggio. Beyond San Giacomo the rich luxuriance
of Italian vegetation unfolds itself to the view.

Chiaeenna (1090 ft.), the Roman Giovanna, an ancient town
with 4100 inhab., is charmingly situated on the Mora, at the mouth
of the Val Brogaglia, through which the road to the Maloja Pass and
the Engadine leads to the E. Opposite the Hotel Conradi are the
ruins of an unﬁnished palace ofDe Salts, the last governor appointed
by the Grisons. Picturesque view from the castle—garden or ‘Paradiso’
[adm. 50 c.). — San Lorenzo, the principal church, has a slender
clock-tower or campanile, rising from an arcaded enclosure which
was formerly the burial-ground. The octagonal Banisterio (closed;
fee 15-20 c.) contains a font of 1206, adorned with reliefs.

The RAILWAY 'ro COL‘ico (fares, see p. 14) traverses three tun-
nels soon after starting, beyond which we enjoy a ﬁne retrospect of
Chiavenna. Rich vine-bearing country. The valley (Piano di Chia—
arena) is enclosed on both sides by lofty mountains. The lower-
lylng districts are eXposed to the inundations of the Liro and More,
which unite below Ohiavenna. 0n the right bank of the More lies
Gordona, at the mouth of the Val delta Forcola, beyond which
the Boggia forms a pretty waterfall in its precipitous descent
from the narrow Val Bodengo. -— 6 M. Samolaco is the station for
the large village of that name on the opposite (right) bank of the
More, at the mouth of the Val Mengasca. Near (81/2 M.) Novatc
(.llcscola) the railway reaches the Lago di Mezzola (650 ft), originally
the N. bay of the Lake of Como, from which it has been almost
separated by the deposits of the Adda. The narrow channel which
connects the lakes has again been rendered navigable. To the
S. appears the pyramidal Monte Legnone (p. 160). The railway,
iillpported by masonry and traversing tunnels, crosses the Adda
