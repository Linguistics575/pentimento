was originally intended for a monument to Hercules 1., and in 1810—
14 bore a statue of Napoleon. On the S. side of the piazza is the Pal.
Zatti, and on the W. side the Pal. Bcoilacqua, the latter with a ﬁne
oolonnaded court.

The church of San Cristoforo (Pl. E, F, 2; adm. Sun. & Thurs.
only, free), in the Campo Santa, formerly a Carthusian monastery,
is a handsome Renaissance building (1498-1553). The cemetery
contains a bust of the art-historian Count Leopoldo Cicognara
[1776-1834) by Ganova, and several tasteful modern monuments
by 'l‘enerani, Tadolini, Bartolini, and others.

The church of Santa Maria delta Rosa (P1. 0, D, 3), in the Via
degli Armari, contains (1st chapel to the left) a PietA, with eight
painted terracotta ﬁgures, by Guido Mazzoni (p. 356).

The Chicsa del Gesa (Pl. D, E, 4) possesses a good painting by
Gius. Maria Crespi (‘lnd altar on the right), representing the Swoon
of St. Stanislaus. Beneath the choir-gallery is the handsome tomb
of Barbara d’Austria (d. 1572), second wife of Alphonso lI. — Close
by is the Palmo Oriapi (Pl. D, 4), a digniﬁed late-Renaissance
building by Girol. da Carpi (?).

The Hosrrrar. or 81‘. ANNA (Pl. D, E, 4) is interesting as the
place where Tasso was kept in conﬁnement from 1579 to 1586, by
order of Alphonso II., on account of his mental alienation. A cell
is shown in which he is said to have been incarcerated, with the
.names of Byron, Lamartine, and other poets written on the walls.
—— Adjoining the hospital is the Casino dci Negoaianti, formerly Pal.
Roverclla, erected in 1508, with an elegant early-Renaissance facade.

At the end of the Corso della Giovecca, to the right, stands the
Palomino (new a smith’s forge), a garden-pavilion, retaining traces
of decorative paintings of the school of Dosso Dossi (1559).
