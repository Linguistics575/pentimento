34 Route 7. TURlN. - Northern

(p. 136). Over the second altar on the right is an altar-piece (Madonna
and saints) by Defendente de Ferrari (restored in 1899). Frescoes on the ceil-
ing modern. The seats of the royal family are to the left of the high-altar.

Behind the high-altar is the Oappella del Bantissimo Budario or delta
Sants'uima Student (Open during morning mass till 9 o‘clock; reached by
37 steps to the right of the high-altar), constructed in 1694 by Gum-ind.
It is a lofty circular chapel of dark brown marble, contrasting strongly
with the white monuments, separated from the choir by a glass partition,
and covered with a curiously shaped dome. The monuments were erected
by King Charles Albert in 1842 to the memory of illustrious members of
his family: (r.) Emmanuel Philibert (d. 1580), ‘restitutor imperii‘, by Pompeo
Marchesi; Prince Thomas (d. 1656), ‘qui magno animo italicam libertatem
armis adseruit nec prius dimicare destitit quam vivere‘, by Gag ' 5 Charles
Emmanuel II. ((1. 1675), by Fraccaroli; Amadeus VIII. (d. 1 1), by Cac-
ciatori. The peculiar light from above enhances the eﬂ'ect. In a kind
of urn over the altar is preserved the Bantissimo Sudan-to or W
Sindone, a part of the linen cloth in which the body of the Saviour is
said to have been wrapped. This was brought from Cyprus to Chambéry
in 1452 and since 1578 has been preserved at Turin.

From the Piazza San Giovanni we pass to the W. through the
Via Quattro Marzo to the Palszzo di Citta (see below). A mon-
ument, by 0. Tabacchi, at the intersection of this street with the
Via Ports Palatina, commemorates G. B. Bottero. —- In the N. por-
tion of the Via Porta Palatine rises the Ports Palatina, or Palazzo
delle Tom' (Pi. F, 2; p. 27), ‘a Roman gateway with two sixteen-
sided brick towers, now ﬁtted up as a drawing-school. — At the
S. end of the street, to the right, is the church of Corpus Domini
(P1. D, E, 2), erected in 1610 by Ascanio Vittozei, on the site of a
chapel built in 1543 to commemorate a miracle of the Host (1521).
The interior was altered in 1753. — In the adjacent church of Santa
Spirito, dating from 1610 and restored in 1743, Rousseau, an exile
from Geneva, at the age of 16, became a Roman Catholic in 1728,
but he again professed Calvinism at Geneva in 1754.

The Piazza del Palazzo di Cittz‘i, a few paces to the W., is
adorned with a monument to Amadeus VI. (P1. 21), the ‘Conte
.Verde’ (p. 24), conqueror of the Turks and restorer of the imperial
throne of Greece (d. 1383), a bronze group by Palagi (1853).

The Palazso di Oitta (Pl. D, 2), or town-hall, was erected by
Lanfranchi in 1669. The marble statues beside the entrance of (1.)
Prince Eugene (d. 1736; by Simonetta) and (1.) Prince Ferdinand
(d. 1855; by Dini), Duke of Genoa and brother of Victor Emman-
uel 11., were erected in 1858; that of King Charles Albert (d. 1849),
by Cauda, in the colonnade to the left, was erected in 1859; that of
King Victor Emmanuel 11. (d. 1878), by Vela, to the right, in 1860.

The Via Milano leads hence to the N. to the church of San Do—
menico (Pl. 8, D 2; founded in 1354 and frequently restored),
which contains a Madonna and St. Dominic by Guercino; and the
Via Corte d’Appello to the W. to Piazza Savou (P1. D, 2), in
which rises an obelisk, 75 ft. in height, commemorating the aboli—
tion of ecclesiastical jurisdiction by the minister Siccardi in 1850.
—— A few yards to the W., in the Via del Carmine, is the Chiesa
del Carmine (Pl. 1; C, D, 2), designed by Juvara (modern facade).
