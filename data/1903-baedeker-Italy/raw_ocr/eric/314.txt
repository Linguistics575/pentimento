station, is embellished with a monument to Victor Emmanuel 11.,
by Gius. Antonini (1862). Behind the high-altar of the collegiate
church of San Gaudenaio is a picture in six sections (Marriage of
St. Catharine, Pieta, and Saints) by Gaud. Ferrari (ca. 1471 -1546),
a native of the neighbouring Val Duggia. The church of Santa
Maria delle Grazie, at the approach to the Sacro Monte, contains a
series of 21 l’Scenes from the life of Christ (1507-13; road-screen)
and other frescoes (left aisle) by this master, while there is also an
Adoration of the Child by him over the portal of the church of
Santa Maria di Loreto, about 3/, M. from the village. A marble statue
of Ferrari (1884) stands in the Piazza Ferrari.

The building of the Societd per l’Incoraggiamento alle Belle
Arti, in the Via del Santuario, contains a small picture-gallery and
some natural history collections. In the Piazza Nuova is the read-
ing-room of the Varallo branch of the Italian Alpine Club (strangers
welcome). — 0n the Mastallone bridge is a statue of General
Giacomo Antonim‘ (1891). Beyond the bridge are the I"r‘ltabilime'nto
1droterapico, a large and well-equipped hydropathic (Open from
May ist to Oct. 15th; pens. 9-11 fr.), with a swimming-bath, and

the Cotom'ﬁcio Ouorgné- Varallo, a cotton-Spinning mill.

The *Saero Monte (Santaarr‘o dt Varallo; 1995 ft.), a frequented pilgrim-
resort, rising in the immediate vicinity of. the town, is ascended from Santa
[aria delle Grazie (see above) in 2) min. by a paved path shaded by
beautiful chestnuts, and commands a delightful view. This ‘Nuooa Germa-
lem ml Sacro Honte dt Varallo’ was founded in 1486 by Bernardino
Caimi, a Milanese nobleman and Franciscan monk, with the sanction of
Pope Innocent VIII.; but as a resort of pilgrims it did not become im-
portant until after the visits of Cardinal Borromeo (p. 169). -— On the tap
0f the hill and on its slopes are a church and 45 Cnarnns, or oratories,
containing scenes from sacred history in painted lifesiae figures of terra-
cotta, with supplementary frescoes, beginning with the Fall in the lat
chapel, and ending with the Entombment of the Virgin in the 45th. These
are the work of Gaudenzio Ferrari (No. 5. The Magi, ‘38. Cruciﬁxion),
his pupil Bern. Lanini, Tabacchetti (d. 1615), Morazzono, Gian. d’Enrt'co
d‘Alagma (d. 1644), and other more modern and less gifted artists. The
handsome Cannon, built by Pellegrino Tibaldi after 1578 at Card. Borro-
meo‘s expense has a modern fagade. In the dome is a plastic represen-
tation of the Assumption, with about 150 ﬁgures, by Bossola and Volpim'
of Milan. On the top, adjoining the church, are the Albergo-Pemion Alpine:
and a Cafe.
