criminate confusion of Greek and Roman styles is no longer to be
GREEK A“ apprehended. We are now well aware that the highest per-
Romuz fection of ancient architecture is realised in the HELLENIC
STYLES DIS- temple alone. The Doric order, in which majestic gravity is
“"9""“9' expressed by massive proportions and by a symmetrical de-
coration, which at the same time subserves a practical purpose,
and the Ionic structure, with its lighter and more graceful char-
acter, exhibit a creative spirit entirely diﬁerent from that mani-
fested in the sumptuous Roman ediﬁces. Again, the most valuable
collection of ancient sculptures in Italy is incapable of aﬂording so
admirable an insight into the development of Greek art as the sculp-
tures of the Parthenon and other fragments of Greek temple-archi-
tecture preserved in the British Museum. But, while instruction is
afforded more abundantly by other than Italian sources, ancient art
is perhaps thoroughly admired in Italy alone , where works of art
encounter the eye with more appropriate adjuncts, and where climate,
scenery, and people materially contribute to intensify their impres-
siveness. An additional facility, moreover, is afforded by the circum—
stance , that in accordance with an admirable custom of classic
antiquity the once perfected type of a plastic ﬁgure was not again
arbitrarily abandoned, but rigidly adhered to, and continually re-
produced. Thus in numerous cases, where the more ancient Greek
original had been lost, it was preserved in subsequent copies; and-
even in the works of the Roman imperial age Hellenic creative talent
is still reﬂected.
This supremacy of Greek intellect in Italy was established in a
Gannon twofold manner. In the ﬁrst place Greek colonists intro-
surnnmr rs duced their ancient native style into their new homes. This
A“. is proved by the existence of several Doric temples in Sicily,
by the so-called Temple of Neptune at Paestum, as well as by the
ruins at Mctapontum. But, in the second place, the art of the Greeks
did not attain its universal supremacy in Italy till a later period,
when Hellas, nationally ruined, had learned to obey the dictates of
her mighty conqueror, and the Romans had begun to combine with
their political superiority the reﬁnements of more advanced culture.
The ancient scenes of artistic activity in Greece (Athens for example)
became re—people'd at the cost of Rome; Greek works of art and
Greek artists were introduced into Italy; and ostentatious pride in
the magniﬁcence of booty acquired by victory led by an easy transi-
tion to a taste for such objects. To surround themselves with artistic
decoration thus gradually became the universal custom of the R0-
mans, and the foundation of public monuments came to be regarded
as an indispensable duty of government. .
Although the Roman works of art of the imperial epoch are
Roman deﬁcient in originality compared with the Greek , yet their
Anonr'rnc- authors never degenerate into mere copyists, or entirely re-
TUBE- nounce independent eﬂ'ort. This remark applim especially to
