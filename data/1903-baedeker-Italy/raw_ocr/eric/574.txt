The celebrated Pine Forest of Ravenna, or La Pinata, which ex-
isted in the time of Odoacer and has been extolled by Dante, Boc-
caccio, Dryden, and Byron, begins about 13/, M. beyond the church
of S. Apollinare (cab there and back 6 fr.). The severe winter of
1879-80 and a oonﬂagration seriously injured it, but new trees have
been planted.

About 2 M. to the 8. of Bavenna, on the bank of the House, rises the
Colonna dt Gaston ds Fair, erected in 1557, a memorial of the victory gained
on 11th April, 1512, by the united armies of Louis XII. of France and
Duke Alphonso I. of Fer-rare (at which the poet Ariosto was present) over
the Spanish troops and those of Pope Julius 11. At the moment when the
victory was decided, the brave Gaston de Foix fell ( . 131). ,

Trajan built an Aqueduct to supply Bavenna wit water from the moun-
tains near (20 II.) Teodorano. Some remains of this structure, which was
restored by Theodoric, may be seen in dry weather in the bed of the Ronco
at San Bartolomeo, a little above Ravenna.
