Quarters. . TURIN. 7. Route. 35

The Via della Consolata leads from the Piazza Savoia to the N.
to the church of La Consolata. At the S. end of this street (No. 1)
is the Palazzo Paesana (P1. 45; D, 2), built in the 18th cent. by
Planter-i, a pupil of Juvara, with an imposing hall and staircase.

La Consolata (P1. 2; D, 2), formed by the union of three
churches, is a building in the baroque style, erected by Guarini in
1679, and decorated by Juvara in 1714. The oval church of Sant’
Andrea is adjoined by a Campanile (10th cent. ‘2), a relic of the
convent of Sant’ Andrea, and beyond the hexagonal Santuario della
Consolata, which contains a highly revered Madonna, we enter a
circular Sacristy , forming the third member of the group. The
passage on the right is hung with votive pictures. A new chapel
to the left contains kneeling statues in marble of Maria Theresa,
Queen of Charles Albert, and Maria Adelaide, Queen of Victor Em-
manuel 11. (both of whom died in 1855), by Vela, erected in 1861.

A little to the N.E., and intersected by the Corso Regina Mar gherita,
lies the Puzza EHANUEBE Frusnnro (Pl. D, E, 1, 2), adjoined on the N.
by the Piazza dei Molini. To the N. of the latter runs the Via Ponte
liosca (Pl. E, 1), on the right side of which is the church of San Gtoachino
(P1, 12), a basilica in the Lombard style, with a campanile 150 ft. high
erected in 1876-82 by Count Oeppi. -— The street then crosses the Dam
Riparia by the Pants Hosea, a handsome bridge of one arch, constructed
in 1830, and affordng a ﬁne view of the Superga and of the Graian Alps.

 

From the Piazza Castello (p. 28) the Via Garibaldi leads to the
PIAZZA DBLLO STATUTO (Pl. 0, 2), with the huge Mont Cenis Tunnel
Monument, by Tabacchi (1879): the Genius of Science soars above
a pile of granite rocks, on which lie the stupeﬂed and conquered
giants of the mountain. On a tablet are the names of the engineers.

From the Via Garibaldi we proceed to the S. by the Corso Sic-
cardi to the Giardino della Cittadella (Pl. 0, D, 2), where statues
were erected in 1871 to Broﬁ‘erio (d. 1866), poet and radical poli-
tician, and opposite, in 1873, to the jurist G. B. Cassinis. '—
Farther on, at the corner of the Via della Cernaia, is a monument
by Gina. Bogliani (1834) in memory of Pietro M icca (P1. 35; O, 3),
the heroic ‘soldato minatore’, who at the sacriﬁce of his own life
saved the citadel of Turin, on 30th Aug., 1706, by springing a mine
when the French grenadiershad already advanced to the very gates. ,
Nearly opposite is a bust of Al. Borclla, the author, and in the Via
della Cernaia rises the statue of General Alex. Lamarmora (d. 1855
in the Crimea), by Cassano (1867).

The Maschio della Oittadella (P1. 20; 0, 3) is the former en-
trance to the citadel, erected in 1565 and nearly all pulled down
in 1857. A marble tablet above the gateway commemorates the
Italian soldiers who fell in Africa in 1887. The interior accommod-
ates the Museo Nationals d’Artiglicrt’a, a collection of ordnance from
the 14th cent. to the present day; adm. only by permission from '
the ‘Direzione dell’ Ofﬁcina di Gostruzione d’Artiglieria’.
