e. Circonvallosiom a Monte. GENOA. {6. Route. 85

A steep aved path, beginning at the Trattoria dei Cacciatori, a little
git]? (1:. 82) the Hotel Righi, descends in 20 min. to the church of San
ice 0 . . -
The older line of roads, diverging to the left at the Spienata Costel-
letto (p. 84), is known as the Via dt' Oirconvallaziom a Home Injectors.
The ﬁrst part of it, named the Como Carbonara, leads to the Albergo def
Pacer-i or oar-house (Pl. D, E, 1, 2; 300 ft. above the sea), which has
room for £300 persons. It then takes the name of Oorso Ddgalz' and re-
joins the main thoroughfare at the Castello d‘Albertis, adjoining the up-
per entrance to the Botanic Garden (p. 80).

The *Campo Santa or Cimitcro di Staglimo (open daily 9—6, in
winter 10-6; electric line 6, p. 68) is reached from the Piazza Mao
nin (p. 84) by the new Via Montaldo, which leaves the city by the
Porto San Bartolomeo (Pl. I, 3, 4) and then descends (views) to the
N. into the Valley of the Bisagno and to Staglieno (p. 336). About
1/2101. farther on (11/3 M. from the town) is the entrance to the
cemetery, which was laid out by Resasco in 1844—51 and stretches
up the slope on the N. bank of the Bisagno. We ﬁrst enter a large
rectangular space, with sumptuous single monuments in the recesses
of the arcades, and beyond that is an oval space, with rows of
monuments in the recesses. Flights of steps and broad inclined
planes lead up to the upper galleries, the central point of which is a
rotunda, with a dome borne by monolithic columns of black marble.
Above the rotunda, to the N.E., close to the steep hillside, is the
tomb of Giuseppe Mazzini (d. 1872). —— In returning, we may use

17. From Genoa to Ventimiglia. Riviera di Ponente.

94 M. RAILWAY in 43/437 hrs. (fares 17 fr. 155, 12 fr. 25, 7 fr. 90 c.; ex-
.press 19 fr. 30. 13 fr. 50 c.). The ‘train de luxe‘ from Vienna to Cannes
(1). 20) performs the journey in about 4 hrs. (1st class fare 25 fr. 90c.).
In winter a dining-car (déj. 31/2, D. 41/2 fr.) is attached to the ﬁrst ex-
press from Genoa and the noon express from Ventimiglia. -— This tour
by read (103 M.) is strongly recommended to Cyclists. -— Electric Tramway
to Pegli, see p. 68.

During the 19th century the Riviera suﬁ‘ered from Earthquakes in 1818,
l 1, 1854, and 1887. On the last occasion re eated shocks were felt in
the district between Nice and Finslmarina (p. . The increasing inter~
vals between the outbreaks render a speedy recurrence of the disturban-
ces very unlikely.

The remarks at p. 65 on the luxuriant ﬂora apply especially to
the Riviera di Ponente. The railway penetrates the numerous pro-
montories by tunnels.

21/2 M. San Pier d’Arena or Sampierdarena, the W. suburb of
Genoa, projecting far into the sea, has 34,084 inhab. and numerous
Palaces, including the Pat. Spinola and the Pal. Scassi (formerly
Imperiali), both probably by Gal. Alessi, the latter with a bean-
tiful garden. The church of Santa Maria delta Celia contains free-2
cues of the Genoese school. Large sugar—reﬁnery,
