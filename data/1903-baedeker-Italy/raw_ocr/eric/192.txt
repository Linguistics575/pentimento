Climate. San Remo is sheltered by an unbroken semicircular hill
rising from the Capo Nero to the Piano Gas-para (3000 ft.), culminating
in the Monte Caggto (3575 ft.) and Monte Btgnone (4260 ft.), and descend-
ing thence to the Capo Verde, its summit being nowhere more than 4 M.
distant in a strai ht line. The N. winds are therefore entirely excluded
from this favours spot, especially as a double range of Alps rises behind
the town a little farther back, while the force of the E. and W. winds
ismuch broken. Violent E. winds, however, frequently occur at the end
of February and the beginning of March, and the ‘Mistral‘ is also an un-
welcome visitor at this season. — To consumptive and bronchial patients
the E. bay is recommended on account of its sheltered situation and humid
atmosphere while suﬁ‘erers from nervous and liver complaints will ﬁnd
the dry and stimulating air of the W. bay more beneﬁcial. —- The mean
temperature of the three winter months is 51° Fahr.

San Remo, a town of 20,027 inhab., lies in the middle of a
beautiful bay, 51/; M. long, embosomed in olive-groves that cover
the valleys and lower slepes and give place higher up to pines and
other coniferaa. It has been a health-resort since 1861.

The crowded houses of the old town occupy a steep hill be-
tween the short valleys of the Torrents del Consents and the Tar-
rmte di San Romoto. A smaller quarter named Castigliuoli lies to
the W. of the latter stream. These older parts of the town consist
Of a curious labyrinth of narrow lanes, ﬂights of steps, archways,
lofty and sombre houses, and mouldering walls. The arches which
connect the houses high above the streets are intended to give them
stability in case of earthquakes. Vines are frequently seen clam-
baring up the houses and putting forth their tendrils and leaves
on the t0pmost stories.

The new town, occupying the alluvial land at the foot of the
hill, contains all the public buildings. The long Via Vittorio Ema-
nuele (Pl. 0, D, 3), with its numerous shops, is the chief centre of
trafﬂe. To the S.E. is the fort of Santa Tecla (Pl. D, 3, 4; now a
Prison), constructed by the Genoese to defend the small harbour,
which is sheltered by a sickle—shaped Bussnws'rnn 1300 ft. in
length. A survey from the parapet of this Molo will convey an idea
0f the sheltered position of San Remo.
