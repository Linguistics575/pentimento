POBRETTA. 52. Route. 383

the valley expands. 291/2 M. Riola; on the left rise the steep rocky
peaks of Mic. Ovolo and Mtc. Vigese; a landslip from the latter
destroyed the village of Vigo in 1851. On the right bank of the
Reno is the prettily situated castle of Savignano.

37 M. Porretta (1155 ft.; Gr. Hot. Porretta, of the ﬁrst class,
Alb. Palazzino, B. 2-4 fr., well spoken of, both open in summer
only; Alb. di Roma, with good restaurant, B. 2-4 fr.; Pens. anctti),
a village with frequented sulphureous springs and baths (Stabilimenti
Bovi, Puzzola, and Porretta Vecchia). Attractive walks to the (1/4I hr.)
Madonna dcl Pants and to (4 hrs.) Pracchia. '

Beyond Porretta the line enters a narrow and romantic ravine of
the Reno, from the sides of which numerous waterfalls are precip-
itated, particularly in spring, and is then carried by a series of
tunnels, cuttings, and viaducts to the culminating point where it
crosses the Apennines. ,

46 M. Pracchia (2025 ft. ; Locanda L’Appenino; Alb. dell’
Arsenalc), the highest point on the line.

Pracchia is the starting-point for the ascent of the Como alle Scale
(6370 R). We drive to (11/2 hr.) Gaeinana (Alb. Ferruccio) and thence,

starting early in the morning, ascend via Crocicchto and Maceglia to the
(31/2-4 hrs.) summit. We return to Maceglia via the Lago Scaﬁaiolo
(5836' ft.).

A post-omnibus runs twice daily from Pracchia to (18 M. Cuttgh‘ano
(2215 ft.; Alb. Capello d‘Orlando, clean; Pension Pendini, 7- fr.; Pens.
Tandem), a convenient centre for excursions, via (13/4 M.) Pontepem', where
it reaches the old Apennine road connecting Florence and Modena (p. 347)
and (71/2 M.) San Marcello Pistojese (about 2130 ft.; Alb. della Posta, well
spoken of ; Engl. Ch. serv.). The road then continues to ascend to (201/2 M.)
Boscolungo (‘Hdtel Bellini, with hydropathic; Locanda Ferrari, tolerable), and
to the Passe dell‘Abetons (about 452011.), where the 'Gran Albergo dell‘Abetone
(R. 3%, déj. 21/2, D. 41/2, pens. 12 fr.; open in summer only) lies in the
midst of a ﬁne forest. This is the starting-point for the ascent of Monte
Gimone (7103 ft. ; 4-5 hrs. ; guide, Beppino Ferrari, etc.), the highest summit
of the Northern Apennines, commanding fine views. It is also a starting-
point for numerous shorter excursions (Monte -Majori, 3/4 hr.; Libro Aperto,
11/2-2 hrs; Tre Patents, 2 hrs.; Monte Rondt'najo, Lago Santa, etc.). ——
From Abetone via Fiumalbo to (71/3 M.) Picvepelago (Modena), see p. 352.

Boscolungo is about 51/2 hrs.’ drive from Pracchia, and 7 hrs. from
Pistoja (via Pontepetri, see above). A road also leads to it from the Bagni di
432?} (p. 423) in about 6 hrs. (can. and pair, with trace-horse up the hill,

r.).

Beyond Pracchia the train crosses the watershed of the Adriatic
and the Tyrrhenian Sea by a tunnel about 12/3 M. in length , and
then enters the valley of the Ombrone (p. 403), which is traversed
by a lofty viaduct. Between this point and Pistoja there are viaducts
and tunnels in constant succession. Beautiful *Views. — Beyond
(501/2 M.) Corbezzi a view is at length revealed of the lovely and
populous plains of Tuscany, and of Pistoja far below.
