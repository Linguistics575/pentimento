cloisters, that in the centre to the church, that on the right to the
chapel of the Pucci, founded in 1300, and restored in 1615. Over
the central door is a mosaic by Davide Ghirlandajo, representing
the Annunciation (1509).

The Axrnnron Coon'r is adorned with ‘Frescoes by Andrea del Sam
and his pupils, which are now protected from the weather by a glass
colonnade (Opened by the sacristan, 30-50 0.). To the left of the entrance
to the church are two earlier frescoes: Adoration of the Shepherds by
Alsssto Baldootasm (1460); Investiture of Filippo Benizzi founder o the
order, by Cosimo Rossetti (1476). Then to the left follow ve 'Frescoes by
Andrea del Sarto: San Filippo clothing the sick (beside it, bust of Andrea,
by G. Caccini), Gamblers struck by lightning while mocking S. Filippo 2
Cure of a possessed woman; Dead man raised to life by the corpse o
S. Filippo; Boy healed by the saint‘s robe. ‘Carried away by his feeling
for harmony of colour, and charmed whenever he could realize a vague
and vaporons twilight of tone (see especially the Death of the Saint), Andrea
was unable to combine that appearance with absolute neutral contrasts . . . .
but the balance was almost restored by the facility with which he obtained
transparence, gay colours, and smoothness in the melting of tints into each
other . -— G. d: 0. -- These paintings were executed by A. del Sarto while
still young (ca. 1510); he appears as a ﬁnished master in the ‘Frescoes
on the other side: Arrival of the Magi, executed with a still more running
hand (than the following) but with less chastened sentiment, the ﬁgures
characterised by a self-conﬁdent swing (C'. d: 0.), and the Nativity of Mary,
painted in 1514 ‘on the highest level ever reached in fresco‘. In theright
foreground of the former, facing the spectator, is a portrait of J ac. Sansovino,
while the painter himself is shown pointing towards the front. The digniﬁed
woman in the centre of the other fresco is A. del Sarto‘s wife. -— The
remaining frescoes are by Del Sarto’s contemporaries and pupils : Franctabtgs'o,
Nuptials of Mary (1513), damaged by the painter himself in his choler at
its premature uncovering by some of the monks, Pontormo, Visitation (1516);
Russo, Assumption (1517). ,

The Interior is adorned with a large ceiling-painting of the Assumption
by C's'ro Fem-i (1670). To the left, before the 1st chapel, under a kind of
arm y of later date, is the Cappslla delta Vergs'ns Annanziata, erected in
[MB- '2 by Payne dt Lapo' Portigs'am' from Michelozzo‘s design, and sump-
:uously decorated with silver, gold, and gems by the Medici; it contains
t ‘miraculous‘ picture of the Virgin, a fresco of the 13th century. --
ird Chapel. Over the altar, Andr. del Oastagno, St. Jerome and the Trinity
:fresco admirable perspective) ; adjacent, frescoes by Al. Allon’. —-5th Chapel,
Pietro erags’no, Assumption. — The large Romans or run Cnons, adorned
with frescoes by Volterrano (1683), is peculiar, though its effect has been
tomewhat marred by the later baroque decorations. It was begun in 1451
3y Htchcloszo and completed in 1478 from designs by Leon Battista Alberti.
Po the left at the entrance is the monument of Angelo Marci-Medici, by
Francesco da Sangallo (1546). In the 3rd chapel is 3. Madonna with saints,
)y Pietro Perugs'no. The 5th chapel contains a cruciﬁx and six reliefs
irom the Passion by Giovanni da Bologna and his pupils, with the monument
)f the former. -— Over an altar to the left in the right transept is a Pieta
1y Baccio Bandinelli, who is buried beneath it. ,

A door in the left transept leads to the Cloisters. Adjoining this door,
in the outside, opposite the entrance from the street, is a ‘Fresco by Andrea
tel Sarto, the Madonna del Sacco (1525), remarkable for the calm and
ligniﬂed composition, and the beauty of the colouring, which is still
liscernible in spite of its damaged condition. Below it is the monument
Df the Falconieri, the founders of the church. On the same side is the
mtrance to the chapel of the guild of painters (Cappslla di San Luca;
:losed), adorned with paintings by G. Vasars‘, Poatormo, and others, and
:ontaining the tomb of Benvenuto Cellini. —— In the Second Cloisters (opened
iy the sacristan), to the left, is an admirable terracotta statue of John the
Baptist, by Hickelozzo.
