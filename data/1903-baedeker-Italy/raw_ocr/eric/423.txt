268 Route 12. VENICE. History of Art.

Italy.~'£ln'3point of size the early-Renaissance buildings in Venice cannot
compare with those of Tuscany, but they are more richly decorated, and
retain the articulation peculiar to the earliest period. At a later period
Venetian architecture may justly boast of holding out against the rococo
style longer than Central Italy. Chief among Venetian architects were
several of the Lombardi family (immigrants from Carona, on the Lago di
Lugano), Moro Caducci (d. 1504) Jacopo Bansooino of Florence (1486-1570;
see below), Giovanni da Pants (1512-97), and lastly Andrea Palladio of Vicenea
(1518-80; p. 243), who inaugurated a new era, especially in church-archi-
' tecture, by limiting the facade to a single range of massive columns.

Palladio‘s chief successors were Vinceneo Seaman“ 552-1616) and Baldassare
Longhena (1604-75).

In the province of Scunr'rnnn the city possessed at the end of the 14th
cent. two important masters in the brothers ‘Mauegne, who had probably
studied in the school of the Saati (ca. 1345-75). In the 15th cent. the
growing taste for monumental tombs gave abundant employment to the
sculptors, and led to the execution of those magniﬁcent monuments which
still ﬁll the churches of Venice. The names of the Bison, of Antonio Rina _
of Verona (c. 1430-ca. 1498), of the Lombardi (see above), and of Alessandro
Leopardi (d. 1522) who had formed himself by the study of Greek scalp 7
tures, are the most important. After 1527 Jacopo Bansom'no, sculptor and .
architect, was the leading master. His w0rks, though often designed for :
pictorial eﬁ‘ect, are more pleasing than those of Michael Angelo‘s school. '
His pupils were Girolamo Campagna (1552-1823) and Alessandro Vittoria
(1525-1608). .

Vaunrmn PAINTING did not begin to attract universal attention till
the beginning of the 16th cent. (comp. p. 11:). In the 14th cent. it was
far inferior to that of other Italian schools, and though Giotto was en- 3
gaged in the neighbouring town of Padua, it remained unaffected by his 3
inﬂuence. In 1365 Guariento of Padua, and in 1419 the Umbrian Gentile do 1
Fabriano and Vittors Pisaao of Verona, were invited to Venice to decorate
the doges‘ palace. In the 15th cent. the most noted masters were Giovanni
(also named Aluminum), Antonio, Bartolomeo, and Aloha ( Luigi) Vicariai, j
known as the Muraaesi, Jacopo Bellini, father-in—law of Mantegna, who
inﬂuenced the Paduan school (p. 249), and Carlo Grinni. Antonella da
Messiaa introduced painting in oils into Venice about 1473, and the new
method contributed powerfully to the development of the ﬁrst surely
Venetian artists in Gentile (1427-1507) and Giovanni Bellini (1428-151 ), the
sons of JacOpo. Giovanni Bellini, who had many pupils, is with Mantegna
the most important master of the early Renaissance in N. Italy. Alike in
composition (as in the ‘santa conversazione‘, a peaceful, yet expressive

group of saints with the Madonna), in his love of colour and appreciation
of landscape, and in his conception of female ﬁgures, he may be regarded
as the precursor of the g10rious prime of Venetian painting. Among his
contemporaries were Vittore Gamaccio (d. 1520), a live 3' pictorial narrator,
and Marco Basaiti (d. 1521), while to his school belonge Oima da Coaegliaao
(1459-1517), Vincenzo Galina, Andrea Preeitali, Niccolo Roudinelli, and others.

The ﬁrst of the rest masters of the late Renaissance was Giorgione
(Barbarelli, 1477?-151 ), but unfortunately only the altar-piece at Caste!-
franco (p. 257) is thoroughly authenticated as his work; though at Venice
the ‘Famiglia di Giorgione‘ in the Pal. Giovanelli (p. 800) and an Apollo
and Daphne in the Seminario Patriarcale (p. 317) are ascribed to him.
The peculiar glow of his colmu-ing, an attribute which seems natural
rather than acquired, imparts even to his isolated half-ﬁgures unwanted
life and poetical charm. The ﬁrst artist who fully developed that type of
female beauty in which simple enjo ent of life is so admirably ex-
pressed was Jacopo Palma (Vecchio, 1138-1528) of Bergamo. The olden
hair of his sitters recalls the fashionable practice of the period of yeing
the hair a light colour. Surpassing all his fellows in celebrity, in fertility,
and in the length of his career, next comes the, great Tmsno Vacant
(1477-1576). Frescoes by him may be seen in the Scuola del Santa and
Scuola del Carmine at Padua and in the Doges‘ Palace at Venice; and
