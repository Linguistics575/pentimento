We now proceed to the right to the —

Cathedral (Duomo; Pl. F, 1, 2), a Gothic structure ofthe 14th cent,
with choir and Romanesque facade of the 12th cent. and pointed
windows in the facade inserted later. On the outside of the spec

columns and griﬂ‘ins of the handsome portal are Roland and Oliver,
the paladins of Charlemagne, in rough relief, executed according
to the inscription by Nicolaus (1135). By the side-wall rises an

To the left of the choir a corridor leads to San Giovanni in
Fonts, the ancient Baptistery, of the 12th cent.; the Romanesque
reliefs on the font (about 1200) show a distinct advance on those
