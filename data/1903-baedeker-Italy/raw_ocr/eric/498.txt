tues ofthc Dukes Alessandro Famcsc (d. 1592; p. 340) and Ranuccio
Famesc (1592-1622), by Francesco Mocchi of Tuscany (1620—24).
—- Behind the statues is situated the *Panazzo Munrorrann, erected
in 1281 et seq., and described by Burckhardt as ‘one of the earliest
instances of a worthy and monumental embodiment in stone and
lime of the growing spirit of municipal independence’. On the
groundﬁoor there is a spacious arcade with ﬁve pointed arches; in
the upper ﬂoor (of terracotta) are six rich round-arch windows,
above which rise handsome pinnacles.

San Francesco (P1. 2; D, 2), a brick ediﬁce in the Piazza, with
Gothic interior, was erected in 1278. In front of it a statue of
G. D. Romag'nosi (d. 1835), editor of the penal code for the Napo—
leonic kingdom of Italy, was unveiled in 1867.

The principal street (Via Venti Settembre) leads to the S.E. to
the Piazza del Duomo, in which rises the —

*CATHBDBAL (Pl. D, 3), a Lombard-Romanesque ediﬁce dating
from 1122, with a superstructure of brick added in the 13th century.
In the facade are three projecting porches with columns resting on
lions, above which are a circular window and Open galleries with
dwarf pillars. The entire ediﬁce has been restored in 1898—1901.

Chiapponi, rises Sam" ANTONINO (Pl. D, 3), formerly the cathedral,
dating from the 12th cent. and several times restored, the last time

W. end of the church, and from its intersection with the nave rises
a tower borne by eight massive round columns.

A modern inscription in the ﬁne old Gothic vestibule, called ‘Para-
iiso‘ (1850), commemorates the fact that the delegates of the league of
Lombard cities, assembled in the church in 1183, there approved of the
Peace of Constance.

lella Dogana , is the Palazzo dei Tribunali (Pl. 6, E 2; formerly
