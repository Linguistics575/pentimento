Palaaao Pun. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 511

King of Italy when at Florence. The upper ﬂoor of the left wing
contains the far—famed I"'JE’icInu-e Gallery (Galleria Palatina), which
was formerly the property of Cardinals Leapold and Carlo de’ Medici,
and of the Grand-Duke Ferdinand II. The Pitti Gallery, which
contains about 500 works, may be regarded as an extension of the
Tribuna (p. 461) in the Ufﬂzi Gallery. No collection in Italy can
boast of such an array of masterpieces, interspersed with so few
works of subordinate merit. The most conspicuous work of the
earlier Florentine period is the round Madonna by Filippo Lippi
(No. 343; p. 517). Pcmgino’s Fiat). (164; p. 514), in which the
treatment of the landscape deserves notice, is one of his principal
works. To Fm Bariolomco’s later period belong the Resurrection
(159; p. 514), the Holy Family (256; p. 516), St. Mark (125;
p. 515), and the Pieta (64; 515), the master’s last work , a model
of composition, ennobled by depth of sentiment and purity of
forms , and certainly one of the most beautiful products of Italian
art. Andrea del Sarto, the great colourist, is admirably represented
by an Annunciation (124; p. 515); by the so-called Disputa (172;
p. 514), a picture without action, but of an imposing and digniﬁed
character; a Pieta (58; p. 515), more dramatically treated than is
the master’s wont; and the Madonna with saints (307; p. 517),
all of which show his diﬂ'erent excellencies, and particularly the
1 soft blending of his colours. -— The treasures of the gallery
1 culminate in no fewer than a dozen of Runann’s works. The
j exquisite ‘Madonna del Granduca’ (178; p. 513), in which a
_ Pure type of simple female beauty is but slightly veiled by the
‘. reli ous character of the work, and the ‘Madonna della Sedia’
(15 ; p.514), amost beautiful work of purely human character, in
which intense maternal happiness is expressed by the attitude of
the group, both captivate every beholder. The ‘Madonna del Bal-
dacchino’ (165; p. 514 , on the other hand, and the ‘Madonna
dell’ Impannata' (No. 9 ; p. 515), are of inferior interest and are
not entirely by Raphael’s own hand. The Vision of Ezekiel (174;

. 514), likewise completed by his pupils, transports us into an
entirely diﬂerent sphere, in which Raphael treats a medieval
symbolical subject. The ﬁnest of the portraits is that of Leo X.
with the two cardinals (40; p.516), in which the delicate and
harmonious blending of the four shades of red should be noticed.
The portrait of Julius II. (79‘; p. 515) exhibited here is now
regarded as a Venetian copy of the original in the Tribuna (p. 462).
The portraits of Cardinal Bibbiena (158; p. 514) and Inghirami
(171; p. 514) are also now admitted to be early copies. In the
‘Donna Velata’ (245; p. 515) we recognize Raphael’s mistress,
whom a later groundless tradition has described as a baker’s
daughter (‘Fornarlna’). The same beautiful features recur in the
Sistine Madonna at Dresden. The portraits of Angiolo and Madda-
lena Doni (61, 59; p. 514), of the master’s Florentine period,
