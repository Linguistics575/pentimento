without restraint, and almost, as it were, spontaneously. Works i1
marble also occur, but these generally trench on the province 0
decoration, and seldom display the bold and unfettered aspiration
which are apparent in the works in bronze.

The churches have always afforded the most important ﬁeld to:

the labours of the Italian sculptors, some of them, such as Sana
Croce at Florence, the Frari and Santi Giovanni e Paolo at Venice
and Sant’ Antonio at Padua, forming very museums of Renaissanc
sculpture. At the same time many of the wealthier families (th.
'Medici and others) embellished their mansions with statuary, an:
the art Of the sculptor was frequently invoked with a view to erec
a ﬁtting tribute to the memory of some public benefactor (such a
the equestrian statues at Venice and Padua).

of life and character. The Judith Group in the Loggia de’ Lanz
is an exaggerated and unpleasing example Of this style, the masts
having aimed at the utmost possible expressiveness, while the line
and contours are entirely destitute of ease. Among Donatello‘
most successful works on the other hand are his statue of St. Georg
and his Victorious David in bronze in the Museo Nazionale (p. 4733

(1460-1529), the author Of the exquisite group of Christ and the Bap

the choir of S. Maria del Popolo), and of part of the sculptures whic
adorn the Santa Gasa near Ancona. Northern Italy also contribute
largely to the development of the plastic art. The Gertosa at Pavit
