Pavia (p. 144) is visible, farther E. the towers and domes of Pavia. itself,
in the background the Apennines. Perfectly clear weather is necessary
to see all these points.

In front of the cathedral rises the colossal bronze Equestrian
Statue of Victor Emmanuel 11., completed in 1896 from the model
by Ercole Rosa (d. 1893). The well-executed reliefs on the pedestal
represent the Allies entering Milan after the battle of Magenta.

To the S. stands the PalazzoReale (Pl. E, F, 5, 6; adm., see
p. 115), built in 1772 on the site of the Palazzo di Corte, the earliest
mansion of the Visconti and the Sforza. It is adorned with frescoes
by Appiam’, *B. Luini (from the Casa della Pelucca, near Monza), and
Hayes, and contains several handsome saloons. In the street to
the left, beyond the palace, are visible the tower (1336; built by
F. Pecorari) and spas of the ﬁne half-Romanesque church of San
Gottardo, formerly the chapel of the Visconti. --- Adjacent, on the E.,
in the Piazza del Campo Santo (formerly the cathedral-cemetery),
rises the large Archiepiscopal Palace (Palaszo Arcioescovilc ,-
Pl. F, 5), originally built at the end of the 16th cent. in the early—

marble statues (Moses and Aaron) by Tantardini and Strazaa. The
second court, on the side next the Piazza Fontana, is embellished
with Corinthian columns of the 15th century. -— The W. side of
the Piazza del Duomo is skirted by the Via Car-to Alberto (see p. 128),
beyond which, to the N.W., lies the Piazza de’ Mercanti (p. 128).

On the N. side is the imposing palatial facade (ﬁnished in
1878) which forms the entrance to the *Galleria Vittorio Emanuele
(Pl. E, 5), connecting the Piazza del Duomo with the Piazza della
Scale. This is the most spacious and attractive structure of the
kind in Europe. It was built in 1865-67 by Gina. Mengoni, who
unfortunately lost his li'fe by falling from the portal in 1877. The
gallery, which is said to have cost 8 million fr. (320,000l.) , is
320 yds. in length, 16 yds. in breadth, and 94 ft. in height. The
form is that of a Latin cross, with an octagon in the centre, crowned
at a height of 160 ft. with a glass cupola.
