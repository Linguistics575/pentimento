The Via San Benedetto and the Via Milano, farther on, lead
from the Palazzo Doria past the Sailors’ Rest (p. 69) and the large
new quays (comp. p. 72) to the lighthouse. About halfway we reach
the Piazza Dinegro (omnibus, p. 68), No. 41 in which is the Panazzo
Rosazza (adm. 1 fr.). The charming gardens, with their rare plants
and pretty fountains, deserve avisit; in the upper part is aBelvcdcrc,
commanding a *View similar to that from the lighthouse.

On the rocky headland separating Genoa from San Pier d’Arena
rises the large Lighthouse (Lanterna; 384 ft.), with its dazzling
reﬂectors showing a light visible for over 20 miles. Visitors may
go by the S. Pier d’Arena tramway (No. 11, p. 68) to the tunnel.
The tower (353 marble steps) may be ascended and the apparatus
inspected (fee 1 fr.); but the platform at its foot commands as good
a view. Best light in the evening.

The ‘Vrsw embraces the town and extensive harbour of Genoa, with
the amphitheatre of mountains behind; to the E. the Riviera di Levante
is visible as far as the picturesque promontory of Portoﬁno; to the W.
are seen the coast-villages on the Riviera di Ponente from San Pier d‘Arena

to Savona, the headland of Noli, and the Cape delle Mela, while in the
distance are the usually snow-capped peaks of the Ligurian Alps.

property of the city, with pretty cascades, the Muses Oivico, with
collections of natural history (adm., see p. 70), and an incipient
