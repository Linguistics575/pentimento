Bant’ Antonio (P1. D, :E, 5), the sepulchral church of St. Anthony
of Padua (b. at Lisbon, d. 1231; an associate of St. Francis of
Assisi), commonly called ‘Il Santo’, was begun in 1232; the nave
was completed in 1307, and the remainder in 1424. The church
was restored in 1749 after a fire and whitewashed in the interior.
This unattractive structure is 126 yds. long and 60 yds. broad
across the transepts. It has seven domes, heightened in 1424, of

which the largest is 120 ft. high.

The modern bronze doors, by Camille Betta (1895), replace the ancient
doors of wood. Four rich Gothic niches in the central portal contain
statuettes, by Aug. Felicf, of 88. Francis, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony, and
Bonaventura, the chief saints of the Franciscan order. In the lunetle
above are 88. Bernardino and Antonio holding the monogram of Christ, a
fresco by Mantegna (1452).

The Interior has recently been repainted. The nave and aisles are
borne by twelve pillars; the semicircular choir has eight clustered columns,
an ambulatory, and a series of eight chapels. —— On the entrance-wall, to the
