"1139. Michael Angelo, Holy Family, an early work, painted on
the commission of Angelo Doni, the only easel-work of the master
in Italy, painted in tempera between 1501 and 1505.

The Madonna, a large-framed woman, kneels on the ground and leans
to one side, as she hands the Infant over her shoulder to her husband,
who stands behind and ﬁnishes off the group. In the hollow way of
the middle distance walks the sturdy little John the Ba tist, who looks
merrily back at the domestic scene. Naked ﬁgures, w ch have no ap—
parent connection with the subject of the picture, enliven the background,
In obedience to the custom of the 15th cent., when the artist was ex-
oected to show his skill in perspective or his mastery of the nude on every
)pportunity. -— Springer.

‘A magniﬁcent likeness. in which the true grain of what may be called
hurchman‘s ﬂesh is reproduced in a form both clear and fair but with the
ight tendency to droop which is characteristic in priests‘. -- 0. d: C.

*1141. A. Diirer, Adoration of the Magi (1504), one of the ﬁrst
iportant easel-paintings by this master, carefully and minutely
liShed, and in good preservation.

Both the aerial and the linear perspective are faulty, but the tech-
:al handling is as perfect as in Diirer‘s latest and ﬁnest works. The
atment and the colouring are both in the characteristic style of the
rthern school of painting. The colours are ﬂuent but sharply deﬁned,
:1 on at first a tempera and then glazed with oil-pigments. The tone
extraordinarily lively and clear. —- This gem of German art was form-
y in the imperial gallery at Vienna, whence it came to Florence by
:hange in the 18th century. -- Thaming‘s ‘Darcr‘.
