side are twelve reliefs in bronze, from the Old Testament, ten by Bellano
(1484-88), two (David before the Ark, Judith and Holofernes; the 3rd and
5th to the left) by Riccio (1507). The full-length portrait of St. Anthony,
by the exit on the left, is said to be the best likeness. — The ‘High Altar,
executed in 1446-50 by Donatello and his pupils and removed in 1576 to

of Camilla Boito in 1895 and adorned with the original sculptures by Dona-
tello. Below are twelve charming angels with musical instruments, a ﬁne
Deposition in the Tomb, and the symbols of the four Evangelists (studio-
