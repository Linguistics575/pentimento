SOLFEBINO. 33. Route. 199

The village of Solferino (375 ft.) lies on the S.W. margin of the hills
bordering the Lago di Garda on the 8., about 71/: M. to the S. of Desenzano
and about 5 M. to the 8.W. of San Martino. It formed the centre of the
Austrian position, and was taken about 1 p.m. by the French guards. The
heights of San Martino to the N.E. were held by General Benedek, who
repulsed the attacks of the Piedmontese until nightfall, and only abandoned
his position On receiving the order to retreat. The left wing of the
Austrian army, attacked by the French under General Niel, also maintained
its position until late in the afternoon. — Hurried travellers content
themselves with a visit to the Tower of Ban Martino, 3], M. to the S.
of the railway-station of that name (see p. 198). This structure, erected
to commemorate the battle of Solferino and converted into a military
museum in 1893, stands upon a platform 65 ft. in width and rises to a
height of 243 ft. We ﬁrst enter a circular chamber, in the centre of
which is a statue by Ant. Dal Zouo, representing Victor Emmanuel 11.
as the commander of the Italian tr00ps at Solferino. 0n the walls are
scenes from the life of the King, and on the vaulting are eight allegorical
ﬁgures representing the chief cities of Italy, all painted in wax-colours
by Vi“. Bremmin. The side-chapels contain busts of the ei ht Italian
generals who fell in the wars of independence. From the roun chamber
an easy staircase, ascending through two passages, with bronze tablets
containing the names of the 650,000 ﬁghters for the unity of Italy, leads
to seven rooms, one above another, each containing a battle-painting
and reminiscences of one of the seven campaigns of the wars. From
the uppermost room we emerge on the platform of the tower, which
not only commands the battleﬁeld (chief points indicated by arrows) but
also aﬂ‘ords an extensive *View of the Lago di Garda and the chain of
the Alps. Near the tower is a Charm! Home, surrounded by cypresses.
