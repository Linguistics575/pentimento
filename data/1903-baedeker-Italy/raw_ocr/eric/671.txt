The Freer CLOISTBRS, erected by Amolfo di Gambia, are now
usually entered from the Piazza Santa Croce, through a gate to the
right of the church. They contain the tomb of Gastone della Torre,
patriarch of Aquileia (d. at Florence in 1317), old monuments of
the Alamanni, Pazzi, and other families, many coats-of-arms, and
modern tombs. In the centre, God the Father, astatue by Bandineui.

Opposite the entrance from the Piazza is the *CarrBLLa or ms
Pazzr (p. 437), one of the ﬁrst creations of modern architecture,

connected by a parapet, and interrupted in the middle by an arch
and cupola adorned with glazed; and coloured lacunars. In front is
