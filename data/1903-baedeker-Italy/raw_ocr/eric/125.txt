To the S. of Turin, on the line to Genoa (R. 11b) and connected with
Turin by steam-tramwa also (p. 25), lies Moncalieri (Albergo Roma), a
. pleasant little town of 1 ,000 inhab., picturesquely situated on a chain of
hills, and commanding a superb view. On a height above the village is
the royal Chateau (15th cent.; rebuilt 17th cent), in which Victor Em-
manuel I. died in 1824. The picture-gallery in the W. wing contains a
series of large paintings illustrating the history of the House of Savoy.
The last of the series, ‘Delivery of the Plebiscite of Tuscany by Baron
Ricasoli in 1880‘, is interesting from its numerous portraits (fee 112-1 fr.).
A horse-tramway runs to the chateau from the terminus of the steam-
tramway.

About 6 M. to the S.W. of Turin (steam-tramway, see p. 25) lies Stupi-
nigi, a royal chateau, erected from desi s by Juvara in the reign of Charles
Emmanuel III. and occupied since i as a summer-residence by the
Queen-Dowager Margherita. It contains several rooms with ﬁne frescoes
and is surrounded by an extensive deer-park (*Albergo del Cartel Vecclu‘o,
at the back of the chateau, moderate).

Another steam-tramway (p. 25) connects Turin with Carignano, a town
with 4300 inhab. and several fine churches, situated on the highroad to
Nice. San Giovanni Battista was erected by Count Alder-i; Dania Maria
delle Grazia contains a monument to Bianca Palmologus, daughter of Gug-
lielmo IV., Marquis of Montferrat, and wife of Duke Charles 1., at whose
court the ‘Chevalier Bayard‘ was brought up. -- Carignano, with the title
of a principality, was given as an appanage to Thomas Francis (d. 1656),
fourth son of Charles Emmanuel I., from whom the present royal family
is descended. — Steam-tramway to Gamagnola, see p. 47.
