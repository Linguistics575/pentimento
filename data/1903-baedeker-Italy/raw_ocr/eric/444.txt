‘An attractive narrative composition, affording us a glimpse of the
private life of a Venetian aristocrat. In the splendour of the colouring,
the beauty of the forms, and the charm .of the landscape in the back-

ground, we may recOgnize the inﬂuence of Titian‘s masterpieces of ca.
1510-20‘. -— Burckhardt.

‘It may be that looking closely at the ‘Pieta‘, our e es will lose
hemselves in a chaos of touches; but retiring to the focal istance, they
ecover themselves and distinguish all that Titian meant to convey. In
he group of the Virgin and Christ -— a group full of the deepest and

recent feeling - there lies a grandeur comparable in one sense with that
vhich strikes us in the ‘Pieta’ of Michaelangelo.‘ — 0. d: C.

‘The composition unites all the peculiar qualities of the master, and

ressron. The work, however, cannot be put on a level with the great
reations of Titian‘. -— 0. J: C'. ‘
