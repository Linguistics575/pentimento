government of the town was carried on by the nobles (Grandi) through
four (afterwards six) consuls, assisted by a council of 1(1) Buonaouu'st.
From 1207 onwards the judicial functions were entrusted to the Pedals,
a foreign nobleman of legal erudition elected for a period of six months,
afterwards increased to a year. The Florentines maintained their pristine
simplicity and virtue longer than was usual in Italian cities. The nobles,
however, lived in bitter feuds with each other, and after the assassination
of Buondelmonte on the Ponte Vecchio in 1215 were divided between the
two hostile camps of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Under the Emperor
Frederick 11. the Ghibellines enjoyed a brief period of supremacy, but on
his death in 1250 the Guelphs secured the upper hand. As in consequence
of these conﬂicts the sway of the nobility proved detrimental to the in-
terests of the city, the pe0ple in 1250 organised a kind of national guard
of their own, commanded by a ‘Capitano del Popolo‘, who was assisted by
a council of 12 ‘Ancients’ (‘Anzt'am”) and 36 ‘Corporals‘ (Caporali). About
the same time (1252) was first coined the golden Florin, which soon became a
general standard of value, and marks the leading position taken by Flarence
in the commerce of Europe. The guilds of the wool-weavers and cloth-
makers maintained agents in Venice, Paris, Bruges, and London; Floren-
tine bankers had a hand in the commerce of every nation, and, more
especially, exercised almost exclusive control over the money-marketof
France. The continuous feuds of the nobles brought the republic into
collisiOu with other Tuscan towns, of which Siena and Pisa were con-
spicuous partisans of the Ghibellines. In 1260 the Florentines suﬂ‘ered I
crushing defeat on the Arbia, near Montaperti, which cost the Guelpls
their supremacy in the city. The Ghibelline grandees proposed to me
Florence to the ground and to transfer the seat of government to Empeli,
but the plan was successfully opposed by the noble Farinata degli Uberti.

0n the death of Manfred of Hohenstaut‘en at the battle of Benevesto
in 1266, the Guelphs regained their power, and in 1287 they elected Charles
0%: Anion as Signor for ten years. This election placed foreign princes in
t e same position with regard to the republic as had been held by the
emperors, and their representatives now shared the government with the
municipal authorities, which ever since the middle of the 13th cent. had
included the presidents of the seven greater Arts, or guilds (Lawyers and
Notaries, Cloth-dealers, Money—changers, Wool-weavers, Silk-worked.
Physicians and Apothecaries, and Furriers). Fourteen lesser guilds were
afterwards formed. In 1282 the guilds arrogated to themselves the supreme
power, and entrusted the government to a Signoria formed of their pre-
sidents or Priori (afterwards restricted to eight, elected [or two months).
The nobility were kept in check by the ‘Ordinamenti della Giustizia', s
series of strict regulations due to Giana della Bella (1293), which were ad-
ministered by a Gan aloniere della Giusti'zia, supported by a civic militia
of 1000 (afterwards 000) men. The civic banner bore a red cross upon a
white ground. After 1303 the Gonfaloniere della Giustizia became the
president of the Priori, with whom were now associated the sixteen Gon-
falonieri of the militia, the Capitano del Popolo, and (after 1312) twelve
magistrates known as Buonuomini. The legislative preposals of the body
thus constituted were submitted to three councils: the Conse'glio dd Popolo.
elected at ﬁrst exclusively from the more pr03perous citizens (the ‘pOpolo
grasso‘), the Constglio della Credenza, on which the guild-ofﬁcials sat, and
the Consiglz'o del Podestd. Finally they were considered by a General Casual.
formed of the three separate councils. Ofﬁces were held but for a short
term, in order that as many citizens as possible might enjoy them, but If
any one were ‘admonished’ for a crime, he became ineligible for ofﬁce.
Advantage of this was frequently taken by the party holding the upper
hand to exclude their opponents from power; and the steady develoPment
of constitutional government was interrupted also by the custom of err
trusting from time to time, at the request of the Signoria, a committee of
Citizens With the full power (Balia) of altering the laws.

At the beginning of the 14th cent., new party-struggles among the
nobles burst forth, under the new names of the Whites and the Blacks: the
Guelphﬁ (mm) were eventually victorious, and many of the Bianchi
