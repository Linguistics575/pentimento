San Lorenzo. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 499

tasteful monument of Piero de‘ Medici (father of Lorenzo il Magniﬂco) and
his brother Giovanni, by Andrea Verrocchio (1472). In the small chamber,
to the left, is a fountain also by Verrocchio. — In the 2nd cha l (Capp.
Martelli) are a Monument to Donatello, by R. Rommel“ (1 and an
Annunciation, by Fra Filippo Lippi. -- In the Lnr'r Arena is the artyrdom
of St. Lawrence, a large fresco by Angela Bromine. Adjacent is a beautiful
cantoria by Donatello. —— The adjoining door leads to the clcisters and the
library (see below). \

The CLorsms, immediately adjoining the church, with double V
arcades attributed to anelleschi, form a striking reminiscence cf the
great period of the Medici. Immediately to the right is a statue of
Paolo Giovio (1483-1655), the historian, by Francesco da Bangallo
(1560). w

A staircase, beginning in the passage to the right of the entrance
to the church, ascends to the upper story of the cloisters and to the
Biblicteca Laurenaiana (Pl. E, F, 4; adm., see p. 437; gratuities
forbidden), a library founded by Cosimo the Elder in 1444, and
gradually enlarged by the Medici. Its chief treasure consists of
about 10,000 MSS. of Greek and Latin classical authors, many of
which are extremely valuable. The building was begun in 1523-6
from the design of Michael Angelo, the portico was built by him
(very effective in spite of several eccentricities, such as the columns
- inserted in the walls, with massive volutes below), and the staircase
gwhich was also designed by Michael Angelo) was completed in

568-71 by Vasari ; the rotunda containing the Bibl. Delciana, was
. erected in 1841, from Poccianti’s design.

The wooden ceiling of the Library was executed by G. B. del Tauo and
Garcia, from Michael Angelo”: designs (after 1629 ?). The last also fur-
nished the design for the 88 ‘plutei‘ to which the M88. are attached. Among
these are a number of codices of rare value: Virgil cf the 4th or 5th cent.,
Pliny of the 10th or 11th cent. (from the Ashburnham Collection); Ta-
citus, two 1188. of the 10th and 11th cent. the older brought from Ger-
many and the sole c0py containing the rst ﬁve books of the Annals.
The andects, of the 6th or 7th cent., said to have been carried oil‘ from
Amalﬂ by the Pisans in 1135, the oldest existing MS. of this collection,
on which the study of Roman Law almost entirely hinges. Most impor-
tant MS. of Eschylus and best MS. of Cicero‘s Epistolas ad Familiares.
Petrarch‘s Canzone, with portraits of Petrarch and Laura. 1188. of Dante
including a sumptuous codex of the end of the 14th century. Letters 01'
Dante. Decamerone of Bcccaccic. MSS. of Amer-i . 49). Document of
the Council of Florence, 1439; Codex Amiatinus; yrian gospels, with
miniatures of the 6th cent. - maps of Ptolemy. Catalogues by Assemann
(Oriental use.) and Bandini, continued by Del Furia.

To San Lorenzo belong also the New Sacristy and the Chapel of
the Princes, the entrance to which, however, is now in the Puzza
MADONNA (Pl. E, 3; adm., see p. 437), at the back of the church.
From the vestibule we ascend a ﬂight of steps to the left, and reach
ﬁrst the chapel of the princes, and then the new sacristy (on the left).

The CHAPEL or rm: Pmcns (Cappella dei Principi), the burial
chapel of the grand-dukes of the Medici family, was constructed after
1604 by Matteo Nigetti, from the designs of Giovanni de’ Medici.

‘ It is octagonal in form, covered by a dome and gorgeously decorated
with marble and valuable mosaics in stone. The paintings in the dome
