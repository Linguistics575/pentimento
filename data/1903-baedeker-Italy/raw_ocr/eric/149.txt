several peaks (8. and highest peak 11,435 ft.; N. peak 11,310 ft.), either
from Valgrisanche, or better from La Thutle on the Little St. Bernard

through the beautifully wooded Val Grisanche, on the left bank of
the Dora di Vatgrisanchc, to Ceres or Scrre’ (Hot. Frassy, rustic) and
Revers, where the river disappears for a short distance under rocks.
The hamlet of Ptcmavat lies to the left. The valley contracts to a
wild ravine. The path on its left side skirts a precipice high above
the roaring torrent. On the oppositebank, on an apparently in-
accessible rock, is perched the ruined castle of Montmajeur or
Tour d’Arboc’. -— Liverogne, see p. 55. Near Liverogne the path
quits the gorge and descends to the left through meadows and groups
of trees to the road from Conrmayeur to Aosta (p. 53).
