and were largely increased in 1741 by the purchase of Prince
Eugene’s valuable gallery, which included many Netherlandish
works. A number of the paintings carried off by the French in
1798 remained in Paris after the conclusion of peace in 1815; and
in 1832, the rest, which had meantime been scattered through
various palaces, were collected to form a public gallery in the
Palazzo Madame. They were transferred to the Accademia in,1865.

The collection is important for the study of Macrino d’Alba
(1470-1528) and his pupil Defendente de Ferrari, and of Gaudenzz‘o
Ferrari (c. 1471-1546), who was inspired by Leon. da Vinci and
inﬂuenced by Perugino (Nos. 46 and 51). Soddma (c. 1480-1549),-
who originally belonged to the Lombard school, is well represented.
Lorenzo di :Credi’s (1459-1537) Madonna, N o. 115, of his best period,
shows that he was inﬂuenced by Leon. da Vinci. Among numerous
