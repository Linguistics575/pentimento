A few paces to the S. of S. Eufemia is the 00330 Pon'ra Bonsanr,
which begins at the Piazza delle Erbe and leads to the Port: de’
Bonari (Pl. D, 3), a town-gate, erected under Emp. Gallienus,
A. D. 265, in the poor later Roman style. ,

To the W. this Corso is prolonged by the Conso Gavoun (P1. D,
G, 3), one of the chief streets of Verona, in which several handsome
palaces are situated. Immediately to the right (No. 10) is the Gothic
Paloma Pomoni (formerly Pal. de’ Medici). Farther on, to the left,
in a small piazza, is the church of Santi Apostoli (Pl. D, 3), with
very ancient tower and Romanesque apse. In front of it stands a
marble statue by Zannoni of Aleardo Aleardi, the poet and patriot
(1812—78). —- Also on the left (No. 19) is the handsome *Pal.
Bevilacqua, by Sanmicheli, now entirely neglected. — Opposite is
the small church of SAN Lonmrzo (11th cent. ?), a Romanesque
ediﬁce, with round towers on the facade. The interior, restored in
1896-98, has galleries supported alternately by pillars and columns.
There are remains of many old frescoes, and in the apse is an altar—
piece by Dom. Brusasorci (1566). — Then, on the right, No. 38,
Pal. Portalupi, and No. 44, Pal. Canoesa, also by Sanmicheli, with
a ﬁne portico and court, but with an attica added in 1770.

The neighbouring Piazzetta di Castel Vecchio (Pl. 0, 3) aﬂ’ords
. a picturesque view of the imposing pinnacled Bridge of the 14th
cent., which connects the Oastel Vecchio (Pl. 0, 3), the castle of.
Can Grande II. (14th cent.), now a barrack, with the left bank of the
Adige (Open to passengers during the day). _

From the Gastello to San Zeno, see p. 229. The Via San Bernar-
dino leads to the W. to San Bemardino (p. 228), while the Corso is
prolonged to the S.W. to the Porta del Patio (p. 228).

.To the S. of the Corso, and connected with it by several streets,
lies the Puzza Vrr'ronro EMANUELE (P1. D, 4; formerly Piazza Brd,
from ‘pratum’, meadow), with an equestrian Statue of Victor Em—
manuel 11., by Borghi, erected in 1883. .

0n the E. side of this piazza rises the famous *Amphitheatro
(Arena; P1. D, 4), erected under Diocletian about A. D. 290, and
known in German lore as the abode of Dietrich (Theodoric) of
Bern , 106 ft. in height, 168 yds. long, and 134 yds. wide. Of the

outer wall with its four stories a fragment only now exists.

Around the humor: (entr. from the W. side by arcade No. V; adm. 1 in;
closed at sunset; guide superﬂuous) rise 43 tiers of steps of grey limestone
or reddish-yellow conglomerate (often restored since the end of the 16th cent.,
and partly modern), on which 20,000 spectators could sit. An inscri tion
on the second story commemorates the visit of Napoleon I. in 1805, an the
restoration carried out by his order. Fine view from the highest steps.
Two doors at the ends of the longer diameter afforded access to the arena

itself (82 by 48 yds.).
0n the E. side of the Arena, in the small Piazza Mnra Gallieno,
is a fragment of the Late-Roman City Wall, brought to light in 187 2.
