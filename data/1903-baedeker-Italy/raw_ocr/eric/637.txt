streets; the upper part dates from the 15th century. The inscription
placed over the door in 1529 (‘Jesus Christus Rex Florentini populi
s. p. decreto electus’) was altered by Cosimo I. to ‘Rex regum et
Dominus dominantium’. To the left of the entrance is a tablet
showing the result of the plebiscite of 1860. From 1504 down to
1873 the famous statue of David by Michael Angelo, which is now
in the Academy (p. 493), stood here. On the right is a group of
Hercules and Cacus by Michael Angelo’s rival Baccio Bandimlli,
who heped to excel the great master in this work (p. IV). The two
insigniﬁcant statues by Bandinclli and Rossi on each side of the

entrance were used as chain-posts.-

The outer Coun'r was renewed by Michelosso in the Renaissance style
in 1454. The elaborate decorations of the columns, the grotesques on the
ceiling, and the faded views of Austrian towns were added by Marco do
Faenza in 1565, in honour of the marriage of Francesco (afterwards Grand-
Duke) to Johanna of Austria. In the centre, above a large basin of porphm’
(1555), is a *Boy with a ﬁsh as a fountain-ﬁgure, by Andr. Verrocdtt'o,
originally made for a villa of Lorenzo de‘ Medici. At the back are Samson
and a Philistine (a caricature of Michael Angelo) by Rossi. The armorial
bearings above the colonnade include those of Florence (lily), the People
(cross), the Parte Gnelfa (ea 1e), and the Medici (balls), and the combined
colours (red and white) of F cranes and Fiesole.

Interior (guide, unnecessary, 2 fr.). Entering by the door on the left,
we ascend the stairs to the FIBBT noon and enter (door on the right) the
GREAT HALL (Sula det' Cinquecento; always Open), constructed by cream
in 1495 for the Great Council, created on the expulsion of the Medici. I:
was occupied as puarters for the Spanish troops in 1512, and reconstructed
by Vasart in 156 et seq. In 1569 Cosimo I. here assumed the dignity of
grand-duke, and in 1860-69 the hall was used for the sittings of the Italian
Parliament. In 1503 Leonardo da Wart and Michael Angelo were con:-
missioned to decorate the hall with frescoes from Florentine history.
Leonardo executed a cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari (defeat of the
Milanese in 1440), and Michael Angelo designed his ‘Bathing Soldim‘
(Florentines surprised by the Pisans before the battle of Cascina, in 138-1).
Both cartoons have perished (Michael Angelo‘s torn up by Baccio Bandinelli
in 1512), as well as the small ortion from Do. Vinci’s transferred in fresco
to the walls (Battle fer the standard). The hall is now adorned with
frescoes (on the walls and cassetted ceiling) by Vasari and his pupils
representing scenes from the were against Pisa and Siena, with tapestry.
and with six groups of the labours of Hercules by Roast“. By the end-
wall (8.) is a colossal marble Status ofSaeonarola, by Paggi, 1881. Opposite
are portrait-statues of the Medici by Bacct'o Bandineut’. — The adjoining

is seldom accessible. The Bald di Leone 1. is adorned with scenes from the
life of that p0pe; in the Salotto di Clemente Settimo is a view of besieged
Florence; the Camera dt' Giovanni delle Bands Nero contains portraits of
that Medicean, of his mother Caterina Sforza, of his wife Maria Salviati,
and of Cosimo 1., as a boy; in the Camera dt' Cosimo Mme, that prince appears
surrounded by artists; there is a similar picture in the Camera di Lormo
it Magniﬁco. The ﬁgures are all by Vasan‘; the grotesque designsby Recent.

Returning from the Great Hall to the stairway and traversing a corridor
which passes a ﬁne marble doorway (15th cent.), we enter the Sana nsr
Deena-r0 (custodian in the Ufﬁzio del Sindaco, fee 50 c.), now the meeting
place of the Consiglio Municipale. The ﬁne coﬁ'ered ceiling. from "‘5
designs of Michelozzo (7), dates from 1474; the tapestry, after Breast” and
other masters, represents the story of Joseph. -—We next ascend to the
Snconn FLoon, containing the nan-rises m Ennonou DI TOLEDO (adm.
