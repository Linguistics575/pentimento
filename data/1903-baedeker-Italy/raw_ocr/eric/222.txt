LOMBARDY. 111

1187, formed the headquarters of the former, and Oremona those of the
latter party, and the power of the Hohenstaufen proved to be no match
for the Lombard walls. The internal dissensions between the nobles and
the burghers which prevailed in every town, led to the creation of several
new principalities. In 1277 Archbishop Ottoue degli Visconti of Milan (whose
family was so called from their former ofﬁce of ‘vicecomites‘ or archiepisc-
opal judges) was nominated ‘Capitano del Popolo‘, and in 1294 Matteo
Viacom, his nephew, was appointed governor of Lombardy by the German
ting. Although banished for a time by the Guelph family Della Torre,
hath Matteo and his sons and their posterity contrived to assert their
right to the Signoria. The greatest of this family were Lucchino Visconti
(1339-49), Patrarch‘s patron, and Giovanni Galeauo, who succeeded his
father Galcauo II. (p. 129; d. 1378) as ruler of the W. portion of the
district of Milan. In 1385 Giovanni wrested the reins of government in
the E. portion also from his uncle Bernabo, and afterwards extended his
. duchy to Pisa and Bologna, and even as far as Perugia and Spoleto. His
chief concern was to raise taxes for the purpose of carrying on war, but
it the same time the country ﬂourished under his just and systematic
government. The municipal councillors were entrusted with administrative
and executive powers in matters of police, while artists and men of
letters were invited to the court by the prince, who founded the Cath-
edral at Milan and the Certosa at Pavia. But after his death in 1402 chaos
came again.

On the extinction of the Visconti family with the death of Filippo Maria
in 1447, Milan declared itself a republic under the name Repubblica di Sant‘

‘. In 1&0, however, Francesco Bforza the condoitiere, who had

been elected general-in-chief by the ‘capitani’ of the republic, made himself
duh? and restored order and security to the distracted state. He rebuilt
the astello, constructed the Martesana Canal and the Ospedale Magglore
and surrounded himself with Byzantine and Italian scholars, who applauds
the Latin crations of his daughter Hippolyta. Francesco died in 1466, and his
tit-loving but dissolute son, Galeazzo Maria, was assassinated ten years later
In the church of Santo Stefano, leaving his son Giovanni Galeazzo still a minor.
Ludovico it More seized the regency in name of his nephew, and on the death
01' the latter in 1494, he induced Charles VIII. of France to undertake a
campaign against Naples, thus inaugurating a new period in the history
0f Italy. Since that time Italy has at once been the battleﬁeld and the
My of the great powers of EurOpe. Lodovico himself, after having
revolted against France and been defeated at Novara in 1500, terminated
his career in a French dungeon. In 1525 the battle of Pavia constituted
Charles V. arbiter of the fortunes of Italy. In 1540 five years after the
death of the last Sforza, he invested his son, Philip 11. of Spain with
the duchy of Milan. In 1714 the Spanish supremacy was followed by the
Austrian in consequence of the War of Succession. 0n four occasions
(1733 1745, 1796, and 1800) the French took possession of Milan, and the
.4119 conic period at length swept away the last relics of its medieeval
Institutions. Although Napoleon annexed the whole of Piedmont, Genoa,
Puma, Tuscany, and Rome (about 36,000 sq. M. of Italian territory) to
Funcei the erection of the Oisalpias Republic (1797) and then of a Kingdom
911}le (1805) contributed materially to arouse a national spirit of pat—
n(ltlsm. This kingdom embraced Lombardy, Venice, 8. Tyrol, Istria,
“30 greater part of the Emilia, and the Marches. Milan was the capital,
"1d Napoleon was king, but was represented by his stepson Eugene
.Biauhamais. The Austrian Supremacy, which was restored in 1815, proved
u'Pﬁttoncilable with the national aspirations of the people. By the Peace
of Zurich (10th Nov., 1859) Lombardy, with the exception of the district
0‘ lantua, was ceded to Napoleon III., and by him to Sardinia.
