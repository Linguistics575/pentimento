A little to the S. of S. Giovanni in Bragora is the Riva degli

We may go towards the E., past San Martino, begun by Sanso-
vino in 1540, completed in 1653 (facade of 1897). Within is a font
with four kneeling angels by Tullio Lombardo, 1484; above the
main entrance, Last Supper by Girolamo da Santa Croce, 1549.
Farther on is the *Arsenal (Pl. K, L, 5), founded in 1104 and re-
peatedly enlarged in the 14th, 15th, and 19th centuries. At the
zenith of the Republic it employed 16,000 workmen, but in the
18th cent. 2000-3000 at most, and at present about 3000. At the
entrance rise four famous antique lions, brought from the Piraeus in
1687; the body of the large one on the left bears Runic inscriptions
(by the Normans, 10th cent. ‘2). Handsome Renaissance gateway of
1460. — Admission, see p. 265.

Interesting collection of models of ships of all periods, including a model
and the scanty remains of the Bucintoro, a vessel destroyed by the French,
from which the Doge was wont annually on Ascension Day to throw the

of the system of piles on which the city is to a great extent built (comp.

On the facade of the museum are the monuments of Count van der
Schulenburg, marshal in the Venetian service (d. 1747). who directed the
famous defence of Corfu against the Turks in 1716, and of Count Koem'gs-
marck (d. 1688), another celebrated warrior, who conquered the Turks in
the Morea and took Athens in 1987.

We next follow the Rio dctt’ Arsenalc to the S. to the church
of San Biagio (P1. K, 6), containing the tomb of Admiral Angelo Emo
(see above), by Oanova’s teacher Ferrari-Torretti. A monument by
Benvenuti, in front of the church (1885), commemorates the ad-
mirable service of the soldiers in the inundation of March, 1882.

L» M, 6, 7), a pretty park , 20 acres in extent, laid out by Na-
poleon in 1807 on a space obtained by the demolition of several
monasteries. At the entrance from’ the Via Garibaldi is a bronze
Monument of Garibaldi by Michieli (1887). In the NE. corner, on
the Canale di Sant’ Elena, is the Palazzo dcll’ Esposisionc Artistica,
erected for the biennial art exhibitions inaugurated in 1895 (p. 264).
