" Ascending the staircase from Room XVI to the second ﬂoor, we
enter the GALLERIA DBGLI Anazzr (tapestry). Excellent catalogue

(1884), 1 fr.

The ﬁrst rooms contain ancient woven and embroidered stuﬂs of the
14th (Life and Coronation of the Virgin, in the second room) and
cent., and ﬁne specimens of velvet, gold-brocade, and damask of the 16th,
17th, and 18th centuries. -- Then come the Anazzr, the produce of the
Florentine tapestry—factory which was founded in 1545 under Cosimo L by
Nicolaus Karcher and Jan van Roost of Brussels, and which rospered and
fell with the house of Medici. The word Arazzi, like the nglish Arras,
is derived from the town of Arras in French Flanders, one of the most
celebrated ancient seats 01 tapestr -manufactnre; the French term ‘Gobc-
lins‘ is elsewhere more general. he cartoons for the tapestiy exhibited
here were designed in the 16th cent. by Bromine (Nos. 11 , 1 , 123),
via“ (Nos. 111, 118-120), Baceht'acca (Nos. 13-19, 20-23), Altos-t (Nos. 26, 28,
33, 49), Btradano, Poccetti, and others. The imitation of painting in tapestry
was carried to an extreme in the 17th cent. by Pierre Fecere of Paris, in
whose hands the decorative character of the produce deteriorated (Nos. 24.
25, 31, 37, 39-43, 92, 99, 112-116, 124, History of Esther, 75-80). The mann-
factory was closed in 1737. -— Here also are some German tapestries of the
15th cent. (David and Bathsheba, 60-65), and some from the Netherlands
of the 15th (No. 68) and 16th cent. (Nos. 71-74, 88-90, Henri III and Ca-
tharine de‘ Medici, 67-69).

In the same street, at the corner of the Via di Pinti, is situated
the church of Santa Maria Haddalena de’ Paui (Pl. H, 5). The
graceful anterior court was designed by Giuliano da Sumac
(1479) ; the columns were modelled after an antique capital found
at Fiesole. In the 2nd chapel, on the left, is a Coronation of the
Virgin by Cosimo Rossetti (1505); the richly decorated chapel of
the high-altar is by Ciro Fen-i, the altar-piece by Luca Giordano.
