Eustorgio) succeeded in introducing the Tuscan early-Renaissance style,
and this only after protracted struggles with the Lombard masters, who
clung obstinately to the pointed arch. Their inﬂuence, along with traces
of that of N. art, is mirrored in the Lombardic school of sculpture, which
grew up about 1460 and gradually extended its activity to Venice. Genoa,
and even 5. Italy. Its principal masters the brothers Antonio and Cristoforo
HantEgazza, Gian. Ant. Amadeo (1447-1552), Cristoforo Solar-i (d. after-1525),
and am. Radar-i, may best be studied in the Gertosa in Pavia, the Cappella
Colleoni in Bergamo, and the Cathedral of Como. The decline of the style
is shown in the late works of Agostino Bum, surnamed Bambaja (ca. 11180-
5 A more serious and realistic conception is revealed by the versatile
Crawforo Poppa, surnamed Caradosso (ca. 1445-1527), who is also famous
as a medal-engraver and goldsmith. — The e‘arlier painters of this eriod,
such as Vincents Foppa (d. 492), who seems to have been trained in adua,
and his pupil Ambrogio Borgognone (d. 1528), remained faithful to the local
tradition. .

Milanese art reached the zenith of its reputation as the residence of
Bramante (1472—1500), to whom are due the choir and (101116 of Santa Maria
delle Grazia and the baptistery of San Satiro, and of Leonardo da Vinci
(1&85-1500 and 1506-16). The latter here executed his masterpieces: the
Last Supper and the clay model of the equestrian monument of Francesco
St'orza, destroyed by the French in 1499. Among the pupils of Leonardo
were the painters Giovanni Antonio Boltrafﬁo , Marco d‘Oggz'ono, Andrea
Salaiuo, Cesare da Basic, and Gianpieln‘no; and his inﬂuence is also mani-
fest in the works of Bernardc'no Laini, Andrea Solarto, Gaudensio Ferrari,
and Giov. Ant. Bazzt‘ (it deoma).

We recognize Bramante‘s style in many buildings of Lombardy, such
as Santa Maria in Busto Arsizio, the church of Abbiategrasso, Santa Maria
delle Croce at Crema, the Cathedral and Santa Maria de Canepanova at
Pavia, the Incoronata at Lodi. Milan itself owes its resent architectural
physiognomy rather to the masters of the late—Rena ssance: — Galeazzo
Atari (p. 71; Pal. Marine), Vino. Scream (1509-94; Pal. dei Giureconsulti,
Pal. d.i Giustizia), and Pellsgrmo Tibaldc‘ of Bologna (1532-96; court of the
Archiepiscopal Palace). The churches by these architects (San Paolo, San
Vittore, San Fedele, lower part of the cathedral facade) show the tran-
sition to the baroque style. The most important architect of the 17th cent.
was Riochim‘ (Brera, parts of the Ospedale Maggiore).

The three earlier Procaccini, the chief painters after 1550, betra the
mannerism of the Carracci, while Ercole Procaccim' the Younger (1596- 676),
Gioo. Bait. Craspt, surnamed II Gerano (1557-1633), Daniele Crespt (1590-1630),
and Carla Franc. Nwoloni (1608-61) are vigoz-ous disciples of the same
eclectic masters (p. 365). —— The scul ture of this period is insigniﬁcant.

In recent times Milan has raised itself to the highest artistic rank in
the kingdom. Sculpture is here carried on to such an extent as to have
become almost a special industry. The Milanese Sconrrons take great
pride in their technical skill, and in eﬂ'ective imitations of nature.

Quarters of the City. The Brera.

The focus of the commercial and public life of Milan is the
*Piazza del Duomo (Pl. E, 5), which has been much extended
since 1876, and is now enclosed on the N. and S. by imposing edi-
fices designed by Mongoni (p. 120). It is a centre for electric
tramways.

The celebrated “Cathedral (Pl. E, F, 5), dedicated ‘Mariac
Nascenti’, as the inscription on the facade announces, and as the
gilded statue on the tower over the dome also indicates, is built on
the site of the smaller early-Christian basilica of Santa Maria
