Pope Alexander VI., perished at the stake in 1498, but his inﬂuence endured.
Pier-o Sodsrim‘, elected as gonfaloniere for life in 1502, succeeded in re-
capturing Pisa, which had been freed by the French; but in 1512 the party
of the Medici regained the upper hand and recalled the brothers Giuliano
and Giovanni. The former soon resigned his authority, the latter became
P0pe Leo X., and they were followed by Lorenzo, son of Piero II. and
afterwards Duke of Urbino (d. 1519), Giulio, the son of the Giuliano who
was murdered in 1478 (elected pope, as Clement VII., in 1523), and Ale:-
sandro, a natural son of the last-named Lorenzo. The family was again
banished in 1527, but Emp. Charles V., who had married his natural
daughter Margaret (afterwards Duchess of Parma) to Alessandro, attacked
the town and took it in 1530 after a siege of eleven months, during which
Michael Angelo, as engineer on the side of the republic, and the brave
partisan Ferruccio greatly distinguished themselves. The emperor then
appointed Alessandro hereditary Duke of Florence. The assassination of
the latter, perpetrated by his own cousin Lorenzo, 7th Jan., 1537, did not
conduce to the re-establishment of the republic. He was succeeded by
Cosimo I. (b. 1519), son of Giovanni delle Bands Nere (d. 1526), the only
soldier of the Medici family, who was a descendant of Lorenzo, brother
of the elder Cosimo. The armed revolt of the Florentine republicans in
1537 was suppressed with the aid of B anish troops (p. 428); and in 1196
Francesco Burlamacchi, gonfaloniere o Lucca, who had attempted to or
ganize all Tuscany as a united republic, expiated his failure on the scaffold.
Cosimo, who obtained the title of Grand-duke in 1569, now succeeded in
combining the most varied territories into a single monarchical state, which
included the entire basin of the Arno, with Arezzo, Cortona, Montepnlciano,
Volterra, Pisa, Pescia, Pisa, and (after a bloody war that began in 1555)
also Siena. Modern history, see p. 399.

The traveller interested in historical research should observe the
numerous memorial tablets in various parts of Florence, recording import.
ant events in the annals of the town.
