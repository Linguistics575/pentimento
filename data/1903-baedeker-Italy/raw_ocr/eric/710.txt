(p. 520) and affording beautiful views. — The alley at the NE. corner of
the Ne tune basin leads to the CAsmo Banvaosu (Pl. D, 7), from the lofty
roof 0 which a ﬁne 'View of the city is obtained (fee 15-20 c.).

We now return to the Basin of Neptune and follow the alley lead-
ing from its N.W. corner to a lawn, also aﬂ’ording a tine View. We may
descend direct from this point, but it is better to follow the Vtottolm to
the S.W., a beautiful cypress avenue adorned with statues and leading
past a small orangery to a charming BAsm (ta Vasca dell‘ Isototto; Pl. B, 7).
In the centre, on an sland planted with ﬂowers, rises a fountain surmounted
by a colossal statue of Oceanus and ﬁgures of three river-gods by Gio-
vanni da Bologna. The surrounding walks are chieﬂy embellished with
‘genre‘ works. To the right of the Oceanus basin a broad path, parallel
with the palace, is reached, which leads past a lemon-house to the prin-
cipal entrance. Another exit, reached by a. side-path diverging to the left,
immediately beyond the lemon-house and near a fountain with Bacchus
on the lion, leads into the Via Romana.

A little to the S. of the above-mentioned basin are the Beale Scuden‘e,
or Royal Ems (P1. B, 7, 8), containing a collection of ancient state-carriages
(adm. 10-3; permesso in the ‘Amministrazione‘ of the Pal. Pitti, see p. 487).

At Via Roman 19, to the W. of the Pitti Palace, is the Museum of
Natural Science (Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturatc; Pl. 0, 6; adm.,
,see p. 437), founded by Leopold 1., and since greatly extended.

The public museum is on the Sitcom) FLooa; the z0010gical collections
occupy about 20, the botanical 8 rooms. There is also an admirable ana-
tomical collection in 12 rooms, consisting chieﬂy of preparations in wax,
by Clements Susini and his successors the two Catsmuoh‘ and Calumet.

On the FIRBT FLooa (r.) is situated the TRIBUNA or GALano, inaugur-
ated in 1841, on the occasion of the assembly at Florence of the principal
scholars of Italy, constructed by Giuseppe Martetlt and adorned with
paintings by Giuseppe Bennett, Luigi Sabatelh‘, etc., iliustrating the history
of Galileo, Volta, and other men of science; also a statue of Galileo by
A. Costolz', numerous busts of celebrated men, and mosaics in the avement,
designed by Sabatetlt, and executed by Gian. Batt. Silvestri. long the
walls are six cabinets containing Galileo‘s telescope and other instru-
ments of historic interest.

Opposite stands the ancient church of Ban Felice (Pl. 0, 6),
with a ﬁne porch, rebuilt in 1457 by Micheloszo (‘?): ist altar to the
left, Filippino Lippi (?), Three Saints; 2nd altar to the right, Giov.
della Robbie (7), Pieta, a coloured relief in clay; above, opposite
the high-altar, Giotto, Cruciﬁxion.

No. 9, Piazza San Felice, is the Casa Gutdc‘, in which Robert and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning lived from 1818 till the death of the latter
in 1861 (tablet with Italian inscription). See her poem, ‘Casa Guidi Win-
dows‘. The house now belongs to their son, Mr. B. Barrett Browning,
who was born here.

 

Immediately adjoining the Ponte alts Grazia (Pl. E, F, 6, 7;
p. 445) is the Piazza de’ Mozzi, in which (No. 6) rises the Palazzo
Torrigiani (Pl. E, 7), erected in the 16th cent. by Baccio d’Agnolo
and others, but disﬁgured by alterations. [The Giardino Torrigiani
(P1. A, 5, 6), in the Via de’ Serragli, is closed at present]

Near the Pal. Torrigiani begins the VIA nn’ BARDI(P1. D, E, 6, 7),
which takes its name from one of the most powerful mediteval
families in Florence. Immediately to the right is the small church of
SANTA LUCIA DEI MAGNOLI (Pl. E, 7), containing a relief by the Delta
Robbia above the door, and an Annunciation by Jae. del Sellaio
