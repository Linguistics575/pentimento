Vela (1855). In the treasury (above the sacristy) are a large cruciﬁx (5 ft.

The adjoining ’Oappella Colleoni (shown by the sagrestano), erected
by 6.1. Amadeo in 1470-76 in the early-Renaissance style, has a lavishly
sculptured fagade, which, however, was probably much altered when the
interior was modernized in 1774. The interior contains the tomb of the
founder Bart. Colleoni (d. 1475; p. 304), begun by G. Ant. Amadeo, with
reliefs from the life of Christ. On the tap is the gilded equestrian statue
of Colleoni by Siam: Sir-y of Nuremberg (1501). To the ri ht is the
smaller, but beautiful monument of his daughter Medea (d. i470), also
, by Amadeo, and originally in the church of Basella. Above the altar on

the right are good sculptures; to the left, a Holy Family by Angelica

Kauﬁmann; line intarsia-work (covered); ceiling-paintings by Mole.

The adjoining Baptistery (P1. 3; on the right), by Giov. da Gam-

. pione (1340), originally in Santa Maria Maggiore, was re-erected
here in 1898. In the interior are reliefs of the Passion (key in the
sacristy of the cathedral; fee 30-50 c.).

Opposite is the Cathedral (P1. 13), built from designs by Vino.
Scamoszi in 1614 on the site of an earlier ediﬁce. First altar to the
left: Madonna and saints by G. B. Moroni (1676); behind the
high-altar, a *Madonna, a late work of Glen. Bellini (1512; gen-
erally covered).

A little to the E. of the Piazza Garibaldi, in the Via Colleoni,
is the Luogo Pio Colleom‘ (Pl. 4; C, 2), once the dwelling of Bart.
Galleoni, who bequeathed it to the city for an orphanage in 1466.
On the groundﬂoor are some frescoes by Pamino do. Nova and other
masters of the 15th cent; among them is an equestrian portrait of
Colleoni (fee of 1/2 fr. to the keeper).

We now return to the station of the cable-tramway and proceed
thence, to the left, through the Strada Porta Dipinta, passing the
church of Sant’ Andrea, which contains a Madonna enthroned with
four saints, by Moretto (altar to the right; covered). Fine view.
The street leads to a small and hilly piazza with the church of San
Michele al Posse Bianca (P1. 18, D 2; usually closed), which con-
tains good frescoes by Lor. Lotto, representing the Annunciation
and the Nativity and Marriage of the Virgin (chapel to the left of
the choir; partly concealed by the altar-piece). -—— We may proceed
to the right through the Via Osmano to the ramparts (p. 194), or
continue to follow the Strada Ports Dipinta to the left to the Porto
Sant’ Agostino (Pl. D, 2), near which is the old Gothic church of
the same name (now a barrack). — Just below the gate a footpath,
