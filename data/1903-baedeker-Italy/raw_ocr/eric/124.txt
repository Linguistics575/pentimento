Environs. TURIN. 7. Route. 39

Near the Monte dei Cappuccini, opposite the Ponte Vittorio
Emanuele Prime (see above), stands the large domed church of
“Indra di Dio (Pl. G, 4), erected by Ferd. Bonsignore in 1818-31
in imitation of the Pantheon at Reme, to commemorate the return
of King Victor Emmanuel I. in 1814. In front of the church rises a
Honument of Victor Emmanuel I. (d. 1824), by Gaggini. —— A few
hundred yards to the E. is the Villa delta Regina. (P1. H, 5), now a
school for the daughters of ofﬁcers who have fallen in battle.

 

The Cemetery (Campo Santa Generals; Pl. G, H, 1), 1% M. to
the N.E. of the Piazza Castello (open 10-4 in winter in ﬁne weather;
in March, April, Sept, and Oct. 9-6; in summer 8-12 and 2-7), is
entered from the end of the Via Catania, which is reached from the
Polite delle Benne by the Strada del Regio Parco, a shady avenue
(steam-tramway from the Piazza Emanuele Filiberto, p. 36). In the
front section, to the left by the wall, is the tomb of Silvio Pellico
(11.1854); in the section behind we observe the names of D’Azeglio,
BM, Brofferio, Gioberti, Pepe, Pinelli, and other eminent Italians.

The *Superga. (2205 ft.), the royal burial-church since 1778,
umpicuously situated on a hill to the E. of Turin, is well worthy
e a visit. A steam-tramway plies from the Piazza Castello to the
ﬁlage of (3 M.) Guest in 1/2 hr. ; thence we reach the tap by cable-
inm in 20 min.; no change of carriages in the case of trout diretti;

[on Sun. and holidays 2 fr. 40 or 1 fr. 75 c.). From Sassi the top
may also be reached on foot in 11/2 hr. by a shady road (to the right

The Superga, a votive offering dedicated by Victor Amadeus II.
on the occasion of the raising of the siege of Turin in 1706 (p. 24),
and erected in 1717-31 from designs by Juvara, is a handsome
ediﬁce with a lofty dome and an imposing portico in the style of an
antique temple, and has a spacious octagonal interior. It includes
{library and a suite of royal apartments (never occupied). We enter
. ”the door on the left of the church. In the interior (closed 12-2)
' are shown a room hung with indifferent portraits of all the popes, the
ﬁnch, the Archangel Michael contending with the Devil, a marble
Mp by Carlo Fimlli (1842), and the crypt containing monuments

y. the Alps, from Monte Viso to the Adamello Group (comp. p. 38,
