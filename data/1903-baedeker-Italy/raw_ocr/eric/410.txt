CASTELFRANCO. 41. Route. 257

:22 M. .Gastelfranoo Veneto (130 ft.; Alb. delta Spada, very fair,
and prettily situated, R. 2 fr.; Alb. Stella d’Oro; Cam) dcl Genie, at
the Spade), a pleasant country-town with 12,440 inhab., in the
centreof which rise the towers and walls of its old castle, shaded by
venerable plane-trees. This town was the birthplace of the painter
Giorgio Barbarellt, surnamed Il Giorgione (about 1477-1512; comp.
p. 268), a marble statue of whom by Benvenuti adorns the piazza
(1882]. Behind the hi gh-altar of the Cathedral is a ”Madonna with
88. Francis and Liberalis by that master'(1504; restored); in the
sacristy are frescoes of Justice, Prudence, Time, Fame, and four
Gupids, by Paolo Veronese, early works brought from the Villa
Soranza (painted in 1551).

From Castelfranco (or from Cornuda, p. 323) a visit may be paid to the
Villa Giacomelli, near Maser, which may be reached b carriage (6-8 fr.)
in 1% hr. (A pleasant detour may be made by Asolo or by antelo, see below.)
- The ‘Villa Giacomelli (formerly Mania,- not always open in winter,
when the preprietor is away frgm home), often called Villa Hater from
the neighbouring village of Ma: r, was erected by Palladio (1666-80) and is
celebrated for its *Frescoes by Paolo Veronese, executed in 1566-68 fer the
Venetian patrieian Marcantonio Barbaro, and ranking among the master’s
best works. They consist of mgthological representations and scenes
from social life, grandly conceive , while some of the illusive ﬁgures so
common in the later period of art are introduced. Thus, by the entrance,
I girl and a page, who through a half-opened door apparently watch
the ersons entering. In the dining-room, upon its fantastically painted
architecture, are seated Ceres with her train and Cupids. The ceiling
of the great hall is decorated with the Councils of the Gods and the
Feast of the Gods on Mount Olympus. Those who wish to obtain a good
idea of a patrieian abode of the luxurious 16th cent. should not omit
this excursion. The cha el attached to the villa contains stucco-work by
Al. Vittoria. -- About 41 3M. to the W. of Maser, on a prominent ridge a
little above the road to (14 M.) Banana (see below), lies Asolo (Inn), the city
(now with 900 inhab. only) to which the widowed queen Catharine Cornaro
retired on her abdication (p. 266). Catharine retained her title and ‘signed
herself %ueen of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia, and Lady of Asolo. There
she live , dispensing justice, founding a pawnshop for the assistance of
the poor, distributing corn, gratis, in years of distress, listening to the
courtly conversation of Cardinal Bembo, and amusing herself in the gar-
dens of her summon-house on the plain‘ (Horatio F. Brown). The Parish
Ghureh contains a ﬁne altar‘piece (Madonna with 88. Anthony Abbas and
Basil) by Lorenzo Lotto (early work; 1606).
