The Gondlilas and Barche take the place of cabs at Venice. Their
‘stands‘ are at the hotels and ferries (traghetti). The light Venetian Gon-
dolas, with a low black cabin (fiche) and black leather seat, hold 4-6

ersons. They are ﬁrst heard 0 in a document of 1094 and are painted

lack in conformity with a law passed in the 15th century. The Barca
or Baﬂsllo is a larger craft, carrying 8 persons. The heavy ndented piron
row (fsrro), resembling a halberd, is partly intended to counterbalance the
weight of the rower, and partly as ameasure of the height of the bridges,
which cannot be passed unless the ferro, the highest part of the craft,
clears them. The rower himself is hailed as ‘Poppc’, from the poppa on
which he stands. ‘Caoar ll felss‘ means ‘to remove the cabin or covering‘.
The shouts of the gondoliers on turning a corner are weird and melancholy:
a-bel means ‘look out‘, sia stall, ‘keep to the right‘, sta prsml, ‘keep to the
left‘, sta di lungs, ‘keep straight on‘.

The Tamrr, which must be shown on demand, applies to the adjoining

islands as well as to Venice itself. Gondola for 1-4, or a barca for
1-6 persons, with one rower Prensa”), for the first hour 1 fr., by night 1 fr.
30 c., for each additional half-hour 60c. This rate covers the whole city,
including the Giudecca, San Giorgio Maggiore, and San Michele. For trips
to the Lido, San Lassaro, Murano, etc., the charge is 1/2 fr. more for every
hour or part of an hour. For a whole day (10 hrs.) the charge is Bi'r.
For a larger number of passengers the charges are one-half higher. For
short distances at bargain should be made. For a second rower double the
ordinary fare is charged, but a bargain may be made. One however,
sufﬁces for trips in the town (‘basta uno‘). For public festivities bargain-
ing is necessary. Only gondolas with numbers should be engaged, and
the visitor should select one for himself, disregarding all proﬁ‘ers of
assistance. The owner of the selected boat will immediately present
himself, and the visitor should then indicate what he is willing to pay,
3.g. San“ Giovanni s Paolo mezza lira (1/2 in). if the tariff price is rejected,
another boat should he selected.~ if the gondola is hired by the hour,
:he passenger shows his watch, saying ‘all‘ ora‘. In addition to the fare a
gmall fee is always expected (for half-day I/2-1 fr.). If any difﬁculty arises
it is best to apply to a policeman ( Guardta municipals). — The ‘Rampini’ or
Ganzerl’ (hookers), who assist passengers to disembark, expect a gratuity
.f 2-3 centimes. Care should be taken in embarking and disembarking,
.specially when the tide is low, exposing the slimy lower steps.
