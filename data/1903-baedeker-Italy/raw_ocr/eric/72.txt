them. Later he basked in the favour of Charles V. and Philip II. of
Spain. The natural result of this was that the painting of portraits
and of mythological subjects engrossed the greater part of his time
and talents. That Titian’s genius, however, was by no means alien
to religion and deep feeling in art, and that his imagination was as
rich and powerful in this ﬁeld as in pourtraying realistic and son-
sually attractive forms of existence, is proved by his ecclesiastical
paintings, of which the ﬁnest are the Pesaro Madonna (p. 311), the
Martyrdom of St. Lawrence (p. 301), the Presentation in the Temple
(p. 290), and the Assumption (p. 285) at Venice.

Owing to the soundness of the principles on which the Venetian
school was based, there is no wide gulf between its masters of the
highest and those. of secondary rank , as is so often the case in the
other Italian schools; and we accordingly ﬁnd that works by LO-
mzo Lo'r'ro, Sanas'rrm mar. P1011130 (p. lvii), the Bommzros, Pon-
DBNONB, Pams BOBDONB, and Jaooro TINTORBTTO frequently vie
in beauty with those of the more renowned chiefs of their school.
Even PAOLO CALIABI, surnamed Vnnonnsn (1528—88), the last great
master of his school, shows as yet no trace of the approaching
period of decline , but continues to delight the beholder with his
delicate silvery tints and the spirit and richness of his compositions.

Correggio, as well as subsequent Venetian masters, were fre-
quently taken as models by the Italian painters of the 17th century,
and the inﬂuence they exercised could not fail to be de-
tected even by the amateur, if the entire post—Raphaelite
period were not usually overlooked. Those, however, who
make the great cinquecentists their principal study will doubtless
be 10th to examine the works of their successors. Magniﬁcent de-
corative works are occasionally encountered, but the taste is
offended by the undisguised love of pomp and superﬁcial man-
nerism which they generally display. Artists no longer ear-
nestly identify themselves with the ideas they embody; they
mechanically reproduce the customary themes, they lose the desire,
and ﬁnally the ability to compose independently. They are, more-
over, deﬁcient in taste for beauty of form, which, as is well known,
is most attractive when most simple and natural. Their technical
skill is not the result of mature experience, slowly acquired and
justly valued: they came into easy possession of great resources of
art, which they frivolously and unworthily squander. The quaint,
the extravagant, the piquant alone stimulates their taste; rapidity,
not excellence of workmanship, is their aim. Abundant specimens
of this mannerism, exempliﬁed in the works of Zuccano, D’Anrmo,
Txnrns'ra , and others, are encountered at Rome and Florence
(cupola of the cathedral). The fact that several works of this
class produce a less unfavourable impression does not alter their
general position, as it is not want of talent so much as of con-v
scientiousness which is attributed to these artists.
