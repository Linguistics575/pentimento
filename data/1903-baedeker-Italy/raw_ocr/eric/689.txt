“if. From the Piazza del Duomo to San Lorenzo and Santa [aria

Novella.

From the entrance of the Via dc’ Cerretani, which leads straight
from the Piazza del Duomo (p. 460) to Santa Maria Novella, the Borgo
S. Lorenzo runs to the right to the PIAZZA SAN LonBNzo (Pl. F, 4).
To the left in this square is the church of S. Lorenzo, and at its
N. end, near the Via de’ Ginori (p. 490), is a statue of Giovanni
delle Bands Ncre (p. 442), by Baccio Bandinelli (1540), on a
pedestal (‘Base di San Lorenzo’), with reliefs referring to Giovanni’s
victories. ‘

*San Lorenzo (Pl. E, F, 3, 4), founded and consecrated by St. Am-
brose in 394 and restored in the 11th cent., is one of the most
ancient churches in Italy. In 1425 the Medici and seven other fam-
ilies began a complete reconstruction of the church on a larger
scale from the designs of Filippo anelleschi, who restored the
form of the early—Christian basilica, consisting of a nave and aisles
terminated by a transept, the nave being covered with a ﬂat ceiling,
and the aisles with groined vaulting. He then added low chapels
resembling recesses on each side. Over the columns (14 in number,
and two pillars) he replaced the ancient architrave which had been
removed in the middle ages, and now support the fine projecting
arches. (The cupola, which rests upon the cross without the inter-
position of a drum, was added by Brunelleschi’s successor, Ant
Manetti (d. 1460). The high-altar was consecrated in 1461. The
inner wall of the facade is by Michael Angelo, who also added the
New Sacristy (p. 500) and the Laurentian Library. His design for
the outside of the facade (1516) was unfortunately never executed,
but is preserved in the Galleria Buonarroti (p. 480). The com-

selected by himself, in which he was laid on Aug. 2nd, 1464, according to
his own request without any funereal pomp. The slab is a copy of the
original by Verrocchio. The Signoria honoured Cosimo‘s memory by passing
a decree which gave him the title of ‘Pater Patriae". Donatello is buried in
the same vault. —- In the 2nd chapel to the left of the choir the monument

Sacnrs'rr, to the left, built in 1421-28 by Fil. Brunelleecht', is one of the
earliest achievements of Renaissance architecture. It is covered with a
p‘tiillygonal dome, the projection with the altar having a small ﬂat done.

e admirable plastic decoration (now whitewashed) is by Donatello: above
the bronze doors, which are adorned with reliefs, are two saints, beneath
a frieze of angels’ heads; in the lunettcs are the Evangelists and on the
