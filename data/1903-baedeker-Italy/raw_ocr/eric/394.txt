In the vicinity is the 'Teatro Olimpico (Pl. 0, 2; custodian to
the left, behind the theatre, Contrada Teatro Olimpico No. 987; fee
1/2 fr.), begun by Palladio in 1579, completed in 1584, after his
death, by Scamozzi, and inaugurated by the performance of the
‘(Edipus Tyrannus’ of Sophocles. Palladio adhered generally to the
precepts of Vitruvius as to the construction of ancient theatres, but
the building is far from being a mere imitation. The auditorium
rises in thirteen semi-oval tiers, while the orchestra and the two-
storied stage lie 5 ft. below the level of the seats. The three door-
openings at the back of the stage aﬁ'ord views of ascending streets,
in curiously deceptive relief.

The Contrada di Santa Corona, diverging just before the E. and
of the Corso, leads to the Dominican church of Santa Corona (P1.
C, 2), a Gothic brick ediﬁce of 1260-1300, with a plain facade.

2nd altar on the left, Five saints by Bart. Montague (in rich Renaissance

donna of the 14th cent., with angels by Fogoh’no (ca. 1530), beside it, two
saints, in fresco; 5th altar, ‘Baptism of Christ by Giovanni Bell-int, in a
ﬁne frame a late work and one of the ﬁnest productions of the master
(about 1501?). Cha el to the right of the choir, two ﬁne Gothic mural mon-
uments (15th cent. .

The Contrada Santo Stefano, Opposite, a little to the right, leads
to Santa Stefano (Pl. C, 2); in the left transept, Palma Vecchio,
*Madonna with St. Lucia and George, an admirable example of his
middle period (best light in the morning).

Opposite, to the left, in the Contrada Giacomo Zanella, stands
the unﬁnished Pataszo Thiene (now the Banca Popotare), the front
designed by Palladio (1556), the back part facing the Contrada
Porti, being an early-Renaissance structure. Opposite to it rises
the imposing PALAZZO Pon'ro-Baananano (Pl. B, C, 2], by Palladio
(1570), and farther on, to the left, are the Gothic Pat. Porto, with
an attractive early-Renaissance portal of 1481, and two Palaszi
Colleom', of which one is Gothic with a ﬁne colonnade and staircase,
the other by Palladio.
