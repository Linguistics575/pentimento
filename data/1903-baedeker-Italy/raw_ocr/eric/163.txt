chess Raffaele Deferrari, Duke of Galliera (d. 1876). The M010
Nuovo was prolonged to the SE. by the Mole Duca di Gallium
(about 1 M. long), and on the E. side a new breakwater, the M010
Giana or Orientals (550 yds. long), was added, creating a new harbour
(Porto Nuovo) and an outer basin (Aoamporto) for war-vessels. A
new outer harbour, the Bacino del Faro beside the Mole Nuovo, is
expected to be ﬁnished about 1905 (comp. the Map, p. 84). The
aggregate water area of these different basins is 555 acres; the

length of the quays (calate) is 5 M. In 1900 the harbour was entered ‘
and cleared by 13,602 vessels, of which 7292 were steamers. The 3
value of the imports (3,075,789 tons; . chieﬂy coal and grain] .
was 520,000,000 fr. , that of the exports (232,300 tone) was

240,000,000 a.

To reach the harbour from the railway-station, we traverse the :

Piazza Acquaverde (Pl. 0, 2; p. 81) and descend the narrow VIA
SAN GrovANNI (Pl. B, C, 2) towards the S. To the right, at the corner
of the Piazza della Commenda, is the small early-Gothic church of

San Giovanni Battista or di Pre‘: (13th cent.), which originally 130— f
longed to a lodge of the Knights of St. John. Since a reconstruction ‘

in the 17th cent. the entrance has been at the E. end.

The busy VIA CARLO ALBERTO (Pl. 0, D, 2-4), skirting the 1

Piazza della Commenda, leads to the W. to the Dogana (Pl. B, 2),

or custom-house, and to the Ponte Federico Guglielmo (p. 67), the ‘

landing-place of the oceanic steamers. Farther on are the Palazzo

Doria (p. 81) and the large lighthouse (p. 82). To the E. the ‘

street leads past the Magazsini della Ddrsena, the former marine .

arsenal, the old Darsena (P1. 0, 3), or war—harbour, in which Fiasco l
was drowned in 1547, and the Porticato di Sottoripa (Pl. D, 4), ‘
with arcades restored in the Gothic style in 1900, to the PIAzZA ‘

CAMCAMBNTO (Pl. D, 4, 5), in which a bronze statue, by Rivalta,

was erected in 1893 to Raﬁ’aele Rubattino (1809-72), the Genoese ‘
steamship-owner. 0n the 8. side of the square is the Gothic Palazzo ‘
di San Giorgio, erected about 1260, enlarged in the 14th cent. and T
in 1571, and from 1408 to 1797 occupied by the Banca di San Giorgio ,

(p. 71). It is now being converted into a produce-exchange. The large
hall is embellished with 21 marble statues of men who have deserved
well of the city, partly of the 15-16th century. The best are those
of Luca Grimaldi and Ant. Doria (by Tamagnini; 1508) and Franc.
Lomellini (by Pace Gagini; 1509).

Beside the Piazza Raibetta (Pl. D, 5; electric tramways, p. 68),
farther on, is the Porto Franco, or free harbour, with extensive
bonded warehouses (visitors admitted; no smoking).

The broad VIA VITTOBIO EMANUELB (Pl. D, 5), skirting the E.
side of the free harbour, leads to the SW. to the Piazza Cavour
(Pl. D, 6), to the S. of which begins the Via di Ciroonvallazione a
Mare (p. 83). To the W. is the Mole Vecchio, with the Porta dcl
Mole (Pl. 0, 5), a gateway built in 1550 by Gal. Alessi, and the
