Ventimiglia (45 ft. ; Fr. Vintimille), the Roman Albintemelium,
the Italian frontier-town, with 11,468 inhab. and the seat of a bishop,
lies picturesquely on a hill beyond the Roja. In the Municipio is
a small collection of Roman antiquities from Nervia (see p. 95).
The Cathedral and the little church of San Michele are interesting;
the columns of the vaulted crypt of the latter bear Roman inscrip-

tions. Fine view of the Roja valley through the Porta Romano.

A road ascends from Ventimiglia in about 1 hr. to the ruined Uactella
d‘Appio (ﬁne views). Outside the Ports di Nizza we turn to the right and
take the branch to the left at the ﬁrst fork. — Another road (omn., see
above) leads through the Val Nereia to (13/4 hr.) Dolceaqaa, with the
mined ancestral castle of the Dorias of Genoa, and thence via Isolabona
to (2 hrs.) Pigna.

18. From Genoa to Pisa. Riviera di Levante.

102% M. RAILWAY in 33/4-73/4 hrs. (fares 19 fr. 15, 13 fr. 45, 8 fr. 60s.;
express 21 fr. 10, 14 fr. 80 c.). The trains start from the Stations Bane
Principe (local trains to Chiavari also from the Siazione Piano Brignole;
comp. the time-tables). Tickets to Nerei, Raputlo, etc. by the fast express
are issued only as extensions of tickets to Genoa, on application being!
made to the ‘Controllore‘ or to the station-master immediately on the
traveller‘s arrival in Genoa. Local passengers from Genoa with tickets
for stations short of Chiavari (San Pier d‘Arena in the Opposite direction)
are not allowed to travel by the express trains. — For the sake of the
view, seats should be taken on the left side of the carriage at the Simian
Piazza Principe, and on the right side at the Stazione Piazza Brignolc.
Between Nervi and Spezia the view is much interrupted by the numerous,

tunnels. It is dangerous to lean out of the carriage-window. —- Electric
Tramway to Nervi, see p. 68.

Genoa, p. 66. The train backs out of the Stations Piazza Prin-

 

cipe, and then starts in the opposite (E.)‘ direction, passing through
a long tunnel under the higher parts of the town (4- 5 min. . i

2 M. Stasione Piazza Brignole. To the left we obtain a view
of the fortress—crowned heights around Genoa (comp. p. 70). :

0n the Riviera di Levante, or coast to the E. of Genoa, thei
vegetation is less luxuriant than on the Riviera di Ponente (p. 85),
but the scenery is almost more striking. The line is carried through
numerous cuttings and more than eighty tunnels, some very long.
The villages present a town-like appearance , with their narrow
streets and lofty houses, closely built on the narrow sea-board or in
conﬁned valleys, and mostly painted externally as at Genoa.

The train crosses the insigniﬁcant Bisagno, and passes under
