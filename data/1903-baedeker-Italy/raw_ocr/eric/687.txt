Academy, where a statue of St. Matthew, begun by Michael Angelo.
as one of the Twelve Apostles he was to supply for the cathedral

At the corner of the Via Cavour (p. 489) and the Via degli Aru-
zieri, on the N.W. side of the Piazza San Marco, stands the Casino
di Livia (No. 59; Pl. G, 3), a small but tasteful structure by Bern.
Fallini (1775). —— Adjacent is the Casmo nr SAN Manse or Carina
Mcdicco (No. 63; Pl. G, 2, 3; now a jury court), erected in 1576 by
Buontalcnti, on the site of the famous Medici gardens, where Lo—
renzo il Magniﬂco preserved a number of treasures of art for which
no place could be found in the neighbouring palace of the Medici

pointed keeper, and round him clustered a troop of eager students.
No other school ever attained so great celebrity. Leonardo da
Vinci, Lorenzo di Credi, Giovanni Francesco Rustici, Andrea San—
sovino, Pietro Torrigiani, and, last but not least, Michael Angelo,
