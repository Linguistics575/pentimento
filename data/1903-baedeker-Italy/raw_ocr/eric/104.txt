This district ‘at the foot of the mountains‘, enclosed on three sides
by the Alps and Apennines, and separated from Lombardy by the Ticino,
embraces, according to the present division, the provinces of Turin, No-
tara, Ounce, and Alessandrz‘a, with 3,233,000 inhab., and an area of about
11.400 sq. M. It consists of lowlands ﬂanking the banks of the Po and its
tributaries, which yield rice, wheat, and maize, and of highlands Where ex-
cellent wine and silk are produced, and lastly of a bleaker mountain
region of forests and pastures. The earliest Innaarmnrs were Celtic and
Ptmian tribes, who were but slowly inﬂuenced by Roman culture; and
It was not till the reign of Augustus that the subjugation of the higher
Valleys was completed. The DIALECT of the people still retains traces of
heir ancient affinity with the French; thus, pie-ave, instead of the Italian
Plpverc, am for uomo, cheur for more, sitd for cittd, rason for regions,
Puma for piazza. This patois is universally spoken, even by the upper
Classes, but is unintelligible to strangers. Throughout Piedmont, however,
French is very generally understood.
