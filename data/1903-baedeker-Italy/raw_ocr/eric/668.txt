dc Montalvo by Bart. Ammanaii, has handsome windows and well
preserved grafﬂto decorations. No. 18 (left), the Palaazo Altovitt

In the Via Ghibellina (which leads from the Bargello), a little
to the S. of the Borgo degl Albizzi, is the building occupied by
the Teatro Verdi (PI. F, G, 6). In this building is an ancient fresco
(ascribed to Giottino), representing the ‘Expulsion of the Duke of
Athens (p. 441) from Florence on the festival of St. Anne, 1343’,
interesting also on account of the view it contains of the Palazzo
Vecchio (entrance by No. 83; the custodian shows the fresco).

the commercial family of that name (p. 441), whose inﬂuence cul-

curve of the Roman amphitheatre may still be traced in the position
of the buildings.

vorks after the Divina Commedia: the Convito, Vita Nuova, De
Vulgari Eloquio, De Monarchia. Round the pedestal below are the

velonging to any of the mendicant orders, was begun in 1294, from

true were the popular favourites among the monkish bodies. It
was completed in 1442, with the exception of the unattractive
