the Madonna; adjoining the windows are 88. Francis and Peter the llartyr,
the Annunciation, and John the Baptist, and below all these, Giovanni
Tornabuoni and Francesca Pitti (p. 475), his wife, at whose expense these
works were executed. — On the left wall, in seven sections, is represented
the life of lary: Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple, Nativity of
Mary (the architecture of the interior beautifully enriched), Visit to the
Temple, Her Nuptials, Adoration of the Ilagi, Massacre of the Innocents,
and Her Death and Assumption. —- The right wall is devoted to the life
of John the Baptist. The ﬁrst scene, Zacharias in the Temple, is celebrated
for the number of portraits which are introduced in a remarkably easy
and lifelike manner. The ﬁgures below to the left are said to be portraits
of Cristoforo Landini, Angelo Poliziano, and Marsilio Ficino, distinguished
scholars and humanists. The other scenes are the Visitation, Nativity of
John, the Naming of the child, the Baptist preaching repentance (in which
the master shows his art in grouping and individualising the ﬁgures),
Baptism of Christ, and Dancing of the Daughter of Herodias. Several of
these works are defaced almost beyond recognition. — The stained glass
(“92) was executed by Alessandro Morentino. —- The choir-stalls are by
Baccio d‘Aanolo, restored by Vasan'. At the back of the altar is a ‘Brass
to the memory of Lionardo Dati (d. 1424) by Lor. Ghiberti.

The (3an to the left of the choir, by Giuliano da Bangallo contains
the celebrated wooden 'Cruciﬁx of Brunellsscht‘ which gave rise to the rivalry
between him and his friend Donatello (p. 450). -- The following Guam
CHAPIL, by 0. A. Dario, is adorned with bee-reliefs by Gian. dall' Opera.

Lnr'r Tasnsnrr. The Sraozzl Cessna, to which steps ascend, contains
celebrated ‘Frescoes with numerous ﬁgures, of the School of Giotto.- opposite
the entrance, the Last Judgment (ﬁgure of Dante praying, among the elect,
to the left in the t0p row); (1.) Paradise, over the ﬁgures in which broods
a truly celestial repose, by Andrea Orcagma; Hell (r.) according to Dante,
by Andrea‘s brother Bernardo; altar-piece, Christ with 88. Thomas Aquinas
and Peter, completed in 1357, by Andrea. — The next door, in the corner,
leads to the Sscmsrr, the most interesting object in which is a fountain
by Gian. delta Robbie (1497) a magniﬁcent work of its kind. In the 1st case
on the left are some ﬁne panish vestments of the 14th century.

A door to the right of the steps to the Strozzi Chapel (opened by the
sacristan; 80-50 c.) admits to the so-called Scpolcreto, or burial vault, with
an open colonnade and frescoes of the 14th century. To the left we enter
the Ancient Cloisters, called I! Claiostro Verde, restored in 1895. The E.
wul is adorned with old and much injured frescoes in terra verde (different
shades of green). Those in the three ﬁrst lunettes, representing the Creation,
the Expulsion from Paradise, Cain and Abel, and the Building of the Ark,
are by followers of Giotto (?). The Deluge, in which the artist has depicted
with great power the helplessness of man in presence of the fury of the
elements, in the fourth lunette, and the Offering and Drunkenness of Noah,
are by Paolo Uccello (about 1446). -- To the right (N.) in the cloisters is
the ‘Oappella degli Spagnuoli (best light, 10-12), formerly the chapter-
house, and bearing its resent name because assi ned to the Spanish
residents of Florence in 1 . It was built about 18.605 and restored in 1895.
The frescoes (restored) of Giotto‘s School are attributed by Vasari to Taddeo
Gaddt’ and Simone Martini (‘2) but by more modern critics to Andrea da
Firms. Most of them are merely second-rate works though interesting
to the student of art. Their subjects follow the doctrines of Thomas
Aquinas, the great Dominican saint. On the wall of the altar is a large
and crowded painting of the Cruciﬁxion, and below it, to the left, Bearing
of the Cross, to the right, Christ in Hades; on the ceiling, the Resurrection,
Ascension, Descent of the Holy Ghost, Christ and Peter on the water.
On the E. side (r.) the Church Militant and Triumphant, suggested by
Thomas Aquinas‘s commentary on the Song of Solomon: beneath, to‘ the
left, in front of the cathedral of Florence (an ideal representation of the
then unﬁnished building), appear the pope with his flock and the members
of the church, and the emperor with the representatives of secular power;
to the right, the heretics are represented as wolves hunted by the Dominicans
in the form of black and white dogs (‘Domini canes‘), also their conversion;
