lost its prosperity for ever. Thenceforward until 1797 , and again in
1815-60, it belonged to the States of the Church. In Aug., 1849, Garibaldi
found refuge at Revenue from the pursuing Austrians, while his wife
Anita succumbed to the fatigues of the ﬂight.

In the History of Early Christian Art of the 5-8th century, Ravenna is
the most important place in Italy next to Rome. While most of the other
Italian cities fell into decay after the barbarian invasion, Revenue saw
new and imposing structures rising in her midst at that period. The
connection of Roman and Byzantine art may best be studied at Ravenna.
Here, as at Constantinople, also formerly the centre of a brilliant archi-
tectural period, the traveller will observe how the capitals of the columns
were gradually remodelled, and a new style of ornamentation introduced.
Besides the basilicas there are also dome-structures, which form a link
between Byzantium and some of the churches of N. Italy and the cathedral
at Aix-la-Chapelle. The ancient Bunnmes of Havana belong to three
different periods, the ﬁrst being that of Honorius and his sister Galla
Placidia, 402-450 (Cathedral, Saqt‘ Agata, San Giovanni Evangelism, San
Giovanni Battista, Mausoleum of Galla Ptacidia, ArchiepiscOpal Chapel,
Baptism-y of the Orthodox, and San Francesco); the second a Gothic period
from 493 to about 539 (St. Martians or Sant‘ Apoltinare Nuovo, Spirits
Santa, Baptistery of the Ariana or Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and the Pulses
and Mausoleum of Theodor-is); and the third a Byzantine period from 539
onwards (San Vitals and Sant‘ Apottinare in Ctasse, both begun in the pre-
ceding period). The basilicas of Revenue diii‘er from the Roman in having
their porticoes converted into a closed anterior structure, in possessing
columns expressly designed for their object (by Byzantine architects in
Istria) instead of being brought from other buildings, and in showing a
consistent use of the round arch with corresponding articulation on the
external walls (Palace of Theodoric; Sant‘ Apollinare in Classe). This last
feature ap ears also in Diocletian‘s buildings at Salona. Round campanili,
detached row the churches, begin to appear in the 8th century. Transepts
are wanting, as also was probably the case originally in most of the Roman
basilicas. Notwithstanding the alterations of subsequent ages, and the
raising of the pavements by several feet, which was rendered necessary by
the gradually increasing elevation of the surrounding soil, these noble
monuments of triumphant Christianity are profoundly impressive, and their
effect is greatly enhanced by the stillness and solitude of the environs. -
Mossrc PAINTING was also extensively practised at Ravenua. The earlier
symbolism (Baptistery of the Orthodox, Mausoleum of Galla Placidia) was
gradually abandoned for the historical Christian style (Sant‘ Apollinare
Nuovo, San Vitale), but at the same time the ﬁdelity to nature became
less and the designs became stiff and conventional. At this period, too,
the costly but stiﬂ' costumes, and the ceremonial air of the Byzantine court.
began to affect the designs, thus preparing the way for the later Byzantine
style. — The traveller will also have an Opportunity here of examining
Ssnoornxcr, Ivonr Canvmo (Throne of Archbp. Maximian, g. 387), Brucco
Renters (Baptistery of the Orthodox, p. 388), and other wor s of the early
Christian period, and thus obtain a very comprehensive review of the art
products of the centuries preceding the Carlovingian era.

Lord Byron, who preferred Revenue to all the other towns of Italy,
and was inﬂuenced in some measure by his intimacy with the Countess
Guiccioli, a member of the Gamba family of Revenue, spent two years
here (June, 1819, to October, 1821; see p. 389).

From the station (Pl. G, 3, 4), in front of which rises a statue to
the Italian patriot L. 0. Farim', Dictator of the Emilia in 1860, we
pass the Piazza Anita Garibaldi, with the church of San Giovanni
Evangelism (p. 392) and a monument (by Zocchi; 1888) to the
champions of Italian liberty, and crossing the Corso Giuseppe Gari-
baldi (to the right, Spirito Santo and the'Baptistery of the Ariana,
p. 392), proceed straight on through the Via. Farini to the Pram
