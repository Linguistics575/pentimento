HEIGHTS are given in English feet (LEngl. ft. = 0,3048
metre), and DISTANCES in English miles (comp. p. ii). The
POPULATIONS given are those of the communal districts
(comum') according to the census of 1901; the populations of
the separate towns and villages (papolam‘one agglomerata),
which are usually considerably lower than the ﬁgures in the
Handbook, have not yet been published.

HOTELS (comp. p. xix). Besides the modern palatial and
eXpensive establishments the Handbook also mentions a se-
lection of modest, old-fashioned inns, which not unfrequently
afford good accommodation at moderate charges. The asterisks
indicate these hotels which the Editor has reason to believe
from his own eXperience, as well as from information supplied
by numerous travellers, to be respectable, clean, reasonable,
and fairly well provided with the comforts and conveniences
expected in an up-to-date establishment. Houses .of 'a more
primitive character, when good of their class, are described as
‘fair’ or ‘very fair’. At the same time the Editor does not doubt
that comfortable quarters may occasionally be obtained at inns
which he has not recommended or even mentioned. The
average charges are stated in accordance with the Editor’s
own eXperience, or from the bills furnished to him by trav-
ellers. Although changes frequently take place, and prices
generally have an upward tendency, the approximate state—
ment of these items which is thus supplied will at least enable
the traveller to form an estimate of his probable expenditure.

To hotel-preprietors, tradesmen , and others the Editor
begs to intimate that a character for fair dealing and courtesy
towards travellers forms the sole passport to his commend—
ation, and that advertisements of every kind“ are strictly ex-
cluded from his Handbooks. Hotel—keepers are also warned
against persons representing themselves as agents for
Baedcker‘s Handbooks.
