The *Baptistery [Battistero ,' Pl. E, 3), on the 8. side of the
Piazza. del Duomo, built in the Lombard-Romanesque style in 1196-
1270, externally octagonal, with three round-arched portals, is
constructed of Veronese marble, and consists of ﬁve stories with
colonnades; the ﬂat roof is surmounted by seven pyramidal turrets
and by a belfry added in the 17th century. Around nearly the whole
exterior of the building runs a series of medallions, representing
various animals of symbolical import. The portals are adorned with §
the following Scriptural subjects: — ‘

At the N. Portal (towards the Piazza), above, is the Adoration of the
Magi; then the History of John the Baptist; on the doonposts are genea-
logical trees of Jacob and of Jesse. -— At the W. Portal, above, a curious ‘
representation of the Last Judgment. On the door-posts to the left, Christ ‘
performing works of mercy; on the right, the six ages of man. — On the
S. side is an Allegory of Death from the story of Barlaam and Josaphat. ‘
All these are probably by Benedetto Antelamt, whose name appears as the
master from the inscription on the N. partal.

The INTERIOR (closed; key in the house No. 2, opposite the S. entrance)
is sixteen-sided, with thirteen niches and three doorways below and two
galleries above, and graceful columns on the walls. The sculptures have 1
been only partly completed. Above the doors are sculptures of the 13th cent,
and on the E. side of the lower galleries is a series of *Reliefs of the 1
months (incomplete) and other works of the 13th century. The Roman— :
enque frescoes in the dome (13th cent.), representing the history of John ,
the Baptist and prophets, are of interest to students of art. — The whole 1
population of Parma since 1216 is said to have been baptised here. The ,
font dates from 1294. ‘

The church of *San Giovanni Evangelista (P1. E, 3), belong-
ing to an ancient Benedictine monastery, which is now a barraek, is

with aisles ‘and two series of chapels. It was erected in 1510 by
Bemardino Zaccagni; the handsome baroque facade is by Simone
Moschino (1604), and the tower by G. B. Magnani (1614).
