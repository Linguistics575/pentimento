Piacenza (200 ft.), with 35,647 inhab., the capital of a province,
and the see of a bishop, lies 1/3 M. from the S. bank of the Po,

which is crossed by a bridge-of-boats and- a railway-bridge. The .

town possesses several interesting churches (closed 12-3).

Piacenza was founded by the Romans, 3.0. 219, as Colonic: Haemtia,
in a position commanding one of the passages of the Po, which lent it
importance as a fertress against the Gauls. Cremona (p. 189) was founded
at the same time. In the middle ages Piacenza held a high rank in the
league of the Lombard towns, and was afterwards frequently the subject
of ﬁerce party-struggles between the Scotti, Torriani, and Visconti. In
1488 it was plundered b Francesco Sforza, a blow from which it never

entirely recovered. In 547 it ﬁnally came into the possession of the

Famese family and was united to Perms.
