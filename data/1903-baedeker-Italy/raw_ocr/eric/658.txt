I"'605, *599, Titian, Portraits of Francesco Maria della Rovers
and Eleonora Gonzaga, Duke and Duchess of Urbino (1537).

These noble ‘portraits were executed in 1687, when the Duke was
appointed Gener- issimo of the League against the Turks. The Duke
has a martial bearing, the look of the Duchess is stately but subdued.

dame accustomed to luxury and ease and the tanned face of a soldier
habitually exposed to the weather, Titian skilfun varied the details of
technical execution. Here he is minute and ﬁnis ed, there resolute and
broad. Here the tinted and throbbing ﬂesh is pitted against a warm light
ground, there the sallow olive against a dark wall. —- 0. «£- 0.

There is nothin in this ethereal Flora to shock the sensitive eye.
The prOportio‘ns an features are of surprising loveliness, reminding us
in their urity of some of the choicest antiques. The masterly and clear

light sc e is attained by the thin disposal of pigments, the broad plane
of tinting, and the delicate shade of all but imperceptible half-Eng. -—
