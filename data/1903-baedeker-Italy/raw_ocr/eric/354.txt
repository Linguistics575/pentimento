(inmate. Gardone is excellently sheltered from the prevalent winter
winds (N. and NW.) by the chain of hills rising from the Hts. San Bartolo-
meo to the Hts. Pizrocolo (see below) and interrupted only by the Barbarano
Ravine. A like service is rendered by the lifts. Baldo against the E. and
NE. winds. The S. and S.E. winds have free access, but the Ora (p. 211)
is not felt here and 83 per cent of the days of the year are free from wind.
The greatest rainfall takes place in Oct. (6.2 in.), Nov. (4.3 in.), and April
(3.8 in.), while the three winter months have usually little rain, abundance
of sunshine (129 hrs. in Dec., 141 in Jan., 165 in Feb.), a relatively high
temperature (mean 395° Fahr.), and a low range of temperature (mean
dilly range in'Dec. 9° Fahr., in Jan. 9.5’, in Feb. 1L7"). Snow seldom
Hts long on the ground. The relative humidity (78 per cent) varies little
and is about the same as that of Montreux.

Gordon-Riviera, consisting of eight villages (Gardens di Sotto,

Gardens di 80pm, Fasano, etc.), has become since 1885 a favourite
Winter-resort for consumptive and nervous invalids, while in the
spring and autumn it is frequented by those in search of rest and
refreshment. The visitors are chieﬂy Germans. The hills aﬂ’ord a
multitude of varied walks, all free from dust and well provided
with benches. The vegetation is of a thoroughly southern character
(comp, p. 211); camellias, magnolias, and palms grow in the gardens

unprotected.
