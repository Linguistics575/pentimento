Peruzzi (ca. 1514). In the interior, to the left, a Christ by Begarelli
(p. 348), two statues by Prospero Clementi, and a pulpit of the
11th century. The Loggia Opposite the cathedral, the Colonnades,
and the fortiﬁcations also testify to the taste and energy of this
prince, who was expelled by Charles V. in 1525. A street leads
from the Loggia to the Franciscan church of San Niccolo, founded in
