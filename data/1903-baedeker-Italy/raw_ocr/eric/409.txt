256 Route 41. CITTADELLA.

relates the history of the Virgin from the rejection of Joachim‘s sacriﬁce
to Mary‘s bridal rocession. The Birth of the Virgin and the Presentation
of the Virgin in t e Temple show scrupulous ﬁdelity to nature. — The Sac-
orm Row begins with the Annunciation (choir-arch), and depicts the youth
of Christ and his ministry up to the driving of the money-changers out
of the Temple. The ﬁnest scenes are the Adoration of the Magi, the Flight
t.) Egypt, and the Entry into Jerusalem. — The grandest ﬂight of Giotto‘s
imagination is seen in some of the paintings in the THIRD Row, mainly
devoted to the Passion. The representation of Christ‘s sorrows as begin-
ning with the Corruption of Judas (to the left of the choir-wall) is a ﬁne
dramatic touch. In the Cruciﬁxion Giotto has not only surpassed his
predecessors in the nobility of his conception of the Suﬂ‘erer, but has
added a most eﬁ‘ective and pathetic feature in the small winged angels,
who show every degree of sympathy and sorrow. The gem of the series,
however, is the Pietd, or Christ wept over by the Virgin and his friends,
its tone of composition being in admirable keeping with its tragic content.
-— The Lowns'r Bow consists of allegorical ﬁgures of the Virtues and Vices
in grisaille, and leads up to the Last Judgment. The Christ enthroned with
angels, above the choir-arch, shows that Giotto was as much at homeoin
the domain of placid gracefulness as in that of emotion and passion.
-— The anscons IN run Cnorn (Death, Assumption, and Coronation of
the Virgin) are by a later hand, and of little importance. By the rear
wall is the monument of the founder of the church (d. 1336). On the altar,

in front of this, is a ﬁgure of the MadOnna by Giovanni Pisano, to whom .

the statue of Scrovegno, in the sacristy, to the left, may also be ascribed.

From the Madonna dell’ Arena we may proceed either to the ;
N.W. direct to the Barriers Mazzini (p. 249), or to the S.W. through :

the Via Cittadella to the Piazza Garibaldi (p. 249).
