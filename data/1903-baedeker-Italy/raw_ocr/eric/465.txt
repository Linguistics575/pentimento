308 Route 42. VENICE. f. Western Quarters:

Not far from the market, at the entrance to the Ruga di 8.

Giovanni Elemosinario (P1. F, 4), built by Scarpagnino in 1527.
Entrance by the gateway adjoining the campanile (best light about

noon).
*High-altar-piece by Titian, San Giovanni Elemosinario (about 1530;
mutilated by the absence of the semicircular upper section): — ‘St. John

the almsgiver, bishOp and patriarch of Alexandria, is not a saint of note.
His t pe is not one that painters know and respect as traditionally re-
serve in the annals of the pictorial craft. A bishOp giving alms m ght
be the subject of a tame composition. None but a man of genius could
give interest and force to such a theme; but Titian was a genius and it
is surprising with what power he conceives and carries out his idea. . . .
The forms are natural, but of good scantling, moving boldly, vet appro-
priately foreshortened with daring yet without strain, the nu e correct, .
the mo elling masterly. . . . His colouring is gorgeous, his command of
line surprising, his touch unsurpassable‘ (G. et- 0.). — Chapel to the right,
Altar-piece, SS. Sebastian, Rochus, and Catharine, a masterpiece by Porde-
none. — To the left, in the nave, Marco Vecem, Doge Grimani giving aims.

Passing the entrance of the Rugs. S. Giovanni, and continuing
our way from the Rialto Bridge direct to the N. W., we cross a

Vecchio (damaged); 3rd altar en the same side, Visitation, by Le-
andra Bassano; choir, Jae. Tintoretto, Cruciﬁxion.

Continuing our course towards the N.W., and turning into a
side-street on the right, after crossing four canals, we reach the
entrance of the —

"Museo Civico, which combines the old Correr Collection and
part of the Morosini Collection (p. 315) with the municipal collec-
