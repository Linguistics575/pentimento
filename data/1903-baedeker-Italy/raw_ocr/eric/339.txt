The Broletto (Pl. 0, 2, 3), a massive building, adjoining the
cathedral on the N., dates from 1187 and 1222 but was not entirely
completed until the 15—17th centuries. Anciently (until 1421) the
town-hall, it now contains the courts of justice and the prefecture.
The campanile on the S. side, the Torre del Popolo, belongs to the
original ediﬁce, which is now being restored in the initial style.

The Gothic brick facade of the former church of Sant’ Agostino
is incorporated with the W. side of the Broletto, past which the
Vicolo Sant’ Agostino ascends to the Piazza Tito Speri (Pl. 0, 2), at
the entrance to the Castello. This piazza, now embellished with

a monument to Tito Speri (p. 200; b. 1827, executed at Mantua in ‘

1853), was one of the most obstinately contested points in 1849.

. The Contrada Broletto and the Via Santa Giulia run hence to .
the E. to the Piazza del Museo (Pl. D, 2, 3), occupying the site of ‘

the Roman Forum, of which the Porticus on the E. side is a relic.
At the N. end of the piazza is the entrance to the —

a projecting colonnade of ten columns and four pillars to which the 1

steps ascend, and has three ceuae of moderate depth.

The pavement of the PRINCIPAL HALL has been restored from the '
original remains. By the back-wall, as in the other chambers, are placed _'

the bases of the temple images. Among the Roman inscriptions and;
sculptures is an archaic head; also two tombs of the ﬂint period. — The ‘f

diadem round her head, a (restored) shield, on which she is about to ,
