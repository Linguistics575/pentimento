The Emilia includes the former duchies of Puma and Hodeua, as well
as the papal Romagna, and is now divided into the eight provinces of
P'iacenza, Puma, Reggie, Hodena, Bologna, Ferrara, Rosanna, and Forli,
covering an area of 7920 sq. M., with a population of 2,198,500 souls. The
dialects s ken here form the third main group of the Gallic languages
of Upper taly, and the nasal sound of the vowels will at Once strike the
traveller as indicating the original afﬁnity of the people with the French.
The Celts seem to have crossed the Alps in several different detachments.
After the Insubn' had conquered the district of Milan, and the Cenomant
Brescia and Verona, the tribe of the Bat? crossed the Po about 400 3.0.,
and subjugated the Etruscans and Umbrians who were settled to the S.
of that river. They chose Bologna for their capital, in the name of which
is still preserved that of the con uerors. The Seams next invaded Italy,
and took possession of the coast- istrict to the 8. of the Bell, extending
nearly to Ancona. It was a horde of these Gauls that destroyed Rome in
28.0. 389. About a century later Italy, united under the guidance of Rome,
began to reconquer the lost territory. In 283 the Senones were exter-
minated. In 269 a colony was established at Art‘mc'num, which was con-
stituted the strongest frontier-fortress in the peninsula, and connected
with Rome by the Via Flamim’a. In 224 the Boii were subjugated, and
in planting the colonies of Placentt'a and Cremoua in 219, Rome extended
her frontier as far as the Po. This process of Latinisation was interrupted
by the invasion of Hannibal, but vigorously resumed after his defeat; and
in 189 Bologna, and in 183 Modem: and Parma received Roman colonies.
