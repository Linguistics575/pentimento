Cathedral. FERRARA. 50. Route. 357

is the elegant Gothic church of San Giuliano (Pl. 2; D, 4). — In
the Piazza Savonarola, on the S. of the castle, rises a monument by
Galetti to Girolamo Savonarola (Pl. 3), who was born at Ferrara
on 21st Sept., 1452 (‘in tempi corrotti e servili dei vizi e dei tiranni
ﬁagellatore’; p. 441). —— Farther on, to the right in the Piazza del
Gommercio (Pl. 4), is the Palaazo del Municipio Pl. D, 4, b), the
oldest residence of the Este family, rebuilt in the 1 th century. One
of its rooms is said to have been decorated by Dosao Dossi. '

In the centre of the neighbouring PIAZZA DELLA CATTBDRAL‘B (Pl.
D, 5) is a statue of Victor Emmanuel I I., by Giul. Monteverde (1889).

The I'0a1:hedra.l (San Giorgio,- Pl. D, 5) has an imposing facade
with three series of round arches, one above the other, an ad-
mirable example of the Lombard style. The lower part of the
front and the lateral facades date from 1135; the upper part is of
the 13th cent., the sculptures mainly of the 13th and 14th. The
projecting portal, embellished with two lions, was added at a later
period; the reliefs are of an earlier date, some of them being pro-
bably by Nicolaua, who also worked in Verona (p. 226).

The ﬁne Ixmnron, with its aisles and double transept, does not corre-
spond with the fagade, as it was modernized in the baroque style by
Hazzarelu in 1712. In the 2nd Tnansnr’r on the right: Martyrdom of St.
Lawrence by Guanine (ruined); on the altar at the back, Cruciﬁx, with
the Virgin, St. John, St. George, and St. Maurelius, ﬁve ﬁgures in bronze
by Niccolo Baroncellt‘ and Dom. dt' Parts (1453-86); terracotta ﬁgures 01'
Christ and the Apostles in both transepts by Alfonso Lombardi (repainted).
— In the Cnorn to the rig t, Annunciation; to the left, St. George, by
Cosimo Tara. — 8th altar to t e left, Coronation of the Virgin, saints below,
by Fr. Franct‘a (late work). —- 3rd altar on the left, Madonna enthroned
with saints, by Garofalo (1524). On the right and left of the principal
door, 88. Peter and Paul, in fresco, by the same master (retouched). —
In the rooms adjoining the sacristy, Garofato, Annunciation; Dom. Putnam,
Madonna, with two donors; Giacomo do Stem, Statue of the Madonna (1408).

At the S. corner of the cathedral rises a lofty and handsome
Campanile in four massive stories, erected in the Renaissance style
in 1451-93 (top story at the end of the 16th cent.). — Opposite
to it is the Pal. delta. Regions, a Gothic brick building, erected in
1315-26, restored in 1840, and still containing the courts of justice.
— Adjoining is the former church of San Romano, which is now
almost entirely concealed from view by other buildings, only the
graceful brick ornamentation of the frieze and window—arches being
visible.

The Seminario Arcivescovile (P1. 1; D, 4), formerly the Palazzo
Trotti, Via Cairoli 32, contains frescoes by Garofalo in two rooms on

the groundﬂoor (best light about midday; fee 1/2 fr.; closed on Sun.).

The paintings (1520) in the 1st Room (vestibule) are much injured.
Those in the 2nd Room (1519), though too sombre for ceiling-paintings,
are artistically of great beauty and well-preserved. Tasteful ornamen-
tation. David and Goliath, the Judgment of Solomon, Prometheus, etc...
are represented. In the centre is an illusive painting of persons looking
down over a parapet, among them a portrait of the artist.

SAN PABLO (P1. D, 5), built in the late-Renaissance style about

1573 by Alberto Schiatti, contains pictures by Carlo Banana“ and
