The *Giardini Pubblici (Pl. F, G, 2, 3), between the Corso Venezia

Italy, with their tasteful ﬂower-beds, their ponds, and their pictur-
esque groups of venerable trees. In the older part of the park
(1785), near the new Museo Civico, are bronze statues of Am.
Stoppani, the geologist (1824-41; by Fr. Confalonieri), and Gen.
Gius. 8irtori'(by E. Butti). On a small island in the middle is a
marble statue of the Milanese poet Carlo Porta, by Puttinati. The
W. portion of the park, laid out in 1856, is embellished with a
bronze statue of Ant. Rosmini (p. -181), by Franc. Confalonierl
(1895). — The high-lying N. portion of the gardens, known as the
Montcmcrlo , has a Cafe-Restaurant and a bronze statue of the

taining a few works of art. — In the Via Manin stands the Palaszo

To the N.W. of the city, outside the Porta Volta (Pl. 0, D, 1)
and at the terminus of the electric tramway No. 4, mentioned at
p. 113, lies the =l“Gimitﬁro Monumentale (closed 12-2), designed
by C. Maciachini, 50 acres in area, enclosed by colonnades, and one
of the ﬁnest ‘campi santi’ in Italy. (The guide, who speaks French,
demands a fee of 11/2 fr. for each person.) Fine view of the Alps.
The numerous and handsome monuments form a veritable museum
of modern Milanese sculpture. In the last section is situated the
‘Tcmpio di Cremazione’, presented to the town in 1876 (inspection
