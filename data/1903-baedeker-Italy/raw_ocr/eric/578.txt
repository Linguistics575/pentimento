was by far the most important of the Tuscan cities, and while the citi-
zens were commemorating their victories by the erection of imposing
buildings, Florence had hardly begun to exist. Florence was ﬁrst indebted
for its progress to the fact that it lay on the great route from the north
to Rome, and commanded the passage of the Arno. Under Otho the
Great many German knights settled here, and at a later period several
noble families traced their origin from German ancestors. The enter-
prising citizens soon conquered the central and upper part of the valley
of the Arno, which the situation of their town enabled them to do, and
their arms were afterwards attended with farther successes. ‘While the
rest of Italy was gradually suffering dismemberment and throwing off the
trammels of its earlier traditions, Florence was still quietly developing her
resources, and» was thus soon enabled to take possession of the inheritance
of the earlier culture achieved by other towns. After her extensive
commerce had in a great measure raised her above the narrow aims of
her ancient life, she began to suffer. like the rest of Italy, from the
dissensions of a number of wild factions, but the more earnest character
of the citizens enabled them more effectually to grapple with these difﬁ-
culties. Florence may be said to resemble a man of unusual strength,
whose physical development has been but tardy; and thus it was that
she became the mistress of Tuscany'. (Leo). In 1350, among her other
siggiisitions, Florence gained possession of Prato, in 1351 of Pistoja, in
1 of Pisa, in 1410 of Cortona, and in 1424 of the harbour of Leghorn.
When at length the free constitutions of the greater part of Italy were
superseded by principalities, Florence did not escape the general fate,
but the change took place in the most favourable manner possible.
Among all the Italian dynasties by far the ﬁrst in rank was that of the
lsdici, not only owing to their muniﬂcent patronage of art and science,
mt to their prudent administration, their endeavours to improve the
ower classes, and their care for agriculture, commerce, and the material
.nterests of their subjects. At a later period their example was followed
W the princes of Lorraine and down to the present time Tuscany has
:njoycd the enviable lot of being the most enlightened and civilised, and
he best-governed ' state in Italy. The fact that Tuscany unreservedly
)articipated in the national aspirations .for unity and freedom, and
rolnntarily recognised the hegemony of a comparatively distant and
Insympathetic section of the Italian race, aﬂ‘ords the strongest possible
:vidence of the earnestness of that remarkable revolution which led to
he unit of Italy.

In , with the aid of the arms of Emperor Charles V., the dynasty
f the Medici was ﬂrml established in the sovereignty of Florence. The
rise Duke Cosimo I. (1 -74) extended his dominions considerably, par-
ioularly by the a nisition of Siena in 1557, which was ceded to him by
he emperor. In 15 9 he obtained from Papa Pius V., instead of the coveted
itle of King, that of Grand Duke (grandma). of Florence. He abdicated
u favour of his son E'ancesco (1574-87). Francesco was succeeded by his
rother Ferdinand I. (1587-1609), who had previously been a cardinal.
'0an II. (1609-21) the son of the latter, Ferdinand 11. (1621-70), and
basic III. (1670-1753) were the next princes. With Giovanni Gaston, who
ted in 1787, the house of Medici became extinct. In the wars between
.ustria and Spain, the two great powers to which Italy was subject, Tus-
any formed one of the principal objects of contention, but eventually fell
)the share of the former. The emperor annexed the country as a vacant
ef, and conferred it on the husband of his daughter Maria Theresia, the
nice Francis Stephen of Lorraine (1737-65) who by the Peace of Vienna
.735) renounced his native principality of Lorraine in return. In 1745 he
scended the throne of Austria as Francis 1., and in 1763 established
uscany as an appanage of the second sons of the emperors, in order
’ Prevent its being governed in future as one of the immediate domin-
ms of Austria. He was succeeded in 1765 by the Grand Duke Leopold,
'bo reigned on the same enlightened principles as his brother Joseph 11.,
ad was an active reformer in the administrative, judicial, educational,
1d ecclesiastical departments. In consequence of the death of Josephll.
