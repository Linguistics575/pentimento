230 Route 37. vERONA. a. Right Bank oftheAdtge.

We now return from the Piazza Vitt. Emanuele (p. 227) to the
N.E. ' to the Piazza delle Erbe by the narrow VIA NuovA LAs'rmcarA
and its prolongation, the VIA NuovA (Pl. E, 3), tOgether forming
the chief thoroughfare of the city (corso in the evening).

In the Via della Seals, one of the 8. side-streets of the Via Nuova,
is the church of Santa Marta delta Scala (Pl. E, 8), with an early-Renais-
sance portal and frescoes of the school of Vittore Pisano (in the bell
chamber, to the right of the high-altar). —- This street is prolonged by
the Via San Cosimo, at No. 8 in which (Marciano mm) is a good
replica of Seb. del Piombo‘s so-called ‘Dorothea‘ at Berlin.

In the VIA CAPPELLO, through which the tramway runs S. from
the Piazza delle Erbe (Pl. E, 3), an old house (Nos. 19-25) on the
left bears a marble tablet which is said to indicate the house of
Juliet’s parents (Capuletti; p. 228). The street then takes the
name of VIA San SnnAs'rIANo (Pl. E, 3, 4), in which, adjoining
the church of San Sebastiano (Pl. 1", 4), is the Biblioteca Commute
' (open in winter 9-3 and 6-9, in summer 9-4), founded in 1860,
and containing numerous records.

In the VIA Lnom (Pl. F, 4), the prolongation of the same street,
on the left, immediately beyond No. 1, is the Area de’ Leoni, part
of a Roman double gateway, coeval with the Ports de’ Borsari
(p_. 227), but of superior execution, bearing aninscription partially
preserved. Behind it are remains of a still older arch.

Near this is the Gothic church of San Fermo Haggiore (Pl. E,
F, 4), built at the beginning of the 14th cent. for the Benedictines
and afterwards transferred to the Franciscans. The interesting facade
is enriched with brick and marble. 0n the left side of the facade
is the sarcOphagus of Fracastoro, physician of Can Grande 1., with
ancient Veronese frescoes (14th cent.)

The INTERIOR, entered by the left side—door (visitors knock), has no
aisles. Part of it is modernised. Fine old roof in larch-wood. Above
the main entrance is a fresco of the early Veronese school, the Cruciﬁxion,
in polychrome frame. To the left is the monument of the Brenaoni, with
sculptures by the Florentine Basso (p. 225:, 1420); above are much damaged
frescoes by Fitters Hanna, the Annunciation. -— 1st altar on the left, three
saints by Torbido. — Over the side-entrance, fresco of the Cruciﬁxion; in
the chapel to the left, Altar-piece by Caroto (1525) Madonna, St. Anna,
and the Child in clouds, with four saints below. - in an adjoining space,

Liberals. -- 3rd altar on the right in the nave, Trinity, Madonna in clouds,
Tobias and the angel, and a saint, by Franc. Torbt'do.

b. Left Bank of the Adige (Veronetta).

The Via Leoni ends at the iron Ponte delle Ravi (Pl. F, 4),
which was erected in 1893 on the site of two stone bridges destroyed
by inundations of the Adige in 1757 and 1882. It aﬁords a good
survey of the choir and transept of San Fermo, and also up the rive]
