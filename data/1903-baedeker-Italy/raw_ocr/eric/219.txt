108 Route 18. VIAREGGIO.

(here known as the Porto Canals), the discharge of the lake of
Massaciuccoli (see below), and passing the Dar-send Vecchia and
Darsena Nuova, two small harbours. From the end of the N. Mote
(210 yds. long), at the mouth of the canal, we enjoy a splendid
view of the Alpi Apuane and of the coast from Leghorn to the
Gulf of Spezia.

The Via Manin, skirting the beach, and the Piazza d’Azeglio,
with its gardens, are the favourite resorts of visitors. The Piazza
Paolina, to the N.E., is embellished with a Monument to Shelley
(p. 415), by Urbano Lucchesi.

On the side of the pedestal, encircled by intertwined branches of oak
and olive, is a book bearing on its cover the word ‘Prometeo‘. Above
this is the following inscription: — ‘1894 to P. B. Shelley, heart of hearts,
in 1822 drowned in this sea, consumed by ﬁre on this shore, where he
meditated the addition to ‘Prometheus Unbound‘ of a posthumous page in

which every generation would have a token of its struggles, its tears,
and its redemption‘.

The celebrated Pinata, or pine-forest, of Viareggio, extends for
6 M. along the coast. The N. portion, which belongs to the town
and is Open to visitors, is reached via the Viale Gino Capponi or
from the N. end of the Via Manin. In the somewhat neglected S.
portion, which begins at the canal, is the Villa dei Borbom‘, belong-
ing to the sons of the ﬁrst wife ((1. 1893) of Don Carlos, Duke of
Madrid. The villa is entered (permesso essential) from the Via
della Fornace, near the old harbour.

From Viareggio a narrow-gauge railway runs to the N.E. in 3/4 hr:

at the E. end of the lake, are the so-called Bagm‘ ch' Nerone, a Roman
ruin. The lake may be reached by boat on the canal.
