276 Route42. VENICE. a. Piazza ofSt.Mark:

'The Library of St. Mark remains the crowning triumph 01’ Venetian
art. It is impossible to contemplate its noble double row of open arches
without echoing the judgment of Palladio, that nothing more sumptuous
or beautiful had been invented since the age of ancient Rome' Gr. A. Symds).

0n the Lagune, between the Library and the Royal Garden,‘ 1s
the old Zecca. (P1. H, 6; hence 'zeeohino' or ‘sequin’) or Mint, also
built by Sansovino in 1536. The interior has just been altered to
accommodate the library of St. Mark (p. 281). Beautiful court.

The **Ptuaoe of the Bose: (Palasso Ducale; Pl. B, 5), the W.
side of which (82 yds.) faces the Piazzetta, and the S. side (78 yds.)
the M010 and the Lagune, is said to have been founded beside the
church of St. Theodore about 814 for the ilrgt Doge of Venice. It
was rebuilt after 1stmflagrationg in 976 and 1105, and has been
repeatedly altered and restored. The Gothic exterior, lined with
small slabs of coloured marble, and with two pointed arcades of 107
columns (36 below, 71 above), one above the other, was thoroughly
restored in 1873-89. The S. part dates from the 14th cent. (1309

_ et seq.; large window, 1404), while the W facade is said to have (,

been built in 1424- 38 by Giovanni Buon and his sons Pantaleom
and Bartolomeo Buon the Elder. The magnificent tracery of the
windows In the upper story has almost entirely disappeared in the
course of one of the restorations.

The upper arcade, called ‘La Loggia', is remarkably rich. From
between the two columns of red marble (9th and 10th from the
principal portal) the Republic caused its sentences of death to he
proclaimed. The capitals of the short columns below (which have
no bases) are richly decorated with foliage, figures of men, and
animals. On the eorner-pillsr next the portal are interesting figures
of Numa Pompilius, Scipio, Emperor Trajan judging the cause of
a widow, J ustice, etc., all with inscriptions. The group above these
is the *Judgment of Solomon by two unknown Florentines. At the
corner towards the Lagune, Adam and Eve. Mr. Ruskin, who gives
an elaborate description of these sculptures in his '8tones of Venice’,
affirms that the capital under this group, 'in the workmanship and
grouping of its foliage', is, on the whole, the finest he knows in
Europe. At the S.E. angle, the sin of Noah. All these are Gothic.
In the centre of the Piazzetta facade is an alto-relief of the Lion
of St. Mark with a kneeling figure of Doge Andrea Gritti (1523- -38),
which was destroyed by the Radicals in 1797 and restored by Cr-
bano Bottasso in 1897. Adjacent is a Venetia enthroned.

The transition from 1ate-.fhrthie to Renaissance forms is illus-
trated by the fine portal adjoining St. Mark's, built in 1438-43
by Giov. and Bart. Buon the Elder. It is called *Porta delta Carta
from the placards which announced the decreesof the Republic
here. The figure of Temperance, below to the left, the charming
Putti, climbing among the Gothic foliage of the tympanum, and the
flgure of Justice, above, are especially attractive. The relief of the
