266 Route J2. VENICE. History.

The Oernivel, which formerly presented 3 - and lighter scene at
Venice than in any other city of Italy, has of late entirely lost its signi-
ileanots. - The city authorities sometimes give Serenades, Le. concerts with
illumination 0n the Canal Grende. - The Regatta' held periodically on
the Grand Canal are characteristic end interesting. The course is from
the Public Gardens to the Railway Station and back to the Pat Foseeri.
- The I'ata dbl Redentore (second Bun. in July) is also interesting.

History. For the early history of Venice, see p. 220. The foundation
of the Eastern supremacy of Venice was laid by Dogs Enrico Doudola
tit92-1206), who conquered Constantinople in 1204. In coneequenee of this

Venice gained possession of numerous places on the coasts of the Adriatic i

and the Levant, from Dnrazzo to Trebisond, end of most of the Greek
islands, including Candie, which was administered on the model of the
mother-city. During the conquest and administration of these new terri-
tories there arose a class of nobles, who declared themselves hereditary
in 1297 and excluded the rest of the people from ell share in the govern-
ment. The supreme authority lay with the Great Council (Haggior Gon-
st'g'h'o), which consisted of all members of the Nobtlt above twenty. The
executive wee vested in B Dogs, or Duke, and six eonnselldrs, with
whom was associated the Council of the Ptegadi. The Pregedi were after-
wards united with the higher offuialt, to form the Senate. The duty of
the Aeeogadori dt Comune wee to see that the public otBeuit, governed

constitutionally. After the conspiracy of Bajamonte mpoto (1310) the ',

chief power was vested in the Council of Ten (Consiglt‘o def Died), elected
yearly by the Maggie! Coneiglio; and this tribunal, from which the State
Inquisition was developed in the 16th cent, controlled, in conjunction
with the doge and his councillors every department of government.
With her rival Genoa. the 'hiGifio' came repeatedly into violent
eonflict, losing many of her conquests in the East; but the Genoese were

at length totally defeated by Dogs Andrea Dandolo in 1852. His eneceemr l

Marina Falten' plotted for the overthrow of the tt',tgr%t" hie scheme l

was discovered, and he was beheaded on 17th April, During the
regime of Andrea Contarin4 (1367-82) Pedue, Verona Genoa, Hungary, end
Naples formed an alliance; against Venice. In 1875 the Genoeee captured

Chioggi;A but they were surrounded in the f,S1ht and compelled to sur- [

render, th June,1380. Peace was concluded in 381. In 1386 Antonio Vem'er
(1382-1400) occupied the island of Corfu, and afterwards D‘urezeo, Argos,
etc. Under Michele Sumo (1400-1414) the Venetian general Halamta con-
?nered Vicenze, Belluno, Feltre2 Rovigo, Verona, and Pedue tuair, in
UB the Republic gained possession of Lepanto and Puma, and in 1409 of
Gunstalle and thssa1maggiore. In 1421 Tommaeo Hocem’go waged war suc-
cessfully against Hungary. In 1416 the Venetian fleet under Landau defeated
the Turkish at Gallipoli, and in 1421 It subdued all the towns of the Del-
metien coast, so that Venice now held the entire coast from the eetury
of the Po to the island of Corfu. Mocenigo‘s successor wee Francesco Fos-
cart' (1423-57). In 1426 Brescie fell into the hands of the Venetian general
Carmagnola (p. 47). In 1449 the Venetiens took Creme, but were unable
to prevent the elevation of Storm; to the dukedom of Milan (1450). A sed
ending awaited the long and glorious career of Fosceri. Suspected by the
Council of Ten, and weakened by contentions with the Loredani end other
private feuds, he was de used in 1457 and died a few days afterwards. -
Under Mstoforo Hero f 462-71) the Turks conquered the Mares, where e
few fortresses only were retained by Venice. In 1483 the Republic acquired
Zente, and in 1489 Cyprus also, which was ceded by Catherine Cornero,
a Venetian lady, widow of King James of Cyprus.

The 15th cent. witnessed the zenith of the glory of Venice. It rivelled
Bruges as the focus of the commerce of Europe, numbered 21D,(XX) inheb.,
and was universally respected and admired. The events of 1492 made many
Jews from Granada and other Hoorish towns seek refn e in Venice. Its
annual exports were valued at 10 million dueets t millions being clear
profit, It possessed 300 tusa-going vessels with 'iiiljdi sailors, 8000 smaller
