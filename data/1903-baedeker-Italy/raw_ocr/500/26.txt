sidiou, i.e. concealed weapons (sword-sticks; even knives with
spring-trude, eta), are absolutely prohibited.

Begging (aecattonaggio), always one of those national nuisances
to which the traveller in Italy must accustom himself, has recently
somewhat increased, especiaily In Tuscany, owing partly to gro wing
poverty, but largely also to the mieplaoed generosity of travellers.
As the profits of trtrtstst-1stsggars too frequently go for the support of
able-bodied loafers, travellers should either give nothing, or restrict
their charity to the obviously infirm. Gratuities to children are
entirely reprehensible. - Importunate beggars should be dismissed
with 'niente' or by a gesture of negation.

VI. Gratuities. Guidel.

Gntlities. - The traveller should always be ebundan tl y
supplied with copper and nickel coin In a country where trtMng
donations are in constant demand. 'Drivers, guides, and other per-
sons of the same class invariably eXpeet, and often demand-as their
right, a gratuity (buona mane, maneia, da here, trottiglia, eafe,
sigiiro) in addition to the. hire agreed on, varying according to circum-
stances from 2-3 sons to a franc or more. The traveller need have
no oomph: in limiting his donations to the smallest possible sums.
The following hints will be found useful by the average tourist. In
private collections 1-2 visitors should bestow a gratuity of 1/24 fr.,
b4 pers. 1-11/2 fr. For repeated visits 25 c. in enough for a single
visitor. For opening a ehuroh-door, etc., 10,.20 o. is enough, but if
extra. services are rendered (air. uncovering an altar-pieee, lighting
undles, etc.) from 1/4 to 1 fr. may be given. The Oustodi of all
public collections where an admitmion-fee is charged are forbidden
to accept gratuities. - In hotels and reetaurants‘about 5-10 per
cent of the reckoning should be given in gratuities, or less if service
is charged tor,

. Valet: de Place ( Guide, sing. la Guida) may be hired at 6-10 fr.
per day. The most trustworthy are those attached to the chief
hotels. In some towns the better guides have formed societies as
‘Gnide patentate' or ‘Guide tu1torizzate'. Their services may generally
well be dispensed with by those who are not pressed for time. Pur-
chases should never be made, nor contracts with vetturini or other
persons drawn up, in presence or with the aid of a commissionnaire,
" any such intervention tends considerably to increase the prices.
