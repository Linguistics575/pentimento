a transept, and is in many respects a truly classical edifice. The
elegantly-incrusted facade dates from the 11th, the mosaics (re-
peatedly restored) with which it is adorned from the beginning of
the 13th century. The tower was rebuilt by Baccio d'Agnolo in 1519.

The INTERIOR contains 12 columns and 8 triple piers of greyish green
marble, and its open roof (1357) is tastefully re-deeorated in the original
style. The choir with its simple apse is raised by a spacious crypt beneath.
The beautiful niello pavement (executed in 1207) also deserves inspection.
