Apicture by Boccaccio Boeeaeeino (Room XVII, No. 600), a little-
known master of the earlier school, is one of the best of that period.
Palma Vecchio is represented here by one of his best works, a
recently acquired Holy Family (R. VII). Rocco jlfareoni'a Descent
from the Gross (R. Y, No. 166) is one of his fintytst efforts. Titian',
masterpiece, the Assumption of the Virgin (R. II, No. 40), requires
no comment; the glowing rupture of the apostles, the jubilant
delight of the angels, the beaming bliss of the Madonna, and the
mgnithstsmse of the colouring cannot fail to strike the eye of every
beholder. The galtery comprises also the last, uncompleted creation
of this master: the Piste in R. X (No. 400). His Presentation in
, the Temple (R. XX, No. 626) is also very attractive owing to the
spirited grouping and the beauty of the individual figures. Boni-
. fazio L’s wealth of colour is displayed in the Story of Dives (R. X,
' No. 291), the Massacre of the Innocents (R. X, No. 319), and bis
small Madonna (R. X, No. 269). The Miracle of St. Mark (R. II,
' No. 42) by Jacopo Tintoretto, and the Supper in. the house of Levi
I (R. IX, No. 203) by Paolo Veronesc, are specially interesting.

, sance ceiling (end of 15th cent.) is adorned with paintings by Alvin

ROOM II (Sela dell' Assunte) l "40. Titian, Assumption (‘As-
sunta’), painted in 1516-18 for the Frari (p. 310), whose high-
:altar it once adorned, and several times restored.

'There is nothing so remarkable in this enchanting picture as the con-
trast between the apparent simplicity of the results, and the science with
which these results are brought about. Focal concentration is attained by
perspective science, ap lied alike to lines and to atmosphere, at the same
1iyys that a deep sn studied intention is discoverable in the subtle
1?s.tritrytityi of radiance and gloom. . . . Something indescribable strikes
us in the Joyful innocence of the heavenly company whose winged units
crowd together singing, playing, wondering and praying, some in light,
Pee. in half light others in gloom, with a spirit of life moving in them

t eu- 'queen this swarm of angels rises with the beauteous apparition of
the Virgin, whose noble face is trtsnst1gurei1 with gladness, whose step is
momentarily arrested as she ascends on the clouds, and with upturned

face and outstretched arms longs for the heaven out of which the Eternal
looks down. To this central point in the picture Titian invites us by all
