sppesrs here as the heir of Maaaccio, who is by no means well "pre-
sentedin this gallery (Room IV, N o. 70). Filippo 2Upph Coronation of
the Virgin (Room 111, No. 62), with a portrait of himself, belongs to
his later period. In this work the muter obviously aims st sensuous
beauty in his female forms; he departs from the strictly ecclesias-
tical style end borrows various etretytts from the province of sculp-
ture. WrroeehioU Baptism of Christ (Room IV, No. 71), which,
according to Vaseri, was ilnighed by his pupil Leonardo da Vinci,
betrays a certain crudity in the figure of the Baptist, while the
landscape and the two angels distantly recall Leonardo’s technical
skill and sense of form. Sandro Botticellt's Spring (Room IV,
No. 80), which transports us to the realm of antique myth, is the
most popular picture in the gallery, owing to its fairy-like charm.
Domenico Ghirlandajo was thoroughly conversant with traditional
forms, and with their aid he has been enabled to produce majestic
and spirited figures, and to unite in them the result of the labour
of two generations. His Madonna and angels (Room 111, No. 66) is
better preserved than the Nativity of Christ (Room WI, N6. 195).
A comparison of Ghirlandajo's simplicity of style, the outcome of
" mature imagination, with the elaborate and exaggerated manner
of many old masters, is most instructive. Lorenzo di Credh Nativity
(RoomV, No. 92) is attractive on account of its beauty of expression
and the careful execution of the landscape. Among Fra Bartolomeo’s
pictures, Mary appearing to St. Bernard (Room Y, No. 97) is pant-
cularly worthy of notice, as it affords an insight into the master's
method of painting. Mariotto Alhertinelli, who is closely allied to
Fre Bartolomeo, is well represented by a Trinity (Room III, No. 63);
his Annunciation (Room VII, No. 169) is no longer in its original
condition.

This gallery is important also to the student of Umbrian art in
the 15th century. It possesses one of the chief works of Gentile da
Fabriano, an Umbrian master, closely allied to Fra Angelica in his
modes ofthought(Adomtion of the Magi; Room XVI, No. 165). This
work affords distinct evidence of the unity of sentiment which
existed between the Schools of the North and South in the 15th cent.,
notwithstanding their external independence. Peruginohr pictures
are greatly above the average merit of his works: in his Pieth
(Room III, No. 56) an admirable individuality of character is ex-
hibited; his skill " a colourist is shown in his Mount of Olives
(63); and his Assumption (57), admirable both in composition
and execution, reveals him at the zenith of his power.

From the VESTIBULR (Room I), in which is the tiektst-offlee, we
proceed straight on to Room II, the flrist portion of which is hung
with tine Flanders tapestry (scenes from the Creation), in the style
of Barend van Orley (d. 1541).

Beneath the cupola at the other end of the room stands the
celebrated *David (NI (1igante') by Michael Angelo, shaped by the
