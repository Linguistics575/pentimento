In the vicinity is the ‘Teatro Olimpioo (P1. C, 2; custodian to
the left, behind the theatre, Contrada Teatro Olimpico No. 987; fee
1/2 fr.), begun by Palladio in 1579, completed in 1584, after his
death, by Scamozzi, and inaugurated by the performance of the
'Gldipms Tyrennue’ of Sophocles. Pelladio adhered generally to the
precepts of Vitruvius as to the construction of ancient theatres, but
the building is far from being a mere imitation. The auditorium
rises In thirteen tsemi-oral tiers, while the orchestra and the two-
storied stage lie 5 ft. below the level of the seats. The three door-
openings at the back of the stage afford views of ascending streets,
in curiously deceptive relief.

The Contrada di Santa Corona, diverging just before the B. end
of the Corso, leads to the Dominican church of Santa. Corona (P1.
C, 2), a Gothic brick edifice of 1260-1300, with a plain facade.

Opposite, to the left, in the Contrada Giacomo Zanella, stands
the unfinished Palazzo Thiem (now the Banca Popotare), the front
designed by Palladio (1556), the back part facing the Coutrada
Porti, being an early-Renaissance structure. Opposite to it rises
the imposing PALAZZO POBTO-BABBARANO (Pl. B, C, 2), by Paltadio
(1570), and farther on, to the left, are the Gothic Pal. Porto, with
an attractive early-Renaissance portal of 1481, and two Palassi
Coueom', of which one is Gothic with a fine colonnade end staircase,
the other by Palladio.
