with 7 207 inhab. and a good harbour, is most pieturesquely situated
on a promontory amidst dense olive-groves. Olive-oil is the staple
commodity, the finest kinds being produced here and at Oneglia.

Beyond a short tunnel a valley on the right affords a charming
view of Busaana Vecchia, romantically perched on a hillock. The
ruins of this village, which was completely destroyed by the earth-
