Parma (170 ft.), situated on the river Parma, a smell tributary
of the Po, the capital of a province (formerly a duchy), is a town of
entirely modern appearance, but of very ancient origin, with broed
streets, and 48,523 inhabitants. It is a bishop’s see and possesses
a university founded in 1422. .

The foundation of Perms. is probably to be ascribed to the consul
M. [Emilius (B.C. 183), though the discovery of a lake-dwelling of the
bronze period in 1864 proves that a. human settlement existed here in pre-
historic times. The town otrered a determined resistance to the attacks
of the Ligurians, but it was destroyed by Mark Antony es the birthplace
of Cassius, one of Caesar‘s murderers. Under Augustus, who named it
Colonic: Julia Augusta Parma It attained to new prosperity; and repeated
devastation in the early middle ages proved only temporary checks to
the growth of its importance, which arose mainly from its woollen
mtusufaetorieg. Puma. participated in the general development of the
towns of U per Italy, zealously espoused the cause of the thuslphs,
and in 1247 was long unsuccessfully besieged by Emp. Frederick 11.
In 1303 Giberto da Correggio obtained possession of the supreme power.
In 1316, after various vicissitudes, Puma. came intp the hands of the
Triseonti, end from that period down to 1612 it was generally united with
the Duchy of Milan. In 1616, after it had been annexed to the Stetea y

"he Church, it was presented by Pope Paul 111., with Piecenze, to 1m
infamous son Pier Luigi Furnace. This prince was assassinated in 1547,
and was succeeded by seven dukes of his family, including Alexandr
