Tuscany which covers an area of 9287 sq. M. and contains 2,226,200
nheb., in divided into eight provinces of very iiiiGi"iit sizes; m'm Kaua-
C'arrara, 687 MI. M. in area, 10% an independent dnchy and afterwards
mited with Modems down to 1 , Lucca, tym MI. M. In tree, 3190 long
pdepertdertt, but incorporated with the duchy of Perms from 1814 to 1847;
Florence the largest province, 2267 sq. M. in area; Leghorn, the smallest,

Tuscany still retains the name of its ttmt inhabitants, the Tuaci or
