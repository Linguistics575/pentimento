268 Route d2. VENICE. History of Art.

1ttur.u'irn3point of size the eBr1y-Remu%anets buildings In Venice cannot
compare with those of Tuscany, but they are non richly decorated, and
retain the articulation peculiar to the earliest period. At a later period
Venetian architecture may justly boast of holding out against the rocoeo
style longer than Central Italy. Chief among Venetian architects were
several of the Lombardi family (immigrants from Carona, 0n the Lago di
Lugano), Moro Codueei (d. 1504) Jacopo Bamaoino of Florence (1488-1570;
see below), Giovanni da Panto (1512-97), and lastly Andrea Palladio of Vieenzs
(1518-80; p. 243), who inaugurated a new era, especially in ehurch-arehi-
. tectnre, by limiting the fatade to a single range of massive columns.

Pa11tsdio'g chief successors were Vincenzo dhramorg" 552-1618) and Baldauare
Longluma (1604-75).

In the province of Scunr'wnn the city possessed at the end of the 14th
cent. two important masters in the brothers Managua, who had probably
studied in the school of the Sana (ca. 1345-75). In the 15th cent. the
growing taste for monuments] tombs gave abundant employment to the
sculptors, and led to the execution of those mtrgnifieent monuments which
still t111 the churches of Venice. The names of the Baum, of Antonio Rina
of Verona (c. 1430-ca. 1498), of the Lombardi (see above), end of Alessandro
Letpardi (d. 1522) who had formed himself by the study of Greek sculp- l
tures, are the most important. After 1527 Jac6po Bansooa'no, sculptor and
'architect, was the leading master. His works, though often designed for _
pictorial tstreet, are more pleasing than those of Michael Angelou school. _
His pupils were atrolamo Gampaana (1552-1823) and Alessandro Vittoria
t162N1808). _

VENETIAN PAINTING did not begin to attract universal attention till
the beginning of the 16th cent. (comp. p. Ix9. In the 14th cent. it was
far inferior to that of other Italian schools, and though Giotto was en~ _
gaged in the neighbouring town of Padua, it remained unaffected by his l
influtsmse. In 1365 Guarteuto of Padua, and in 1419 the Umbriui Gentile da 3
Fabriano and Vino" Picasso of Verona, were invited to Venice to decorate
the doges' palace. In the 15th cent. the most noted masters were Giovanni
(also named Alemamms), Antonio, Bartolomeo, and Aloha (Luigi) Vivarim',
known as the Muranesd, Jaeiipo Belum‘, father-in-Iaw of Mantegna, who
inilmsneed the Paduan school (p. 249), and Carla 01-foot“. Antonella da
Messina introduced painting in oils into Venice about 1473, and the new
method contributed powerfully to the development of the t1rgt gurely
Venetian artists in Gentile (1427-1507) and Giovanni Bellt'tti (1428-151 I, the
sons of Jseopo. Giovanni Bellini, who had many pupils, is with Mantegna
the most important master of the early Renaissance in N. Italy. Alike in
composition (as in the ‘santa. conversazione‘, B peaceful, yet expressive
group of saints with the Madonna), in his love of colour and appreeUtion
of lendscape, and in his conceptiOn of female figures, he may be regarded
as the precursor of the glorious prime of Venetian painting. Among his
contemporaries were Vittore Carpaccio (d. 1520), a live] pictorial narrator,
and Marco Basam (d. 1521), while to his school belongs Oima da Comgliano
(14594517), Vincenzo Carina, Andrea Emu, Niccolb 2tondtnettt, and others.

The first of the rent masters of the late Renaissance was Giorgione
(Barbarem, 1477?-151 J, but unfortunately only the alter-piece at Castel-
franeo (p. 257) is thoroughly authenticated as his work; though " Venice
the 'Fairiig1ia d1 11iorgione' in the Pal. Gi0vanelli (p. 300) and an Apollo
and Daphne in the Seminario Patriarcale (p. MT) are ascribed to him.
The peculiar glow of his colouring, an attribute which seems natural
rather than acquired, imparts even to his isolated halt-ttguy/s, unwanted
life and poetical charm. The flrgt artist who fully developed that type of
female beauty in which simple enjo ent of life is so admirably ex-
pressed was Jacopo Palma (Vecchio, 1 4528) of Bergamo. The olden
hair of his sitters recalls the fashionable practice of the period of yeing
the hair a light colour. Surpassing all his fellows in celebrity, in fertility,
and in the length of his career, next comes the great Trumo Vncnui
(1477-1576). Frescoes by him may be seen in the Scuola del Santa and
Scuola del Carmine at Padus. and in the Dogets' Palace at Venice; and
