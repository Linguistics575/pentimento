The 'Lsgo Maggiore (635 ft.; greatest depth 122011.), the Lacus
Verbanus of the Romans , is about 37 M. long and averages 2-3 M.
in width (area 85 sq. M.). The N. part of the lake belongs to Switzer-
land; the W. bank beyond the brook Valmara, and the E. bank
beyond the Dirinella belong to Italy. Its principal tributaries are on
the N. the Ticino (Tcssin) and the Maggia, and on the W. the Tosa.
The river issuing from the S. end of the lake retains the name of
Ticino. The banks of the N. arm are bounded by lofty mountains,
for the most part wooded, whilst the E. shore towards the lower
end slopes gradually away to the level of the plains of Lombardy.
The water is of a green colour in its N. arm, and deep blue towards
the S.

Opposite Locarno , at the mouth of the Ticino, lies Magadino
(R.; Peru. yioiani, pens. incl. wine 41/2-5 fr., well spoken of, on
the lake), comprising two villages, Magadino Inferior: and Supe-
riore, at the foot of Monte Tamara (p. 12).

To the S. of Locarno we have a view into the valley of the Maggie.
Farther on the W. bank of the lake is studded with country-houses,
villages, and campanili. On the bank of the lake rung the road from
Locarno to Pallanza. In an angle lies Age6na (B.), with a rained
castle and several villas; higher up, on the slope, Ronco. Passing
the two small Isole di Brissago, the steamer reaches Germ and
Rama (R.) on the E. bank. - On the W. bank lies Brissago (HÃ©tcl
Suisse, fair), the last Swiss station, with picturesque villas in Iuxu-.
riant gardens, and a fine group of old cypresses near the church.
The slopes above are covered with vines, fig-trees, olives, and pome-
granates, and even the myrtle t1ourishes in the open air. A pleas-
ant route leads to Madonna del Monte, with its chalybeate spring. -
