pretending), situated at the foot of the &usso dl Form, on a buy at
the mouth of the Bossio, formerly a fortified harbour for the Austrian
gun-boats. Laveno (2000 inhab.) is adapted for a prolonged stay on
account of its beautiful situation and ample railway and steamer
facilities. The quay is close to the station of the Ferrovie Nord,
while that of the Rete Mediterranea lies 1/2 M. farther on in the same
direction (omn.). A monument near the quay commemorates the
Garibaldians who fell in 1859. The site of Fort San Michele (to the
left as the steamer approaches) is now occupied by a pottery belong-

we may ascend the *Monte Nudo (4052 ft.; 11/, hr.), perhaps the ilnest
view-pdint in the district, commanding an imposing survey of the Lago
Meggiore, the Lago di Lugano, the Lago di Varese, and the, Valaieien Alps.
