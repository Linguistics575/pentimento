of 126 steps (lift, 60 o.) to the ”Gallerie degli mm (admission,
see p. 437). The gallery originated with the Medici collections, ttt
which numerous additions have been made down to the most recent
times, and it is now one of the greatest in the world, both in extent
and value. Many of the best pictures are often removed from their
usual position for the convenience of copyists, but their whereebonte
is indicated by a notice on the vacant space. A systematic re-
arrangement is contemplated. Catalogue, in Italian, French, or
English, 3 fr. Director, Signor E. Ridollt.

The pictures in the Tribune o. Mi) me the choicest in the
gallery, as their position indicates, and are therefore all worthy
of careful inspection. These are, however, by no means the only
treasures of the collection. Thus the predelle and the angels at the
sides of Fra Angelico's frequently copied winged picture of the Ma-
donna and angels (No. 1294; p. 468) are more interesting than the
principal picture itself. Among the other annmn works of the
16th cent. we may tlrtrt mention Fra Filippa Lippi’s Madonna with
angels (1307; p. 464), and four works ofdhmdro Botticelli: a round
picture of the Madonna (1267 his; p. 464), the Adoration of the Magi
[1286; p. 468), so much extolled by Vaseri, and, as specimens of
other subjects, his Birth of Venus (39; p. 468), and his Calumny after
Apelles (1182; p. 464). Filippino Lipph Madonna and saints (1268;
p. Md) attracts attention by its size and clear colouring, and his
kdoration of the Magi (1267; p. 464), with its numerous t1gureis, is
interesting on account of the portraits it contains. One of the best of
he early masters wee Domenico t7hirlandajo, whose beautiful round
picture of the Adoration of the Magi (1296; p. 465), and the Me-
lonna with saints (1297; p. 468), are remarkable for the excel-
ence of the composition and the harmony of colouring. The full im-
portance of this master, who excelled in narrative painting, can only
M5 perceived, however, in the domain of fresco-peinting (pp. 602,
306, 607). The mythological works of Piero dt Cosimo (1312;
p. 464, etc.) betray a taste for fantastic subjects, from which Leon.
la Vinoi himself was not entirely free. Pietro Pcrugino, Raphael‘s
eecher , is here well represented only by his brilliant portraits
:1217; p. 463). The portrait of Raphael by himself (288; p. 458) is
genuine, though dttsflgured by retouching. Other paintings by this
naster form the chief gems of the Tribune (p. 462). A very effective
picture, notwithstanding its mtfiniihed condition, is Leon. da Vinci’s
'ich composition of the Adoration of the Magi (1252; p. 464).
Smother very important work, though 11nfinihsd, is F‘ra Bartolomeo’s
Madonna enthroned (1266; p. 464), with its masterly grouping. The
Visitation of Mary (i259; p. 464), by Marietta Albertinelli, an as-
.istant of Fra Bartolomeo, and Sodoma’s St. Sebastian (1279; p. 464)

works of the other Italian Schools the most notable ere Mantegna’s
dadonna among the rocks (1025; p. 465), and among the numerous
