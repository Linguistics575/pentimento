The adjoining ’Oeppella. Oolleoni (shown by the eagrestano), erected
by 6. A.'Amadeo in 1470-76 in the ersrly-Resnaiggauee atyle, has a lavishly
sculptured fatade, which, however, was probably much altered when the
interior was modernized in ITU. The Interior contains the tomb of the
founder Bart. Colleoni (d. 1475; p. 304), begun by a. Ant. Amadeo, with
reliefs from the life of Christ. On the top is the gilded equestrian statue
of Colleoni by Siztus Sin; of Nuremberg (1501). To the r) ht ia the
smaller, but beautiful monument of hie daughter Medea (d. 1470), also

The adjoining Baptistery (P1. 3; on the right), by Giov. da thun-
pione (1340), originally in Santa Maria hGggiore; was re-ensued
here in 1898. In the interior are reliefs of the Passion (key in the
sacristy of the cathedral; fee 30-50 o.).

Opposite is the Cathedral (P1. 13), built from designs by Vine.

high-altar, a thfadonny, a late work of Giov. Bellini (1512; gen-

A little to the E. of the Piazza Garibaldi, in the Via. Colleoni,
is the Luogo Pio Couconi (P1. 4; C, 2), once the dwelling of Bart.
Galleoni, who bequeathed it to the city for an orphanage in 1466.
On the grom1df1oor are some frescoes by Paxino da Nova and other
masters of the 15th cent; among them is an equestrian portrait of
Galleoni (fee of 1/3 fr. to the keeper).

We now return to the station of the tsable-trunway and proceed
thence, to the left, through the Strada Porta Dipinta, passing the
church of Sant’ Andrea, which contains 9. Madonna enthroned with
four saints, by Moretto (altar to the right; covered). Fine view.
The street leads to a small and hilly Piazza with the church of San
Mich ele al Pozso Bianca (Pl. 18, D 2; usually closed), which can-
tains good frescoes by Lor. Lotto, representing the Annunciation
and the Nativity and Marriage of the Virgin (chapel to the left of
the choir; partly concealed by the altar-pisses). -.- We may proceed
to the right through the Via Osmano to the ramparts (p. 194), or
continue to follow the Strada Porta Dipinta to the left to the Porta
Sant’ Agostino (Pl. D, 2), near which is the old Gothic church of
