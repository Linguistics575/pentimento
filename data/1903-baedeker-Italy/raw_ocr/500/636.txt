BRIDGES. The oldest of the six bridges which connect the
banks of the Arno is the Ponte alle Waaie (Pl. E, F, 6, 7; p. 519),
or Rubaeonte, constructed in 1237, modernized and widened in
1874. The Ponte Vccchio (P1. D, E, 6; p. MO), which is said to
have existed as early as the Roman period, and was finally rebuilt,
after its repeated demolition, by Taddeo Gaddi in 1345, consists of
three arches. The Ponte Santa Trinita (Pl. D, 5; p. 503) was
originally erected in 1252, and rebuilt tn 15b'7-70 by Bartolomeo
Ammanati. The Ponte alla Carraja (Pl. 0, 4; p. 507), originally built
in 121840, destroyed together with the Ponte Vecehio by an in-
undation in 1333, and restored in" 1337, was partly rebuilt in 1559
by Ammanati and restored and widened in 1867. Besides these, there
is an Iron Bridge at each end of the town (toll 5 c., carriages 42 e.).
The river is bordered on both sides by handsome quays, called
the LUNGABNO, of which the different parts are the Lungamo Corsini,
Lungamo Amerigo Vespucci (formerly Nuovo), Lungamo Serristori,
Lungarno Giucciardini, etc. The most frequented squares are the
