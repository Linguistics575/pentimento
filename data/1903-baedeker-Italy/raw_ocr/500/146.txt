prominent. A good bridle-path ascends from Courmeyeur, by La Saws
(b. 56) and Villat'r, to the a hrs.) Chalets de Prh (6480 ft.) and the (1 hr.)

13. From Aosta to the Graian Alps.

The Gneux ALPS, an extensive motuttain-trystprn culminating in the
Gran Paradiso (18,324 ft.) and the Grt'vola (13,022 ft.), lie between the
valleys of the Dora Baum and the Isére 0n the N., and those of the
Dora Riparia and the Are on the S. We here describe a few of the most
interesting routes through the E. part of this grand mountain-region,
in the form of a circular tour of four days from Aosla, taking in Cogne,
Vakavaranchc, Rhému Notrc-Dame, Valgrisanche, and Liverogne. Cogne is
the best centre for excursions.

The mountains of Cogne formed a favourite chaste of King Humbert,
" they did of his father Victor Emmanuel (p. 53), and the mountain
goat ('8teinboek', Ital. 'tstambtsetso', Br. 'bouquetin0, elsewhere nearly
extinct, is still found here. Several excellent bridle-paths, leading to the
toral shooting-lodges, are a great assistance to the pedestrian.

lst Day. - From AOSTA TO Grams (61/2 hie). As far as (6 M.)
Aymaville (2120 ft.) we may follow the highroed (p. M), but it is
preferable to cross the Dora near Aosta, and to go by Gressan and Jo-
vcngan, across meadows and fieldg. The bridle-path then ascends
rapidly past the church of St. Martin to Poia (2790 ft.), and enters
the monotonous,Va.1 de Gogne at a great height above the ravine of
the brawling Grand’ Eyvie. Far below we soon observe the houses
of Pont d’Ael (2865 ft.), with its admirably preserved *Roman
Bridge (formerly an aqueduct), 60 yds. long and 390 ft. above the
stream. It was erected in the reign of Augustus. The valley con-
tracts. Near the bridge by which we cross the stream we obtain a
view of the Grivola for a short time. We next reach (11/2 hr.)
Viéyes (3714 ft.; cantine), at the mouth of the Combo de Nomenon
(pretty waterfall), with the Grivola and the Gran Nomenon
(11,440 ft.) in the background. Beyond (1/4 hr.) Silvenoirc (right)
md a deserted iron-foundry we again cross the brook by the Pont
de Laval 4480 ft.), where the mountains of Cogne are revealed,
to (11/, hr. hind (4760 ft.), opposite the lofty Punta det Pousset
[see below) and the Trajo Glacier. At (1/2 hr.) Orétaz the Val-
nontey descends from the S. to the Grand' Eyvie; (20 min.) Cogne.

Oogne (5033 ft.; l'Couronne, R. 11/2-21/2,B. 11/2, dej. 21/2, D. 31/2,
pens. 61/2 fr.; Grivola, similar charges, clean), charmingly situated,
with a. beautiful view of the Gran Paradiso and the Tour du Grand
M Pierre, with their glaciers (Glacier de la. Tribulation, du Grand
Grou, du Money, etc.) to the S., and of the Mont Blane to the N.W.,
is an excellent tstarting-point for excursions. Three valleys converge
here: the Vallone di Valnontcy from the 8., the Valtonc d’Urtier
from the S.E., and the Vallonc di Grauson from the Na.
