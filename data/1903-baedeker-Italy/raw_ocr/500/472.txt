(p. 283).

g. From the Piazza of St. Mark on foot to the Academy and
Santa. Maria. dens. Salute. Ban Giorgio Maggiore. Giudecce.

The passage in the S.W. corner of the Piazza of St. Mark leads
to the SALIZZADA SAN MOISE, with its numerous shops. To the
right is the Freaseria (p. 263), another busy street. To the left is
the church of San Heine (Pl. G, 6), with an over-decorated facade
by Al. Tremignan (1668), 'notable', says Mr. Ruskin, 'as one of the
basest examples of the baseet school of the Renaissance’. John
Law (1671-1729), originator of the ‘Mississippi Scheme’, is buried
in this church. Beyond it we cross the bridge and proceed straight
on along the VIA VENTIDUB MABZO.

The second aide-atreet to the right, the Calle delle Vesta leads to the
Cempo Sen Fentino, in which are situated the Teatro Fenice I, P, 6); the
Ateneo Vanda (see p. 263), aReneisaence building by A1. Vittoria, formerly
the Sruola di Ban Girolamo; and the church of SAN FANTINO, built in the
early-Renaissanee style after 1500, with a. itne choir by Jae. Samov‘no (1583).

The Via Ventidue Marzo crosses a. second bridge and leads to
the church of Santa. Maria. Zobenigo (P1. F, 6), erected in 1680-83
by ' dlardi for the Barbaro family Oarbaro monumento dd
deeadimento dell' arte', as it has been called). The niches of the
baroque facade contain statues of members of the family. At the
base of the lower row of columns are plans of Zara, Candie, Padua,
Rome, Corfu, and Spalato, hewn in the stone; above are representa-
tions of naval battles.

Leaving this church, we cross the Campo San Maurizio, where
the small church of that name is situated, to the larger CAMPO
FRANCESCO Monoemr (Pl. E, F, 6), which has been embellished
since 1882 with a marble statue of Niccolb Tommaseo, philosopher
and teacher (d. 1874), by Franc. Barzaghi, of Milan. To the left
is the Pal. Morosim' and to the right is -

*ganto gt;attino Pl. F, 5, m, a Gothic church of the 14th cent.,
with an elegant facade in brick and good window-mouldings in terra-
cotte. The interior has a peculiarly constructed vaulting of wood,
which, along with the wide intervals of the slender columns, im-
parts a very pleasing appearance to the interior and recalls San
Fermo at Verona (p. 230). On the walls are ancient frescoes, re-.
cently discovered and found to be in good condition.

ENTRANCE WALL, above the principal door, equestrian statue of Dom.
Conterini, middle of 17th cent; adjacent, (1.) the fine tomb of the physician
