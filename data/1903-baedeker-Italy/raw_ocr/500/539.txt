Gallic Boil, and by them celled Bonom'a. In the Punic War It espoused
the cause of Hannibal after which, B.C. 189, it was converted into a
Roman colony, at little before Penn: and Mutina (Modena), by the consul
C. Leliue, and as such was a place of very great importance. It after-
wards belonged, to the Greek Bxarehate, and then to the Lombard, and
Franks. In 1112 Bmp. Henry V. constituted Bologne a free town (whence
