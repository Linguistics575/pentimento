'Portreit of a lady; 'Portraits of two men.

'The firte.tt1tiMs11ed features (of the lady), extremely pure in drawing,
Charm by their mild expression. A delicate but healthy com lexion is
displayed in warm sweet tones of extraordinary trunsParence; an masterly
transitions lead the eye from opal lights into rich and coloured shadows.
A half length in the same collection represents a. men of lean and bony
make with a. awa11ow-tailed heard, a grey eye, close set features, and a
grave aspect. . . . A third half length, companion to these, offers another
vuiety of type and execution. A man stands at a. table in a pelisse with
a fox akin collar; he is bare-headed and bearded. His right hand rests
on the table and grips e handkerchief. The ruddy skin of the face is
broken with touches now warm now cold by which the play of light and
rtylltxtiont, is rendered with deceptive truth'. - C. it C.

'It is a icmre 'in which Mantegna‘s grandest style is impressed,
silhh'dhi? with disagreeable boldness, but with sur rising truth,
studied from nature, and imitating light shade, and re ection with a.
carefulness and perseverance only ihii"tiiri by Leonardo and Diirer; dis-
playing at the same time an excess of tragic realism, and a painful un-
