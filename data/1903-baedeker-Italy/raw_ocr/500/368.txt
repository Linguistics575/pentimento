M, Ind, after the Ctsrlovingitut epoch, Berengam'us A, ruled here. Verona
afterwards headed the league of Venetian cities against Frederick Barbe-
msus. During the Beree contests between Guel he and Ghibellines the
terrible Eateltno da Romano (d. 1269) endeavoure to establish a. lordship
“Verona. The year after Ezzelino‘s death Mastino delta Scale, another
Ghibelline, was elected Podesth. The Scaligers, the great princes of his
house, inaugurated a glorious period for the city. Mastino was assassinated
111277, but his brother and successor Albert secured the supremacy of
his line. Romeo and Juliet are said to have loved and died in the reign
of Albert‘s son Bartolomeo (1301-04). The greatest member of this illus-
trious family was Can Francesco, or ' Jan Grunde A' (li312-29) who captured
Vicenzs and subdued Padue after a long struggle. His Uiiiiufi court
numbered Dante among its guests. Mastiuo 11. (1329-51) st ilrgt conquered
Brescis, Perms, and Lucas, but his rule was afterwards restricted to
Verona and Vicenze by a league formed by Florence Venice, and Milan.
On Grands 11., his successor, was murdered by his brother Can 1819an
in 1359; and in 1387 the latter’s son Antonio, who had also endeavoured
tosecure his possession by fratricide, was expelled by Gian Galeauo Vis-
contf, Lord of Milan. Through the widow of Visconti the town passed in
1% to the Venetiam, to whom with short interruptions, it remained
subject down to the end of the he ublie.

In the history of Ancmwnoruxn erona is important, both on account of
itsmediazval buildings, and as the birthplace of FM Giocondo (ea. 1436-1514),
one of the most famous srehitects of the early Renaissance whose works
nets be found at Veliiee, Paris, Treviso (fortif1tustiom0, an Rome, and as
the home of Michele dhmmt'chelt (1484-1559), who sought to unite the beauty
of the Ionic order with the grim strength of military forttheutom, and
adorned the city with a series of sumptuous edifleeg. In judging of the
Verona palaces, we must bear in mind that it was customary here, as "
various other towns of the Venetian ‘terrs ferrms', to adorn the facades
with paintings. The painted facades of houses near San Fermo, by the
Ports Borssri in Piazza delle Erbe, and others partly recall the Paduan
style of the 15th century. - The earlier Veronese Psmrnns of the second
Ulf of the Itth cent. were an erior especially in colouring to the Floren-
tine school of Giotto and he] themselves clear of its fnflatsnety. The chief
of these masters was Alttchteri, to whom is ascribed the fresco in Sant’
Ansstssia o. 225), the only monument of the period in Verona (other free-
coes in Padua, see p. 251.). A new period of importance began in the 15th
century. Among the chief masters were Vittore Pisamo (d. ca. 1451), the
celebrated medallist; Liberate da Verona, especially noteworthy for his
miniatures; Domenico and his son Franc. Morone; Francesca Garcia (1470-
1548)- tArotamo dat' Librt (1474-1556); and Paolo Morando, surnamed Ca-
Grill, (1486-1522). The artistic family of the Boneam'tu, though originating
in Verona, flourished mainly in Venice. On the other hand Paolo valid“,
summed Vermse (1628-88) also resident in Venice, owed his artistic
development mainly to the 'tztfluenety of his native place. --. In the history
of SCULPTURE Verona also holds a place of some importance, as is evidenced
by the Romanesque reliefs on the fegade of Sen Zeno (p. 229), the font
of San Giovanni m Fente (p. 226), and the Gothic monuments of the See.-
ligers (p. 22N.
