10 Route 3. LUGANO. From Lueeme

Civico (P1. c, 3), erected in 1844, with a beautiful colonnaded
court and a small Collection of Paintings by local artists on the tint
floor (open 10-12 and 2-4; fee). Beyond lies the Piazza della Ri-
forma. - A broad QUAY, planted with trees and much frequented
as an evening-promenade, stretches, under various names, along the
lake. At its B. end is the Theatre o. 9); at the S. end of the
Quai Vincenzo Vela is a small Fountain Statue of Tell (P1. o, 4), by
Vela (1852).

The old eonventual church of SANTA MARIA DEGLI ANGIOLI
(Pl. 0, 4), adjoining the Hétel du Pare, contains some good frescoes
by Bernardino Luim'. . .

The painting on the wall of the screen (1529), one of the largest and finest
ever executed by Luini, represents the “Passion of Christ, and contains
several hundred figuras, arranged according to the antiquated style in
two rows. In the foreground, occupying the upper part of the wall,
stand three huge crosses, at the foot of which we perceive Roman war-
riors, the groups of the holy women, and St. John, and the executioner,
casting Iota for the garments. Above on a diminished scale, from leftto
right, are Christ on the Mount of blivee, Christ taken prisoner, the
Mocking of Christ, the Bearing of the Cross, the Entomlrment, Thomaais Un-
belief, and the Ascension, all immediately adjacent. Although the style of
the composition strikes one as old-fashioned, the eye cannot fail to be
gratified by the numerous beau tiful details. The St. Sebastian and St. Rochus,
below, between the arches, are particularly tine. - To the left, on the
wall of the church, is the Last Supper, and in the Ist Chapel on the right
is a. fine Madonna, two frescoes by Luini. The chapel also contains the
tomb of Archbp. Lachat (d. 1886). The sacristan expects a small fee
(20-30 eo.

The interior of the town, with its arcades, its shops and
workshops in the open air, and the granite wheel-tracks in the
streets, is also quite Italian in its character. - Ban Lorenzo
(Pl. 0, 2), the principal church, on a height below the station,
built at the close of the 15th cent., has a tastefully enriched marble
facade in the ear1y-Renaisstsamus style, probably by Tommaao Rodari
(1517). --. The terrace in front of the station commands an extensive
*View of the town and the lake.'

There are various pleasant WALKS, well provided with guide-
posts and benches. To the S., on the highroad through the suburb
of Paradise (Pl. A, B, 6; electric tramway, see p. 9), and by the
foot of Mte. Salvatore, to the (11/4 M.) headland of San Martino.
To Melide, see p. 12. - From Paradiso a footpath leads to the right
to (5 min.) the Belvedere, which commands another tine view. '
To the W. by the Ponte Tresa road (P1. A, B, 4, 6; p. 154; short-
cuts for walkers), to the (11/2 M.) hill on which clies the frequented
Restaurant du Jardin (also pension), with a shady garden. The
village of Sorcngo (i326 ft.; Pens. de la Golline d'Or) is situated
on a hill to the right (fine view from the church; to the W. is
the Lake of Muzzano). A carriage-road leads from the Restaurant
du Jardin, to the left, vit Gentilino, to (11/2 M.) the conspicuous
church of Sant’ Abbondio (1345 ft.), tn the graveyard of which
are several monuments by Vela. The walk may be pleasantly
