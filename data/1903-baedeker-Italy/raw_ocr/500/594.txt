Painting. To the right of the chapel, on the E. WALL: Crueuixion,
Ascension. the Doubting Thomas, and Resurrection, by aFollower of Giotto
(14th cent), add by Veuri to be 2hegratrnaceo. All these have been repainted.

0n the S. WALL: "Triumph of Death: to the left are represented the

retired life of the pious hermit end the worldliness of the wealthy who
on their way to the chase are suddenly reminded by three open Gr'il,i; of
the trtusgitor'uMytut of human pleasures; in the centre is Death, invoked
in vain by the poor and wretched; above are devils bearing away the
souls of the deceued to a fiery punishment; to the right, the eternal
happiness of the blessed, who are seated in a. garden, beneath pomegranate
trees; above are angels with the souls of the redeemed. Next are the
cLast Judgment (attitude of the Judge celebrated and imitated even by
Fa Btsrtolomtyo and Michael Angelo) and Hell (lower halfentirely repainted).
These three are attributed by Vuari to Andrea Orcagna, but modern critics
believe that they were executed about 1850 by Piean masters (perhaps
Franc. Tratnt). The following fresco, representing the Life (temptations
and miracles) of the holy hermits In the Theben wilderness, which Vasari
ascribes to Pietro Lorenzem of Siena, is by an unidentified hand. Above
the entrance is a'Madonna 'in exeelsia‘ by P. Tratni. - Between the two
entrances, the life of St. Reinerue, the tutelary saint of Piaa. The four
upper scenes (conversion from a worldly life, journey to Palestine, victory
)ver temptation, retirement to a monastery) were completed by Andrea
la Firenu in 1377 (of which there in documentary proof, though Vasari
ttributes them to Simone Martini of Siena). The four lower and better-
xecuted scenes (return from Palestine, miracles, death, and removal of
jg body to the onthedrel of Pisa, the last much injured) were painted
y Antonio Veneziano in 1386-7. - Then, above, scenes from the life of
t, Ephesus (who as a. Roman general, fighting against the heethens,
:ceivea a tltrg of victory from the Archangel Michael, but is afterwards
)ndemned and executed); below, scenes from the life of St. Potitus,
iminbly portrayed by Spindle Arcana in 1391, but now almost obliterated.
Lastly, the history of J ob, by Francesco da Volterra (erroneously attributed
Giotto), begun in 1370, in bad preservation.

0n the w. WALL no paintings of importance.

On the N. WALL the history of Genesis: tirat the Creation (God the
tther holding the world in both hands, 'il mapptsmondo'r, then in the
Ter series, Creation of Man, the Fall, Ex ulaion from Paradise, Cain
d Abel, Building of the Ark, Deluge, an Noah's "eritlee, by Pietro
Puceio of Orvieto about 1880 (erroneously attributed by Vasari to
