ehese Raffaele Deferrari, Duke of Galliera (d. 1876). The M010
Nuovo was prolonged to the SE. by the Mala Duca di Galliera
(about i M. long), and on the E. side a new breakwater, the Mole
Giana or Orientals (550 yds. long), was added, creating a new harbour
(Porto Nuovo) and an outer basin (Avamporto) for war-vessels. A
new outer harbour, the Bacino del Faro beside the M010 Nuovo, is
expected to be finished about 1905 (comp. the Map, p. 84). The
aggregate water area of these different basins is 555 acres; the
length of the quays (calate) is 5 M. In 1900 the harbour was entered
and cleared by 13,602 vessels, of which 7292 were steamers. The
value of the imports (3, 075,789 tons; . chiefly coal and grain)
was 520,000,000 fr., that of the exports (232,300 tone) was
240,000,000 fr. '

To reach the harbour from the railway-station, we traverse the _
Piazza Acquaverde (Pl. 0, 2; p. 81) and descend the narrow VIA
SAN GIOVANNI (Pl. B, 0, 2) towards the B. To the right, at the corner _
of the Piazza della Commenda, is the small ear1y-fhrthie church of 7
San Giovanni Battista or di 2bt (13th cent.), which originally be F
longed to a lodge of the Knights of St. John. Since a reconstruction
in the 17th cent. the entrance has been at the E. end. _

The busy VIA CARLO ALBERTO (Pl. o, D, 2-4), skirting the T
Piazza della Commenda, leads to the W. to the Dogana (P1. B, 2),
or custom-house, and to the Ponte Federico Guglielmo (p. 67), the V
landing-place of the oceanic steamers. Farther on are the Palazzo
Doria o. 81) and the large lighthouse (p. 82). To the E. the
street leads past the Magazzini della Ddrsena, the former marine (
arsenal, the old Darsena (P1. 0, 3), or mrr-har1umr, in which Fiesco T
was drowned in 1547, and the Porticato di Sottoripa (Pl. D, 4),
with arcades restored in the Gothic style in 1900, to the Fuzz;
CAMCAMENTO (Pl. D, d, 5), in which a bronze statue, by Rivalta,
was erected in 1893 to 2hrf'aele Rubattino (1809-72), the Genoese
tstearniship-owner. 0n the S. side of the square is the Gothic Palazzo
di San Giorgio, erected about 1260, enlarged in the 14th cent; and
in 1571, and from 1408 to 1797 occupied by the Banoa di San Giorgio
(p. 71). It is now being converted into a produce-exchange. The Urge
hall is embellished with 21 marble statues of men who have deserved
well of the city, partly of the 15-16th pentury. The best are those
of Luca Grimaldi and Ant. Doria (by Tamagnini; 1508) and Franc.
Lomellini (by Pace Gagini; 1509).

Beside the Piazza Raibetta (PLD, li; electric tramways, p. 68),
farther on, is the Porto Franco, or free harbour, with extensive
bonded warehouses (visitors admitted; no smoking .

The broad VIA VITTOBIO EMANUEL]! (P1. D, ti), skirting the E.
side of the free harbour, leads to the S.W. to the Piazza Cavour
(Pi. D, 6), to the S. of which begins the Via ill Cireomra1Iazione a
Mare o. 83). To the W. is the Molo Vecchio, with the Porta del
