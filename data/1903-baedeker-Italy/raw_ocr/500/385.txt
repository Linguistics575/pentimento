238 Route 38. MANTUA. From Verona

The entire quarter between the Piazza Bordello and the Lego
Inferiore is occupied by the spacious Reggie, or Corte Beale
(Pl. D, 2), origimlly a palace of the Bonaeolsi (1302), afterwards
frequently added to by the Gonzagae, but now in great part un-
occupied. The original Gothic facade, with its bettlemente, is still
in good preservation. The original splendour of the palace is still
represented in the apertments of Isabelle d'Wte (p. 236) as well
as id those altered for Federico II. in 1525-81 by Giulio Romano.
The elegant decorations in the classieist style, now to be seen in
several of the rooms destroyed by the Austrians in 1630, date from
the reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph IE.' and from the time of
the Viceroy Eugene Beauharnais (p. lit).

A visit to the palace requires not less than 1 hr. The custodian is
to be found under the second large arched gateway to the left (fee 1 fro.

on the marble door, and the delicate ceiling-painting. The motto of the
princess, 'nee epe nee meta', appears several times. The corner-roon
commands a charming view of the now neglected garden and of the Lego
