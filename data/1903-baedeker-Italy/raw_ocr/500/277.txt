The *Lake of Como (650 ft.), Italian Lago di Comtror Il Lario,
the Lacus Lariua of the Romans, is extolled by Yirgi10hsorg. ii. 159),
and is in the estimation of many the most beautiful lake in N. Italy.
Numerous villages and the gay villas of the Milaneee aristooraey,
surrounded by luxuriant gardens and vineyards, are scattered along
its banks. In the forests, above, the brilliant green of the, chestnut
and walnut contrasts strongly with the greyish tints of the olive.
The mountains rise to a height of 7000 ft. The lake, from Come
to the N. extremity, is 30 M. long; its greatest width, between
Menaggio and Varenna, nearly 21/2 M.; greatest depth 1340 ft.; total
area 60 sq. M. At the Punta dt' Bellagio o. 157) the lake divides
into two branches, called respectively the Lakes of Como (W.) and
Leeeo (EU) The Adda (p. IM) enters at the upper extremity and
makes its egress near Lecco. Owing to the narrow bed of the lake,
inundations, as at the Lago ill Lugano, are not uncommon. "'"T" The
industrioua inhabitants of the banks of the lake are much occupied
In the production and manufacture of silk. Tasteful'art'icles in oiive
wood are made at Bellagio. ' '

The variegated hues of the oleanders are very striking in summer.
The laurel grows wild here. - The lake abounds in ilsh, and trout (tote)

of 20le. weight are occasionally captured. The 'Agdni' are small, but
palatable.
