WI. TUSCANY. 399

was by far the most important of the Tuscan cities, and while the citi-
zens were commemorating their victories by the erection of imposing
buildings, Florence had hardly begun to exist. Florence was tlrat indebted
for its progress to the feet that it lay on the great route from the north
to Rome, and commended the passage of the Arno. Under 0tho the
Great many German knights settled here, and at a later period several
noble families traced their origin from German ancestors. The enter-
prising citizens soon conquered the central and upper part of the valley
of the Arno, which the situation of their town enabled them to do, and
their arms were efterwerde attended with farther successes. 'While the
rest of Italy was gradually suffering diememberment and throwing " the
trammela of its earlier traditions, Florence was still quietly developing her
resources, and was thus soon enabled to take possession of the inheritance
of the earlier culture achieved by other towns. After her extensive
commerce had in a. great measure raised her above the narrow aims of
her ancient life, she began to tmfrer, like the rest of Italy, from the
disaensione of a. number of wild factions, bat the more earnest character
of the citizens enabled them more efreetua11y to grapple with these diffi-
culties. Florence may be said to resemble a man of unusual strength,
whose physical development has been but tardy; and thus it was that
she became the mistress of Tuscany”. (Leo). In 1350, among her other
ac uisitione, Florence gained possession of Prato, in 1351 of Piatoja, in
1 of Pisa, in IMO of Cortona, end in 1424 of the harbour of Leghorn.
When at length the free constitutions of the greater part of Italy were
superseded by principalities, Florence did not escape the general fate,
but the change took place in the most favourable manner possible.
Among ell the Italian dynasties by far the Brat in rank was that of the
lodioi, not only owing to their munttieent patronage of art and science,
mt to their prudent administration, their endeavours to improve the
ower cleans, and their care for agriculture, commerce, and the material
nttrtgtg of their subjects. At a. later period their example was followed
>y the princes of Lorraine and down to the present time Tuscany has
:njoyed the enviable lot of? being the moat enlightened and civilised. and
be beet-governed'atete in Italy. The fact that Tuscany unreservedly
)articipeted in the national uptretione for unity and freedom, and
voluntarily recognised the hegemony of e comparatively distant and
ittsyznpathetie section of the Italian race, afforda the strongest possible
avidence of the earnestness of that remarkable revolution which led to
he unit of Italy.

In , with the aid of the arms of Emperor Charles Tr., the dynasty
f the Medici was firm1 established in the sovereignty of Florence. The
viae Duke Cocimo I. ( -'U) extended his dominion, considerably, par-
iculerly by the e uteitiou of Mena in IMT, which was ceded to him by
he emperor. In 1 9 he obtained from Pope Pius V., instead of the coveted
Ltle of King, that of Grand Duke (grandma). of Florence. He abdicated
It tavoir of his son Francesco (1574-87). Francesco was succeeded by his
rother Ferdinand I. (1587-1609), who had previously been a. cardinal.
'oimo ll. (1609-21) the son of the latter, Ferdinand If. (1621-70), and
'osimo III. iiifiiii% were the next princes. With Giovanni Ganton, who
ted in 1787, the house of Medici became extinct. In the wars between
uetria and Spain, the two great powers to which Italy wee subject, Tue-
any formed one of the principal objects of contention, but eventually fell

ef, and conferred it on the husband of his daughter Maria. Theresia, the
