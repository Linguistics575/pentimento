Spirito Santo (P1. E, 3, 4; entrance in the Aria Paolo Costa), or
San Teodoro, erected by Theodorie for the Arian bishops, but re-
built in the 16th century. It is a fut-roofed basilica, with a vesti-
bule at the W. entrance and a Renaissance portal, and is adorned
with fourteen columns of coloured marble in the interior. In the
1st chapel on the left is an ancient marble pulpit. -The saeristan

In the Piazza Anita. Garibaldi (p. 386) is the church of -

Ban Giovanni 1hrange1iist;a (P1. F, 4) , erected in d2d by the
Empress Galla Placidie in consequence of a. vow made during a [
voyage from Constantinople, but almost wholly rebuilt in 1747,
except the tower. The Court in front has retained the form of the
ancient atrium. Above the beautiful portal of the latter (1316) are
reliefs in allusion to the foundation or,the church.

The In'rnuon (if closed, knock at the door), with its unpleaaing barrel
vaulting, consists of nave and aisles borne by twenty-four antique columns.
The avement has been raised by about 6 ft. The vaulting of the 4th chapel
on e left is adorned with frescoes of the four Evangelism, with their
symbols above them, and the four fathers of the church, 88. Gregory, Am,
,broee, Augustine, and Jerome, by Giotto (who had come to Revenue be-
tween 1317 and 1320 on a visit to his friend Dante). In the closed chapel
of St. Bartholomew (left of choir) are remains of a rude Ifoeate Pavement
of 1218, representing scenes from the Third Crusade.

"ant' Apollinare Nuovo (Pl. B, 4, ti), a basilica. erected after
500 by Theodoric the Great as an Arian cathedral (St. Martina: in
Coelo aureo), was in 560 converted by the ArchbishopSt. Agnellus
into a Roman Catholic church. It has borne its present name since
the 8th or 9th century. Thtreampanilts is old. The atrium and
apse were removed in the 16th cent., but the nave still affords the
rare spectacle of a well-preserved interior decoration of the early-
Christian period. The ceiling, however, was modernized In 1611.

The INTERIOR contains twenty-four marble columns brought from
Constantinople. On the right is an ancient ambo. The wells of the nave
are adorned with interesting ‘Jlosaica of the 6th cent., partly of the Aria,
and partly of the Rom. Oath. period, afterwards frequently restored (most
recently in 1898-99): on the left the town of Classis with its Roman build-
ings, the sea and ships, twenty-two virgins with the‘Magi (the E. half
badly restored)-, on the right is the city of Revenue with its churches and
the palace of Theodoric, and twenty-six saints with wreaths approaching
Christ enthroned between angels " group which has also been freely
restored): These lest‘moeaics betray a tendency to the showy style of the
later period, but the 16 single flgursss of the teachers of the church above
them, between the windows, are executed in a. more independent and
pleaeuig manner. Above the windows, on the upper part of the wall, on
each side, are thirteen interesting compositions from the New Testament.
