abolished, and the ecclesiastical administration, as organised by Sixtus V.
In 1590, reestablished. The four northernmost provinces, Bologna Fer-

Legal: (whence these districts were called legatious), whose sway was
arbitrary and despotic in the extreme. The courts of justice and all the chief
msgistraciee were administered by priests, and never probably did a. gov-
ernment earn for itself such a. fund of hatred from its subjects. In
1821, 1831, and 1848, the Emilia succeeded in throwing off the yoke of its
dukes and legates, but on each occasion the insurrection was crushed
by Austrian intervention. The war of 1869 rendered the rising under Parini
a. more successful undertaking, and by the plebiscite of 12th March, 1860,
the annexation of the Emilia. to Piedmont was accomplished.
