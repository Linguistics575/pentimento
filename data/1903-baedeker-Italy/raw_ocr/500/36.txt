evening-resott of the Italians, who seldom observe strict silence
during the performance of the orchestra. The intervals between the
acts are usually very long. Cloak-rooms are found only me few of
the best theatres. Gentlemen usually wear their hats until the
Curtain rises.

Shops. Fixed prices have of late become much more general
in N. Italy, but a reduction may usually be obtained on pumhases
of large amount. The traveller's demeanour should be polite but
decided. Purchases should never be made in presence of a valet-
do-place or through the agency of a hbto1-employee. These indivi-
duals, by tacit agreement, receive a commission on the purchase-
money, which of course comes out of the purehtuusr'is pocket. 0n the
other hand, the presence of an Italian friend is a distinct advantage.

An active trade is driven in spurious antiquities, especially in Venice
and Florence. Ancient works of art should never be purchased without
a written guarantee offheir authenticity. The 'lueky discoveries‘ offered
by the smaller dealers are usually nothing bat traps for the unwary.

Some caution is necessary in buying articles to be sent home. The
full amount should never be paid until the package has arrived and its
contents have been examined. If the shopkeeper does not agree to a. written
agreement " to the method of packing, the means of trans art, and eom- _
pensation for breakages, it is advisable to cut the transae on short. The
lmemiesion of large objects should be entrusted to a goods-agent.
