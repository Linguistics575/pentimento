or Battello is a larger craft, carrying 8 persons. The heavy ndented piron
row (jerro) resembling a helherd, is partly intended to counterbalance the
weight of t e rower, and partly as emeesure of the height of the bridges,

clears them. The rower himself is hailed " 'Pepe', from the poppa on
which he etands. 'Catrar a felu’ means 'to remove the cabin or covering‘.
