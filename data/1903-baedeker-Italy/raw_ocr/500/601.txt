Lucca (62 ft.), formerly the capital of the duchy of that name
and now of a. province, and also the see of an archbishop, with
73,465 inhab., is an antiquated place situated in a fertile plain be-
tween the Monti Pisani and the Alpi Apuane, with well-preserved
fortifieatiom, of 1561-1650 and many interesting churches. ‘Luoca
l’industriosa' is noted for its silk-factories, a branch of industry in-
F troduced from Sicily in the 14th cent., and also for its woollen goods
and oil. An aqueduct, built in 1823-32 by Lor. Nottolini and re-
calling with its 459 arches the aqueducts of the Roman Campagna,
supplies the city with good drinking-water from the Pisen mo untuins.

Lucca (Roman Luca) was founded at a. very remote period. It
firat belonged to Etrurie, afterwards to Liguria, and after its capture by
the Romans in 177 B. 0., it was gerrieoned by a Roman colony and ma
included in the province of Gellia Cisalpina. In B.0. 56 Julius Caesar,
who was then governor of Gaul, held a conference here with Pomp!
and Creams, with whom he had been associated since B. C. 60, in order”
discuss a plan for the administration of the Roman empire for the ensuing
five years. The splendour of Lucca at that period is still indicated try the
remains of a Roman Amphitheatre. After the fall of the Roman Empire.
Lucca. belonged successively to the Goths, Lombarda, end Franks, then
became a. duchy, end in 1115, after the death of the Countess Matilda (p.398),
a republic. The feuds of the Guelphe end Ghibellinea impaired the strength
of the place so seriously that in 1314 it was compelled to succumb to

Uguccione delta Faggiuota of Arezzo, the warlike governor of Pisa. Dante [

resided with his friend Uguccione at Lucca. in 1314, end there beceme
enamoured of the youthful Gentucca (Purgatorio, xxiv. 43), but he does not
describe the inhabitants in very flattering terms (Inferno, xxi. M). After
the expulsion of Uguccione, Laeea fell in 1322 Into the hands of the
powerful Castruccio Gastracani degli Antehninettd of Lucce, who was else
master of Pisa. and Piatoja. On 23rd Sept., 1826, he defeated the Florentine:
at AltOpascio, and in 1327 was nominated imperial governor in Pisa, with
the title of duke, by Emp. Lewis the Bavarian. On his death in 1328
the power of Lucca. declined; its next master was Maniac delta Scam; it
subsequently came into the possession of Florence and then (in 1343) of
Pisa, but in 1369 it purchased its freedom from Charles IV. for 300,000 fiorins,
and with the exception of the rule of the native femil of the thsiniih
iiiiiilsi'iiiiii, it remained independent till the invasion 0 the Wench in
1799. In 1806 Napoleon gave Lucca as a. principality to his sister Elm
Baciocchi; in 1814 it came into the possession of the dukes of Perm; of
the house of Bourbon, who, on succeeding to the throne of Perms after
the death of Marie Louise, ceded it to Tuscany in 1847. f
