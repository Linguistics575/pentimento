In and near the LUNGABNO are several other interesting build-
nge, with which we may terminate our walk.

San Nicoola. (Pl. 0, A), founded about the year 1000 by Count
Iugo of Tuscie as a Benedictine abbey, has an obliquely placed
)ampanile, which contains an admirable winding staircase ascribed
, Niccolo Pisano. - The Piazza in front of the church is adorned
rith a Statue ofFerdinand I., by a. pupil of Giov. da Bologna (1595).

In the Lungerno Regio (p. 406) is the Palazzo Ikmfredueei (P1. 6;
, D, 4), now Tlppesinghi, designed by Cosimo Pagliani, with the
'agment of a chain over the entrance, with the motto 'alla giornata'.
- A little to the B., just before the Ponte dt Mezzo, rises the
Palazzo Agostini, a fine Gothic brick editiee of the 15th century.

At the N. and of the Ponte di Mezzo is the Piazza Garibaldi
'l. D, Til, A), with an excellent bronze Statue of Garibaldi, by
',t. Ferrari (1892; good reliefs on the pedestal). - In the busy
a del Borgo, a few yards to the N. of the bridge, rises -

San Michele in Borgo (Pl. E, 4), a flat-rooted basilica, prob-
ly of the 11th cent., with an old crypt. The facade, which is said
have been designed by Niccolb Pisano (but more probably by his
pil Fra Guglielmo), was partly rebuilt in the Gothic style.

The mosaic flooring in San Pierino (P1. E, 4), near the Piazza
iroli, is of early-Christian origin, and some of the columns are
dque. ---- The narrow Via delle Belle Toni, leading to the E. from

Piazza Cairoli, still preserves a distinctly medieval impress.
