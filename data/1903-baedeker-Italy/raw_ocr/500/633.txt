Pope Alexander VI., perished at the Make in 1498, but his intiuenee endured.
Hero Boderint, elected as gonfaloniere for life in 1502, succeeded in re-
capturing Pisa, which had been freed by the French; but in 1512 the party
of the Medici regained the upper hand and recalled the brothers Giulimo
and Giovanni. The former soon resigned his authority, the latter became
Pope Leo X., and they were followed by Lorenzo, son of Piero II. and
afterwards Duke of Urbino (d. 1519), Giulio, the son of the Giuliano who
was murdered in 1478 (elected pope, as Clement VII. In 1523), and Aut-
:andro, a natural son of the lest-named Lorenzo. The family was again
banished in 1527, but Emp. Charles V., who had married his natural
daughter Margaret (afterwards Duchess of Penna) to Alessandro, attacked
the town and took it in 1530 after a siege of eleven months, dunng which
Michael Angelo, an engineer on the side of the republic, and the brave
partisan Ferruceio greatly distinguished themselves. The emperor then
appointed Alessandro hereditary Duke of Florence. The tumaagintrtion ot
the latter, perpetrated by his own cousin Lorenzo, 7th Jan., 1537, did not
conduce to the re-establishment of the republic. He was succeeded by
Cosimo I. (b. 1519), son of Giovanni delle Bande Nere (d. 1526), the only
soldier of the Medici family, who was a descendant of Lorenzo, brother
of the elder Cosimo. The armed revolt of the Florentine republicans in
1537 was suppressed with the Mil of 8 enish troops (p. 428); and in 1545
Francesco 2_lurlamaeehi, gonfaloniere o Lucca, who had attempted to or
ganize all Tuscany as a united republic, expiated his failure on the treaifold.
Cosimo, who obtained the title of Grend-duke in 1669, now succeeded in
combining the most varied territories into a single monarchical state, which
included the entire basin of the Arno, with Arezzo, Cortona, Montepuleit1e,
Volterra, Pisa, Peseta, Pisa, and (after a bloody war that began in 155)
also Siena. Modern history, see p. 399.
