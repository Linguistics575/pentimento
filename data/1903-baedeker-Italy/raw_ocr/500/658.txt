”605, *599, Titian, Portraits of Francesco Marie dens. Revere
and Eleonora Gonzege, Duke end Duchess of Urbino (1537).

These noble |gortmtts were executed in 1537, when the Duke was
appointed Genet iseimo of the League against the Turks. The Duke
, has a. martial _tstssrittg, the look of the Duchess is stately but subdued.
To make the diirermieis apparent between the blanched complexion of a
dune accustomed to luxury and ease and the tanned feee of a soldier
habitually exposed to the weather, Titian ekilfull varied the detail, of
technical execution. Here he is minute and ttnh ed, there resolute and
breed. Here the tinted end throbbing fleah is pitted against a. warm light
ground, there the aellow olive against . dark well. - C. d: c.

pm On an easel: "620. Titian, The so-celled ‘Flore’, painted
probably before 1520, and still in (liorgione's manner.

There is nothin in this ethereal Flore to shock the sensitive eye.
The proportions an features are of surprising loveliness, reminding us
in their urity of some of the choicest antiques. The masterly and clear
light so e is attained by the thin disposal of pigments, the broad plane
(rt tinting, end the delicate shade of all but imperceptible hecl'f-tgngs. -
