Grado, founded by refugees from Aquileia in 452 under the neme of
Aquileta Nova or Graduc, joined the Venetian naval league o. 220 in Wt
and soon became a dangerous rival of the mother-town. From 57 to 1451
it was the seat of e patriarch, whose title passed to the archbiahOp of
Venice in the latter year. Down to 1797 Gredo belonged to Venice, but I
since 1809 it has been, like Aquileie, under Austrian rule.

The *CATHEDBAL Was founded after the model of the churches
of Revenue by the Patriarch Elias (r, ca. 578), who is mentioned
by name in one of the early-0hritrtian inscriptions. It is a basilica
with aisles bat no traneept, with a modernized nerthex and various
altars of later date. - At high mass on Sun. the Camus patriarchi-
nus, an early mediasval liturgy, is chanted by the clergy and peeple.

the nave, to the left, is a Romanesque pulpit, with a canopy in the Ven-
etian Byzantine style. - The high-altar has an antependium (pain) in em-
beseed silver (1372). In the apse are ancient frescoes and the patriarch‘s
throne put together out of various early-Chrietian fragments. - Several

art (bronze basin with enamels, reliquary) are preserved in the sacristy
and under the Altare del Santissimo Sacramento.

The Coon of the church contains many remains of Roman
Christian monuments, including three Roman "reophagi.
