the station are the Hotel Vauombrosa (burned down in Aug., 1902)
and the Bttet Croce di Savoja; 1/2 M. farther on is the Grand Hotel
Camila di Acquabella (pens. 12-15 fr.).

The 1sarriage-rotul leads through a dense grove of tlrts to (11/4 M.)
Vallombroaa. The road which diverges to the right at the station
and passes the Scoglio del Saltino, e projecting rock with a tine view
of the Arno valley, is only a little longer.

The convent of Vallembroea (3140 ft.), situated in a shaded and
sequestered spot on the N.W. slope of tho Pretomagno chain, was
founded in 1016 and suppressed in 1866. The present buildings,
dating from 1637, have been occupied since 1870 by the Reale
Istituto Forestale, the only advanced school of forestry in Italy.
There are now only three monks here, who celebrate service in the
church, and attend to the meteorological observatory. Hotel: Albergo

The monastery of Vellombroee was founded by San Giovanni Gualberto
($54073), the scion of a wealthy end powerful family of Florence, who after
a career of youthful prof1igtuty resolved to devote the remainder of his life
to the most enetere eete of penance. Hie brother Hugo having fallen by
the knife of en eseuein, Guelberto was bound by the customs of the ego
to follow the bloody law of retaliation. Descending one Good Friday
from the church of Ben Iinieto nee: Florence, eceompenled by emed fol-
lowers, he suddenly encountered the umein at e narrow part of the
roed. The latter fell at his feet and implored mercy. The knight
forgave his enemy, and led him to Ban Mininto, where he himself usnmed
the eowi. Finding the discipline there too lax, however, he betook himself
to this lonely epot end founded Vellombroee.

Il Paradisino (3336 ft.), a smell hermitage situated on a rock
'h hr. to the left above the monastery, is now an annexe to the Alb.
delle Forests (see above; rooms not very comfortable). The plat-
form in front commands an admirable ‘Survey of the monastic
buildings, and of the broad valley of the Arno as far " Florence, half
of the cathedral-dome of which is visible behind a hill. The horizon
is bounded by the Alpi Apuams o. 106). - Another pleasant walk
may be taken on the road leading from the hotel towards the N.E.
along the mounuin-slopas to (2% M.) Logo, which is to be con-
tinued to the Gamma Pan (p. 532).

The uoent of the Becohiete (475011.) the'N. summit of the halo-
magma Chain, from Vellombrose occupies i'A-ii hrs. (guide not Indispensable
for experts). The path diverges to the right, . little before we reach the
Pendisino (see above) end ascends to the SE. mostly through dense pine
forest and afterwards over puturee, passing the so-celled Romitorio delta
Macinaja, to the crest of the ridge, which it reaches at e narrow depres-
eiou. Hence we ascend to the left to (25 min.) the Tabemacolo dt' Don
Piero, an old cha e1 commanding a. eplendid ‘View. To the E. lies the
green Cuentino V ley, bounded on the ICE. by the lofty Monte Falterona,
where the Arno rises; to the W. the fertile and rieh1y-eultivated valley
of the Arno stretches as far as the dome of the cethedrel of Florence,
beyond which the blue Mediterranean is sometimes visible in the extreme
distance. - We may return to Vellombrosa from the chapel by kee Ing
to the N.W., v13. the Croce Rona,- or we may descend to the W. tom
the Romitorio to Seltino direct viii the here ridge of the Bocca a Lupe.
