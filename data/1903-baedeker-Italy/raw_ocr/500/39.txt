half of it, while the humidity rapidly increases as we approach
the Riviera di Levante. The same holds good of the rainfall.
While San Remo has 45 rainy days between November and April,
Ncrvi has 54, and Pisa 67. The average number of rainy days
during the three winter months in the Riviera is 16. Snow is
rarely seen; it falls perhaps once or twice in the course of the
winter, but generally lies only for a few hours , while many years
pass without the appearance of a single tmow-flake. Fogs are very
rare on the Ligurisn coast; but a heavy dew-fall in the evening is
the rule. In comparison with the Oisalpine districts, the Riviera
enjoys a very high proportion of bright, sunny weather.

The above considerations will show that it is often necessary to
discount the unpropitious opinions of those who happen to have
visited the Riviera under peculiarly unfavourable climatic con-
ditions. Not only do the ordinary four seasons differ from each other
on the Riviera, but the different parts of winter are also sharply
discriminated. A short rainy season may be counted on with almost
complete certainty between the beginning of October and the middle
of November, which restricts, but by no means abolishes, open-air
exercise. Then follows from December to February usually an 1111.
interrupted series of warm and sunshiny days, bat invalids have
sometimes to be on their guard against wind. March here, as else-
where in the south, is the windiest month of all, but is much less
boisterous in the Italian part of the Riviera than in Provence.
April and May are delightful months for those who require out-door
life in a warm climate.

The wildness of the climate of the Riviera requires, perhaps, no
better proof than its rich southern vegetation. The Olive, which is
already found in the neighbourhood of the N. Italian lakes, here
attains its full growth, while the Eucalyptus globulus (which grows
rapidly and to an astonishing height), the Orange, the Lemon, and
several varieties of Palms also flourish.

The geological character of the Riviera is also of sanitary signi-
il0anett. The prevailing formation is limestone, which absorbs the
. sunâ€™s rays with remarkable rapidity and radiates it with equal speed,
thug forming an important factor in making the most of the winter
sunshine. On account of its softness it is also extensively used
for road-making, and causes the notorious dust of the Riviera, which
forms the chief objection to a region frequented by so many Iyer-
sons with weak lungs. The authorities of the various health-re-ts,
however, take great pains to mitigate this evil " far as practicable.
After heavy rain the roads are apt to be very muddy.

The advantages that a winter-residence in the Riviera, in contra-
distinction to the climate of northern Europe, offers to intalids and
delicate persons, are a considerably warmer and generally dry at-
mosphere, seldom disturbed by storms, yet fresh and pure, 9. more
