which originally had their root in one and the same impulse or
principle. The ancient convent of Bant' Apollonia (p. 497) contains
the most important works of ANDREA DBL CASTAGNO (1390-1457),
who is second only to Masaccio as a representative ot the older
generation. In the Dominican monastery of San Marco reigns the pious
and peaceful genius of En GIOVANNI Anenmco DA Fmsom: (1387-
1455), who, though inferior to his contemporaries in dramatic power,
vies with the best of them in his depth of sentiment and his sense of
beauty, as tsxiresusil more particularly by his heads, and who in
his old age displayed his well-matured art in the frescoes of the
chapel of St. Nicholas in the Vatican. Most important and extensive

works are those of DonBNIeo GHIRLANDAJO fidl9--M)t oth.

grace of representation are hardly surpassed by any other work of
the same period. (The traveller will find it very instructive to
compare the former of these works with the mural paintings of
Giotto in Santa Croce, which also represent the legend of St. Francis,
and to draw a parallel between i1hirlandN'o's Last Supper in the

. Although the Tuscan painters exhibit their art to its fullest
extent in their mural paintings, their essel-pictures are also well
worthy of most careful examination; for it was ehiefly through these
that they gradually attained to perfection in imparting beauty and
dignity to the human form. Besides the two great Florentine galleries
(tittizi and Pitti), the collection of the Academy (p. 492) is also well
calculated to afford a survey of the progress of Florentine painting.

the character and development of Renaissance painting in Central
Italy. Those who cannot conveniently visit the provincial towns
will find severel of the principal masters of the 15th century united

in the mural paintings of the Sistine Chapel at Rome, where SANDRO
BOTTIOELLI (1446-1510), a pupil of the elder Lippi, Cosmo ROSSBLLI,
DornA1hir1andN'o, Signorelli, and Perugino (p. liii) have executed a.
number of rich compositions from the life of Moses and that of Christ.
