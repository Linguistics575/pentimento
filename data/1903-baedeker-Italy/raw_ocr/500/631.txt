440 Jtoute 68. FLORENCE. History.

government of the town was carried on try the nobles (Grandi) through
four (afterwards six) consuls, assisted by a. council of 100 Buonuonim‘.
From 1207 onwards the judicial functions were entrusted to the Podutix,
a. foreign nobleman of legal erudition elected for a period of six months,
afterwards increased to a year. The Florentinea maintained their pristine
simplicity and virtue longer than was usual in Italian cities. The nobles,
however, lived in bitter feuds with each other, end after the assassination
of Buondelmonte on the Ponte Vecchio in 1211') were divided between the
two hostile camps of the Guelphs and the Ghihelliuu. Under the Emperor
Frederick II. the Ghibellines enjoyed a. brief period of supremecy, but on
his death in 1250 the Guelphs secured the upper hand. As in consequence
of these tumfliets the sway of the nobility proved detrimental to the ia.
terests of the city, the people in 1250 organised a kind of national guard
of their own, commanded by a. ‘Capiteno del Popolo', who was assisted by
a council of 12 'Ancients' CAnm'anr) and 36 'Corpofals' (Caporah'). About
the same time (1252) was firM coined the golden Florin, which soon became a
general standard of value, and marks the leading position taken by Flerence
in the commerce of Europe. The guilds of the wool-weavers and cloth-
makers maintained agents in Venice, Paris, Bruges, and London; Floren-
tine bankers had a hand in the commerce of every nation, and, more
especially, exercised almost exclusive control over the money-merketof
France. The continuous feuds of the nobles brought the republic into
collisiOn with other Tuscan towns, of which Siene and Pisa were con-
spicuous pertizens of the Ghibellines. In 1260 the Florentines tsuffered I
crushing defeat on the Arbia, near Monteperti, which cost the Guelph
their supremacy in the city. The Ghibelline grendeee proposed to rue
Florence to the ground and to transfer the seat of government to Empoh',
but the plan was sueeestsfully opposed by the noble Farinata degli Uberti.

On the death of Manfred of Hohenstaufen at the battle of Benevento
in 1266, the Guelphs regained their power, and in 1207 they elected Charla
g AR/ou as Signor for ten years. This election placed foreign princes in
t e same position with regard to the republic as had been held by the
emperors, and their representatives now shared the government with the
municipal authorities, which ever since the middle of the 13th cent. had
included the presidents of the seven greater Arts, or guilds (Lawyers and
Notaries, clorh-)1eahsrs, Meney-chaugers, Wool-weavers, Silk-workers,
Physicians and Apotllecriries, and Furriers). Fourteen lesser guilds were
afterwards formed. In 1232 the guilds arrogated to themselves the Supreme
power, and entrusted the government to a Signom'a formed of their pre-
sidents or Priori (afterwards restricted to eight, elected for two months).
The nobility were kept in check by the 'Ordimunenti della aiustiaia', a
series of strict regulations due to Giana delta Bella (1293), which were y.1-
ministered by a Gun alom'ere della thtatieia, supported by a civic militia
of 1000 (afterwards 000) men. The civic banner bore a red cross upon a
white ground. After 1800 the Goufaloniere delle Giustizia became the
president of the Priori, with whom were now associated the sixteen Gon-
falonieri of the militia, the Capitano del Popolo, end (after 1312) twelve
magistrates known as Buonuomini. The legislative proposals of the body
thus constituted were submitted to three councils: the Comtigiio dd Popolos
elected at first exclusively from the more prosperous citizens (the 'popolp
graseo’), the Contiguo delta Credenza, on which the guild-oNeials sat, 313d
the Consiglt'o del Podettit. Finally they were considered by a. General Causal,
formed of the three separate councils. Offices were held but for a short
term, in order that as many citizens as possible might enjoy them, bat if
any one were 'admonished' for a crime, he became ineligible for oftioe.
Advantage of this was frequently taken by the party holding the upper
hand to exclude their opponents from power; and the steady development
of constitutional government was interrupted also by the custom of em
trusting from time to time, at the request of the Signoria, a. committee of
citizens with the full power (Balia) of altering the laws.

At the beginning of the 14th cent., new party-etruggles among the
nobles bum fyth, under the new names of the Whites and the Blacks; tly.
Guelphs (Nen) were eventually victorious, and many of the Binntthi
