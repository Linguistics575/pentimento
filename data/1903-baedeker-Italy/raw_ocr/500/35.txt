The larger Churches are open in the moniingtill 12, and generally
again from 2, 3, or 4 to 7 p.m., while the most important are often
open the whole day. Many of the smaller churches are open only
till 8 or 9 a..m. Visitors may inspect the works of art even during
divine service, provided they move about noiselesely, and keep
aloof from the altar where the clergy are offieiating. On the occasion
of festivals and for a week or two before Easter the works of art
are often entirely concealed by the temporary decorations. Those
always covered are shown by the verger (sagrcuano), who expects
30-50 c. from a single traveller, more from a party o. xv).

Artists, archaeologists, and scholars, on making application to the
Ministry of Education on a stamped form (1 fr. '20 e.), receive free tickets
(tcssera di libero ingreuo), valid all over the country. For a single town
the application is made to the Director of the Gallery (stamp 60 c.). The
application must be accompanied by an unmounted photograph and by a
eertifleate from a university or some similar body, countersigned by an
Italian consul in the tspplictutt'g country.

Theatrel. Performances begin at 8, 8.30, or 9, and terminate at mid-
night or later. In the large theatres, in which the season (stagione)
frequently lasts only from St. Btephen's Day (Dec. 26th) to the end
of the Carnival, operas and ballets are exclusively performed. The
first act of an opera is usually succeeded by a ballet of three acts
er more. The pit (platEa), to which the 'higlietto d'ingresto' gives
access, has standing-room only; for seats additional tickets must
be taken (usually in advance in the larger towns). A boacfpaleo di
prime, secondo, term ordine), which must always be secured in ad-
vance, is the pleasantest place for ladies or for a party of several
persons. Evening dress is generally worn in the boxes. Other re-
served seats are the poltrone (front stalls) and the posti distinti or ecdit
(rear stalls). In some of the larger theatres good seats may be otrd
tained in the anfteatro or prima galleria. The theatre is the mma!
