one of the founder: of Renaissance sculpture. A litle later the moat pro-
minent sculptors were Southern Itnliene: Niccolo detp Area (d. 1494), of Bart,

In the province of Pummo we are struck by Bologna'' close connec-
tion with the School of Ferraro, due robably to the dearth of impar-
tent native masters (comp. p. 356). The rat Bologneee master who attained
more than a local reputation wee Francesco Francia (1450-1517), the gold-
smith, who owed much to Lorenzo Coats of Ferraro. In the devotion and
gracefnlness of his female figures he almost rivals Perngino, as well as In
