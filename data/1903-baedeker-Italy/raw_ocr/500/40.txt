cheerful sky, and comparative immunity from rain. The 'invalid'g
dayâ€™, or the time during which invalids may remain in the open
air with impunity, lasts here from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The general
effect of a prolonged course of open-air life in the Riviera may be
described as a gentle stimulation of the entire physical organism.
It is found particularly benei10ial for oonvalesoents, the debilitated,
md the aged; for children of scrofulous tendency; and for the mar-
tyrs of gout and rheumatism. The climatic cure of the Riviera is
also often prescribed to patients with weak cheats, to assist in the
removal of the after-effeots of inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy,
or to obviate the danger of the formation of a chronic pulmonary
discharge. .The dry and frequently-agitated Mr of the Riviera is,
however, by no means suitable for every patient of this kind, and
the immediate vicinity of the sea is particularly unfavourable to
cases of a feverish or nervous character. The stimulating effects of
the climate are then often too powerful, producing sleeplessness
end unwholesome irritation. The dry air of the Riviera di Ponente
is dso prejudicial to many forms of inflammation of the wind-pipe
and bronchial tubes, which derive benefit from the Mr of Nervi,
Pisa, or Ajacoio. Cases of protracted nephritis or diabetes, on the
contrary, often obtain considerable relief from a residence here.

The season on the Ligurian coast lasts from about the begin-
ning of October to the middle of May. In September It is still too
hot, and in March it is so windy that many patients are obliged to
retire farther inland. Many invalids make the mistake of leaving
the Riviera too soon, and thus lose all the progress they have made
during the winter, through reaching home in the unfavourable trans-
ition period between winter and spring. It is better to spend April
and May at some intermediate station, such as Panama, Cannero,
Locamo, Lugano, or Gardone Riviera.

Good opportunities for 'ma-bathing are offered at many points
on the Mediterranean coast of N. Italy t such as Alaoio, Savona,
chli, Spezia, Viarcggio, Leghorn, and Venice. The Mediterranean is
almost tideless; it contains about 41 per cent of common salt, a tron-.
siderably higher proportion than the Atlantic; its average tempera-
tare during the bathing-season is 'rio Fahr. The bathing-tmuon
on the Ligurian coast begins in April, or at latest in May, and lasts
till November, being thus much longer than the season at any English
'tasia-resort.

Most travellers must in some degree alter their mode of living
whilst in Italy, without however implicitly adopting the Italian style.
Inhabitants of more northern countries generally become unusually
susceptible to cold in Italy, and therefore should not omit to be well
supplied with warm clothing for the winter. Woollen underclothiug is
especially to be recommended. A cloak or shawl should he carried to
neutralise the often considerable dimmmee of temperature between the
Sunshine and the shade. In visiting picture-galleries or churches on
