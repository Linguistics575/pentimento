Viarcggio (13 ft.), founded by Lucca in 1171, is a quiet country-
town (17,2401nhab.), with regular and monotonous streets, situated
in a. spacious and somewhat marshy plain on the sea, about 3 M.
to the 8.13. of the Monti della Versilia, Spurs of the Alpi Apuane.
Its excellent sandy beach attracts numerous sea-bathers (especially
from Tuscany) in July and Aug., and in winter, in spite of its
want of protection against the. wind, it is occasionally visited as a
winter-station.

From the railwey-statton a road leads to the W. direct to the
beach, crossing the Ponte a Pisa, skirting the Fosso Burlamaeea
