bar“, the son of Lorenzo (1452-62); above is the Beheeding of John the Bap-
tist it Vine. Danti, 1571.

e Sscoun Doon (NJ wee executed in 1403-24 by Lorenzo Ghiberu,
after e competition in which his designs were preferred to those of Jecopo
dens. Quereie Niccolo d'Aresao, and Brunelleschi (comp. p. 474). Dona-
tello and Michelozzo were among his assistants in makin the castings.
The reliefs represent in 28 sections the history of Christ. hey are quite
eqnel to those of Andree Piano in eiesrness of arrangement, nobility of
outline, and tenderness of conception, while they surpass them in richness
of picturesque life and in the harmony and variety of movement and ex-
pression in the individual ftgures. The technical execution is simply
perfect. The fhturts of St. John the Evangelist is the grandest in the
series. Above the door, the 'Pretushing of St. John by Fr. Rmtict, 1511
(supposed to have been assisted by Leonardo de Vinci).

The ‘Tamn Doon, facing the cathedral, also executed by Lorenzo Ghi-
berti (1425-52). is considered e marvel of art. It represents ten ditferent
scenes from Scripture history: (L) 1. Creation and Expulsion from Para-
dise; (r.) 2. Cain slaying his brother and Adam tiliing the earth; 3.
Noah after the Flood, and his intoxication; t. Abraham and the angels,
and Sacrifice of Issac; D. Esau and Jacob; 8. Joseph and his brethren; 7.
Promulgation of the Law on Mt. Sinai; 8. The Walls of Jericho; 9. Battle
against the Ammonites; 10. The Queen of Sheba. The ertist hes here
wittingly trensgressed the limits of the plastic art and produced what
may be celled e picture in bronze, but he hes notwithstanding shed such
a flood of loveliness over his creation that Michael Angelo pronounced
this door worthy of forming the entrance to Paradise. The beautiful
bronze borders are also by Ghibcrti, who has introduced his own portrait
in the central bend (the men with the held head, to the left, fourth from
the top). Over the door the ‘Beptism of Christ, by Andrea Samovino, 1502
(com ieted by Vina. Dant0, the angel by Spinaui (18th cent.).

’IPhe whole arrangement of the *Interior shows that its builder was
well acquainted with ancient forms, and suggests the inflattnee of the
Pantheon at Rome. In front of each of the eight niches below stand two
columns of Oriental granite with gilded capitals. Above is e gallery with
Corinthian pilesters and double windows. The boldly soaring dome, 90 ft.
in diameter, afforded Bruntslitutehi a model for that of the cathedral (p. 452).
The choir-niche is adorned with mosaics by Fra Jacopo (1225-28), a com-
panion of St. Francis of Assisi, and the dome with others by Andrea 2'ayt
(d. after 1320), Apottom'o Grew, and others. The mosaics, which are not
distinguishable except on very bright days, have been frequently restored.
The organ is a work of the celebrated musician, Ant. thruaret'atupt' (1476).
On the pavement are an early niello, with the zodiac end inscriptions,
and mosaics with ornaments (1200). The font is enriched with Pisen reliefs
of 1871. To the right of the high-elter is the tomb (frequently imitated)
of Pope John XXIII. (d. 1419), who was deposed by the Council of Con-
stance, erected by Cosimo dd' Medici; the recumbent bronze statue by
Donateuo, the Bgures of the three Virtues by Nichelouo. On an alter to
the left of Andrea Pisano‘s door is e stetue of Mary Magdalen in wood, by
Donatello, unpleasantly realistic In tttrttttt.

Opposite the N. side of the Baptistery is a column of speckled
marble (eipollino), called the Colonna di San Zanobi, erected to
commemorate the removal of the relies of St. Zenobius in 1330.
- To the W. of the Baptistery, at the corner of the Via de’ Cerretani
tp. 497), is the Pal. Areioeaeovile (P1. E, 4) or palace of the arch-
bishop, with a fine court by G. A. Dosio (1573). At the back, to-
wards the Piazza dell' Olio, is the early Tuscan facade of the small
church of San Salvatore.
