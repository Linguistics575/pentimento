IV. SALOON, originally a chapel, afterwards (from about 1630)
a prison for those condemned to death, adorned with sadly damaged
frescoes, ascribed to Giotto, but perhaps executed after the tire in
1337 by his pupils (restored after 1840).

(p. 225). - The SIDE Roms, to the right, contains tine specimens
of weaving and embroidery and handsome ecclesiastical vestments
(Carrand Collection).

Y. SALOON. In front are some beautiful shields and weapons,
bequeathed by C. Ressmann (1900), the statesman. The two central
cases contain carvings in ivory. In the first are two triptychs by
Baldassare degli Embriarchi (p.145); leaf of a consular triptych of
Basilius (541); bishop’s staff (14th cent); statuette of the Madonm
(Florentine; 15th cent); Byzantine casket (12th cent). By the
second window, to the right, two ivory saddles of the 14th century.
The goldsmith's work and works in amber may also be noticed.. (The
door to the left in this saloon leads to the second floor, see p. 475.)

Yr. SALOON (and the VII.): Bronzes. Entrance-wall: 21. Re-
liquary of M. Protus, Hyacinthus , and Nemesius, by Lor. Ghiberii
(1428); 20. Bertoldo, Ancient battle-scene in relief. In the case:
Herculesend Antams by Ant. Pollajuolo (below, to the left); Dona-
tello, Cupid (middle row); imitations of antique and Renaissance
'statuettes. - Exit-wall: *i2, 13. Abraham’s Baerifioe by Lor. thii..
berti, and the same by Fil. Bruneueeehi, the earliest Renaissance
sculptures, produced in their competition for the execution of the
gates of the Baptistery (p. 451). The composition of Ghiberti is
the less harmonious but the calmer of the two. Its dignified draped
ilgr1rets, especially that of Isaac, are full of a true antique feeling
for beauty, while in Brunelleschi’s relief the principal flgurets are
represented in violent movement, and Isaac is besides remarkably
ugly. The subordinate ilguretr, including the ram, are also in posi-
tions of ovtT-titrain.tsd activity. In technical execution Ghiberti is
superior. 14, 15. CJrueitixion (relief) and a small Frieze of children
