of ancient sculpture and modern painting. Thehall was constructed
by Bernardo Buontalenti ; the decorations are by Bernardino Poccetti.
In the centre are placed five celebrated marble sculptures: Matt,
playing on the cymbal and pressing the scabellum or krupesion with
his foot; the admirable head and the arms were restored by Michad
Angelo (?). *Group of the Wrestlers,- the heads, which resemble
those of the Children of Niobe, do not belong-to the figures, and
the greater part of the legs and arms is modern; the right arm of
the victor is erroneously restored. *Medici Venus, found at Rome
in the 16th cent., and brought to Florence in 1680; the affected]:
held flngtsris and the inscription on the base are modern. The
*Grinder, a Scythian whetting his knife to f1ay Marsyas, found ti
Rome in the 16th cent. (from the same group as the Marsyas.
No. 156, mentioned on p. Mi). The "Apollino, or young Apollo
(freely restored).

PAINTINGS. To the right of the entrance: “1129. Raphael, Mr
donna and Child with the golMmsh ('earde11ino'), painted in Florence
about 1507, pieced together again after a flre in 1548.

The 'Madonna del Ctsrde11ino', the ‘Medonne Bl Verde‘ at Vienna.
and 'La belle Jardiniére‘ in the Louvre form a group nearly allied ia
Ihigt, of conception. To the earlier and simpler representations of the

adonne, in which Mary and her Son alone appear, the child John the
Baptist has been added. This not only admits of the delineation ot M.
ditional features of child-lite, but also makes possible the construction
of a regularly-arranged group. The two children, standing at the feet of
the Madonna, form a broad base for the composition, which tapers np-
wards easily and naturally to the head of the Virgin. This arrangement l
Brtrt found ex ression within the realms of sculpture, whence it "
eagerly adopte by the Florentine painters. - Springer.

'Not after the model of a Phryne, nor yet with the thought of rel:
izing anything more sublime than woman in her fairest aspect,
Titian conceive this picture. Nature as he presents it here is you: ot
