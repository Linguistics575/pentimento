attitude and motion. Yet this constraint is not perceptible, and the history
of the statue could by no means he divined from its appearance. Out.
wardly the demeanour of the young hero is composed and quiet; but
each limb is animated by a common impulse from within and the whole
.body is braced up for one action. The raised left arm rai; the sling in
readiness, the right hand hanging at his side holds the handle of the
sling; next instant he will make the attaek'. - Springer.
