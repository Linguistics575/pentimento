Ravcnna (13 ft.), formerly the capital of a province, now largely
deserted, with 63,364 inhsb., is situated in the' plain between the
rivers Lemons and Rance (the Roman Bedais), in a somewhat un-
healthy district. It was originally a town on the Lagune and a see-
port, like Venice, but is now 6 M. distant from the sea and is con-
nected with Porto Corsini, its foreport (founded in 1736), by the
Canals Corsini only, a narrow channel, beginning " the small new

harbour Opposite the station (Dars‘éna; Pl. G, 3, 4).

Revenue, one of the most ancient towns in Italy, probably owes its
earliest importauee to the invasion of Italy by the Celts, when the Um-
briena and Etruscens mstsing from the mainland to the Legune, settled
here. It was en eeriy ally of the Romans, but as e punishment for
espousing the eeuse of Marius it was ineorporated with Gsllia Giselpina,
and sank to the level of a provincial town. Augustus was the tlrat to
recognize the advantageous situation of Bevenne. He enlerged the Perms
Chuiia till it could accommodate 260 sail, and appointed it the head-
quarters of the Adriatic fleets, an ersenel and large tship-building yards
were established in the new town of Glass“, which rapidly extended,
while the industrial suburb of Caesarea sprang up on the Wa Gaesarea,
the road uniting» the two towns. When the lagoon began to be Blied up
by the deposits of the rivers. Revenue and Classis were both surro'unded
by walls. The situation of Revenue was, however, still regarded as so
impregnable that in 402, amid the dangers of the barbarian invasion, the
Emp. Honorius transferred his residence thither from Rome. In the reign
of his sister Gaua Haddia (d. MO , widow of the Visigothic king Athaulf
(d. 415) and Constantine III. (d. t i), and mother of Valentinian m., the
brilliant imperial city was erected into an 'srtshiePitNoptil see. According
to the legend, Christianity had been introduced in M A.D., by St. Apolli-
saris, a disciple of St. Peter. After the fall of the Western Empire the
town was taken by the Herulisn Odoaoer, King of Italy, and again in
493 by f'heodorO the Great tit. 526), King of the Ostrogoths, after which
it regained much of its former splendour end was the residence of the
Gothic kings till 539. It then became the sent of the exerch or governor
of the Eastern Roman or Greek Emperors, but in spite of the numerous
privileges lavished on its church by Justinian and his successors, it fell
rapidly into decay. The Lombards used the town of Classis to the ground,
and in 751 their duke Ammph banished Eutychius, the last exerch, and
took possession of Revenue. Shortly afterwards, however, it was retaken
by Pepin, Ring of the Franks, and handed over to the pope, along with
the whole of the former exarehate (755). The papal rule was at Brst
entirely nominal, for the archbishop, who assumed the title of exarchs,
also succeeded in making themselves masters of a great part of the
Romagna. At a. later period Revenue was usually to be found on the side
of the German emperors. In 1297 the Ghibelline Polenta family, of whom
favourable mention is made by Dante, obtained the supreme power, and
in 1318 they added also the title of duke. In 1441 Revenue came into
possession of the Venetiens, under whom its prosperity materially increased;
111 1508 it was conquered by Pope Julius 11.; and in 1512, after the battle
of Revenue. (p. 395), it was plundered by the victorious French army and
