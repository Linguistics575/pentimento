Genoa, Italian thmlfva, French t2tnee, with 219,500 inhab. , the
seat of a university and of an archbishop, and the headquarters of
the 4th Italian army corps, is a strong fortress and the chief oom-
mereiel town in Italy. Its situation, rising above the sea in a wide
semicircle, and its numerous palaces j ustly entitle it to the epithet
of 'La Buperha'. The old town is a. net-work of narrow and steep
streets, lined with many-storied buildings, but the newer quarters
have broad and straight thoroughfares. Since the 17th cent. Genoa
has been protected on the landward side by a rampart, over 9 M.
long, which extends from the large lighthouse on the W. side (p. 82),
where the barracks of San Benigno afford quarters for 10,000 men,
past the Forte Begato (1620 ft.), to the Forte dello Sperone (i690 ft.);
then descends past Forte Castelluccio (1250 ft.; view) into the valley
of the Bisagno, on the E. The heights around the town are crowned
with ten detached forts.

The beau.ty of its situation and the reminiscences of its aneieni
glory render a visit to Genoa very attractive. Invalids , however,
must be on their guard in winter against the raw winds and the
abrupt changes of temperature. .

From the earliest times Genoa has been famous as e seaport, and t;
is believed to derive its name from the fact that the shape of the com

government was maintained throughout the period of the barbarian ini
Vasions, when a. Frankish feudal nobility sprang up alongside of the natiw
nobleese. The smaller towns on the Ligurian coast looked up to Geno:
as their champion against the Saracens, who ravaged the countr fron
Frassineto (Fraxinet), and in 936 even plundered Genoa itself. In 1199
the Genoese waged war with varying success against Pisa, which threatena
its maritime commerce from the settlements on Corsica and Sardinia. I:

and Vmctians was a fruitful source of wars and feuds, which were nc
