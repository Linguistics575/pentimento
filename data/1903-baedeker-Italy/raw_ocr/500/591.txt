ment and great dramatic force. Arnot o dt Gambia (1232-1301), pupil of
Niccolo Pisano, and Andrea Pisano (1 731848), pupil of Giovanni, form'
links between the art of Pisa and that of Florence.' Pisa elso boasted of
possessing Psrmsns at an early period. The name of Gdunta Pisano (limt
half of the -13th cent). for example, was known fer beyond the limits of
"the town, but his works are uninteresting, except to the student of art.
The fact that Gmabue was invited from Florence to embellish the spec of
the cathedral, indicates the decline of native art, the development of
which appears to have ceased entirely in the 14th eentury. The'exeention
of the frescoes in the Campo Sento was committed partly to foreign artists,
not indeed to Giotto himself, as Vasari asserts, but to his pupils and to
S. Tuscan masters. Budratmaeeo, the jester among the Italian painters,
who is not a merely mythical personage, as has been sup osed, is said
to have assisted in executing the frescoes in the Campo ante. but to
what extent is unknown. In the 15th cent. Benozzo Gouoli (1mm) of
Florence, a pupil of Fre Angelica, spent 16 years at Pisa, where the
Campo Santo is graced by one of his most important works (p. 409).
The busiest part of the town and chief resort of visitors is the
Lungarno, a series of broad and handsome quays, and particularly
the sheltered Lungamo Regio (P1. C, D, o, on the N. side of the
river. Churches and buildings in the Lungarno, see pp. 413, Mk.
- The river is crossed by four bridges. That in the centre is the
old Ponte di Mezzo (Pl. D, E, A); above it is the Ponte alla Forum
(P1. F, 5); below it is the Ponte Solferino (P1. B, C, 5), completed
in 1875, while outside the town is the Ponte di Perro (PL A, B, 6).

The chief boast of Pisa is the "sz11 DBL Duouo (Pl. B, l),
to which every visitor firgt directs his steps. The Cathedral, the
Leaning Tourer, the Baptistcry, and the Campo Santa form a group of
buildings without parallel, especially as it lies beyond the precincts
of the town and therefore removed from its disturbing influeneeg,

The “Cathedral, erected after the great naval victory of the Pie
ens near Palermo (1063) by Busketus and Rainaldus in the Tuscan-
Romanesque style, and consecrated by Pope Gelssius II. in 1118,
was restored in 1597-1604 after a fire in 1595 which seriously dam-
aged the nave. It is a basilica with nave and double aisles, and transept
flanked with aisles, 104 yds. in length, and 351/2 yds. in breadth in the
Interior, and covered with an elliptical dome over the crossing. This
remarkably perfect tsdiiiee is constructed entirely of white marble,
ornamented with black and coloured bands. The most magnificent
part is the “Facade, which in the lower story is adorned with columns
and arches attached to the wall, and in the upper parts with four
open galleries, gradually diminishing in length. It was imitated at
Lucca, Pistoja, and other neighbouring cities. The ancient Bronze
Gates, destroyed in the fire of 1595, were replaced in 1606 by the
present doors, with representations of Scriptural subjects, executed
by Giov. Caeefni, Pietro Franeavilla, Pietro Tacca, and others. The
only one of the old doors now existing, by Bonamms of Pisa (1180):
representing (td scenes from Scripture history, is in the Crocicra di
Ban Ranieri, or S. transept. The choir is also imposing. By tlit

principal facade is the sarcophagus of Busketus (see above), with a
curious inscription.
