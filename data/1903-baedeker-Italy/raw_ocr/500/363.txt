The history of the country has always been influenced by the proxirttitr
of the sea and the peculiar formation of the coast. In the lower part of
its course the Po ditferg widely in character from all the other rivers in
Europe. Its fall is very gradual, being for a considerable distance 21/:
inches only, and latterly little more than 1/. inch per English mile. Thy.
Wards the end of its course, moreover, it receives its moat important
tributaries. The result is that the adjacent districts are much exposed to
inundations, a danger which has to be averted by the construction of huge
dykes-, and these works frequently require to be raised, as the bed of the
river is constantly rising. The Po, together with the Tagliame-nto, Livenza,
Piano, Brenta, Adige, and other coast-rivers, terminates in avast delta which
extends along the whole coast of Venetia. The quantity of alluvial depotsit
is so great, that the goagt-i1iatriet between Tagliamento and Revenue alone
was increased try about 295 sq. M. in the course of thed9th century. From
the same cause the beds of the streams are continually undergoing change
and subdivision. Thus the ancient seaport of Bahia now lies 151/: M. hon
the coast, and while the Po formerly flowed towards the B., it has formed
its present embouchure since 1160. The extensive lagoons (lacuna), sep-
arated from the sea. by narrow strips of land (lidi), and connected with it
by outlets, would render the whole coast uninhabitable in summer, were
it not for the ebb and flow of the tide, which distinguishes the Adriatic from
other parts of the Mediterranean (comp. p. 270), and prevents malarious
exhalations. This extensive alluvial territory, which reminds one of
Holland, called into activity the ingenuity and enterprise of its inhabits“!
at an early period and a temperate and conservative character has ihltt
been imparted to their" history.

The Fentti, a branch of the Illyrian stock, kept entirely ont
from the immigrating Celtic tribes. The seaports of Hatrt'a and 8pm:
at the months of the Po, carried on a considerable trade at an early
period, and several canals on a let e scale were eonatrueted as early
as B. C. 380. In the 3rd cent. the eneti, together with the Genomani,
a Celtic tribe which occupied Brescia and Verona, entered into "
alliance with Rome. While the Romanisation of Lombardy and Pied-
mont was attended with violent struggles, it was rapidly eCeeted here,
without .ot.r",elin; The Roman colony of Aquileia was founded as etrrly)
as 181 B. " and the boundary of Italy was thus laid down at the poitit,
to which it still extends. Owing to its industries, eutle-breeding, and
agriculture, Venetia prospered greatly under the emperors. Padua -
the wealthiest town in Italy next to Rome, and was rivalled in W. Eu-t
r0pe by Cadiz alone, as it numbered during the reign of Augustus no
fewer than 500 citizens of knightly fortune (i. e. upwards of about 't'lild)'.)
The city was afterwards destroyed by Attila, and a similar fate befel;
Altinum, a prosperous commercial town in the Lagoons, and 1tfl',t)
which in ancient times was of a similar importance to the modern Trieste.
The inhabitants of these coast-towns sought refuge from their conquerors
in the islands of the Lagoons, where they founded Heraclea, Grada (Aquila?!
Nova), Gaorle, Torcello, Burano, Murano 2falamoeco, Pellestn'na, . '
and other places. The Lombard, (p. 116) were repulsed with aid cm
the Byzantine emperors; but in the following century the necessity oi B
closer union for mutual support led to the establishment of a confedergk
state. In 697 Pauluct'uc Anafestue (d. 716) was elected the flrgt Dua or Ditgt
of this naval anion, while Heraclea was chosen as the seat of government.
In 707, however, the latter was transferred to Halamocca. Removed from
Teutonic tnt1muieetr, and under the protection of the Byzantine Empire,
the most famous of mediaaval states took its rise here from a arently in-
trttpdtlcant beginnings. In 809 the islands repulsed an attack Ji?rdfil Pepin,
the son of Charlemagne, but on the capture of Malamocco the inhabitants
were crowded together in the islands of Rteoalto and Torullo.
