To the S.W. of the Museo Civico is the church of San Giacomo

San Simeon: Piccolo, Gli Scalsi, and the station, see p. 297.

The direct route from the Rialto to the Frari leads past San
Giovanni Elemosinario (p. 308) through the RUGA DI SAN GIOVANIU
(Pl. F, 4), and crosses the Campo 8ant' Aponal. Over the door of
the church of that name (Venetian for S. Apollinarc) is a marble
group of General Vitt. Cappello (d. 1467) kneeling before the Tir-
gin, by Ant. Rizzi (1480). Near this church is the Pal. Albrissi
(tlms tstueeo-embe1lishmenti, in the interior, by A1. Vittoria) and
beyond it the Csuro SAN POLO (Pl. E, F, d; on the neighbouring
Rio di S. Polo is the Pal. Comer-Moccnigo, with a good facade by
Sanmicheli). - Passing between the church of San Polo and its
campanile (14th cent.), we cross the Rio S. Polo and proceed in
a straight direction to the Rioterrh dei Nomboli. Here we turn to
the left, and, where it bends, follow the narrow side-street to the
right, finally crossing a canal and reaching the CAMPO SAN Toni
(PL E, 6), with the church of that name, a little to the N. of the
tsteamboat-station mentioned at p. 261. In this square lies the old
Scoom mu CALEGHBRI ('cotsttleris' Guild’), founded in the 16th
cent. and the only building of the kind in Venice that has kept
its exterior unaltered. Over the portal is a relief of St. Mark healing
the cobbler Animus by Pietro Lombardo (1479), remarkable for
its well-preserved colouring. - A few paces to the N.W. lies the
former church of the Franciscans, or the -

“Frari (Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Pl. E 5; comp. p. 265),
a cruciform Gothic church, one of the largest and most beautiful at
Venice, erected in 1330-1417 on the site of a building of 1250. Its
