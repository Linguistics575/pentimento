We now return to the Rio San Felice and turn to the SE. into
the Rio di S. Caterina. The high-altar-pits of the church of SANTA
CATERINA here (PLG, 3; if closed, entrance to the right, through the
Lyceum, Gonvitto Nazionale), ie a "Marriage of St. Catherine, by
Paolo Verona”, a masterpiece and in admirable preservation. At
the end of the right aisle is a Tobias with the angel, by Grazia Vccctli.

We proceed to the E. to the Ponte dei Gesuiti, and turning to
the left reach the church of -

‘Santa. Maria dei Gemiti (P1. G, H, 3), usually known as
Ir Gewiti’, erected in 1715-30 in the baroque style by Dom. Rossi
[facade by thoo. Fattoretto). The interior is entirely lined with
i marble inlaid with verde antieo, and sumptuouely decorated like all
the churches of this order.

At the HIGH ALTA]! (by Gim. Pozzo) are ten spiral columns of verde
‘antico; in the centre, a globe, with God the Father and the Son. The
chapel to the right of the high-altar contains the monument of Orezio
Ferneee (d. 1654); In the chapel on the left is the Monument of Doge
Pasquale Cicogne til. 1595), with the recumbent “Statue of the deceased,
by th Campagna; adjacent, in the SACBISTY, over the door, Presentation
in the Temple, by Tintoretto. Then, in the Len Tnenenr'r, the Assumption,
tan alter-piece by Tintoretto. In the Iet chapel on the left of the principal
door is the 1Eartyrilom'of St. Lawrence, one of the tinegt of the altar-
piecee by Titian (1668), who 'never made a nearer approach to the grand
art of the Florentinee than when he painted this piece, in which he
applied the principle of dramatic execution peculiar to Michaelengelo‘.
Unfortunately it is darkened by age (seen best about noon).

We may return from this point either along the Fondamenia
Nuove (Pl. G, 2; view of San Michele and Murano)-, or past Santi
Giovanni c Paolo to the Riva degli Schiavom' (comp. pp. 303-306),
or we may combine this trip with an excursion to Murano (steam-

boat, see p. 319).
