by the Venetian offhnu1t, (see his 'Italienisehe Reise’). The parish-
chureh contains a. Descent from the Cross by Girolemo dai Libri, a
richly coloured masterpiece (ist altar on the right). Beautiful road
hence to (16 M.) Gerda (see below).

Trimclone. The next stations are Assema, Magugnano, Ca8telletto
diBrmzone (P; Alb. del Sole), and Torri del Benaeo (P; Alb. Ca1-
cinardl), with an Imposing mined castle and large quarries of yellow
marble. The stretch between Torri and Gerda is the most beautiful
part of the E. bank. The banks become flatter. The promontory of
Tan Vigtlio (osterie) with the neglected Villa Brensoni, 21/4 M. to
the W. of Gerda, extends far into the lake. In the beautiful Bag
of Gerda, sheltered from the N. by Monte Bald o, lie the villas of
Marchese Carlotti and Count Albertini of Verona, both with fine
parks, with pine-trees. The picturesque old town of Gerda (P;
Btt, Gerda; Htrt.-pent. Sam Vigilio), at the influx of the Teeino,
which descends from Monte Baldo, gives the lake its neme.

About 21/. M. to the S.E. is the Rocca di Garda (964 ft.-, view), with a
mined castle. U on the wooded heights opposite are the hermitages of
Sant’ Eremo 101 no. - From Gerda to the Monte Baldo and Verona,

dolino (P; Alb. Bardolin? and Lazise (P),w1th a pieturtssque old castle.
