2. A steamer plies to SAN MICHELE, the cemetery island ( Cimctero),
and MUBANO, 11/2 M. to the N. of Venice, every 1/4 hr., starting
from the 1i'ondamenta Nuove (Pl. B, 3; fare 10 c.). On the former
island stands the church of S. Michele, built by Moro Goducei after
1466, and next to San Zaccarie (p. 301) the oldest Renaissance
building in Venice. To the left of the vestibule is the tasteful little
Cappella Emiliana, erected by Gugl. Bergamasco in 1534, with three
admirable reliefs in the style of Andrea Sansovino, and in the vesti-
bule Fra Paolo 8arpN Tomb (see Robertson’s 'Fra Paolo Sarpi’).
a. P. R. James (d. 1860), the novelist, Eugene Schuyler (d. 1890),
and Rawdon Brown are buried in the Protestant Cemetery.

Murano, a small island with 3600 inhab., has been, since the
14th cent., the seat of the Venetian Glass Industry, the followers
of which were held in so high esteem that Murano possessed its
own "hMerrBook' of descent, and minted its own coins. Its citizens
were eligible for the highest posts in the Republic, and after 1376
the children of a Venetian patrician and the daughter of a glass-
manufacturer were able to inherit their father's rank.

From the landing-plaee of the steamboat we proceed in a straight
direction and soon reach SAN PIBTRO MARTIRE, a simple and spacious
