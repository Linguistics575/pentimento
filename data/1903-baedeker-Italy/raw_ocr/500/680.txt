The VIA me' Menmm (P1. F, 4), beginning at the Beptietery,
and its continuation, the wide VIA CAvoun (Pl. F-B, 3, 2; formerly
Wa Largo), together form the most important thoroughfare in the
N. part of the city.

At the corner of the Via de' Martelli and the Via de' Geri rises
the church of Ban Giovannino degli Seolopi (t.e. of the Padrt delle
Scuole Pie; Pl. If, 4), erected in 1352, remodelled after 1579 by
B. Ammanati, completed in 1661 by Alfonso Parigi, and in the pos-

the Palazzo Pancidtichi (P1. F, 4), built about 1700 by Carlo Fontane,
with a relief of the Madonna by Deeid erio " Settignano at the comer.

The adjoining building on the left, which has been in possess-
ion of the government since 1814 and is now occupied by the
prefecture, is the old palace of the Medici, generally called
after its later owners the ‘Palazxo Ricoardi (P1. F, 3, 4). It was
erected about 1435 under Cosimo Pater Pattie by Mielietosso, who
here introduced the practice of tapering the rustice in the different
stories. The unsymmetrical facade is surmounted by a rich and
heavy cornice. Here Coeimo’e grandson Lorenzo il Magiduso was
born on J an. 1et,1449, and here he maintained his brilliant estab-
lishment. Lorenzo’s eons Piero, Giovanni, and Giuliano also first
saw the light within its walls. Giulio, Ippolito, Alessandro, and
Cosimo I. de' Medici (the last till 1540; comp. pp. 445, MO)
subsequently resided here, and the family continued in possession
of the palace until it was sold in 1659 by the (hand-Duke Ferdi-
nand II. to the Riccardi family, who extended it considerably to the
N. in 1714, enclosing within its precincts the Strada del Traditore,
where Duke Alessandro wee assassinated by Lorenzino de' Medici
