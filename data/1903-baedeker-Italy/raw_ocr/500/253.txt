140 Route 19. MILAN. d. Southern Quarters.

The Via. Carlo A1berto(P1. E, 5, 6), mentioned " p. 128, passes
a few paces to the E. of Sant' Alessandro. From it we turn to the
S.E. into the Grmso DI P0311 ROMANA (electric oar, see p. lid),
which leads to the .gate of that name. We follow this street as fat
as the church of San Nazaro (P1. F, 6, T), with the masterpiece
of Bernardino Eanini (15-16), a large fresco representing the *Mar-
tyrdom of St. Catharine, painted in imitation of the similar picture
in the Brera by Lanini's master Gaud. Ferrari (No. 107); a hand-
some carved Gothic altar; and ancient Swiss tstained-glass windows
to the right of the main entrance. A side-entrance admits to the
octagonal sepulchral chapel of the Trivulzi, built by Girolamo della
Porta (1519). - To the N.E., in the Via dell' Ospedale, is the -

*Ospedale Maggiore (P1. F, 6), a vast and remarkably fine brick

. structure , begun in the Renaissance style in 1456 by Antonio
Filarete of Florence, continued in the Gothic style by Guiniforte
Solari and other Lombard architects, and not completed by Ricchini
till after 1624. It contains no fewer than nine courts. The extensive
principal court, surrounded by arcades, ie by Ricchini (17th cent),
the court to the right of it is ascribed to Bramante. The ei11f1tas is
entirely covered externally with terracotta, in a style frequently
observed in other Milanese buildings, but its facade, with its rich
window-mouldings, is superior to any other structure of the kind at
Milan. In the chapel are two paintings by Francesco de Wea, con-
taining portraits of Francesco and Bianca Maria Sforza, the founders
of the hospital.

From the back of the hospital the Pia San Barnaba leads to the
Rotunda (Pl. H, ir, Open on Thurs. & Sun., Io-r, adm. tio 0.), built by
Arrigone and dedicated by the Viceroy Eugene Beauharnais in 1809 33 a
Pantheon Nazionale. It now contains a large collection of portraits of bene-
factors of the Ospedale Maggiore, from the 16th cent. to the present day. -
In the Via. Guastalla, the first cross-etreet of the Aria San Bernaba, is the
Synagogue (Pl. a, 6), by Luca Beltrami (1892).

A little to the N. of the Ospedale Maggioge is the Piazza Santa
Stefano, with the simple Renaissance church of that name (P1. F, 6).
- Hard by is the Piazza del Verziere (P1. F, G, 5), used as a "regtr-
table-market. We may now return to the W. by the Via Tenagiie
and the Piazza Fontane (Pl. F, 5) to the Piazza del Duomo, or We
may follow the Via Cesare Beecaria to the N. to the Palazzo di
Giustizia (Pl. F, 5), a baroque structure by Seregni, with a courtyard
of later date (1605); on the portal is a. tablet commemorating Silvio
Pelliee and the other Italian patriots committed by the Austrians
to the fortress of Spielberg in 1821 (comp. p. 43) Adjacent is
the Piazza Beeearia, with a statue of Beeearia (p. 123) by Grandi,
erected in 1871. - The Aria Cesare Beeearia ends on the N. at the
Corso Vittorio Emanuele.
