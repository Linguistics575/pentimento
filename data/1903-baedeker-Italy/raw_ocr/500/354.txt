Climate. Gerdoue is excellently sheltered from the prevalent winter
winds (N . and N.WO by the chain of hills rising from the MU. San Bartolo-
meo to the Mu. Pinocolo (see below) and interrupted only by the Barbarano
Ravine. A like service is rendered by the Mu. Baldo against the B. and
Ira. winds. The g. and S.E. winds have free access, but the Ora o. 211)
is not felt here and 88 per cent of the days of the year are free from wind.
The greatest rainfall takes place in Oct. (6.2 in.), Nov. (4.3 in.), and April
(3.8 in.), while the three winter months have usually little rein, abundence
of sunshine (129 hrs. in Dee., 1tl in. Jan., 165 in Feb.), a. relatively high
temperature (mean 89.IP Fahr.), and a. low range of temperature (mean
ditty range inahgs. 9'' Fahr., in Jan. iM'', in Feb. il/PO. Snow seldom
lite long on the ground. The relative humidity iN per cent) varies little
and is about the same as that of Montreux.

Gardone-Riviera, consisting of eight villages (Gardone di Sotto,
Gardonc dMopra, Fasano, etc.), has become since 1885 a favourite
srinter-retsqrt for consumptive and nervous invalids, while in the
spring and autumn it is frequented by those in search of rest and
refreshment. The visitors are ehiefly Germans. The hills afford a
multitude of varied walks, all free from dust and well provided
With benches. The vegetation is of a thoroughly southern character
(comp, p. 211); cemellias, magnolias, and palms grow in the gardens

unprotected.
