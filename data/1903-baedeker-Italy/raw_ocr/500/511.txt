1270, externally octagonal, with three round-arched portals, is
constructed of Veronese marble, and consists of five stories with
oolonnadtsts; the tltt roof is surmounted by seven pyramidal turrets
and by a belfry added in the 17th century. Around nearly the whole

Magi; then the History of John the Baptist; on the door-posta are genea-
logical trees of Jacob and of Jesse. - At the W. Portal, above, a curious
representation of the Last Judgment. On the door-poats to the left, Christ
performing works of mercy; on the right, the six ages of men. - On the
B. side is an Allegory of Death from the story of Barleam and Josephat.

master from the inscription on the N. portal.
