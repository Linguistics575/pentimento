ITALIAN ART. xxxvii

completed, the aim was obscure, the resources insufficient; mean-
while architecture alone gatigiled artistic requirements, the at-
tempts at painting and sculpture being barbarous in the ex-
treme; these, however, were the germs of the subsequent devel-
opment of art observable " early as the 11th and 12th centuries.
This has been aptly designated the Romanesque period (11th-
13th cent), and the then prevalent forms of art the Ito-
mesquo Style. As the Romance languages, notwithstanding
alterations, additions, and eorruptions, maintain their iilial rela-
tion to the language of the Romans, so Romanesque art, in
spite of its rude and barbarous aspect, reveals its immediate
descent from the art of that people. The Tuscan towns were the
principal scene of the prosecution of medieval art. There an in-
dustrial population gradually arose, treasures of commerce were
collected, independent views of life were acquired in active party
tsontlietts, loftier common interests became interwoven with those
of private life, and education entered a broader and more enlighto
ened track; and thus a taste for art also was awakened, and .
cathetic perception developed itself. When Italian architecture
of the Romanesque period is examined, the difference between its
character and that of contemporaneous northern works is at once
apparent. In the latter the principal aim is perfection in the
construction of vaulting. French, English, and German churches
are unquestionably the more organically conceived, the individual
parts are more inseparable and more appropriately arranged. But
the subordination of all other aims to that of the secure and ac-
onrate formation of the Vaulting does not admit of an unrestrained
manifestation of the sense of form. The columns are apt'to be
heavy, symmetry and harmony in the constituent members to be
disregarded. On Italian soil new architectural ideas are rarely
found, constructive boldness not being here the chief object; on the
other hand, the decorative arrangements are richer and more grate-
ful, the sense of rhythm and symmetry more pronounced. The cath-
ednl of Pisa or the church of San Miniato near Florence, both
founded as early as the 11th century, may be taken as an example
of this. The interior with its rows of columns, the mouldings
throughout, and the flat ceiling recall the baisiliea-type; while the
exterior, especially the facade destitute of tower, with the small
arcades one above the other, and the variegated colours of the courses
of stone, presents a f1ne decorative etttyet. At the same time the con-
struction and decoration of the walls already evince a taste for the
elegant proportions which we admire in later Italian structures;
the formation of the capitals, and the design of the outlines prove
that the precepts of antiquity were not entirely forgotten. A Iler
culiar conservative spirit pervades the medieval architecture of
Italy; artists do not aim " an unknown and remote object;
the ideal which they have in view, although perhaps instinctive:
