Pavia (250 ft.), with 33,922 inhab., capital of the province of
the same name, the see of a bishop, and the seat of a. university,
is situated near the ooni1uenee of the Ticino and the Po and is con-
nected with Milan by the Naviglio di Pavia (p. 115). Of the nu-
merous towers, which won for it the title of '0itta delle Cento Torn",
and of the churches, which are said to have numbered 165 in the
14th cent., only a few now remain; but parts of the ancient ram-
parts and bulwarks still attest the ancient importance of the town.

Pavia is the Tict‘num of the ancients, subsequently Papia, and was the
capital of the Lombards from 672 to TU. In the middle ages it was the
faithful ally of the German emperors, until it was handed over in 1360,
by Emp. Charles IV., to Galeazzo II. Visconti (p. 111), as imperial vicar. -
The battle of Pavia, at which Francis I. of France was defeated and taken
prisoner by Lannoy, general of Charles V., took place in the park of the
castle on 24th Feb., 1525.

Leaving the railway-station, we enter the Coast, CAVOUB (PL
A, B, 3) through the Porta Cavour (in a wall to the right is the
statue of a Roman magistrate), and following the Wa Bossolaro to
the right reach the Piazza del Duomo.

The CATHEDRAL (Pl. B, 3), begun in the early-Renaissance
style by Cristoforo Rocchi in 1488 on the site of two churches of
the Lombard period and continued with the oo-operation of Amadeo ';
and Bramante, but never completed, is a vast 'central' structure
(comp. p.1xiv) with four arms. The facade (1898) and the dome
(300 ft. high) are modern. I

In the INTERIOR are altar-pieces by tNamn'etrise (1521; in the original
frame), Bern. Gattz' (Madonna. with the rosary, 1531), Gina. Batt.. Graspi,
Daniele Crespt', and Fed. 2i'arufgtru' (1854). In the crypt is the handsome t
marble altar (by Tomm. Oruolino, 1653) of St. Syrus (2nd cent), who, accord- _
ing to the legend, was ttrat bishop of Pavia.

Adjoining the church to the left rises the massive Torre Maggiore
(256 ft. high), a tower mentioned as early as 1330; the top story
was begun in 1583 by Pellegrino Tibaldi.

We may now proceed to the Conso Vrr'romo EMANUBLE (Pl. B,
I-d), a street intersecting the town in a straight direction from N.
to S., from the Porta di Milano to the Porta Ticinese, and leading to
the Covered Bridge (14th cent. , a pleasant promenade with pictur-
esque view) over the Ticino. A chapel stands on the bridge, half-
way across.

SAN MICHELE MAGGIOBB (P1. 0, 4), to which the third side-
street to the right leads (coming from the bridge), a basilica of the
Lombard period, dates in its present Lombard-Romanesque form
