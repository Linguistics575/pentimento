A steep eyed ath, beginning at the Trattoria det Guccietori, a. little
to the W. o the 6tel Right, descends in 20 min. to the church of San
Nicole (p. 84). _

The older line of roads, diverging to the left at the Bpianata Castel-
letto (p. 84), is known as the Via di Otrconvallazione a Monte Inferiore.
The fat part of it, named the Como Carbonara, leads to the Albergo din'
Pooeri or oor-houee (Pl. D, lil, 1, 2; 300 ft. above the sea), which has
room for few persons. It then takes the name of (Jana Ddgah' and re-
joins the main thoroughfare " the Castello d‘Albertis, adjoining the up-

The *Camlio Santa or Cimitero di Staglimo (open daily 9-6, In
winter 10-6; electric line 6, p. 68) is reached from the Piazza Ma-
nin (p. 84) by the new Via. Montaldo, which leaves the city by the
Porta San Bartolomeo (Pl. I, 3, 4) and then descends (views) to the
N. into the Valley of the Bisagno and to Staglieno (p. 336). About
l M. farther on (11/3 M. ttom the town) is the entrance to the
cemetery, which was laid out by Resasco in 1844-51 and stretches
up the slope on the N. bank of the Bisegno. We first enter a large
rectangular space, with sumptuous single monuments in the recesses
of the arcades, and beyond that is an oval space, with rows of
monuments in the recesses. Flights of steps and broad inclined
planes lead up to the upper galleries, the central point of which is a.
rotunda, with a dome borne by monolithic columns of black marble.
Above the rotunda, to the N.E., close to the steep hillside, is the
tomb of Giuseppe Mazzini (d. 1872). - In returning, we may use
't electric line (No. 10) along the Wa di areonvallasione a Mare

During the 19th century the Riviera suffered from Earthquakes in 1818,
1831, 1854, and 1887. On the last occasion re eeted shocks were felt in
the district between Nice and B'inahnarina (p. . The increasing inter.
vale between the outbreaks render a speedy recurrence of the disturban-
ces very unlikely.

The remarks at p. 65 on the luxuriant flora apply espeeial1y to
the Riviera di Ponente. The railway penetrates the numerous pro-
montories by tunnels.
