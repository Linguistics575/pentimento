the modern Italian language. In 1302 he wee banished with his party,
and in 1321 died at Ravenna. Giovanni poeeqfet'o, the Brat expounder of
the Illustrious Dante and celebrated for his 'Daumeroms', which served
as a model for the 'G"iiii;rii'G' Teles‘ of Chaucer, also lived at Florence.
Florence, too, was the chief cradle of the school of the Humanist: (15th
cent.), who aimed at a universal and harmonious development of the per-
sonal character and whose contemplative life was far exalted above
ttvery-day realities. This was the home of Salutato, Ltonardo Brunt, and
Harsuppini, the 'Pagan', whose firmly moulded characters recall the per-
soueges of antiquity; it was here that the sources of classic literature were
re-dueovered by Niccolo de' Niccoli, rrareruam', and other enthusiastic eol-
lectors of books; it was here that the Pletonie Academy developed the
study of the antique into a species of religions worship, and most of the
humenists. including Fictno, Poggio, Landint, Pica delta Hirandola, and
Politian, who resided here for longer or shorter periods, received encourage-
ment and distinction at Florence. Even after the decline of 'humanitmt'
Florence continued to surpass the rest of Italy in intellectual culture, as
the names of Machiavelli, Varchi, Guieeiardfrti, end Galileo testify.

In the development of the F120: Ame Florence has played so im-
portant a part, that her ert-history is in man respects nearly eoincident
with that of the whole of Italy. We there ore refer the reader to our
prefetory article on the subject, and shall now merely direct his atten-
tion to those points which more specially concern Florence. In the 13th
cent. when frequent changes of the constitution and constantly recur-
ring iuiis''ii'io,ii of factions began to take piece, and when private citi-
zens for the first time manifested an interest in public life, a generel
taste for art gradually sprang up at Florence. With ehareeteristie pride
the Florentines proceeded to erect their cathedral, which was begun by
Arnolfo dt Gambia tt282-t301), and in the form of their Pelezzo Veeehio,
the restless aspect of their political life is distinctly ref1eeted, The In-
bonrs of Giotto (1276-1337) entitled Florence to be regarded es the head-
quarters of the Italian ainting of the Mth cent., while the journeys under.
taken by him from Pa. na to Naples were the means of rendering his style
predominant throughout the peninsula. Among Giotto’s most distin-
guished pupils we may mention Taddco.and Agnolo Gaddi, Orcagna, who
was also noted as an architect and sculptor. Spindle Arstino, and thottino.
This school flouHghed for nearly a century. The year 1402 may be accepted
as the dawn of the Rnuussmcn in Florence, for from that year detes the
Abrahem‘s 8aeriiltse and the com etition for the doors of the Baptistery
(p. 400). In architecture, however, t e new spirit did not find expression until
two decades later (comp. pp. 482, 498). While Brunellescht' tfi379-iU6) had
adhered to the national traditions in his palatial architecture (Pelazzo Pitti),
he derived numerous suggestions for his churches from a study of the
antique, particularly in the execution of details. His successors were
Leon Bantam Albert! (1404-72), Michelouo (1391-1472), Benedetto da Iajano,
and Cronaca. Stimulated by the example of the hnmenists, the artists of
this period aimed at versatility, and were not content to eontlne their
labours to one tsphere-of art; so that we frequently hear of architects who
were at the same time sculptors, and soul tors and goldsmiths who were
also painters. Among the most distinguis ed Florentine sculptors of the
Renaissance were Lorenzo Ghiberli (18781455), Luca delta Robbia (1399-1482),
who has given his name to the glazed reliefs in terraeotta, and above all
Donatello (1886-1466), the greetest master of the century, who exercised a
profound iniluenee on the development of Italian sculpture, and is justly
regarded as the precursor of Michael Angelo. The energetic life and
strong individuality of his figures ere such, that their deihsieney in grace-
fulnees is well-nigh forgotten. After Donatello‘e death, Andrea Ferroeehio
1435-88), noted else " a painter (see p. 444), became the centre of a large
artistic circle. Beside these celebrated sculptors there were many of inferior
reputation, who were fully occupied both here and at Rome in the execution
of tombstones. .

The pioneers of painting in the Renaissance period were lataccw
(1401-28), Andrea/del Gastagno (1390-1457), and Paolo Ucceuo (1397-1475],
