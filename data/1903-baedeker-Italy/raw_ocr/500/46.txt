ITALIAN ART. xxxv

neglect of external architecture, the chief importance being at-
tached to the interior, the decorations of which, however, especially
in early mediaval times, were often procured by plundering the
ancient Roman tsditletsg, and transferring the spoil to the churches
with little regard to harmony of style and material. The most ap-
propriate ornaments of the churches were the metallic objects, such
as crosses and lustres, and the tapestry bestowed on them by papal
piety; while the chief decoration of the walls consisted of mosaics,
especially those covering the background of the apes and the
'triumpU1' arch which separates the apse from the nave. The
mosaics, as far at least as the material was concerned, were of a
sterling monumental character, and contributed to give rise to a
new style of pictorial art; in them ancient tradition was for Ahe
ihst time abandoned, and the harsh and austere style tsrromsoms1y
termed Byzantine gradually Introduced.

Christian art originated at Rome, but its development was
actively promoted in other Italian districts, especially at RAVBNXA,
where during the Ostrogothic supremacy (493- -539), as well
us under the succeeding Byzantine empire, architecture
was zealously cultivated. The basilica-type was there more
highly matured, the external architecture enlivened by low arohes
and projecting buttresses, and the capitals of the columns in the
interior appropriately moulded with reference to the superinoumb-
ent arches. There, too, the art of mosaic painting was sedu-
1011st cultivated, exhibiting in its earlier specimens (in the Bap.
tinny of the Orthodox and Tomb of Galla Placidia) greater technical
excellence and better drawing than the contemporaneous Roman
works. At Ravenna the Western style also appears in combination
with the Eastern, and the church of San Vitals (dating from 547)
may be regarded as a tint) example of a Byzantine structure.

The term 'BszAarrrms' is often misapplied. Every work of the
so-called dark centuries of the middle ages, everything in archi-
tecture that intervenes between the ancient and the Gothic, every.-
thing in painting which repels by its uncouth, ill-proportioned
forms, is apt to be termed Byzantine; and it is commonly supposed
that the practice of art in Italy was entrusted exclusively to Br.
lsntine hands from the fall of the Western Empire to an ad-
stced period of the 13th century. This belief in the universal
_ and mplmtlified prevalence of the Byzantine style, as well " the
idea that it is invariably of a clumsy and lifeless character, is
entirely unfounded. The forms of Byzantine architecture are
It least strongly and clearly defined. While the basilica is a
long-extended hall, over which the eye is compelled to, range
until it ilndg a natural resisting-Platte in the recess of the apse,
every Byzantine structure may be circumscribed with a curved
line. The aisles , which in the basilica run parallel with the
