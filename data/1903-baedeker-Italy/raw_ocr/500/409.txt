relates the history of the Virgin from the rejection of Joachim‘s "ertiiee
to Mary‘s bridal rocession. The Birth of the Virgin and the Presentation
of the Virgin in t e Temple show scrupulous Melity to nature. - The Sac-
0ND Row begins with the Annunciation Orhoir-areh), and depicts the youth
of Christ and his ministry up to the driving of the money-changers out
of the Temple. The finest scenes are the Adoration of the Magi, the Flight
to Egypt, and the Entry into Jerusalem. - The grandest flight of Giotto‘a
imagination is seen in some of the paintings in the Tan Row, mainly
devoted to the Passion. The representation of Christ‘s sorrows " begin-
ning with the Corruption of Judas (to the left of the ehoiewai1) in a Mit)
dramatic touch. In the tJruoijtaion Giotto has not only surpassed his
predecessors in the nobility of his conception of the 8utrerei, but has
added a most effective and pathetic feature in the small winged angels,
who show every degree of sympathy and sorrow. The gem of the series,
however, is the Field, or Christ wept over by the Virgin and his friends,
its tone of composition being in admirable keeping with its tragic content.
- The Lownsr Bow consists of allegorical flgures of the Virtues and Vices
in griseille, and leads up to the Last J udgment. The Christ enthroned with
angels, above the eboir-arch, shows that Giotto was as much at home-in
the domain of placid graetsfu1netss es in that of emotion and passion:
