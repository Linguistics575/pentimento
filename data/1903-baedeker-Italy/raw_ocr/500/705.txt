I"174. Raphael, Vision of Ezekiel: God the Father, enthroned
on the living creatures of three of the 1ilvangeliista, is adored by

the angel of St. Matthew,

'Even In his imitation of Miehaelangelesqne types Raphael exhibits
great freedom and the clearest censciousness of what is best adapted to
his natural gifts an of where his true strength lies. This remark applies
to the small picture of Ezekiel in the Pitti Gallery, so miniature-like in it,
tineness of execution, though less striking In the colouring. 1n the arrange
ment of the two smaller angels who support the arms of the Almighty,
the example of Michael Angelo was followed. From the testimony of "
sari, howeirer, we know that In portraying Jehovah, Raphael sought in-
spiration in the classical Jupiter, and certainly the features strongly recall
the types of the antique divinity”. - Springer.

*171. Raphael, Tommaso Fedra. Inghiremi, humanist and pupal
secretary (original in America).

'The fact that the man is represented at a moment of wrapt suspem
and inward concentration diverts the attention from the nnpleasing fea-
tures, and ennobles and idealises the head, which, while certainly not
handsome, cannot be denied the possession of intellect end e nameless
power of attraction'. - Springer.

"151. Raphael, Madonna della Sedia (or Seggiole), painted
during the artist’s Roman period.

e".. 'In this picture Raphael returns to the early and simple subjects of
representation, breathing nothing but serene happiness, which gleddea.
the artist and charm the beholder, which any little and yet possess so
deep tb significance. Florentine forms have been supplanted by Roman
ones, and tender and clear beauty of colouring has given place to abroad
and picturesque style of laying on the pigments. . . . At least fifty em
gravers have tried their skill upon the Madonna delle Sedie, and photo-
graphic copies have been disseminated by thousands. No other picture
of Raphael is so popular, no other work of modern art so well known‘. -
