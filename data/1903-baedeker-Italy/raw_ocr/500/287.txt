The steamer now steers obliquely across the lake to Sunle-
mette (Stella dUtalia; Pens. Amsler), beautifully situated at the
mouth of the picturesque Val Solda, with Castello high above it
o. 12). Beyond Oria, the station for Albogasio, begins the Swiss
part of the lake. The slopes of the Mte. di Caprino (p. 12), to the

dell' Annunziata contains some old frescoes. To the left rise the
steep flanks of Mte. Generoso (p. 13). The boat now passes, with
lowered tunnel, through an arch of the viaduct mentioned at p. "
and touches at Melide (p. 13) on the W. and sometimes " 31mm
