"sitio? (original at the Palazzo Corsini, p. 507). - We now return to the

staircase, at the head of which are the cells (No. 31) of St. Antonin
(Ant. Pierozzi: d. 1459) Archbishop of Florence for it years. - Opposite
is the Lnnunr, the first public library in Italy, built hr Michelouo
in 1441 for Cosimo de' Medici, who presented it with 400 MSS. collected
by Niccolb Niccoli. The gless-cases in the middle contain ritual books,
with miniatures by Fra Benedetto, the brother of Angelico, and other
artists of the 15th century. - On the other side of this corridor are
Two CELL! (Nos. 33, 34), near those of St. Antonina, and containing
three small easel pictures by Pra Angelica (’Madonna delle Stelle, ‘Oorona-
tion of the Virgin, and °Adoration of the Magi with the Annuncistion).
The LAST CELL on the right, embellished with tCfirte Adoration of the
Magi, nl fresco, by Fra Angelica, is said to be that which Cosimo Pater
Patrizia caused to be fitted up for himself, and where he received the
Abbot Antaninus and Fra Angelica; it contains his portrait by Pontorm
and a terracotta bust of St. Antonine.

The Aeeademia delta Orusca, founded in 1582 to maintain the
purity of the Italian language, occupies part of the monastery. Its
great dictionary of the language, begun in 1843, is still only about
half finished.

0n the S.E. side of the piazza, at the corner of the Via della
Sapienza (leading to the Piazza dell' Annunziata, p. 482), lies the
Reale Istituto di Studj Superiori (entr. Piazza S. Marco 2), the flrgt
floor of which contains the Indian Museum, founded by A. de
Gubernatis (adm., see p. d37r catalogue 60 o.), and Mineralogical
and Geological Collections. - This building is adjoined on the Na.
by the tine Botanical Garden Pl. H, 3; entr., Tia Lamarmora 6b),
founded by Cosimo I. in 15 3, usually called the Giardino de'
8empliei.

The quiet Via Ricssoli leads from the S. angle of the Piazza di
S. Marco to the Pia‘zza del Duomo. No. 62 in this street is the
entrance to the Accademia di Belle Arti (Pl. G, 3), containing
the *GALLERIA ANTICA B MODERNA, founded in 1783. Admission.
see p. 437; catalogue (1901), by the curator E. Pieraccini, 2 fr.
The building was originally the Ospedale di San Matteo. - The
collection of ancient masters contains few pictures to strike the
eye or imagination of the amateur, but it is a most important
collection for students of the development of Italian art during
the 14-16th centuries. We have the advantage here of being able
to concentrate our attention on the characteristic features of the
Tuscan and Umbrisn schools, to the productions of which this
collection is restricted. The small pictures of Giotto (Room VI,
No. 103, etc.) and Fra Anirelieo's Life of Christ (Room IX, No. 233)
are merely to be regarded as supplementary to the much more
important labours of these two great masters in the department
of freturo-printing,. the Last Judgment (Room IX, No.2661and the
Descent from the Cross (Room w, No. 166), however, afford 1 good
idea of Fra Ange1itso's works. The collection is ehieily important
for the study of the Florentine art of the 15th century. The
excellent nsrrative-painter Francesco Pesellino (Room IV, No. 72)
