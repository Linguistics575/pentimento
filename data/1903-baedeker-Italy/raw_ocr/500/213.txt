Jsidenets by the English and for trea-bathing In summer by the Italians.
The chief centres of traffio are the Corso Cavour, the Via Mazzini,
on the coast, the neighbouring Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, converted
into an attractive Giardino Pubblico, and the Via Chjodo, leading to
the S.W. to the arsenal (see below). -.....- The Gulf of Spezia, one of the
largest, safest, and most convenient harbours in Europe, anciently
praised by Ennius as the Lunai Portus, has been the chief navel
harbour of Italy since 1861. The entrance is protected not only by
several hill-forts, but also by the Diga Subacquea, an embankment
nearly 2 M. long, constructed in 1874. Beside the latter, AMI the
shore, are the two forts of Santa Maria (W.) and Santa Teresa Oil.).
- The Royal Naval Arsenal on the S. side of the town, constructed
by General Chiodo (d. 1870), whose statue rises at the entrance, is a
large establishment, 150 acres in extent (no admission). Beside it
are the Naval Barracks and the Hospital. The marine artillery
magazines in the bay of San Vito cover an area of 100 acres. The
Cantiere di San Bartolomeo (electric tramway, p. 103), on the N.E.

side of the gulf, serve " an electric and torpedo station. The com- I

mercial harbour, to the N.E. of the town, is connected by railway
with the main line and is used, like that of Avenza (p. 105), tr
