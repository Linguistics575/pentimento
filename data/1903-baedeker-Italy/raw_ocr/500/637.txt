placed over the door in 1529 ( u esns Ohrietus Rex Florentini Populi
s. p. deereto eleetue’) was altered by Cosimo I. to 'Rex regum et
Dominne dominantium’. To the left of the entrance is a. tablet
showing the result of the plebiscite of 1860. From 1504 downto
1873 the famous statue of David by Michael Angelo, which is now
in the Academy (p. 493), stood here. On the right is a group of
Hercules and Cacus by Michael Angela’s rival Baccio 2hmdinelli,
who hoped to excel the great master in this work o. IV). The two
imsigniNerit statues by Bandinclli and Rossi on each side of the
entrance were used as chain-poets;

The outer Coma was renewed by Michelono in the Renaissance style
in 1454. The elaborate decorations of the columns, the groteaquea on the
ceiling, and the faded views of Austrian towns were added by Marco a
Fame in 1565, in honour of the marriage of Frenceeco (afterwards Grand-
Duke) to Johanna of Austria. In the centre. above a large basin of porphyry
(1555), is a *Boy with a. flgh as a fountain-ttgums, by Andr. Verrocddo,
originally made for a villa. of Lorenzo de' Medici. At the back are Samson
and a Philietine (a caricature of Michael Angelo) by Rout. The armoritl

we ascend the stairs to the FIRST F100]: and enter (door on the right) the
GREAT HALL (Sula dei Gngueeento-, always open), constructed by Cream
in 1496 for the Great Cauncil, created on the expulsion of the Medici. lt
was occupied as nerters for the Spanish troops in 1512, and reconstructed
by Traeari in 15 et seq. In 1669 Cosimo I. here assumed the dignity of
grand-duke, and in 1860-69 the hall was used for the sittings of the Italian
Parliament. In 1603 leonardo da thm' and Michael Angelo were com-
miseioned to decorate the hall with frescoes from Florentine history.
Leonardo executed a. gartoon of the Battle of Anghiari (defeat of the
Milanese in 1440), and Michael Angelo designed hie ‘Bething Bowers'

Both cartoons have perished (Michael Angelo's torn up by Baecio Bandinelli
in 1512), as well as the small portion from De. Vinci‘e transferred in fresco
