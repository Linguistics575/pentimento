ancient Andes a M. to the Bal., near the village of Pietole), but It was not
a. piece of importance till the middle ages. In 1276 the citizens elected
Pinamonte Bonacolat, and in 1328 Luigi Gmaga, " ‘Cepiteno del Popolo',
and to the dynasty of the latter the town owed its prosperity. The
Gonzegss fought successfully against Milan and Venice, and extended their
territory, while the were liberal patrons of art and science. Giovanni

The beautiful and accomplished Isabella d'Este (1474-1539) , sister of
Alphonso, Duke of Ferrets, and mother of Eleonora of Urbino, wes
the wife of Giovanni Francesco III. (1484-1519). She carried on e lively
correspondence with the most eminent men ot her time, and with judicious

(1519-40) was raised to the rank of duke by C erles V., and in 1536 he
was invested with the marquisate of Monteferreto; a monument of his reign
is the Palazzo del Te (p. 240). In 1627, when Charles de Nevers, . member
of * French collateral line, ascended the throne, the Mantuan war of
succession broke out, and Emperor Ferdinand II. declared the tut forfeited.
On 18th July, 1630, Mantua was stormed and sucked by the Austrians.
Although the em ror, hard pressed by the Swedes, was obliged to eon-
clude peace in 1 1, the town never recovered from this blow. Carlo I V.,

In the history of ARCHITECTURE Mantua. is of importance on account

of the buildings of Leon Bauata AINrti (p. 448) of Florence, who hid
been summoned to Mantne by Ludovico III. - Manta: also witnessed
the labours of several great Rnxussmcn Puxrsns. Andrea df,
(p. 249) entered the service of Lodovico Gonzege in 1463. In vigour of
conception and in the Melity of his characters he rivels his best can-
temporsries, while he surpasses them in accuracy of perspective and in
his refused taste for beauty of landscape. He died at Mantua in 1506, and
was succeeded as 1sourt-patnter in the following year by Lorenzo Coda
(comp. pp. 866, 865). When Raphael’s pupils were dispersed after his
death, Giulio Romano (1492-1546), the greatest of them, settled at Hentna.
in 1624, and there attained so high a. reputation es an architect end
painter, that Mantna has been called the 'town of Giulio Romano'. After
the example of Raphael‘s work in the Farnesina, he composed mythological
decorative paintings, which, though for interior to their prototype, attract
by the richness of the motives and sensuous mtsgnifUenotr of composition,
and are important owing to the Influence they exercised on later art.
Francesco Primaticcio and Niccolo delP Abbate, pupils of Giulio Romano
who were educated here, were afterwards summoned to BontMnebleatt,
and thus formed a. link between the French and the Italian Renaissance.
Giulio Romeno‘s works must also have Influenced the style of Rubm, who
was court-painter at Mantua in 1600-8, under Vincenzo II.
