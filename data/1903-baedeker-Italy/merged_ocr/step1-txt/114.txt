Eugene's valuable gallery, which included many Netherlandish
works. A number of the paintings carried off by the French in

in 1832, the rest, which had meantime been scattered through
various palaces, were collected to form a public gallery in the
Palazzo Madame. They were transferred to the Accademia ina1865.
