valleys of the Born Baum and the Isére 0n the N., and those of the
Dora Riparia and the Are on the S. We here describe. few of the most
interesting routes through the E. part of this grand mountain-region,
in the form of a circular tour of four days from Aorta, taking in Cogne,
Vakavaranchc, Rhému Notrc-Dame, Valgrisanche, and Liverogne. Cogne is
the best centre for excursions.
