The Maritime and 2rigurtan Alps and the contiguous Apenm'nea (the boundary between which is acme 20 M. to the W. of Genoa) slope gently.northwards to the Po in the form of an extensive rolling country, and descend
abruptly towards the sea to the S. The narrow RIVIERA, or coast-district,
is sheltered from the N. wind by the mountains, and enjoys a Jine sunny
aspect. While the mean temperature at Turin "52° F- L, it is no less
than 61° at Genoa; and again, while the temperature of January averages
31° at the former, and occasionally falls below zero, it averages dip at the
latter, and is rarely lower than 23°. The climate of the Riviera is therefore milder than that of Rome, and ever since the middle of the 19th cent.
has attracted crowd: of visitors, fleeing from the northern winters.

The Riviera, divided by Genoa into an eastern (Riviera di Levanle; p. m
and a larger western half (Riviera di Punch"), which belongs to Prince from
Ventimiglia westwards, is one of the most picturesque regions of Italy. It
affords a. delightful variety of landscapes bold and lofty promontories alternating with wooded hing, and richly cu tivated plains near the coast. At
pieces the 20-6 phases precipitous and frowning cliffs, washed by the surf
of the Mediterranean, while the summits ere crowned with the venerable
mine of towers erected in bygone ages for protection against pirates. At
other places extensive plantations of olives, with their grotesque and gnarled
Items, bright green pints-forests, and luxuriant growths of flgtr, vines,
citrons, oranges oleenders, myrtles, uni aloe: meet the view, and even
palms are oetsturiona11y seen. Many of the town: are charmingly situated
in fertile spots or on picturesque hills; others, commanded by ancient
Itrongholds, are perched like nests among the rocks. Little churches and
chapels peering from the sombre foliage of cypreeees, and gigantic grey
pinnacles of rock frowning upon the smiling phi", frequently enhance
the charm! of the scenery, while the vast expanse of the Mediterranean,
with its ever-varying hues, forms one of the chief attractions. At one
time the sea is bathed in a flood of sunshine, "Inother its beautiful blue
foirmy arrests the eye; or while the shore immediately below the spectator
inhahed with wild breakers, the snowy crests of the wave: In gradually
"tted to view in the purple diatnnce.
