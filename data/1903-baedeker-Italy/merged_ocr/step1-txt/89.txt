10 Route 3. LUGANO. From Lueeme

Civico (P1. c, 3), erected in 1844, with a beautiful colonnaded
court and a small Collection of Paintings by local artist: on the tint
floor (open 10-12 and 2-4; fee). Beyond lies the Piazza della Riforma. - A broad QUAY, planted with trees and much frequented
as an evening-promenade, stretches, under various 11.11185, along the
lake. At its B. end is the Theatre o. 9); at the S. and of the
Quai Vincenzo Vela is a small Fountain Statue of Tell (P1. o, q by
Vela (1852).

The old eonventual church of SANTA MARIA DEGLI ANGIOLI
(Pl. 0, 4), adjoining the HÃ©tel du Pure, contains some good frescoes
by Bernardino Luini..

The painting on the wall of the screen (1529), one of the largest and finest
ever executed by Luini, represent- the'Pam'an of Christ, and contains
several hundred figuras, arranged according to the antiquated style in
tho town. In the foreground, occupying the upper part of the wall,
stand three huge crosses, at the foot of which we perceive Roman warriors, the groups of the holy women, and St. John, and the executioner,
casting Iota for the garments. Above on a diminished scale, from lento
right, are Christ on the Mount of bum, Christ taken prisoner, the
Mocking of Christ, the Bearing of the Cross, the Entombment, Thomaais Unbelief, and the Ascension, all immediately adjacent. Although the style of
the composition strikes one as old-fashioned, the eye cannot fail to be
gratified by the numerous beau tiful details. The St. Sebastian and St. Rochus,
below, between the arches, are particularly tine. - To the left, on the
wall of the church, is the Last Supper, and in the Ist Chapel on the right
is a. fine Madonna, two frescoes by Luini. The chapel also contains the
tomb of Archbp. Lachat (d. 1886). The sacristan expects a small fee
1 _ ISO.

The interior of the town, with its arcades, its shops and
workshops in the open air, and the granite wheel-tracks in the
streets, is also quite Italian in its character. - Ban Lorenzo
(Pl. o, 2), the principal church, on a height below the station,
built at the close of the 15th cent, his a tastefully enriched marble
facade in the ear1y-Renaisstsamus style, probably by Tommaao Rodari
(1517) .--. The terrace in front of the station commands an extensive
*View of the town and the lake.'
