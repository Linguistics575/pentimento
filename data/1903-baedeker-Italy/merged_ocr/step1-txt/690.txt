The CLoxsms, immediately adjoining the church, with double
arcades attributed to Brunelleaehi, form a striking reminiscence of the
great period of the Medici. Immediately to the right is a statue of
Paolo Giovio (1483-1655), the historian, by Francesco da Sangauo
(1560).

A staircase, beginning in the passage to the right of the entrance
to the church, ascends to the upper story of the cloisters and to the
Biblioteoe Laursnziana (P1. E, F, 4; adm., see p. 437; gratuities
forbidden), a library founded try Cosimo the Elder in 1444, and
gradually enlarged by the Medici. Its chief treasure consists of
about 10,000 MSS. of Greek and Latin classical authors, many of
which are extremely valuable. The building was begun in 1523-6
from the design of Michael Angelo, the portico was built by him
(very effective in spite of several eccentricitiee, such as the columns
inserted in the walls, with massive value: below), and the staircase
Ewhich was also designed by Michael Angelo) was completed in

558-71 by Vasari t' the rotunda containing the Bibi. Deletem, was
, erected in 1841, from Poeeianti'8 design.
