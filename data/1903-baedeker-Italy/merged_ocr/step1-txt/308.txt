Further on we pass the granite-quarries of Monte Orfano (2696 ft.)
and then cross the Toss, by a flve-arehedbridgts, to the railway-station
of Graeellona (p. 182), 6 M. from Pallanza (omnibus, see pp. 177, 183).

and to (712 M.) Guzzago (p. 182). Milan Cathedral and part of m Carma
di Pavia are built of Candeglie marble.

In the S.W. nook of the bay lies Feriolo, 23AM. from Gravellona
(p.182; emu. to Stress, see pp. 180,183). The large granite-quarries
extending along the hills between Feriolo and Baveno have for ages
yielded a splendid building material, which has been used for the
columns in the Cathedral of Milan, the church of Sun Paolo fuori le
Mum at Rome, the Galleria Vitt. Emanuele at Milan, and many
other important structures. The quarries are worked mainly by the
Bella Casa Company, an English enterprize. - Then

Baum; (690 (L), a small place commanding a tine view of the
bay, is situated on alluvial soil at the mouth of a streamlet descending from Monte Mottarone (p. 181). It is frequently chosen for a
stay of some time, especially in the warmer months. The Villa Clara,
on the SE. side of the village, was occupied by Queen Victoria
for three weeks in April, 1879, and for a month by the invalid
Crown Prince of Germany (Emp. Frederick 111.) in Oct., 1877 (no
admission).

The most beautiful feature in this W. bay of the lake is formed
by the *Borromean Islands, the scenery in the neighbourhood of
which rivals that of the Lake of Como in grandeur and perhaps
surpasses it In softness of character. The westernmost, the Isola
Superiore or dei Pesoatorl (Trattoria del Verbano, plain), is almost
entirely occupied by a ilishtng-village (300 inho0, but commands
some picturesque views. The steamers touch here only occasionally,
but In of them call at the--

a barren rock with a church and a handful of cottages, until Count
Vitaliano Borromeo (d. 1690) converted it into a summer-residcnee
