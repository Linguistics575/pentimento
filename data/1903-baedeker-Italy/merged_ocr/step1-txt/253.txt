S.E. into the 001150 DI P0311 ROMANA (electric car, see p. lid),
which leads to the .gate of that name. We follow this street as fat
as the church of San Nazaro (P1. F, 6, T), with the masterpiece
of Bernardino Eanini (1546), a large fresco representing the *Martyrdom of St. Catharine, painted in imitation of the similar picture
in the Brera by Lanini's master Gaud. Ferrari (No. 107); a handsome carved Gothic altar; and ancient Swiss tstained-glass windows
to the right of the main entrance. A side-entrance admits to the
octagonal sepulchral chapel of the Trivulzi, built by Girolamo delta
Perm (1519). - To the N.E., in the Via dell' Ospedale, is the
*Ospedale Maggiore (PI. F, 6), a vast and remarkably fine brick

. structure, begun in the Renaissance style in 1456 by Antonio
Filarete of Florence, continued in the Gothic style by Guiniforte
Solari and other Lombard architects, and not completed by Ricchini
till after 1624. It contains no fewer than nine courts. The extensive
principal court, surrounded by arcades, in by Ricchini (17th cent),
the court to the right of it is ascribed to Bramante. The ei11f1tas is
entirely covered externally with terracotta, in a style frequently
observed in other Milanese buildings, but its facade, with its rich
window-mouldings, is superior to any other structure of the kind at
Milan. In the chapel are two paintings by Francesco de Vino, containing portraits of Francesco and Bianca Maria Slot", the founders
of the hospital.

From the back of the hospital the VIA San Barnaba leads to the
Rotunda (Pl. H, IF, open on Thurs. * Sum, Io-r, adm. 50 ISO, built by
Arrigone and dedicated by the Viceroy Eugene Beauharnais in 1809 33 a
Pantheon Nationals. It now contains a large collection of ym-tram of benefactors of the Ospedale Maggiore, from the 16th cent. to the present day. In the THa Guutdle, the thrst 1srtrsg-strttet of the Via Sm Barnlbe, is the
Synagogue (Pl. a, 6, e), by Luca Beltrami (1892).

and the Piazza Fontane (Pl. F, 5) to the Piazza del Duomo, or we
may follow the Via Cesare Beccaria to the N. to the Palazzo di
Giustizia (Pl. F, N, a baroque structure by Seregni, with a courtyard
