Palasso rim. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 511

King of Italy when at Florence. The upper floor of the left wing
contains the far-famed "Picture Gallery (Galleria Palatine), which
was formerly the property of Cardinals Leopold and Carlo de' Medici,
and of the Grand-ane Ferdinand 11. The Pitti Gallery, which
contain: About 500 works, may be regarded as an extension of the
Tribune o. 461) in the Uffizi Gallery. No collection in Italy can
boast of such an array of masterpieces, interspersed with "few
works of subordinate merit. The most conspicuous work of the
earlier Florentine period is the round Madonna by Filippo Lippi
(No. 343; p. 517). Pemgino's Pieth (164; p. 514), in which the
treatment of the landscape deserves notice, is one of his principal
works. To Fra Bartolomeou later period belong the Resurrection
(159; p. 514), the Holy Family (256; p. 516), St. Mark (125;
p. 515), and the Piste (64; 515), the master's last work, a model
of composition, ennobled by depth of sentiment and purity of
forms, and certainly one of the most beautiful products of Italian
art. Andrea del Sarto, the great colonrist, is admirably represented
by an Annunciation (124; p. 515); by the so-called Dispute (172;
p. 514), a picture without action, but of an imposing and dignified
character; a Pieth (58; p. 515), more dramatically treated than is
the master's wont; and the Madonna with saints (307; p. 517),
all of which show his different excelleneies, and particularly the
t soft blending of his colours. - The treasures of the gallery
l culminate in no fewer than a dozen of Runner }: worn. The
j exquisite'Madonna del Granduca' (178; p. 513), in which a
pure type of simple female beauty is but slightly veiled by the
reli one character of the work, and the'Madonna della Sedia'

(15 l p.514), I. most beautiful work of purely human character, in
which intense maternal happiness is expressed by the attitude of
the group, both captivate every beholder. The'Madonna del Baldaechino' (165; p. 514, on the other hand, and the'Madonna
dell' 1mpanmsta' (No. 9; p. 515), are of inferior interest and are
not entirely by Raphael'ts own hand. The Vision of Ezekiel (174;
p. 514), likewise completed by his pupils, transports us into an
entirely different sphere, in which Raphael treats a medieval
symbolical subject. The iinegt of the portraits is that of Leo X.
with the two cardinals (40; p.516), in which the delicate and
harmonious blending of the four shades of red should be noticed.
The portrait of Julius II. CTW; p. 515) exhibited here is now
regarded as a Venetian copy of the original in the Tribune o. 462).
The portraits of Cardinal Bibbiena (158; p. 514) and Inghirami
(171; p. 514) are also now admitted to be early copies. In the
'Domn Veleta' (245; p. 515) we recognize Raphael's mistress,
whom a later groundless tradition has described as a baker's
daughter ('Fomsrir1s0. The same beautiful features recur in the
Sistine Madonna at Dresden. The portraits of Angiolo and Maddalena Deni oi, NF, p. 514), of the master's Florentine period,
