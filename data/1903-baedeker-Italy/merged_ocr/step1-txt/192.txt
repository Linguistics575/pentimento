Clinics. San Remo is sheltered by an unbroken semicircular hill
rising from the Capo Nero to the Piano Gum (3000 no, culminating
in the Kim" WW 18676 ft) Ind 1mm Bignou (4260 ft., and descending thence to the Capo Verde, its summit being nowhere more than I M.
distant in a strai ht line. The N. winds are therefore entirely excluded
from this favoure spot, eapemuy u e double rungs of Alps mu behind
the town I little farther back, while the force of the B. and W. winds
ismnch broken. Violent E. winds, however, frequently occur at the end
of February and the beginning of March, and the'lkigtrB1' is also an unwelcome visitor at this season. - To consumptive and bronchial patients
the E. bay is recommended on account of its sheltered situation and humid
atmosphere while sufferers from nervous and liver complaints will tind

San Roma, a town of 20,0271nhab., lies in the middle of'
beautiful bay, 61/, M. long, embosomed in olive-grovee that cover
tU valleys and lower slopes and give place higher up to pines and
other coniferaa. It has been a health-resort since 1861.

The crowded houses of the old town occupy a steep hill between the short valleys of the Torrents del Convento and the Torrente di San Romolo. A smaller quarter named Castigliuoli lies to
the W. of the latter stream. These older parts of the town consist
of t curious labyrinth of narrow lanes, flights of steps, erehweye,
lofty and sombre houses, and mouldering walls. The arches which
connect the houses high above the streets are intended to give them
stability in case of earthquakes. Vines are frequently seen clambering up the houses and putting forth their tendrils and leaves
on the topmost stories.

The new town, occupying the alluvial land at the foot of the
hill, contains all the public buildings. The long Via Vittorio Emanuele (P1. 0, D, 3), with its numerous shops, is the chief centre of
"Ema To the S.E. is the fort of Santa chla (Pl. D, 3, 4; now I
Prison), constructed by the Genome to defend the smell harbour,
Which is sheltered by n siekreoUped Bmxvunn 1300 ft. in
length. A survey from the parapet of this M010 will convey an idea
0f the sheltered position of San Remo.
