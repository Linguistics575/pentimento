whose portraits rival those of Titian. To a younger generation belongs
Jacopo 2% toretto (Rabum 1519.94), who squandered excellent abilities on
superficial works (Veeari calls him HI pin terribile cervello, che ebbie
avuto mai la pittnra'), and In his eegernese for tstreet lost the golden tints
of his school. Paolo CdWiri, uurnemad Vcrmu (1528-88), on the other
hand, though more realistic, maintains the heat tradition! n! his school. Last

which furnishes answers to most of the questions about Venice that euggeat themselves to the intelligent visitor. The Inna luthor'l'Venice: an
Hutorieal Sketch of the Republic' (1893) end'Venetien Studies' (1887) are
also recommended. It is, of course, well to be familiar with RuNsu'8tones

printed separately for the use of travellers' (in 2 octavo vole.; 1881). His
