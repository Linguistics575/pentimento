66 Route 16. GENOA.

As the country differs in many respects from Piedmont, so also do its
huum'ume, while their Genoese dialect, which is irtffleu1t for farei ners
to understand, occupies a middle place between the Gallic patch at pp"
Italy and that of Sardinia. The historical development of the two countries
has also been widely different. The natural resource of the Ligum'am, or
the inhabitants of the Riviera, was the sea, and they were accordingly known
to the Greeks at a very early period as pirates and freebooters. As the Greek
Massalia. formed the centre of trade in 8. France, with Nikaea (Nice) "its
extreme outpost towards the IL, so Genoa constituted the natural outlet for
the traffic of the Riviera. During the 3rd cent. Genon beenne subject
to the Romans, who in subsequent centuries had to wage long and obstinate
wars with the Ligurians, in order to secure the possession of the military
coast-road to Spain. As late as the reign of Augustus the Roman culture
had made little progress here. At that period the inhabitants exported
timber, cattle, hides, wool, and honey, receiving wine and oil in exchange.
1n the Tth cent the Lombard: gained a. footing here, and theneeforth the
political state of the country was gradually altered. The W. part with
Nice belonged to Provence, but in 1388 came into the possession of the
Counts of'Savoy, forming their only access to the sea down to the mod
when they acquired Genoa (1815). After the Austrian war of 185 Nice
(1512 sq. M.) and. Savoy (3889 sq. M.) were ceded by Italy to France in
1860 as B. compensation for the services rendered by Napoleon m.

The district of Liguria, consisting of the province ] of Porto Maurizio
and Genoa, with In area of 2040 sq. M. and 899,300 inhab., once formed the
REPUBLIC or GENOA, which in the 18th cent. became mistress of the W.
part of the Mediterranean, and afterwards fought against Venice for the
supremacy of the Levant. Genoa's greatness was founded on the ruin of
Pisa. The Tuscan hatred of the Genoeee was embodied in the saying 'Mare senza. pesce, montngne aenn uheri, uomini senza. fede, e donne senza
vergogms', and Dante ant. xxxiii. 151-53) addresses them with the worth-. _

'Ahi, Genovesi, uomini diversi

D'ogni costume, a pien d'ogni megagna;

Perche non Diets vol del mondo spent t'
Modern historians describe the character of the Genoese in the middle
gas in a similar strain. The whole energy of the Genoese seems indeed I
to have been concentrated on commerce and the pursuit of gain. Notwithstanding their proud naval supremacy, they participated little in the
intellectual development of Italy, and neither possessed a school of art,
nor produced any scholars of eminence. When at length the eeetts republic was incorporated with Piedmont, it became the representative of
radical principles as contrasted with the conservatism of the royalist territory. Giuseppe Mazzim' was born At Genoa in 1808, and Garibaldi, though
born at Nice (1807), was the son of a Genoese of Chiavari. The rivalry
of the once far-famed republic with the upstart Turin, and of the restless
harbour population with the stolid Piedmontese, have of recent years
been productive of very notable mum. Modern Genoa has, moreover,
regained its ancient mercantile importanee, though its navel arsenal has
been transferred to Spezie.
