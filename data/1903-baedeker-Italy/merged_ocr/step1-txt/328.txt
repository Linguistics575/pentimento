. Bergamo (820-1200 In), the ancient Bergomum, a Milanese
town from 1264 to 1428 but after that Venetian until 1797, now a
movineial capital and episcopal see, with 46,861 inhab. (suburbs
included), lies at the junction of the Valle Brembana, watered by
the Brembo, and the Valle Seriana, named after the rapid Serio
(another affluent of the Adda). This is one of the busiest of the
smaller trading and manufacturing towns in Italy, although its once
famous fair (Tiers di Sant' Alessandro, middle of August to middle
of September) has lost Its importance. The town consists of two
distinct parts, the Omit Alta, picturesquely situated on hills and
strongly fortified by the Venetians in 1561-88, and the much larger
new quarters in the plain (Barge San Leonardo, Borgo Pignolo,
Barge San Tommaso), with numerous cotton, silk, and other factories and an interesting piazza (Fiera; PI. D, d).

From the railway-station (P1. D, E, 6) the broad Wale della
Stazione leads to the PIAZZA VIHOEIO Emuunu (P1. D, 5), with
a statue of Victor Emmanuel "by Barzaghi (Pl. 19). The Via
Barium leads hence to the W. to Sant' Alessandro in Colonna (Pl. 5;
C, 5), containing a fine'Assumption by Romanino (left transept).
The church is named from the partly antique column in front of
it, "which St. Alexander, tutelary saint of Bergamo, is said to
have suffered martyrdom.

To the N.E., beyond the Teatro Gaetano Donizetti (P1. 26; D, 6),
is the Puzu DONIZETTI, with a monument by Franc. J erace (1897)
to Guiana Donizetti (1798-1848), who was a native of Bergamo;
the composer, seated upon an ancient Greek exedra, receives the
inspiration of a Muse. - In the Via Torquato Tasso, on the N.
