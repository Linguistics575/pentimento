History. GENOA. 16. Route. 71

The internal history of the city was no less chequered than the external. The parW-mottiliets between the grout (milieu of the Doria,
Spinola, Adam, end rm": (Ghibellines) on one side, and the Grimaldi,
'iettsltt', auarohi, and 3fontaldi (Guelphs) on the other, led to some extra..
ordinary results. at the expense of their own
independence, to invoke the aid of some foreign prince, and accordingly
we find that after the 14th cent. the kings of Naples and France, the
marquises of Montferrat, and the dukes of Milan were alternately masters
of Genoa. Nor was this lute of affairs materially altered by the revolution
of 1339, by which the exclusive sway of the nobility wee overthrown,
And. Doge, elected for life, invested with the supreme power. In the
midst of all this confusion the only stable element was the mercantile
Banco di San Giorgio, which had acquired extensive possessions, ehiefly
in Corsica, and would, perhaps, have eventually absorbed the whole of the
republic and converted it into a commercial aristocracy, had not Genoa

Charles v. t "length restored peace by the establishment of a new oligarohte
constitution (1628), and the unsuccessful conspiracy of Fieeco in 1647 was
one of the last instances of an attempt to make the supreme power
dependent on unbridled personal ambition. But the power of Genoa was
already on the wane. The Turks conquered its Oriental possessions one
after another, and the city was subjected to severe humiliation, by
Louis JOY. of Flume, whose fleet under Dawn »! bombarded Genoa in

some months in 1746. These last were expelled by a popular rising,
begun by a stone thrown by Balilla, a lad of 16 years. A revolt in Corsica,
which begun in 1729 was suppressed only with the aid of the French,
who afterwards (1766) took possession of the island on their own behalf.
In 1797 the aristocratic government of Genoa was superseded by the
democratic'Ligurien Republie', established by Napoleon. In 1305 Genoe

of Sardinia.

Gothic period. The Renaissance palaces of the Genoeae noblesee are, on
the other hand, of the greatest im ortance, surpassing in number and

uniform character, and displays great Ingenuity In making the best of an

a. The Harbour and the Adjoining Streets.

Until recently the harbour consisted solely of the Porto or inner
harbour, which was closed on the B. by the Mole Vecchio (492 yds.
long), said to have been constructed in 1134, and by the Moto Nuova (722 yds. long), dating from the 18th century. In 1877-95,

francs having been presented to the city for the purpose by the Mer
