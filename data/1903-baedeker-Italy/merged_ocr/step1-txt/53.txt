xlii ITALIAN ART.

The word Beneiuenoe is commonly understood to denigrate n
Rum? revival of the antique; but while ancient art now begun to
BAIOI lMutmim artistic taste more powerfully, and in study to be
thnmma. more zealously prosecuted, the essential choreoter of the
Renaissance consists by no means exclusively, or even principally,
in the imitation of the antique; nor must the term be oosaiintrd
merely to art, as it truly embraces the whole progress of eivilisation in Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries. How the
Renaissance manifested itself in political life, and the diiterent
phases it assumes in the geitsntidie and the social world, cannot
here be discussed. It may, however, be observed that the Re.
naissance in social life was chiefly promoted by the'humaniata',
who preferred general culture to great professional attainments,
who enthusiastically regarded classical antiquity as the golden
age of great men, end who exercised the most extensive Inburners Ott the bias of artistic down. In the period of the Renaissance the position of the artist with xegud to hll work, and
the nature and aspect of the latter are changed. The educetion and
taste of the individual leave a more marked impress on the work of
the author than was ever before the case; his creations are pre-emuently the reflection of his intellect; his alone is the responsibility,
his the reward of success or the mortiiieation of failure. Artiste
now seek to attain celebrity, they desire their works to be examined
and judged as testimonials of their personal endowments. Mere
technical skill by no means satisittyg them, although they are far
from despising the drudgery of a handicraft (many of the moat eminent quattroeentitstss having received the rudiments of their education
in the workshop of a goldsmith); the exclusive pursuit of a single
sphere of art is regarded by them as In indication of intas11eotutr1
poverty, although they aim at mastering the technique of every
branch. They work simultaneously as painters and sculptors, and
when they devote themselves to architecture, it is deemed nothing
unwanted or anomalous. A comprehensive and versatile education,
united with refined personal sentiments, forms their loftiest aim. This
they attain in but few instances, but that they eagerly aspired to it
is proved by the biography of the illustrious Leon Berna" Aunx-n
fiMH-72), who is entitled to the same rank in the 15th oentury as
Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th. Rationally educated, physically and
morally healthy, keenly alive to the calm enjoyments of life, and
possessing clearly defined ideas and decided tastes, the Renaissance
artists necessarily regarded nature and her artistic embodiment
with different views from their predecessors. A fresh end joyous love
of nature seems to pervade the whole of this period. She not only
afforded an unbounded field to the tsts1ent; itle, but artists also strove
to approach her "first by a careful study of her various phenomem. Anatomy, geometry, perspective, and the study of drapery
and colour are zealously pursued and practically applied. External
