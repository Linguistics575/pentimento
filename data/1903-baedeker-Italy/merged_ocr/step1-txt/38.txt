CLIMATE. xxvii

quent; and the humidity of the atmosphere, occasioned in part by
the numerous canals and riots-marshes, is also very considerable.
A prolonged residence in Turin or Milan should therefore be avoided
by invalids, while even robust travellers should be on their guard
against the trying climate. As we approach the Adriatic Sea the
climate of the Lombard plain loses its continental character and
approximates moreclosely to that of the rest of the peninsula. The
climatic peeuliarities of Venice are described at p. 264.

As soon as we cross the mountains which bound the S. margin
of the Lombard plain and reach the Mediterranean coast, we ttnd b
remarkable change in the climatic conditions. Here an almost uninterrupted series of winter-resorts extends along the Lig mien
Riviera as far B. as Leghorn, and these are rapidly increasing
both in number and popularity. The - or the mild and. pleasant climate at these places is not far to seek. The Maritime
Alps and the Ligurian Apennines form such an admirable screen
on the N., that the cold N. winds which pass these mountains do
not touch the district immediately at their feet, but are first perceptible on the eel 6-10 M. from the coast. It is of no unfrequent
occurrence in the Riviera that the harbours are perfectly smooth
while the open sea is agitated by a brisk tempest. Most of the towns
and villages on the coast lie in orestsent-shaped trays, opening
towards the 5., while on the landward side they are protected by
an amphitheatre of hills. These hills are exposed to the full force
of the sun's rays, and the limestone of which they are composed
absorbs an immense amount of heat. It is therefore not to be
wondered at that these hothouses of the Riviera show a higher temperature in winter than many places much farther to the S. Thus,
while the mean temperature of Rome in the three coldest months is.
MP Fahr., that of the Riviera is 48-50° (Newt W', San Remo 50°;
Pisa, on the other hand, only 42°).

It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that this strip of
coast is entirely free from wind. The rapid heating and cooling of
the strand produces numerous light breezes, while the rarefaction
of the mule! of air by the strength of the sun gives rise to strong
currents rushing in from the E. and W. to supply the vacuum.
The most notorious of these coast-winds is the Mistral, which is
at its went at Avignon and other places in the Rhone Valley (see
Baedeker's Southern France). The N.E. wind on the contrary
is much stronger in Alassio and Sun Remo than on the coast of
Provence. _ The Beiroeeo as known on the Ligurian. coast is by no
mean the dry and parching wind experienced in Sicily and even
at Rome; passing as it does over immense tracts of see, it is generally charged. with moisture and is often followed by rain.

The prevalent belief that the Riviera has a moist climate, on
account of its proximity to the sea, is natural but erroneous. The
atmosphere, on the contrary, is rather dry, especially in the W.
