246 Route 39. VICENZA. mm Verona

We now follow the Comrade di Riale to the W. to the Comrade
San Lorenzo, at the end of which, in the piazza of the same name,
stands the flne Gothic church of San Lorenzo (Pi. B, 2; 1280-1344),
containing the tomb of Burt. Montague (p. 243) and the Renaiso
sance mural monument of Leonardo Porto (d. 1562). - In front
of the church is a Statue of Giacomo Zanella (1820-88), the poet,
by C. Spazzi (1893)... e

In the S. pert of this street, known as the Oontrada Pozzo Rosso,
is (left) the Palazzo Valmamna (Pl. B, 2), by Palladio (1566).

In the W. part of the town is San Rocco (Pl. A 2), with a high-altarpiece by 20toneonMtrlio, cumming enthroned with M. Sebastian, Bernard,
Peter, and Paul, remarkable for its fine colouring (1502).

The route to the pilgrimage-aura of Madonna del Monte on
MONTE Bmuco (omnibus, 50 c.) is either through the Porta San
Giuseppe (before passing through which we observe the Pant: Ban
Michele, PL C, 3, crossing the Retrone, by Palladio); or to the right
from the railway station, past the Villa Arrigoni CPI. o, 4) and across
the railway, to the arcade leading to the church. This passage,
715 yds. long, was sharply contested in 1848 by Italian irregular
troops, who had fortified the hill with its villas, and the Austrians.
At the cross-roads (P1. 0, 5) a tine'View is obtained of the town and
the Venetian Alps. The church of Mona del Monte (Pl. C, 6), a
little further up, rebuilt in 1668 by Ag. Barella, is in the form of a
Greek cross with a dome. The present left transept was the original
church (1428); over the altar to the right of the high-eltar: Bart.
Montagna, *Pieth (1500), one of this master's chief works. The old
refectory of the monastery (shown by the sacristan) contains the Banquet of Gregory the Great by P. Verona: (1572), torn to pieces in
1848, but restored with the aid of the copy in the Pinaeoteea. Behind
the church is a monument to those who fell here in 1848; to the
right of it ie Il Genie dell' Iruurresione, a statue dedicated to them
by the municipio of Vicenza. Adjacent is the Trattoria del Belvedere.

From the ahove-mentioned cross-rosds a road leads to the B.
along the hill (comp. Pl. C, D, 5), from which a (2 min.) footpath diverges to the right, passing the Villa Fogazzaro and the Villa
Valmaranu (with frescoes by Tiepolo), to the famous, but now
dilapidated *Rotonda (now the Villa Zanini), which lies 10 min.
farther on, at the E. base of the Monti Berici. It is a square
building with Ionic colonnades surmounted with pediments. In the
centre is a circular domed hall. Visitors are generally admitted
(except on Sun.) by the door of the farm, to the right of the main
entrance (knock; fee 1/2 fr.). - The return is best made by the
same way as the arrival.

The Cimitero, to the NE. of the town (through the Borgo Seroffa,
P1. D, o, contains the tomb of Palladio (d. 1580).
