Genoa, Italian thmlfva, French Game, with 219,500 inhab., the
seat of a university and of an archbishop, and the headquarters of
the 4th Italian army corps, is a strong fortress and the chief oommereiel town in Italy. Its situation, rising above the see in a wide
semicircle, and its numerous palaces j ustly entitle it to the epithet
of'La Superba'. The old town is a. net-work of narrow and steep
streets, lined with many-storied buildings, but the newer quarters
have broad and straight thoroughfares. Since the 17th cent. Genoa
has been protected on the landward side by a rampart, over 9 M.
long, which extends from the large lighthouse on the W. side o. 82),
where the barracks of San Benigno afford quarters for 10,000 men,
past the Forte Begato (1620 ft.), to the Forte dello Sperone (1690 IL);
then descends past Forte Castelluccio (1250 ft.; view) into the valley
of the Bisagno, on the E. The heights around the town are crowned
with ten detached forts.

The beau.ty of its situation and the reminiscences of its enchant
glory render a visit to Genoa very attractive. Invalids, however,
must be on their guard in winter against the raw winds and the
abrupt changes of temperature.

From the earliest times Genoa hue been famous as e seaport, and t;
is believed to derive its name from the fact that the shape of t e can
here resembles that of a knee (mu). The Roman torm_of ita municipa.
government was maintained throughout the period of the barbarian ini
Vasions, when I Frankish feudal nobility sprang up alongside of the natiw
nobleese. The smaller towns on the Ligurian coast looked up to Genet
as their champion against the Saracens, who ravaged the countr fron
Frassineto (Fraxinet), and in 936 even plundered Genoa itself. In 1199
the Genoese waged war with varying success against Pisa, which threatena
its maritime commerce from the settlements on Corsica and Sardinia. I:
the following century the rival cities were almost permanently at we.
dawn to 1284, when the power of Pisa was shattered for ever in th
terrible navel battle at Meloria (p. 405). At a still earlier period 61311.05
had participated in the Crusades, and secured to herself l busy trade Wit:
the event She also possessed settlements at Constantinople, in Syn
and Cyprus, at Tunis and Majorca. The consequent rivalry of the Genoes
and Venetian; was a fruitful source of wars and feuds, which were nc
ended until the defeat of Genoa at the battle of Chioggia in 1380.
