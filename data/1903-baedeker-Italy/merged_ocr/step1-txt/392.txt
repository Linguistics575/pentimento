Vicenza (105 ft.), the ancient Vicetia, capital of I province and
see of a bishop, with 43,703 inhab., lies at theN. base of the Monti
Berici (p. 242), on both sides of the Bacchiglione, at its confr1enee with the Retrom. Although closely built, the town possesses
many interesting palaces, to which, with the picturesque environs,

a short visit may profitably be devoted.

Vicenza, like most or PAINTING, which, though it was strongly influenced
by Mantegna (born here in 1431, but active in Padua and Mantua alone),
i"and never produced mute" u the highest rank, yielded results of consider. able importance. The earliest master of note was Giovanni 8 drama, who,

however, was soon "used by Bartolomeo Mantegna (ca. 1 4523). The
gallery and the chute es (Cathedral, Santa Corona) of Vienna comm

' works by the latter. His compositions are strongly realistic, and he shows
a predilection for muscular figures, and for colouring of a rich brownish
tint. His drapery is ungrsceful, but, like that of Durex, boldly defined.
His chief works are the Pietit in the Museum (p. 245), and the
ladon- at Ban Rocco (p. 246). In the 16th cent. Vicenza lost its importance u a school of painting, but attained a high reputation in the
province of ARCHITECTURE, having given birth to Andrea Palladio (1518-80),
the last great architect of the Renaissance, the chief sphere of whose
operations was his native town. By his study of the antique in name he
was enabled to effect a revival of what may be termed the ancient language
of forms, and he made it his endeavour to exhibit in his buildings the
organic connection between the different members. The chief characteristic of his schooi consists in "studious adherence to impressive simplicity
of form, and a very sparing indulgence in the lavish enrichments in which
the early-Rensissence was too apt to revel. His flttegt churches are at
Venice (comp. p. 267), bat his most numerous palaces are at Vieenza, to
which they impart a uniform and handsome appearance.

We enter the town by the w. gate, Porta del Candle (Pl. B, 3).
Immediately to the right, on the S. side of the narrow Piazza del
Castello, is the Palasso Giulio Porto, formerly called Casa del Diavolo,
a large unfinished palace by Palladio, with two stories united by a
row of Corinthian columns with n rich cornice. To the left rises a
monument to Garibaldi by Ferrari, erected in 1887.

Near the statue, at the beginning of the 00350 PnINCIrB The.
BBBTO, which intersects the entire town, lies the Palasso Bantu,

Nari (P1. B, 3; 1719), stands the Palazzo Loschi (18th cent.. This Strade Loschi, the next cross-street on the right, leads to the
