xxxviii ITALIAN ART.

1y only, lies in the past; to conjure up this, and bring about
a Renaissance of the antique, appeal to be the goal of their
aspirations. They apply themselves to their task with calmness
and concentration, they indulge in no bold or novel schemes, but
are content to display their love of form in the execution of details.
What architecture as a whole loses in historical attraction is
compensated by the beauty of the individual edifieeg. While
the North possesses structures of greater importance in the development of art, Italy boasts of e far greater number of pleasing works.
There is hardly a district in Italy which does not boast of

interesting examples of Romanesque architecture. At Verona we
ROMAN- may mention the famous church of St. Zeno, with its sculpnsqun tured portals. In the same style are the cathedral: of Far..
thmrunms ram, Modena. Parma, and Piaeensa, the church of Sant' Ambrogio at Milan, with its characteristic fore-eourt and facade, and
that of San Michele "Pavia. Tuscany abounds with Romanesque
ediiioes. Among these the palm is due to the cathedral of Pisa, a
church of specious dimensions in the interior, superbly embellished
with its marble of two colours and the rows of columns on its facade.
To the same period also belong the neighbouring Leaning Tower and
the Baptistery. The churches of Lucca are copies of those It Plea.
Those of Florence, however, such as the octagonal, dome-eovered
Baptistery and the above-mentioned church of Sm Minister, exhibit
an independent style.

The position occupied by Italy with regard to Gothic architecture is thus rendered obvious. She could not entirely
ignore its inih1enee, although incapable of according en unconditional reception to this, the highest development o!
vault-etehiteeture. Gothic was introduced into Italy in a mature
and perfected condition. It did not of necessity, as in France,
develop itself from the earlier (Romanesque) style, its progress
cannot be traced step by step; it was imported by foreign architects
and adopted as being in consonence with the tendency of the age;
it found numerous admirers among the mendicant orders of monks
and the humbler classes of citizens, but could never quite disengage itself from Italianiising indiuemytm. It was so far transformed
that the constructive constituents of Gothic are degraded to e de.
corative offloe, and the national taste thus became reconciled to it,
The cathedral of Milan cannot be regarded as a fair specimen ol
Italian Gothic, but this style must rather be sought for in the
medieval cathedrals of Florence, Him, Orvieto, in the church of
San Petronio at Bologna, and in numerous secular tsdifleess, such
as the Loggia dei Land It Florence, the communal palaces o)
towns in Central Italy, and the palace. of Venice. An acquaintance
with true Gothic construction, so contracted notwithstanding all its
apparent richness, so exclusively adapted to practical requirements,
can certainly not be acquired from these cathedrals. The spacious
