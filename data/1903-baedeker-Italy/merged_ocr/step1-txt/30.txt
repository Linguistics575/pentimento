VIII. Cycling.

The environs of Milan, Turin, Verona, and Bologna, the neighbourhood of the Italian Lakes, and the Riviera all offer many attractions for the cyclist. The roads are good on the whole, though often
very dusty in summer (especially in the N. Italian plain) and
correspondingly muddy in wet weather. - English riders should

The unattached cyclist on entering Italy with his wheel must
deposit 42 fr. 60 c. with the eustom-house authorities, which sum
is returned to him (though sometimes not without difilou1tiet0, when

di scarico) should always be obtained, as otherwise the club of
