1/2 (L), begun by Palladio in 1579, completed in 1584, after his
death, by Scamozzi, and inaugurated by the performance of the
'Gldipms Tyrennue' of Sophocles. Pelladio adhered generally to the
precepts of Vitruvius as to the construction of ancient theatres, but
the building is far from being a mere imitation. The auditorium
rises In thirteen tsemi-oral tiers, while the orchestra and the twostoried stage lie 5 ft. below the level of the seats. The three dooropenings at the back of the stage afford view: of ascending streets,
in curiously deceptive relief.

The Contrada di Santa Corona, diverging just before the E. and
of the Corso, leads to the Dominican church of Santa. Corona (PI.
