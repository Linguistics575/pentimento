The entire quarter between the Piazza Bordello and the Lego
Inferiore is occupied by the spacious Reggie, or Code Beale
(Pl. D, 2), origimlly a palace of the Bonaeolsi (1302), afterwards
frequently added to by the Gonzagae, but now in great part unoccupied. The original Gothic facade, with its bettlemente, is still
in good preservation. The original splendour of the palace is still
represented in the apertments of Isabelle d'Wte (p. 236) as well
as id those altered for Federico n. in 1525-81 by Giulio ROW.
