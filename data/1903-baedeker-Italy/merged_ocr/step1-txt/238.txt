'The firte.tt1tiMs11ed features (of the lady), extremely pure in drawing,
Charm by their mild expression. A delicate but healthy com lexion is
displayed in warm sweet tones of extraordinary trunsParence; an masterly
transitions lead the eye from opal lights into rich and coloured shadows.
A half length in the same collection represents a. men of law and bony
make with l swallow-ttruse beard, a grey eye, close set features, and a
grave aspect.... A third half length, companion to these, offers another
vuiety of type and execution. A man stands at a. table in a pelisse with
a fox akin collar; he is bare-headed and bearded. His right hand rests
on the table and grips e handkerchief. The ruddy aim of the face is
broken with touches now warm now cold by which the play of light and
rslleMioa8 is rendered with deceptive truth'. - th It J.
