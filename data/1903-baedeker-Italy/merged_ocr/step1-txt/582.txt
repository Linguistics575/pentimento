the capital of a province, the seat of the Royal Marine Academy,
and the most important commercial place in Italy after Genoa, is
indebted for its size and importance to the Medici, who invited
hither the oppressed and discontented from all parts of the continent, as, for example Roman Catholics from England, Jews and
Moore from Spain and Portugal, and merchants from Marseilles, who
were anxious to escape from the perils of civil war. Montesqnieu
