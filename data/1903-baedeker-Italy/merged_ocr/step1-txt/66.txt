and painting. Nor is an inspection of this illustrious master's
works calculated to dispel the doubt. Unnatural and arbitrary
features often appear in juxtaposition with what is perfect, profoundly tsignificant, and faithfully conceived. As in the case of
Leonardo, we shall find that it is only by studying the master's biography that we can obtain an explanation of these anomalies, and
reach a. true appreciation of Michael Angelo's artistic greatness.
Educated as a sculptor, he exhibits partiality to the nude, and
treats the drapery in many respects differently from his professional
brethren. But, like them, his aim is to inspire his figures with life,
and he seeks to attain it by imparting to them an imposing and impressive character. At the same time he occupies an isolated position,
at variance with many of the tendencies of his age. Naturally predisposed to melancholy, concealing a gentle and almost effeminate
temperament beneath a mask of austerity, Michael Angelo was con1rmtsil in his peculiarities by the political and ecclesiastical circumstances of his time, and wrapped himself up within the depths of
his own absorbing thoughts. His sculpture most clearly manifests
that profound sentiment to which, however, he often traerifieed symmetry of form. His figures are therefore anomalous, exhibiting a
grand conception, but no distinct or tangible thoughts, and least of
all the traditional ideas. It is diffleu1t now to fathom the hidden
sentiments which the master intended to embody in his statues and
pietures; his imitators seem to have seen in them nothing but massive
and clumsy form s, and soon degenerated into meaningless mannerism.
The deceptive effect produced by Michael Angelo's style is best extsmpliiitsd by some of his later works. His Mans in San Pietro in
Vineoli is of impossible proportions; such a man can never have
existed; the small head, the huge arms, and the gigantic torso are
utterly disproportionate' the robe which falls over the celebrated
knee could not be folded as it is represented. Nevertheless the
work is grandly impressive; and so also are the Monuments of the
Medici in the New Sacristy of Ban Lorenzo "Florence (p. 600),
in spite of the forced attitude and arbitrary moulding of some of
the "urea. Michael Angelo only tsaerifletsts accuracy of detail in
order to enhance the aggregate effect. Had so great and talented a
mater not presided over the whole, the danger of an inflated style
would have been incurred, the forms selected would have been
exaggerated, and a professional mannerism would have been the
result. Michael akngelo's numerous pupils, in their anxiety to
follow the example of his Last Judgment in the Sistine, succeeded
only in representing complicated groups of unnaturally foreshortened nude Mures, while Baccio 1hrm1ine11i, thinking even to surpass
Michael Angelo, produced in his group of Hercules and Cam: (in
the Piazza della Signoria at Florence) a mere caricature of his model.

Michael Angelo lived and worked at Florence and Rome alternately. We tind him already in Rome at the age of 21 years (1496),
