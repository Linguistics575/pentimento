restored and fitted up as the Mmeo diSan Marco (Adah, see p. 487;

by'M1vestrtms' monks, but was transferred under Cosimo the Elder
to the Dominicans, who were favoured by the Medici. In 1437-43
it was restored in a handsome style from designs by Mielietosso,
and shortly afterwards it was decorated by Fra Giovanni Angelica
da Finale (1387-1465) with those charming I" Frescoes which to this
day are unrivalled in their portrayal of profound and devoted piety.

in this monastery from 1500 and the powerful preacher Girolamo
8avonarola (burned "the stake in 1498, see p. 442) also once
