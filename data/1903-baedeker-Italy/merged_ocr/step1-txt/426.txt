The "Pins: of St. Ink CPI. G, ti), usually called'La Piassa',
a square paved with trachyte and marble, 192 yds. in length, on
the. side 61, and on the E. 90 ro. in breadth, affords the most
striking evidence of the ancient glory of Venice. On three sides it
is enclosed by imposing buildings, which appear to form one vast
marble palace, blackened by age and the elements; on the E. it is
bounded by the Church of St. Mark and the Piazzetta (p. 275). The
palaces on the N. and S. Mile were once the residence of the nine
'protsuratom', the highest otfuialty of the Republic after the Doge,
whence their name Procuretre. The Proeuratie Vccchie, or N. wing,
were erected in 1480-1517 by Pietro Lombardo, Bartolomeo Bums
the Younger, and Guglielmo Bergamaaeo. The Procuratic Nuove, or
S. wing, begun by Scamozzi in 1584, together with the adjoining
building (formerly the Library, p. 276), now form the Palasso Beale,
and contain handsome modern apartments with ancient and modern
pictures (adm., see p. 265; entrance in the Piazzetta). The eduiee
on the W. side, the Atrio,'or Nuova Fabbrica, was erected in 1810,
ptrtly on the site of the church of Sen Geminiano. The grounMoors
of these structures consist of arcades, and contain the cafes and shops
mentioned at pp. 260, 263.

beau new life in every direction, through an intricate system of
streets and canals, that bring it back again to the same eentre'
(Howells). On summer-evenings all who desire to-enjoy fresh air
congregate here. The scene is liveliest when the military band plays
(almost daily, 83040.30), and possesses a charm all its own. In
winter the band plays on the same days, 2.30-4.30 p.m., and the
Piazza is then a fashionable promenade. By moonlight the piazza
is strikingly impressive.
