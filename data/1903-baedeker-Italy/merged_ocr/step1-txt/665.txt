beru, and the same by Fit. Bruneueeehi, the earliest Renaissance
sculptures, produced in their competition for the execution of the
gates of the Baptistery (p. 451). The composition of Ghiberti is
the less harmonious but the calmer of the two. Its dignified draped
ilgr1rets, especially that of Isaac, are full of a true antique feeling
for beauty, while in Brunelleschi's relief the principal flgurets are
represented in violent movement, and Isaac is besides remarkably
ugly. The subordinate ilguretr, including the ram, are also in positions of ovtT-titrain.tsd activity. In technical execution Ghiberti is
superior. 14, 15. CJrueitixion (relief) and a small Frieze of children
