Custom House. The summation of luggage at the Italian
frontier railway-tstations is generally lenient, but complaints are
sometimes made as to a deheieney of ofilttia1 courtesy at diligence
and steamer stations. Tobacco and cigars (only six pass free), playing
cards, and matches are the articles ehietly sought for. A duty of
30 e. per kilogramme (2t/elU) is levied on unexposed photograph
plates. The custom-house receipts should be preserved, as travellers
are sometimes challenged by the excise trftteis18 in the interior. At
the gates of most of the Italian towns a tax (dado comma) is levied
on comestibles, bat traveller! luggage is passed at the barrier: (limite
dasiario) on a simple declaration that It contains no such articles.

Luggage. If possible, luggage should never be sent to Italy
by goods-train, as it is liable to damage, pilferage,' and undue
custom-house detention. If the traveller is obliged to forward it in
this way, he should employ a trustworthy agent at the frontier and
send him the keys. As a rule it is advisable, and often in the end
less expensive, never to part from one's luggage, and to superintend the custom-house examination in person (comp. p. xviii).
