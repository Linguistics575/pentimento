early period, as for example at Athens and In Germany, where numerous
discoveries of ancient Etruscan Iron-work have been made. The artof
navigation was simultaneously developed. The earliest naval battle in
the western part of the Mediterranean handed down by tradition (about
B.0. 637), was fought between the Greeks and Etruscan for the pom
Ion of Corsica, and resulted in the victory of the latter, who thus obtained
supremacy over the sea still known as the Tyrrhenian. The League
of the Etruscan Towns, which extended from the footer the Alps to the
Bay of Naples was also instrumental in promoting civilisation, as it we

The Etruscan Museum at Florence flrat airorda mi hh opportunity of
becoming acquainted with the artistic products of this ancient people in
bronze and earthenware, and obtaining an insight into their gloomy and
realistic disposition. At Fiesole our attention will then be directedto
the huge stone structures erected by the Etruscans to defend their frontier
against the predatory Liguriana of the Apennines. The connection
between antiquity and modern times is not very apparent in this part of
the country, as the classic soil of Etrnria lies somewhat to the 8. of the
limits prescribed to the present Handbook. None of the twelve gm!
cities which divided among them the supremacy over the whole country
lay .on the Arno; and the beautiful valleys which now delight the eye of
the traveller, being exposed to the continual incursions of the Liguriant
were marshy and desolate down to the 3rd cent. B. C., and did not
prosper till the time of the Romans. The history of the eneientstm
clns mey nevertheless appropriately be kept in view. If Florence forcibly
reminds the visitor at every step that modern Italy owes its noblest upirations and richest intellectual inheritance to this city and this land, the
student of history will be interested in remembering that the same offtee of
disseminatin civilisation among their compatriots was performed by the
Etruscans years before the modern development of the country.
The power of the ancient Etruscans attained its zenith in the 6th
eent BAM, but owing to the want of political coherence in their widely
ramitled confederation, they were unable permanently to maintain their
supremacy. As the whole of N. Italy had been conquered by the Gem.
and Campania by the Samnites (in MO, so the Romans and Latins from
the lower Tiber gradually encroaehed on Etrnria, and after protracted
struggles wrested city after city from the confederation. In the 3rd cent
the entire country thus became subject to the authority of Rome. By
the establishment of numerous colonies, and abundant grants of the
Roman citizenship, the country was gradually Latinised, and the Etruscfl
language, which has been handed down to he in levanl thowd mu
nhdeeiphered imsisriptiurus, was superseded by Latin. Some of the
peculiarities of the Tuscan dialect, such as the slight aspiration of the a
before a (chase for case), are thought to be referable to the old 1artgrug0
of the country, but this is matter of mere Minimum. The teiveuar
