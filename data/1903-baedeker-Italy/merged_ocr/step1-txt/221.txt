110 LOMBARDY.

The name of the Germanic tribe that invaded Italy in NB is now
applied to the country between the Alps and the Po, which is separated
from Piedmont by the thino, end from Venetia by the Iincio. It in
divided into the eight province: of Coma Hanna, Pavia, Sondn'o, Bergamo, Cremona, Brucm sad unmea, cove "an area of about 8000 MI. IL,
and containing 3,718,300 inhabitants. The name was Once applied to a
much luger tract. Lombardy hes not ina tly been likened to an
artichoke, the leaves of which were eaten o in succession by the lords
of Piedmont; thus in 1427 they appropriated Vercellt, in 1531 Anti, M103
VII Beak, in 1706 A1trsatuti1rits, in 1786 Tortone and Novara, and in 1743
Domodoasola. The heart of the country, if we continue to me the

the Ticino, Po, and Adda. The three zones of cultivation are the same
as in Piedmont) m. the region of pastures among the mountains, that
of the vine, fruit-treee, end the IilkAenlture on the lower undulating
country and the slopes adjoining the Met, and that of wheat, main,
and meadows in the plains, the yield of these last being, however, In
more abundant than in Piedmont. The climate of Lombardy is thoroughly
continental: winter in the plains, which are scourged by bitter winds, is
very cold (minimum at Milan, 1.4' Fahr.) and abounds in snow and mist

In the height of summer rain is rare beyond the lower Alps, and mu
more frequently when the wind is from the E. than from the W., um
moisture of the letter is absorbed by the Maritime Alps and the Apenninea;
but a thorough eyetem of irrigation, without a parallel in any other part
of Europe, prevails here, so that a failure of the crops is hardly possible. In
the middle ages the importance of Milan was due to ill Woollen Industrial,
but sheep-breeding has in modern times been largely superseded by m
'ilk-mire, In industry which has so materially increased the wealth of
the country, that it used to be said during the Austrian regime that the
army and the others lived on mulberry leaves, an their produce alone
truffietsd to pay the land taxes. Under these circumstances the population
is unusually dense, being about 380 persons to the sq. mile, or only a
little less dense than in Liguria end empem't.
