This district Ut the foot of the mountains', enclosed on three sides
by the Alps and Apennines, and separated from Lombardy by the Tum,
embraces, according to the present division, the provinces of Turin, Arotara, thmeo, and Alessandria, with 3,233,000 inhab., and an area of shout
11AM sq. M. It consists of lowlands flanking the banks of the Po and its
tributaries, which yield rice, wheat, and maize, and of highlands where excellent wine and silk are produced, and lastly of th blanket mountain
region of forests and pastures. The earliest INHABITANTS were Celtic and
Edwin tribes, who were but slowly influenced by Roman culture; and
it was not till the reign of Augustus that the subjugation of the higher
Valleys was completed. The DIALECT of the people still retains traces of
heir Ancient at 11in with the French; thus, palm, instead of the Italian
Pmm, om for uomo, cheur for more, sild for cma, rason for ragione,
Piaua for piazza. This main is universally spoken, even by the upper
classes, but is unintelligible to strangers. Throughout Piedmont, however,
French is very generally understood.
