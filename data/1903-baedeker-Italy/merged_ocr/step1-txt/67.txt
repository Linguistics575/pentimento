lvi ITALIAN ART.

M Florence, after the banishment of the Medici, offered no favourable field for the practice of art. Here he ehiselled the Find and
the Bacchus. In the beginning of the 16th cent. he returned to his
home, where he produced his David and began work on the cycle
of frescoes destined for the great hall of the Palazzo Vecchio
(Battle Cartoon, see p. 446). In 1505 the Pope recalled him to
Rome, but the work entrusted to him there, the Tomb of Julius II.,
was at this time little more than begun. The Ceiling Painting: in
the Sistine Chapel absorbed his whole attention from 1508 to 1612.
After the death of Julius, his monument was resumed on I more
extensive scale. The commands of the new pope, Leo X., however,
who wished to employ the artist for the glorKeation of his own
family, soon brought the smbitiously designed memorial once more
to a standstill. From 1516 onwards Michael Angelo dwelt "Gerrara
and Florence, occupied at tlrst with the construction and tsmhe11Uhment of the Facade of San Lorenzo, which was never completed,
and then with the Tombs of the Medici. This work also advanced
very slowly towards maturity, and at last the artist, disgusted with
the tyranny of the Medici, set up in their places those of the statues
which were finished, and migrated to Rome (about 1534). Hie ttrst
work here was the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, his next
the erection of the scanty fragments of the tomb of Pope Julius.
His last years were mainly devoted to architecture (St. Peter' a).
Amateurs will best be enabled to render justice to Michael
Angelo by ilrgt devoting their attention to his earlier works,
among which in the province of sculpture the group of the Fiat!
'in St. Peter's occupies the highest rank. The statues of Bacchus
and David (at Florence; pp. 473, 493) likewise do not transgress
the Customary precepts of the art of the Renaissance. Paintings of
Michael Angelo's earlier period are rare; the finest, whether conceived in the midst of his youthful studies, or in his mature: years,
is unquestionably the ceiling-painting in the Sistine. The architectural arrangement of the ceiling, and the composition of the several
pictures are equally masterly; the taste and discrimination of the
painter and sculptor are admirably combined. In God the Father,
Michael Angelo produced a perfect type of its kind; he understood how to inspire with dramatic life the abstract idea of the
act of creation, which he conceived as motion, In the prophets and
sihyls, notwithstanding the apparent monotony of the fundamental
intention (foreshadowing of the Redemption), b great variety of
psychological incidents are displayed and embodied in distinct
eharaettsrs.Lustly, in the so-oelled Ancestors of Christ, the forms
represented are the genuine emanations of Michael Angelo' s genius,
pervaded by his profound and sombre sentiments, and yet'by no
means destitute of gracefulness and beauty. The decorative iigTtrms
also which he designed to give life to his architectural frame-work
are wonderfully beautiful and spirited. The Last Judgment, which
