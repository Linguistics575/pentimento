The Eremitani (P1. D, 3), an old Augustine church of the
middle of the 13th cent, restored in 1880, is a long building with
printed vaulting of wood, containing'Frescoes by Andrea Mantegna and his contemporaries of the school of Squarcione, which
are among the most important examples of Northern Italian art.

By the entrance-wall are two painted altars of terracotta, probably by
htm Kindle, that to the right with a fresco of 1611. On the right and
"Cerrare (1838-45) and
hreopo (u mum) da Carrara (1345-50), by Andriola dm' Sann' of Venice,
brought hither from the church of Sant' Agostino (pulled down in 1520),
by the Florentine B. Ammanati.

0n the walls of the ihrom are poor frescoes, ascribed to t7uariento..
Astronomical representations, Scenes from the life of St. Augustine (repainted), etc. - In the chapel to the right of the high-altar: Guariento O,
Coronation of the Virgin. - Swmsrr (entrance from the choir, to the
left): Guido Bmi, John the Baptist. _

The CAPPELLA SANT! Jacopo It Curaxorosur, adjoining the right trensept,
is embellished with celebrated frescoes, now damaged, yet still very attractive, with ornamentation showing the indebtedness of the School of
Martin: to its study of the antique. The Evangelists on the ceiling are
the poorest, and probably the earliest part of the work. The four upper
sections on the well on the right are also by inferior artists: the two
highest scenes, representing St. J smes as s. worker of miracles, and St. J emes
befo're the king, are by In unknown muster (Marco Zappa U; the St.
Christopher with the Infant Christ is by Born) of Ferrara; the adoration
of the giant saint (central section on the right) is by Amm'no da For". The
paintings on the wall and vaulting of the recess" of the choir are by Nie.
told Pinata, an able Paduen, who died young. By far the most important
are the'Pietures with which Andrea Mantegna completed the cycle between 1153 and 1469. The left wall present: to us the life of St. James
from his cell to his execution. The lower scenes exhibit greater ability
and maturity than the upper, so that we an almost trace the muter'a
Progress step by step. The Execution and Burial of St. Christopher, the
lowest pictures on the right well, subsequently added by Mantegna, are
sadly injured. - The large terracotta tr1tai-relief of the Madonna and saints
is by om. da ma, a pupil of Donatello o. 248), but his bean spoiled by
a modern coat of paint.

On the N. side of the piazza in front of the church is the
entrance (h battlemented iron gate; if closed, ring; adm. 9-4, 1 fr.;
holidays 9-2, 20 o.; on certain high festivals, free) to the
Madonna. dell' Arena (Pl. D, 3), situated in an oval garden
which shows the outlines of an ancient amphitheatre. The chapel,
oblong in form, was erected by Ã©lerovegno in 1303. Its walls and
vaulting are completely covered with a series of "Frescoes by
Giotto, most of them well preserved (restored by Betti). The period
of their execution is determined by the fact that Dante and Giotto
met It Patina in 1306 (comp. pp. xl et seq.). Morning-light best.
Catalogues are provided for the use of visitors.

These frescoes represent the Blame: or ran Tmam AND Cnms'r, from
.the apocryphal Proto-Evangelium and the New Testament and end, accordmg to ancient custom, with the LAST JUDGMENT, painted on the entrance
wall. The lower part of this last work, much injured, was probably execated chiefly by Giotto's pupils, but the master-hand is revealed in the
youthful Christ at the top, surrounded by apostles, angels, and saints.

The Paintings on the side-walls are arranged in four rows, one above
another. The Urrmmosw Row (beginning to the right of the ehoir-ave10
