the former church of the barefooted friars, begun in 1649 by
Longhena, with a tine facade
added by' Sardi in 1683-89,
is perhaps the most imposing
specimen of the Venetian baroque
style. It was much damaged by
the bombardment 011849, but was
restored in 1853-62.

The ceiling is decorated with a.
large fresco by Tiepolo, representing
the miraculous removal of the house
of the Virgin to Loreto. The high »
altar, by Git". Pane, with its eight

first floor (Antony and Cleopatra). - Farther on, to the left, is the

Pal. Manfrin, formerly celebrated for its picture gallery.

Opposite, on the right side of the canal, is the Ghetto Vecchio
(PI. D, E, 2), with its high, many-storied houses, long the quarter

Tempio Iaraelitieo Spagnuolo (Pl. E, 2), or synagogue of the Spanish
