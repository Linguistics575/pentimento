Padua (40 ft.), Ital. Padifoa, Lat. Patavium, the capital of a
province and see of a bishop, with 81,142 inhab., lies on the Bar
chiglione, which flows through it in several branches. Its tortuous
streets are generally flanked with low and narrow'2'ortief or atcadee, but some of the chief thoroughfares have been widened by
the removal of the portiei. The outer quarters consist largely of
gardens. Some of the numerous bridges over the different arms of
the river date from the Roman period. Excellent drinking-water is
brought from the neighbourhood ofDuevi1le, in the Euganean Bills.

Padua traces its origin to Autumn, the mythical King of Troy, brother
of Prism, and under Augustus was the wealthiest town in Upper Italy..
All the ancient monuments were afterwards destroyed during the .imp.i,"
gration of the barbarian hordes. In the middle ages the town sided with
the Guelphs, and in 1318 it appointed Jacopo da Carrara to the SignorlaThe princes of this family were much herraeaed by the Scales of Verona
and the republic of Venice and at length succumbed in um, when Padua
wee annexed to Venetia. Viii University, founded by Bishop Giordano in
1222, and extended by Emp. Frederick 11. in 1288, rendered Padua a. very
famous seat of learning throughout the middle ages.

In the HISTORY or A31 Padua is also an important place, its reputation as the chief seat of [ mini learning having attracted many artists. The
Florentine masters Giotto, Paolo Uccello, Era Filippo Lippi, end Donate":
