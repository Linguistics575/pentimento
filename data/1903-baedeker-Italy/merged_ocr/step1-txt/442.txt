Apicture by Boccaccio Boeeaeeino (Room XVII, No. 600), a littleknown master of the earlier school, is one of the best of that period.
Palma Vecchio is represented here by one of his best works, a
recently acquired Holy Family (R. VII). Rocco jlfareoni'a Descent
from the Gross (R. Y, No. 166) is one of his fintytst efforts. Titian',
masterpiece, the Assumption of the Virgin (B. T No. 40), requires
_ no comment; the glowing rupture of the apostles, the jubilant
delight of the angels, the beaming bliss of the Madonna, and the
mgnithstsmse of the colouring cannot fail to strike the eye of every
beholder. The galtery comprises also the last, uncompleted creation
of this master: the Piste in R. X (No. 400). His Presentation in
, the Temple (R. XX, No. 626) is also very attractive owing to the
spirited grouping and the beauty of the individual figures. Boni. fazio L's wealth of colour is displayed in the Story of Dives (R. X,
' No. 291), the Measure of the Innocents (R. X, No. 319), end his
small Madonna (R. X, No. 269). The Miracle of St. Mark (R. II,
' No. 42) by Jacopo Tintoretto, and the Supper in the house of Levi
I (E IX, No. 203) by Paolo Veronesc, are specially interesting.
