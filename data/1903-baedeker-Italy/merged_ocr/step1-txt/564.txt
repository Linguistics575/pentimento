Ravcnna (13 ft.), formerly the capital of a province, now largely
deserted, with 63,364 inhsb., is situated in the plain between the
rivers Lemons and Ram (the Roman Bedais), in a somewhat unhealthy district. It was originally a town on the Lagune and a seeport, like Venice, but is now 6 M. distant from the sea and is connected with Porto Corsini, its foreport (founded in 1736), by the
Canals Corsini only, a narrow channel, beginning "the small new

Revenue, one of the most ancient towns in Italy, probably owes its
earliest importauee to the invasion of Italy by the Celts, when the Umbriena and Etruscens mstsing from the mainland to the Legune, settled
here. It was en ml, ally of the Romans, but as e punishment for
espousing the emu M Indus it was ineorporated with Gsllia Giselpina,
and sank to the level of a provincial town. Augustus was the tlrat to
recognize the advantageous situation of Bevenne. He "Urged the Perms
Chuiia till it could accommodate 260 sail, and appointed it the headquarters of the Adriatic fleets, an ersenel and mge "ip-building yuan

while the industrial suburb of Caesarea sprang up on the Wa Gaesarea,

by the deposits of the rivers. Revenue and Classis were both surrounds
by walls. The situation of Revenue was, however, still regarded as so
impregnable that in 402, amid the dangers of the barbarian invasion, the
Bap. Honorius transferred his residence thither from Rome. In the reign
of his sister trams Plum (d. MO, widow of the Visigothic king Athaulf

brilliant imperial city was erected into In nrehiephcupll m. According
to the legend, Christianity had been introduced in M A.D., by St. Apollisaris, a disciple of St. Peter. After the fall of the Western Empire the
town was taken by the Herulisn Odoaoer, King of Italy, and again in

Gothic kings till 539. It then became the sent of the exerch or governor
of the Eastern Roman or Greek Emperor ], but in spite of the numerous
privileges lavished on its church by Justinian and his successors, it fell
rapidly into decay. The Lombards used the town of Classis to the ground,
and in 751 their duke Ammph banished Eutychius, the last exerch, and
took possession of Revenue. Shortly afterwards, however, it was retaken
by Pepin, Ring of the Franks, and handed over to the pope, along with
the whole of the former exarehate (755). The papal rule was at Brst
entirely nominal, for the archbishop, who assumed the title of exarchs,
also succeeded in making themselves masters of a great part of the
Romagna. At I later period Revenue was usually to be found on the side
of the German emperors. In 1297 the Ghibelline Polenta family, of whom
favourable mention is made by Dante, obtained the supreme power, and
in 1318 they added also the title of duke. In 1441 Revenue came into
possession of the Venetiens, under whom its prosperity materially increased;

of Revenue. (p. 395), it was plundered by the victorious French may and
