The quaint and picturesque Panto thio (Pl. D, 6; pp. 445,
448), over which the covered passage mentioned "p. 468 is carried,
forms the most direct communication between the Piazza della
Signoria, with the Trfflzi, and the Palazzo Pitti. The bridge is
flanked with shops, which have belonged to the goldsmithe since
the 14th century. A bronze bust of Benvenuto Cellini (1500-72;

The line of the Ponte Vecchio is continued by the Tra me' GU10cnnmm (Pl. D, 6), which passes a small piazza adorned with a column dating from the 14th century. On the S. side of the piazza is
the old church of Santa Fclicitd (Pl. D, 6), restored in 1736 and
containing 1; Madonna with saints by Taddeo Gaddi (4th altar to the
right). At the end of the street, to the left (No. IT), is situated
the Palazzo thsieeiardini, where the historian Francesco Guiccierdini (1482-1540) lived; opposite to it, on the right (No. 16),
is the Cam Campigli or house of Machiavelli (15th cent; lately
'restored').

The'Pelazzo Pitti (P1. 0, 6), conspicuously situated on tht
slope of the Boboli hill, was designed by Brunelle8ehi about 1440
and begun by Luca Framed", by order of Luce Pitti, the powerful
opponent of the Medici, whom he hoped to excel in extend
grandeur by the erection of the most imposing palace yet built by
a private citizen. The failure of the conspiracy against Piero iid
Medici in 1466 cost Luce the lane of his power and intiuenee, and

cent., when it had come, through a great-grandson of Luca, into
the possession of Eleonora, wife of Duke Cosimo I. (1549). The
palace, which somewhat resembles a castle or a prison, is remarkable
for its bold simplicity, and the unadorned blocks of stone are hewn

facade is 119 n. high and was originally only of the width of the
present top story. About the year 1568 Bartolomeo Ammanati
inserted the beautiful Renaissance windows of the grounMoor, and
added the waterspouts in the form of lions' heads. In 1658-70 he
constructed the large colonnaded court, which is adjoined by s grotto
with niches and fountains, and the Boboli Garden beyond them.
The wings of the palace were added by Alf. Parigi after 1620,
