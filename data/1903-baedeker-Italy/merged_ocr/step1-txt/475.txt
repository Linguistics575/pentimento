Campagna: lest alter, Martyrdom of St. Lucia by Leandra Baum; monument of the Doge Harcantonio Memo id. 1616).

An easy ascent on 32 inclined planes leads from the choir to
the summit of the Campanile (before ascending, enquire whether
the door at the top is open), which commands perhaps the best
'Wrrw of the city and the Lagune. .--The Dominican monastery,
to which the church belonged, is now an artillery barrack and arsenal.

The adjoining island of Giudecca (steamboat, see p. 261; returning in about half-an-hour on the way back) is separated from the
mainland by the Giudecca Canal, which is 1 M. long and nearly
1/4 M. wide at its widest part.

On this island stands the formerly Franciscan church of the
*Bedent√©re (St. Saviour's; Pl. F, 8), begun in 1577 by Palladia
but not finished until 1592, a much vaunted tsdiflas, tshiefly interesting in the interior.

i. A visit to the Lido, which is specially animated during the
bathing-season, is the favourite excursion from Venice. Steamboat,
see p. 262; the last steamboat leaves the Lido in winter a little before sunset (previous enquiries advisable). A gondola takes at least
1/2 hr. (two gondoliers desirable at all times and necessary in wind).

From Santa Maria Elisabetta, the 1sndirtg-puise Chotel-restaurants, Pl. 2, 3, 4, see p. 262), a road (tramway) runs across the island
in 8 min. to the Bathing Establishment (p. 262) and the Gr. Hot. des
Buns (Pl. i;' 262). The set-baths at the establishment are frequented by Italians in summer, but in spring and autumn almost

taken to the S.W., past the Ospizio Marine and the dismantled F orte
Quattro Fontam, to (11/4 hr.) Malamocco (p. 321). - The N. end

the fort of S. Niccolo is the Old Protestant Cemetery, with the grave
