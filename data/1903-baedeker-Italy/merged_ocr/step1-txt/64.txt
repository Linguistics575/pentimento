much interest from having exercised a marked inf1uenety on the
German masters Holbein and Diirer, and surpass all the other works

(p. 222). - The earlier masters of the Venetian School (VIVABINI,

which Mantegna belonged, but the peculiar Venetian style, mainly
founded on local characteristics, and admirably successful in its rich
portraiture of noble and dignified personages, was soon afterwards
