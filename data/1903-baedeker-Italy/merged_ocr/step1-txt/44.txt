ITALIAN ART. xxxiii

their ARCHITECTURE. Independently of the Greeks, the ancient Italian
undone, and with them the Romans, had acquired a knowledge of
stomr-eutting, and discovered the method of constructing arches
and vaulting. With this technically and seientifieally important
In they aimed at combining Greek forms, the column supporting
the entablature. The sphere of architecture was then gradually extended. One of the chief requirements was now to construct adid1ees
with spacious interiors, and several stories in height. No precise
model was afforded by Greek architecture, and yet the current
Greek forms apptstmstrtoo beautiful to be lightly disregarded. The
Romans therefore preferred to combine them with the arch-principle, and apply this combination to their new architectural designs.
The individuality of the Week orders, and their originally TInalterable coherence were thereby saeriileei1, and divested of much
of their importance; that which once possessed a daf1nite organic
sigrtifietsnets frequently assumed a tsuperficial and decentive chenoter; but the aggregate effect is always imposing. Attention must be
directed to the several-storied structures, in which the tasteful as-.
tending gradation of the component parts, from the more massive
(Doric) to the lighter (Corinthian), chiefly arrests the eye; and the
vest and artistically vaulted interiors, as well as the structures of a
merely decorative description, must also be examined, in order that
the chief merits of Roman art may be understood. In the use of
columns in front of closed walls (6.9. as members of a facade), in
the construction of domes above circular interiors, and of cylindrical
and grained vaulting over oblong spaces, the Ronian edifleeg have
served as models to posterity, and the imitations have often fallen
short of the originals.

It is true that 111 the districts to which this volume of the issr.
book is devoted, the splendour and beauty of ancient art is not so
prominently illustrated as in Rome or B. Italy. Nevertheless N.
I Italy also contains many interesting relics of Roman architecture
[ such as the Amphitheatre at Verona, the Triumphal Arches at Aosta
and Susa, etc.), and the traveller .will find ample food for his admiration in the antique sculptures in the collections at Turin, Breach,
Mantua, and Florence. - Upper Italy and Tuscany stand, on the
other hand, in the very forefront of the artistic life of the middle
ages and early Renaissance, and Venice may boast of having brilliant. lr unfolded the glories of Italian painting at a time when that art
lad sunk It Rome to its nadir. In order, however, to place the
reader at a proper point of view for appreciating the development
of at in N. Italy, it is necessary to give a sketch of the progress
of Italian art in general from the early middle ages onwards.

In the 4th century the heathen world, which had long been in

new period of art began. This is sometimes erroneously re- Pump
