severity of style The chief work of his early period is in the church
of the Eremitani. A distinguishing characteristic of the school is its

doubtless supplied abundant models. V

From the Main Railway Station (Pl. D, I) we follow the tramway-line through the Barriers. Mazzini and across the piazza of that
name (P1. c, 2) to the (6 min.) centre of the town. - In the adjoining szu PBTRARCA rises a monument to Petrarch, erected
