average expenditure of a single traveller, apart from railway-fares,

a prolonged stay is made at one place; but persons acquainted with
the language and habits of the country may easily restrict their expenses to still narrower limits. Those who travel as members of a
party effect a considerable saving by sharing the expense of guides,
carriages, and other items. When ladies are of the party, the expenses are generally greater.

ltr. 25 c. == 1 a. (comp. p. ii). In copper (bronzo or rame) there are
wine of I, 2, 5, and 10 centeaimi, and in nickel pieces of 20 and
40 c. In silver there are pieces of i, 2, and 5 fr., but coins issued
before 1863 are refused. The gold coins (10, 20, 50, and 100 fr.)
