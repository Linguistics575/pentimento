Brescia (460 ft), capital of a province and see of a bishop,
with 69,210 inhab., is beautifully situated at the foot of the Alps,
and its numerous fountains of limpid water lend it an additional
charm. Iron wares, and particularly weapons, form the staple commodities, many of the fire-arms used by the Italian army being made
here. The woollen, linen, and silk factories also deserve mention.

Brescia is noteworthy in the history of art as the birthplace or
Alamo mane, mrnamed t1 Moreno t1t98-ilBl5J, who appears to have
studied exclusively at his native place, and whose teacher is said to have
been Floriano Ferramola of Brescia. He has been classed with the Venn!"
school, but erroneously, for nearly all the school: of the'Terra Ferm'
have had an independent development; and, like the Veronese masterlt
he is distinguished from that school by the comparative soberness of
his colouring ('subdued silvery tone'), although he vies with the Venetians in richness and briliitrmsy, while he sometimes reveals a full measure
of the ideality of the golden period of art. Bonvicino began his career
as a painter in his 18th year. He rarely extended the sphere of his labours
beyond his native place, Ind Breach is therefore abundantly stored with
his works. The churches here (such as San Clemente, p. 2010 display his
fertility, both as a. painter'al fresco' and in oils, forming uite a museum
of his pictures. San Giovanni 1ihrtrngelitrtts (p. 205), Santi unto e Calm
