marked expression were imparted to the true constituents """ AML
of the structure, the real exponents of the architectural design.
The works of the Bramantine era are less graceful and attractive
the those of their predecessors, but superior in their well defined,
lofty simplicity and iinfahed character. Had the Church of St. Peter
been completed in the form originally designed by Bramante, we
could have pronounced a more decided opinion as to the ideal of the
ehuroh-arghiteetrrre of the Renaissance. The circumstance that the
grandest work of this style has been subjected to the most varied
alterations (and vastness of dimensions was the principal aim of the
archite ets) teaches us to refrain from the indiscriminate blame which
to commonly mu, to the lot of Renaissance churches. It must at
least be admitted that the favourite form of. Greek cross with
mded extremities, crowned by a dome, possesses concentrated
unity, and that the pillar-construction relieved by hiehes presents
s most majestic appearance; nor can it be disputed that in the
churches of the Renaissance the same artistic principles are applied
"in the universally admired palaces and secular edifleeis. It the
former therefore excite less interest, this is not due to the inferiority of the architects, but to causes beyond their control. The
great masters of. this culminating period of the Renaissance were
RAPHAEL, BALDASSARB Pnnvzm, the younger ANTONIO DA SANGALLO
of Rome, MICHELE SANMICHBLI of Verona (p. 223), JACOPO SANSOmo of Venice, and lastly MICHAEL ANGELO. The succeeding generation of the 16th century did not adhere to the style introduced by
Bramante, though not reduced by him to e finished system. They
him more sedulously at general effeet, so that harmony among the
individual members begins to be neglected; they endeavour to arrest
the eye by boldness of construction and striking contrasts; or they
borrow new modes of expression from antiquity, the precepts of
which had hitherto been applied in an unsystematic manner only.

The traveller will become acquainted with the works of Bramante
and his contemporaries at Rome (see vol. ii of this Hand- FAMOUS REboolr), but there are other places also which possess important NAISBANCE
examples of the'High Renaigsanee' style. At Florence, for Bmtargtrats.
example, are the Palazzo Pandolfni and the Palazzo Uguccioni,
the former of which is said to have been designed by RAPHAEL; the
Court of the Pitti Palace by BART. AMMANATI; the Palazzo 8errietori
and the Palazzo Bartolini by BAOCIO D'AGNOLO. We must also
