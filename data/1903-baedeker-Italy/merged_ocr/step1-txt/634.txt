ttvery-day realities. This was the home of autumn, "mama 1mm, and
Harsuppini, the'Pagan', whose firmly moulded characters recall the persoueges of antiquity; it was here that the sources of classic literature were
re-dueovered by Niccolo de' Niccoli, rrareruam', and other enthusiastic eollectors of books; it was here that the Platonic Academy developed the
study of the antique into a species of religious warship, and most of the
humenists. including Fictno, Poggio, Landint, Pica delta Hirandola, Ind

Florence continued to surpass the rest of Italy in intellectual culture, as
the names of Machined", Varchi, Guieeiardfrti, end Galileo testify.

In the development of the F120: Ame Florence has played so important a part, that her ert-history is in man respects nearly eoincident
