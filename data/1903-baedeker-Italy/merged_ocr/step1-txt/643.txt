of Florence, was erected on the site of the earlier church of St. Reparats, which had been used as a cathedral since 1128. The erection
was decreed by a popular vote of 1294. The firgt nehitect we: Arnolfa di Gambia, who superintended the works from 1296 down to
his death in 1301 and was succeeded by motto (1334-36) and Andrea Beano (1336-49). In 1357 the plan was expanded, and the
nave with its spacious vaulting was begun from a design by Francesco
Talenti. The exterior was also farther ornamented with marble in
harmony with the original details. In 1366 a commission of 24 architects met to decide the form of the choir and the dome, and their
plan (of 1367) has since been adhered to. The three apses were
completed in 1407-21. -On 19th August, 1418, was announced the
public competition for the technical execution of the dome, of which
Vasari has given so racy an account, end in which the genius of
Filippo Brtmellegehi secured the victory in spite of the jealousy of
rivals and the doubts of the cognoscenti. The construction of the
cupola took fourteen years (1420-34). The fhureh was ilna11y
consecrated on March 25th (the old Florentine New Year's Day),
1436, but the lantern on the top of the dome, also designed by
Brnnelleschi, was not completed till 1462. The building (larger
than all previous churches in Italy, comp. p. 366) is 556 ft. in
length and M2 ft. (across the octagon) in breadth; the dome is
300 ft. high, with the lantern 352 ft. (ascent, see p. 454). The nave
and aisles are adjoined, in place of a transept, by an octagonal domed
space, with three polygonal apses. The unfinished old facade (comp.
pp. 456, 491) was removed in 1588. The present facade was erected
in 1875-87 from the design of Emilio De Fabric (p. 456), which
originally contemplated three gables. The modern bronze "de-door
on the N. is by Ant. Passaglia, that on the S. by Gina. Cassioli (1899).

The Interior, though somewhat bare and dark, is very impressive
owing to its grand dimensions. The gallery detracts from the effect of the
arches. The choir is appropriately placed under the dome..

Pope Boniface VIII., erroneously attributed to Amino Hume, preserved
from the old fagade; above, two equestrian portraits (in grisaille) as mural
tombs: to the right, John Hawkwood (d. 1394), In English loldieroffortune who served the Republic in 1592 ('the tirat real general of modem
times', according to Hallam), by Paolo Uccello (1436); to the left, the condottiere Niccolb da Tolentino (d. 1433), by Andrea del Castagno (1456). Over
the principal portal: Coronation of the Virgin in mosaic, by 9mm Gaddi;
at the sides, frescoes (angels) by ems di Tito, restored. - The designs
for the stained glass in the three windows were drawn by Lor. 0hibertit

the design of the coloured mosaic pavement is attributed to Baccio dunno"
and Francesco da sangallo.
