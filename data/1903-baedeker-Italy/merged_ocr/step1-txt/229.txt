History. The favourable situation of Milan in the centre of Lombardy,
near the beginning of several of the great Alpine passes, has always secured
for it a high degree of prosperity. Under the Romans, who conquered "
in B.C. 222, it was one of the largest cities in Italy, but owing to its
re eated destruction hardly a trace of that period has been left o. 188).
After the decay of the Lombard sovereignty the power of the archbishops
(p. Hi) increased enormously, es ecially under Aribert (1018-45), against
whom the smaller vessels were breed to form a later date the people, grouped round the Carroecia, fought
for the Arehbitshopts ainst Conrad II. And the noblesse, expelling the
latter from the city in 041. At this time Milan is said to have contained
300,000O inhab., and its trade and industry especially the weaving of
woollen goods and the making of arms and aiaii in gold, had become
very 1m anant. The Roman walls had long since become too cramped,
and in 157 an almost circular moat, still preserved in the inner canal
(Naviglio), was constructed round the town. Neither this fortiileatton,
however, nor the heroic courage of the Milanese could resist the Emp.
Frederick Barbaroua, who, with the helg of the Ghibelline towns of Lombardy, totally destroyed the city in 11 2, with the exception' of a few
churches. The emperor', severe rule, however, soon roused the whole of
Lombardy against him; ilve years later (1167) Milan wee rebuilt by the
allied cities of Brescia Bergemo, Mantua, end Verona while the bettle

The Visconh' (p.111), who became'flignori' of Iron in 1277 and
furnished several occupants to the tsrchiepiaooptu chair, made an end of
the city's constitutional independence, but contributed to its'tell-being by
the introduction of the silk-industry (en. 1340) and by the wide extension
of their sway. A new outer rampart (the Maud Dr heavens) was constructed in this period to protect the suburbs. The mm (11504555)
endeavoured to reconcile the Milanese to their loss of liberty by the brilliancy of their court and their patronage of art..

The were of the early part of the 16th cent, and the heavy taxes of
the spawn Period did not prevent the growth of the city, which in 1590
numbered 216,000 inhabitants. In 1527 city-wells were erected on the
site of the outer ramparts, and in 1519 a new series of fortified and bastioned
walls were begun. In 1714 Milan, with the rest of Lombardy, passed into
the hands of Austria. In 1797 it became the capital of the'lhualpine Rar.
public', and then (down to 1815) that of the Kingdom of Italy. The bloody
insurrection of the Gtaque Giornate (March 17th-22nd, 1848) compelled the
Austrian, to evacuate the city, and the patriotic agitation: which ensued
were happily ended by the desired union with the new kingdom of Italy
in 1839. No town in Italy has undergone such marked improvement as
Milan since this date.

Art History. The only buildings of the early-Christian and Romance uei
periods that survived the destruction of 1162 were the churches of en
Lorenzo (the oldest church in mien), Smt' Ambrogio (the queintest church
in Milan), San Celtic, Ban Sepelcro, San Celso, and Santa Babila.
The Gothic churches are more of decorative than constructive value;
some, like the cathedral, represent a not very successful compromise between the styles of the N. and of Italy, while others follow Venetian
models (the Fmt)..
