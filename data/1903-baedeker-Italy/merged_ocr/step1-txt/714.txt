continued as the Vial: Galileo (side-path to the Torre a1 Gallo, see
. 523) along the slopes to San Miniato and the Piazzale Michelangek
flee below). Lastly, under the name of Vials Michelangelo (Pi. G,
B, 8), it descends in a long curve to the river, where it terminate:
"the Ponte in Ferro, Ben the Barriers San Niceolb (Pl. B, 8).
This road, which is 60 ft. wide and nearly 33/. M. in length, is
bordered with charming pleasure-grounds, containing heye, elms,
sycamores, and hedges of roses, over which delightful views are
obtained. - Part of the Ville dei Colli is traversed by the electric
tramway No. 8 (p. 434). The Piazzale Michelangelo and San Minieto
are, however, more speedily reached from the Pom S. Niccolo
(p. 520), which is passed by the electric tramway No. 7 (p. 434).
Non San Miniato the road passes the large *Piunle Hiehelangelo (340 ft.; Pl. F, G, 8), forming a kind of projecting terrace

the hill to the SE. of Florence, is a conspicuous object from many

the secularized Franciscan monastery of Ban Salvatore or Ban
Francesco a1 Monte (Pl. P, G, 8), with a church erected by Cronaca

deservedly praised by Michael Angelo, who called it'le belle villene11i. On the high-altar is a thuoif1xion with M. Mary, J ohn, and
Francis, and above the left side-portal, I Plath in the style of Giov.

gateway of the old fortifioations, constructed by Michael Angelo in
