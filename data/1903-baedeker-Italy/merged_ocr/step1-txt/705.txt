'Even in his imitation of Miehaelangelesqne types Raphael exhibits
great freedom and the clearest censciousness of what is best adapted to
his natural gifts an of where his true strength lies. This remark applies
to the small picture of Ezekiel in the Pitti Gallery, so miniature-like in it,
tineness of execution, though less striking in the colouring. In the arrange
ment of the two smaller angels who support the arms of the Almighty,
the example of Michael Angelo was followed. From the testimony of "

during the artist's Roman period.

_ m, this picture Raphael returns to the early and simple subjects of
representation, breathing nothing but serene happiness, which glldden
the artist and charm the beholder, which any little and yet possess so
deep tb significance. Florentine forms have been supplanted by Roman

of Raphael is so popular, no other work of modern art so well known'. Springer.
