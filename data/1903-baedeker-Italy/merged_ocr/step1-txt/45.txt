xxxiv ITALIAN ART.

Roman art, and a sudden and spontaneous invention of a new style.
But the eye and the hand adhere to custom more temusiomsly than
the mind. While new ideas, and altered views of the character of
the Deity and the destination of man were entertained, the wanted
forms were still necessarily employed in the expression of these
thoughts. Moreover the heathen sovereigns had by no means been
unremittingly hostile to Christianity the most bitter persecutions
did not take place till the 3rd century, and the new doctrine- were
permitted to expand, take deeper root, and organise themselves in
the midst of heathen society. The consequence was, that the trangition from heathen to Christian Mela of Art wee I gradual one, and
that in point of form early Christian art continued to follow up the
lessons of the ancient. The best proof of this is afforded by the
paintings in the Roman CATAOOMBB, the burial-places of the early
Christian community In these the artistic principles of pagan
antiquity are adhered to, alike in decorative forms, design, choice
of colour, grouping of figures, and treatment of subject. Even the
SABCOPHAGUS SCULPTUBES of the 4th and 5th centuries differ in
purport only, and not in technical treatment, from the type exhibited
in the tomb-reliefs of heathen Rome. Five centuries elapsed before a new artistic style sprang up in painting and in the greatly
neglected plastic arts. Meanwhile architecture had developed itself
eommensurately with the requirements of Christian worship, and,
in connection with the new modes of building, painting acquired a
different character.

The term BASILICA STYLE is -often employed to designate early
Christian architecture down to the 10th century. The Roman

courts of judicature and public aissusrn1r1y-ha1hn The belief that
these were afterwards fitted up for the purposes of Christian worship
is now exploded, but in their main features they served as models
for the construction of Christian churches. After the 4th cent.
the following became the established type of the Christian beeilica. In front is a quadrangular fore-court (atrium), of the same
width as the basilica itself, surrounded with an open colonnade
and provided with a fountain (cantharus) for the ahlutiann of the
devout. This forms the approach to the interior of the church,
which usually consisted of a nave and two aisles, the latter lower
than the former, and separated from it by two rows of columns, the
whole terminating in a semicircle (apsis). In front of the apse there
was sometimes a transverse space (transept); the altar, surmounted
by a columnar structure, occupied a detached position in the apee;
the space in front of it, bounded by cancelli or railings, was
destined for the choir of offleiating priests, and contained the two
pulpits (ambones) where the gospel and epistles were read. Unlike the ancient temples, the early-Ghristian basilicas exhibit a
