Turin (785 it.), Ital. Torino, the ancient Tammie, capital of
the Taurini, a Ligt1rian-0eltie tribe, destroyed by Hannibal B.0.
218, afterwards the Roman Augusta Taurinorum, was the capital
of the County of Piedmont in the middle ages, and in 1418 became
subject to the Dukes of Savoy, who frequently resided here. From
1720 it was the capital of the Kingdom of Sammie, and from 1869
to 1865 of Italy. The seat of n university (founded in 1404), of
an archbishop, and of n military academy, and headquarters of the
ht Italian Corps il'Arm√©e, this great city lies in an extensive plain
on the Po, which receives the waters of the Dora Riparia below
the city. The plain of the Po is bounded on the W. by the Graian
and Cottian Alps, and on the E. by a range of hills rising on the
right bank, opposite the city (Monte dei thtppueeini, p. 39; Superga,
p. 39). Turin was the chief centre of those national struggles which
led to the unttieation of Italy. The removal of the seat of government
to Florence seriously impaired the prosperity of the citizens for a
time, but they have long since recovered their losses. The rapidly
increasing population now numbers upwards of 329,600, including
the suburbs.

' Turin in conspicuous among the cities of Italy for the regularity of

Its construction. Its plan presents rectangular blocks of home (note), long,

broad, straight streets f We), frequently with arcades (Partial), and spacious

squares. Its history explains this. The plan of the old town, with slight
variations, is the same as that of the colony founded by the Emperor
Autumn, or even of an older Roman camp. It formed a rectangle of
2210 n. in length and 1370 ft. in breadth, and had eleven towers on
Iuh lido. Its site is now bounded by the Piazza Ceatello on the E., the

Via della Consolata and the Corso Siccerdi on the w., the Via Giulio on
them. and the Via Sam. Tereu on the S. The ancient Wa Decumana

tua. The fortuteatimts constructed by Francis L in 1536, and flntmy the

{ Inn of 17% cleared away most of the on buildings and gave the town
1tt Pruent regular and modern appearance. The fortifications were demol
ished by the French in 1801.
