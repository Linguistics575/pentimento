(1901), 11/2 fr. Director, Dr. Corrado Ricci. The collection has
been greatly enlarged and aim rearranged since 1901. In our
description below we follow the new arrangement. - The gem of
the collection is Raphael's Bpotuslizio (Room XXIII), the chief
work of his first or Umbrian period. The numerous pictures of
the Lombard school, and particularly the frescoes sewn out of
churches, are also very valuable. The authenticity of the Head of
Christ (R. XIV) ascribed to Leon. da Vinci is open to considerable
doubt. The Madonna in a bower of roses (R. XV) is the best of the
oil-paintings by Bernardino Euini, and the best of his frescoes are
the Madonna with M. Anthony and Barber: (R. II) and the Burial
of St. Catherine (R. XV). The most interesting works of the early
Italian school are those by Mantegna, in R. VIII. The collection
also affords an instructive survey of the progress of Carlo Crivelli
(R. VIII), a master who flourished in 1468-93 and connects the
Paduen school with that of Venice. The most notable works of the
latter school are The Preaching of St. Mark by Gentile Bellini (R. Y),
three works by Giovanni Bellini (R. VIII), and three by Cima da
Conegliano (R. T); and of a later period The Finding of Moses by
Bonifasio I. (R. V), the Portrait of Porch and the "Jerome by
Titian (R. AT), Tintorettoh, Finding of the body of "Mark (R. IV),
and the admirable series of portraits by Lorenzo Lotto (R. VII),
dulled by Giov. Butt. hforoni of Bergamo (R. 111). Of Correggio the
collection now possesses an admirable early work (R. XVIII). Domeniehina end Guanine (R. XVII) represent the Italian masters of the
17th century. The most important works of foreign schools are
The Last Supper by Rubens, and the portraits of ladies by Van Dyck
and by Rembrandt (R. XXVIII).
