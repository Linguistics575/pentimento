Cleopatra). The private chapel (adm. by special introduction only)
contains the handsome Renaissance tombs of Counts Camille and
Giovanni Borromeo, the latter partly by pupils of Amadeo. - The
beautiful Garden, laid out in the old Italian style, rises in ten terraces
100 ft. above the lake, and is stocked with lemon-trees, cedars,
magnolias, orange-trees, laurels, cork-trees, camellia, magnificent
oleanders, and other luxuriant products of the south, while shellgrottoes, arbours, and statues meet the eye in profusion. The traveller coming from the N. cannot fail to be struck with the loveliness of the bank of the lake as seen from here, studded with
innumerable habitation,, and clothed with southern vegetation
(chestnuts, mulberries, vines, figs, olives), the extensive lake with
its deep blue waters and beautiful girdle of snowy mountains
combining the stern grandeur of the High Alps with the charms
of a southern dime. - The island is open to the public daily, except Mom, Wed., and Frid., from March 15th to Nov. 15th, from 9
