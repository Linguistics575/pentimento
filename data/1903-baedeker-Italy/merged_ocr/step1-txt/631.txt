From 1207 onwards the judicial functions were entrusted to the Podulu.

afterwards increased to a year. The Florentinea maintained their pristine
simplicity and virtue longer than was usual in Italian cities. The home,
however, lived in bitter tends with each other, And after the assassination
of Buondelmonte on the Pants Vecchio in { Rib were divided between the
two hostile camps of the Guelphs and the Ghihelliuu. Under the Emperor

of their own, commanded by a.'Capiteno del Popolo', who was assisted by
a council of 12'Ancients' CAnm'anr) and 36'0orT0ru1if0qporalU. About
the same time (1252) was first coined the golden Florin, which soon became a
general standard of value, end merit: the leading position taken by Florence
in the commerce of Europe. The guilds of the wool-weavers and clothmakers maintained agents in Venice, Paris, Bruges, and London; Florentine bankers had a hand in the commerce of every nation, and, more
especially, exercised almost exclusive control over the money-merketof
France. The continuous tenth of the nobles brought the republic into
collisiOn with other Tuscan towns, of which Siene and Pisa were conspicuous pertizens of the Ghibellines. In 1260 the Florentines tsuffered I
crushing defeat on the Arbia, near Monteperti, which cost the Guelph
their supremacy in the city The Ghibelline grendeee proposed to rue
Florence to the ground and to transfer the seat of government to Empoli'
but the plan rm successfully opposed by the noble Farinata degli Uberti.

On the death of Manfred of Hohenstaufen at the battle of Benevento
in 1266, the Guelphs regained their power, and in um they elected cute
of Anion: Is Signor for ten years. This election placed foreign princes in
t e same position with regard to the republic as had been held by the
emperors, and their representatives now shared the government with the
municipal authorities, which ever since the middle of the 13th cent. had
included the presidents of the seven greater Arts, or guilds (Lawyers and
Notaries, Muney-ctuogera, Meney-chaugers, Wool-weavers, Silk-workers,
Physicians and Apotllecriries, and Furriers). Fourteen lesser guilds were
afterwards formed. In 1232 the guilds arrogated to themselves the Supreme
power, and entrusted the government to e SignMa formed of their presidents or Priori (afterwards restricted to eight, elected for two months).
The nobility were kept in check by the'Ordimunenti della aiustiaia', a
series of strict regulations due to Giana delta Bella (1293), which were "I
