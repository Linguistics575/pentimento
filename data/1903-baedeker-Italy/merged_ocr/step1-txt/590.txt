History. PISA.. M. Route. 405

Pisa, a quiet town with 60,255 inhah., the capital of a province,
the see of an archbishop, and the seat of a university, is situated
on both banks of the Arm, 6 M. from the sea and about 4 M, from
the base of the Monti Pisa-ni (p. 416). Its climate is moist and
fairly mild, but the town has always had the reputation of being
rainy. Good drinking-water is brought from the neighbourhood of
Ascisno (p. MN.

Pisa was the Plus of the ancients, and once lay at the eonflueuee of the

Arms and Amer (Serchio), which last has now an estuary of its own.
It became a Roman colony in B.C. 180. Augustus gave it the name of
cumin Julia Pisana and Hadrian end Antoninus Pius erected temples,
theatres, and iiiGiadi arches here. At that period the town must have
been a place of considerable importance, but all its ancient monuments,
have disappeared with the exception of a few scanty relics of some

the beginning of the 11th cent. Pisa attained the rank of one of the
greatest commercial and seafaring towns on the Mediterranean, and became
a rival of Venice and Genus. It was sshiefly indebted for its power to the
seal with which It took the lead in the were against the Infidels. In
1025 the Pisans expelled the Saracens from Sardinia and took permanent
possession of the island. In 1030 and 1089 they again defeated the Saracens
M Tunis, and in 1063 destroyed their fleet near Palermo. In 1114 they
conquered the Balearic Islands, and soon afterwards took I prominent
part in the Crusades. In the 12th and 13th centuries their power had
reached its zenith; their trade extended over the entire Mediterranean,
and their supremacy embraced the Italian islands and the whole of the
coast from La Spezia to Civith Vecchia. In the intestine were of the
peninsula Pisa was the most powerful adherent of the Ghibellines, and
therefore sustained e shock through the downfall of the Hohenttaufen. The protracted Inn Which the citizens carried on with Genoa led
to their disastrous defeat at Melorie near Leghorn on 6th Aug., 1284 (p. 76),
and the peace concluded in 1300 compelled them to evacuate Corsica and
7ther possessions. In 1320 the pope invested the kings of Aragon with
Sardinia, and Pisa was thus deprived of this importer" inland also. The
sity was farther weakened by internal dissensions, and fell a victim to the
unhition of the condottieri. In 1405 it was sold to Florence, but on the
m-ivni of Charles VIII. it endeavoured to shake "the yoke of its arrogant
neighbour. In 1609, however, it was besieged and again occupied by the
? lorentines, to whom it thenceforth continued subject.
