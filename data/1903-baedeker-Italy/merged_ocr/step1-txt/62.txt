Among the various works executed by these masters, Monumental
Tomb: largely predominate. While these monuments are often of
I somewhat bombastic character, they afford an excellent milltration of the high value attached to individuality and personal
culture during the Renaissance period. We may perhaps also frequently take exception to the monotony of their style, which
remained almost unaltered for a whole century, but we cannot fail
to derive genuine pleasure from the inexhaustible freshness of
imagination and richness of detail displayed within so narrow limits.

As museums cannot convey an adequate idea of the sculpture
of the 15th century, "the picture galleries will not afford an
accurate insight into the painting of that period. Sculp- Pun,"

are usually spoken of as the earliest specimens of the painting of
the Renaissance. On material grounds the e1agidfieuion is justifiable,
Is this cycle of pictures may be regarded as a programme of the
earlier art of the Renaissance, the importance of which it served to
mtintein, even during the age of Raphael. Here the beauty of the
nude was first revealed, and here a calm dignity was for the f1rat
time imparted to the individual figures, as well as to the general
amngement; and the transformation of a group of indifferent spectators in the composition into a sympathising choir, forming as it were
a frame to the principal actors in the scene, was first successfully
elected. It is, therefore, natural that these frescoes should still be
regarded "models for imitation, and that, when the attention of
connoisseurs was again directed during the 18th century to the
beauties of the prts-Raphaelite period, the works of MASOIJNO O)
