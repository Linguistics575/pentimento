xxxvi ITALIAN ART.

tsigniiletuit passages; the apse loses its intimate connection with
the nave, being separated from it; the most conspicuous feature
in the building consist: of the central square space, bounded
by four massive pillars which support the dome. These are the
essential characteristics of the Byzantine style, which culminates
in the magniiioent church of St. Sophia at Constantinople, and prevails throughout Oriental Christendom, but in the West, including
Italy only, occurs sporadically. With the exception of the churches
of San Vitale at Revenue, and St. Mark at Venice, the edifice: of
Lower Italy alone show a frequent application of this style.
The Byzantine imagination does not appear to have exercised at
Glow" greater influence on the growth of other branches of Italian
or tan "art than on architecture. A brisk traNe in works of art
hum was carried on by Venice, Amalfi, and other Italian towns,
with the Levant; the position of Constantinople resembled that of
the modern Lyons; silk wares, tapestry, and Jewellery were most
highly valued when imported from the Eastern metropolis. Byzantine artists were always welcome visitors to Italy, Italian connoisseurs ordered works to be executed at Constantinople, ehietly
those in metal, and the superiority of Byzantine workmanship
was universally acknowledged. All this, however, does not justify
the inference that Italian art was quite subordinate to Byzantine.
On the century, notwithstanding various external iMueneea, it
underwent an independent and unbiassed development, and never
entirely abandoned its ancient principles. A considerable interval
indeed elapsed before the fusion of the original inhabitants with
the early medieval immigrants was complete, before the aggregate
of diiterent tribes, languages, customs, and ideas became blended
into a single nationality, and before the people attained tmfiieient
concentration and independence of spirit to devote themselves
successfully to the cultivation of art. Unproductive in the pro-vince of art as this early period is, yet an entire departure from
native tradition, or a serious conflict of the latter with extraneous
innovation never took place. It may be admitted, that in the
massive columns and eumbroue capitals of the churches of Upper
Italy, and in the art of vaulting which was developed here at an
early period, symptoms of the Germanic character of the inhabitants are manifested, and that in the Lower Italian and especially
Sicilian structures, traces of Arabian and Norman iniiuenee are
unmistakable. In the essentials, however, the foreigners continue
to be the recipients; the might of ancient tradition and the
national idea of form might be repressed but they could not be
obliterated.'
About the middle of the 11th century a zealous and promisRonw- ing artistic movement took place in Italy, and the seeds
