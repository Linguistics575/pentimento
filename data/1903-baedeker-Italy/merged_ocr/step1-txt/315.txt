Pavia (250 ft.), with 33,922 inhab., capital of the province of
the same name, the see of a bishop, and the seat of a university,
is situated near the ooni1uenee of the Ticino and the Po and is connected with Milan by the Naviglio di Pavia (p. 115). Of the numerous towers, which won for it the title of'Gitta delle Cento Torn",
and of the churches, which are said to have numbered 165 in the
14th cent., only a few now remain; but parts of the ancient ramparts and bulwark: still attest the ancient importance of the town.

Pavia is the Tict'num of the ancients, subsequently Papia, and was the
capital of the Lombard: from 672 to TU. In the middle age: it was the
faithful ally of the German emperors, until it was handed over in 1360,
by Emp. Charles IV., to Galeazzo II. Visconti (p. 111), as imperial vicar. The battle of Pavia, at which Fraud. I. of France was defeated and taken
prisoner by Lannoy, general of Charles V., took place in the park of the
castle on th Feb., 1525.

The CATHEDRAL (Pl. B, 3), begun in the early-Renaissance
style by Cristoforo Rocchi in 1488 on the site of two churches of
the Lombard period and continued with the Iso-operation of Amalie Â» l
and Bramante, but never completed, is a vast'central' structure
(comp. p. lxiv) with four arms. The facade (1898) and the dome
(300 ft. high) are modern. I

frame), Bern. cam (Madonne with the rosary, 1531), am, Bath. amps,
Daniele Crespi, and m. ParqMns" (1854). In the crypt is the humane _
ing to the legend, wee that bishop of Pavia.

Adjoining the church to the left rises the massive Torre Maggiore
(256 ft. high), a tower mentioned as early as 1330; the top story
was begun in 1583 by Pellegrino Tibaldi.
