V l" Sento Spirito (Pl. o, 5), a basilica in the form of a. Latin arm
covered with a dome, and containing 38 chapels. It was begun about
1436, on the site of a Romanesque building from a design by
Filippo Brunelleeehi, and was completed in 1182, with numerous
modifieatioms, by Ant. Manetti, Salvi d'Andrea, and others. The
noble proportions of the interior, which is borne by 31 Corinthim
columns and 4 pillars, render it one of the most attractive structures
in Florence. The nave has a flat roof, while the aisles are vaulted.
'This church, taking it all in all, is internally as successful "
adaptation of the basilican type as its age presents' (Fergusson). The campanile, erected by Baccio d'Agnolo was restored in 1896.
