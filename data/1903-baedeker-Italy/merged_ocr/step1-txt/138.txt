torum of the Remane and now the capital of the Italian province of
Aosta, lies at the eonthtenee of the Buthier and the Dam er Dora
Baltea. The valley was Anciently inhabited by the Salassi, a Celtic
me, who commanded the passage of the Great and the Little
St. Bernard, the two chief routes ffom Italy to Gaul. They frequently
harassed the Romans in various ways, until they were conquered in
B.0. 25 by Terentiue Vane, who sold many of them as slaves at

Guiana Alps. A short walk brings us to the ancient Town Walla,
