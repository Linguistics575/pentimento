school, however, soon languished, and ere long ceased to exist.
The Nonmu SonooLe of Italy t on the other hand, retained
their vitality and independence for a somewhat longer period. At

was successfully practised by Burr. Bunyan, surnamed

. V Doss: (ca. 1479-1542) and Bnmmrro Tmr, surnamed Gnorapo (1481-1559). At Verona the reputation of the school was
maintained by FRANCESCO Cano'ro (1470-1546) and PAOLO Momma,

surnamed CAVAZZOLA (1486-1522).

The most important works produced in Northern Italy were those
of ANTONIO Araamu, surnamed Conuuoxo COM-HBO, and of
the Venetian masters. Those who visit Parma after Rome
and Florence will certainly be disappointed with the pietures of Correggio. They will discover a realistic tendency in his
works, and they will observe, not only that his treatment of space
(as in the perspective painting of domes) is unreiined, but that
his individual tigures possess little attraction beyond mere natural
charms, and that their want of repose is apt to displease and fatigue
the eye. The fact is, that Correggio was not a painter of all-embracing genius and far-reaching culture, but merely an adept in
ehisrosaruro/who left all the other resources of his art undeveloped.
In examining the principal works of the memx Scuoon, however, the traveller will experience no such dissatisfaction (comp.
p.268). From the school of Giovanni Bellini (p.111) emanated
the greatest representatives of Venetian painting - GronGIONB, properly BARBABBLLI (1477? -1510), whose works
have unfortunately not yet been tsufileient1y well identified, the
elder PALMA (1480-1528) t end Tizium Veoellio (1477-1576), who
for nearly three quarters of a century maintained his native style "
its culminating point. These masters are far from being mere oolorists; nor do they owe their peculiar attraction to local inspiration
alone. The enjoyment of life and pleasure which they so happily
pourtray is a theme dictated by the culture of the Renaissance (a
culture possessed in an eminent degree by Titian, as indicated by
his intimacy with the'divine' Aretino). Their serene and joyous
characters often recall some of the ancient gods, showing the manner
in which the artists of the Renaissance had profited by the revived
study of the antique. Properly to appreciate Titian It is of importance to remember how much of his activity was displayed in the
service of the different courts. His connection with the family of
Este began at an early period; he carried on an active intercourse
with the (lounges at Mantus, and executed numerous pictures for
