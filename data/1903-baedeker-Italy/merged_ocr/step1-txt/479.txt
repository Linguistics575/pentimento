esque town at the end of the lagoons, with 31,218 inhab., mostly
employed in the flsherieg, was founded before Venice, by which it
was soon conquered. During the war with Gene: it was taken by
the Genoese (1379), but recovered by the Venetians the following
year (comp. p. 266). The inhabitants have always differed materially
in language and customs from the other inhabitants of the lagoon'
districts; but the quaint costume of the women is now to be seen
only on a few feast-days. None of the churches are worthy of note.
