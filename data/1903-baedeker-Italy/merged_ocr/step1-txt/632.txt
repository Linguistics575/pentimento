Mancini, Peruzzi, Rueellai, Strozzi, The lower ranks of the
people - the po olo minuto - were still excluded from ofthe. A large
portion of the city was burned down in 1801, during a contest between
the nobles and the people. In the meantime various attempts had been

the city. Walter of Brienne, Duke of Athens, the last of these governors,
abolished the constitution by force in 1342, but in the following year he
was expelled. Power now fell into the hand. of an oligarchy, mainly
consisting of recently enriched commercial families, who exercised an in..
Menee on every department of government through the'Oapitani di Parte
Guelfa', appointed to administer the estates of the Ghibelline citizens. The
position and the sentiments of the burghere had been much altered by
commercial crises, such as that of 1346, by famine, and by the plague
of 1348, of which Boccaccio has left a description. An insurrection of
the poorer classes - the'Tamulto dei Ciompi' - in 1378 was followed by

an exile of one year, and resumed the reins of government with almost
princely mtrgnifleenee, without, however, interfering with the outward

by the victory of Aughiari in 1440. Pope Eugenio Ive, who lived in
Florence from that till 1443, transferred hither in 1439 the Council of
