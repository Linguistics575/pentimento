taste, and a creative imagination, which instinctively divine: the
appropriate forms for its design, can alone excel in this sphere of art.
This enthusiasm for external beauty and just and harmonious proportions is the essential characteristic of the art of the Renaissance.
Its veneration for the antique is thus also accounted for. At iirgt
an ambitious thirst for fame caused the Italians of the 15th and 16th

admirable assistance in perfecting their sense of form and symmetry.
They by no means viewed the art of the ancients as a perfect whole,
or as the product of a dtyilnfte historical epoch, which developed
itself under peculiar conditions; but their attention was arrested by
the individual works of antiquity and their special beauties. Thus
ancient ideas were re-admitted Into the sphere of Renaissance art.
A return to the religious spirit of the Romans and Weeks is not of
course to be inferred from the veneration for the ancient gods shown
during the humanistic period; belief in the Olympian gods was extinct; but just because no devotional feeling was intermingled,
because the forms could only receive life from creative imagination,
did they exercise so powerful an fnfluenee on the Italian masters.
The importance of mythological characters being wholly due to the
perfect beauty of their forms, they could not fail on this account
pre-eminently to recommend themselves to Renaissance artists.

Notwithstanding the apparent want of organisation, however, great
beauty of form, the outcome of the most exuberant imagination,
will be observed in all these structures.

Throughout the diversified stages of development of the succeeding styles of Renaissance architecture, felicity of proportion is
invariably the aim of all the great masters. To appreciate their
success in this aim should also be regarded as the principal task of
the spectator, who with this object in view will do well to compare
a Gothic with a Renaissance structure. This comparison will prove
to him that harmony of proportion is not the only effective element
in architecture; for, especially in the cathedrals of Germany, the
exclusively vertical tendency, the attention to form without regard
to measure, the violation of precepts of rhythm, and a disregard
of proportion and the proper ratio of the open to the closed cannot
