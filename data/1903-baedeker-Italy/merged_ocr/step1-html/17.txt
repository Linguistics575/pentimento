<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vi </span>PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
HEIGHTS are given in English feet (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1Jihigl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>-- 0,3048<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mare</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DISTANCES </span>in English miles (comp. p. ii). The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">POPULATIONS </span>given are those of the communal districts<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">feomuni</span>) according to the census of 1901; the populations of<br/>
the separate towns and villages <span style="color: #ff0000;">fyopoldeione </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aggltrmerata</span>),<br/>
which are usually considerably lower than the figures in the<br/>
Handbook, have not yet been published.<br/>
<br/>
HOTELS (comp<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>xix). Besides the modern palatial and<br/>
expensive establishments the Handbook also mentions a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tielection </span>of modest, old-fashioned inns, which not unfrequently<br/>
afford good accommodation at moderate charges. The asterisks<br/>
indicate those hotels which the Editor has reason to believe<br/>
from his own experience, as well as from information supplied<br/>
by numerous travellers, to be respectable, clean, reasonable,<br/>
and fairly well provided with the comforts and conveniences<br/>
expected in an up-to-date establishment. Houses of a more<br/>
primitive character, when good of their class, are described as<br/>
'fair' or'very fair'. At the same time the Editor does not doubt<br/>
that comfortable quarters may occasionally be obtained at inns<br/>
which he has not recommended or even mentioned. The<br/>
average charges are stated in accordance with the Editor's<br/>
own experience, or from the bills furnished to him by travellers. Although changes frequently take place, and prices<br/>
generally have an upward tendency, the approximate <span style="color: #0000FF;">statement </span>of these items which is thus supplied will <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>least enable<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>to form an estimate of his probable expenditure.<br/>
<br/>
To hotel-proprietors, tradesmen, and others the Editor<br/>
begs to intimate that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>character for fair dealing and courtesy<br/>
towards travellers forms the sole passport to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">commendation</span>, and that advertisements of every kind are strictly <span style="color: #ff0000;">exeluded </span>from his Handbooks. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotel-keepers </span>are also warned<br/>
against <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>representing themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>agents for<br/>
Baedeker's Handbooks.<br/>
