<span>Italian Art.<br/>
<br/>
A Historical Sketch by Professor Anton Springer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the primary objects of the enlightened traveller in Italy<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span>to form some acquaintance with its treasures of art.<br/>
Even those whose usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">evocation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are of the most prosaic<br/>
nature unconsciously become admirers of poetry and art in<br/>
Italy. The traveller here finds them so interwoven with scenes of<br/>
everyday life, that he encounters their influence at every step, and<br/>
involuntarily becomes susceptible to their power. A single visit<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>hardly <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffice </span>to enable any one justly to appreciate the<br/>
numerous works of art <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meets </span>with in the course of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tour</span>, nor<br/>
can a guide-book teach him to fathom the mysterious depths of<br/>
Italian creative genius, the past history of which is particularly attractive; but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">perusal </span>of a few remarks on this subject will be<br/>
found materially to enhance the pleasure and facilitate the researches<br/>
of even the most unpretending lover of art. Works of the highest class,<br/>
the most perfect creations of genius, lose nothing of their charm by<br/>
being pointed out as specimens of the best period of art; while<br/>
those of inferior merit are invested with far higher interest when<br/>
they are shown to be necessary links in the chain of development,<br/>
and when, on comparison with <span style="color: #0000FF;">audit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>or later works, their relative<br/>
defects or superiority are recognised. The following observations,<br/>
therefore, will hardly be deemed out of place in a work designed to<br/>
aid the traveller in deriving the greatest possible amount of enjoyment and instruction from his sojourn in Italy.<br/>
<br/>
The two great epochs in the history of art which principally<br/>
arrest the attention are those of Classic Antiquity, and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Guam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ARD<br/>
</span>16th century, the culminating period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tstr-eil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Renata- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mums</span>.<br/>
mace. The intervening space of more than a thousand <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MINE<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">usually</span>, with much unfairness, almost entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">ignore<br/>
</span>for this interval not only continues to exhibit vestiges of the first<br/>
epoch, but gradually paves the way for the second. It is a common<br/>
error to suppose that in Italy alone the character of ancient art can<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>thoroughly appreciated. This idea <span style="color: #0000FF;">antes </span>from the period when no<br/>
precise distinction was made between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Week </span>and Roman art, when<br/>
the connection of the former with a particular land and nation,<br/>
and the tendency of the latter to pursue an independent course<br/>
were alike overlooked. Now, however, that we are acquainted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>more numerous Greek originals, and have acquired a<br/>
deeper insight into the development of Hellenic art, an indis<br/>
