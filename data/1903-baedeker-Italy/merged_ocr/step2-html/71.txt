their vitality and independence for a somewhat longer period. At<br/>
Bologna the local style, modified by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of Raphael,<br/>
was successfully practised by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Burr</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bunyan</span>, surnamed<br/>

At Verona the reputation of the school was<br/>
maintained by <span style="color: #0000FF;">FRANCESCO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cano'ro </span>(1470-1546) and PAOLO Momma,<br/>
<br/>
surnamed <span style="color: #0000FF;">CAVAZZOLA </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">1486-1622</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The most important works produced in Northern Italy were those<br/>
of ANTONIO <span style="color: #ff0000;">ALLEGBI</span>, surnamed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Conuuoxo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">COM-HBO</span>, and of<br/>
the Venetian masters. Those who visit Parma after Rome<br/>
and Florence will certainly be disappointed with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pietures </span>of Correggio. They will discover a realistic tendency in his<br/>
works, and they will observe, not only that his treatment of space<br/>
(as in the perspective painting of domes) is <span style="color: #0000FF;">unrefined</span>, but that<br/>
his individual <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>possess little attraction beyond mere natural<br/>
charms, and that their want of repose is apt to displease and fatigue<br/>
the eye. The fact is, that Correggio was not a painter of all-embracing genius and far-reaching culture, but merely an <span style="color: #0000FF;">adept </span>in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiaroscuro</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'who </span>left all the other resources of his art undeveloped.<br/>
In examining the principal works of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">VBNBTIAN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SCHOOL</span>, however, the traveller will experience no such dissatisfaction (comp.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">268</span>). From the school of Giovanni Bellini (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.111</span>) emanated<br/>
the greatest representatives of Venetian <span style="color: #0000FF;">painting </span>- <span style="color: #ff0000;">GroaGIONB</span>, properly <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bmmur </span>(1477? -1510), whose works<br/>
have unfortunately not yet been <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>well identified, the<br/>
elder <span style="color: #ff0000;">Puma </span>(1480-1528<span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tizium </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Veoellio </span>(1477-1576), who<br/>
for nearly three quarters of a century maintained his native style <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>its culminating point. These masters are far from being mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">colorists</span>; nor do they owe their peculiar attraction to local inspiration<br/>
alone. The enjoyment of life and pleasure which they so happily<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pourtray </span>is a theme dictated by the culture of the Renaissance (a<br/>
culture possessed in an eminent degree by Titian, as indicated by<br/>
his intimacy with the'divine' Aretino). Their serene and joyous<br/>
characters often recall some of the ancient gods, showing the manner<br/>
in which the artists of the Renaissance had profited by the revived<br/>
study of the antique. Properly to appreciate Titian <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is of importance to remember how much of his activity was displayed in the<br/>
service of the different courts. His connection with the family of<br/>
Este began at an early period; he carried on an active intercourse<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lounges </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mantua</span>, and executed numerous pictures for<br/>
