his artistic and novel conceptions. On these grounds therefore Giotto, so versatile and so active in the most extended spheres,<br/>
was accounted the purest type of his century, and succeeding<br/>
generations founded a regular school of art in his name. As<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of all the earlier Italian painters, so in that of Giotto<br/>
and his successors, an opinion of their true merits can be formed<br/>
from their mural paintings alone. The intimate connection of the<br/>
picture with the architecture, of which it constituted the living<br/>
ornament, compelled artists to study the rules of symmetry and<br/>
harmonious composition, developed their sense of style, and, as<br/>
extensive spaces were placed at their disposal, admitted of broad<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unshackled </span>delineation. Almost every church in Florence<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bound </span>of specimens of art in the style of Giotto, and almost every town in Central Italy in the 14th century practised some<br/>
branch of art akin to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wotto</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>The most valuable works of this style<br/>
are preserved in the churches of Santa Croce (especially the choir<br/>
chapels) and Santa Maria Novella at Florence. Beyond the precincts<br/>
of the Tuscan capital the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>works of Giotto are to be found at<br/>
Assisi and in the Madonna <span style="color: #0000FF;">dell</span>' Arena at Padua, where about 1306<br/>
he executed a representation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">some</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>from the lives of the Virgin<br/>
and the Saviour. The Campo Santa of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pine </span>(p. 408) affords specimens<br/>
of the handiwork of his pupils and contemporaries. In the works<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span>of this unique national museum the spectator cannot<br/>
fail to be struck by their <span style="color: #0000FF;">finely-conceived</span>, poetical character (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>the Triumph of Death), their sublimity (Last Judgment, Trials of<br/>
Job), or their richness in <span style="color: #0000FF;">dramatic </span>effect (History of St. Rainerus,<br/>
and of the Martyrs Ephesus and Potitus).<br/>
<br/>
In the 15th century, as well as in the 14th, Florence continued<br/>

</span>and refinement. The fact, however, is, that Florence did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">har</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

During a long period <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siena </span>successfully vied with her in artistic<br/>

imagination, or promoted intellectual activity in so marked a degree,<br/>
or combined ease and dignity so harmoniously as Florence. What<br/>
therefore was but obscurely <span style="color: #0000FF;">experienced </span>in the rest of Italy, and<br/>
manifested at irregular intervals only, was generally first realised<br/>
here with tangible distinctness. Florence became the birthplace of<br/>
the revolution in art <span style="color: #ff0000;">eiiected </span>by Giotto, and Florence was the home<br/>
of the art of the Renaissance, which began to prevail soon after the<br/>
