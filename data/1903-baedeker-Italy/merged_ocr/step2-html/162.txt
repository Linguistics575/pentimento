<span>History. GENOA. 16. Route. 71<br/>
<br/>
The internal history of the city was no less chequered than the external. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">party-conflicts </span>between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">grout </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">milieu </span>of the Doria,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Spinola</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adam</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>(Ghibellines) on one side, and the Grimaldi,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Piesdu</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">Guarani</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">3fontaldi </span>(Guelphs) on the other, led to some <span style="color: #0000FF;">extraordinary </span>results. at the expense of their own<br/>
independence, to invoke the aid of some foreign prince, and accordingly<br/>
we find that after the 14th cent. the kings of Naples and France, the<br/>
marquises of Montferrat, and the dukes of Milan were alternately masters<br/>
of Genoa. Nor was this <span style="color: #0000FF;">state </span>of affairs materially altered by the revolution<br/>
of 1339, by which the exclusive sway of the nobility <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>overthrown,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dogs</span>, elected for life, invested with the supreme power. In the<br/>
midst of all this confusion the only stable element was the mercantile<br/>
Banco <span style="color: #0000FF;">di </span>San Giorgio, which had acquired extensive possessions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>in Corsica, and would, perhaps, have eventually absorbed the whole of the<br/>
republic and converted it into a commercial aristocracy, had not Genoa<br/>
lost its power of independent development bg becoming involved in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">powers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">And</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.Dorja </span>(p. 1, the admiral of Emperor<br/>
Charles <span style="color: #ff0000;">V.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>length restored peace by the establishment of a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">oligarchic<br/>
</span>constitution (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1528</span>), and the unsuccessful conspiracy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fiesco </span>in 1647 was<br/>
one of the last instances of an attempt to make the supreme power<br/>
dependent on unbridled personal ambition. But the power of Genoa was<br/>
already on the wane. The Turks conquered its Oriental possessions one<br/>
after another, and the city was subjected to severe <span style="color: #0000FF;">humiliation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>by<br/>
Louis <span style="color: #0000FF;">JOY</span>. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Flume</span>, whose fleet under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dawn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">»</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>bombarded Genoa in<br/>

some months in 1746. These last were expelled by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">popular </span>rising,<br/>
begun by a stone thrown by Balilla, a lad of 16 years. A revolt in Corsica,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">begun </span>in 1729 was suppressed only with the aid of the French,<br/>
who afterwards (1766) took possession of the island on their own behalf.<br/>
In 1797 the aristocratic government of Genoa was superseded by the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">democratic'Ligurian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bepublic</span>', established by Napoleon. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1305 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Genoe<br/>

of Sardinia.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">To </span>the student of art <span style="color: #0000FF;">Geno</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Otters </span>much of interest. Some of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">smaller </span>churches are of very ancient origin, though <span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span>altered in the<br/>
Gothic period. The Renaissance palaces of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">enoese </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">noblesse </span>are, on<br/>
the other hand, of the greatest <span style="color: #0000FF;">importance</span>, surpassing in number and<br/>
magnificence those of any other city <span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>Italy. Many of these palaces were<br/>
erected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gamma </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Aunt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>pupil of Michael Angelo, born <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Perugia<br/>

spite of occasional defects, Alessi's architecture is of <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>imposing and<br/>
uniform character, and displays great <span style="color: #0000FF;">ingenuity </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>making the best of an<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>and limited site. The palaces, moreover, contain a considerable number of works of art, while Rubens, who resided at Genoa in<br/>
<br/>
, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Van </span>Dyck at a later period, have preserved the memory of<br/>
many members of the noblesse. The native school of art, however, never<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>to importance, and was far from being <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefited </span>by the zeal of its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">artist</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in painting <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades</span>. The chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">punter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>were Luca Cambium (1527-85),<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bait</span>. Paggi (1554-1627), Benedetto <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gastiglione </span>(1616-70), and Bartolomeo<br/>

<br/>
Until recently the harbour consisted solely of the Porto or inner<br/>
harbour, which was closed on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mole </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Vecchio </span>(492 yds.<br/>
long), said to have been constructed in 1134, and by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moto </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nuova </span>(722 yds. long), dating from the 18th century. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1877-96</span>,<br/>
however, very extensive additions were made, a sum of 20 million<br/>
francs having been presented to the city for the purpose by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mar<br/>
