<br/>
</span>fail to strike the eye. Even the unskilled amateur will thus be<br/>
convinced of the abrupt contrast between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval </span>and the<br/>
Renaissance styles. Thus prepared, he may, for example, proceed<br/>
to inspect the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pitti </span>Palace at Florence, which, undecorated and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pnorganised </span>as it is, would scarcely be distinguishable from a rude<br/>
pile of stones, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>a judgment were formed from the mere description.<br/>
The artistic charm consists in the simplicity of the proportions,<br/>
the justness of proportion in the elevation of the stories, and the<br/>
tasteful adjustment of the windows in the vast surface of the facade. That the architects thoroughly understood the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aesthetic </span>effect<br/>
of symmetrical proportions is proved by the mode of construction adopted in the somewhat more recent Florentine palaces, in<br/>
which the roughly hewn blocks (rustica) in the successive stories<br/>
recede in gradations, and by their careful experiments as to whether<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">comics </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">surmounting </span>the structure should bear reference to the<br/>
highest story, or to the entire facade. The same bias manifests<br/>
itself in Bramante's imagination; and when, after the example of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Palladio </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">church-facades</span>, a single series of columns was substituted for those resting above one another, symmetry of proportion<br/>
was also the object in view.<br/>
<br/>
From the works of Brunelleschi (p. xlvi), the greatest master of<br/>
the Early Renaissance, down to those of Andrea Palladio of Vicenza (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">xlviii</span>), the last great architect of the Renaissance, the works<br/>
of all the architects of that period will be found to possess many<br/>
features in common. The style of the 15th century may, however,<br/>
easily be distinguished from that of the 16th. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Flor- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EARL</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rn</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amine </span>Pitti, Riccardi, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Strozzi </span>palaces are still based on <span style="color: #0000FF;">MESH</span>"<br/>
the type of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval </span>castle, but other contemporary creations<br/>
show <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>closer affinity to the forms and articulation of antique art.<br/>
A taste for beauty of detail, coeval with the realistic tendency of<br/>
painting, <span style="color: #ff0000;">producesjn </span>the architecture of the 15th century an extensive application of graceful and attractive ornaments, which entirely<br/>
cover the surfaces, and throw the real organisation of the edifice into<br/>
the background. For <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>time the true aim of Renaissance art appears<br/>
to have been departed <span style="color: #0000FF;">from</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>anxious care is devoted to detail instead<br/>
of to general effect; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-application </span>of columns did not at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">admit </span>of spacious structures; the dome rose but timidly above the<br/>
level of the roof. But this attention to minutiae, this disregard of<br/>
effect on the part of these architects, was only, as it were, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">restraining </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their power, in order the more completely to master,<br/>
the more grandly to develop the art<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>There is no doubt that the Renaissance <span style="color: #0000FF;">palaces </span>(among which<br/>
that of Urbino, mentioned in vol. ii of this Handbook, has always<br/>
been regarded <span style="color: #0000FF;">u </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pze-eminently </span>typical) are more attractive than the<br/>
churches. These last, however, though destitute of the venerable<br/>
associations connected with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>cathedrals, bear ample<br/>
testimony to the ability of their builders. The churches <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofNorthern<br/>
