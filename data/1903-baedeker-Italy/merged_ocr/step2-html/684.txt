<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>here as the heir of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maude</span>, who is by no means well <span style="color: #ff0000;">representedin </span>this gallery (Room IV, <span style="color: #ff0000;">No</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Toy </span>Filippo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lippi'e </span>Coronation of<br/>
the Virgin (Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>, No. 62), with a portrait of himself, belongs to<br/>
his later period. In this work the <span style="color: #0000FF;">master </span>obviously aims <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>sensuous<br/>
beauty in his female forms; he departs from the strictly ecclesiastical style and borrows various <span style="color: #0000FF;">efi'ects </span>from the province of sculpture. <span style="color: #ff0000;">WrroeehioU </span>Baptism of Christ (Room IV, No. 71), which,<br/>
according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vasari</span>, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>by his pupil Leonardo da <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vinci</span>,<br/>
betrays a certain crudity in the figure of the Baptist, while the<br/>
landscape and the two angels distantly recall Leonardo's technical<br/>
skill and sense of form. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sandra </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Botticelli</span>'s Spring (Room IV,<br/>
No. 80), which transports us to the realm of antique myth, is the<br/>
most popular picture in the gallery, owing to its fairy-like charm.<br/>
Domenico Ghirlandajo was thoroughly conversant with traditional<br/>
forms, and with their aid he has been enabled to produce majestic<br/>
and spirited figures, and to unite in them the result of the labour<br/>
of two generations. His Madonna and angels (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Room </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>, No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">66 </span>is<br/>
better preserved than the Nativity of Christ (Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">WI</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">N5</span>. 195).<br/>
A comparison of Ghirlandajo's simplicity of style, the outcome of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>mature imagination, with the elaborate and exaggerated manner<br/>
of many old masters, is most instructive. Lorenzo di Credi's Nativity<br/>
(Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">V</span>, No. 92) is attractive on account of its beauty of expression<br/>
and the careful execution of the landscape. Among Fra Bartolomeo's<br/>
pictures, Mary appearing to St. Bernard (Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">V</span>, No. 97) is <span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span>worthy of notice, as it <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>an insight into the master's<br/>
method of painting. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mariotto </span>Albertinelli, who is closely allied to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fra </span>Bartolomeo, is well represented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Trinity (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Boom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, No. 63);<br/>
his Annunciation (Room VII, No. 169) is no longer in its original<br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
This gallery is important also to the student of Umbrian art in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">16th </span>century. It possesses one of the chief works of Gentile da<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fabriano</span>, an Umbrian master, closely allied to Fra Angelica in his<br/>
modes of thought (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Adoration </span>of the Magi; Room XVI, No. 165). This<br/>
work affords distinct evidence of the unity of sentiment which<br/>
existed between the Schools of the North and South in the 15th cent.,<br/>
notwithstanding their external independence. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Perugino'a </span>pictures<br/>
are greatly above the average merit of his works: in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pieta<br/>
</span>(Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>, No. 56) an admirable individuality of character is exhibited; his skill as a colourist is shown in his Mount of Olives<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">53</span>); and his Assumption (57), admirable both in composition<br/>
and execution, reveals him at the zenith of his power.<br/>

with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>Flanders tapestry (scenes from the Creation), in the style<br/>
of Barend van Orley (d. 1541).<br/>
