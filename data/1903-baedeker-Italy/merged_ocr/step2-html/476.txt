<br/>
</span>2. A steamer plies to SAN MICHELE, the cemetery island (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cimetero</span>),<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">MUBANO</span>, 11/2 M. to the N. of Venice, every 1/4 hr., starting<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fondamenta </span>Nuove (Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">H</span>, 3; fare 10 c.). On the former<br/>
island stands the church of S. Michele, built by Moro Coducci after<br/>
1466, and next to San <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zaccaria </span>(p. 301) the oldest Renaissance<br/>
building in Venice. To the left of the vestibule is the tasteful little<br/>
Cappella Emiliana, erected by Gugl. Bergamasco in 1534, with three<br/>
admirable reliefs in the style of Andrea Sansovino, and in the vestibule Fra Paolo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sup</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Tomb (see Robertson's'Fra Paolo Sarpi').<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>P. R. James (<span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span>1860), the novelist, Eugene Schuyler (d. 1890),<br/>
and Rawdon Brown are buried in the Protestant Cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hanna</span>, a small island with 3600 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, has been, since the<br/>
14th cent., the seat of the Venetian Glass Industry, the followers<br/>
of which were held in so high esteem that Murano possessed its<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">own'Goldenc </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Book</span>' of descent, and minted its own coins. Its citizens<br/>
were eligible for the highest posts in the Republic, and after 1376<br/>
the children of a Venetian patrician and the daughter of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">glassmanufacturer </span>were able to inherit their father's rank.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place </span>of the steamboat we proceed in a straight<br/>
direction and soon reach SAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">Puma</span>, a simple and <span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious<br/>
