of Florence, was erected on the site of the earlier church of St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reparata</span>, which had been used as a cathedral since 1128. The erection<br/>
was decreed by a popular vote of 1294. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">architect </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arnolfo </span>di <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gambia</span>, who superintended the works from 1296 down to<br/>
his death in 1301 and was succeeded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">motto </span>(1334-36) and Andrea <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beano </span>(1336-49). In 1357 the plan was expanded, and the<br/>
nave with its spacious vaulting was begun from a design by Francesco<br/>
Talenti. The exterior was also farther ornamented with marble in<br/>
harmony with the original details. In 1366 a commission of 24 architects met to decide the form of the choir and the dome, and their<br/>
plan (of 1367) has since been adhered to. The three apses were<br/>
completed in 1407-21<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'On </span>19th August, 1418, was announced the<br/>
public competition for the technical execution of the dome, of which<br/>
Vasari has given so racy an account, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in which the genius of<br/>
Filippo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brunetteschi </span>secured the victory in spite of the jealousy of<br/>
rivals and the doubts of the cognoscenti. The construction of the<br/>
cupola took fourteen years (1420-34). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally<br/>
</span>consecrated on March 25th (the old Florentine New Year's Day),<br/>
1436, but the lantern on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">top </span>of the dome, also designed by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Brunelleschi</span>, was not completed till 1462. The building (larger<br/>
than all previous churches in Italy, comp. p. 366) is <span style="color: #ff0000;">656 </span>ft. in<br/>
length and <span style="color: #0000FF;">342 </span>ft. (across the octagon) in breadth; the dome is<br/>
300 ft. high, with the lantern 352 ft. (ascent, see p. 454). The nave<br/>
and aisles are adjoined, in place of a transept, by an octagonal domed<br/>
space, with three polygonal <span style="color: #0000FF;">specs</span>. The unfinished old facade (comp.<br/>
pp. 456, 491) was removed in 1588. The present facade was erected<br/>
in 1875-87 from the design of Emilio De Fabric (p. 456), which<br/>
originally contemplated three gables. The modern bronze <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-door<br/>
</span>on the N. is by Ant. Passaglia, that on the S. by Gina. Cassioli (1899).<br/>
<br/>
Above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>door on the S. side is a Madonna of the 14th century.<br/>
The decoration of the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>door is by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pure </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0W </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Twisted</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">15599</span>):<br/>
foliage with naked <span style="color: #0000FF;">putti</span>, foreshadowing the Renaissance spirit; in the<br/>
lunette, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Madonna </span>between two <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ele</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The corresponding'N. Door<br/>

Madonna with the girdle, over the door, is ascribed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">di </span>Bones<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1414</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. On the adjoining pillars are two figures by Donatello (early works;<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">106 </span>and 1408), who executed also the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophets</span>' heads in <span style="color: #0000FF;">tur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>

The Interior, though somewhat bare and dark, is very impressive<br/>
owing to its grand dimensions. The gallery detracts from the effect of the<br/>
arches. The choir is appropriately placed under the dome..<br/>
<br/>
On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-wall</span>, beside the main entrance is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marble statue of<br/>
Pope Boniface VIII., erroneously attributed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Andrea </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mans</span>, preserved<br/>
