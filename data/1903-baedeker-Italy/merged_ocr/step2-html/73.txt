<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1m </span>ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
The condition of Italian art, that of painting at least, improved<br/>
<br/>
to some extent towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">close </span>of the 16th century, when <span style="color: #ff0000;">thus<br/>
</span>was a kind of second <span style="color: #0000FF;">efflorescence</span>, known in the schools as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">553</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>" the'revival of good <span style="color: #0000FF;">taste</span>', which is said to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â° </span>manifested itself in two directions, the eclectic and the naturalistic. But these are terms of little or no moment in the study<br/>
of art, and the amateur had better disregard them. This period of art<br/>
also should be studied historically. The principal architectural <span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments </span>of the 17th century are the churches of the Jesuits, which<br/>
unquestionably produce a most imposing effect; but the historical<br/>
enquirer will not easily be dazzled by their <span style="color: #ff0000;">meretrioious </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">magnificence</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He </span>will perceive the absence of organic forms and the<br/>
impropriety of combining totally different styles, and he will steel<br/>
himself against the gorgeous, but monotonous attractions of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">painting</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and other works of the same period. The bright <span style="color: #0000FF;">Renaissance </span>is extinct, simple pleasure in the natural and human is ob. literated. A gradual change in the views of the Italian public and<br/>
in the position <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the church did not fail to <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>the tendencies<br/>
of art, and in the 17th century artists again devoted their energies<br/>
more immediately to the service of the church. Devotional <span style="color: #0000FF;">plume<br/>
</span>now became more frequent, but at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>time a sensual, naturalistic element gained ground. At one time it <span style="color: #0000FF;">veil</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>itself in beauty<br/>
of form, at another it is manifested in the representation of voluptuous and passionate emotions; classic dignity and noble symmetry<br/>
are never attained. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gmsrorono </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ALLonr</span>'s Judith (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">516</span>) should be<br/>
compared with the beauties of Titian, and the frescoes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amnun<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cannon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in the Palazzo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Famese </span>at Rome with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Raph-el</span>'s <span style="color: #ff0000;">ceilingpaintings </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farnesina</span>, in order that the difference between the<br/>
16th and 17th centuries may be clearly understood; and the enquirer<br/>
will be still farther aided by consulting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coeval </span>Italian poetry, and<br/>
observing the development of the lyric drama or <span style="color: #0000FF;">open</span>. The poetry of<br/>
the period thus furnishes a key to the mythological representations<br/>
of the School of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carracci</span>. Gems of art, however, were not unfrequently produced during the 17th century, and many of the frescoes<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>period are admirable, such as those by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gumo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RBNI </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Domamonnvo </span>at Rome. Beautiful oil-paintings by various masters<br/>
are also preserved in the galleries of Bologna (p. 362), Naples, and<br/>
elsewhere. The so-called <span style="color: #0000FF;">gallery-pieces</span>, figures and scenes designated by imposing titles, and painted in the prevailing taste of the<br/>
17th century, were readily received, and indeed most appropriately<br/>
placed in the palaces of the nobles. This retreat of art to the privacy<br/>
of the apartments of the great may be regarded as a symptom of the<br/>
universal withdrawal of the Italians from public life. Artists, too,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">henceforth </span>occupy an isolated position, unchecked by public opinion,<br/>
exposed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">caprices </span>of amateurs, and themselves inclined to an<br/>
arbitrary department. Several qualities, however, still exist of<br/>
which Italian artists are <span style="color: #ff0000;">never </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>entirely divested; they retain <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
