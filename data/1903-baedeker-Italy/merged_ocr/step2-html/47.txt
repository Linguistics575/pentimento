<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">significant </span>passages; the apse loses its intimate connection with<br/>
the nave, being separated from it; the most conspicuous feature<br/>
in the building <span style="color: #0000FF;">consist</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of the central square space, bounded<br/>
by four massive pillars which support the dome. These are the<br/>
essential characteristics of the Byzantine style, which culminates<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>church of St. Sophia at Constantinople, and prevails throughout Oriental Christendom, but in the West, including<br/>
Italy only, occurs sporadically. With the exception of the churches<br/>
of San Vitale at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Revenue</span>, and St. Mark at Venice, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of<br/>
Lower Italy alone show a frequent application of this style.<br/>
The Byzantine imagination does not appear to have exercised <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Glow</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>greater influence on the growth of other branches of Italian<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">tan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>art than on architecture. A brisk <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>in works of art<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>was carried on by Venice, Amalfi, and other Italian towns,<br/>
with the Levant; the position of Constantinople resembled that of<br/>
the modern Lyons; silk wares, tapestry, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">jewellery </span>were most<br/>
highly valued when imported from the Eastern metropolis. Byzantine artists were always welcome visitors to Italy, Italian connoisseurs ordered works to be executed at Constantinople, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>those in metal, and the superiority of Byzantine workmanship<br/>
was universally acknowledged. All this, however, does not justify<br/>
the inference that Italian art was quite subordinate to Byzantine.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">century</span>, notwithstanding various external <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences</span>, it<br/>
underwent an independent and unbiassed development, and never<br/>
entirely abandoned its ancient principles. A considerable interval<br/>
indeed elapsed before the fusion of the original inhabitants with<br/>
the early <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>immigrants was complete, before the aggregate<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>tribes, languages, customs, and ideas became blended<br/>
into a single nationality, and before the people attained <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient<br/>
</span>concentration and independence of spirit to devote themselves<br/>
successfully to the cultivation of art. Unproductive in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pro.vince </span>of art as this early period is, yet an entire departure from<br/>
native tradition, or a serious conflict of the latter with extraneous<br/>
innovation never took place. It may <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>admitted, that in the<br/>
massive columns and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cumbrous </span>capitals of the churches of Upper<br/>
Italy, and in the art of vaulting which was developed here at an<br/>
early period, symptoms of the Germanic character of the inhabitants <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>manifested, and that in the Lower Italian and especially<br/>
Sicilian structures, traces of Arabian and Norman <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>are<br/>
unmistakable. In the essentials, however, the foreigners continue<br/>
to be the recipients; the might of ancient tradition and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">national </span>idea of form might be repressed but they could not be<br/>
obliterated<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
</span>About the middle of the 11th century a zealous and <span style="color: #ff0000;">promisRouax- </span>ing artistic movement took place in Italy, and the seeds<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">35901</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>were sown which three or four centuries later yielded so<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flu</span>" <span style="color: #ff0000;">u- </span>luxuriant a growth. As yet nothing was matured, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing<br/>
