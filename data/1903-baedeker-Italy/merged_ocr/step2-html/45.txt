<span>xxxiv ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
Roman art, and a sudden and spontaneous invention of a new style.<br/>
But the eye and the hand adhere to custom more <span style="color: #0000FF;">tenaciously </span>than<br/>
the mind. While new ideas, and altered views of the character <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the Deity and the destination of man were entertained, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonted<br/>
<br/>
</span>forms were still necessarily employed in the expression of these<br/>
thoughts. Moreover the heathen sovereigns had by no means been<br/>
unremittingly hostile to Christianity the most bitter persecutions<br/>
did not take place till the 3rd century, and the new <span style="color: #0000FF;">doctrine- </span>were<br/>
permitted to expand, take deeper root, and organise themselves in<br/>
the midst of heathen society. The consequence was, that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">transition </span>from heathen to Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mela </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">art </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>gradual one, and<br/>
that in point of form early Christian art continued to follow up the<br/>
lessons of the ancient. The best proof of this is afforded by the<br/>
paintings in the Roman <span style="color: #ff0000;">Caraoouns</span>, the burial-places of the early<br/>
Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">community </span>In these the artistic principles of pagan<br/>
antiquity are adhered to, alike in decorative forms, design, choice<br/>
of colour, grouping of figures, and treatment of subject. Even the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sancornsens </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SCULPTUREB </span>of the 4th and 5th centuries <span style="color: #0000FF;">differ </span>in<br/>
purport only, and not in technical treatment, from the type exhibited<br/>
in the tomb-reliefs of heathen Rome. Five centuries elapsed before a new artistic style sprang up in painting and in the greatly<br/>
neglected plastic arts. Meanwhile architecture had developed itself<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">commensurately </span>with the requirements of Christian worship, and,<br/>
in connection with the new modes of building, painting acquired a<br/>
different character.<br/>
<br/>
The term <span style="color: #0000FF;">BASILICA </span>STYLE <span style="color: #ff0000;">is'often </span>employed to designate early<br/>
Christian architecture down to the 10th century. The Roman<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancar'rnc- </span>forensic basilicas, which are proved to have existed in the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>fora of most of the towns of the Roman empire, served as<br/>
courts of judicature and public <span style="color: #0000FF;">assembly-halls</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The belief that<br/>
these were afterwards fitted up for the purposes of Christian worship<br/>
is now exploded, but in their main features they served as models<br/>
for the construction of Christian churches. After the 4th cent.<br/>
the following became the established type of the Christian <span style="color: #ff0000;">hasilica</span>. In front is a quadrangular fore-court (atrium), of the same<br/>
width as the basilica itself, surrounded with an open colonnade<br/>
and provided with a fountain (cantharus) for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ablutions </span>of the<br/>
devout. This forms the approach to the interior of the church,<br/>
which usually consisted of a nave and two aisles, the latter lower<br/>
than the former, and separated from it by two rows of columns, the<br/>
whole terminating in a semicircle <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>apsis). In front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">apse </span>there<br/>
was sometimes a transverse space (transept); the altar, surmounted<br/>
by a columnar structure, occupied a detached position in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">apes</span>;<br/>
the space in front of it, bounded by cancelli or railings, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>destined for the choir of <span style="color: #0000FF;">officiating </span>priests, and contained the <span style="color: #0000FF;">two<br/>
</span>pulpits (ambones) where the gospel and epistles were read. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Un<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">like </span>the ancient temples, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">early-iChristian </span>basilicas exhibit <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
