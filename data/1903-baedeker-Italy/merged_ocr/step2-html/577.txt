early period, as for example at Athens and <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Germany, where numerous<br/>
discoveries of ancient Etruscan <span style="color: #ff0000;">iron-work </span>have been made. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">artof<br/>
</span>navigation was simultaneously <span style="color: #ff0000;">develOped</span>. The earliest naval battle in<br/>
the western part of the Mediterranean handed down by tradition (about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">3.0</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">537</span>), was fought between the Greeks and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Etruscans </span>for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">possession </span>of Corsica, and resulted in the victory of the latter, who thus obtained<br/>
supremacy over the sea still known as the Tyrrhenian. The League<br/>
of the Etruscan Towns, which extended from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">footer </span>the Alps to the<br/>
Bay of Naples was also instrumental in promoting civilisation, as it <span style="color: #ff0000;">was<br/>
</span>the means <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">diffusing </span>a knowledge of writing, as well <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mechanical </span>arts, and to some extent <span style="color: #0000FF;">influenced </span>even Latium and Rome itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The Etruscan Museum at Florence <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>opportunity of<br/>
becoming acquainted with the artistic products of this ancient people in<br/>
bronze and earthenware, and obtaining an insight into their gloomy and<br/>
realistic disposition. At Fiesole our attention will then be <span style="color: #0000FF;">directed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the huge stone structures erected by the Etruscans to defend their frontier<br/>
against the predatory <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ligurians </span>of the Apennines. The connection<br/>
between antiquity and modern times is not very apparent in this part of<br/>
the country, as the classic soil of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Etruria </span>lies somewhat to the 8. of the<br/>
limits prescribed to the present Handbook. None of the twelve <span style="color: #0000FF;">great<br/>
</span>cities which divided among them the supremacy over the whole country<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.on </span>the Arno; and the beautiful valleys which now delight the eye of<br/>
the traveller, being exposed to the continual incursions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ligurians<br/>
</span>were marshy and desolate down to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">3rd </span>cent. B. C., and did not<br/>
prosper till the time of the Romans. The history of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Etruscans </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>nevertheless appropriately be kept in view. If Florence forcibly<br/>
reminds the visitor at every step that modern Italy owes its noblest <span style="color: #0000FF;">aspirations </span>and richest intellectual inheritance to this city and this land, the<br/>
student of history will be interested in remembering that the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">disseminatin </span>civilisation among their compatriots was performed by the<br/>
Etruscans <span style="color: #ff0000;">2050 </span>years before the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>of the country.<br/>
The power of the ancient Etruscans attained its zenith in the 6th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">eent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BAM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but owing to the want of political coherence in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">widely<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ramitled </span>confederation, they were unable permanently to maintain <span style="color: #ff0000;">then<br/>
</span>supremacy. As the whole of N. Italy had been conquered by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cell-It<br/>
</span>and Campania by the Samnites (in <span style="color: #0000FF;">MO</span>, so the Romans and Latins from<br/>
the lower Tiber gradually <span style="color: #0000FF;">encroached </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Etruria</span>, and after protracted<br/>
struggles wrested city after city from the confederation. In the 3rd cent<br/>
the entire country thus became subject to the authority of Rome. <span style="color: #ff0000;">B</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
</span>the establishment of numerous colonies, and abundant grants of the<br/>
Roman citizenship, the country was gradually Latinised, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Etrusch<br/>
</span>language, which has been handed down to <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">several </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">still<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">undeciphered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, was superseded by Latin. Some of the<br/>
peculiarities of the Tuscan dialect, such as the slight aspiration of the a<br/>
before a (chase for <span style="color: #0000FF;">case</span>), are thought to be referable to the old <span style="color: #ff0000;">langtmflo<br/>
</span>of the country, but this is matter of mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minimum</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">acquainted </span>with Italian will have little <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in understanding <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>people of the country, as the modern written Italian language (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1W<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vulgaris</span>, vulgare latinum, lingua toscana) is <span style="color: #0000FF;">mainly </span>derived from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>dialects of Central Italy, and particularly that of Tuscany. <span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">languag'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>proved to have been used as early as the 10th cent. by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">educa<br/>
</span>classes, as well as Latin, but Dante and the great Tuscan poets and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pro</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
