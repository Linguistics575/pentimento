celebrated "Last Supper of Leonardo da <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vinoi </span>(no <span style="color: #0000FF;">vim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>; see p. 115).<br/>
The picture is unfortunately in bad preservation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>from having<br/>
been painted on the wall in oils (before 1499). In the same room<br/>
are also exhibited numerous photographs, and contemporaneous<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">copies </span>by Andrea Salado, Cesare del Magno, Marco <span style="color: #0000FF;">d</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">09950110</span>, and<br/>
Ant. de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Glaxiate</span>, an inspection of which much facilitates the study<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">original</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The large fresco by Giov. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Donate </span>Montorfano<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Crucifixion</span>) of 1495, opposite the Last Supper, is in much better<br/>
condition. The kneeling <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of Duke <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lodovico </span>i1 Moro <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hi</span>)<br/>
and his wife Bianca Maria with their children are by Leon. da<br/>
Vinci, the trace of whose hand is still distinguishable.<br/>
<br/>
Deplorable as is the condition of the Last Supper, the chief work<br/>
executed by Leon. <span style="color: #0000FF;">da </span>Vinci during his stay at Milan, the original alone exhibits to its full extent the emotions which the master intended to express, and which even the best <span style="color: #0000FF;">cOpies </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fail </span>to re reduce. The motive of<br/>
the work has been well explained by Goethe:' he artist represents the<br/>
peaceful little <span style="color: #ff0000;">band </span>round the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacred </span>table as <span style="color: #0000FF;">thunder-struck </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Master's<br/>
</span>words, One of you shall betray me. They have been pronounced<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the whole<br/>
company is in dismay, while he himself <span style="color: #0000FF;">bows </span>his head with <span style="color: #0000FF;">downcast<br/>
</span>eyes. His whole attitude, the motion of his arms and hands, <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seem </span>to<br/>
repeat with heavenly resignation, and his silence to confirm, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mournful<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">words </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'It </span>cannot be otherwise. One of you shall betray <span style="color: #0000FF;">mel</span>' Comp.<br/>

</span>The Via Caradosso and the Via Boccaccio lead hence to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Costello- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>129<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>In the Piazzale Michelangelo Buonarotti, beyond<br/>
the former Porta Magenta (Pl. A, <span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>), is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Case </span>di Riposo <span style="color: #0000FF;">poi </span>Musicisti, a home of rest for musicians, established in 1899 by Verdi<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">d. </span>1901), who is buried here. There is also the nucleus of a Verdi<br/>
Museum. [ Some reminiscences of Verdi are also preserved in a<br/>
room in the Grand <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotel </span>Milan (p. 112), where he died<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>From Santa Maria delle Grazie the Via delle Oche and the Via<br/>
San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vino-re </span>(Pl. B, 6),<br/>
a baroque building by Galeazzo Alessi (1560), interesting for its<br/>
elaborate internal decoration. A little farther on we pass the S. end<br/>
of the Via San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gerolamo</span>, part of the ancient route round the ramparts, in which rises the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palazzo </span>Gonzaga (No. 30), immediately<br/>
to the left, built in 1900 in the Lombard style by Cecilio <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arpesani</span>.<br/>
At the end of the Via San Vittore is the large PIAZZA <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammonia<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nant</span>' <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ambrogio </span>(Pl. 0, <span style="color: #0000FF;">G</span>), founded by St. Ambrose in the 4th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, but probably dating in its present Romanesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">basilica </span>form,<br/>
with its peculiar galleries and an octagonal <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupola </span>over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">highaltar</span>, from the 12th century. The fine atrium in front of the church,<br/>
containing remains of ancient tombstones, inscriptions, and frescoes<br/>
seems, like the facade, to have preserved the architectural forms <span style="color: #ff0000;">01<br/>
</span>the original building. St. Ambrosius baptized St. Augustine here<br/>
in 387, and in 389 he closed the doors of this church against the<br/>
Emp. Theodosius after the cruel massacre of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thessalonica</span>. There<br/>
is a portrait of the saint on the left side of the principal entrance<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
