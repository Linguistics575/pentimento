<span>ITALIAN ART. xlvii<br/>
<br/>
The early Renaissance is succeeded <span style="color: #0000FF;">try </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bumm</span>'s epoch (14441514), with which <span style="color: #0000FF;">hogan </span>the golden age'of symmetrical construction. With a wise economy the mere decorative portions <span style="color: #0000FF;">2mm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>were circumscribed, while greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance </span>and more or <span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rrp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">marked </span>expression were imparted to the true constituents "<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span>"" <span style="color: #0000FF;">03'<br/>
</span>of the structure, the real exponents of the architectural design.<br/>
The works of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bramantine </span>era are less graceful and attractive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>those of their predecessors, but superior in their well defined,<br/>
lofty simplicity and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>character. Had the Church of St. Peter<br/>
been completed in the form originally designed by Bramante, we<br/>
could have pronounced a more decided opinion as to the ideal of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">church</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture </span>of the Renaissance. The circumstance that the<br/>
grandest work of this style has been subjected to the most varied<br/>
alterations (and vastness of dimensions was the principal aim of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">architects</span>) teaches us to refrain from the indiscriminate blame which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>commonly <span style="color: #0000FF;">mu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to the lot of Renaissance churches. It must at<br/>
least be admitted that the favourite form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Greek cross with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rounded </span>extremities, crowned by a dome, possesses concentrated<br/>
unity, and that the pillar-construction relieved by <span style="color: #0000FF;">niches </span>presents<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>most majestic appearance; nor can it be disputed that in the<br/>
churches of the Renaissance the same artistic principles are applied<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in the universally admired palaces and secular <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>the<br/>
former therefore excite less interest, this is not due to the inferiority of the architects, but to causes beyond their control. The<br/>
great masters <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this culminating period of the Renaissance were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Barnum </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">BALDASSABB </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">P3313221</span>, the younger ANTONIO DA SANGALLO<br/>
of Rome, <span style="color: #0000FF;">MICHEL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SANMICHELI </span>of Verona (p. 223), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jaooro </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sstomo </span>of Venice, and lastly MICHAEL ANGELO. The succeeding generation of the 16th century did not adhere to the style introduced by<br/>
Bramante, though not reduced by him to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>finished system. They<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span>more sedulously at general <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>, so that harmony among the<br/>
individual members begins to be neglected; they endeavour to arrest<br/>
the eye by boldness of construction and striking contrasts; or they<br/>
borrow new modes of expression <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>antiquity, the precepts of<br/>
which had hitherto been applied in an unsystematic manner only.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will become acquainted with the works of Bramante<br/>
and his contemporaries at Rome (see vol. ii of this Hand- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Famous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">REbook</span>), but there are other places also which possess important <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harssanca<br/>
</span>examples of the'High <span style="color: #0000FF;">Renaissance</span>' style. At Florence, for <span style="color: #ff0000;">BummmsÂ°<br/>
</span>example, are the Palazzo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pandolfi-ni </span>and the Palazzo Uguccioni,<br/>
the former of which is said to have been designed by RAPHAEL; <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Court of the Pitti Palace by BART. AMMANATI; the Palazzo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serristori<br/>
</span>and the Palazzo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bartolini </span>by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bxccro </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">D'Aenono</span>. We must also<br/>
mention Mantua as the scene of the architectural labours <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">GIULIO<br/>
