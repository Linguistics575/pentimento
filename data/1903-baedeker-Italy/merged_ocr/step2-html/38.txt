quent; and the humidity of the atmosphere, occasioned in part by<br/>
the numerous canals and <span style="color: #ff0000;">rice-marshes</span>, is also very considerable.<br/>
A prolonged residence in Turin or Milan should therefore be avoided<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>invalids, while even robust travellers should be on their guard<br/>
against the trying climate. As we approach the Adriatic Sea the<br/>
climate of the Lombard plain loses its continental character and<br/>
approximates <span style="color: #ff0000;">moreclosely </span>to that of the rest of the peninsula. The<br/>
climatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiarities </span>of Venice are described at p. 264.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as we cross the mountains which bound the S. margin<br/>
of the Lombard plain and reach the Mediterranean coast, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>remarkable change in the climatic conditions. Here an almost uninterrupted series of winter-resorts extends along the Lig <span style="color: #0000FF;">mien<br/>
</span>Riviera as far <span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span>as Leghorn, and these are rapidly increasing<br/>
both in number and popularity. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cause </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the mild <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>pleasant climate at these places is not far to seek. The Maritime<br/>
Alps and the Ligurian Apennines form such an admirable screen<br/>
on the N., that the cold N. winds <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pass </span>these mountains do<br/>
not touch the district immediately at their feet, but are first perceptible on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea </span>6-10 M. from the coast. It is of no unfrequent<br/>
occurrence in the Riviera that the harbours are perfectly smooth<br/>
while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>sea is agitated by a brisk tempest. Most of the towns<br/>
and villages on the coast lie in <span style="color: #0000FF;">crescent-shaped </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bays</span>, opening<br/>
towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8.</span>, while on the landward side they are protected by<br/>
an amphitheatre of hills. These hills are exposed to the full force<br/>
of the sun's rays, and the limestone of which they are composed<br/>
absorbs an immense amount of heat. It is therefore not to be<br/>
wondered at that these hothouses of the Riviera show a higher temperature in winter than many places much farther to the S. Thus,<br/>
while the mean temperature of Rome in the three coldest months <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MP </span>Fahr., that of the Riviera is 48-50° (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Newt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, San Remo 50°;<br/>
Pisa, on the other hand, only 42°)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that this strip of<br/>
coast is entirely free from wind. The rapid heating and cooling of<br/>
the strand produces numerous light breezes, while the rarefaction<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mule</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>of air by the strength of the sun gives rise to strong<br/>
currents rushing in from the E. and W. to supply the vacuum.<br/>
The most notorious of these coast-winds is the Mistral, which is<br/>
at its <span style="color: #0000FF;">went </span>at Avignon and other places in the Rhone Valley (see<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Baedeker</span>'s Southern France). The N.E. wind on the contrary<br/>
is much stronger in Alassio and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun </span>Remo than on the coast of<br/>
Provence<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scirocco </span>as known on the Ligurian. coast is by no<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mean </span>the dry and parching wind experienced in Sicily and even<br/>
at Rome; passing as it does over immense tracts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">see</span>, it is generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">charged </span>with moisture and is often followed by rain.<br/>
<br/>
The prevalent belief that the Riviera has a moist climate, on<br/>
account of its proximity to the sea, is natural but erroneous. The<br/>
atmosphere, on the contrary, is rather dry, especially in the W<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
