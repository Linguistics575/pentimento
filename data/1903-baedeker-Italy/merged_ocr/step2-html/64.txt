</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Humane </span>(1431-1506; at Padua and Mantua) derive<br/>
much interest from having exercised a marked <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>on the<br/>
German masters Holbein and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diirer</span>, and surpass all the other works<br/>
of his time in fidelity to nature and excellence of perspective<br/>
(p. 222<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>The earlier masters of the Venetian School (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Vivanmr</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Guyana</span>) were to some extent adherents of the Paduan school, to<br/>
which Mantegna belonged, but the peculiar Venetian style, mainly<br/>
founded on local characteristics, and admirably successful in its rich<br/>
portraiture of noble and dignified personages, was soon afterwards<br/>
elaborated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Game </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">1427-1507</span>) and his brother <span style="color: #ff0000;">Grovam </span>(1428-1516), sons of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giacomo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Umbrian </span>School also,<br/>
which originated at Gubbio, and is admirably represented early in<br/>
the 15th century by <span style="color: #ff0000;">OrravIANO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NBLLI</span>, blending with the Tuscan<br/>
school in <span style="color: #ff0000;">GBZNTILB </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nA </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">FAnnrANo </span>(ca. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1370-1428</span>) and culminating<br/>
in its last masters <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pmrno </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">VANUcoI</span>, surnamed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pnnuemo </span>(14461524), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">BERNAnDINo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bn'r'rr</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unmanned </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">memomno </span>(14541513), merits attention, not only because Raphael was one of its<br/>
adherents during his first period, but because it supplements the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">blond</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Florentine style, and notwithstanding its peculiar and limited bias is impressive in its character of lyric sentiment and religious devotion (e. <span style="color: #ff0000;">g</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Madonnas)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The fact that the various points of excellence were distributed<br/>
among different local schools showed the necessity of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftier </span>union.<br/>
Transcendent <span style="color: #0000FF;">talent </span>was requisite in order harmoniously to <span style="color: #0000FF;">UNION </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>,<br/>
combine what could hitherto be viewed separately only. <span style="color: #ff0000;">nrrraassr<br/>
</span>The 15th century, notwithstanding all its attractiveness, <span style="color: #0000FF;">50500</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shows </span>that the climax of art was still unattained. The forms employed, graceful and pleasing though they be, are not yet lofty and<br/>
pure enough to be regarded as embodiments of the highest and<br/>
noblest conceptions. The figures still present a local colouring,<br/>
having been selected by the artists <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>physically attractive, rather<br/>
than as characteristic and expressive of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men</span>. A portrait style<br/>
still predominates, the actual representation does not appear<br/>
always wisely balanced with the internal <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance </span>of the' event,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the dramatic element is <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficiently </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">emphasised</span>. The most<br/>
abundant scope was therefore now <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>for the labours of the<br/>
great <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumvirate</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">LEONAnno </span>DA <span style="color: #ff0000;">VINOI</span>, MICHAEL ANGELO <span style="color: #0000FF;">1300111311011</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ind </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun</span>, by whom an entirely new era was <span style="color: #0000FF;">inaugurated</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Leonardo's (1452-1519) remarkable character can only be <span style="color: #0000FF;">thor-r<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oughly </span>understood after prolonged study. His comprehensive<br/>
genius was only partly devoted to art; he also directed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laoanno<br/>
</span>his attention to <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>and practical pursuits of an entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">DA </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wma</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>nature. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Refinement </span>and versatility may be described as<br/>
the goal of his aspirations; a division of labour, a partition<br/>
of individual tasks were principles unknown to him. He laid,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it were, his entire personality into the scale in all that <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
