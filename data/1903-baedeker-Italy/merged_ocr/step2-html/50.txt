arches and gables, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finials </span>and canopies, prove that an organic<br/>
coherence of the different architectural distinguishing members was<br/>
here but little considered. The characteristics of Gothic architecture,<br/>
the towers immediately connected with the facade, and the prominent <span style="color: #0000FF;">flying </span>buttresses are frequently wanting in Italian Gothic <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>whether to their disadvantage, it may be doubted. It is not<br/>
so much the sumptuousness of the materials which disposes the<br/>
spectator to pronounce a lenient judgment, as a feeling that Italian<br/>
architects pursued the only course by which the Gothic style could<br/>
be reconciled with the atmosphere and light, the climate and natural,<br/>
features of Italy. Gothic <span style="color: #ff0000;">lostmuch </span>of its peculiar character in Italy,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>by these deviations from the customary type it there became<br/>
capable of being nationalised, especially as at the same period the<br/>
other branches of art also aimed at a greater degree of nationality, and<br/>
entered into a new combination with the fundamental trait of the<br/>
Italian character. that of retrospective adherence to the antique.<br/>
<br/>
The apparently sudden and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unprepared-for </span>revival of ancient<br/>
ideals in the 13th century is one of the most interesting phenomena<br/>
in the history of art. The Italians themselves could only <span style="color: #0000FF;">REVIVAL<br/>
</span>account for this by attributing it to chance. The popular or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman-r<br/>
</span>story was that the sculptor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Niccom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Prune </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ca</span>. 1206-80) <span style="color: #0000FF;">ART </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Inum<br/>
</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>induced by an inspection of ancient sarcophagi to exchange the<br/>
prevailing style for the ancient, and indeed in one case we can trace<br/>
back a work <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his to its antique prototype. We refer to a relief on<br/>
the pulpit in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baptistery </span>at Pisa, several <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>in which are<br/>
borrowed from a Bacchus vase still preserved in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Campo </span>Santo<br/>
of that city (pp. 408, 410). Whether Niccolo Pisano was a member<br/>
of a local school or was trained under foreign influences we are as<br/>
yet unable to determine. His sculptures on the pulpits in the<br/>
Baptistery of Pisa and the Cathedral of Siena introduce us at once<br/>
into a new world. It is not merely their obvious resemblance to the<br/>
works of antiquity that arrests the eye; a still higher charm is<br/>
exercised by the peculiarly fresh and direct life that animates the<br/>
separate figures. By his son, Giovanni Pisano (ca.1250- ca.1328) and<br/>
his followers of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harm </span>School, ancient characteristics were placed<br/>
in the background, and importance was attached solely to life and<br/>
expression (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>reliefs on the facade of the Cathedral at Orvieto).<br/>
Artists now began to impart to their compositions the impress of their<br/>
own peculiar views, and the public taste for poetry, which had already<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">strongly </span>manifested itself, was now succeeded by a love of art also.<br/>
<br/>
From this period (14th century) therefore the Italians date the<br/>
origin of their modern art. Contemporaneous writers who <span style="color: #0000FF;">ob- </span>RISE <span style="color: #ff0000;">0</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>served the change of views, the revolution in sense of form, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mommy<br/>
</span>and the'superiority of the more recent works in life and ex- <span style="color: #0000FF;">ART<br/>
