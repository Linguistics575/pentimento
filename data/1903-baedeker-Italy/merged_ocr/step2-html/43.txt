<span>xxxii ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
criminate confusion of Greek and Roman styles is no longer to be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gnu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>apprehended. We are now well aware that the highest <span style="color: #ff0000;">perRomuz </span>fection of ancient architecture is realised in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Humane<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SH</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DIB-t </span>temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">alone </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>order, in which majestic gravity is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>" <span style="color: #ff0000;">9</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>expressed by massive proportions and by a symmetrical decoration, which at the same time subserves a practical purpose,<br/>
and the Ionic structure, with its lighter and more graceful character, exhibit a creative spirit entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>from that <span style="color: #0000FF;">manifested </span>in the sumptuous Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>. Again, the most valuable<br/>
collection of ancient sculptures in Italy <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>incapable of <span style="color: #ff0000;">aflording </span>so<br/>
admirable an insight into the development of Greek art as the sculptures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Parthenon and other fragments of Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-architecture </span>preserved in the British Museum. But, while instruction is<br/>
afforded more abundantly by other than Italian sources, ancient art<br/>
is perhaps thoroughly admired in Italy alone, where works of art<br/>
encounter the eye with more appropriate adjuncts, and where climate,<br/>
scenery, and people materially contribute to intensify their impressiveness. An additional facility, moreover, is afforded by the circumstance, that in accordance with an admirable custom of classic<br/>
antiquity the once perfected type of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>plastic <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>was not again<br/>
arbitrarily abandoned, but rigidly adhered to, and continually reproduced. Thus in numerous cases, where the more ancient Greek<br/>
original had been lost, it was preserved in subsequent copies; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">even </span>in the works of the Roman imperial age Hellenic creative talent<br/>
is still reflected.<br/>
This supremacy of Greek intellect in Italy was established in a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>twofold manner. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>Greek colonists <span style="color: #ff0000;">introsurnnmr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rs </span>duced their ancient native style into their new homes. This<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. is proved by the existence of several <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>temples in Sicily,<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Temple of Neptune at Paestum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>well <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>by the<br/>
ruins <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Metapontum</span>. But, in the second place, the art of the Greeks<br/>
did not attain its universal supremacy in Italy till a later period,<br/>
when Hellas, nationally <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined</span>, had learned to obey the dictates of<br/>
her mighty conqueror, and the Romans had begun to combine with<br/>
their political superiority the <span style="color: #0000FF;">refinements </span>of more advanced culture.<br/>
The ancient scenes of artistic activity in Greece (Athens for example)<br/>
became <span style="color: #0000FF;">re</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'d </span>at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cost </span>of Rome; Greek works of art and<br/>
Greek artists were introduced into Italy; and ostentatious pride in<br/>
the magnificence of booty acquired by victory led by an easy transition to a taste for such objects. To surround themselves with artistic<br/>
decoration thus gradually became the universal custom of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Romans</span>, and the foundation of public monuments came to be regarded<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>an indispensable duty of <span style="color: #0000FF;">government</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Although the Roman works of art of the imperial epoch <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>deficient in originality compared with the Greek, yet their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Anonr'rnc- </span>authors never degenerate into <span style="color: #0000FF;">mere </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">copyists</span>, or entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">reTUBE- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nounce </span>independent <span style="color: #0000FF;">efl'ort</span>. This remark <span style="color: #0000FF;">applies </span>especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
