abounds in works by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lounannr</span>, including <span style="color: #ff0000;">Annssannno </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lnomam </span>(d. 1522), the most famous sculptor of his period; <span style="color: #0000FF;">chero </span>or<br/>

<br/>
Among the various works executed by these masters, Monumental<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>largely predominate. While these monuments are often of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>somewhat bombastic character, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>an excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">illustration </span>of the high value attached to individuality and personal<br/>
culture during the Renaissance period. We may perhaps also frequently take exception to the monotony of their style, which<br/>
remained almost unaltered for a whole century, but we cannot fail<br/>
to derive genuine pleasure from the inexhaustible freshness of<br/>
imagination and richness of detail displayed within so narrow limits.<br/>
<br/>
As museums cannot convey an adequate idea of the sculpture<br/>
of the 15th century, <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>the picture galleries will not afford an<br/>
accurate insight into the painting of that period. Sculp- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">taxes </span>are frequently removed from their original position, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">nu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meny </span>of those belonging to the Florentine churches, for <span style="color: #ff0000;">QWWNTOexample</span>, having been of late transferred to museums; but mural<br/>
paintings are of course generally inseparable from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>which<br/>
they adorn. 0f the frescoes of the 15th century of which a record <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>been preserved, perhaps one-half have been destroyed or obliterated,<br/>
but those still <span style="color: #0000FF;">extent </span>are the most instructive <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">attractive </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">examples </span>of the art of this period. The mural paintings in the church<br/>
of Santa Maria <span style="color: #ff0000;">dcl </span>Carmine (Cappella <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brancacci</span>) at Florence <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>509)<br/>
are usually spoken of as the earliest specimens of the painting of<br/>
the Renaissance. On material grounds the <span style="color: #0000FF;">classification </span>is justifiable,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>this cycle of pictures may be regarded as a programme of the<br/>
earlier art of the Renaissance, the importance of which it served to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">maintain</span>, even during the age of Raphael. Here the beauty of the<br/>
nude was first revealed, and here a calm dignity was for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>time imparted to the individual figures, as well as to the general<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangement</span>; and the transformation of a group of <span style="color: #0000FF;">indifferent </span>spectators in the composition into a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sympathising </span>choir, forming as it were<br/>
a frame to the principal actors in the scene, was first successfully<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elected</span>. It is, therefore, natural that these frescoes should still be<br/>
regarded <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>models for imitation, and that, when the attention of<br/>
connoisseurs was again directed during the 18th century to the<br/>
beauties of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prts-Raphaelite </span>period, the works of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MASOIJNO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>)<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Masaooro </span>(1401-28) should have been eagerly rescued from<br/>
oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
A visit to the churches and <span style="color: #0000FF;">convents </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Florence </span>is well calculated<br/>
to convey an idea of the subsequent rapid development of the art of<br/>
