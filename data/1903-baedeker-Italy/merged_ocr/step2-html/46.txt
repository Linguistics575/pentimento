<span>ITALIAN ART. xxxv<br/>
<br/>
neglect of external architecture, the chief importance being attached to the interior, the decorations of which, however, especially<br/>
in early <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaval </span>times, were often procured by plundering the<br/>
ancient Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>, and transferring the spoil to the churches<br/>
with little regard to harmony of style and material. The most appropriate ornaments of the churches were the metallic objects, such<br/>
as crosses and lustres, and the tapestry bestowed on them by papal<br/>
piety; while the chief decoration of the walls consisted of mosaics,<br/>
especially those covering the background of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">apse </span>and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'triumphal</span>' arch which separates the apse from the nave. The<br/>
mosaics, as far at least as the material was concerned, were of a<br/>
sterling monumental character, and contributed to give rise to a<br/>
new style of pictorial art; in them ancient tradition was for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â« </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>time abandoned, and the harsh and austere style erroneously<br/>
termed Byzantine gradually <span style="color: #ff0000;">introduced</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Christian art originated at Rome, but its development was<br/>
actively promoted in other Italian districts, especially at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ravnnxa</span>,<br/>
where during the Ostrogothic supremacy (<span style="color: #ff0000;">493-539</span>), as well<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>under the succeeding Byzantine empire, architecture<br/>
was zealously cultivated. The basilica-type was there more<br/>
highly matured, the external architecture enlivened by <span style="color: #0000FF;">low </span>arches<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>projecting buttresses, and the capitals of the columns in the<br/>
interior appropriately moulded with reference to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">superinoumbent </span>arches. There, too, the art of mosaic painting was <span style="color: #0000FF;">sedulously </span>cultivated, exhibiting in its earlier specimens (in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bap</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tinny </span>of the Orthodox and Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Galla </span>Placidia) greater technical<br/>
excellence and better drawing than the contemporaneous Roman<br/>
works. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Revenue </span>the Western style also appears in combination<br/>
with the Eastern, and the church of San Vitals (dating from 547)<br/>
may be regarded as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>example of a Byzantine structure.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">term'BszAarrrms</span>' is often misapplied. Every work of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">walled </span>dark centuries of the middle ages, everything in architecture that intervenes between the ancient and the Gothic, everything in painting which repels by its uncouth, ill-proportioned<br/>
forms, is apt to be termed Byzantine; and it is commonly supposed<br/>
that the practice of art in Italy was entrusted exclusively to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Byzantine </span>hands from the fall of the Western Empire to an <span style="color: #0000FF;">adVanced </span>period of the 13th century. This belief in the universal<br/>
_ and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unqualified </span>prevalence of the Byzantine style, as well <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the<br/>
idea that it is invariably of a clumsy and lifeless character, is<br/>
entirely unfounded. The forms of Byzantine architecture are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>least strongly and clearly defined. While the basilica is a<br/>
long-extended hall, over which the eye is compelled to<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>range<br/>
until it <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>a natural <span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-place </span>in the recess of the apse,<br/>
every Byzantine structure may be circumscribed with a curved<br/>
line. The aisles, which in the basilica run parallel with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">line</span>, degenerate in the Byzantine style to <span style="color: #ff0000;">narrow- </span>and in<br/>
