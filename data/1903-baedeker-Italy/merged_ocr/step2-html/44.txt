<span>ITALIAN ART. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xx </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">xiii<br/>
<br/>
</span>their ARCHITECTURE. Independently of the Greeks, the ancient Italian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">undone</span>, and with them the Romans, had acquired a knowledge of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-cutting</span>, and discovered the method of constructing arches<br/>
and vaulting. With this technically and <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientifically </span>important<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>they aimed at combining Greek forms, the column supporting<br/>
the entablature. The sphere of architecture was then gradually extended. One of the chief requirements was now to construct <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices<br/>
</span>with spacious interiors, and several stories in height. No precise<br/>
model was afforded by Greek architecture, and yet the current<br/>
Greek forms <span style="color: #0000FF;">appeared'too </span>beautiful to be lightly disregarded. The<br/>
Romans therefore preferred to combine them with the arch-principle, and apply this combination to their new architectural designs.<br/>
The individuality of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Week </span>orders, and their originally <span style="color: #0000FF;">unalterable </span>coherence were thereby <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificed</span>, and divested of much<br/>
of their importance; that which once possessed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">definite </span>organic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">significance </span>frequently assumed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">superficial </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">decorative </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">character</span>; but the aggregate effect is always imposing. Attention must be<br/>
directed to the several-storied structures, in which the tasteful as-.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sending </span>gradation of the component parts, from the more massive<br/>
(Doric) to the lighter (Corinthian), chiefly arrests the eye; and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Vast </span>and artistically vaulted interiors, as well as the structures of a<br/>
merely decorative description, must also be examined, in order that<br/>
the chief merits of Roman art may be understood. In the use of<br/>
columns in front of closed walls (<span style="color: #0000FF;">6.9. </span>as members of a facade), in<br/>
the construction of domes above circular interiors, and of cylindrical<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">groined </span>vaulting over oblong spaces, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>have<br/>
served as models to posterity, and the imitations have often <span style="color: #0000FF;">fallen<br/>
</span>short of the originals.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that <span style="color: #0000FF;">111 </span>the districts to which this volume of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbook </span>is devoted, the splendour and beauty of ancient art is not so<br/>
prominently illustrated as in Rome or <span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Italy. Nevertheless N.<br/>

and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sam</span>, etc.), and the traveller .will find ample food for his admiration in the antique sculptures in the collections at Turin, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Breach</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mantua</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Upper Italy and Tuscany stand, on the<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>sunk <span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>Rome to its nadir. In order, however, to place <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>reader at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>proper point of view for appreciating the development<br/>

of Italian art in general from the early middle ages onwards.<br/>
