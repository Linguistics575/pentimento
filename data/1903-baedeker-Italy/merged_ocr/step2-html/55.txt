taste, and a creative imagination, which instinctively <span style="color: #0000FF;">divine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the<br/>
appropriate forms for its design, can alone excel in this sphere of art.<br/>
This enthusiasm for external beauty and just and harmonious proportions is the essential characteristic of the art of the Renaissance.<br/>
Its veneration for the antique is thus also accounted for. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>an ambitious thirst for fame caused the Italians of the 15th and 16th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">STUDY </span>centuries to look back to classical antiquity as the era of <span style="color: #0000FF;">illusor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">run </span>trious men, and ardently to desire its return. Subsequently,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>however, they regarded it simply as <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>excellent and appropriate resource, when the study of actual life did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffice</span>, and an<br/>
admirable assistance in perfecting their sense of form and symmetry.<br/>
They by no means viewed the art of the ancients as a perfect whole,<br/>
or as the product of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">definite </span>historical epoch, which developed<br/>
itself under peculiar conditions; but their attention was arrested by<br/>
the individual works of antiquity and their special beauties. Thus<br/>
ancient ideas were re-admitted <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>the sphere of Renaissance art.<br/>
A return to the religious spirit of the Romans and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Weeks </span>is not of<br/>
course to be inferred from the veneration for the ancient gods shown<br/>
during the humanistic period; belief in the Olympian gods was extinct; but just because no devotional feeling was intermingled,<br/>
because the forms could only receive life from creative imagination,<br/>
did they exercise so powerful an <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>on the Italian masters.<br/>
The importance of mythological characters being wholly due to the<br/>
perfect beauty of their forms, they could not fail on this account<br/>
pre-eminently to recommend themselves to Renaissance artists<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>These remarks will, it is hoped, convey to the reader a <span style="color: #0000FF;">general<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cmnrcmmidea </span>of the character of the Renaissance. Those who <span style="color: #0000FF;">ex</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">TEO'I'UBE- </span>no new system was invented, as the architects merely <span style="color: #0000FF;">employed </span>the ancient elements, and adhered principally to tradition<br/>
in their constructive principles and selection of component parts.<br/>
Notwithstanding the apparent want of organisation, however, great<br/>
beauty of form, the outcome of the most exuberant imagination,<br/>
will be observed in all these structures.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the diversified stages of development of the succeeding styles of Renaissance architecture, felicity of proportion is<br/>
invariably the aim of all the great masters. To appreciate their<br/>
success in this aim should also be regarded as the principal task of<br/>
the spectator, who with this object in view will do well to compare<br/>
a Gothic with a Renaissance structure. This comparison will prove<br/>
to him that harmony of proportion is not the only <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective </span>element<br/>
in architecture; for, especially in the cathedrals of Germany, the<br/>
exclusively vertical tendency, the attention to form without regard<br/>
to measure, the violation of precepts of rhythm, and a disregard<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportion </span>and the proper ratio of the open to the closed can<span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
