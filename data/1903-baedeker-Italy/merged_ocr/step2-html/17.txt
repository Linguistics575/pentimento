<span>vi PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
HEIGHTS are given in English feet (<span style="color: #ff0000;">LEngl</span>. ft. <span style="color: #ff0000;">= </span>0,3048<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mare</span>), and DISTANCES in English miles (comp. p. ii). The<br/>
POPULATIONS given are those of the communal districts<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>) according to the census of 1901; the populations of<br/>
the separate towns and villages <span style="color: #ff0000;">fyopoldeione </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aggltrmerata</span>),<br/>
which are usually considerably lower than the figures in the<br/>
Handbook, have not yet been published.<br/>
<br/>
HOTELS (comp. p. xix). Besides the modern palatial and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">expensive </span>establishments the Handbook also mentions a <span style="color: #0000FF;">selection </span>of modest, old-fashioned inns, which not unfrequently<br/>
afford good accommodation at moderate charges. The asterisks<br/>
indicate <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>hotels which the Editor has reason to believe<br/>
from his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">experience</span>, as well as from information supplied<br/>
by numerous travellers, to be respectable, clean, reasonable,<br/>
and fairly well provided with the comforts and conveniences<br/>
expected in an up-to-date establishment. Houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>more<br/>
primitive character, when good of their class, are described as<br/>
'fair' or'very fair'. At the same time the Editor does not doubt<br/>
that comfortable quarters may occasionally be obtained at inns<br/>
which he has not recommended or even mentioned. The<br/>
average charges are stated in accordance with the Editor's<br/>
own <span style="color: #0000FF;">experience</span>, or from the bills furnished to him by travellers. Although changes frequently take place, and prices<br/>
generally have an upward tendency, the approximate statement of these items which is thus supplied will at least enable<br/>
the traveller to form an estimate of his probable expenditure.<br/>
<br/>
To <span style="color: #0000FF;">hotel-proprietors</span>, tradesmen, and others the Editor<br/>
begs to intimate that a character for fair dealing and courtesy<br/>
towards travellers forms the sole passport to his commendation, and that advertisements of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">kind </span>are strictly <span style="color: #0000FF;">excluded </span>from his Handbooks. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotel-keepers </span>are also warned<br/>
against persons representing themselves as agents for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Baedeker</span>'s Handbooks<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
