<span>xlvi ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
Italy in particular are worthy of examination. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>early <span style="color: #ff0000;">Renaissance </span>work constructed in this part of the country was <span style="color: #ff0000;">thefacadc<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Certosa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPavia</span>, a superb example of decorative architecture.<br/>
Besides the <span style="color: #0000FF;">marble </span>edifices <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this period we also observe structures<br/>
in brick, in which the vaulting and pillars form prominent features.<br/>
The favourite form was either circular or that of the Greek cross<br/>
(with equal arms), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>being usually crowned with a dome,<br/>
and displaying in its interior an exuberant taste for lavish enrichment. Of this type are the church of the Madonna <span style="color: #0000FF;">delta </span>Croce near<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Crema </span>and several others at Piacenza and Farm (Madonna <span style="color: #0000FF;">dell</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>Steccata). It was in this region that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bnam'rn </span>prosecuted the studies<br/>
of which Rome afterwards reaped the benefit. Among the secular<br/>
buildings of N. Italy we may mention the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ospedale </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Maggie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>at<br/>
Milan, which shows the transition from Gothic to Renaissance. The<br/>
best survey of the palatial <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>built of brick will be obtained<br/>
by walking through the streets of Bologna (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">362</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The visitor to Venice will have an opportunity of tracing within<br/>
a very limited space the progress of Renaissance architecture. The<br/>
church of San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zaccaria </span>is an example of early Renaissance still in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conflict </span>with Gothic, while the richly coloured church of Santa Maria<br/>
dei Miracoli and the Scuola di San Marco exhibit the style in its<br/>
perfection. Foremost among the architects of Venice must be<br/>
mentioned the Lombardi, to whom most of the Venetian buildings<br/>
of the 15th cent. are attributed; but we shall afterwards advert to<br/>
the farther progress of Venetian architecture <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span>xlviii). One of the<br/>
most famous architects of N. Italy was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">01000100 </span>of Verona<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">1435-1515</span>), a monk, a philologist (the discoverer of the letters<br/>
of the younger Pliny), a botanist, an engineer, and a thoroughly<br/>
well trained architect, who at a very advanced age, after the death<br/>
of Bramante, was summoned to Rome to superintend the building<br/>
of St. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peter</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Examples of early Renaissance architecture abound in the towns<br/>
of Tuscany. At Florence, the scene of FILIPPO <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bnmnnnscm's<br/>
</span>labours (1379-1446), the attention is <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>arrested by the church<br/>
of San Lorenzo (1425), with its two <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacristies </span>(the earlier, after<br/>
1421, by Brunelleschi, the later by Michael Angelo, which it is<br/>
interesting to compare), while the small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cappella </span>dci <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pazzi </span>near<br/>
Santa Croce is also noticeable. The Palazzo Rucellai is also important as showing the combination of pilasters <span style="color: #0000FF;">with'rustica</span>','the<br/>
greatest advance achieved by the early Renaissance. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Siam</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
</span>numerous palaces, Pienza, the model of a Renaissance town, and<br/>
Urbino also <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>excellent examples of the art of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Quattroeentists</span>, but are beyond the limits of the present volume. While all<br/>
these <span style="color: #ff0000;">difierent </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">edifices </span>possess many features in common, they may<br/>
be classed in a number of groups, <span style="color: #0000FF;">differing </span>in material and various<br/>
other characteristics, and entirely relieving them from any reproach<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">monotony</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
