the bold airy tower of the palace, rising like <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>slender <span style="color: #0000FF;">meat</span>, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brunelleschi</span>'s wondrous dome of the Cathedral, from the old house of the Spini<br/>

garden of the Franciscan convent to the beautiful environs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cascine<br/>
</span>all <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>full of incom arable grace. Each street of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florence </span>contains a <span style="color: #0000FF;">world<br/>
</span>of art; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>0 the city are the calyx containing the fairest <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>of the human <span style="color: #0000FF;">mind</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>and this is but the richest gem in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">diadem<br/>
</span>with which the Italian people have adorned the earth.' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Loo</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Florence (<span style="color: #0000FF;">18011</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>), Italian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Firenze</span>, formerly <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiorenza</span>, from the<br/>
Latin Florentia, justly entitled'la bella', is situated in 43°46' N.<br/>
latitude, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11°21</span>' E. longitude, on both banks of the Arno, an <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>river except in rainy weather, in a charming valley of<br/>
moderate width, picturesquely enclosed by the spurs of the Apennines, the highest visible peak of which (Monte Moreno, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">528</span>)<br/>
rises to the N. On the S. the heights rise more immediately from<br/>
the river, on the N. they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">3-4 </span>M. distant, while towards the<br/>
N .W., in the direction of Prato and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pistols</span>, the valley expands considerably. The sudden transitions of temperature which frequently<br/>
occur here are trying to person in delicate health. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasantest<br/>
</span>months are April, May, and the first half of June, September,<br/>
October, and November. The winter is disproportionately cold,<br/>
the mean temperature of January being about <span style="color: #0000FF;">40° </span>Fahr.; July<br/>
(mean 78°; maximum in 1897, 103°) and August are very hot, and<br/>
colds are most dangerous at this <span style="color: #0000FF;">season</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The drinking-water of<br/>
<br/>
Florence, mainly filtered water from the Arno, is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered<br/>
</span>very wholesome.<br/>
<br/>
During the struggle for the creation of a'United Italy' Florence<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>short time (1864-71) the capital of the country; but this<br/>
honour, though it gave a momentary stimulus to the progress of the<br/>
city, ultimately (1878) resulted in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>collapse, from which it<br/>
has only now recovered. As early as the 15th cent. Florence <span style="color: #ff0000;">contained<br/>
</span>90,000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhnh.Y </span>in 1881 it had 168,915, and in 1901 the number was<br/>
198, 408. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florentines </span>have ever been noted for the vigour <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>their reasoning powers and for their pre-eminence in artistic talent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">History</span>. According to recent discoveries, there seems to have been<br/>
a settlement on the present site of Florence at a very early date (in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called'Villanova </span>period'). This did not attain any great importance<br/>
until about <span style="color: #0000FF;">BAT</span>. 187, when the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">Via </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cassia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>prolonged to Arezzo<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Florentia</span>, and Bologna. In 3.0. 90 <span style="color: #ff0000;">morentiausnd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Feesulaa </span>(Fiesole) received<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nth </span>municipal <span style="color: #0000FF;">franchise</span>, and a decade later, under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sum</span>, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">came </span>military colonies. The Roman Florence, which lay near the Arno,<br/>
to the N. of the present Ponte Vecchio, possessed <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Capitol, a Temple of<br/>
the Triad (Jupiter, Juno<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ma </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Inner</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thermae </span>for men and women,<br/>
and an Amphitheatre.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Katilda </span>(p. 398) in <span style="color: #0000FF;">ma </span>Florence remained a place of little importance.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Its </span>earliest <span style="color: #0000FF;">chronicler </span>definitely dates the rise of its prosperity from <span style="color: #ff0000;">1126</span>,<br/>
n which year Fiesole was destroyed and its inhabitants transplanted to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Florence</span>. But by the beginning of the following century its success in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">warfare </span>and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span>and rapidly growing manufactures had already<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ransformed </span>it into the most important community in Central Italy. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
