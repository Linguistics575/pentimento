<br/>
(1504) Raphael did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>first abandon the style he had learned <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>Perugia, and which he had carried to greater perfection than any<br/>
of the other Umbrian masters. Many of the pictures he painted<br/>
there show that he still followed the precepts of his first master;<br/>
but he soon yielded to the influence of his Florentine training.<br/>
After the storm raised by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Savonarola </span>had passed over, glorious <span style="color: #0000FF;">days<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>in store for Florence. Leonardo, after his return from Milan,<br/>
and Michael Angelo were engaged here on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartoon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration </span>of the great hall in the Palazzo Vecchio (p. 446); and it<br/>
was their example, and more particularly the stimulating influence<br/>
of Leonardo, that awakened the genius and called forth the highest<br/>
energies of all their younger <span style="color: #ff0000;">contempOraries</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The fame of the Florentine school was at this period <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RAPHAEL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>maintained by Fax <span style="color: #ff0000;">thmnouso </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">C1175-i5i7</span>) and ANDREA<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FLORENTINE </span>DEL <span style="color: #0000FF;">SARTO </span>(1487-1531). The only works of Bartolomeo<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">CONTEMPOB- </span>which we know are somewhat spiritless <span style="color: #0000FF;">altar-pieces</span>, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">they<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">133</span>' exhibit in a high degree the dignity of character, the tranquillity of expression, and the architectural symmetry of grouping<br/>
in which he excelled. His finest pictures are the Christ with the four<br/>
Saints, the Descent from the Cross (or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pieta</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Mark in the Pitti<br/>
Gallery, and the Madonna in the cathedral at Lucca. The traveller<br/>
would not do justice to Andrea del Sarto, a master of rich colouring,<br/>
were he to confine his attention to that artist's works in the two<br/>
great Florentine galleries. Sarto's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Freeway </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Annunziata<br/>
</span>(p. 483) and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scalzo </span>(History of John the Baptist, p. 497) are<br/>
among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>creations of the cinquecento. Such, too, was the<br/>
stimulus given to the artists of this period by their great contemporaries at Florence that even those of subordinate merit have <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>produced works of the highest excellence, as, for instance,<br/>
the Salutation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ALBERTINELLI </span>and the Zenobius pictures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">RIDOLFO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">GHIBLANDAJO </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uffizi</span>. The last masters of the local<br/>
Florentine school were <span style="color: #0000FF;">PONTORMO </span>and ANGELO <span style="color: #ff0000;">BBONZINO</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Raphael's style was more particularly influenced by his relations<br/>
to Fra Bartolomeo, and the traveller will find it most interesting<br/>
to compare their works and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">determine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>extent each derived<br/>
suggestions from the other. The best authenticated works in<br/>
Italy of Raphael's Florentine period are the Madonna <span style="color: #ff0000;">del </span>Granduca<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ping</span>, the Madonna del <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cardellino </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Uffizi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Entombment </span>(Gal.<br/>
Borghese in Rome), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Puddle </span>in the Vatican, the portraits of<br/>
Angelo and Maddalena <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dom</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>(Pitti), and the Portrait of Himself<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Uffizi</span>; p. 458). The Portrait of a Lady in the Pitti gallery is of<br/>
doubtful origin, and the Madonna del Baldacchino in the same gallery was only begun by Raphael.<br/>
<br/>
When Raphael went to Rome in 1508 he found a large circle<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rama</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>of notable artists already congregated there. Some of <span style="color: #0000FF;">these<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Roam </span>were deprived <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their employment by his arrival, including<br/>
