<br/>
half of it, while the humidity rapidly increases as we approach<br/>
the Riviera di Levante. The same holds good of the rainfall.<br/>
While San Remo has <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>rainy days between November and April,<br/>
Newt <span style="color: #0000FF;">Us </span>54, and Pisa 67. The average number of rainy days<br/>
during the three winter months in the Riviera is 16. Snow is<br/>
rarely seen; it falls perhaps once or twice in the course of the<br/>
winter, but generally lies only for a few hours, while many years<br/>
pass without the appearance of a single <span style="color: #0000FF;">snow-flake</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fog</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>are very<br/>
rare on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ligurian </span>coast; but a heavy dew-fall in the evening is<br/>
the rule. In comparison with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oisalpine </span>districts, the Riviera<br/>
enjoys a very high proportion of bright, sunny weather.<br/>
<br/>
The above considerations will show that it is often necessary to<br/>
discount the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpropitious </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">opinions </span>of those who happen to have<br/>
visited the Riviera under peculiarly <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>climatic conditions. Not only do the ordinary four seasons differ from each other<br/>
on the Riviera, but the different parts of winter are also sharply<br/>
discriminated. A short rainy season may be counted on with almost<br/>
complete certainty between the beginning of October and the middle<br/>
of November, which restricts, but by no means abolishes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Open-air<br/>
</span>exercise. Then follows from December to February usually an uninterrupted series of warm and sunshiny days, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>invalids have<br/>
sometimes to be on their guard against wind. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Much </span>here, as elsewhere in the south, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">windiest </span>month of all, but is much less<br/>
boisterous in the Italian part of the Riviera than in Provence.<br/>
April and May are delightful months for those who require out-door<br/>
life in a warm climate.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">wildness </span>of the climate of the Riviera requires, perhaps, no<br/>
better proof than its rich southern vegetation. The Olive, which is<br/>
already found in the neighbourhood of the N. Italian <span style="color: #0000FF;">liken</span>, here<br/>
attains its full growth, while the Eucalyptus globulus (which grows<br/>
rapidly and to an astonishing height), the Orange, the Lemon, and<br/>
several varieties of Palms also flourish.<br/>
<br/>
The geological character of the Riviera is also of sanitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance</span>. The prevailing formation is limestone, which absorbs the<br/>
. sun's rays with remarkable rapidity and radiates it with equal speed,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">thus </span>forming an important factor in making the most of the winter<br/>
sunshine. On account of its softness it is also extensively used<br/>
for road-making, and causes the notorious dust of the Riviera, which<br/>
forms the chief objection to a region frequented by so many <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">walk </span>lungs. The authorities of the various <span style="color: #0000FF;">health-resorts</span>,<br/>
however, take great pains to mitigate this evil <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>far as practicable.<br/>
After heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">min </span>the roads are apt to be very muddy.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>advantages that a winter-residence in the Riviera, in contradistinction to the climate of northern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe</span>, offers to <span style="color: #0000FF;">inValids </span>and<br/>
delicate <span style="color: #0000FF;">persona</span>, are a considerably warmer and generally dry atmosphere, seldom disturbed by storms, yet fresh and pure, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">more<br/>
