<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Xxxviii </span>ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
1y only, lies in the past; to conjure up this, and bring about<br/>
a Renaissance of the antique, <span style="color: #0000FF;">appeal </span>to be the goal of their<br/>
aspirations. They apply themselves to their task with calmness<br/>
and concentration, they indulge in no bold or novel schemes, but<br/>
are content to display their love of form in the execution of details.<br/>
What architecture as a whole loses in historical attraction is<br/>
compensated by the beauty of the individual <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>. While<br/>
the North possesses structures of greater importance in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>of art, Italy boasts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>far greater number of pleasing works.<br/>
There is hardly a district in Italy which does not boast <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>interesting examples of Romanesque architecture. At Verona we<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ROMAN- </span>may mention the famous church of St. Zeno, with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">sculpnsqun </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tured </span>portals. In the same style are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cathedral</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Far-Gamma</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rara</span>, Modena. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Puma</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Piacenza</span>, the church of Sant' Ambrogio at Milan, with its characteristic <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-court </span>and facade, and<br/>
that of San Michele <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Pavia. Tuscany abounds with Romanesque<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>. Among these the palm is due to the cathedral of Pisa, a<br/>
church of <span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious </span>dimensions in the interior, superbly embellished<br/>
with its marble of two colours and the rows of columns on its facade.<br/>
To the same period also belong the neighbouring Leaning Tower and<br/>
the Baptistery. The churches of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lucea </span>are copies of those <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Plea</span>.<br/>
Those of Florence, however, such as the octagonal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dome-covered<br/>
</span>Baptistery and the above-mentioned church of <span style="color: #ff0000;">San </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Miniato</span>, exhibit<br/>
an independent style.<br/>
<br/>
The position occupied by Italy with regard to Gothic <span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture </span>is thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">rendered </span>obvious. She could not entirely<br/>
ignore its <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>, although incapable of according <span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unconditional </span>reception to this, the highest development <span style="color: #0000FF;">01<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vault-architecture</span>. Gothic was introduced into Italy in a mature<br/>
and perfected condition. It did not of necessity, as in France,<br/>
develop itself from the earlier (Romanesque) style, its progress<br/>
cannot be traced step by step; it was imported by foreign architects<br/>
and adopted as being in <span style="color: #0000FF;">consonance </span>with the tendency of the age;<br/>
it found numerous admirers among the mendicant orders of monks<br/>
and the humbler classes of citizens, but could never quite disengage itself from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Italianising </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">influences</span>. It was so far transformed<br/>
that the constructive constituents of Gothic are degraded to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">decorative </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>, and the national taste thus became reconciled to it<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The cathedral of Milan cannot be regarded as a fair specimen <span style="color: #0000FF;">01<br/>
</span>Italian Gothic, but this style must rather be sought for in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>cathedrals of Florence, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Him</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orvieto</span>, in the church <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>San Petronio at Bologna, and in numerous secular <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>, such<br/>
as the Loggia dei <span style="color: #0000FF;">Land </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>Florence, the communal palaces <span style="color: #ff0000;">01<br/>
</span>towns in Central Italy, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">palace</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of Venice. An acquaintance<br/>
with true Gothic construction, so contracted notwithstanding all its<br/>
apparent richness, so exclusively adapted to practical requirements,<br/>
can certainly not be acquired from these cathedrals. The spacious<br/>
