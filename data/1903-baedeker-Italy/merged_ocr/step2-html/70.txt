1649), whose frescoes in the Farnesina (unfortunately not now<br/>
accessible) vie with Raphael's works in tenderness and grace. A<br/>
still more numerous circle of pupils, however, soon assembled around<br/>
Raphael himself, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">GIULIO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ROMANO</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mu</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tatu</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ANnm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DA </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Susana</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">POLIDOBO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">na </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Camvaooro</span>, Tmo'rno <span style="color: #0000FF;">VITI </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">VITB</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Guam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">FRANO</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Grovsmu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Unmet<br/>
</span>Attended by this distinguished retinue, Raphael enjoyed all the<br/>
honours of a prince, although, in the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>world, Bramante<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span>xlvii) and Michael Angelo occupied an equally high rank. The<br/>
latter did not, however, trench on Raphael's province as a painter<br/>
so much as was formerly supposed, and the jealousy of each other<br/>
which they are said to have entertained was probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confined<br/>
</span>to their respective followers. Raphael had doubtless examined the<br/>
ceiling of the Sistine with the utmost care, and was indebted to<br/>
Michael Angelo for much instruction; but it is very important to<br/>
note that he neither followed in the footsteps, nor suffered his native<br/>
genius to be biassed in the slightest degree by the example of his<br/>
great rival<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>signal proof of this independence is <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>by the<br/>
Sibyls which he painted in the church of Santa Maria della Pace in<br/>
1514, and which, though conceived in a very <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>spirit from<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imposing </span>figures in the Sistine, are not the less admirable. In<br/>
order duly to appreciate the works produced by Raphael during his<br/>
Roman period, the traveller should <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>direct his attention to<br/>
the master's frescoes. The Stanza in the Vatican, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tapestry</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggc</span>, the finest work of decorative art in existence, the Dome<br/>
Mosaics in Santa Maria <span style="color: #0000FF;">dei </span>Popolo (Capp. Chigi), and' the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Galatea<br/>
</span>and Myth of Psyche in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farnesina </span>together constitute the treasure<br/>
bequeathed to Rome by the genius of the prince of painters. (Farther particulars as to these works will be found in the second volume<br/>
of this Handbook.<span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>Many, and some of the best, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Raphael</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">easel-pictures </span>of his<br/>
Roman period are now beyond the Alps. Italy, however, still possesses the Madonna delta Sedia, the most mundane, but most<br/>
charming of his Madonnas (Pitti), the Madonna dell' <span style="color: #ff0000;">Impannata<br/>
</span>(Pitti), the Madonna col <span style="color: #0000FF;">Divine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amore </span>(Naples), the Madonna di<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatigue </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>(in the Vatican), St. Cecilia (Bologna), and the Young St. John (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Uffizi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The finest of his portraits<br/>
are those of Pope Julius II. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Uffizi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and Leo <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>with two Cardinals<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Witti</span>). Besides these works we must also mention the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Famina </span>(in the Pal. Barberini at Rome), and the Portrait of a<br/>
Lady (Pitti, No. 245), which may represent the same original and<br/>
also recalls the Sistine <span style="color: #0000FF;">Madam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
After Raphael's death the progress of art did not merely come<br/>
to a standstill, but a period of rapid DECLINE set in. The conquest<br/>
and plundering of Rome in 1527 entirely paralysed all artistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">effort<br/>
</span>for a time. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>this misfortune proved a boon to other parts of<br/>
Italy. Raphael's pupils migrated from Rome to various <span style="color: #0000FF;">provincial<br/>
