<span>276 Route 42<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>VENICE. a. Piazza <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">St. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mark</span>:<br/>
<br/>
'The Library of St. Mark remains the crowning triumph of Venetian<br/>
art. It is impossible to contemplate its noble double row of open arches<br/>
without echoing the judgment of Palladio, that nothing more sumptuous<br/>
or beautiful had been invented since the age of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rome </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>A. <span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span>).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the Lagune, between the Library and the Royal Garden<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>is<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">old</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>(P1. H, 6; <span style="color: #0000FF;">hence'zecchino</span>' or'sequin') or Mint, also<br/>
built by Sansovino in 1536. The interior has just been altered to<br/>
accommodate the library of St. Mark (p. 281). Beautiful court.<br/>
<br/>
The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Palace </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dozen </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Palazzo </span>Ducale; Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">H</span>, 5), the W.<br/>
side of which (82 yds.) faces the Piazzetta, and the S. side (78 yds.)<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mole </span>and the Lagune, is said to have been founded beside the<br/>
church of St. Theodore about 814 for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>Doge of Venice. It<br/>
was rebuilt after <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflagrations </span>in 976 and 1105, and has been<br/>
repeatedly altered and restored. The Gothic exterior, lined with<br/>
small slabs of coloured marble, and with two pointed arcades of 107<br/>
columns (36 below, 71 above), one above the other, was thoroughly<br/>
restored in 1873-89. The S. part dates from the 14th cent. (1309<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>et seq.; large window, 1404), while the W. facade is said to <span style="color: #ff0000;">have<br/>
<br/>
</span>been built in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1424- </span>38 by Giovanni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bum </span>and his sons <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pantaleom<br/>
</span>and Bartolomeo Buon the Elder. The magnificent tracery of the<br/>
windows <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the upper story has almost entirely disappeared in the<br/>
course of one of the restorations.<br/>
<br/>
The upper arcade, called'La <span style="color: #0000FF;">Loggia</span>', is remarkably rich. From<br/>
between the two columns of red marble (9th and 10th from the<br/>
principal portal) the Republic caused its <span style="color: #0000FF;">sentence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of death to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>proclaimed. The capitals of the short columns below (which <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>no bases) are richly decorated with foliage, figures of men, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>animals. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner-pillar </span>next the portal are interesting figures<br/>
of Numa Pompilius, Scipio, Emperor Trajan judging the cause of<br/>
a widow, Justice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, all with inscriptions. The group above these<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Judgment </span>of Solomon by two unknown Florentines. At the<br/>
corner towards the Lagune, Adam and Eve. Mr. Ruskin, who gives<br/>
an elaborate description of these sculptures in his'Stones of Venice',<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affirms </span>that the capital under this group,'in the workmanship and<br/>
grouping of its foliage', is, on the whole, the finest he knows in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe</span>. At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8.133. </span>angle, the sin of Noah. All these are Gothic.<br/>
In the centre of the Piazzetta facade is an alto-relief of the Lion<br/>
of St. Mark with a kneeling figure of Doge Andrea Gritti (1523-38),<br/>
which was destroyed by the Radicals in 1797 and restored by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Crbano </span>Bottasso in 1897. Adjacent is a Venetia enthroned.<br/>
<br/>
The transition from <span style="color: #0000FF;">late</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gothic </span>to Renaissance forms is illustrated by the fine portal adjoining St. Mark's, built in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1438-43<br/>
</span>by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gino</span>. and Bart. Buon the Elder. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">called'Porla </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">delta </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Carin<br/>
</span>from the placards which announced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decrees </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Republic<br/>
here. The figure of Temperance, below to the left, the charming<br/>
Putti, climbing among the Gothic foliage of the tympanum, and the<br/>
figure of Justice, above, are especially attractive. The relief of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
