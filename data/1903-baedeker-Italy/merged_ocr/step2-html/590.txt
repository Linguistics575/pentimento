<br/>
Pisa, a quiet town with 60,255 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, the capital of a province,<br/>
the see of an archbishop, and the seat of a university, is situated<br/>
on both banks of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arm</span>, 6 M. from the sea and about 4 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>from<br/>
the base of the Monti <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pisani </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">415</span>). Its climate <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">moist </span>and<br/>
fairly mild, but the town has always had the reputation of being<br/>
rainy. Good drinking-water is brought from the neighbourhood of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Asciano </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">415</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Pisa was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pine </span>of the ancients, and once lay at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confluence </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arms </span>and Amer (Serchio), which last has now an estuary of its own.<br/>
It became a Roman colony in B.C. 180. Augustus gave it the name of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cumin </span>Julia Pisana and Hadrian <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Antoninus Pius erected temples,<br/>
theatres, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphal </span>arches here. At that period the town must have<br/>
been a place of considerable importance, but all its ancient monuments,<br/>
have disappeared with the exception of a few scanty relics of some<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>('Bagni <span style="color: #0000FF;">di </span>Nerone') near the Porta Lucca (Pl. D, 1; tablet). At<br/>
the beginning of the 11th cent. Pisa attained the rank of one of the<br/>
greatest commercial and seafaring towns on the Mediterranean, and became<br/>
a rival of Venice and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Genus</span>. It was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>indebted for its power to the<br/>
seal with which <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>took the lead in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Infidels</span>. In<br/>
1025 the Pisans expelled the Saracens from Sardinia and took permanent<br/>
possession of the island. In 1030 and 1089 they again defeated the Saracens<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Tunis, and in 1063 destroyed their fleet near Palermo. In 1114 they<br/>
conquered the Balearic Islands, and soon afterwards took <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>prominent<br/>
part in the Crusades. In the 12th and 13th centuries their power had<br/>
reached its zenith; their trade extended over the entire Mediterranean,<br/>
and their supremacy embraced the Italian islands and the whole of the<br/>
coast from La Spezia to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Civith </span>Vecchia. In the intestine <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>of the<br/>
peninsula Pisa was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mo </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>powerful adherent of the Ghibellines, and<br/>
therefore sustained <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">save </span>e shock through the downfall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hohenstaufen</span>. The protracted <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>the citizens carried on with Genoa led<br/>
to their disastrous defeat at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meloria </span>near Leghorn on 6th Aug., 1284 (p. 76),<br/>
and the peace concluded in 1300 compelled them to evacuate Corsica and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">atber </span>possessions. In 1320 the pope invested the kings of Aragon with<br/>
Sardinia, and Pisa was thus deprived of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">island </span>also. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sity </span>was farther weakened by internal dissensions, and fell a victim to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unhition </span>of the condottieri. In 1405 it was sold to Florence, but on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">m-ivni </span>of Charles VIII. it <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to shake <span style="color: #ff0000;">03</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>the yoke of its arrogant<br/>
neighbour. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1509</span>, however, it was besieged and again occupied by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">florentines</span>, to whom it thenceforth continued subject.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">sfluence </span>of its numerous and handsome ancient monuments, <span style="color: #0000FF;">u </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mama<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">arminated </span>with the erection of the charming church of Santa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maria </span>della<br/>
pina (1230), that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Santa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Caterina </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1253</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the Campo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Saute </span>(1278).

<span style="color: #ff0000;">chitect</span>. was no less famous than his father, whose antique <span style="color: #0000FF;">style </span>however,<br/>
did not follow. Keen observation of nature and a highly picturesque<br/>
