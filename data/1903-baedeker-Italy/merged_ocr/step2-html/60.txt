compete with that of antiquity. Yet the plastic art, far from<br/>
enjoying a lower degree of favour, was rather viewed by the artists of that age as the proper centre of their sphere of activity.<br/>
Sculpture was the first art in Italy which was launched into the<br/>
stream of the Renaissance, in its development it was ever a step<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">advance </span>of the other arts, and in the popular opinion possessed<br/>
the advantage of most clearly embodying the current ideas of the<br/>
age, and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">afi'ording </span>the most brilliant evidence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ire-awakened<br/>
</span>love of art. Owing probably to the closeness of the connection between the plastic art of the Renaissance and the peculiar national<br/>
culture, the former lost much of its value after the decline of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">latter</span>, and was less appreciated than pictorial and architectural<br/>
works, in which adventitious historical origin is obviously less important than general <span style="color: #0000FF;">efi'ect</span>. In tracing the progress of the sculpture<br/>
of the Renaissance, the enquirer at once encounters serious <span style="color: #0000FF;">deviations </span>from strict precepts, and numerous infringements of aesthetic<br/>
rules. The execution of reliefs constitutes by far the widest sphere<br/>
of action of the Italian sculptors of the 15th century. These,<br/>
however, contrary to immemorial usage, are executed in a pictorial<br/>
style. <span style="color: #ff0000;">LonBNzo </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">GHIBBBTI </span>(1378-1455), for example, in his celebrated (eastern) door of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baptistery </span>of Florence, is not satisfied with grouping the figures as in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">painting</span>, and placing them<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>rich landscape copied from <span style="color: #0000FF;">nature </span>He treats the background<br/>
in accordance with the rules of perspective; the figures at a distance are smaller and less raised than those in the foreground.<br/>
He oversteps the limits of the plastic art, and above all violates<br/>
the laws of the relief-style, according to which the figures are<br/>
always represented in an imaginary space, and the usual system<br/>
of a mere design in profile seldom departed from. In like manner<br/>
the painted reliefs in terracotta by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Luca </span>DELLA <span style="color: #ff0000;">ROBBIA </span>(1399-1482)<br/>
are somewhat inconsistent with purity of plastic form. But if<br/>
it be <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>in mind that the sculptors of the Renaissance did not<br/>
derive their ideas from a previously defined system, or adhere to<br/>
abstract rules, the fresh and lifelike vigour of their works (especially those of the 15th century) will not be disputed, and prejudice will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>dispelled by the great attractions of the reliefs<br/>
themselves. The sculpture of the Renaissance adheres as strictly<br/>
as the other arts to the fundamental principle of representation;<br/>
scrupulous care is bestowed on the faithful and attractive <span style="color: #0000FF;">rendering </span>of the individual objects; the taste is gratified by expressive heads, graceful female figures, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">joyous </span>children; the sculptors have a keen appreciation of the beauty of the nude, and<br/>
the importance of a calm and dignified flow of drapery. In their<br/>
anxiety for fidelity of representation, however, they do not shrink<br/>
from harshness of expression or rigidity of form. Their predilection for bronze-casting, <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>art which was less in vogue in the<br/>
16th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, accords with their love of <span style="color: #ff0000;">individualising </span>their <span style="color: #ff0000;">charactBunnm</span>. Italy <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. 12th Edit. <span style="color: #0000FF;">d<br/>
