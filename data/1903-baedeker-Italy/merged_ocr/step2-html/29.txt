<span>1 viii STEAMERS.<br/>
<br/>
general season tickets are issued only at some of the principal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stations </span>(such as Florence, Milan, Turin, Bologna, Genoa, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pine</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Leghorn), but a form of application may be obtained at any station.<br/>
The applicant must pay 1 fr. when ordering the ticket and at the<br/>
same time furnish an unmounted photograph of himself. The ticket<br/>
is issued at the chief stations 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">hm</span>, at the smaller stations about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">24 </span>hrs. after the application.<br/>
<br/>
LUGGAGE. No luggage is allowed free, except small articles<br/>
taken by the passenger into his carriage; the rate of charge is 41/2 0.<br/>
for 100 kilogrammes per kilometre. Travellers who can <span style="color: #0000FF;">confine </span>their<br/>
impediments to articles which they can carry themselves and take into<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>with them will be spared much expense and annoyance.<br/>
Those who intend to make only a short <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>at a place, especially<br/>
when the town or village lies at some distance from the railway,<br/>
had better leave their heavier luggage at the station till their return<br/>
(dare in <span style="color: #0000FF;">deposito</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">depositors</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">be</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>per day for each piece, minimum 10 c.) or forward it to the final destination. At small stations<br/>
the traveller should at once look after his luggage in <span style="color: #0000FF;">person</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">luggage-ticket </span>is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scontrino</span>. Porters (<span style="color: #ff0000;">fucchlni</span>) who convey<br/>
luggage to and from the carriage are entitled to 5-20 <span style="color: #0000FF;">c. </span>per package<br/>
by tariff; and attempts at extortion should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmly </span>resisted.<br/>
<br/>
As several robberies of passengers' luggage have been perpetrated in<br/>
Italy without detection, it is as well that articles of great value should<br/>
not be entrusted to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">safe-keeping </span>of any trunk or <span style="color: #0000FF;">portmanteau</span>, however<br/>
strong and secure it may seem (comp. p. xiv<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span>Damaged trunks may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>secured by leaden seals (<span style="color: #0000FF;">pr'ambare</span>) for 5 <span style="color: #ff0000;">0. </span>each package.<br/>
<br/>
The enormous weight of the large trunks used by some travellers not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">infrequently </span>causes serious injury to the porters who have to handle them.<br/>
Heavy articles should therefore always be <span style="color: #0000FF;">plead </span>in the smaller packages.<br/>
<br/>
Italian <span style="color: #0000FF;">RAILWAY </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">annwnauvra</span>, especially those at <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontier-stations</span>,<br/>
leave much to be desired. Luncheon-baskets <span style="color: #0000FF;">ora </span>fr.) may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>obtained<br/>
at some of the larger stations.<br/>
<br/>
Passengers by <span style="color: #0000FF;">night-trains </span>from the larger stations may hire pillows<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">guano-tale</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fr.</span>, for abroad 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">In</span>). These must not be removed<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">compartment</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Steamers. The time-tables of the steamer-rout <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>are given in<br/>
the larger railway-guide mentioned at p. xvi; but changes are so<br/>
frequent that enquiries on the spot are always advisable.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the ITALIAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lens </span>the tickets are usually issued on board<br/>
the steamer. Passengers embarking at intermediate stations receive<br/>
checks which they show on purchasing their tickets. There is no<br/>
extra charge for embarking or disembarking at small-boat stations.<br/>
The railways issue tickets including the lake-journey. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Return-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tickets </span>do not usually permit of the journey being broken. On<br/>
Sundays in summer the boats are frequently crowded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">excursionists </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>The steamers occasionally leave the smaller stations as<br/>
much as 10 min. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">advance </span>of the scheduled times, but they are<br/>
much more frequently late.<br/>
<br/>
In the proper season a steamer trip on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iedlterranean</span>, especially<br/>
<br/>
between Genoa, Spezia, and Leghorn, or on the Adriatic, between Venice<br/>
and Trieste, is a very charming experience. Tickets should be taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
