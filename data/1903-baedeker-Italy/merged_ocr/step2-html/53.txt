<span>xlii ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
The word <span style="color: #0000FF;">Renaissance </span>is commonly understood to <span style="color: #0000FF;">denigrate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>revival of the antique; but while ancient art now <span style="color: #0000FF;">begun </span>to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sanon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>artistic taste more powerfully, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>study to be<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">CULTUH- </span>more zealously prosecuted, the essential <span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span>of the<br/>
Renaissance consists by no means exclusively, or even principally,<br/>
in the imitation of the antique; nor must the term be <span style="color: #0000FF;">confined<br/>
</span>merely to art, as it truly embraces the whole progress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilisation </span>in Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries. How the<br/>
Renaissance manifested itself in political life, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diiterent<br/>
</span>phases it assumes in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>and the social world, cannot<br/>
here be discussed. It may, however, be observed that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">naissance </span>in social life was chiefly promoted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'humanists</span>',<br/>
who preferred general culture to great professional attainments,<br/>
who enthusiastically regarded classical antiquity as the golden<br/>
age of great men, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>who exercised the most extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the bias of artistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">down</span>. In the period of the Renaissance the position of the artist with <span style="color: #0000FF;">regard </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>work, and<br/>
the nature and aspect of the latter are changed. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">education </span>and<br/>
taste of the individual leave a more marked impress on the work of<br/>
the author than was ever before the case; his creations are <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro-eminently </span>the reflection of his intellect; his alone is the responsibility,<br/>
his the reward of success or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mortification </span>of failure. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Artiste<br/>
</span>now seek to attain celebrity, they desire their works to be examined<br/>
and judged as testimonials of their personal endowments. Mere<br/>
technical skill by no means <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfies </span>them, although they are far<br/>
from despising the drudgery of a handicraft (many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>eminent <span style="color: #ff0000;">quattrocentists </span>having received the rudiments of their education<br/>
in the workshop of a goldsmith); the exclusive pursuit of a single<br/>
sphere of art is regarded by them as <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>indication of <span style="color: #0000FF;">intellectual<br/>
</span>poverty, although they aim at mastering the technique of every<br/>
branch. They work simultaneously as painters and sculptors, and<br/>
when they devote themselves to architecture, it is deemed nothing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unwanted </span>or anomalous. A comprehensive and versatile education,<br/>
united with refined personal sentiments, forms their <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftiest </span>aim. This<br/>
they attain in but few instances, but that they eagerly aspired to it<br/>
is proved by the biography of the illustrious <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Berna</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aunx-n<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fiMH-72</span>), who is entitled to the same rank in the 15th <span style="color: #0000FF;">century </span>as<br/>
Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th. Rationally educated, physically and<br/>
morally healthy, keenly alive to the calm enjoyments of life, and<br/>
possessing clearly defined ideas and decided tastes, the Renaissance<br/>
artists necessarily regarded nature and her artistic embodiment<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>views from their predecessors. A fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>joyous love<br/>
of nature seems to pervade the whole of this period. She not only<br/>
afforded an unbounded field to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific</span>, but artists also strove<br/>
to approach her <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>first by a careful study of her various <span style="color: #0000FF;">phenomena</span>. Anatomy, geometry, perspective, and the study of drapery<br/>
and colour are zealously pursued and practically applied. <span style="color: #ff0000;">External<br/>
