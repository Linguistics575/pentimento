<span>24 PIEDMONT.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hieronv </span>of the country is closely interwoven with that of its<br/>
dynasty. The House of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Envoy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Car </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cam </span>Sabauda), a family of German<br/>
origin, professing even to trace their descent from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>Duke<br/>
Wittekind, the opponent of Charlemagne, <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>became conspicuous among<br/>
the nobles of Upper Burgundy about the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">1000</span>. Humbert <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t'Biancamano</span>'; <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10533 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>generally regarded as the founder of the dynasty.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>descendants, by judiciously <span style="color: #ff0000;">espousing </span>the cause of the pope and the<br/>
emperor alternately, gradually succeeded in extending their supremacy<br/>
over Turin, Aosta, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lvren</span>, and Nice. Amadeus <span style="color: #0000FF;">TU</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span>), known<br/>
as the'Conte Verde' ('green <span style="color: #0000FF;">count</span>') from his usual dress extended the<br/>
power of his house in numerous feuds and warred in the East. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amadeus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1711.</span>, raised to the ducal dignity by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Emp</span>. Sigismund in <span style="color: #0000FF;">me</span>, added<br/>
Geneva, Vercelli, and Piedmont to his possessions, and gave the principality its first legislative code. He retired to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hermitage </span>at Ripaille, near<br/>
Thonon, in 1434, but was <span style="color: #0000FF;">armed </span>pope <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>Felix <span style="color: #0000FF;">F. </span>(1439-49) by the Council<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Basle </span>and died in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1151</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Situated between the two great <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval<br/>
</span>powers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mute </span>on one side, and Austria and Spain on the other, the<br/>
princes of Savoy frequently changed sides, and although sometimes <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtaken </span>by terrible disasters, they contrived to maintain, and even to extend,<br/>
their territory. At one period the greater part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bach </span>was annexed<br/>
to France, but Emmanuel Philibert ('Testa di <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ferro</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">1553- </span>restored it<br/>
to its original extent, and became its second founder. This rince spent<br/>
25 years as a general in the service of Charles <span style="color: #ff0000;">V. </span>and won t e battle of<br/>
St. Quentin for Philip <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. Under his son Charles Emmanuel I. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1580-1630</span>)<br/>
the Duchy again became dependent on <span style="color: #ff0000;">France</span>. From the sons of <span style="color: #0000FF;">this<br/>
</span>prince <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>descended the elder branch of the family, which became extinct<br/>
n 1831, and the younger <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carignano </span>line, which succeeded to the throne<br/>
in the person of Carlo Alberto. The following dukes were Vittorio Amedeo <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">1630- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>, Francesco <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giacinto </span>(1637-38), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Carla </span>Emanuele 11. (1638-75), and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l'illo-rio-Amedeo </span>II. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1675-1730</span>). The last of these, having boldly allied himself with Austria during the S <span style="color: #0000FF;">artists </span>War of Succession, managed to throw<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the French suzerainty (<span style="color: #0000FF;">170 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>; he obtained Sicily as his reward, which<br/>
island, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, he was afterwards obliged to exchange for Sardinia (1720),<br/>
and in 1713 assumed the title of KING, which was subsequently coupled<br/>
with the name of the latter island. His successors were Carlo Emanuele 111.<br/>
(1730-73), and Vittorio Amedeo 111. (1773-96). After the battle of Turin<br/>
(1706), in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Prince </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Eugene </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">commanded </span>the Imperialists, the Piedmontese princes directed their attention to Prussia, which served <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>a model<br/>
for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Organisation </span>of their kingdom. In both countries the military<br/>
and feudal <span style="color: #0000FF;">element </span>preponderated, and both were obliged to succumb<br/>
to the new powers evolved by the French Revolution. Carlo Emanuele <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">V.<br/>
</span>(1796-1802) was deprived of all his continental <span style="color: #0000FF;">possession</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>by the French<br/>
in 1798, and restricted to the island of Sardinia, which was protected<br/>
by the English fleet. Vittorio Emanuele <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>(1802-21) was at length reinstated in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">dominion</span>, with the addition of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, by the Congress of<br/>
Vienna. The Napoleonic period had swept away the feudal institutions<br/>
of Piedmont, and had bequeathed in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">stead </span>many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span>of<br/>
modern legislation, and high military renown. It is therefore <span style="color: #0000FF;">intelligible<br/>
</span>that the clerical reaction, which set in with the king's return, gave rise<br/>
to an insurrection which <span style="color: #0000FF;">canned </span>the king to <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicate</span>, and had to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">queued </span>by Austrian troops. His brother Carlo Felice (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1821-31</span>) adhered<br/>
faithfully to Jesuitical principles, and lived on the whole in accordance<br/>
with his motto,'Non sono re per essere <span style="color: #ff0000;">seccato</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">'worried</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The older<br/>
line of the House of Savoy became extinct with <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>rince, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>succeeded by the collateral line of Carignano (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">40</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>th April, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1831</span>).<br/>
Carlo Alberto (b. 1798) who had been educated at a French military<br/>
school, and had <span style="color: #0000FF;">headed </span>the insurrection of 1821, was protected by France<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russia </span>against the attempts of Austria to deprive him of his claims<br/>
to the throne. His own experiences, and the force of circumstances,<br/>
rendered him an implacable enemy of Austria. With him began the<br/>
national <span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>of Piedmont, although his <span style="color: #0000FF;">efl'orts </span>were not always<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">consistent</span>. The liberals called him the'Re <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tentenna</span>' (the vacillating),<br/>
while in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1843 </span>he himself described his position as being'between <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
