<span>440 <span style="color: #0000FF;">game </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>FLORENCE. History.<br/>
<br/>
government of the town was carried on <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the nobles (Grandi) through<br/>
four (afterwards six) consuls, assisted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bumutm</span>.<br/>
From 1207 onwards the judicial functions were entrusted to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pedals</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>foreign nobleman of legal erudition elected for a period of six months,<br/>
afterwards increased to a year. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florentines </span>maintained their pristine<br/>
simplicity and virtue longer than was usual in Italian cities. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span>,<br/>
however, lived in bitter <span style="color: #0000FF;">tends </span>with each other, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>after the assassination<br/>
of Buondelmonte on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pants </span>Vecchio in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1215 </span>were divided between the<br/>
two hostile camps of the Guelphs and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ghibellines</span>. Under the Emperor<br/>
Frederick <span style="color: #0000FF;">u. </span>the Ghibellines enjoyed <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brief period of <span style="color: #0000FF;">supremacy</span>, but on<br/>
his death in 1250 the Guelphs secured the upper hand. As in consequence<br/>
of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflicts </span>the sway of the nobility proved detrimental to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">interests </span>of the city, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>in 1250 organised a kind of national guard<br/>
of their own, commanded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'Capitano </span>del Popolo', who was assisted by<br/>
a council of 12'Ancients' <span style="color: #ff0000;">CAnm'anr</span>) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">36'Corporals</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Caporali</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. About<br/>
the same time (1252) was first coined the golden Florin, which soon became a<br/>
general standard of value, <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">merit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the leading position taken by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florence<br/>
</span>in the commerce of Europe. The guilds of the wool-weavers and clothmakers maintained agents in Venice, Paris, Bruges, and London; Florentine bankers had a hand in the commerce of every nation, and, more<br/>
especially, exercised almost exclusive control over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">money-marketof<br/>
</span>France. The continuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">tenth </span>of the nobles brought the republic into<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">collisiOn </span>with other Tuscan towns, of which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siena </span>and Pisa were conspicuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">partisans </span>of the Ghibellines. In 1260 the Florentines <span style="color: #ff0000;">tsuffered </span>I<br/>
crushing defeat on the Arbia, near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Montaperti</span>, which cost the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Guelph<br/>
</span>their supremacy in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city </span>The Ghibelline <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandees </span>proposed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">me<br/>
</span>Florence to the ground and to transfer the seat of government to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Empoli'<br/>
</span>but the plan <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>successfully opposed by the noble Farinata degli Uberti.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the death of Manfred of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hohenstaufen </span>at the battle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benevento<br/>
</span>in 1266, the Guelphs regained their power, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">um </span>they elected <span style="color: #0000FF;">cute<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Anion</span>: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Anion </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>Signor for ten years. This election placed foreign princes in<br/>
t e same position with regard to the republic as had been held by the<br/>
emperors, and their representatives now shared the government with the<br/>
municipal authorities, which ever since the middle of the 13th cent. had<br/>
included the presidents of the seven greater Arts, or guilds (Lawyers and<br/>
Notaries, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cloth-dealers</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Money</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">changers</span>, Wool-weavers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silk-worked</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Physicians and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apothecaries</span>, and Furriers). Fourteen lesser guilds were<br/>
afterwards formed. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1282 </span>the guilds arrogated to themselves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">supreme<br/>
</span>power, and entrusted the government to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Signoria </span>formed of their presidents or Priori (afterwards restricted to eight, elected <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>two months).<br/>
The nobility were kept in check by <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Ordinamenti </span>della <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giustizia</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>series of strict regulations due to Giana <span style="color: #0000FF;">delta </span>Bella (1293), which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">administered </span>by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">alom'ere </span>della <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giusti'zia</span>, supported by a civic militia<br/>
of 1000 (afterwards 000) men. The civic banner bore a red cross upon a<br/>
white ground. After <span style="color: #ff0000;">1303 </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gonfaloniere </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">della </span>Giustizia became the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">resident </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the Priori, with whom were now associated the sixteen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gonfalonieri </span>of the militia, the Capitano del Popolo, and (after 1312) twelve<br/>
magistrates known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Buonuomini</span>. The legislative <span style="color: #0000FF;">prop </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>the body<br/>
thus constituted were submitted to three councils: the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Conse'glio </span>dd <span style="color: #0000FF;">Popolo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>elected at first exclusively from the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperous </span>citizens (<span style="color: #0000FF;">the'pOpolo<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">grasso</span>'), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">delta </span>Credenza, on which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">guild-officials </span>sat, and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commie </span>del <span style="color: #ff0000;">Podestd</span>. Finally they were considered by a General <span style="color: #0000FF;">Council</span>.<br/>
formed of the three separate councils. Offices were held but for a short<br/>
term, in order that as many citizens as possible might enjoy them, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If<br/>
</span>any one were'admonished' for a crime, he became ineligible <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Advantage of this was frequently taken by the party holding the upper<br/>
hand to exclude their opponents from power; and the steady <span style="color: #0000FF;">development<br/>
</span>of constitutional government was interrupted also by the custom of <span style="color: #0000FF;">em<br/>
</span>trusting from time to time, at the request of the Signoria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>committee of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Citizens </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">With </span>the full power <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maria</span>) of altering the laws.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the 14th cent., new <span style="color: #0000FF;">party-struggles </span>among the<br/>
nobles <span style="color: #0000FF;">burst </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">forth</span>, under the new names of the Whites and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Black</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tly</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Guelphs </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">mm</span>) were eventually victorious, and many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
