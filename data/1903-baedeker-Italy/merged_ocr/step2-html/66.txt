and painting. Nor is an inspection of this illustrious master's<br/>
works calculated to dispel the doubt. Unnatural and arbitrary<br/>
features often appear in juxtaposition with what is perfect, profoundly <span style="color: #0000FF;">significant</span>, and faithfully conceived. As in the case of<br/>
Leonardo, we shall find that it is only by studying the master's biography that we can obtain an explanation of these anomalies, and<br/>
reach <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>true appreciation of Michael Angelo's artistic greatness.<br/>
Educated as a sculptor, he exhibits partiality to the nude, and<br/>
treats the drapery in many respects differently from his professional<br/>
brethren. But, like them, his aim is to inspire his figures with life,<br/>
and he seeks to attain it by imparting to them an imposing and impressive character. At the same time he occupies an isolated position,<br/>
at variance with many of the tendencies of his age. Naturally predisposed to melancholy, concealing a gentle and almost effeminate<br/>
temperament beneath a mask of austerity, Michael Angelo was <span style="color: #ff0000;">conflrmed </span>in his peculiarities by the political and ecclesiastical circumstances of his time, and wrapped himself up within the depths of<br/>
his own absorbing thoughts. His sculpture most clearly manifests<br/>
that profound sentiment to which, however, he often <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificed </span>symmetry of form. His figures are therefore anomalous, exhibiting a<br/>
grand conception, but no distinct or tangible thoughts, and least of<br/>
all the traditional ideas. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>now to fathom the hidden<br/>
sentiments which the master intended to embody in his statues and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pictures</span>; his imitators seem to have seen in them nothing but massive<br/>
and clumsy <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>, and soon degenerated into meaningless mannerism.<br/>
The deceptive effect produced by Michael Angelo's style is best <span style="color: #0000FF;">exemplified </span>by some of his later works. His <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mans </span>in San Pietro in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Vincoli </span>is of impossible proportions; such a man can never have<br/>
existed; the small head, the huge arms, and the gigantic torso are<br/>
utterly disproportionate<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the robe which falls over the celebrated<br/>
knee could not be folded as it is represented. Nevertheless the<br/>
work is grandly impressive; and so also are the Monuments of the<br/>
Medici in the New Sacristy of <span style="color: #ff0000;">San </span>Lorenzo <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Florence (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">500</span>),<br/>
in spite of the forced attitude and arbitrary moulding of some of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">urea</span>. Michael Angelo only <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>accuracy of detail in<br/>
order to enhance the aggregate <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. Had so great and talented a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">master </span>not presided over the whole, the danger of an inflated style<br/>
would have been incurred, the forms selected would have been<br/>
exaggerated, and a professional mannerism would have been the<br/>
result. Michael <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â« </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Angelo</span>'s numerous pupils, in their anxiety to<br/>
follow the example of his Last Judgment in the Sistine, succeeded<br/>
only in representing complicated groups of unnaturally foreshortened nude <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>, while Baccio <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bandinelli</span>, thinking even to surpass<br/>
Michael Angelo, produced in his group of Hercules and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>(in<br/>
the Piazza della Signoria at Florence) a mere caricature of his model.<br/>
<br/>
Michael Angelo lived and worked at Florence and Rome alternately. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>him already in Rome at the age of 21 years (1496)<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
