among whom was the poet Dante Alighieri, were banished. The poorer<br/>
families of the nobility entered the greater guilds, and a new aristocracy<br/>
arose, <span style="color: #0000FF;">prominent </span>among whom were the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Acciajoli</span>, Alberti, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buonaccorsi</span>,<br/>
Mancini, Peruzzi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rucellai</span>, Strozzi, The lower ranks of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>- the po <span style="color: #0000FF;">010 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">minute</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>were still excluded from <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe</span>. A large<br/>
portion of the city was burned down in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1304</span>, during a contest between<br/>
the nobles and the people. In the meantime various attempts had been<br/>
made to secure peace and order by appointing <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>foreign prince <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>lord of<br/>
the city. Walter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brianne</span>, Duke of Athens, the last of these governors,<br/>
abolished the constitution by force in 1342, but in the following year he<br/>
was expelled. Power now fell into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of an oligarchy, mainly<br/>
consisting of recently enriched commercial families, who exercised an <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>on every department of government through <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Capitani </span>di Parte<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Guelfa</span>', appointed to administer the estates of the Ghibelline citizens. The<br/>
position and the sentiments of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">burghers </span>had been much altered by<br/>
commercial crises, such as that of 1346, by famine, and by the plague<br/>
of 1348, of which Boccaccio has left a description. An insurrection of<br/>
the poorer <span style="color: #0000FF;">classes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Tumulto </span>dei Ciompi<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>in 1378 was followed by<br/>
three years of anarchy and confusion, until the helm was once <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>seized<br/>
by the aristocratic party, headed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Albizzi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Haw </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Albizzi </span>(d. 1417) was<br/>
succeeded by his son Rinaldo, with whom were associated Niccolo <span style="color: #0000FF;">da </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">throne<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Patio </span>Strozzi. Under <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>rulers Florence enjoyed the greatest prosperity; successful campaigns were waged against the Visconti of Milan<br/>
and Ladislaus of Naples; Pisa was captured in 1406, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cartoon </span>in 1411, Leghorn in 1421. The opulence of the city increased, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nines</span>,<br/>
encouraged by their rapid prosperity, now sought a share in the government. Among <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'POpulani</span>' who were carried along <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the crest of<br/>
the wave, now appear the Me ici, who had acquired immense wealth by.a<br/>
series of successful <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>speculations (see the Genealogy on p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">442</span>).<br/>
The founder of the Medici dynasty <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>Giovanni <span style="color: #0000FF;">de</span>' Medici (<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>1429).<br/>
His son Cosmo was overthrown by the Albizzi in 1433, but returned after<br/>
an exile of one year, and resumed the reins of government with almost<br/>
princely <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence</span>, without, however, interfering with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">outward<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tonne </span>of the republican constitution. A war with Milan was terminated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the victory of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anghiari </span>in 1440. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pope </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Eugenio </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ive</span>, who lived in<br/>
Florence from <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>till 1443, transferred hither in 1439 the Council of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ierrara </span>(p. 359), by which the union of the Roman and Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">church</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>decreed. Cosimo employed his wealth liberally in the advancement<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>art and science, he was the patron of Brunelleschi, Donatello, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Micheozzo</span>, Masaccio and Lippi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>he founded the Platonic Academy (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.UN<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>the Medici Library<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the close of his life he was not undeservedly<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">urnamed </span>pater <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriae </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florentines</span>. He was succeeded by his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">nfirm </span>son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Piero </span>in 1464, and in 1469 by his grandson <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lonnuzo</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">surnamed<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Magnifico</span>, who, as a statesman, poet, and patron of art and science<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ttained </span>a very high reputation. Florence now became the great <span style="color: #ff0000;">centre </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span>he Renaissance, the object of which was to revive the poetry, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eleuence</span>, and the art and science of antiquity. Contemporaneously with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lost </span>eminent artists the brilliant court of the Medici was graced by the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">arlieet </span>of modern philologists. The conspiracy of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram </span>(1478), to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.orenzo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>brother Giuliano fell a victim, did not avail to undermine the<br/>
ower of this ruler, but brought the bloody revenge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>on<br/>
is opponents. Lorenzo knew both how to defend himself against ex: rnal dangers by prudent alliances, and to secure his position at home<br/>
y lavish expenditure <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>a magnificent style of living, which, however,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'as-partly </span>maintained b the public treasury. He died at Careggi on April<br/>
th, 1492, at the age of years. <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>absolute prince in all but the name.<br/>
After the death of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Forte </span>the Florentine love of liberty, largely ex<br/>
'ted by the voice of the Dominican friar Girolamo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saconarola</span>, rebelled<br/>
gainst the magnificent rule of the Medici. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hero</span>, the feeble son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">L0</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nzo</span>, resigned the frontier-fortresses into the hands of Charles VIII. of<br/>
rance, on his campaign against Naples, and, on the king's departure, he<br/>
as expelled, with his brothers Giovanni and Giuliano, and the government<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ntrusted </span>to a democratic Great Council (1494). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Savonarola</span>, having <span style="color: #ff0000;">attacked<br/>
