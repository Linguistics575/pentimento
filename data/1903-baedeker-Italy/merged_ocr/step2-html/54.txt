<span>ITALIAN ART. xliii<br/>
<br/>
truth, fidelity to nature, and a correct rendering of real life in<br/>
its <span style="color: #ff0000;">minutest </span>details are among the necessary qualities in a<br/>
perfect work. The realism of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representation </span>is, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">051533</span>;;<br/>
only the basis for the expression of lifelike character and "<span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>present enjoyment. The earlier artists of the Renaissance ARTISTS <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO<br/>
</span>rarely exhibit partiality for pathetic scenes, or events which <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">URE'<br/>
</span>awaken painful emotions and turbulent passions, and when such<br/>
incidents are represented, they are apt to be somewhat exaggerated. The preference of these masters obviously inclines to cheerful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>joyous subjects. In the works of the 15th century strict faithfulness, in an objective sense, must not be looked for. Whether the<br/>
topic be derived from the Old or the New Testament, from history or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">table</span>, it is always transplanted to the immediate present, and adorned with the colours of actual life. Thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Florentines </span>of the genuine<br/>
national type are represented as surrounding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriarch</span>, visiting<br/>
Elizabeth after the birth of her son, or witnessing the miracles of<br/>
Christ. This transference of remote events to the present bears a<br/>
striking resemblance to the naive and not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasing </span>tone of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chronicler</span>. The development of Italian art, however, by no <span style="color: #0000FF;">molne<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">minutes </span>with mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">fidelity </span>to nature, a quality likewise displayed<br/>
by the contemporaneous art of the North. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">superficial </span>glance at<br/>
the works of the Italian Renaissance enables one to <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognise </span>the<br/>
higher goal of imagination. The carefully selected groups of <span style="color: #ff0000;">digniMd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>beautiful women, and pleasing children, occasionally<br/>
without internal necessity placed in the foreground, <span style="color: #ff0000;">prove </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">attractiveness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eminently </span>aimed at. This is also evidenced by<br/>
the early-awakened enthusiasm for the nude, by the skill in disposition of drapery, and the care devoted to boldness of outline and<br/>
accuracy of form. This aim is still more obvious from the keen<br/>
sense of symmetry observable in all the better <span style="color: #0000FF;">artiste</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">indiVidual </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>are not coldly and accurately drawn in conformity<br/>
with systematic rules. They are executed with refined taste and<br/>
feeling; harshness of expression and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasing </span>characteristics are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sedulously </span>avoided, while in the art of the North (ag. in wood-cuts<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">engravings</span>) physiognomic fidelity is usually accompanied by extreme rigidity. A taste for symmetry does not prevail in the formation of the individual figure only; obedience to rhythmical precepts<br/>
is perceptible in the disposition of the groups also, and in the composition of the entire work. The intimate connection between Italian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">painting </span>(fresco) and architecture naturally leads to the transference<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">architectural </span>rules to the province of pictorial art, whereby not<br/>
only the invasion of a mere luxuriant naturalism was obviated, but<br/>
the fullest <span style="color: #0000FF;">scape </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mottled </span>to the artist for the execution of his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">task</span>. For, to discover the <span style="color: #0000FF;">meet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">effective </span>proportions, to inspire life<br/>
into a scene by the very rhythm of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lineaments</span>, are not accomplishments to be acquired by extraneous aid; precise measurement<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">calculation </span>are here of no avail; a discriminating eye, <span style="color: #0000FF;">refined<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
