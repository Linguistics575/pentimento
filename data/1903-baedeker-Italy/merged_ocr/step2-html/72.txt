them. Later he <span style="color: #0000FF;">basked </span>in the favour of Charles <span style="color: #ff0000;">V. </span>and Philip II. of<br/>
Spain. The natural result of this was that the painting of portraits<br/>
and of mythological subjects engrossed the greater part of his time<br/>
and talents. That Titian<span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>genius, however, was by no means alien<br/>
to religion and deep feeling in art, and that his imagination was as<br/>
rich and powerful in this field as in <span style="color: #ff0000;">pourtraying </span>realistic and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sonsually </span>attractive forms of existence, is proved by his ecclesiastical<br/>
paintings, of which the finest are the Pesaro Madonna (p. 311), the<br/>
Martyrdom of St. Lawrence <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>301), the Presentation in the Temple<br/>
(p. 290), and the Assumption (p. 285) at Venice.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to the soundness of the principles on which the Venetian<br/>
school was based, there is no wide gulf between its masters of the<br/>
highest and <span style="color: #0000FF;">those </span>of secondary rank, as is <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>often the case in the<br/>
other Italian schools; and we accordingly find that works by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Loanxzo </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lorro</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">SEBASTIAN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DBL </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">P1011130 </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lvii</span>), the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bommzros</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">PonDBNONB</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Puma </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bonnema</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jaooro </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TINTORBTTO </span>frequently vie<br/>
in beauty with those of the more renowned chiefs of their school.<br/>
Even PAOLO <span style="color: #ff0000;">CALIABI</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">sumamed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Vmwrmen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ct528-88</span>), the last great<br/>
master of his school, shows as yet no trace <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>approaching<br/>
period of decline, but continues to delight the beholder with his<br/>
delicate silvery <span style="color: #0000FF;">tint</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and the spirit and richness of his compositions.<br/>
<br/>
Correggio, as well as subsequent Venetian masters, were frequently taken as models by the Italian painters of the 17th century,<br/>
and the influence they exercised could not fail to be detected even by the amateur, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">post</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Raphaelite<br/>
</span>period were not usually overlooked. Those, however, who<br/>
make the great cinquecentists their principal study will doubtless<br/>
be <span style="color: #ff0000;">10th </span>to examine the works of their successors. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Magnificent </span>decorative works are occasionally encountered, but the taste is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offended </span>by the undisguised love of pomp and <span style="color: #0000FF;">superficial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mannerism </span>which they generally display. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Artiste </span>no longer earnestly identify themselves with the ideas they embody; they<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mechanically </span>reproduce the customary themes, they lose the desire,<br/>
and finally the ability to compose independently. They are, moreover, <span style="color: #0000FF;">deficient </span>in taste for beauty of form, which, as is well known,<br/>
is most attractive when most simple and natural. Their technical<br/>
skill is not the result of mature experience, slowly acquired and<br/>
justly valued: they came into easy possession of great resources of<br/>
art, which they frivolously and unworthily squander. The quaint,<br/>
the extravagant, the piquant alone stimulates their taste; rapidity,<br/>
not excellence of workmanship, is their aim. Abundant specimens<br/>
of this mannerism, <span style="color: #0000FF;">exemplified </span>in the works of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zuccano</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">D'Anrmo</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tmns'u</span>, and others, are encountered at Rome and Florence<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">cupola </span>of the cathedral). The fact that several works of this<br/>
class produce a less <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>impression does not alter their<br/>
general position, as it is not want of talent so much as of <span style="color: #0000FF;">con-v<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">scientiousness </span>which is attributed to these artists<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
