<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Maggiore</span>. It was at that period the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ingest </span>church in existence<br/>
and it is still one of the largest and most sumptuous in the world.<br/>
This huge structure <span style="color: #0000FF;">cover</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of 14,000 sq. yds. (of which about<br/>
2400 sq. yds. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Are </span>taken up by the walls and pillars), and holds about<br/>
40,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>. The interior is 162 yds. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>length, the transept<br/>
96 yds. in breadth, the facade 73 yds. in breadth; nave 157 ft. in<br/>
height, 18 yds. in breadth. The dome is 220 ft. in height, the tower<br/>
360 ft. above the pavement. The roof, marble like the rest of the<br/>
building, is adorned with 98 turrets, and the exterior with upwards<br/>
of 2000 statues in marble. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">stained-glass </span>windows in the choir<br/>
are said to be the largest in the world. The cathedral was founded<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">splendour-loving </span>Gian Galeazzo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Visconti </span>in 1386. The general<br/>
style of the building is Gothic, but shows many peculiarities. The<br/>
author of the original design is unknown; Marco da Campione (d.<br/>
1390) and Simone da <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orsenigo </span>(who was master-builder in 1387)<br/>
have been named, but without any positive proof. The building<br/>
progressed but slowly, owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dimensions </span>between the Italian<br/>
architects and the German and French masters (Nicholas <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bonaventuri</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ham </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">van </span>Freiburg, Heinrich <span style="color: #0000FF;">eon </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gmiind</span>, Ulrich von <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fitssingcn</span>, Jean Mignot, and others, who were frequently called to<br/>
their aid. Between 1459 and 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>Guiniforte Solari is mentioned<br/>
among the superintendents of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">building-operations</span>; about 1500<br/>
Francesco di Giorgio of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stems </span>and Giov. Ant. Amadeo appear to<br/>
have been associated in the that <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>; and after them the work<br/>
was conducted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dolcebuono</span>, Cristoforo Solari, etc. The crypt and<br/>
the baptistery, the style of which is quite out of harmony with the<br/>
general design of the building, were added in the second half of<br/>
the 16th cent. by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pellegrino </span>Tibaldi, who also laid down the marble<br/>
pavement and designed a baroque facade. The church was <span style="color: #0000FF;">consecrated </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">03110 </span>Borromeo on Oct. 20th, 1577. The dome was<br/>
begun in 1759 by the architects <span style="color: #0000FF;">Croce </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mania</span>, and was finished<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1775</span>. The facade, begun in 1615 after Tibaldi's design, remained<br/>
uncompleted, until in 1805 Napoleon (whose marble statue, in<br/>
antique costume, is among those on the roof) caused the works to<br/>
be resumed, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications </span>by Amati. But this entire facade<br/>
is being gradually removed since 1900, and a new one in strict harmony with the style of the rest of the church erected according to<br/>
the plan of the young architect Giuseppe Brentano (d. 1889), whose<br/>
design won the first prize in an <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>competition in 1888.<br/>
<br/>
The church is cruciform in shape, with double aisles and a transept, the latter also flanked with aisles. The INTERIOR is supported<br/>
by fifty-two pillars, each 16 paces in circumference, the summits<br/>
of which are adorned with canopied niches with statues instead of<br/>
capitals. The pavement consists of mosaic in marble of different<br/>
colours.<br/>
<br/>
INTERIOR. By the principal inner portal are two huge monolith <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>of granite from the quarries of Baveno (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN</span>). RIGHT <span style="color: #0000FF;">AISLE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
