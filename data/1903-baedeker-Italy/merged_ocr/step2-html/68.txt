so striking as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling-paintings</span>, owing in a great measure to its<br/>

<br/>
Whether the palm be due to Michael Angelo or to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Replies</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>(1.4831520) among the artists of Italy is a question which formerly gave<br/>
rise to vehement discussion among artists and amateurs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Run</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>.<br/>
The admirer of Michael Angelo need, however, by no <span style="color: #0000FF;">mean</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>he precluded from enjoying the works of Raphael. We now know<br/>
that it is far more advantageous to form an acquaintance with<br/>
each master in his peculiar province, than anxiously to weigh<br/>
their respective merits; and the more minutely we examine <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span>works, the more firmly we are persuaded that neither in any way<br/>
obstructed the progress of the other, and that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>higher<br/>
combination of the two styles was impossible. Michael Angelo's<br/>
unique position among his contemporaries was such, that no one,<br/>
Raphael not excepted, was entirely exempt from <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>influence;<br/>
but the result of preceding development was <span style="color: #0000FF;">turned </span>to the best<br/>
account, not by him, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Raphael, whose susceptible and<br/>
discriminating character enabled him at once to combine <span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
</span>tendencies within himself, and to avoid the faults of his predecessors. Raphael's pictures are replete with indications of profound <span style="color: #0000FF;">sentiment</span>, but his imagination was so constituted that he did<br/>
not distort the ideas which he had to embody in order to accommodate them to his own views, but rather strove to identify himself<br/>
with them, and to reproduce them with the utmost fidelity. In the<br/>
case of Raphael, therefore, a knowledge of his works and the enjoyment of them are almost inseparable, and it is difficult to point<br/>
out any single sphere with which he was especially familiar. He<br/>
presents to us with equal enthusiasm <span style="color: #0000FF;">picture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of the Madonna, and<br/>
the myth of Cupid and Psyche; in great cyclic compositions he is<br/>
as brilliant as in the limited sphere of <span style="color: #0000FF;">portrait-painting</span>; at one<br/>
time he appears to attach paramount importance to strictness of<br/>
style, architectural arrangement, symmetry of groups, etc.; at other<br/>
times one is tempted to believe that he regarded colour as his most<br/>
effective auxiliary. His excellence consists in his rendering equal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">justice </span>to the most varied subjects, and in each case <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>unhesitatingly pursuing the right course, both in his apprehension of the<br/>
idea and selection of form, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>he had never followed any other.<br/>
<br/>
Little is known of Raphael's private life, nor is it known by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>master he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>trained after the death of Giovanni, his father<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1494</span>). In 1500 he entered the studio of Perugino (p. liii), and<br/>
probably soon assisted in the execution of some of the works of his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">prolific </span>master. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>Raphael's early or Umbrian period there are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">enmples </span>in the Vatican Gallery (Coronation of Mary) and the Brera<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>Milan (Sposalizio of the Madonna, 1504). On settling at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Florence<br/>
