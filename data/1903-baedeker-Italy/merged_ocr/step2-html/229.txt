History. The favourable situation of Milan in the centre of Lombardy,<br/>
near the beginning of several of the great Alpine passes, has always secured<br/>
for it a high degree of prosperity. Under the Romans, who conquered <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">B</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0</span>. 222, it was one of the largest cities in Italy, but owing to its<br/>
re eated destruction hardly a trace of that period has been left <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">188</span>).<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">After </span>the decay of the Lombard sovereignty the power of the archbishops<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hi</span>) increased enormously, es <span style="color: #ff0000;">ecially </span>under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aribert </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">1018-46</span>), against<br/>
whom the smaller vessels were <span style="color: #0000FF;">breed </span>to form a later date the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>, grouped round the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Garroceio</span>, fought<br/>
for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ArchbishOps </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ainst </span>Conrad II. <span style="color: #0000FF;">And </span>the noblesse, expelling the<br/>
latter from the city in 041. At this time Milan is said to have contained<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">300,000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, and its trade and industry especially the weaving of<br/>
woollen goods and the making of arms and <span style="color: #0000FF;">objects </span>in gold, had become<br/>
very <span style="color: #0000FF;">1m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">anant</span>. The Roman walls had long since become too cramped,<br/>
and in 157 an almost circular moat, still preserved in the inner canal<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Naviglio</span>), was constructed round the town. Neither this <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortification</span>,<br/>
however, nor the heroic courage of the Milanese could resist the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Em</span>.<br/>
Frederick <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barbaroua</span>, who, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">help </span>of the Ghibelline towns of Lombardy, totally destroyed the city in 11 2, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception </span>of a few<br/>
churches. The emperor<span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>severe rule, however, soon roused the whole of<br/>
Lombardy against him; <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years later (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1167</span>) Milan <span style="color: #0000FF;">wee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rebuilt </span>by the<br/>
allied cities of Brescia <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bergamo</span>, Mantua, <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Verona </span>while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bettle<br/>

furnished several occupants to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">archiepiscopal </span>chair, made an end of<br/>
the city's constitutional independence, but contributed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">well-being </span>by<br/>
the introduction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silk-industry </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ca</span>. 1340) and by the wide extension<br/>
of their sway. A new outer rampart (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maud </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">heavens</span>) was constructed in this period to protect the suburbs. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">drones </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">11504555</span>)<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to reconcile the Milanese to their loss of liberty by the brilliancy of their court and their patronage of art..<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>of the early part of the 16th cent<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the heavy taxes of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spawn </span>Period did not prevent the growth of the city, which in 1590<br/>
numbered <span style="color: #ff0000;">246,000 </span>inhabitants. In 1527 <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-walls </span>were erected on the<br/>
site of the outer ramparts, and in 1519 a new series of fortified and bastioned<br/>
walls were begun. In 1714 Milan, with the rest of Lombardy, passed into<br/>
the hands of Austria. In 1797 it became the capital of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Gt'salpine </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Republic</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, and then (down to 1815) that of the Kingdom of Italy. The bloody<br/>
insurrection of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheque </span>Giornate (March 17th-22nd, 1848) compelled the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Austrians </span>to evacuate the city, and the patriotic <span style="color: #0000FF;">agitation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>which ensued<br/>
were happily ended by the desired union with the new kingdom of Italy<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1859</span>. No town in Italy has undergone such marked improvement as<br/>
Milan since this date.<br/>

Art History. The only buildings of the early-Christian and Romance <span style="color: #0000FF;">uei<br/>
</span>periods that survived the destruction of 1162 were the churches of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
</span>Lorenzo (the oldest church in <span style="color: #0000FF;">mien</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sant</span>' Ambrogio (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">quaintest </span>church<br/>

The Gothic churches are more of decorative than constructive value;<br/>
some, like the cathedral, represent a not very successful compromise between the styles of the N. and of Italy, while others follow Venetian<br/>
models (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Frari</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
