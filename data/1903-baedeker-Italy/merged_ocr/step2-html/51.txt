<br/>
pression, warmly extolled their authors, and zealously proclaimed<br/>
how greatly they surpassed their ancestors. But succeeding <span style="color: #0000FF;">generations </span>began to lose sight of this connection between ancient and<br/>
modern art. A mere anecdote was deemed <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>to connect<br/>
Giotto <span style="color: #0000FF;">di </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bondone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1276</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1337</span>), the father of modern Italian art,<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">GIOVANNI </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gunman </span>(d. after 1302), the most celebrated representative of the earlier style. (Cimabue is said to have watched<br/>
Giotto, when, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shepherd-boy</span>, relieving the monotony of his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>by tracing the outlines of his sheep in the sand, and to have<br/>
received him as a pupil in consequence.) But it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>forgotten<br/>
that a revolution in artistic ideas and forms had taken place at<br/>
Rome and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siena </span>still earlier than <span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>Florence, that both <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cimabue<br/>
</span>and his pupil Giotto had numerous professional brethren, and<br/>
that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">composition'of </span>mosaics, <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>well as mural and <span style="color: #ff0000;">panelpainting</span>, was still successfully practised. Subsequent investigation<br/>
has rectified these errors, pointed out the Roman and Tuscan mosaics<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>works of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">transition-period</span>, and restored the Sienese master<br/>
Duccio (ca. 1300), who <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>remarkable for his sense of the beautiful and the expressiveness of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>, to his merited rank.<br/>
Giotto, however, is fully entitled to rank in the highest class. The<br/>
amateur, who before entering Italy has become acquainted with<br/>
Giotto from <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">easel-pictures </span>only, often arbitrarily<br/>
attributed to this master, and even in Italy itself encounters<br/>
little else than obliquely drawn eyes, clumsy features, and<br/>
cumbrous masses of drapery as characteristics of his style, will<br/>
regard Giotto's reputation as ill-founded. He will be at a loss<br/>
to comprehend why Giotto is regarded as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inaugurator </span>of a<br/>
new era of art, and why the name of the old Florentine master<br/>
is only second in popularity to that of Raphael. The fact is that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ammo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>Giotto's celebrity is not due to any single perfect work of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">INFLUENCE </span>art. His indefatigable energy in different spheres of art, the<br/>
enthusiasm which he kindled in every direction, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>for which he paved the way, must be taken into consideration,<br/>
in order that his place in history may be understood. Even when,<br/>
in consonance with the poetical sentiments of his age, he embodies<br/>
allegorical conceptions, as poverty, chastity, obedience, or displays<br/>
to us a ship as an emblem of the Church of Christ, he shows a<br/>
masterly acquaintance with the art of converting what is perhaps<br/>
in itself an ungrateful idea into a speaking, lifelike scene.<br/>
Giotto is an adept in narration, in imparting a faithful reality to<br/>
his compositions. The individual figures in his pictures may fail<br/>
to satisfy the expectations, and even earlier masters, such as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Duccio</span>, may have surpassed him in execution, but intelligibility<br/>
of movement and dramatic effect were first naturalised in art by<br/>
Giotto. This is partly attributable to the luminous colouring<br/>
employed by him instead of the dark and heavy tones of his<br/>
predecessors, enabling him to impart the <span style="color: #0000FF;">proper </span>expression <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
