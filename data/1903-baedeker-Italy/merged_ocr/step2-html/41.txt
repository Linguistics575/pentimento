<br/>
warm days it is advisable to drive thither and walk back, as otherwise the visitor enters the cool building in a heated state and has<br/>
afterwards no <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>of regaining the desirable temperature<br/>
through exercise. Exposure to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">summer-sun </span>should be avoided<br/>
as much as possible. According to a Roman proverb, dogs and foreigners (Inglesi) alone walk in the sun, Christians in the shade. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Umbrellas</span>, or spectacles of coloured glass (grey, concave glasses to protect the whole eye are best), may be used with advantage. Blue veils<br/>
are recommended to ladies. Repose during the hottest <span style="color: #0000FF;">hour</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>is advisable, and a moderate siesta is often refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">care </span>should also be taken in the selection of an apartment.<br/>
Carpets and stoves are indispensable in winter. A southern aspect in<br/>
winter is an absolute essential for delicate persons, and highly desirable for the robust. The visitor should see that all the doors and<br/>
windows close satisfactorily. Windows should be closed at night. If<br/>
there is the slightest suspicion of dampness in the bed-clothes,<br/>
recourse should be had to the warming-pan (<span style="color: #0000FF;">mutant </span>fuoco <span style="color: #0000FF;">net </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lean</span>).<br/>

English and German chemists, where available, are recommended in preference to the Italian, whose drugs are at once <span style="color: #0000FF;">dens</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>and of poorer quality. Foreigners frequently suffer from <span style="color: #0000FF;">diarrhea </span>in<br/>
Italy, which is generally occasioned by the unwonted heat. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">homeopathic </span>tincture of camphor may be mentioned as a remedy,<br/>
but regulated diet and thorough repose are the chief desiderata.'A<br/>
small portable <span style="color: #0000FF;">medicine-case</span>, such <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>those prepared and stocked with<br/>
