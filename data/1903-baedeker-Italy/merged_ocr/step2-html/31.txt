expected to dine <span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">table-d'hdte</span>; otherwise the charge for rooms<br/>
is apt to be raised. The charges for meals furnished in private rooms<br/>
or at unusual times are much higher. Other'extras' are also dear.<br/>
The cuisine is a mixture of French and Italian. During the season<br/>
and at the more frequented resorts it is advisable to engage rooms<br/>
in advance, especially if arriving in the evening. It is advisable to<br/>
prepay the answer, to prevent disappointment on arrival. Gentlemen<br/>
travelling alone may leave their luggage at the station until <span style="color: #0000FF;">room</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
</span>have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">secured </span>The charge for the use of the hotel-omnibus<br/>
from the station to the hotel is so high (<span style="color: #0000FF;">141/1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eloh</span>), that it is<br/>
often cheaper to take a cab. It is also easier for those who use a cab to<br/>
proceed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hotel</span>, should they not like the rooms <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofiered </span>them.<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">SECOND </span>CLASS <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>(Alberghi; in the S. districts, also <span style="color: #ff0000;">Locande</span>) are less comfortable and thoroughly Italian in their arrangements. The charges are little more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-half </span>of the above: room<br/>
1-3, attendance 1/2, omnibus <span style="color: #0000FF;">1/2-1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fr</span>. They have no <span style="color: #0000FF;">table-ite</span>, but<br/>
there is generally <span style="color: #ff0000;">atrattoria </span>connected with the house, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">refreshments </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ta </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">earth </span>or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pretty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">foo</span>, may be procured. Fair<br/>
native wines, usually on draught, are furnished in these houses at<br/>
moderate prices. Morning <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee </span>is usually taken at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>not<br/>
at the inn. It is customary to make enquiries beforehand as to the<br/>
charges for rooms, not forgetting the servizio e candela; and the<br/>
price of the dinner (if not a la carte) should also <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>agreed upon<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">2-4 </span>fr., with wine <span style="color: #0000FF;">21/3-41/3 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fro</span>. These inns will often be found<br/>
convenient and economical by the voyageur en <span style="color: #0000FF;">gar-con</span>, and the better<br/>
houses of this class may even be visited by ladies, when at home in<br/>
Italian; the new-comer should frequent hotels of the first class only.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Horan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gums </span>are to be found in most of the larger towns,<br/>
with charges for rooms similar to those in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second-class </span>hotels.<br/>
<br/>
As matches are rarely found in hotels, the guest should provide himself<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a sup 1y of the wax-matches <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cerini</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>sold in the streets (1-2 boxes<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">10915 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0.</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">gap </span>is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">high-priced'extra</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
Money or objects of value should either be carried on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>person <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'left </span>with the landlord in exchange for a receipt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PENSIONS </span>of the larger towns and resorts also <span style="color: #0000FF;">receive </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passing<br/>
</span>travellers. The charge is about the same as that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second-class<br/>
</span>inns and usually includes table-wine. As, however, the price of<br/>
d√©jeuner is usually (though not universally) included in the fixed<br/>
daily charge, the traveller has either to <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>some of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">best </span>hours<br/>
for visiting the galleries or to pay for a meal he does not consume.<br/>
<br/>
For a prolonged stay in one place families will find it much<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>cheaper to hire <span style="color: #0000FF;">vaun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>do their own housekeeping. A rent lower than that first asked for is often accepted. When<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>whole suite of apartments is hired, a written contract on stamped<br/>
paper should be drawn up with the aid of someone acquainted<br/>
with the language and customs of the place (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>a banker), in order<br/>
