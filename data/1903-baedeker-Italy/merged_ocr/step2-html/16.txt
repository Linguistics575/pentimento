</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fie </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">objects </span>of the Handbook for Italy, which consists of<br/>
three volumes, each complete in itself, are to supply the traveller with some information regarding the culture and art of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>he is about to visit, as well as regarding the natural features of the country, to render him as independent as<br/>
possible of the services of guides and <span style="color: #0000FF;">valets-de-place</span>, to protect him against extortion, and in every way to aid him in<br/>
deriving enjoyment and instruction from his tour in one of<br/>
the most fascinating countries in the world.<br/>
<br/>
_ The Handbook is founded on the Editor's personal acquaintance with the places described, most of which he has<br/>
repeatedly and carefully explored. As, however, changes<br/>
are constantly taking place, he will highly appreciate any<br/>
communications with which travellers may kindly favour<br/>
him, if the result of their own observation. The information<br/>
already received from correspondents, which he gratefully<br/>
acknowledges, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hat </span>in many cases proved most serviceable.<br/>
<br/>
The present volume, corresponding to the sixteenth German edition, has, like its predecessor, been thoroughly revised<br/>
and considerably augmented. Its contents have been divided<br/>
into groups of routes arranged historically and geographically<br/>
(Piedmont, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiguria</span>, Lombardy, Venetia, The Emilia, and<br/>
Tuscany), each group being provided with a prefatory outline<br/>
of the history of the district. Each section is also prefaced<br/>
with a list of the routes it contains, and may be removed<br/>
from the volume and used separately if desired.<br/>
<br/>
The introductory article on Art, which has special <span style="color: #0000FF;">reference </span>to Northern Italy and Florence, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">art-historical<br/>
</span>notices prefixed to the descriptions of the larger towns and<br/>
principal picture - <span style="color: #0000FF;">galleries </span>are due to the late Professor<br/>
Springer, of Leipzig. In the descriptions of individual <span style="color: #0000FF;">pictures </span>the works of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Month</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crows </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cavalcasellc</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Burchhardt </span>have been laid extensively under contribution, and also<br/>
occasionally those of Ruskin and others<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
