<span>lvi ITALIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>Florence, after the banishment of the Medici, offered no favourable field for the practice of art. Here he <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiselled </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Find </span>and<br/>
the Bacchus. In the beginning of the 16th cent. he returned to his<br/>
home, where he produced his David <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">began </span>work on the cycle<br/>
of frescoes destined for the great hall of the Palazzo Vecchio<br/>
(Battle Cartoon, see p. 446). In 1505 the Pope recalled him to<br/>
Rome, but the work entrusted to him there, the Tomb of Julius II.,<br/>
was at this time little more than begun. The Ceiling <span style="color: #0000FF;">Painting</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in<br/>
the Sistine Chapel absorbed his whole attention from 1508 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">1512</span>.<br/>
After the death of Julius, his monument was resumed on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>more<br/>
extensive scale. The commands of the new pope, Leo X., however,<br/>
who wished to employ the artist for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">glorification </span>of his own<br/>
family, soon brought the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ambitiously </span>designed memorial once more<br/>
to a standstill. From 1516 onwards Michael Angelo dwelt <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cari-are<br/>
</span>and Florence, occupied at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>with the construction and <span style="color: #0000FF;">embellishment </span>of the Facade of San Lorenzo, which was never completed,<br/>
and then with the Tombs of the Medici. This work also advanced<br/>
very slowly towards maturity, and at last the artist, disgusted with<br/>
the tyranny of the Medici, set up in their places those of the statues<br/>
which were finished, and migrated to Rome (about 1534). <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>work here was the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, his next<br/>
the erection of the scanty fragments of the tomb of Pope Julius.<br/>
His last years were mainly devoted to architecture (St. Peter' <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>).<br/>
Amateurs will best be enabled to render justice to Michael<br/>
Angelo by <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>devoting their attention to his earlier works,<br/>
among which in the province of sculpture the group of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fiat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
</span>'in St. Peter's occupies the highest rank. The statues of Bacchus<br/>
and David (at Florence; pp. 473, 493) likewise do not transgress<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">customary </span>precepts of the art of the Renaissance. Paintings of<br/>
Michael Angelo's earlier period are rare; the finest, whether conceived in the midst of his youthful studies, or in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">mature</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>years,<br/>
is unquestionably the ceiling-painting in the Sistine. The architectural arrangement of the ceiling, and the composition of the several<br/>
pictures are equally masterly; the taste and discrimination of the<br/>
painter and sculptor are admirably combined. In God the Father,<br/>
Michael Angelo produced a perfect type of its kind; he understood how to inspire with dramatic life the abstract idea of the<br/>
act of creation, which he conceived as motion<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the prophets and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sibyls</span>, notwithstanding the apparent monotony of the fundamental<br/>
intention (foreshadowing of the Redemption), <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great variety of<br/>
psychological incidents are displayed and embodied in distinct<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">characters</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lastly</span>, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Ancestors of Christ, the forms<br/>
represented are the genuine emanations of Michael Angelo' s genius,<br/>
pervaded by his profound and sombre sentiments, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">yet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>no<br/>
means destitute of gracefulness and beauty. The decorative <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures<br/>
</span>also which he designed to give life to his architectural frame-work<br/>
are wonderfully beautiful and spirited. The Last Judgment, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
