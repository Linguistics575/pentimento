</span>day', or the time during which invalids may remain in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open<br/>
</span>air with impunity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lute </span>here from 10 <span style="color: #0000FF;">mu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to 4 p.m. The general<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">chest </span>of a prolonged course of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Open-air </span>life in the Riviera may be<br/>
described as a gentle stimulation of the entire physical organism.<br/>
It is found particularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficial </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">convalescents</span>, the debilitated,<br/>
and the aged; for children of scrofulous tendency; and for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">martyrs </span>of gout and rheumatism. The climatic cure of the Riviera is<br/>
also often prescribed to patients with weak <span style="color: #0000FF;">chests</span>, to assist in the<br/>
removal of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">after-efi'ects </span>of inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy,<br/>
or to obviate the danger of the formation of a chronic pulmonary<br/>
discharge. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>dry and frequently-agitated <span style="color: #0000FF;">air </span>of the Riviera is,<br/>
however, by no means suitable for every patient of this kind, and<br/>
the immediate vicinity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>is particularly <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>to<br/>
cases of a feverish or nervous character. The stimulating effects of<br/>
the climate are then often too powerful, producing sleeplessness<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>unwholesome irritation. The dry air of the Riviera di Ponente<br/>
is also prejudicial to many forms of inflammation of the wind-pipe<br/>
and bronchial tubes, which derive benefit from the air of Nervi,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pin</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ajaccio</span>. Cases of protracted nephritis or diabetes, on the<br/>
contrary, often obtain considerable relief <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>a residence here.<br/>
<br/>
The season on the Ligurian coast lasts from about the beginning of October to the middle of May. In September <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is still too<br/>
hot, and in March it is so windy that many patients are obliged to<br/>
retire farther inland. Many invalids make the mistake of leaving<br/>
the Riviera too soon, and thus lose all the progress they have made<br/>
during the winter, through reaching home in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>transition period between winter and spring. It is better to spend April<br/>
and May at some intermediate station, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Panama</span>, Cannero,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Locum</span>, Lugano, or Gardone Riviera.<br/>
<br/>
Good <span style="color: #0000FF;">Opportunities </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-bathing </span>are offered at many points<br/>
on the Mediterranean coast of N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Italy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maria</span>, Savona,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pegli</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Species</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viareggio</span>, Leghorn, and Venice. The Mediterranean is<br/>
almost tideless; it contains about 41 per cent of common salt, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerably </span>higher proportion than the Atlantic; its average <span style="color: #0000FF;">temperature </span>during the bathing-season <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">71Â° </span>Fahr. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">bathing-season<br/>
</span>on the Ligurian coast begins in April, or at latest in May, and lasts<br/>
till November, being thus much longer than the season at any English<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">seaside-resort</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Most travellers must in some degree alter their mode of living<br/>
whilst in Italy, without however implicitly adopting the Italian style.<br/>
Inhabitants of more northern countries generally become unusually<br/>
susceptible to cold in Italy, and therefore should not omit to be well<br/>
supplied with warm clothing for the winter. Woollen <span style="color: #0000FF;">underclothing </span>is<br/>
especially to be recommended. A cloak or shawl should <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>carried to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">neutralise </span>the often considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>of temperature between the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sunshine </span>and the shade. In visiting picture-galleries or churches <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
