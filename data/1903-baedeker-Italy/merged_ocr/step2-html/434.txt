<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Mark and the kneeling figure of Doge Franc. Foscari,<br/>
above the portal, is modern (comp. p. 281).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Comm </span>was begun about 1483 by Ant. Risso,<br/>
continued in 1499-1511 by Pietro <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lombardo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>in 1545-50 by Ant.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Searpagnino</span>, but only partly completed. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">florid </span>facade on the E.<br/>
side is probably by Rizzo. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">little'Facade </span>adjoining St. Mark's<br/>
at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. corner, attributed to Gugl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bergamasco </span>(1520), is less<br/>
gorgeous, but more happily <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportioned</span>. Within one of the highest<br/>
windows to the left of the main facade was the prison of the poet<br/>
Count Silvio <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pellico </span>in 1822, before he was removed to the Spielberg <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Briinn </span>(comp. p. 43). In the centre of the court are two<br/>
Well <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>in bronze, of 1556 and 1559. On the facade of the<br/>
Clock Tower, to the right, is a statue of the Venetian general Duke<br/>
Francis Maria I. of Urbino (d. 1538) by the Florentine sculptor<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">G. </span>Bandini. The other statues are antique, but freely restored.<br/>
<br/>
The richly ornamented Scala <span style="color: #0000FF;">dci </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Giganti</span>, the flight of steps leading<br/>
to the palace, derives its name from the colossal statues of Mars and<br/>
Neptune at the top, by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sansooino </span>(1554). On the highest landing of<br/>
these steps, in the later period of the Republic, the doges were<br/>
crowned. Opposite are beautiful statues <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Adam </span>and Eve, by<br/>
Antonio Rizzo (1464).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The'Iru'nmon </span>(admission, see p. 265; <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span>,<br/>
to the right) is another prominent specimen of Venetian art,<br/>
although it was robbed of many treasures by the French in 1797.<br/>
While the earliest native painters devoted their energies to the<br/>
church of St. Mark, the great masters of the 15th and 16th cent.<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>engaged in the Palace of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Degas</span>. As, however,<br/>
their works were destroyed by the great fire of 1577, the palace<br/>
now forms a museum of later masters only, such <span style="color: #ff0000;">asTintoretto</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Paola </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Verona</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, and Palma <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me</span>, but it still presents a most<br/>
brilliant display of Venetian painting, so far as executed for behoof<br/>
of the state. The excellent condition of the paintings is noteworthy; the gorgeous colouring of P. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Verona</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>is nowhere better<br/>
illustrated. Lists of the pictures are placed in the principal rooms<br/>
(except on Sun. and holidays; printed description 50 <span style="color: #0000FF;">o.</span>).<br/>
<br/>
We ascend the Scala <span style="color: #0000FF;">dei </span>Giganti. Around the upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade<br/>
</span>are modern busts of Venetian scholars, <span style="color: #0000FF;">artiste</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dozen</span>, and a<br/>
few antiques from the Archaeological Museum (p. 281; Dionysus<br/>
and a satyr, Apollo resting, two Muses). Tickets of admission are<br/>
sold opposite the staircase (see p. 265). To the right is the richly<br/>
decorated Scale d'Oro of Sansovino, completed in 1577, once<br/>
accessible to those only whose names were entered as'Nobili' in<br/>
the Golden Book. The stucco-work is by Al. Vittoria, the paintings<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">G. </span>B. Franco. By this staircase we ascend on <span style="color: #0000FF;">week-days </span>direct<br/>
to the upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">story</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The next staircase, the Scala <span style="color: #0000FF;">dci </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Consort</span>, is<br/>
the entrance on Sundays and festivals (p. 279).<br/>
