<span>ITALIAN ART. xxxvii<br/>

completed, the aim was obscure, the resources insufficient; <span style="color: #0000FF;">meanwhile </span>architecture alone <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfied </span>artistic requirements, the attempts at painting and sculpture being barbarous in the extreme; these, however, were the germs of the subsequent development of art observable <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>early as the 11th and 12th centuries.<br/>
This has been aptly designated the Romanesque period (<span style="color: #ff0000;">11thi3th </span>cent), and the then prevalent forms of art the <span style="color: #ff0000;">30manesquo </span>Style. As the Romance languages, notwithstanding<br/>
alterations, additions, and corruptions, maintain their <span style="color: #ff0000;">fllial </span>relation to the language of the Romans, so Romanesque art, in<br/>
spite of its rude and barbarous aspect, reveals its immediate<br/>
descent from the art of that people. The Tuscan towns were <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>principal scene of the prosecution of <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>art. There an industrial population gradually arose, treasures of commerce were<br/>
collected, independent views of life were acquired in active party<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conflicts</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftier </span>common interests became interwoven with those<br/>
of private life, and education entered a broader and more enlightened <span style="color: #0000FF;">track</span>; and thus a taste for art also was awakened, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">asthetic </span>perception developed itself. When Italian architecture<br/>
of the Romanesque period is examined, the difference between its<br/>
character and that of contemporaneous northern works is at once<br/>
apparent. In the latter the principal aim is perfection in the<br/>
construction of vaulting. French, English, and German churches<br/>
are unquestionably the more organically conceived, the individual<br/>
parts are more inseparable and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">appropriately </span>arranged. But<br/>
the subordination of all other aims to that of the secure and accurate formation of the vaulting does not admit of an unrestrained<br/>
manifestation of the sense of form. The columns are apt'to be<br/>
heavy, symmetry and harmony in the constituent members to be<br/>
disregarded. On Italian soil new architectural ideas are rarely<br/>
found, constructive boldness not being here the chief object; on the<br/>
other hand, the decorative arrangements are richer and more grateful, the sense of rhythm and symmetry more pronounced. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cathedral </span>of Pisa or the church of San Miniato near Florence, both<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">handed </span>as early as the 11th century, may be taken as an example<br/>
of this. The interior with its rows of columns, the mouldings<br/>
throughout, and the flat ceiling recall the basilica-type; while the<br/>
exterior, especially the facade destitute of tower, with the small<br/>
arcades one above the other, and the variegated colours of the courses<br/>
of stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">present</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>decorative <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. At the same time the construction and decoration of the walls already evince a taste for the<br/>
elegant <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportion</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>which we admire in later Italian structures;<br/>
the formation of the capitals, and the design of the outlines prove<br/>
that the precepts of antiquity were not entirely forgotten. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar </span>conservative spirit pervades the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>architecture of<br/>
Italy<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">artiste </span>do not aim at an unknown and remote object<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the ideal which they have in view, although perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">instinctive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
