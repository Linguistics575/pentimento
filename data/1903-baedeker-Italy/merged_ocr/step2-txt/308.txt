Fonda Toe, situated at the mouth of the impetuous Tosa (Tone).
Farther on we pass the granite-quarries of Monte Orfano (2595 ft.)
and then cross the Toss, by a five-arched bridge, to the railway-station
of Gravellona (p. 182), 6 M. from Pallanza (omnibus, see pp. 177, .183)

A road, diverging to the right from the main road at Fondo Toce, te'
to the small Logo di Mergozzo, originally an arm of the Logo Ma gum,
with which it is now connected only by a narrow channel. From (I ]; M.)
Hergozzo (670 it), on the E. bank, the road ascend: the left bank of the
Tan lo U I MO $ mrserrglin, noted for its extensive quarries of white marble,
and to (712 M.) Cuzzago (p. 182). Milan Cathedral and part of m Carma
di Pavia are built of Candoglia marble.

In the S.W. nook of the bay lies Feriolo, 23/'M. from Gravellona
(p.182; emu. to Stress, see pp. 180,183). The large granite-quarries
extending along the hills between Feriolo and Baveno have for ages
yielded a splendid building material, which has been used for the
columns in the Cathedral of Milan, the church of Sun Paolo fuori le
Mum at Rome, the Galleria Vitt. Emanuele at Milan, and many
other important structures. The quarries are worked mainly by the
Della Casa Company, an English enterprize. - Then

Enemsn Cannon in the garden of the Villa Clara.

Baum; (690 (L), a small place commanding a fine view of the
bay, is situated on alluvial soil at the mouth of a streamlet descending from Monte Mottarone (p. 181). It is frequently chosen for a
stay of some time, especially in the warmer months. The Villa Clara,
on the S. E. side of the village, was occupied by Queen Victoria
for three weeks in April, 1879, and for a month by the invalid
Crown Prince of Germany (Emp. Frederick 111.) in Oct., 1877 (no
admission).

The most beautiful feature in this W. bay of the lake is formed
by the'Borromean Islands, the scenery in the neighbourhood of
which rivals that of the Lake of Como in grandeur and perhaps
surpasses it in softness of character. The westernmost, the Isola
Superiore or dei Pescatori (Trattoria del Verbena, plain), is almost
entirely occupied by a fishing-village (300 inho0, but commands
some picturesque views. The steamers touch here only occasionally,
but In of them call at the--
'Isola Bella (Hotel du Dauphin or Delfino, B. 3, B. 11/4, D. 4,
pane. 7 in), the best known of the four islands, which was formerly
a barren rock with a church and a handful of cottages, until Count
Vitaliano Borromeo (d. 1690) converted it into a summer-residence
