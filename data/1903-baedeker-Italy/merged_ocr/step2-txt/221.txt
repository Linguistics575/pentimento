110 LOMBARDY.

The name of the Germanic tribe that invaded Italy in 568 is now
applied to the country between the Alps and the Po, which is separated
from Piedmont by the Ticino, and from Venetia by the lincio. It is
divided into the eight province: of Coma Hanna, Pavia, Sondn'o, Bergamo, Cremona, Brucm sad unmea, covering an area of about 8000 MI. 1L,
and containing 3,713,300 inhabitants. The name was Once applied to a
much luger tract. Lombardy has not ina tly been likened to an
artichoke, the leaves of which were eaten o in succession by the lords
of Piedmont; thus in 1427 they appropriated Vercelli, in 1531 Anti, M103
VII Beak, in 1706 Alessandria, in 1736 Tortona and Novara, and in 17t3
Domodossola. The heart of the country, if we continue to use the
aimlle, would then be the Dinner or mun, or the tract lying between
the Ticino, Po, and Adda. The three zones of cultivation are the same
as in Piedmont, sit. the region of pastures among the mountains, that
of the vine, fruit-trees, and the silk--culture on the lower undulating
country and the slopes adjoining the Met, and that of wheat, main,
and meadows in the plains, the yield of these last being, however, In
more abundant than in Piedmont. The climate of Lombardy is thoroughly
continental: winter in the plains, which are scourged by bitter winds, is
very cold (minimum at Milan, 1.4" Fahr.) and abounds in snow and mist
(in 1899 at Milan snow occurred on is thy, mist on 501- while in summer
the heat is greater than that of 8. Italy (maximum at hum, 97Â° Fahr.).
In the height of summer rain is rare beyond the lower Alps, and mu
more frequently when the wind is from the E. than from the W., um
moisture of the latter is absorbed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines;
but a thorough system of irrigation, without a parallel in any other part
of Europe, prevails here, so that a failure of the crops is hardly possible. In
the middle ages the importance of Milan was due to its woollen industries,
but sheep-breeding has in modern times been largely superseded by the
silk-culture, an industry which has so materially increased the wealth of
the country, that it used to be said during the Austrian regime that the
army and the others lived on mulberry leaves, as their produce alone
sufficed to pay the land taxes. Under these circumstances the population
is unusually dense, being about 380 persons to the sq. mile, or only a
little less dense than in Liguria end empem't.

The central situation, and the wealth of the country, have ever ten
dated u In the
earliest period known to us it was occupied by the Etruscan, an Italian
race, which about 400 13.0 was subjugated or expelled by Celts from m
W. These immigrants founded Mediatanum (Milan), near the site of the
Etruscan Melpum, destroyed in 396 13.0. True: at their language stil
survive in the modern dialect of the country, as it does in the dialect
of Piedmont and Emilia. It was but slowly that the Italians subdued o
assimilated these foreigners, and it was not till B.C. 222 that the Roman
extended their supremacy to the banks of the Po by their Victory e
Cuatidittm (p. 833). In the following century Gallic: Oisatptna was con
stituted a province, on which Caesar conferred the rights of citizenshi ]
in BAY. .46. Throughout the whole of the imperial epoch these region
of Northern Italy formed the chief buttress of the power of Rome. Won
the Ath cent. on Milan surpassed Rome in extent, and, in many respects
in importance also. It became an imperial residence, and the chum

The Lombard dialect also contains a good many words derived from thl

German Brunnen, Gut, men, P u, Messer, en'sreh, and norm). Th
