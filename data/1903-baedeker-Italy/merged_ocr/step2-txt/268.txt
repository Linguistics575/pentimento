Como (705 no, a flourishing industrial town, the capital of a
province, and the see of a bishop, with 38,174 inh-b. and large silkfaetories and dye-works, lies at the S.W. end of the Lake of Como,
and is enclosed by an amphitheatre of mountains. The small stream
Costa enters the like here. Come is the Roman Comum, the birthplace of the elder and younger Pliny. The electrician and philosopher
mu (1745-1826; whose Statue by P. Marchesi is in the Piazza
Volta, to the S.W. of the quay), was born at Come in the home
marked'Gue Volte' on the Plan.

The Piazza Cavour, a large square near the harbour, and the
new streets skirting the harbour to the E. and W. of it are the most
animated parts of the town. A short street leads to the SE. from
the Piazza Cavour to the Piazza del Duomo. To the left of the
cathedral is the Broletto (now a public office), constructed of alternate courses of black and white stone, and completed in 1215.

The'CAmnm, built entirely of marble, is one of the best
in N. Italy. The nave was rebuilt in the Gothic style about 1396,
the facade in 1457-86 (by Duchino da Milano); and in 1487-1526
the transepts, choir, and exterior of the nave were altered in the
Renaissance style by Tommaso Rodari. The S. portal (1491) is
built in Bramante's style by an unknown architect; the modern
dome is by Fit. Juvara. The greater part of the sumptuous plastic
ornamentation is by Tomm. Rodari and his brother Jacopo. Over
the magnificent W. portal are reliefs (Adoration of the Magi) and
statuettes (Mary with Sant' Abbondio and San Protus etc.); at the
sides are statues of the two Plinys, erected in 149. The overdecorated N. portal (Pom dell. Bun) dates from 1505-9.

In the Via Vittorio Emanuele, which runs S.W. from the cathedral, is the rear of the Romanesque church of San Fedele, with a
fine pentagonal apse. The chief facade of the church, in the Piazza
de Mercato, is as little worthy of attention as the completely modernized interior. - The Palazzo Giovio, on the left, at the end of
