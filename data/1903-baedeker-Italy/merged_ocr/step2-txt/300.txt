Climate. Owing to its sheltered and sunny position on the B. slopes
of a lofty and uninterrupted mountain-chain, Locarno has of me we
become. frequented health-resort, especially for German and wise
visitors. The quarter chiefly selected for this purpose, with most of the
hotels and fine gardens with sub-tropical vegetation, is Mus-alto, situated
immediately beside the lake, to the E. of the Renogna.

Locamo (680 ft.; pop. 3600), suitable for a prolonged stay, is
situated on the N. shore of the lake, at the mouth of the Maggia,
the deposits of which have formed a considerable delta. In the
middle ages Locarno belonged to the bishops of Come and afterwards to Milan. It has been Swiss (Canton Ticino) since 1513,
but the character of the architecture, scenery, and population is
Italian. The expulsion of the Protestants in 1553 arrested the development of the town.

market--place, in which are the former Government Building, end the
Town Hall, - the houses have nude: on the groundfloor. On the W.
side a monument has been erected to the deputy Mordasini (d. 1888).

(restored 1671) commemorates the Marchese Marcacci (d. 1854), a
benefactor of the town. - At the S.W. end of the town is the old
Costello of the Visconti, besieged in vain by 10,000 Swiss in 1502,
partly demolished in 1518, and now occupied as a law-court and
prison. At the neighbouring Stabilimento Rimoldi (p. 172) troutbreeding is carried on.

At Muralto (1500 inhab.) is the old parish-church of San Vittore
(rebuilt in the 2th cent.), with an ancient crypt. On the tower is
a large relief, probably representing St. Victor on horseback.

The pilgrimage-church of l'Madonna del Sasso (1170 ft), on a
wooded eminence above the town, was founded in 1569 and is annually the scene of a festival on 8th Sept., the Nativity of the Virgin.
