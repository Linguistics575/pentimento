Begging (oteattomWitrj, always one of those national nuisances
to which the traveller in Italy must accustom himself, he: recently
somewhat increased, especially in Tuscany, owing partly to growing
poverty, but largely also to the misplaced generosity of travellers.
As the profits of street- beggars too frequently go for the support of
able-bodied loafers, travellers should either give nothing, or restrict
their charity to the obviously infirm. Gratuities to children are
entirely reprehensible. - Importunate beggars should be dismissed
with'niente' or by a gesture of negation.

W. (intuition. Guides.

Gratuities .--The traveller should always be abundantly
supplied with copper and nickel coin in a country where trifling
donations are in constant demand. Drivers, guides, and other persons of the same class invariably eXpect, and often demand as their
right, a gratuity (buona mane, mancia, da here, bottiglia, eafe,
Miro) in addition to the hire agreed on, varying according to circumstances from 2-3 sons to a franc or more. The traveller need have
no sample in limiting his donation: to the smallest possible sums.
The following hints will be found useful by the average tourist. In

per day. The most trustworthy are those attached to the chief
hotels. In some towns the better guides have formed societies as
'Gnide patentate' or'Gnid e autorizzate'.' Their services may generally
well be dispensed with by those who are not pressed for time. Purchases should never be made, nor contracts with vetturini or other
persons drawn up, in presence or with the aid of a commissionnaire,
as any such intervention tends considerably to increase the prices.
