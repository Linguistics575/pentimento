About one-fourth part of the city lies on the left bank.

We cross the Ponte Santa Trinita (P1. D, 5; pp. 445, 506),
adorned with allegorical statues of the seasons, and proceed in a
straight direction to the VIA MAGGIO CPI. C, 5, 6), No. 26 in which
is the house of Bianca Cappello (d. 1587), wife of Grand-Duke
Francis L, and well known for the romantic vicissitudes of her history,

erected in 1566.

The Pat. Rinuccini (Pl. C, 5), in the Via Banto Spirito, the that side
street to the right, contains a collection of Roman inscriptions. In the
Borgo San Jacopo, the first side-street to the left, is the small church of
San Jacopo Bopramo (Pl. D, b), with a Tuscan-Romanesque vestibule of
the 11th cent, brought hither from the convent-church of San Donate in
Scopeto.'

We next follow the second side-street (Via Michelozzi) to the
right and reach the quiet Puzza Burro Srmrro (Pl. 0, 5, 6), which
is laid out in gardens. Immediately to the right is the conventchurch of theV l" Sento Spirito (Pl. o, 5), a basilica in the form of a Latin arm
covered with a dome, and containing 38 chapels. It was begun about
1436, on the site of a Romanesque building from a design by
Filippo Brunclleschi, and was completed in 11182, with numerous
modifications, by Ant. Manetti, Salvi d'Andrea, and others. The
noble proportions of the interior, which is borne by 31 Corinthian
columns and 4 pillars, render it one of the most attractive structures
7 in Florence. The nave has a flat roof, while the aisles are vaulted.
'This church, taking it all in all, is internally as successful an
adaptation of the basilican type as its age presents' (Fergusson). The campanile, erected by Baccio d'Agnolo was restored in 1896.
