Nuovo was prolonged to the SE. by the Mole Duca di Gallium
(about i M. long), and on the E. side a new breakwater, the Main
Giana or Orientals (550 yds. long), was added, creating a new harbor
(Porto Nuovo) and an outer basin (Aoamporto) for war-vessels. A
new outer harbour, the Bacino dei Faro beside the Mole Nuovo, is
expected to be finished about 1905 (comp. the Map, p. 84). The
aggregate water area of these different basins is 555 chee; the
length of the quay: (calate) is 5 M. In 1900 the harbour was entered
and cleared by 13,602 vessels, of which 7292 were steamers. The 3

SAN GIOVANNI (Pl. B, C, 2) towards the S. To the right, at the corner
of the Piazza della Commenda, is the small early-Gothic church of

San Giovanni Battista or dt Ht (13th cent), which originally be F
longed to a lodge of the Knights of St. John. Since a reconstruction
in the 17th cent. the entrance has been at the E. end.

The busy VIA CARLO ALBERTO (Pl. o, D, 2-4), skirting the T
Piazza della Commenda, leads to the W. to the Dogana (Pl. B, 2),

di San Giorgio, erected about 1260, enlarged in the 14th cent. and T
in 1571, and from 1408 to 1797 occupied by the Banca di San Giorgio
(p. 71). It is now being converted into a produce-exchange. The large
hall is embellished with 21 marble statues of men who have deserved
