The steamer now steers obliquely across the lake to Banismette (Stella d'Italia; Pens. Amster), beautifully situated at the
mouth of the picturesque Val Solda, with Candle high above it
(p. 12). Beyond Oria, the station for Albogasio, begins the Swiss
part of the lake. The slopes of the Arte. di Caprino (p. 12), to the
S., are also in Switzerland. On the N. bank the steamer touches at
Gandria (walk to Lugano, see p. IO, with its arcades and its vineterraces, and then turns into the pretty bay of Lugano, leaving

As we leave Lugano, we enjoy a fine retrospect of the town and
Mte. BID. The steamer rounds the promontory of Sun Martino, the
E. spur of Monte San Salvatore, on the right. On some trips the
