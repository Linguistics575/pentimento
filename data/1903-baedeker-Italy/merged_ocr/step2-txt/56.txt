ITALIAN ART. all;

fail to strike the eye. Even the unskilled amateur will thus be
convinced of the abrupt contrast between the mediaeval and the
Renaissance styles. Thus prepared, he may, for example, proceed
to inspect the Pitti Palace at Florence, which, undecorated and
pnorganised as it is, would scarcely be distinguishable from a rude
pile of stones, it a judgment were formed from the mere description.
The artistic charm consists in the simplicity of the proportions,
the justness of proportion in the elevation of the stories, and the
tasteful adjustment of the windows in the vast surface of the facade. That the architects thoroughly understood the aesthetic effect
of symmetrical proportions is proved by the mode of construction adopted in the somewhat more recent Florentine palaces, in
which the roughly hewn blocks (rustica) in the successive stories
recede in gradations, and by their careful experiments as to whether
the comics surmounting the structure should bear reference to the
highest story, or to the entire facade. The same bias manifests
itself in Bramante's imagination; and when, after the example of
Palladio in church-facades, a single series of columns was substituted for those resting above one another, symmetry of proportion
was also the object in view.

From the works of Brunelleschi (p. xlvi), the greatest master of
the Early Renaissance, down to those of Andrea Palladio of Vicenza (p. xlviii), the last great architect of the Renaissance, the works
of all the architects of that period will be found to possess many
features in common. The style of the 15th century may, however,
easily be distinguished from that of the 16th. The Flor- EARL! Rn.
amine Pitti, Riccardi, and Strozzi palaces are still based on MESH"
the type of the mediaeval castle, but other contemporary creations
show a closer affinity to the forms and articulation of antique art.
A taste for beauty of detail, coeval with the realistic tendency of
painting, producesjn the architecture of the 15th century an extensive application of graceful and attractive ornaments, which entirely
cover the surfaces, and throw the real organisation of the edifice into
the background. For a time the true aim of Renaissance art appears
to have been departed from; anxious care is devoted to detail instead
of to general effect; the re-application of columns did not at first
admit of spacious structures; the dome rose but timidly above the
level of the roof. But this attention to minutiae, this disregard of
effect on the part of these architects, was only, as it were, a restraining of their power, in order the more completely to master,
the more grandly to develop the art.

There is no doubt that the Renaissance palaces (among which
that of Urbino, mentioned in vol. ii of this Handbook, has always
been regarded u pze-eminently typical) are more attractive than the
churches. These last, however, though destitute of the venerable
associations connected with the medieval cathedrals, bear ample
testimony to the ability of their builders. The churches ofNorthern
