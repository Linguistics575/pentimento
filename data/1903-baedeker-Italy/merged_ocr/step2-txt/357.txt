Riva (230 ft.), a busy harbour with 3750 inhab., is charmingly
situated at the N.W. end of the lake, here resembling a fjord, at the
base of the precipitous Rocchetta (4976 it). On the hillside, high
above the town, rises the round tower of a ruined castle supposedto
have been built by the Scaligers. Riva is a sheltered and healthy
place, affording pleasant summer-quarters; the heat is tempered
by the lake, and in the afternoon the town lies in the shadow of
the hills. (

The centre of traffic is the piazza at the harbour. The houses
have arcades on the groundfloor. At the E. corner is a massive old (
clock-tower. Farther to the E. lie the small Piazza Giardino and the
barracks of La Roam, surrounded by a most, on the site of a castle
of the Scaligers. To the N. of the Races is the Piazza Brolo, whence l
an avenue of palms and magnolias leads to the E. to the stationfiud
a narrow street to the N., past the Parish Church, to the Corsthviolate, in which is the church of the Inviolata, a late-Renaissance
edifice of the 16th century. Thence the road goes on to Area.

Excursions. The Fall of the Ponale is best visited by motor boat
(8 times daily, in 20 min; 50 h., there and back 1 K.), landing at the
modest restaurant below the fall. The'custode a1 Ponale' exacts 20 h. from
each visitor for opening the shutters in front of the lowest fall, which.
however, is of trifling interest. Visitors should ascend past the Riva
electric works and three other waterfall, to the (20-28 min.'mek Rud
(very dusty in summer), which leads high above the lake, through a sue-t
'cession of tunnel: .mi cuttings, back to (% hr.) Riva. The boat-trip and
the view from the road are the chief attraction on this ex edition.

A road (omnibus 4 times daily) leads from the Porta an Marco towards the N.W. to (s M.) - (ma m, with a fine waterfall in n grad
rocky gorge (adm. and electric light 80 In; cloak desirable on account
the spray). Thence we may proceed either by road to (3 H.) Area (p. 217
or on foot, via Cologne, to (1 hr.) Team (1415 it), with in am mud
destroyed in 1708) and charming view, and through richly cultivated
uplands to Varignano and (11/2 hr.) Area (p. 217).

The Monte Briana, 1 hr., to the E. of Riva, is accessible by the public
and atl'ords an excellent survey of the lake.

The ascent of Monte Baldo (p. 210), noted for its flora, is interesting
and varied, but somewhat fatiguing in winter on account of the snow,
in summer on account of the heat. This range consists of two groups:
separated by the depression of the Becca dt' Nanette (469011.): N. the Alarms
and S. the Monte Mania". with the cam: a Far Dram (7275 n.) and the
Punta dsl Telegrafo (7218 ft.). The Altissimo (8790 ft) is best ascended front
