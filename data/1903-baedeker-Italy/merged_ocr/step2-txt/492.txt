The Emilia includes the former duchies of Puma and Madam, as well
as the papal Romagna, and is now divided into the eight provinces of
Piacensa, Puma, Reggie, Modena, Bologna, Ferrara, Rosanna, and torn,
covering an area of 7920 sq. M., with a population of 2,198,500 souls. The
dialects s ken here form the third main group of the Gallic languages
of Upper taly, and the nasal sound of the vowel: Will at once strike the
traveller as indicating the original affinity of the people with the French.

and subjugated the Etruscans and Umbrians who were settled to the S.
of that river. They chose Bologna for their capital, in the name of which
is still preserved that of the con uerors. The Scum! next invaded Italy,
and took possession of the coast- istrict to the B. of the Bell, extending
nearly to Ancone. It was a horde of these Gauls that destroyed Rome in

c. 359. About a century Inter Imy, united under the guidance of Rome,
began to reconquer the lost territory. In 283 the Senones were exterminated. In 269 a colony was established "Ariminum, which was constituted the strongest frontier-fortress in the peninsula, and connected
with Rome by the Via Flaminia. In 224 the Boii were subjugated, and
in planting the colonies of Placentia end Cremona in 219, Rome extended
her frontier as far as the Po. This process of Latinisation was interrupted
by the invasion of Hannibal, but vigorously resumed after his defeat; and
in 189 Bologna, and in 183 Modena and Parma received Roman colonies.
H. fimmm Lepidm, who was consul in BAY. 187, constructed a military
road from Bimini to Piacenza, via Bologna, Modena, Reggie, and Penna
a distance of 150 M., called the Via Emilia, whence the whole district
derived the ancient name which it still retains. Down to the time of
