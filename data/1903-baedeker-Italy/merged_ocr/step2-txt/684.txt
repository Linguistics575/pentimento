appears here as the heir of Maude, who is by no means well representedin this gallery (Room IV, No. Toy Filippo Lippi'e Coronation of
the Virgin (Room 111, No. 62), with a portrait of himself, belongs to
his later period. In this work the master obviously aims at sensuous
beauty in his female forms; he departs from the strictly ecclesiastical style and borrows various efi'ects from the province of sculpture. WrroeehioU Baptism of Christ (Room IV, No. 71), which,
according to Vasari, was finished by his pupil Leonardo da Vinci,
betrays a certain crudity in the figure of the Baptist, while the
landscape and the two angels distantly recall Leonardo's technical
skill and sense of form. Sandra Botticelli's Spring (Room IV,
No. 80), which transports us to the realm of antique myth, is the
most popular picture in the gallery, owing to its fairy-like charm.
Domenico Ghirlandajo was thoroughly conversant with traditional
forms, and with their aid he has been enabled to produce majestic
and spirited figures, and to unite in them the result of the labour
of two generations. His Madonna and angels (Room 111, No. 66 is
better preserved than the Nativity of Christ (Room WI, N5. 195).
A comparison of Ghirlandajo's simplicity of style, the outcome of
"mature imagination, with the elaborate and exaggerated manner
of many old masters, is most instructive. Lorenzo di Credi's Nativity
(Room V, No. 92) is attractive on account of its beauty of expression
and the careful execution of the landscape. Among Fra Bartolomeo's
pictures, Mary appearing to St. Bernard (Room V, No. 97) is particularly worthy of notice, as it affords an insight into the master's
method of painting. Mariotto Albertinelli, who is closely allied to
Fra Bartolomeo, is well represented by a Trinity (Boom m, No. 63);
his Annunciation (Room VII, No. 169) is no longer in its original
condition.

This gallery is important also to the student of Umbrian art in
the 16th century. It possesses one of the chief works of Gentile da
Fabriano, an Umbrian master, closely allied to Fra Angelica in his
modes of thought (Adoration of the Magi; Room XVI, No. 165). This
work affords distinct evidence of the unity of sentiment which
existed between the Schools of the North and South in the 15th cent.,
notwithstanding their external independence. Perugino'a pictures
are greatly above the average merit of his works: in his Pieta
(Room 111, No. 56) an admirable individuality of character is exhibited; his skill as a colourist is shown in his Mount of Olives
(53); and his Assumption (57), admirable both in composition
and execution, reveals him at the zenith of his power.

From the VESTIBULR (Room I), in which is the ticket--office, we
proceed straight on to Room 11, the first portion of which is hung
with fine Flanders tapestry (scenes from the Creation), in the style
of Barend van Orley (d. 1541).

Beneath the cupola at the other end of the room stands the
