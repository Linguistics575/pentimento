268 Route 12. VENICE. History of Art.

xcuy.yn3poinc of size the early-Renaissance buildings in Venice cannot
compare with those of Tuscany, but they are more richly decorated, and
retain the articulation peculiar to the earliest period. At a later period
Venetian architecture may justly boast of holding out against the rococo
style longer than Central Italy. Chief among Venetian architects were
several of the Lombardi family (immigrants from Carona, on the Lago di
Lugano), Moro Caducci (d. 1504) Jacopo Bansooino of Florence (1486-1570;
see below), Giovanni da Pants (1512-97), and lastly Andrea Panama of Vicenea
(151380; p. w Â», who inaugurated a new era, especially in church-archi' tecture, by limiting the facade to a single range of massive columns.

Palladio's chief successors were Vinceneo Seaman" 552-1616) end of SCULPTURE the 14th
cent. two important masters in the brothers Managua, who had probably
studied in the school of the Ban" (on. 1345-75). In the 15th cent. the
growing taste for monumental tombs gave abundant employment to the
sculptors, and led to the execution of those magnificent monuments which
still fill the churches of Venice. The lumen of the Bison, of Antonio Rina
of Verona (c. 1430-ca. 1498), of the Lombardi (see above), and of Alessandro
Leopardi (d. 1522) who had formed himself by the study of Greek scalp 7
tures, are the most important. After um Jame Sanmvino, sculptor and.
architect, was the leading master. His works, though often designed for:
pictorial tstreet, are more pleasing than those of Michael Angelou school.'
His pupils were Girolamo Campagna (1552-1823) and Alessandro Vittoria
(1525-1608). _

VENETIAN PAINTING did not begin to attract universal attention till
the beginning of the 16th cent. (comp. p. 11:). In the 14th cent. it was
far inferior to that of other Italian schools, and though Giotto was en- 3
gaged in the neighbouring town of Padua, it remained unaffected by his 3
influence. In 1365 Guariento of Padua, and in 1419 the Umbrian Gentile do 1
Fabriano and Vino" Picasso of Verona, were invited to Venice to decorate
the doges' palace. In the Ilia cent. the most noted masters were Giovanni
(also named Aluminum), Antonio, Bartolomeo, and Aloha (W) Vicariai, j
known he the Karma". Antonella da
Messina introduced painting in oils into Venice about 1473, and the new
method contributed powerfully to the development of the first surely
Venetian artists in Gentile (1427-1507) and Giovanni Bellini (1428-151), the
sons of JacOpo. Giovanni Bellini, who had many pupils, is with "mug!"
the most important master of the early Renaissance in N. Italy. Alike in
composition (as in the'santa conversazione', a peaceful, yet expressive
group of saints with the Madonna), in his love of colour and appreciation
of landscape, and in his conception of female figures, he may be regarded
as the precursor of the glorious prime of Venetian painting. Among his
contemporaries were Vittore Carpaccio (d. 1520), a live I pictorial narrator,
and Marco Band" (d. 1521), while to his school belongs Oima da mum
(14594517), Vincenzo Carina, Andrea Emu, Niccolo Roudinelli, and others.

The first of the rest masters of the late Renaissance was Giorgione
(Barbarelli, 1477? -151), but unfortunately only the altar-piece at Caste! franco (p. 257) is thoroughly authenticated as his work; though at Venice
the'Famiglia di Giorgione' in the Pal. Giovanelli (p. 800) and an Apollo
and Daphne in the Seminario Patriarcale (p. 317) are ascribed to him.
The peculiar glow of his colouring, an attribute which seems natural
rather than acquired, imparts even to his isolated half-figures unwanted
life and poetical charm. The first artist who fully developed that type of
female beauty in which simple enjo ent of life is so admirably expressed was Jacopo Palma (Vecchio, 1 4528) of Bergamo. The olden
hair of his sitters recalls the fashionable practice of the period of yeing
the hair a light colour. Surpassing all his fellows in celebrity, in fertility,
and in the length of his career, next comes the great Tmuo Vncnu
tiWT-ily76). Frescoes by him may be seen in the Scuola del Santa and
Scuola del Carmine at Padua and in the Doges' Palace at Venice; and
