The CLorsms, immediately adjoining the church, with double V
arcades attributed to anelleschi, form a striking reminiscence of the
great period of the Medici. Immediately to the right is a statue of
Paolo Giovio (1483-1655), the historian, by Francesco da Bangallo
(1560). w

A staircase, beginning in the passage to the right of the entrance
to the church, ascends to the upper story of the cloisters and to the
Biblicteca Laurenaiana (Pl. E, F, 4; adm., see p. 437; gratuities
forbidden), a library founded by Cosimo the Elder in 1444, and
gradually enlarged by the Medici. Its chief treasure consists of
about 10,000 MSS. of Greek and Latin classical authors, many of
which are extremely valuable. The building was begun in 1523-6
from the design of Michael Angelo, the portico was built by him
(very effective in spite of several eccentricities, such as the columns
inserted in the walls, with massive value: below), and the staircase
gwhich was also designed by Michael Angelo) was completed in

568-71 by Vasari; the rotunda containing the Bibi. Deletem, was
. erected in 1841, from Poccianti's design.

The wooden ceiling of the Library was executed by G. B. del Tauo and
Garcia, from Michael Angelou designs (after 1629?). The last also furnished the design for the 88'plutei' to which the M88. are attached. Among
these are a number of codices of rare value: Virgil of the Ath or 5th cent;
Pliny of the 10th or 11th cent. gram the Ashburnham Collection); Tacitus, two 1188. of the 10th and 11th cent. the older brought from Germany and the sole copy containing the Am the books of the Annals.

MADONNA (Pl. E, 3; adm, see p. MO, at the back of the church.

chapel of the grand-dukes of the Medici family, was constructed after
