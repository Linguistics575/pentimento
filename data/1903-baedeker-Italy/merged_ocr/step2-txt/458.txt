the Northern Quarters. VENICE. Route. 42. 301

We now return to the Rio San Felice and turn to the SE. into
the Rio di S. Caterina. The high-altar-piece of the church of SANTA
Carma here (PLG, 3; it closed, entrance to the right, through the
Lyceum, Convitto Nazionale), is a "Marriage of St. Catharine, by
Paolo Verona", a masterpiece and in admirable preservation. At
the end of the right aisle is a Tobias with the angel, by Grade Vecelli.

We proceed to the E. to the Ponte dei Gesuiti, and turning to
the left reach the church of
'Santa. Maria dei Gesuiti (P1. G, H, 3), usually known as
'I Gewiti', erected in 1715-30 in the baroque style by Dom. Rossi
[ facade by thoo. Fattoretto). The interior is entirely lined with
i marble inlaid with verde antico, and sumptuously decorated like all
the churches of this order.

At the HIGH ALTAB (by Gim. Palm) are ten spiral columns of verde
antico; in the centre, a globe, with God the Father and the Son. The
chapel to the right of the high-altar contains the monument of Orazio
Farnese (d. 1854); in the chapel on the left is the Monument of Dogs
Pasquale Cicogne til. 1595), with the recumbent'Statue of the deceased,
by th Campagna; adjacent, in the Sherman, over the door, Presentation
in the Temple, by Tintoretto. Then, in the Len Tnenenr'r, the Assumption,
an altar-piece by Tintoretto. In the 1st chapel on the left of the principal
door is the Martyrdom'of St. Lawrence, one of the finest of the altarpieces by Titian (1558), who'never made a nearer approach to the grand
art of the Florentines than when he painted this piece, in which he
applied the principle of dramatic execution peculiar to Michaelangelo'.
Unfortunately it is darkened by age (seen best about noon).

We may return from this point either along the Fondamenta
Nuou (Pl. G, 2; view of San Michele and Murano }, or past Santi
Giovanni c Paolo to the Riva dcgli Schiavoni (comp. pp. 303-306),
or we may combine this trip with an excursion to Murano (steam
boat, see p. 319).

L From the Piazza of "Mark to Santi Giovanni e Paolo, and
thence to the Rive degli Schiavoni. Eastern Quarters.

From the Piazzetta dei Leoni (p. 274), on the N. side of St. Mark's,
we turn to the E. by the Gene di Canonica, pass round the Pal. Patrirrca le (p. 274) on the right, and observe opposite us the Pal. Trevisani
, Pl. H, 5), or Bianca Cappello, built in the style of the Lombardi
shout 1500, and now occupied by the Camera di Commercio ed Am,
I Chamber of Commerce. .We cross the Bio dl Palms Citrus view
mm the Ponte di Canonica of the back of the Palace of the Doges
.nd of the Bridge of Sights; comp. p. 282), proceed across the
lampo Sent-i Filippo e Giacomo and beyond the second canal reach
he Campo di San Provolo. Thence we pass through a portal with
he inscription'Campo S. Zaccaria', over which there is a fine relief,.
u the style of the Managua, of the Madonna between John the
laptist and St. Mark. This leads to the Campo and church of
*San Zaccaria (Pl. H, I, 5), erected in 1458-1515 in the transi.on style between Gothic and Renaissance, partly by Ant. Gambello
