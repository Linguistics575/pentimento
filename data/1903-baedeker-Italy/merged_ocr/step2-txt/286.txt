The ma. of Lugano (870 m), called by the Italians Lago
Ceresio after its doubtful Latin name, is 20 sq. M. in area and 945 ft.
deep at its deepest point. Its wooded and oft-times precipitous
banks are less varied and more sombre than those of Lakes Come
and Maggiore, but its central part, the *Bay of Lugano, vies in
scenic charm and luxuriance of vegetation with its more celebrated
neighbours. - The steamer proceeds via Cima (not called'at by
express steamers), at the foot of the steep hills on the N. bank, and
crosses the lake diagonally.

0istiino (Hotel du Bateau; Ristorante delta Gratin }, on the wooded
S. bank of the lake, was the birthplace in 1506 of the sculptor Andrea Bregno, who is represented by two ciboria in the church. It
is frequently visited from Lugano on account of its grotto (returnrare 2 fr. 35 0.; ticket for the grotto, including the ferry, obtained

on board the steamer, 75 c.).

The Grotto of Osteno, Ital. Orr'ido or Pescara ('fishermen's gorge')
ii Osteno, is 7min. from the landing-place. The ferryman guides visitors
hrough the village and down to the right before the stone bridge, to a small
Dot-bridge over the brook. The mouth of the gorge, in which there is a
mall waterfall. is near a projecting rock (restaurant). Visitors embark in
small boat and enter the grotto, the bottom of which is occupied by the
look. The narrow ravine through which we thread our way is curiously
renewed out by the water. Far above, the roof is formed by overhanging
ashes, between which glimpses of blue sky are obtained. The gorge is
trininated by a waterfall. - The Tufa Grottoes of Benin may A190 he
