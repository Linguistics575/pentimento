It is a common error on the part of those who visit Italy for the
first time to believe that beyond the Alps the skies are always blue
and the breezes always balmy. It is.true that the traveller who
has crossed the Spliigen, the Brenner, or the M. Gotthard in winter,
and finds himself in the district of the N. Italian lakes, cannot fail
ta remark what an admirable barrier against the wind is "ordeal
by the central chain of the Alps. The average winter-temperature
(December. January. and February) here is 37-40째 Fahr. as compared
with 28-320 on the N. side of the mountains. Places nestling close
to the S. base of the Alps, such as Locamo (winter-temperature
37째 Fahr.), Panama (38.50), Area (38.75째), and Gardens--Riviera
(40째), thus form an excellent intermediate stage between the bleak
winter an. Europe and the semi--tropical climate of the Riviera or S.
Italy. A peculiarity of the climate here is worded try the torrents of
rain which may be expected about the equinoctial period. The masses
of warm and moisture-laden clouds driven northwards by the S. wind
break against the Alpine chain, and discharge themselves in heavy
showers, which fill the rivers and occasion the inundations from
which Lombardy not unfrequently suflors. If, however, the traveller continues his journey towards the S. through the plain of Lombardy he again enters a colder and windy region. The whole plain
of the Po, enclosed by snow-capped mountains, exhibits a climate
of a thoroughly continental character; the summer is as hot as that
of Sicily, while the winter is very cold, the mean temperature
being below NP Fuhr. or about equal to that of the lower Rhine.
In Milan the thermometer sometimes sinks below zero. Changes
of weather, dependent upon the direction of the wind, are fre
