placed over the door in 1529 ('Jesus Christus Rex Florentini populi
s. p. decreto electus') was altered by Cosimo I. to'Rex regum et
Dominus dominantium'. To the left of the entrance is a tablet
showing the result of the plebiscite of 1860. From 1504 down to
1873 the famous statue of David by Michael Angelo, which is now
in the Academy (p. 493), stood here. On the right is a group of
Hercules and Cacus by Michael Angelo's rival Baccio Bandimlli,
who hoped to excel the great master in this work o. IV). The two
insignificant statues by Bandinclli and Rossi on each side of the
entrance were used as chain-posts.
The outer Coma was renewed by Michelosso in the Renaissance style
in 1454. The elaborate decorations of the columns, the grotesque: on the
ceiling, and the faded views of Austrian towns were added by Marco a
Fame in 1565, in honour of the marriage of Francesco (afterwards GrandDuke) to Johanna of Austria. In the centre, above a large basin of porphyry

was occupied as puarters for the Swish troops in 1512, and reconstructed
by Vasart in 156 et seq. In 1569 Cosimo I. here assumed the dignity of
grand-duke, and in 1860-69 the hall was used for the sittings of the Italian
Parliament. In 1503 Leonardo da Wart and Michael Angelo were con: missioned to decorate the hall with frescoes from Florentine history.
Leonardo executed a cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari (defeat of the
Milanese in 1440), and Michael Angelo designed hie'Bething Bowers'

Both cartoons have perished (Michael Angelo's torn up by Baccio Bandinelli
in 1512), as well as the small portion from Do. Vinci's transferred in fresco
to the walls (Battle for the standard). The hall is now adorned with
frescoes (on the wall! and cassetted ceiling) by Vasari and his pupils
