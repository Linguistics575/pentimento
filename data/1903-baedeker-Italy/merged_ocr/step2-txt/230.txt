and this only after protracted struggles with the Lombard masters, who
clung obstinately to the pointed arch. Their influence, along with traces
of that of N. art, is mirrored in the Lombardic school of sculpture, which
grew up about 1460 and gradually extended its activity to Venue, Genoa,
and even is. Italy. Its principal mum the brothers Antonio and Cristoforo
HantEgazza, am. Radar-i, may best be studied in the Gertosa in Pavia, the Cappella
Colleoni in Bergamo, and the Cathedral of Como. The decline of the style
is shown in the late works of Agostino Bum, surnamed Bambaja (ca. 111805 A more serious and realistic conception is revealed by the versatile
Crawforo Poppa, surnamed Caradosso (ca. 1445-1527), who is also famous
as a medal-engraver and goldsmith .--The ehrlier painters of this eriod,
such as Vincents Foppa (d. 492), who seems to have been trained in adua,

Milanese art reached the zenith of its reputation as the residence of
Bramante (1472--1500), to whom are due the choir and dome of Santa Maria
done _ and the baptistery of San Satiro, and of Leonardo da Vinci
(1 & 85-1500 and 1506-16). The latter here executed his masterpieces: the
Last Supper and the clay model of the equestrian monument of Francesco
Sforza, destroyed by the French in 1499. Among the pupils of Leonardo
were the painters Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, Marco d'Oggiono, Andrea
W, Cesare da Basic, and aianptelrino; and his influence is also manifest in the works of Bernardino mm, Andrea 5mm, Gaudensio Ferrari,
and Gian Ant. Bani fir 8deamal.

We recognize Bramante's style in many buildings of Lombardy, such

In recent times Milan has raised itself to the highest artistic rank in
the kingdom. Sculpture is here carried on to such an extent as to have
become almost a special industry. The Milanese Sconrrons take great

The focus of the commercial and public life of Milan is the
