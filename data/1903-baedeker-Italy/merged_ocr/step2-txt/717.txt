(9.) MONTE OLIVBTO AND Bannoseuanno. About 1/3 M. beyond
the Ports San Frediano (PL B, t; omnibus, p. 434) the'Via di
Monte Oliveto' diverges to the left from the Empoli and Pisa road,
and reaches the (1/2 M.) entrance to the garden of the Badia di Ban
Bartolomeo di Monte Oliveto (270 ft.) founded in 1334 (key next

possesses frescoes by Poccetti. In the priest's house are the remains
of a fresco of the Last Supper by Sodoma.

at the Piazza degli Zuevi (Pi. A, B, 1, 2), and is about 2 M. in
length, but of moderate breadth, being bounded by the Ame and
the Mugnone (p. 526). It affords delightful and refreshing walks
to the traveller fatigued with sight-seeing; in the more distant
parts it is covered with woods. The name is derived from a farm to
which it once belonged (canning - dairy). In the proper season it
is a fashionable rendezvous in the late afternoon, particularly for
driving. - Outside the town, immediately to the left, is a smell
Café Restaurant. - About the middle of the Caseine is a large open
space, the Piazzale del Re (where a military band plays on Sun. and
festivals in summer), with the Casino delle Cascine, a frequented
cafe-restaurant. Beyond this spot the park is comparatively deserted,
and it terminates about 1 M. farther on at the monument of the
Rajah of Holapore, who died at Florence in 1870, and whose body
was burnt at this spot. Fine view of the W. environs of Florence,
