Genoa, Italian Gen'dva, French Game, with 219,500 inhab., the
seat of a university and of an archbishop, and the headquarters of
the 4th Italian army corps, is a strong fortress and the chief commercial town in Italy. Its situation, rising above the see in a wide
semicircle, and its numerous palaces justly entitle it to the epithet
of'La Superba'. The old town is a net-work of narrow and steep
streets, lined with many-storied buildings, but the newer quarters
have broad and straight thoroughfares. Since the 17th cent. Genoa
has been protected on the landward side by a rampart, over 9 M.
long, which extends from the large lighthouse on the W. side (p. 82),
where the barracks of San Benigno afford quarters for 10,000 men,
past the Forte Begato (1620 ft.), to the Forte delto Sperone (1690 IL);
then descends past Forte Castelluccio (1250 ft.; view) into the valley
of the Bisagno, on the E. The heights around the town are crowned
with ten detached forts.

The beauty of its situation and the reminiscences of its ancient
glory render a visit to Genoa very attractive. Invalids, however,
must be on their guard in winter against the raw winds and the
abrupt changes of temperature.'

From the earliest times Genoa hue been famous as a seaport, and it
is believed to derive its name from the fact that the shape of the was
here resembles that of a knee (mu). The Roman form'of its municipa
government was maintained throughout the period of the barbarian ini
vasions, when a Frankish feudal nobility sprang up alongside of the nativc
noblesse. The smaller towns on the Ligurian coast looked up to Genet
as their champion against the Saracens, who ravaged the countr iron
Frassineto (Fraxinet), and in 936 even plundered Genoa itself. In 1199
the Genoese waged war with varying success against Pisa, which threatene'
its maritime commerce from the settlements on Corsica and Sardinia. I:
the following century the rival cities were almost permanently at wa
down to 1284, when the power of Pisa was shattered for ever in th
terrible naval battle at Meloria (p. 405). At a still earlier period 61311.05
had participated in the Crusades, and secured to herself a busy trade Wit:
the event She also possessed settlements at Constantinople, in Syn
and Cyprus, at Tunis and Majorca. The consequent rivalry of the Genoes
and Venetian: was a fruitful source of wars and feuds, which were DC
ended until the defeat of Genoa at the battle of Chioggia in 1380.
