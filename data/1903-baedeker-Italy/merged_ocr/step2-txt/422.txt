craft with 17,000 men, and a fleet of 45 galleys carrying 11,003 men who
maintained the naval supremacy of the Republic. But in the middle of
the 15th cent. an evil omen occurred: Constantinople was captured by the
Turks in 1453, and the supremacy of Venice in the East was thus undermined. The crowning blow, however, was the discovery of the new "the close of the century, by which in commerce was
diverted to the Portuguese. Yet'the arts, which had meanwhile been
silently developing, shed a glorious meet over the waning glory of the
mighty Republic'.

The opening of the 16th cent. brought new losses. In was Venice I
signed a humiliating peace with .net IL, to whom the ceded the whole
of the Morel. The League of Cam mi, formed by the Pope, the Emperor,
and the Khan of France and Aragon against Venice in 1508, and the victory
of the French at Agnadello in 1509 occasioned serious losses to the Re ublic.
The were between Emp. Charles V. and Francis I. of France (1521- J were
also prejudicial to Venice, but her power was most seriously impaired by
her continuous struggle against the Demure, In 1540 she lost Nauplia, the
laund- of Chios, Peron, and others, and in 1571 Cyprus also, notwithstanding its brave defence by Bragadino. In the naval battle of Le Auto
an Oct. 1571) the Venetian fleet distinguished itself greatly. In 16 the
island 01 Candia was conquered by the Tum. The Venetians, however,
under Francesco Horosini'Pslopommtacmv and Konigsmarck, were victorious in the Morea in 1, and conquered Caron, Patras, Corinth, and
Athens; in 1696 and 1698 the again defeated the Turkish fleets and by
the Peace of Carlowitz in 17 they regained the Morel; but the Turks
reconquered the peninsula in 1715, and in 1718 were confirmed in their
possession by the Peace of Passarowitz.

From this period Venice ceases to occupy a prominent position in
history. She retained her N. Italian possessions only, remained neutral
in every war, and continued to decline in power. On the outbreak of the
French Revolution Venice at first stoutly Opposed the new principles; on
the victorious advance of the French she endeavoured to preserve her
neutrality, and repeatedly rejected Bonap-arte's proposals of alliance.
Irritated by this opposition he broke off his negotiation and took possession
of the city on 16th May, 1797, and the last (th (1788-97),
abdicated. By the Peace of Campo Formio (1 97) Venetia was assigned to
Austria, by that of Pressburg (1805) to the kingdom of Italy and in 1814
to Austria. At length in 1848 Venice declared herself 1 Republic under the
presidency of Daniele Hunt"; but after a siege of 15 months she was taken
by Radetsby in Aug., 1849. Lastly, the war of 1806 led to the union of
Venetia with the kingdom of Italy. See H. F. Brown's'History of Venice',
mentioned at p. 269.

In the History of Art Venice has shown herself "independent of
the mainland as in situation and political history. The surprise of the
traveller who behold: Venice for the first time, even after having seen
the rest of Italy, will also be felt by those who study her art. The earliest
monument" of Venice at once betray the fact that her greatness was
founded on her Oriental commerce. The church of St. Mark is in the
BIzAN'rnu style, the oldest mosaics bear a Byzantine impress and the
same type is observable in other branches of art. The Palazzi Farsetti,
Loredan and Done and the Fondue dei Turchi are Romanesque. Even
during the period 011 Go'rmc ART the Venetians differed in their style from
the rest of Italy. In ecclesiastical architecture these dlfrerenees were comparatively slight, but the Venetian palaces, which, as generally in Up er
Italy, are the chief Gothic buildings, possess a more marked individual ty,
and foremost among them is that of the Day". They possess a large
entrance-colonnade; a loggia (portage) on the upper floor, with windows
close together in the middle - wings, treated chiefly as surfaces for painting;
and everywhere a wealth oi decoration and colour. Such are the ca Dam,
the Palazzo Foscari, and many others on the Canal Grande. Still more
zealously did the Venetians cultivate the RENAISSANCE Anem'rnc'runa,
naturalised at the end of the 15th cent, much later than in the rest of
