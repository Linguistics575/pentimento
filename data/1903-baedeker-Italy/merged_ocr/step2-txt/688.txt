' and Via Cavour. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 497

who Ohinltro dollo louse (Pl. G, 2), an elegant court of the earlyL"

t Renaissance, surrounded with colonnades and adorned with admirable'Frescoes in two shades of brown from the history of John the Baptist, with allegorical figures and rich ornamentation, by
Andrea dcl Sarto and Franciabigio (ca. 1514-26). Adm., see p. 437.

. mu; to Zacharias (15 p, 3. Via tation (, with the noble figure of Zacharias writing); 5. Departure of John
from his father's house, and 6. His meeting with Christ (these two by
Franctabtato, 1618-19). - T. Baptism of Christ (the earliest and weakest

' of all, perhaps painted by the two artiste in common, 1514?) 8. Allegorical

the influence of mar: Dam. For example, in the Sermon of John, the
Pharisee in the long robe and the woman with the child are borrowed
from the engravings of the German master.

Proceeding farther to the N.E., we traverse the Via San Gallo, No. "in which, a corner
house, is the'Palasso Nencini, formerly the Palazzo Pandolflni
(P1. G, B, 2), erected in 1516-20 by Giov. Franc. da Sangallo, from

.the designs of Raphael.

A little to the N.W. of the Piazza Sun Marco, at Trie Venttlette
Aprils A, is the little Conacolo di Bant' Apollonia (PL ll, 3), the
refectory of a monastery of that name (founded in 1339), now used
as a military now. Since 1890 the Cenacolo has contained a small
picture-gallery (edme, see p. 437).

In the Aura-Boon are paintings of the 15th cent, chiefly from the studio
of Dom. Ghirlandqio. - The MAIN ROOM contains several works by Andrea
idel Castagno. On three of the walls are frescoes (about 1435?) transferred
to canvas and partly retouched (previously in the Villa Pandolflni at
Legnaja), of nine portrait-figures: Filippo Scolari, surnamed Pippo 8 arm,
o.'he"'atr, tl', or supreme count of Temesvar, the conqueror o the
Turks; "nate de 11 Uberti, leader of the Ghibellines; Nic. Acciaduoli,
mentioned on p. b g the Cumin Sibyl; Tomyris; Dante; Petrarch;
and Boccaccio. On the wall to the right is an admirably preserved
'Fresco of the Last Supper, with figures charged with life (a late work
of the master; on. 1450?): above, the Crucifixion, with the Entombment
on the right and the Resurrection (beardless Christ) on the left.

The Via Ventisette Aprils ends on the N. W. at the large Piazza
dell' Indipendenza (Pl. F, 2; omn., see p. 434), which is embellished with bronze statues of the statesmen Bettina Ricasoli
(1809-80), by Augusto Rivalta, and Ubaldino Pmmu' (1822-91;
Sindaco of Florence from 1864 to 1878), by R. Romanelli, both
erected in 1897.

The Via delle Fortezza leads hence to the Viale Filippo Strozzi
(electric tramway No. I, p. 434), and to the Fortezza San Giovanni
Battista, now the Furlong: da Basso (Pl. E, F, 1), built by Duke
Alexander in 1634-35 to overawe the city. - From the E. side of
the fort pleasant public gardens extend as far as the picturesque
Via Lungo il Magnum (Pl. F, H, 1).
