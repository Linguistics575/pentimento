The'St. Gotthard Railway was constructed in 1872-82, at a total cost
of 271 million francs. Its highest point is in the middle of the great tunnel
and is 3787 ft. above the level of the sea. The inclines (maximum gradient
26:100) have partly been surmounted by large spiral tunnels, of which
there are three on the N. side of the St. Gotthard and four on the 8. In
all the railway has 80 tunnels (with an aggregate length of 29 111.), 83 large
bridges, 32 minor bridges, and It viaducts. The great tunnel alone cost
nearly 57 million francs. Lam": Faun, the engineer, died of apoplexy in

Lucerne (1437 K), the capital of the canton of that name, is
beautifully situated at the efflux of the Reuse from the Lake of
Luceme. The best view is obtained from the G & tsch (1722 ft.), at
the N.W.' end of the town, 1/2 M. from the station (wire-rope railway). The celebrated Lion of Lucerne, designed by Thorvaldsen,
lies 1/4 M. to the N. of the Schweizerhof-Quai. For details, see
