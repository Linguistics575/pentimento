San Petronio were executed by Jacopo delta Quanta (1874-1438) of Stem,
one of the founder: of Renaissance sculpture. A litle later the most prominent sculptors were Southern mum: Niccolo den" Area (d. 1494), of Bari,
Ind "Mm Ono. Mae! Amt" Worked here more than once. In 1494,
when a fugitive from Florence shortly before the banishment of the Medici,
he found occupation in the church of S. Domenico; and in 15068 he
executed the bronze statue of Pope Julius II. for the facade of S. Petronio
(p. 369). Of the other Renaissance masters, who are well represented at
Bologna, Alfonso Lombardi, or properly Oittadeua of Luce: he was the son of a native of Lucca who emigrated
to Ferrara in 1496. Bologna was also the birthplace of Propertia de'Rout
(1490-1630), one of the few women who have devoted themselves to sculpture.

In the province of Pumas we are struck by Bologna" close connection with the School of Ferrara, due robably to the dearth of important native masters (comp. p. 356). The rat Bolognese master who attained
more than a local reputation was Francesco Francia (1450-1617), the goldsmith, who owed much to Lorenzo Costa of Ferrara. In the devotion and.
gracefulness of his female figures he almost rivals Perugino, as well as in
his portraits. French, like Costa, must be judged by his easel-paintings
(in 9. Giacomo Maggiore, 8. Giovanni in Monte, Pinacoteca), not by his
Imam, in which both are far inferior to their Florentine contemporaries.
Timma mi, a upil of Francis, is mentioned at Urbino as Raphael's
first master. W th Francesco's sen Giacomo Francia, for a time influenced
by the Venetian school, begins a period of decline, which was not arrested

[ he mannerism into which Italian painting had gradually lapsed was
waisted by the 1ilcrprpTrpts, whose style was mainly introduced by Latam vanam (1555-1919). In teaching at his academy he inculcated a
thorough mastery of the elements of art, a comprehensive education, and
l careful study of the great masters. The school was afterwards carried
in by his cousins Agostino (15581601) and Armibalc Oarracci (1560-1809),

1571mm, Memo (p. 954), and Franc. Album (1578-1660), who exercised a
{ feat influence on Italian art in the 17th cent., and effected a temporary reviral of good taste. They afterwards came into collision with the naturalists,
: hieily at Rome and Naples, but At Beluga: their sway was undisputed.
