circumference, stand on 117 small islands, formed by more than
150 canals, and connected by 378 bridges, most of which are of
stone. The canal: (rio, generally passable by small beet! only,
sometimes lap the very wall: of the houses and are sometimes
separated from them by narrow paths. Among these houses extent:
a labyrinth of lanes, paved with stone, brick, or asphalt, and alive
with picturesque and busy throngs. The population, which had
dwindled from 200,000 to 96,000 after its dissolution as an independent state (1797), is now about 148,500. The rate of mortality is about 21 or 22 per 1000 per annum. The industry of Venice is
practically confined to ship-building, the making of cotton and torpedoes,: ml the flourishing production of art-objects (p. 263) for I
its enormous annual invasion of strangers. Its trade, almost entirely 1
of goods in transit, ha: somewhat improved within the last few
decades. The harbour consists of the Bacino (or Candle) di San
Marco (38 ft. deep) and the new Bacino delta Stations Marittima,,
at the W. and of the Giudecca Canal, connected by rails with the
railway-station. 1

From the mouth of the the and Cortellazzo on the N. to Brondolo on the S. the Lagoons are protected from the open sea by long
sand-hills (tidi), strengthened at their narrowest parts with bulwarks 1
(murazzi) of masonry (Istrian marble), 30 ft. in height and 40-50 it.
in width. 0n the side next the Lagoon: the Munzzi ue perpendicular, while towards the see they descend in four terraces, of l
which the highest is broad enough to permit of two persons walking
abreast. The murazzi on the tidi of Pellestrina'and Sottomarina'
(p. 322) date from the last period of the Republic (1774-81). The I
Diga of Malamocco, a pier 11/4 M. long, extending into the open
sea, was constructed by the Austrian government, after 1825, to
protect Venice from the encroachment: of the sea. A new mole, the
Diga Nord Est, 41/2 M. long, on the NE. side of the Lido, was completed in 1894. The Lagoons are connected with the open sea by
four entrances: Porto dei We Porti, Porto di Lido, Porto di Malamocco, Porto di Chioggia. Of these the second and third are alone
available for large vessels.

The Lagoons consist of the'laguna viva', and the'laguna morta',
which are of about equal extent. In the former the tide rises and
falls about 21/2 ft.; the latter, near the coast of the mainland, is a
malarious and shallow swamp, now unaffected by the tide. Venice
is situated in the'laguna viva', here about ti M. in width. At high
water innumerable stakes ('pali'), rising from the water, mark the
navigable channels which surround the city, forming a complicated
network. When the wind blows strongly, the surface of the Lagoons
is often agitated enough to cause sea-sickness. In winter springtides (alto. man-ca), accompanied by a continuous east wind, sometimes
raise the level of the water about 8 ft., to that even the Piazza di
San Marco is flooded and has to be traversed by gondola.
