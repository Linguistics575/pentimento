266 Route 42. VENICE. History.

The Carnival, which formerly presented 3 - and lighter scene at
Venice than in any other city of Italy, has of late entirely lost its significance .--- The city authorities sometimes give Serum, i.e. concerts with
illumination on the Canal Grands .--- The Regatta: held periodically on
the Grand Canal are characteristic and interesting. The course is from
the Public Gardens to the Railway Station and back to the Pat Found.
--The Meta del Mentors (second Sun. in July) is also interesting.



History. For the early history of Venice, see p. 220. The foundation
of the Eastern supremacy of Venice was laid by Dogs Enrico pmw
(1192-1205), who conquered Constantinople in 1204. In consequence of this

upub), which consisted of all members of the Nomi above twenty. The
executive was vested in B Dogs, or Duke, and six counselldrs, with
whom was associated the Council of the Pregadi. The Pregadi were afterwards united with the higher officials to form the Senate. The duty of
the Asoogadori di Commas was to see that the public officials governed
constitutionally. After the conspiracy of Bajamonte mpoto (o) the
chief power was vested in the Council of Ten (Consiglio dei Disc-i), elected
yearly by the Maggior Consiglio; and this tribunal, from which the State
Inquisition was developed in the 18th cent, controlled, in conjunction
with the doge and his councillors every department of government.

conflict, losing many of her conquests in the East; but the Genoese were

at length totally defeated by Dogs Andrea Dandolo in 1852. His successOr i
