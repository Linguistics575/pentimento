13. From Aosta to the Grain Alps.

The Guru Ana. an extensive mountain-system culminating in the
Gran Paradiso (18,324 ft.) and the Grivola (13,022 no, lie between the
valleys of the Born Baum and the Isere on the N.. and those of the
Dora Riparia and the Are on the S. We here describe a few of the most
interesting routes through the E. part of this grand mountain-region,
in the form of a circular tour of four days from Aorta, taking in Gogne,
Valsaearanche, Rhe'mes Nata-Dame, Valgrisanche, and Liverogne. Cogne is
the best centre for excursions.

The mountains of Cogne formed a favourite chaste of King Humbert,
as they did of his father Victor Emmanuel (p. 53), and the mountain
goat ('Steinbock', Ital.'stambecco', Fr.'bouquetin'), elsewhere nearly
extinct, is still found here. Several excellent bridle-paths, leading to the
royal shooting-lodges, are a great assistance to the pedestrian.

ist Day. - From AOSTA TO Grams (61/2 hie). As far as o M.)
Aymavilte (2120 ft.) we may follow the highroad (p. M), but it is
preferable to cross the Don near Aosta, and to go by Gressan and Jovengan, across meadows and fields. The bridle-path then ascends
rapidly past the church of St. Martin to Pain (3790 IL), and enters
the monotonous, Va.1 de Cogne at a great height above the ravine of
the brawling Grand' Eym'e. Far below we soon observe the houses
of Pont d'Ael (2865 IL), with its admirably preserved'anen
Bridge (formerly an aqueduct), 60 yds. long and 390 ft. above the
stream. It was erected in the reign of Augustus. The valley contracts. Near the bridge by which we cross the stream we obtain a
view of the Grivola for a short time. We next reach (11/2 hr.)
Vim: [ 3714 m; cantine), at the mouth of the Combs de Nomenon
(pretty waterfall), with the Grivola and the Gran Nomenon
(11,440 ft.) in the background. Beyond (1 ], hr.) Sitesnoire (right)
and a deserted iron-foundry we again cross the brook by the Pont
de Local (4480 ft.), where the mountains of Cogne are revealed,
to (11/3 hr.) hind (4760 ft.), opposite the lofty Punta del Pousset
(see below) and the Trajo Glacier. At (1/2 hr.) Cram; the Valnontey descends from the S. to the Grand' Eyvie; (20 min.) Cogne.
