Duomo Nuovo. BRESCIA. 34. Route. 201

addition on the top, due to L. Vanvitelti (1769-73), is-to be replaced
by a dome in accordance with the original design. - The handsome
adjacent building on the right, the Archivio a Camera Notarile (Pl. o,
is probably also by Fromeutone.

On the opposite (E.) side of the Piazza, above an arcade, rises the
Torre dell' Orologio, or clock-tower, with a large dial (twice 1 to
it). The bell is struck by two iron figures as at Venice (p. 276).
--To the left rises a Monument, erected in 1864 to the Brescians
who fell in 1849 (p. 200); on the pedestal are scenes from the
contest. - The S. side of the piazza is occupied by the Monte di
Pint, a plain Renaissance building begun in 1484; the E. half,
with a handsome loggia, was erected in 1597 by Pier Maria Bagnadore.

To the SE. of the Piazza del Comune is the'Duomo Nuovo
(Pl. 0, 3), a handsome church begun in 1604 by Giov. Batt. Lantana
(but the dome, 270 ft. high, not completed till 1825). It is in the'
form of a Greek cross, with a lengthened choir.

IIrnxom By the first pillar on the right is the large monument of
BishOp Nave. (d. 1831), by Monti by the first pillar on the left, the monument of Bishop Ferrari (d. 1018). The second altar on the right n
darned with modern statues in marble of Faith, by Salas-ant, and Ho e,
by Emanuelt', and a painting Christ healing the sick, try amount- ATI'.
Then (3rd altar on the right), a sarcophagus with small reliefs (1510),
containing the'Corpora D. D. Arollondi ct Philaurs", transferred hither in
m from the crypt of the old cathedral .--High-altar-piece, an Assumption by Zobott, designed by Sub. Contra (18th cent.).

From a door between the 2nd and 3rd altars 25 steps descend
to the Duomo Vecchio (Pl. o, 3), generally called La Rotunda (shown
by the sacristan of the Duomo Nuovo). This massive dome-structure (of the 10th cent. t) is circular, as its name imports, with an
ambulatory, and rests on eight short pillars in the interior. Beneath
is the crypt, or Basilica di San Filastro (now lighted by electricity),
supported by 42 columns. This represents an early- Christian
basilica, the ground-plan of which was probably followed in the
curious old addition on the E. side of the church, consisting of a
transept and choir with lateral chapels.

0n the W. side of the above-mentioned ambulatory is the tomb of
Bishop Maggi (d. 1100, by Wo da Wand?) .--Altar-piece in the added
choir an'Assumption by Moreno (1526):, at the sides, a Presentation in
the fampla Ind I Visitation, by Romanino; on the left, Palm Vecchio (I),

the "Biblioteca Queriniana (Pl. 4, O 3; tea 1/5 fro, of 40,000 vols.,
