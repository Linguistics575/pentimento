236 Route 38. MANTUA. From ana

Mantua is mentioned as the home of Virgil, who was born at the
ancient Ma (3 11. to the Bal., hen the village of Pietole), but it was not
a place of importance till the middle ages. In 1276 the citizens elected
Ptaamonte Boaacolsi, and in 1328 Luigi Omega, as'Capitano del Popolo',
and to the dynasty of the latter the town owed its prosperity. The
Gonzagas fought successfully against Milan and Venice, and extended their
territory, while the were liberal patrons of art and science. Giovanni
Francesco 11. (um J, the first marquis, invited the learned Vittorino
da Feltre to Mantua, and through him made his court a renowned centre
of culture and education. He was succeeded by Lodovico III. (mum).
The beautiful and accomplished Isabella d'Este (1474-1539), sister of
Alphonso, Duke of Fern", and mother of Eleonora of Urbino, was
the wife of Giovanni Francesco 111. (1484-1519). She carried on a lively
correspondence with the most eminent men of her time, and with shaman.
(1519-40) was raised to the rank of duke by e um v., and in 1536 he
was invested with the marquisate of Honteferrato; a monument of his reign
is the Palazzo del Th (p. 240). In 1627, when Charles de Never-s, a member
of a French collateral line, ascended the throne, the Mantuan war of
succession broke out, and Emperor Ferdinand II. declared the fist forfeited.
On 18th July, 1630, Mantua was stormed and sacked by the Austrians.
Although the am am, hard pressed by the Swedes, was obliged to conclude peace in 1 I, the town never recovered from this blow. cam 17.,
the last duke, taking the French side in the Spanish war of succession,
was declared an outlaw in 1703; Monteferrato was awarded to Piedmont,
and Mantua to Amman, of whose supremacy in Ital it became the chief
support. After a long and obstinate defence by hen! Warm the
fortress capitulated to the French on 2nd February, 1791. By the Peace of
Villafranca the Austrians retained Hantua although deprived of the rest of
Lombardy, but they were compelled to Made it to Italy in 1866.

In the history of ARCHITECTURE Mantua. is of importance on account

of the buildings of Leon Battista Alberts' (p. 443) of Florence, who had
been summoned to Kant" by Ludovico III. - Mantua also witnessed
the labours of several great Rnnusssncs Psmrsns. Andrea H
(p. 249) entered the service of Lodovico Gonzaga in 1463. In vigour of
conception and in the fidelity of his characters he rive ]! his best contemporaries, while he surpasses them in accuracy of perspective and in
his refined taste for beauty of landscape. He died at Mantua in 1506, and
was succeeded as court-painter in the following year by Lorenzo Costa
(comp. pp. 366, 365). When Raphael's pupils were dispersed after his
death, Giulio Romano (1492-1546), the grate" of them, settled at Hantua
in 1524, and there attained so high a reputation as an architect and
painter, that Mantua has been called the'town of Giulio Romano'. After
the example of Raphael's work in the Farnesina, he composed mythological
decorative paintings, which, though for interior to their prototype, attract
by the richness of the motives and sensuous magnificence of composition,
and are important owing to the influence they exercised on later art.
Francesco Primaticcio and Niccolo delP Abbate, pupils of Giulio Romano
who were educated here, were afterwards summoned to Fontainebleau,
and thus formed a link between the French and the Italian Renaissance.
Giulio Romano's works must also have influenced the style of Rubens, who
was court-painter at Mantua in 16008, under Vincenzu IL
