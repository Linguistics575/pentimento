lvii1 ITALIAN ART.

(1504) Raphael did not at first abandon the style he had learned at
Perugia, and which he had carried to greater perfection than any
of the other Umbrian masters. Many of the pictures he painted
there show that he still followed the precepts of his first master;
but he soon yielded to the influence of his Florentine training.
After the storm raised by Savonarola had passed over, glorious days
were in store for Florence. Leonardo, after his return from Milan,
and Michael Angelo were engaged here on their cartoon: for the
decoration of the great hall in the Palazzo Vecchio (p. 446); and it
was their example, and more particularly the stimulating influence
of Leonardo, that awakened the genius and called forth the highest
energies of all their younger contempOraries.

The fame of the Florentine school was at this period chiefly
RAPHAEL's maintained by Fax thmnouso C1175-i5i7) and ANDREA
FLORENTINE DEL SARTO (1487-1531). The only works of Bartolomeo
CONTEMPOB- which we know are somewhat spiritless altar-pieces, but they
"133' exhibit in a high degree the dignity of character, the tranquillity of expression, and the architectural symmetry of grouping
in which he excelled. His finest pictures are the Christ with the four
Saints, the Descent from the Cross (or Pieta), the M. Mark in the Pitti
Gallery, and the Madonna in the cathedral at Lucca. The traveller
would not do justice to Andrea del Sarto, a master of rich colouring,
were he to confine his attention to that artist's works in the two
great Florentine galleries. Sarto's Freeway in the Annunziata
(p. 483) and in the Scalzo (History of John the Baptist, p. 497) are
among the finest creations of the cinquecento. Such, too, was the
stimulus given to the artists of this period by their great contemporaries at Florence that even those of subordinate merit have occasionally produced works of the highest excellence, as, for instance,
the Salutation of ALBERTINELLI and the Zenobius pictures of RIDOLFO GHIBLANDAJO in the Uffizi. The last masters of the local
Florentine school were PONTORMO and ANGELO BBONZINO.

Raphael's style was more particularly influenced by his relations
to Fra Bartolomeo, and the traveller will find it most interesting
to compare their works and to determine to what extent each derived
suggestions from the other. The best authenticated works in
Italy of Raphael's Florentine period are the Madonna del Granduca
(Ping, the Madonna del Cardellino (Uffizi), the Entombment (Gal.
Borghese in Rome), the Puddle in the Vatican, the portraits of
Angelo and Maddalena Dom' (Pitti), and the Portrait of Himself
(Uffizi; p. 458). The Portrait of a Lady in the Pitti gallery is of
doubtful origin, and the Madonna del Baldacchino in the same gallery was only begun by Raphael.

When Raphael went to Rome in 1508 he found a large circle

Rama's of notable artists already congregated there. Some of these
Roam were deprived of their employment by his arrival, including
