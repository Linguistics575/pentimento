IV. Passports. Custom House. Luggage.

Passports, though not required in Italy, are occasionally useful.
Registered letters, for example, will not be delivered to strangers,
unless they exhibit a passport to prove their identity. The countenance and help of the English and American consuls can, of come
be extended to those persons only who can prove their nationality.
The Italian police authorities are generally civil and obliging.

Foreign Office passports may be obtained through 0. Smith a Son,

Custom House. The examination of luggage at the Italian
frontier railway-stations is generally lenient, but complaints are
sometimes made as to a deficiency of official courtesy at diligence
and steamer stations. Tobacco and cigars (only six pass free), playing
cards, and matches are the articles chiefly sought for. A duty of
30 e. per kilogramme (21/4 lbs.) is levied on unexposed photograph
plates. The custom-house receipts should be preserved, as travellers
are sometimes challenged by the excise officials in the interior. At
the gates of most of the Italian towns a tax (dado comma) is levied
on comestibles, bat traveller! luggage is passed at the barrier: (limite
dasiario) on a simple declaration that it contains no such articles.

Luggage. If possible, luggage should never be sent to Italy
by goods-train, as it is liable to damage, pilferage,' and undue
custom-house detention. If the traveller is obliged to forward it in
this way, he should employ a trustworthy agent at the frontier and
send him the keys. As a rule it is advisable, and often in the end
less expensive, never to part from one's luggage, and to superintend the custom-house examination in person (comp. p. xviii).

V. Public Safety. Beggars.
Public Safety in Northern Italy is on as stable a footing as to the
N. of the Alps. Travellers will naturally avoid lonely quarters
after night-fall, just as they would at home. The policeman in the
town is called Guardia; the gendarme in the country, Carabiniere
(black coat with red facing; and cocked hat). No one may carry
weapons without a licence, on pain of imprisonment. Armi in
