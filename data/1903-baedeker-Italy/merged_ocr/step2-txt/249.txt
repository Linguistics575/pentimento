136 Route 19. MILAN. c. West Quarters:

celebrated "Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinoi (no vim.; see p. 115).
The picture is unfortunately in bad preservation, chiefly from having
been painted on the wall in oils (before 1499). In the same room
are also exhibited numerous photographs, and contemporaneous
copies by Andrea Salado, Cesare del Magno, Marco d' 09950110, and
Ant. de Glaxiate, an inspection of which much facilitates the study
of the original. - The large fresco by Giov. Donate Montorfano
(Crucifixion) of 1495, opposite the Last Supper, is in much better
condition. The kneeling figures of Duke Lodovico i1 Moro o. Hi)
and his wife Bianca Maria with their children are by Leon. da
Vinci, the trace of whose hand is still distinguishable.

Deplorable as is the condition of the Last Supper, the chief work
executed by Leon. da Vinci during his stay at Milan, the original alone exhibits to its full extent the emotions which the master intended to express, and which even the best cOpies fail to re reduce. The motive of
the work has been well explained by Goethe:' he artist represents the
peaceful little band round the sacred table as thunder-struck by the Master's
words, One of you shall betray me. They have been pronounced:, the whole
company is in dismay, while he himself bows his head with downcast
eyes. His whole attitude, the motion of his arms and hands, all seem to
repeat with heavenly resignation, and his silence to confirm, the mournful
words -'It cannot be otherwise. One of you shall betray mel' Comp.

The Via Caradosso and the Via Boccaccio lead hence to the
Costello- (p. 129) .--In the Piazzale Michelangelo Buonarotti, beyond
the former Porta Magenta (Pl. A, 5), is the Case di Riposo poi Musicisti, a home of rest for musicians, established in 1899 by Verdi
(d. 1901), who is buried here. There is also the nucleus of a Verdi
Museum. [ Some reminiscences of Verdi are also preserved in a
room in the Grand Hotel Milan (p. 112), where he died.)

From Santa Maria delle Grazie the Via delle Oche and the Via
San Vino-re (Pl. B, 6),
a baroque building by Galeazzo Alessi (1560), interesting for its
elaborate internal decoration. A little farther on we pass the S. end
of the Via San Gerolamo, part of the ancient route round the ramparts, in which rises the Palazzo Gonzaga (No. 30), immediately
to the left, built in 1900 in the Lombard style by Cecilio Arpesani.
At the end of the Via San Vittore is the large PIAZZA Sun" Ammonia
(Pl. 0. 5, 6; electric tramway No. 5, p. lid), with the church of
Nant' Ambrogio (Pl. 0, G), founded by St. Ambrose in the 4th
cent, but probably dating in its present Romanesque basilica form,
with its peculiar galleries and an octagonal cupola over the highaltar, from the 12th century. The fine atrium in front of the church,
containing remains of ancient tombstones, inscriptions, and frescoes
seems, like the facade, to have preserved the architectural forms 01
the original building. St. Ambrosius baptized St. Augustine here
in 387, and in 389 he closed the doors of this church against the
Emp. Theodosius after the cruel massacre of Thessalonica. There
is a portrait of the saint on the left side of the principal entrance.
