Lucca (62 ft), formerly the capital of the duchy of that name
and now of a province, and also the see of an archbishop, with
73,465 inhab., is an antiquated place situated in a fertile plain between the Monti Pisani and the Alpi Apuane, with well--preserved

fortifications of 1561-1650 and many interesting churches.'Lucca ~

l'industriosa' is noted for its silk-factories, a branch of industry introduced from Sicily in the 14th cent, and also for its woollen goods
and oil. An aqueduct, built in 1823-32 by Lor. Nottolini and recalling with its 459 arches the aqueducts of the Roman Campagna,
supplies the city with good drinking-water from the Pisan mountains.

Lucca (Roman Luca) was founded at a very remote period. It
first belonged to Emma, afterwards to Liguria, and after its capture by
the Romans in 177 B. 0., it was garrisoned by a Roman colony and was
included in the province of Gallia Cisalpina. In B. C. 56 Julius Caesar,
who was then governor of Gaul, held a conference here with Empty
end Orleans, with whom he had been associated since B. O. 60, in order"
discuss a plan for the administration of the Roman empire for the ensuing
five years. The splendour of Lucca at that period is still indicated by the
remains of a Roman Amphitheatre. After the fall of the Roman Empire.
Lucca belonged successively to the Goths, Lombards, and Franks, then
became a duchy, and in 1115, after the death of the Countess Matilda (p.393) v
a republic. The feuds of the Guelphs and Ghibellines impaired the strength
of the place so seriously that in 1314 it was compelled to succumb to

Uguccione delta Faggiuota of Arena, the warlike governor of Pisa. Dante'

resided with his friend Uguccione at Lucca in 1314, and there became
enamoured of the youthful Gentucca (Purgatorio, xxiv. ta), but he does not
describe the inhabitants in very flattering terms (Inferno, xxi. M). After
the expulsion of Uguccione, Lucca fell in 1322 into the hands of the
powerful Castruccio Gastracani degli Antehninettd of Lucca, who was also
master of Pisa. On 23rd Sept, 1325, he defeated the Florentine:
at Altopascio, and in 1327 was nominated imperial governor in Pin, with
the title of duke, by Emp. Lewis the Bavarian. On his death in 1398
the power of Lucca declined; its next master was Maniac delta Scale; it
subsequently came into the possession of Florence and then tin 1345) of
Pisa, but in 1369 it purchased its freedom from Charles IV. for SQUID florins,
and with the exception of the rule of the native famil of the Main
(1395--1430), it remained independent till the invasion 0 the Wench in
1799. In 1805 Napoleon gave Lucca as a principality to his sister Elm
Baciocchi; in 1814 it came into the possession of the duke. of Plane of
the house of Bourbon, who, on succeeding to the throne of Parma after
the death of Marie Louise, ceded it to Tuscany in 1847.
In important position from the period of the Lombards onward. The olden l
churches have unfortunately preserved their early-medimval character very
. imperfectly, but their columns, like those of the early-Christian basilica:
of Rome, .are antique. The taste for buildin, probably stimulated by
rivalry Wlth Pisa, was again revived in the th cent, when the older
churches were altered and restored, doubtless in accordance With

models. - Towards the end of the 15th cent. lame aeitati (1M).
