ITALIAN ART. xxxvii

completed, the aim was obscure, the resources insufficient; meanwhile architecture alone satisfied artistic requirements, the attempts at painting and sculpture being barbarous in the extreme; these, however, were the germs of the subsequent development of art observable as early as the 11th and 12th centuries.
This has been aptly designated the Romanesque period (11thi3th cent), and the then prevalent forms of art the 30manesquo Style. As the Romance languages, notwithstanding
alterations, additions, and corruptions, maintain their fllial relation to the language of the Romans, so Romanesque art, in
spite of its rude and barbarous aspect, reveals its immediate
descent from the art of that people. The Tuscan towns were the
principal scene of the prosecution of medieval art. There an industrial population gradually arose, treasures of commerce were
collected, independent views of life were acquired in active party
conflicts, loftier common interests became interwoven with those
of private life, and education entered a broader and more enlightened track; and thus a taste for art also was awakened, and asthetic perception developed itself. When Italian architecture
of the Romanesque period is examined, the difference between its
character and that of contemporaneous northern works is at once
apparent. In the latter the principal aim is perfection in the
construction of vaulting. French, English, and German churches
are unquestionably the more organically conceived, the individual
parts are more inseparable and more appropriately arranged. But
the subordination of all other aims to that of the secure and accurate formation of the vaulting does not admit of an unrestrained
manifestation of the sense of form. The columns are apt'to be
heavy, symmetry and harmony in the constituent members to be
disregarded. On Italian soil new architectural ideas are rarely
found, constructive boldness not being here the chief object; on the
other hand, the decorative arrangements are richer and more grateful, the sense of rhythm and symmetry more pronounced. The cathedral of Pisa or the church of San Miniato near Florence, both
handed as early as the 11th century, may be taken as an example
of this. The interior with its rows of columns, the mouldings
throughout, and the flat ceiling recall the basilica-type; while the
exterior, especially the facade destitute of tower, with the small
arcades one above the other, and the variegated colours of the courses
of stone, present; a fine decorative effect. At the same time the construction and decoration of the walls already evince a taste for the
elegant proportion: which we admire in later Italian structures;
the formation of the capitals, and the design of the outlines prove
that the precepts of antiquity were not entirely forgotten. A peculiar conservative spirit pervades the medieval architecture of
Italy, artiste do not aim at an unknown and remote object; the ideal which they have in view, although perhaps instinctive:
