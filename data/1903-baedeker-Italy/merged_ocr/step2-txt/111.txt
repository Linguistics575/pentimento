The spacious PIAZZA CASTBLLO (Pl. E, 2, 3) forms the centre
of the town. From this point the busiest streets diverge: Via Roma,
Via Pietro Mince, Via Garibaldi, Via dell' Accademia delle Sciemc,

The Palazzo Madame (P1. E, 3), a lofty and cumbrous pile in
the centre of the Piazza Castello, had as its nucleus a medieval castle
built on the site of the Roman Porta Decumana (see p. 27). This
Castrum Porlae Phibsllonac, strongly fortified by William of Montferrat towards the end of the 13th cent., was extended on the E.
side and protected by two lofty sixteen-sided towers in 1416
by Lodovico d'Acaja. Farther alterations were made by Charles
Emmanuel 11., but the building oval its present name to his widow,
Maria, who as Dowager Duchess ('Madama Reale') embellished it
in 1718 by the addition of a handsome double flight of steps and the
facade on the W. side, from a design by Fit. Juvara. The apartments on the first floor, which were redecorated at the same period,
were used from 1848 to 1860 as the meeting-place of the Sardinian
Senate. The palace now contains several institutions, including the
State Archive Office and an Observatory, in the towers concealed by
the W. facade. - In front of it amide I Monument to the Sardinian
Army (P1. 28), by Vine. Vela, erected by the Milanese in 1859.
