The art of Painting was liberally patronised at Ferrara, as at all the
other Italian courts, but the Ferrarese painters did not succeed in maintaining full independence. In the 15th century they were chiefly influenced by m 1'an school and by Piero dens. Francesca of 11th
Thin double influence is shown in the case of Cosimo Tara (1432-1495),
of Francesco Cocoa (d. at Bologna in Idol, whose easel-paintings are frequently crude and angular, and of Ercole de' Roberti (a. me). the most
eminent of the early-Renaissance painters of Ferrara next to Tara. The
chief works of this period are the frescoes in the Pelazzo Sehifenojs
o. 358) .--Lorenzo Costa (14601636; comp. p. 236). another Ferraresc
master, left his home in his youth and came into intimate relations of
action and reaction with Francesco Francis, the chief master of the Bolognese school (comp. p. 365). The other great masters of the 16th cent. also
owed much to external sources. At their hand mm Dom Dani (a. 14791542), who shows the influence of Ariosto in his poetically conceived genre
works and of Giorgione in his landscapes. - Benoonuto Tm (1481-1559),
usually known as Gardfalo from his birthplace, long associated with
Dossi, is best represented in the galleries of Reine. The attempts of this
somewhat prosaic master io' rival the idealistic conceptions of Raphael
resulted disastrously. The productions of his later period, such as those
in the Pal. de' Diamanti (p. 359), though of great technical perfection,
become tedious through the insipid sweetness and empty conventional"!
of the heads. Lodom'co Mazzolino (1481-1530) is known for his fiery red
colouring, but sinks into insignificance when compared with his great
contemporaries. - Comma o. 3M) received his'first artistic training in

We approach the town from the station by the brand Fuss

the end of this street rises the
*Castello (Pl. D, o, an ancient and picturesque edifice with

four towers, surrounded by a most. It was built after 1385 by Bae
tolino da Novam for Niccolo II., and partly restored after a tire in
1554, and is now occupied by the prefect and other local authorities.'

The custodian is to be found at the aw. entrance (ring at the iron
gate to the right; fee 1/2--1 fr.). The Sdla dcl Consiglio and the adjacent Sula di Napoli, in the apartments of the prefecture, contain
frescoes of the school of Dosso Dossi, representing wrestling-matches
of the ancient palastra. The Sula dell' Aurora (said to be Eleonora's
room) contains a fine I" Frieze with children ('putti'). Adjacent is a
cabinet with three Bacchanalia by follower: of Gardfalo.

The custodian shows also a dungeon at the base of the'lion tower',
where the Mar-grave Nicholas III. confined his faithless wife Paw
"Malena and his natural son Hugo, her paramour, before beheading them
(May 21st 1425). Lord Byron in his poem of'Parisina' substitutes the
