,, ITALIAN ART.

pression, warmly extolled their authors, and zealously proclaimed
how greatly they surpassed their ancestors. But succeeding generations began to lose sight of this connection between ancient and
modern art. A mere anecdote was deemed sufficient to connect
Giotto di Bondone (1276--1337), the father of modern Italian art,
with GIOVANNI Gunman (d. after 1302), the most celebrated representative of the earlier style. (Cimabue is said to have watched
Giotto, when, as n shepherd-boy, relieving the monotony of his
office by tracing the outlines of his sheep in the sand, and to have
received him as a pupil in consequence.) But it was forgotten
that a revolution in artistic ideas and forms had taken place at
Rome and Siena still earlier than at Florence, that both Cimabue
and his pupil Giotto had numerous professional brethren, and
that the composition'of mosaics, as well as mural and panelpainting, was still successfully practised. Subsequent investigation
has rectified these errors, pointed out the Roman and Tuscan mosaics
as works of the transition-period, and restored the Sienese master
Duccio (ca. 1300), who was remarkable for his sense of the beautiful and the expressiveness of his figures, to his merited rank.
Giotto, however, is fully entitled to rank in the highest class. The
amateur, who before entering Italy has become acquainted with
Giotto from insignificant easel-pictures only, often arbitrarily
attributed to this master, and even in Italy itself encounters
little else than obliquely drawn eyes, clumsy features, and
cumbrous masses of drapery as characteristics of his style, will
regard Giotto's reputation as ill-founded. He will be at a loss
to comprehend why Giotto is regarded as the inaugurator of a
new era of art, and why the name of the old Florentine master
is only second in popularity to that of Raphael. The fact is that
ammo: Giotto's celebrity is not due to any single perfect work of
INFLUENCE art. His indefatigable energy in different spheres of art, the
enthusiasm which he kindled in every direction, and the development for which he paved the way, must be taken into consideration,
in order that his place in history may be understood. Even when,
in consonance with the poetical sentiments of his age, he embodies
allegorical conceptions, as poverty, chastity, obedience, or displays
to us a ship as an emblem of the Church of Christ, he shows a
masterly acquaintance with the art of converting what is perhaps
in itself an ungrateful idea into a speaking, lifelike scene.
Giotto is an adept in narration, in imparting a faithful reality to
his compositions. The individual figures in his pictures may fail
to satisfy the expectations, and even earlier masters, such as
Duccio, may have surpassed him in execution, but intelligibility
of movement and dramatic effect were first naturalised in art by
Giotto. This is partly attributable to the luminous colouring
employed by him instead of the dark and heavy tones of his
predecessors, enabling him to impart the proper expression to
