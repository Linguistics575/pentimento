niches below are the granite sarcophagi of the rinces, some of them with
gilded bronze "Mu", from Cosimo I. (d. 157) to Cosimo 111. (d. 1723;
comp. p. 399). On the coping round the chapel are placed the armorial
bearings of 16 Tuscan towns in exquisite stone-mosaic. A new floor was
begun in 1888. - A sum of 22 million lire (about 880,0) 01.) was expended
y the Medici family on the construction and decoration of this chapel.

The "New Sacristy (Sagrestia Nuova; admission, see p. 437;
50 0.), built by Michael Angelo for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici (who
became Pope Clement WI. in 1523) in 1520-24, as a mausoleum
for the house of the Medici, is a simple quadrangular edifice surmounted by a dome and articulated by pilasters, canoPies, and recesses. In form it corresponds with the old sacristy by Brunelleschi.
The sculptures with which it was to have been filled (monuments
to Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano, Popes Leol.
and Clement WI., and to the younger Giuliano and Lorenzo "
Medici) have been confined to the monuments of the two last-named.
Giuliano de' Medici (d. 1516), created Due de Nemours by the King
of France, and Lorenzo de' Medici (d. 1519), who became Duke
of Urbino under Lee K. The great master worked at his task full
of bitter feelings at the abolition of the republic by Alessandro de'
Medici, and in 1534 left it unfinished, as he feared the tyrant's
hate after the death of the Pope. In spite of these unfavourable circumstances Michael Angelo has here produced a congruous whole of
the greatest beauty. Architecture and sculpture are as harmonious
as if the master had modelled sarcophagi and statues, cornice: Ind
niches, doors and windows out of one and the same clay.
, On the right is the "MONUMENT or Grununo nn' MEDICI, who is represented as General of the Church, holding the commander's baton
in his hand. Full of proud confidence and energy he gazes before him,
ready to start up at the approach of danger. Below is the sarcophagus.
containing the remains of the deceased and adorned by the'Statues of

Day and Night, the latter especially admired. A contemporary poet, Gioyanni Battista Strozzi, wrote upon it the lines:

Michael Angelo, in allusion to the suppression of political liberty
(see above), answered:
