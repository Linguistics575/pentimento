of silver are said to have been used n the execution of this work of art.
An earlier silver altar was plundered in 1295 by Vanni Fucci, for which
crime Dante gives him a place in the Inferno (m 124 et seq.).
The Gun, borne by six columns, is modernised.

The campanile was originally a fortified tower (13th cent.)
celled Torre del Podesta, and still been the arms of governors of
the town. The three series of arches were added in Plan fashion
when the tower was adapted to its present purpose.

Opposite the cathedral is the octagonal'Battistero (San Giovanni Battista; Pl. l), erected after 1339 by Canine di Neat in the
Italian-Gothic style, according to Vasari from a design by Andrea
Pisano. On the exterior is a pulpit. The principal portal has a fine
wooden door. The large square font is embellished with richlydecorated Slabs from the old pulpit (1199) of the cathedral.

Adjacent is the *Palazzo Pretoria (PI. 12), formerly Pal. del
Podestlt, a Gothic building of the 14th cent, with a modern upper
story. It now contains the courts of justice. The picturesque
'Quadrangle is enclosed by four round arches resting upon piers,
the arcades and the facade are adorned with numerous painted armorial bearings of the Podesta's, remarkable for their admirable
heraldic style, restored in 1844. To the left of the entrance are the
stone table and seats of the ancient tribunal, bearing the inscription of 1507: _

The piazza is adorned with a Statue of Cardinal Forteguerra, a
native and benefactor of the city (d. 1473), erected in 1863. Opposite the Pal. Pretorio is the PALAZZO nu. Comma (P1. 11;
originally Pal. degli Anziani), erected in the Italian-Gothic style in
1294-1385, with a vestibule. The black marble head near the
middle window, is said to represent Filippo Tedici, who sought to
betray the city to Castruccio (p. 416). The large hall upstairs contains tine wood-work of 1534, a relief of the Madonna by the Master
of the Marble Madonnas (15th cent.), and a *Relief in marble of
the School of Vmocchio (1494), representing the arms of the city
supported by two angels. The small picture-gallery contains nothing of importance.

Passing between the cathedral and the Pal. del Commie Or the
Via Ripe del Sale), we next visit SAN BABTOLOMRO m PANTANO
(Pl. 0, D, 2), a basilica in the Tuscan-Romanesque style with
