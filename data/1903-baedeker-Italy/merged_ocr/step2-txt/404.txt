of Padua o. at Lisbon, d. 1231; an associate of St. Francis of
Assisi), commonly called'It Santo', was begun in 1232; the nave
was completed in 1307, and the remainder in 1424. The church
was restored in 1749 after a fire and whitewashed in the interior.

doors of wood. Four rich Gothic niches in the central portal contain
statuettes, by Aug. Feud, of 88. Francis, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony, and
