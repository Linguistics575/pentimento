Painting. To the right of the chapel, on the E. WALL: Crucifixion,
ascension, the Doubting Thomas, and Resurrection, by aFoltower of Giotto
(14th cent), said by Vasari to be 2hegratrnaceo. All these have been repainted.

h the S. WALL: "Triumph of Death: to the left are represented the

retired life of the pious hermit and the worldliness of the wealthy who
on their way to the chase are suddenly reminded by three open Gr'il, i; in the centre is Death, invoked
in vain by the poor and wretched; above are devils bearing away the
souls of the deceased to a fiery punishment; to the right, the eternal
happiness of the blessed, who are seated in a garden, beneath pomegranate
Amt; above are angels with the souls of the redeemed. Next are the
cLast Judgment (attitude of the Judge celebrated and imitated even by
Frs Bartolomeo and Michael Angelo) and Hell (lower half entirely repainted).
These three are attributed by Vasari to Andrea Orcagna, but modern critics
believe that they were executed about 1350 by Pisan masters (perhaps
Franc. Trainoh The following fresco, representing the Life (temptations
and miracles) of the holy hermit! in the Theban wilderness, which Vasari
ascribes to Pietro Lorenzetti of Siena, is by an unidentified hand. Above
the entrance is a'Madonna'in excelsis' by P. Waim'. - Between the two
entrances, the life of St. Rainerus, the tutelary saint of Pisa. The four
upper scenes (conversion from a worldly life, journey to Palestine, victory
Wet temptation retirement to a monastery) were completed by Andrea

ttributes them to Simone Martini of Siena). The four lower and betterxecuted scenes (return from Palestine, miracles, death, and removal of
his body to the cathedral of Pin, the last much injured) were painted
y Antonio Veneziano in 13367. - Then, above, scene: from the life of
t. Ephesus (who as a Roman general, fighting against the heathens,
: ceives a flag of victory from the Archangel Michael, but is afterwards
indemned and executed); below, scenes from the life of St. Potitus,
lmirably portrayed by Spindle Arcana in 1391, but now almost obliterated.
Lastly, the history of Job, by Francesco da Volterra (erroneously attributed
Giotto), begun in 1370, in bad preservation.
