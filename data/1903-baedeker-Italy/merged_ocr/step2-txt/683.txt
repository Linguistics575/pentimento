in 1441 for Cosimo de' Medici, who presented it with 400 M33. collected
by Niccolo Niccoli. The glass-cases in the middle contain ritual book Â»,
with miniatures by Pro Benedetto, the brother of Angelico, and other
artists of the 15th century. - On the other side of this corridor are
Two Cum (Nos. M, M), near those of St Antonina, and containing
three small easel pictures by Fm Angelica ('Madonna delle Stelle,'Coronation of the Virgin, and "Adoration of the Magi with the Annunciation).
The LAST CELL on the right, embellished with a'fine Adoration of the
Magi, al fresco, by Fra Angelica, is said to be that which Cosimo Pater
Patriae caused to be fitted up for himself, and where he received the
Abbot Antoninus and Fra Angelico; it contains his portrait by Pontorm
and a terracotta bust of St. Antonina.

The Accademia delta Onuca, founded in 1582 to maintain the
purity of the Italian language, occupies part of the monastery. Its
great dictionary of the language, begun in 1843, is still only about
half finished.

On the S.E. side of the piazza, at the corner of the Via della
Sapienza (leading to the Piazza dell' Annunziata, p. 482), lies the
Male Istituto di Stud } Superior! (entr. Piazza 8. Marco 2), the first
floor of which contains the Indian Museum, founded by A. de
Gubernatis (adm., see p. 437;'catalogue 60 o.--This building is adjoined on the Na.
by the fine Botanical Garden 1. H, 3; entr., Via Lamarmora 6b),
founded by Cosimo I. in 15 3, usually called the Giardino de'

The building was originally the Ospedale di San Matteo. - The
collection of ancient masters contains few pictures to strike the
eye or imagination of the amateur, but it is a most important
collection for students of the development of Italian art during
the 14-16th centuries. We have the advantage here of being able
to concentrate our attention on the characteristic features of the
Tuscan and Umbrian schools, to the productions of which this
collection is restricted. The small pictures of Giotto (Room VI,
No. 103, etc.) and Fra Angelico'u Life of Christ (Room IX, No. 233)
are merely to be regarded as supplementary to the much more
important labours of these two great masters in the department
of fresco-painting; the Last Judgment (Room IX, No.266); nd the
Descent from the Cross (Room w, No. 166), however, afford 1 good
idea of Fun Angelico's works. The collection is chiefly important
for the study of the Florentine art of the 15th century. The
excellent narrative-painter Francesco Pesellino (Room IV, No. 72)
