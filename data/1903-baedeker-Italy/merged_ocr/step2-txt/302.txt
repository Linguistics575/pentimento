situated a little to the N. of the mouth of the Tram (p. 164). The
Statue of Garibaldi, near the pier, commemorates his brave but futile

after the conclusion of the armistice between Piedmont and Austria
on Aug. 15th, 1848. The church of San Pietro, in the S.W. of the
town, contains injured frescoes by Bernardino Luini, a native of
