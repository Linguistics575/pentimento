The round *Campanile, or bell-tower, begun by the architects
Bonannus of Pisa and William of Innsbruck in 1174, and completed
in 1350, rises in eight different stories, which, like the Baptistery,
are surrounded with half-columns and six colonnades. Owing to its
remarkable oblique position, "ft. out of the perpendicular (height
179 ft.), it is usually known as the Leaning Tower. The question
whether this peculiarity was intentional or accidental has frequently
been discussed, but it is now pretty generally believed that the
foundations on the S. side sank in the course of building, and that
from the third story upwards an inclination in the opposite
direction was given. Galileo availed himself of the oblique position
of the tower in making his experiments regarding the laws of gravitation. The l" View from the platform is very beautiful, embracing
the town and environs, the sea, and the mouth of the Arno to the W.,
Leghorn to the S.W., the Apuan Alps to the N., and'the Monti
Pisani to the N.E. (best at sunset, with brilliant lights over the
Carrara Mts.). A good staircase of 294 step: leads to the top (mint,

Giovanni Pisano. In the interior the green quadrangle is surrounded
by a spacious cloister, with unglazed, round-arched windows filled

with beautiful tracery. Three chapels adjoin the cloister; the oldest I
