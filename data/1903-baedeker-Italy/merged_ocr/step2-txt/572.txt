On the left, the "wa and mu of Oh?!" (without I bend); on the
right, the history of the Passion from the Last Supper to the Resurrection
(Christ with a heard). The omission of the Crucifixion itself points to
the origin of these mosaics at an early period when representations of the
kind were abhorred .--The last chapel (Cappella dolls Religuts) on the
left, in which the marble lining of the Will! still remains, contains an
ancient marble episcopal throne, broken marble screens which belonged
to the ambo of the nave, and on the wall a portrait of Justinian in mosaic,
restored in 1863. At the altar are four porphyry columns from the ancient
ciborium.

At the corner of the Via Alberoni, a few paces to the S. of
S. Apollinare Nuovo, some remains of the Palace of Theodorie
(P1. 39; E, 5) are still extant, unless indeed, as is possible, these
date from an addition erected in the time of the exarchs.

The remains include a narrow facade with round-arched blind arcades
and with a central niche (exedra) in the upper story (disengaged in 1898
and at the same time freely restored), a colannade in two stories, the
bases of two round towers, etc. (key kept by the sacristan of S. A ollinare;
fee 39500.). - The palace was plundered by Belisarius in 53, and in
784 its treasures of art and most of its columns were removed to Aix-laChapelle by Charlemagne. The niece and its gardens extended E. to the
Viale Pallavicino, and down toi the sea ad oined it at the back. The
massive principal tower was standing until 1 95.

Still farther to the S. is Santa Maria in Porto (Pl. F, 6) erected
in 1553 from the remnants of San Lorenzo in Cesarea (p. Air, and
restored in 1895-96. The facade dates from 1784. The church
consist: of nave and aisles with transept and an octagonal dome,
the roof borne by columns and pillars placed alternately. The choir
contains an ancient vase in porphyry. In enchant vane in porphyry. In the N. transept is a Brzantine marble relief of the Virgin (8th cent. t), - The adjacent
: Monastery, now a barrack, has two handsome Renaissance cloisters
(16th cent.) .----'In the Ippodromo, behind the church, a fragment
of the town-wall (6th cent.) is preserved.

About 1/2 M. to the E. of the Porta Senate (PL D, E, 1; p. 392),
. beyond the railway, is the Greet
(Pl. G, i; fee 30-50 c.), or Santa Maria delta Rotunda, as it was

called after the remains of the heretic were scattered and the church
. became a Roman Catholic place of worship. In the middle ages it
was the church of the adjoining Benedictine monastery and the
Pantheon of Revenue, but it was disengaged again from the surrounding buildings in 1719. Probably erected by Theodoric himself (about 520), it is a two-storied structure of decagonal shape in
the style of the ancient Roman tombs, and the flat dome, 36 ft. in
diameter, consists of a single huge block of Istrian rock, which is
said to weigh 470 tons. Some remains of the colonnade which
encircled the somewhat retreating upper story are now preserved
in the interior. The substructure long lay half under water; the
upper part is approached by a double staircase of marble (1774).



About 2 M. to the NE. of the rail. station, on the Canals Cob
aini or. 385) and at the beginning of the Pineta (p. 395), is the
Cimitero Monumentale, laid out since 1879 (flue monuments).
