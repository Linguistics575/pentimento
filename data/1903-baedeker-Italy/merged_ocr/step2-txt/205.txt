Climate. Rapallo is surrounded on the N. by a semicircle of moon.
tains, which unite with the promontory of Portofino on the W., to form a
tolerable shelter against the wind. Rapallo is under, minister, and rainier
than Nervi, but far excels it in the number of its attractive walks.

Rapallo, a small seaport with 10,343 inhab., who make lace and
do a brisk trade in olive-oil, has become a frequented winter-resort,
owing to its agreeable climate and beautiful situation. The old
Castello, on the beach, is now a prison and coast--guard station. An
ancient Roman bridge here is known as'Hannibal's Bridge'.
