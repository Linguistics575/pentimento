Min, and, after the Carlovingian epoch, Berengarius 1., ruled here. Verona
afterwards headed the league of Venetian cities against Frederick Barbarasss. During the fierce contests between Guel he and Ghibellines the
terrible Esselino da Romano (d. 1259) endeavours to establish a lordship
Heme. The year after Ezzelino's death Martino delta Scale, another
Ghibelline, was elected redeem. The Scaligers, the great princes of his
house, inaugurated a glorious period for the city. Mastino was assassinated
in 1277, but his brother and successor Albert secured the supremacy of
his line. Romeo and Juliet are said to have loved and died in the reign
of Albert's son Bartolomeo (1301434). The greatest member of this illustrious family was Can Francesco, or' Can Grands I.' (131129) who captured
Vicenza and subdued Padua after a long struggle. His brilliant court
numbered Dante among its guests. Mastino 11. (1329-51) at first conquered
Brescia, Perm, and Lucca, but his rule was afterwards restricted to
Verona and Vicenza by a league formed by Florence Venice, and Milan.
On Grands 1 ]., his successor, was murdered by his brother Can Binnie:
in m; and in 1387 the latter's son Antonio, who had also endeavoured
to secure his possession by fratricide, was expelled by Gian Galeaszo Viscosti, Lord of Milan. Through the widow of Visconti the town passed in
1105 to the Venetians, to whom with short interruptions, it remained
subject down to the end of the heypublic.

In the history of Ancmwnoruxn erona is important, both on account of
itsmedieeval buildings, end an Rome, and as
the home of Michele Sanmicheli (1484-1559), who sought to unite the beauty
of the Ionic order with the grim strength of military fortifications and
adorned the city with a series of sumptuous edifices. In judging of the
Verona palaces, we must bear in mind that it was customary here, as at

, various other towns of the Venetian'terra ferma', to adorn the facades
with paintings. The painted facades of houses near San Fermo, by the
Ports Borsari in Piazza delle Erbe, and others partly recall the Paduan
style of the Bu; century. - The earlier Veronese Pamrans of the second
half of the nth cent. were an erior especially in colouring to the Florentine school of Giotto and he ] themselves clear of its fnflatsnety. The chief
of these water: wu Amman, to whom is ascribed the fresco in Bant'
Anastasia (p. 225), the only monument of the period in Verona (other freecoes in Padua, see p. 251). A new period of importance begun in the 15th
century. Among the chief masters were Vittore Pisano (d. ca. 1451), the
celebrated medallist; Liberate da Verona, especially noteworthy for his
miniatures; Dummies and his son Franc. Morone; and Paolo film-undo, summed Ca.
Gill, (1486-1522). The artistic family of the Bonifazios, though originating
in Vernal, flourished mainly in Venice. On the other hand Paolo valid",
summed Verona. (1528-88) also resident in Venice, owed his artistic
development mainly to the influence of his native place. In the history
of SCULPTURE Verona also holds a place of some importance, as is evidenced
by the Romanesque reliefs on the facade of Sen Zeno (p. 229), the font
of San Giovanni 1.. Fame (p. 226), and the Gothic monuments of the See.ligers (p. 225).
