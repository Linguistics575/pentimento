In and near the LUNGABNO are several other interesting buildngs, with which we may terminate our walk.

San Niccolo. (Pl. 0, A), founded about the year 1000 by Count
Iugo of Tuscia as a Benedictine abbey, has an obliquely placed
lampam'lc, which contains an admirable winding staircase ascribed
, Niccolo Pisano. - The Piazza in front of the church is adorned
rith a Statue ofFerdinand I., by a pupil of Giov. da Bologna (1595).

In the Lungarno Regio (p. 406) is the Palazzo Lanfreducci (Pl. 6;
, D, 4), now Uppezinghi, designed by Cosimo Pagliani, with the
'agment of a chain over the entrance, with the motto'alla giornata'.
--A little to the E., just before the Ponte di Mezzo, rile: the
Palazzo Agostini, a fine Gothic brick edifice of the 15th century.

At the N. and of the Ponte di Mezzo is the Piazza Garibaldi
'l. D, E, o, with an excellent bronze Statue of Garibaldi, by
a. Ferrari (1892; good reliefs on the pedestal) .--In the busy
a del Barge, a few yards to the N. of the bridge, rises
San Michele in Borgo (Pl. E, 4), a flat-rooted basilica, prob[ y of the 11th cent., with an old crypt. The facade, which is said
have been designed by Niccolo Pisano (but more probably by his
pil Fra Guglielmo), was partly rebuilt in the Gothic style.

The mosaic flooring in San Pierino (Pl. E, 4), near the Piazza
iroli, is of early-Christian origin, and some of the columns are
.ique .---- The narrow Via dell: Belle Ton-i, leading to the E. from

Piazza Cairoli, still preserves a distinctly medieval impress.
