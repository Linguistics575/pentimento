cheerful sky, and comparative immunity from rain. The'invalid's
day', or the time during which invalids may remain in the open
air with impunity, lute here from 10 mu. to 4 p.m. The general
chest of a prolonged course of Open-air life in the Riviera may be
described as a gentle stimulation of the entire physical organism.
It is found particularly beneficial for convalescents, the debilitated,
and the aged; for children of scrofulous tendency; and for the martyrs of gout and rheumatism. The climatic cure of the Riviera is
also often prescribed to patients with weak chests, to assist in the
removal of the after-efi'ects of inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy,
or to obviate the danger of the formation of a chronic pulmonary
discharge. The dry and frequently-agitated air of the Riviera is,
however, by no means suitable for every patient of this kind, and
the immediate vicinity of the see is particularly unfavourable to
cases of a feverish or nervous character. The stimulating effects of
the climate are then often too powerful, producing sleeplessness
and unwholesome irritation. The dry air of the Riviera di Ponente
is also prejudicial to many forms of inflammation of the wind-pipe
and bronchial tubes, which derive benefit from the air of Nervi,
Pin, or Ajaccio. Cases of protracted nephritis or diabetes, on the
contrary, often obtain considerable relief from a residence here.

The season on the Ligurian coast lasts from about the beginning of October to the middle of May. In September it is still too
hot, and in March it is so windy that many patients are obliged to
retire farther inland. Many invalids make the mistake of leaving
the Riviera too soon, and thus lose all the progress they have made
during the winter, through reaching home in the unfavourable transition period between winter and spring. It is better to spend April
and May at some intermediate station, such as Panama, Cannero,
Locum, Lugano, or Gardone Riviera.

Good Opportunities for sea-bathing are offered at many points
on the Mediterranean coast of N. Italy t such as Maria, Savona,
Pegli, Species, Viareggio, Leghorn, and Venice. The Mediterranean is
almost tideless; it contains about 41 per cent of common salt, a considerably higher proportion than the Atlantic; its average temperature during the bathing-season is 71Â° Fahr. The bathing-season
on the Ligurian coast begins in April, or at latest in May, and lasts
till November, being thus much longer than the season at any English
seaside-resort.

Most travellers must in some degree alter their mode of living
whilst in Italy, without however implicitly adopting the Italian style.
Inhabitants of more northern countries generally become unusually
susceptible to cold in Italy, and therefore should not omit to be well
supplied with warm clothing for the winter. Woollen underclothing is
especially to be recommended. A cloak or shawl should be carried to
neutralise the often considerable difference of temperature between the
sunshine and the shade. In visiting picture-galleries or churches on
