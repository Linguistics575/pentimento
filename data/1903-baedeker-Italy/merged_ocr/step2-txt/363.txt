Wards the end of its course, moreover, it receives its most important
tributaries. The result is that the adjacent districts are much exposed to
inundations, a danger which bus to be averted by the construction of huge
dykes; and these works frequently require to be raised, as the bed of the
river is constantly rising. The Po, together with the Tagltamento, License,
Have, Bream, Adige, and other coast-rivers, terminates in a vast delta which
extends along the whole coast of Venetia. The quantity of alluvial depoeli
is to great, that the coast-district between Tagliamento and Revenue alone
was increased by about 295 sq. M. in the course of the.19th century. From
the same cause the beds of the streams are continually undergoing change
and subdivision. Thus the ancient seaport of Hatria now lien 15' ]: M. from
the coast, and while the Po formerly flowed towards the B., It his formed
its present embouchure since 1150. The extensive lagoons (lacuna), separated from the sea by narrow strip! of land (um), and connected with it
by outlets, would render the whole coast uninhabitable in summer, were
it not for the ebb and flow of the tide, which distinguishes the Adriatic from
other parts of the Mediterranean (comp. p. 270), and prevents malarious
exhalations. This extensive alluvial territory, which reminds one of
Holland, called into activity the ingenuity and enterprise of its inhabitant!
at an early period and a temperate and conservative character has thus
been imparted to their history.
