238 Route 33. MANTUA. From Verona

The entire quarter between the Piazza Bordello and the Lago
Inferiore is occupied by the spacious Reggie, or Code Beale
(Pl. D, 2), originally a palace of the Bonacolsi (1302), afterwards
frequently added to by the Gonzagas, but now in great part unoccupied. The original Gothic facade, with its battlements, is still
in good preservation. The original splendour of the palace is still
represented in the apartments of Isabella d'Este (p. 236) as well
as in those altered for Federico n. in 1525-31 by Giulio ROW.
The elegant decorations in the classicist style, now to be seen in
several of the rooms destroyed by the Austrians in 1630, date from
the reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph IE.' and from the time of
the viceroy Eugene Beauharnais (p. lit).

A visit to the palace requires not less than 1 hr. The custodian is
to be found under the second large arched gateway to the left (fee 1 fro.
