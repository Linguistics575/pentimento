lost its prosperity for ever. Thenceforward until 1797, and again in
1815-60, it belonged to the States of the Church. In Aug., 1849, Garibaldi
found refuge at Revenue from the pursuing Austrians, while his wife
Anita succumbed to the fatigues of the flight.

In the History of Early Christian Art of the 58th century, Revenue is
the most important place in Italy next to Rome. While most of the other
Italian cities fell into decay after the barbarian invasion, Revenue saw
new and imposing structures rising in her midst at that period. The
connection of Roman and Byzantine art may best be studied at Revenue.
Here, as at Constantinople, also formerly the centre of a brilliant architectural period, the traveller will observe how the capitals of the columns
were gradually remodelled, and a new style of ornamentation introduced.
Besides the basilicas there are also dome-structures, which form a link
between Byzantium and some of the churches of N. Italy and the cathedral
at Aix-la-Chapelle. The ancient Bunnmes of Revenue belong to three
different periods, the first being that of Honorius and his sister Gilli
Placid", 402450 (Cathedral, Saqr Ayala, San Giovanni Evangelism, San
Giovanni Battista, Mausoleum of Galla Ptacidia, ArchiepiscOpal Chapel,
Baptistery of the Orthodox, and San haunt"); the second a Gothic period
from 493 to about 539 (St. Martians or Sant' Apoltinare Nuovo, Spirits
Santa, Baptistery of the Adam or Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and the Palace
and Mausoleum of Theodor-is); and the third a Byzantine period from 539
onwards (San Vitals and Sant' Apottinare in Ctasse, both begun in the preceding period). The basilicas of Revenue differ from the Roman in having
their porticoes converted into a closed anterior structure, in possessing
columns expressly designed for their object (by Byzantine architects in
Istria) instead of being brought from other buildings, and in showing a
consistent use of the round arch with corresponding articulation on the
external walls (Palace of Theodoric; Sant' Apollinare in Classe). This last
feature ap ears also in Diocletian's buildings "Silent Round campanili,

are wanting, as also was probably the case originally in most of the Roman
basilicas. Notwithstanding the duration: of subsequent ages, and the
raising of the pavements by several feet, which was rendered necessary by
the gradually increasing elevation of the surrounding soil, these noble
monuments of triumphant Christianity are profoundly impressive, and their
effect is greatly enhanced by the stillness and solitude of the environs. MosAIc PAINTING was also extensively practised "Revenue. The earlier

products of the centuries preceding the Carlovingian era.

Lord Byron, who preferred Revenue to all the other towns of Italy,
and was influenced in some measure by his intimacy with the Countess
Guiccioli, a member of the Gamba family of Revenue, spent two years
here (June, 1819, to October, 1821; see p. 389).

From the station (PL a, 3, o, in front of which rises a statue to
the Italian patriot L. C. Farini, Dictator of the Emilia in 1860, we

Evangelism (p. 392) and a monument (by Zocchi; 1888) to the
champions of Italian liberty, and crossing the Corso Giuseppe Garibaldi (to the right, Spirito Santo and the Baptistery of the Adam,
p. 392), proceed straight on through the Via me to the Pram
