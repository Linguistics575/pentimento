Podesta is the entrance to the
IV. SALOON, originally a chapel, afterwards (from about 1630)
a prison for those condemned to death, adorned with sadly damaged
frescoes, ascribed to Giotto, but perhaps executed after the fire in
1337 by his pupils (restored after 1840).

of weaving and embroidery and handsome ecclesiastical vestments

bequeathed by C. Reumann (1900), the statesman. The two central
cases contain carvings in ivory. In the first are two triptychs by
Baldassare degli Embriarchi (p. 145); leaf of a consular triptych of
Basilius (Mi); bishop's staff (14th cent); statuette of the Madonna

beru, and the same by Fit. anelteschi, the earliest Renaissance
sculptures, produced in their competition for the execution of the
gates of the Baptistery (p. 451). The composition of Ghiberti is
the less harmonious but the calmer of the two. Its dignified draped
figures, especially that of Isaac, are full of a true antique feeling
for beauty, while in Brunelleschi's relief the principal figures are
represented in violent movement, and Isaac is besides remarkably
ugly. The subordinate figures, including the ram, are also in positions of over--strained activity. In technical execution Ghiberti is
superior. 14, 15. Crucifixion (relief) and a small Frieze of children
