Italian Art.

A Historical Sketch by Professor Anton Springer.



One of the primary objects of the enlightened traveller in Italy
is usually to form some acquaintance with its treasures of art.
Even those whose usual evocation: are of the most prosaic
nature unconsciously become admirers of poetry and art in
Italy. The traveller here finds them so interwoven with scenes of
everyday life, that he encounters their influence at every step, and
involuntarily becomes susceptible to their power. A single visit
an hardly suffice to enable any one justly to appreciate the
numerous works of art he meets with in the course of his tour, nor
can a guide-book teach him to fathom the mysterious depths of
Italian creative genius, the past history of which is particularly attractive; but the perusal of a few remarks on this subject will be
found materially to enhance the pleasure and facilitate the researches
of even the most unpretending lover of art. Works of the highest class,
the most perfect creations of genius, lose nothing of their charm by
being pointed out as specimens of the best period of art; while
those of inferior merit are invested with far higher interest when
they are shown to be necessary links in the chain of development,
and when, on comparison with audit" or later works, their relative
defects or superiority are recognised. The following observations,
therefore, will hardly be deemed out of place in a work designed to
aid the traveller in deriving the greatest possible amount of enjoyment and instruction from his sojourn in Italy.

The two great epochs in the history of art which principally

error to suppose that in Italy alone the character of ancient art can

precise distinction was made between Week and Roman art, when
the connection of the former with a particular land and nation,
and the tendency of the latter to pursue an independent course
were alike overlooked. Now, however, that we are acquainted
with more numerous Greek originals, and have acquired a
deeper insight into the development of Hellenic art, an indis
