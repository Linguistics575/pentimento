or Baflsllo is a larger craft, carrying 8 persons. The heavy ndented piron
row (jerro) resembling a halberd, is partly intended to counterbalance the
weight of the rower, and partly as ameasure of the height of the bridges,
which cannot be passed unless the ferro, the highest part of the craft,

which he stands.'Caoar ll felss' menu'to remove the cabin or covering'.

the visitor should select one for himself, disregarding all profi'ers of
assistance. The owner of the selected boat will immediately present
himself, and the visitor should then indicate what he is willing to pay,
