*Portrait of a lady;'Portraits of two men.

'The fine-chiselled features (of the lady), extremely pure in drawing,
Charm by their mild expression. A delicate but healthy com lexion is
displayed in warm sweet tones of extraordinary transparence; an masterly
transitions lead the eye from opal lights into rich and coloured shadows.
A half length in the same collection represents a man of law and bony
make with a swallow-tailed beard, a grey eye, close set features, and a
grave aspect.... A third half length, companion to these, offers another
variety of type and execution. A man stands at a table in a pelisse with
a fox skin collar; he is bare-headed and bearded. His right hand rests
on the table and grips a handkerchief. The ruddy aim of the face is
broken with touches now warm now cold by which the play of light and
reflections is rendered with deceptive truth'. - th It J.

'It is a dpicture'in which Mantegna's grandest style is impressed,
s, i, uL, t2 with disagreeable boldness, but with sur rising truth,
studied from nature, and imitating light shade, and re action with a
carefulness and perseverance only equalled by Leonardo and Diirer; displaying at the same time an excess of tragic realism, and a painful unattractiveness in nu me- of the faces of the Marys.'--0. d: 0'.
