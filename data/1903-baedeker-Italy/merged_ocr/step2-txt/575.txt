396 Route lid. 130300 SAN LORENZO.

The RAILWAY xo FLORENCE describes a wide curve round Faenza,
and by means of a short tunnel passes from the plain into the broad
valley of the Immune (p. 395), which it continues to ascend, frequently crossing the stream, to the ridge of the Apennines.

40 M. Brisighella (375 ft.), a pleasant town with 13,815 inhab.,
situated, with its pretty villa, on the left bank of the river on a
mountain-slope crowned with a castle. - 421/2 M. Fem. We
traverse three tunnels.

At (53 M.) Marradi (1045 ft.) the mountains approach nearer
to each other. On the conical mountain-peak to the right is a ruined
castle. We now cross to the right bank, but recross the stream by a lofty
viaduct, and traverse six tunnels more. 56 M. Fantino-Palazzuolo.

Beyond (59 M.) Crespino, we enter the main tunnel of the line
(21/2 M. long; 5 min. transit), which pierces the ridge of the Apennines. The highest point of the line (1890 ft.) is reached in its
middle. The line now rapidly descends and the long Monsagnano
Tunnel (11/4 M.) brings us to the narrow, mountain-enclosed valley
of the Rossolo, which we soon quit by another series of tunnels to
enter the valley of the Elm at the church of Madonna dei Tre Fiumi.

Beyond (671/2 M.) Bonta the train leaves the valley of the Elsa,
and runs through a fertile hilly district to (701/2 M.) Panicaglia. The
beds of several torrents are spanned by large bridges and viaducts.

721/2 M. Barge San Lorenzo (605 ft; Alb. del Sale) is the chief
place (14,784 inhabO in the Mugello, a beautiful wide valley, enclosed by lofty mountains, on the W. slope of the Central Apennines. The valley is watered by the Sieve, which joins the Arno at
Pontassieve (p. 530).

The train crosses the stream a little before reaching (751/2 M.)
San Hero a Sieve, and then, following the monotonous valley of the
Cured, ascends the S.W. longitudinal chain of the Apennines, which
culminates in the Monte Giovi (3255 ft.) and the Monte Manila
(3065 ft.; p. 526). After traversing two tunnels, we reach (80 M.)
Vaglia, on the highroad from Bologna to Florence (p. 382). Ascent
of the Monte Morello, see p. 526; of the Monte Senario, p. 529. Th ree more short tunnels. To the left we catch a momentary glimpse
of the Monte Senario, with its convent (p. 529).

A tunnel, 21/4 M. in length, now pierces the E. spur of the
Monte Morello; and beyond another short tunnel we reach (85 M.)
Montorsoli (p. 529) .--- Four more tunnels. To the right is a view
of the valley of the Mugnone, with the lower part of the railway;
in the distance, Florence and its hills. We cross the Mugnone to
89 M. Le Caldine, on the left bank. Below the station the valley
contracts between the hills of Monterinaldi, on the right, and Final!
(p. 527), on the left. Two tunnels. We finally descend the right
bank of the Mugnone to the well-tilled valley of the Arno.'

941/2 M. Florence, see p. 431.
