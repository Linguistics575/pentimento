of John the Baptist. The first scene, Zacharias in the Temple, is celebrated
for the number of portraits which are introduced in a remarkably any
And lifelike manner. The figures below to the left are said to be portraits

A door to the right of the steps to the Strozzi Chapel (opened by the
sacristan; 80-50 c.) admits to the so-called Scpolcreto, or burial vault, with
an open colonnade and frescoes of the 14th century. To the left we enter
the Ancient Cloisters, called 11 Chiouro Verde, restored in 1895. The E.
wul is adorned with old and much injured frescoes in term verde (different
shades of green). Those in the three first lunettes, representing the Creation,
the Expulsion from Paradise, Cain and Abel, and the Building of the Ark,
