LEGHORN. M. Route. 401

Leghorn (Ital. Livorno, French Ltvourne), which was a very
insignificant place in the 16th cent. (in 1551 only 749 inhab.), now
the capital of a province, the seat of the Royal Marine Academy,
and the most important commercial place in Italy after Genoa, is
indebted for its size and importance to the Medici, who invited
hither the oppressed and discontented from all parts of the continent, as, for example Roman Catholics from England, Jews and
Moors from Spain and Portugal, and merchants from Marseilles, who
were anxious to escape from the perils of civil war. Montesquieu
consequently calls Leghorn'the masterpiece of the dynasty of the
Medici'. The town is uncompromisingly modern and has no important monuments of art. The population amounts to 96,628 (many
Jews), exclusive of a fluctuating sea--faring community of fully
3000. Leghorn Genie: on a brisk trade with the Levant in cotton,
wool, and unbleached silk, and with the Black See in grain and
petroleum. The most important industrial establishments are the
ship-building yard of the Brothers Orlando (p. 402), the Metallargiea Italiana (a large iron-foundry), the large glass-works in
