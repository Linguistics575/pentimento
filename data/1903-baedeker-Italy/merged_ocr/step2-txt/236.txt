Brera. MILAN. 19. Route. 123

In the Via del Monte di Pieta, the second side-street on the right,
is the handsome Cassa diRisparmio, or savings-bank, by Balzaretti.
--The Via di Brera, forming a prolongation of the Via Giuseppe
Verdi, leads to the
*Palano di Brera. (Pl. E, 3; No. 28), built for a Jesuit college
by Ricchini in 1651 et seq., since 1776 the seat of the Accademia
di Belle Arti, and now styled Palazzo di Salome, Lettere ed Arti.
It contains the Picture Gallery described below, the Library founded
in 1770 (300,000 vole; Lim., see p. 115, the Beale Gabinctto
Wumismatieo, or Collection of Coins (50,0, Adm, see p. 115),
and the Observatory, founded in 1766.

In the centre of the handsome COURT is a bronze statue of
Napoleon A, as a Roman emperor, by Canova, considered one of
his fined works (1859). By the staircase, to the left, the statue of
the celebrated jurist Cesare Beccaria (1738-94), who was the first
scientific questioner of the wisdom of capital punishment. The
court is also adorned with several other statues.

The staircase ascends to the first floor, on which is the'PICTURB
GALLERY or PinacotEca, founded in 1806. Adm, see p. 115); catalogue
(1901), 11/2 fr. Director, Dr. Corrado Ricci. The collection has
been greatly enlarged and also re-arranged since 1901. In our
description below we follow the new arrangement. - The gem of
the collection is Raphael's Sposalizio (Room XXIII), the chief
work of his first or Umbrian period. The numerous pictures of
the Lombard school, and particularly the frescoes sewn out of
churches, are also very valuable. The authenticity of the Head of
Christ (R. XIV) ascribed to Leon. da Vinci is open to considerable
doubt. The Madonna in a bower of roses (R. XV) is the best of the
oil-paintings by Bernardino Luini, and the best of his frescoes are
the Madonna with M. Anthony and Barber: (R. 11) and the Burial
of St. Catharine (R. XV). The most interesting works of the early
Italian school are those by Mantegna, in R. VIII. The collection
also afl'ords an instructive survey of the progress of Carlo Crivelli
(R. VIII), a master who flourished in 1468-93 and connects the
Paduan school with that of Venice. The most notable works of the
latter school are The Preaching of St. Mark by Gentile Bellini (R. V),
three works by Giovanni Bellini (R. VIII), and three by Oima da
Conegliano (R. T); and of a later period The Finding of Moses by
Bonifaaio I. (R. V), the Portrait of Porch and the "Jerome by
Titian (R. AT), Tintoretto's Finding of the body of "Mark (R. IV),
and the admirable series of portraits by Lorenzo Lotto (R. V11),
dulled by Giov. Butt. Moroni of Bergamo (R. 111). Of Correggio the
collection now possesses an admirable early work (R. XVIII). Domeniehina end Guanine (R. XVII) represent the Italian masters of the
17th century. The most important works of foreign schools are
The Last Supper by Rubens, and the portraits of ladies by Van Dyck
and by Rembrandt (R. XXVIII).
