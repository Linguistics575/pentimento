buildings, Florence had hardly begun to exist. Florence was first indebted
for its progress to the fact that it lay on the great route from the north

Great many German knights settled here, and at a later period several
noble families traced their origin from German ancestors. The enterprising citizens soon conquered the central and upper part of the valley
of the Arno, which the situation of their town enabled them to do, and
their arms were afterwards attended with farther successes.'While the
rest of Italy was gradually suffering dismemberment and throwing off the
trammels of its earlier traditions, Florence was still quietly developing her
resources, and was thus soon enabled to take possession of the inheritance
of the earlier culture achieved by other towns. After her extensive
commerce had in a great measure raised her above the narrow aims of
her ancient life, she began to suffer. like the rest of Italy, from the
dissensions of a number of wild factions, but the more earnest character
of the citizens enabled them more effectually to grapple with these difficulties. Florence may be said to resemble a man of unusual strength,
whose physical development bu been but tardy; and thus it was that
she became the mistress of Tuscany'. (Leo). In 1350, among her other
