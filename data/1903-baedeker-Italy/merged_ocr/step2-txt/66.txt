and painting. Nor is an inspection of this illustrious master's
works calculated to dispel the doubt. Unnatural and arbitrary
features often appear in juxtaposition with what is perfect, profoundly significant, and faithfully conceived. As in the case of
Leonardo, we shall find that it is only by studying the master's biography that we can obtain an explanation of these anomalies, and
reach a true appreciation of Michael Angelo's artistic greatness.
Educated as a sculptor, he exhibits partiality to the nude, and
treats the drapery in many respects differently from his professional
brethren. But, like them, his aim is to inspire his figures with life,
and he seeks to attain it by imparting to them an imposing and impressive character. At the same time he occupies an isolated position,
at variance with many of the tendencies of his age. Naturally predisposed to melancholy, concealing a gentle and almost effeminate
temperament beneath a mask of austerity, Michael Angelo was conflrmed in his peculiarities by the political and ecclesiastical circumstances of his time, and wrapped himself up within the depths of
his own absorbing thoughts. His sculpture most clearly manifests
that profound sentiment to which, however, he often sacrificed symmetry of form. His figures are therefore anomalous, exhibiting a
grand conception, but no distinct or tangible thoughts, and least of
all the traditional ideas. It is difficult now to fathom the hidden
sentiments which the master intended to embody in his statues and
pictures; his imitators seem to have seen in them nothing but massive
and clumsy form s, and soon degenerated into meaningless mannerism.
The deceptive effect produced by Michael Angelo's style is best exemplified by some of his later works. His Mans in San Pietro in
Vincoli is of impossible proportions; such a man can never have
existed; the small head, the huge arms, and the gigantic torso are
utterly disproportionate; the robe which falls over the celebrated
knee could not be folded as it is represented. Nevertheless the
work is grandly impressive; and so also are the Monuments of the
Medici in the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo at Florence (p. 500),
in spite of the forced attitude and arbitrary moulding of some of
the "urea. Michael Angelo only sacrifices accuracy of detail in
order to enhance the aggregate effect. Had so great and talented a
master not presided over the whole, the danger of an inflated style
would have been incurred, the forms selected would have been
exaggerated, and a professional mannerism would have been the
result. Michael Â« Angelo's numerous pupils, in their anxiety to
follow the example of his Last Judgment in the Sistine, succeeded
only in representing complicated groups of unnaturally foreshortened nude figures, while Baccio Bandinelli, thinking even to surpass
Michael Angelo, produced in his group of Hercules and Cam: (in
the Piazza della Signoria at Florence) a mere caricature of his model.

Michael Angelo lived and worked at Florence and Rome alternately. We find him already in Rome at the age of 21 years (1496),
