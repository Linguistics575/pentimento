11. Period and Plan of Tour.

Season. As a general rule, the spring and autumn months are
the best season for a tour in North Italy, especially April and May
or September and October. Winter in Lombardy (apart from a few
favoured spots on the shore: of the lakes) and Piedmont is generally
a much colder season than it is in England, but the Ligurian Riviera
(Genoa excepted) afl'ords pleasant and sheltered quarters. The
height of summer can hardly be recommended for travelling. The
scenery, indeed, is then in perfection, and the long days are hailed
with satisfaction by the enterprising traveller; but the fierce rays of
an Italian sun seldom fail to impair the physical and mental energies.

Plan. The following short itinerary, beginning and ending at
Milan, though very far from exhausting the beauties of North Italy,
includes'most of the places usually visited, with the time required
for a glimpse at each.
