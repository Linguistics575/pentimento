Riva degli Schiavoni. VENICE. 42. Route. 283

the above-mentioned passage to the Font, a series of gloomy dungeons, with a torture-chamber and the place of execution for political criminals. Too much sentiment need not hamleted on the
Bridge of Sighs, as the present structure--that'pathetic swindle'
as Mi. Howells calls it -, serving merely as a means of communication between the Criminal Court! end the Criminal Prison, has
probably never been crossed by any prisoner whose name is worth
remembering or whose fate deserved our sympathy.

A good survey of the Bridge of Sighs and of the handsome E.
side of the Doges' Palace, more harmonious in appearance than the
W. side, with a basement of facetted stone, is obtained from the
Ponte di Canonica (p. 301) or from the Pants delta Paglia, which
connects the Mole with the'Biva degli Schiavoni (PLH, I, 5;
'quay of the Dalmatians'), a quay paved with unpolished marble.
This quay presents a busy scene, being the most popular and
sunniest lounge in Venice. In 1887 it was embellished with an
equestrian Statue of Victor Emmanuel 11., by E. Ferrari; at the
back of the pedestal is Venetia enslaved, in front Venetia liberated.
The Hotel Daniel! (p. 269) was the home of Alfred de Musset and
Georges Sand in 1833. - Beyond the next bridge rise: in the high-choir, above
the principal entrance, *Christ in the house of the Pharisee by
Moretto (1544); on the ceiling, Victory of the Faith, by Tiepolo.
Near this church is the Cam del Pete-area, presented by the Republic
to Petrarch in 1362.

For the adjoining churches of 8. Zaccaria, S. Giorgio dei Greci,
and 8. Giovanni in Bragora, see pp. 301, 305; for the Arsenal,
8. Biagio, and the Giardini Pubblici, see p. 306.

b. The Academy.

The "Aeead√©mia a Belle Arti (Pl. E, 6) occupies the old Scuola
di Santa Maria della Carita, the assembly-hall of this, the oldest
brotherhood in Venice (founded 1260), which lies on the Grand
Usual, close by the iron bridge (steamboat-station, p. 261), and
may be reached on foot from the Piazza of St. Mark in 10 min.
f'mop. p. 315). The entrance is to the right, under a figure of
Winery: with the lion, whence we ascend the staircase. Admission,
see p. 265; catalogue (1900), 1 fr. Director, Signor Cantalamessa.

The gallery, which was founded in 1798, chiefly contains
) ictures by Venetian masters, and possesses many works of the first
: lass, besides an abundance of mediocre paintings. The ordinary
visitor will be most interested in the canvases of the Bellini and
he great masters of the following period. The historical paintings
) y Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaecio in Rooms XV and XVI
tresent a lifelike picture of ancient Venice, while the brilliance
f their colouring makes us forget the poverty of their execution
