We next cross the Lys and follow the broad valley, flanked

of Savoy after a long siege, while in May, 1800, before the battle of
Marengo, it was gallantly defended by 400 Austrians, who kept the
French army in check for a week. The train then crosses the Dora

The valleys of Ann. and Sun (p. M) were alternately occupied by
the Franks and the Longobards, and belonged to the Franconian Empire,
