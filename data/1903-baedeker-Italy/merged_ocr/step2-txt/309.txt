by the erection of a chateau and the laying out of a garden. The
huge unfinished Chateau contains a series of handsome receptionrooms, a gallery hung with Flemish tapestry of the 17th cent., and
a collection of paintings, mainly copies but including a few good
Lombard works (Boltraffio, Portrait; Gianpietrino, Lucretia and
Cleopatra). The private chapel (adm. by special introduction only)
contains the handsome Renaissance tombs of Counts Camille and
Giovanni Borromeo, the latter partly by pupils of Amadeo. - The
beautiful Garden, laid out in the old Italian style, rises in ten terraces
100 ft. above the lake, and is stocked with lemon-trees, cedars,
magnolias, orange-trees, laurels, cork-trees, camellias, magnificent
oleanders, and other luxuriant products of the south, while shellgrottoes, arbours, and statues meet the eye in profusion. The traveller coming from the N. cannot fail to be struck with the loveliness of the bank of the lake as seen from here, studded with
innumerable habitation,, and clothed with southern vegetation
(chestnuts, mulberries, vines, figs, olives), the extensive lake with
its deep blue waters and beautiful girdle of snowy mountains
combining the stern grandeur of the High Alps with the charms
of a southern dime. - The island is open to the public daily, except Mon., Wed., and Frid., from March 15th to Nov. 15th, from 9
to 3, 4, or b according to the season. A servant shows the apartments (fee 1/9 fin, for a party l fr.), and a gardener shows the garden

the summit is an uninhabited'Palazzo' (beautiful view). The island
is open to the public at the same times as the Isola Bella (fee to
