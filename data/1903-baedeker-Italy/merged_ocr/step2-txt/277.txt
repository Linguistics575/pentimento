The'Lake of Come (660 (L), Italian Lago di Como or n Latin,
the Lama Lariat of the Romans, is extolled by Virgil (Georg. ii. 159),
and is in the estimation of many the most beautiful lake in N. Italy.
Numerous village: and the gay villas of the Milanese aristocracy.
surrounded by luxuriant gardens and vineyards, are scattered along
its banks. In the forests above, the brilliant green of the, chestnut
and walnut contrasts strongly with the grayish tints of the olive.
The mountains rise to a height of 7000 ft. The lake, from Come
to the N. extremity, is 30 M. long; its greatest width, between
Menaggio and Varenna, nearly 21/2 M.; greatest depth 1540 ft; total
area 60 sq. M. At the Punta di Bellagio o. 157) the lake divides
into two branches, called respectively the Lake: of Como (W.) and
Lecco (E...) The Adda (p. 151) enters at the upper extremity and
makes its egress near Lecco. Owing to the narrow bed of the lake,
inundation, as at the Lago di Lugano, are not uncommon. -.- The
industrious inhabitants of the banks of the lake are much occupied
in the production and manufacture of silk. Tasteful articles in olive
wood are made at Bellagio."
