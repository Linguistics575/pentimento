the large circular Piazzalc Galileo (385 ft.; comp. Pl. 0, 8), is
continued as the Viola Galileo (side-path to the Torre a1 Gallo, see
. 523) along the slopes to San Miniato and the Piazsolc Michelangelo
fsee below). Lastly, under the name of Viola Michelangelo (Pi. G,
H, 8), it descends in a long curve to the river, where it terminate:
"the Ponte in Ferro, Ben the Barriers San Niccolb (P1. H, 8).
This road, which is 60 ft. wide and nearly 33/4 M. in length, is
bordered with charming pleasure-grounds, containing bays, elms,
sycamores, and hedges of roses, over which delightful views are
obtained. - Part of the Ville dei Colli is traversed by the electric
tramway No. 8 (p. 434). The Piazzale Michelangelo and San Miniato
are, however, more speedily reached from the Pom S. Niccolo
(p. 520), which is passed by the electric tramway No. 7 (p. 434).
Non San Miniato the road passes the large *Piunle Hiehelangelo (340 ft.; P1. F, G, 8), forming a kind of projecting terrace
5 min. from the Ports 8. Niccolo (p. 520). In the Piazzale caferestaurant) rises a bronze copy of Michael Angelo's David (p. 93),
the pedestal of which is surrounded by the four periods of the day
(p. 500). Charming'Vmw: to the N.E., on the hill, lies Fiesole;
then the city with S. Maria Novella, and the Lungarno; to the left are the villacovered heights, the Fortezza del Belvedere, and the Monte Oliveto.
(b.) SAN anm, with its light-coloured marble facade, on
the hill to the SE. of Florence, is a conspicuous object from many
different points. It may be reached in a few minutes by the road
and footpath diverging to the right from the Ville Galileo (see
above), just before the Piazzale Michelangelo. The footpath passes
the secularized Franciscan monastery of Ban Salvatore or San
Francesco a1 Monte (Pl. F, G, 8), with a church erected by Cronaca
in 1475-1504, the simple and chute proportions of which were
deservedly praised by Michael Angelo, who called it'la bella villanella'. On the high-altar is a Crucifixion With SS. Mary, John, and
Francis, and above the left side-portal, a Pieta in the style of Giov.
delta Robbin, in painted terracotta. - We now ascend towards the
gateway of the old fortifications, constructed by Michael Angelo in
1529 as engineer to the republic, and defended by him during an'
eleven months' siege of the city by the Imperial troops. Duke
Cosimo I. converted the hill into a regular fort in 1552. Visitors
ring at the gate and bestow a gratuity of 15-20 0. on leaving. The
eh urch end the whole hill, the so-called Monte alle Croci, have been
used since 1839 as a Burial Ground (flue views, especially from
the S. wall of the cemetery). The monuments show the taste of

accurate rendering of clothes, lace, ornaments, and the like, and
whose skill finds numerous admirers. _
