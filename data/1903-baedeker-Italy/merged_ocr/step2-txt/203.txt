Its mean winter temperature (52" Fahr.) is almost the same as that 01
the W. Riviera, but the rainfall at Nervi is more copious and the periods
of dry weather less prolonged. The relative moisture of the three white:
months is 63 per cent.

Nervi, a small town with 6317 inhab., surrounded with grove:
of olives, oranges, and lemons, is much frequented in winter b,
English and Germans, as a health-resort. The Viale Vittorit
Emanuele, with its fine palms, leads to the N. from the railway
station to the (3 min.) town, which is intersected from W. to E. b:
the highroad, here called Via Cavour (to the W.) and Via del Pow
(to the E.). In the Via Cavour are the Giardino Pubblico (left) am
the Villa Croce (N o. 113; right); in the Via del Pozzo are the beautiful Park of the Marches Gropallo (entrance No. 55, fee 1/2 fr.' some
times closed), with an old watch-tower on the Coast Promenade
and the Villa Serra. All these are noteworthy for their luxurian
vegetation (orange-trees, aloes, palms, etc.).

A feature of the place is the dust-free and sunny l" Coast Promenade, which runs along the shore above the rocky beach, and it,
protected by a lofty wall on the landward side. Pleasantly placed
benches on the promenade and in the adjoining gardens afford resting-places for patients who wish to be much in the open air without
taking active exercise.

Pubblico. - A rough footpath, beginning at the W. and of the town
ascends the Nerm' Valley to (3/4 hr.) some mills. - The ascent of Hall

101/2 M. Sari (65 ft.) is beautifully situated at the mouth or
pretty valley, up which a road runs to (13/4 M.) Canepa. We enjo
a noble survey of sea and valley from the viaduct which passe
high above the town and rivulet.
