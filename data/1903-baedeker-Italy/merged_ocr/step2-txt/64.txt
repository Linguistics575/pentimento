(p. 222) .--The earlier masters of the Venetian School (Vivanmr,
Guyana) were to some extent adherents of the Paduan school, to
which Mantegna belonged, but the peculiar Venetian style, mainly
founded on local characteristics, and admirably successful in its rich
portraiture of noble and dignified personages, was soon afterwards
elaborated by Game Bun!" (1427-1507) and his brother Grovam (1428-1516), sons of Giacomo. - The Umbrian School also,
which originated at Gubbio, and is admirably represented early in
the 15th century by OrravIANO NBLLI, blending with the Tuscan
school in GBZNTILB nA FAnnrANo (ca. 1370-1428) and culminating

pure enough to be regarded as embodiments of the highest and
noblest conceptions. The figures still present a local colouring,
having been selected by the artists as physically attractive, rather
than as characteristic and expressive of their Men. A portrait style
still predominates, the actual representation does not appear
always wisely balanced with the internal significance of the' event,
and the dramatic element is insufficiently emphasised. The most
