*Chiesa degli Scalai (Pl. D, 3:
steamboat-station, see p. Mi),
the former church of the barefooted friars, begun in 1649 by
Longhena, with a fine facade
added by' Sardi in 1683-89,
is perhaps the most imposing
specimen of the Venetian baroque
style. It was much damaged by
the bombardment 0131849, but was
restored in 1863-62.

The ceiling is decorated with a
large fresco by Tiepolo, representing
the miraculous removal of the house
of the Virgin to Loreto. The high »
altar, by Git". Pane, with its eight
twisted columns, is a characteristic
example of the architectonic perversities of the age of its construction.

Adjoining the Scalzi is the Ponte £119. Stazione (Pl. D, 3), or
station-bridge, completed in 1858.

San Simeonc Piccolo (Pl. D, 3, l Stazione delta Strada Ferrata

Min). 1 tn), a handsome but neglected edifice by Amir. (1720-50), with *Frescoes by Tiepolo in the principal hall on the
first floor (Antony and Cleopatra) .--Farther on, to the left, is the

Pal. Manfrin, formerly celebrated for its picture gallery.

Opposite, on the right side of the canal, is the Ghetto Vecchio
(PI. D, E, 2), with its high, many-storied houses, long the quarter

of the Jews, who were originally settled in the Giudecca. The
Tempio Israelitico Spagnuolo (Pl. E, 2), or synagogue of the Spanish
Jews (p. 266), was rebuilt by Longhena in 1655. Following the
