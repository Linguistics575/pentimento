the cause of Hannibal after which, 3.0. 189, it was converted into a
Roman colony, a little before Parma and Mutina (Modena), by the consul

Bologna acted a very prominent part in the contest: of the Guelphs

a comparatively late period. In the Gothic era it at length became anbitious of possessing within its walls the largest church in Italy. To
this ambition it was indebted for San.Petrom'o, which, had it been completed, would have surpassed in size all the other cathedrals in Italy.
