The monastery of Vallombrosa was founded by San Giovanni Gualberto
(85-1073), the scion of a wealthy and powerful family of Florence, who after
a career of youthful profligacy resolved to devote the remainder of his life
to the most austere acts of penance. His brother Hugo hung fellen by
the knife of an assassin, Gualberto was bound by the customs of the age
to follow the bloody law of retaliation. Descending one Good Friday
from the church of Bin mum neu Florence, accompanied by armed followers, he suddenly encountered the assassin at a narrow part of the
road. The latter fell at his feet and implored mercy. The knight
forgave his enemy, and led him to Ban Miniato, where he himself assumed
the cowl. Finding the discipline there too lax, however, he betook himself
to this lonely spot and founded Vallombroaa.

It Paradisino (3336 no, a small hermitage situated on a rock
1/4 hr. to the left above the monastery, is now an annexe to the Alb.

buildings, and of the broad valley of the Arno as far as Florence, half
of the cathedral-dome of which is visible behind a hill. The horizon
is bounded by the Alpi Apuane (p. 106) .--- Another pleasant walk
may be taken on the road leading from the hotel towards the N.E.
