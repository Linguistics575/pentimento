The village of Solferino (375 ft.) lien on the S.W. margin of the hills
bordering the Lago as and; on the S., about 71/2 11. to the B. of Desenzano
and about 5 M. to the 8.W. of San Martino. It formed the centre of the
Austrian position, and was taken about 1 p.m. by the French guards. The
height » of Sen Martino to the N.E. were old by General Benedek, who
repulsed the attacks of the Piedmontese until nightfall, and only abandoned
his position on receiving the order to retreat. The left wing of the
Austrian army, attacked by the French under General Mel, also maintained
its position until late in the afternoon .--Hurried travellers content
themselves with a visit to the Town of Ban Martino, 3 ], M. to the S.
of the railway-station of that name (see p. IN). This structure, erected
to commemorate the battle of Solferino and converted into a military
museum in 1893, stands upon a platform 65 ft. in width and rises to a
height of 243 ft. We first enter a circular chamber, in the centre of
which is a statue by Ant. Dal Zotto, representing Victor Emmanuel 11.
as the commander of the Italian troops at Solferino. On the walls are
scenes from the life of the King, and on the vaulting are eight allegorical
figures representing the chief mice or Italy, all painted in wax-colours
by Vi". The side-chapels contain hunt: "the at ht Italian
generals who fell in the were of independence. From the roun chamber
an easy staircase, ascending through two passages, with bronze tablets
containing the mum; of the 650,000 fighters for the unity of Italy, leads
to seven rooms, one above another, each containing a battle-painting
and reminiscences of one of the seven campaigns of the were. From
the uppermost room we emerge on the platform of the tower, which
not only commands the battlefield (chief points indicated by arrow!) but
