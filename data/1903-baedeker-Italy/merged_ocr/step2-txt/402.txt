found abundant occupation here. The native artiste were introduced to
the antique by the classical scholars; and the school of art founded here by
Francesco Squarcione (1397-1474) exhibits a peculiar 40mm" character.
Squarcione, though not a professional artist, made a valuable collection of
works of art during his travels, and caused young artists to make drawings from these models. The austere style peculiar to the Paduan pictures
is perhaps due to this doctrinaire training of the "mu And to the influence of Donatello. The greatest master of the Paduan school, which
materially influenced that of Venice in the 15th cent, was Andrea Mantegna (p. 236), who exhibits an almost northern, Albrecht-Ditrer-lilre
severity of style The chief work of his early period is in the church
of the Eremitani. A distinguishing characteristic of the school is its
predilection for richness of decoration, for which Squarcione's collection
doubtless supplied abundant models.

From the Main Railway Station (Pl. D, I) we follow the tramway-line through the Barriers Mazzini and across the piazza of that
name (Pl. c, 2) to the (6 min.) centre of the town. - In the adjoining szza Paraanca rises a monument to Petrarch, erected
by the town on 18th June, 1874, the 500th anniversary of his death.
- On the N. side of the piazza stand the small, aisleless Church of
iCarmint and the Scuola del Carmine (Pl. o, 2; now a baptistery;
sacristan in the cloisters), with sadly-damaged 16th cent. frescoes
from the lives of Christ and St. Joachim, Anna, and Mary.
