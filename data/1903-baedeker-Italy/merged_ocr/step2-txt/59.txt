VENEE- the last of the great Renaissance architects, whose Venetian
churches (San Giorgio Maggiore and Redentore) and Vicentine palaces
are equally celebrated. The fundamental type of domestic architecture at Venice teams with little variation. The nature of the
ground afforded little scope for the caprice of the architect,
while the conservative spirit of the inhabitants inclined them to
adhere to the style established by custom. Nice distinctions of style
are therefore the more observable, and that which emanated from
a pure sense of form the more appreciable. Those who have been
convinced by careful comparison of the great superiority of the
Bibliotcca of Sansovino (in the Piazzetta; p. 276) over the new
Procuraaic of Scamoui (p. 271), although the two edifices exactly
correspond in many respects, have made great progress towards an
accurate insight into the architecture of the Renaissance.
Much, however, would be lost by the traveller who devoted his
Mmom Attention exclusively to the master-works which have been
Wokn or extolled from time immemorial, or solely to the great monART- umental structures. As even the insignificant vases (majolicas, manufactured at Pesaro, Urbino, Gubbio, Faenza, and
Castel-Durante) testify to the taste of the Italians, their partiality
for classical models, and their enthusiasm for purity of form, so
also in interior works, some of which fall within the province of a
mere handicraft, the peculiar beauties of the Renaissance style are
often detected, and charming specimens of architecture are sometimes discovered in remote corners of Italian towns. Nor must the
vast domain of decorative sculpture be disregarded, as such works,
whether in metal, stone, or stucco, inlaid or carved wood (intarsiag,

On the whole it may be asserted that the architecture of the Renaissance, which in obedience to the requirements of modern life

different. The Italian architecture of the 15th and 16th centuries
still possesses a practical value and is frequently imitated at'the
present day; and painting undoubtedly attained its highest consummation at the same period; but the sculpture of the Reade;
