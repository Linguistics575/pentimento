omen, although the Roman language and customs had spread rapidly here,
the district was officially known as the'Province of Gun! on this side of
the Po', and the Rubicon formed the frontier of Italy; but in mot As "
was finally united with the latter.

The institutions of antiquity 1in ered here longer than in any other
art of Italy. In 402 the Emperor onorius transferred his residence to
avenna, which also continued to be the capital of the Gothic kings.

Roman Empire. The Lombard: afterwards attacked and took possession
of it, but it was soon wrested from them by the Frankish king Pom,
who is said to have presented the whole exarchate, ale. the coast-district
from the Po to Amen, to the Romish Church in 755. At first, however,
the real supremacy over the district was held by the Archbishop of Br
Venna. The Suns or ran Cannon never constituted a uniform whole
like those of Milan or Venice. They waisted of a number of towns,
principalities, and monasteries, often estranged from the pontifical throne,
and not unfrequently in arms against it. The pope appointed cardinals as
his legates in the different districts, but their power was limited, since the
most important prerogatives were usurped by his subjects. Meanwhile
the Towns in the Emit" prospered greatly, and became famous as cradle
of SCIENCE, notwithstanding the feud between Guelphs and Ghibellines,
princes, nobles, and burghers, which raged within and without their walls.
Roman Law, which after the Germanic invasion had been preserved in
several towns and districts, be studied scientifically at Rewind
'in the 11th century. From the 12th cent. onwards, owing to the unsettled
condition of rights, the study became very prevalent, Bologna being its
great centre, whence a knowledge of Roman Law gradually extended over
the other countries of Europe (comp. p. 364.

The Pomrrcsn' HISTORY of these districts during the middle ages re
cords continual struggles for precedence among several rival powers. A!
long as the power of the emperors was in the ascendant, they kept the
pretensions of the pope: in check. Nicholas m. was the first pope to

0an control of the entire Romagna (in 1278). During the exile of the
popes at Avignon, the dismemberment of the papal dominion, seemed
imminent, but after protracted combats it was prevented by Cardinal dur
hornet, a valiant Spaniard who was sent to Italy by Innocent I V. in 1353, Even those princes, however, who comma to acknowledge the papal
supremacy, still continued practically independent. It is difficult to m
how often the stubborn citizens of Relegna were subdued by the papal,
only to rise again in successful revolt. Alexander V ]. and his son Cum
same It length put an end to this insubOrdination about 1499; they
.extirpated the dynasties of the Romagna with fire and sword, and from
that period the papal ilefs began to be gradually converted into a state
in the modern sense. Under Julius II. And Leo t the pa Al supremacy
.was farther extended to Modena, Fame, and Piacenza.' In 545 Paul III.
-Famcsc invested Pier Luigi, his natural son, with the last two as a duchya
which, on the extinction of the Farnese in 1731, came into the possession
of the Spanish Bourbons. In Modena and Reggie, the house of. Eric main'tained its supremacy in spite of the papal pretensions, while Ferrara in
1597 was incorporated with the Slit" or the Church. a

The whole of the existing institutions were at length overthrown by
the French Revolution. NAPOLEON united Parma to France, and annexed
Modena and the Romagna to his kingdom of Italy. Though thus under
foreign domination, the country now enjoyed a period of active and useful
internal reform, which, however, was rudely interrupted by the fall of
Napoleon and the establishment of Austrian supremacy over these districts.
Parma was awarded to Hart's Louise, and Modena to Archduke hands, the
heir of the last Este (who died in 1803 with the title of Duke "Brown) The wont let betel the Romagna, in spite of the entreaty addressed by

site ambassadors at the Congress of Visual, rather to hand over their
country to an'infernal than to the papal overnment'. By an edict of 15th
