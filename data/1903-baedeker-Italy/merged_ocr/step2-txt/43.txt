xxxii ITALIAN ART.

criminate confusion of Greek and Roman styles is no longer to be
Gnu "m apprehended. We are now well aware that the highest perRomuz fection of ancient architecture is realised in the Humane
SH"! DIB-t temple alone The Dorie order, in which majestic gravity is
""9""" 9' expressed by massive proportions and by a symmetrical decoration, which at the same time subserves a practical purpose,
and the Ionic structure, with its lighter and more graceful character, exhibit a creative spirit entirely different from that manifested in the sumptuous Roman edifices. Again, the most valuable
collection of ancient sculptures in Italy is incapable of aflording so
admirable an insight into the development of Greek art as the sculptures of the Parthenon and other fragments of Greek temple-architecture preserved in the British Museum. But, while instruction is
afforded more abundantly by other than Italian sources, ancient art
is perhaps thoroughly admired in Italy alone, where works of art
encounter the eye with more appropriate adjuncts, and where climate,
scenery, and people materially contribute to intensify their impressiveness. An additional facility, moreover, is afforded by the circumstance, that in accordance with an admirable custom of classic
antiquity the once perfected type of a plastic figure was not again
arbitrarily abandoned, but rigidly adhered to, and continually reproduced. Thus in numerous cases, where the more ancient Greek
original had been lost, it was preserved in subsequent copies; and
even in the works of the Roman imperial age Hellenic creative talent
is still reflected.
This supremacy of Greek intellect in Italy was established in a
Gim me twofold manner. In the first place Greek colonists introsurnnmr rs duced their ancient native style into their new homes. This
A". is proved by the existence of several Dorie temples in Sicily,
by the so-called Temple of Neptune at Paestum, as well as by the
ruins "Metapontum. But, in the second place, the art of the Greeks
did not attain its universal supremacy in Italy till a later period,
when Hellas, nationally ruined, had learned to obey the dictates of
her mighty conqueror, and the Romans had begun to combine with
their political superiority the refinements of more advanced culture.
The ancient scenes of artistic activity in Greece (Athens for example)
became re--people'd at the cost of Rome; Greek works of art and
Greek artists were introduced into Italy; and ostentatious pride in
the magnificence of booty acquired by victory led by an easy transition to a taste for such objects. To surround themselves with artistic
decoration thus gradually became the universal custom of the Romans, and the foundation of public monuments came to be regarded
as an indispensable duty of government.
Although the Roman works of art of the imperial epoch are
Roman deficient in originality compared with the Greek, yet their
Anonr'rnc- authors never degenerate into mere copyists, or entirely reTUBE- nounce independent efl'ort. This remark applies especially to
