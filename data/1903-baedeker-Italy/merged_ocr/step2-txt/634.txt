and in 1321 died at Ravenna. Giovanni Baccacm, the first expounder of
the illustrious Dante and celebrated for his'Decamerone', which served
as a model for the'G" iiii; rii'G' Teles' of Chaucer, also lived at Florence.
Florence, too, was the chief cradle of the school of the Humanist: (15th
cent), who aimed at a universal and harmonious development of the personal character and whose contemplative life was far exalted above
every-day realities. This was the home of autumn, "mama 1mm, and
Harsuppini, the'Pagan', whose firmly moulded characters recall the personages of antiquity; it was here that the sources of classic literature were
re-discovered by Niccolo de' Niccoli, Traversan', and other enthusiastic collectors of books; it was here that the Platonic Academy developed the
study of the antique into a species of religious worship, and most of the
humanists, including Ficino, Poggio, Landint, Pica delta Mtrandola, and
Petition, who resided here for longer or shorter periods, received encouragement and distinction at Florence. Even after the decline of'humanism'
Florence continued to surpass the rest of ltaly in intellectual culture, as
the names of Machined", Vat-chi, Guiectardtni and Galileo testify.

In the development of the Fun: Aura Florence has played so important a part, that her art-history is in man respects nearly coincident
with that of the whole of Italy. We then on refer the reader to our
prefatory article on the subject, and shall now merely direct his attention to those puma which more specially concern Florence. In the 13th
cent. when frequent changes of the constitution and constantly recurring dissensions of factions began to take place, and when private citizens for the first time manifested an interest in public life, a general
taste for art gradually sprang up at Florence. With characteristic pride
the Florentines proceeded to arm their cathedral, which was begun by
Arnolfo dt Gambia (1232-1301), and in the form of their Palazzo Vecchio,
the restless aspect of their political life is distinctly reflected. The lahours of Giotto (12704337) entitled Florence to be regarded as the headquarters of the Italian ainting of the 14th cent., while the journeys under.

predominant throughout the peninsula. Among Giotto's most distinguished pupils we may mention Taddeo.and Agaolo Gaddi, Orcagna, who
was also noted as an architect and sculptor, Spinello Aretino, and Gtotttno.
This school flourished for nearly a century. The year 1402 may be accepted
as the dawn of the Rnnsrssxnea in Florence, for from that year dates the
Abraham's Sacrifice and the com elition for the doors of the Baptistery
(p. 460). In architecture, however, t e new spirit did not find expression until
two decades later (comp. pp. UN, 498). while BrunellucM "MM) had
adhered to the national traditions in his palatial architecture (Palazzo Pitti),
he derived numerous suggestions for his churches from a study of the
antique, particularly in the execution of details. His successors were

and Cronaca. Stimulated by the example of the humanists, the Artist! of
this period aimed at versatility, and were not content to confine their
labours to one sphere-of art; so that we frequently hear of architects who
were at the same time sculptors, and soul tors and goldsmiths who were
also painters. Among the most distinguis ed Florentine sculptors of the
Renaissance were Lam" amem (18781455), Luca delta Robbie (1399-1482),
who he given his name to the glazed reliefs in terracotta, and above all
Donatello (1386-1466), the grate" - or the century, who exercised a
protound influence on the development of Italian sculpture, and is justly
regarded as the precursor of Michael Angelo. The energetic life and
strong individuality of his figures are such, that their deficiency in gracefulness is well-nigh forgotten. After Donatello's death, Andrea Verrocehto

reputation, who were fully occupied both here and at Rome in the execution
