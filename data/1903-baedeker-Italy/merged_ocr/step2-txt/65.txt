undertook. He regarded careful physical training as scarcely less
important than comprehensive culture of the mind; the vigour 0:
his imagination served also to stimulate the exercise of his intellect
and his minute observation of nature developed his artistic taste and
organ of form. One is frequently tempted to regard Leonardo':
works as mere studies, in which he tested his powers, and whicl
occupied his attention so far only as they gratified his love o
investigation and experiment. At all events his personal importance has exercised a greater influence than his productions at
an artist, especially as his prejudiced age strenuously sought ta
obliterate all trace of the latter. Few of Leonardo's work
have been preserved in Italy, and these sadly marred by neglect
A reminiscence of his earlier period, when he wrought unde
ANDREA Vnnnoconro at Florence, and was a fellow-pupil of Lo
332120 in Cum, is the Annunciation in the Uffizi (p. 465), if i
be a genuine work. Several oil-paintings, portraits (a. g. the tw
tine works in the Ambrosians "Milan, p. 134), Madonnas, am
imaginative works are attributed to his Milan period, althougl
careful research inclines us to attribute them to his pupils. Un.
adulterated pleasure may, however, be taken in his drawings i ]
the Ambrosians, the Venice Academy (p. 286), and the Uffizi. Twl
unfinished paintings, the Adoration of the Magi in the Uffizi (p. 464:
which bears ample testimony to the fertility of his imagination, am
the M. Jerome in the Vatican, afford an insight into his technique
The best idea of his reforms in the art of colouring is obtained b
an attentive examination of the works of the Milln school (me
SALAINO; p. 117), as these are far better preserved than the em:
undoubted work of Leonardo's Milan period in Italy: the Las
Supper in Suite Maris delle anie (p. 136). Although now a total
wreck, it is still well calculated to convey an idea of the net
epoch of Leonardo, especially to those who have studied Morghen'
engraving of the picture. The spectator should first examine th
delicate equilibrium of the composition, and observe how the in
dividual groups are complete in themselves, and yet simultaneousl
point to a common centre and impart a monumental character t
the work; then the remarkable physiognomical fidelity whici
pervades every detail, the psychological distinctness of char-acts ]
and the dramatic life, together with the calmness of the anti:
bearing of the picture. He will then comprehend that with Leonard
I new era in Italian painting was inaugurated, that the devel
opment of art had attained its perfection.

The accuracy of this assertion will perhaps be doubted by th
amateur when he turns from Leonardo to Michael Angelo (1475
can; 1564). On the one hand he hears Michael Angelo extolle.
