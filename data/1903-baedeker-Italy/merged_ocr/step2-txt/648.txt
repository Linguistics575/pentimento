of IN steps (lift, 50 c.) to the "Glued. degli mm (admission,
see p. 437). The gallery originated with the Medici collections, to
which numerous additions have been made down to the most recent
times, and it is now one of the greatest in the world, both in extent
and value. Many of the best pictures are often removed from their
usual position for the convenience of copyists, but their whereabouts
is indicated by a notice on the vacant space. A systematic rearrangement is contemplated. Catalogue, in Italian, French, or

The pictures in the Tribune o. Mi) me the choicest in the
gallery, as their position indicates, and are therefore all worthy
of careful inspection. These are, however, by no mean: the only
treasures of the collection. Thus the predelle and the angels at the
sides of Fra Angelico's frequently copied winged picture of the Madonna and angels (No. 1294; p. 468) are more interesting than the
principal picture itself. Among the other mum works of the
15th cent. we may first mention Fm Filippo Lippi's Madonna with
angels (1307; p. 464), and four works of Sandra Botticelli: a round
picture of the Madonna (1267 his; p. 464), the Adoration of the Magi
(1286; p. 468), so much extolled by Vasari, and, as specimens of
other subjects, his Birth of Venus (39; p. 468), and his Calumny after
Apelles (1182; p. 464). Filippino Lippi's Madonna and saints (1268;
p. 464) Attract: attention by its size and clear colouring, and his
idoration of the Magi (1257; p. 464), with its numerous figures, is
interesting on account of the portraits it contains. One of the best of
he early masters was Domenico Ghirlandajo, whose beautiful round
picture of the Adoration of the Magi (1295; p. 465), and the Materms with saint: (1297; p. 468), are remarkable for the excelence of the composition and the harmony of colouring. The full importance of this master, who excelled in narrative painting, can only

306, 507). The mythological works of Piero di Cosimo (1312;
p. 464, etc.) betray a taste for fantastic subjects, from which Leon.
la Vinci himself was not entirely free. Pietro Pcrugino, Raphael's
: eacher, is here well represented only by his brilliant portraits
:1217; p. 463). The portrait of Raphael by himself (288; p. 458) is
genuine, though disfigured by retouching. Other paintings by this
haste! form the chief gems of the Tribune (p. 462). A very effective
picture, notwithstanding its unfinished condition, is Leon. da Vinci's
'ich composition of the Adoration of the Magi (1252; p. 464).
in other very important work, though unfinished, is Era Bartolomeo's
Madonna enthroned 1265; p. 464), with its masterly grouping. The
Visitation of Mary (259; p. 464), by Marietta Albertinelli, en esdetant of Fra Bartolomeo, and Sodoma's St. Sebastian (1279; p. 464)

works of the other Italian Schools the most notable ere Mantegna's
