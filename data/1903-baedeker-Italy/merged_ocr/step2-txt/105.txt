24 PIEDMONT.

The Hieronv of the country is closely interwoven with that of its
dynasty. The House of Envoy Car Cam Sabauda), a family of German
origin, professing even to trace their descent from the Sum: Duke
Wittekind, the opponent of Charlemagne, first became conspicuous among
the nobles of Upper Burgundy about the year 1000. Humbert I. t'Biancamano'; a. 10533 in generally regarded as the founder of the dynasty.
His descendants, by judiciously espousing the cause of the pope and the
emperor alternately, gradually succeeded in extending their supremacy
over Turin, Aosta, lvren, and Nice. Amadeus TU. (was), known
as the'Conte Verde' ('green count') from his usual dress extended the
power of his house in numerous feuds and warred in the East. Amadeus 1711., raised to the ducal dignity by Emp. Sigismund in me, added
Geneva, Vercelli, and Piedmont to his possessions, and gave the principality its first legislative code. He retired to a hermitage at Ripaille, near
Thonon, in 1434, but was armed pope as Felix F. (1439-49) by the Council
of Basle and died in 1151. - Situated between the two great medieval
powers of mute on one side, and Austria and Spain on the other, the
princes of Savoy frequently changed sides, and although sometimes overtaken by terrible disasters, they contrived to maintain, and even to extend,
their territory. At one period the greater part of the Bach was annexed
to France, but Emmanuel Philibert ('Testa di Ferro', 1553- restored it
to its original extent, and became its second founder. This rince spent
25 years as a general in the service of Charles V. and won t e battle of
St. Quentin for Philip 11. Under his son Charles Emmanuel I. (1580-1630)
the Duchy again became dependent on France. From the sons of this
prince are descended the elder branch of the family, which became extinct
n 1831, and the younger Carignano line, which succeeded to the throne
in the person of Carlo Alberto. The following dukes were Vittorio Amedeo 1.
(1630- J, Francesco Giacinto (1637-38), Carla Emanuele 11. (1638-75), and
l'illo-rio-Amedeo II. (1675-1730). The last of these, having boldly allied himself with Austria during the S artists War of Succession, managed to throw
"the French suzerainty (170 J; he obtained Sicily as his reward, which
island, however, he was afterwards obliged to exchange for Sardinia (1720),
and in 1713 assumed the title of KING, which was subsequently coupled
with the name of the latter island. His successors were Carlo Emanuele 111.
(1730-73), and Vittorio Amedeo 111. (1773-96). After the battle of Turin
(1706), in which Prince Eugene commanded the Imperialists, the Piedmontese princes directed their attention to Prussia, which served as a model
for the Organisation of their kingdom. In both countries the military
and feudal element preponderated, and both were obliged to succumb
to the new powers evolved by the French Revolution. Carlo Emanuele I V.
(1796-1802) was deprived of all his continental possession: by the French
in 1798, and restricted to the island of Sardinia, which was protected
by the English fleet. Vittorio Emanuele A (1802-21) was at length reinstated in his dominion, with the addition of Gen", by the Congress of
Vienna. The Napoleonic period had swept away the feudal institutions
of Piedmont, and had bequeathed in their stead many of the benefits of
modern legislation, and high military renown. It is therefore intelligible
that the clerical reaction, which set in with the king's return, gave rise
to an insurrection which canned the king to indicate, and had to be
queued by Austrian troops. His brother Carlo Felice (1821-31) adhered
faithfully to Jesuitical principles, and lived on the whole in accordance
with his motto,'Non sono re per essere seccato' ('worried'). The older
line of the House of Savoy became extinct with this rince, and was
succeeded by the collateral line of Carignano (p. 40; th April, 1831).
Carlo Alberto (b. 1798) who had been educated at a French military
school, and had headed the insurrection of 1821, was protected by France
and Russia against the attempts of Austria to deprive him of his claims
to the throne. His own experiences, and the force of circumstances,
rendered him an implacable enemy of Austria. With him began the
national development of Piedmont, although his efl'orts were not always
consistent. The liberals called him the'Re Tentenna' (the vacillating),
while in 1843 he himself described his position as being'between the
