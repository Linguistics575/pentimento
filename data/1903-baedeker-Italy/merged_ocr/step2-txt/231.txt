118 Route HI. MILAN. a. Fromthe Piazza del

Maggiore. It was at that period the Ingest church in existence
and it is still one of the largest and most sumptuous in the world.
This huge structure cover: In are: of 14,000 sq. yds. (of which about
2400 sq. yds. Are taken up by the walls and pillars), and holds about
40,000 people. The interior is 162 yds. In length, the transept
96 yds. in breadth, the facade 73 yds. in breadth; nave 157 ft. in
height, 18 yds. in breadth. The dome is 220 ft. in height, the tower
360 ft. above the pavement. The roof, marble like the rest of the
building, is adorned with 98 turrets, and the exterior with upwards
of 2000 statues in marble. The stained-glass windows in the choir
are said to be the largest in the world. The cathedral was founded
by the splendour-loving Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1386. The general
style of the building is Gothic, but shows many peculiarities. The
author of the original design is unknown; Marco da Campione (d.
1390) and Simone da Orsenigo (who was master-builder in 1387)
have been named, but without any positive proof. The building
progressed but slowly, owing to the dimensions between the Italian
architects and the German and French masters (Nicholas de Bonaventuri, Ham van Freiburg, Heinrich eon Gmiind, Ulrich von Fitssingcn, Jean Mignot, and others, who were frequently called to
their aid. Between 1459 and 1 O Guiniforte Solari is mentioned
among the superintendents of the building-operations; about 1500
Francesco di Giorgio of Stems and Giov. Ant. Amadeo appear to
have been associated in the that office; and after them the work
was conducted by Dolcebuono, Cristoforo Solari, etc. The crypt and
the baptistery, the style of which is quite out of harmony with the
general design of the building, were added in the second half of
the 16th cent. by Pellegrino Tibaldi, who also laid down the marble
pavement and designed a baroque facade. The church was consecrated by Sen 03110 Borromeo on Oct. 20th, 1577. The dome was
begun in 1759 by the architects Croce end Mania, and was finished
in 1775. The facade, begun in 1615 after Tibaldi's design, remained
uncompleted, until in 1805 Napoleon (whose marble statue, in
antique costume, is among those on the roof) caused the works to
be resumed, with modifications by Amati. But this entire facade
is being gradually removed since 1900, and a new one in strict harmony with the style of the rest of the church erected according to
the plan of the young architect Giuseppe Brentano (d. 1889), whose
design won the first prize in an open competition in 1888.

The church is cruciform in shape, with double aisles and a transept, the latter also flanked with aisles. The INTERIOR is supported
by fifty-two pillars, each 16 paces in circumference, the summits
of which are adorned with canopied niches with statues instead of
capitals. The pavement consists of mosaic in marble of different
colours.
