without restraint, and almost, as it were, spontaneously. Works i1
marble also occur, but these generally trench on the province 0
decoration, and seldom display the bold and unfettered aspiration
which are apparent in the works in bronze.

The churches have always afforded the most important field to

the labours of the Italian sculptors, some of them, such "Harm
