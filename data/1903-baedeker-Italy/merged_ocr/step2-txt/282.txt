Varenna (P & R; Alb.
Oliecdo) is charmingly situated
on a promontory surrounded by
gardens (Isimbardi, Lelia, Venini,
Keen), at the mouth of the Val
d'Esino. In the vicinity both road
and railway pass through several
tunnels.. Most of the marble
quarried in the neighbourhood is
cut and polished in the town.

About'h M. to the B. of Varenna the Fiume Latte ('milk
brook', from its colour) is precipitated in several leaps from a
height of 1000 ft., forming an imposing cascade in spring, but generally dried up at other seasons.
