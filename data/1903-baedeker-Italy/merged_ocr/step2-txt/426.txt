The "Piazza of St. Ink CPI. G, ti), usually called'La Piazza',
a square paved with trachyte and marble, 192 yds. in length, on
the. side 61, and on the E. 90 ro. in breadth, afi'ords the most
striking evidence of the ancient glory of Venice. On three sides it
is enclosed by imposing buildings, which appear to form one vast
marble palace, blackened by age and the elements; on the E. it is
bounded by the Church of St. Mark and the Piazzetta (p. 275). The
palaces on the N. and S. Mile were once the residence of the nine
'procurators', the highest officials of the Republic after the Dogs,
whence their name Procnratie. The Procuratie Vecchie, or N. wing,
were erected in 1480-1517 by Pietro Lombardo, Bartolomeo Bums
the Younger, and Guglielmo Bergamasco. The Procuratie Nuove, or
S. wing, begun by Scamozzi in 1584, together with the adjoining
building (formerly the Library, p. 275), now form the Palasso Beale,
and contain handsome modern apartments with ancient and modern
pictures (adm., see p. 285; entrance in the Piazzetta). The edifice
on the W. side, the Atrio,'or Nuova Fabbrica, was erected in 1810,
partly on the site of the church of Sen Geminiano. The groundfloors
of these structures consist of arcades, and contain the cafes and shops
mentioned at pp. 260, 263.'

'The Place of St. Mark is the heart of Venice, and from this
beau new life in every direction, through an intricate system of
streets and canals, that bring it back again to the same centre'
(Howells). On summer-evenings all who desire to-enjoy fresh air
congregate here. The scene is liveliest when the military band plays
(almost daily, 830-1030), and possesses a charm all its own. In
winter the band plays on the same days, 2.30-4.30 p.m., and the
Piazza is then a fashionable promenade. By moonlight the piazza
is strikingly impressive.

A large flock of Presents (Colombo enliven, the Piazza. In accordance
with an old custom pigeons were sent out from the vestibule of Sen Marco
an Palm Sunday, and these nested in the nooks and crannies of the eurronnding buildings. Down to the close of the Republic they were fed at
the public expense, but they are now dependent upon private char-lg.
towards evening they perch in great number ] under the arches of t.
native. Grain and peas may be bought for the pigeons from various
angers in the Piazza; and those whose ambition lens in that direction
nay have themselves photographed with the pigeons clustering round them.

ranners of the Republic which once waved here are now succeeded

The nucleus of "San Marco (P1. H, 5), the Church of St. Mark,
he tutelary saint of Venice, whose house are said to have been
wrought by Venetians from Alexandria in 829, is a Romanesque
