TU lull. to the right, we pass the church of Santa Maria in Istrada
gsecond on the right), with a Gothic brick facade of 1393, and in
0 min. reach the Piazza Roma, the centre of the town, with the
handsome Gothic Municipio or town-lull, also celled Palauo
Arcngario (13th cent.) .---- A few paces distant is the Piazza del
Duomo, in which rises the--,

CATHEDRAL (San Giovanni), the chief object of interest. It was
erected in the 14th cent. in the Lombard Gothic style by Matteo da
Campione on the site of a church founded in 590 by the Lombard
queen Theodolinda and afterwards replaced by a Romanesque
structure. The interior, with both aisles flanked by chapels, has
been almost entirely modernized since the 17th century. The fine
facade was restored in 1899-1901. Above the portal is a very
curious relief representing Queen Theodolinda amid her treasures;

below, the Baptism of Christ.

INTERIOR. In the E. transept is a relief representing the coronation
0f a German king, from the former imperial gallery of H. da Campione
(now the organ-loft) .--The chapel to the left of the choir, restored in
ma, contains the plain sarcophagus of Queen Theodolinda (14th cent.)
and frescoes of scenes from her life by Zarattam' (1444). Here also is
preserved the celebrated IRON CROWN, supposed to have been the royal
crown'of the Lombards, with which the German emperors were crowned

used at the coronation of the Emp. Charles V. in 1530, of Napoleon at
[ flan in 1805, and of Emp. Ferdinand L in 1838. It consists of a broad
PM of gold adorned with precious stones, round the interior of which
15: thin strip of iron, said to have been made from a nail of the true
'Cross brought by the Empress Helena from Palestine. In its present form
it is, perhaps, a work of the 12th centu. In 1859 it was carried off by
the Austrians, but after the peace of 1 it was restored. (Fee for seeing
the crown and treasury, 5 fr.) - The'Tnnwnr (fee 1 fr.) contains several
objects of historical interest: a hen with seven chickens in silver-gilt
(on a modern copper base), perhaps representing Lombardy and in men
Provinces, executed by order of Queen Theodolinda; the queen's crown,
u, and comb; a richly-adorned book-cover with an inscription of Theodolinda; fine diptychs of the 4-6th cent.; reliquary of Berengarius; goblet
