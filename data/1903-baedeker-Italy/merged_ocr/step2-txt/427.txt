the facade was enhanced by the Gothic addition, it received in the
15th century. The edifice (250 ft. long, 168 ft. wide) is in the form
of B Week cross (with equal arms), covered with Byzantine dome:
in the centre and at the end of each arm. The foremost arm is

smaller domes. On the 8. side this contains the baptistery and the
Cappella Zeno; and on the W. side it forms the facade. Above it a
gallery runs round the upper part of the church. Externally and
internally the church is adorned with five hundred marble columns
(mostly Oriental), with capitals in an exuberant variety of styles.
The mosaics cover an area of 45,790 sq. it, and the interior is
profusely decorated with gilding, bronze, and Oriental marble. The
mosaics, some of them said to date from the 10th cent. belong
chiefly to the period between the 12th and 16th cent, and afford
interesting evidence of the early aptitude of the Venetians for pictorial composition. - Since 1807 St. Mark's has been the cathedral
