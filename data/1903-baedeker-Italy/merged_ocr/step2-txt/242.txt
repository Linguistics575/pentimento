a fine covered court, by L. Broggi (1899-1901). Facing the Via
Dante, on the N.W. side of the Piazza, is a bronze statue (by Luigi
Seven; 1899) of Mus. Parini (1729-99), author of the satiric poem
'Il Giorno'.

From the Piazza Cordusis a new series of streets leads in a direct
line to the Castello. The first part of this thoroughfare is the wide
and handsome VIA DAN" (Pl. D, 5, 4; electric tramways Nos. 3 t 4,
see p. 113), which is continued, beyond the Foro Bonaparte, by the
Via Cairoli (Pl. D, 4). In the Faro Bonaparte is a bronze Equestrian
Statue of Garibaldi, by Ettore Ximenes (1896). The allegorical
female figures on the pedestal represent Revolution and Liberty.

The *castello Bforzesco (Pl. c, 3, 4), the castle of Milan, was
originally built as the Castello dt Porta Giovia by Galeazzo 11. Visconti (1355-78), on the city-wall, adjoining the old Ports Giovia.
It was destroyed by the Ambrosian Republic (p. 111) in 1447, but
was rebuilt and enlarged by the Storm utter Â£450. In 1893 et seq.
it was restored in the 16th cent style from the plum of Luca
Belts-amt, and it now contains the municipal art-collections. The
rectangular building, defended by four corner-turrets and a curtain
wall, comprises a large Anterior Court and two castles or palaces:
the Rocchetta, built by Franc. Storm on the foundations of the Visconti castle, and the Corte Ducate. Each of these, in turn, encloses

a smaller court.

The old Visconti castle seems to have been built by Galeazzo 11., not
only as a bulwark against external foes but to protect the W. quarters of
the town against Bernabo Visconti, who had begun about 1368 to erect a
new castle on the me of the 1present Ospedale Maggiore (p. "0), in addition
to the Palazzo di Corte (p. 20) Under Filippo Maria its main function
was to hold the citizens in check. Francesco Sfona ("60) persuaded the
people to rebuild the stronghold that they had but a few years before
razed to the ground amid universal jubilation. The forbidding character
of the structure was somewhat modified by the elegant tower-gateway
erected by Filarete in 1452-54 on the side next the town. This, however,
was destroyed by an explosion of gunpowder in 1521. Behind the Castello
lay an extensive deer-park. Galeazzo Maria began to at up both the palaces
with great luxury, and in 1477 Bona a Savoia, his widow, erected the
tower named after her at the E. angle of the Rocchetta. Ludovico it More
emulated the artistic zeal of his brother, and Bramante and Leonardo da Vinci
cooperated with him in beautifying the Castello, though the latter's design
for the rebuilding of the main facade was never executed.

An abrupt end was put to this brilliant period by the French invasion.
In 1552-70 the castle was surrounded with six bastions and separated from
the new town-walls (p. 116) by a broad moat. Throughout the Spanish
and Austrian domination it formed the focus of all the struggles for the
possession of Lombardy. The republican movement of 1796 incited the
Milanese to a repetition of the events of 1447, but it was not till 1
that Napoleon ordered the destruction of the fortifications, on the site of the
Spanish bastions and rampart arose the Spacious Fore Bonaparte (see above),
now partly built over. Under the Austrzan regime the castle was converted
into - sad the pleasure-garden became a drill-ground (Piazza d'Armi).
In 1886 it was resolved to rebuild the castle, which was handed over to
the city in 1893.
