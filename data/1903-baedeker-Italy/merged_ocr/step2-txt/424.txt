though his oil-paintings are distributed throughout the galleries of Europe,
several of his most striking works, chiefly religious composition, are
still reserved at Venue.

uch was the vitality and vigour and so great were the resources of
the Venetian School, that even mum. of secondary rank fre uently produced works of the highest excellence. There is frequently ut little to
choose between them in their skill in using colour. Foremost among
them Ire 5.1mm del Rambo (14861547), who afterwards yielded to the
fascinating influence of Michael Angelo, Rocco Marconi, the dreamy Lorenzo
Lotto "£556), or'Bon. mem': comp. p.223,
ot whole life little is yet known, Giovanni Antonio (da) Pordenone (1
1539), whose flesh-tints are unsurpassed, and Part: Bordone (1600-71),
whose portraits rival those of Titian. To a younger generation belongs
Jacopo Tintoretto (Rabum 1519.94), who squandered excellent abilities on
superficial works (Vasari calls him HI pin terribile cervello, che abbia
avuto mai la pittura'), and in his eagerness for tstreet lost the golden tints
of his school. Paolo Caliéri, surnamed Vsronesc (1528-88), on the other
hand, though more realistic, maintains the heat tradition! n! his school. Last
among the mute" of note were the Banana'l (p. 258), Palma Giovane, and
Padoranino. To the 18th cent. helm: Tie olo (ca. 1693-1770),
a spirited decorative artist, Anmm'o 411414169747, an architectural
painter, and his pupil Bum. Emma (1724-80), both summed Canaletto, all
much admired by their contemporaries.

Visitor! to Venice should be provided with'Life on the Lagoons,

if (2nd edit., London, 1894), by Horatio F. Brown, an excellent little book,

which furnishes answers to most of the questions about Venice that suggest themselves to the intelligent visitor. The same author's'Venice: an
Historical Sketch of the Republic' (1893) and'Venetian Studies' (1887) are
also recommended. It is, of course, well to be familiar with Ruskin's'atones

. of Venice', or at least with the'Introductory Chapters and Local Indices,
printed separately for the use of travellers' (in 2 octavo vole.; 1881). His
'St. Mark's Rest, the History of Venice written for the help of the few
travellers who still care for her Monuments' is tuned in the same form
as the better-known'Mornings in Florence'. The'Venice' of Mr. J. 0.
Han Grd edit., 1891) is an interesting and convenient manual; the
'Venetian Life' of Mr. W. D. Howells is one of the moat churning book:
of its kind. Bernhard Berenson':'Venetian Painters of the Renaissance,
with an index to their works' (1894), will be found useful by the art
' lover. The Rev. Dr. Alex. Robertson's'Fra Paolo 8:11)? (2nd e it., 1894)

deals with a critical epoch of Venetian history, and his'Bible of St. Mark,
the Altar and Throne of Venice' deals exhaustively with the history,
mosaics, and sculptures of St. Mark's Church. See also the'Renaissance
in "av, by J. A. Symonds;'venice', by the Hon. Anthea mu ('Story of
the Nation's Series'; 1894):, The Makers of Venice' by Era. oupam; and
'Vfinice' try Grant Allen Historical Guides series). - Mr. Ruskin advises
the traveller who is fun of paintings to devote his principal attention'to
the works of Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and John Bellini; not of course
neglecting Titian, yet remembering that Titian can be judged of on y in Venice, and Paul ewnene.. in not to be
full estimated until he is seen at play among the fantastic chequers oi
the enetian ceilings'.
