532 Route 59. PRATOVECCHIO. Environs

From the Begnale di Pratomagno (5223 ft), the highest summit of the

Pratomagno chain (4-5 hrs. from Vallombrosa, with guide) a steep path de-.

scends to the N., through woods and ravines (11/2 hr.) skirting the brook
Bolono, passing Uettco and several other mountain-villages, and leading
to the picturesque market-town of Son Niccolo, commanded by the ancient
fort of that name and situated at the confluence of the Solano and Arno,
where the fertile Casentino expands. Carriage-roads lead from S. Niccolo
to Poppi (43/4 11.; p. aw, and to Stia and Pratovecchio (t M., see below).

(10.) CAMALDOLI and LA Vanna. This excursion takes walkers
31/2-4 days from Pontassieve or Vallombrosa. Ist Day, over the Consume Pass to Stia and Pratovecchio; 2nd Day, direct or via the Falterona to Camaldoli; 3rd Day, by Badia a Prataglia to La Verna;

The road mentioned at p. 531 ascends past the old castle of
Diacceto, the (4 M.) village of the same name, and the 61/2 M.)
hamlet of Bonelli to the (101/2 M.) Consuma Pass (eat 60 ft.)
which may also be reached from Vallombrosa by a bridle-path
(comp. above; guide necessary, 2 hrs.) A little on this side of the
head of the pass is the small village of Consuma, with two poor
osterie. The summit of the Monte Consuma (3435 ft.) lies to the
right. Farther on the road leads up and down to (14 M.) the lonely
inn (unpretending) of Casaccia and (15 M.) 0momorto. A little
lower down a view is disclosed of the Casentino, or upper valley
of the Arno, bounded on the N. and E. by the Central Apennines
and on the W. by the Pratomagno chain, while it is open towards
the S. To the SE. appears the jagged outline of the Verna, and a
little farther on, to the left, the range of Falterona. - At (IT M.)
Scarpaccia the road to (191/2 M.) Stia and Pratovecchio diverges
to the left from the highroad to Bibbiena. To the right, 1' ]: M.
to the S.W. of Pratovecchio, we see the ruined castle of Ramona.
mentioned by Dante (Inferno, xxx. 73), near which arose the Font:
Brando, now dried up. A little farther on the road again forks, the
left branch leading to Stia, the right to Pratovecchio. The station
of the railway to Arezzo (p. 534) lies between these two places.

Stia (1460 ft.;'Alb. delta Stations Alpine, R. 1% fr., unpretending; cart. and pair to Camaldoli via Poppi, 1042 ft.; Alb.
Bastieri) are well adapted as headquarters for excursion: in the
Casentino (guide ti fr. daily, and his food).

From Pratovecchio a footpath leads to Camaldoli (about 9 M.)
via Moggiona; another route, somewhat longer, passes Gasoline and
Sacra Eremo (see p. 533) .--The following is a fine but somewhat
fatiguing round from Stia: past the ruined castle of Porciano to the
N. of the Source of the Ame ('Capo d'Arno'; see Dante's'Purgatorio',
xir; 4265 ft.), 3 hrs.; thence to the summit of Monte Falteront
(5410 ft.; Itecovero Dante, of the Ital Alpine Club), which com
