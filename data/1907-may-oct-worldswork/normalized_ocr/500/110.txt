THE CULEX AND THE ANOPHELES MOSQUITOS
How to distinguish malaria from ordinary mosquitos by their resting
attitudes

eye of the microscope and watch the pupa
through his two days' preparation, you will see
quickly forming within his transparent shell
the outlines of a mosquito. His long legs,
soft and rubber-like, are coiled in the bottom
of his bulging chest like an ccean cable in the
bottom of a ship; his eyes peer out from his
mosquito head through the transparent visor
of his mail; his wings are furled neatly along
the body in the segmented tail-piece; his
antenna are tucked like a bib about his throat.

And now, when his natal hour has come, you
will observe that he lies just against the surface
of the water-a little globule of air enclosed in
his forehead serving to bring this submarine
just to the surface; you will see his shell sud-
denly split open along the back, just as many
a boy has seen occur in a locust as it clings to
the trunk of a tree. You will next observe

his shoulders slowly rise through this crack in
his shell up into the air, then his head, antennae
and forelegs.

legs and plants his feet upon the water surface.
He lifts his body, wings, and remaining legs
free from his childhood shell and, having little
air cups in the hollows of his feet, he finds him-
self able to stand upon the water. Then he
unfolds his wings and dries them, straightens
and loosens his antenna, takes a brief glance
at his new surroundings, then flies into the air
and begins to sing. In leaving his shell, if
his hatching is normal, he will not touch the
water except with the soles of his feet; but if
a ripple blows his way, or he loses his balance
and falls upon his side, he is unable to
lift himself free from the water, and quickly
drowns. His pupa shell, from which he has
just escaped, will float like any other deserted
boat, until it softens and sinks.

The appearance and careers of male and
female mosquitoes are strikingly distinct.
The male canhbe distinguished with the naked
eye by his bushy, plume-like antennae, the
female having straight, bare "feelers." The
male does not bite us; the female does, when
impregnated. The first-and Jast--object of
the newborn male is to find a mate. According
to Russell, he makes marvelous use of his
whiskered antennae in finding a mate. Born
after dark, as many of them are, he must dis-
cover her solely by her song. His antennae
seem sensitive to musical waves, and when he
hears in the surrounding darkness her monoton-
ous melody, he slowly revolves as on a pivot
until he "feels" through his antennae the sound
waves equally with both of them, when he
knows that the object of his desire is straight
ahead. We wonder if the inventor of the
submarine telephone, which locates a neigh-
