since have demanded a change from the un-
scientific method of organization which has
come to us from the Middle Ages.

In a late report, the superintendent of the
schools of New York City acknowledged that
102,000 pupils were from two to seven years
behind the proper grade for their age. An-
other authority undertakes to show that seven
out of ten were from one to seven years behind,
and were therefore considered backward pupils.
The proportion of those losing time in the
second year was much greater than the number
losing time in the first year. The proportion
losing time in the third year was twice as great
as the number losing time in the first year;
and so on, in ever-increasing ratio.

WHAT BECOMES OF THE PUPILS

In an article on the ilw York schools, I
called attention to the fact that the reports
never showed the number of pupils promoted.
It is encouraging to note that the last report
devotes several pages to this important subject.
It states that one-fifth of those left at the end of
a term were not promoted to advance work, but
were compelled to repeat the work of a whole
term. This they were forced to do, though
but a short distance behind the rest of the class.
While some schools report from 50 to 60 per
cent. not promoted, the average per cent. of
failures is made to appear small; by some
peculiar method of estimating the number
promoted, in some schools it was reported that
from 104 to 137 per cent. were promoted. But
the average is bad enough, for, even at this
rate, in less than five years 100 per cent. would
lose time and be considered backward pupils.
Yet this is not the worst. During the year
680,322 pupils were enrolled; it is acknowl-
edged that of these but 434,706 were promoted
and 113,283 not promoted. What became
of the other 132,233? Some have died; some
have moved away; few were old enough to
go to work. How many of these were quietly
forced to stop school lest they reduce the per
cent. of those promoted? How many left
because of utter discouragement resulting from
a system which demands of pupils and teachers
the accomplishment of the impossible? How
many of the bright ones left because they
could not forever bear the marking time and
waiting for the slower ones to learn what they
long since knew well?

Under such conditions, is it any wonder that
so few reach the higher grades, and that the

lower grades are congested with those who are
unjustly considered backward? Need we be
surprised that the number reported upon as
being from two to six years behind their grade
increases year after year?

GREAT LOSS TO NEW YORK

This means a great loss to New York City in
several ways. Leaving out of consideration
the pupils not accounted for, if only those not
promoted lost one half-year twice a year, this
means that 113,283 must go over the year's
work, though the records prove that on an
average they are but a tenth of a year behind
in essential work. As the annual cost of
instruction was $ 43 per capita, it meant an
expenditure for the year of more than four
millions, which could have been saved if pupils
had not been compelled to review one-half of a
year's work. In addition to this, as much
more might have been saved if the brighter
children had been allowed to go forward when
they were able, in place of waiting until all
were ready to move. This loss of time also
means that the individual's productive life
would be shortened by the number of years
lost. If but 100,000 of those losing time should
finish their work one year earlier and could
earn but (hoo a year, it would mean to them a
saving of IO millions. Or, if the pupils who
were from two to six years behind had averaged
a loss of but three years and could earn but
$ 100 a year, it W'uld mean a saving to them
of S? millions.

But great as is the financial loss to the dis..
trict and pupils, the loss in mental discipline
is even more to be regretted. Having the
bright, the slow, trind the average in every class,
teachers are compelled to become pupil drivers.
While trying to force the slow into an unnatural
gait, the brighter pupils are drilled in habits
of idleness and inattention and lose their mental
elasticity by cont, oually repeating work which,
because of its familiarity, has long since
ceased to furnish suitable exercise.

UNSATISFA LIORY EXPLANATIONS

All sorts of excuses have been offered for
these unsatisfactory conditions. The most
popular excuse is that so many pupils are dull.
We are asked to believe that the backward
children are born so, and the others made
Yet there is much to
prove the assertion that the most of the so-
called backward children are made so by the
