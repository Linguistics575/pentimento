NATIVES SOLDIERS' DRILLING AT OMDURMAN

One of the great achievements of Lord Cromer's policy is an effective body of trained native soldiers

the very guns of the British and French flccts,
and scores of Europeans were murdered.
Both flccts cleared for action, but the French-
man received a cablegram to Clear for home.

The English admiral then told Arabi how
much time he had in which to dismantle the
Alexandrian forts. Arabi put his hand over
his mouth to restrain his undignifwd merri-

national honor, public sentiment forced the
Gladstone ministry to land more troops on
Egyptian soil. Major Baring had meanwhile
returned to Egypt, landing in the midst of these
stirring events. The most inexplicable thing
in Lord Cromcr's career is that Lord Wolseley,
commanding the Gordon relief expedition,
should have been allowed to stay in Cairo long
enough to be just a few hours too late to save
the picturesque and daring soldier whose tragic
