Armstrong, say: "It is too bad! I like that
boy's face; he has an honest look."

"What do you propose to do?" Mr. Curtis

asked me.

I told him that I had come to stay and that
I thought, with a week's preparation, I would
be able to pass the entrance examination. He
asked if I were afraid of hard work. I as-
sured him I was not and that I had worked hard
all my life. An arrangement was then made
by which I was assigned to the sawmill. I had
worked at a sawmill before and had a good
general knowledge of lumber, but this mill was
on a larger scale than any I had ever seen.
I was put under the charge of Edward R.
Jackson, whom the boys called "Big Jack"
because he had a smaller brother in school.
He was to instruct me in Hampton's methods
of grading and piling lumber. On the second
afternoon, while working in the lumber yard
with "Big Jack," who is now the pastor of a
large church in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Frissell,
who was then Chaplain, passed along. He
asked if I were happy at Hampton and whether
I liked the place. His inquiries about my
home and people, his kindly expressed wish
that I would have a successful time at Hampton,
and his assurance that I was in the midst of
friends, gave me a great deal of hope and
courage. That afternoon was the only time
during my four years at Hampton that I ex-
perienced any real homesickness. A few days
later, I was put on a raft of logs, to get off the
chains. I got many a salt-water bath and was
thoroughly convinced that sea-water was really
salty. I soon learned to keep on the right side
of the logs---as well as of the boss.

On my first Sunday night at Hampton, 600
students were assembled, Negroes and Indians
and whites, and they sang plantation songs
such as I had heard all my life. It seemed to
me I had never heard music quite so sweet,
but notwithstanding the joy I felt at being a
student in such an institution, I was utterly
disgusted to hear these songs in a school. I
supposed that at Hampton we were to sing
white people's songs and I had come to school
to learn to sing and to speak and to do every-
thing just like white people. I did not hesitate
to express my opinion to some of my newly
made friends after the service. Most of the
new boys agreed with me, but some of the
older students argued that if the songs were
beautiful and people enjoyed them, why
shouldn't we sing them? The only reply that

A NEGRO'S UPHILL CLIMB

I could give was that they were Negro songs
and we had come to school to learn something
better. And, too, I objected to exhibiting the
religious and emotional side of our nature to
white people, for I supposed that the whites
listened to these Negro songs simply for the
amusement they afforded. A few Sunday
evenings later, General Armstrong spoke to the
students about respecting themselves--their
race, their history, their songs, and their folk-
lore generally. He spoke of the songs as a
priceless legacy which Negroes ought to cherish.
While I was not entirely convinced, I was led
to think along a little different line. It was
the first time I had ever given serious thought
to anything distinctly Negro. This also was
the first time in my life that I ever saw anything
about my race of which I should be proud.

My work at the sawmill was hard and
difficult, but we had a greatdealof real pleasure.
I learned a great many things, especially about
lumber and machinery. I learned to fire the
huge boilers, to run the Corliss engine, much
about steam-fitting, and also some carpenter
work. The record of what the twenty boys
who worked with me have done for their people
since leaving Hampton Institute would be
interesting reading. Mr. Westwood, the fore-
man of the mill, who had been an officer in the
Confederate army, was as strict as he was kind;
even to this day he takes a personal interest in
all of the young men who came under his in-
struction. He used to call me "Major" even
then, and often told me that I would be Major
some day at Hampton.

I worked at the mill until October, 1886,
when I entered the day school. I had the
choice between entering the highest class in the
Junior grade or the lowest class in the Middle
year, but I preferred the highest Junior grade
to the lowest Middle, much to the satisfaction
of my teachers. I knew my deficiency in
English especially, and felt that if I missed the
Junior training I should be handicapped for
the rest of my course. I was made an officer in
the battalion and janitor of one of the dor-
mitories, being responsible to the Commandant
for the care of the building, as well as for the
conduct of the young men.

During my year as a work student, I was
constantly learning new things, in the drill, in
the care of my room, in the sawmill, in the
night school, and in things in general. It was
a year of general initiation into an entirely new
life-new people, different races, new standards,
