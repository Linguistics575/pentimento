SHORT TUNNELS



OF THF,

The tunneling and lining are necessary to carry the canal through a range of soft adobe hills and to protect it
from sudden washing rains

pumped into the heading for seventy-two hours
while the men outside worked in three-minute
shifts on a temporary opening. As they worked
the entombed men implored them to hurry.
The first lot that were saved took their turn at
the shovels until the others were reached. All
were rescued except six. These had been
caught and killed by the falling rock.

The lowest price paid for labor is $ 2.50 a
day and the average is about $ 3. The men

have lodgings-with hot and cold showers----
--iree. Their meals cost 75 cents a day. They
can save about $ 15 a week after paying their
expenses. At the camp the food is cxtraordr
narily good and varied. Yet the average
stay of laborers is only about two weeks. At
the slightest pretext, or often without any
pretext, they leave, for they know that they
can get their fare paid to any one of a dozen
other places where a job is Whiting for them.
