$ 7,217,101. This is the more gratifying to us,
because rarely does the balance of trade rest
with us as against any Latin-American country.
Mexico's trade with us, however, has trebled
during the last decade. Last year it bought of
us S3 per cent. of all that it bought of anybody,
and sold to us 71 per cent. of all that it sold to
anybody. The difference in these two per-
centages shows that Mexico, in its turn, should
be appreciative. Excepting only Cuba, no
other country sends so large a proportion of its
exports to the United States. Furthermore,
there was but one other country that increased
the proportion of its sales to Mexico, and this
other country was our old familiar rival, Ger-
many. With last year Germany ousted Great
Britain from second place as regards exports
to Mexico. Yet all countries put together
did not sell to Mexico as much as we did
alone.

However, though the exchange of goods
and dollars is a big item, the presence of the
American and the American dollar in the
country itself is a more significant one. When
a Spanish-American country agitates the abol-
ishment of bull-fights and introduces prize-
fights, does that not show an awakened sensi-
tiveness to civilization?

Then the S. P. C. A. has arrived, and bargain
sales, and baseball, and the Y. M. C. A., and
night schools, and the three-ringed circus, and
a Luna Park under the very shadow of Chapul-

tepec. Even Mexico's new ambassador at
Washington has an American name, is of
American parentage, and is a multi-millionaire.
The Governor in Guadalajara learns English
from the language'phone because he wants to
talk with American investors. There are
American schools and American magazines.
There are American daily papers, like the
M exican H erald and the M anterey N ews. The
H erald, published in English by Americans, is
Mexico's largest daily and one of the best
advertising mediums in the republic, despite
the fact that it can be read by only a fraction
of the newspaper-reading population. This is an
extraordinary situation for a foreign newspaper
in any country, and perhaps exists nowhere else.

Altogether it would appear that Mexico,
for American purposes (and for its own),
is most encouragingly American. However,
one may not appreciate how true this is
until he has traveled in other Latin-American
countries of the same zone. From Cuba to
Venezuela, and especially in Porto Rico, the
American feels the native hatred of Americans.
But once in Mexico, he is not even a strange
being. They take him as a matter of course.
He might be at home, as much so as a German
in Cincinnati, or as an Irishman anywhere.
Mexico, you see, being fairly against our border,
is not the least bit sullen over our "empire-
grabbing propensities." It really seems to
trust us.

THE TIME TO QUIT WORK

WHAT IT COSTS IF A MAN HOLD ON TOO LONG

BY

DR. LUTHER H. GULICK

DIRECTOR OF PHYSICAL TRAINING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF NEW YORK CITY

Frr, ili, i' we have set out on a piece of
, muscular work or head work, we
might expect to find a steady, regular
increase in the fatigue that resulted from it-
so much work, so much fatigue. But that is
not the case. The "fatigue curve" is not a
straight line sloping up from one corner of
the chart diagonally to the other. Instead, it
goes sharply upward at the start; then for a
long distance it runs along on an approximate
level; and then it takes a sharp upward turn
again.

The level stage-the plateau of hard, normal

working power, where the cost in energy doesn't
vary perceptibly-is the "second wind."

You know how it is in long-distance running.
At first, the fatigue increases very rapidly;
a man has to push himself with all the will-
power he can muster. Then, all of a sudden,
it gets easier. It seems as if he had tapped a
big, new supply of energy; and he can keep
running for a long time without any great
increase in his feeling of fatigue. At last, he
reaches a point where the exertion tells hard
again; fatigue piles up terribly fast now-so
fast that unless the runner knows just how
