Meanwhile, Mr. Flanagan's financial sup-
porters had.become so involved with railroad
building in Mexico that they notified him that
they could not meet the issue, and he found
himself without the necessary funds to go on
with the project. But Mr. Flanagan got others.
Mr. August Belmont, although he was then
grappling with the great task of building the
New York subway, became interested in the
project. He knew a great deal about the
lower Massachusetts coast, for he had often
sailed yachts in those waters. By a curious
coincidence, it happens that the earth which
will be dug out for the canalacross Cape Cod
was once owned by the first of the Perry set-
tlers in this country, a forefather of Com-
modore Perry, the Kinsman of Mr. Belmont.

Mr. Belmont summoned Mr. William Bar-
clay Parsons, the consulting engineer of the
New York subway, and turned over to him all
the engineering problems, while other questions
were being studied in the various departments
of his banking house. When once satisfied
of the final outcome, Mr. Belmont determined
to back Mr. Flanagan and his scheme to the
extent of the required $ 12,000,000.

The canal will be about twelve miles long.
From Buzzards Bay (on the south side of the
isthmus) to the village of Sandwich in Barn-
stable Bay (on the north side) the distance is
about eight miles. The approaches on both
sides will add about four miles more. The
canal will start on the south side at the spot
where stands the country house of Mr. Grover
Cleveland. The country home of the late
Joseph Jefferson will likewise be in the canal
zone, so the digging of the big ditch will cause
"Gray Gables" and tt Crow's Nest" to vanish
from the map.

The width of the canal will vary at certain
places from 250 to 300 feet at the surface, and
at the bottom it will be 160 feet wide. The
depth will be thirty feet. By borings which
have already been made, it has been found that
the formation is of sand, with an occasional
boulder. The route is through a valley, the
last spot on the isthmus from which the ocean
receded ages ago when the geological formation
of the region was in progress. There will be
nothing difficult in the construction of the great
waterway. As the sandy soil extends all the
way to the required depth, no expensive
rock-drilling will be necessary. The entire
work can be done with dredges, four of which
will be set to work next summer. One

THE CAPE COD SHIP CANAL

will be put in operation at "Gray Gables,"
on the south side, and will work northward.
Another will be started at the village of Sand-
wich, on the Barnstable or north shore, and
will work southward. The other two will be
placed in the centre of the route, one working
each way. At the entrance to Barnstable Bay,
a jetty 2,400 feet long will be constructed from
the lower water line out to a depth of thirty
feet.

About 30,000 vessels now pass around Cape
Cod in a year. As traffic increases, 40,000
will more nearly represent the number that will
be on the coastwise route to and from Boston
by the time the canal is completed. It has
been figured out that, with a basis of four miles
per hour and a headway of half an hour, there
would be in the canal at one time nine vessels.
This would give a comfortable distance of more
than a mile between each vessel going in the
same direction. By increasing the speed and
lessening the headway, the capacity of the canal
could be greatly augmented.

On a basis of six miles per hour, which is,
perhaps, nearer the actual speed, the canal will
be able to accommodate 60,000 vessels per
annum. If the headway is reduced to a quarter
of an hour, the canal can accommodate 80,000
ships per annum. Many of the sailing vessels
will be towed in fleets. The barges which do
much of the coal business will likewise be
towed through the canal.

This shortening of the time between New
York and Boston will enable a man owning
two vessels to do the business of three. If the
owners of. the canal do not fix the rate of tariff
or toll too high, it is probable that 95 per cent.
of the ships doing business along the coast will
take the "near-cut" and avoid the dangers of
Vineyard Sound and the treacherous shores of
Cape Cod.

The opposition at first manifested by the
railroad lines against the promoters of the
Cape Cod canal has completely vanished.
They recognize that the canal will work to the
general prosperity of the manufacturing in-
dustries of New England and will create more
business for railroads and steamships alike.
Instead of endeavoring to obstruct the progress
of the work by throwing obstacles in Mr.
Flanagan's way, they are working harmoniously
with him.

It will be a valuable waterway in case of
war, for it will allow the passage of the largest
ships in the navy.
