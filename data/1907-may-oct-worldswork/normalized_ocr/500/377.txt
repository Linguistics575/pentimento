THE ECONOMIC LAYMAN AND THE PREACHER

THE NATIONAL SPIRIT OF THE SOUTH

OW far the practical politicians of the
South, as a rule, lag behind the best
thought of their region, is indicated by the
spirit of a notable address delivered this
summer at the University of North Carolina,
by Colonel Robert Bingham, the most famous
of Southern schoolmasters. The occasion was
the fiftieth anniversary of his class-the class
of 1857. He spoke to the young men as
follows:.

"You must regain the national spirit which sectionalism
at the North and sectionalism at the South has obscured,
and which it has destroyed in many cases; and sectionalism,
whether at the North or at the South, has always been and
as long as it exists will continue to be a menace to the
greatness, power and glory of National America; and
National America is the only America of the future.
Southern men made the Nation at first. Jefferson wrote
the Declaration of Independence; Washington won that
independence ", Madison, more than any other man, created
the Constitution and secured its adoption; Marshall
interpreted it, and these were all Virginians."

After recalling that it was President Polk, an
alumnus of that university who "added the
Pacific coast to our domain and made us an
interoceanic power," and that it was William
A. Graham, another alumnus, who, as Secre-
tary of the Navy, "opened Japan-a thing

of international importance," he went
on to say:

"Why shall not a broad and national spirit expel the
narrow and sectional spirit whichyrevails. too much, in the
South; a spirit, which has dwarfed our statesmen so that
the Nation, as a Nation, has no need for them because the
Nation thinks them unfit? What Southern man is there
whom the whole Nation would think fit to be President
or Vice-President? The evil spirit of sectional America
must be exorcised. The national spirit of Washington,
Jefferson, Madison and Marshall of Virginia, Polk and
Graham of North Carolina, must be restored; and, young
men, why may not.some of you aspire to those highest
National positions so often occupied by Southern men in
the past P'

TEMPORARY-PERMANENT CONTROL IN CUBA

SECRETARY TAFT has again set a date
when he hopes for the return of the
Cuban government to the Cubans; and he
sets it in all sincerity. Doubtless at that date,
or at a later, the island will again make an
experiment at self-government.

But the opinion grows among all classes of
thoughtful men that the temporary govern-
ment of Cuba by the United States will be, as

9175

the British government of Egypt has become,
a temporaryadministration become permanent.
With intermissions and possibly with variations,
American control in Cuba is pretty sure to
continue indefinitely in some form or other.

This will occur against the will of most
Cubans, and against the professed will of
others, and without the wish of the American
people, but only by the working of natural
forces. Among these natural forces is, of
course, the demand of American capital (and
of all foreign capital) for security; for upon
this depends the industrial development of
the island.

If the auspiciously begun Palma administra...
tion ended for no cause except a native inability
to carry on the routine of government-the
irrcconcilability of mere partisan factions-no
other Cuban administration is likely at any
early time lo succeed. The ex-President is
now a voluntary exile on his remote plantation,
not a strong man, but a man who made a sincere
effort to serve his country; and the rather
lonely and pathetic end of his public career
points to the probable failure of any successor
that he may have.

All this does not relieve us of the necessity
to make an honest effort again to turn over the
government to the Cubans. We shall prob-
ably in due time do so. But the foreign
investors in the island and most other men who
have a serious stake there expect the United
States to give security to its government; and
they do not expect security in any other way.

THE ECONOMIC LAYMAN AND THE PREACHER

HE election of Mr. Harry A. Garfield,
successively lawyer, civic reformer, and
Professor in Princeton University, and the
oldest son of President Garfield, to the presi-
dency of Williams College marks the end of
another collegiate dynasty of clergymen. The
public-spirited, well-informed layman has
now displaced the preacher in Harvard, in
Yale, in Princeton, in the University of Chicago,
in Williams and in fact in most of the im-
portant colleges and universities. Most of the
State Universities have chosen laymen as
presidents from the beginnanf.

This emphasizes the losing influence of
theology and of the pulpit in modern life in
general and in modern intellectual life in par-
ticular, just as the proportion of college grad-
uates who enter the ministry has steadily
decreased. In a positive way it argues the
