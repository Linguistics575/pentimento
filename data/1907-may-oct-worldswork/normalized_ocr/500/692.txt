9490 THE NEW SCIENCE OF BUSINESS

fell behind, I got a note which took away my
appetite for days. Do you suppose that, in
the face of those conditions, I was going to give
away my best men-to recommend for pro-
motion the men who, above all others, were
enabling me not only to run that office efficiently
and economically but to hold my position and
my reputation? Not much! It may sound
selfish but it's business. Business and human
nature. I didn't propose to hurt myself and
build up some other department by giving
away the good men whom I had had the trouble
of breaking in."

Such are the experiences and points of view
of the captains of 50,000 men, of 2,500 men,
and of 40 men. They all point to one logical
conclusion-that no true, systematic method
of sifting the tt good men" from among a large
mass of employees has yet been devised.

No doubt most industrial managers appre-
date this fact, and many have made efforts, in
various ways, to devise a method for recording
individual work and capabilities of all em-
ployees. But the difficulties of doing this in a
thorough manner are always very great, and
often insurmountable. A system of inviting
suggestions upon the work has proved success-
ful in some cases, but usually the "suggestion"
idea is so poorly devised and followed up as to
be even worse than useless. Two instances
show how it works for or against a company.

The first is the case of a great machine-shop
in New England, employing more than 8,000
hands. A bulletin inviting suggestions from
employees has been posted in every depart-
ment of the plant for the last three years.

To an outsider, that bulletin looks all right;
especially one sentence which seems to show
the underlying desire to obtain some clue to
the "good men."

I asked one of the most valued mechanics
in the shop how it worked.

"Nothing doin'!" he replied, "and never
has been. Look hcrel" he continued with
real earnestness, "Supposing I knew of some
little rig that would expedite work; d'ye sup-
pose Pd throw it in unless it was big enough to
get a patent on and give me good money?
Not much! Here's the way it works. If I
send it to the manager, he lays it before the
foreman and the foreman gets sore at me
because he hadn't thought of it himself.
That's human nature. No foreman likes to

have one of his workmen butting in on his job
---and he's pretty apt to let the man know it.

"Then, again, if it's something that's adopted
it makes a change in the work and often in
the piece-work price, and then the poor devil
who suggested it has all his fellow workmen
down on him. That's the way it worked at
first, and every man in the plant knows it, and
I'll bet they don't get, now, five suggestions a
year!"

That has been the fate, in a great number
of factories, of the "suggestion" idea. One
company has been more far-seeing and con-
sequently more successful. Boxes are placed
in its various shops and the suggestions de-
posited therein are seen only by the manager.
If the idea is of value, it is adopted after con-
sultation with the foreman or other authorities,
but the origin of the suggestion is not made
known. An adequate cash reward reaches the
man or, if the idea is patentable,' a fair arrange-
ment is made with him; but his relations with
his foreman or fellow workmen are not dis-
turbed. Consequently, no workman is likely
to hold back any idea, either of expediting
production or eliminating waste.

The manager has on file all of these sug-
gestions, good or useless, and gradually a list
is built up of the men who have made them.
At opportune times the manager interviews
these men, to estimate them. He has thus
secured the names and locations of a few prob.
ably "good men" out of the thousands of
employees.

The foregoing are illustrations of a system
well applied, and poorly applied; but in the
best practice it is an unscientific makeshift
for finding "good men.".

Another method has been tried by the
manager of a locomotive-building plant. He
notified the foremen of the various shops that he
would pay for a correspondence course of
technical education for any two young men in
their departments whom they might recom-
mend--sixteen in all. There was no hiding
of good men in this case. The foremen knew
that the education of those young fellows
would not interfere with their shop work, and
they nominated the best-the most promising
they had. The plan is successful. The manager
is finding his good men right in his own works;
but he had to devise that ingenious and some-
what expensive scheme to do so.
