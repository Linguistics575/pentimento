PENNSYLVANIA'S PALACE OF GRAFT

work. A clerk has testified that Huston gave
him Cobb's blue-prints to copy and locked
him up secure from intrusion while the copying
was going on. Cobb is threatening to sue the
state for the use of his design and for his com-
mission as the architect. Whether the plans
were Huston's or Cobb's, the work went on
apace, and last summer the structure was
announced as finished, and within the appro-
priation. The Commission made much ado
over having on hand a balance of $ 35,000.

HOW THE PLUNDERING WAS POSSIBLE

There is in Pennsylvania a state board
charged with the care and repair of public
grounds and buildings, to which allusion has
already been made. It consists of the Gover-
nor, the State Treasurer, and the Auditor-
General. In order to facilitate the discharge
of its duties, there is a convenient law on the
statute books authorizing it at any time to use
money in the treasury not otherwise appropri-
ated. Coal might be needed for the state
officials' offices, or new carpet for the legislative
chambers, and it was deemed proper that such
things should be available without any red
tape. One will notice that the three officers
intrusted with the duty and the power to use
funds are the three which would in any case
have to approve any account before payment
under any specific act. It was evidently felt
that there could hardly be any advantage taken
of this privilege to draw on the treasury by the
highest officers of the Commonwealth, all of
them elected by popular vote.

It did not take the Capitol Commission long
to decide among themselves that the $ 4,000,000
turned over to them was for a building only,
although the act called for a structure com-
pleted ready for occupancy. The fittings and
furnishings must come out of some other fund.
It was to be a grand capitol, a magnificent and
gorgeous Aladdin creation, and $ 4,000,000 was
none too much. At the same time, it did not
seem expedient to go to the legislature for a
further appropriation for the furnishing. This
Grounds and Buildings Board, with an unde-
fined right to draw on the state treasury,
supplied the one condition needed and its help
was enlisted. Its members also belonged to
the machine. Huston was made architect of
the furnishing also, and all things were thus
satisfactorily arranged for the game of graft.
After that, it was only necessary to get into the
treasury with a scoop shovel. There was no

limit but the bottom. The same authority
that warranted the use of a five-dollar bill
covered the use of the last five-dollar bill of
all the millions of surplus.

THE POWER OF THE MACHINE

The political machine in 1901 had been able
to appropriate $ 4,000,000 to build a new cap-
itol when its own agents had "completed"
one in 1899 for $ 550,000 and the legislature
had squarely refused to give another dollar.
It was able to employ its own architect, let
the contract to its own favorities, and to start
a carnival of graft unparalleled. It was able
so to juggle the contract for furnishing that
John H. Sanderson (who secured the entire
contract) knew months before it was let that
he was going to get it, and began work on it.
It was able to let that contract to the highest-
the only-bidder at prices that carried their
own condemnation on their face, and was able
also to keep them concealed. It was able to
substitute base and cheap metals for fine and
costly ones, cast work for lathe and hand-work,
lacquer instead of mercurial gold finish, and
to collect months in advance of delivery and
for much that was never furnished at all in any
finish. It was able to secure blank bill-heads
from sub-contractors and fill out fake bills
which were doubled and trebled and then
presented and paid without a word of objection.
It was able to use birch for mahogany, to sub-.
stitute putty for hand-carved molding, to fur-
nish Pittsburg glass instead of French Baccarat,
to measure air space by the cubic foot and sell
it to the state, to lay parquetry on cement and
Wilton on parquetry, to crowd unused rooms
with unusable supplies, to scamp and botch
and pretend in more ways than can be enu-
merated, and to draw money every time it
presented a piece of white paper. It was able
to levy for millions without any contract at all,
so far as has been shown.

It was able also to close the eyes and seal
the mouths of men elected to the highest
places of trust, and to put forth reiterated
statements that the whole job had been done
within the appropriation; and later that the
state had the worth of its money; and when
that was proven false, that the money didn't
come out of the pockets of the people anyway,
but from corporations. It was able to arrange
for the architect to draw commissions for
"specially designed work" that was for sale
in unlimited quantities in the open market,
