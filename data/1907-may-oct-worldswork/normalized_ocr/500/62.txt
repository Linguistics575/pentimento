that be," the rebates paid illegally to great
shippers, the discriminations exercised in favor
of certain classes of industries, the great com-
missions paid to bankers, the profits of pro-
moters--all are paid by the railroad to outside
parties.

Promoters and financiers are not railroad
employees. The millions upon millions of
dollars made by the construction companies
which built many of our roads did not go to
the men that did the work, but to the men that
conceived it and financed it. The blackmail
levied on towns in the new lands, in the shape
of subsidies, did not go into the hands of the
railroad men, but into the hands of the financiers.

Talking this matter over, one day, with Mr.
Frank Trumbull, president of the Colorado &
Southern Railway, who has been in the service
of the Western railroads since 1874, the favor-
able impression gained from the Pennsylvania
report was strengthened.

"It is nothing surprising," said he, "to one
who knows the railroad men. Carry it back
into the rebate period, and it will be much
stronger. I have known the West for more
than thirty years, years when the traffic men
made their own rates with shippers on the
lines without resource to the heads of the sys-
tems at all-and I cannot name to-day a single
man of all of them who feathered his own nest
at the cost of his company."

Can as much be said for any other profession
or employment in the world?

That period covers a multitude of conditions.
Up to only a few years ago, a very large pro-
portion of the traffic of the West was carried
on what were politely called "special rates."
That means that the shipper was charged a
rate, and the agent handed back to him a part
of the money paid over. The heads of the
system took the word of the agent for the
special rate, and credited him with the amount
he paid back.

Yet I found Mr. Trumbull's statement
borne out by others. On the same day, I
lunched with a retired official who once com-
manded the freight traffic of the Union Pacific.
He was one of the fathers of the rate system
of the West. He knew all about special rates,
midnight tariffs, and all the other irregularities
of the great and abiding game. I asked him
specifically whether they used any special
methods to check up the superintendents and
the agents in the long years when the road lay
open to plunder at the hands of its men.

THE HONOR OF THE RAILROAD MAN

"No," he said, "we didn't need to. We

knew we should get the returns all right!"
THE HONESTY OF THE BUILDERS

Turning to the other departments, the
engineers who run their lines through coun-
tries where the coming of the railroad means
everything, the men who scatter the cars that
make or unmake the fortunes of the farmers
and the shippers, one finds the same thing
true.

It has often been charged that the engineers
who ran the original survey of the Union Pacific
made it as long as they could, to get the Gov-

* ernment subsidy and to make their own picked

lands valuable. Mr. J. B. Berry, now chief
engineer of the Rock Island, had charge of
the reconstruction of the Union Pacific under
Mr. Harriman, when all men strove above all
else to shorten the road from the original
survey.

"Well," says Mr. Berry, "we have spent
something like $ 25,000,000 on this old road,
and we have saved the whole of twenty miles
between Omaha and Ogden-and that's several
thousand miles of distance."

So disappears a slander that has stood as
gospel for nearly twenty years.

No one knows just how much pressure is
brought to bear upon the men who run the
railroad lines through new country. The man
who squints along the transit makes or unmakes
the fortune of the speculator who has bought
up his thousands of acres along the possible
rights-of-way. The speculator is always
willing to "divvy-up." In fact, he presses
upon the engineer the offer of cash, of lands,
of all sorts and conditions of emoluments. In
nine cases out of every ten, the engineer refuses.

There is a half-preserved record of an en-
gineer who was running a railroad in Missouri
---1 think it was the present'Frisco main line
west from St. Louis. He ran it across a pitiful
farm, while the two lads of the farm watched
him in great suspense. Presently, one of
them went to the house and came back armed
with a long muzzle-loading rifle. He sat on a.
stump while his brother came to reason with
the engineer. The latter was obdurate. So
was the boy.

"You will get more than your land is worth,"
said the engineer, "and the rest of it will be
worth three times as much as the whole of it
is worth to-day. What do you want, anyhow i"'

The boy explained that the "old man" was
