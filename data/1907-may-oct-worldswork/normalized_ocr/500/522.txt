foods are perfectly harmless, and others are
deadly. They should all be classified in
national law. Some methods of preserving
meats are practically harmless, if the meats are
thoroughly soaked and washed free from the
drugs; but who shall make the method fool-
cook proof? Some adulterations are not only
harmless, but actually desirable.

NO "GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED" FOODS

The patent-medicine industry is rapidly
being put in well deserved strait-jackets, but
it has set the pace for makers of patent and
proprietary foods. The objection is not to
honest refinement in food manufacture, but
to trade-marking foods whose composition is
kept secret, and whose values are whatever
the makers' standards of morality choose to
claim for them..

The new Pure Food law prohibits specified
articles in candy-making; prohibits mixture of
a cheaper article with one claiming to be all of
the best, as mixing "compound lard" with
pure leaf lard and calling it all "pure leaf lard";
or adding any injurious substance to such
standard, such as an injurious amount of
benzoic acid, or cochineal to ketchup; but
it does not declare how much is injurious, nor
does it even classify preservatives and coloring
matters into "safe" and "unsafe," but it
prohibits the use of anything that conceals
inferiority, such as red ochre on hamburger
steak, to make a stale article look fresh. It
permits an unhealthy amount of preservative
to be used on meats intended for distant ship-
ment, provided it can be washed or macerated
out by water before being cooked, but the label
must give directions for such removal. It
prohibits any use of spoiled meats or vegetables;
so it may prevent the manufacture of ketchup
from the soured tomato remnants of a canning
factory, or curtail the use of renovated butter
or spoiled milk. It prohibits the use of trade-
marks by other than rightful owners; and
labeling that tends to deceive, such as naming
the product by the principal ingredient only.
It prohibits false statements as to weight and
measure, and any falsification on the label or
package; but this does not prevent "drawing
the long bow" in advertising. It permits
secrecy to proprietary food makers as to exact
composition, provided the makers satisfy the
Government that no harmful ingredients are
used. This lets the public know that the article
will not do any harm, but guts no limit on

WHAT THE FOOD LAW SAVES US FROM

the exaggerated claims that may be made
for it. The law registers an article under
a given number on statement by its manu-
facturer or wholesaler that it is sold in con-
formity with the law, and that he is respon-
sible, not the retailer, in case of a suit for
damages. This unfortunate use of the word
"guarantee" has been falsely used to lead the
public to believe that the Government guaran-
tees the purity and wholesomeness of the article,
whereas it does nothing of the sort. Secretary
Wilson has recently issued a special order to
put a stop to this deceptive practice.

MORE GOVERNMENT EXPERTS NEEDED

Authority is conferred upon the Secretary
of Agriculture, and by him conferred upon the
Bureau of Chemistry, to from time to time
make "regulations" which shall arbitrarily
decide what are wholesome or harmful foods,
preservatives, coloring matters, essences, etc.
It also allows interested manufacturers to be
heard before such regulations are issued.
Thus, what was lacking in specification in the
food law is to be incorporated from time to
time. Our Bureau of Chemistry becomes our
national formulary of foods. In the absence
of any national food "Pharmacopeia," we
must rely upon Dr. Wiley and his advisers to
rule upon the wisdom of using benzoic acid,
salicylic acid, formaldehyde, coal-tar essences
and dyes, and a multitude of unsettled food
problems. But the medical profession believes
that such arbitrary powers should be placed in
the hands of a number of experts, for the sub-
ject is too vast to permit any one man to master
it, even with many subordinate experts to
advise him.

DANGER IN THE BROKEN PACKAGE

If a high-class firm sells pure leaf lard in
large tierces to the retailer for one price, ordi-
nary hog lard for less, and "compound lard"
(cotton-seed oil and stearine) cheaper yet, and
the retailer mixes the cheapest with the best
and sells to the consumer out of the best
lard's can, and at best lard's price, it becomes
a gross fraud.

Now the Government makes the manu-
facturer, not the retailer, responsible for
reliability here. The food situation, therefore,
seems to drive us to the unbroken package, in
everything capable of adulteration by the
retailer, or specially tempting to him. In
such a list sausage, lard, maple syrup, wines,
