SAFEGUARDS FOR INVESTORS

HERE has never been a period in the

I history of Wall Street when the con-

scientious bankers and brokers were
more careful in giving advice to intending
purchasers of bonds and stocks than they are
to-day. So far at least as the real leaders of
the investment market are concerned, the
interests of the people are now honestly guarded
by the bankers.

There have been periods when the relation
of the investor to the Wall Street market was
the relation of the plundered to the plunderer.
For instance, at the top of the long rise in the
stock-market in 1891, in 1902, and at other
similar periods, even the most conservative
bankers continued strongly to advise their
customers to buy stocks without fear. But
at the top of the great rise that took place in
1906, a steady, infh1ential body of bankers,
without conference with one another but with
almost perfect unanimity, warned the people
to leave the stocks alone. This rank-and-file
of the Wall Street army has now turned "trai-
tor" to "the interests" and has raised a shout
of warning.

This is a hopeful sign. In the beginning,
the banker was supposed to be a safeguard to
the client, and hig advice was supposed to be
disinterested, and generally was. But in the
long period between the Civil War and the
year 1906, the banker degenerated. Instead
of calling himself a "banker," he called him-
self a "banker and broker." The old-line
banker became an anachronism. His real
investment client gradually disappeared, or
caught the speculative fever and began to
follow his mentor into "stock deals," "marginal
accounts," and all the other new-fangled
contrivances for separating him from his money.

Hundreds of so-called "banking houses"
arose in Wall Street that would have been a
disgrace to the name in the other days. As
time went on and the great financiers came into
prominence, they began to subordinate these
banking houses to their own individual interests.
When Smith, Brown & Co. had gained a
good list of clients and could therefore buy a
lot of stocks for investment, some great magnate
undertook to bring Smith, Brown & Co.

under his influence. Perhaps he would open
a small account with the house, and buy and
sell stocks through it. After a time, he would
invite the head of the house to lunch at his
club, compliment him upon the way in which
his orders were executed, intimate that the
account would be enlarged, and finally tell
him of a, great movement that was going to
take place in the marketmext week.

In time, Smith, Brown & Co. came to follow
the tips of the magnate. His customers made
money, and, as they always told their friends
about it, the clientele grew fast. The head
of the firm recognized that his position as a
"Keene broker," a "Gates broker," a "Hill
broker" or a "Harriman broker," as the case
might be, was the basis of his great sucess.
He kept in close touch with the magnate who
fed him. At last, generally at the top of a
big rise, the magnate began to hint of some
great thing to be accomplished. Perhaps
a stock dividend was to be declared; perhaps
it was an increase in the dividend to IO per
cent.; perhaps it was a great "deal" for some
ore lands; perhaps it was only a huge specula-
tive pool that was to be formed. In any case,
the banker was led on to high hopes. He
handed them to his clients. They bought
thousands of shares of stock. They "made
the market," as they say in Wall Street.

Then came the crash. Exactly this thing
happened in 1903, when nearly every great
commission house in Wall Street had become
identified more or less closely with one or
other of the great "special interests," and had
systematically "loaded" its customers with
the stocks of the interest to which the head of
the firm owed allegiance. To a far less extent
the same thing happened in the fall of 1906,
especially in the stocks that are roughly
grouped as "Harriman stocks" and "Hill
stocks." In each case, the things promised
by the magnates actually came to pass, but
they were not followed by further great rises
in price, but by terrible declines.

It was at this point that the real body of the
Wall Street bankers broke away from the in-
fluence of the financial kings, and swore anew
its old allegiance to the interests of the public
