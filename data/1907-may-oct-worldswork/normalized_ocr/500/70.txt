FUR



A TRAPPER'S CABIN IN THE IDAHO WOODS

consider that many of the best Siberian furs are
hunted by Siberian exiles from the Chuckchee
Peninsula to China, it is seen that the romance
of this field is as glamorous as that hanging over
the canoeman of Canadian rivers, or the sea
otter hunter of the Aleutians, or the lawless
dare-devil poacher of the seal islands.

I know of no way to reckon what the volume
of the world's fur trade may be, even at a wild
guess. Let me explain why. Canada, which
has been called tt the 1vorld's fur preserve," now
yearly exports about $ 2,500,000 worth of furs.
But this does not include Alaska, which

TRADE OF THE WORLD

sends out $ yyo, tocxo worth a year, nor the
Moravian missionaries of Labrador, who send
out some of the best pelts in the world.
Neither does it include the seal islands which,
up to 1890, must have shipped out $ 2,000,000
worth of furs a year. Put the value of furs
north of the 49th parallel at $ 6,000,000, and
you have not included what has been used for
the home market. While the rarest furs are
exported to be dressed and manufactured, the
common furs are dressed and manufactured
at home; and the aggregate value of the cheap-
est fur-muskrat--equals the aggregate value
of the rarest fur. For instance, in 1883, when
the Hudson's Bay Company sold 47,500 of
marten, they sold 1,000,000 muskrat. How
many muskrats were kept for home use in
Canada, it is impossible to tell. The same
may be said of raccoon and badger and otter.

When you come to consider the American
market, the facts are still more confusing; for
Canadian furs bought by American shippers at
St. Paul, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York are
shipped from American ports classified as
American furs. Experts state that $ 5,000,000
of furs are sold by auction in London every
year; but that does not cover the sale of furs
by private contracts, which often takes place
when the price is either especially high or very
low. Nor does it cover the sales of furs which
some of the great houses collect in the raw state
and manufacture for themselves without putting
the raw furs on the market at all
