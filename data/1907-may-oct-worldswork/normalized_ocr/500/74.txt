was c. in of the realm in America and the only

However desirable it might be for the trapper,

They must be trapped. It will interest the
public to know that the grease scraped from
the inside of the skunk pelt is used for soap.
The pelt itself is deodorized by rolling and
trampling in mahogany sawdust. It is too
early yet to predict whether the skunk farms
of certain Western States will prove profitable

or only a passing experiment, like the beaver
farming attempted a few years ago north of
Lake Superior. Over 600,000 skunk skins
a year come from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio,
and the group of central northwest states. In
fact, all fur farming so far-except blue fox on
the West Coast, silver on the East Coast, and
lamb farming in Persia and Russia, where the
animals thrive because they are left in their
natural state-seems foredoomed to failure.

Fur comes to its greatest excellence only
when the animal has that wide ranging of its
natural state which ensures robust health.
Cold weather always deepens and crisps the
furs, even furs of a warm climate, like the chin-
chilla. Speaking as a lay observer and not
as a scientist, chinchilla is something of a cross
between a rabbit and a rat. Owing to its
delicacy of color and lightness in weight, it will
