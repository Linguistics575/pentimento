a rule, they go in small groups. There is yet
no large continuous stream, except to Texas.

Italians have begun to go, especially to and
through New Orleans. There has been much
controversy about the Italian as a cotton grower.
But there is no doubt of his success, as the fol-
lowing test, described for these pages by Mr.
Alfred H. Stone, will show.

"The test was made on the'Sunny Side' property, On
the Mississippi River, in Chicot Country, Arkansas. The
number of Italian squads in 1898 was 38, with 200 working
hands, cultivating 1,200 acres of cotton. Of Negro squads
there were 203, with 600 working hands, cultivating 2,600
acres of cotton. At the end of 1905, after eight years, there
were on the property 107 Italian squads, with Soo working
hands, and 38 Negro families, with 175 working hands----
an increase of 69 squads and 300 hands for the Italians,
a decrease of 165 squads and 425 hands for the Negroes.
The total cotton acreage had increased to 3,900, of which
the Italians were cultivating 3,000 acres and the Negroes

900. The figures in detail from 1899 to 1904 make the
following exhibit:

Average cash product value per

Average cash product per acre. - "44. 77 26.36

"Thus the Italian seems to have produced more lint per
hand, by 1,410 pounds, or 120.1%, and to have exceeded
the Negro's yield per acre by 170 pounds, 01 72.9%. The
difference in money value in favor of the Italian was
$ 148.89 per hand, or I 15.8%, and $ 18.41 per acre, or 69.8%.

"Of the 110 Italian squads who started to work at the
beginning of 1905, 44 were new arrivals. Of the total
number, I; squads, or S9 per cent., had no supply accounts
for the year. Of the 61 Negro families who started to
work at the beginning of 1905, only 2, or 3.2 per cent. of
the whole, had no such accounts. To the 66 Italian
families in 1904, cash balances above accounts were paid
in the sum of $ 38,764.58, an average of $ 587.35 per family.
Of the I IO Negro families in 1904, two drew total balances
of $ 480.50, while the firm had on its books at the end of the
year the sum of $ 6,456.20 in Negro balances due.

"There were 107 Italian squads at the end of 1905. Of
these 104 owned 123 head of work stock, and other live
stock, such as cattle, sheep and hogs, to the total value of
$ 23,400. Only 3 squads owned no stock. Of the 38
Negro squads, 21 owned work and live stock to the total
value of $ 3,360, and 17owned no stock."

The thorough and earnest way in which the
South is going about this work is shown by the

IMMIGRATION TO THE SOUTH

organization which Mr. J. A. Betjeman, of
Georgia, is perfecting in that state. In every
community, committees are formed to secure
trustworthy information, which is written on
proper blanks and classified. From these it
may instantly be found out what sort of men are
wanted in any community, what is the work to
be done, what the wages, what the arrangements
for living, and what the cost. In the same
way opportunities for farmers are classified.
The Georgia Bureau of Immigration can in...
form a man in Sweden or in Canada just where
he can buy a farm of so many acres that will
produce so much of such and such products,
what it will cost him, what it will cost per year
to cultivate it, etc., etc. This kind of work
does not produce great results immediately;
but in time it will greatly add to the popula-
tion of the state. For the immigrants that
come to the South and are satisfied induce
others to follow. Some of these who landed
at Charleston found work in the mills at
Greenville, S. C. After a few months they
held a meeting and sent one of their number
back to Belgium to bring over as many of their
friends and relatives as he could induce to
come. Toward the last of February, he
arrived with thirty-five. Others of their fellow-
passengers formed a colony near Columbia.
Within a few weeks they had selected a place,
bought their truck farms, and were engaged in
getting the ground ready for planting. They
have already been joined by friends from
Canada and expect others from Belgium.

The chief difficulties yet are: first, the almost
universal ignorance in regard to the South, or
(worse) widespread definite errors about it--
that it is not healthful, that it is not orderly,
that it is oppressively hot; second, the lowness
of wages. Wages have enormously increased
during the last five years; but in most regions
they are yet somewhat below wages in the North
and West. But living is yet cheaper. The
strong tendency is to equalize these conditions
directly in proportion to the development of
cheap transportation.

The most sensible immigration is of farmers,
whether from the Northern States or from
Europe. It is to these that great opportunities
are offered. Trucking near the cities or on
railroad lines and cotton-growing are especially
profitable-so profitable that a practically
unlimited number of men, who will learn the
business, can quickly earn a competence, and
the ablest of them build fortunes.
