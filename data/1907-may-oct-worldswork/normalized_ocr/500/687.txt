ENGLAND'S HOUSE OF LORDS

Cabinet, and discussing national questions with
expert knowledge and absolute decorum.

WHEN LORDS AND COMMONS CLASH

The other side of the picture is very different.
There comes a time when the Lords step out
as a second chamber of the most powerful and
distinctive type and show an individuality of
which the F rench Senate has never dreamed.
The situation that then arises is, in a democratic
country, most extraordinary. The nation, at
a general election, returns a Liberal House of
Commons. The King, by constitutional usage,
at once appoints a Liberal Cabinet. The Cabi-
net passes a Liberal bill through the House of
Commons, and at once from all quarters of the
globe flock Conservative peers to Westminster
to defeat that bill in their chamber and balk its
passage into law. The hereditary chamber has
thwarted the will of the peoples' representa-
tives. The exasperation of the House of Com-
mons, the rage of Liberal Ministers, the scandal
to democratic ideals can better be imagined
than described. And there is no practical
remedy. It is true that the King, by a stroke
of the pen, could create the necessary goo peers
to give the Liberal party a majority in the House
cf Lords; but it is one of those many things
thich might, but do not, happen. Without
any vAtication, it must be admitted that in
this emocratic country the hereditary house
i' C2icetiises, on the rare occasions when it chooses
"cu use it, a, legal and practical power of ob-
: Itiction against which it is hopeless to
scaten'l within the existing Consti ution.

Conservatives who will condescend to im-

agine, let us say, a House of Nonconformist "

parsons with the power of vetoing the measures
put forwa.d when the Conservative party is in
office, will be forced to recognize the natural
justice of Liberal rage against the Lords on these
occasions. Logical and obvious, however, as
is the Liberal plea of representation versus
heredity, a test must be applied which in Eng-
land is far above logic. Logic, indeed, is not
an English attribute. The Constitution exists
on no ideal plan, but it lives from day to day as
a rough-and-ready engine for effecting the
fundamental purpose of government in this
country-the realization of the peoples' will.
Of Lords and Commons alike, this is the func-
tion. And when they differ, when one house

votes this way and the other that way, the one
that is doing its duty by the English Constitu-
tion is the one that the people, on a referendum,

would hold to be right. All parties agree on
this. To say, as less thoughtful Liberals do,
that the representative chamber must neces-
sarily think the same as the people who created
it, is to beg the question. It is more; it is to
deny the truth. For, odd and perverse as it
may seem, the pages of history record no
single occasion since 1832 when the Lords
have seen their action condemned by a gen-
eral election.

The Constitutional theorist is here faced by a
most peculiar historical fact. On the only
serious occasion when the Lords and the repre-
sentative chamber have come to blows, in 1893,
the people took the first opportunity of sweeping
away-not the Lords, but the existing Liberal
House of Commons. Why and how this arises
is beyond the wit of democratic man to see.
The occasion may not be repeated. To-day,
when again the Lords have thwarted the Com-
mons, the electoral decision may be different.
The indications, however, are not altogether
that way. And if the theorist will abase him-
sel to the level of an erring human being, he
may catch a fleeting notion of some inner sub-
tleties of the art of representation which are
revealed to babes and sucklings, but which wise
men seek in vain. The Lords, when they come
in their hundreds, are Englishmen and not
politicians. They are prejudiced, they are
dull, they are human, they are averse to change.
And so are the English people. Liberals are
just men with most enlightened minds, and so
was Aristides. But there came a day in Athens
when the people banished Aristides, because,
in the ever-memorable story, "they were tired
of hearing him called the Just." Philosophy
may one day be able to account on some such
lines for the peculiar fact that the Lords have
never offended, and have once emphatically
asserted, the existing opinion of the English
people as against a Liberal Government.

The final view of this strange chamber is
that it permanently represents the stolid char-
acteristics of the English race, which is at once
democratic and conservative. Its virtues and
vices are those of common Englishmen. It
never leads; it sometimes follows with relue
tance. But the instinct that guides it, bad or
good, is the instinct of the ordinary man who
cares for politics far less than for sport. Just
as the prejudices of the Sultan of Turkey are
those of his benighted subjects, so, if the lowest
view be taken, is the obstruction of the Lords
the obstruction of the people. The Commons
