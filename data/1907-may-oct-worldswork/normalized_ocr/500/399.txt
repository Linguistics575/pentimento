THE TIME TO QUIT WORK

much he is good for and has made careful
calculations, he is likely to be "all in" before
he gets to the end. Every step makes an
inroad on his reserve energy. The last spurt
costs more than all the rest together.

If a man has covered his distance without
touching this final turn of the fatigue curve,
he will get rested in a reasonably short time
and be able to go over the course again. But if,
instead, he has to keep on, teeth set, eyes
bulging, "hugging his corn cobs," until he
rolls over on the ground, it may take weeks for
him to get into good form again. In a big
race, naturally, hc's got to be ready to do that.

There are emergencies in cvcrybody's life
when the merely prudent thing isn't the right
thing. If a house is on fire and a family on
the top floor is in danger, and you're the only
person on the premises, you can't stand calmly
aside and calculate your fatigue curve. There's
a necessity for action-at any cost whatever,
even life.

A man may have a big proposition to put
through, some important combination to effect,
a new movement to get under way. Perhaps
he is the only person who knows the whole
situation: success may depend on him. In
such a case, he must let mere prudence go by
the board-and he must stand ready to pay
the price, too, when that's called for.

But such emergencies are not everyday
matters. To-morrow we are going to have
another day's business to attend to, and the
probability is that it will be just as important
as to-day's. Consequently, we have no right
to over-drive ourselves to-day; for the price
of it will be taken out of the quality of to-mor-
row's work. We have done enough when we
have come in sight of that last costly lap. It's
the time to quit.

A great deal of interesting information about
the nature of fatigue has been made available
through the ergograph, an ingenious recording
apparatus devised by Professor Angelo Mosso,
a great Italian scientist. It works something
after this fashion: you lay your hand, back
down, on a little table, and to the end of one
finger is attached a cord which connects hori-
zontally over a pulley with a small hanging
weight. The motion of closing the finger lifts
the weight; and as the effort is repeated over
and over again, the fatigue symptoms in the
finger become clear and can be observed and
recorded in detail.

Now one of the important discoveries that

Professor Mosso has made is that, if you keep
raising the weight until your finger is exhausted,
it will take just about two hours to rest it; that
is, in two hours you can do the same amount
of finger-work over again-and the least bit
more.

You would imagine from this that if the
experiment wore repeated at the end of one
hour instead of two, you could do just half the
amount of work. But it's only one-quarter
as much!

That's the price of work on top of fatigue.
One unfatigued man is to his work as four
semi-fatigued men to the same work. Using all
the strength you have, you can't begin to get
normal results; and the strain on will and
nervous energy is tcrrific. Carrying a thing
through on "nerve" is the costliest business
a man can indulge in.

Some people, especially those of nervous
make-up, find it hard to tell when the stopping
point has been reached-that is, just where the
dividing line comes between energy-funds
available for investment and a capital which
cannot be legitimately tampered with. If they
get interested in their work, they lose sight of
everything else, and are going on sheer nerve
before they realize it.

Though fatigue symptoms vary greatly in
different people, it may be worth while to men-
tion a few of them here. Sometimes there is
a flushing at the temples. That is the case
with myself when I have been reading hard
for two or three hours; and then I know that
I ought to call a halt. I could keep on reading
with undiminished interest for a good deal
longer; but it would be at the price of a sleep-
less night.

With some people, a sure sign is the increased
circulation of blood in the ears or checks.
Some people have queer feelings in the pit of
the stomach-not nausea, but something sug-
gestive of it.

One of the most reliable tests is the control
test-holding the arms out horizontally at the
sides and noticing whether or not the fingers
tremble. The fatigue condition raises the
nerve-pressure gate and allows flow-overs from
one nerve into another. Normally a nervous
impulse goes along its nerve directly to the point
of strain; but when you are fatigued the stimu-
lus spreads into other nerves as well and is not
distinctly transmitted.

Sir Francis Galton, the great statistician,
says that the best test he knows is that of
