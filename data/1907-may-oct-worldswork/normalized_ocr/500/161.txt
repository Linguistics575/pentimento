IMMIGRATION TO THE SOUTH

THE PRESSING DEMAND FOR MORE WHITE LABOR ON THE

FARM AND IN THE

OTHING shows more clearly the work-
N ing of new economic forces in the
South than the practically universal
cry for immigrants; for, until recently, the
Southern people did not care for newcomers
and made no systematic or earnest effort to
secure them. But now, from Virginia to
Texas, domestic servants, mill operatives, farm
hands, skilled laborers, or small farmers-or
all-sire in demand. The new era of industry
has revealed a scarcity of workers in every
department of work. It is estimated that
20 per cent. of the spindles in the Southern
mills are idle for the lack of operatives. There
are regions where the ripe cotton was not picked
from the fields last fall for the sheer lack of men,
women, or children to gather it; and the area
of t_illed land would be increased if there were
men to work it. A gentleman in Savannah who
was coming to New York, a month ago, was
accosted at the station by a railroad contractor
in these words: "John, for the love of Heaven,
see if you can't get me three hundred men----
Dagos or anybody---to shovel dirt. I don't
know what I am going to do!"

You ask, "Where are all the Negroes?" and
you find an apparent mystery. There are
more Negroes in the South to-day than there
ever were before. Yet one man will tell you
that they have surely gone away from his com-
munity. Another-many others-r-will tell you
that more of them are idle than formerly,
that the number has increased of those who will
work only two or three or four days a week.
"They get just enough to live on. Then they
loaf." But you do not see as many standing or
loafing at railroad stations or on the streets of
the towns as you might have seen ten years ago.

The fundamental truth is, the demand for
labor of all sorts has increased till it has far
outgrown the number of workers of both races.
A new pace in work has been set, and the man,
white or black, whose idleness caused no com-
ment ten years ago is now a burden and a
reproach.

A definite campaign to promote immigration

MILLS-THE KIND OF

has been earnestly begun in most of the states.
Mr. E. J. Watson, the Commissioner for South
Carolina, last fall induced the North German
Lloyd Steamship Company to bring more
than 400 immigrants to Charleston. Five
hundred and seventy-five were booked, but on
the morning when many of the Belgian families
were to start, the local papers printed in glar-
ing headlines the news of the Atlanta riot and
a hundred of them refused to go. The cost
of their coming was paid mainly by a fund of
$ 20,000 raised by the manufacturers and given
to the state for this purpose. Out of this grew a
long controversy, with which the public is
familiar, and which is not yet ended. It will
probably end in a decision that a state may
bring in assisted immigrants without violating
the contract-labor clause of the immigration
law. At any rate, Commissioners of several
states recently went abroad to secure immi-
grants for the South, including Governor Smith
of Georgia and Mr. P. H. Gadsden of South
Carolina. Mr. Watson is also in Europe to
make arrangements for a permanent line from
Bremen to Charleston.

The Southern Commissioners meet with
unexpected and even amazing difficulties in
Europe. They find that maps of the United
States have been distributed which have vast
areas of the South printed in yellow, indicating
the "yellow-fever belt," and other areas in
black indicating regions where white men do
not and cannot live; and some Southern Com-
missioners have been asked in Europe if new-
comers are not enslaved in the South. The
task, therefore, of quickly turning a strong tide
Southward is not so easy as it ought to be.
There are purely artificial as well as tra-
ditional objections to overcome.

The immigrants that are most wanted are
native-born farm hands and mill hands, but
American farm hands are scarce everywhere,
for the capable men soon become farmers.
A very large number of persons-families
are going from the North-Central and the
Northwestern States into the South; but, as
