THE COMING AIR-SHIP-A SUGGESTION

Hay during his last years of diplomatic work
and by Secretary Taft in his dealings with our
Asiatic dependencies. This is to say that there
will be a larger demand in the future for
American statcsmanship of this calibre and
quality than there has ever before been.

OUR REFUSAL T0 PLUNDER CHINA

IN A COMMENDABLE spirit of fairness

and generosity, the Administration has
revised the indemnity figures that represent
the debt of China to the United States as a
r. sult of the Boxer troubles. Under the proto-
col, signed on September 7, 1901, China agreed
to pay to the United States, in forty years,
$ 24,440,000 and interest at the rate of 4 per
cent. The Administration has agreed to
remit this debt on the payment of $ 11,055, -
OOO, of which $ 6,000,000 has already been
paid.

Of course, this administrative act, since it
alters the terms of settlement established by a
treaty agreement, must be ratified by Congress
before it goes into effect. Since it is admitted
by the Government that the revised figures
cover all the actual cost to this country
through the Boxer outbreak, Congress cannot
very well afford to refuse to ratify the amend-
ment. A failure to do so would amount to
aconfession that this country desires money
more than it desires a reputation for common
honesty.

The important and interesting phase of the
matter is the fact that the revision throws more
than a reasonable doubt upon all the awards
made under that protocol. If the United
States award was unjust, or, as Mr. Root gently
calls it "a maximum," what of the Russian
award of $ 87,300,000, the German award of
$ 60,000,000, the F rench award of $ 56,000,000?
The plain truth is, that China was, one might
say, sand-bagged by the Christian Powers
in 1901, as weak nations have generally been.
The United States alone, so far, has recorded
a refusal to keep the plunder. This is not so
much a credit to us as it is a discredit to the
other governments.

But there is no doubt that such an act of
friendliness will find its echo in our commercial
balance sheets. And with China, in particular,
we need all the good-will that we can create.
It is too soon to forget the Chinese boycott.
No step that could be taken could do more to
reestablish the friendly trade relations that
so lately were disturbed.

AMERICAN AND BRITISH CONCENTRATION OF
WEALTH

HE concentration of a large part of the
wealth of the United States in the hands
of a few men is one of the disquieting facts of
our era of great organization. But, far as this
concentration has gone in our country, it is
not comparable to the concentration of the
sources of wealth and of financial power under
the older class-governments of Europe.

For example, a writer in the Contemporary
Review estimates, from the receipts of the
income-tax and from similar data that "about
95 per cent. of the entire wealth of the United
Kingdom is owned by about one-ninth of its
population." He estimates. that about 200,000
or at most 250,000 families own nearly the
whole of the accumulated wealth of the king-
dom; and he adds:

"This small group of people exercises the effective
government of the nation by its control of the means of
production. The'Government' at Westminster is
impotent because, like the mass of our people, it has little
or no property. The'investments' of the State, like the
'investments' of the masses, form a negligible quantity
And those rule who own."

All such statistics are avowed estimates, but
after a liberal allowance has been made for
error, the fact of a tremendous concentration
remains.

In the United States there are two great
forces that make for the distribution of wealth--
our vast productive agricultural area which
permits (even compels) the ownership of the
land by the masses, and the prohibition of
entail. Concentration has come in our country
chiefly by reason of industrial organization
and the organization of transportation; and
upon this problem we are surely making some
interesting experiments.

THE COMING AIR-SHIP-A SUGGESTION

HE world is still eagerly waiting for a
successful flying machine. Although
much has been done in an experimental way
and short flights have been accomplished, we
still fall short of success. The best of the flying
machines and dirigible balloons constructed
to date have been hardly more than scientific
toys.

With appreciation of the efforts and results
of the experimenters, it must be said that they
have been trying to fly through the air with
the fins and tail and by the motions of a, fish
