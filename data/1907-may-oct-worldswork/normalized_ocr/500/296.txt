bill to prevent this practice of "shanghaiing"
became a law at the last session of Congress.

A "Sailor's Log Book" was prepared by Mr.
Richard D. Currier, in charge of the Seamen's
Branch. This gives in condensed form the
laws pertaining to sailors and their rights on
the high seas: The edition of 5,000 copies was
quickly distributed, and the results of its
publication have already appeared in the better
understanding by the seafarers of their rights
against boarding-house keepers and the various
"crimps" who molest them on shore. Mr.
Currier cites two instances as typical of the use
of this "Log":

"One sailor secured a copy of the pamphlet in a reading
room in New York and learned through reading the book
of a certain right which he had, but had never known before.
Relying upon the statement in the'Log' as correct, he
made a trip to Baltimore to enforce his newly discovered
right against a vessel upon which he had just been
employed. The outcome of his trip was entire ] y successful.
Perhaps the greatest compliment paid the book was that
given by a seaman's society which devotes much time to
distributing libraries on vessels. This society began send-
ing out a copy to each library. Soon a great protest was

THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD

raised on the part of the captains, who complained bitterly
about the book, because they said that it was teaching the
sailors too much law. One captain went so far as to
threaten to throw a whole library overboard unless the
pamphlet was removed. Rather than Injure the usefulness
of the libraries in general, the society decided to discon-
tinue the use of the'Sailor's Log.' Although praise of a
negative character, it is very gratifying to the Seamen's
Branch."

The New York Society issued a similar book
for the use of servants.

All of the societies are supported mainly by
voluntary contributions. At a performance at
the Metropolitan Opera House for the benefit
of the New York Society, Mark Twain said:

"There is something so eloquent about those plain,
unadorned statistics and the quoted incidents that it would
not be in human nature for either the highest or the lowest
in the land to read them and not be strongly moved to
desire the privilege of sharing in the Society's generous
crusade in the behalf of the oppressed and friendless."

It is not charity; it has no pauperizing effects.
It is merely providing that all men shall have
justice and "a square deal."

THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD

HOW THE LAST STRONGHOLDS OF BARBARISM ARE YIELDING TO CIVILIZATION
BY

C. M. KEYS

HERE is nothing in the world more

I astonishing than the rapidity with which

the outlying and until lately unprogres-
sive corners of the earth are yielding to the
uplifting influences of Western civilization and
commerce. All around the world the story
is the same, the story of modern methods in
regions but a few years ago barely reached by
the scouts of progress..

Perhaps the Transvaal and the other South
African colonies of Great Britain are the most
striking example at the moment. Until to-day,
the reputation of South Africa has been sin-
ister. Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria,
Buluwayo, Ladysmith-the names are eloquent
of battle. They recall the militant pilgrimage
of the Boers, seeking a land where slavery
might thrive; the Zulu Impi, and its mad
charge upon the circle of Cape wagons; the
sufferings of a Livingstone, wandering hopeless
through a hopeless land; at the last, the rum-
blings of Boer and British cannon, the patient

march and countermarch, the long siege, the
death march echoing from hill to hill.

But the names are taken to-day from the
time-table of the railroad. They are the
central points of a countrythat is growing, that
is becoming civilized, that has put off the ways
of war and has become a trader in the marts
of peace. A little time ago, General Botha,
perhaps the best of the Boer leaders, was
elected Premier of South Africa. To-day,
there are hundreds of Zulus, Matabeles, and
other once warlike Africans working for daily
wages in the mines, the markets, and the fields
of British South Africa.

And all these colonies and all their central
markets are linked together with the double
band of steel, the railroad, emblem of the Age
of Progress. Splendid trains whirl out of
Cape Town, and away into the Northern Out-
land. The glare of electric lights from the
windows sweeps the broad veldt where yes-
terday Gordon, the peaceful hunter, gazed
