as all of these put together may have an enor-

The fallacy of Socialism is in supposing that
men are much more nearly equal than they are
in capacity. The best way to combat it is to
make men as nearly as possible equal before
the law and in opportunity. This means
the prevention of the improper economic or
political use of wealth. This is a task of
government, of the practical business world,
and of society. There is no formula whereby
it may be done. It can be done only by the
nurture of vigorous personalities and by the
maintenance of right social, economic, and
political standards-in a word, by public
opinion as it expresses itself in all these ways.
In the last analysis, this is the only safeguard
that we have against any dangerous tendency.

A HUNDRED MILLION-DOLLAR SAVINGS BANK

HE deposits in a single savings bank,

situated on the Bowery in New York, have
reached 100 million dollars. That is an event
not only in the life of the Bowery Savings Bank
but also in the life of the East Side of New
York. It is not a community in which one
looks for thrift: rather the contrary. Of course
the bank does not draw alone from the poorer
section of the city. Its deposits come from all
over New York and from outside as well. Still
it is a remarkable thing that a savings bank
located as this one is located should have be-
come the giant of the savings banks.

One hundred million dollars is a, huge sum
of money. In these days when the Wall Street
financiers have adopted a hundred millions as
the unit of large finance, one is apt to forget just
how big the sum is. The deposits in this one
bank are nearly three times as great as the
entire postal savings of Japan. If put into
railroad building, they would build more than
3,0co miles of road at an average of $ 33,000 per
mile-and that is more than most of the roads
in the West have cost. They would build a
fleet of fourteen first-class battleships and leave
a surplus. Ten years ago, the total net deposits
of all the national banks in Chicago barely
equaled the deposits in this one New York
savings bank to-day.

Two forces have brought about the result.
The first is the increasing thrift of the people.
Wages, of course, have been very high for the
last few years, and men have learned to save
because they had something to save. The
lesson of thrift has been a hard one for the

average American working man and woman to
learn. It comes more naturally to the German,
the Hebrew, and the Italian of the East Side
than to anyone born under the Stars and Stripes
--yet it has come to the native American, to
some extent at least. There are about 2OO, OOO
people who have deposits in this one bank.
Throughout the whole country, there are over
8,000,000 who have funds in the savings banks.
In one year, 1906, the number of depositors
increased nearly half a million.

The other force that has made this bank great
is the stringent state law of New York with
regard to savings banks. That law has made
them as nearly absolutely safe as it is possible
to make them. All investments are limited to
a certain kind of real estate loan, to certain
strong railroad bonds, and to certain specified
loans. Inspection is rigid and severe. The
savings bank is not a business institution so
much as it is a trust for the people. The men
who undertake it look for no sudden profits,
but seek their reward through slow growth and
stability. The result is that the people of the
United States have come to regard the savings
banks of New York and Massachusetts-where
similar laws are enforced-as the safest,
soundest, and most conservative financial
institutions in this country. It is a lesson the
other states may well take to heart.

A L.ESSON FROM MARS

HE astronomers this summer have another
chance to find out what they can about
life on Mars, while the planet is within the
nearest range of our telescopcs and cameras.
Whether the inhabitants of Mars have a system
of artificial canals or not, the theory that they
have has a great interest for men of imaginative
minds, as Professor Ray Lankester has pointed
out, for purely terrestrial reasons. These canals,
if the astronomers' guess be correct, imply the
peaceful cooperation of the population of the
whole planet. It is an irrigation-work on a
world-wide scale. The inhabitants must all
have not only peaceful relations but a definite
and active plan of cooperation with one another
from pole to pole. There must be social and
industrial helpfulness as well as peace. The
whole planet must be as one country. Social-
ism itself has never dreamed nor sketched a
more complete system of cooperation.
Now this is good to think about. If all the
nations on our globe were obliged to depend
for water and the fertility of the earth upon the
