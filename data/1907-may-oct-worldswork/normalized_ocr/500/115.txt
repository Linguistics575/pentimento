GOVERNOR HUGHES-mow AND LATER 8913

recount and that the law's delays were unduly
turned against him. He had his own Inde-
pendence League (a corporation) nominate
him for Governor; the Democratic state con-
vention, fearing that if it did not endorse
Mr. Hearst, its candidate would be third in
the race and it would lose its half of the election
machinery of the state, made Mr. Hearst its
candidate.

The Republican state administration had
been unsatisfactory. Both branches of the
legislature were Republican. The state Senate
had many members whose personal corruption
was believed by the general public. The
administration of the state departments, par-
ticularly of banking, insurance, and public
works, had been attended with public scandals.
Among the Republican state leaders there was
a bitter factional fight over the spoils. Gov-
ernor Higgins, who has since died, was in such
a state of health that he was unable to super-
vise the acts of his subordinates. Under
the custom of the party, the state officials
were all entitled to renominations. If this
course had been followed, the whole Re-
publican ticket would have gone to defeat
and Mr. Hearst would have been trium-
phantly elected.

This situation confronted the last Repub-
lican state convention. Governor Higgins de-
clined a renomination on account of his health.
He would have been defeated had he run. All
the minor state officials were clamoring for
a popular candidate at the head of the ticket.
The public sentiment for Mr. Hughes was
strong, but there was not a political leader
in favor of his nomination until Congressman
Herbert Parsons came from New York City
and said that he was going to put Mr. Hughes
in nomination and that the old political hacks
could do as they pleased. The convention
organized with the Governorship still un-
decided. Things were in this chaotic state
when Congressman Cocks, who represents
Nassau County where President Roosevelt
votes, appeared at Saratoga and told the
leaders that the President thought that Mr.
Hughes was the only man who could win. So
the convention unanimously selected Mr.
Hughes and renominated the minor state
officers.

How sound was this political judgment
election day proved: Mr. Hughes was elected
and everybody else on the Republican state
ticket was defeated. Mr. Hughes ran tens of

thousands of votes ahead of his ticket in the
Democratic parts of the state, particularly
New York and Brooklyn. During the cam-
paign he repeatedly appealed to Democrats
to vote for him. He pledged himself not to be
a Republican Governor or the Governor of any
party or of any faction but to be Governor of
all the people irrespective of politics. The
people believed him, although the Republican
politicians did not. They took his speeches
as campaign promises and regarded his pledges
as "good politics."

MR. HUGHES AS GOVERNOR

When Governor Hughes assumed office, the
first shock to the Republican state leaders was
his telling them personally and privately that
he proposed to keep the pledges he had made
to the people. He began with an inaugural
message in which he advocated a legislative
recount of the votes cast at the mayoralty
election in New York, on the ground that if
Mr. Hearst was elected he was entitled to the
office and that it was more important that
elections should be honestly conducted and
that the public should be satisfied that the
count was honest than that any individual
should or should not hold office. He favored
a reorganization of the state departments and
promised that he would investigate every one
of them. Greatest of all, he favored the state
regulation of all public-service corporations
and asked the legislature to pass a bill empower-
ing him to appoint a public-service commission
which would act on behalf of the people of the
state in all matters relating to the steam and
street railroads, water, gas, and electricity, in
order that an intelligent and comprehensive
policy might be pursued which would insure a
reasonable return to the corporations on their
investment and would reserve all other profits
from public franchises to the general public
in the shape of lower fares and better service.
There were other recommendations for the
preservation of the Mate forest preserve, for a
more efficient administration of the state depart-
ments, for the improvement of the Erie Canal,
and for better highways. All in all, the message
treated the affairs of the state as a business to
be conducted and administered for the sole
benefit of the people of the state.

Revolutionary as this message was, the
politicians were willing to let that pass and to
adopt whatever legislation might please the
Governor, if only the state patronage were
