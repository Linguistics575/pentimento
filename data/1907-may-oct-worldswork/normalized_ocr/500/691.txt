THE NEW SCIENCE OF BUSINESS
HOW TO FIND GOOD MEN IN YOUR OWN SHOP

BY

GEORGE F. STRATTON

R. CHARLES M. SCHWAB, when

I/f at the head of the Carnegie plants,

once remarked with breezy, jovial
vehemence:

"Good men! We make them here, the
same as we make good steel. There are no
better men in the world than hundreds of those
we have in our plants. We always know
where to find the man we want without going
outside."

The difference between this view of the head
of 50,000 men and that of the great majority
of industrial captains, who continually and
bitterly bemoan the shortage of good men, is
due chiefly to the fact that Mr. Carnegie him-
self was a wizard in the discovery of latent
ability among his own employees.

Mr. Carnegie always ascribed his success to
his men and, on one occasion, suggested that an
appropriate epitaph for himself would be:
"Here lies one who knew how to get around
him men who were cleverer than himself!"

This peculiar insistency on the value of men
was almost always reflected in his lieutenants.
Captain Jones, his noted superintendent, was
a, marvel of discernment and judgment in
making selections from even the yard laborers
--of whom Mr. Schwab was one. And, after
Mr. Schwab had risen to the highest position
in the Company, he always knew Tom, Dick,
and Harry at the machines. It was this
instinct, possessed by his lieutenants, in finding
"good men" among the army of employees
which has made the steel industry of America
the leader of the world in methods and costs.

A member of a firm of contractors recently
replied to the writer's query:

"I'm often in trouble to find the men I
want, but it's because I have [ 0 move about
so much that I am not able to look for them."

"But your foremen can always suggest good
men." I remarked.

He smiled. "Look here!" he exclaimed.
"Here's a factory building that's got to be

rushed. The foreman's a good man and loyal
to us, but, do you suppose that if I wanted to
select one or two of his assistants to put on
another job he'd pick out the best for me,
getting himself and this job balled up by so
doing? Not much! I've been a, foreman
myself and I know just how it is. His reputa-
tion depends upon the way this job is put
through, and he's going to hang, like grim
death, to every good man he's got, and I don't
blame him. But it doesn't help me any in my
search for good men for other jobs."

I have received one equally frank explana-
tion from an employee-a chief clerk in the
freight auditing department of a great railroad.
He had resigned some time before and was in
business for himself.

"There were more than forty clerks under
me," he said, "and of course some of them
were good-far too good to be doing routine
work. I don't believe you can get forty men
together, anywhere, without finding two or
three who are well qualified, in every respect,
for higher positions than those they are in.
Now who do you suppose was put in as my
successor?

"They brought in a man from the Michigan
Central! That's policy, you know. He knew
rates and ways on that line which our manager
wanted to know, so they secured him; and
they didn't look for any good man among my
forty. There's a lot of that sort of thing going
on, but that is not where the chief difficulty
lies. I was often asked by the head of the
department if I had any good man suitable for
transfer to some more important work. Now
that's where it hit me, and hit me hard. Every
month the expense of my department was
compared with the corresponding expense
of the year before, or the year before that.
Every month the percentage of expense against
the business done was figured. If I broke the

record, I received a little note urging me to
keep up the pace and improve it.
