THE MONEY-KINGS 9481

second Mor of a, little, white, unpretentious
office-building halfway between the graveyard
that bounds Wall Street on the west and the
deep dark river that skirts it on the east. There
sits Mr. James Stillman, the president of the
National City Bank, of New York. The office
is severely plain. In that, it echoes the New
England spirit of its master. Here are no
thousanfdollar rugs, nor tapestries, nor pic-
tures. Yet all this ostentatious poverty is an
affectation, no more, for the bank is the richest
bank and its directors are among the richest
men in the whole United States.

Mr. Stillman is a remarkable individual.
He is a man of middle stature, well-built, alert,
alive. Restless energy marks every move.
His clear, light-brown eyes look at and through
you as he talks. The look and the voice are
cold, icy-cold. Men say that deep down below
the ice there flows a river of sentiment, love of
children, appreciation of things beautiful, art,
music, the sea. It may be so, but one may
well find it hard to believe. Mr. James
Stillman of 52 Wall Street is a cold, hard, love-
less individual, however genial and delightful
may be Mr. James Stillman of the brown-stone
house in the Seventies.

He is the National City Bank, its brains, its
wonderful intuition, its very soul. He has
aspired to be the Rothschild of America, and
to found his bank in the old Custom-House, the
great stone-pillared pile into whose shadows his
eyes look as he glances from his windows across
the street, and make that the Bank of All the
Banks. Perhaps he will do it. For he is
young, and Morgan, Baker, Schiff-oh, well,
a man must drop the arms of power sometime!

THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF STILLMAN

James Stillman was born on June 9, 1850,
in Brownsville, Tex., just across the river from
Matamoras, Mexico. It was a wild and most
unlikely land. Away back in the early'30's
his father went down from New England to
Matamoras, seeking a fortune from the traffic
over the border in cotton, hides, and wool.
Then came the war with Mexico, and Browns-
ville sprung up amid the Chaparral. The
trader went back to New England, married
the choice of his youth, and brought her down
to live in the new town along the river.
There, in a little Mexican-built cottage within
sound of the river in flood, James Stillman
was born.

On the wings of the Civil War came Fortune.

The boy, well grown, was sent to Hartford,
Conn., to school. He has not since seen
Brownsville to this day. The family'moved
North, having strong Union sentiments, leaving
the Southern end of the business in the hands
of a rampant Southerner, Mr. Carson. Mr.
Stillman piled up a fortune, gigantic for those
days. By a stroke of rare judgment, he ig-
nored the Union blockade. The Matamoras
gateway stood wide open. Mr. Stillman, in
the North, and Mr. Carson, in the South,
opened a new trade route through Bagdad, a
Mexican port. The cotton blocked the roads
for miles behind the open door. Merchandise
from New York, consigned to Bagdad, slipped
into the South in a huge and steady flood.
So was laid the foundation of the Stillman
fortune of to-day.

A few years later, young Stillman turned to
the inheritance of his tradition, the cotton
business. Within a few years his frm was
doing the biggest cotton business in this country,
selling direct to the mills. For more than
twenty years he was the master of this trade.

Strange it is that the very stars in their
courses seem to fight for such a man as he. It
chanced that the older Stillman, not with any
great pride but more by chance, retained the
title to nearly all the land around about Browns-
ville. Six years ago, you or I might have gone
down and bought it for a few dollars an acre.
Then, again by chance, a group of St. Louis
capitalists went down and dug for water
in the Brownsville country, found it, then built
a railroad. To-day, that Brownsville land is
worth in the hands of Mr. James Stillman all
the way from $ 2 5 to $ 500 per acre.

Meantime, Mr. Stillman has made himself
the centre of the banking world. Years ago
he became the youngest director of the National
City Bank, a quiet, respectable institution.
He was elected because his father happened to
be a friend of Mr. Moses Taylor, who was, at
that time, the dominant influence in the bank.
Some fifteen years or so ago, a new president
was wanted. It was a man's hour on Wall
Street. The world was ripe for a fall. The
Baring panic, the crisis of 1893, the free-silver
collapse, lay just beyond the hill where man's
eyes could not see them. By chance, Mr.
Stillman took the presidency. The storm
broke. He showed himself the master mariner,
quiet, skilful, courageous, cold as an iceberg
in panic, intuitive as a woman in the hour of
action. And so he came to his inheritance.
