of railroads for new capital for improvement,
equipment, and development of the property,
and the country served, should be placed under
the supervision of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, with authority only to authorize
such increase of capital as the property needs
to fully take care of its requirements.

This is a question that will require careful
consideration and the Commissioners should
be allowed sufficient latitude for them to use
some discretion as conditions may warrant.

4. Uniform System of Accounts

I believe that there should be uniformity in
accounts, and I am glad to see the efforts now
being made in that direction by the Govern-
ment. When the end is accomplished and the
plan is in working order, the investor will
know that the reports of the different com-
panies are a correct guide to the value of their
securities. In other words, the annual r√©ports
of the railroads will be a proper and legiti-
mate basis for public confidence, as they
should be.

s. Publicity

There should be no mystery in the railroad
business. I think that our accounts should
be subject to inspection by the Government,
as openly and as freely as the accounts of a
national bank are now subject to the inspec-
tion of the examiners; but all information
pertaining to the railroads' business should
be protected against improper use. Such
publicity will be found the ultimate safe-
guard of the laws looking toward fair rates
and equitable dealings, and will, at the same
time, afford to the investor another proper
test of value for the securities he buys or owns.

6. Legalized T rafic Association

I do not believe that railroad pools should be
legalized, but I do believe that traffic associa-
tions between railroads should be allowed.
Suppose, for instance, that two railroads can
reach all the lumber traffic of the states of
Texas and Washington. They might form
a pool with certain connecting lines northward
and eastward, whereby those connecting lines
should receive all this lumber for transporta-
tion beyond the northern and eastern termini
of the two lines. A pool is a closed association.
A traffic association, on the other hand, is open,
and all the connecting lines are allowed to
participate. The Federal Government, by

THE PEOPLE, THE RAILROADS, AND THE GOVERNMENT

endorsing a pool, would give an advantage to
a few of the stronger lines to the detriment of
others not parties to the pool. By legalizing
the traffic association, however, the Govern-.
ment would be legislating for the whole, rather
than for the part. This is the true function
of Government.

When the Government shall have established
its interstate traffic agents at the different
commercial centres of the country, the Fed-
eral traffic representative should attend the
meetings of the railroad traffic associations,
where all matters pertaining to the movement
of traffic, rules, rates, and regulations governing
same, could be discussed between the officers
of the roads and the representative of the
Government.

7. A Reasonable Time for Delivery

The railroads should fix a reasonable time
in which the freight is to be delivered to the
consignees. The limit should be abundantly
reasonable, because the nature of the freight
business, over which the railroads cannot always
control, demands a great deal of liberality in
its movement, but I believe some of the time
now consumed in such delivery should be and
could be saved, to the profit of both the con-
signees and the railroads. Such a regulation
could be worked out that would be of mutual
interest to the railroads and the shippers.

8. Relation of State and Federal Power

_ Where the state regulation of rates, or state
legislation on other railroad subjects, directly
affects interstate transportation, the Federal
authority should rule. For instance, let us
assume that the rate from Denver to St. Louis
is $ 1.50, made up of $ 1 from Denver to the
Missouri River and 50 cents local from the
Missouri River to St. Louis. If Missouri
should reduce the local rate in Missouri to 30
cents, it would make the interstate rate $ 1.30,
which means, in effect, that the rate on com-
merce between states has been fixed by the
State Commissioners instead of the Federal
Commissioners. This is only one of the num-
erous cases and is the same as is taking place in
all the states and territories where state legisla-
tion, by reducing state rates, is establishing the
rate on the interstate commerce; while our
National Commissioners at Washington, al-
though authorized by specific Act of Congress,
charged with the duty, and the only body
authorized by law to make such regulations,
