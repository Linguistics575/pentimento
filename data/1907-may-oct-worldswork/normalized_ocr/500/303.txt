CASINO AT MAR DE LA PLATA, AN ARGENTINE SUMMER- th'OR'l

The people of the Argentine are luxurious in their tastes, and demand a beauty and a style in their
public facilities that is seldom surpassed on the North American Continent

since the Japanese occupation. According to
the geography that I studied in my school days,
the population of the island was about evenly
divided between head-hunters and pirates, and
it was only the exceptionally lucky or agile that
ever arrived at years of discretion. Murder
and sudden death were not accidents but
incidents. They were the ordinary lot of sin-
ful man in that forsaken country. To-day,
there are more than 5,000 citizens who have
money in the savings banks! Several hundred
miles of railroad connect the various towns;
the telegraph and telephone have taken the
place of the signal fires on the hills.

Instead of heathen pirate revels, there are

r. l

over a hundred and fifty schools all over the
country, conducted by the Government, and
everybody goes to school. Some of the pupils,
it is true, were once head-hunters, and others
were pirates. But the bottom dropped out of
the head-hunting business, and piracy became
unconventional. They turned their minds to
books and their hands to the writing of bills of
lading. In 1896, the foreign trade was just
beginning-it totaled 0nly $ 1,313,000. To-day
it is close to $ hS, ooo, ooo---and still growing.
In 1890, 681 inhabitants were killed by raiding
savages from the deep forests. To-day the raids
are practically over, and the raiders have either
paid with their lives or gone to school.

THE DUCKS OF BUENOS AIRES

The shipping facilities created in recent years for the great Argentine port are probably as modern and complete as
those of any harbor in the world
