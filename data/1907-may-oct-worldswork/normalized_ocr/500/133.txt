CELEBRATING THE THREE-HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SETTLEMENT OF VIRGINIA

HE Jamestown Exposition is a beautiful
sight; and its location as well as its
character distinguishes it from all pre-

ceding expositions. It is mainly historical,
and its programme is a continuous marine and
military pageant. Three hundred years ago,
the pioneers aboard the Godspeed, the Susan
Constant, and the Discovery landed at what
is now Old Point Comfort, after having been

r"

driven by the Indians away from Cape Henry.
Sewell's Point, on Hampton Roads opposite
Old Point Comfort, was therefore selected as
a suitable location for the Exposition. The
area comprises about Soo acres of land and
enough of Hampton Roads to float the navies
of the world, without crowding the merchant
craft.

From the grounds can be seen Fortress
