without violating every principle of conserva-
tive investment. She was told that fact in
plain English. The safest course seemed
to be to put the money in a bank where it
would draw interest, and use it to give the boy
an education that would fit him to earn a good
living for both at the end of five years-when
he would be eighteen. This could be done
without using more than half the $ 4,000 that
was left of the capital. The plan did not
appeal to the woman. She was determined
that the money should all be invested, "even
if I run a great risk of losing it all."

Flatly against the advice of the writer, this
was done. Since it was determined that it
should be done, she was advised to sell her
common stock of the Steel Corporation. The
proceeds, together with part of the money in
the bank, were put into the preferred stock of
the same company. Sixty shares of this
stock cost, with commissions, $ 3,960, and they
paid dividends of $ 420 per annum. The
investor wen.'. back to New Jersey and settled
down to live on her income, still hoping for
the best..

Everyone knows how the tide turned. The
divulends have been paid steadily on that
stock ever since, and at one time the invest-
ment was worth over $ 6,750. Last October,
the writer advised the investor to sell it, and
put the money into bonds that wculd give
her the same revenue; but this she will
not do. She believes that in the long run
it will give her back her $ 10,000 of capital.
Perhaps it will; and perhaps it will not.
One never can tell what an industrial stock
will do.

The strange part of this episode is that if
the woman had been advised to hold her com-
mon stock, and spend the money in the bank
foi living expenses for two years, the advance
in the common stock would have given her
back her $ 1o, ooo in the autumn of 1906, when
it resumed dividends at the rate of $ 500 per
year on the shares she owned. On the other
hand, the more safe and conservative the
advice she followed, the smaller would be her
revenue to-day and the smaller her capital.
That merely means that the year 1904 was a
period in which it paid to be willing to take
risks, because all stocks bought in that year
advanced rapidly in 1905 and 1906.

This story is told at some length because it
illustrates the extreme difficulty of making
investments for such investors. To advise

HOW TO INVEST SMALL FUNDS

safely such an investor, the adviser must
have the following data:

(r) How much capital have you to invest?

(2) How much revenue do you need to live
upon?

(3) Are you willing to give up chances of
large profits in order to obtain safety?

(4) Should your investment be free of taxes
or not? If it must be free, in what state are
you taxed?

(s) Must your investment be of such a
nature that it may be turned into cash at any
moment?

On the basis of these facts, the banker or
the private adviser may select for a man or a
woman the proper kind of an investment.
Without these facts, it is practically impossible
for anyone to judge intelligently whether a
particular investment is suitable for a particular
investor.

Every investor should come to realize that
stocks and bonds are not intrinsically equal.
When the investor has realized that a stock
that is perfectly suitable as an Investment for
his landlord, his employer, or any other cap-
italist, may be full of menace for him, and that
a bond which may be perfectly suited to him
may be entirely unsuited to the investment of
his capitalist frien", then he has learned the
first principle of safe investment. Until he
does learn this cardinal fact, he will grope in
the dark. In fact, he may stumble over
something that will give him a fall severe enough
to take him entirely out of the investment class.

To make this clear, THE WORLD'S WORK

'intends to tal" up this subject in full. In

subsequent articles, it will discuss the meaning
and the bearing of each of the five questions
which furnish the basis of conservative invest-
ment. In the meantime, day by day, the
Readers' Service is compelled to attempt
advice to investors who almost without excep-
tion fail to give enough data upon which to form
a really intelligent opinion. In a great many
cases, it is necessary to write to the questioner,
asking for further information about the class
of investment. Sometimes the letter-head fur-
nishes more assistance to the man who answers
the questions than the letter itself. Frequently,
the mourning stationery and the sex of the
writer afford the clue. Far too often, doubt-
less, the answer is not as good as it should
be, because the Readers' Service has guessed
wrongly as to the CQnditions that surround the
inquiry.
