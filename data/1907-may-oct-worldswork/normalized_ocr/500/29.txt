SAN FRANCISCO'S MORAL BREAKDOWN

the existence of abuses whose correction in
other states is left to the statutes.

The provisions for the exclusion of trusts
and monopolies and for the regulation of
railroads are cspccially severe. Any railroad
that shall desire to exercise the right of eminent
domain in Oklahoma must be chartered under
the laws of the state. These laws, the framers
expect, will be sufficient to prevent any injustice
in the exercise of the right. Railroads shall be
prohibited from owning coal lands, and all
railroads shall be under the supervision of an
elective state railroad commission. No pas-
senger fare of more than two cents a mile
shall be charged. This, mind you, is a part of
the constitution.

Other advanced political theories are em-
bodied in the instrument. One of thescy's a
clause for prohibition that prohibits not only
the sale of the liquor but its importation into
the state. The constitution provides that the
Indian Territory shall have prohibition for
twenty-one years, but a separate section pro-
vides for prohibition for the whole state. This
section will be yoted upon separately from the
constitution, and requires only a majority for
passage. The principle of the initiative and
referendum is adopted. Elective officers are
forbidden to succeed themselves-this being
an attempt to prevent "ring" leadership in
politics.

But the greatest distinction of the new consti-
tution is its elaborate regulation of corporations.
Another distinction is its length: it is by far
the longest of state constitutions. A third
distinction is, that this is probably the first
state constitution drafted by a convention in
which an Indian tribe had a legal vote and a
considerable influence. The Osage Nation
had two votes of the total of 112, and Indian
influence is, quaintly enough, mainly respons-
ible for the prohibition clauses in the new
constitution. The new state is, of course,
overwhelmingly Democratic.

SAN FRANCISCO'S MORAL BREAKDOWN

HE people of San Francisco have suffered
overmuch. But the earthquake and
the fire are not the greatest of their calamities.
Their worst misfortune became public a year
later in amazing revelations of the sordid greed
that seemed to permeate almost every class of
men after the ruin of April, r906.
A venal city government, the tool of a corrupt
and corrupting citv boss, sold the public

privileges of the city for ridiculous prices upon
payment to the supervisors of graft fees ranging
from $ 500 to $ 15,000 a vote. The street rail-
way company bought the privilege of running
an overhead trolley line from "Abc" Ruef,
the chief grafter, instead of buying it from the
city for what it was worth. The telephone
monopoly intrenched itself by similar means.
Citizens otherwise reputable chased smaller
private ends through the same paths of graft.
In all, something more than a million dollars
seem to have been collected into Ruef's corrup-
tion fund, and much of it stuck to his fingers.
Enough passed on, however, to purchase the
desired favors from the city powers.

San F rancisco was used to the kind of graft
disclosed in the earlier part of the investigation.
The purchase of immunity by vice had been
known for years, and was common to many
cities. But the graft in high places, the spread
of the taint to tt good people" and the enormous
bulk of the corrupting influences raise San
Francisco to a solitary eminence of shame.

There is an explanation of this moral break-
down at the very point that should have been
the last to weaken. For two generations the
city had boasted of its license, of its "wide-
openness," of its Parisian flavor. It had taken
a silly pride in being "different," regardless
of the moral quality of the difference. This
boast and this pride have been the weak vice
of even the so-called "better Classes" in San
F raneisco. Now the city is reaping the harvest -
of that moral let-down in a whirlwind of
corruption.

The fact that the graft has been accepted
by labor politicians is not especially significant.
The significant fact is that the graft was offered
by men of every political complexion and espe-
cially by some of those highest in the city's
business life. In brief, the city was full of
rottenness, and needed only this supreme oppor-
tunity to make the disgraceful disclosure of it.

But, after all, is it San Francisco only? The
disorganization and confusion of the city, the
unparalleled property loss, entailing a complcte
readjustment of the ownership and value of
property rights, made of the opportunity to
graft the most enormous temptation of its kind
in our time. That the temptation found such
willing victims is deplorable. But the mood
of other cities that would criticize San Francisr ty
should be a mood of self-searching, to make
sure that they are not more righteous only
because their temptation is less.
