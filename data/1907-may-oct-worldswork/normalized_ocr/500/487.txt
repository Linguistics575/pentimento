tion of the body as a thing of little account or of
worse than no value, a thing to be punished and
suppressed! But the sweeping and pleasing
thought that a higher civilization lies in the
direction that we are now going is warranted;
and its attainment will not be long postponed
if well-balanced physical training and healthful
living become general enough. The "physical
conscience" and "the sense of health" are
among the most important senses of mankind.

A SCULPTOR OF ENDURING FAME

Y THE death of Augustus Saint Gaudens,
on August 3rd, the country lost not
only its most distinguished sculptor but one
whose influence had a very real effect upon the
growth of artistic taste in public and private
life. For while in his own art he was the first
to represent the value of the modern system
of Parisian training, he also was the intimate
of architects and painters who, returning from
the schools of Paris thirty years ago, established
new standards of taste and technical pro-
ficiency. Their example has been followed by
thousands, until now throughout the country
there are evidences of the improved conditions
in monumental and domestic buildings, and
in their external and interior embellishments.

Before the entrance of Saint Gaudens into
public recognition, on the occasion of the un-
veiling of his "Farragut" in 1881, the trend of
American students of sculpture had been
toward Rome and imitation of the antique
had served them as a motive. But Saint
Gaudens went to Paris, and in the studio of
Jouffrey came under the modern system of
teaching that was based upon the study of life.
It was a rigorous discipline for eye and hand,
but he had already proved his capacity for hard
work by the practice for six years of the craft
of cameo-cutting, attending meanwhile the
evening classes at the Cooper Union and
National Academy. His course at Jouffrey's
completed, he spent three years in Italy, being
especially attracted by the works of Donatello
and the early Florentine. Their simple and
sincere rendering of nature corresponded with
the teachings of Jouffrey and with the prompt-
ings of his own temperament.

As soon as his "Farragut" appeared, it was
recognized that its unqualified naturalness and
the atmosphere of character with which it was
invested set a new and a higher standard. He
has since given the country a series of memo-
rial statues-Lincoln, Sherman, Peter Cooper,

9285

Shaw, and others; for their extraordinary
fidelity of portraiture and their exalted sug-
gestion, these challenge rivalry with the finest
European sculpture of the nineteenth century.

For Saint Gaudens had to a rare degree the
essentially artistic faculty of what has been
called the "plastic mind." He felt and thought
in terms of form, and his intelligence and
imagination alike expressed themselves natur-
ally and completely in modeled surfaces. He
needed no accessories to make his meaning
clear to others as to himself; for his com-
prehension of a subject was purely and ex-
clusively artistic, without the slightest strain
of literary or anecdotal tendency. His busi-
ness was to model a figure and in the modeling
itself to express the sentiment with which the
original impressed him. The measure of his
distinction consisted less in the excellence of
technique, for this he shared with other sculp-
tors, than in his wonderful capacity of seeing
the significance in form and of interpreting it
purely through form. It was this which gave
to every thing to which he set his hand both a
tangible and an elusive dignity. A supreme
example is his "Lincoln." Compared with
it, almost all other representations seem com-
monplace, while none approaches its impres-
siveness. And a similar genius for including
the spiritual personality in the physical is the
distinctive characteristic of all his works. A
review of these appeared in THE WORLD'S
WORK, February, 1904; since that date a statue
of Charles Stewart Parnell, has been unveiled
in Dublin. Practically his last finished work
was the designing of the new gold coins soon
to be issued by the Government.

THE DIRECTIONS OF COLLEGE GROWTH

EVERAL changes, distinct enough to be
noted, are taking place in the growth of

our colleges and universities. First of all, a
number of them have increased in attendance
during the last five years as much as 20 per
ccnt.-a very remarkable fact. In 1903, only
three-Harvard, Columbia, and Chicago---
had an attendance of more than 4,000 students.
To-day Cornell and the Universities of Michi-
gan and Minnesota fall into the same category.
T hese six largest universities of the country are
distributed equally over the East and the West.
The phenomenal growth of the prominent
Western institutions has not been, as is some-
times supposed, at the expense of their older
Eastern rivals. The percentage of students
