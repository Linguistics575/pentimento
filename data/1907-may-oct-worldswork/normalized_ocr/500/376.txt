instead of with the wings of a bird. The fish
has a swimming bladder which he can expand
and contract at will and thus rise or descend
in the dense medium in which he lives. This
swimming bladder corresponds to the gas bag
of the dirigible balloon, but the fish has the
advantage of being able at any time to draw
from an inexhaustible supply of air to distend
his bladder. Furthermore, he lives in a stable
and storm-free medium unlike our atmosphere.
There is a likeness to the fish also in the pro-
pellers which have been used on air-ships.
They have followed very closely the idea of the
tail of a fish or the screw of a steamer. They
have been pitched too high for work in the air.
On account of friction, no motor of to-day
could turn them fast enough to compare with
the beats of an insect's wings or with the whirr
of the wild duck as it flies. The propellers of
an air-ship should make at least 12,000 or
14,000 revolutions a minute and be arranged
so as to lift the machine as well as propel it.

The experimenters who have put their trust
in aeroplanes have approached the problem
more nearly after the theoretically proper
plan, since these machines are built upon the
principle used by birds in soaring. The mir.
take probably is to hope by the aeroplane to
solve the whole problem of flight, for a bird
soars or glides on its wings only for the purpose
of resting or conserving its power after having
gained a height by hard muscular work.

Yet one must admire the patience, the in-
dustry, and the daring of the ever-increasing
number of experimenters in this field. Many
of them impoverish themselves, and the pity of
it is that the same experimental work is done
by anumber of men-the duplication of costly
effort that comes of a lack of co6peration.

It would be a great gain if some institution
or some man of fortune were to construct a
great aeronautical experiment shop, well-enough
equipped to permit work in every department
of this wide field. There should be a labora-
tory, a testing plant and a large machine shop
-all for serious work. The discoveries and
tests made there should be given to the world
without the restrictive influence of patent rights.
To stimulate the inventive faculties of the
workers perhaps prizes might be given for all
inventions that help toward the construction
of a successful air-ship, a ship that shall make
its way through storms and not be dependent
upon ilu/bulky gas bag with its combustible
contents.

MARCH OF EVENTS

THE RIDICULED AND ENDURING HOUSE
OF LORDS

HE Liberal English Government is-as

is inevitable and usual-wrath at the
obstructive House of Lords, which is always
the stronghold of the Tories. Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman recently put through the
Commons this resolution-

"That in order to give effect to the will of the people,
as expressed by their elect: d representatives, it is necessary
that the power of the ot .er house to alter or reject bills
passed by this house shr old be so restricted by law as to
secure that, within the limits of a single Parliament, the
final decision of the House of Commons shall prevail."

This has no more meaning than a formal
protest; but it has again called up for discussion
the unbusiness-like qualities of the hereditary
House, many of whose members are always
absent, whose perfunctory sessions of a half-
hour are often the exasperation of practical
statesmen, and whose stubborn opposition to
many liberal measures arouses the unavailing
wrath of the Radicals. It has been said by
an astute public man that if any American who
dares criticise our Senate were compelled to
study the House of Lords, he would praise
Heaven that we are no worse off than we are.

These recurrent outbursts of unavailing criti-
cism recall a saying of the Saturday Review a
generation ago. This abject organ declared:

"As a matter of fact, no man 1iving, or who ever lived-.
not Caesar or Pericles, not Shakespeare or Michael Angelo-
can confer honor more than he took on entering the House
of Lords."

It was this that provoked three of Swinburne's
mocking sonnets beginning:

tt O Lords our Gods, beneficent, sublime,
In the evening and before the morning flames,
We praise, we bless, we magnify your names."

and ending:

"Our time, with Heaven and with itself at odds,
Makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil;
But yours are yet the corn and wine and oil,

And yours our worship yet, o Lords our Gods."

But the Bishops and the favored brewers and
the inheritors of old titles still hold the worship
of the "crowned republic" and hold their power
and will hold it so long as the English continue
dearly to love a lord. For the House of Lords
has become, as royalty has in a much greater
measure, a stronger social than political
institution.
