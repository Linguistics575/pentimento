for visits and office consultation were twice as
much.

These figures are offered by way of protest
against careless statements-growing out of
exceptional experiences-lat reflect on the
medical profession at large, a profession that
does more practical relief work, without credit,
than any other class of men. For the figures
seem to show that---

(r) A very few physicians of preiiminence
have large incomes, but smaller than men
preeminent in other lines.

(2) Something like 20 per cent. of the physi-
cians in the larger cities have handsome in-
comes, in return for expert work and much of it.

(3) Eighty per cent. of city physicians and
most of the country doctors make little more
than a decent living-many not even that.

(4) The average of fees charged in city and
in country is no larger than it was twenty-five
years ago.

(5) The code of medical ethics (established
by physicians themselves) is such that no
class of the American people need suffer for

edical attention because of inability to pay.

Is the doctor a Shylock?

ARMY LIFE AND DISCIPLINE

FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A COMMANDING OFFICER

BY

FREDERICK FUNSTON

BRIGADIER-GENERAL UNITED STATES ARMY

[ A criticism of an article in the A pril number of the WORLD'S WORK, entitled "The Trouble with the Army, from the

'standpoint of the Enlisted Man." ]

a brief review of the article in question.

While I agree with the writer in some
particulars, I am of the opinion that he is
in error in others. Although he does not
specifically say so, I should judge that Mr.
Forbes's experience and observations were
limited to service with one of the hastily thrown
together volunteer regiments raised for the
Spanish War. The conditions that existed
in many of those regiments were chaotic.
Many of the officers knew only the rudiments
of their business, and the handling of the ration
was atrocious, the food being poorly cooked
and served in any old manner.

These conditions are inseparable from a
dependence on hastily raised volunteers in
time of war. If the army that we collected in
1898 had been soundly whipped, as it would
have been if it had gone up against the troops
of a first-class military nation, a valuable les-
son might have percolated itself into the minds
of the American people-and as promptly
oozed out again, for the teachings of Bladens-
burg and Bull Run had been forgotten by 1898.

IN RESPONSE to your request, I write

As a former volunteer officer, I feel that I
may speak with perfect frankness on this sub-
ject; and I_do not cherish any delusions to the
effect that several hundred thousand rides
placed in the hands of an equal number of
patriotic and brave but untrained men con-
stitute an army. So that if Mr. Forbes's ob-
servations are based merely on service with the
force raised in 1898, he is apt to err. Some
of the conditions he refers to, especially poor
rations, do not apply to the regular army to-day;
and it is desertions from this force and an un-
willingness of men to retinlist in it that form
his text. His strictures on the ill-fitting, sloppy
uniform were well founded but are no longer
apt, as the olive-drab service uniform now
being issued is a vast improvement over its
predecessor. All that a man wearing it has
to do to look well is to keep it clean, keep his
blouse buttoned, and carry himself properly.
The issue of this uniform was greatly delayed
by the large number of old blue uniforms
accumulated during the Spanish War, which
had to be utilized as a matter of economy.
