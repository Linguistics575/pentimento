THE FUUNDER UF MOUND BAYOU

Isaiah T. Montgomery, who was once a slave belonging to the
brother of Jefferson Davis

but their good will and their forethought have
made the success of Mound Bayou possible.
As the colony grows older and the life of the

A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES

community becomes more complicated, new

problems present themselves to the men
who are still planning and directing its
future.

The success of the present community has
suggested the formation of others similar to
this one. Already there are the beginnings of
such communities at other points above and
below Mound Bayou. Mr. Montgomery be-
lieves that the success of these new communi-
ties, as well as the future of the Mound Bayou
colony, depends largely upon the ability of the
new generation, now growing up, to profit by
the experience of the older. It is with this
idea that he and his associates are even now
studying out a scheme by which the work of
the schools can be brought into closer touch
with the actual work of the colony.

"What we need," said Mr. Montgomery,
"is an agricultural school, something that
will teach the young men to be better farmers
than their fathers have been. But, more than
that, we need here a system of education that
will teach our young men and women the
underlying meaning of the work that is being
done here. In some way they must be taught
the importance of carrying forward this experi-
ment in the spirit in which it was begun.

.The problem of education is at present the

most important which the town and the colony
of Mound Bayou have to solve."
