9340 JAPAN'S WAR TAX AND POVERTY

One day, while roaming sorrowfully in the
desolate wilderness of low, flat houses, Taki
met his old Colonel, who received him
kindly and gave him one yen. With this the
veteran purchased a stock of salt mackerel,
dried cuttle, salmon trout and codfish on skewers
and started out as an itinerant merchant in the
country. He found the farmers and villagers
so poor that they could not afford to pay T okyo
prices for his delicacies and he was compelled
to sell at a loss. He trudged along manfully,
however, hoping that luck would change. He
washed his coarse blue kimono in the way-
side streams. He was still a self-respecting
Japanese.

On the road and in the hamlets of Chichibu
and Omiya he met homeless veterans and
beggars of all sorts. It seemed to him that
Japan had become the saddest country on
earth. At Ikao he sold the last of his stock
and found that he had but ten cents left. He
determined to return to Tokyo. There was a
stroke of good luck on the way. Ten miles
from the city a farmer hired him to draw a load
of vegetables to the market. The clumsy cart
carried fully 700 pounds, but Taki tugged it to
its destination and received eight cents for his
labor. This was a large sum, as eight cents in
the market had a buying power of 13 cucumbers
' or 20 egg-plants. It meant a temporary supply
of food.

AS A COLLECTOR OF GARBAGE

Back in Tokyo, Taki gave a grafting employ-
ment agency his last sen and secured employ-
ment in a rice shop which sold the leavings of
large restaurants and public institutions. His
wages were five cents a day and all the spoiled
rice he could eat. It was a repulsive business.
The dilapidated shop boasted a little yard and
in this were stretched old mats upon which the
rice was dried. Inside, bottles, casks, broken
boxes, tubs, and kettles were filled with refuse
rice. Everything was very dirty, and yet to the
neighborhood it was a mainstay for food cheap
enough to be within reach. Twice a clay Taki
and the other assistants made a round of the
restaurants and public institutions, such as the
hospitals and the Military College, and bought
the rice and the bits of food that had been left
over. They also picked bits of fish and decayed
fruit from the garbage receptacles. A tub of
rice weighing 125 pounds could be bought in
this way for 50 cents. It was retailed to the
poor at the shop for one cent a pound. The

rice, the fragments of bread and fish, the spoiled
fruit, the stale pickles and the like were care-
fully sorted.

A Japanese is dirty only when he cannot help
himself, and Taki shuddered at the filth of this
garbage gathered like precious metal and
weighed out to the last ounce by the stewards of
the restaurants and the ofhcials of the public
buildings. Poverty made him and his fellows
live in dirt and eat dirt; it was not to be
escaped. He learned to speak the slang of the
second-hand food dealers. Rice scorched in
the kettle was termed "tiger's skin," while
rice washed out in cleaning was known as
"slop"; fragments of bread he called "stove"
in jocular allusion to the warmth they did not
give the stomach; and bits of vegetables were
sold as "stumps." Taki soon became a con.
noisseur in the various forms of edible swill.

Of course, there were doleful days occasion,
ally when the patrons of the cafes, and the
students in the colleges, and the hospital
patients cleaned up their plates and there
was little refuse to gather. On such days the
throng at the shop which awaited the return of
the laden carts made a lugubrious assemblage.
When there was not enough to go around, the
repulsive mess was divided up so as to enable
each patron to buy a fractional meal.

Taki worked here for several months, but all
the time the combination to control the second-
hand food supply was being perfected, and when
it finally took over the various collecting carts
and routes the veteran found that he was not
wanted, owing to new economies in gathering
the garbage in central stations.

WORKING AS A DAY LABORER

Taki began once more a weary round of
labor seeking. He even joined the homeless
coolies who make their headquarters on Reigan-
jima, an island in Tokyo, formed by the River
Sumida. Here the poorest class of coolies
resort, bearing a pad on their shoulders and
wearing a single coarse garment. Not having
employment by the day, they seek piece-work
and odd jobs. They haunt the lumber yards
and the vegetable markets. They pull heavy
carts great distances for a cent and a half.
After a day of killing toil scattered over half
the sections of the city, they regard a total carn-
ing of ten cents as a great harvest. Then they
begin to think of the sake shops and a hilarious
evening. A dish of cooked food can be had for
a half-cent and this washed down with sake
