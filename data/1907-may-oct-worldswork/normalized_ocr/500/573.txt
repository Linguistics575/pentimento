AMATEUR HAND CRAFTS THAT PAY

sounds attractive, indeed fairly feasible; but
would it not be a lonesome occupation if I
devoted all my time to it?" Not necessarily.
Craftsmen can get together in groups; in fact,
it is advisable that they should. Within a
few miles from the study where this article is
written, there are two such colonies, and very
jolly they are. But we are not discussing
your making a profession of artistic handiwork
just now. Nobody would advise your con-
sidering that off-hand. You must first prove
your fitness, taking up the work as a pastime-
the sort of pastime that can be made, provided
you are good at it, to pay for itself. The dash
for liberty will come later, much later, if at all.

Suppose, now, that you are convinced that
you possess ability and would like to teach your
hands to amuse your leisure while augment-
ing your income: how shall you make a be-
ginning? First by telling yourself that mere
dabbling will not do. With a whole army of
trained workmen already in the field, there is
no room for "putterers." You must master
your trade, not "fool" with it. The "how-to"
books will give you rudimentary instruction,
teachers will elaborate it, and practice will
show you how best to apply it. Then will
come your most serious problem-the problem
of designing. Mere slavish copying brings
little pay and less fun; you must learn to
express your own individual ideas and to do
so without violence to law and form. The
principles of designing are known, and you
must learn them-sufficiently, at least, to
adapt other people's designs to your own pur-
poses. Ten years ago-even five years ago---
out-and-out crankiness was thought artistic,
but the folly of all that has begun to declare
itself. So has the folly of much that has been
written by sentimentalists about "sympathy,"
"atmosphere," and tt the right feeling." To the
Greeks foolishness and to the plain man tt guff,"
it is going its way. To-day there is a strong
reaction toward the reasonable designs that
depend upon sheer beauty and grace and
elegance for their charm and not upon wild
whimsicality. So also as regards execution.
When the movement was new, it sought to
show by all tokens that its products were hand-
made. That is why it loved lop-sided ovals
and deformed squares, while detesting the per-
fect forms that suggested the product of the
machine. Thus it imagined that it was catch-
ing the spirit of the old-time artisans, whose
work so often lacked geometrical precision.

ll knows better now. It realizes that when
those antique workmen set out to make a,
thing round they made it as round as they
could, and that when they set out to make
a thing square, they made it as square as they
could. Slight inaccuracies resulted, but were
never aimed at. They were as little prized as
foolishness and crankiness of design.

But, once you have mastered the theory and
practice of your craft, how are you to get your
goods to market? Quite easily. You may
join a Society of Arts and Crafts, send them
your work, let them pass judgment upon it,
and, if they think it worthy a place in their
shop, let them sell it for you.

Aside from the sale of your handiwork, you
will find still another source of revenue. You
can teach. Instruction in all sorts of handi-
crafts is at present in keen demand. People
are even devoting their entire time to it, here
and there, though the better way, from the
practical standpoint, is to teach part of the
while and make beautiful things yourself the
rest of the while. Otherwise you get curiously
theoretical and lose the very qualities that
would fit you to develop the talent of your
pupils.

Granted, now, that the handicraft movement
has outgrown-or is rapidly outgrowing-its
early eccentricities and weaknesses; granted
that is is already a sound business proposition,
inviting recruits wherever people want a
pleasant and restful way of turning their
leisure to remunerative account; granted also
that talent plus training and industry can there-
by win a livelihood-what, one can hardly
fail to ask, is the future of the movement?
Is it more than a passing enthusiasm? Can
you be sure, if you enter its army of workers,
that you will find a market for your wares ten
or twenty years hence?

Reasonable questions, these. Nobody in
his senses will think of espousing the cause of
any form of art purely for sake of gain. People
who do so come to grief. William Morris
spoke as a practical man when he said, "Art
is the expression of a man's joy in his work."
But everybody has a right to ask whether
there is not a chance that he is going to spend
a lot of labor and a certain amount of money
learning a profession or adopting an avoeation
that will go out of date after a while and leave
him stranded. What if the gold should wear
off, eventually, and baked clay begin to show
through?
