A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES 9029

They will recall yellow-fever epidemics, for-
getting that yellow fever has now no more
terrors for the South than smallpox has for the
North. They think of bad water. Yet Jackson-
ville, Fla., for instance, has its water-works
in the very heart of the city, where the supply
comes from artesian wells, and its death-rate
(of the whites) is among the lowest of the
cities of the United States. The same freedom
from disease is found in Savannah, and, indeed,
in most of the coast cities.

So, too, of the people as well as of places:
While men elsewhere have been talking and
writing of "crackers" and "poor white trash,"
the sons of the people that they have been
writing about have built fine residences on the
"swell" streets of every Southern city. They
are manufacturers and bankers and the leaders
of great enterprises; or they are the owners of
cotton farms, or of cabbage farms or of lettuce
farms, or of lumber mills, and of everything
else that denotes prosperity. The sons of some
of the men who were rich generations ago
are also, of course, doing similar tasks. The
point is that the Southern man or the Southern
land of the old books and of the romances is
now not representative and is, in fact, often
hard to find.

"Iam tired of the incredulity of men," saida
long-time resident of Florida-a man who went
there from Iowa many years ago. tt When I go to
see my own kinspeople, they expect me to talk
about alligators and chills and fevers. I never
see an alligator except the little ones that are
caught for tourists, and I have never had chills
and fevers nor any other illness since I left
Iowa. I have an artesian well and my home
is drained-as many homes in Iowa are not.
Chicago has more sunstrokes in one summer,
I venture to say, than Florida has had since the
white man first came here. And there are
better roads about this town and more auto-
mobiles than in any town of the same size in
Iowa."

Sanitation and intensive culture of the soil
and the general organization of industry by
modern methods have, of course, brought
changes so rapidly in the seaboard South---
in those communities where there has been a
modern organization-that the changes are
well-nigh incredible. And they run through
the whole range of life-from every-day work
to the warp and woof of men's thought and
character.

A countryman who wore home-made clothes

and lived meanly used to go from one of the
lower counties of Georgia to the legislature
at Atlanta. He was a clodhopper. Last win-
ter, when an agricultural school was to be built
in his county and subscriptions were asked for
it, this man gave his check for $ 1,000. One
of the higher State officers, who had known
him in Atlanta during his legislative days,
asked the local banker if that old fellow's
check were good for $ 1,000. "Good for
$ 50,000," was the answer. "How did he do
it?" "Lumber and long-staple cotton." Yet,
even in Atlanta, they yet think of that man as
a clodhopper in home-made clothes. Even
they forget what a man may do in lower Georgia
in ten years.

It was in Florida also-at Sanford-that a,
man told me this story. We were standing
in his field of celery.

"Every one of those rows of celery is worth
as much as a bale of cotton. It requires at
least two acres in South Carolina, where I
came from, to produce a bale of cotton. In
these two fields there are 400 rows of celery-
$ 20,000. These two fields here, then, of about
twelve acres, will provide a crop as valuable
as the cotton produced on 400 acres of ordinary
South Carolina land. See?

"Well, last summer I offered my own brother
a field for celery here. He said he couldn't
afford to leave his cotton farm.

"'Haven't you some enemy?' I asked him,
'some man whom you wish to punish? Give
him your old cotton farm and go to Florida
with me and you'll get rich.'

"He hasn't come. My own brother regards
me as a visionary and othinks of Florida as a
home of alligators."

Stories like these you can pick up all the way
from Chesapeake Bay to Aransas Pass, in
T exas; for the coast is fast coming to be a vast
fruit and vegetable garden, as well as the home
of larger industries.

In the seaboard South these words denote
fortune and opportunity-cotton (short and
long staples); sea food; lumber; truck and
fruit; rice.

The profits of agriculture in this region,
especially, if we may assume that cotton will
continue to fetch IO cents a pound or more,
are probably larger (and they will become
larger yet) than in any other extensive area.

Of the coast cities, Norfolk will be a great
port-one of the great world ports, perhaps.
It has the best harbor on the Southern coast;
