lumber road should have. Even so, the grade
on this part of the line ran up as high as seventy
feet to the mile-mot at all an economical
grade. The line has been built on to Mullins,
58 miles from Deepwater, the latter construe
tion being somewhat better than the old line.
Surveys are through the mountains. Prince-
ton, 350 miles from Norfolk, is to be a sort of
centre for the system. The coal brought down
by the line that runs north and west from here
will be made up at that point into through
trains for the run to Norfolk. Princeton is to
be one of the important railroad towns of West
Virginia.

The work is tremendous. In a ten-mile
section of the road near East River, there are
five tunnels, many deep rock cuttings, and one
bridge 2,100 feet in length. The buildintof
the line requires the moving of millions of cubic
yards of rock and earth. The forces have
gone ahead, apparently, without regard to cost.
The road is to be laid with American Standard
8ypound rails, and ballasted with crushed
rock in pieces not less than three-quarters of
an inch nor more than two and one-half inches
in diameter. Everything about the road is
solid, heavy, and high-class.

What does it mean to West Virginia and to
V irginia? Will it threaten the life of the Nor-
folk & Western or the Chesapeake & Ohio?
Will it bring competition to the shippers of coal
from the Pocahontas fields? These are the big-
gest railroad questions of the day in the South.

To answer them one must look carefully at
the business of railroading in those states. A
coal road, say the Norfolk & Western, gets
its coal from mines that are located exactly on
the line of the Norfolk & Western. No rail-
road that runs a line five miles away from that
mine can get any of its coal to carry.- There
are four or five points on the Norfolk & Western
where its coal traffic can be reached by the new
line, but not more than that. It hardly reaches
the mines on the Chesapeake & Ohio at all.
For miscellaneous freight from the seaboard
into the mountain country it will, of course,
compete directly with both these railroads and
also with the Baltimore & Ohio.

The fact of the matter is that the new line
runs through an untouched section of West
Virginia. It will have to create its own coal
mines, not directly nor indirectly owned, for
that is against the new rate law, but served
entirely by the new road. Men who have
owned coal lands that could not be developed

because there was no railroad, will open them
to feed the new road. Men who are directors
of the new road are said to own great areas of
coal lands, bought for little because they were
not reached by the Norfolk & Western or the
Chesapeake & Ohio. These lands will be
opened. This very opening of the untouched
areas will people those areas with a new popula-
tion. Coal cannot be mined without men to
do the work. Naturally the creation of a huge
industry, sufficient to keep alive a road that
costs as much as this road, will of itself create
new traffic to be carried from the seaboard to the
mountains.

Beginning in 1904, the Norfolk & Western
has spent or will spend about $ 20,000,000 to
bring the line to a new standard. Detours
are built around cities, bridges across chasms
take the place of long circuitous climbs, tun-
nels piercing the hills replace zigzag lines
along the cliffs, great valleys are filled up with
earth and rocks to save a few feet of climb.

One of the main objects of this tremenduous
work is to make the Norfolk & Western a
fit passenger railroad to serve the sections
which it has peopled. In the first place, it
was a freight railroad and no fast passenger
service was attempted. As the country has
grown, the demand for a passenger service has
grown with it.

There are several more or less certain con-
solidations now under way in the South. The
Norfolk & Southern, under new control, is
in union with the Raleigh & Pamlico South,
the Virginia & Carolina Coast, and the Atlantic
& North Carolina, and has over 150 miles
of road in contemplation. Mr. John Skelton
Williams, formerly the president of the Sea-
board Air Line, has a plarr to consolidate half
a dozen small roads and build a few links be-
tween them to create a new line running from
northeast to southwest, from the manufactur-
ing region of North Carolina to the Gulf of
M exieo. The project is destined to strike
at the main line of the Seaboard Air Line, the
Atlantic Coast Line, and the Southern Railway.

The railroad development going on in the
Southwest cannot be handled in this article.
It is of great importance, and its scope is wider
than the building under way in the eastern
section. The old South, it will be seen, is
ripe for an era of progress. If the people of
the South cooperate with the railroad pioneers,
no man may foretell the railroad future of this
region.
