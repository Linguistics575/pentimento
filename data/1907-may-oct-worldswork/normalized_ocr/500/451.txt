THE DANGER

Hamid is under the control and direction of
German diplomacy. "Germany is our friend,"
is a saying that has penetrated even into the
masses of the Turkish nation, and the Kaiser
has the full right to boast himself ttS the pro-
tector and champion of the Mussulmuns.

By tradition, by its dynasty, and by its
alliance, Austria plays the r√©le of a vanguard to
this German advance to the "Near East. The
occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has
made Austria It Balkan power, and its plans
are ready for the march of an Austrian army
southward to the Gulf of Salonica, which will
bring it in touch with the Egean Sea and
make it ruler over the whole Peninsula. In
the meantime, it is strengthening its political
and economical influence in Servia and Al,
bania by the same methods as used by the
Germans.

In the midst of this land activity, the im,

portance of the eEgean Sea, whirh is the neces-.

sary link, was not lost to view. A footing was
sought and the island of Thassos wag chosen
as the foundation stone of the future naval
power in the Eastern basin (if the Mediterra-

many would gain a still greater in0uence in
Turkey, and especially on the European and
Asiatic shores of the [ Egean Sea. According
to trustworthy information obtained in con-
fidence, a vast German activity is contemplated
on these shores in the very near future.

As to the nature of the Austrian advance, it
may be judged from the rule of Austria in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Austrian policy
in Bosnia has been one of terror, of espionage,
of famine, and of assassination. It is ac-
complishing the moral and material ruin of a
splendid country, the crushing of a noble
Servian race which has fallen ben mth its hand.
It is a grave and grim story of misrule and
oppression. Spies are on every hand, and no
man knows at what moment he may be thrown
into prison'on some fictitious charge.

Bosnia is an unknown land as far as the rest
of Europe is concerned, and probably these
facts may come as "complete surprise to readers
