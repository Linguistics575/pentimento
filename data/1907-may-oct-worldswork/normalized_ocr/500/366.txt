910.; THE MARCH
conditions have lately become more and more
alarmed about. We have no adequate machin-
ery for training boys for high hand-work; and
there is an increasing social disinclination to
take up the trades. Some of the few trade
schools that we have lack as many pupils as
they could train, because boys of ability and
earnestness prefer the more "respectable"
life of business and of the professions. A lad
will become a bank-clerk for $ 10 a week who
would scorn to become an iron moulder for $ 20,
in spite of the fact that the moulder is the more
likely, if he have thrift and executive ability,
to attain independence.

On one side the workingmen's organizations
discourage the highest cfhciency and on the
other side our educational life and our social
life set up false standards. It is high time
we were waking up to the peril in which this
puts American life; and the many signs that we
are waking up are among the most cheerful
facts of present activity.

THE OPEN SHOP CAMPAIGN

HE National Association of Manufac-
turers is alive to the danger to our
industries that a lack of workmen's cfficiency
brings. Under the presidency of Mr. James
W. Van Cleave, of St. Louis, the Association
is undertakingto arouse the public to the full
truth of our industrial situation. Its platform
has as its principal plank the open shop. The
open shop means: "No restrictions in the
use of tools, machinery or materials, except
of such as are unsafe; no limitation of output;
mo restriction of the number of apprentices
santl "helpers, when of proper ageino. boycott;
hd sympathetic'. strike; no'fsaeriiiee of. the
independent workingman tovthe labor union;
mo compulsory use of the union label."
Thcsrprihci'plcs are necessary for American
industrial progress. For that matter they are
necessary even for social or political progress.
Under the influence of the unions, apprentices
have been restricted, the boycott and the
sympathetic strike have been used to the damage
of innocent persons, and output has been
limited. Worse yet, where they have had
sufficient political influence, graft has thriven
-necessarily because politics rested on a
false basis. Worse yet, our social notions
have so changed that the skilled trades are not
as attractive to American youth as they once
were and must become again.
The Association' of Manufacturers, with its

OF EVENTS

local organizations, is systematically under-
taking a campaign of education, using every
legitimate method of persuasion; and it will
establish labor bureaus where workmen may
find employment and employers may find
workmen. Every State will have its com-
mittee to further the Association's aims. And
it is undertaking a general campaign for the
establishment of trade high-schools as a part
of the public school system. This is the
solution of the diflicOy that seems most
promising and most probable.

THE OPEN SHOP-A CASE IN POINT

HE efforts of ill-managed labor unions

to obstruct industrial progress are illus-

trated by a little occurrence in the press-room
of THE WORLD's WORK.

Mechanical feeders are now made which
feed paper to printing presses with greater
regularity and at greater speed and consequently
with greater economy than men can feed it;
and the presses on which this magazine is
printed are equipped with these mechanical
feeders. The Feeders' Union in New York
demanded that as many men should be em-
ployed in this shop as would Joe required if
no mechanical feeder had been invented.

This demand means that a number of men
must be kept at full wages whose sole duty it
would be to stand (or to sit) and see the ma-
chinery run-c-see the presses fed better than
they could feed them. When the owners of the
shop declined to accede to this demand, all
the feeders and the pressmen as well, who had
not even the feeders' excuse, went out. Some
of them, or their fellows of the union, are now
spending their days on the street nearby as
"pickets," endeavoring to persuade the men
who have their places to give up their jobs.

This demand is the same as to say that a
shoe-manufacturer who pegs shoes by machin-
ery must employ as many shoemakers as would
be necessary to peg by hand all the shoes that
he makes by machinery. It is the same as to
say that a cotton-manufacturer must employ
as many women as could spin by hand all the
thread-produet of his mill; and so on. In a
word, the industrial advance made by machin-
ery must be stopped! This in the face of the
fact that every competent pressman in the
United States can get a job at good wages.

When a union or any other set of men under-
takes so large a task as checking the use of
machinery, they make a pitiful display of a
