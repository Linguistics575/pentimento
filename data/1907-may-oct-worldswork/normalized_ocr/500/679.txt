THE MONEY-KINGS

placed it in 4,000 national and state banks,
all over the country. The report of the Comp-
troller of the Currency, just out, has been our
guide. We have deposit accounts, in hundreds
of names, of course, about equal to the amount
of cash that each of these banks normally
carries in its vaults. Our plan is to make a
simultaneous demand upon these banks for
the deposits, in cash. We are of the opin-
ion that we shall get at least five-sixths of
the total amount, at once. Whenever poss-
ible, our agents will be instructed to get
gold from the banks, or at least legal-tender
money, rather than bank-notes. All notes
received, whether bank-notes or government
notes, will be presented immediately to the
proper authorities for redemption in gold.
T hat is all."

He sat down. The Banker had just cut the
tip off his cigar. Absent-mindedly, he scratched
on the mahogany table, as the host finished,
the single word, "all." And as he scratched
he kept his eyes on the tip of the knife. He
knew that every eye about the table watched
his face. He said nothing.

The Gambler broke the silence with a laugh.

"It looks like enough!" he said.

"Shall we do it?" It was the host that
asked the question, and he wet his lips with
his tongue as he spoke.

"Yes!" said the Industrial Magnate, softly.

"Yes!" echoed the other three.

They left in silence. It was no time for
words.

OUR STORE OF REAL MONEY

Yes-it could be done! I take it that if
the accounts were well distributed one billion
dollars of bank credits could be simultaneously
converted into bills and silver and gold in this
country. The last report issued by Mr. William
Barrett Ridgely, the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency, showed that there were in all the banks--
national, state, savings, and trust companies----
deposits of real money that aggregated a little
less than $ r, roo, ooo, ooo. In addition, of
course, there is another two billions or more in
circulation, outside the banks. If a billion
dollars of bank credits were to-day presented
to solvent banks for conversion into money,
practically all the real money in the vaults
would be drawn out to meet that demand.

But gow-what of the gold? For gold is
currency in all lands, and gold it must be, if
men determine to wreck the United States and

all that is in it. Perhaps all the banks hold
$ 200,000,000 of gold in their vaults. Another
half-billion is scattered about the country, over
the line in the banks of Canada-they want our
gold, having no coinage of their own-hidden
in hoards for export to Italy, or China, or any
other land that sends us citizens, locked up as
"christening gifts" for infants. That is not
commercial gold and could not be drawn out.
The rest, perhaps $ 900,000,000, is in the
Treasury of the United States. The con-
spirators could draw it out. The "gold certifi-
cates," the bills that lie in your pocket---
occasionally-will demand it. It must be
paid. Practically, the Government is pledged
to pay all its bills in specie.

And then-the panic! Perhaps you think
not. Then let us look to history. One day--
you, old bankers of the Street, will remember
the day, the 9th of August, r86r--a man came
post-haste to Wall Street from the Treasury
at Washington. He needed money. Wall
Street gave it to him. He thought that he
wanted it in gold, thinking that so he could
scatter it about the country and meet payments
in gold, thereby making the credit of the ctrug-
gling Government look better than it was.
Voices were raised against him, vehement
voices, voices that spoke golden wisdom. Mr.
James Gallatin, president of the National
Bank of New York, said to him:

"Coin is the basis of credit. It is impossible
to maintain the superstructure of credit when
the basis is withdrawn, for in destroying the
basis the superstructure is also swept away!"

But Mr. Salmon P. Chase knew better. So
he carted away from Wall Street $ 170,000,000
in gold, and scattered it abroad. F our months
later, the banks of the United States were com-
pelled to repudiate the greenbacks. The
dollar fell in value to 62 cents. It took almost
twenty years to bring it back again to par.

THE MEANING OF A GOLD FAMINE

Again, let us go back no further than 1893.
In that year, through a legislative blunder, gold
was drawn away from the Treasury in huge
masses. This continued through 1894 and
1895. The surplus of gold in the Treasury to

protect the outstanding bills dropped, and
dropped. When bonds were sold and gold
poured into the Treasury, it faded away like a
morning mist. Not only did foreigners call for
it, but the people themselves hesitated, talked
it over, then finally began to call for gold. All
