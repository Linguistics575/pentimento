have no idea what those magic words may
portend, or what they have to do with
sending "a letter to my love." That does not
matter at all.

They can never keep still when the hand-
organ man comes around. It is a pretty
sight to see a crowd of happy youngsters on
the city street, dancing and skipping for joy
about the hurdy-gurdy. And they invent
dancing games and songs for themselves, this
small race of poets and mimics, never minding
what the sense may be, if only they get a chance
for active rhythmical expression.

Surely this is the golden time in a man's life,
if there ever is one, for the cultivation and
development of this wonderful sense-a sense
which, if it is once given its due, opens up
many avenues into what is beautiful and noble.

So far the scheme has been formally adopted
in New York only for girls. Whether, under
present conditions, equally good results could be
obtained in classes for boys is not altogether
clear, though some of the more vigorous horn-
pipes and flings have been tried with them with
great success. But there is the right moment
for the beginning of any new movement. At
present the school-boys of New York have a
highly organized system of athletic games
which is bringing splendid results, both for
those who are naturally athletic and for those
who would keep altogether on the outside.
An innovation may not be desirable at this
time.

Neither is it yet certain just what dances
will prove the best suited for our American
conditions. Some of the spirited and char-

acteristic folk-dances of Sweden and Russia
have so far seemed to make the very greatest
appeal to the children. Great care is always
taken to have the accompanying music ap-
propriate and distinctive, for the music and
the dance are organically related.

Adaptations and changes there must of course
be. The dances are intended to meet the
needs of American children; they must relate
themselves to American conditions; and much
of their value would be lost through too strict
an adherence to the traditional letter of the
performance.

Our national temperament, enthusiastic and
spontaneous, needs just such an outlet for its
surplus emotional energy. But one thing is
certain: any such growth must be from within.
There would be small use in instituting a
festival if there were no inner festival spirit.
In the New Orleans Mardi Gras, in the Harvest
Homes of some Western cities, with their
pageants and ceremonies, in the Carnival at
Quebec, in the vividly remembered Dewey
Reception in New York, in the religious and
national Observances of all European coun-
tries, we see rational and appropriate expres-
sions of this spirit.

There is every reason for believing that a
country in which the children had been given
a chance to develop their natural instinct for
rhythmical and harmonious activity would
have a national life far richer, deeper, and
more beautiful than one where the main empha-
sis in education was upon bare intellectual
training for the purposes of "practical suc-
cess." It is at least worth thinking about.

I N I E USED to have a "plaza" in our
town, where the hoboes rested in

the shade at noon, and where at

night twice a week we went to hear the band
concerts. Now we have a "courthouse park."
It is the same thirteen acres of grass and trees
and flowers, with the same courthouse in the

centre. But we call it by a different name. The

transition from "plaza" to "courthouse park"
in our vocabulary marks the path of our
evolution from a frontier town in California,
with many traces of Mexican influence in our
"lingo," to a civilized modern little city
dominated intellectually by New England
schoolma'ams.

In the old days we were mostly Southerners,
