was the orator held in such high

repute as in the South before the war.
2yfr. William Garrott Brown, in an illuminating
essay on William L. Yancey, makes this ob-.
servation on the ante-bellum South:

PERHAPS in no other part of the world

"It was the spoken word, not the printed page, that
guided thought, aroused enthusiasm, made history.
These were the true universities of the lower'i'iuti, -" the"
law courts, and the great religious and political gatherings---
as truly as' a grove was the university of Athens. The
man who wished to lead or to teach must be able to speak.
He could not touch the artistic sense of the people with
pictures, or statues, or verse, or plays; he must charm
them with voice and gesture."

Within the memory of even a young man, the
decline of the orator's power in the South may
be traced, and a corresponding increase in the
power of the written word. Mr. Joel Chandler
Harris wrote in reply to an invitation to deliver
an address at a Southern university: "I would
not make a speech for one million dollars."
An increasing number of men-men of power
and influence-are not ashamed to make
the same confession. The old-time "ranter"
is hard to overcome, but itmay be said that ten
men now write their speeches to every one who
did twenty years ago; hence we have less emo-
tionalism, and a greater precision and accuracy
in speaking. I have known more than one man
whose intellectual life has been revolutionized
by the process of weighing carefully his words
and stating concisely and pointedly his meaning.

This change may be seen especially in aca-
demic celebrations. Recently the address at
an important civic celebration of a college in
North Carolina was delivered by a business
man who spoke in a plain, practical way on
"Work." People heard him gladly because
he was a commonwealth-builder and he had
something to say that went to the heart of

things.

The same change may be seen in the
orations of college students. A politician of
the old school, on listening to the orations of a
certain college commencement, complained
that boys were no longer sophomoric, that they
were actually trying to convince an audience
of truths in which they believed.

I lay stress on this point because it seems to
me one of the most significant facts with re-
gard to the contemporary South. An outsider
who wishes to know the South of to-day, or at
least the South of the future, should look for
it, not in the Congressional Record nor in the
Southern speeches quoted with such relish in
the New York Sun, but in the more important
addresses that have been delivered at various
educational meetings of the past decade. More
than one of these addresses, in subseq.u.ent
publication, has influenced Southern opinion
profoundly.

Along with the change in the style of public
address has come a pronounced activity in the
direction of writing. During the year rtpor6
some twenty-five or thirty books were written
by North Carolinians---- ten of them being
brought out by the leading publishers of the
country. The list included a book on syntax
that has won the approbation of the leading
English scholars of the world; a scientific dis-
cussion of education; a text-book on economics,
already adopted by many colleges and high
schools; two books on the cotton industry and
the changes caused thereby; a history of
Methodism in North Carolina based on a study
of documentary material collected by the
author; a history of the Federalist system
---one of the volumes in the American Nation
series; several historical studies, ranging
from doctoral dissertations to more elaborate
treatises; a biography of the leading Southern
poets since the war; a book of sketches and
