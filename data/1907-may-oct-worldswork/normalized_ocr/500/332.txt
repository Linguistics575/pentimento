was made to repeal the prohibition law. In
order to secure the vote of Mound Bayou,
which seems to have the balance of power in
the county on this question, a "still hunt"
was made among the voters in the community.
A plan was arranged by which a saloon was to
be established in the town and one of the
citizens made proprietor.'

"This scheme came very near going through,"
said Mr. Montgomery. "The plan was all
arranged before we heard of it. Then we
called a meeting and I simply said to the people
that experience in our own town had taught us
that a saloon was a bad thing to have in the
community. I said that if the law was passed,
a colored man might run the saloon here, but
in the rest of the county they would be in the
hands of white men. We would pay for
maintaining them, however, and we would be
the ones to suffer. We voted the law down
and there has been no serious attempt to open
the county to the liquor traffic since."

In a certain sense, it may be said that the
Mound Bayou town and colony have been a
school in self-government for its colonists.
They have had an opportunity there, such as
Negro people have rarely had elsewhere, to
learn the real meaning of political institutions
and to prepare themselves for the duties and
responsibilities of citizenship.

It is interesting to note, in this connection,
that this is one of the few instance in which
Negroes have ever organized and maintained
in any Southern state a government which has
gained the entire respect of the Southern people.
A writer in a recent number of the Planter's
J oumal, published in Memphis, says:

"Will the Negro as a race work out his own salvation
along Mound Bayou lines? Quien sabe? These have
worked out for themselves a better local government than
any superior people has ever done for them in freedom.
But it is a generally accepted principle in political economy
that any homogeneous people will in time do this. These
people have their local government, but it is in consonance
with the county, state, and national governments andinter-
national conventions, all in the hands of another race.
Could they conduct as successfully a county government
in addition to their local government and still under the
state and national governments of another race? Enough
Negroes of the Mound Bayou type, and guided as they
were in the beginning, will be able to do so."

The story of Mound Bayou would not be
complete without some account of the man who
founded the colony and to whose patience and
wisdom it owes the greater part of its success.

OWNED

Isaiah T. Montgomery was born on the planta-
tion of Joseph E. Davis, a brother of Jeffer-
son Davis, the President of the Confederate
States. The plantation where he was born,
in 1847, was known as "The Hurricane" and
was situated in Warren County, Miss. His
father, Benjamin Thornton Montgomery, came
originally from Virginia. He was purchased
in Vicksburg by Mr. Davis, while he was still
a boy. He had picked up a little education
from his young master in Virginia before he
was sold South. After he came into the pos-
session of Mr. Davis, he managed to acquire,
in some way that Isaiah could never account
for, a very good practical education, so that he
was able to make surveys and draw plans for
buildings, and for years he was in practical
control of the plantation upon which he was
employed. There were four children, all of
whom received the rudiments of an education
from their father.

When he was nine years of age, Isaiah was
set to work sorting and filing letters and papers
in Mr Davis's office, and from that time he
lived in his master's home. He had a great
deal of copying to do for Mr. Davis and it
was in this way that he gained a practical
knowledge of written English that has stood
him in good stead ever since. As he grew
older he became the special attendant of Mr.
Davis, having charge of all his public and priv-
ate papers, and he worked steadily in his office
until the breaking out of the Civil War. In
1863, Mr. Davis retired, upon the approach
of the Federal armies, to the interior of the
state, taking with him his slaves. Young
Montgomery was left behind with his father,
however, to assist in taking care of the Planta-
tion.

After the destruction of the Federal gun-
boat I ndianola, at Hurricane, and the passage
of the Federal gunboats under the batteries
of Vicksburg, Isaiah entered the service of the
United States as a cabin-boy for Rear-Admiral
Porter. He was present, in his capacity as
cabin-boy, at the battle, of Grand Gulf,
accompanied the first expedition up Red River,
and was a witness of the operations at the siege
and capitulation of Vicksburg. In the winter
of 1863, he lost his health and was discharged
from the navy at Mound City. From there
he went to Cincinnati, where, through the
kindness of Admiral Porter, his parents had
been able to precede him.
