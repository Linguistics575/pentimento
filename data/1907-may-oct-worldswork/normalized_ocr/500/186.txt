evils of other sections." When the late Dr.
McIver wrote that "we pay convicts, when we
employ them to work on our own public roads,
more than we pay capable men and women
to train children," and that "there is nothing
in our homes that we would let a forty-dollar-
a-month laborer work upon except the brains
of our children," he was applauded for it.

A HIGHER INTELLECTUAL AVERAGE

More important than the statement of facts
has been the presentation, in various forms,
of the immense significance of universal
education. One of the most noteworthy
changes in the more important institutions of
learning is that their presidents are men
who have been trained as specialists, and
who therefore approach educational p" rob-
lems from the standpoint of educational
experts. The time when a broken-down
politican could be elected to an important
presidency has passed here as in the rest of the
country. This is but one of the many changes
that are indicative of the rejuvenated life of
Southern colleges. Their faculties, composed
almost altogether of specialists, are carrying on
the work of higher education in a spirit which
has already been noted as characteristic of the
departments of history and English. Students
in these institutions are thoroughly abreast
with contemporary tendencies, both in the
college world and in the larger world of affairs.

The culmination of the activity in higher
education is the larger freedom in which men
work and think. In spite of ecclesiastical in-
fluences on the one hand and political influences
on the other, the best colleges are moving to-
ward tolerance in all things.

These institutions are the centres of indepen-
dence in politics, just as independent news-
papers and business men are becoming more
and more prevalent. They are also promoters
of liberalism in religion-a healthy liberalism
which has so far not caused any radical cleavage.
Perhaps the most widely circulated story with
regard to a Southern institution is that of the
dismissal in 1878 of Professor Winchell from
Vanderbilt University on account of his views
on evolution. And yet, if one were to take
that incident as typical of the educational life
of the present South, he would misjudge and
misinterpret it.

The most striking confirmation of the grow-
ing freedom in Southern colleges was the action
of the board of trustees of Trinity College in

INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION

North Carolina in refusing to accept the resig-
nation of Professor Bassett, notwithstanding
his views on the Negro question. In the face
of a widespread popular clamor, the trustees
set forth a declaration of academic freedom
that resounded throughout the country. Some
of the sentences will indicate the spirit of
the whole:

"The search for truth should be unhampered and in an
atmosphere that is free. Liberty may sometimes lead to
folly. Yet it is better that some should be tolerated than
that all should think and speak under the deadening in-
fuence of repression. Money, students, friends, are not
for one moment to be weighed in the balance with toler-
ance, fairness and with freedom."

The late Chancellor Hill, on reading this
statement to the students of the University of
Georgia, characterized it as a ringing declara-
tion of academic liberty which will be an im..
mortal chapter in the history of civilization in
this country.

The movements which I have here briefly
suggested as they have found expression in
worthy writing, are but now in the beginning.
I do not mean that all of them have been vic-
torious, or that they are predominant in South-
ern life to-day. The forces of reaction and of
conservatism seem at times all too strong for
the forces of progress and enlightenment. But
I have no doubt of the ultimate triumph of
truth and righteousness and freedom. There
is in the minds and hearts of the men who work
for these forces a buoyant hopefulness that aug-
urs well for the future. Whether they are doing
the actual work in the industrial world, or
whether they are engaged in the work of inter-
preting through the written and spoken word
the tendencies that I have indicated, they be.
lieve that their task is one of the noblest ever
committed to men. They do not need the pity
of any outsider who may look with conde-
scension upon the South of to-day. They
glory in the difficulty and the high privilege
of the task. They believe the South to-day
to be, as America was in the day of Emerson,
the land of opportunity. As one of our own
number has recently said:

"Those that sit in soft places and discuss academic
propositions (and mistake self-indulgence and criticism
for the intellectual life) are welcome to their ease. We
would not swap birthrights with them. If we have a rough
task, it is a high task. While we are doing it, we shall
have the joy of constructive activity. We look forward
to a golden age that we may surely help to bring, not back
to one that never was."
