BY

AN ENGLISH TRAVELER AND WRITER

[ This article embodies the conclusions reached by the
author of a remarkable forthcoming book concerning the
Near East. The name of the author is
is one of the best known English writers, is a personal
friend of the King of Italy, the German Emperor, the
Sultan of Turkey, King Peter of Benin, Prince Ferdinand
of Bulgaria, and many other European sovereigns. This
year, he has traveled on a confidential journey through
the Balkan States and talked with the various rulers,
including the Sultan of Turkey, and nearly all the Cabinet
Ministers of each nation. He frankly admits that many
of his revelations come close to being a violation of con-

fidence. ]

LL through the Balkan Peninsula the
weak are to-day crushed by the
strong. The Austrian Eagle has over-

shadowed and grasped Bosnia; it has its talons
in Servia; and it is casting eovetous eyes upon
gallant little Montenegro. On the other hand,

Macedonians are daily outraged, murdered, or
burned alive the true facts being always

stricken country, so that Bulgaria and Turkey
may be compelled at last to lly at each othcr's
throats.

That Macedonia to-day is a hell, I have seen
with my own eyes. I travcled--contrary to
the advice of my friends-right through the
heart of Macedonia from south to north,
visiting the Seres and Melnik districts, which
only a few days prior to my arrival had been
ravaged by Greek bands. In one poor village
I passed through, twenty-three women, child
dren, and old men had been butchered in cold
blood on the previous day, and I saw some of
their mutilated bodies. In Caraja-kioi, a
village near Sores, a fortnight before, nineteen
persons, mostly old men and women, had been
massacred; and l was informed by cye-wit-
nesses that the Greek band had been assisted
by the Turks, and that present at the massacre
were a Greek MetropoIitan and a Greek eonsu~
lar employee.

Everywhere I went I heard the same terrible
tale, the same cry for the protection of Jhe
Powers. At Vmnja, in the \IeInik distiht,
I saw the gaunt ruins of seven houses which
had been recently burnt, and was told how
nine women, after being subjected to all sorts
of atrocities, were afterwards shot; while at
