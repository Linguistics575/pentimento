devouring the diseased germs-in other words,
to render a person immune, or to cure him,
by coming to the aid of the white corpuscles.
Aid may be given to them when they are at-
tacked by certain diseases, by the injection
of a preparation made from a part of the
diseased matter itself. "

This, in brief, is the philosophy of the
"opsonic" treatment, with which investigators
and practitioners are now busy and of which
the medical journals are full. The great
hope is that this treatment may be found
successful with pulmonary tuberculosis; but
the experimenters are not yet agreed that this
has yet been conclusively accomplished. But
it has been successfully used in the treatment
of local infections, such as recurring boils,
acne, inflammation of the bladder, bone and
joint inflammations, and (so some practitioners
claim) in typhoid fever.

The profession, with the safe conservatism
of scientific men, goes slowly in drawing con-
clusions. But there are bacteriologists and
practitioners of high attainments who believe
that by this method a new era in medicine
has been begun---that typhoid and tuberculosis
and many other diseases will be cured by it;
and, theoretically, they regard it as probable
that men can be made immune to these diseases,
from time to time, as by vaccination we are
made immune to smallpox-but not by the
same method.

The wise layman, as the wise investigator,
withholds a final judgment till there has been
a long accumulation of successful experiments.
But there is good reason already at least to
hope that we are about to profit by one of the
most important discoveries ever made.

OUR RELATIONS WITH CANADA

HERE are more than a dozen questions

between the United States and Canada,
almost every one of which should be capable
of a quick settlement if responsible represen-
tatives of the two countries will get together for
the discussion of them. That such a discussion
is now contemplated is good news, both in
Canada and in the United States.

The visit of Secretary Root to Earl Grey at
Ottawa early in the year was a preliminary
step. It has been followed by a brief visit
by Mr. James Bryce, the new British Ambas-
sador to the United States, who made the pil-
grimage to Ottawa one of the first steps in his
diplomatic career. All signs point to the belief

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

that Mr. Bryce, Mr. Root, and Earl Grey are
getting to understand one another in prepara-
tion for an international understanding on the
vexed questions between the countries.

The Governor-General of Canada has al-
ways been considered a social rather than a
political figure. When it has come to real
diplomatic work between the countries, it is
probable that Earl Grey will give place to the
elected heads of the nation, but it must be
considered a tribute to the personal strength of
the Canadian Governor-General that he has
been brought into the negotiations at all.

The most important question is the tariff.
Mr. Root wants the Canadians to throw open
their markets to American trade, and build up
a tariff wall against the Mother Country.
That is a serious proposal, and Canada has
shown no disposition to concede to it. There
may be concessions, but there will be no sur-
render on the broad proposition. The settle-
ment of a new basis for mutual traffic is a very
big and important diplomatic task.

Some other questions that might be settled
by sensible arbitration are the preservation of
Niagara Falls by restrictive legislation, the
regulation of coastwise fisheries, the making
of a new law to allow the building of warships
on the Lakes, the saving of the seal herds in
the Bering Sea, the re-enactment of laws to
permit of freight transit in bond across sections
of both countries, the question of alien labor
laws in their application to Canadians in this
Country and Americans in Canada, and half
a dozen small specific matters local to boundary
territory. None of these present great difficulty.

In general, the people of this country will
welcome any diplomatic activities that remove
or tend to remove the barriers between us and
our neighbors across the northern border.
There should be no room for hostility between
the United States and Canada, either in mat-
ters of politics or in matters of trade.

0KLAH0MA'S CONSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS

HE hunger and thirst for corporate right-

eousness that just now are the keenest
appetites of the public will be appeased in
Oklahoma by the new constitution which will
be ready to go before the people of that state
for adoption next August, if the President
approve. It is an interesting experiment, for
it is an attempt to embody in the organic law
of a state the remedy for existing public evils,
so that no future legislation may even permit
