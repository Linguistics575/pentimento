BIRMINGHAM TWENTY YEARS AGO

The city was founded in 1871 and its first iron furnace was built
in 1870. The opposite page shows a scene now typical

hopeless ignorance of fundamental economic
forces; and you would often hear allusions. to
the North as if it were a foreign country and a
country where men somehow prospered at the
expense of the South. I do not recall bitter-
ness in this undertone of conversation so much
as loneliness-an isolation, and a sense of
despair. The South somehow seemed doomed
to poverty for a long time to come.

After two months of such observation, in
spite of the pleasant personal experiences that
I had had, when I went back to Boston I
wrote nothing for publication. I read over
my note-books and concluded that if I under-
took to describe what I had seen'and heard,

JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

the dominant note would be a note of depres-
sion, and I did not see how such a report would
be of any value to anybody. It surely would
not cheer the Southern readers of the magazine,
and I was afraid that it would only deepen
certain misapprehensions that some Northern
readers already had of the Southern people
and of Southern conditions.

1 have time and again been in most of the
Southern States during the intervening ten
years, but I had not, until this year, made a
systematic journey to them all, for the purpose
of definite observation. But now I have just
gone over the same journey, taking two months
and a half to make it, and I have visited nearly
all the places that I visited ten years ago, and
a good many more. Everything is different.
The larger cities have become enormously
larger and more active, and their tone, if you
can speak of the tone of cities, is wholly dif-.
ferent. The street scenes, the street con-
versations, the things that you see by going up
and down through the business thoroughfares
now are the same as you will see and hear in
active business cities anywhere else in the
world. There is nothing, except, perhaps,
the presence of the Negro, to indicate whether
you are in the South, or in the West, or in
the North. The activities and methods of
all sections are becoming very much alike.
