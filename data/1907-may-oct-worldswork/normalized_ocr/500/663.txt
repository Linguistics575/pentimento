THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA IN THE PHILIPPINES

The elevator service of the building will
have several new features. In addition to the
"locals" and the usual "through express"
elevators to the upper floors, there will be a
"shuttle "elevator for some of the intermediate
stories. Of the nine elevators which will be in
the tower, four will go to the thirteenth floor
only; three will go from the first to the thirty-
fifth floor; one from the first to the forty-
seventh floor; and the "shuttle" will run from
the thirty-fifth to the thirty-eighth only.

These elevators are of a type in use in
only one New York ofhce-building and they
differ in a striking way from the elevators
generally in use in this country. The usual
type has a lifting cable that winds upon a drum
as the car ascends and unwinds as the car
descends. The drum is made to turn by an
electric motor. This arrangement is undesir-
able in this building; on account of the great
height and corresponding length of the cables,
the drum would be too large to fit into the
available space. This difficult problem is
solved by omitting the drum and by putting
at the top of each shaft a motor and a wheel,
directly on the shaft of the' motor, over which
the cables pass. One end of the cable is
attached to the car and the other end to the
weights which counterbalance the car. As
the motor turns in one direction the car ascends;
as it turns in the other direction the car
descends. The elevators are equipped with

9461

apparatus for safety so constructed that if
all the cables on top of the car should be
severed the fall would be gradually and gently
checked. In case of an excessive downward
speed of the car, the governor under the floor
automatically reaches out strong steel fingers
on either side; these press down the steel
blocks one on top of another as the car de-
scends until the increased friction of these
many blocks, which fit very tightly around the
wires, stops the descent without a single jar
and perhaps without the passengers realizing
that anything has happened.

A radical departure has been made by the
owners in the letting of contracts for the con-
struction. There is no general contractor.
The "general contractor" is a middle man
who accepts the entire responsibility for con-
structing a building but who does only a portion
of the work himself and "farms out" the rest,
upon which he either charges a commission or
makes a profit by charging more than he pays.
In this case the owners preferred to make con-
tracts directly with the men doing the work.
Thus they contracted with the several com-
panies for the foundation work, the elevators,
the brick work, etc. Altogether, nearly a
hundred contracts were let direct. Thus the
owner and the architect are brought in direct
contact with the contractors actually doing
the work and can maintain a more satisfactory
supervision. The work of construction was
begun May I, 1906, and it is expected that it
will be completed by January, 1908.

Held together by the admirable system of an
