MEXICO AT

Nearly all of it comes to us, and of late we
have been buying about $ 15,000,000 worth
each year. As to coffee, we bought 24,6oo, ooo
pounds from Mexico last year, an increase of
3,000,000, though our total importations fell
off by 200,000,000 pounds. Of tobacco we
took $ 2,000,000 worth; of vanilla, $ 4,000,000.
Then there is sugar cane, which next to cotton
is developing fastest as an industry. The
demand for sugar has grown so during the past
five years that even the peons no longer regard
it as a luxury, and consequently the sugar
business is creating a place for itself near the
top. There are sugar mills, equipped with
American machinery, throughout the cane
districts, and sugar even figures on the export
list.

Wheat, corn, and breadstuffs must still be
imported, but the area of cultivation is con-
stantly widening, owing to the introduction of
modern American farming implements.
Hitherto much of the virgin soil was not broken
because of the crude facilities, but now the
land is increasing in value, and is also be-
coming more thickly settled. Mexico has
many flour mills, but as yet it must buy about
82, coo, ooo in wheat from us each year to keep
them running at their full capacity all the time.

A REVOLUTION IN FARMING

Though this is Mexico, and a farm is a do-
main, and the unit of land measurement is
more than 4,000 acres, yet progress is at work
even here to make the acre produce more.
Mexico has always had irrigation, though not
on the stupendous modern scale that reclaims
deserts. But immense irrigation schemes are
now under way, particularly in the arid north.
The President recently authorized an cxpendi-
ture of $ 5,000,000 for one in Coahuila.
Another, in Hidalgo, made possible three crops
in two years. In some districts three crops of
corn are gathered in one year. Mexico is also
looking into dry farming to bring its millions
of barren acres into the national assets. Soil
inoculation proves especially effective. One
expert, Zeferino Dominguez, who has a model
farm in Puebla, cultivated the bacteria that
supply the frijole bean with nitrogen, then
made a solution in which he soaked the frijole
seeds. Thus he increased the number of pods
for each vine to four hundred, as against sixty
and eighty ordinarily. He maintains that he
can triple the production of Mexico's haciendas.

Now let us come to the invasion of the

American cowboy. At home the wire fence
has lost him his paradise, but on the vast ranges
of Chihuahua he finds it again. Here the
barbed wire, the sheep man, the homesteader,
may never shorten his horizon. From Mexico
the cattle business first crept into the United
States, and now from the United States it is
going back again, but on the big American
scale. Ranches are of the size of kingdoms.
There is one of 17,000,000 acres; another of
5,000,000; a third, owned by an American
company, of 2,000,000; a fourth, Canadian,
of 1,000,000. One syndicate of Americans
owns 4,000 square miles. And to improve
the stock on these vast ranges, carloads of
pure-bred American cattle and horses are com-
ing in every week, so great is the demand.

TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES

This last item suggests how, the more self-
sustaining a country becomes, the more de-
pendent it is. Mexico's bill of goods is con-
stantly growing. It bought $ 42,000,000 more
in 1906 than in 1905 and required $ 38,178,000
more in metals, including mining machinery,
which it got from us. Because of new mining
development, there prevails almost a famine
in machinery and tools. The American fac-
tories are about six months behind with orders;
and as to steel rails, of which Mexico will need
millions, we have practically abandoned it
to Europe. But the attitude of our steel barons
is not altogether due to the overrush. They
fear tariff speeches, and desire to give no such
provocation as underbidding Europeans in a
foreign market and selling at from five to ten
dollars less per ton than they ask in the United
States. They would rather wait until after
the next campaign. But as to rolling stock,
we are not so reluctant. We are hurrying
locomotives and freight and passenger cars into
Mexico at a fast clip.

But in all lines of foreign commerce Mexico's
last fiscal year showed a proportion of increase
unprecedented for any country. The increase
of imports was 23.83 per cent; of exports,
30.03 per cent. But though its exports in-
creased the most, and though the balance of
trade was in its favor and slightly against us
the year before, yet the balance was in our
favor this last year. In other words, we ab-
sorbed all the increase in its imports, and more
too. As against all countries combined, last
year it had a balance in its favor of S2 5,000,000,
and yet there was, a balance in our favor of
