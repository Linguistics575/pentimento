THE HONOR OF THE RAILROAD

belief that they would sign a statement which
they did not believe to be literally true.

Let us look into the methods they employed
in their research and the results at which they
arrived. They went back to January, 1900,
so that their investigation covered seven years
of work on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Every
one of the 40,000 stockholders was addressed
in a circular, asking for information with re-
gard to any act of malfeasance by any em-
ployee of the road. The public also was asked
to turn in any complaint that it had to make.
Over 2,500 of the officers and employees in
positions of trust were examined personally,
and compelled to reply frankly to every question,
whether of duty to the company or of personal
investment or pursuit.

Much of the original discontent arose from
the method of giving cars to shippers. The
committee hired the Audit Company of New
York to go into this. This independent con-
cern put 35 accountants, 80 clerks, and 12
stenographers on the books, examined 16,000
sheets showing the daily car distribution and
7,500 special orders for cars, made 45,000,000
postings on these reports, and finally turned
in a report of 2,678 pages, giving the con-
clusions.

It is probably safe to say that never in the
history of business has a large corporation
been so mercilessly dissected. The Penn-
sylvania has over 2OO, OOO employees. In the
seven years under review, its men have
handled, from earnings and capital, close
to (h, 500,000,000 cash, and have had the spend-
ing of that amount of money, in payrolls,
purchases, and various other ways. The
men who have been in a position to divert parts
of this tremendous total to their own uses num-

ber 2,505. These are the managers, super-
intendents, comptrollers, and others in
authority.

Now let us look upon the results. Of the
40,000 stockholders, one wrote to the com-
mittee making a complaint. From the general
public, 19 signed letters of complaint and sug-
gestion were received, and 6 men wrote anony-
mously. All the complaints were taken up
in detail.

The net result of the investigation is that 15
men on the systems have been reported by the
committee to the presidents for punishment.
They were found to have taken from various
outside interests stocks of various kinds, pre-
sumably in the nature of bribes.

Of the others, 251 are found in possession
of stocks of companies with which the Penn-
sylvania does business, but the stocks were
bought and paid for in money. In almost
every case, the holding of the stocks dates
back to the days when the officers of the road
were encouraged to create and assist in creating
companies, in order to create business for the
road at the same time.

Not one single instance of "graft "is reported
in the purchasing of supplies, in the immense
purchases of real estate in New York, in the
colossal transactions involved in the new
building carried on through these seven years.
In the awarding of contracts, the committee
found as follows:

"That no officer or employee of the railroads has directly,
or indirectly, received any compensation, or gratuities, from
any contractor."

When I read this report, I regarded it as an
artistic whitewash. Going through it step
by step, with my mind upon the names of the
men who signed it, it became the most splendid
vindication of human nature that has ever been
given to the public of the United States. I
know the railroad business. It is full of the
most beautiful opportunity to any man of
brains who wants to practise "graft." There
is no other occupation in the world of business
in which the sharper or the grafter could so
flourish as in this occupation of handling
thousands of dollars of "company money,"
and distributing to hundreds of great shippers
Yet,
here is a committee beyond reproach. It has
gone through the whole business for seven
years back, employed outside auditors of known
reputation, checked up every possible chance
for crookedness. At the end, it convicts
fifteen men of possible, not totally proven,
dishonesty.

Before going further, it is as well to say that
this Pennsylvania report, and the contributary
facts to follow, refer to the relationship of the
railroad men to the railroad. The point of it
is that the men on salary, the privates of the
line, as it were, are faithful to the railroad, and
that they do not abuse their power to collect
tribute at the expense of that railroad.

Everyone is familiar enough with the story
of corporation "graft." The trail of it lies
all over this country. When it comes down
to a, final analysis, the money paid out to
legislators, the passes issued to the "powers
