THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL MOVING PICTURES OF WILD ANIMALS IN THEIR NATIVE
HAUNTS: A BULL MOOSE
The moose was forced by two canoes to land on the muddy shore within about twelve feet of the moving-
picture camera. He came ashore so close to the camera that it was impossible to tilt the machine down mmugh
to get him on the film, so part of the landing scene was host. The last column shows the mouse panning
within fifteen feet of the camera in his flight to the woods. This series was made on a small lake in New
Brunswick during a severe rain-storm.
