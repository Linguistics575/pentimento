PART OF BOMBAY UNIVERSITY
The universities of India are yearly giving to that country scores
of highly educated Hindustani who are to be the leaders of the New

India of to-morrow and work out the salvation of their country

but it fain would have us forget that while it
has sunk over $ 200,000,000 in the unprofitable

reservoirs to catch and hold the waters that
flow from the hills in spring, then come again
no more until the year has fled.

The uplift of the world goes on, slowly, it
may be, here and there; but, for the most
part, swiftly, wonderfully. Little Japan stands
first, but close behind are Africa and South
America. Why is it that the past forty years
have brought these wonders?

England and the United States supply the
answer. Time was when England went
a-colonizing with set bayonets. To-day, hav-
ing learned many lessons, it colonizes with the
railroad locomotive and the plow. It is
commerce that to-day is founding schools to
teach the young men of the alien races to
write figures, building railroads to bring down
the riches of the Hinterland, irrigating the
deserts of Egypt and tempting the Dervishes
to study the growing of cotton, teaching the
Zulu to handle the plow, coaxing the Congo
cannibal to mine the copper of his hills, driving
the railroads to the tips of the Andes, found-
ing great docks on the muddy flats of the great
La Plata. It is the Age of Commerce, and
the walls that have stood unbroken for cen-
turies against the onset of arms, religion, and
pedantry are crumbling to pieces before our
eyes as the first waves of commerce lap their
bases.
