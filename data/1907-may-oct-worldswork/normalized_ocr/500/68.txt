the traces would tangle. But provisions must
be packed in; so the hunter ties some on the
dog's back, the rest on his own shoulders by
the pack strap around his forehead; and with
cased gun in hand, forward he marches. Of
his lonely nights in the snow-padded silences
of the great forests, of his lonelier tramps over
the frost-glazed drifts till the snow-glare sets
the purple patches dancing in his vision, of
being snowed up by blizzards for weeks at a
time till provisions run low and his only course
is to take a reef in his belt each day-space does
not permit the story. Woe to the trapper who
has been "holed-up" by storm with "a pard-
ner" of the trail and comes out of those winter
quarters without that partner. He will have
to tell a very straight story, indeed, of how he
escaped and the partner didn't, unless he wishes
to fall under the suspicion of having "done his
pardner" to death-scuttled provisions, run
away, or let him starve. And when spring
comes, the furs that have been trapped and
cached for the winter must be brought out
much the same way that the hunter went into
the wild-by packing over rough ground, by
dog-sleigh or canoe on a clear trail, down to
some point on the railroad like Edmonton or
Winnipeg.

Or take the romance of the sea otter ex-
posed for sale at Nijni. Formerly ermine was
the badge of nobility in Russia and could be
worn by no one else. Then it commanded
fabulous prices. To-day, sea otter is the
badge of wealth and rank. When sea otter
were first taken off the Aleutian Islands of
Alaska, the catch ran from 100,000 a year to
140,000. To-day, it has dwindled down to
400, of which-I am told by traders-only 200
come to the American market. Any over that
go to Russia. The sea otter is a furred crea-
ture of the sea more the size of a large dog than
of an otter. Hold a pelt up by the nose with the
tail tip just touching the floor-it is longer than
a six-foot man. In the days when sea otter
were plentiful, they could be shot by still hunt
m calm weather, as their heads came to the
surface of the sea to breathe. Now they must
be hunted in the teeth of the wildest Alaskan
gale. The native Aleutian rides out in his skin-
skiff, with oiled-skin wrapping his body tight
round the little manhole where he sits in the
skin covering, so that the boat can take no
water. Double-bladed paddle plying from
side to side, the hunter mounts the seething
waves and rides in on the back of the storm to

the reefiest coasts of the Aleutians. Here the
sea otter have been driven by the storm and
hide with their heads buried in the tossing,
wave-washed seaweed. Beaching his boat,
the hunter runs from rock to rock, slippery as
glass, beaten by the wind, sometimes caught
by the waves and hurled to death. A single
blow of his gaff-pole, and he has killed the sea
otter, whose pelt is to be exposed for sale at
Nijni.
THE CRUELTY OF SEAL-POACHERS

Or, take the pelt of the beautiful Alaskan
fur seal. These are best dressed in England
and those from the North American Com-
mercial Company, which has the exclusive
right to the Pribilof Islands, will be found
chiefly in the London auction marts; but there
is also a Russian sealskin company with rights
on the Commander Islands; and the biggest
sealer of all is the unnamed company of
poachers-Japanese, American, Canadian.
The poachers rove the high seas, raiding the
migrating herds, and when a heavy fog falls
they scoot in under cover across the forbidden
line and plunder the seal islands themselves-
both the American islands of Pribilof and the
Russian Commander Group. Cruisers are on
the lookout for poachers; but cruisers can't
see through fog; and fog at the seal islands
falls thick as wool. What ground there is for
it, I don't know-but the Japanese, who were
not signatories to the sealing treaty, get the
credit or discredit of being the most recklessly
daring and cruel poachers. In 1874, the fur-
seal herd numbered almost 5,000,000. In
1891-98, at the time of the American-Canadian
dispute, it numbered only 1,000,000. To-day,
in spite of the international treaty forbidding
sealing within sixty miles of the seal islands, the
seal herd numbers barely 180,000. Not so
many years ago, 100,000 seal pelts were annually
brought to the markets of the world.

"I don't believe," said one of the largest
traders in the world-one who was lately
called on to give information to the President
on the subject because he has no connection
with either the San Francisco or the St. Pcters-
burg companies-Nutt there will be more than
10,000 or 14,000 seals come to market annually
for the next few years. The trouble is not so
much in the scaling itself-it is the indis-
criminate killing. Hunters who shoot the
migrating herds as they swim can't tell male
from females. On the islands, the females are
