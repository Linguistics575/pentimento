A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES

of the community, about 6,000 acres are
already under cultivation. This land pro-
duces annually about 3,000 bales of cotton and
from one-half to two-thirds of the corn and
fodder consumed by the community. The
original site of the town has been extended
until, including the thirty acres in the original
plot and the several additions that have been
made since, it embraces a tract of ninety-six
acres.

With the influx of population, the value of
land in the town and the surrounding country
has greatly increased in value. Property
inside the town that formerly cost from $ 7
to $ 9 an acre sells at present, in the form of
building lots, at prices ranging from one to
three cents per square foot. This land, which
was assessed at one time at two dollars an acre,
has now an assessed valuation of $ 2 3,073. s s.

The business of the town has grown with the
growing population. There are thirteen stores
and a number of small shops in the town
which do an annual business of something like
$ 600,000. The express business at Mound
Bayou amounts to $ 2 So per month. The
railroad station is the tenth in importance
between Memphis and Vicksburg, according
to a writer in the Planter's J ournal, and the
railroad traffic amounts to $ 40,000 a year.

There are six churches and three schools in
the town. One of these, the Mound Bayou
Normal and Industrial Institute, conducted
by B. F. Owsley, has a building which, with
the seven acres of land belonging to and ad-
joining the school, is valued at $ 3,500. This
school was started by the American Missionary
Association before the town was incorporated.
The expenses of maintaining it, about $ 1,500
a year, are met in part by the society that
founded it, but in part by a tuition fee of $ 1
a month from its pupils. A second school,
established and maintained by what are known
familiarly as the "Sister Workers of the Col-
ored Baptist Church of Bolivar County," has
a large two-story building for recitations, and
plans are now being made for the building of
a dormitory to provide accommodations for
pupils who come in from the surrounding
farms to get the advantages of better schools
than the county can provide.

The town is gradually increasing its facilities
for doing business and is acquiring all the
machinery of a highly organized community.
Mound Bayou has a bank, three cotton gins,
a telephone exchange, a weekly newspaper,

9127

and is preparing to issue bonds for the con-
struction of waterworks and the erection of a
system of electric lighting. It is an indication
of the progress of the town that a well-kept
cemetery-an institution too often neglected
by Negroes-has been established on one side
of the town, and a public park of five acres
has been laid out on the other. Mound Bayou,
though an exclusively Negro town, keeps up its
connection with and interest in the outside
world. The post-office business amounts to
between $ 400 and $ 500 a quarter. Fifty
Memphis papers are sold every day in the
town and there are a number of subscribers
to the magazines of general information.

The business interests of Mound Bayou
town and community centre in the Bank of
Mound Bayou, organized March 8, 1904, with
a capital stock of $ 10,000. The earnings of
the bank during the first eight months of its
existence amounted to 17 per cent. In 1906,
it paid a dividend of 16 per cent. and set aside
a considerable gum as a surplus. The follow-
ing statement indicates the condition of the
bank on Feb. 12, 1907:

As practically all of the business of the colony
centres in the bank, it is natural that nearly all
the prominent business men of the town should
be represented on the board of directors.
Charles Banks, the founder and cashier of the
bank, was a successful business man at Clarks-.
dale before he came, in 1903, to Mound Bayou.
He became interested at that time in the suc-
cess of the enterprise, sold out his business
interests at Clarksdale, and cast in his fortunes
with the colony. He is the youngest and most
aggressive business man in the town. John
Francis, the president of the bank, came to
the settlement in an early day from New
