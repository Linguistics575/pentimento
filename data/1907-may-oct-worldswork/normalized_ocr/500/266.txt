downtrodden fellaheen. "Let us ask you," said
the Prime Minister of Egypt the other day, to
Lord Cromer, "to allow us to consider you
always as one of us." This is the simple key
not only to the full tide of sympathy and grati-
tude upon which the retiring Agent went out
across the bar of Port Said, but to the success
which had won for him the love of a whole
people.

Yet he also kept the perspective of the
foreigner. Except that he did not follow
Joseph's extortion in the lean years, Lord
Cromer saw that the happy development of
Egypt lay in adopting his predecessor's fore-
sight and determination, so long also as he was
backed, just as Joseph was, by unanswerable
power. Without looking to the right hand
or to the left, he has always pursued that simple
and consistent policy. So dear to him have
always been the "voiceless millions of blue-
shirted fellahin" that he has denied them the
fatal gift of self-government. Wholly spurious
and manufactured, he says, is this demand for
Parliamentary institutions. Could we our-
selves find some alternative, how gladly we
would embrace it. We have long lost our own
love for party politics. Both in England and in
the United States, the doubt is rising in the
minds of those who think whether there is
any other justification for the party system
than that it has become by this timeinevitable,
an inelastic obstacle to true progress.

LORD CROMER UPON HIMSELF

His own summing-up of what his task was
is an interesting document. Clear before him
when in 1883 he was appointed was the twin
necessity-peace, and if possible friendship,
must at most costs be maintained with F rance;
a humane and far-sighted policy must be
introduced into a regime that had of necessity
to be bureaucratic. It is old history to repeat
but the trouble with France deserves a word.
When, in 1882, England called upon France to
join in intervention to save both the Khedive
and the situation, France declined. "Who
pays the piper calls the tune" and, since
that refusal, England-who entered upon the
tremendous enterprise with reluctance and a
heavy heart-has necessarily called it, subject
only to an ever-lessening control of an' inter-
national board.

But one who visits Cairo to-day for the first
time is not likely to understand the position
with which Lord Cromer found himself face

CROMER, MAKER OF EGYPT

to face twcnty-four years ago. The country
was nearly bankrupt; the worst evils of the
corv√©e were still crushing the fellaheen into
despair; agriculture was almost at a standstill,
even in the Delta; the whip was the argument
of the governing power; slavery was accepted
as a matter of course; the administration of
justice was at the service of the highest bidder;
hospitals were unknown; education in a mod-
ern sense was unknown; sympathy between
rulers and ruled was non-existent; the whole
of the Sudan province had been captured;
the meaning of Egypt as the centre of the
Old World had long been forgotten. With
just and serious pride, Lord Cromer referred
the other day to the undeniable fact that every
one of these abuses has been swept away during
the twenty-four years of his government.
Egypt has become the classical example of
sudden and splendid prosperity, and the
wrinkles of immemorial time across its face have
been transformed by Lord Cromer into fertile
furrows from which in a decade it means to
challenge on equal terms the cotton and sugar
growing countries of the world.

AN ELUSIVE PERSONALITY

But what of the man? I could hardly
describe him better than by saying that no one
knows Lord Cromer. His appointment, a
quarter of a century ago, was severely criticised.
Never in all the time that has elapsed has he
appeared upon the surface, while all the time
he was performing miracles unequaled in
history. The other day, I asked a Cabinet.
minister what the attitude of the new Radical
government was on the Egyptian question.
He said: "If Lord Cromer wishes to remain
till he is eighty, the present Government will
put no obstacle in his way." It has been given
to him to fill the most criticized position in
the whole round of civilized authority for the
working time of a man's prime of life, and in
that brief space a new and strong nation has
been formed out of jarring interests and cor-
ruption. Without a day's friction with his
own chiefs, without serious trouble with any
one of the many jealous watching powers,
he has brought the thing to pass and he has
done it so that when at last he leaves his throne,
the Egyptians and the very French themselves
join in a splendid act of gratitude.

Partly, of course, Lord Cromer judges his
man most excellently. He picked out Kitche-
ner, who as a spectator watched from Admiral
