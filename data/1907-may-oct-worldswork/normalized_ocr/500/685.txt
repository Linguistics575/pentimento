ENGLAND'S HOUSE OF LORDS

front of them is the famous "woolsack," the
seat of the Lord Chancellor, which is in reality
a large square ottoman covered with a dark-red
material and furnished with a projection
against which the Chancellor leans his back.
To his right and left the rows of benches face
one another down the chamber. Those to the
right are occupied by the Bishops and the
supporters of the Government of the day, who
just now are not a numerous body. The
Opposition sit on the left. The Bishops,
particularly the Archbishop of Canterbury,
are fairly regular attendants and their contri-
butions to debate are often of great value.
The visitor, depressed at seeing but one
Liberal peer for every five square-yards of the
ministerial side of the House, will find more
interesting matter among the Conservative
Opposition. Sitting here as regular atten-
dants of the House are men who have given
distinguished service to the state in politics,
war, and commerce. There is the Marquis of
Lansdowne, the most successful of recent
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs. There
is Lord Cawdor, who in Conservative days
gave up the chairmanship of the Great Western
Railway, held by him for years with eminent
success, to become First Lord of the Admiralty.
There is Lord Roberts, the central figure of the
South African war; and Lord Milner, the victor
of the even fercer struggle of South African
politics. There is Lord Rosebery, formerly
Prime Minister of England, who has the most
brilliant political mind in the country and is,
though a Liberal, generally opposed to the
present Government. There are men who have
ruled India, men who have governed colonies,
men who in diplomacy and war and finance
have received the best training in affairs that
the English state can give. A distinguished
career as a Minister of the Crown ends com-
monly in the House of Lords. Here, disguised
as Lord St. Aldwyn, sits Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach, who for eight years had control of the
national finances; and the Duke of Devonshire,
behind whom are more than twenty years of the
highest official life. What is in theory a numer-
ous hereditary chamber is in fact a, chamber
of limited numbers consisting of those peers
who take a serious interest in politics or have
been lately elevated from the House of Com-
mons for political reasons. And ranging, as
the choice does, over six hundred and odd of
those on whom the advantages of wealth and
education and influence have been most lavishly

bestowed, the comparative excellence of the
working fraction of the Lords need cause no
surprise. Their worst enemies do not aver that
they are other than businesslike, dignified, and
economical of time. Their oratorical average
is wonderfully little inferior to that of the Com-
moms; and so it would remain even without Lord
Rosebery, the most polished orator in the land.

IS IT A GOOD UPPER HOUSE?

In normal times, however, the question is
whether the Lords as an institution are worthy
of praise or condemnation. The value of a
second chamber in countries with representa-
tive government is not to be argued here. The
need of it will be assumed, and everyone will
agree that if ordinary constitutional states find
a second chamber advisable, in England where
Parliament is omnipotent from day to day and
never such a thing has been heard of as a j udicial
pronouncement on the validity of Parliamentary
acts, the need is more imperative than else-
where. The Parliament of England, it must
be remembered, is vastly more powerful than
any other legislature except the F rench. Not
only is it legally omnipotent, but the Ministers
of the Crown are members of it-generally of
the House of Commons-and a, hostile vote of
that House can any day force Ministers to
choose between resigning in a body and running
the great risk of advising the King to dissolve
Parliament, in order that the people may pass
upon their case in a general election. Thus the
Administration is not in a position to control
the House of Commons, either by vetoing legis-
lation or by making it ineffectual through un-
sympathetic execution. It is, by the nature of
the case, in close alliance with the majority
which supports it in the House. It is practi-
cally a committee of that majority. Its wide
powers, both in the purely executive sphere and
in the initiation of legislation and the manage-
ment of Parliamentary time and business, are
in fact derived from the good-will of this ma-
jority, whose desertion might bring it to ruin at
any moment. As a matter of practice, how-
ever, the majority never desert. In face of a
common foe, the majority and the Administra-
tion cling together like a happily wedded couple
and therefore wield, in the whole household of
state, an almost despotic power. As a check on
this despotism, there is as great a need for a
second chamber as could well be imagined.

But is the House of Lords a good second
chamber or a bad one? Now a question like
