divided.among them according to custom.
For the first time in a dozen years, the other
elective officials were Democrats, who promptly
turned out their Republican subordinates,
making all the more pressure upon Governor
Hughes to take care of the many little Repub-
lican politicians who knew no other means of
livelihood than a public salary and whose
services consisted in delivering the delegates
of their towns and in attending to the floaters
and the election boards every November.
Following the ancient custom, the Speaker of
the Assembly and the President of the Senate
called on him with tentative committee lists
and asked what they could do for him in the
way of committee appointments. His accep-
tance of this favor would have implied
reciprocity in the appointments within his
power. Governor Hughes did not fall into this
trap. He refused to look at the committee
lists and said that he was the executive, not
the legislature; and that he would refuse
to interfere with the legislature and expected
the legislature to refrain from interfering
with him.

Among Governor Hughes's first appoint-
ments were the Superintendent of Public
Works and the Superintendent of Elections.
These places had been filled by county leaders
who controlled delegates and who owned
Senators, Assemblymen, and Congressmen.
Congressman Herbert Parsons, who is chair-
man of the New York County Republican
Committee, and Mr. Timothy L. Woodruff,
the Republican boss of Brooklyn and chairman
of the state committee, had agreed among
themselves that Mr. Parsons should have the
choosing of the Superintendent of Public Works
and Mr. Woodruff of the Election Superinten-
dent. Before he took the oath of office,
Governor Hughes had announced that he was
going to appoint Mr. Charles H. Keep as
Superintendent of Banks-which, in the judg-
ment of the leaders, was all the patronage that
the Governor was entitled to. Mr. Keep knew
all about banks but it is doubtful if he could
name the counties of the state, not to say the
county bosses, and it was necessary that the
other departments should go to men who knew
how to distribute their immense patronage with
political accuracy. Since Mr. Parsons and
Mr. Woodruff were the first to favor Governor
Hughes's nomination and were the bosses of
the two most populous counties of the state,
they were naturally entitled to take first pick

of the offices. But Governor Hughes thought
that he was elected to take first pick himself,
and he did. Neither Parsons's man nor
Woodruff's man was appointed. Every office
in the Gpvermor's power of appointment
Governor Hughes filled with the man he
thought best.

MR. HUGHES'S INDEPENDENCE

Before the appointments were announced,
Governor Hughes received an invitation to go
to Washington and take dinner at the White
House. He went. He arrived at the hour of
his dinner invitation and as soon as the dinner
was over he went away. The waiting reporters
had expected the dinner to be preceded or
followed by a political conference. "Not a
word of politics was spoken," Mr. Hughes
told them. What the President and the Gov-
ernor talked about is nobody's business but
theirs. But the students of state politics in
New York have thought that they have seen,
not hostility, but a vigorous independence on
the Governor's part. The Administration gave
open aid in electing him---witpess the speech
at Utica of Secretary Root. The Governor is,
no doubt, appreciative. But he does not
look at the subject in a personal way at all.
He is Governor-that's all.

The White House dinner and some follow-
ing events are among the incidents which
account for the wholly indeendent relations
now existing between the President and the
Governor. Whatever Governor Hughes is
doing, he is not building up a political or-
ganization in New York for the Roosevelt
policies. He is not building up an organ-
ization of any kind. He told the Albany
Republican organization, at a reception to
which they had invited him, that he believed
in party organizations only as methods of
expressing and executing the public will
and not as a means of livelihood for their
members. He said that the Republican party
was many times bigger than the organization
and that when the will of the organization
supplanted the wishes of the party, the state of
New York would go Democratic, as recent
examples proved. What the Governor said
in his Albany speech he has repeated in other
public addresses until the politicians have come
to believe that he really means what he says
and that, so far as he can, he will do what he
promised.

One of his first official acts was to recommend
