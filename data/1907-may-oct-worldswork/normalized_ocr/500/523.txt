WHAT THE FOOD LAW

ete., suggest themselves, for these articles of
food are often bought in bulk and resold to
the consumer in small quantities.

SPECIMEN LABELS

The following labels, taken at random, show
how the new law will affect some of the pro-
ducts in general use.





TOMATO KETCHUP

It is pronounced by connoisseurs one of the finest condi-
ments for use with hot and cold meats, game, fish and
oyster stews, etc.

This ketchup contains a combination of
vinegar and spices, and is preserved with one tenth of 1%
benzoate of soda. No coloring matter.

The above label could not be used now if
any coloring matter is employed.





ORANGE MARMALADE FRUIT JAM

packed.

The word "fruit" on jams and jellies gen-
erally means apple juice. Most of these imi-
tation products are given the particular fruit
or berry flavor indicated by the label from a
coal-tar essence. This label is misleading and
the guarantee by no means insures that the
"fruit" is orange.





A CEREAL MIXTURE

Coffee Sick People seldom charge their ill feelings to
the true cause.

Analytical Chemistry shows the poisonous alkaloids of
Coffee, as in Tobacco, Whiskey and Morphine.

A Perfectly Healthy Man or woman can stand these for
a time, but "constant dripping wears a stone," and finally
headache, torpid liver, sick stomach or heart, and that
"weak all over" feeling shows that a poisoned nervous
system is calling for help and relief.

Small Wonder that a fixed organic disease of some of
the members is finally set up.

Relief cannot be obtained unless the cause is removed.

This Mixture, when brewed, takes the beautiful deep
seal brown color of Mocha or Java, changing to a rich
golden brown when cream is added.

The above "exploitation" cannot be put on
a label under the new Food Law. It must be
reserved for bill-boards and other advertising
media.

BY A PECULIAR PROCESS IN

its manufacture which preserves the Theobromine and
nutritive portion, is rendered treble the strength of Cocoa
as usually prepared. It yields a delicious flavor, and
is an easily digested and thoroughly wholesome Cocoa.

There are very few simple articles of Food which possess
so many valuable and important dietary properties as
Cocoa. Medical men of all shades of opinion
have agreed in recommending it as the safest and most
beneficial article of diet for persons of weak constitution.

The Excess of Oil having been Removed, no sensation
of heaviness follows the use of this preparation.

The sentence beginning with "medical men"
will probably be changed by October Ist.





SHREDDED CODFISH

One pound of Shredded Codiish is equal to more than
two pounds of any other fish in the market.

This is probably an exaggerated claim.
Food Law Regulation 17, (e) says: "Descriptive
matter upon the label shall be free from any
statement, design or device regarding the article
or the ingredients or substances contained
therein, or quality thereof, or place of origin,
which are false or misleading in any particular."

The above label fully meets the require-
ments of the law and lets the consumer know
exactly what he is buying.





FRESH FRUIT QUINCE JAM

We guarantee these goods to contain no injurio, us sub-'
stance and no substitute for fruit and sugar.

This label does not state that the article i,
made only from quince, or from quince at all.
The guarantee given may be quite true. The
new law requires that such labels shall be
more explicit.





SUGAR CURED MEATS
U. S. inspected and passed under the Act of Congress of

June 30, 1906. Establishment No. 6-c.
This label implies that these goods conform
to the food law requirements.



BREA KFA ST COCOA

from which the excess of oil has been removed, is Absolutely
Pure and it is Soluble. No Chemicals are used in its pre-

lyaratiou. It has more than three tim.s the strength of Cocoa



MIXED PICKLES

zoate of soda.

This is a fairly explicit label.
