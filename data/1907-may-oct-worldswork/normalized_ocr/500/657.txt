OUR TOWN LIFE-WHAT IS IT WORTH?

in the mayor's hands. Next they elected a
non-partisan set of officials from the decent
element. After a stiff fight the open gambling
was stopped. The nickel-in-the-slot machines
were the hardest to root out, but they had to go.
The hours of opening of saloons were regulated
better. The police department was improved
and lawlessness stamped out. The Chinese
lotteries were pretty well cleaned up.

We are still far from model in our regulation
of these things, but our town is no longer a
frontier inferno, and it is a better place for a
boy to grow up in than it used to be.

Socially, our regeneration has passed through
some important evolutions. The women began
it-that was their job while the men cleaned up
politics-with some literary clubs. Culture
soon stalked in our midst with thunderous
tread. Our ladies dissected Shakespeare and
probed Browning's mysteries, and recovered
from these fatiguing operations with tea. The
encyclopedias in the public library grew worn
and aged, as the pursuit for culture galloped
through them. Books on art-pardon, Art-
were in demand. The favorite authors of all
ages were kept day and night in uniform at
call, even including that prolific old standby,
Mr. "Ibid," whose works one lady demanded
should be included in the reading course of one
study club. Even to this day our women's
clubs flourish and are increasingly useful. They
have brought an esthetic element into our life
that we were wofully lacking in. They have
brought lecturers to our town who have told
us of the progress of art and science all over
the world. They have brought great musicians
-Paderewski, Ysaye, Hoffman, Gadski, and
their like-to interpret the world's best music
for us. They have led the movement for more
beautiful avenues about our town. And where
we were once only amused or indulgent with
their work, we now take it seriously and thank
them for its results, as they deserve.

We draw social lines, perhaps loosely, but
still they are there. Our Southern remnant
hangs together fairly well, rallying around the
organization of the Daughters of the Confed-
eracy and an occasional supper of'Possum, with
yarns, from down South. Then the pioneers
of the county, who still call everything east of
the mountains "the States," form a looser
social circle. Of course, the churches form
their own centres of social activity. The labor
unions-we are unionized clear through from
cooks to retail clerks-Hose members are

nearly all members of "fraternal orders,"
centre their relaxation around these orders.

Then we have our vulgar rich crowd. The
rest of us disapprove of them. There is too
much drinking and gambling and smoking by
men and women in that crowd, and we frown
on them. Some of the women break into the
culture clubs and are socially redeemed, but
we let most of them go their vulgar, boisterous
ostentatious way, ignoring them. But we must
confess that they seem to get a good deal of
gross animal enjoyment out of life, which
irritates us. They are "common," and we
don't understand why they should have the
money when we could use it so much better to
minister to our higher and more delicate
cravings.

Not all our rich people, of course, nor any-
thing like all of them, come under the head of
our "vulgar" rich. Most of our well-to-do
people are simply ourselves grown a little better
off than our neighbors, and our new possessions
do not affect our neighborliness nor our
manners. Some of our richest citizens are even
conspicuously public spirited, being leaders in
the support of our library, our Y. M. C. A., our
good roads movement, and our political reforms.

Our social diversions have improved in some
respects. Fifteen years ago, in the hot weather,
the ladies went to the Coast or the mountains to
keep cool, while the men worked and perspired
in the valley town. Thus grew up the Alfalfa
Club, or order of temporary widowers. The
members met in the cool of the evening on some
man's lawn, with a keg of beer for refreshments,
and proceeded to make Rome howl with song
and story. At about ten o'clock the Wiener-
wurst band appeared, consisting of musicians--
or at least men with musical instruments--
dressed in ragamufnn style, each man playing
a different tune, the whole discord being a
chorus for the high-pitched cornet's air which
was invariably "There'll Be a Hot Time in
the Old Town To-night."

The Alfalfa Club is a tradition now, and the
Gentlemen's Club is its successor. This latter
has pleasant quarters and is run like any well-
ordered men's club anywhere. Its membership
includes many of the best professional and
business men in town.

Our social progress now is chronicled in a
Society column, in the papers-I had almost
forgot to say that we have three daily papers
now, with full press dispatches. Here we print
