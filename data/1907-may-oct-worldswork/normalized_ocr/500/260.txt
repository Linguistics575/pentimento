THE MARCH

9058
arbitration held at Lake Mohonk, the serious
discussion-if not of disarmament, at least of
limiting armaments-by responsible men in
many of the great Governments, and, most of
all, the successful test of the Hague Tribunal
have put the whole subject in men's minds in
a new way. The public opinion of the world
is taking seriously the subject of the substitution
of arbitration for war; and this is an incalcul-
able step forward. The present Conference
will consider seriously the making of the Hague
Court a judicial tribunal instead of a semi-
diplomatic body; and the automatic assembly
of the Conference hereafter, so that there may
always be a sort of High Court of the nations
and a regular periodical meeting of their
representatives. The present Conference--.
most of all-has the serious attention of "the
public opinion of the whole world.

CANADA'S DESTINY

OTHING that has arisen from the
Colonial Conference in Great Britain is
more profoundly interesting than the outburst of
imperial loyalty in Canada. Every word, trite
or heart-felt, that was uttered by the pre-
miers to bring closer together the scattered
units of the Empire seems to have awakened
genuine echoes in Canada.

Is Canada drifting toward rather than away
from the mother country? Americans, count-
ing the thousands that yearly emigrate to the
North, figuring carefully and statistically the
commercial ties that yearly strengthen between
Canada and the United States, have been wont
to take it for granted that some day Canada
will be at least a second American republic,
if not a part of our own republic. Yet to-day,
the imperial note is stronger in Canada than
it was ten years ago.

Nor does the native-born American popula-
tion of the Canadian Northwest seem to alter
the situation greatly. For every American,
the Dominion records tell us, who goes across
the border, two real Britons from the old
country come in to keep the balance true.

In Ontario and Quebec, the Canadian
traditions are kept as sacred as they ever were.
Toronto is in no respects an American city,
either in its business or its social life.

Things move slowly, but the growth looks
healthy. Certainly, the future of Canada
gives, if anything, less worry to the Canadians
than it gives to us. They are confident, and,
apparently, quite satisfied with their status.

OF EVENTS

A REPORT THAT HAS LIFE IN IT

IF GLADSTONE made the figures of a
budget read like a romance, a county
public school superintendent in Illinois has
achieved as remarkable a victory over a sub-.
ject usually even more dull than figures-he
has made a school report a human document
of delightful as well as stimulating reading.
The county is Winnebago County, and the
superintendent is Mr. O. J. Kern.

His first phrase strikes a note that runs
throughout, "People of Winnebago County:"
no formal address, but a strenuous sort of
greeting.

"The schools belong to the people and the people can
have what they want. Country people can have
better schools when they spend more money on them and
spend it in a better way. It is said that the farmers cannot
get their children to the central school. The farmers of
Winnebago County never fail to get their milk to the
central factory, if it takes four horses...' The
truth that the money question is fundamental in making
better country schools might as well be faced first as last.
It is the duty of the county superintendent to ascertain
what is being done out on the front line of county school
improvement all over the United States. It is his duty to
present these facts to the consideration of his people. It
is for the people to act. The people can have better schools
if they want them."

Then follow reports from every school dis-
trict-an average of three lines of type to a
school, in answer to three terse questions:

"What were net proceeds of school social and how was
money expended?

"What improvement on school grounds in spring of 1906?

"What attempt at a school garden?"

The answers are preceded by this comment:
"Where no reply is given nothing was done.
This does not necessarily imply that there was
no need of doing anything."

Photographs of school grounds, well kept
and ill, are printed beside the names of the
teachers and directors who deserve the credit
or the censure for their condition. The
"deadly parallel" is used, as in the argument
for more beautiful school yards. A page
of pictures of lovely country scenes in Winne-
bago County carries this comment: "Children
see these on their way to school; why do not
the school grounds reflect some of this beauty? "
Beside two pictures of farmers' homes set in
groves of trees the legend reads, "Do the
owners of these homes believe in the educa-
tional value of trees? How about the school
grounds in their respective districts?"
