run in for safety and food, feed on the larvae
so effectively as to exterminate them. No
matter how large the area of a swamp, the
following scheme of drainage will suffice.
Extend tide-water ditches, wide enough and
deep enough to carry the main body of neigh-
boring water in both low and high tides, as
far into the swamp area as the drainage capac-
ity of the smaller ditches requires. These
narrow ditches should be from six to eight
inches wide and eighteen to twenty-four inches
deep. They can carry about 1,000 feet, so
tide-water ditches must be planned accordingly.
The former should be about fifty feet apart.
Swamps so ditched will, except in spells of
continued wet-weather, be dry enough all
summer to walk over "dry-shod."

There are some 50,000 acres of mosquito
swamp land on the western half of Long
Island, and 200,000 acres in the state of New
Jersey. The public does not realize that this
tundra soil is the most fertile and best adapted
to garden-truck farming of any suburban lands.
It can raise $ 10 an acre of swamp grass without
cultivation, and as much as $ 100 an acre of
potatoes and other vegetables. What an
opportunity for corporation farming, or even
for individual garden trucking! The cost
of fitting such areas for such purposes, where
diking would not be necessary, would be much
less than the purchase or rental of customary
ground. The profits of the near future will
surely lie in the economies that will avoid
unnecessary waste and make waste places
bearers of healthy incomes.

Extermination of the mosquitoes can be
accomplished in any community for less than
I per cent. of the realty value, and their re-
moval will easily add IO per cent. to such value.

RESULTS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED

It has been proven during the last six years
by individual communities, that mosquitoes
can be so far exterminated as to cease to be
a noticeable annoyance. From one to three
years time has been required to do this. But,
as mosquitoes will fly from one district to an-
other, it is evident that thorough extermination
is an undertaking for county or state control.
Both the states of New Jersey and New York
now have laws giving needed authority to
various boards of health to declare that any
territory breeding mosquitoes is sustaining a
public nuisance, and to step in to correct the
same if private owners do not do so. The New

Jersey legislature appropriated some $ 350,000
last year for progressive application in clearing
its large tracts--the Newark meadows, coast
swamps, etc.--through the next five years.
Some $ 10,000 had already been expended
largely in experimental work, the success of
which led to the larger donation. Staten Island
has received an appropriation from Greater
New York of $ 17,000, with most satisfactory
results up to date. The results obtained
in and around Havana-the almost complete
cessation of yellow fever-are a matter of
general knowledge.

SUCCESS IN THE CANAL ZONE

In a similar manner, a large body of men
along the Panama Canal are successfully coping
with a most difficult situation. Both the
anopheles and the stegomyia are very abundant
there; but by extensive drainage and filling-in
on the one hand, and direct fumigative destruo.
tion of the infected mosquitoes in dwellings
where there has been malaria or yellow fever
on the other, Colonel Gorgas has secured
wonderful results, some of which are con-
vincingly set forth in the message sent to Con-
gress by President Roosevelt on his return
from the Isthmus. As a result of scientific
methods of extermination in Culebra cut, only
two solitary mosquitoes were found after a
careful house -to-house examination, neither be-
longing to the two fatal varieties. At Corozal,
formerly one of the most unsanitary places on
the Isthmus, there was a marsh with a pond
in the middle. Colonel Gorgas drained the
marsh and the pond, cleared off the brush,
and made the breeding spot a meadow with
drainage ditches. As a direct result, the sick
rate of Corozal dropped to less than one per
cent. a week, reckoned by admissions to the
hospital. There is now a large hotel filled
with Canal employees and their wives, located
on what was once called a "hog wallow." The
President records, with much gratification, that
only one mosquito was seen by any member of
his party during his stay on the Isthmus.

Some 20,000 people die annually in the
United States from malaria. Four thousand
died during the New Orleans epidemic of
yellow fever in 1878, and over 300 in 1905.
The money losses suffered by this city alone,
if applied to mosquito extermination, would
have more than cleared every state on the
Gulf of Mexico of the infected mosquitoes and
all their relatives.
