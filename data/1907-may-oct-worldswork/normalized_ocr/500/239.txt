A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

Was recently sent to the Isthmus on this
errand. An inland city of Mississippi looking
across seas for trade!

The people who own Mississippi have,
of course, been the planters. In recent years
the lumbermen have come to share this owner-
ship, and the tradesmen follow. There is yet
little manufacturing in the state except lumber,
but the men who settled it were among the very
best immigrants from the older Southern States
to the East. They are men of ability and of
cultivation; and now that the era of town-
building is coming, they are likely to show their
character, both in commercial and industrial
energy and in good judgment, and to have
better public leaders. But Mississippi is yet
an unoccupied land. When it has been
settled and even a small part of its rich area
brought under cultivation and its vast stretches
of country made accessible by railroads, it will
be a rich part of the great, rich valley.

Mr. Whitfield, the Superintendent of Public
Education in Mississippi, says that "never
in the history of the world was the life of a
people so completely changed as was the life
of the people of Mississippi by the war" -by
the change from the feudal organization of
society. There are more than 1,800 white
boys and girls at the industrial schools-a
fact that shows the practical turn of thought
and effort. "Our young men are patriotically
falling into line. They see that there is just
as much honor and emolument in being good
engineers as in being good lawyers."
diffusion of prosperity here, too, is indicated by
the growth of banks-from 113 to 247 since
1890; and the bank deposits have been multi-
plied by five and a half. From 1896 to 1899,
565 stock companies of all kinds were chartered,
with a capital of 25 millions; from 1900 to
1903, 1,312 were chartered, with a capital of
73 millions. The cotton crop, too, has greatly
increased-from a million bales in 1900 to a,
million and a half bales in 1906.

NEW ORLEANS

The revolutionary achievement of New
Orleans is its three-fold work of constructing
an adequate water-supply, a sewerage system,
and a system of drainage. The draining of
the city brings a new era in health and in build-
ing-they can have cellars now; and "sky-
scrapers" are going up that have eighteen or
twenty feet of dry land below them.

The great city that is fast growing up there

--its estimated population is now 34tv00o---
will be an uncommonly healthful city; the last
report gives 17 deaths (whites) per 1,000.

The imports increased 25 per cent. and its
exports 16 per cent. in 1906 over 1905; and
last year 2,000 buildings were put up. A hint
of the growing valley trafhc is given by this
fact-that the'Frisco Railroad system is
building terminals at Chalmette (seven miles
below the city) to cost 4 millions, and the new
sugar refinery there will cost 3 millions.

The city, for an indefinite timc-as it ex-
pands into a great metropolis-will keep its old
social charm and its partly foreign character,
which make it different from any other Amer-
ican city. Its very thought is different: it is
both extremely Southern and very strongly.
Roman Catholic.

It has now passed its period of political de-
pression and of epidemics. It has itself in hand.
It is growing rich. Even its geographical
isolation becomes less and less as its great
transportation systems multiply. It is the
great Southern gateway of the Great Valley
and the gay, old-time, half-foreign, peculiarly
Southern capital besides..

MEMPHIS

For a story of commercial and industrial
activity, you may well turn to the recent history
of Memphis-the city that, in a sense, lies in
the very heart of the Mississippi Valley. To
begin with, it made itself a remarkably health-
ful city by an effective sewerage system, and by
the use of artesian water. Its reported death-
rate is less than 10 per 1,000 of white persons.
Then it went about building itself, first of all
by its cotton. It is the market for nearly or
quite a million bales a year; and it must have
a new warehouse to shelter it and to ship it
from, a mammoth concrete structure of 160
compartments which shall hold 1,000 bales each,
with compresses. Then it went to work
building oil mills and the like; then its great
hardwood lumber industries followed. It built
"million dollars worth of buildings in 1902;
in 1903, 3% millions; in 1904, 4% millions, and
so on, till last year the buildings put up were
valued at about 6% millions. Its population
increased even faster; and one-third of the
white people are said to be of Northern birth.
When a man or a company thinks of going to
Memphis to begin any industrial enterprise---
