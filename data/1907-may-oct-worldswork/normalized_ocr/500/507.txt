THE UNITED STATES IN PORTO RICO

feet of ponies until it w as series of ridges and
holes. The native ponies take short steps, and
they step in the holes; the American horse
persisted in trying to walk on the ridges, so he
often fell. At one point, only the hind feet
slippcrl--hut they went over It precipice; the
fore-feet held, however, and the rider climbed
over the horsc's head and the animal scrambled
back into the trail.

When it is remembered that this entire region
is highly productive, that the slopes of the
mountains Itll' eovererl with coffee bushes or
are in cultivation to their very summits, the
importance of roud-building, becomes apparent.
The only means by which the harvest could
reach the market were the trails described.
The usual conveyance was the pack-donkey;
occasionally you might meet It lone farmer
struggling along through the mud with a couple
of bags of coffee loaded into It trough made
from a tree, the motive power being an ON and
the transmission line It rope. One planter
made the statement that to transport coffee
even from Utuado to the port cost himas much
as the fre, ight from the port to Liverpool.
Another soil that to travel from Mannabo on
the southdust coast to Muyaguez on the west
coast, between June and October, would cost
as much as "trip to New York.

This is the explanation of the importance of
the road-builder; and this will suggest the
economic importance of 327 miles of macada-
mized road already built by the Americans,
and of the million dollars to be used in con-
structing other roads.

If you will multiply the railroad mileage of
1898 by two and its cfliciency by ten, the results
will show the conditions that exist to-day.
