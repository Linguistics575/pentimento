WHAT FRANCE CAN TEACH US

by governmental influence until it has become
a national attribute." And yet this, too, is
easy of comprehension, once you gain a broad
conception of artistic taste. It isn't merely
the appreciation of beauty in what we call the
fine arts-as if no other arts were fine! It is
also the appreciation of charm and grace and
excellence in all the things that make life agree-
able, as well as an appreciation of noble quali-
ties in all the work of a man's hands. Because
of the agreeableness of human existence in
France, Frenchmen loathe the thought of
emigration; consequently, notwithstanding an
appallingly low birth-rate, the country's pop-
ulation has not declined. Because of the
agreeableness of human existence in France,
vast hordes of tourists and sojourners flock
thither to spend lavishly. Because of the rare
artistic feeling put into manufactured articles,
France maintains an immense export trade
despite all the hostile efforts of rival nations.
In these ways taste is minted into money.

Barring the absenteeism of the "exposed"
and the idle, we are as yet in no danger from
emigration; our problem is immigration, and
it is a problem because only the lower classes
of Europeans come in large numbers to America.
The upper classes avoid us. They have no
ambition to settle here, extremely little ambi-
tion to travel here; and this is largely because
we have in many respects made American life
disagreeable-causing our surroundings to rob
us of the comfort and convenience and artistic
satisfaction so common in Europe and so
profitable.

Look, for instance, at our business streets.
When an American, a patriotic American, an
American who wants to see his country surpass
the most admirable achievements of the Old
World, comes home from France and again
threads the commercial thoroughfares that
correspond to the Grand Boulevards of Paris,
he gets a curious shock of disappointment.
The stately buildings are here, looking fully
as grand as before his European rovings;
perhaps a dozen new ones have risen up in his
absence-and he is proud of their architec-
tural magnificence; but still he feels a strange
sense of something missing, something the
French city possesses and the American city
hasn't yet attained. What is that something?
Fine rows of trees in the down-town streets.

People talk as if trees would not grow in a
business street, and certainly they will not and
do not, treated as we treat them. If you were

a tree, and the sidewalk shut away the water
from your roots as it docs over here-you
would swear a few arboreal oaths, struggle for
life a year or so, and then wither and die. If,
however, your trunk were encircled by a huge,
round grating, like a church register six feet
across, the moisture would keep you lusty.
It is by this simple arrangement, chiefly, that
the Grand Boulevards maintain their wealth
of greenery.

Another thing the returned traveler misses
is flowers. Where are the floral embellish-
ments for theatre fronts, restaurants, and
shops-the urns, the window-boxes, the gor-
geous hanging baskets? A society in Paris
offers prizes for the handsomest flowered bal-
conies. When a tradesman wants to make
his establishment conspicuous, he dresses it
up in the gayest blossoms obtainable.

And yet a commercial thoroughfare wants
something more than adornment; it also de-
mands the removal-or at least the mitigation
-of disfigurements. In Paris, the telegraph
pole is a thing unknown. So, in general, is
the trolley-pole. And advertising-that gravest
menace to municipal beauty-shrinks to its
lowest terms. Instead of letting the bill-
poster cover an enormous flat surface, as we
do, the French roll the flat surface up into a
cylinder, thus producing what they call the
advertising pillar. In this way they reduce its
diameter by more than half, while the pillar
itself has a decorative canopy top, within which
a ring of lights gleams prettily at night and
illumines the posters. Equally ingenious is
the six-sided kiosk, quite picturesque in out-
line and fitted with panels of translucent glass
carrying advertisements. The kiosk becomes
a tool-house for street-cleaners' brooms and
shovels, and after dark it is lighted from within.

But it is in restraining the hideous atrocities
of the elevated railway that the French display
their finest originality. The Parisian "El"
avoids the noblest streets, yet even there it
would be infinitely less a curse than its Amer-
can prototype. It has ornamental stone pil-
lars and, wherever possible, a screen of foliage
on either side so that you seem almost to be
spinning through a forest as you ride.

All such mitigations of ugliness, as well as
the manifold intelligent efforts at embellish-
ment, Paris owes in a great measure to its
artists. The French do not regard an artist
as a sentimental madman: they respect him
and get work out of him. When war is
