better adjustment of our great educational
machinery to contemporaneous life and to
its multiform activities. It is significant, too,
that the Presidents of Yale, of Princeton, of the
University of Chicago, of Williams and of many
other colleges and universities are men trained
in the groups of studies classed under History
and Economics. It is these upon which the
activity of our time puts the greatest emphasis.

THE DIFFICULTY OF MOVING MEN

HIS is surely an extraordinary condition:
The stream of immigrants to the United
States is larger than it ever was before; the
demand for workers of every grade of labor
is more general than it ever was before; in
spite of the considerable movement of new-
comers to the Southwest and in much smaller
numbers to the South, the demand there is
not supplied; and meanwhile the slums of
New York and presumably of other large cities
become worse crowded than ever.
, With the ease and cheapness of transporta-
tion and with all our facilities for making the
wants of one region known in every other
region, we do not seem to be able to distribute
our population quickly in accordance with
economic demands. In the long run such a
distribution no doubt does take place, but it
does not seem to take place with organized
intelligence, certainly not with swiftness.

But certain agencies for sending settlers to
the South and to the Southwest are succeeding
in a measure. But any one who sees the
abnormal crowding of parts of New York,
Contrary to all sound laws of economics and of
health, must wonder at the still imperfect con-
trol that we have acquired over the habits and
tendencies of ignorant masses.

GOVERNMENT BY KNOWLEDGE, OR BY FITS?

b HE proposition is a Sound one, that the
good conduct of departmental govern-
ment, like the good conduct of private business,
or for that matter like the good conduct of

life in general, must rest not on fitful emotional
impulses, but on a thorough knowledge at every
step of what is done. There is nothing novel
in this proposition. But, if we should apply
it to city government, we should make the first
long step away from government by fits and
starts.

As things usually are, the mass of citizens
are ignorant of their city government. If it
be reasonably well conducted, all right. If it
be badly conducted, its badness goes on till
it becomes worse, there is a scandal, the public
conscience is aroused, and at the next election
the people proceed to turn the rascals out-for
a time.

Mr. William H. Allen's plea in this number
of THE WORLD'S WORK is for such work as
the Bureau of Municipal Research is per-
forming in New York. It is expert accountants'
work (and something more) applied to the
city departments, about the financial conduct
of which the body of citizens knows notlr
ing.

When a bureau of such research has done its
work, the next step is to inform the public of
the results and to convince them of its value.
Unlt ss a great scandal is exposed, it is hard to
reach the public attention.

To reach the public attention with anything
of normal (and not sensational) interest is the
most difficult of all tasks in a de, nccracs.
Disease could be abolished, the L triff could
be reformed, bad food would ceaSL, be sold,
the tenements might all be torn down, children
could be properly taught-great Heavens!
we could begin a very respectable Utopia
within a week if there were any way to teach
the mass of the people only a dozen or two fun-
damental well-ascertained, often-demonstrated
facts.

Nevertheless, a bureau of any sort of research
is a good thing whenever and wherever applied;
and if the citizens of New York or any other
city really wish to know how their government
is conducted, this is the way to find it out.

HOW TO INVEST SMALL FUNDS

' NE of the most difficult tasks that falls
to the lot of the conscientious broker
or banker is the giving of advice to

those who have to invest small sums of money

for helpless and unskilled investors. It is a
task that calls for honesty, caution, and ex-
treme resourcefulness. In nine cases out of
ten, it is necessary that the investment should
