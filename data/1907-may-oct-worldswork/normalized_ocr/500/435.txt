CAN HUMAN LIFE

these wonderful adaptations to an end could be explained
in a very simple way. Young caterpillars, for example,
will follow the light, so long as they are hungry. If they
find no food, they will keep on climbing, conceivably until
they die. When they are cold, they will not move. When
the warm sun comes up in the spring, they begin to crawl
upward. All that is needful to assume is that in the
hungry condition the light sets up certain chemical reactions
which cause the animal to move, just as it sets up a reaction
in a photographic plate, or explodes a mixture of hydrogen
and chlorine gas. Certain chemical stimuli from meat
cause a fly to lay its eggs. In the fat these stimuli are
lacking. They can be produced artificially."

In short, if the influences of light, heat, acids,
alkalies, pressure, gravity, electricity, etc., can
be rightly applied, not only can the actions of
living creatures be varied and directed, but
their protoplasmic or cellular formations and
growths can be more or less controlled, for they
are all working under similar forces. And
so are the vast majority of the actions uncon-
sciously occurring in our bodies. Our conscious
intellects can control many functions, yet have
no glimmering sense of the extensive chemical
stimuli, responses, and consequent alterations
which compose the field of cellular growth and
nutrition in our bodies. We are familiar with
the h1arvelous variations in flowers, fruits, and
vegetables, accomplished artificially by Bur-
bank and others. Many equally interesting
"controls" have been accomplished in the
animal kingdom. Two classes of such controls
especially interest the public: reproduction
independent of the male, and checking the
processes which bring decay and death to the
adult. We might add a third: reversing the
trend of physical life, by which one would
"grow" from age to youth.

In all the higher forms of the animal king-
dom, reproduction can only follow fertilization
of the ovum, or female cell, by the generative
cell of the male. Immediately following such
fertilization, the ovum cell begins to divide
into halves, each half possessing all the ele-
ments of the original cell. These two each
divide, and the division goes on until millions
of such cells have grown from the parent cell
into an organized structure-the embryo.
Reproduction is not always dependent upon
fertilization by a male cell, however; many of
the lower classes of animal life possess both
male and female elements within themselves.

Consequently, Dr. Loeb, by altering the
conditions of the sea water in which sea-
urchins were placed, whereby they were led
to mature their eggs without fertilization by

the males, did not demonstrate a new

method of reproduction; but he did interfere
with the normal method in the case of sea-
urchins. What he actually proved was, that
fertilization of the sea-urchin':; eggs is largely
due, not to some mysterious "vital force"
existing solely in the male cell, but to chemical
stimulation, or action of ferments, which can
be generated artificially. Placing unfertilized
sea-urchin eggs in sea water, he found that an
addition of chloride of magnesium caused a
number of the eggs to develop, but not to such
an extent that these fatherless larvae of sea-
urchins could reproduce their kind.

Dr. Loeb's discovery is of deep significance
in shaping our conceptions of vital processes;
he has discovered a basic principle that upsets
our ancient views of life, but it is a far cry to
the day when masculinity need tremble lest it
become dethroned. The invention of a
spinet limited to one taut wire, a hammer, and
a key, would justify the prediction of a concert
grand piano, but Dr. Loeb's sea-urchin victory
advanced to the control of human reproduction
by such laboratory means would require
millions of added intricacies. No escutcheon
will ever be emblazoned with a pinch of salt
and an incubator. No microscope can pierce
so deep into the delicacy of detail in the repro-
ductive cell as to reach its limit. In the human
race the male cell is I-f? 5,000 of an inch wide,
and yet the adult product of its coalescence-the
child-will resemble the father. Out of a cell
so small that thousands of them could herd
within the confines of a single drop of dew,
spring the little traits of character of the father
-his smile, his gait, his way of thinking, his
physique, the gathered individualities of his
ancestry-which shape and constrain, modify
and define, the lines of this man in the making.
Search through the world of wonders and you
will find no more impressive phenomenon than
this. It gives a keener appreciation of the
meaning of atoms and molecules, millions of
which abide in every cell.

The life process is discovered. It is electro-.
chemical, and the delicacy of detail in con-
struction of the wonder cell of reproduction
has followed the same influences in varied
characteristicsas applies in producing all the
varied forms, colors, sizes, and individualisms
of full-grown animals. Heat will alter the
color of the rabbit's hair, of the butterfly, and
the chameleon; light will redden the apple, tan
man's skin; arsenic at the roots will dye green
