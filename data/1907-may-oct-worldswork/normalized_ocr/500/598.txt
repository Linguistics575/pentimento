9396 THE
parts of the white man's world that are now
overcrowded.

The reasons for the continued flow at high-
tide of people to the United States are the
obvious reasons of higher wages, cheaper lands,
the encouragement of kinspeople and friends
who have previously come here, and especially
the activity of the steamship lines in seeking
emigrant traflic. Most European countries
have laws forbidding the solicitation of emi-
grants; but, in spite of these laws, the trans-
Atlantic lines have a thoroughly organized
system of drumming them up.

The westward migration to our continent,
which, by the way, is the largest movement of
population in the history of the human race,
will go on for many years, till there will be
parts of Europe that will need immigrants more
than we shall need them. All the while, too,
the shipment of money by immigrants here to
their kinspeople in the old countries will increase
even over its present vast total of millions a
year; and the money spent in Europe by
travelling Americans will increase with our
prosperity. In these ways the Old World will
continue to levy its tax on us, and working
conditions in Europe will continue to improve
as men become relatively fewer there in pro-
portion to the demand for them. Thus, it is
pleasant to think, the wheat-fields of the
Northwest and the cotton-fields of the South-
west lift the level of life in all the white man's
world.

Meantime the crowded areas of Asia have
no such lands for relief. No country held by
Europeans welcomes Asiatic immigrants; and
no such relief from overcrowding and from
poverty in India, China, and Japan is ap-
parent as the North American continent
affords during these centuries to the densely
settled parts of Europe. The problem of
Asiatic emigration and economic upbuild-
ing is one of the most serious that lies before
mankind.

ECHOES FROM THE HAGUE

REAT Britain's proposal to the Hague
Conference that armaments be limited,
and military expenditures thereby reduced,
received only indifferent support. But it is
surely a long step in the right direction when
the British Government----) Mistress of the
Seas'u-announces that it is willing once a year
to exchange plans for new battleships with
any other Power likeminded.

MARCH

OF EVENTS

The chief opposition came from Russia.
M. Nelidoff, the president of the Conference,
declared the proposition to be tt immature," and
explained how harmful to the interests of peace
a discussion would be. Yet the Czar's main
object in calling the Conference of 1899 was the
very measure that his representative calls
"immature." But, then, the Czar's battle-
ships had not gone out of commission in the
Sea of Japan. When his fleet shall have been
replaced with new ships, the Russian delega-
tion may find the limitation of armaments to
have approached maturity.

However, there is no real reason for anybody
to worry over new battleships, larger pro-
jectiles, and more powerful explosives. All
human experience proves that a strong fighting
force is a most convincing argument in favor of
arbitration at a time when diplomatic relations
are out of joint. The peace of Japan is much
more secure since the performances of Admiral
Togo's squadron; and the marksmanship
records of the United States Navy are stronger
guarantee of our own quietude than all the
resolutions adopted at The Hague. The mere
knowledge that we possess the secret of dunnite
---an explosive more powerful even than that
which turned victory to Japan-will outweigh
the oratory of many diplomats.

At any rate, the action of the Conference is
no bar to limitation of military expenditure
through treaties. At the close of M. Nelidoff's
long speech explaining the immaturity of
England's proposal, the Conference heard read
a treaty between Argentina and Chile by which
each nation will reduce its fighting force.

II

General Porter deserves the thanks of all
peace-loving men for a sensible suggestion in
the course of the discussion on compulsory
arbitration. Germany had taken the lead of
half a dozen states in opposing this measure,
on the ground that questions of national honor
might be involved. Thereupon, General Porter
submitted a long list of topics---such as customs
regulations, copyright laws, relations between
companies and employees-and asked that the
Conference declare that these subjects do not
involve G national honor." If this be not agreed
to, he suggests that individual nations take the
matter up and agree on as many items as
possible. Arbitration of disputes on such
questions shall then be compulsory so far as
the nations so agreeing are concerned. If his
