THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD

THE OLDEST INDUSTRY OF MANKIND

BY

AGNES C. LAUT

this fur-hunting and fur-trading. The
cave man, who slew a beast with a
stone spear that he might take the pelt for
his own covering, was the world's first manu-
facturer. And it is an industry on which no
trust, no monopoly, can lay a stifling hand.
The wayside vagabond, wandering in the
wood with his gun, could upset the biggest
trust by throwing his furs on the market at an
independent price. And it is an industry that
has led to the pathiinding of half the world.
Not glory in the abstract, but the little beaver,
led discoverers from the St. Lawrence to the
Mississippi and from the Mississippi to the
Rockies. Likewise it was the little sable that
led the Cossacks across what is now Russia,
from the Ural Mountains to Kamchatka; and
it was the big sea otter that led Russians,
Americans, Spaniards, and Englishmen around
the world in crazy boats to the exploration of
Western America, from Alaska to California.
Just when these fur traders began to com-
bine into the great companies I do not know.
The Skinners Company of London dates from
the 1300's. Russian traders had begun to
hold their great fairs by the 1400's; and from
the time Canada was discovered in 1535, its
history was a continuous succession of dif-
ferent French fur companies to 17 59. Danes
had their Copenhagen furriers hunting Green-
land and Spitzbergen before Henry Hudson
had found the harbor of New York. The
Dutch West India Company's men sought furs
almost as diligently as spices and broke the
heads of rivals over a pelt as readily as Spaniards
spit an enemy for a doubloon. The great
Hudson's Bay Company of the Canadian
Northwest came into existence in 1670.
Those companies whose operations were
really the pioneer history of Western America
--the Northwest Company of Montreal, the
Russian-American Company of the Pacific
Coast otter hunters, Astor's three companies

IT IS the oldest industry in the world,

(the Mackinaw, the Pacific, the American, rang-
ing the Western States), and the two great com-
panies operating from St. Louis, the Rocky
Mountain and Missouri-nearly all came into
existence just before the 1800's and had run
their course before 1840.

This does not mean that the furs of America
are exhausted. On the contrary, the fur trade
of America is greater to-day than ever before
in its history. The Hudson's Bay Company
now sells more furs than in the days when it
held monopoly over all Canada except New
France, and this in spite of the fact that it is
now opposed by a French company as power-
ful as itself, which does as big a volume of
business-mot to mention hosts of lesser com-
panies that support free traders on the
field and buy by mail. It will astonish most
readers to be told that, on the American side
of the line, the volume of the fur trade is the
largest ever known in the United States-
greater than in the days when the buffalo and
beaver had the whole continent as a stamping-
ground. Buffalo as a fur yielder has been
exterminated. Beaver in the most of the
states is practically extinct. Sea otter, from
yielding 100,000 pelts a year now give at the
most only 400, at the least 200 for the trade;
and the fur seal is on the way to extermination,
falling from 100,000 a year to 10,000 and
14,000. But other furs have taken their place.

"What fur would you say yields the biggest
crop in America?" I asked one of the famous
buyers. "Mink or beaver?"

"Neither," he answered. "It will seem
absurd; but there is more money going to
trappers to-day for skunk and muskrat and fox
than was ever made out of beaver and sea otter
and seal and the rare furs. Why, the swamps
of New Jersey and Delaware alone yield mil-
lions of muskrats a year."

"How many millions?"

"I wouldn't like to say: different for dif-
ferent years; highest when there hasn't been
