But to his family secrets. Let us start with
a basket of mosquito eggs. There are from
200 to 400 deposited by a mother mosquito at a
single laying. These eggs are about one-
sixteenth of an inch long, dark in shade, and
at the larger end having a sort of bottle-mouth,
which is sealed with a thin delicate membrane.
Out of this stoppered orifice will emerge the
larva or "wriggler" when hatching time ar-
rives. The eggs have remarkable endurance.
They can remain in cold-storage all winter and
hatch out in the balmy days of spring. Even
the mother-hen mosquito, with developing
batch of eggs, can spend the winter in a cake
of ice and go a-laying in the thawing days of
March.

(A) Water surface, with pupae getting air. (B) Top surface of
the water. (D) Two pupae just hatching. (F) A mosquito climbing
the side of the glass vessel

when his baby eyes first greet the light of the
sun. So the eggs must be laid on water.
Some mosquito families have advanced the
science of reproduction to the highest notch
and render the first steps in a larva's debut
easy; the entire batch of eggs is stacked up
like a lot of ten-pins, side by side, with the
large ends next the water. T hese eggs, all
glued together in the stacking, will then float
like the leaf of the water-lily on the water's
face.

This is called an egg-boat. For a couple of
days this lying-in house-boat will drift aim-
lessly at the mercy of wind and tide like a
derelict on the much-salted seas-its destiny
in the hands of chance. And if, through the
