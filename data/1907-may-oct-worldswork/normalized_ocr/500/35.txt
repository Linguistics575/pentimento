GOVERNOR HUGHES-tIE

but without any visible effort. His desk was
piled high with works of fiction, for his curious
and restless mind was reaching out into sym-
pathetic relations with all sorts and conditions
of men. To-day his library is crowded with
the writings of Darwin, Tyndall, Spencer,
and Huxley, and the novels have gone by the
board. Both the fiction and the science he
devoured for the same reason-his desire to
understand and interpret the dominant im-,
pulses and achievements of his own age.

From college he passed into a year or two
of teaching, then into the law school, then into
a law office. A few years later came the pro-
fessor's chair at Cornell, where he gained a
singular and memorable hold on the students
in the law school; and from teaching he re-
turned to his practice in New York. From
the first day in the law school to the time of his
election as Governor, he has lived a life of
unremitting toil and steady climbing. There
has been no happy chance in his career. Cir-
cumstances have usually been against him---
sometimes cruelly so. Again and again he
would have broken down through over-strain,
were it not for the long summers in Switzer-
land, spent in tramping unfrequented roads
or climbing, famous peaks. It is amusing to
hear men talk of "the remarkable opportunity
that came to Mr. Hughes," in the gas and the
insurance investigations. It may well be
doubted whether any other man in the country
would have proved so clearly adequate to the
opportunity which those investigations de-
veloped. And he was adequate, not because
he was born so, but because behind every
probing inquiry addressed to reluctant witnesses
lay twenty-five years of self-discipline, con-
centrated toil, and mastery of problems touch-
ing every field of human endeavor.

As Governor of New York, Mr. Hughes
standsout a distinct and vivid figure in the
national consciousness. There is no mystery
about him, no luck at the foundation of his
success, no halo around his head; but there
are certain very dcfinite qualities in his per-
sonality.

The most obvious of these is his analytic
power and habit. To hear him speak is to
see a splendid exhibition of intellect in action.
It is like watching the play of a powerful and
noiseless engine, with all the parts in perfect
working order. He thinks upon his feet. He
has no inclination for rhetorical devices, he
cuts out introduction and peroration and

ornament, and goes straight to the heart of the
fact. He speaks with great deliberation, but
---since his political campaign-with great
physical energy. The dominant impression
is one of lucidity, common sense, and un-
swerving conviction. He tears off the husk
and speedily reaches the kernel. He pours
over every subject the light of intelligence.
He has rare power of calm, logical exposition.
His mind naturally seeks for principles behind
phenomena, for causes behind effects. What-
ever subject he is expounding, he must analyze
it to the core. Only when he has reached a
central point of view is he willing to talk at all.

HIS RARE SELF-CONTROL

This life-long habit of analysis has given
him a rare self-control and equanimity in the
presence of novel and unexpected developments.
The word which most nearly describes him is
"well-poised." In speaking, all his sentences
are the unfolding of one thesis; in action,
all his deeds are part of one deliberately chosen
policy. Both President Roosevelt and Gov-
ernor Hughes have been misjudged, and for
similar reasons. Because Mr. Roosevelt is
swift in physical action, he has been called
"impulsive"; and because Mr. Hughes is
deliberate and dignified in physical movement,
he has been pronounced "academic." The
President's long deliberation over his policies
is gradually being recognized by the nation;
and when the people understand Mr. Hughes,
they will recognize in him one of the swiftest
minds and most intense natures now in public
life. But his long legal training and natural
poise make it impossible to catch him off his
guard. He may be mistaken or wrong; but
he will never leap before he looks. He is not
to be cajoled or misled by sophistry or chicanery.
He is under no illusion as to fame or power.
He understands his position and possibilities
better than any one else understands them.
There is no desire to conceal realities from
himself or from the public. He views all
problems in the clear and steady light of truth.

This native impartiality and fairmindedness
give him necessarily great breadth of intel-
lectual and moral sympathy. His calendar
of public engagements for six weeks shows him
attending every sort of function, from the
Purim ball to the dedication of a new building
at Cornell University. The study of law is
his first concern, and always will be. But in
education he has been profoundly interested,
