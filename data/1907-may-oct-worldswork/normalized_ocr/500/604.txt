securities which could be turned into immediate
cash was the thing that he most prized.

The New York merchant told the story to his
partners and suggested that they put aside from
the business an amount equal to IO per cent. of
the pay-roll each week and invest it in first-
class securities.

Said one partner: "Why tie up in securities
yielding, say, 5 per cent., money which if em-
ployed in our active business will yield 20 or 30
per cent.?"

The answer came quickly: "Why pay in-
surance when the money thus spent would yield
more gain in trading? There should be a
financial insurance begun and carried on in
good times to guard against sudden emergencies.
Most men of long experience have walked the
floor in times of tight money. Many men have
done it every week when the pay-roll hung over
a depleted bank-account. Having passed
through this experience once, few men like to
contemplate a second term of similar trials.

"Beside, walking the floor kills initiative and
power in every other direction. The Chicago
man's plan draws the kind of sharp distinction
between brick and.mortar assets and market-
able securities that we need to think about now
and then. In a young business, any sort of
asset must answer; as a business grows older,
it is worth while to protect its improved con-
dition and to have at least enough of the market-
able kind of assets to help through a tight place.

"Another valuable feature of the plan is that
it leads to saving instead of spending, a virtue
as valuable for a business house as for an in-
dividual."

Said another partner: "But this money
might be used in enlarging the output of the
house."

Replied the first: "To which I answer that
IO per cent. of the pay-roll-or s per cent., or
2 per cent., if you like-invested in securities
will not seriously retard the development of a
firm; if a house crowds in its earnings as fast as
that, it needs this reserve all the more. It needs
to check a headlong flight of business frenzy."

"But suppose the bonds go down?"

"Suppose they do? They are locked in your
safe; they pay their interest----) pure profit.
We need not worry. There is only one sure
way to make money in Wall Street: never sell
at a loss. If worst comes to worst-und prob-
ably worst won't come to worst-this very habit
leads to caution; the bonds can be borrowed on
when credit is strained,"

WHY NOT BUSINESS INSURANCE?

The things here related happened about five
years ago. In the case of the New York man,
there was an interesting sequel.

The firm prospered as most firms have done
in the last five years. The money was regularly
sent to the brokers in weekly instalments. Most
of the bonds purchased were in from $ 3,000 to
$ 5,000 lots, but paid for at the rate of $ 200
a week. In all cases, high-class securities were
chosen. When one lot was paid for, it was
turned over to the firm, registered, and locked
up, and payment on a new lot begun. In the
five years the prices of bonds varied not very
greatly. Occasionally the banker advised the
change of one security for another, but this was
always done at a profit. The New York man
remembered Baron Rothschild's reply to the
question, How did you make your fortune?
"By never buying at the bottom or selling at the
top."

The statements of the firm in which these
securities were listed as part of its assets always
attracted the favorable and somewhat surprised
attention of the banks where the firm kept its
account.

In the last summer (of this year), this New
York house needed for a proper business oppor-
tunity a larger line of discount than usual, ex-
actly at the time when banks looked askance at
any increase of accommodation, no matter how
good the borrower. A competitor's difficulty in
getting ready money had given the opportunity
of which the house wished to avail itself.

The bank president was, with many apologies
and explanations, disposed to decline to extend
the line of discount.

"Very well," said the merchant, "Pll go to
my brokers and borrow on my bonds; if I can't
rely on you for money when I most need it, I
must get it elsewhere."

Naturally, the bank president didn't let him
go to the broker; there is too great a demand
for good accounts in these days of competition.

From the banker's point of view, the plan has
many advantages. Not only is an additional
safeguard thrown about his risk, but any class
of good investment security which shall be
taken out of Wall Street and locked up in the
safes of conservative business men makes for
stability and strength.

The man from New York has never' eased to
thank his Chicago friend for starting the busi-
ness insurance idea in his mind, and this story
is written in the hope that its telling may sug-
gest to other business men to go and do likewise,
