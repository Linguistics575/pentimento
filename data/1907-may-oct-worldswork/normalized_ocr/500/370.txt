confidence must first of all make himself
worthy of that confidence.

From the citizen, little need at once be
expected; for in the nature of things a huge
mass of people must be led. No man who
understands the American people will doubt
that they will quickly follow, when they see
that the men whom they are to follow are honest,
robust, and strong. Especially is this true
when one reflects that the goal at which they
aim is their own profit.

Then, what of the third party, the man with
the money? Can anyone doubt that he will
be ready to do his duty just as soon as the other
two reach an understanding? Is it so soon
forgotten that the foreign capitalists supplied
nearly half the money that was needed to build
our great railways in the first place? No one
can doubt that Europe will do again, if need be,
what it has done before. It needs only the
basis of confidence. There was a recent most
interesting article on American railways in the
London Statist. That paper, which is an
authority, declares that England is ready and
eager to supply the money needed by the
American railroads. English investors wait
a few more signs that the people-that is the
government-do nor intend to destroy the rail-
roads nor to cripple them. They hail with
delight the moderate Jamestown address by
President Roosevelt, and the veto of the two-
cent fare bill in New York by Governor Hughes.
They take the former to indicate the Federal
attitude, and the latter to prove that in the
State Governments there still exists enough
strength to over-rule the fanaticism of the pro-
fessional anti-corporation legislator.

THE AVERAGE MAN AND PRESENT CONDITIONS

HIS is a prosperous country. Its people

are rich, and they are living well.

The average well-informed man thinks that this

condition of prosperity will continue at least

for another twelve-month. He thinks that

perhaps the presidential year will bring some

falling off of the full current, but he does not

dream that this disturbance will affect his
personal fortunes.

Yet, here and there, one may find incidents
that afford some food for reflection. One
hears, for instance, that the great telephone
supply company has laid off three thousand
employees because the telephone companies
are unable to raise money to pay their
debts and to carry on new work of con-

struction. A great steel firm in New York
City goes into bankruptcy because it cannot
borrow money to carry on its business. Every
train into New York, St. Louis, and Chicago
a month or so ago brought home commercial
travelers who had cut short their trips because
business was too slow.

These are little things, noted in special
industries and trades. If the same thing were
going on in every industry and trade at the same
moment it would not be necessary to ask any
question about the prosperity of the country.
As it is, a question arises, but that is all. In
last December a few of the railroads began to
stop their extensions. Later, a few industrial
companies began slowly to cut doin their
tt bills payable," and to build up a cash reserve
to meet anything that might happen to come
in the spring. Even more slowly, the individ-
ual tradesman, or manufacturer, has begun
to follow the same policy. It is, therefore,
a time for the average man who is a consumer,
whether he be a producer or not, to take heed
of these things.

For the average man is generally the last
man to see changing financial conditions. He
begins to cut down his working expenses only
after half the men in his department have been
dismissed, and when dismissal is hanging over
his own head. In fact, the merchant who
begins to cut down his office and store expenses
in January seldom begins to economize at home
in the same month. His living expense has
probably advanced, rather than decreased, as
the uncertainty has increased in business circles.
While, therefore, the average man need not
be alarmed, his condition is at least worthy of
his close attention.

SAVINGS BANK LIFE INSURANCE

HE issue of insurance policies for amounts

less than a thousand dollars with pre-
miums payable in weekly or monthly instal-
ments is known as "Industrial Insurance" and
is limited to a few companies. The cost of this
form of insurance is enormous. Out of every
dollar that policy-holders pay in, they receive
back less than a third. The cost of soliciting
and management is forty to fifty cents out of
every dollar-more than twice the cost of the
conduct of standard insurance. The reason
for this great economic waste lies in the system
itself. It is a bad system, because a high per-
centage of cost is unavoidable where solicitors
are paid commissions for collecting nickels and
