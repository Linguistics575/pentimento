heating at the 5-eent rate was found too expen-
sive. The general domestic use of electricity
is a new thing. The electrical companies have
not, until lately, manufactured cooking and
heating appliances or encouraged the use of
small motors. A certain timidity and great
ignorance on the part of the public still retards
their general adoption. Moreover, it is only
lately that electric power has been generally
for sale, even in the largest of our cities.

To the people who employ servants, the
adoption of electricity will mean more comfort
and luxury; they will therefore be the first to
adopt it, for such improvements pass through
the hands of the luxurious before they reach

an electric motor; good lights, with no lamps
to fill; and a small vacuum cleaner run by
electricity replaces the broom. A cleaner
house and better food in half the time! The
sewing-machine is run by electricity and the
incubator in the cellar is heated at an even
temperature in the same way. The tank on
the top of the house is filled by an electrically
run pump and there is running water in the
house. The woman who lives in this house
has not the dull, tired look which we see
so often now.
