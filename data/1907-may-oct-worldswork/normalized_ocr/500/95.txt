IS THE DOCTOR A SHYLOCK?

he were to be paid for all-or most-of the
professional visits he makes, he could afford
to cut his prices in two; but the ethics of his
calling demand that he respond to every ring
of his bell, however hopeless the prospect of
compensation. The reputable physician who
would demand financial references before
putting his finger on the pulse is as rare as the
steamboat captain who deserts his passengers
when the ship strikes-and shares the same
odium. He would be forced out of the ranks
of any reputable medical society in America.
That he should not patent nor conceal any
new formula whose merits he discovers; that
he should give to his profession the rights to
all instruments he may invent, or improve;
that he should leave his family or his bed at
any hour at the call of any man; that he should
risk his own life and that of his children when-
ever an epidemic breaks out-all this and
more is accepted by the public as a matter of
course. His is a thankless task, for the doctor
has no press-agent. The only member of the
community who realizes the extent of his public
service and the smallness of his recompense is
the doctor's wife.

I recall a certain medical student who in his
senior year took charge of an obstetrical case
"for practice." The patient was a poor
Negro woman living in a tumble-down shanty
on a disreputable street. The student was
careful to secure from his professor a promise
that he would respond to his aid when needed.
One night the call came unexpectedly and the
student rushed for the telephone. The pro-
fessor's wife answered that the doctor was out
of the city. Beads of perspiration burst out
on the young man's brow and he worked his
thinking apparatus quickly and hard. He
could recall but one other, and for him he
called with the haste of a man turning in a
fire-alarm. To his great joy, the second doctor
answered-but said that his wife had that hour
returned from an absence of several weeks and
would leave again the following morning.
But when the student explained the situation,
the doctor left his fireside and sat with the
student in that poor woman's hovel until
nearly daylight the following morning. But
he did not do it "for practice!"

And if such a physician be called from the
bedside of a patient whom he has perhaps
visited for weeks without the prospect of a
single dollar, to attend a millionaire with an
aching stomach, he regards it as only the

8893

capitalist's duty to society that his check should
balance the poor devil's account also.

MEDICAL INCOMES IN NEW YORK CITY

What are the real facts about medical in-
comes of to-day? In the effort to reach an
honest answer, we must differentiate between
the New York specialist, the average American
specialist, the average successful practitioner,
and the country doctor, at least.

The New York specialist receives the largest
fees in the country and the most of them, for
two reasons. Here are found a few physicians
of exceptional reputation and hither gravitate
the country's wealthiest patients. Those who
have not come to New York to live, come now
and then for consultation. While figures that
can be relied upon are not easily obtained, there
are doubtless a number of specialists on Man-
hattan Island whose incomes run above
$ 100,000 a year. It is easy to imagine that
those who attend New York's great magnates
receive large fees and that their prestige attracts
many other wealthy patients. These belong
in a class to themselves and are representative
neither of the American specialist nor of the
average specialist of New York City.

The largest fees, quite naturally, are charged
for surgical work; the operation for appen-
dicitis is a familiar example. The customary
New York charge was brought out some months
ago in the published letters that passed be-
tween the surgeon and the mother of a wealthy
patient. The case was one of gangrenous
appendicitis, "with impending disaster"; the
surgeon went twenty miles from the city to
operate, and saved the patient. He sent a bill
for $ 1,080; the mother sent a check for $ 600
and a friendly letter saying that she had found
$ 500 to be the customary fee in the city.
The surgeon replied that it was pretty well
known that he never undertook the responsi-
bilities of an abdominal operation for less than
$ 31,000, that in some such cases his fee had
been several times that amount, but that he
would submit the correspondence to three
other surgeons. All of them endorsed the
charge as reasonable and one specifically stated
that in all abdominal operations he also charged
$ 1,000, or more. These charges, it seems,
are made for services to families well able to
pay. Some patients doubtless pay more;
most undoubtedly pay less-all the way down
to nothing..
