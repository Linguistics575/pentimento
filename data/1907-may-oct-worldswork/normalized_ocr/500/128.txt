THE ERA OF BIG-CITY BUILDING

This view of Peachtree Street in Atlanta indicates the coming of the large-city stage of Southern development,
in one generation after the industrial emancipation of the people. Most of the business leaders came as poor boys
from the farms or small villages; for the growing wealth of the Southern cities is the result of native endeavor,
mainly of men who began in poverty.
