and of the newspapers which echo them. Our
politicians take their cue from the shoutings of
the mob and misrepresent us on this question.
A false impression has grown up in the East
with regard to the real attitude of Oregon and
California toward the Oriental problem.

The considerations that lead many intelligent
people to favor Chinese and Japanese immi-
gration are these:

First, there is an utter absence on the Coast
of any native-born or American white day-
laboring class below the artisan or skilled
I have never yet met on this coast
an American white man who was willing to
regard himself as a day-laborer by profession,
who expected to pass his life in that capacity.
American laborers are too intelligent and too
ambitious for that. The native-born men and
boys who cultivate our ranches, pick our fruit,
build our railroads, and man our lumber crews,
are simply "working for a stake." As soon as
they have earned one or two hundred dollars, off
they go to the mines, the fisheries, the timber
and homestead claims, to set up for themselves.
They are the finest labor on earth, as long as
you can hold them, but the moment they have
"made their stake" they leave. A new find at
Bullfrog, Tonopah, or Rhyolite will empty the
bunk-houses in a week.

There is only a small supply of Italians,
Poles, Hungarians, and Russians. These im-
migrants come by way of New York and stop
off along the whole breadth of the continent,
so the handful which reaches us is wholly
inadequate for our needs.

Moreover, we prefer the Chinese to any of
these or to the Mexicans with their dirt, laziness,
and stupidity. The Chinaman is the most
industrious worker that walks the earth in hw.
man form. He doesn't seem to know how to get
tired. All you need to do is to show him what
he has to do, and set him at it; he will stay by
it as long as he can see to work, seven days out
of the week. There is something positively
uncanny about his affection for work. No
class of white men will work with the unremit-
ting persistency of the Chinese. The Japanese
is more human. He will quit of his own accord
occasionally, but he also is a tireless, cheerful
worker.

Besides, the Chinaman is absolutely trust-
worthy. If he says that he will work for a
month, you can depend on getting thirty days
of labor out of him with a certainty equaled by
few other things on this planet. If he falls sick,

he promptly provides a countryman to do his
work and to take care of him in the intervals, if
you will allow him to remain where he is; if
not, he goes to the hospital. He may quarrel
with you, yet he will not quit his job. He will
take it out in gcsticulations and Oriental "cuss-
words" until you can get another man in his
place. You may even have difficulty in dis-
charging him for cause until his time is up.

The Japanese is not quite so reliable in this
respect. He will sometimes leave without a
word of warning, often without any reason that
you can discover. "I like you very much, but
I think I go to-morrow" is all the satisfaction
you can get. However, it is only fair to say
that this form of desertion is not so common
as among white laborers or servants, the only
difference being that the latter grumble before-
hand, threaten to leave, and give various alleged
reasons for their action, while the Jap says
nothing until his mind is made up and then
nothing can change it. He is polite and smiling
but adamant. "Shall I get you new boy?"
is his ultimate word. One of the secrets of his
troublesomeness in this regard is that he is here
for a purpose other than earning money. He
wants to learn a language, a trade, a military
secret, the geography of a town or country.
Till he accomplishes this, he is your most faith-
ful servant; the moment it is done, he goes on
to the next accomplishment. It is significant
that it is the student class of Japanese that gives
most jrouble in this respect. The coolie class
"stays put" quite steadily.

Both races are very particular to get in ad-
vance every detail of the work they are expected
to do, or to get it during the first few days; and
then, if anything vital has been omitted, not an
inch will they go beyond the limits of the original
agreement-not even for more wages-during
that month, or week. At the end of the term
they again become elastic and will consider a
new contract, but a modification of the old
seems a thing unthinkable to them.

The Japanese is also very particular from
whom he takes his orders. "And who my
boss?" is one of his first inquiries after the
preliminaries are settled, and the person speci-
fied is the only one in the family or establish-
ment whose authority he recognizes. He is
polite and obliging to everybody, but no change
in the order or time of his regular duties will he
make except by order of "The Boss."

A third quality that commends both Japan-
ese and Chinese to the people of the Coast is
