WHAT IS A SHOP-GIRL'S LIFE?

charity are intolerable. The endless rules
and regulations, the apparent assumption that
she is by nature immoral and can be pre-
vented from going straight to ruin only by
being hedged about by all sorts of iron-clad
restrictions, are insulting and humiliating to her,
and make the inmates of the "home" (God
save the mark!) both rebellious and unhappy.

These places are cheap and clean and com-
fortable, however; they provide a safe shelter
and decent food at a lower cost than can be
obtained elsewhere, and, uncomfortable and
unhappy as the girls are while living there,
the clubs and homes are always crowded.

Something of the endless demand for cheap
living accommodations for working women
was demonstrated by the rush that was made
for the rooms on the Jacob A. Stamler, Mr.
John Arbuckle's ship, which two years ago lay
at the dock at the foot of Twenty-third Street.
Here, every girl who had a room was supposed
to be self-respecting. No watch was kept
upon her, no iron-clad rules were made; but
every girl was upon her honor to conduct her-
self as she would in her own home. The
experiment proved a most happy and successful
one, but the dock was needed for other vessels,
and the J acob A. Stamler was removed.

GOOD AND CHEAP w0MEN'S HOTELS

Among the latest efforts to house the work-
ing girls at prices which they can afford to
pay are the low-priced women's hotels. Trow-
mart Inn is doing a great deal to solve the
problem for the low-salaried woman, so much,
in fact, that it is not only continually running
at full capacity, but is unable to take care of
one-third of its applicants; it always has a
waiting list of from two to three hundred.
At present it accommodates 248 women,
under thirty years of age, none of whom gets
a salary of more than fifteen dollars a week.

With its clean, well-ventilated, sanitary
rooms, its excellent bathing facilities, its
lavatories and laundry, its roomy parlors and
pleasant library, always open to its guests,
with cozy little private parlors in which the
girls may' entertain particular friends, and
with music and dancing in the evening, and the
companionship of other girls, it supplies to the
average-salaried shop-girl, at $ 4.50 and $ 5
a week for room and board, comforts and
privileges which hitherto have been impossible
to her.

Trowmart Inn is operated on precisely the.

same principles as any other hotel. There
are no set hours for coming in or retiring; no
intimation by word or action that its guests
are "charity girls." The young woman who
makes it her home is as free and independent
as if she were living at the Waldorf or St.
Regis. Young women are permitted to enter-
tain their men friends in the parlors and in the
library, and Saturday evenings they give little
hops to which their men friends are invited.

One of the things that are most appreciated
is the laundry. Few of the girls can afford
to have their laundry work done, and it is a
great help and comfort to them to have access
to a fine, large, well-ventilated laundry room,
where there are tubs, hot water and flat-
irons, and where they may go at any time
to wash out a shirt waist, press a skirt, or do
their regular weekly washing.

WHAT THE SHOP-GIRL GETS OUT OF LIFE

When the shop-girl leaves the store at night
her work is by no means done. She is obliged
to keep herself neat, clean, and respectably
clothed. As she cannot afford to hire her
washing done, or to have her clothes made
and mended, she has a task for every evening.
There are shirtwaists to be laundered, stockings
to darn, a coat to mend, a binding to sew on a
skirt. Her room and bureau drawers have to
be kept in order, letters home must be written,
and in the manifold tasks that she finds to do
when she comes home from work the evening
passes by, and she falls wearily into bed to
sleep the sleep of exhaustion and awake to
another day of toil.

It is the monotony and loneliness of their
lives that is the most trying thing to the girl
workers. Standing behind a counter all day
waiting on bargain-hunting women, they come
home at night, nervous and tired, to be con-
fronted by the problems of food, of clothes,
of rent, of board, of forever providing for the
bare, material necessities of life. There is no
time for higher things.

The shop-girl rises in the morning at six
o'clock, dresses in a hurry, fearing that she may
be late to her work, eats a hasty breakfast,
and hurries away. It may be that a special
sale is on, and all during the forenoon she is
rushed and distracted by a jostling mob of
petulant, unreasonable women.

At noon comes a reprieve of forty-five minutes
during which she eats her luncheon and snatches
what rest she can before the rush and hurry,
