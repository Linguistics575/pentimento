E HUMAN beings are a strange race.
Unless a fact is labeled, we do not

recognize its importance, and if it is
labeled in letters of sufficient size we recognize
it whether it be really important or not. We
shout ourselves hoarse over the relief of a town
that should never have been defended; we
grow hysterical over a cold-bloodecl murderer
until our even more hysterical ministers com-
mute his entirely just punishment. Our per-
spective is entirely wrong. We thrust our-
selves unabashed upon our great men; we
allow our Lttle men to thrust themselves un-
abashed upon ourselves. A man who has
rendered service in his generation to the causes
which our generation represents-and no man
can do more-is, as often as not, allowed to
die neglected and perhaps in poverty. But
thirty years later, up he goes in bronze, though
the work he did, the difficulties he faced, the
ideals he brought down to live on earth, are all
as tinkling brass to the dull aftercomers who,
thanks to him, start where he gave up his work.
The only great work that man can do in this
world is to hand on his torch alight.

LORD CROMER IN EGYPT

Quite quietly and without further trumpet-
ings and salutes than an official eulogy from
those whose servant he has been for four and
twenty yearp---and the usual fifteen-gun salute
as his train steamed out from Cairo-the one
absolute monarch in the world to-day, and
probably the greatest of living benefactors to
his kind, resigned his throne on May 6th.
There is never a crowned head east or west of
Suez which possesses the unconditioned autoc-
racy which Lord Cromer has just laid down.
The circumstances have had no parallel in
modern times; in ancient history the man
himself recalls no prototype. That reserved
man, known to everyone in Cairo and known
by almost none, exercised an influence invisible

and omnipresent without display, without
argument, without appeal.

I remember a new visitor from the United
States who spoke to me under the great bougain-
villca in the garden of the German Church in
the Sharia el-Manakh. He was greatly puzzled
about a notice he had seen that morning.
So far as he could remember, it set out that as it
had seemed good to the Agent (no reason
given) to close half a dozen elementary schools
(of which a list was named), those elementary
schools thereby were and would theneeforward
remain shut.

"Just'shut' and no more about it.
who in is this Agent? I never heard of
such a thing. Just'shut!' It's more like
Genesis than anything I have struck yet."

I explained that the Agent was the British
Consul-General.

"Well," he said, "and what of that? Our
Consul-General Long doesn't go about shutting
up elementary schools. Why, it would be
bad form in an ambassador."

I told him that the British Consul-General
was also Lord Cromer, and his face lightened.

"I thought he was a Viceroy, or something
like that," he explained; and, much comforted,
he took a tram to see real Eastern romance in
the Muski. There has been, since 1883, more
Eastern romance at the Agency than in all the
Cairene bazaars put together. But you have
to be able to see it.

Still, my American's remark seemed in some
ways a happy one. It is because Lord Cromer
has observed the ways of Genesis that he has
been so entirely successful.

Why, one is tempted to ask, has Lord Cromer

succeeded where Cleopatra and Napoleon
failed? Because, to an extent with.which he

has never yet been credited, he has been able
to understand and willing to identify him-
self with the timid but eternal prejudices of
that backbone of Egypt, the despised and
