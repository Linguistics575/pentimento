TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

neighborhood friends, organized to bring some
decency into the next election and when he
himself was delegated to watch a certain polling
place. His duty had especial reference to the
toughs who hung about this booth, and it was
not long before a friend whispered to him that
one of the toughs was intimidating voters.

"Which one?" Taft demanded.

A deep flush had leaped from his collar to
his temples. He went rapidly toward the
man pointed out, a big stone mason, who
swaggered across the walk to meet him and
tried intimidation on him. He wanted to
know what Taft was doing around the polls,
anyhow.

Boiling inwardly, but without a word, Taft
hit him and he sank in a heap.

"Now then," said Taft, having removed the
cause of discord, "let's find out what's the
trouble here." That was his judicial mind at
work, even in a limited sphere.

CHASTISEMENT OF A BLACKMAILER

But what gave him more standing yet among
those who must respect the physical man first
if they are to respect a man at all was his
chastisernent of a formidable "slugger" named
Rose. The man had come to Cincinnati and
started a weekly blackmailing sheet. The
most respected citizens were not immune from
his scurrilous attacks, and the town lived from
one issue to the next in a state of fear and
trembling. Rose was a dangerous man to
handle, a prize-fighter, and thugs flanked him
round as a bodyguard. Then a filthy article
appeared about Taft's father. The old judge
was a man of stately dignity, though in no way
conscious of it; and he was so absent-minded,
aware of nothing but his work, his books, and
his home, that it was said of him that he knew
but three women by name in the neighborhood,
and one of these was his wife. Rose's scandal-
ous article was therefore ridiculous, and no one
thought anything of it; no one, that is, except
Will Taft. But for him the libel was a criminal
offense against a member of his own family, and
to his mind criminal offenses are things to be
punished.

As soon as the article was brought to his at-
tention, Will Taft called up his brother Charles,
who knew Rose by sight and could point him
out. Charles urged on Will the absurdity of
noticing the libel at all. Will replied that he
did not look at it in that way, and added that
he was going to find Rose at once. Charles

tried to dissuade him, though knowing in his
heart that it was useless. The vibrant, passion-
strung voice coming over the telephone told
him that much, and Charles at last said, "Well
then, I'll go along."

The two brothers, the elder slender and pru-
dent, the younger big and chafing and flushed
to the brow, were hurrying to Rose's sanctum,
when on the way they met the editor himself.

"Is that the?" asked Will.

"Yes, that's the man," Charles replied.

Will stepped quickly ahead of his brother,
and confronted the blackmailer.

"Are you Rose?" he demanded.

But Rose had hardly nodded his head before
Taft had him by both shoulders, lifted him up,
and dashed him to the pavement. Instantly
the 2oo-odd pounds of Taft, knees first, came
down upon Rose, and Taft had him by the ears
and was grinding his face into the pavement.

"If you leave town to-night," said Taft,
"I'll let you up."

Rose sputtered promises, and thus unburd-
ened himself of the zoo-odd pounds. "Now
then," said Taft, "I am coming down town
to-night, and if you are still here, then this
thing has only just started."

But Rose kept his promise.

There are also other legends of young
Taft's prowess in local political affairs, as of
his throwing out-doors a petty boss named
Fagin, who afterwards became his marshal.

MR. TAFT'S PRACTICAL POLITICS

But neither then nor since has he been a
man to endure gang rule, though he does
believe in party regularity. He frowns on
minor differences that might split his party
and hinder its activity in the doing of big
things for the country's good. But he sees no
good for his country in venal bossism, and he
fights bossism as he would knock down a
bully. He simply cannot endorse that kind of
a system of politics, and in this he frankly dis-
agrees with his brother Charles, whose Times-
Star is notoriously the "gang" paper in
Cincinnati. Less than two years ago, Secretary
Taft made a speech at Akron that helped to
drive this "gang," Cox included, out of power.

With no "political order of mind," or politi-
ical ambitions either, the young graduate
entered the political game with the same zest
as he had at Yale, the difference being that
civic duty took the place of college spirit. But
he was not the idealistic reformer, whom he
