A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

Atlanta's buildings and its methods are the
buildings and the methods of a large modern
commercial city. It is the "Southern head-
quarters" for every kind of company or
organization that has to do with the South.
Unattractive in location, self-confident, noisy,
successful, energetic, its population is cosmopol-
itan. It has its street of millionaires (every rich
man is a millionaire for the conveniences of
boasting) made opulent from patent medicines
well as as by legitimate trade and manufactur-
ing; office-buildings and residences that would
do credit to any city; far-sighted captains of
industry, who proved the energy and the con-
structive ability of the common man, as soon
as opportunity opened its doors to him. It is
the great commercial, financial, and railroad
centre of the South east of New Orleans, and is
full of paradoxes and contrarieties, as all new
cities are. It is the home at once of "Uncle
Remus," who has made the Negro immortal
in literature, and of the worst cranks who dis-
cuss the Negro-the best and the worst, the
strongest and the silliest products of Southern
life. All catch the local enthusiasm; all are
building Atlanta. It is a, Georgian Chicago.

BIRMINGHAM

Or, for sheer romance in city-building, con-
sider Birmingham, Ala. There are men now
living who remember the gentle old geologist,
Professor Tuomey, who spent a summer wander-
ing through the valley in which Birmingham
is situated and who filled his wallet with a colored
earth which he picked up on the mountain side.
He took it down to the village of Elyton, where
he spent the night, and told the people that it
was iron ore. They gathered around him and
laughed at him and remarked to one another
that the old man thought he had found some-
thing of value when it was nothing but "dye dirt";
for the Indians and their successors had used
this ore for dyeing cloth from time immemorial.
Yet not a cannon was made of it during
the war that began after Jefferson Davis was
inaugurated at Montgomery. In the course
of time, a railroad was built through Elyton.
Some time later, another railroad line was to
come through the region, but the people of
Elyton had been disturbed enough by one road,
and they declined to have another. The rail-
road-crossing, therefore, was made a few miles
away from the village. That railroad-crossing
is now the centre of the city of Birmingham.
The "dye dirt" indicated a mountain of ore that

for all practical purposes is inexhaustible. So
is the sup" ply of coal and both are near at hand.
Nature, therefore, made a great city in the
valley inevitable.

The furnaces and its rail-making are the
foundation of the town, which is already taking
on the appearance and adopting the methods
of a large city. These industries are, of course,
but the forerunners of other great works of a
similar sort, and all these are but the fore-
runners of a manufacturing development yet to
come, when small things as well as pig-iron and
steel-rails shall be made there, and when one of
the great manufacturing cities of the Union will
fill the valley. People have come to Birmingham
from most parts of the Union, and they are
still coming. It is easy to see that the stream
will continue for an indefinite time, for here
must be one of the great inland cities of the
continent. Already the people are aware of
this, not simply in their boasts but in their
preparations. They have laid out a city by
a method which admits of indefinite growth
without radical changes of plan. They have
already developed a school system which is
really effective. It would be hard to find in
any city of its size better work done, and it
has a public spirit that builds solidly as it goes,
but at the same time builds for a constantly
expanding future. No American city has a
surer future as a great manufacturing centre.

MONTGOMERY

Montgomery is neither seaboard nor upland.
It is a city that has an old-tirne flavor. It was
regarded by its neighbors as a sleepy village,
where the capitol of the state had the misfortune
to be situated-such was the goodmatured
bantering of newer cities around it, until the
present period of prosperity set in. Then Mont-
gomery began to build round about its quiet
and conservative life a commercial activity
that has transformed it, although it has not
changed its old character. Ten years ago,
they used to remind you that Jefferson Davis
was inaugurated as President of the Con-.
federacy in the old capitol. Now they tell
you of the plan that they are carrying out to
remodel the old building and to make it worthy
of the commonwealth. On a conspicuous cor-
ner in the business part of the town, a substan-
tial building, six stories high, which until a
few years ago was the most important business
building in the city, has been torn down to give
room to a skyscraper, for the land does not
