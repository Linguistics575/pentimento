resolve should be done. That this kind of activ-
ity is more lasting than sentimental platitudes
and more binding than oratory is shown by
the well-known fact that the originator of the
idea of a Peace Conference was one of the first
rulers to engage in a bloody war, and by the
further fact that on the day the Czar's repre-
sentative opened the present Conference his
imperial master was in the act of dissolving
the Russian parliament.

The practical results of the present Con-
ference are not limited to the list of articles that
will eventually appear as having been adopted.
Since the preservation of the workfs peace
depends chiefly on a strong international senti-
ment against war, the fact that a topic was
seriously debated in this Conference is itself
both significant and hopeful. Here are some
of the results of which we may hope to reap
the benefit:

(r) Sooner or later, we shall see a per-
manent court of arbitration which will be in a
real sense "the Supreme Court of the World."
Before this court will come the nations with
their quarrels, just as individuals now appear
before lesser courts.

(2) Governments will cease to use their
armies and navies in the collection of private
debts unless payment be refused after the
Hague Tribunal has approved the validity of
such claims. This is the American modifica-
tion of "the Drago doctrine."

(3) Unfortified towns shall not be bom-,
barded at all.

(4) Churches, hospitals, monuments, and
so on, when marked in a manner agreed upon,
shall be spared in the bombardment of a
fortified city.

(s) Merchant vessels and other private
property at sea must for the present remain
exposed to capture, but there is a growing

sentiment among the nations that such property
should be made immune.

These, and other results less concrete, are
long steps in the direction of universal peace
and it is gratifying to know that the American
delegation has exerted an influence second to
that of no other nation. It was General
Porter's wise modification of Dr. Drago's
proposition that really secured its adoption,
and Mr. Choate has been the leading advocate
of a permanent court of arbitration. His clear
and convincing address on this subject, fol-
lowing his earnest ivdividual efforts, had much
to do with changing the opposition and indif-
ference of some of the delegates into enthusi-
astic support of the proposition.

However impractical may be the hope of
permanent universal peace, we may at least be
sure that the Hague Conference of 1907 has
lessened the danger of war in many ways and
robbed it of a part of its brutality.

Long and sometimes fruitless discussions in
committee meetings and on the floor of the
Conference may vex the souls of the impatient,
but it is a good thing to know that we have at
last reached a point where the foremost nations
are willing to spend days and even weeks in
the effort to find a legitimate way leading to
permanent peace.

A MISTAKE

HERE was an obvious but serious error

in the article on "The Prevention of
War" in THE WORLD'S WORK for July. In
the table on page 9145, the two lines showing
the cost and the number of men killed in the
Russo-Turkish war of 1876 and the Spanish-
American war were accidentally transposed in
the mechanical department after the pages had
received their final reading. The error was
too glaring, perhaps, to be misleading.

INVESTING A SAVINGS BANK FUND

LMOST every mail brings to THE
A \VORLD'S WORK letters from readers
who have money in the savings banks

and want to know how to invest it so as to get
better results than the banks can give them.
The sums range from $ 500 to $ 5,000. Nine
out of ten of the applicants have never been
investors? they have been merely savers. Nine

out of ten, too, want conservative investments.
The other tenth wishes to get rich in a hurry,
and wants the way pointed out.

To the latter class this magazine has no
advice to give, except a word of caution. The
others we can help, and we try to help. The
