DANCING AS A PART OF EDUCATION

face (that do not slap), the quaint cajolery, the
dignified ceremoniousness, the whole gamut
of mimic social life.

The music, too, is always appropriate. It
is the music that has grown up with the dance
and belongs to it-the strange harmonies and
peculiar rhythm of a Slavic chardos; the
spirited, sharply accented air, with the bag-
pipe drone imitated in the bass, of "the High-
land F ling."

The fun does not last for more than twenty
minutes, and another group of girls, waiting
their turns, takes the places of the dancers.
But the children have something to carry home
with them---a really significant experience.
The noisy, crowded street and the dingy
tenement will be happier places because of the
healthy, full-blooded rhythm that still pulsates
through their bodies-and through their souls,
too; for it means that they have a new feeling
about life: it is "the little white bird" that is
going to keep on singing in their hearts.

At least that is what those of us who have
watched developments closely are beginning
to believe. And if this is true in New York,
the very storm centre of our civilization, the
place where our national ideals are most
relentlessly brought to bay, where every fallacy
is most pitilessly forced to light in the working
out of a new social order, then it is certain that
the movement will reach out to the children
of other cities as well.

For all those who have interested themselves
in this new movement, it has been a revela-
tion. The school-teachers who first volun-
teered to give up an hour a week of their pre-
cious time to learning folk-dances and to teach-
ing them to squads of children did so because
they thought it would be a good thing for the
girls. Many of them have since declared
that the dancing-hour is the hour in the week
to which they themselves most eagerly look
forward; that it does them more good, and
somehow means more to them than anything
else they have undertaken.

The ancient Greeks understood the signifi-
cance of these things better than we. In their
eyes the body and the mind were a unity,
inseparable, interdependent, to be developed
and perfected together, and in no other way.
In the education of every Athenian youth,
music, athletic training, and dancing had a
part. The theory is beautifully stated in one
of Plato's dialogues: "Rhythm and harmony
are made familiar to the souls of the youths,

945I

that they may grow more gentle and graceful
and harmonious, and so be of service both in
words and deeds; for the whole life of man
stands in need of grace and of harmony."

Rhythm is a fundamental principle of life,
perhaps the most fundamental. The stars
swing through heaven in rhythmical relations
with one another; the sea rises and falls in
rhythm; the human heart keeps its measured
pulsations in the very centre of our being. All
our normal bodily functions work best in
rhythm. In poetry, in music, in everything
that man knows that is highest and most
beautiful, in all the supreme products of his
imagination, there is still to be found some
expression of this eternal principle.

Yet it is not the intellect, the part of us that
understands, so much as it is the body, the part
of us that feels, which responds and vibrates
in the most vivid unison with this principle.
And it is the body which has always first
sought to show it forth, to make assertion of
it, to put itself actively into sympathy with it.

Dancing is an expression of this desire. It
is the most primitive of the arts. The rudest
savages practise it, making it an essential ele-
ment in every religious observance, in every
festival of the tribe. Their emotions inevitably
take form-give themselves concreteness and
actuality-thr-ous' the dance. Marriage,
death, harvest, spring, rain, every stirring event
of tribal existence is so celebrated. It is a
universal language.

Now it is a commonplace of psychology that,
after a fashion, every child repeats in his own
individual development the long history of the
development of the human race. He is the
human race in miniature.

Logic would lead us to expect that the
emotional life of the child would seek to em-
body itself in some of the same forms that are
normal and instinctive to uneivilized peoples.
And this is exactly what we find to be true.

Childhood is the time when the physical
nature is most sensitive to rhythmical move-
ment. Children love even the meaningless
swing of f

"Ene, m√©-ne, mi-ne, ma"
The words which the Australian uses in his
tribal dances, so anthropologists tell us, often
make no coherent sense at all; for everything
has been sacrificed to the rhythmic accent.

Our modern little folks, so hilariously
singing:

"A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket,"
