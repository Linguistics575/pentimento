A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES 9r33



Some time ap, ro, Mr, Montgomery was asked
by a newspaper writer what he thought of l
the future of the Colony. What he wrote in
reply shows his co.nfidcncc in the outcome:

"What Mound Baygn is now, and what it has already
accomplished is largely prophetic of its future. Situated
in the great alluvial Deity district, inngls whose productive
qualities ure not surpassed by fny in civilization, timbered
by hardwood that finds ready sale at almost fabulous prices,
no part of this great section has yet reached its full develop-
ment. The thriving, hustling towns dotted here and there
throughout the Delta, with their factories, waterworks,
electric lights and other modern improvements, have
become what they are with the Delta only partially devel..
oped. What may we expect when practically all the lands
have been cleared, properly drained, with a full supply of
contented and cincient labor to do the necessary work?
In proportion as the whole Delta approaches these con-
ditions, Mound Bayou will progress also.

"There is. another distinction that is more than likely
to come to Mound Bayou as the years go by, and our
schools and churches improve in power and capacity; as
our streets are drained and paved, our oil lamps replaced
by electric lights, and the old, antiquated, characteristic
Delta pump is replaced by clear streams of artesian water.
Negroes will begin to make this their resident home, even
though they are engaged in business or make their liveli-
hood elsewhere. There will be an atmosphere in which to
raise their children, and they will find here social con-
ditions for their wives and daughters very much to their CHARLES BANKS, THE CASHIER 01" THE BANK () l'
liking. There are those who ask,'Are you not afraid that MOUND BAYOU
SUmC day the whites will be moved to wipe out Mound
Bayou by violence?' Knowing the controlling "force
among the whites in this section, as I do, gathered by a
stay of thirty-three years among them, I say,'No, we are
not afraid.' The Negroes who have shaped and controlled
the destiny of Mound Bayou understand conditions too

well to allow any radical or indisereet policy to prevail

here. On the one hand, there are too many white men
