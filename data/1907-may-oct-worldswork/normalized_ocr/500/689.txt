WHEN TO USE A LAWYER

lots, An action to recover the land was brought
against the holders; it was tried three times, and
on each occasion was the subject of extensive
newspaper comment; after sixteen years the
suit came to final termination. Meanwhile,
more than a hundred people bought lots and
built, houses. Not until the sheriff notified
them to leave did they retain counsel. For-
tunately, the successor of the original holders
settled the case at this point and the purchasers
lost nothing. Negligent people buy property
from others who do not own it or take over real-
estate covered with liens of record, or purchase
"first" -mortgages subject to prior liens, loan
money on judgments against the husband when
the wife holds the title or on titles already stag-
gering under the weight of a bad record, not to
mention loaning without a safe margin on clear
security. Western mines have been sold to
Eastern innocents without even color of title.

BEFORE SIGNING ANY KIND OF CONTRACT

Presumably no one would sign a paper that
he did not understand, but the presumption is
by no means correct. It is hardly an exagger-
ation to say that most written agreements that
are entered into are very imperfectly under-
stood. Few men understand the terms of their
fire-insurance policies, and many do not appre-
ciate the provisions in their policies of life-
insurance. Fire-insurance policies have been
found, too late, to cover stock when fixtures
were intended to be insured. When a fire
occurs, it is sometimes discovered that the loss
is only partly insured when it was supposed to
be fully covered. Life-insurance policies have
been issued when, on account of the absence of
insurable interest, they were wholly void. If
part of an agreement is in writing, it should all
be in writing. Nothing should be omitted in
any case and nothing should be included as a
matter of form unless it is known to be such.
Most matters in form are found to be really
matters of substance, especially when they are
contained in the printed portion of any contract;
the lawyer who draws that contract inserts
every sentence with a purpose.

Many do not know that some agreements are
absolutely void unless put in writing in such a
manner that the terms of the agreement can be
found in the paper itself. Among the most
important transactions that fall under this rule
are those pertaining to real-estate. Excepting
short-term leases, practically all agreements
for an interest in, to, or out of real-estate must

be in writing, and require so much care in
drafting that success to the inexpert will happen
mostly as a matter of chance, if at all.

WHEN DRAWING UP DEEDS OR WILLS

To draw the ordinary deed is a rather simple
matter, but the difficulty arises in distinguishing
the ordinary deed from one which may have
certain peculiarities. A real-estate man once
remarked to me that he would do all his own
conveyancing if he had the time. It is fortunate
that this particular real-estate man seems to
be unable to give this matter his personal at-
tention, for on at least two occasions he is known
to have committed errors which might have
cost him several hundred dollars had the deeds
which he tendered been accepted. Every
lawyer has run across deeds which fail to
sufficiently define the land intended to be con-
veyed-a fatal error. Through carelessness or
negligence, provisions may be omitted which
are decidedly essential and proportionately
costly.

In regard to wills, we find two contradictory
popular suppositions; one to the effect that to
draw a will requires little skill; the other that
a shrewd lawyer can break any will. Both of
these impressions are very far from correct.
Wills should always be drawn by an attorney
and the instructions should be given by the
testator (the person making the will) on an
occasion when he is in good health, free from
unfavorable influence, and preferably in the
attorney's office. The paper should then be
carefully preserved in a safe-deposit box, or
in some other place secure from meddling.
No one who is to receive anything under the
will should be present when the instructions
are given, or when the will is signed. The
presence of a principal beneficiary at the ex-
ecution of the will has been the frequent cause
of contests. The disappointed draw the infer-
ence of undue influence, and if to the presence
of the beneficiary is added a weak and de-
pendent condition of mind and body in the
person making the will, a contest may ensue.
A will prepared by an attorney under instruc-
tions received direct from the client, in the ab-
sence of outsiders and executed in good health,
offers great resistance to attack; in at least nine
cases out of ten, it will prevail after death.

The difficulty in drawing wills arises not
from the amount involved but from the pro-
visions which are to be inserted in the testament.
It is often a difficult matter to draw a will
