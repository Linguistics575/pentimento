case system. Twenty-six students entered the
first class, and nearly all of them graduated.
The old school surrendered and came over to
the new one to form the Law Department of
the University of Cincinnati. Judge Taft
was dean, and took for his subject "Real
Property." He had four hours a week at the
school, and sometimes six.

This brings us to one of Mr. Tait's greatest
qualities as a judge, one which denotes
the ideal judicial mind. He is entirely lacking
in what he calls "a pride of first opinion."
Once his mind is made up, he is like a wall
against any change, if the change be attempted
by anything resembling moral invasion. Any
change must be within himself, started by new
evidence or reasoning that will prove him
mistaken. T hen he reverses himself as cheer-
fully as he would doff his overcoat for duck
clothes on sailing into the tropics, and with as
little thought of wounding his self-respect.

There was the case of Mike Devanney, who
wanted to become a United States marshal. He
tried to get Judge Taft's cndorgement. He
was a, good, "gritty," little Irishman, but the
Judge honestly thought that he was not com-
petent and refused. Devanney was much hurt,
and though he received the appointment to the
place, it became his ambition to prove to the
Judge that he was competent. He worked hard

and conscientiously in his office, and a year
or so had passed when Judge Taft received an
inquiry of some sort from the Department of
Justice at Washington. In answer, he had
occasion to mention the marshal's office, and
he added that the present marshal, Devanney,
was the best marshal he had ever known in that
district. Ihevanney himself was ignorant of
this correspondence, but it happened to get
into the papers and he saw it, and was jubilant.
I have it on authority that he still carries
the clipping in his hat band.

To sum up in a few lines, Mr. Taft was
known in his community and to the legal
fraternity generally as a great lawyer. He
was also a thorough, safe, keen, and upright
jurist; but in that Court where he presided,
with men like Day and Lurton, he could not be
said to stand head and shoulders above them.
Strictly as a learned judge, he was not re-
garded by many of the local bar as superior to
Judge Lurton, for instance. Nor was he
eloquent, or brilliant. But there was a feeling
that in other directions. he was, or could make
himself, as strong, A" rpsl effective as in the law.

Other things than the law he might do
as well. There lacked but the opportunity.
But opportunity came, and it was given him
to accept or to reject the one great task of his
life -tl.u.e American task in the Philippines.
