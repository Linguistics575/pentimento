ORIGINAL NARRATIVES OF HISTORY

An historical work of unique interest, and
glut value, is the series of Original Narrativesof
Early American History, now being reproduced
by Charles Scribner's Sons, under the auspices
of the American Historical Association. Dr.
J. Franklin Jameson, director of the depart-
ment of historical research in the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, is the editor of the
series. These volumes will be literal repro-
ductions of the earliest editions of the books
written by the original explorers and founders
of America prior to the year 1700. Of such
books as appeared originally in foreign lan-
guages the best available translations will be
used. The idea is to set before students and
general readers the fresh and vivid words of
the people who were eye witnesses of the birth
of our country-the sources from which all
modern historians have drawn the material for
their works. But, as the editor says, "no sub-
sequent sources can have quite the intellectual
interest, none quite the sentimental value,
which attaches to these early narrations,
springing directly from the brains and hearts of
the nation's founders." Of this series there
have already been issued, "The Northmen,
Columbus, and Cabot, 98ii-r503," edited by
Prof. Julius E. Olson of the University of
Wisconsin and Prof. Edward G. Bourne of
Yale; and "Early English and F rench
Voyages," edited by the Rev. Dr. Henry S.
Burrage. Other volumes in preparation are
"The Spanish Explorers in the Southern
United States," tt Champlain's Voyages," tt Nar-
ratives of Early Virginia," "Bradford's History
of Plymouth Plantation," "Narratives of New
Netherland," "Johnson's Wonder-Working
Providence of Sion's Savior in New England,"
and "Narratives of Early Maryland." These
volumes are sold at $ 3 net, apiece.

Another historical series is the American
Nation, a History," edited by Dr. Albert Bush-
nell Hart, Professor of American History in
Harvard University. The development of the

"

United States has here been traced according
to the clearly defined periods into which, upon
scientific analysis, it is seen to fall; and each
period has been treated in a separate volume,
written by a trained specialist in the history of
that period, who has studied the original

THE GEOGRAPHICAL LIBRARY

Doubleday, Page & Co., are doing a good
service for contemporaneous history: they are
publishing a series of first-hand studies of his-.
tory in the making in all parts of the world
to-day, written by men who are special students
of the countries or movements of which they
write. This series, known as the Geographical
Library, tells the story of the great movements
of world importance in the words of participants
and eye witnesses. "The Opening of Tibet"
is described by Mr. Perceval Landon, a mem-
ber of Colonel Younghusband's party that
first entered the sacred city of the Dalai Lama;
the conquest of Africa by modern civilization
is foreshadowed by C. G. Schillings in tt F lash-
lights in the Jungle"; the stupendous convulsion
in the Far East, that promises to change the
entire course of civilization, is vividly described
by Dr. W. A. P. Martin in "The Awakening of
China," and by Homer K. Hulbert in "The
Passing of Korea"; and the progress toward
the discovery of the North Pole is told in the
words of two foremost American Arctic ex-
plorers, Capt. R. E. Peary, in his "Nearest the
Pole," and Anthony Fiala, in "Fighting the
Polar Icc." These volumes are uniformly $ 3.80
