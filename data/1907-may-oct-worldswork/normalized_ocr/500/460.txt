who are good." It is surprising how many
people accept without protest these premises.
Even so great a teacher as President Hadley
despairs of securing at an early date a large
enough quantity of high ideals to insure good
government oftener than once in a great while.
When, however, we look about us, scan the
faces of the men and women we meet on the
street, in the shop, coming from the factory,
working on the railroad, handling other men's
cash, we must concede that the rank and file
of us are honest, always in favor of what the
Moral Upheavalist calls good government,
and always opposed to what he calls badness
in government. Our most urgent need is not
to manufacture good character, but rather to
increase the certainty that the ideals and the
character already in existence will make them-
selves felt, not merely when reeking corruption
is uncovered, but everyday, all the time.

THE EXAMPLE OF PHILADELPHIA

For example: The people of Philadelphia
who in 1906 turned against a corrupt political
machine were the identical people who rein-
stated that machine in 1907. Judging from
the progress of the rest of the world, the aver-
age moral character of the voters was some-
what better in 1907 when they voted corruption
in, than in 1906 when they voted corruption
out. The difference between Philadelphia
corrupt but contented, and Philadelphia cor-
rupt and discontented, is not one of character
but of vision-of information-a chasm to be
bridged not by ethical training but by infor-
mation about their government. In 1906
Philadelphia was brilliantly informed about
two or three dangers. Everybody could iden-
tify the shady side of the street, its pitfalls and
obstructions. But in 1907 the electric search-
light gave way to a parade of flickering torches
supplemented by an occasional bonfire. When
election day came the rank and file found one
side of the street about as dark as the other and
naturally chose, since compelled to stumble,
to stumble over the familiar path of party
regularity.

Philadelphia's relapse could have been pre-
vented just as the idealists of New York could
have reiilected Mayor Low, and just as San
Francisco can, if it takes the right steps, insure
itself against the recurrence of the condition
which is to-day making that city "the scandal
of the world." No political "isms "are needed,
no moral upheaval. no quack or faith cure.

HOW TO KEEP GOVERNMENT EFFICIENT

The moral upheaval in Philadelphia made
no provision for keeping alive the intelligence
created by the great illumination of 1906.
The Mayor converted knew as little as the
Mayor unconverted, about the current acts
of his subordinates and about the every-day
needs of his city. The leaders of the reform
party knew little more than the Mayor and
little more than their followers. Instead of
keeping up the bonfire of intelligence and
enthusiasm by adding new fuel, they tried to
make a blaze out of the ashes and charred
timbers of the great bonfire of the year before.
No new incentive and no new information were
given to the citizens who desired good govern-
ment. When the Mayor turned over a new
leaf, and as leader of the reform army became
the most highly eulogized mayor in the United
States, his advisers used up their time applaud-
ing his conversion, talked about the "superior-
ity of good motive when once aroused," and
secured the removal-not of the soil that bred
disease but of the men who profited from its
spread. They did not use their opportunity
to obtain a scheme for effective, cumulative
publicity that would give the man in the street
a basis for independent judgment and make
detection of graft so certain that it would be
too dangerous to practice it. Not even in the
departments of health, charities, and police
were methods adopted to weed out the ineffi-
ciency that invites and shelters corruption.
Everybody put on the Goodness button and
talked about the new era of good intention in
government. The tooth stopped aching-the
visit to the dentist was put off. The rain
ceased who cared for holesinthe roof? When
the Mayor relapsed the whole movement
collapsed. When election day came the
reformers themselves were so confused that
many of them sincerely believed that there was
more goodness outside reform circles than
within. Reform was voted out because its
leaders could not give adequate reasons for
staying in to the man who was more interested
in health, comfort, and wages than in the
relative goodness of the two candidates.

Philadelphia's relapse parallelled that of
New York in 1903, after two years of govern-
ment by the rarest galaxy of "good" officials
New York ever had. Y et under men of
unspotted reputation and unquestioned public
interest, it was possible to mix the board bill
for babies with the postage account, to charge
clerical work to contagious disease inspection,
