9272 THE
a very large part of our political life and they
had come to think of themselves as the pro-
prietors of American financial, industrial, and
political power. In this state of mind there
was danger enough. But there was a still
greater danger in the state of mind which lent
itself to what, for the lack of a better name,
may be called Hearstism.

The work of the Administration in reassert-
ing the power of law over the great corporations
has been, not a radical, but a conservative
force. It has kept an angry and radical and
possibly destructive power from organizing
itself. If some state legislatures and executives
have gone beyond sound law and good sense,
this is a small evil that will .soon be corrected.
But, if a strong public sentiment-all the forces
of the dissatisfied-had rallied, let us say, to
Mr. Bryan when he came home and proclaimed
the government ownership of railroads, we
should have had a contest that would have
involved a degree of danger that might have put
an end to prosperity and to many other things
besides.

Now Mr. Bryan himself has practically
recanted. The people have become accus-
tomed to the hope and the expectation that
corporations will be made to respect the la w, that
the Government will be conducted without sur-
render to them; and such revolutionary and
radical proposals as would lead to distrust,
insecurity, and even to confiscation are no
longer feared.

And the problem has been Clea rly formulated
once for all. The complete solution of it will
require many experiments, many years, many
Presidential administrations. But Mr. Roose-
velt has proved that the predatory trusts can
be brought to respect the law without over-
turning our industrial structure and without
checking prosperity. His successors cannot
escape the same task.

Whether, therefore, any particular experi-
ment or proposal be fantastical or fanatical,
and whether any state enact and enforce
absurd laws, or whether Mr. Roosevelt's per-
sonal popularity be on the wane-thee are of
little consequence. To-morrow they will all
be forgotten or reversed. The thing that will
remain for many a day and for other Presidents
and Congresses will be this well-forrnulated task
--to keep the great combinations of capital
within the bounds of just laws without stopping
the industrial machinery and ihrp'ro" fiialole
activity of the coiintry.'..' I

MARCH OF EVENTS

THE MORALS OF CORPORATE CONDUCT

THE whole movement to regulate corpora-
tions, a movement which runs to excess
in vindictive and short-sighted legislation,
finds its justification in this-that it is a step
toward demanding the same standard of con-
duct in corporate and business life that is
demanded in private life. Public sentiment
sets up a standard for private conduct higher
than the standard that it holds the same men
to in their corporate dealings. An explanation
of this double standard is given by President
Hadley, of Yale University, in a recent volume
of addresses on it Standards of Public Morality."
Contrasting the judgment passed on men's
personal conduct and the judgment of the
same community on their corporate conduct,
he says:

"Our experience in the one case has been much longer
than our experience in the other. Men have been trying to
live in peace and harmony with those about them for so
many thousand years that we know what is needed to keep
the peace. But there have been so few hundred years
since we began experimenting with the present commercial
and industrial system that we do not yet know what virtues
are needed for its maintenance. In public morals,
whether commercial or political,. there is no such
consensus of public opinion as to the obligations which a
man ought to assume."

The rude and sometimes mistaken "interfer-
ence" with business by the Government is
an effort to enforce a higher standard of con-
duct; and, foolish and misdirected as some of
this activity is, the public conscience is be-.
hind it.

NORTH CAROLINA RAILROAD LEGISLATION

HE heated controversy between the state
of North Carolina on the one hand and
the Southern Railway on the other points
clearly to the danger of legislation hastily
enacted to meet the demand of the public, and
without proper discussion. The legislature of
"North Carolina at its recent session passed a
law reducing the passenger rate within the
state from 3% cents per mile to 2% cents per
mile. In fixing the penalty for violation of
this law, the legislature appears to have tried
to make it impossible for any railroad to test
the law in the civil courts. In other words,
according to the statement made by Governor
Glenn on this point, the railroad must commit
a crime and must become the defendant in a
criminal suit before a' legal test of the law can
be' obtained. _
