($ 2.20), Animals ($ 3.30), Fishes ($ 4.40),

The Large Print Library is the latest series

This record of serious books, all of them
elaborate undertakings involving a great invest-
ment of capital, upon which the returns must
necessarily be slow and often of doubtful profit,
But it serves to prove
that the publishers are, after all, men who do
seriously consider their duty to the public and
to literature as well as their own immediate
profit. It is an encouraging record of honest
endeavor to do something toward maintaining
a tradition of publishing that has not so much
been changed as obscured in the public mind
by changed methods of exploiting the lighter
products of literature.
