THE SOUTH'S VAST RESERVES

A REVOLUTION OF ECONOMIC FORCES NOT HITHERTO APPRECIATED

BY

D. A. TOMPKINS

[ MR. TOMPKINS. OF CHARLOTTE, N. C., IS AN INDUSTRIAL LEADER AND ONE OP
THE MOST THOROUGH STUDENTS OF PRACTICAL ECONOMICS IN THE COUNTRY ]

present industrial development in the

South is a revival and not an initial
movement. Mr. Harry Hammond, of Beach
Island, S. C., has said that in 1810 the manu-
factured products of Virginia, the Carolinas,
and Georgia exceeded those of all the New
England States taken together. Certain it is
that in the Colonial days and in the early days
of the Republic, the South had a well-developed
and thriving system of manufactures.- In
transportation, the South also led. The first
steamship that crossed the ocean went out of
Savannah. The South Carolina Railway, con-
structed from Charleston to Hamburg, 140
miles, was probably the biggest engineering
enterprise in America when it was building.
The thing which hindered and ultimately
nearly dried up the manufacturing and com-
mercial interests of the South was the institw.
tion of slavery. The introduction of cotton
production into the South enhanced the value
of slaves and, with slave labor, cotton pro-
duction required less effort and yielded more
profit than manufactures and commerce.
Following the invention of the cotton gin,
the number of slaves in the cotton-growing
states was rapidly increased by importation,
largely from other parts of the United
States.

The constantly growing influence of slavery
finally stopped white immigration altogether,
and went further. It stimulated a tide of white
emigration from the South Atlantic States to
the Northwest. Lincoln, Harrison, and others

IT HAS often been pointed out that the

were in this Northwest tide. It stimulated
another tide of emigration to the Southwest.
This was made up of the sons of slaveholders,
with slaves, seeking more land. By 1830 the
production of a few staple crops with slave
labor was practically all that was left. Cotton,
tobacco, rice, and sugar, all with slave labor,
absorbed the time of the managing white folk
in the South, and the industrial workers who
did not get away settled in the mountains or
became very poor in the low country.

We often hear that the immigrant ceased
coming South because of the Negro. This is a
misunderstanding of the subject. It was the
institution of slavery and not the Negro which
dried up manufactures and commerce, which
stopped white immigation to the South, and
which stimulated white emigration from the
South to the Northwest. The Negro has had
no more influence on these movements than
the Indian had. The Negro is here still, in
greater numbers than ever, and in his presence
manufactures and commerce have revived,
and white emigration has ceased and white
immigration has set in anew.

It has been estimated that within sixty miles
of Charlotte, N. C., there are available water
powers sufficient to develop 1,000,000 horse-
power. Reckoning one horse-power as the
equivalent of ten man-power, this would make
the power of these rivers capable of doing as
much work as 10,000,000 common laborers.
This is probably not more than one-third the
power in the Piedmont region in Virginia, the
Carolinas, and Georgia.
