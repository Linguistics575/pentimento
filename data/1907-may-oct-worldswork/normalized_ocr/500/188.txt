librarian is no longer a mere curator of books
but a well-trained, professional man, the
library has been recognized as an active force
in college life.

Their growth, however, has not been entirely
intensive. Since 1895, the University of Vir-
ginia has erected a $ 60,000 library building and
has added 50,000 volumes to the 12,000 saved
from the disastrous fire which destroyed its
former library. In North Carolina, Trinity
College has received a splendid $ 50,000 build-
ing since 1899 and has increased its book col-
lection from 11,000 to 37,000 volumes. In
September of the present year, the University
of, North Carolina will house its present col-.
lection of 45,000 volumes in a new, fireproof
structure and will enjoy, in addition to its
present library revenues, the income from a
new $ 55,000 endowment fund for books. At
the Universities of Georgia and Louisiana,
$ 50,000 library buildings have been occupied
in the last four years and material additions
have been made to the original collections.
South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, and Ala-
bama have each added one or more college
library buildings since 1905; and since January
of the present year, Florida has received a
gift of $ 40,000 for library purposes at Stetson
University.

BOOKS FOR RURAL DISTRICTS

The traveling library, too, has firmly estab-.
lished itself in the South and has met with
immediate success. Its general adoption in
rural and sparsely settled communities is cer-
tain, being conditioned solely upon a proper
provision by the states for its care and direc-
tion. Georgia inaugurated the movement in
1898. By 1905 twenty-three schools had been
added to the traveling list; ninety-seven schools
and forty-six rural communities had received
circulating collections; 4,174 magazines and
periodicals had been sent out; and since 1898,
800 schools have been influenced to make
permanent improvements upon their school-
houses or grounds; 400 have established libra-
ries of their own; forty-six rural communities
have founded village improvement societies, and
a total of 5,468 books have been kept in constant
circulation. In North Carolina and Texas,
the movement has found strong support in the
Federation of Women's Clubs. In Virginia
the traveling libraries have been placed under
direct state control. A fund of $ 7,500 was
appropriated for their maintenance for two

THE GROWTH OF THE LIBRARIES

years. Free transportation was received from
the railroads; and thus the small Virginia
village, which hitherto has contented itself
with its general store, post-office, school, and
church, has been brought under the broaden-
ing, vitalizing influence of the open book.

The most conclusive proof of library devel-
opment is the state library association. In
seven of the Southern States, such an organiza-
tion-composed of librarians, trustees, educa-
tors, members of social clubs, and cthers--has
been formed. With a membership of 1,000, these
associations have given serious consideration
to various library problems and have worked
toward one common end-the popularization
of the library movement and the creation of a
public sentiment sufficiently strong to insure
every community some form of library
facilities. The state library commissions
of Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia
have grown out of the state associations and
have placed all forms of public library activity
upon a permanent basis. In North Carolina,
Alabama, and Texas, the state associations
have not yet succeeded in securing definite
legislation, but the need has been clearly
shown and the demand, sooner or later, will
be met..

In Georgia and Texas, library progress of
all kinds has been longer lived and the results
are more satisfying. In South Carolina, Miss-
issippi, and Florida, growth has been less
evident. But everywhere throughout the South
undisputed progress has been made. Three
facts in this connection are significant. The
first is that the American Library Association
held its annual meeting this year in Asheville. -
A development of sufficient magnitude in the
South brought this deliberative body to the
Southern field for the discussion of special
problems of the Southern libraries.

The second is that, at its last annualmeeting,
the Southern Educational Association created
a permanent department of libraries, thereby
insuring the library due consideration in the
educational work of the South.

The third, and the most significant, is that
there is now in Atlanta a highly developed,
well-attended library training school. This
marks the passing of the untrained librarian
in the South.

In the last ten years, the Southern library
has made a long stride forward. It has been
making for a broader culture and for a larger
view of life. Its success is assured.
