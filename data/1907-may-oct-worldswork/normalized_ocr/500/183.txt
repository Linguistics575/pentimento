THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION

Thomas Jefferson was the first American to
advocate the study of Anglo-Saxon. The
late Professor Thomas R. Price was one of the
first to give English its proper place in the
college curriculum, and his pupils whom he
inspired to take advanceo ork in German
universities were the first Americans to project
a series of Anglo-Saxon texts. Sidney Lanier
indicated with rare insight and enthusiasm
the importance of the study of English litera-
ture, and left behind some brilliant excursions
into the realm of philosophical criticism. His
letters and his lectures at Johns Hopkins
University entitle him to the praise of doing
for the study of English literature what Long-
fellow and Lowell, over a much longer stretch
of time, did for French and German.

The standard biography and the definitive
edition of Edgar Allan Poe are the work of
Professor Harrison of the University of Virginia.
Most significant was Professor Trent's work
at the University of the South. A man of wide
reading in classical and modern literature, a
prodigious worker, a writer of exceptional
power, he was a teacher of much inspiration,
and established himself, while still at Sewanee,
Tenn., as one of the best literary critics of the
country. Through the Sewanee Review, he
not only published his own writings, but was
the means of inspiring other Southern scholars
to write on Southern literature and other vital
subjects. In his life of William Gilmore Simms,
a Southerner made for the first time a critical
study of Southern literature before the war,
and at the same time an incisive and philosoph-
ical presentation of certain phases of ante-
bellum life. Although the book met at the
time with abuse at the hands of conservative and
sensitive Southerners, some of the best friends
of the University of the South going so far as
to demand the author's resignation, it has been
generally recognized as a work of first-rate
importance. Some of his most important
contentions were that the ante-bellum South
was "the least-favored section of all America
for successful literary work," that "no nation
or section will ever get a literature by shrieking
for the-national and the sectional, and not
praying for the true and the beautiful," that
the Southern poet was "too easy-going to
succeed in any form of verse that required pa-
tience and skill," for he "relied on inspiration,
not on hard work," and that Simms did not
attain to the results that his genius prom-
ised.

With the same desire to approach the sub-
ject of the South's literature from- a scientific
standpoint, the late Professor Baskervill, of
Vanderbilt University, published just Joefore his
death a volume on the new school of Southern
writers. Agreeing with Professor Trent in
his estimate of ante-bellum literature, he
hailed with gladness the appearance of the
writers of fiction and poetry who began their
work under new conditions in an atmosphere
of freedom and nationalism.

Maurice Thompson once said that the space
between the literature of the South before the
war and that which is before us now is not "the
mere space of time which separates them. It
is measured by a finer reckoning than the
counting of years." Without going into any
elaborate comparison between the literature of
the two periods, or without giving even a sum-
mary of the work of the new school of writers,
I merely suggest some of the more significant
phases of what may be called a literary move-
ment. There was in the South immediately
after the war a demand, sometimes vociferously
expressed, for a distinctive "Southern" litera-
ture. Magazines were started in many South-
ern cities, publishing houses were projected
either in the South or in the North for the ex-
press purpose of promoting the sale of Southern
books, and there were many men and women
who wrote with the avowed aim of setting the
South right before the world. Some wrote out of
their extreme poverty. There was a deluge
of poems, sentimental and morbid; of rem-
iniscences carelessly put together; of his-
tories written without reliance on documentary
material; of fiction highly romantic and sen-
sational; and text-books written because the
South could "no longer trust the mental and
moral training of sons and daughters to teachers
and books imported from abroad." The idea
was that, as the world was all against us,
patriotic men should now come forth to justify
the Southern point of view.

THE NEW SOUTHERN LITERATURE

About 1875 there began to appear in North-
ern magazines short stories and poems which
were of a distinctly different quality. The real
Southern literature-or better American litera-
ture in the South-came almost without ob-
servation, when men began to describe in a
simple and yet artistic way the human life about
them. Irwin Russell, listening to an old N egro
mammy singing a revival hymn in the back-
