after-glow on my tongue of a coal-tar essence
that must have been used too freely. Another
grain of benzoic acid taken in with the syrup
didn't matter very much.

"For lunch, we enjoyed spring lamb chops
of frozen tenderness---- and nitre and red ochre
freshness. The peas were copper-greened and
fresh-from the can. The horseradish was
out of a bottle of ground turnip, while one-
third of a grain of benzoic acid and some
cochineal came with the brilliant ketchup. A
whole grain of benzoic acid (natural to the
fruit) joined those which had gone before,
when I ate some cranberries.

"Wc all looked well preserved for our years,
with promise of more to come. The'pure
leaf lard' made of olemn cottenseedii ct stearinii
gave the French-fried potatoes a piquant
individuality, although its repetition when we
ate lettuce with salad dressing fetched an
olivc-oil reminiscence to my mind. More
benzoic acid came with the down-trodden
spaghetti, served with non-deeomposable sauce.
We had a little more with the nice hamburger
pttés; but not so much as rightfully occurred
in the prunes served with a very thick, rich,
yellow cream, which analyzed into skimmed
milk, water, viscogen, and annatto oil. I
figure about seven grains of benzoic acid since
rising.

"Miss Peterkin praised the'home-made'
quince jelly, one of the'Mother Jones Pure
Jellies.' This particular specimen worked
out as apple juice, glucose, gelatine, saccharin,
and a f1avoring coal-tar essence of quince,
formula CZHSCQHWOZ. There was just a
little benzoic acid here. I had to take a
long walk after lunch; having overheard the
order for dinner, I figured on about II to 15
grains more of benzoic acid reaching my
stomach by bedtime."

ADULTERATIONS GOOD AND BAD

There are 409 pages of text in the
Government report of the "Hcaring before the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com-
mcrcc," but there is very little agreement on
questions about the harmfulness of preservatives
and the use of synthetic products; the general
impression on the reader is that nobody knows
whether they are harmful or not. Dr. Vaughn,
professor of physiological chemistry and hygiene
in the University of Michigan, a man of the
highest scientific standing, declared the use
of certain amounts of benzoic acid to be safe

and healthful. Dr. Wiley, for the Govern-
ment, says, in effect, "not proven and probably
not true."

There are two sides to the question of food
preservatives. Packing houses make two kinds
of lard. One is composed of the leaf fat of
the hog; it is the lard of our ancestors, white,
pure, and homogeneous. The other is a mix-
ture of stearine and cottonseed oil, stearine
being the oil-globulc skins of suet, the residue
in the press after its oil has been expressed for
use in making oleomargarine. The other
element used in composing this second variety
of "lard "is cottonseed oil. It comes from the
South in tank-cars like those of the Standard
Oil Company, and is renovated and strained
through fullers' earth. There is no health
principle involved in this straining through
fullers' earth; it is to prevent the lard from
looking murky when dancing in the skillet
and blue when asleep in the can. This would
lead to its detection. This care in the "make-
up" costs the manufacturers I,'- of a cent per
gallon. Now is this lard impure, unhealthy,
adulterated? Is an oil taken from a hog that
has been fed on swill and vegetable garbage
any purer or more nutritious than an oil
elaborated from an ever self-purifying hillside
soil?

On the shelves of a wholesale maufaeturer
of synthetieal products (nature foods or essences
made in the laboratory) stand a number of
two-gallon bottles. Pass the corks in turn
gently under the nose, and you can name the
fruit odors they aim to duplicate-pear, banana,
pineapple, raspberry, peach, plum, etc. Here
are delicate variations of odors, differences as
slight perhaps as the vibratory waves of color,
close imitations of the perfumes of fruit and
flower because they are the "formulary" per-
fumes of fruit and flowers. And yet not one of
them came from flower, fruit, or berry.

THE VERSATILE COAL-TAR PRODUCTS

Coal-tar, the black refuse of the retort that
lights our homes, is the parent stock of these
sweetest, lightest, fairy perfumes of the syn-
thetic garden. Coal-tar, that crackles in the
canncl-coal, can destroy the infesting germs
and slay as readily as it can save our lives;
it can paint the lily and the rose in a thousand
shades of dye; it can redden the faded ketchup,
green the sallowed pea, sweeten the acrid coffee,
saffronize the pale oleomargarine, rainbow the
peppermint stick, emera1dize the white créme
