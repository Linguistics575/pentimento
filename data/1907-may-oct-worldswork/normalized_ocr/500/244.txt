ability as a practical man; and you may do
something better than make a fortune-you
may lead a useful life in helping to develop a
rich country and a capable people. You may
enjoy life, too, in a healthful climate, if you
select your place of residence wisely. If you
have brain and brawn to invest (and character),
you can make them yield large dividends.
If you have money to invest, you can make
that also yield large dividends; but you will
be more likely to keep your money safe and
to make it earn good dividends if you manage
it yourself.

If you wish to practice the law or to preach,
you will not be so likely to succeed. These
professions are not particularly in need of
recruits in the South. If you are a teacher,
and especially if you think more of doing. good
work and of seeing appreciative results of your
work than of earning a large income, you will
find a held of usefulness as wide as the most
ardent ambition could ask. If you are an
engineer or any such craftsman-a man who
can build things-you will find profitable
work and plenty of it. The land cries out for
builders, developers, workers, practical men;
and great rewards await them. It has (and to
spare) philosophers and politicians and pro-
fessional men of all the old sorts.

A WORD 0F WARNING

WHILE it is impossible to write of the
industrial South without enthusiasm,
it must be remembered that the prosperity of
a city or a state may not mean the success of
every individual effort, nor does it mean that
fortune or even employment is always easily
found by every man.

There is no land where everybody can get
rich. In Montgomery, Ala., a man who had
just been talking for an hour about the need
of men, saying, dt We can give work to men
who can do anything well, from hod-carriers
to artisans of the highest skill," was accosted
by a young fellow who had come there from
a distance and whose family were.known to
him. He sought work and failed utterly. He
was willing to do anything, he said; he had
tried in vain for two days to find a job in
Montgomery. It turned out that the young
man had never done but one kind of work and,
lacking experience and self-confidence, he had
seriously sought work only of that sort. Such
a case shows only that men will try to fill
round holes with square pegs. This general

THE ARISEN SOUTH

note of warning is necessary, for a quick success
is not easy to win in the South. It isn't easy
to win anywhere. But in the South it is now
easier than in any other part of the Union,
for the men who do the right things at the right
places and at the right times.

OLD-TIME COURTESY WITH NEW ACTIVITY

HE information gathered about the South

in the preparation of this magazine---
about its industries, its cities, its towns, its
opportunities-incomplete as it is, comprises
a vast number of facts for which there is no
room in these pages. The territory is so
large and the subjects so numerous that no
single description could hope to be nearly
complete.

But through the Service Department of
THE WORLD'S WORK, information about any
of these subjects or localities will be given to
any reader for the asking. And, if informa,.
tion is wanted that is not in this office, any
inquirer will be directed to a trustworthy source
from which it may be obtained. This Service
Department is at the free use of every
reader.

It is a pleasant duty to say here, at the con-
clusion of this most interesting incomplete
task of reporting and emphasizing the South's
progress, that the editors of this magazme and
other writers for it who have gathered these
facts have had a most pleasant experience.
Everywhere they went-and they went in almost
every part of every Southern State-they
found courteous and helpful men, in official
and in private life. The search for informa-
tion from them has been made an agreeable
task; and these long journeys were journeys
from onenoersonal kindness to another, and
from one hospitality to another-through a
land of Qld-time courtesy as well as of a newly
awakened activity.

If there be readers who find a magazine
monotonous that is given wholly to one sub-
ject, such a journey is commended to them;
for they will see the rapid rise of a great popula-
tion of American folk, which is the cheerfulest
sight on our continent and the most important
event that is taking place in our life. If there
be monotony, it is the fault of us who have
written, not of the subject; for it may be said
now (and this could not have been said for a
hundred years till now) that the Southern
people are coming into the full current of the
life of the Republic.
