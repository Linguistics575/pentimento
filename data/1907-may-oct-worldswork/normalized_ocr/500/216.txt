of great shoe factories as well. Here is a
mountain city in Tennessee, then, proud of
its university and its great variety of manu-
factures, especially of wood and iron, and its
quarries, and-just across the mountains-
another city in Virginia where you hear talk of
shoes and tobacco and a famous college for
women which draws its patronage from all the
Southern States. Each has its machinery for
indefinite wealth-getting and for education.
Similarly in North Carolina, Charlotte, at the
foothills of the mountains, with a sub-stratum of
combined Scotch and Southern conservatism
and solidity (it is a very old-fashioned town yet
at bottom, in its social structure and in its
thought), has come to be a manufacturing city

already of great importance and of very much
greater promise. It is surrounded by cotton
mills; and it makes much machinery for cotton
mills and especially for cottonseed-oil mills.
It has nearby water-falls enough to give
uncommonly cheap power and to turn more
wheels than it yet has. The people were
always sturdy and independent (it is a home
of Scotch Presbyterians), and they refuse to be
swept away from their moorings by sudden
impulses. But, in the steady growth of their
industry, they are among the best examples
of an old community that has taken on new
life without losing the old. The unusually
independent morning newspaper of the city, the
Observer-one of the best in the whole South--
is a fair index both of the character and of the
enterprise of the people. It is fast becoming
one of the most important industrial centres
of the Piedmont region.

the whole South, the successful turning of the
Southern people to manufactures. It is one of
the busiest manfacturing places in the South,
growing all the while, at a rapid rate; and
some of its iron and steel works are now parts
of the great industrial combinations. But
every one of them was begun by individuals in
small ways; and, contrary to the general belief,
most of these individuals were poor Southern
men. Besides these large works, there are
many small manufacturing concerns, and
manufacturing concerns that turn out small
wares, showing that the individual man may
yet have his shop there. It is a city of diversi-
hed industries. An old-time economist of Bos-
ton used to boast that there was a street of
successful workshops in that city-of many
sorts-in every one of which the proprietor
was himself a workman and that no one of them
employed more than two or three assistants.
It was a street of independent craftsmen.
Chattanooga has many such. A man may go
there who has his craft for his capital and only
himself as a workman and, if he can manage
his workman well, he may build up an indepen-
dent manufacturing business. One of the
biggest plow-factories in the country began
there in that way.
