HATTERAS

THE NORFOLK-BEAUFORT WATERWAY, WHICH WILL
AVOID THE MOST DANGEROUS CAPE ON OUR COAST

BY
JOHNH.SMALL

REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT, NORTH CAROLINA

HERE are several inland waterways

I projected along the Atlantic seaboard,

to provide safe passage for our coast-
wise trade. Besides the Cape Cod Canal,
there are plans for waterways connecting
Raritan Bay and Delaware River, connecting
the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay,' and
another extending from Winyaw Bay on the
coast of South Carolina to Jacksonville, Fla.
The most important, however, is the water-
way extending from Norfolk, Va., through
the inland sounds of North Carolina south-
ward to Beaufort Inlet.

This is known as the Norfolk-Beaufort Inlet
Waterway, and is about 205 miles in length;
the present project is for a minimum depth of
twelve feet, the estimated cost being a little
less than $ 3, 500,000. The exact route is shown
on the accompanying map. It is not expected
that this waterway will accommodate large
ocean steamships, but the depth will be ample
for capacious freight steamers and for barges
having a draft of ten feet and a capacity of
1,000 tons, which will carry bulky products at
a minimum of cost. It will insure perfect
safety for the vessels passing through, for it is
protected along its entire length by what is
known as "The Banks," the line of sand-dunes
separating the ocean from the inland sounds
of North Carolina, and it will entirely avoid
Cape Hatteras and the treacherous inner and
outer Diamond Shoals which extend nearly
fifteen miles into the ocean and constitute one
of the most dangerous points in the world.

In 1903, commercial organizations in the
cities of Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington,
Georgetown, Charleston, Brunswick, Savannah,
and Jacksonville compiled data showing the
benefits which would accrue to these ports and
tributary sections by the construction of this

waterway, a tabulation of which shows an
annual saving of $ 5,500,000. A special board
of United States Army Engineers estimated
that the traffic which would be affected annu-
ally amounted to 1,100,000 tons, and that the
yearly saving from its construction would
amount to $ 600,000. This was based upon a
conservative estimate of the traffic which would
unquestionably seek coastwise movement.

All the ports south of Hatteras would have
a safe and cheap means of transportation to
Norfolk, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York. It would help relieve the congestion of
freight on the railroads and act as a regulator of
rates. It would affect the whole country east
of the Alleghenies. Incidentally, the canal will
make a great change in eastern North Carolina.
Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds are fed by
six navigable rivers-the N euse, Pamlico,
Roanoke, Chowan, Perquimans, and Pasquo-
tank. From the Neuse River to the Virginia
line, there are at least eighteen large counties
containing some of the most fertile lands in the
country. No part of the section tributary to
these sounds and rivers now has an outlet to the
ocean for its water-borne trade. Beaufort Inlet
is the only one which offers an unobstructed
navigable depth, and this is inaccessible. It
is true that Pamlico Sound is connected with
Beaufort Inlet by Core Sound, but this is only
about four feet deep. There is no outlet at
all on the south, and the only passage for its
water-borne trade is northward through a canal
to the Elizabeth River and thence to Chesapeake
Bay-which canal is owned by a corporation
that charges toll. It was estimated by the Board
of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors that by
the construction of the new waterway eastern
North Carolina alone could effect an annual
saving of $ 200,000.
