(Elie march of Events

T this time of the year, when men begin
as many as can-to put aside their

routine work fc: a few weeks' rest, it
is pleasant to look about and see what great
forces are at work to lift living to a little higher
level and give inspiration to nobler endeavor.
The task is the more pleasant this year because
a fair inventory of the activities and of the
good fortune of the people of the United
States must show a cheerful total.

There is one fact in particular that must
make a profound impression on any student
of contemporary events. For a'year or two,
financial trouble has been feared and by many
well-informed men it has been' repeatedly
predicted. Many have firmly believed that
the National Government's efforts to restrain
corporations would check investments and
hinder industry; many have felt sure that the
restrictive and in some cases violent legislation
of some of the states would so drive capital
to cover, that legitimate industry would halt;
and others have feared that the inviclious
cmphrsis that has been put on wealth during
this long agitation would encourage a violent
class feeling by the poor against the rich and
would bring an era of dangerous economic and
social experiments.

Nothing of this kind has happened. The
public has refused to be frightened by the
fears or by the threats of the great corporations,
and the great corporations have not been
hurt in their legitimate activity by any rising
tide of popular anger. There could hardly
be better proof either of the safe foundations
of our prosperity or of the essential soundness
of the pcoplc's judgment.



Doubtless we shall have more financial
panics and more panics of popular thought
(which are closely akin): but for the present,
at least. we are keeping our balance prettywell.

A CONSTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE

HE continued prosperity is proof that the

great economic laws which determine
production, distribution, and consumption are
far too fundamental to be seriously atl'eeted
by restrictive legislation and investigation.
Incidentally, our continued prosperity proves
also that the general tendency of corporate
regulation is rather toward business security
than toward disturbance. Some foolish local
laws do damage as far as they go. But the
main tendency of the whole agitation of the'se
last two or three years is reassuring and
constructive.

Proof of this is easy to find. Consider, for
instance, the prohibition of railroad passes.
{ very railroad in the country has profited by
it; and they have profited not only by the
receipt of increased revenue from fares but even
more by relief from a vicious system of special
favors, which was a system of petty blackmail.
Again, in every case where a rebate has lJL'tll
stopped, not only has the railroad received more
money for its service but it has given the com
petitors of the rcbate-rcrvivcr. a greater security
in their business.

A larger result than all these is the general
awakening of the public eonseienee about. the
management of corporations. Not only have.
railroads and other public-service em'porations
become more careful in thiir conduct, hut
private corporations as well. If an examin'
