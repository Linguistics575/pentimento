CITY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN

govern itself within its grotesque geographical
boundaries? Has not New York City a right
to govern itself, free from the interference of
the rest of the state of New York? What
business has any state with the administration
of a great city within its borders? The
right answer to these questions is that a great
city is so far created and maintained by the
country from which it draws its food, and to
which it distributes all sorts of goods in return,
that the tributary country ought to have a voice
in its affairs. Thus, eastern Massachusetts,
with the help of the New England sea-coast
north of Boston and of the Canadian maritime
provinces, created Boston and long maintained
the city. Railroads have spread out in all
directions except toward the east, and the
tributary country which is also the area of
Boston's distributing function has widened.
Through all this larger region Boston exerts
a strong influence, industrial, educational and
political, and in return this whole area contrib-
utes incessantly to the life of Boston. Every
great city makes a large part of the life of the
state in which it is situated, and may therefore
exert upon all the moral interests of the state
as well as its material interests an influence
which may be either good or bad. In the
quality of the government of the great city the
whole state has in very truth a direct interest
which can only be properly described as intense.
This is particularly the case with regard to the
city's management of those portions of its
population which make money out of the gross
vices. One might as well say that the rest of
the body has no interest in the heart, and
should have no control over the heart, as to
say that a state should have no interest in or
control over the management of the great city
within its borders. The whole body needs a
calm, steady, strong heart; but the heart can
have none of these qualities unless it be fed,
regulated, and controlled by all the rest of the
body. City and country are in reality bound
together by a complex network of channels
through which flow the lifeblood of both. To
think of the city as a detached entity living for
itself alone, and therefore entitled to control
its own affairs without interference from out-
side, is to be blind to the plainest facts of the
case and to uphold a theory which can only be
disastrous in practice. Just as the idea of
local representation has become inapplicable
in city populations, so the idea of local self,.
government without external interference has

become inapplicable to cities, particularly
when the territorial unit of the city is too small
and has no natural boundaries. In every state
of the Union there ought to be a state officer or
board exercising over all the cities in the state
some of the powers which in England are
exercised by the Local Government Board."
That Board is a national authority which,
among other functions and duties, controls the
financial engagements and the expenditures of
local bodies in two ways: (a) in most cases,
before any local authority can borrow money,
it must obtain the sanction of the Board; (b)
the Board subjects the accounts of most local
authorities to an independent and searching
audit. This financial control, which is not yet
thirty years old, has proved highly useful.
Its legitimacy is unquestioned in England.

The causes of, or reasons for, municipal
failure in the United States are then somewhat
as follows: The original structure of the city
government was ill-suited to the work to be
done; and municipal work has so changed since
the American city government was constructed
that a form of government, originally founded
on a false analogy, has become less and less
adapted to present functions. Secondly, city
business being now much more elaborate, ex-
tensive, and complicated than it was originally,
inexperienced, frequently changing executive
bodies, like sub-committees of city legislative
bodies, have become worse than useless; be-
because the real business can only be done by
experts. Thirdly, the old idea of local repre-
sentation and local government is inapplicable
to modern cities. Fourthly, the city taxpayers
have lost control over the expenditure of the
tax money they have paid in. Fifthly, the unit
of area for taxation is so defined geographically
that a just system of taxation has in many cases
become impossible, and great wastes in the
various branches of the city administration are
inevitable. Sixthly, the practices of corporations
that need public franchises have been often
corrupt. Finally, legislative remedies for these
evils have been hindered by a false theory that
a city ought to be an independent entity
managing all its own affairs, and accepting
neither aid nor control from the state.

The result of all these difficulties has been
that the entire business of a great city is usually
done in an unintelligent and inefficient way,
and often in a dishonest way. Direct municipal
stealing has been notorious, and indirect steal-
ing still more frequent and mischievous. Some
