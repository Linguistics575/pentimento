system that belonged to the Middle Ages. "

Ten years ago, state-aided rural school
libraries for North Carolina were not even
talked of; while every day for five years now
some new storehouse of the 1vorld's intellectual
wealth has been put within reach of the coun-

money the state has ever spent has produced
better results.

Yet another noteworthy fact in the enrich-
ment of country life is the rural telephone--
farmers in more than one county setting up

wealth that its people are proudest. The
moral tone of the population is improving.
More significant than the growing number of
