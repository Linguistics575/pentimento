and was a plain and proper statement. But
a part of the pamphlet was made up of a
recital of events with the purpose to show that
the whole Administration at Washington has
conspired, in most sensational ways, to hound
the Standard Oil Company. This was a mis-
take---a mistake of a piece with Judge Landis's
action.

As the matter now stands in the public mind,
therefore, a United States judge has done a
sensational and apparently vindictive thing;
and the Standard Oil Company has tried to
prove to the public that the whole Administra-
tion is vindictively pursuing it. The sensa-
tional part of the public may take a morbid
pleasure in this situation. But thoughtful
American citizens deplore it because the courts
must administer exact justice. They are our
chief organized safeguards against mob-
judgments. Every thoughtful man wishes the
Standard Oil Company, and every other
accused company and individual, to establish
its innocence of wrong-doing, if it has done no
wrong, and to be brought to proper punishment
if it has done wrong. But we have no place
in American life for vindictiveness, least of all
in courts of justice; and by the same token an
accusation of vindictiveness on the part of the
Government, made bya defendant in the courts,
is in bad taste; it arouses bad blood, it shows
bad judgment, and the course of exact justice
and of ultimate sound judgments by the people
is thereby made more difficult.

THE LONG CRUISE OF THE NAVY

A LONG cruise of the greater part of our

Navy is to be begun about the middle
of December. Sixteen battle-ships, under the
command of Rear-Admiral Evans, and a
ilotilla of six destroyers will steam around
South America, up the Pacific to San Francisco,
where the very considerable Pacific squadron
will meet them, thence possibly to Puget Sound,
thence to the Philippines, and (if a yet uncon-
firmed report be true) through the Suez Canal
back to our Atlantic waters. Such a journey
even as the sail around South America by such
a fleet of such ships has never yet been made.
They will make friendly calls of several days
M each of the principal ports on the voyage,
and they will spend a month in target-practice
in the Pacific before they reach San Francisco
---tparly in April.

This announcement has been received some-
what hysterically by a part of the press, on the

assumption that this voyage is meant to be a
boastful notice to the world, and to Japan in
particular, that we are in fighting trim. Such
an assumption is gratuitous. The Govern-
ment and the naval officers of every Power in
the world know perfectly well the size, the
armament, and the condition of every fighting
ship that we have. Assembling them and
forming one huge fleet will not give any gov-
ernment on earth a single item of information
that it does not now possess.

So far from witnessing such a fleet with fear,
every South American government will be
pleased by a visit from it, and our officers will
be received everywhere with the greatest cor-
diality and everywhere they will carry friendly
greeting. When they reach our own Pacific
coast, they will be greeted with the greatest
enthusiasm. The pride that the people take
in the Navy-have those of the Pacific
States not as clear a right to it as those
of the Atlantic States? Moreover, the ships
must be in motion somewhere most of the time,
for practice and discipline; and a continuous
voyage of many thousand miles, for these
purposes, does not greatly differ from many
shorter voyages up and down our Atlantic
coast. In regard to practice; and discipline,
the sailing of a big fleet will have some advan-
tages over the corresponding work of small
squadrons.

As for boasting or warlike demonstration,
that may be left out of all calm comment. No
nation now has any thought of war with the
United States, nor have we any thought of war
with any nation. But if there were any such
thought or fear-let us say of war with Japan---
the presence of this great fleet in the Pacific
would be the best possible reason for Japan's
hesitation. That remote silliness apart, the
voyage will remind our own people, and the
rest of the world as well, that we have two great
oceans instead of one, and that our interests
in the Pacific from Panama to Bering Strait
and thence to Manila are important interests.
Americans are at home in all these regions;
the Navy is theirs, quite as much as it is the
people's of the Atlantic States; and, since we
are at peace with all the world, securely and
indefinitely, there are no reasons of danger
why our warships should forever hug our East-
ern shore. Jefferson wished to have a navy
that might be drawn ashore on the flats of the
Potomac between wars; and this notion does
not seem yet to have become wholly obsolete.
