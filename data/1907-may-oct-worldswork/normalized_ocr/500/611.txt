in an incident that dates back to his student
days at Rome. It is said that one morning
when the Alban Hills showed white a-tnp, he
stripped off his student blouse, hurried to the
summit of the highest hill, filled his lungs with
the cold air, rolled ct snowball, and then re-
turned with renewed enthusiasm to dusty
Rome and the study of the past. "The Sun
Vow" is another instance; distinctly American
in its conception and execution, it l "as modeled
almost in the shadow of the Vatican, without
so much as a breath of the past iniluencing
the mind and hands of the sculptor.

"THE PRIMITIVE CHANT" BY MR. MACNEIL

This execution of "The Primitive Chant" is now at the Peabody
Institute, Baltimore

Mr. MacNeil's Indians give further proof
of this quality. They are genuine savages--
not cigar-store Indians nor "Wild West Show"
specimens. They did not come to his studio
to pose; he went to them-to the tribes of the
Northwest and to the Moquis and Zuiiis of the
Southwest. But while the types are genuine,
caught "in the open," they are not the shiftless,
saloon types. His Indians do not shoot deer
out of season, nor tap other men's maples.

"The Coming of the White Man" is, per-
haps, the best-known of his Indian groups.
This stately, clean-limbed chief and his com-
panion belong to the Multonomah tribe of
