A BUILDING FORTY-

NINETY FEET UNDERGROUND, PROOF AGA

CHARLES

' I IHE development of the skyscraper has
advanced to such a point that problems
new even to this class of architecture

are being met. The new Singer Building,
in lower New York, will be the tallest building
in the world-forty-seven stories in height, rise
ing 612 feet above the street.

When completed, this office-building will
have a floor space equivalent to a lone-story
building covering twenty city blocks. To con-
centrate such an immense space upon a total
area of but 26,000 square feet, presents at once
the serious question of sufficient light and air.
Usually, a high building is designed to cover
as much of the area of the lot as possible,
thereby cutting off the light of surrounding
buildings. For this reason dark offices are multi-
plying in the largest American cities. And many
buildings that are now well lighted must soon
depend wholly or in part upon artificial light,
as adjacent buildings are extended upward.
All the offices of the Singer Building will be well
lighted, but the building adjoining it will not
suffer. The part of the building that will be
carried up forty-seven stories will occupy but
one-sixth of the lot; the remainder will be
only fourteen stories in height. This high
portion will also be in approximately the
centre of the new building. Thus every
office will be well lighted without a sacrifice
of real estate values that would be commer-

_ ciallyimpracticablc. The location of the high

tower near the centre of the lot also makes
it possible for nearby offices to share the sun-
li ht.

I is claimed that the safest parts of this
building in time of earthquake will be the
highest stories. The lesson of the San Fran-
cisco earthquake is that "the steeMrame
structure is the best earthquake resister."
The steel-frame building is constructed very
much like a bird-cage, while an ordinary build-
ing of brick is a house of cards in comparison.
The only possibility of danger to the tenants in
this high building will be the dislodgement of

masonry; this, of course, would affect only the
lower floors.

The danger of fire has been eliminated,
for inflammable material has been entirely
omitted. Even so-called "f1re-proof" wood
has been barred. Nothing but metal, stone,
and baked clay enters into its construction.
Even the small plugs of wood usually inserted
into the wall to receive nails used in hanging
pictures have been excluded. The fires in
Baltimore and San Francisco proved that the
alleged "fire-proof" building is not fire-proof,
for wooden floors, window-frames, and trim-
mings for such a building amount to millions
of feet of lumber.

Before beginning construction, "test borings"
were made in order that the engineers
might know the exact condition of the soil
underneath the site of the building. These
borings are similar to the sample "plug" which
the careful buyer of watermelons demands in
advance. The process of building foundations
must be modified if large boulders are to be
encountered during the work. Four test
borings were driven down eighty to one hun,
dred feet below the surface of Broadway to
explore the ground for irregularities in the soil.
After bed-rock was reached, these cores were
driven several feet into the rock; here it was
necessary to use drills with diamonds set around
the cutting edge. A earefuldrawing was made
so that the exact kind of soil at any distance
below the street could be known at any time,
and an actual core several feet in length was
lifted out of the rock and examined in the office
of the architect. This was considered neces-
sary in order to be sure that the rock found
was bed-rock and not merely a huge boulder.
In each instance the cores brought up proved
conclusively that the building would rest upon
a foundation amply firm. Another reason
for taking the test borings was to allow a close
estimate of the cost of the foundation structure
to be made.

The foundation work presented some inter-
