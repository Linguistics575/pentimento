It is a cardinal principle of forestry that only
land not permanently suited to agriculture
should be used for growing timber, From one-
fifth to one-third of the land area is about the
proper proportion to keep forested for the sake
of the general welfare. If this be correct, the
South, with over one-half of its area wooded,
can stand a good deal of clearing up. As scien-
tific agriculture gives greater productive power
to farming land, as cities grow in size and
increase the demand for food, and as the rural
population multiplies so that more land can be
manned, it will pay better and better to bring
forested areas under the plow. On'the other
hand, the rapidly rising price of lumber, the car
tainty that the nation is approaching a serious
timber shortage, and last but not least, our fast
growing knowledge of how to make American
woodland most productive, justify expectations
of an increase in the bid which forestry will put
in for use of the land.

THE POSSIBILITIES 0F FORESTRY

Undoubtedly much of the present hardwood
forest area will eventually be turned into farms.
The process is now going on extensively in
Texas and elsewhere. The future of the
sandy Southern pine land is more doubtful.
As forest it now bears, in mature timber, an
average stand of some 3,000 board feet to the
acre-a very low average for productive tim-
ber land of good quality. Under better man-
agement, it can probably be made to produce
every sixty or eighty years from 10,000 to
15,000 board feet of timber, salable at a much
higher price than at the present. The vast area

THE DECREASING ILLITERACY OF THE SOUTH
The white section represents theilliteracy in 1900; the white

1900 to 1907 has been much more rapid.
