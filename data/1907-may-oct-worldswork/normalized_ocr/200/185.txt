THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL

No words could better express the full mean-
ing of the awakening in literature.

For the comprehension of the more impor-
tant phases of contemporary life in the South,
one must go elsewhere than to the writing of
which we have been speaking. "Of careful
analysis of social conditions, of profound study
and comprehension of the principles of human
nature and human action, and of serene, self-
contained art, there are still few traces in the
Southern literature of the present generation."

This deficiency has been, in part, supplied
by such books as Mr. Edgar Gardner Mur-
phy's "The Present South" and Mr. Holland
Thompson's "From the Cotton Field to the
Cotton Mill."

Necessarily, there has been much writing on
the Negro problem. With the lurid and melo-
dramatic novels and plays of Thomas Dixon
before us; with the temperate discussions in
Thomas Nelson Page's "The Negro: the
Southemer's Problem" and Prof. W. B.
Smith's "The Color Line"; with the widely
divergent addresses and articles by such
leaders as Senator Tillman, Bishop Galloway,
and Chancellor Hill--we have every element
that enters into a most complex situation.
Furthermore, in Dubois's "Souls of the Black
Folk" and Booker Washington's "Up from
Slavery" and "The Future of the American
Negro," the race has not been without its
own interpreters.

THE SPIRIT OF LITERARY INDEPENDENCE

The critical point of view has been applied
not only to the study and writing of history and
literature but to all other phases of Southern
life. The right and the duty of criticism have
been firmly established. The critic has had
to contend against emotionalism and a spirit
of futile obstruction. He may have at times
been unduly rasping and unsympathetic, but
he has in the face of all obstacles maintained
the right to see facts as they are, to judge the
South in the light of the best that has been and
is being thought and done in theworld, touphold
standards of excellence. He has had to resist
the conservative and the sentimentalist. Some
men have, ever since the war, failed to under-
stand the meaning of defeat. They have
magnified the life before the war as "the most
glorious in the history of the world." They
have been unwilling to see any defects in the
South and consequently have resented criticism
either by Northemers or by the people of their

own section. They have failed, as Lanier
said, "to perceive the deeper movements under
running the timcs." They have been willing
to have the South remain proud in its isolation.
They have harkerl back to the bitter memories
of the past. In a word, they have forgot nothing
and learned nothing.

The conflict between these two types of men
has waged furiously since the close of the war.
The contrast may be seen in the fiery speeches
of the unreconstructed Toombs and the states-
manlike address of Ben Hill ttt Tammany
Hall in 1866.

No severer rebuke has ever been given to
seetionalism than Lamar's speeds on Charles
Sumner and no more genuine plea was ever
made for nationalism than Henry Grady's on
"The New South." Dr. J. L. M. Curry over-
threw the contentions of many a moss-back
when he said before the Georgia Legislature:

"I am not afraid of the educated masses; I would rather
trust the masses than kings, priests, aristocracy, or estab-
lished church. No natiun can realize its full possihi _
unless it builds upon the education of the whole people."



When Major Robert Bingham said, "The
greatest blessing that ever befell us was a failure
to establish a nationality, and the next greatest
blessing was the getting, rid of slavery on any
conditions," he answered effectively a certain
type of Confederate memorial address.

After all, is it not true that "educators are
needed more than capitalists; school houses
more than factories: a change in educational
methods more than a change in politics"?
Slowly, out of investigations and reports, articles
and addresses, and even books, there is evolving
a well-defined educational programme or policy.
First, there is a desire to know and to state
facts. In the Governor's oiiice at Raleigh,
N. C., several years ago, some educational
leaders were formulating a platform for an
educational campaign. The question arose
whether the actual facts with regard to
illiteracy in the state should be incorporated
in the statement. Governor Ayrock said
impressively: "If it is a fact, then let it be
stated in unmistakable terms." Now that is
the spirit of the present South. The old son-
sitivcness with regard to the opinion of others
has yielded to the grave facing of facts. "Men
recognize that the greater reproach is not
illiteracy, but indifference to it. They per-
ceive that its significance cannot be offset by
dwelling upon the admitted and often darker
