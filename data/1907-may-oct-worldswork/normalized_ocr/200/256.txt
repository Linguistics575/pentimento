ma" be. It is not the quantity of "printed
sturf that shapes public opinion, nor is it

sucn information or argument as the "news,
firms" and the "news-syndicates" and the
"economists" and such-like persons grind out.
The experience of the railroad companies
proved that. They spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars to keep broken-down editors and
"experts" in most fluent activity; but public
opinion shaped itself without apparent ref-
erence to what they wrote.

The writing that counts in the shaping of
public opinion is the writing that is sincere,
that has the ring of a personal conviction, that
shows the accuracy of honest work, that is
done by men whose only aim and whose
obvious aim is to tell the truth, and that is
published in journals which receive their in-
come only from the public-from their readers
and from their legitimate and clearly designated
advertisers. The ready-made, tainted "syn-
dicates" and writers and the periodicals that
use their matter have slight effect on public
opinion.

The most serious inquiry suggested by the
whole matter is this-ls any corporation in
which you are interested wasting your money
in maintaining this imbecile sort of "pulr
licity"? If it is, you ought to call its managers
to task; for this method is the best method
that could be hit upon of bringing a corp0ra-'
tion under suspicion. If it needs paid writers
and publicity men, is there not something
wrong? something that requires "explanation?
It is surely true that those corporations that
maintain "publicity bureaus," from which
much reading matter comes, thereby arouse
the suspicion of independent journals; for
no independent periodical will ever publish
any article written by a paid publicity agent of
any corporation.

HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING

HE average American of our day lives

better than his parents lived. He enjoys
more luxuries, can spend far more money,
is better educated, eats better food, reads
better current literature and more of it, wears
better clothes, and in almost every other
respect has advantages beyond the advantages
of his forefathers.

In wealth, the average American of to-rlay
possesses nearly four-fifths as much again as
did the average American of 1880. He carries
in his pocket, or at any rate keeps in circula-

tion, about 70 per cent. more money. In the
banks, he has more than three times as much
money.

It is not a wonderful thing, therefore, that
the life of the citizen of to-day should be much
more civilized, if one may use the term, than
the life of the citizen of yesterday. For,
strange as it may seem to the mind of the man
who sees but the darker side of our national
life, the real necessities of life cost little if
any more today than they cost twenLy-seven
years ago. The statistics that cover the
cost of all food, clothing, metals, and other
factors that enter into the daily living expense,
show that the average cost at the first of the
year was represented by the figure 107.264,
while in 1880 it was 108.653. It is true that
in 1897 it dropped to 72145. but that was in a
period of disaster.

Consequently the average citizen has money
to spend for luxuries. He spends it well.
Perhaps the history of higher education in the
country during the period is as good an index
as any. In 1880, there were in all the colleges,
technical schools, and other institutions of a
higher grade but 38,000 students. In 1906,
the total had grown to 120,000, of whom about
27,000 were women. In the same period, the
attendance of children at the public schools
had doubled. The country has taken a long
step onward toward the ideal of universal
education.

And in the home, comfort has grown. The
ideals of home life, at least in the matter of
creature comforts, has steadily grown higher.
It is difficult to find a perfectly satisfactory
test for this statement, which rests rather upon
the facts that one may gain from observation
than upon scientific data. The average
American of today uses about seventy-six
pounds of sugar a year as against about forty-
two in 1880. Turning to more practical tests,
one finds that the rag carpet has been crowded
out by the machine-made rug; that modern
plumbing, or at least plumbing of some sort,
is becoming common, even in the rural com-
munities; that the demand for household help
has far outstripped the supply, even at prices
two and three times the prices of 1880.

Today the working man lives in what
would have been called luxury a quarter of a
century ago. In New York, in this last year
or so, he has been the mainstay of a huge
speculation in city lots at outlying points. In
many cases, he builds his own little home. In
