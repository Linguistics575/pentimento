THE PREVENTION OF WAR

THE KINDS OF CONFLICTS THAT ARBITRATION, ENFORCEI) BY WORLD-
OPINION, MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED DURING THE LAST CENTURY

Court of the United States is credited

with a statement that had we allowed
the negotiations with Spain to continue for
thirty days longer, instead of terminating them
for the arbitrament of war, Spain would have
made Cuba free and we should have obtained
the Philippines at no greater outlay than the
sum they cost us.

It is a striking statement, and one that may
well form the basis of a discussion of the real
use of the so-called "peace movement" of the
day. For, if the Spanish-American war could
have been averted by a common-sense policy
of arbitration or delay, then the movement
has a tangible and practical meaning to every
citizen of the United States. It may be a
factor in preventing other wars into which we
might plunge.

A study of the last century and its wars
reveals the startling fact that of forty or more
great wars involving civilized races, more than
half might have been prevented by the applica-
tion of common sense, backed b) C, powerful
and well-organized peace movement throughout
the world.

It is difficult to reckon with any degree of
certainty the exact loss in men and money
entailed upon the nations by these wars.
Fairly reliable statistics are obtainable for
about seventeen of the big wars since 1815,
and these figures are shown in the accompany-
ing table.

These figures take no account of "Britain's
hundred wars," the punitive expeditions by
the dozen carried out by the other colonizing
nations throughout the whole period, nor of
many other clashes more or less costly and
serious. In a Burmese war, unlisted here, the
British alone spent over $ 60,000,000 and lost
20,000 men. In the retreat from Cabul,
16,000 British soldiers fell. The list does not
include the Indian Mutiny, the British war
against China for the opium trade, the Danish-
Prussian war, the war of Russia against Persia.
The omissions are made because, while in
many instances fairly accurate iigurcs can be

obtained for one side, the losses of the other
side are impossible even to guess.

It is undoubtedly conservative to say that
the direct cost of the wars in which the civilized
ur semi-civilized races have been engaged
during this period will run to 5,000,000 men
and over $ rc, ooo, ooo, ooo in money. Much
of this enormous loss might have been
averted.

Of the forty important wars of the period
covered, about orurhalf were revolutionary;
but in seven of these cases a foreign power
intervened to affect or change the course of the
struggle. Of these revolutionary outbreaks,
twelve may be traced to the influence of the
principles that were born in the French Revolu-
tion, and that found a fertile soil for their
growth in the disturbed conditions that were
general throughout Europe after the fall of
Napoleon Bonaparte. These wars were the
natural result of the great clash between the
principles of despotism and liberty in the
French Revolution.
