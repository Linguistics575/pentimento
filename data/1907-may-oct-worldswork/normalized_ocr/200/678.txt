right to produce men in each of these classes
who might be imagined as willing to teach the
country a lesson. Let us imagine, then, these
five representatives of the financial clsses
gathered together to complete the details of
their great conspiracy.

Dinner passes swiftly. Coffee and cigars
prepare the way for business. The waiters
and the butler disappear. The host gets up,
locks the door, sits down again. The setting
is ready. The curtain is up on the first scene
of the great conspiracy. The host speaks:

"We have prepared a plan," he says, "and
will discuss it now. We understand each
other, and we know where we stand. The
object is to clear our hands of every dollar's
worth of property and every stock and bond we
own in the United States, and to do it in such
a way as to secure to ourselves the best results,
yet leave as we go memories that will be a lesson
not merely to the Administration and the People
of this country, but to all Administrations and
to all peoples. I shall now read the'plan."

A CONSPIRACY OF THE BIG FIVE

It is simplicity. A year is allowed for the
sale of all property, and of all securities. The
banker is pledged to assist in every way possible.
Such stocks and bonds as have a broad market
are to be fed out to the public slowly, yet as
fast as may be without disturbing the market
over-much. A new market is to be made for the
quiet stocks. One great industrial corporation
with 100 millions of stock, selling at $ 500 per
share, is to be reorganized quickly into a 500-
million dollar company, because the public
will buy ten shares at $ 100 more quickly than
one share at $ 500. The selling is to be dis,
tributed among a hundred stock exchange
houses, so that it may not be traced. A huge
campaign is to be started by the Gambler,
because it would not attract any suspicion and
would serve to divert attention. The Banker
will see that Wall Street has money in plenty.
All checks received from the brokers who sell
are to be deposited in his bank. They will
provide abundant credit, and this is to be kept
at the disposal of Wall Street for many months
to come. Extra dividends are to be declared on
the magnate's railroad stocks, one after another,
yet not too close together. The Steel Man is
to plot a great consolidation of the trust and
all the independents. It must hang fire and
last as long and create as much speculative
interest as did the great "Hill ore-deal," in 1906.

MONEY-KINGS

"That, gentlemen," says the spokesman,
"is as far as we need go at present. It is the
first step. It is, of course, obviously necessary.
The rest is all prepared, but it is as well, with
your permission, to take one step at a tirne.
What do you say?"

And so it comes about that Wall Street wakes
up and hangs out its most alluring banners.
The market hums, and sings, and dances.
Men make millions gambling in stocks and, of
course, re-invest the millions in the same stocks.
The struggle between capital and labor sub-
sides, strikes cease, harmony reigns supreme.
Groups of the magnates hasten to Washington,
time in, time out. Peace breathes from the
columns of the press, in sage and guarded inter-
view, in brilliant editorial, The Big Stick
is hung aloft to make a perch for cooing doves.
The fiery backwoods legislator is quenched in
an editorial bucket of common sense. All is
serenity. The people are rich and happy.
Financial editors note, with entire satisfaction,
that the common people, at large, have taken
to investing in stocks and bonds as the French
do. Confidence has returned to the land.

So pass ten months. Then, on a night, the
Five come together again, in the same room, to
the same call. Once more, over cigars and
coffee, the host opens his mind.

"Everything is sold," he says, "except my
country place, and that is mortgaged for more
than it cost me, and Mr. B's stable of horses,
and that is insured against fire. We can now
pass on. Before another step it taken, how-
ever, it is necessary to confer as to whether we
shall go on or turn back. There has been a
year of great prosperity and peace" -he
smiled-" and perhaps some of us think it
would be better not to go on, but to-well,
what do you say?"

"Go on!" said the Gambler.

"There will be a crash anyway in a few
months," said the Steel Man, "if that Con-
solidation goes through!"

"I want to get out of the country," said the
Industrialist, "before the public starts to sell
its stocks. Whether we go on or not, this
country will soon be too hot for me. A falling
market breeds enemies for us."

"With the growth of Socialism," said the
Banker, "the country is not fit to live in any-
way. Let us go on."

"Very well-we shall go on. We find that
our united wealth is now represented by
$ 1,2oo, ooo, ooo, all in bank credits, We have
