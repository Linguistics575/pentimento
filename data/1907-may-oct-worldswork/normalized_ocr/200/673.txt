The Pueblo form at construction has been followed here also in all the buildings

south of Mason and Dixon's line which have
been declared eligible under the provisions of
the Carnegie Foundation. Its executive head
is President William G. Tight, an energetic
educator who came originally from Ohio. Dr.
Tight is a prominent geologist and geographer
and was recently president of the Cordilleran
section of the Geological Society of America.
His originality made a practical and artistic use
of his research work when he conceived this
pueblo idea.

The largest of the new buildings already com-
pleted, the women's dormitory, is called "Ho-
ko-na" ("The Butterfly"), the Sikyatki symbol
for maiden. The men's dormitory, a trifle
smaller than the other, is called "kwa-ta-ka"
("Man-eagle "), after a legendary monster who
lived in the sky and harried the people of Siky-

atki until their warrgod killed it. On the
farades of the buildings have been painted con-
ventionalized likenesses of "Ho-ko-na" and
"kwa-ta-ka," copied from the mural decora-
tions which once adorned the walls of Sikyatki
and from designs on pottery dug up from its
ruins.

Each building is equipped with electric lights
and all modern conveniences, has commodious
suites, and is provided with furniture and in-
terior fittings carrying out the Indian idea as far
as possible. The dormitories are strongly built
of brick and covered with 21 coat of rough ce-
ment that exactly counterfeits the stone-adobe
construction of the original pueblos. Bricks
made of adobe or sun-dried mud, as well as
stone blocks, were used by the inhabitants of
Sikyatki and their neighbors. The modern
