Every Man's Duty, Then

What, then, is the plain duty of every man of
affairs in a time like this? Ought he to go
about crying alarm and declaring that the
Administration's "war on trusts" is bringing
anarchy? This tide against unjust corporate
acts runs far deeper than any activity of any
Administration; for, if the present public mood
continue, the next Administration may bc-
may have to be-far more "belligerent" than
this. Secretary Taft is perhaps the most con-
servative and judicial and safe man who is
spoken of as a possible Presidential candidate
of either party; yet he takes essentially the
same stand as President Roosevelt, and rightly
calls it "conservative." For the alternative
is Bryan or Hearst. The people are not going
back to the old ways of corporate domination.

The first duty of every man of affairs is to
keep his common sense and not talk about a
possible panic.

Next, he will conduct his own business with
common sense. He will not conclude that his
success or failure is determined by "the
Administration" or "the times," but chiefiy
by his own management.

If he has doubtful debtors, he will collect
his bills as fast as he can. He will see that his
finances and his business methods are sound;
and he will work harder than ever to keep them
so. If he has been wise, he has already created
a reserve for just such possible emergencies,
so that he will not be dependent, even at the
worst, on the money-market while it is high.
He will reduce his expenses wherever he can
without doing structural harm to his business;
and he will not make or accumulate a large
surplus stock of wares.

The Large Results That Are Coming

The business of the country is good. It is
active and sound. There is not enough avail-
able capital for the rapid expansion of many
great industries, but there is a plenty of money
for ordinary productive uses. The adjustment
of corporation conduct to a new standard of
morals is causing a shock-that is the chief
trouble. Industrial stocks lessen in value and
other stocks fall in sympathy. This was
iaevitable. Some sound companies and many
innocent investors will suffer some loss. But

MARCH OF

EVENTS

these losses are the necessary incidents of a
change to a sounder basis of conduct. The
foundations of prosperity are not shaken. And
the acceptance of the inevitable will make the
change easy and safe; and the future will be
far more secure against disturbance and panic
than any period of our past has been.

_ The inevitable changes that are taking
place are:

A more honest conduct of corporations;

A loosening of the grip of the financial kings
on the surplus capital of the whole country; and

A reform of the tariff.

The sooner these tasks are done, the sooner
we shall be rid of both real and imaginary
reasons for fear of harm to our vast and pros-
perous industrial structure.

THE HONEST MAN'S LAND

IN THE light of this fundamental awaken-

ing and of this change that is demanded
in corporation methods and morals, there is
something silly and pitiful in the attitude of
Wall Street to the President.

"Where will he stop?"

"What will he do next?"

"Can't something be done to change his
conduct?"

In the first place, this is far too flattering to
the President's power. He does not hold the
prosperity of the country in the hollow of his
hand. From another point of view, it is a
sort of insult to him to assume that, having
started on a clearly defined policy, he is going
to turn back because the price of securities
falls. He is not that kind of man, and nobody
wishes that he were.

Then, again, while Mr. Roosevelt's method
is his own, the general course of action of the

.Administration is the action of the American

people; and the "criminally rich" may just.
as well recognize this fact. Mr. Roosevelt is
only one of the people's instruments.

To a student of our national temperament
and mood, who has watched the course of
events for the last few years, these things are as
plain as the nose on a man's face.

Plain also is this danger: if the great finarr
cial interests stand in the way of the punish-
ment of the guilty or try to prevent the adoption
of a higher standard of corporate conduct,
they will bring a stronger class-feeling, a deeper
hatred by the poor of the rich. The people
of the United States-the great masses of the
pcoplc--stand with President Roosevelt, in
