THE. MACNE1L STUDIO AT COLLEGE POINT, NEAR NEW YORK CITY

It adjoins the MacNeil home and commands a fine view of the Sound

public recognition has already come, it is some-
thing of a surprise to walk into his studio at
College Point-on Long Island, within sight of
New York City-and be greeted by a boyish-
looking young man whose beard seems out of
place. He takes his work sslusly-while
he is at it-but he does not take his fmished
work so seriously as one might expect. If you
ask to see the comr1wmrorativcx medals which
he has won, you must wait until he has found
them and rubbed off some of the tarnish. His
studio (which is within it few feet of his homo)
is hlled with sketches, figures, busts, and all
the paraphernalia of a sculptor, but the man
himself makes you feel that you are in a work-
shop, not in a sanctuary of art where C0nVersa-
tion must be carried on in a language of
technicality. There is absolutely no "pow"
about him, and you may talk with him for an
hour without observing any trace of affcctation
in manner or speech. That he is a dreamer
is evident-but evident only in his work. Very
slender, of medium height, he has a fine, com-
pact head and large eyes that meet yours with
the suggestion of a twinkle. His name betrays
his Scottish origin but his personality is that
of the Latin races.

As a nmtter of fact, Mr. MacNeil was born
in Massachusetts, at Prattville, and the first
part of his professional education was obtained
at a normal art school in that state. Later on
came more ambitious work in Paris, where he
won honors in the Julian School and in L'Ecole
des Beaux Arts. On his return from Paris,
he went immediately to the Northwest, where
he sojourned with the Indians while making
sketches for the four bronze reliefs that now
adorn the Marquette Building in Chicago.
These reliefs, symbolizing four dramatic inci,
dunts in the life of Pere Marquette, the explorer
of the Mississippi River, were early evidences
of his genius..

Then came another long period of study.
While working in a Chicago studio and teach,
ing in the Institute of Art of that city, 0ppor-
tunity came for a four years' course in Rome.
Before leaving Chicago, he was married to
Miss Carol Brooks, one of his former pupils.
During the four years, they studied together
under the same masters. Since his return, he
has been himself a teacher in the best of Amer-
ican art schools. He was one of the first
instructors in drawing and modeling at Cor.
nell University when Andrew D. White carried
