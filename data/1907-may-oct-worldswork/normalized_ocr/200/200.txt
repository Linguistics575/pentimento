The markets for cotton goods are constantly
increasing. For the six years from 1885 to 1891,

PEOPLE

the average yearly consumption of cotton was
8,670,000 bales. During the next six years
it was 10,849,000 bales. From 1897 to 1902
the average had grown to be 13,398,000. For
the six years ending in 1908, it will have risen
to more than 15,000,000. Even with this con-
sumption the United States Department of
Agriculture estimates that only omrthird of
the world's population regularly wear clothes,
that half are partially clad, and that the rest
habitually go almost naked.

Since 1880, enough cotton mills have been
erected in the cotton-growing states to spin
2,000,000 bales of cotton. Yet that has not
kept pace with the increased demand. The
mills in other parts of the United States have
increased during that time 28 per cent., and
in England and on the continent of Europe
they are still building mills. The increase in
the use of cotton cloth will continue until it
covers the millions now unelothed.

THE COMING REVOLUTION IN POWER SUPPLY

But there is one influence pointing to the
future prosperity of the mills in the cotton-
growing states which does not affect the other
great mill centres to anything like the same
degree. At Whitney, N. C., a 33ryard dam
is being built across the Yadkin River to turn
1,700 cubic feet of water into a 412-mile canal.
At the end of the canal will be a fall two-thirds
