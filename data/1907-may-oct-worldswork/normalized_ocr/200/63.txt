THE HONOR OF THE RAILROAD MAN"

buried unde: a little white stone that lay in the
path of the railroad.

"Oh!" said the engineer.

And that is the reason why the railroad runs
through that valley to this day on a gentle
curve, bending some forty feet from a tangent.
Which only goes to prove that the man who
tames the West can be reached some way, even
though it be not with money'nor with lands.

If any man want confirmation of these
statements about the relative honesty of the
men who opened the West and carried its
business to and fro over the thirty years of
struggle, let him look for the men who did the
deeds. A dozen, out of the thousands, I
know are living in wealth in the great cities.
Two I can name who may have made the basis
of their wealth by dishonest dealing on a large
scale. The others came up slowly, by terrible
labor and sheer genius.

But where are the men who made the West,
the pioneers who opened up the fertile valleys?
Some few of them you may hnd holding high
positions on the roads they built, or on yet
other roads. Few of them can, at this day,
afford to retire from labor. Those who can,
you will find in the suburbs of St. Louis, in
the little towns of Illinois or Indiana, living
in modest houses, men small of means and not
at all pretentious. If any one of the engineers
who built the Union Pacific had so much as
gained an option on 1,000 acres of the land
through which the greater part of the railroad
lies, he would have been to-day a wealthy man.
If any one of them had sought hrst his own
profit, he would have been to-day a man of
millions.

The same applies to the traffic men of the
last decade and the decade before. I know
three old men who served three railroads of the
West in traffic positions that could have yielded
to them hundreds of thousands of dollars in
perfectly safe and highly respectable "graft."
All are retired, and all are living modestly, and
on not as much money as the average man
could save in ordinary pursuits in a shorter
life than theirs, and a much easier one.

I went beyond the facts I have set down, and
looked for the reason underlying them. I
think I found it. By way of comparison, and
merely to establish the reason, I carried my
questions into other professions. I found,
for instance, a fixed impression among the
junior officers of three great industrial and
manufacturing companies that the "shipping

Mth

department" and the "tralhc department" of
these companies were very desirable places
to work, because the heads and the men imme-
diately below the heads of these departments
"are apt to get rich."

I did not go far enough to establish the charge
that this "aptitude" is general among the
industrial companies. In fact, I failed to
find it in two large industrial companies, so
far as I went into their affairs. I did find it
a fixed impression among the men of three out
of the five corporations to which I turned.

THE RAILROAD CODE OF HONOR

Among the men of the railroads, I have never
found that the habit of "getting, rich" by
methods outside the regularly established salary
is expected, or winked at, or encouraged in the
men of any department on the railroad. In
fact, the man who seems to be living beyond
his visible means of support is immediately
under suspicion. The men below him do not
envy him. They despise him. The "graiter"
on a railroad cannot hold his staff together,
for the simple reason that the whole code of
railroad morals is directly against him. From
the smallest office boy in the executive offices
to the head of the traffic department, the same
code of morals obtains.

I am writing, of course, of general condi-
tions. It is well known that on at least one
railroad system there has been, and is, a reign
of "graft." The result is astounding to any
man who does not know the railroad men at
large. That railroad and its men are "black-
listed," quietly, automatically, all over the
West. The feeling runs into the operating
staffs, even to the presidents. Where traffic
can be diverted from that road it is diverted.
The road is considered a leper amongst its
fellows. The men who run it are tainted.

Of course, it is not argued that all the million
men who draw the pay of the railroads are
clean men--far from it. There are always,
in every profession, many men who think that
they can "beat the game." The point is that
"the game," on the railroads, is a clean game,
played under rules stricter and better enforced
than any other rules that regulate' a similar
profession.

I can speak for this on my own authority
from years of close contact with the game as it
is played, and from a fair understanding both
of the code of railroad morals and the spirit
in which it is enforced.
