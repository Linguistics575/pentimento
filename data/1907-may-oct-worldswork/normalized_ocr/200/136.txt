Thus this historic .Exposition is held in a land
of historic memories.

The E.xpos.itio, n will emphasize-really for
the first time in the minds of the whole Amer-
ican people, who know their New England
history far better than they know their Southern
history-thc romantic and interesting story
of the great Southern colony. In fact, this
may turn out to he the great-the very great--

study of Southern history.

THE BEAUTY OF THE GROUNDS

The Exposition grounds have a water front-
age on two sides -Hampton Roads and Boush

strands of barbed wire, making the fence about
eight feet high. Strung upon cross timbers
that extend two and a half feet on either side
from the top of the posts are five other strands
of barbed wire, making it almost impossible
for any one to get through or over the fence.
But all this framework is hidden beneath a
mass of verdurc that makes it look like a huge
hedge fence in mid-summer. At each post
is planted a trumpetwine; between each post
is a crimson rambler rose; and between the
trumpet-Vines and crimson tumblers, honey-
suckle has been trained. The vines were
planted in May, 1905, and, as they are native
to the South, they have attained full growth
and now form a mass of green begemmed
with fragrant flowers that charm the eye and
fill the air with fragrance.

For three years, the landscape gardeners
have been transforming the beauty of this
wilderness into 21 wilderness of beauty. All
the natural charm of the site has been saved
and augmented. Upon the eastern margin
