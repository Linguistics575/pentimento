TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

JUSTICES WM, R. DAY, OF THE SUPREME COURT, AND H. H. LURTON, OF THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT COURT
Associated with Judge Taft, of the Sixth Circuit, "thes) made that court the greatest subordinate court in the United States
according to the high respect paid it by the whole legal profession"

case system. Irvunty-six students entered the
first class, and nearly all of them graduated.
The pH school surrendered and came over to
the new one to form the Law Department of
the University of Cincinnati. Judge Taft
was dean, and took for his subject "Real
Property." He had four hours a week at the
school, and sometimes six.

This brings us to one of Mr. Taft's greatest
qualities as a judge, une which denotes
the ideal judicial mind. He is entirely lacking
in what he calls "a pride of first opinion."
Once his mind is made up, he is like a wall
against any change, if the change he attempted
by anything resembling, moral invasion. Any
change must be within himself, started by new
evidence or reasoning that will prove him
mistaken. Then he reverses himself as cheer-
fully as he would duff his overcoat for duck
clothes on sailing into the tropics, and with as
little thought of wounding his sclf-respcct.

There was the ease of Mike Deranncy, who
wanted to become a United States marshal. He
tried to get Judge Taft's endorsement He
was a good, "gritty," little Irishman, but the
Judge honestly thought that he was not com-
potent and refused. [) evanney was much hurt,
and though he received the appointment to the
place, it became his ambition to prove to the
Judge that he was competent. He worked hard

and conscientiously in his office, and a year
or so had passed when Judge Taft received an
inquiry of some sort from the Department of
Justice at Washington. In answer, he had
occasion to mention the marshal's office, and
he added that the present marshal, Devanney,
was the best marshal he had ever known in that
(listriet. Devanney himself was ignorant of
this correspondence, but it happened to get
into the papers and he saw it, and was jubilant.
I have it on authority that he still carries
the clipping in his hat hand

To sum up in a few lines, Mr. Taft was
known in his community and to the legal
fraternity generally as a great lawyer. He
was also a thorough, safe, keen, and upright
jurist; but in that Court where he presided,
with men like Day and Lurton, he could not be
saitl to stand head and shoulders above them.
Strictly as a learned judge, he was not re-
garderl by many of the local bar as superior to
Judge Lurton, for instance. Nor was he
cloqucnt, or brilliant. But there was a feeling
that in other directions he was, or could make
himself, as strong'ifrnrl effective as in the law.

Other things than the law he might do
as well. Thure lacked but the opportunity.
But opportunity came, and it was given him
to accept or to reject the one great task of his
life -tlu; American task in the Philippines.
