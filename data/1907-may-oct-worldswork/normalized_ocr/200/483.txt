WORLD-WIDE PROBLEMS OF RACE 9281

peaceful cooperation of all other nations, we
should make short work of war. Great
captains with their noise and guns would go out
of fashion in a jiffy; the barriers of high tariffs
would disappear; we should manage the world
with much less tomfoolery of kings and parlia-
ments; and peace conferences would be
unnecessary.

This gives a suggestion of constructive states-
manship-the making of trade and communi-
cation and association easy, the working out of
government and of industry so as to make it
cooperative in a world-wide way, the bringing
of men and of nations to look upon themselves,
not as parts of a parish nor of a province nor of
one country only, but as parts of the world.
To be sure, we are gradually going in that
direction, but the progress is rather slow.

It is worth while to remark that this universal
Martian unity and peace rest on a mechanical
necessity. So, too, it is worth recalling, the
most rapid strides that we have made toward
world-unity have been taken because of
mechanical inventions-the stcam-cngine, the
telegraph, and the like. And mechanical helps
will doubtless continue to be the best helps in
the progress of Civilization. Railroads are
mechanical, and flying-machines, and the
Panama Canal, and most of the means whereby
we have increased the production of useful
things. Mechanical, in a sense, are the
methods of conquering the tropics so that white
men may live and work there. When we
perfect the machinery of communication, of
transportation, and of production (of which our
present machinery is probably the crude fmst
forms of an experimental period), then the
Socialists and Utopians will come to their own
and we may learn the lesson of the dwellers on
Mars.

Yet, it may be that the whole canal system
of that planet-their water supply, from pole
to pole-is owned bya trust, and the inhabitants
form one great peaceful community because
they are in industrial serfdom!

WORLD-WIDE PROBLEMS OF RACE

GREAT volume of instructive literature

has been suggested by the British
Colonial Conferences-Mols about imperial
political organization, about commerce, and
about all the kinds of world-wide tasks that
engage the attention of the strongest organiza-
tion of the most powerful race of men that ever
lived; for the British Empire, whatever its

future, is so far the biggest political fact in
human history.

Any man who follows this literature, both in
English periodicals and in books, fmds the key
to the dominant thought and feeling every-
where in-race-unity. This is almost as true
now as it was centuries ago when raee-dii-
ference was of itself a sufficent cause of enmity
and often of war. Toleration of other races
has grown with every century-grown in some
aspects; but the radical race-difference always
asserts itself. In India, in Africa, in China,
in the West Indies, wherever there is an English-
man, he regards other races as radically dif-
ferent and as inferior to his own, and he at
least tacitly denies their ability ever to rise to
his level.

The application of this fact to political and
military organization, to trade, and to all the
other practical problems of civilization-that is
the British Empire; and every discussion of
large policies comes back to this central fact.

While, therefore, the Peace Conference is
dealing, in its restricted and almost necessarily
non-committal way, chiefly with the courtesies
and the etiquette of quarrels between "chi.
lizcd" Powers, the gravest dangers to peace
in the future, as they were in the recent past,
are the dangers of race-conflict. Witness the
Boer War in South Africa and especially the
Japanese-Russian War. Witness the danger
that will arise at some time at Constantinople.
Witness the unrest in India. Witness the
little irritations of the Japanese in California.
Witness our long unsuccessful dealings with
the Indians. Witness the troubles these forty
years in our Southern States-for that matter,
our troubles since African slavery was intro-
duced into the United States.

There is a deep hostility, too, in some other
races to the Et1glish-to all white men. It has
been only flhy years since the Indian mutiny,
and there is a persistent unrest to-day in India.
The Japanese are so jealous of their race pride
that they easily take offense. The Chinese
have no love for "foreign devils," and very
little reason to have.

The great field for humanitarianism in the
future-for that matter, the one great direction
of true civilization-is not the field of mere
religious propaganda, but the adjustment of
race-differences. The task is to find honor-
able and peaceful ways of lessening the dislike
that most races of men have for other races--
to find ways of living and working together in
