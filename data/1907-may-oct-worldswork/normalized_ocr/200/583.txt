GREAT fall in the price of securities has
A been taking place the world over; large
borrowers-railroad companies, for in-
stance-have had an increasing difficulty for a
year or more in borrowing money for pressing
improvements and many of them have had to
give up their efforts. There is not available
money enough to keep up with the great de-
mands of industry, for reasons that have been
explained many times in this magazine. But
this state of the money market has now be,
come so acute that the usual superstitions are
repeated and the easily provoked fear of
fmancial circles asserts itself; and these seem
to make it worth while to set down here the
simple, fundamental facts on which our pros-
pcrityrests-to write common sense about the
situation.

THE FOUNDATIONS 0F PROSPERITY

THERE are three things required to make
wealth and to keep the people pros-
perous. They are productive work to be
done, men to do it, and money or credit to do
it with. Wc have all three. There is a plenty
of productive work to be (lone, work that
supplies the needs of mankind and adds to the
real wealth of the world-land to be tilled,
mines and forests to be worked, materials of
every sort to make useful things of, and hauling
to he done-in other words, agriculture, mining,
manufactures, transportation, and all the
activities that these imply. Ours is, therefore,
a land both of plenty and of industry. There
is no lack of wealth to be got for work and
there is no lack of energy in working for it.
The millions of productive Americans who

sow and reap and find and make and distribute
commodities of every sort are supplying the
real needs of society-the necessities of life.
Rich as we have become, a very small propor-
tion of the work done in the United States, or
of the raw material used up, goes into mere
luxuries or into any other form of economic
waste. Most of it goes to make things that are
necessary for the food and the shelter and the
health and the comfort and the convenience
of mankind. The margin of wasted work is
yet very small.

There is, then, nothing the matter with the
resources of the country and nothing the matter
with the energy or the industry of the people.

Now let us consider the third thing that keeps
prosperity going-money to work with. That,
too, has been productively used during this
long period of prosperity. Nobody has hoardcd
it. Many men have become rich, but the rich
have been using their money in productive
war. They have built and equipped and
conducted railroads; they have cut forests;
they have mined metals; they have built lilo
tories and most of their investments have been
made in our own country. Capital has flowed
freely into all sorts of profitable uses. A man
who could make money has been able to get
money to work with. The distribution of
capital for productive uses has been easy.

And these three things have made us pros-
perous-a land of plenty, men to work, money
to work with that could be got in small sums
or big sums for profit-earning uses.

Now no change has come or is coming in the
productive possibilities of the country. Nor is
any change coming in the industrious habits
