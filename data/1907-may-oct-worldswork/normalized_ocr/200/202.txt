THE WARP ROOM

"We are using electricity at the Dover Yarn Mills. At
the time we installed electric motors, we were also putting
in some additional machinery and making some other
changes. However. as near us we can figure, we are getting
the use of power m-day-also our lighting, heating, and

slashing-dur about ll per cent. less than our coal bills
were, prior to the installation of electricity. I would say,
however, that we were running under poor conditions so
far as the distribution of power was concerned.

"We were enabled, in addition to the reduction of coal
bills, to utilize the space formerly used for boilers and
engine room for putting in new machinery, and we have
to-day quite a little more machinery in the same space
than when we were running by steam alone. The saving
in head-shafts, heavy shafting, boiler setting, engine fours
dations, and boiler and engine rooms, would justify putting
in electricity in a mill even if the cost of horse-power were
the same."

The development of the power of the South-
ern rivers means as much to the Piedmont
mills as the power of Niagara would mean
to English cotton spinning if it were situated
in Manchester. With the added advantage
of the water power, the development of the
Southern mills is limited only by the manu-
facturing ability of the Southern people. In
spite of their work of the last twenty years,
that capability is sometimes questioned.
