9348 THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL FATIGUE

throughout her junior year-and she did this
without making any effort for it, either.

The difference between those two years was
merely a difference in fatigue. Consecutive
fatigue in the one case had "let down" the
girl's whole personality-mentally, morally,
physically; in the other case, the personality
was lifted. In that junior year she was not
only a better person-she was a different per-
son. She possessed happiness, independence,
and self-control. She belonged to another
level of civilization, one which not only held
the lower things in subjection, but added higher
things thereto.

Fatigue has a definite order in which it
knocks us to pieces. It begins at the top and
works down. I have spoken of this before,
but I want to emphasize it.

EFFECT OF FATIGUE ON MEMORY

In minor ways, we observe the workings of
the principle in ourselves every time we get
thoroughly tired. The fmst thing that slips
out of our control is the power or strength or
skill that we have most recently acquired;
earlier acquisitions stick by us longer. A tired
man will stumble in speaking a foreign lan-
guage, while still able to talk English readily.
School-children at the multiplication-table stage
of their education will, when tired, forget their
advanced tables long before they slip up on
the earlier ones-not because the later tables
have not been successfully committed to mem-
ory, but because they have not sunk in so
deeply; they are not "ingrained" yet. The
earlier table rattles off with the facility of a
perfect reflex; the later ones still involve a
certain conscious effort.

I have seen the same thing repeatedly in
musicians. After severe muscular exertion,
they would still be able to play correctly
difficult pieces that they had long been
familiar with; but they failed entirely with
simple things that they had been recently
working on and constantly practising. Under
similar circumstances, I have noticed dancers
forget their more newly practised steps.

These people could all do something more
difrrcult than the thing they were unable to do;
but the more difficult thing had been learned
earlier and had become thoroughly mechanized
-more like an instinct, which never fails to
"do the rest" when the button is touched.

Now take the racial side of it. Some of the
elements that enter into the making of us are

as old as life itself-hunger, for example, the
sexual instinct, self-interest, fear, and the like.
Those are rock-bottom things. It is on the
basis of them that countless generations of
community life and parental responsibility
have built up a superstructure of finer qualities:
unselfishness, for example, devotion to an
idea (such as the God-idea), chastity, self-
control, judgment. These are acquisitions
that have been fought and suffered for, and we
only hold on to them by constant struggle.

But when we are fatigued, we don't struggle
very ardently. All these less-secure holdings
are promptly attacked and demoralized.
Fatigue lowers our control-ability far sooner
than it lowers our anger-ability.

Tired men go on sprees. That is one result
of overwork.

Just as fatigue lessens our ability to with-
stand diseases-which attack the physical
manwso it lessens our ability to withstand
temptations, which attack the moral man.
This is not because the temptations are more
numerous, but because there is less energy of
resistance. The fact that typhoid fever takes
hold of people who are overworked is not
because overworked people drink a greater
number of typhoid bacilli in their milk, but
because the white crorpuscles in their blood are
not vigorous enough. They are without resist-
ance power.

The girl I was speaking of had gone back
whole epochs in the history of civilization.
The fear that had laid hold of her was
the world-old racial fear-the fear of the
dark. And she had nothing to withstand it
with, having lost her self-control through
fatigue. Instinct had supplanted reason in such
matters.

Fatigue promptly attacks and undermines
our sense of proportion. I know of no better
illustration of this than the way we will leave
our professional work. When I am really
fatigued, it is very difficult for me to go home
when the time comes. It is, of course, true
that there are always little things remaining
to be done; but when I am especially tired,
I cannot distinguish between those which are
important enough to keep me and those which
are not. I only see how many things there
are still undone; and I tend to go on and on.

If I see a scrap of paper on the Mor, I cannot
help going out of my chair and taking time to
pick up that wretched thing and put it in my
waste-basket. It assumes, somehow, the same
