INVESTING A SAVINGS BANK FUND

Of course, there is practically no chance in
such an investment for any very large profits.
It is true that the bonds are convertible into
Pennsylvania Railroad stock on any November
1st or May Ist, if the holder has given notice
a month in advance. If one decided to make
that exchange, he would receive 700 in stock
for his $ 1,000 in bonds. The consequence is
that if the stock should during the next five
years sell at a price higher than I40 per cent.
of its par value, the bonds would probably sell
higher than par also. The company can retire
them at 102% and interest on any interest day,
but must give notice ninety days in advance.
These facts give to the investment just the
slightest touch of a speculative value. It is
not at all against the issue.

This form of investment is covered at some
length, because it seems to fit a larger propor-
tion of the inquiries than any other form of
investment of which we have knowledge. Yet
there are a few such savers of money who in.
sist on getting a permanent investment to yield
them 7 per cent., or some other high rate. It
is wise to hesitate before encouraging anyone
to take money out of the bank to try and get a
high return from it. It is possible to get 7
per cent. with a great deal of safety, but usually
one cannot at the same time have the money
in a form from which it may be recovered
quickly, as it can from the bonds. There are
a few preferred industrial stocks, small issues
on great corporations that pay dividends on
their common stocks and have done so for
years, that are desirable-but they are few.
We know of practically no bonds that yield so
high a return into which small savings should
be sunk.

The depositor who has from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000
in the banks is usually more confident in his
search for investments than is the smaller
investor. In most cases that have come to us,
the depositor has made former investments.
In giving advice to such depositors, it is not at
all unusual this year to advise the purchase of
a block of notes yielding over 6 per cent. if
held to maturity. There is a great vatiety of
these notes at the present time, and if the buyer
goes to a solid banking house he runs little
risk of getting anything that will go wrong.
No one can imagine a condition of affairs that
will compel the Pennsylvania, the New York
Central, the Louisville & Nashville, the North
American Company, or the Atlantic Coast
Line to fail to pay th: interest and principal

9280

of their notes that fall due in the next few vears.
The main disadvantage of these mics is
their short term, compelling anothe. im: strnent
in three years or so. Of course, it they were
not so short they would not give so much
revenue. The savings bank depositor may
find it worth while to make the investment
merely for the three years, figuring that the
6 per cent. is quite enough inducement. If
at the end of the three years there is nothing
else worth doing in the line of investment, he
can put his money back into the bank and
count himself a gainer by the additional interest.

From the above, the policy of THE WORLD's
WORK in giving advice to this class of investors
may be pretty clearly judged. Under the
restrictions noted, the range of possible invest-
ment covers these securities:
High-class bonds.

High-class stocks A
Notes.... _

. yield 4 to 5%
_ yield 4 to 7%
.. yield 4hto 61%

Very few industrial common stocks are
advisable for even the best-versed of these
investors. Railroad stocks should be bought
only with the nicest discrimination, and only at
a time when the yield is very high and the
dividends are secure, so far as well-versed men
may judge. Mining stocks and new industrial
promotions should be absolutely barred. Only
in cases where high revenue seems necessmy
should even the better class railroad stocks
and industrials be considered. It should be
understood that the real investor who desn-ss
only perfect safety and stability rather than a
chance for large profits on his principal can-
not, even at this time when bonds are cheap,
get much if any over 5 per cent. on his money.

The average reader may judge for hitrcelf
in what class of investors he belongs. W hen he
has done that, carefully weighing and con-
sidering his own fmances, the responsibilities
that rest upon him, the possible calls upon his
capital that he will have to meet within the
next few years and his ability to meet them, then
he is properly in a position to draw his money
from the savings bank and invest it, If he is
at all uncertain on any of these points, he
should not become an investor except in the
most conservative way. For the savings bank
account is not merely a method of saving money;
it is also an anchor to windward. So long as
there is the slightest chance that it will be
needed in that capacity it should not be de-
pleted, even though the interest return is low
and the growth of the principal extremely slow.
