Federal Government against the Ameri-

can Tobacco Company and its subsidiary
corporations, if other moans of preventing
'estraint of trade fail the court is asked to
"appoint receivers to take possession of all the
assets of the various companies, and, if neces'-
ry, to wind them up."
This newly proposed weapon to prevent
trusts from restraining trade-the weapon of
a reccivcrship-is, of course, yet to be trietl.
The court has not, when this is written, al-
lowed its use; and no. such new attack can be
effectively made until the Supreme Court of
the United States shall pass judgment on it;
and it is not yet by any means certain that such
a case will ever be brought before that court.
On the soundness of this method of procedure,
of course the courts themselves must pass. It
may conceivably be a perfectly sound method
of punishing combinations in restraint of trade,
for the attorneys for the Government are law-
ycrs of repute and experience. But the Joice
of methods of legal procedure and even the
decisions of courts are affected hy the public
mood; and the proposal of such l pk n has had
a singular effort on public discussion and
opinion.

The whole commercial world firmly holds
to the usual conception of It receirership-as
a method of dealing with a business that has
failed. The proposal to use it as Ft punish-
ment is a new conception to the lay mind; and
the proposal to use it as a punishment for
"success" (financial sure _ at 1am) seems
to a large part of the business rommun y
either fantastic or fanatical.

Such it judgment may be utterly erroneous;
but it has been taken by the financial and
political enemies and victims of the Adminis-
tration as an occasion to decry the President
and his policy of corporation-regulation. An-
other such excuse is the extreme length to which
some of the states have gone in enacting and in
enforcing (for the time being) absurd regulative
statutes which will not stand the test of the
courts. "The whole movement has gone too
fur!" "You see the inevitable result!" Such
remarks as these are more frequently heard
than at any time since Mr. Roosevelt became
President. The opposition to the regulation
of corporations hopes that a tide of public
opinion is turning in their favor.

Hardly. And now appears one of many
good results of Mr. Roosevelt's taking himself
out of the next Presidential contest. If he
were a candidate now, or if he could accept a
renomination, the discussion of this central
subject of the regulation of corporations might
possibly be shunted off the main track of the
public thought. It might be labeled "Roose
vcltism-personar"; and ut least an effort
would be made to have it regarded as a merely
personal policy. Mr. Roosevelt does deserve
the personal cru it for making it the dominant
subject of politics; but it is not it merely pet'-
sonal contention. There is a great principle
involved. The people have laid hold on it,
and alisurtl efforts to apply it will not loosen
their hold.

The service that the President has done is
clear to men who think beyond to-morrow and
back of yesterday. Six 0r Stéven years ago the
great corporations almost openly rrmtrolled
