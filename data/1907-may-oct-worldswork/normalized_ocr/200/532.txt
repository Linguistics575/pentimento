9330 RUNNING A RIVER THROUGH A MOUNTAIN

The engineers gryolhumorcdly look upon liv,
ing ctt River Portal as a kind of affliction, but it
is far more attractive than the resorts farther
up the river where people pay money to stay.
The records show that these men are working
for the Government at least as well as men work
for private contractors. A day in either of

hills to the Uncompuhgre River. if l were not
overshadowed by the great 6-mile tunnel,
this canal would seem like a large undertaking,
for it goes through a rough, broken country.
Eighteen miles from the Gunnison River the
canal will deliver 1,300 cubic feet of water a

the camps would convince any observer of
this. Men in the engineer's office are
taking the junior clerical examinations for
salaries of $ 75 a month, when the "muckers"
in the tunnel are getting $ 90.

From the Lujane end of the tunnel the
water is carried by a Iermile canal with 2,000
feet of tunnels through the scarified adobe foot-

that stream able to water 203 square miles of
its valley. That land is now a sun-baked
desert. When the water is turned on, it will
be as rich as the valleys of Pennsylvania or
Ohio. The canal drops 214 feet in its course,
which means that none of the valley farms
need be without cheap electricity.
