FRICK, THE SILENT

retirmg figures, before men realized the signifi-
cance of his two appearances. But just now
he is beginning again to emerge, this time in
the full stature of the powerful financier.

The other appearances were at two important
crises of his life. The first, at the time of the
Homestead strike in Pennsylvania, had in it
the seeds of the bitter rivalry with Mr. Andrew
Carnegie that haunts him to-day. The second,
at the first disclosures of corruption within the
Equitable Life Assurance Society, was at the
time when he made an ambitious alliance with
Mr. Harriman.

The Pennsylvania Railroad handles one
fourth of the freight in transit in the United
States at any given moment. Mr. Frick is
the largest stockholder in the Pennsylvania.
The United States Steel Corporation is the
greatest industrial combination in the United
States. Mr. Frick is in practical control of the
policies of the company.

MR. FRICK m PRIVATE LIFE

He was only fifty-seven years old last Deeem-
ber. Mr. Harriman was fifty-nine years old
last February. But Mr. Frick is much younger
for he has a powerful constitution. Mr.
Frick is one of the "Pittsburg millionaires;"
but he seems to have none of the particular
qualities that have made of some of them a
jest and of others a stumbling block. He is
known in Pittsburg as "the Silent Man."
His home life is described by his friends as
ideal: quiet and devoted. He is a member of
the clubs, but not a club man. His personal
habits are methodical and fastidious, but simple
almost to austerity. No breath of any censure
of his private life is even whispered in the most
gossipy places of Pittsburg, where he has lived
for more than thirty years. His one indul-
gence is a passion for flowers, and his favorite
is the Chrysanthemum. His philanthropies are
not yet great, by comparison with the lavish-
ness of other wealthy man, but their true bulk
is hidden by the fact that most of them are
dispensed through a friend who is pledged to
keep their source a secret.

On the other side of his life Mr. Frick is a
business man-in the homely phrase, "from
the ground up." He went into business at
sixteen, and he has pursued it with unflagging
zeal for forty-one years. The only indulgence
he has allowed himself in that pursuit has been
a passion to out-top Mr. Carnegie in every-
thing in which Mr. Carnegie takes pride for

preeminence, and that passion still possesses
him. It will appear later in this story.

Henry Clay Frick was born in West Overton,
Westmoreland County, Pa., Dec. 19, 1849.
His father, John W. Frick, had been a farmer
in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but at the time of
H. C. Frick's birth he was working as an en-
gineer in the mill owned by Abraham Overholt,
at Broad Ford, Pa. John w. Frick's wife
was Abraham Overholt's daughter, and H. C.
Frick was born in Mr. Overholt's house. He
was the second of five children-thrs boys
and two girls. John W. Frick died many years
ago, but Mrs. Frick only a few years ago at the
age of eighty-six.

The elder Frick was a failure in business.
As a result young Henry Clay was practically
adopted into the Overholt family when he was
about twelve years old. He had a few years
of common school at West Overton, a short
term at the Chester Military Academy, and a
few months at the Otterbein University in
Ohio. That completed his education, except
what he gained afterward by a studious devo,
tion to books as a recreation from business.

At sixteen, however, young Frick was tired
of schools. He was eager to be in business.
Through his grandfather's influence he was
placed as a clerk in the store of White, Orr &
Company, merchants. A little later he entered
his grandfather's distillery as bookkeeper.
From this position he went to Morgan &
Company, coke dealers, and at about twenty-
one years of age he appeared in Pittsburg as
their agent. A year or two later he joined a
company to build the Mt. Pleasant and Broad
Ford Railroad, a short line to penetrate the
Connellsville coke region. The road was
opened in 1871. It was a success. That was
the basis of the Frick fortune.

ENTERS THE COKE BUSINESS

These were the beginnings of Mr. Frick's
interest in the coke business, to which he gave
his undivided attention until 1882. In 1871,
the year the Mt. Pleasant and Broad Ford
Railroad was opened, Mr. Frick organized
the corporation of Frick & Company, coke
dealers, with the help of Mr. Abraham o.
Tintsman, one of his grandfather's partners.
This coke company bought 300 acres of soft
coal lands and Sr coke ovens in the Connells-
ville region, and a year later added "150 ovens
to its equipment.

Then came the panic of'73. Everywhere
