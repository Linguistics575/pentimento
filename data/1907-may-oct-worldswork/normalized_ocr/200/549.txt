THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL FATIGUE

In the end you have lost far more than mere
time. You have lost the energy of a good start;
you have been making a long, slow, dribbling
expenditure of your will power; and when
you finally get to the job itself, you are already
out of temper for it; your mind has grown
soggy.

Of course such is not the result in every case.
It takes some people a long time to get warmed
up to an undertaking; they always have to go
through that period of preliminary fuss and
bother. When this is actually true, economy
certainly requires such a man, once he is under-
way, to keep up steam on a long stretch; not to
let down until he has a positive accomplish-
ment to show. He cannot afford to have to
put himself through those first costly and pain-
ful steps again; it's an inexcusable extrava-
ganee.

Most of us Americans, however, have the
ability-if we will only take advantage of it--
to jump into a job quickly and hard without
dawdling over the preliminaries. Therefore,
it's the only right way for us to do. A man
who takes his hard jobs on this principle will
be likely to carry them through, for he makes
the attack while his mind is fresh and clear,
with a good cutting edge on it. Afterward,
if he like, he can give himself the luxury of
dawdling.

Economy of the will requires that, so far as
possible, a man should push his job through to
a finish when once he has undertaken it. To
some sort of a finish: if not the whole job, then
some complete separate part of it, something
definite, that can count as a bundle by itself,
and which, when it is tied up, is really out oi
the way. Don't break things off in the middle.
Don't keep having to get at a thing. When
you have to take your attention by the scruff
of the neck every minute or two and force it
back on the scent, you are making a terrible
and useless drain on your will power.

Another practical conclusion is this: As
far as possible, bunch the little things you have
to do so as to make one larger job of them.
If you can make a list of the minutiae that need
attention, and then go at them with a running
start, the end will be reached-not necessarily
quicker yet certainly with a tremendous saving
of energy. You don't need to issue your
manifesto before annihilating each separate
petty enemy; you can include them all in the
same warrant.

bear in mind. Keep decision power for things
that are worth deciding. Then it won't fail
you when you need it.

EFFECT OF FATIGUE ON CHARACTER

When a man is fatigued, he is literally a
different person from his ordinary normal self.
The qualities that go into his making-up are
not the same qualities: his disposition, his tastes,
his intellectual faculties, are all shifted. He
still carries some of his "recognition marks"
around with him-such triiles as bodily struc-
ture, hair, history, and clothes-but he ought
not to use the same visiting card.

Into my own experience has come this case
of a young college girl, and it is not an excep-
tional case, either: Through her freshman
year she did unusually good work; she stood
in the upper quarter of her class-a normal,
high-spirited, energetic young person of seven-
teen years.

During the summer following that first year,
she worked very hard, rising every morning
at five o'clock-for they had no domestic, and
she always aimed to surprise her mother by
getting the washing and ironing out of the way
herself. She made all her own clothes for the
year to come. During that whole vacation,
she kept herself under this strain.

Then she went back to college. She had
never been a timid girl; but now, oddly
enough, she suddenly developed a terrible fear
of going upstairs to her room alone. Some
one always had to go with her. She would
look under her bed, behind the door, in the
closet. The thing kept her awake at night.
She stood low in her classes, but that did not
seem to make any difference to her; she ap-
peared to have lost all interest in her marks.
She neglected her studies in a way that com-
pletely bewildered her friends. She had made
up her mind to enjoy herself at all costs; and
she succeeded wretchedly. It was a miserable,
unhappy year. You would not have recog-
nized her as the girl of the year before.

Another summer came. She had a perfect
vacation. Most of the time she lived out of
doors in camp, sleeping well, eating heartily,
dressing comfortably, taking plenty of moderate
exercise with wholesome companions.

Back in college once more-she was a junior
now-she took the lead in her class. There
was not the slightest trace of that fear of the
dark; she never thought of hesitating to go up-
stairs alone. She had a splendid time all
