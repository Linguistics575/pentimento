TRANSP0RTING FURS BY DOG TRAIN OVER AN ALASKAN TRAIL

When one leaves the trade side of the ques-
tion and studies furs in themselves, the subject
is as fascinating, as the study of diamonds. Of
the expensive furs, none is better known or
more universally used than Persian lamb; and
about none are there more absurd errors cur-
rent. One of the errors almost universally
believed is that the curliest arul glossiest and
blackest Persian lamb is obtained by killing
the mother to get the unborn kid. This is
sheerest nonsense. The great desideratum
in Persian lamb is to avoid the prevailing
reddish tinge that can be seen by holding the
fur up between you and the light. Germans
excel in the dyes of all sheep skins, owingiit
is said-to a quality in the waters of German
rivers and to the mineral properties of German
clays. But it need hardly be explained that
a pelt which is a beautiful jet black before
dressing will be a finer skin for the market than
the reddish pelt that has to be made black.
What owner of a herd of Persian sheep would
be such a fool (is to kill a sheep that produced
these finest black lambs? It is to his interest
to keep her alive that she may produce more
lambs, and to take the very best care of her.
Besides, if the lambs 2111: allowed to grow the
pelts will be larger.

I asked Revillon Fr√©rcs, who have large
sheep farms at Bokhara, in Persia, to supply
their Paris trutle: "Do you ever, umlcr uny
circumstances, slay the mother to gut a good
pelt from the unlmm kid?"

"No, never!" he answered. "The Wily
that false impression has arisen about Persian
lamb is this: when the summer heat becomes

great, herders drive their sheep from the valleys
to the cooler heights of the mountains. On
the road, sometimes, a ewe dies of exhaustion.
Then, of course, the drovers take the pelt of
both mother and kid."

Shiraz is known as the half-Persian lamb.
It comes from the south of Persia. The pelt
is curly but coarser, more like wool than fur.
Much of this is bought for high-grade Astrakhan
