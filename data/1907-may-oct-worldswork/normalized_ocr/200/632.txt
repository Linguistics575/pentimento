of contract. Certainly to an American com-
pany it would seem to bear but bony pickings.

THE ELECTRICITY COMPROMISE

Electric light and electricity for general use
went the same way. The Council had a com-
mision at work on these subjects and the com-
mission reported that the price of electricity
was extortionately high; that electricity had
remained a luxury for the Paris rich, whereas
it should have been a convenience for all
classes; that the greed of the companies stood
between the public and new inventions and
improvements; and that as the end of the
franchises approached the companies were
contracting the service and abusing public
patience. To remedy these evils, the Council
proposed that the city should take over the
electric lighting business and abolish private
ownership. Once more it encountered the
opposition of the Senate, and once more it
resorted to a temporary compromise. Con-
tracts have been prepared for a revocable
license to the companies, covering a nominal
period of twenty-six years. The companies
thus allowed to do business must extend
their lines wherever, whenever, and in
such manner as the city shall direct. The
city is divided into six sections, with one
exploiter, under municipal supervision, in each
section. Beginning with next year, each com-
pany is to pay the city 10 per cent. of its annual
receipts, the percentage to be increased with
increasing business. The city has the right
to buy at any time the whole system of distribu-
tion, stations, sub-stations, branch-lines, and
the rest, the price to be the actual cost of con-
struction, plus 10 per cent. for general expenses
and minus one twenty-fifth of the whole for
each year of service. Beginning in 1924, the
city will have an annual right, upon certain
conditions, to cancel the contract.

CITY-OWNED PUBLIC UTILITIES

Paris has now six main lines of underground
railroad completed or in construction, and has
planned a wonderful network of other lines
radiating to every quarter of the city, on both
sides of the Seine. The building of these lines
is a municipal undertaking; the operating
is by a company to which the city has granted
the temporary rights. The company pays to
the city an enormous rental, arranged on the
traffic. Thus, for every second-class ticket,
price three cents, the company pays one cent,

THE HUMANITARIAN RULE IN PARIS

with a minimum of 130,000,000 second-class
passengers a year; on early morning return
tickets (commutation), price four cents, it
pays one cent; on every first-class ticket, price
five cents, it pays two cents.

Two private companies are constructing
underground railroads in Paris, but under
municipal control and supervision. They will
pay one-fifth of a cent for every ticket sold, up
to 30,000,000, and a slightly increased tax for
every additional ticket. As with the other
lines, the whole institution becomes city prop-
erty at the end of the franchise; but in this
instance the city reserves the right to purchase
in 1924.

Such of the street railroad lines as have
ancient foundations will be secured by the city
without much trouble. To these the Empire
gave franchises of fifty years but, when the
Republic came in, it generally reduced the
term to thirty years or thereabouts. Franchises
of both the Empire and the Republic will soon
begin to expire and the franchises explicitly
provided for the city's possession of the lines
when the terms of the grants should lapse. Not
only the lines, but all the immovable possessions
of the companies are to be surrendered; plants,
power houses, poles, wires, office buildings,
and stations become city property without
legislation and without purchase. Most of the
omnibus franchises expire five years hence.
They have the same conditions and will pass
to the city in the same inexpensive manner.
Whether the Senate will seek to interfere with
the city's operation of these properties is un-
certain. In 1924 the last of the street railroad,
motor line, and omnibus franchises will fall in.
By that year the Council expects to see the most
stupendous plan of interurban transportation
ever known in any city, a system to comprise all
forms of transit-undcrground and surface
electric railroads, motor lines, compressed-air
vehicles, omnibuses, and river boats-covering
every comer of Paris, with a system of universal
transfers, all owned and operated by the city
and all furnishing cheap, frequent, and con-
venient service. That is the plan. And if
there are any air-ship lines in practical operation
by that time, the Council will want them too.

For several years now the humanitarian
element in Paris has been gaining strength in
the popular elections. The gravest question
seems to be how long a majority of the Par-
isians will be satisfied to allow themselves to
be turned back by the Senate wall.
