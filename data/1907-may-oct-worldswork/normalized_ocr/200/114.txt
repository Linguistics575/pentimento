all the plants and other tangible property of
the gas and the electric companies cost less
than one-quarter of the stock and bonds they
had issued, and that they were paying in
interest and dividends more than 20 per cent.
on their real investment. From this he went
on to examine the cost of producing and dis-
tributing gas, with the result that it was
apparent that dollar gas paid 90 per cent.
gross profit.

These facts were collected in a logical report.
The legislature accepted its conclusions and
passed bills reducing the price of gas to
eighty cents, and in like manner cutting down
the price of electric light and power. There
was also created a state commission whose
approval was made necessary to any further
issue of stock and bonds, and standards of
candle-power and inspection were provided
that the public might get what they paid for.

THE INSURANCE INVESTIGATION

The next legislature, stirred by the
Alexander-Hyde quarrel in the Equitable
Life'Assurance Society, provided for a general
insurance investigation. That committee nat-
urally selected Mr. Hughes as its chief counsel.
In his important insurance work, Mr. Hughes
pursued the same persistent policy as in the
gas investigation. He refused to be diverted
from any phase of the subject until he had
exhausted its possibilities and he wholly de-
clined to depart from the subject of insurance
to go into other matters, either of politics or of
ethics. For this reason, when the examination
of Mr. George W. Perkins and the statements
of Presidents McCall and McCurdy had revealed
payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars
of the policy-holders' money to political com-
mittees, Mr. Hughes refused to call either
Chairman Cortclyou or Treasurer Blission
the ground that the legitimate scope of his
inquiry included only the misuse of the policy-
holders' money and to what purposes it was
put, and that what the campaign committee
did with it was not germane. For the same
reasons, after it had been brought out that
the "Big-Three" life insurance companies
maintained lobby funds and that millions of
dollars had been expended by their lobby
agents to influence members of the legislature
throughout the United States, Mr. Hughes
did not undertake to convict the recipients
of bribery and to turn the insurance investi-
gation into a general political house-cleaning.

GOVERNOR HUGHES-NOW AND LATER

He stuck to his one specific object and that
was to disclose what methods and practices
of the New York insurance companies were
wrong, and to devise legislation that would
prevent, so far as legislation could prevent, a
continuance or a recurrence of insurance wrong
doing. By adhering to this policy, he secured
a unanimous report of the legislative committee,
two at least of whose members might have been
involved had the distribution of the lobby
money been traced to its ultimate recipients;
and the legislature, many of whose members
were of notoriously corrupt affiliations, passed
without weakening amendment all of the bills
which Mr. Hughes drafted. This was a record
for accomplishment never surpassed by any
prior legislative investigation in New York.
The reason for Mr. Hughes's success was his
ingrained policy of sticking to the specific
object in view and deviating therefrom neither
to make political capital nor to distinguish
himself as a showy and sensational lawyer.

MR. HUGHES 1N POLITICS

His conduct in these two investigations won
for Mr. Hughes the confidence of the people
of his state. At that time New York politics
was undergoing one of its occasional periods
of ebullition. Mr. William R. Hearst had,
the preceding year, been an Independent candi-
date for mayor of New York City on the plat-
form that both the old political parties were
corrupt and that their bosses were owned by
the public-service corporations; and that he,
if elected, would give the public what they
wanted-a better street-car service and lower
fares, fifty-cent gas, model tenement houses
and lower rents, an eight-hour working day
and union wages, municipal ownership and
operation of public franchises, and the over-
throw of corporate politics. On election day,
Mr. Hearst polled a great many votes, so many
that for more than an hour the returns stopped
coming in, and after considerable delay the
official announcement was made that Mr. Mc-
Clellan was reelected by less than 4,000
plurality. Mr. Hearst had no election inspec-
tors and his machinery for checking up the
vote was incomplete. He at once raised the
cry of fraud and took legal proceedings to
recount the votes.

The hundreds of thousands of men who
voted for him believed that he had been cheated
and many thousands of men who did not vote
for him believed that he was entitled to a
