First, the engineers mapped out a system of
roads so that each mile prepared by the steam,
roller would form part of the entire system.
It was estimated that the cost of road con-
struction would average $ 10,000 a mile; yet
we have added 327 miles to the 171 already in
operation, and we have been spending
$ 200,000 tt year to keep these roads in good
condition. In addition, pressure has been
brought to bear on the municipalities and they
have spent about $ 75,000 a year on local roads.
But this is only part of what has been donc.
Dr. W. F. Willoughby, the Treasurer of Porto
Rico, reports that bonds to the amount of
SI, ooo, ooo have not only been authorized
but actually sold, and that this large sum
will presently be available for road construc-
tion.

To appreciate what 327 miles of ncwmacad,
amized road mean to Porto Rico, it is neces~
sary to understand the conditions that con-
fronted us nine years ago. There was but one
good road of importance in the island-the

's military road from San Juan to Ponce, with a
branch to Guayama. All the other roads in
the island, according to one of the military
governors, could be classified only according to
degrees of badness. Next to the act of leaving
Porto Rico, the construction of this road was
the best thing that the Spanish ever did for the
island. It has been called "the finest road in
the Western Hemisphure," is about eighty
miles long, cost $ 15,000 a mile, and is an
automobile road all the way. The manner in

which it climbs the mountains by graceful
curves is a tribute to Spanish engineering.

There were also short stretches of cart road,
which were impassable at times. Such ms
the road from Ponce to Adjuntas, on which I
once saw an empty two-wheeled cart and ten
oxen stalled in the mud; and the road to Vauco,
on which my horse once went to the top of the
saddle in a pool of slimy mud. It is a matter of
otlicial record, tcstifrcd to by the Porto Rican
Secretary of the Interior and vouched for by
a Special Commissioner, that oxen are some-
times drowned in the mud.
