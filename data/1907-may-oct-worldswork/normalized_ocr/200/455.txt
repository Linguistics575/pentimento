SCHOOL-CHILDREN IN

per cent. fu1ished it in just eight years. Thus
it will be seen that 87 per cent. finished on time,
or in less than the regular time.

Under the usual plan, millions of pupils
are bound in chain-gangs and compelled to
walk in intellectual lock-step for their whole
school lives. Once each year a shackle is
opened and those able to pass to higher work
are allowed to move on and be bound to those
left over in the next grade. Still shackled,
they spend year after year trying to drag others
or being pulled along by others. Under
the new plan suggested, there is freedom of
opportunity for every pupil, the progress of
each being determined only by his application
and ability.

Under the usual plan, the pupils whose
development is slower, or who cannot keep
pace with the brightest, drag along at the foot
of the class, and, regardless of thoroughness,
are rushed over the work. They fall behind,
stumble for a time at the foot and then, mis-
understood, unappreciated, and discouraged,
drop out of school. They have lost the con-
fidence of their teachers and are no longer
encouraged by the confidence of their parents.
Infinitely more are they to be pitied because
they have lost all confidence in their own
ability. Under the now plztn, pupils who
naturally move slower are not hurried, but
move steadily towards the higher grades at a
slower rate. All who have studied the records
acknowledge that these frequently make the
best citizens and win the highest successes in
life.

It is little less than criminal to compel pupils
differing greatly in ability and attainments to
walk in intellectual lock-step for months and
years; it is an outrage to compel tuachers to
hurry forward the slow or to hold back the
bright; and to force many out of school, after
having, destroyed their wlf-voniidencc and
condemned them to lives of ignorance, if not
worse, is a barbarism that should not be
tolerated. T

That the appalling effects of the old method
are beginning to be appreciated is amply
proven by the statements of leading, educators,
and by editorial endorsements of my plan by
500 of the leading papers of the United States.

SCHOOL CONDITIONS IN PHILADELPHIA

The following extract is from an editorial

in the Philadelphia Public I I'tlger, dealing with
the conditions of the schools in that city-

LOCK-STEP 9253

"There is in the United States a city only 72% of whose
children attend the public schools. of these, only seven-
tenths of 1% pass through the high school; only 4.3%
reach it. Eighty-four per cent. leave before they have gene
half-way through the grammar school. Si
go only through the primary grades; 53% Stop at the

"The city in question is Facing a future in which there
is no assurance that one-quarter of its population will be
able to write their names; or more than half its population
be able to read--

or do such simple sums as can be counted on the fingers;
or one-eighth possess the merest rudiments of knowledge;
or one in twenty-three have mastered the common branches;
or one in 143 have availed themselves fully at the education
provided by the state, The city is Philadelphia.

"At the solicitation of the Public Ledger, William J.

Shearer, a well-known educational expert engaged in a
study of public school conditions throughout the United
States, has made a particular inrcstigation of conditions
obtaining in this city. The results are well-nigh incredible
but, being beyond doubt, they afford reason for the most
humiliating reOcticons and call for instant resolution to
seek for the causes of a condition so terrifying."

Without any solicitation on my part, I have
been employed to make investigations and to
suggest remedies for acknowledged defects in
New York, Boston, and other cities. Facts
established by these investigations and by
personal visits to the schools of a hundred
towns and cities between Chicago and New
York and Boston and New Crlzans, prove
that the conditions in Philarlelp' t'l a but little
worse than those in other parts of r': country.
In spite of the work done by our 1' llC schools
and the great improvement in methods of
instruction, which place the public far ahead of
private schools, the friends of the schools must
acknowledge that there is something radically
wrong with the method of organization which
produces such unsatisfactory results as those
mentioned.

CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK CITY

To show existing conditions more Clearly,
it may be well to consider some of the facts
concerning a particular city, such as New
York, as conditions there are typical. The
report of its superintendent contains much
which others have not rlztretl to publish. If
tdl reports called attention to the large
number of pupils falling behind yearly,
and the small number reaching the higher
grades, the friends of the schools would long
