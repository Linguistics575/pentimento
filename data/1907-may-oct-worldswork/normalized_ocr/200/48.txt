THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL MOVING PICTURES OF WILD ANIMALS IN THEIR NATIVE
HAUNTS: A COW-MOOSE

The cow-mouse allowed the moving-picture machine, mounted on the bow of a canoe, to approach within

13 feet before she ran. When she did move, she made such speed that she got out of the field of the camera.

This accounts for the short break in the series, as it required some seconds to swing the canoe and bring her

once mnre within its scope. Then she came straight toward the canoe, which was pushed against the bank. She

was "ithin ten or twelve feet of the camera before she became frightened again and ran in the opposite direction.
