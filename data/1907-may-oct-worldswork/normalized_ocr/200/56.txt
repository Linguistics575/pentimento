tion with the strikers, walked into Mr. Frick's
private office, drew a revolver, and fired. The
bullet lodged in Mr. Frick's neck. Mr. Frick
rushed at him, and a second bullet stopped him.
Struggling to his knees, Mr. Frick grappled
with him. In. the struggle, Berkmann stabbed
him three times in the side and thigh. But
Mr. Frick at length downed his larger assailant
and held him until the police came. When
the doctors probed his wounds, Mr. Frick
directed them to the bullets. Then, lying on
a sofa, he completed the business he had had in
hand when the struggle began, before he allowed
the doctors to carry him home. Thirteen days
later he walked into his office unattended, and
resumed the work of fighting the strike. His
doctors ascribe his quick recovery to his tre-
mendous force of will.

The strikers were not yet beaten. Through
the summer, and until November arst, the
battle raged. The leader was unmoved
equally by the renewal of violence, the protests
of the public, and the distress of the families
of the strikers. He won, and apparently he
has never begrudged the price of victory. The
issues raised and the public passions aroused
by his prolonged battle helped defeat Benja-
min Harrison for President. This defeat
brought him the bitter hatred of the Re-
publican leaders. But throughout the storm
Mr. Frick was the Silent Man, satisfied that
he had done the thing he started out to do.

BREACH WITH MR. CARNEGIE

His success had in it the seeds of discord
between himself and Mr. Carnegie. Much
as Mr. Carnegie complimented him upon his
great services to the company, he could not
fail to realize that Mr. Frick had won a
place of greater power in the Carnegie Corn-
pany than any other man besides Mr. Carnegie
had ever had. The compliments took this form
upon Mr. Carnegie's return to Pittsburg early
in 1893, in a public statement issued by him:
"And now a word about IL. Frick..
Of his ability, fairness, and pluck no one has
the slightest question. His four years' man-
agement stamps him as one of the foremost
managers of the world. I would not exchange
him for any manager I know." Six years
later, when Mr. Erick tried to buy out Mr.
Carnegie's interests, Mr. Carnegie resented
the menace to his supremacy and tried to oust
Mr. Frick bodily from the business.

But for the moment peace was upon the steel

industry. Mr. Frick returned to the task
of making the Carnegie Steel Company,
Limited, preeminent in the world's steel
markets. The fmst step toward that achieve-
ment was to weld closer together the scattered
plants of the company. This he did by build-
ing the Union Railway, which connects all the
plants with one another and with the railroad
lines entering Pittsburg. This road made it
easy to handle and distribute the 16,000,000
tons of freight annually originated by the
company. The saving in switching charges
alone paid the interest on its cost.

The next step was to assure to the company
a dependable supply of cheap ore. This Mr.
Frick did, after long negotiations and disputes
with Mr. Carnegie, by taking over from the
Oliver Mining Company five-sixths of its
interests in the remarkable open-pit mines of
the Mesabi fields on Lake Superior, and by a
fifty-year lease from the Rockefellers of other
Mesabi mines on a royalty basis with a
guaranteed annual output. The whole deal
guaranteed the steel company for fifty years a
minimum annual supply of I,2oo,00o tons of
ore.

A large proportion of this supply was secured
by Mr. Frick in such a manner that it cost the
company nothing but the inconvenience of
making a loan to the Oliver Mining Company.
The Rockefellers accepted a very low price for
their lease in exchange for the contract to
carry a share of the ore through the lakes on
a line of steamers that they owned.

The last step was taken by Mr. Carnegie,
who arranged to make over and extend the old
Pittsburg, Shenango, and Lake Erie Railroad
to connect the works at Pittsburg with Con-
neaut, the harbor on Lake Erie. The'Camegie
Company also put on a line of steamers to
carry the excess ores over the Rockefcllers'
contract.

Now the organization of the steel business
was complete. The Carnegie Steel Company
owned everything it needed to manufacture
steel, from the unmined ore to the cars in which
it delivered its finished product, and it was
independent of any outsider in the transpor-
tation of any of its materials from the day the
ore was mined to the day its cars bearing its
finished product were delivered over its own
switches to the Pennsylvania Railroad or the
Baltimore & Ohio.

Mr. Frick now saw his future clear before
him. Mr. Carnegie counted his active career
