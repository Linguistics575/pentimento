WILD ANIMAL PHOTOGRA PHY

In July, 1906, Mr. W. H. Wright found a
trail into a swamp where bear went to feed, in
the main range of the Rockies at the southeast

corner of Yellowstone Park. Here he tied
a thread across the trail, so fastened to the
camera that if it were disturbed it would set
off the flashlight powder and open the shutter
of the camera. He then retired some distance
and waited.

"Soon an old she-bear with three little cubs
came down the trail," said Mr. Wright, "but
they were just as cautious as others had
been. Every few feet the old mother bear
would stop and sniff the air, and'the babies
had to do just as she did. If she stood up
on her hind feet, they also stood up. When
the mother bear stopped to sniff the air, they
would run up to her and, placing their tiny
feet against her sides, would peer wisely and
anxiously ahead until the old lady started on
again. When they came to the thread they
stopped short; while the old bear was taking
a good sniff at the cord, her babies stood up
with their fore-feet resting against her body
and waited the result of the sniff. I imagine
it may have been a little different from what
they had expected, for, after satisfying herself
that the obstacle was placed there for no good,
mama gave a lively snort that could have been
heard for a hundred yards and, without waiting
for her babies to get down, she turned tail and
upset the whole lot, disappearing up the trail
like a whirlwind with the little cubs trying
their best to overtake her.
