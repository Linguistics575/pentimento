must be dehaired-that is, the long over-nairs
must be loosened and plucked. Unplucked
nutria is used as imitation seal.

An interesting point with all the soft furs is
that they do not need chemicals. Once they
are dehaired, it remains only to clean them.
That is variously done-by immersion in soft
water, by brushing, by revolving in sawdust

CUB BEAR ON THE TRADER'S WALL

THE FUR TRADE op THE WORLD

tanks, by being tubbed in a huge butter vat and
trodden by half-naked men, the heat of the
human body supplying a natural resolvent and
polishing the fur without spoiling it.

Two of the costliest rare furs are sable and
ermine, though I have heard experts say that
they would prefer a first-class American marten
to any Russian sable except the costliest. The
great hunting fields for the sable are in Kam,
Chatka, Yakutsk and northern China. The
sable is barely nine inches long, including the
tail-brown, dark brown, silver, and black
being the prevailing colors. For a perfect
black pelt of this little creature, as high as
Srio has been paid, though the price runs all
the way from $ 2.50 to $ 75, according to grade.
Of the black sable, seldom more than 25,000
a year come to the markets of the world; of
the commoner red sable, as many as 100,000.
Like the sable, the ermine is as small as one's
finger, and for the purpose of the fur trade is
limited exclusively to the cold regions. And
like the silver fox, it is the subject of stormy
scientific discussions; for when the most per-
fect pelt for whiteness is found on the youngest
kittens just past their ash-colored birth con-
dition, white hair can hardly be explained as
old age or a coat changing for the season. In
southern climates, the ermine is nothing more
than a sulphur-colored, vicious, worthless, little
weasel. In the North, where white is the best
non-conductor of heat from a body, ermine is
king, the best Russian coming from Yakutsk,
the best American from Mackenzie River.
When ermine is sold with black spots instead
of tails, it is the well-known miniver of royal
and noble regalia. The priceless value at-
tached to ermine when it was exclusively a
royal fur no longer rulesithe trapper re-
ceiving all the way from four cents for a spoiled
skin to $ 4 for a perfectly prime one.

MARTEN, MINK, AND OTTER

Closely allied to Russian sable is American
marten, a larger animal of which the fur has
recently so increased in price that is it now one
of the most valuable furs on the traders' list.
More than 100,000 are yearly sold in London, of
which three-quarters come from the Hudson's
Bay Company. For marten, the trapper
receives from $ 5 to $ 35 a pelt. Fisher, or
pekan, a kind of marten the size of a cat, is not
much better than cat if it is not prime, but a
fme specimen is almost equal to marten.

Along with these are the furs of the
