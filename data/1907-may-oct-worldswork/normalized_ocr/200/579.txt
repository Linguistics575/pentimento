AMONG THE WORLD'S WORKERS

of the Gunnison. The Indians believed that
no human being might follow the river through
its dark channel and come out alive. Those
who had made the venture had never emerged
at the other end. Explorers had declared it
unexplorable and a railroad corporation had
decided that the Black Canon were better
avoided. But the district engineer sent this
message to headquarters:

"Immediate preparations will be made for
the exploration of the Gunnison Canon at the

earliest possible date by Fellows and Tor-,

rence."

Instead of a boat, the two engineers took an
inflated rubber mattress to which the provisions
and heavier surveying instruments were lashed.
Record books and the most delicate of their
instruments were strapped to their bodies in
water-proof cases.

They entered the Canon of the Gunnison
and for two days towed their rubber raft
through the rock-strewn stream, followed along
the brink of the precipice by friends. But on
the third day they were swallowed up in the
canon, where measurements and observations
depended no less upon gymnastic than upon
professional skill. During the next ten days,
their progress was at the rate of three miles in
twenty-four hours. Clad in water-soaked gar-
ments, they slept upon damp rocks around
which the river raced.

The banks were so precipitous that most of
the journey was made by stream. Twice they
passed natural bridges, made by columns of
basalt through which the flood had bored.
At length the river disappeared in the crevices
of scores of slippery boulders that lay heaped
in a titanic pile, extending from wall to wall.
On the other side they made this memorandum:
"Twenty yards headway in five hours."

Gradually the canon narrowed to less than
thirty feet and the roar of the torrent became
more intense. The sky became a thin blue
ribbon and the stars were visible in broad
daylight. Though the journey was made in
August, the water was icy cold.

Suddenly the river presented the phenomenon
of a horizon. Here was a fall. The stream
reached it between two abutments. Wading
cautiously, they tried to round these but there
was no hold for feet or hands. They could
not gauge the depth nor see what lay beyond.

"What next?" sl1outal Torrence in Fellows's
ear.

"Overl." responded the senior. "I first!"

9377

The other nodded and the hands met in an
eloquent grip.

Two minutes later Fellows disappeared over
the fall. Torrence gazed at the spot where his
chief had vanished, then plunged after him.
Bruised, bleeding, and dazed, he finally gained
a crag; nearby, in a similar plight, he saw Mr.
Fellows. Looking back at the sixty-foot sheer
fall of water, they realized that there could be
no turning back.

The morning of the eighth day brought them
face to face with starvation. It had been six,
teen hours since they had tasted food and the
canon apparently contained nothing more
edible than leaves and bark. They plodded
on with heavy and painful steps; each hour
their progress became pitifully slower.

But with the extremity of stress they began to
feel a grim enjoyment in the struggle. Strapped
to their bodies was the story they went out to
learn, writ clear to the understanding of any
of their craft:

"The Gunnison tunnel is feasible!
know it, and they shall know!"

Then happened an unusual circumstance.
A frightened mountain sheep bounded straight
into the arms of Torrence, who grappled the
animal with the frenzy of a starving man until
Fellows could get his knife. The food crisis
was ended. Strengthened by their savage feast,
the explorers pushed on into the unknown until
a rocky barrier stopped their way. At this point
the river plunged into a dark tunnel; so far as
the explorers knew, it might be a mile before
it emerged again, possibly through an outlet
not big enough to accommodate a human body.
But the face of the cliff was too smooth and
slippery to be climbed.

"Here goes! Good luck, Bill!" said Fellows,
extending his hand. Torrencc grasped it in
silence. Fellows hitched up his belt and
slipped off the rock into the stream. The
surging waters seized him and turned him over
as he shot into the tunnel, only one foot visible
to his companion.

A conviction that his friend was already
drowned took possession of Terrence. Of
course he would follow, but there was no need
of haste. At last he plunged in but was swept
into the cavern with his head above water.
With extended arms he protected his head from
the jutting rocks and raced through the dark
passage at terrific speed. A few anxious
seconds brought daylight-and he saw Fellows
perched upon a rock in mid-stream.
