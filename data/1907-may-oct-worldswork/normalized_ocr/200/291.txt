A LIGHTHOUSE

hoping to get a bid in competition with others
for that light.

"I left Washington immediately after pre-
seating this petition to Congress, as I considered
my work done, and I supposed Mr. Millis
would forward the matter. Mr. Millis then
went to Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, who
told me that Mr. Millis said that the Govern-
ment could build this lighthouse for $ 80,000;
Mr. Lodge said of course they couldn't make
the appropriation any larger than Mr. Millis
asked, and so the bill was reduced and passed
Congress for that amount.

"Mr. Millis then said:'We have not
sufficient money to build a lighthouse; there-
fore, we will build a lightship, experimentally,
and see if it will stand.' The lightship was
built, and I was thereby cut off from building
my structure.

"I then presented a letter to Senator Frye,
signed by leading commercial men, saying that
a lightship was not satisfactory and that a light-
house should be built there. When it was put
before the Senate, the Lighthouse Board and
the Engineering Secretary stated that the
channel at Pollock Rip was continually shifting
and that a lighthouse would do more harm than
good to navigation.

"I then said;'ls there any other place on
the coast where this light would fit?' The
Engineering Secretary answered that he knew
of none. Senator Mallory, of Florida, who
was on the Committee at that time, then stepped
up to me and said:'It would be worth a
million dollars to the United States if you could
put that light at Cape Hatteras.' I then
changed my bill for Hatteras, and perhaps this
would substantiate my claim of good faith, as
is questioned in the letter.

"I plainly remember, while on this work,
my first meeting with Senator Hoar. Evidently
he knew me, for he held out his hand and, with
a smile, said:'Captain, I am glad to meet you.
I hear you are making an attempt, under very
unfavorable circumstances, to do what I con-
sider a great public work, and you shall have
my assistance in every way in which I can help
you. I met Engineer Eads when he considered
he had failed with Congress in his attempts
on the Mississippi River jetty system. I
think this is a similar instance, and there is a
great similarity in the names Eads and Eells.'
From that time on, he gave me all the assistance
that he possibly could. He wrote letters and
talked with different members and would stop

his work whenever I stepped in to see him. He
not only made addresses in favor of the bill in
the Senate, but also went over to the House and
introduced me to many of the members. Among
them was Mr. Levering, of Massachusetts, who
also worked well for the bill. Mr. Small, of
North Carolina, in whose district this light-
house comes, also personally sought me out
and offered his assistance and said he would
do all in his power to help me, and he gave
valuable time in behalf of this project. Many
times he has left his home and gone to
Washington to attend to this bill. Heintro-
duced it in his own name in the House and
has done all in his power to see the project
carried to completion.

DIRECT APPEAL TO CONGRESS

"After being blocked with the Pollock Rip
bill, I saw there was no other way except to
appeal to Congress to contract direct with me,
and I put in a bill to that effect. It came very
near passing in 1903, but there was some
trouble between the two parties and all private
bills failed to pass, mine among the others.

"The next year, 1904, my bill passed; but
at the last moment a clause was put in which
required the approval of the Lighthouse
Board, and so brought us in with the engineers
again. It appeared to me that they were
determined to prevent any effort in the move-
ment that I might make to commence this
work on the Diamond Shoals Lighthouse.
Although they had made an effort to do this
thing themselves and their plans had failed,
they seemed to be bound that no one else should
make the attempt.

"I followed this bill very closely and called
it to the attention of the different members.
It received a unanimous vote in the Senate, and
finally passed the House with a great majority,
with an appropriation of $ 590,000.

"I was forced to accept this bill as satis,
factory, although the appropriation was not
sufficient and the clause in regard to the Engi-
neering Board was a continuance of the hin-
drance that had fought against me so long.
However, I sent to the Engineering Board and
asked what I should do in preparation of plans
that would be satisfactory, and I sent a drawing
of a foundation for the lighthouse to the Sccre-
tary of Commerce and Labor. That drawing
had the endorsement of Mr. L. L. Buck, Chief
Engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, the Merritt
Wrecking Company, and the Newport News
