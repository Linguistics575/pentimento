THE NEW CAPITOL AT JACKSON, MISS.



A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
STATES

THE CHANGES OF TEN YEARS

BY
WALTER H. PAGE

EN years ago, I made a two-months'
journey through all the Southern

or in clubs or at dinners, either in commercial
circles or in educational circles, the hard times
of the past was still the most frequent topic of
conversation. Men spoke of the burden im-
posed by Reconstruction; they talked about
the difficulties of developing the country with,

expect to be well-iniormed spoke with a sort of
