owned and managed by Southern men, who
make the management of mills their business,
have paid enormously; and they have paid, on
the average, perhaps twice as large dividends as
the mills that are owned in New England.
While outside investors have made and will
make much money exploiting the South, very
much more money has been made and will be
made by local investors in their own home
enterprises. The peculiarity of the labor
problem is one good reason why this is true,
but there are other good reasons as well.

To the men of the South, the present affords
a time to measure their common sense against
their patriotism, and find out where they stand

as investors. A little common sense applied
to investment will pay larger dividends than a
whole world of patriotic enthusiasm.

On the whole, the South is a very promising
field for the investor, Southern or Northern.
No one who has watched its growth can doubt
it. In 1896, the Southern banks had but
$ 310,499,095 of deposits. Today they have
over $ r, ocxo, ooo, ooo of deposits. In the past
fifteen years the farni products of the South
have increased over 125%, the lumber products
over 175%, the manufactured products over
90%. The growth is going on to-day, just as
it was going on five years ago. All indications
point to its continuance to-morrow, as well.

THE ARiSEN SOUTH

HE presentation of the working South

made in this magazine is not meant to
be, to any considerable extent, statistical-
certainly not encyclopzedic. It is meant rather
to show the spirit and the general direction of
a great movement.

The rate of wealth-creation is published in
the trade and financial journals and is easily
accessible, and it is impressive in its great
totals. Absolutely accurate totals, by the way,
are hard to get, for the statistics of one set of
officials differ from those of another; and the
movement is too swift to be tabulated easily.
But more important than statistics covering
so vast a field are these questions:

(r) 1s the prosperity economically sound?
It is. The stripping of forests indiscriminately
involves, of course, an ultimate waste of wealth.
But all other Southern industries are real
additions to wealth.

(2) Is the prosperity difused? May every
industrious, productive man share it? Is it
bringing individual well-being? Yes, to a
remarkable degree. The individual has a
greater range of opportunity in the South to-
day than in any other part of the Union.

ARE THE OLD TRAITS LOST?

OW are the fine old traits of Southern
character faring in this rush of money-
getting men? Is leisure, is hospitality, is good
talk, is the gentle art of idleness, is the high
craft of story-telling, is the elaborate deference
to women, are the charming old idlers and
rhetoricians with their bubbling, full-hellied

good humor-are these good things of mellower
days in the process of passing away?

Yes, in a sense. Industry is a rude thing,
and progress is cruel. Something is lost in the
change that is taking place. You will now
find, in some old towns where gentlefolk once
ruled social life, a new and raw company who
make "society." It is so the world over.

But the sum of such social losses is more
than balanced by the genuine additions to
cultivated life and to high aims and to sterling
and even beautiful character that the rise of the
people is bringing-vastly more than balanced.

For the most important change that is taking
place is not the development of wealth-
great as that is-but the development of the
people, the people who till now have been
isolated, side-tracked, held back, kept out of
the highways of life. The base of cultivated
society is now immensely broadened. More
individuals-a thousand times more-share
its benefits than under the old regime.

LESSONS FROM THE SOUTH AND FOR TIIE SOUTH

HREE great lessons have elsewhere been
pointed out that the South may teach
the rest of the country. There are others, but
these stand out clearly-municipal govern-
ment, the teaching of trades, the teaching of
farmers. If one had to say what lessons the
South needs itself most to learn, these would
be selected:
(r) Sound economic thought, which would
bring greater freedom from mere traditions
and formulas.
