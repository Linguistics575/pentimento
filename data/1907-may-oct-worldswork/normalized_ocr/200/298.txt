continent. A generation may pass-then no
more of the Waganda.

Here and there along the Uganda Railway
'are white settlements, but for the greater part
the country is peopled as it was twenty years
ago. The only difference is that the slave-
raids are no more; but in their place is the
white trader, building up his little commercial
world as well as he may, or as badly as he
sometimes does. Only a year or so ago a
huge rhinoceros made things interesting by a
headlong charge upon the locomotive, but
now-a-days the wilder game is driven far back
from the railroad. The country has a long
way to go before it is abreast of Cape Colony,
but progress is sure. The Pax Britannica
rests upon these colonies in Eastern Africa.

IN THE NORTH OF AFRICA

The progress of Egypt in recent times is
told elsewhere in the story of Lord Cromer. It
is a marvelous story, this regeneration of the
land that Pharaoh ruled. Something of magic
there is in it, of the same magic that ruled
India, that taught the Maori in one short
generation how to make to himself a law, that
made of the Australian bushman a herdsman
of tame cattle, that put into the hand of the
Zulu a plow-handle to take the place of an
assegai. The Dervish of to-day has learned
to handle the throttle of an American-built
locomotive instead of the huge two-handed
sword he swung ten years ago. It is a symbol
of the New Egypt.

Elsewhere in Africa the light burns dimly.
Algiers and Morocco, the twin degenerates, are
drunk and lustful as of yore. Mr. Eugene
Aubin's picture of Abdul Abd-el-Aziz of
Morocco as a balloonist, motorist, and polo
player fails to waken enthusiasm over the pros-
pects of speedy civilization and enlightenment in
these two northern countries. Abyssinia is far
more promising. The fact appears to be that
the ruling classes of Morocco, in particular,
have turned their backs upon the law. A mel-
ancholy picture of Morocco is drawn by Asaad
Kalarji Karam, himself a trader in Morocco
and thoroughly grounded in the subject:

"And in regard to the bank (proposed by the Algeciras
Conference as a measure of betterment). The Moors
have not the least comprehension of the workings of a bank,
and, moreover, their religion forbids them to deposit their
money in one. Moors who have money bank it in the
ground. Many of them die without disclosing to anyone
else their place of deposit. No Moor dares to appear

rich for fear of being cast into prison and despoiled by the
officials of his government, or for fear of assassination at
the hand of other robbers. The Government has no
public works, and the mass of the people have no arts and
trades."

That phrase "other robbers" -how eloquent it
is of official oppression and national decadence!

WONDERS IN SOUTH AMERICA

Hardly less astonishing than the progress of
Africa is the progress of South America. We
have heard for a long time of Buenos Aires
and Montevideo. In our school days, we
heard of them as big South American towns,
no more. To-day, Buenos Aires is nearly
twice as big as Boston, and perhaps is more
important in the world at large. Over a mil-
lion people live within its boundaries. Its
parks, its avenues, its business streets, its
newspapers, libraries, and churches compare
favorably with the best of Philadelphia. Its
docks are as the docks of Liverpool. In
lighting, sewerage, water supply, the critics say
that it is beyond the best equipped city on this
continent, comparable only to Berlin "among the
great cities. It is, perhaps, better policed,
more law-abiding, more sober, and cleaner
than any American city. Only to-day it has
come to electric traction; and now, learning by
our example, it plans two great subways for its
urban traffic.

Montevideo is little behind it--a city as
big as Detroit and humming with world-
commerce! Yesterday it seemed but an outland
village, steeped in a Latin stupor. To-day
it plays New Orleans to Buenos Aires' St.
Louis, for it lies at the mouth of a river greater
than the Mississippi, with the bigger city
higher up the stream. Big steamships ply
between the two, and thence a thousand miles
up into the very heart of the continent, to little
Paraguay. Men grow to be millionaires, to
live in marble palaces on broad and beautiful
avenues. Their sons go through the schools,
graduate from the universities, go out into the
world equipped. They study statecraft as a
science, loving it. Therefore, in government,
control, and the spirit of law, they are far
ahead of us, who learn our law by breaking it.

We speak of South America as a land of
earthquakes and of insurrections. It is true
enough. Yet, in spite of it, and in spite of the
Latin temper, South America is holding its
own in the world. Was it not Walpole who
described a mythical visitor from Lima who
