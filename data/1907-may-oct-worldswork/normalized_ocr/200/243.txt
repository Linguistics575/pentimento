(2) A division into political parties-not for
any party's sake, but for the growth of free
opinion and for stimulating political activity.

(3) Judgment of Negroes more by their
individual qualities and character and less by
generalizations about the whole race; and less
talk about race-problems.

(4) The accurate study of the South itself
-irom its very geography to the local history
of the people.

Historical and economic study has been
begun in earnest by a growing body of well-
trained men, and it is a reasonable expecta-
tion that they will produce, in the next few
decades, noteworthy additions to the literature
of these subjects. The history of most of the
Southern States is yet adequately to be written
-written from the present wider point of view.

THE SOUTHERN DAILY PAPERS

HE p'rosperity of the Southern newspapers
is almost everywhere noticeable. In
every principal city there is one, in several
cities there are two, that yield very large in-
comes. And very few of them are "yellow."
The personalities of the editors count for
more than of corresponding editors in the
Northern States, or even in the West, as a rule.
The editor has something of the personal
authority that he had in the North two genera-
tions or more ago.

There is only one Republican daily paper in
all the old Southern States. But most of the
best papers give less emphasis to more party
politics (certainly between campaigns) than
they used to give. They publish more matter
about education and about the schools (it
might almost be said) than all the other daily
papers in the country combined. They report
and discuss also with great fulness the new
industrial activity. The Richmond (Vir-
ginia) Times-Dispatch, for instance, gives a
large space once a week to a general review
of industrial activity throughout its wide
territory. It publishes also a page a week
devoted wholly to educational news in Virginia,
and many other newspapers do the same thing;
and it conducts a free "teachers' bureau."

But they all have this peculiarity: If you
ride from Washington to Houston, Tex.,
around the seaboard, and buy a copy of every
daily paper published along the route, you
will read many editorials about the race-
problem, all saying the same thing. From
Houston, Tex., further west, you will miss

that topic till you come back again into Louis-
iana or Arkansas. Then all the way back to
Washington, you will read the same editorials
over again.

It was the Rev. John E. White, a patriotic
citizen and a vigorous Baptist h1ir1ister in
Atlanta, who once said that the Southern
people had gone talk-mad about the Negro.
The subject surely never rests.

The Southern press has an intense local
patriotism; it puts itself at the service of all
good causes-schools, good roads, public
improvements, and helpful activity in all its
forms; and most of these papers preserve
certain old-time ways that interest you. For
example, you will see a column headed tt Hymen-
asl," and another "Mortuary." "Marriages"
and "Deaths," for some reason, do not seem
to ftll the bill. But they have a real dignity
(at least between campaigns) as well as a
verbal rotundity.

ABOUT GOING SOUTH, YOUNG MAN

0 SOUTH, young man; but do not go

. unless you are willing and able to do a
man's work. The trouble from which these
states have suffered overmuch already is men
who were not willing to do full men's work.
But, if you throw away illusions about quick
wealth and get rid of a number of false notions
that you have probably heard about the country
and the people, and apply yourself to some
productive industry for which you are fitted by
temperament and training, you may easily
build a fortune, large or small, aecording to your
