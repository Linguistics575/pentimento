teenth century from the structure of the national
government, and therefore had its upper house
- the aldermen, its lower house - the common
council, and its executive - the mayor. Now,
city business is almost wholly administrative
or executive, and is very little concerned with
large policies or far-reaching legislation. There
is no occasion for two legislative bodies, or
even one, in the government of a city. Modern
cities have to provide and maintain schools,
roads and bridges, sewers, a water supply, a
fire department, courts, police, and street lights,
and to take care of the numerous helpless and
defective members of the community. On all
these subjects there is no doubt whatever as to
what the people need, and the proper supply
of their needs is a matter of purely adminis-
trative business. There is no question of
general policy to be advanced by public dis-
cussion, as in state legislatures or Congress.
Now and then a question arises which the will
of the whole people properly expressed may
best settle; but for the prompt and conclusive
expression of that will the initiative and the
referendum-now well-recognized means of
popular action-are greatly superior to any
means of expressing public opinion which a
board of alderman and a common council can
possibly afford. It should be remembered
also that there is not a single item of municipal
work which is now done, or can be done, in the
way in which the corresponding piece of work
-if there was anvaas done when the ordi-
nary form of the American city government was
adopted. The conditions under which muni-
cipal business is now conducted are so different
from those which existed when the American
form of city government was set up, that one
might reasonably expect a form not wholly
impracticable sixty years or eighty years ago to
have become absolutely unsuitable, or even
impossible, to-day.

In the next place, there is no branch or de,
partment of city business to-day which can be
properly carried on except by experts. In all
departments, amateur executive agents are
completely out of place, and are sure to be
sources of inefficiency, if not of corruption.
This, indeed, is one of the main sources of
municipal failure in the United States. Noth-
ing can be plainer than the general proposition
that lawyers, engineers, electricians, teachers,
architects, physicians, and similar experts are
the only competent persons to really do the
work of cities. Such trained persons must be

employed continuously and on long tenures of
office in the service of a city, or its work will not
be properly done. The only question is how
best to provide a suitable, central board to
select and employ the needed experts. The
justice of this proposition may be established
from the experience of all the existing organi-
zations for business purposes, such as railroads,
mills, mines, factories, banks, and steamship
companies. The administrative work of all
such organizations is done by experts selected,
employed, and directed by a small adminis-
trative board, or even by a single official. The

method used by these corporations is the only.

method for a city, if its work is to be well done.
Imagine the state of a railroad or factory whose
business was mainly directed by sub-committees
of two large bodies and a president, annually
elected by 50,000 shareholders. Yet city
business is very like corporation business,
except that it is not conducted for a rrofit.

THE CITY NO LONGER ISOLATED

Underlying the provision of a board of alder-
men and a common council for the American
cities, was the idea of two sorts of representa-
tion of the will of the citizens-one by a small
board elected at large, and the other locally
elected from small districts. This conception
of local representation has become entirely
inapplicable in city populations. When the
cities had no public water-supplies, any family
might have a strong local interest in a particular
well near their house; but now the interest of
every family in regard to its water-supply is
not at all within the limits of the city, but really
in .the pure condition- of a water-shed twenty
or forty miles away, quite outside of the geo-
graphical boundaries of the city. In the same
way, before the modern modes of transportation
came into existence, the citizen might be sup-
posed to have a peculiar interest in the side-
walk and roadway in front of his house; but
now he is much more nearly interested in the
good condition and safe operation of the 200
miles of electric railway which maintains for
him easy communication over a circle, the
radius of which sweeps ten miles round his
home. Again, the citizen's interest in roads and
bridges used to be limited to the few highways
over which wagons brought his daily food and
fuel from the immediately surrounding country;
but now the citizen has a much more intense
interest in theskilful operation of half a dozen
transcontinental railroads, than he has in the
