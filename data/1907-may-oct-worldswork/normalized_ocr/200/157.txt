THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE SOUTH

I sought him out about 3 P. M. and found
him mellow, as usual. I asked him about the
road in question.

"Never heard of ity' he said.

"You have been elected to its presidency,
Colonel!"

"Oh-well, that must be the road that
General F was talking to me about one day
last month. He wanted me to go into it.
I've got a deed for two thousand acres-say,
what do you want this for?"

"Only for publication!" said I.

The story came to a rather abrupt conclusion.
The railroad is included in the list of "pro-
jects" published in March with a quotation
from the president to the effect that "titlcs
have been secured and work will begin as soon
as necessary legal formalities are complied
with." It would be interesting to know who
now has that deed for 2/ooo acres.

Nevertheless, sifting the lists of projected
railroads thoroughly, it appears that there are
at least 5,000 miles of railroad actually about
to be built in the South and the Southwest.
Perhaps that iigure is low, rather than high.
It is well to make it so, because, unless all signs
fail, the tendencies now at work in the South
will lead to the curtailment of all building that
is not already well under way or that is not
too far advanced in its financing to allow
turning back.

Alabama may be cited to illustrate the tend-
ency. This state has for many years called
madly to the capitalists to come and build rail-
roads for its development. It has been rr >
tarded by the failure of capital to respond in
suEicicnt volume. In this current year, Ala-
bama has provided sufficient justification for
this tardiness of capital by undertaking to
penalize heavily the capital already invested
in the state. The writer can name two rail-
roads, projected to serve local communities
in Alabama, that have been permanently
abandoned by their projectors within the past
three months on account of the attitude of the
legislators toward foreign capital.

Consider, for instance, the bill to create a
new railroad commission for Alabama. Under
the provisions of this bill, the commission is to
consist of a president and two other members
elected by the people. The salary of the presi-
dent is to be $ 3,300 and of the other members
33,000. One clerk is allowed at $ 2,400, and
one stenographer at $ 1,200. The commission
is also allowed to employ "experts," but can-



8955

not spend more than $ 2,500 per annum for
such service. This commission, so armed, is
to be authorized to take supervision over all
intra-state steam railroad business. As a
matter of fact, into the hands of this commis,
sion is given the power to destroy or to assist
the railroads doing business in Alabama.

Think of a commission, elected by political
methods, whose members are paid salaries
no greater than the salary of a good metropoli-
tan newspaper reporter, entrusted with a duty
of this character! Think, too, of that $ 2,500
allowed for "expert" assistance! How far
would it go? What kind of a judgment as to
"reasonableness and justice" could be reached
in the hundreds of cases that must of necessity
come before this commission?

Alabama did not stop with the creation of
this commission. It passed a two-cent pas-
senger fare bill, and an act to establish max Â»
imum rates on freight and a classification
which will ultimately, if allowed, reduce very
materially the freight revenues of every railroad
operating in the state. It also provided for
the revocation of the charter of any foreign
railroad that shall attempt to remove from the
Alabama courts any legal procedure directed
against the rates provided by the railroad
commission of the state.

It would be tiresome to take up in detail the
legislation directed against the railroads in
North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee,
and other Southern states. It is all of a char-
acter to satisfy the demands of the people Who
elected the legislators, and much of it is de-
signed at the same time to destroy a large part
of the earning capacity of capital invested in
those states within the past twenty years.
Such as is most fiagrantly in violation of the
rights of property will be set aside by the
Supreme Courts, but the net result of the steps
necessary to this end will be that the public
hostility toward the railroads will be increased
by the bitterness growing out of suits fought
by the railroads against the states.

Thus, at the very time when, of all times,
there is the most urgent need of cooperation
between the Southern States and the railroads
of the South, it appears a foregone conclusion
that the two are drawing apart and becoming
out-and-out antagonists. The Southern Rail-
way is at this moment straining every nerve to
convince the people of the North and the people
of Europe that the South is worthy of their
coniidence. That railroad absolutely needs
