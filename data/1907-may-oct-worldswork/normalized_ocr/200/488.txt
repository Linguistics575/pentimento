from outside the North-Atlantic States enrolled
in Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Pennsylvania,
Princeton, and Yale during the past academic
year shows an increase over the year pre-
ceding. At the same time, the patronage of
the three or four leading universities of the
Middle West is no longer local but truly
national.

The enrollment of several Eastern univer-
sities is gradually assuming an international
aspect. Most "foreign" students come from
the neighboring countries of North America,
but the attendance from Asia increases, China

and India having lately joined Japan in send- V

ing a number of young men to our institutions.
England, Germany, and France all send good
delegations. In fact, every important nation
of Europe is represented. One hundred and
sixty-four European students were enrolled last
year at our six leading Eastern institutions.
South America sends us few, but during the
past year the number from this continent has
nearly doubled. The majority of those who
come from Europe and the countries to the
south of us are attracted by our technological
schools, while the Japanese show a particular
fondness for political science. Our profes-
sional schools of medicine and dentistry also
attract many foreigners.

One of the most encouraging facts about the
gains in college attendance is that it has come
in spite of higher requirements for admission
and advancement. The practice of demand-
ing a baccalaureate degree for admission to
professional schools is making only slow head-
way, but the so-called "combined course"
plan, whereby a student is enabled to earn both
his baccalaureate and his professional degree
in five or six years, is gaining new adherents
every year. Harvard has been a pioneer in
establishing high standards for admission to
professional study; its schools of law, medicine,
and theology have been conducted on a graduate
basis for several years, and the school of applied
science was added to this list last fall-the first
American school of technology to be placed
on that basis.

The male attendance in the academic de,
partments of our universities has suffered at
the hands of the scientific and technological
schools, for the greatest gain is in these latter.
The number of women attending our higher
institutions is continually on the increase,
especially at the Western universities, where
they frequently outnumber the men in the

academic department. The number of stu-
dents of pedagogy is growing rapidly, "educa-
tion" having won quite general recognition as
a legitimate university study. The enrollment
of the theological faculties tends to remain low,
but such studies as agriculture and forestry
show a gain in popularity.

Two of the most recent additions to university
activity are the summer session and "extension"
teaching. The remarkable growth of the
Columbia summer session, which in its eighth
year attracted almost 1,500 students, is worthy
of notice, and there are several other institutions
where an almost equally rapid growth has been
experienced. At several universities-notably
Chicago, Columbia, and Pennsylvania-a series
of so-called "extension" courses gives teachers
an opportunity to continue the work of the
summer at convenient hours-Saturday fore-
noons, for example-during the regular term.
These departments have lately taken the step
of utilizing also the early evening hours, the
innovation having met with an immediate
response wherever it has been introduced. The
field of extension teaching has vast possibilities,
especially in thickly settled communities.

PROGRESS TOWARD UNIVERSAL PEACE

HE advocates of peace who loudly express
their disappointment in the "inaction"
of the Hague Conference overlook the fact
that its delegates represent governments, not
peace societies. It is one thing for a company
of men and women-all of the same opinion---
to come together and resolve that war is a
terrible evil and that every sword should be
turned into a pruning-hook. It is quite an-
other thing for an international delegation of
diplomats-speaking different languages, hold-
ing widely different personal opinions, and
some representing nations whose policies are
directly or indirectly opposed to universal peace
--to bring conflicting views into harmony.

The leaders of this Conference are practical
men and do not expect to remove, by a rising
vote, all possibility of future war. Their
energies have been directed toward the pre-
vention of preventable wars and toward the
alleviation of the terrors of inevitable wars.
The very fact that the delegation is mainly
made up of international lawyers rather than
of diplomats (as was the first Conference) shows
that the peace movement has at last reached
the practical stage; the Powers are trying to
find a way to do what the peace societies
