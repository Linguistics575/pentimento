The law went into effect on July Ist. On
May 8th, the Southern Railway brought suit
before a Federal Circuit Court to enjoin the
enforcement of the law pending a final decision.
This case came to a hearing on June 26th, four
days before the law was to have gone into effect.
The court granted this injunction and appointed
a commissioner to take evidence and report on
the matter in September, so that a final decision
could be reached in October. The decision
ordered the railroad to give to each passenger
a coupon for the amount he was charged over
the 2l-cent fare, the coupon to be cashed after
the final decision if this should be against the
company.

This seemed a sensible settlement, and it is
practically the arrangement now in force in
other states in which the railroads have appealed
to the courts against rate legislation. But
North Carolina, in the face of the Federal
decision, prosecuted the Southern Railway for
a refusal to obey the law and sentenced two
hapless agents of the company to the chain-
gang for the offense of selling tickets at the old
rate. Another agent was forced to give up
his service, under threat of the law.

Again the railroad had recourse to the
Federal courts, obtaining freedom for the
agents and a stay of proceedings under the
muclrdiscussed law. By the end of July, it
was a pretty tangle. The state and Federal
courts were in open conflict. Penalties were
piling up against the Southern Railway at a
rate sufficient to bankrupt it within a very
brief time. Under the circumstances, it was
time for a truce. The Southern Railway
yielded its point with respect to the 2ยง-cent
fare, and agreed to put in force such a fare not
later than August 8th, and to maintain it pend-
ing a final judgment before the Supreme
Court of the United States. To the end that
such a judgment shall be obtained speedily,
a suit will be pressed before the Supreme
Court of the state and, if decided against the
company, carried thence to the Supreme Court
of the United States. In the meantime, the
state will not institute any other suits for failure
to comply prior to August 8th, and will endeavor
to restrain private individuals from bringing
suits on such grounds.

At this point the matter now rests. It is not
possible to form a judgment on the constitu-
tional question until the Supreme Court shall
have passed upon it. It is clear, however, that
North Carolina did deliberately attempt, in

framing this law or in enforcing it, to close the
Federal courts to the railroads affected by the
law. The state has put itself in a position not
at all praiseworthy. The law should give to
every man all possible safeguards in his prop-
erty rights, and should in all cases assist appeals
to the courts for protection in such rights. In
this anti-railroad legislation a deliberate effort
has been made to cut off from the railroads,
themselves the creatures of the state, the full
privilege of law.

The real result of the episode, however, is
to stir up hatred against the corporations.
The whole affair lends added point to the
following paragraph, printed in THE WORLD'S
WORK for June, in a discussion of the lcgir
lation of Alabama, North Carolina, and other
Southern States:

"It is all of a character to satisfy the demands of the
people who elected the legislators, and much of it is de-
signed at the same time to destroy a large part of the
earning capacity of capital invested in those states within
the past twenty years. Such as is most fiagrantly in
violation of the rights of property will be set aside by the
Supreme Courts, but the net result of the steps necessary
to this end will be that the public hostility toward the rail-
roads will be increased by the bitterness growing out of
suits fought by the railroads against the states."

HE Civic Federation appointed a com-

petent committee, made up of men
several of whom are men of distinction and all
men of earnestness, to investigate the working
of the municipal ownership of public utilities
in the United States and, as far as they chose,
abroad. First, individual investigators of the
committee made their reports, and of these
somewhat conflicting reports the whole com-
mittee made a final one. The committee
contains men who hold different and conflicting
theories and among them are professional
students of such questions, business men, and
leaders of labor. The value of the final report,
therefore, is very considerable. Its most
important clauses are:

"Public utilities, whether in public or private hands, are
best conducted under a system of legalized and regulated
monopoly.

"Public utilities in which the sanitary motive largely
enters should be operated by the public.

"The success of municipal operation of public utilities
depends upon the existence in the city of a high capacity
for municipal government.

"Franchise grants to Private corporations should be
