esting problems. The tower alone will weigh
more than 18,000 tons. This great weight
must be concentrated upon an area 65 feet
square, with 90 feet of mud and wet sand
between the surface and bed-rock. The con-
tractor for the foundation must not only guar-
antee the new building against settling or
leaning for generations to come, but he is also
held responsible for any damage done to ncigh-
boring buildings during the course of construe
tion. The foundations must rest on bed-rock.

The ground in this part of New York City
is saturated with water to such an extent as to
be fluid; hence the old method of "cellar-
digging" is impossible. Every building in
the vicinity would begin to settle, and would
eventually collapse. The Singer Building on
its present location would have been an utter
impossibility a dozen years ago, before the
development of the pneumatic caisson process
of foundation building. _

The pneumatic caisson is a huge timber box,
upon at the bottom and with a small entrance
hole in the top. It is made air and water-tight
and is filled with compressed air, which is
prevented from escaping from the entrance by
two successive trap-doors, a patented device
known as the "air-lock." This caisson, con-
taining workmen with picks and shovels, sinks
lower and lower through the wet soil as the
forty-five pounds of compressed air crowds the
water away from under it and the men hoist
the solid material to the top through the air-
lock. As the men excavate they stand on
comparatively dry earth, yet the soil scarcely
two feet below them is full of quick-sand or
wet mud. With the old-time method, tons of
water and slime would have to be pumped out
and hoisted, making of the foundation hole
often a mere cess-pool.

As the caisson sinks still lower, it becomes
necessary to attach to the entrance hole a steel
shaft reaching up to the street level so that the
workmen, in frequent changes of shift, can
relieve each other of the strain due to the cum-
pressed air. A dozen of these "sand-hogs"
work by electric light in each caisson-stripped
to the waist, even in the dead of winter, for the
earth is not susceptible to outside temperature
changes at such depth. Meanwhile, the roof
of the caisson is being covered with layer after
layer of concrete. Each layer is exactly the
same size as the caisson and each hardens
in the open air before it gradually sinks, pressing
the wooden box deeper into the ground, New

lengths of the steel entrance shaft are added for
the laborers, now eighty feet below the side-
walk. These men climb up and down a hatch-
way surrounded on all sides by the solid con-
crete upon which later the building is to rest.
Bucket after bucket of d√©bris is hoisted up
through this hatch-way. One contains a
piece of antique Dutch ware; another brings up
old Indian relics. Here the superintendent
found a piece of wood that had been un-
disturbed since lower Manhattan was under
the sea.

Slowly the descending pier of concrete sinks
nearer its ultimate resting-place on the bed-
rock. This pier, solid save for the entrance
shaft down its centre, through which the men
and materials pass, begins to penetrate the
few feet of "hard-pan," which lies just above
its final rcstir1g-placc. Now a geological
expert is sent for; he descends the narrow
shaft to determine if the proper bed-rock has
been reached.

If the rock stands inspection, every vestige
of earth is hoisted to the outside air, fresh con-
crete is lowered into the shaft and laid and
tamped carefully on the rock. The entire
caisson is then filled with concrete; the timber
roof is torn out and that space filled also, the
workmen retreating up the shaft as more and
more concrete is laid and tamped in the former
passage-way. The result is a solid concrete
pier, its lower end resting on bed-rock and its
upper end reaching up ninety feet to receive
the load of the great steel column for which it
was especially designed. There are twenty
of these piers under the tower alone, each being
approximately ten feet thick and twenty feet
wide. The building will be bolted down
with forty huge steel bolts, each six inches in
diameter. This precaution is sufficient to hold
up the building against a hurricane exerting
a pressure of thirty pounds per square foot.
No wind has ever been known to exert more
than ten pounds pressure per square foot. The
weight of the tower alone is sufficient to hold
against any gale reasonably to be expected. The
forty steel bolts are imbedded in the concrete
foundations to a depth of fifty feet below the
lower basement floor. Concrete grips any
steel that it may surround with a tenacity that
in some cases is more than ample to break the
steel under strain before it could be dislodged
by the pull. Concrete will also protect the
steel from the action of water and of the
atmosphere. The upper part of each bolt is
