laughs at. He did not contemplate the redemp-
tion of the nation. He attempted nothing
beyond the reach of his own powerful arms.
There was his own city, which had his affection
"in spite of its soot, its yellow water, and-
its politics." He was trying to make it cleaner.

MR. TAFT AND GEORGE B. COX

George B. Cox was also just entering public
life, and these two young men were natural
adversaries. They often met (they meet yet,
and they do this without bitterness), but they
did not foregather in the same circles. Cox
was husky, coarse-grained, and a power in
the saloons. He was the typical "heeler," but
he acquired great political sagacity and grew
to be, as Taft now describes him, a master in
his art. It is said that his personal hold on men
comes from dividing on the square. With
infinite patience he was already building at this
time what Taft calls "the most perfect machine
for the control of party conventions and
elections."

Taft fought him from the start. That was
inevitable. And yet, the only time Taft ever
ran for office, this man Cox supported him.
Politics has more vagaries than a cyclone, and
this was one of them. Taft's ideas of warfare
against what Cox represents are not the usual
ones. He does not believe in supplanting one
boss with a better boss. Taft proposes a
counter organization of sharp-eyed young men
who would put forward only the best can-
didates, and who would maintain their organi-
zation the year round. He would take the
offices from the boss permanently by means of
municipal civil service. He would separate
national politics from the administration of
local affairs, and he would have the direct
primary. These conclusions evolved them-
selves naturally during a quarter century of
antagonism to Cox's spoils system, an antag-
onism that had a temporary climax in the Akron
speech, and Cox's feigned retirement from
politics. From the above it is apparent that
young Taft was not, like many young men,
turned from his activities by "the distressing
effect" of machine rule, nor that he became
subservient to it.

Within three years after leaving college, one
year after his admission to the bar, and at the
age of twcnty-four, Taft held the first in his
long and varied series of public offices. One
of the old Mt. Auburn boys was elected prose-
curing attorney of Hamilton County, and he

brought Will Taft into the office as an assistant.
Joe Moses, bailiff of the court at the time, who
made a record for never letting a prisoner get
away from him, was asked what struck him
most about Taft as a prosecutor.

"Well, there's one thing," he said; "he
wanted to get every criminal into the
penitentiary."

But, throughout, Tait's attitude has been just
this toward the unregenerate pests of society.
In the prosecutor's office he became familiar
with that chronic miscarriage of justice which
impels him to declare "that the administration
of the criminal law is a disgrace to our civiliza-
tion." We are too prone, he thinks, to regard
the liberty of the individual more than the safety
of the community from crime. We extend
to the felon too many unwarranted chances,
very much as fox hunters give the fox a start.
And then, once a conviction is obtained, there
are the appeals, the re-trials, perhaps based on
exasperating technicalities that in no way
alter the fact of guilt. There are the delays
also, so that the rich lawbreaker ir1solently
buys immunity from punishment, an immunity
of class neutralizing the equality before the
law guaranteed by the Constitution, and an
offense to the spirit of our free institutions.
Out of such a condition arises another dis-
grace, the blind though more certain law of
Judge Lynch. "It men who commit crime,"
he says, "were promptly arrested and con-
victed, there would be no mob for the purpose
of lynching." The remedy rests with the courts.

DRIVING OUT A BLACKLEG LAWYER

Cincinnati at the time was peculiarly afflicted
with an era of lawlessness. Thomas C. Campe

ir1flucncc, terrorism, and every shyster trick,
to get his man off free. The thieves and
"toughs" even bore the name of "Campbell's
gang, "and they grew more bold each day. At
last, after a cowardly murder at their hands,
there was mob violence and the Scoundrels
burned the court house. Those were harassing
days for the prosecutor's office, and in the face
of evidence diihcultly gathered the accused were
acquitted. Finally a committee of the local
bar, including Mr. Taft, appealed to the legis-
lature to rid the state's criminal code of "those
features which placed the prosecution at great
disadvantage in the trial of capital cases."
These citizens wanted the twcnty-three chal-
lenges all wed the defense reduced to twelve,
