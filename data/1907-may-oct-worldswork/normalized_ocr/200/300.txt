defeat at the hands of Japan, twelve years ago,
was the beginning of a new era for the Chinese
Empire. Prior to that time, China had been
blind, moribund, insensate. The nation was
drunk with ovorweening pride, drugged stupid
with its opium, staggering toward oblivion,
like a century-old giant stumbling in the dark.

The terrible defeat by Japan called into
being a new life in the Empire. Wisdom came
to see new lights. The Viceroy Chang became
the apostle of education. He laid his petitions
at the feet of the Emperor, begged him, threat-
ened him, coaxed him, as one would coax a
child. In the end, a thousand schools sprang
into being suddenly throughout the Empire. To-
day, over 10,000 Chinese students are imbibing
modern methods at the great universities
of Japan, England, Germany, and America.
T 0-day, a thousand temples of the ancient'gods
in China are serving as schools to teach the
sons of the Dragon the wisdom of their
conquerors.

Results must, of necessity, be slow; for the
number of the people is legion, and the genera-
tions of benighted darkness that have gone are
as stones to weigh them down-but the first-
fruits have been gathered. The eyes of China
are turning from the blood-stained fields of
war to the markets of the strife of commerce.
When China resolved to strike the United
States, a little time ago, it created a boycott of
American goods. That is the war of the
twentieth century-not the war of China's
tradition.

Thirty years ago this year, the Chinese
Government bought a foreign railroad within
its borders. It was called the Wu-Sung Rail-
way. China wanted that railroad. As soon
as it had it, it proceeded and did with it as it
desired. It tore the rails from the roadbed and
threw them into the deep river. It threw the
rolling-stock after them. That was the way of
China with a railroad thirty years ago.

To-day, the Chinese Empire is about to
build a great trunk-line railroad that shall
connect Peking with Canton and the outside
world. Already more than 7,000 miles of
railroad are in operation within the boundaries
of the Empire. The great ports welcome,
week by week, huge steamers flying the English,
French, German, American, and Canadian
flags, fill them from keel to deck-beams with
the products of Chinese industry, and send
them far upon their several ways. Splendid

THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD

Canton, Hong Kong order their goods in
thousands of tons from the forges of Sheffield
and Birmingham, the looms of Manchester,
the mills of Pittsburg, and scatter them thou,
sands of miles broadcast over the interior of
China. The hundreds of millions of the sub-
jects of Tsi An are taking a place as a com-
mercial factor in the markets of the world.
What will they do as decade follows decade,
with education ever growing, wealth ever
increasing, efficiency ever advancing? Mr.
James J. Hill says that they will come, at last,
to eat American wheat and to wear American
clothes. Perhaps-who knows? If they want
wheat, there are uncountcd millions of acres of
land in China fit for the growing of wheat.
Perhaps we of the Occident may sometime
reverse the current of things and draw upon
China for wheat for our own feeding. Stranger
things than this have come to pass.

Much may be read in current literature con-
ceming China and its awakening. The bulk
of the writing is based upon the advance in the
Chinese army. T hat is merely typical. When
the heart of Chang turned toward education,
ten years or more ago, it was still mindful of
the practical things, and an army is a very
practical thing in China. Therefore, he also
advocated calling upon the Japanese for
soldiers to train the army of China. They
came, those little brown Napoleons, and with
them came many others of all colors and all
creeds-an Irishman who had ridden the wide
ranges with the Canadian Northwest Mounted
Police, some few gunners from the British
navy, retired or merely dropped overboard on
a dark night in Shanghai harbor, German
strategists who demanded, and got, big salaries
because they knew just what ought to be done
at any certain time under any certain conditions,
even though they had never seen it done-all
these and niany others came, and they did
things unnumbered to the Chinese army.
Therefore is it that the little yellow soldier
wears to-day a uniform instead of a swaddling
cloak, and fights-with blank cartridge-with
all the virtues of the nations great in arms.
So well has China taken to her heart the lesson
of the Yalu River. And, all the while, men
confidently talk of Peace, around the world!
