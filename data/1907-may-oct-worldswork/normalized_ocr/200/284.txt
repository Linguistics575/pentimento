The reorganization of the native tlrmy is
another emmple of good workmanship. When
Cromer went down into Egypt, he found itsarmy
--as all the world knew-to be nothing more
than a joke; he "advised" the Khedive that
it be disbanded and'd new army created. He
also "suggested" the names of a few English
olficers that could turn the trick; one of
these was Kitchener. The hriefest and most

Egyptians simply lucked the moral courage to
face a charge and turn it back.

The second chapter is best told by Kipling:
"Said England unto Pharaoh,'I must make a man of you

That will stand ulmn his feel and play the game;

That will Maxim his oppressor as a Christi n ought to do,'
And she sent old Pharaoh Sergeant Whatisruuuc,

It was not a Duke, nor Earl, nor yet a Viscount-

It was not a big brass General that came;

But :1 man in khaki kit, who could handle men a bit,
With his bedding labelled Sergeant Whatisname."

The third part of the story was told in 1891
by Colonel Hollccl-Smith, in his report of a
fight on the same road to Tokar, with the same
enemy, and under the same conditions-Ftp-

dramatic way to tell the story of the reorgani-
zation of the native army is to give three
extracts.

First, here is the Egyptian fighting, man of
1884, as pictured by General Baker in "d telei
gran1announcing thedefeztt of the native army
by the tlervishes: tt Flleb:

"Mirrclwd yesterday morning with 3,500 towards
Tokurr. our square being unly thrcatcned by
small force of l'nt'my, Certainly less than 1,000 strong, the
Egyptian tronps threw clown their arms and ran, allowing
themselves to he killed without the slightest resistance.
More than 2,00o killed. All material lost."

The native troops were not wholly to blame.
They knew the wild frenzy of the dervishes,
who have been appropriately described as'" all

tian troops and English officers in both cases. It
shows what seven years of good training can do.

"The bulk oi their (the dervishcs') force was dircctcrl
against the line occupied by the Izlh battalion, their attack
being pushed home with thvir usual intrepidity and imp
lessness. The troops, hrnvevcr, stood their ground and
did not yield one inch throughout the line."

No one now has any apprehension about
the cificierwy of the native army with its British
officers. They garrison the outposts all the
way up into the Soudan.

England's work for education is less
spectacular in results, but none the less revolu-
tionary. It must be remembered that this is
a Mohammedan land, and that the Western
