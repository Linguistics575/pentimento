OPSONINS-A NEW HOPE FOR HEALTH

the sick man's blood is discovered, and thi,
amount of opsonic vaccine is indicated. To
make this plainer, let us rehearse the play.

Scene: A medical laboratory. Persons in
the play: John Doe, suffering from tuberculosis;
Richard Roe, a healthy friend; Bacterius, an
expert germ chef.

Bacterius, the laboratory man, has in a glass
tube a stock supply of living white blood-cells
which he has obtained from the blood of a
healthy person. These white blood-cells have
been separated from the other elements that
compose this sacrificial blood-offering. Bac-
terius now punctures the earlobe of sick John
Doc, secures a few drops of blood in a pipette,
and puts them into a whirling machine, which
quickly separates the red blood, white blood,
and serum into layers. He then places this
pipette alongside the one holding his "stock
supply" of white blood-corpuscles.

In the meanwhile Bacterius has secured some
of the living tubercle germs from the expec-
torated mucus of sick John Doe and placed
them on a gelatine and agar jelly, where they
soon raise millions of other tubercle bacilli.
These he stews for two hours. Then he puts
this germ-stew into a bottle holding a number
of little glass shot, and shakes the bottle to
crush the germs and to press out their body
juices. It is this extract that strengthens the
opsonic forces of the blood liquid.

Bacterius next places some of this tubercle,
stew into a third pipette. Then he prepares
a fourth pipette of blood serum obtained from
the blood of the sick man's friend, Richard
Roe-healthy blood. So here are four pipettes:
.one .containing digesters (white blood-cells

"only); another holding crushed: tubercl√©-stew; _

the thirfcontaining John Doe's blood in three
layers, the opsonie serum layer on top; the
fourth holding Richard Roe's specimen of
healthy blood. Bacterius now takes another
kind of pipette and draws equal parts of John
Doe's serum, the bacilli-stew, and the white
blorod-cells, and mixes them. He places this
mixture in a chamber heated to blood heat
to warm the white blood-cells and their prey,
the tubercle bacilli. They are kept here for
twenty minutes. According to the opsonic
power of the serum in this mixture, each of the
white blood-cells will cngulf a certain average
number of bacilli. Bacterius warms another
mixture, which contains the healthy serum
from Richard Roe's blood. He now has the
Doe and Roe mixtures ready for comparison.

9433

He spreads the Doe mixture on one micro-
scopic cover-glass (like a miniature watch-
crystal), and the Roe mixture on another;
placing each under a high-power microscope,
he counts the number of bacilli found in a
hundred white blood-corpuscles in each speci-
men. Dividing the total by 100, he has the
average in each cell in both specimens. Sup-
pose there are 300 bacilli lying in the'rcro white
blood-cells in John Doe's specimen (average
3), and 500 in Roe's specimen (average 5);
this shows that healthy Richard Roe's opsonic
power is 5 to 3 better than the sick man's,
or 40 per cent. stronger. This determines
the amount of the vaccine (the tubercle bacilli
stew) needed to bring thc sick man's opsonic
power up to that of normal Roc's blood.

We might make this complex laboratory
play still more simple by assuming the white
blood-cells to be sharks; the tubercle germs to
be minnows; and the blood serum specimens
from Doe and Roe as two water tanks, with one
more salty than the other-and assume also
that the saltier the water the more minnows
the sharks would eat. Then Bacterius would
put the same number of minnows in each tank
and an equal number of sharks in each, and
leave them together for twenty minutes. Then
he would take a hundred sharks from Doe's
tank, cut them open and see how many minnows
they had eaten; then he would do the same with
the sharks in the Roe tank and compare the
two. Then he would know how much saltier
(opsonic) was the water of one tank than that
of the other.

THE MESSAGE OF HOPE'

The verdict of'medical science pn. yopsonins
may determine the fate of-million's of men.
Thousands of careful tests are being made
with typhoid, tubercular, eruptive, and other
opsonic vaccines, but not until a great many
results have been compared with the usual
results will we begin to know the real value of
opsonins. Their best showing thus far is in
cases of skin eruptions. Typhoid results have
not been so good. Tests with tubcrculosis--
Koch's newest "tuberculin" (an opsonic vac
cine) being employed in many cases-encourage
further experiment. One thing seems certain
-that Wright's opsonic discoveries mark a
genuine advance in the field of acquired
immunity or serum treatment, and it will not
be long before investigators will have deter,
mined the specific value of opsonins.
