thousands of people keep their families in one
municipality and do their business in another,
it is impossible that the distribution of taxes
should be even approximately equitable, or
that the expenditures for schools in particular
should be equitably divided between the busi-
ness centre and the residence quarter.

But it is in financing that the greatest
losses and inconveniences occur. When a
territory which should be under one control is
divided between twenty or thirty city and town
governments, the borrowing capacity of the
different municipalities will show great varia..
tions, those with the smallest credit being
unable to avail themselves of the superior
credit of larger or richer neighbors. Under
such circumstances, the prosperity and com-
fort of the entire region are diminished, because
no intelligent plan can be made and carried
out for either the construction or the main-
tenance of the highways, bridges, subways,
and other public works which ought to serve
in the most convenient way the whole com-
munity. Each petty municipality will make
its plans and execute them without the least
attention to the interests of the surrounding
communities. That the area under one city
government may reasonably be largely in-
creased follows as a corollary from the improved
means of transportation which have come into
use within fifteen years. The telephone and
telegraph also imply larger units of municipal
administration because they permit wider
dispersion of the population without any dim-
inution of the facilities for intercourse.

THE PRESENT SYSTEM FAVORS CORRUPTION

One of the greatest evils connected with
municipal government in the United States has
been the corrupt dealings between the city
governments and the corporations which wish
to obtain valuable franchises for various semi-
public purposes, such as transportation,
lighting, and telephone and telegraph service.
The corporation which wanted a franchise,
limited or unlimited in time, for money-making
purposes, was often prepared to pay the tem-
porary incumbents of the city offices largely
for votes to give the privileges which the cor-
porations desired; and the fact that such oppor-
tunities to make money frequently presented
themselves to aldermen and councilmen made
places in the city government desirable for men
who were ready to rob their constituents, and
betray the interests of the city in these ways.

CITY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN

A corruptible city government was the oppor-
tunity for the corporation which was willing
to corrupt, and the existence of such relations
made city politics selfish, dishonest, and de-
grading. The cure for this hideous evil must
be a fundamental one, because the evil has two
deep roots; on the side of the city, a bad form
of government combined with an inadequate
territorial unit; and on the side of the corn-
munity, a lax morality as regards the conduct
of corporations. The substitution for the
board of aldermen and the common council of
a small board in which power and responsibility
are concentrated would go far to remove from
municipal administration the weak or vicious
men who are capable of corruption; and the
enlargement of the municipal area under one
government would make that area coincide
with the area desirable for the activities of the
public franchise corporations. In other words,
the small governing board of a great city having
an area conterminous with the region desirable
for the purposes of a well-organized electric
railway corporation, or a gas and electric light
company, or a telephone company, would be
in position to exercise the needed control over
these monopolies. At present such companies
have often to deal with two, three, or thirty
different municipalities in order to reach the
area which it is for the common interest of the
corporation and the community that they
should serve. Since these companies are
inevitably monopolies, they must be regulated
by public authority. So far as their issues of
stocks and bonds and the general rules under
which they shall operate are concerned, the
state may best supply the needed regulation, as
Massachusetts has long done through the
admirable'railroad and gas commissions; but
the other conditions under which they shall
render their service, such as their use of the
highways, subways, -and conduits, the transfers
on electric roads, and the amount of service to
be rendered, may best be controlled by city
authority. We see here again how the Ameri-
can cities have failed to keep up with the enor-
mous changes in the mode of life of urban
communities which applied science has brought
about during the last twenty years.
