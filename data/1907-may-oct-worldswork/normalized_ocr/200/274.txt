was surrounded by an ofliciul class made up of
the most unscrupulous seoundrels that ever
cursed tt helpless people. Teufk periodically
caught "the men higher up" by the heels and
shook them until the pockets of their capacious
bloomers were emptied of coin; the "nwn

down in the same Wlly. The lowest-of-alir
down, the feliaheen, had no coin, but the tax-

and the houses of the governed illustrates the English trait of
magnifying the majesty of the law in the Eyrs of the natives

There was scarcely a semblance of the human
left in them: there was less of the human in
their oppressors. Simple justice and "a square
deal" were dreams as remote as the Paradise

Major Baring knew all these distressing
facts, and more, when he took up his work
at the beginning of 1884. He knew also that
