cent. mortgage of the Colorado & Southern is
made in $ 100 pieces, cl1iefV because a large
part of it is placed in Switzerland and Ger-
many. The foreign people like small blocks
of bonds, because they are habitual buyers of
bonds, investing their monthly savings regularly
in this way. France, of course, is the most
notable country for this kind of buying. When
the Pennsylvania Company made a loan in
Paris, last year, it made the notes in blocks of
500 francs, about $ 96. These notes are listed in
Philadelphia, and savers of money in small lots
might get some of them; but they have only M
per cent. interest and are not very cheap.

There is, in fact, a lamentable lack of such
bonds available for regular investment of small
sums of money. That is the main reason why
the average man throughout the country docs
not know what a bond is, and thinks that only
the rich can own bonds. It is an impression
that has done more harm to the people and the
railroads than almost any other single factor
in the situation. The American is not per-
sonally interested in our great companies to
any extent. It is l very serious weakness, and
is recognized as such by all foreign critics of our
finance and by a few home critics.

The result is that the very small investor is
left to be the prey of the sharper and the
swindler. Mining shares, wild Mtations in
small industrial stocks, traps of all sorts are
almost invariab:'y issued in lots of 81 and up.
Some of them, in fact, are even smaller. They
are paraded as the only feasible means of
investing small sums. They blatantly adver-
tise themselves as invented, projected, and
intended to provide the small saver of money
with a medium for investment. Thousands of
people are swindled every year for just this
reason. If a means were invented whereby
the great sound mass of investment securities
could be brought within the reach of the
people of small means, and the people could
be taught that they are within reach, millions of
dollars could be saved to the people each year.

At present, there are several good companies
in this country making investments on just this
plan for the people. Nearly all of them are
real-estate companies. T heir bonds take vari-
ous forms. The only trouble about them is the
difficulty of selecting the good from the bad.
Probably more than half the companies that
now do this sort of business are not sound. A
small number of the concerns are perfectly
safe, sound, and conservative. Perhaps the

INVESTING MONEY BY SMALL INSTALMENTS

most interesting feature of this group of com
parties is the way they have gone after the small
investor..

Recently, the writer encountered an offer
made by one of these companies to sell a $ 1,000
bond, payable in ten years, at the rate of about
In other words, the investor
who can figure on having $ 71 per year to invest
can deposit it with that company, get a receipt
for it, and consider it safe. He does the same
thing eachyear for ten years, making $ 710 in
all. After the last payment, he gets $ I, ooo in
cash. It looks as though it were an offer to
give the investor something for nothing. In
reality, it is merely paying him compound
interest at nearly 6 per cent. per annum for
the use of his money, and is a desirable invest-
ment of its class. Variations of this plan of
investment will be found in great abundance
in the real-estate field.

As a matter of fact, the growth of this busi-
ness and the intelligent effort of the promoters
of other and less praiseworthy enterprises have
taken away from the held of railroad and strong
industrial investment in the past two years or
so. Unless the makers of railroad bonds and
their bankers realize this fact shortly, there
will be an increasing flood of money flowing
into the newer forms of bonds and a diminishing
Mod flowing to the big or rporaticn bonds and
notes. It is time that s nncthing were done to
offset the tendency of the retailers of other
bonds to sell them on the instalment plan to
the smaller investors of the country.

There is no good reason why railroad bonds
should not be sold in the same way. The time
must come when either the railroads will split
their band: i'to rusall lots, or the bankers who
sell them will sell on the instalment plan. A
man who saves $ 200 per annum, on an average,
should be able to buy a $ 500 bond in two years
and a half. In the meantime, the banker
should pay him interest on his instalments at
the rate of at least 4 per cent. The writer has
no doubt that within the next ten years a busi-
ness of this kind will spring up among the great
banking houses of New York, and that it will
not only bring wealth and credit to the bankers
who carry it on but will also serve as the most
powerful incentive toward making the American
people a race of investors, as are the French,
the Dutch, and the Swiss.

Of course, there are objections, out most of
them are trivial. They have been surmounted
in other countries, and in the promotion of the
