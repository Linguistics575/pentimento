arrived, and he could not do business as the pair oi big
men stood talking with each other.

"You know," said Sullivan afterwards, "all big men are
all right if you just let them alone. They will take a lot
and stand for a good deal until they get going, but when they
do get started they go like -" and John L. thought he
could not pay a better compliment to the Secretary of War.

TAFT AS A COLLEGE BOY

When Mr. Taft was only seventeen, he was
already tall and powerful; and when, with
"a choice lot of boys" from Andover, he went
to Yale, the bcardless, 225-pound freshman was
hailed in prophetic glee. His class, his
University, had visions of the things he would
do on the gridiron, this splendid, clear-eyed
giant. Then came one of those rushes in
Hamilton Park, when freshmen manifest a
disposition not to be pushed off the earth.
In this particular rush, Taft went crashing
through the sophomores like a catapult. One,
a man of his own weight, leaped in front of
him. Then Taft let forth a joyous roar and
charged! He grappled with the other Ajax,
lifted him bodily, and heaved him over his head.
No wonder he promptly got the nickname of
"Bull" Taft! And the godsend he would be
for the athletic f1eldl

But they did not know him yet. Judge
Taft, his father, cherished the old-fashioned
notion that a man ought to work at college, and
work hard. He had taken honors himself,
and so had young Taft's half-brother. The
thing was a family tradition, and the 225-pound
freshman entered college with that one idea
in mind. He joined no elevens, no crews, no
track teams. His industry was amazing. The
courses at Yale then were rigidly prescribed,
almost nothing being elective before the senior
year, but Taft went at the distasteful part of
it as at all things else. He was "Bull" Taft
again, charging obstacles, and a convincing
heavyweight at it, too. His exhaustless phy-
sique he used to back up his clear intellect,
and at the hardest study he never tired. His
was none of the brilliant off-hand coups of
genius, but huge, safe momentum; from day
to day, lesson by lesson, he slowly made his
way close to the head of his class.

To illustrate: A younger collegian went to
him (everybody fell into the way of going to
"Old Bill") and asked him about collateral
reading. The younger man, being very young
and ambitious, had planned for himself a
course of outside reading which would lead to

a broader culture. He thought that he wanted
to read deeply in French literature, or in Ger-
man, you know.

"Don't do it," advised the unrevolutionary
Taft. Throwing an arm about the shoulder
of the enthusiastic youngster, he talked to him
as "a Dutch uncle," more or less in this
fashion:

"Get over it," he said. "You mustn't try
to be too independent, just yet. These Uni-
versity professors have laid out a course, and
it's the result of their long experience, while
you-well, this is your first trial at educating
anybody, isn't it? All right, then, perhaps
you'd just better stick to the course. While
you're here, bang along at what's prescribed,
and bang as hard as you can, and stand as
far away from the foot of the class as your
efforts and the rest of the class will let you.
There's no hurry about that collateral reading."

"Old Bill" might have talked in the same
owlish way about collateral celebrating. As to
himself, the business of carousing was never
brought to him to decide on moral grounds.
He was liberal enough in such matters, but the
loss of time was the stand on which he decided
it; or rather, he never came to the point of
actual decision on any grounds. He simply
did not want to lose a day at his "pounding"
for an honor. A night off would incapacitate
him for the morning after; he would have to
cut two or three recitations and would be set
back by that much. He trusted nothing to
native brilliancy to carry him through. By
steady, ponderous work he had to drive each
peg as he came to it. He could not drive two
at the same time, one with each hand. He
swung his sledge with both hands, laying on
his powerful weight, and it was a fast-driven
spike that sank into the hard, fine-grained
wood of his intellect. For this reason, he kept
in good physical shape. His strength was
uncultivated by training, but it was an enormous
natural strength. Physically, he was another
Jean Valjean, and he could have made himself
a colossal campus hero. But he proved the
more colossal because he turned his back on
the glory indicated by his huge frame, and set
the rare example of a college giant patiently
plodding along at his books.

Yet he was not one of those insufferable,
pedantic "grinds" that pose as a reproach to
all healthy, sane fellows who know the best joy
of living. Secretary Taft is essentially a
social character and always has been. He
