9070 THE STORY OF

ENGLAND IN

E G Y PT



One of the great achievements of Lord Cromer's policy is an effccrivc body of trained native soldiers

the very guns of the British and French fleets,
and scores of Europeans were murdered.
Both ficcts cleared for action, but the French-
man received a cablegmm to clear for h√©me.

The English admiral then told Arabi how
much time he had in which to dismantle the
Alexandrian forts. Arabi put his hand over
his mouth to restrain his undignilied mcrri,

ment. The English cannon then dismantled
the forts. In retaliation, Arabi prepared to

cut off the water supply of the Europeans in
Alexandria. England hurriedly attended to
the formalities written down in the book of
international etiquette and then landed the
marines.

Arabi left Alexandria and threatened the
Canal. England called on all the Powers to
unite in its protection, but they refused. France
was then asked to help save the work of its
engineers, but the statesmen dcdincrl. Eng-
land then put TommyAtkins here at Ismailia.
Tommy caught Arubi at "l'ul-el-Kchir and
made a good job of it. Arabi disappeared
over the horizon toward Cairo, but two



squadrons of English cavalry rode hard across
the burning sands and Cairo surrendered.
Two days later, London notilied Constantinople
that Tommy would be leaving for home shortly.
That was in 1882, and London would not have
believed that he would be there in 1907.

It was really the Mahdi who blocked the
game. The uprising in the Soudan led Eng-
land to send Gordon to Egypt as Governor-
General of the Soudan, and this was intended
to result in the evacuation of that part of the
country. But when Gordon was making his
singlu-handcd light, begging England to sunl
him just one British regiment to save the
national honor, public sentiment forced the
Gladstone ministry to land more troops on
Egyptian soil. Major Baring had meanwhile
returned to Egypt, landing in the midst of these
stirring events. The most inexplicable thing
in Lord Cromer's career is that Lord \Volseley,
commanding the Gordon relief expedition,
should have been allowed to stay in Cairo long
enough to be just "ct few hours too late to SELVC
the picturesque and daring soldier whose tragic
