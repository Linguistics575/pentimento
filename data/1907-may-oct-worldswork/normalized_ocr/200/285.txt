THE STORY OF ENGLAND IN EGYPT

idea of education is a new proposition. The
schoolgirl, for instance, was formerly an un-
known-almost an unthinkable-quantity; now
there are certainly more than 10,000 girls in
Egyptian schools. The new movement is
only begun, for it is Lord Crvrner's conviction
that Egypt's great need is for agricultural and
trade schools. This system is yet to be built
up, but first must come the primary teaching
now in progress. That the Egyptian, despite
his Moslem traditions, takes kindly to instruc-
tion of a practical character is shown by the
reform school near Cairo. Lord Cromer has
been repeatedly embarrassed by the requests of
Egyptian parents that their children be allowed
to enter this institution-designed only for the
criminal class of boys. It is a remarkable fact
in connection with all his educational work
that Lord Cromer has insisted that the pupils
are not to be taught the English language.
All primary instruction is given in their native
tongue.

The contrast between the old and the new in
higher education can be shown by brief refer-
ence to two great institutions. At Cairo is a
Mohammedan "university," which was old
when the Universities of Oxford, Paris, and
Berlin were founded. Judged by the number
of its pupils, it is one of the largest in the world;
judged by its work, it is one of the dcadest.
Its young men squat around ancient theologues
and commit to memory passages from the
Koran and other books, written in a language
now almost obsolete. The influence of this
"university" is about as progressive as that
of the mummies on exhibition in the great
museum of Cairo.

GORDON MEMORIAL COLLEGE

At Khartum, on the banks of the Nile,
stands Gordon Memorial College-the uni-
versity of today and to-morrow. When the
news reached England that Kitchener had
avenged Gordon, London overflowed into
Trafalgar Square and buried the hero's statue
in flowers. Then came an appeal from the
avenger that a great training school be estab-
lished on the spot where Gordon fell. The re-
sponse was instantaneous. In 1898, Khartum
was the stronghold of the Mahdi's successor.
Now, in less than ten years, it has a college with
three departments: (r) a normal school, training
young men to become teachers and judges; (2)
a primary school for a larger number of pupils,
most of whom will eventually hold g9v¢mmcnt

positions; (3) a manual training department
which will furnish the land with its much.
needed artisans. The plan of Lord Cromer,
which has his succcssor's earnest support,
provides for the establishment of similar
schools in many parts of Egypt.

Much could be said about the improvement
that has come in the direction of sanitation,
better methods of transportation, the every-
day life of the people. A traveler recently
described a trip all the way up the Nile into
Uganda on a steamer equipped with electric
lights, hot and cold baths-and ice! The
following was the menu served 850 miles from
Cairo:

"Potage Julienne
Poisson bouilli, Sauce hollandaise
Grosse piece de Neuf garni
Petits pois a l'Anglaise
Poulet roti

Salads de laitue

Creme renversée
Dessert et Café."

But to those of us who are not tourists, it is far
more comforting to believe that the hard-
working Egyptian peasant has at last a sufficient
quantity of plain, nutritious food for himself
and his family, and forage for his stock.

THE MAN WHO DID THE WORK

For the transformation that has been
wrought, credit must go in large measure to
Lord Cromer. It goes without saying that
much of the work has been accomplished by
his associates, but Cromer deserves credit for
knowing how to pick men for difficult tasks.
It is also much to his credit that he gave his
younger associates full opportunity to dis-
tinguish themselves, when a smaller man would
have taken the honors to himself. Mr. Mob-
erly Bell says that in Cromer's reports he often
mentioned the name of a subordinate as having
procured valuable information or done a par-
ticularly good piece of work, when in reality
the chief was himself entitled to the distinction.

Lord Cromer's career outside of Egypt can
be told in a few words. He graduated from
the military school at the age of seventeen; at
twenty, the young lieutenant was aide-de-camp
to Major-General Storks in the Ionian Isles;
at twenty-five he was in Jamaica. In 1868
he was a captain of artillery. From 1872 to
1876 he was private secretary to Lord North-
brook, Viceroy of India. In 1875 he reached
the rank of major; four years later he retired
