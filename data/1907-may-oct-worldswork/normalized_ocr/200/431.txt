TAFT: A CAREER OF

but there were lawyers on the legislature's
judiciary committee who had a criminal prac-
tice, and the chairman himself said, "Many
a time have I seen when I would hare given all
my fee to have had twenty-four challenges for
the defendant."

As a last resort, the helpless citizens tried to
disbar Campbell, and in this Taft represented
the Bar Association. He made a tcrrilic fight,
but Campbell was strongly entrenched and
the proceedings failed. However, Tait's speech
denouncing the man with the convincing effect-
iveness of a giant's broadaxe, so aroused the
community to the speaker's own intense hatred
of vicious rascality that the blaekleg, like the
blackmailer before him, left town. His clien-
tble scattered. Here was a signal act of useful
citizenship. Again his own words best apply to
him. At a class dinner in New Haven, just
after our war with Spain began, he said:

"There are several kinds of patriotism. We heard in
Alumni Hall this morning of the quiet, self-denying pa-
triatism which is working for the good of all in securing a
better civil government, and which has not the plaudits of
the crowd and the deep gratitude of the people before it
as a reward for labor and self-sacrifice. In the long run,
this kind works more for the good of the country than any
other. It needs not the spur of palpable danger or the
excitement and fervor of war's alarms to rouse it. It is a
constant force making for public righteousness."

MR. TAFT'S MARRIAGE

At this point in Mr. Taft's career, there were
two diversions that require mention. The first
was not of great importance; the second was
very important indeed. The one was his first
Federal job, the second was his marriage. The
Internal Revenue office for the First District of
Ohio gathered in more than $ 1o, cca, cco
annually on whiskey and tobacco, and the
place of collector was not an undesirable one.
President Arthur had on his hands a factional
fight that involved this appointment. For the
sake of harmony, the young man in the prose-
cutor's office was suggested as a compromise,
he being also the son of so prominent a Repub-
lican as Judge Alphonso Taft, and the young
man helped out his party by accepting. He
went to the bottom of tax-collecting methods,
and did not stop until he knew pretty nearly
everything about the business. But then, after
ten months, he resigned to practice law with
his father's old partner, H. P. Lloyd. Col-
lecting money was not congenial to him.

The lady Mr. Taft married was Miss Helen

Herron. Like him, she came of a family of
lawyers. Her father was John W. Herron, ex-

United States District-Attorney, and the partner
of President Hayes; and the President was
"Uncle" to her, and his wife was "Aunt Lucy."
Miss Herron had known \VillTaft from her very
earliest years and the two families were close
friends. After the boy graduated from Yale,
the engagement was announced. She also
fnished college about the same time, but
taught for a while in a private school. She
believes in thorough education for women, that
the woman may with more grace and dignity
preside over the home, which, to her mind, is
"the 10ftiest type of usefulness." Music has
always been her absorbing passion, and Cin,
cinnati was to owe her much as a devoted
patroness of the art. In 1886, he being now mod-
estly established in life, they were married. For
their trip they chose Europe, and a few months
later returned to Cincinnati, to enter upon a
home life that is beautiful in its simplicity.

JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF OHIO

Taft did not practice law any great time be-
fore he was again in the public service. All
told, his private practice has not covered more
than a few months. The office now was that
of assistant eountysolicitor, to which he had been
appointed in 1885. Two years later there came
to him another honor, and for a rising lawyer
of only twenty-nine, it was about the last
hoped for just then. As he himself says, it
fell like a bolt out of a clear sky. Judson
Harmon, later Attorney-General under Clcue,
land, resigned as judge of the Superior
Court of Ohio. Foraker, who was then
Governor, and had himself been a judge in this
court, wished Taft's father-in-law to fill
out the unexpired term, but Mr. Herron de,
dined. Then Harmon, a friend both of
Forakcr and Taft, urged the Governor to
appoint young Taft. Others did the same.
Taft had been working up cases in the solicitor's
olTrce with such industry and effectiveness that
men felt intuitively that the community needed
him for something bigger.

Now a certain coolness had fallen between
Will Taft and the Governor at the time. There
was Taft's unrelenting activity against the
machine, for instance. And besides, Foraker
had appeared for the defense, on the criminal
side, when Tom Campbell was tried. But
Foraker was generous and impulsive, and so
the bolt out of the clear sky lifted the young
