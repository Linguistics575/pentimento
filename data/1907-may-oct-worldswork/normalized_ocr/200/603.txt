other companies noted above. They can also
be surmounted in the trade of selling high
class bonds, once the tradition of the Wall Street
banker is laid aside. That tradition makes a
bond a $ 1, cco instrument, and makes the
investor a rich man. No intelligent effort has
ever been made to give to the smaller investor
the same chance that is afforded to the larger
investor in railroad and l1igh-class industrial
bonds. It is time that such an effort be made.

Turning from bonds, the small saver of
money may fu1d some field in the guaranteed
stocks, usually issued in lots of $ 100 but fre-
quently in shares of $ 50 or $ 25. These stocks
are mostly the capital of small railroads and
industrials leased by the great railroads and
trusts. The Pennsylvania, New York Central,
Baltimore & Ohio, Delaware, Lackawanna &
Western, all have solid guaranteed stocks.
Some of them sell very high. Most of the
stocks guaranteed by the Eastern railroads
yield the investor little more than 4 per cent.
They have the advantage, however, of being
tax-free. like most stocks. Also, they are
perfectly safe. Almost any strong banking
house will furnish a list of such stocks on re-
quest, with prices. A few good banking
houses in Wall Street make a specialty of
them. As a class, the writer believes that
there is no other form of investment better than
this for the man who would save his money in
small blocks.

The list of railroad stocks and of industrials,

of course, affords an unlimited field. la the
great majority of cases, however, THE WORLD'S
WORK hesitates to advise taking them for
savings. If a man wants to buy stocks of this
sort, it is f1r better to buy the good, solid, pro-
ferred stocks of the best roads than to buy the
common stocks, subject to wide changes in
1irice, up or down, and subject to market
ir1fiuences of various. sorts. At a time like the
present, a man might well select stocks like
Baltimore & Ohio preferred, Norfolk & West-
em preferred, Union Pacific preferred, Atchison
preferred, and put his savings into them. The
only danger is that if a man gets the habit of
buying these listed stocks he is apt to persist in
it, both in booms and depressions. Unless he
wants to be called upon to use considerable
discretion at all times, he might far better leave
the listed stocks entirely alone.

It will be seen that there is an answer to the
query with which this article began. The
field is fairly wide, but not yet wide enough.
The most desirable of all the chances for invest-
ment is still practically closed to the regular
saver of small funds. That it will be opened
soon is the belief and the hope of the writer.
In the meantime, the saver of this character
may find his best chance in the stocks, or even
in the real-estate field if he is able to discrimi Â»
nate. We do not recommend investment
through insurance policies. If you want in-
surance, for its own sake, buy it; but it is not
a profitable form of investment.

THE ADVANTAGES TO A BUSINESS HOUSE OF INVESTING

A PERCENTAGE OF ITS SAVINGS IN

GILT-EDGE BONDS

WO men, after the habit of Americans,
I were talking business on the train.
Said the man from New York to the
man from Chicago:
"Your house, you say, is ten years olrl; how
have you prospered?"
Said the man from Chicago:
"Judge for yourself. I started with nothing
but an unbounded faith in myself. I now own
$ 25,000 worth of bricks and mortar in a build-

ing, $ 20,000 worth of steel and iron in the shape
of machinery, $ 50,000 worth of manufactured
goods. But"--and his face lighted up with
pride-" } have $ 2,000 worth of gilt-edge rail-
road bonds."

The New York man studied over this for a
long time, with the result that the incident
changed his philosophy of business manage-
ment. He saw that of all the possessions of
his Chicago friend, the ownership of some
