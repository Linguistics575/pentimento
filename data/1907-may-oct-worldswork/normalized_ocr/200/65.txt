THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD

a dry season for some years; certainly two or
three million from these regions alone."

"But you only pay from four to ten cents
for these."

"Oh, no, we don't. We pay from twenty-
five cents to forty cents a skin for especially
good ones. That means between $ 500,000
and $ 8oo, ooo a year for muskrat alone in those
two sections. It was only in the early times
and in especially good years that seal or sea-
otter yielded more a year than that. Then,
take skunk skin: The demand for skunk skin
is so much greater than the supply that men in
the West are running skunk farms; and for
the skins they receive the same price as used to
be paid for beaver-all the way to $ 2 and $ 3,
according to grade.

"The same with fox skins. The demand is
greater every day. We pay all the way from
$ 250 to $ 750 for a pure silver fox, though
if a millionaire fancier should offer us $ 10,000
for a prize silver fox, we of course would not
refuse him. The average for silver fox runs
about $ 200 or $ 300; for red fox, $ 5 down the
grade; for gray fox, from $ r down; for cross
fox, from 3315 down. These are higher prices
than were paid for beaver in its palmiest days."

"Will this growing demand for furs lead to
the extermination of fur-bearing animals?"

"Never! In the first place, fashion is as
capricious as the wind. Trade doesn't create
fashion. It is fashion that creates trade,
What is fashion? There you have me!
Fashion in the fur trade is simply this: one
woman or man takes a fancy to try some new
wrinkle and has it made to order, say a chin-
chilla stole, or a sable-trimmed cape, or a mink
coat. Some one else sees it and orders one
like it. That special fur then becomes the
fashion and prices go up. Word goes out to
the trappers. They pursue that fur most
because it pays the best. While that fashion
is in, other furs get a rest and the animals
multiply. For instance, a few years back
mink was not wanted; so mink became plenti-
ful. Now mink is the fashion; and there are
mink enough to supply the demand till fancy
takes up something else.

"But there is another way in which the trade
protects the fur-bearing animals. Poison spoils
the pelt, fevers the animals, and takes the
glossy life from the fur. We don't give paying
prices for the skin of a poisoned animal. That
discourages poisoning. Again, animals killed
out of season-m summer or when mothers are

bearing their young-done yield fur that pays
the trapper for his trouble. Consequently,
trapping for money is confined to the mid-
winter months for the heavily furred animals.
That gives the animals eight months out of
twelve as chances against the hunter. The
fact that we don't pay for skins taken out of
season is the best protection for game."

THE WORLD-MARKETS OF THE FUR TRADE

Without attempting to enumerate all the great
fur companies now doing an enormous bus-
iness in America, it may be stated that the raw
furs converge to some half dozen places: in
Canada to Montreal, Winnipeg, and Edmonton;
in the United States to St. Paul, St. Louis, San
Francisco, Chicago, and New York. Not one
of these places is in the true sense a fur market
for the world. It is more a receiving depot or
a clearing house, where that required for domes-
tic supply is sorted out to be manufactured,
while the great bulk is sent forward to the three
famous fur markets of the world, London,
Leipsic, Nijni Novgorod-in other words, to
England, Germany, Russia. To these three
great marts come all the best furs of the whole
world-even the seals of the North America
Commercial Company, which come back to
America in coats, the sea otter of the Aleutians,
the beaver and marten and mink of Hudson
Bay, the ermine and sable of Russia, the lamb
skins of Persia, the nutria and chinchilla of
South America. Here congregate all the buyers
of the fur world and the sellers, though the
actual purchasing is done by expert fur brokers.

In London, the furs are sold by auction at
such well-known sales as Lampson's, Nesbitt's,
and the Hudson's Bay Company. Annually,
an average of nearly $ 5,000,000 worth of raw
furs is sold in London. After thorough ex-
amination of the pelts as classified, the buyers
assemble before the auctionecr-sometimes
in a huge glass-lighted room at the top of the
warehouses, or away from the furs altogether
in some regular sales room. The bidding is
the very opposite of the wild scramble in the
New York Stock Exchange, where a thousand
yells assail buyer and seller. At the fur sales,
a silent nod of the head knocks down a bid.

Formerly, these sales were more picturesque.
They were held at some well-known coffee-
house, with the classihed pelts stacked up at
one side. Buyers were regaled with sumptuous
dinners by the sellers. Then, a lighted candle
with pins stuck in at intervals was put up.
