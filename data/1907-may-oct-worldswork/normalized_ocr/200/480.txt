9278 THE MARCH

Influence in the Senate is not proportionate
to age, of course, but to a very considerable
degree it is proportionate to the length of
service; and most of these aged Senators have
had long service. As younger men succeed the
late aged Senators from Alabama (though the
new Senators, Bankhead and Johnston, are both
past sixty), younger men will within a few
years fill the places of the present Senators who
have passed seventy-five. The Senate may not
cease to be a body largely made up of venerable
men, as it now is, but it may not for some time
again have so many aged members.

Yet the high average of age is in no sense a
misfortune. The House of Representatives
always has many young men, often too many
that are too young, at least in experience. That
is the end of the Capitol where initiative and
audacity find their proper place. The objection-
able obstruction that the Senatesometimesshows
is not always, perhaps not often, the work of the
aged Senators; and the worst Senatorial mis-
fortunes that we have suffered-the misfortune
of having Senators who represented special
privileges- cannot be charged to their age.

These recent changes and the changes that
are likely to come in the near future will causea
new distribution of power and of leadership;
and the new political conditions that we face
will give a chance for men who have hitherto
been relatively obscure or who-and this is
more likely-have not yet gone into the Senate
at all. There, as elsewhere in our political life,
brilliant opportunities of leadershipare brought
just now by changing policies and methods.

THE PROHIBITION WAVE OVER THE SOUTH

F the advancing wave of prohibition keeps
its present rate for a few years, most of
the Southern States will be "dry." By out-
right prohibition, by high license, by local
option, and by the dispensary system, 90
counties of the 119 in Kentucky, most of North
Carolina (all except a few towns), South
Carolina, Mississippi, most of Texas, nearly
all of Tennessee (except the larger cities), and
now Georgia are closed to the liquor-, traffic.
This is a wave of prohibition as strong as
that which swept over northern New
England and some of the Western States a
generation ago, and it is due to similar causes.
First of all, of course, is the evil of the drink
habit, the habit especially of strong drink. In
this the South has, perhaps, suffered some-
what worse results in recent years than some

OF EVENTS

other parts of the Union because of its lack of
industrial organization. Where industry has
been compactly organized, drunkenness has
been greatly lessened. These states have, too,
a large irresponsible population-that is, a
population which social punishments do not
deter-such as a considerable part of the
Negroes and the less successful rural whites.

Then what may be called Puritanism in the
churches, for the lack of a better name, has a
stronger influence in these states now than in
any other part of the Union. The preacher is
still a real power there, and the evangelist type
of the preacher sways the multitude. This
influence-the strong emotionalism of religion
-always makes directly for prohibitive laws.
Thus the present prohibition wave affords a
measure both of the industrial and of the
religious development of the states. They
have gone beyond the old-timc Democratic
doctrine that the state should not undertake
"sumptuary" legislation, but they have not
reached either that density of population or of
industrial organization wherein the drinking
habits of the least responsible part of the popu-
lation may be left to police regulation. This
part of the population, moreover, is a rural
population that knows few sports and that has
few mild drinks.

High license and local option and the local
dispensary system have proved to be enforce.
able and, therefore, effective. Our experience
with prohibition has not been so conclusive.
By the evidence of the disinterested, it has in
many parts of M: ine "one more harm to char,
acter than mere drinking did: it has not stopped
drinking and has incited to other sins. In
Kansas it has worked better. The success of
it depends, of course, wholly upon the public
sentiment of the community.

The anti-drink movement in the South is a
forward movement, for it has a directly good
moral and economic influence wherever the
laws are enforceable; and they are enforceable,
especially the local-option prohibitory laws,
over a very wide area; and it is a part of the
strong tendency toward organization.
