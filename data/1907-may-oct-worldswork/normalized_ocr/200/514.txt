In several stores lunch rooms are supported
by the management, where healthful and
nourishing food is provided at prices which
do not nearly cover its cost.

"We figure on a loss of about $ 5,000 a year
in the lunch room," said one manager, "but
we consider the money well invested, as we
have found that the girls' health-and conse-
quently their scrvices to us is better because
of the better food."

In several of the large stores, hospitals with
doctors and nurses in attendance are pro-
vided for the women. If a girl feels ill she is
at once sent up to the hospital, where a trained
nurse receives her and calls the house doctor
if necessary. All medical attention is paid for
by the store, the girls paying only for their
medicine.

In one store, where three thousand girls
and women are employed, a pleasant recreation
room is provided, with plenty of comfortable
easy-chairs, a piano, books and magazines on
the tables, and a waxed floor, where they may
dance or rest and chat for a few minutes
when they have finished their luncheon.

A number of the wealthier stores maintain
summer homes in the country for their girls,
where they are sent for their two weeks' vacation.
The girls are not treated here as charity girls
but as the guests of their employers, some of
whom have their own wives and daughters
there to receive them and help to entertain
and make them comfortable.

In most of the larger shops benefit asso-
ciations are maintained, and in a number of
the better class stores the money collected under
the fine system, which is much the same in all
the department stores of New York, is turned
over to the Employees' Benefit Fund.

OBEDIENCE TO LABOR LAWS GENERAL

The laws governing the employment of
women and children are both rigid and com-
prehensive, and these, I found on close investi-
gation, are fairly well observed. Most of the
girls employed are over sixteen, with a few cash-
girls and messengers between fourteen and
fifteen. In the higher class shops the cash-
girl system has been largely supplanted by an
electric system which is both safer and quicker.
In the smaller shops the cash-girls are still to
be found, many of them looking so pitifully
young and small that one at first disbelieves
the statement that they are all over fourteen
years of age. A careful and rigid investigation,

WHAT IS A SHOP-GIRL'S LIFE?

conducted both within and outside the estab-
lishment, however, convinced the writer that
young and childish as many of these over-
worked little wage-earners appear, it is rare
that children under the age limit are to be
found. To the manager or proprietor who is
thinking more of results than of wages, the mere
child, barely fourteen or under, is no longer
desirable.

"It is not only that we are compelled by the
child-labor laws to be extremely particular
about the age of our young employees," said
the manager of one large department store,
"but our own interests demand it. We find that
it does not pay us to have a lot of irresponsible
youngsters under foot who are always where
they are not wanted, and never to be found
where they are. To do the work we require
of our cash-girls they must read and write well,
and be fairly quick and accurate at figures.
These qualifications we have not found in the
younger applicants, and we seldom employ
a girl under sixteen. Although there are now
more than eighteen hundred girls and women
on our payroll, there are only thirty-five of them
under the age of sixteen years."

In even the cheapest stores the laws requiring
that suitable, cleanly, and sanitary retiring
rooms be provided are fairly well observed;
and the law requiring that seats be provided
for girls and women has been almost ur1iversally
complied with, usually in the form of a stool
swung upon springs, which folds under the
counter when not in use.

The laws regulating the hours of work for
women and children are also very generally
observed. No employee under sixteen years
of age may be permitted to work more than
fifty-four hours in any one week, or more than
nine hours in any one day; and no female
employee over the age of sixteen may be per-
mitted to work more than sixty hours in any
one week or more than ten hours in any one
day, except to make shorter some other day
of the week.

Most of the stores close at 5:30; and forty-
five to sixty minutes are allowed for lunch. A
special provision has been made by the law
for extra hours of work during the Christmas
holidays, and for these most of the stores give
adequate extra payment.
