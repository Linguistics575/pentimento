other cases, he is a partner in a cooperative
building group, that makes for its people com-
fortable homes at less cost than they could
build their several houses. He has learned to
co6perate in the saving of money. Penn-
sylvania, with its big classes of skilled labor,
is the heart and centre of the cooperative
building and loan business of the United
States. The laboring man is working out his
own freedom from the tenement and the slum.

Of course, there is misery, as there always
must be. The point of the situation is that
the average man, who is compounded of the
high, the middle, and the low, to-day has money
to spend. In an age when it is the fashion to
abuse the trusts, and to accuse them of
robbing the people of their sustenance, this
fact alone is of vital interest. Perhaps it is
even more interesting to note that coal, sugar,
steel, and railroad transportation to-day cost
the average man considerably less money than
they cost him twenty-iive years ago. That is
she of the principal reasons why he has more
money to spend on education, art, and creature
comforts.

LIFTING A SHADOW FROM MILLIONS OF LIVES

HE reception given to the special Southern

number of THE WORLD'S WORK is
a gratifying indication that this great undcvcl Â»
oped part of the United States is now at last
rapidly to be brought under productive activity,
both by the people who now live there and
by an increasing immigration. Great wealth
is already every year got from Southern soil
and mines and forests and factories, but its
production is yet only a promise of a greater
yield.

There is one kind of opportunity there that
makes an especially strong appeal-an appeal
that goes deeper than the usual economic
chance and that has a profound social signifi,
cance. There is a shadow that begins in
middle life to darken every man's way who
has only a small income; and this class in-
cludes most of the population. First, how
may he give his children a fair chance? Then
how may he provide for his own unproductive
years and for his wife in her old age? This
thought clouds all good men's happiness till
they solve it. In the uncertain fortunes of
industrial life in cities, it is hard to solve.
Shifting engagements and shifting values, the
increasing expense of living, the ever-changing
organization of industry make security seem

less and less certain except to the few that
are either unusually fortunate or strong.

The opening of the West answered this
question to millions of men a generation or
two ago; and the Homestead Act added to
human happiness inealculably. A quarter
section of good land meant security. Good
land cannot be had in the South quite so
cheap as it was got in the West; but it can be
had by any capable man who is able to proiit
by it. And the enormously increased attrac-
tiveness of agricultural life will for another
generation or two remove this great shadow
from other millions of lives. A truck farm
or a cotton farm means a competence to the
industrious man and to his children. To
estimate the value to American character and
American development of these sunlit fields
during the next half century or more would
tax the imagination of the boldest economist.

TEE HARDEST TASK 0F CIVILIZATION

o FIND out how to prevent want-that

is, doubtless, the gravest problem of
civilization; and thc advocates of every sort of
social or economic change have their theories.
Experiments, some hopeful but most of them
merely alleviating at best, go on all the while.
We have reduced charity to a sort of science.
But the underworld remains with us, pitiful,
threatening, ever perpetuating itself.

This worlrold problem is not likely to be
solved soon nor by any single force that is now
at work. But, if civilization is ever to become
worthy of its name and pretentions, it must be
solved some time; and every well-directed effort
ought to be hailed with encouragement.

The Sage foundation of ten millions of dol-
lars for the betterment of the poor-for finding
out, first of all, how life on lower levels can be
permanently betteral--is such an effort; and
it is in the hands of wise and tmselfish men.
Mr. John M. Glenn is the executive officer of
the foundation; and no man living has in more
earnest measure the good wishes of all good
people than he. It is a wise use of a great sum
of money and a noble use of one's life to
attack this central grave task of civilization
in a sympathetic and scientific way.
