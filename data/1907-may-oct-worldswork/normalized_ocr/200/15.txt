OLITICS is sometimes war, and this
is one of the times, especially in
Republican politics. The contest is,

and is to be, between that part of the party
which favors Mr. Rooscrult's policies and
that part which opposes them; and the
most pronounced enemies of these policies
are, of course, some of the great railroad and
corporation "Interests." This conflict came
suddenly to a sharp clash with the collision of
the President and Mr. Harriman; and the
story divides itself into two parts.

The first part has to do with the present
split in the Republican party. The conflict
has been made an open one by the President;
and, as usual, he takes the people into his con-
fidence. There is no doubt that the mass of
people are opposed to the polit al domination,
or even to the suspected political domination,
of the corporations. The President will win
in this contest in spite of the violence that he
does to the traditions of his office, which are
traditions of dignifwd silence under attack.
Yet, when we speak of traditions of dignified
silence, it is well to recall that Andrew Jackson
once held the Presidential offrcc, and he, too,
was a good fighter.

Whatever plans the Great Interests may
have or may make against the President's
policy, he and his friends have one weapon
that they lack-the confidence of the people;
and the people the millions of people-are
not sticklers for gentle manners. And they
do like a fight. If the fight be against political
eorruptionists, so much more to their liking.

code of morals has dug his grave, and the
President is again fortunate in his enemies.

THE SCANDAL 0F CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS

HE other part of the story of these recent

events has to do with the scandal of
campaign contributions. Why tell again that
sordid story? All large campaign managers
have received contributions for which favors
were expected; and they always will receive
them so long as two things cxist- (r) the pro-
teetive tariff, and (2) secrecy about the origin
and use of these funds. Mr. Harriman LW-
pected pay, in some form, for his contribution A
that's the kind of man that Mr. Harriman is.
And most men who make large contributions
are like him, and they have generally got what
they paid for. That is the greatest scandal in
our political life.

Most men would have known that Mr.
Harriman and his like vxpucterl pay in some
form for the contributions. If the President
and his eampuign managers did not know this,
then -well, then-of course they knew it.
That Mr. Roosevelt ever promised tiny Ircry
or protection or tuvor for tiny vontrilpution,
nobody ever for a moment helieyetl. But
that whole system of campaigning, is mulodnr
ous; for the devil pays the bill. And even
if you afterwards kick the devil downstairs,
you may salve your soul, but what uhout
accepting his help and then having to puursh
him? It were better not to have his help.
