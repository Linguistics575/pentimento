the passes of the mountains. Here go the axe-
men to clear a path for the guiding fiag of the
"front Mg-man." Behind them trails the
transit-man to measure the distances and the
angles; and with him comes his staff of axe-
men and flag-men. Behind him, again, follows
the leveller, to record the levels, and with him
are axe-men and rod-men. Sometimes there
follows a topographer, somewhat of an artist,
who makes a clay model of the general con-
tour, not merely of the line but of the country
round about as well. So they travel on their
way, merely making notes as they go, and
leaving here a stake, and there another stake.

When the light fails, they travel back to
camp. In flat country, where the work is
swift, the camp moves on as the men progress,
making fast stages. In plotting a route through
the mountains, the camp is usually located
at one point for weeks. In such a case, light
shacks spring up; but usually the work is done
under canvas. A tent serves for kitchen,
dining-room, and commissary. Another shel,
tcrs the rod-men, axe-men, transit-men, and
levellers. Yet another covers the heads of the
survey. In this last, work goes on by night
as well as by day. The notes of the day's
work are gone over, plotted, made into a rough
sketch of the line surveyed.

THE REWARDS OE BRILLIANT WORK

It is no easy life, but it has many compen-
sations. In exceptional cases, two or three
years in the ranks lead to a promotion to be
an assistant engineer on some great project.
This happened in the case of General Dodge,
and in the case of the late Alexander J. Cassatt.
As a rule, however, progress is made through
the regular routine, from axe-man to rod-man,
then transit-man, then leveller, then assistant
engineer. From this routine have graduated
many of the men whose names stand high in
the list of railroad officials of America. Hence
came the president of the Pennsylvania, James
McCrea, and the third vice-president, Samuel
Rea. Howard Elliott, H. B. Ledyard, W. J.
Wilgus, and dozens of others of high rank
began their work carrying an axe or a chain in
a surveying party. To-day it would perhaps
be invidious to try to declare that any one man
overtops his fellows among the locating engin-
ccrs. In the profession, John M. Graham
of the Erie, E. H. McHenry of the New Haven,
William Hood of the Southern Pacific, and J.
B. Berry of the Rock Island enjoy great reputa-

done and the positions that they have won.

THE WORK OF THE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEER

The "locating cngineer" does not do all
the work by any means. He but outlines the
work that is to be done. When the "location"
is completed, there follows the task of building
according to that location. In this work, the
construction engineer takes command. He
belongs to a class that covers all branches,
civil and mechanical engineering, bridge build-
ing, and that rare faculty that finds its expres-
sion in the executive handling of great armies of
men. It is in this field that the greatest danger
to life is encountered, and here it is that the
finest genius of the American railroad builder
has found its expression. The keynote of the
successful construction engineer is resource-
fulness. He must be stopped by nothing in
the world.

"Can you build a one per cent. line through
the Sierras?" I asked, dubiously, one of the
consulting engineers of the Western Pacific.

"Sure we can-and we will," he said, "for
if you give an engineer enough money he can
build any kind of a line anywhere."

To-day, the profile of that road shows a
maximum grade of only one per cent., fsity-
two feet to the mile, through the snow-capped
mountains that, of all others, seemed most'
forbidding.

The grade has not been easy to obtain.
To get it the builders have upset most of
the traditions of the Sierra Nevada. They
have passed "impassable" hills, and sounded
"bottomless "chasms; they have made a path
through "pathless" forests, and tunnelled
through tr impenetrable" mountain ranges.
They have called upon the flower of the engi-
neering profession, it is true, and have spent
the money of the Goulds as a spendthrift
throws his wealth to the winds. But they
have done the thing that many men of many
decades have declared was a thing impossible.
They have run a low-grade line through the
crests of the Sierras.

The engineer who has charge of the con-
struction of such a line has a difficult task
indeed. If he is given the two termini and
told merely to get a line between them with
so much grade, the task is relatively easy.
He will run his road around in circles, picking
his way along a river bed, making spirals about
some towering peak, following the mcanderings
