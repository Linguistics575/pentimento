9488 WHEN TO USE A LAWYER

disposing of a small estate, on account of the com-
plications that may arise. Many contingencies
must be foreseen and anticipated, and to effectu-
ate the intention of a will requires considerable
foresight, clear expression, and the avoidance
of many technical perils. A correct will is of
great value; a careless one frequently does
positive damage. Guardians, executors, trus-
tees, sales, loans, and investments frequently
must be provided for, and in the skilful handling
of these provisions the attorney's fees may be
saved several times over. Unskilful persons
unintentionally and unknowingly insert terms
in the paper which are a great detriment to the
persons concerned. Debts which cannot be
raised for a long time are frequently charged
against the land and the title is thereby encum-
bered and rendered unmarketable. Through
an imprudent disposition of the estate, so many
practical obstacles may be encountered that the
title may become seriously involved and ex-
pensive court proceedings be made necessary.

Any one who acts in a fiduciary capacity--
such as executor, guardian, or trustee-must
have legal aid and can charge the cost of the
same to the estate which he represents. There
is a general principle of law that persons who
act in the representative capacity are entitled
to nothing whatever beyond their commission--
in other words, that their acts may entail loss
to themselves but may not produce gain.
Furthermore, one trustee or executor may be-
come liable for the default of his co-trusty or
co-executor. Yet, in spite of the danger which
may occur, fiduciaries frequently assume risk
from pure carelessness. They have a habit of
acting first and consulting a lawyer afterward.

WHEN FACING PROBABLE BANKRUPTCY

Business men not infrequently hang on to the
point of actual bankruptcy before they seek
advice. It should be unnecessary to state that
time should not be wasted until the assets are
dissipated before action. In such cases, little
can be done in the way oi settlement or adjust-
ment in the absence of cash to pay expenses.
However, if taken at the proper time, before the
danger is imminent and while the client is still
in a position to dictate terms, many business
concerns which otherwise would run into
almost total loss to both debtor and creditor
may be reorganized.

The lawyer always endeavors so to arrange
transactions that whatever is done can be
proved, and proved without running the gaunt-

let of a multitude of technical objections. The
popular practice, however, is to neglect the
proof until a suit is necessary, and usually until
much of it is destroyed or in the hands of an
oppoment. Judging by this practice, one
might think that proper system required that
the names and addresses of witnesses should be
immediately forgotten and all documents in
the case consigned to the waste-basket.

WHEN A SUIT IS THREATENED

The settlement of actual or threatened litiga-
tion has to-day become almost an art. To
ascertain the present value of a future trial is
often the problem to be decided. To reach
this decision requires a practical knowledge of
the technical advantages, as well as the equities
of the case. In both respects, the knowledge of
the attorney is superior to the client's. His view
is less personal, and success in his profession
requires that he examine both sides of a dispute.
Litigation is costly to all concerned. One side
must lose in every trial, and the gain of the other
side is frequently less than the indirect loss. In
proportion to the amount involved, trial-fees
are large and office-fees small. The trial of a
case may consume days and even months, and
the preparation for it generally requires more
time than the legal proceedings. In addition,
all parties are subject to a heavy strain, and
entire success for either side is the exception.
To-day, not only the weak cases but also the
strong, are settled out of court, for these reasons,
and generally with considerable profit to the
client; his net balance, after deducting counsel
fees, exceeds the amount, often by several times,
that he can obtain unaided. The client seldom
understands the advantages and disadvantages
of his position.

The indirect gain to a client must not be over-
looked. The assistance of the counsel prcduces
a sense of security and induces courage. The
office of a lawyer is a clearing-house for infor-
mation in his line, and the lawyer of to-day must
be a man of affairs. His advice on business
questions that incidently arise is of not less
benefit than his legal advice. This advice is
open to the inexperienced and the poor, as well
as the rich, and tends to produce an equality of
position. Clients must be educated in the
habits that render them to some extent self
protecting, and they can only be taught by
practical experience the cases which they can
decide for themselves and those that require
assistance,
