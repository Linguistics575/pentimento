a swallow builds her nest; there, again, they
sluiced great rifts in the hills to fill their trestles
with gravel.

Sometimes these mountain roads turn round
upon themselves, making great loops merely
to gain a few feet of climb. To make two
miles, the Canadian Pacific train in one plaice
travels nearly seven miles, and turns enough

corners to make twelve complete circles. At
Georgetown, Col., the Union Pacific gains a
few yards of height by a great loop; and this
is a method that is not at all uncommon. The
Gothard Tunnel, in Europe, makes two com-
plete circles in the very heart of the mountain
itself. It is on the principle of a spiral, and is
only used to overcome a rise too sharp to be
surmounted by any direct line that could be
surveyed.

The result of high grade engineering skill

One of the greatest difficulties that confront
the construction engineer is the rift in the
mountain side. If the road is following a
ledge along the cliff and comes suddenly upon
a great deep chasm running far into the hill,
heroic methods are needed. Across such a
