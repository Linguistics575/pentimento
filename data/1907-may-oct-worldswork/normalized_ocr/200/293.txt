York City handled 23,175 cases and

spent less than $ 23,000. More than
23,000 people who would otherwise have been
defrauded were given justice at a cost of less than
$ 1 apiece. Probably there is no money spent
in the United States which does so much toward
planting a faith in our democracy among the
immigrants that come to our shores.

This movement began in a small way. In
1876, some German merchants in New York
were so bothered with requests for legal aid
by immigrants from their own country that
twenty of them hired a lawyer to take care of
these complaints. He was known as "The
German Legal Aid Society." At a later date,
the scope was extended and the present or-
ganization confines itself to no one nationality.
The president of the society, Mr. Arthur von
Briesen, like Carl Schurz' and Jacob Riis,
came to New York filled with the greatest
admiration for the young Republic. He was
poor, and during his early years in this country
he came to realize how hard it was for foreigners
without money and without knowledge of our
court procedure to engage counsel or press
their suits in court. When the Legal Aid
Society outgrew its purely German character,
Mr. von Briesen became a member. He had
saved enough money to study law and, after
service in the Civil War, he took up his pro-
fession and built up a large practice. In 1890,
the chance came for him to lead in the work
which so deeply interested him as a young
man. He was elected president of the New
York Legal Aid Society because, as he said,
"there was no other fool on whose hands to let
it die." He has been at its head ever since and
he has seen the Society quadruple in size under
his direction. A year or two ago, the French
Government decorated him with the cross of
the Legion of Honor in recognition of his great
services to the poor.

The New York Society was the pioneer.
Since its founding, similar organizations have
arisen in most of the large cities of this country
-Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Newark,
Hoboken, Pittsburg, Cleveland, Chicago, and
Denver. It is such a practical benevolence (for
it is supported chiefly by subscription), that it
has been copied abroad. London has a
similar organization and there are others else-
where in Europe.

The work in New York is carried on through
six offices, which are conducted in the same
manner as the office of any large law firm. One
of the attorneys in charge finds out whether the
applicant is able to engage private counsel.
If the case is one which properly comes within
the Society's scope, a full statement is made
out and the applicant becomes a regular client.
In each case a retaining fee of ten cents is
charged, but when this sum cannot be paid,
the attorney is allowed to remit it. Ten per
cent. of amounts collected above $ 5 is charged,
and this, together with the retaining fees, is
paid into the Society's treasury.

In the first year of its existence, the New
York Society handled 202 cases; in 1906,
3,175, and, in the first thirty years, 206,916
cases. The amount collected and paid
to clients during this thirty years was
$ 1,182,453.10. Of the 23,175 clients during
the year 1906, 7,154 were Americans, 3,434
were Russians, 3,412 were Germans, 3,122 were
subjects of Great Britain, and 3,017 were
Austro-Hungarians. More than half of the
applicants were men and more than half of
these had not yet become citizens of the United
States.

The best exposition of the work actually
accomplished is given by a few specific cases.
Take, for example, the following case handled
by the East-Side Branch, which does most of
its work among the Jews: A loan company,
doing business under the title of "The
