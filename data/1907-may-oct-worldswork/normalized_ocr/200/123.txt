OUR RELATIONS WITH JAPAN

composition of the nation, sclf-intercst is
beginning to master self-respect. It is safe
to say that the Japanese Government has no
particular sympathy for the ardent youths who
leave Japan in order to better their condition;
the best practical education, including in-
struction in English, can be had at home.
Secondary schools are being multiplied daily.
The primary schools have a much larger aver-
age of attendance than such schools in America,
and include a scope of subjects and a thor,
oughness of method hardly to be met with
anywhere else. A little incident at Iriye the
other day proves this clearly. A distinguished
Japanese (formerly president of the Tokyo Uni-
versity) offered to present the portrait of some
famous man or woman to the Iriye primary
school, on condition that the children-343
boys and girls-should themselves choose
the subject of the picture. These pupils,
between six and fourteen years of age, wrote
down their votes with the following results:
George Washington 69, Abraham Lincoln 53,
Admiral Togo 28. The fifth in popularity
was Benjamin Franklin, and the list included,
besides the names of some famous Japanese,
those of Florence Nightingale, Nelson, Bis,
marck, Napoleon, Galileo, Socrates, Columbus,
Roosevelt, Peter the Great, and Admiral
Makharoff. The list would be hard to beat
for excellence and breadth of sympathy.

To return to the subject of the older students,
the knowledge of business forms can be ac-
quired more readily in the United States and
pay for all kinds of work IS higher here than 1n
Japan; hence the eager desire to get to America.
But the Japanese Government has no wish to
see thousands of able-bodied young men leave
the country in order to grow rich. The true
wealth of Japan, its careful and extended cul-
ture of such valuable crops as tea, silk, and
rice, must suffer heavily unless some check be
put on emigration. The country needs its
young men; the enormous sum of five hun-
dred million dollars has been invested in new
enterprises since the close of the war; and
there is no lack of steady lucrative employment
for qualified workers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL INCIDENT

But these opportunities are not good enough
for the crude new element in Japan. Its eyes
are dazzled by visions of wealth; and since
money-making is the gift (how utterly the
bane they do not dream!) of America, the

United States is still the goal of their desires.
Deep, therefore, will be the disappointment
inflicted by the new regulations arising from
the San Francisco school affair. Why the
California legislators should have put forward
such a pretext for the real exclusion bill which
they wanted, is something of a mystery. The
hardship of having to seat 69 Japanese children
in schools designed for a population of close
on 400,000, located on an area covering forty-
two square miles, was too infinitesimal to be
sympathized with. (The twenty-four pupils
who were over sixteen could have been ex-
eluded without appeal.) The seriousness with
which the plea was argued would be laughable
had not the gravest of issues, an infringement
of treaty rights, been involved. If one state
can refuse to be bound by a treaty ratified at
Washington, then all may do so, and no
future treaty will be worth the signature of a
foreign power.

The Japanese Government has taken this
point alone into consideration, and maintained
an attitude of calmness, trusting implicitly
to the Presidente, decision. But the indica-
tion of dcep-seated hostility must inflict an-
other lasting wound on the confidence in
Arnerica's professions of friendship. It had
been generally accepted as an axiom: "There
will never be any necessity to stand on the
defensive with this good neighbor." The
attitude of America during the last fifty years
had so far overcome the inborn scepticism of
the Japanese that they still believed in the
sincerity of the old sentimental cry, "Hands
across the sea." England had made most of
its early entrances into Japan in full armor,
scattering gunboats around as visiting cards;
Commodore Perry landed with a hymn-book
in his hand-the mother of a friend of mine
still remembers his cheery voice leading the
hymns of praise on the shore at Uragc-and,
in spite of his curt and emphatic methods,
managed to create an impression of friendliness.
This was confirmed when peace descended on
the country after the struggles attending the
Restoration, and did not wear off till the au-
tumn of 1905, when, in the full swing of the
Portsmouth negotiations, the American press
made its sudden right-about-face in favor of
Russia.

That, I think, was the definite beginning of
the disillusionment. When the announcement
of the peace terms was received with public
protestations in Japan, the disillusionment
