A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

an educational system, who lazily compiled
lists of inaccurate figures, drew pitiful salaries,
and published dull reports that had no particu-
lar meaning. In these same olliecs now, or
bigger and better ofiices, you find a sialf of
men and women at work who are ready to

will show you photographs of children plantirg

kept, neat, and accurate reports which show
an enormous increase of expenditure and

schools which are maintained by private sub-
scription or by religious sects have been suc-
cessful in increasing their endowments; and,
best of all, you will find that the schools now
have local support-support by ever-increasing

local taxation. And no school or other insti-
tution can permanently exist on any basis but
the basis of local support.

You will find everywhere the spirit of coopera-
lion. There was a time when every institution
was conducted only with reference to itself.
Now l is conducted with reference to all the
others, and with reference to the secondary
schools. The annual conferences for education
in the South have been both cause and effect
of this change. An enthusiasm for cooperation
