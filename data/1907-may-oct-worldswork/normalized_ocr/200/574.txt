No such thing is likely to happe" in this
case, for the little shop with the thrilling price-
list appeals to a permanent instinct in a class
of cultured purchasers that is steadily growing
more numerous. People who can afford them
will always pay high for useful things made
by hand-and for three reasons: their beauty,
their individuality, and their associations.
There is a certain dryness, a certain stiffness,
a certain insipidity and shoddiness about most
machine-made objects. This comes partly
through bad designing, but partly, also, from
the inability of a machine to perform its func-
tion with the freedom and the brilliant dex-
terity of a human hand controlled by a mind
filled with enthusiasm and kindled by artistic
inspiration. It is no use to say that the machine
might do as well; the fact is that it doesn't, as
a rule; the results prove it. Then, as regards
individuality, hosts of people resent the idea
of their treasures being possessed in uncounted
replicas by others. They want an "original,"
a rarity.

But the final consideration cuts still deeper
into human nature. We have all of us a
feeling that an art-product expresses the artist
-his ideas, his taste, his skill, his patience, his
loving and devoted industry. We admire him

because of what he has made, we admire what
he has made because of himself. The lifeless
object brings us into a real acquaintance with
the living man. His hands fashioned it, his
heart conceived it, his joy and ardor watched
its growth, his pride and contentment saw it
completed. With machine-made things we
lose all that. Men made them, in a sense, but
no one man made the whole of any one of them.
Smith applied machine number one, Fogarty
machine number two, Jones machine number
three, Hogan machine number four, and so on
and on till the finished thing emerged. A
whole crowd of workmen had their turn at it,
each incapable of more than a fraction of its
making, each working without cheerfulness,
each ready to cut and run at the sound of the
factory whistle. If machine-made things sug-
gest anything human, they suggest ignorance,
boredom, and a profound distaste for exertion.
This necklace, for instancc-twentrtwo unwill-
ing workmen have wished it was in Ballyhack!

And so I predict without misgivings that,
as long as people care for beauty, for rarity,
and for the concrete testimony of artistic zeal
in the artisan, they will continue to spend
money freely in the little shop I have told
you of.

THE MONGOLIAN AS A WORKINGMAN

A PACIFIC COAST EXPERIENCE WITH THE ORIENTAL PROBLEM

BY

DR. WOODS HUTCHINSON

AVING lived along the Pacific Coast
from Vancouver Island to Los Ange-
lcs for nearly seven yea rs, I have had time enough
to observe the situation without remaining in
any one place long enough to absorb local
prejudices. Being neither a day-laborer nor an
employer of labor, my point of view has not
been obscured by personal interest.

First of all, no class on the Pacific Coast
desires an unlimited, or even a very large,
immigration of Mongolians, whether coolies or
merchants, Chinese, Japanese, or Koreans.
The people want toleep this Coast a white
man's country. Many of us are keenly alive
to the complications arising from the perma-
nentpresence of an inferiorrace with which it is

not suitable to intermarry. Yet in these seven
years I have found the consensus of intelligent
opinion in the community-farmers, merchants,
professional men, lumbermen, housewives, in
fact all grades and conditions of people except
the labor unions, the "hoodlums," and the
politicians and editors who truckle to such
classes-strongly in favor of a limited Mon-
golian immigration.

They believe that the Chinese and the Jap-s

anese-up to, say, a quarter or half a million--
would be of enormous commercial value to the
Coast and of little or no social or moral dis-
advantage. They do not say much about it in
public, for intelligent opinion goes about in fear
of the noisier and more prejudiced expressions
