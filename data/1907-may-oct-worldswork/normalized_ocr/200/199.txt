present positions. The Proximity has done
more work among its employees than most of
the other mills, but almost all of the mill men
believe with the Proximity owners that the
better educated the employees are, and the
better they live, the more profitable workers
they will become. The pressure of economic
conditions is lifting the mill operatives to a
higher plane of living and the employers are
aiding that advance because they realize that
it is for their advantage. On the farms from
which these people came, there was little social

handle the freight that originates along their
lines. The main reason for all this growth
still exists. More mills are being built
every day. There is more local capital than
there used to be and outside capital is easier
to get. The mills are meeting the scarcity of
labor by training their help to be more efficient.
Improved machinery is making it possible for
fewer hands to do more work. A man who
can operate six ordinary looms can run twelve
or fdteen automatic ones and do more weaving
with each loom. A drawing-in machine lately
invented obviates some of the most trying
labor that girls do in the mills. With the help
