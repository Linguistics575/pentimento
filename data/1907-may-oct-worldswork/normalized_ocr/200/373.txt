THE CONQUEST OF THE TROPICS'

A LONG STEP IN EDUCATIONAL WORK

EW things are as conservative us educa-
tional institutions and methods. To
make a serious change in them is a prodigious
task. It is like changing the course of a river'
you must both dam and dig. The very shape
of the world is against you, and the habit of
ages. So much the more noteworthy, there-
fore, are the radical changes that President
Woodrow Wilson is making in the life of
Princeton. This change has never been better
told than in a recent report made by a com-
mittee of he Board of Trustees:

"We have witnessed in the last few years the creation
of a new Princeton.. Princeton, so far as her under,
graduates were concerned, had come to be merely a delight-
ful place of residence, where young men, for the most part
happily occupied with other things, were made to perform
certain academic tasks.. For a great majority of
them residence here meant a happy life of comradeship
and sport interrupted by the grind of perfunctory'lessons'
and examinations, to which they attended rather because
of the fear of being cut from off me We than because they
were seriously engaged in getting the training which would
lit theirfaculties and theirspirits forthe tasks of the world."
That is a familiar picture. Then follows an
explanation of the change that the tutorial
system has wrought in two years:

"By it, we meant to say that the intellectual life of a
college did not consist of attendance upon class exercises
or of preparation for tecitations, but consisted rather of
constant contact with study and the intimate association
of teacher and pupil outside the classroom, where the tier
dition of lectures and recitation: was forgotten, or rejected,
and a thoroughly natural and human relationship, the
relationship of fellow students, substituted. And that
meaning has at once been made evident to the whole
country. The contrast to the tnlu order of things is most
marked in the case of the intercourse oi undergraduates
with those preceptors who invite them often to their houses
or who live in the same dormitories with them. A natural
and easy social relationship, an informal, frequent exchange
of calls, the easy, unconstrained talks of ordinary comrade,
ship, make study itself seem a thing natural and human."

This system seems to warrant the judgment
that has been passed on it-that it is the most
important change that has been made in college
work or method within recent times. To the
lay mind it so commends itself.

THE CONQUEST OF THE TROPICS

OLONEL WILLIAM C. GORGAS, of
the United States Army, is a physician

and sanitary engir.: cr of high standing. It
was he who practsauy exterminated yellow
fever in Havana and has more recently made

9171

the Panama Canal Zone a healthful place to
live and to work in. Any conclusion, therefore,
reached by Colonel Gorgas about health and
work in the tropics is entitled to very serious
consideration. No wonder then that his recent
address at Cornell University has attracted
world-wide attention. In the course of it, he
said:

"

Ithink that sn nitation can now show that any population
coming into the tropics can protect itself against disease
by measures that are both simple and inexpensive; that
life in the tropics for thc Anglo-Saxon will be more healthful
than in the temperate zones; and that gradually within the
next two or three centuries tropical countries, which offer
a much greater return for man's labor than the temperate
zones, will he settled by the white races, and that again
the centres of wealth, e zation and population will be
in the tropics, as they were in the dawn of man's history,
rather than in the temperate zones as at present."



If this turn out to be true, no more important
fact has been discovered for many a year, for
it means that a richer economic development
awaits us than men have hitherto seriously
thought of. If by sanitation, the black and
brown races of the tropics can themselves
be made economically elficicnt, they will reach
a commanding rank in civilization. Or, if
they remain relatively inefficient and the white
race can live and work in the tropics and
retain much of its energy, by economic pressure
and by the pressure of population it will in
time absorb or displace the brown and black
races. In either case an economic conquest of
the tropics will be made. In the early stages
of tropical conquest by the white race-if this
be the way it is to come-they will economi-
cally subjugate the others by becoming their
leaders.

Whatever be the effect on the races, the
sanitary cleaning up of the tropics, if Colonel
Gorgas's prediction be true, will in time bring
a new economic era in the world. If these
rich regions can be made integral parts of the
organized productive world, the sustaining
of life in healthful comfort will require a
minimum of labor; and it ought to come about
that a large part of energetic mankind-men
that are capable of higher work-will have
the unenervating leisure that has been the
dream of the builders of Utopias.

This is not yet a scientific demonstration,
but it is a fascinating prediction by a scientific
man worthy of attention, and it is fine stuff to
makedreamsoi.

But this much we are demonstrating year
