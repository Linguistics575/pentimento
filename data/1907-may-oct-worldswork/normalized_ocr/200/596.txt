EXAMPLES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS

HE constant additions to educational
equipment and opportunities in the
United States make our time very different
from any period that preceded us; and the youth
of our country are incomparably more fortunate
than any of their forerunners. For examples,
there came to this office on the same day an
official explanation of the eleven new district
agricultural schools in Georgia and the report
of the committee of the Massachusetts Indus-
trial Commission that had investigated trade-
schools in Europe. These are but fair samples
of the extension and the construction of good
' educational machinery and opportunity. Other
states are doing similar or equally important
things..

The eleven district agricultural high schools
in Georgia begin their work this fall. The
communities in which they are situated have
given to them land and money to the value of
more than $ 850, cco. They are really a part
of the public schools system, being technically
under the direction of the state university.
Boys will be taught farming and farm-
management, and girls the housewiiely sciences.
The theory is that one of these schools shall be
within easy reach of every boy and girl in
Georgia who wishes to be trained for efr1cient
farm life. Just as a well-developed public-
school system everywhere has a high school
which trains pupils either for business or for
college, so these agricultural schools add farm-
ing to the accessible kinds of training and aim
to put it on the same plane of dignity and
thoroughness.

The Massachusetts Commission on Indus.
trial Education, it will be recalled, has recom-
mended the establishment of trade high schools,
as a part of the public school system. These
also will, if they are established, correspond

to the existing high schools in the thoroughness
and dignity of their work.

Agricultural high schools in a rich farming
state and trade high schools in a manufacturing
state go with refreshing directness toward the
most hopeful methods of building up our life
soundly. The riches of Georgia are in the soil.
The riches of Massachusetts are in the shop,
The rounded development of all the people
of each community can be attained in no other
way. There has been a social prejudice against
these obviously right ways of training youth.
The lad on the farm has thought it more respect A
able to go to the town. The lad near the shop
has regarded commercial or professional life
as better than life as a craftsman.

Our old method had in it, in fact, for many
youths a falsehood-a falsehood that by at
the very basis of their lives. We have now, in
consequence, to overthrow a wrong social
standard. The wholesomest thing imaginable
is a liberally endowed effort to change this
false standard. Successful agriculture is a
very profitable and dignified calling. The best
workshops afford careers of profit and dignity.
There is no good reason why Georgia and
Massachusetts should not have as good farms
and as good workshops as there are in the world.
They have just as capable youth to train as the
youth of any nation. If they are as earnest
about it as the Germans, the Belgians, and the
French have been, and as the Irish are becom-
ing, there is no reason why commissions from
these foreign nations should not soon come
here to learn how we have managed to induce
the most capable men to take to farming and
to the trades.

Nor does such an impetus given to purely
practical education result in the lowering, of
high academic aims. It does not turn Educa-
tion into "a mere preparation for earning a
living." It does not rob youth of its birth.
right, and lessen its indulgence in high ideals.
The error in this assumption is that if there
were no trade schools the boy who will now
learn a trade would learn literature or phil-
osophy instead. It is the sort of error that
little coteries of half-educated men, men whose
economic vision is short, sometimes make.
The assumption is that, if you have a few
scholars or especially fortunate or especially
able men of high academic cultivation, society
will be safe and the rest of mankind will get
on somehow very well. It is this deep-rooted
feeling in English social life that has
