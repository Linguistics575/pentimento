WHAT IS A SHOP-GIRLS LIFE? 9313

always been claimed that a shamefully low
wage is paid her, and it is frequently inti-
mated that the young and pretty shop-girl
need not, or is not expected, to live upon
her salary. That this shameful thing has
occurred, the writer has been assured by girls
to whom the alternative has been suggested.
But it does not now occur so frequently as
when the whole race of shop-girls was con-
sidered the natural prey of man. It is difficult
to get at the exact wages paid to shop-girls.
The managers and proprietors consider that
to be strictly their own affair, and intimate that
it is not that of the inquirer.

From the girls themselves it is almost as
difficult to find out anything definite or reliable.
As far as could be learned from very extensive
inquiries, the salaries of these women range
from $ 5 to $ 20 a week, according to the position
occupied and the amount of responsibility
assumed. The average sales-woman, such as
stands behind the counter in the notion depart-
ment, the ribbon department, stationery, neck-
wear, and hosiery departments, receives from
five to eight dollars a week, with seven dollars
as the average. In other departments, where
a greater amount of intelligence and a more
specialized knowledge of the stock is required,
the salary is higher, ranging in different stores
from seven to fifteen dollars a week, with ten
or twelve as the average. The usual wages of
cash-girls and bundle-wrappers is from two
and a half to five dollars a week.

SAFEGUARDS O F CHARACTER

tr Exactly as in a household," said one depart-
ment store manager, "the work goes better,
and the help attend better to their duties and
are more interested in their work when they
are living in healthful physical and moral
conditions. It is to our interest to surround
our young women with all the protection, both
physical and moral, that lies in our power.
And it has been our experience that the greater
proportion of them are earnest, serious-minded
girls, trying to earn their own living in an honest
and respectable manner, and ambitious to rise
in their business."

In one of the oldest stores the women are
not allowed to leave in the evening through
the employccs' entrance, because it leads out on
a dark street where there are usually a lot of
loafers hanging about, but are sent out by the
front door, so that they may come out upon a
street that is well lighted and protected.

In a number of the better stores, detectives
are employed by the year for the sole purpose
of protecting the attractive young girls from
the machinations of "mashers" and young
men about town.

The Mor-walker offers a more difficult
problem. He is usually a man of good appear
anee and pleasant manners. In manyinstances
he is also unprincipled and designing, and
should his advances be repelled by a girl in
his department he has it in his power to ruin
her chances for advancement, even to make
her lose her position.

To put a check on the floor-walker, and to
protect the girls in his department, two dry-
goods houses have made it a rule that any
employee may go straight to the head of the
firm with all her difficulties.

WHAT THE GIRLS DO FOR THEMSELVES

In nearly all the stores there are employees'
associations, benelit associations, and mutual
aid societies. which by the investment of
trifling dues provide for sickness, death, and
burial. To some one of these nearly all the
girls belong, and the meetings of the societies
and the sociability provided by them proves
a pleasure as well as a benefit.

Of late years a saving bank institution
has sent a representative to each of the
large stores on pay day, to receive what money
the girls can spare from their salaries, to save
for them. As banks do not open until long
after the shop-girl has gone to work, and as
they close long before she quits work, it is
practically impossible for her to take the money
to the banks. Their savings, in many-indeed
in most-cases are so small that they would be
almost ashamed to deposit them, but when
the kind little old lady with the big brown bag
and the little account book arrives at the store,
the girls do not hesitate to give into her keeping
even a few pennies. These savings are slow
and precarious, but in time they count up and
sometimes enable a girl to take a little trip,
to take a few music lessons, or to get some
article of clothing that she could not otherwise
afford.

In many of the stores the girls form little
reading circles and clubs. Their meetings
are usually held on Saturday evenings, at the
homes or rooms of the different members;
readings, music, and conversation form the
entertainment, and simple refreshments are
served.
