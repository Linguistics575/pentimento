de memhe. Coal-tar, that chokes us with its
asphaltum stew-pots and smooths the path for
the flying automobile, helps to vulcanize its
tires, to paint its body, to light its lamps, and
to run its engines. Side by side in the same
garden grow roses, potatoes, deadly night-
shade, onions, aconite, and cabbage. A very
slight readjustment of the atoms and molecules
of carbolic acid makes salicylic acid.

ALL FOOD IS CHEMICAL

Almost everything in our food-bins, grana-
ries, and slaughter pens, in all organic mat-
ter, is composed of four chemical elements:
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon; and
carbon, the principal product of coal-tar, is
chief. Chemists give every substance a name
according to the elements and numbers of
atoms of which it is composed. Yet the
formulae of numerous well-known substances
are identical. Take certain atoms of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, and you can make
either starch or cotton, according to the way
in which you put them together.

This point in chemistry is mentioned to
show that we are helplessly dependent upon
chemical skill in eating synthetic products
like the fruit essences and perfumes; and that
it is not for us to assume that a synthetic food
substance is not just as healthful and nutritious
as its analogue made in Nature's out-door
laboratory.

However slight the differences in formula, or
soil site, or appearance, taste, and odor, we
know that one stuff will kill and another nour-
ish; and we must be guided by some sort of
evidence that settles the question. But when
we discard synthetic strawberry essence be-
cause it comes from a coal-tar source, we may
be totally wrong. Certain varieties of bacteria
will destroy us if they get a chance. Yet our
lives depend upon other bacteria-the sources
of fermentation. All vegetation is made pos-
sible only through bacterial fermentation in
the soil. Certain "bouquets" in brewed
liquors and flavors in butter and cheese are
due to the formation of bacterial ferments.
Many of these bacteria are well known, are
cultivated, and used to make these desired
"Nauquets" and flavors. Here in the germ
industry is a duplicate to synthetic chemistry.
Here the breeders must be careful not to let
disease-bearing germs mix with the flavor-
makers, or the cup will savor of death.

WHAT THE FOOD LAW SAVES US FROM

vessel, very little food traveled far from home.
Pemmican, tongue, ham, bacon, and cod, after
a preparatory creosote varnishing in clouds
of hickory smudge smoke, were equal to distant
journeys; and so were brine-cured corned
beef, mackerel, oysters, pigs' knuckles, and
pickles. Few foods were eaten out of season,
fresh meats were of recent slaughter, vegetables
not far from the garden. But every com-
mercial influence, from railroading to canning,
has increased the temptation or demand for
preservatives, cheaper substitutes, or complete
substitution. Competition has made extra
effort in making foods attractive in appearance,
odor, and taste.

We are in a very crude state of food art-
the chromo stage. If a fruit or vegetable
shows a leaning towards any primary color,
it is shoved into its most dazzling grade. But-
ter must be Etruscan gold, not washed-out
brass. No Nile-green peas shall disgrace our
board; let them be green like the emerald!
The can-freed tomato and the ketchup must
be Roman-red. Paint-wrap the candy with
the flag of freedom for Independence Day
consumption, and with the shamrock on St.
Patrick's Day.

BENZOIC ACID EVERYWHERE

The drug preservatives in common use are
benzoic acid, borax, boracic acid, salicylic
acid, formaldehyde, creosote, salt, saltpetre,
sulphite of soda, and a number of proprietary
secret mixtures. The object of using pre-
servatives is to prevent decomposition or
bacterial fermentation. The aim is to use
enough to stay decomposition and yet not
injure health. The producers, the judges, and
the public are very much at sea as to what
preservatives best meet these requirements.
Much testimony was offered the Congressional

'food-bill committee regarding benzoic acid.

The medical dose is from IO to 60 grains.
Benzoie acid used as a food preservative re-
quires from i to I grain in such amount of an
article as would be eaten at one time, or I part
in 1,200 to 2,000. In an ordinary "helping"
of canned tomatoes preserved with benzoic
acid, one would eat about' to I grain of the
drug. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in cran-
berries, huckleberries, plums, grapes, grape
fruit, oranges, pineapples, carrots, parsnips,
cauliflower, rhubarb, and green peppers. In
fresh cranberries there is b of I per cent. of
benzoic acid; in stewed cranberries I, of I per
