his prosperity is largely attributable the great
increase in the number of small banks. In
Scotland County, reversingimmemorinl custom,
farmers now lend money to the merchants. 1f
the prices in the fall do not suit the cotton
growers, they simply hold $ 10,000,000 worth
for better prices the following summer. A
conservative estimate would probably put the
increase in land values during the last ten
years at 250 per cent. The cases of two

number of pieces of mail handled per month
had grown from 952 to 5,032; on Route No.

from 1,553 to 3',53r-" ct total increase of from
3,878 to 12,233, or more than 200 per cent.
Another illustration is found in the fact that in
five years the circulation of the Methodist
paper published in the building in which 1
write has increased from 4,000 to 8,000; that
of the Baptist paper from 5,000 to 11,000; and
that of the farm paper from 5,000 to 24,000.

For the first time, too, the school is beginning

sold a tract for $ 2,000 which then cost him
$ 750. In the first instance, the profits were
unusually large, but the second case is typical.

Of the other factors that have helped in the
remaking of country life in Carolina, better
schools, better roads, rural mail delivery, and
the rural telephone must not be ignored.
Mecklenburg's good roads are famous, Dun
ham's will become equally so, and the $ 3oo, ooo
Guilford is now expending will leave its roads
not inferior to Durham's.

As for the increase in quantity of mail matter
handled, I recently obtained the statistics for
three Raleigh rural delivery routes which had

soil. Agriculture and Nature study now have
a place in the curriculum. Under the old
system, the farmer boy learned about the won-
ders of Asia and Switzerland, but nothing
about the wonders of plant and animal life;
he was taught the metric system of weights and
measures, but not how to calculate a feeding
ration; foreign exchange had a place in the
school books but there was not a word about
the elements of soil fertility. Being taught
a hundred ways of applying, education in
the store, but nothing of agriculture, small
wonder that hundreds of boys who might
have been farm successes became town
failures, and hundreds of others, quitting
