they have packing houses, tanneries, canneries,
and distilleries. The money for these industries
is coming in at the rate of $ 200,000,000 a year.

The traveller may think all this no more than
the boom in our own country spilling over the
border. Yet, by the last analysis, it is found
to be due to Mexico itself; above all, to
its statesmunship. There rages, for instance,

dams, the sea walls, the wheels turned by water
a hundred miles distant, the electric hoists in
shafts abandoned for centuries, the fields
that were mesquite flats only a year ago.

Do not, however, mistake this for inflation.
There is, of course, a crest to the wave and bad
times will whip off the foam, but the volume

taxable property. During six months, more
than 1,000,000 acres of government lands were
transferred to private ownership.

Another sign of enduring prosperity is the
building of public works. There is the new
federal postoflice at the capital, the first com-
pleted of a superb group of government build-
ings, as well as the first modern one. Here,
the American postal system is being inaugu-
