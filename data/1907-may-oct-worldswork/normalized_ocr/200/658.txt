of this week's most popular visitor or most
successful hostess or most charming debutante.
But we are democratic in our towniwe have
to be, or be lonesome-and the weddings of
our ultm-fashionablcs go into the same august
column with the wedding of the blacksmith's
daughter and the butcher's son. It would be
indiscreet of the banker's wife to protest, for the
banker of to-day was a blacksmith hitecn years
ago, and everybody knows it. But the society
reporters give the banker's wife her revenge,
for when a fashionable crowd spends Sunday
with a hostess it goes into the paper as a tt week-
end party," while the same affair in humbler
circles appears as plain "stayed over Sunday."

Seclusion, also, is a retreat for pride of caste.
We used to build a house wherever we could
get a lot we liked, but lately our Brahmins are
flocking together in exclusive residence dis-
tricts. Only the elect are encouraged to enter
these districts and they are expected to maintain
a certain standard of appearances. Of course,
this is an old story in Eastern towns, but it is a
new thing for us. We are separating along
worldly lines, and the old comradeship of
"classes" is less and less evident.

Our religious ideas have passed through
some transitions. We used to be mainly
"shouting" Methodists, and we "got" religion
at revivals and camp-meetings. These gather-
ings were tense with emotional excitement.
Children, at these meetings, their feelings
wrought upon by pulpit "threats of hell and
hopes of paradise," by crying women and
groaning men, went forward to the "mourners'
bench" and underwent an agony of mental
torture in an effort to become "converted"--
from what they did not know, nor to what,
nor least of all, why. Sometimes they got
religion and kept it; sometimes they got it
and lost it the week after; sometimes
they did not get it at all. Whatever they got
was purely an emotional experience, pure
unreason, often a bitter haunting experience,
that led sometimes to insanity.

To-day we are not so fond of revivals. We
follow a little more closely St. Paul's adjuration
that we know some "reason for the faith that
is in us," before we accept the faith. Not that
we are any less religious than we used to be,
but we have more religions to choose from-so
wide a range as all the Protestant denominations,
Catholicism, Christian Science, Unitarianism,
theosophy, and Buddhism. Naturally, with
so many paths to salvation, we are more deliber-

ate in our choice, we must perforce stop and
weigh their arguments and balance our faith
against our reason. As a result, our religion
is becoming less powerful as the guardian of
certain traditions of personal conduct, and more
powerful as a practical force for everyday
efficient morality and neighborliness, which
latter is, after all, the substance of most
religion. And we have fewer people with a
conception of religion like that of one young
enthusiast in our town who declined a chance
to go to college because he had "decided to
serve the Lord instead."

Other agencies-semi-religious-help in this
better moyement. The Young Men's Christian
Association has been revived under the friendly
cooperation of our business men, and its hand-
some building, with gymnasium, and bathing
pool, and reading room, is the lively centre of
a seven-days-in-the-week religion that includes
a morality of the body and of the mind and of
social amiability as well as the more formal
religion of dogmas about the soul, and hymns,
and sermons, and rituals. We are realizing
in religion what doctors are realizing in medi,
cine, that the cure of the soul's diseases, like
the cure of the body's diseases, is a more ardu-
ous task than the prevention of disease. When.
young fellows are kept off the streets and their
minds off of devilment by wholesome exercise
that develops muscle and character and the
spirit of teamwork that is at the bottom of
social order and respect for law, there is less of
the devil's fire to be fought by the churches.

Our society for the prevention of various
things-cruelty to children, cruelty to animals,
and the like-as most societies for the perform-
ance of thankless jobs, has only one really
active member, and he the butt of countless
jokes. But with a zealot's enthusiasm he
pursues his work with ardor unquenchable,
and after all we are grateful to him, when we.
stop to put ourselves in the place of the helpless
whom he serves. His work is a good one, and
it cases our consciences to know that somebody
else is doing it, and we are glad he enjoys his
unpleasant task.

We are getting to be-no, we are-great
readers. We had our free public library long
before Mr. Carnegie gave us a better, permanent
home for it, and we have used it with increasing
pleasure. Most of us are not very profound
in our choice of books: the librarians complain
that they are forever asked for "something
new" to read-the newest fiction, But we
