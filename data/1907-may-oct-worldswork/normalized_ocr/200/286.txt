from the army and began the great work of his
life in Egypt, though his continuous service
dates from 1884.

"When I came to Egypt," he once said to
a friend, "I made up my mind that the work
was big enough for the life of one man, and that
I would devote my life to it and not ask pro-
motion or take promotion until I had made
it a complete success." And even the proffer
of a Cabinet position did not change his
purpose.

One of the great factors in his success has
been his thorough honesty. In the reorgan-
ization of the country's finance, in the dis-
tribution of office, in the expenditure of public
money, and in many other ways, he undou btedly
had opportunities a-plenty for enriching him-
self-which Egypt expected him to do. But
at the close of a quarter-century, he left Egypt
with his integrity unimpeached. "The idea
that Lord Cromer would allow any suspicious
deal whatever," remarked a native connected
with the financial board, "is so absolutely
impossible that one does not stop even to con-
sider it." This is a remarkable statement,
especially since it is repeated by a Frenchman,
whose sympathies would naturally lead him
to be skeptical. It seems to be a fact that
whenever the interests of Egypt clashed with
those of England, Cromer always decided in
favor of Egypt-and the home Government
allowed him to do so. His administrative
policy was admirably stated by Lord Milner
some years ago: "The application of a reason-
able amount of common sense and common
honesty to a country ruined by the absence of
both."

THE PERSONALITY OF LORD CROMER

When it is remembered that Lord Cromer
has had constant diplomatic relations with
three widely differing nationalities-the native,
the Frenchman, and his own countrymen-it
is perhaps not to be wondered at that he should
have suffered adverse criticism at times. Men
occasionally went to his office expecting to
meet a diplomat, with bland, 11nctuous, Oriental
manners; they found an Anglo-Saxon, plain
and blunt. Matter-of-fact, he undoubtedly is
--but he has carried burdens enough to drive
affability from the most genial temperament.
Hard to get along with, some have said; but
the records of the long service of his English
associates argue against this.

"He is not a man after the heart of an inter-

viewer," remarks a writer with a wide
experience. "If he allows one question,

it is useless to ask two. From the first he
grasps exactly what you desire to learn, and if
he vouchsafes a reply it is given clearly and
without superfluous words." But the writer
adds that his voice is soft, his manner simple,
and his personality charming. One of his
own countrymen who has known him intimately
for thirty years declares that he is one of the
gentlest and most kind-hearted of men.

To the end of his long service in the midst
of Oriental peoples, Cromer remained an
Englishman. Others of his countrymen have
become Orientalized, but not Cromer. You
will look long before you find a photograph of
him in Turkish garb, with decorations scattered
all over his breast. And yet the initials of
the distinctions that have come to him would
extend more than across a page.

His retirement from his high office was purely
voluntary, in spite of the fact that it was based
on the familiar ground of "ill-health." He
made it very clear in his letter of resignation
that no political considerations whatever entered
into the case.

"After spending forty-nine years in the
Government's service," he said, "I am thor-
oughly worn out, and really unable to support
any longer the excessive strain which my work
here cntails."

THE FUTURE OF EGYPT

Egypt without Cromer does not mean Egypt
without England. The British "occupation"
not only continues, but continues along the
line of the same policies that have brought
the land to its present high estate. This was
clearly stated by the Foreign Secretary after
reading Lord Cromer's resignation to the House
of Lords, and was shown with equal cleamess
by the appointment of Sir Eldon Gorst to
succeed him. Sir Eldon, who has been in the
diplomatic and colonial service since the age
of twcnty-four (he is now forty-seven), has
spent most of his public life in Egypt. As
financial adviser to Lord Cromer, he has
helped to formulate his policies almost from
the beginning and is in hearty accord with the
plans now in process of execution. It is his
task, first, to build the superstructure upon the
Cromer foundation-just as the engineers are
preparing to add twenty feet to the height of
the great dam at Assouan. A more diffrcult
task awaits him in the future, the guiding of
