to do these things? The accompanying map
shows, roughly, the locations of water-power
plants (planned and constructed) of one com-
pany, and the transmission lines by which this
electric power is distributed. This one com-
pany covers a territory larger than many a
state. It will sell power just as willingly to
farmers as to mills and factories. A community
would use as much power as a mill and any
electrical engineer could arrange the distri-
bution. Besides, there are many small private

The company referred to charges $ 20 a horse-
power a year. The rate at Niagara is about
the same. The city of Chicago will pay $ 15
a year for power generated by the drainage
canal. The rate of $ 20 a horse-power is the
same as bro of a cent per kilowatt hour.
Even if this rate were doubled (because of the
the small quantity consumed), it would be as
cheap as coal, wood, or gas. In addition to
cleanliness, comfort, and safety, the use of
electricity would in most places be an economy.

THE TERRITORY SUPPLIED WITH ELECTRICITY BY A SINGLE COMPANY

The power stations and transmission lines (completed and projected) of a plant which will distribute electric power
over a region larger than the state of Connecticut

power plants in this territory. Mills are so
equipped and almost every town has its hydro-
electric plant for its lighting and street-car
system. Communities of farmers may either
buy from a power company, or instal a plant
of their own. Many farms have enough water-
power in streams or artesian wells for their
own needs..

The region shown on the map has no greater
water-powcr than many other parts of the
United States. There are few farming regions
in this country that are beyond the reach of
electricity generated by running water. Even
in the arid and semi-arid regions, the same
water that is used for irrigation could often be
made to generate power.
