per cent. of the total area of the United States.
It is a rather startling fact to face that this very
considerable proportion of the country's area
has an aggregate population no larger than
the ordinary course of immigration has brought
to us in a single twelvcmonth.

One may or may not take alarm at the mere
matter of numbers. The adding of a round
million of foreign-born to our population
every year is not necessarily ruinous to the
essential interests of the nrrtion-cven to the
ultimate survival of the American as a type of
cultivated human being. The country and
its resources are enormous. Its population
is relatively small. There is still an abundance
of room-for the right sort of people. The
discouraging fact which cannot be evaded,
however, is that along with the increase in
volume of immigration has gone a hardly less
pronounced falling off in quality. There is no
need to argue the question whether one race
of people is inherently better or more capable
than another. Probably in the long run the
conclusion would be that, the habit of a thou-
sand generations of one's ancestors being hard

to overcome, we still allow mere differences
of race to shape our judgments far more than
is really justiliable. But, as practical affairs
go, everybody understands that some peoples
are more industrious than others; that some
are more ambitious than others; that some
assimilate with their neighbors and perpetuate
the better qualities of both, while others herd
together and accentuate their own deficiencies.
In other words, men springing from certain
stocks are eminently more desirable as immi-
grants than are their cousins in whose veins
flows a different blood.

THE CLASS OF IMMIGRANTS CHANGING

It is a commonplace that since about 1885
there has been a profound change in the pre-
dominant elements of our immigrant popula-
tion. The cardinal fact is the shifting of the
preponderance from the Celtic and Teutonic
peoples of the north and west of Europe to
the Iberian and Slavic stocks of the south and
east. If one will cast up the percentages
representing the relative proportion of immi-
grants from the leading European countries
