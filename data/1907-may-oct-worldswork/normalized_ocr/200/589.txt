THE FOUNDATIONS OF PROSPERITY 9387

methods which the corporate world has devel.
oped and accepted. In the last analysis, there-
fore, the whole subject of the danger to pros-
perity comes back to the character of corporate
conduct and of banking conduct. Such a code
of corporation morals as the life-insurance
investigation disclosed and as the railroad rate-
law and similar laws are meant to correct-so
long as it is tolcrated-will enable men to use
other men's money in such a way as to slackcn
industry when there is no good economic rea-
son for a slackening of it.

A Question 4 Moral: at Last

Now we come to the very gist of the present
situation. We have had a code of morals in
corporation conduct and in high finance that
was not honest. So long as we endured that,
the prosperity of the country could not be safe.
This fact the public has at last perceived; and
the public, through various agencies, is now
trying to correct this evil-to make great cor-
porations responsible for their conduct, to bring
a new and higher standard of corporation
morals, to prevent men who control great
companies from taking unfair advantage of
the rest of the community and from having a
disproportionate, or corrupt, proportion of
power in government and over the liquid
capital of the community.

The public sentiment of the United States
is seriously engaged in bringing this change
about. It demands the same fairness and
honesty in business done on a large scale as in
business done on a small scale. It demands
the same responsibility in the conduct of
insurance companies and of business in Wall
Street as it demands in the ordinary trans <
actions between individuals; and it is trying
to find a way to make this righteous determina-
tion effective. It is trying to find a way to
punish corporate cvirdoers as it has found ways
of punishing individual criminals.

And the purpose and the aim of the people-
of this public sentiment-is right. It is
righteous. It will prevail. The wrong-docrs
and the quibblers may as well recognize this
inevitable quality of the public mind. We are
going to have in this Republic a standard of
financial and corporate morals that will square
with the moral sense of the American people
in their frivate conduct; and we are going to
have it at any cost. It may come at a tcrrMc
financial and industrial cost. It may come
only through mistaken and even unfair methods,

for an aroused and outraged public opinion is
not always discriminating. It sometimes takes
the most costly and even reckless ways to carry
out its purpose. But it is an invincible thing.

Not a Sudden Public Mood

This is not a new nor sudden public mood.
It has been showing itself more and more
plainly for a number of years. It is a mere cry
of ignorance to declaim against Mr. Roosevelt;
for he and his policies are only one of its expres-
sions. The so-called Granger railroad legisla-
tion of years ago was one expression of it. The
creation of the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission, long ineffective except as a bureau
of information, was another expression of it.
The national anti-trust law was another. The
anti-tmst legislation in many states is another
expression-much of it an ignorant and unwise
expression. The life-insurance investigation
in New York; the growing sentiment in favor of
experiments in municipal ownership; in fact,
the strongest tendency in current legislation
and the most popular party doctrine are
efforts to bring about the same responsibility
in the management of corporations as in the
management of individual business. And, be-
fore this public mood passes, attention may be
given to great banking corporations as well
as to insurance companies, railroad companies,
and the like; and it is likely also to demand a
reduction of the tariff.

It is easy to declaim against some of the
forms that this agitation takes; for example,
some of the absurd and unjust state laws
against railroads. But these are only the small
mistakes of a great and earnest movement;
and against the movement itself it will do no
good to cry out, Rich men and great cor-
porations may have reason to fear. The
money-kings may withdraw capital from the
easy currents of productive investment. We
may have an artificially high rate of interest.
The stock market may tumble to still lower
prices. Corporations that have been doing
business on easily borrowed capital may fail.
All these events, if they come, are incidents-
perhaps necessary incidents-of an important
change from one code of morals to another.
If values shrink, what of it? We may as well
come to the honest management of corporations
at once and be done with it. There are worse
things than loss of values in stocks; and one
worse thing is the creation of artificial values
and the maintenance of them by the improper
