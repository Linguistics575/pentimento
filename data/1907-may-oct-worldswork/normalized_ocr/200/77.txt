THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD 8875

fish-eating animals-mink and ottcr--whose
range is practically everywhere in North
America, and over the northern half of both
Europe and Asia. A few years ago, fashion
would have naught to do with mink, and the
fur went begging at a few pennies a pelt.
Recently fashion has approved it and prices
have jumped to SI and $ 4 and $ 5 and $ 7 for
the different grades, with the result that half a
million mink are exported from Canada: nnd the
United States to European markets. Otter
has always been a favorite skin for trimming
men's coats, the Canadian otter especially,
owing to the thickness and dark color of
the fur. While it is distributed widely over
three continents, it seems never to have been
abundant enough for more than 30,000 to
come to the market in one year; 10,000 is
nearer the average of otter sold in London and
Lcipsic and Nijni. Chinese and Indian and
African otter grade very low. So do otter from
the salt-water states of the South; but the

sent from the Northwestern states to the Lon-
don market; or badger, which one never sees
in its fluffy prime state except in the cold dry
climate of the Northwest; or wolverine, whose
deviltries are the nightmare of every trapper's
life; or the whole cttt family, from leopard and
cougar and lynx and bob-cat to the domestic
feline of the black cat farms in Holland,
operated to supply the trade; or opossum, of
which half a million yearly go from the United
States to Europe, and three million from Aus,
tmlia; or wolf, of which the finest specimens
come from Siberia; or bear, gathered in the
tens of thousand on oath market.

And we have not y t touched 0n the three
furs that are sold in the millions, -muskrat,
squirrel, rabbit. Consideration of tllly (me of
these is like specifying the sands of the sea.
