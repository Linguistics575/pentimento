9370 AMATEUR HAND-CRAFTS THAT PAY

Meanwhile, as the people in that little shop
will tell you, the revived handicrafts have be
come a remunerative resource for amateurs.
By amateurs I do not mean bunglers; I mean
those who support themselves by other sorts
of work and adopt handicrafts as a recrea-
tion, develop a high degree of skill, and pro-
duce things every whit as good as do those who
call themselves professionals. They make
their fun pay for itself, and more. It occupies
only their leisure, but it serves as an additional
channel of income. Suppose, for instance,
that a farm lad, instead of "loafu1g" about the
village store of an evening, should train himself
to stamp and tint leather or to hammer brass or
copper; suppose that a village girl, instead of
busying her fmgers with beautiless "fancy
work", should study dcsigning-irent
teachers can be found in the nearest large city
-and devote herself to really artistic needle,
work that would express all her originality
and enthusiasm and love of harmonious line
and color; both would secure a worthy pastime,
and both would meanwhile be making money.
Elbert Hubbard's "Roycrofters" are recruited
almost entirely from a country community,
and although the Roycroft wares invite criticism
in certain respects, the fault lies with the con-
trolling spirit rather than with the workers.
If they can reach the Roycroft standard, they
prove themselves capable of reaching a higher
standard under abler direction. Moreover,
hundreds of business and professional people
are learning that while the day's toil fags brain
and nerves, the evening passed in using the
hands at pleasing labor soothes the wearied
body and calms the distracted mind. The
effect of such labor is refreshing. It occupies
the attention just suff1cicntly to shut out worry
and no one finds it fatiguing. The tired
lawyer or the exasperated editor can make
book-bindings or carve ivory while his wife
is reading aloud to him.

I warrant the result less upon the voucher
of my own experience-which accounts for
something, though-than upon the testimony
of many physicians, some of whom have pre-
scribed handicrafts as a sort of medicine in the
treatment of nervous ailments. Certain sana-
toriums have shops in which patients are
put to work-with the most cheerful effect.
Naturally, the particular kind of work allotted
must suit the especial needs and aptitude of the
Individual; for instance, a doctor would hardly
set a neurasthenic at over-delicate work;

basketry would do better, in every respect, and
so, probably, would the tinting of tiles. In
such an institution, a New York business man,
terribly broken down when he arrived, learned
to make baskets. Not only did that aid in
restoring him to health, but at the same time
his new occupation so captivated him that
instead of returning to the city he withdrew
to a charming country village, and is now
following basketry as a profession, He is
probably the most artistic basket-maker in the
United States.

His story might well be that of many a city
dweller driven to extremities by nervous strain.
In every trolley-car, every "cl" train, you see
men who ought to quit the city forever. Quit it
they would, had they the courage and had they
hope of making a living elsewhere. For some
of them, at least, the revived handicrafts point
a way of escape. Once you have mastered a
trade, you can live where you will. You can
take your tools and your talent to the moun-
tains, to the deep woods, even to a pine-clad
island somewhere off the coast of Maine. And
if men can make their hands set them free of
the city and its horrors of din and hurry, they
can make them set them free of irksome em-
ployments. I know of a business man Whow
hearing that last year a neighbor of his had
sold $ 6,000 worth of the work of his hands-
threw up a profitable but infuriating job,
learned an enjoyable handicraft, and now bids
fair to be as prosperous as before, while in-
finitely more contented.

Taken all in all'hese are matters to set one
thinking. Might not you. too, gain a new
kind of pleasure, a new sun. of rest, a new
source of income, and possibly even a new
independence by simply discovering that those
things on the ends of your arms are hands,
and that hands can acquire handicrafts?
What if you are not clever at basketry or
leather work: there is a long list of other arts
to choose from. At a recent exhibition held by
the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts, the pro-
ducts displayed made a catalogue of more
than a hundred pages, covering this signili-
cantly wide range of departments: basketry,
book-binding, ecclesiastical work, glassware,
jewelry, leather work, metal work, photography,
pottery, printing, engraving, stained-glass,
textiles, embroidery, and woodworking-to
say nothing of a, very interesting department of
"miscellaneous objects."

"Well," I seem to hear you reply. "all this
