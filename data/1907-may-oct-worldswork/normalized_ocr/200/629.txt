THE HUMANITARIA N

through holes in her shoes; her old black straw
hat was a ruin. Yet her hair was combed
decently; her face, thin and pathetically lined
by suffering and fear, was not blowzy nor
defiant like other faces in the prisoners' dock;
she still bore herself with matronly self-respect.
Misery of her forty years spoke in all her looks,
but not crime nor gin. Watching there, I
wondered what desperate assault upon society
had brought her to that cruel pass.

Swift tum the wheels in a London police
court. A policeman said a few words and an
officious looking man with no pity in his face
and no kindness in his voice explained the case.
He was the School Board Officer. He said
that the prisoner at the bar was a widow with
nine children; that she lived in a basement
tenement of one room; that her two elder chil-
dren had been absent from school. How
often? Of a possible total of 68 attendances,
each had made but 54. The woman had been
warned repeatedly; she had persisted in viola-
ting the law; and it had become necessary to
arrest her.

The justice, dignified but not unkind, asked
the woman if the officer's statement was
correct. She said, in her frightened way, that
it was. Only, she added, she was desperately
poor and the children had been absent from
school while they tried to get something to eat.
The justice said that he had no option in the
matter, and fined her nine shillings.

She groaned aloud and said she could not
pay; she had not a shilling in the world. The
School Board Officer broke in again and
informed His Worship that it would be quite
useless to issue an execution against the
woman's property. He had visited the one
room in which the family lived and all its con-
tents together were not worth nine shillings.
The justice reflected a moment and said that
he would give her a week in which to find nine
shillings; in default thereof, it would be his
duty to send her to jail. So the woman went
away crying and the wheels ground up the
next human fragment.

What were the nine children to do, mean-
time, if she should be sent to jail? I do not
know. Nobody knows. Perhaps it is not
important. The main thing seemed to be to
vindicate the law and to punish the offender.

THE GENTLER METHOD OF PARIS

and lead them happily to school, and knew
that whatever else might happen they would
be neither hungry nor cold nor untaught.

Here, then, are two ways of dealing with the
problem of educating the children of the poor;
the Club and the Open Hand.

While London clings yet to the Club, the
Municipal Council of Paris has elected to try
the Open Hand. One day it quietly decided
that it would not try with force and fear to
drive children to school nor to punish parents
whose poverty compelled them to keep their
children at home. Instead, it would try first
to remove. the causes of absence from school.

The 2,714,000 people of Paris are governed.
when the national legislature can be induced to
keep its hands off, by this Municipal Council
of eighty members, four being elected from
each of the twenty wards of the city. There
is no mayor of all Paris, but each ward has its
own mayor, an arrangement that seems to
work with much smoothness.

This regulation about school children fell
within the Municipal Council's campaign.
One day the fact was revealed in the Council
that some children of the poor were kept out
of school because they did not have proper
clothing to wear, and some others because they
had no certainty of the day's food unless they
went out and earned it. At once the Council.
sent about the city searching for all such cases,
even in streets and corners most obscme, that
all might be verified and tabulated. Then
at public expense, from the city's funds, it
supplied all such children with shoes and
clothing and food. Daily it continues so to
supply them, believing that thereby it is follow-
ing the shrewdest of all business policies; in
the Council's view, it is infinitely cheaper to
prevent crime than to punish it, and cheaper
to abolish misery than to "neglect it. It not
only furnishes to the, children, when it has led
them into school, all things free that they need
there--Nxoks and slates and stationery and
instruments-but furnishes free to all children
that need it a daily luncheon, a real luncheon
of soup, meat, and vegetables, cooked in the
kitchens of the schoolhouse; and served hot.
Children of the well-to-do pay for their lunch-
eons; children of the poor pay nothing. An
ingeniously devised system of checks prevents
the curious from discovering who pays and who
does not, and spares the feelings of the poor.
