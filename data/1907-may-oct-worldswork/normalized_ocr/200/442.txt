and for work that had been done before he had
touched a finger to the enterprise; more than
that, to collect his 4 per cent. on what was
not done or not delivered at all, a commission
figured on the total amount of the graft.

How was all this possible?

The marvel is that in all this broad scheme
of plunder it has not yet been shown where the
great bosses came in. What the state is now
asking is, who got this money? It is incone
ceivable that it was a present to Payne and
Sanderson and Huston. If it was, then there
was a reason for that-some momentous service
by one or all to the machine, a service of which
the public has no inkling. These men were
not bosses, big or little. They were favored
citizens. Why? The machine is not given
to favoring citizens. It holds all it gets
strictly for its own. How are these men con-
nected with the machine? One of two things
is certain, though neither of them has been
indicated as yet by a single atom of evidence
before the Investigating Commission: either
they were simply the agents to draw the money
from the treasury for some of the big fellows,
or else they have rendered such service that
their profit of millions is only a fair recompense.
The investigation will not be complete until
one or the other of these things is developed.

It is plain that there were two commissions
at work at the same time, or in part at the same
time. One erected the building and the other
furnished it. Both recognized architect Huston
as chief. Huston didn't draw any fine line
between the two; he got his commission on
either job, and out of the same treasury. There
was a beautiful opportunity here to duplicate
work, and testimony shows that the'opportunity
was not overlooked. Again, there was a chance
for one to assume that contracts existed with
the other, and to juggle them back and forth
as occasion prompted.

What graft there was in the construction of
the building has not yet been carefully gone into.
It is known that Payne & Co., the contractors,
substituted putty for carved mahogany mold-
ings, and plaster for tile; and laid 4-inch con-
crete walks instead of walks of standard depth,
and put in cheap glass instead of the costly
partition glass specified. But there is little
that can yet be told in detail as to this. We
know that months before the letting of the
contract for the granite, months before the
completion of the specifications even, Huston,

brother-in-law of Israel Durham, and some
others, were trying to secure a quarry near
Easton from which a peculiarly veined marble
called verdolite can alone be obtained, and that
they wanted to capitalize the quarry on a basis
that gave the owner IO per cent. Failing to
get his consent, they tried--and failed-to
open up the same vein on adjoining land.
They at last selected the Woodbury granite,
whose owner paid an associate of Huston
$ 25,000 to have the contract swung his way.

THE FARCE OF SOLICITING BIDS

But it was different with the furnishing.
The present legislative committee has revealed
enough to make one's brain dizzy. The Board
of Public Grounds and Buildings quietly
adopted a resolution offered by Governor
Pennypaeker that no bids should be considered
that did not cover the whole job. That fact
was not made public, and the advertisements
allowed bids for the whole or in part. All
the witnesses before the Commission said that
they were encouraged to bid on single items
by Joseph M. Huston, the architect, and two
witnesses declared that Mr. Pennypacker himself
told them there was nothing to hinder them
from bidding on any separate item. John H.
Sanderson alone knew of this resolution; he
alone bid on the whole, 23 per cent. off maxi-
mum rates. He got the contract and he knew
he would get it. Long before this time, he was
studying Huston's plans in the locked attic
in the Witherspoon Building in Philadelphia,
where the draughtsmen were at work. He
had organized "The Pennsylvania Bronze
Company," with his brother-in-law, Pedro J.
Salom, as visible head; it furnished chande-
liers at $ 4.85 per pound, regardless of speciii-
cations; and notice that $ 4.85 is not 23 per cent.
off a $ 5 maximum but 3 per cent. The 2 got
lost after the contract was awarded, so witnesses
testify, and never figured afterward except on
the witness stand. It does not matter. He
was the only legal bidder. When one realizes
that some of these. chandeliers weigh two tons,
are loaded with iron worth four cents a pound,
and are billed to the state at far in excess of
their actual weight, one sees Sanderson's possi-
bility. This was the working of Delaney's
"per-pound" rule, that none of the other pros-
pective bidders for the contract knew how
to figure on.

And the "per-foot" rule was equally bench-
