The heaviest previous expenditure on these
two arms of the Empire was in the year 1901,
when $ 66,500,000 was sunk in preparation for
war. In this current year, the appropriation
is, as stated above, more than $ 97,000,000.

Now, how does this burden of expenditure
fall upon the people? The expenditures of
the United States in 1906 totalled an average
of $ 9.20 per inhabitant. Is the burden heavier
in the United States than in Japan? The
Government of Japan has not given out the
figures of the national wealth, or the national
income, per inhabitant. For that reason, only
a very rough idea is obtainable to guide the
student to a conclusion.

The average yearly compensation of the
American laborer in manufacturing pursuits
is close upon $ 475, or nearly $ 1.60 per working
day. By way of comparison, the average
daily wages of the Japanese laborer make
interesting reading. The carpenter in Japan
makes 30 cents a day; the stone-cutter, 33; the
brick-maker, 27%; the paper-hanger, 28; the
jeweler, 26; the founder, 2612; the printer, 19,
and so on down the list. If the farm-laborer
succeeds in making for himself a yearly contract
he will receive for his twelve-months' work
$ 18.74. His wife or daughter will go into the
same service for $ 10.06. The monthly wages
of a female servant in Japan for the year 1906
averaged 89) cents.

The great factories of Japan employed in
1905, 587,851 persons. Of these, 347,563, or
60 per cent., were female. Nearly 37,000 girls
under 14 years of age toiled with their hands
in these mills, working an average of 14 hours
a day for the sum of P, cents per diem. This
is the factory record. But, scattered over the
Empire, there are nearly half a million houses
in which weaving is carried on. In them there
labored in the year 1905 more than 767,000
operatives-and of these 731,000 were women
and young girls. The average earning capacity
of a female weaver in Japan is only nine cents
a day.

Is it any wonder that the burden of that
terrible national debt weighs heavily upon the
people? For everything is taxed in Japan.
The normal tax on land is 2% per cent. of its
assessed value. An income tax is levied on
all incomes over $ 150 per annum, with triflir1g
exceptions. All business is taxed, sometimes
in three or four different ways. Liquors,
sugar, patent medicines, mining tools, traveling
--all are taxed directly. The indirect tax

THE PERIL OF JAPAN

through customs dues amounts to an average
of more than 15 per cent. Tobacco, salt,
and camphor arc monopolized by the Govern-
ment-and the people pay. Under the extraor-
dinary special tax schedule-which the Govern-
ment now admits is to be permanent-the land
taxes were greatly increased; the business taxes
were advanced to half as much again as before;
the income tax was greatly increased, and all
other taxes were advanced.

On top of this rests the burden of the change
that is so swiftly going on in the commercial
world. In the first few years after: the end of
Fcudalism, the people turned individually to
the task of earning a living. They became
fishermen, farmers, merchants, and even manu-
facturers in a very small way. But the march
of time has brought the little individual into
competition'with organizations of capital, with
fishing companies on a large scale, with great
mercantile houses, with factories that can turn
out superior workmanship at a fraction of the
cost in time and labor.

Of course, these matters may in time remedy
themselves. When the rice harvest and_the
fisheries are both successful the people can
struggle along. If they should both fail in
any one year no man can guess the result.
Meantime, the rich men and corporations who
monopolize the industries grow richer. They
bring into Japan the comforts and luxuries of
the Occident. But the mere perusal of the
list of wages paid to workmen will show that
the lower classes of Japan cannot, under
existing conditions, become consumers of Amer,
can goods even in the smallest quantities.

Enough has been said to show how critical
is the economic position of the Japanese Empire
today, and to explain why the United States,
Canada, and even Korea and China are eagerly
sought by the Japanese. The people have
acquired a taste for the life of thc Occident.
They cannot gratify that taste un the money
that can be made in Japan. They seek the
lands where labor is paid a higher wage.

If the an.nual report of the Minister of
Finance indicates one thing more strongly than
another, it is that if the late war had lasted six
months longer it would have left Japan bank-
rupt. Within the next two years, the budget of
the Empire must be cut down by perhaps
$ 100,000,000 a year or Japan will be Perma-
ncntly crippled. The economists of the world
look with anxiety for the preliminary estimates
of the next national budget.
