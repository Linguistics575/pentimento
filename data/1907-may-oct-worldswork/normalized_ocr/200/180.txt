8978 THE REBOUND OF
there was an almost riotous demonstration
when a delegate presented a proposition to
divide the school fund between the races in
proportion to the amount of taxes paid by
each, thus leaving the Negro without the
Southern white man's aid. The Democratic
caucus also refused to extend the life of the
"Grandfather Clause," giving the right of
sutfrage to whites who will not learn to read
and write, while denying it to illiterate blacks.

The South, with no immigration, has increased in population and sent thousands of people to other parts of the Union

encouragement, and has also determined to
make its training fit its needs. Teaching
agriculture is but a beginning; other industrial
features will be added; and county trade
schools will follow in time.

To-day the people demand the discussion
of practical issues. In 1898, it was enough
to know that leaders like Aycock and
Glenn stood for "white supremacy" and
"party rcgularity," and under old conditions
they might never have been recognized as the
champions of anything else. Now ex-Governor
Aycock has made a national reputation as the

other-an advance that is signifocant in many
ways.

So, at last, has come the enfranchisement of
the South, the most significant social develop-
ment of our generation; and in its spirit the
people are building their commonwealth-
building them on the broad foundations of a
genuine democracy, developing their industries
and the wealth of their resources. The joy
of constructive work indeed is now the South-
emer's; and his blood stirs at the thought that
these next fifty years the South will have the
tasks of an _heroic age.
