JAPAN'S WAR TAX AND POVERTY

sold in little square wooden cups makes them
forget the toils of the day. la winter they drink
"white horse," a very cheap sake, and in sum-
mer when their thirst is great they satisfy it
with shochu, a fiery liquor made from the dregs
of the sak√© breweries.

After a time Taki left the wharves and mar-
kets and found employment with l lender of
quilts who lived in Shin Ami Cho (street) in the
Shiba quarter. It was getting on in the winter,
and his duties consisted of keeping track of the
quilts rented to the poor and collecting payment.
For this he received seven cents a day and his
food. In this one street there were seven quilt
lenders who supplied the 350 houses. The
poor cannot afford to own quilts, but when the
cold becomes intense they rent coverings made
of rags sewn together, which can be had as low
as one-half cent a night. In the nipping winter
air, an entire family will huddle under a single
flimsy quilt. The rent must be paid before mid,
night. If not paid, the collector takes the quilt
and leaves the unfortunates shivering. Taki,
though'he had charged machine guns, was a
veritable coward when it came to depriving
the poor of their quilts. Many times he
went away leaving a penniless mother with her
children in possession of a quilt they could not
pay for and turned in his own money instead.
Sometimes the miserable would take a rented
quilt and pawn it. A collection of rags that
rented for a penny a night would bring 15 cents
at a pawn shop and then, reckless of consequen-
ces, a family would dine. The quilt merchant
was relentless in such cases and the head of the
family was invariably arrested and imprisoned.

A HOME WITH THE HOMELESS

Taki hated his occupation; he began to think
better of the fat and prosperous'rickshaw men
and hangers-ou of the yoshiwara district, who
lived off the outcasts and tips from revellers.
Once he had esteemed them as the lowest scum
of Tokyo, but now he felt that he was in an even
lower station. He incurred the dislike of his
employer by interceding for patrons who were
unable to pay quilt rent and was discharged in
January. He went forth into a dreary, drizzling
day. With his few remaining sen he sought
a night's refuge in a cheap lodging house where
mendieants, beggars, paupers; and the homeless
crowd together in the midst of filth and insects
for a penny a night. He was so overrun with
vermin that sleep was impossible, and he left
the horrible den early in the morning and as a

last resort endeavored to find a comrade who
occupied one of the little habitations of three
mats' area which, like rows of dry-goods boxes,
filled the street. After a long search he found
his friend sick at home and suffering deplorably
from hunger and lack of medicine. The house
was so small that the household work was done
outside, yet the rent was three cents a day.
When the family of five slept they were crowded
on the three mats which covered the floor. The
sick soldier declared that if he could earn five drol-
lars a month he could live and support his family.
To be sure they could have no amusements,
could buy no new clothing, and would have to
subsist on fish offal, bad fruit, and spoiled rice,
but they would have a roof over their heads.

Taki had come with the intention of bor-
rowing, but went away regretting that he had
not been able to lend. He walked blindly
through the fog, hungry and heartbroken; a dog,
he thought, fared better than a veteran soldier.
As he turned a corner a carriage bearing a rich
nobleman came at a rapid pace from the Maple
Club. Taki walked directly before the horses
and was run down. He died in a little shop
near by in a few moments, and the newspaper
which chronicled his end quoted his last words.
They were:

"Honorable countrymen, I give my life to
great Japan. May Heaven bless and preserve
our illustrious ruler. I go, a soldier, to, join
my warrior ancestors."

With his last words Taki expressed the
dominant spirit of Japan. Suffer as they will,
object to the rise of the moneyed aristocracy,
grumble over taxes, work for preposterous
wages, they are loyal. The worst grumblers
are the iirst'to insist upon war when the nation's
honor has been called into question. In the
slums of Tokyo one can hear as revolutionary
expressions of opinion as in Paris, but they are
not really meant. The average citizen realises
that Japan, having stepped into the arena,
cannot withdraw without losing everything
that it now holds dear. Therefore he is
steadfast in his patriotism, saying always as do
the story tellers in the Tokyo streets; "When
the Emperor and his soldiers have finished with
the foreigners, he will make Japan an earthly
paradise with their wealth."

And the Government says officially: "Al-
though the national burden was rendered very
heavy by the increase in taxation, such was the
loyalty and patriotism of the whole nation that
no trouble whatever was experienced,'"
