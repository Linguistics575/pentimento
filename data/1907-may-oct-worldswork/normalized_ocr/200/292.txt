Shipbuilding Company, all stating that it was
a stable foundation.

"I sent the drawing of the caisson, with
copies of the letter, and an answer came back
that specifications and drawings of the super-
structure must accompany it, according to the
terms of the bill. I then went to Washington
and met Colonel Lockwood at his office.'Mr.
Lockwood,' I said,'I wish to make these draw-
ings for the superstructure here in Washington,
under your supervision, so there can be no
errors. I would like to have you, in what spare
time you have, help me in this matter.' He
said that he did not consider himself competent
to make these drawings. I then asked him whom
in Washington he did consider competent.
He said there was no one in Washington, and
that he did not consider it advisable for any
member of the Board to look over the drawings,
as the whole Board would have to pass upon
them. But he did say that Mr. Rettig, of Read-
ing, Pa., would be competent to do that work.
I must admit that I showed my anger and I
started to go out of the office, when he said:
'I am advising you for your own benefit.' I
went to Reading and saw Mr. Rettig and
showed him my drawings. He said that he
thought a skeleton structure would be practica-
ble to put on Cape Hatteras, but I told him
that I would like to have him make drawings
for the solid structure; but he said he would
not do it, and that I had better get Mr. Buck.
I asked him if he would make plans for a
skeleton structure if they would be satisfactory
to the Lighthouse Board, and he said that he
would. It was evident that he was not on
good terms with the Lighthouse Board, and
his act and his conversation placed me in a
position where I could make no drawings that
would be satisfactory to the Board, according
to Colonel Lockwood's statement; and so I
again decided to go to Congress for relief in
this matter.

"Up to this time, a period of more than
twelve years had elapsed since my first act of
good faith in this enterprise; and it must be
evident that this work of preparation not only
took the time of myself and many kind friends,
but also cost many thousands of dollars.

THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL

"The bill in its present form finally passed
unanimously through the House and Senate and
was signed by President Roosevelt on March 4,
1905, just one hour before his inauguration.

FOR HATTERAS

"The Government is amply protected, so
that if the lighthouse is not completed in
accordance with the provisions of the act, the
Government will not have to pay for it."

The caisson on which Captain Eells intends
to build his light is in the form of a truncated
cone, instead of the usual cylinder, so that
when buried in the sand it will be anchored
with the weight of sand and rip-rap rock above
its sloping sides; and it differs from all previous
caissons in having double walls, which can be
filled with or emptied of water by powerful
pumps, so that it contains everything within
itself necessary to sink itself. It is a ship while
being towed to location, and a huge diving bell
while being sunk. When afloat, the caisson
will ride out gale after gale, anchored in deep
water. When a calm comes-as calms do
come, once in a while off Hatteras-the im-
mense structure will be towed swiftly to the
buoyed location, and scuttled. Once down,
the weight of the steel and the water in the
hollow walls will hold it down. Then the
work of sinking it in the sand by dredging and
digging from the inside will be done, until
its bottom is thirty feet below the bed of the
ocean.

As fast as the caisson is sunk, it will be fillal
with concrete; when all is done, the huge
double steel shell will be a solid mass of con-
crete, weighing (with the steel tower upon it)
27,000 tons. It will be a steel lighthouse,
built upon a concrete rock in the ocean. In the
course of time, the steel on the outside of the
caisson may rust away. That will not matter,
at all. The concrete rock will be there, firmly
imbedded in the sand, and the light above will
be built upon the solid concrete, so that no
more ships shall go to pieces on that treacherous
coast for lack of warning.

With one instruction to remember "Keep
Outside the Light" -with the certainty that no
storm can shift the tower, and no weather ob-
scure its light entirely, the seamen rounding
Hatteras in the protection of the new light will
do so in increasing numbers and with decrear
ing disasters. It will be not only the greatest
lighthouse engineering feat in the world, be-
sides which Eddystone, Minot's Ledge, Spec-
tacle Reef, and Rothersand will seem small,
but it will be a national monument, typifying
the broad and liberal policy of this nation in
the matter of humanity, in its efforts to insure,
protect, and save the lives of all who approach
its shores in ships.
