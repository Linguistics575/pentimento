as high as Niagara, which will generate 145,000
horse-power when the turbines are installed.
It is claimed that this power can be sent by
transmission lines as far as Fayetteville, 80
miles away. Charlotte, Greensboro, and Con-
cord, the largest mill centres in North Carolina,
and innumerable smaller towns are within half
that distance. The Southern Power Company
has about a dozen Ivater-poiver plants, which
when they are finished will furnish power from
Concord and Taylorsville in North Carolina
to Greenville and Columbia in South Carolina.

between $ 25 and $ 50 a horse-power a year.
The city of Augusta pays less than $ 10 per
horse-power for hydro-electric power. At the
present time a mill can buy it from the
Southern Power Company for $ 20 a horse-
power a year. An auxiliary steam plant is
necessary for heating and humitlifying, and
there is some small danger that an accident to
the transmission lines would cause a loss of
time in the mill. On the other hand, when
buying from the power companies, the

mills will only pay for what they actually



Which destroyed three and damaged one of the five mills of the Clifton and Pacolet companies, and yet their stock
never went below par

Their transmission lines in this territory will
be accessible to more than half the mills in
the South. In Georgia and Alabama, also,
the rivers are being harnessed.

"This is equivalent," said a mill president
in Charlotte, "to the discovery of an inexhaust-
ible coal supply east of the mountains." Bciorc
these great power companies began operations,
mills not situated on streams either used the
power of the steam engine direct or used the
steam engine to generate electricity; with coal
selling from $ 3.75 to $ 4 a ton, it cost them

use. With a steam plant, it costs almost
as much to run half the machinery as it does
for all of it.

Those mills which find steam power cheaper
or more convenient than power from the
transmission lines will not be affected by the
rates of the power companies, but the presence
of the transmission lines gives every mill in
this great section a low price for power above
which they do not have to go. Mr. E. A.
Smith, the president of the Dover Mills at
Pineville, N. C., says:
