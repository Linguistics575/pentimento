men will rememlrr the result. It was the
most disastrous panic and the most deplorable
depression in the history of our day.

The conspiracy hinted at in the opening
paragraphs of this article would probably
plunge the country into a catastrophe the
like of which has never been seen. With the
sudden withdrawal of the money that is the
basis of credit, the whole structure would
tumble like a house of cards. In 1893, the
great railroads were using credit in hundreds of
millions of dollars. As the gold ebbed away
from the banks and the Treasury, the credit
vanished. Half the railroads of the United
States collapsed with it. Wall Street, that
strange, dark-shadowed, light-hearted market-
place of billions, does business almost entirely
on credit. With the withdrawal of gold, a
panic would sweep the Street that would make
all other panics of the past seem like the mur-
muring of a summer breeze upon the sea.
Stock values would not fall; they would dis,
appear.

Let us imagine that the conspirators, to com-
plete the ruin, determined to hold their money
entirely out of commerce for a period of years,
using it neither here nor abroad, but simply
locking it up and drawing upon it only for their
own immediate needs. If the gold were
immediately put in circulation in Europe, it
would gradually come back, following the
natural law that money flows to the centre of
greatest demand. The Plotters, then, to make
their work doubly certain, cap the conspiracy
by locking up in their vaults all the gold that
they have been able to collect.

Let it come at a flood-tide of commerce, or
at ebb, it would not matter. Perhaps, if the
streams of commerce were full to their very
banks, the disaster would be the worse. Let
it be so. Let us suppose that all the great
plants are running full; that the books are
crammed with orders; that millions of extra
men are working at the forges, at the looms, in
the mills, along the railroad right-of-way, on
the docks, at the engine-throttle, everywhere;
that wages are at their highest, and prices of
food and clothing at the top. Let us suppose,
in fact, that to-day is the day.

Then, to-morrow, the sun of commerce stands
still in the heavens. Blight falls upon the
world, -like the dew at night, missing nothing.
The greater merchants hasten to cancel ail
orders at the mills. The loom and the forge
grow silent and dark. In time a million

men walk the streets, looking in vain for work
where no work is. The labor union falls of
its own weight and dies. The wage-scale melts
away. Prices of food and drink and clothing
do not merely fall; they, too, like the prices of
stocks, come down to nothing. For the coun-
try faces, at one stroke, the very depths of
national poverty, the very exhaustion of its
basic wealth that once or twice before it faced,
but only aftera long and bitterstruggle, sinking
slowly to the depths like a great plate through
the water.

For commerce, industry, capital, labor,
investment, life-all things in fact-are but
an inverted pyramid, standing upon a moiety
of real money, gold. The commerce of this
country, in all forms, calls each year for trans-
actions through banks that aggregate from 100
billions to 150 billions of dollars. Technically,
these transactions are called "bank clearings."
They represent the year's business, perhaps
as closely as it can be represented. It is all
based upon that billion of gold, commercial
gold, in the Treasury and the banks. That is
the apex of the pyramid. The "clearings"
represent the money and credit used in mant
facture, trade, industry, merchandising, wages,
rents, taxes-the thousand and one things that
make up the activities of human life. That
is the pyramid itself. It is merely an alloy;
nearly all of it is credit, very little of it is
money.

CREDIT'S PLACE IN THE SYSTEM

It is the type of our civilization. In the days
of barter there was no credit. A man might
trade a carven spear for a comely slaye, then
trade again the slave for a flint. The richest
man in all the tribe might gather up his goods
and go, and no other man would be the poorer.
But we have made for our needs a wonderful
system. We call it money. It involves banks,
treasuries, coins, bills, notes-a thousand
agencies, little and big. It is our servant; we
are its slaves. You and I, being poor men and
not of much account in the world of commerce,
may laugh at it, knowing that we, too, like our
far-distant ancestor, may take our goods and
go, and no man will care much. But he, our
neighbor, being a man of many millions, cannot
go. He is caught in the web of credit.
He cannot get away without destroying, or
threatening to destroy, that web. And the web
is his life, the very thing that makes him the
rich man that he is. Therefore he stays.
