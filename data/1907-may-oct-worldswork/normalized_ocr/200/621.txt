out his long-cherished plan of making that
institution a school of art as well as of phil-
osophy and science. He has also served as
instructor in Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, and in
the Art Students' League and the Academy
of Design in New York. Some of his pupils
are themselves artists; 0thers have become archi-
tects, landscape designers, and draughtsmen.
Others are still at work under his direction.

MRS. MACNEIL'S WORK

Mrs. Carol Brooks MacNeil is the daughter
of an artist and grew up with brushes and
palettes. When she threw them aside in her
preference for clay and modeling tools, it was
a keen disappointment to her father, but the
success of her work has justified her decision.
She might be called a miniature sculptor, if
there is such a phrase, for her creations are not
of statuesque proportions. Portrait busts she
has done, and they are well done; but her
originality has run rather to unique designs for
vases, inkstands, fountains, and other articles
of practical utility. They are spun from pure
fancy with only enough of the solidly real to
hold them down to earth.

Mrs. MacNcil's "Too Late, Ye Can not Enter
Now" represents one of the Foolish Virgins,

wilting under the suddenly realized sentence.
This work in marble is now owned by the elder
Mrs. Cyrus McCormick, of Chicago.

Mrs. MacNeil has recently modeled her two
beautiful boys in one group and is now engaged
in transforming the plaster into more enduring
marble. This part of the sculptor's work is
generally turned over to the professional marble-
cutter, but this portrait bust of her two sons
will be the work of her own hands and may
therefore have a quality of tender finish that
it might not otherwise receive.

Mrs. MacNeil finds time for her children, her
friends, and her music. The MacNeil home at
College Point overlooks the Sound, with its
fleet of yachts and pleasure craft. It is a
quiet, beautiful spot where plants and children
grow in the sunshine, and yet is within easy
reach of New York City. In the summer-
time, Mr. MacNeil is often to be found at work
in the open air back of his studio, either in
front of a modeling stand or in a diminutive
garden. When the tide comes in, he and his
boys throw down their tools and hasten into
their bathing suits for an hour of recreation.
In an atmosphere of natural and unrestrained
joy, the sculptors MacNeil live their lives and
do their chosen work.

GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN

THE SUPERIORITY OF A SMALL COMMISSION OVER THE
ANTIQUATED SYSTEM OF MAYOR AND COUNCILMEN

BY
CHARLES W. ELIOT.

PRESIDENT or HARVARD vmvsxsmr

UNICIPAL government in the United
M States has nowhere been successful,

iand in many places it has been so
corrupt and inefficient as to suggest to anxious
minds the ultimate failure of free institutions.
Yet municipal government comes nearer to
the individual citizen than any other sort of
government. If the municipal business is well
done, it promotes the comfort and dignity of
his own life and that of his family. If it is ill
done, it stains and degrades his whole existence.
The mere sight of municipal work done dis-
honestly, or merely shiftlessly, is extremely
demoralizing for all citizens. Their own

standards of work may easily be affected by
the standards of municipal work; and any dis-
honesty or lack of fidelity in municipal servants
is sure to rob the mass of citizens of securities,
comforts, or facilities which they need, and
have paid for directly or indirectly. Moreover,
corruption and fraud in municipal adminis-
tration tend to penetrate the larger adminis..
trations of the state and the nation. Let us
first examine some of the sources of municipal
failure in the United States.

In the first place, the structure of the city
government in this country was a mostiunfor-
tunate one, It was copied early in the nine-
