HOW TO KEEP
the Bureau of Municipal Reseureh has funds,
avoid the disaster that has discredited the most
popular leader in Tammttny Hall. If, on the
other hand, the Bureau and the Mayor's
Commissioners of Accounts take the search,
light oil the Borough President's acts and con-
sole themselves with dissertations on high
ideals, a corrupt successor to the Borough
President will be perfectly safe, until the light
comes buck. Again, if the noblest man in
New York City takes Mr. Ahearn's place and
fails to change the mechanism of Mr. Ahearn's
office, nothing can prevent the recurrence of
the evils that have characterized Mr. Ahearn's
inelTicicncy. Holes in the streets would be
just as offensive and bumpy if Mr. Ahcam
spent his time at revivals. So, in San Fran-
cisco, if every important oll'me were to be
filled to-morrow by leading sociologists,
preachers, and college presidents, San Fran,
cisco would not have good government and
would be unable to stop the perversion and
waste of taxes, unless business methods were
used regularly to tell the truth about the acts
of government ofTrcials and their subordinates.

Until city, state, and national governments
give a true picture of what they do when they
do it, extravagance and bad government will
be encouraged. Taxpayers who fail to require
a truthful account of the acts of public servants
make dishonesty as easy as honesty. Just as
the cash register, the weekly statement, and
the carbon copy remove temptation and make
honesty easier than dishonesty, so a system
of records and accounts of ofrrcial acts make
governmental honesty and efiiciency easier.

The method whereby the Bureau of Muni-
cipal Research finds out whether ofrrcials tell
the truth and makes the truth known to press
and to public can be applied to every city,
county, and residence suburb. Nothing could
make the governments of Philadelphia and
San Francisco efficient and honest unless their
citizens, from the facts before them, want
efficient and honest government. But a bureau
of municipal research could point the way,
just as the Rockefeller and Phipps Institutes
discover and place before the world truths
regarding the prevention bf disease.

THE NEED OF GOOD HOUSEKEEPING IN MUNI-
CIPAL GOVERNMENT

The trouble with scandal is that it comes
too seldom. Something is needed, like good
housekeeping, that will be not too hard but

"powerful constant." To illustrate: Through-
out Mr. Roosevelt's administration as Governor
of New York, there was not one department
scandal of dimensions to justify a moral
revolution; yet we now know that policy-
holders of the life insurance companies were
systematically plundered. After all, if you
absolutely must be run over by an automobile,
what do you care whether the chauffeur be
drunk or sober? The Pennsylvania tax-
payers who gave $ 2,003 for Â£1 boothlack stand
worth $ 2oodcrire little consolation from 1vilect-
ing that their Governor and the Capitol Come
mission (lid not know the difference between
mahogany and painted pine. Few of us would
forgive a coaehman who could not learn within
300 or 1,003 per cent. the market price of a
horse or a buckhoard; yet the cure that the
"goodness fallacy" urges for stupidity, waste,
blackmail, and corruption is; "Turn the rascals
out and give their places to upright men."
Here and there the recipe is varied to include
legislation that does not provide for its own
enforcement.

We have learned too little from our municipal
experience. As the mud-hen evades the hunter
by diving, only to appear again at another point,
so political badntss dives when attacked, stay-
ing beneath the surface until the good man
has sold his essays upon "The Passing of the
Boss," "The Triumph of Good Over Evil,"
or "The Integrity of the Pcople's Conscience."
But just as pasteurization increases the suscep-
tibility of milk to contamination, so there is
something about public opinion convaleseing
from a moral upheaval on which corruption
seems to thrive. After a Jerome or a Folk is
elected, thc Moral Upheavalist tells us that
"the people always ring true when a moral
issue is raised." While scandal is brewing,
however, he preaches the need for high ideals.
To whom? To the very men who have so
recently rung true, instead of to those who
were and still are responsible for plunder and
mis-government and whose bad character and
corrupt system upheavals rarely touch.

The argument underlying the goodness
remedy runs something like this: "Normally
the rank and file are weak and vicious and only
the few are good; at times of great excitement
over moral issues, many members of the rank
and file can be agitated to a point where they
will accept the leadership of the good man;
the problem, therefore, of reforming govern-
ment is gradually to multiply the number
