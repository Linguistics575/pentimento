large to some. Their proper proportion will
appear only when they arc viewed in com-
parison with what other professions receive
for an equal amount of skill, labor, and respon-
sibility. The average ice for the hazardous
task of opening the abdomen and subsequent
attention will look trivial when compared with
what a corporation or criminal lawyer would
charge in a suit of equal gravity. And beside
the $ 100,000 income for a year's work among
the wealthy, place the statement recently made
by Senator Depew with reference to Senator
Spooner:

"Had he resumed the law when he desired to, he would
have been employed as counsel in nearly all the big rail
road reorganizations, in some of which legal fees of
$ 1,000,000 were paid."

REPRESENTATIVE SURGICAL INCOMES

In considering the average American special-
ist and the average general practitioner,
let us take a city in the central part of the
Union, with a population between 200,000 and
300,000. 1 have before me the figures relating
to such a city and have the advantage of an
intimateknowledge of the physiciansthemselves,
which is a check on accuracy. Of the many
physicians-and the proportion of men with
far-reaching reputations is unusually larger
about 20 per cent. do the bulk of the medical
and surgical practice.

Of the surgeons, there are about a dozen
whom their colleagues call "successful." In
round numbers, their yearly incomes are about
as follows:

l makes from $ 18,000 to $ 20,000
1 makes from
6 make from
4 make from

r5,000 to 16,000
x0,000 to 12,000
5,000 to 6,000
Among those whose annual incomes are less
than $ 5,000, are the dozens of surgeons who
have never risen above mediocrity and the
younger men whose reputations are yet to be
made

So much for the yearly incomes of the sur-
geons. What about individual fees? I hap-
pen to know the most important facts so far as
three of the leading surgeons are concerned.
Dr. A. is a specialist in operations within the
abdominal cavity-next to brain surgery the
most perilous of all. His standing in the pro-
fession is such that every medical society is
glad to have him as a member. He is also
a professor of surgery in an important college.

IS THE DOCTOR

A SHYLOCK?

He is therefore entitled to receive as much as,
or more than, any surgeon in his city. This
specialist has never received a fee larger than
$ 1,000, and that amount has been paid him
but a few times. A number of times he has
received S400 and $ 500, but the majority of his
fees range around $ 200. To the laity, the
average of these fees looks like "easy money,"
but the actual operation is the smallest part of
the surgcon's work, as the following typical
case will show:

The operation is to take place at eleven
o'clock. There have been at least three careful
examinations of the patient beforehand, one
of which included microscopic or chemical
work. No less than two assistant physicians
are required-one to give the anaesthetic,
another to pick up blood vessels as soon as
severed, to avoid hemorrhage. The prepara-
tion of doctors, patient, instruments, and
bandages has consumed most of the forenoon.
The patient is back in bed within an hour, but
the surgeon lingers until consciousness is fully
restored. He sees the patient again late in the
afternoon, and probably again at bedtime,
He counts himself fortunate if he gets no
telephone call at midnight and if he escapes a
hurried call before daylight to check hemor-
rhage or allay pain. This average patient will
require regular attention for two weeks. Such
intangible cares as nervous strain, weight of
responsibility, liability for mishaps, and loss
of prestige through unavoidable failure cannot
be reduced to figures. And if this average
patient were rich-unfortunately, he is not-
the surgeon would not feel overpaid if a grate-
ful family should send him a check for $ 500 or
even $ 1,000. The patient's earning power,
perhaps his life, has been saved.

There is another fact that must not be over-
looked. Dr. A.'s average fee is about $ 200 for
these operations-mot his average for each
operation performed. I have seen this surgeon
operate in at least a dozen cases, each requiring
as much attention as the ease above, from
whom he could not possibly have expected to
receive enough to pay for the ether used during
the operation. Yet his technique was as
thorough and his attention as conscientious as
any patient could have required.

Dr. B. ranks equally with Dr. A. in almost
every respect. His largest fee, up to the present
time, is $ 600; it was for an abdominal operation
when the patient's life was at stake. His
smallest fee has been nothing-many times.
