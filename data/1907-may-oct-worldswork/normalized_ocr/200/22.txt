freely with thousands of ixerwas-'rrrrprudm1tly with many. The favorite
caricature of him represented him as a determined man with a big stick.
His rigorous manner, the utter trccdnm of his talk, the stories that bis
bearers frequently told of the Yeckiesst1ess' of his conversniou-maay
oi them, no doubt, perversions arul exaggcrauons--caused many gentle
persons to fear lat he should ovcnum our liberties. (For cot1firmation
of this, see the, \r York daily newspapers, Especially those of April,
s907,) There "time, indeed, when in fu1aucial circles, he was
called the enemy of wealth and of prosperity, so bitterly did the rich law-
hreakers resent his bringing them to justice. The word Socialist' was
lrcquently applied to him. (See the same attitude about a reutuxy
earlier toward Jetrerson)."



A very useful faculty of the mind, somewhat
neglected by the political critics of our time,
is the faculty which enables one to pick out
from the intricate and noisy activities of men
the few simple, permanent things that are
taking place. The President's manners and
mannerisms, his impetuous deliverance, his per-
sonal complications and controversies, his
combativeness, his versatility of temper, his mis-
leading confidence in some of his friends and
his vehement speech about his enemies, his ab,
horrcnce of a merely formal rcticence, his
enjoyment of action for its own sake and the
abnormal variety of his activities-they: acci-
dental, certainly incidental, qualities of the man
confuse the judgment of those who see little
things big and big things little and blind them
to these simple facts:

That Mr. Roosevelt believes in the people
and they believe in him.

That they believe in him because he pugna-
eiously puts the public welfare and obedience
to the laws above the privileges of any class,
even the corporate class; and because he will
fight for "the square deal": and, for the sake
of these things, they would forgive him many
more and more serious indiscretions than he
has committed. His mannerisms either count
for nothing in the public mind or add to his
popularity.

That he is not an "astute politician," as
machine politicians are astute; for his only
weapon is his confidence in the people and his
frank appeal at every step to their confidence
in him keeps his stick big.

When mere incidents and imagined mysteries
are put aside, the situation is simple and easy
to understand. Here is a vigorous man, mak-
ing public life simpler and honester and bring-"
ing its sinister activities out of concealment.
Whether he swears or prays while he docs it,
whether he is gentle or rough, or speaks loud
or is silent, or smiles or frowns, or sometimes
hits the wrong head and sometimes invites the
wrong man and sometimes confides in the
wrong lady-the public cares about these
incidents of his activity only for a day, The

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

big simple fact is-Roosevelt and the People
against the criminally privileged Interests and
the soft critics. That is all that the people care
to know or that the future will remember; and
this is the only kind of simple great fact that
the people have ever cared about or that the
future has ever remembered.

HOW RAILROAD MAGNATES MAY BECOME
PUBLIC HEROES

HERE was, a month ago, an amusing, if

serious, stream of financial and corpor-
ation pilgrims to Washington. Messrs. Morgan,
Harriman (before the stolen letter appeared!),
Ryan, Speyer, Scligman, Yoakum, and Mellen
are some of the pilgrims who went, whether
on their own accord or on invitation. The
reasons that led them are diverse, but in
general they wished to get the railroads and other
great hr1ancial interests "in touch with the
President."

Some went to protest against the Federal
"interference" with corporations. Others
went to point out to the President that Federal
"interference" is necessary in order to save
the corporations from grave injustice at the
hands of the states. A few went merely to
discuss the situation. One or two, perhaps,
went in a spirit of bravado and defiance; but
most went in a spirit of proper deference to
consult the head of the nation. It is a new
and wholesome sign of the times, this tendency
to remove the veil of secrecy from railroad
operations.

Mr. E. H. Harriman is reported to have
said in a newspaper interviewa little while
ago:

"We [ the railroad'magaates'l have left it to our lawyers
to take care of legislation by whatever means might be
most effective, and to our subordinates to explain things
to the general public. It won't do. If we are
ever to extricate the railroads, we have got to come out in

the open and tell the people the railroads' side of the
matter."

This hits the quick; and nobody has ex-
plained the c.ause of all our troubles about the
railroads more clearly than it is explained in
these sentences. For the gist of the whole
matter is, the railroad managers have not
"come out in the open." If they had done so
from the first, we should never have had any
acute trouble; for the public would not have
had any case against them.

Such questions as rates and fares, with
which the lawmakers and the commissions are
