A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

of labor to pick the cotton from the plant.
While it is foolish to make defmite predictions
about mechanical inventions, it does seem
reasonable to conclude that a machine will be
perfected at some early time which will do at
least the greater part of this work. There are
machines made after three or four models which
now do it imperfectly; and all through the
Southern States men who have seriously studied
this mechanical problem are of one mind about
it, that within a reasonable period a practicable
machine will be invented. It ought to be
said, however, that the great majority of people
still look upon it-as uponthe flying-machine-
as an impossible thing to perfect.

The invention of a cheap practicable ma-
chine for picking cotton would go far toward
solving the problem of labor in this region.

Another problem that we encounter here is
the relation of the races. For it is this part of
the United States that is more densely popu-
lated by Negroes than any other part. It is
here, too, that the Negroes are most back-
ward; but it ought to be remembered always
that both Negroes and whites in this region
constitute so sparse a population that the con-
ditions of labor, or the social conditions that
are now found there, are not a fair indication
of the conditions that will prevail after there
has been a large influx of white immigration,
the coming of which is inevitable. Then the
conditions, both as regards labor and as re-
gards the race relations, will gradually come
to be what they are in the somewhat more
elevated regions of the South.

In all these long reports of Southern progress,
no separate word has been said about the Negro.
He contributes to it and he shares it in varying
degrees in different communities. His capacity
to profit by opportunity is well shown in this
report by Mr. Emmett J. Scott of the success
of the Southern Improvement Company, near
Tuskegee, Ala., organized seven years ago by
Alexander Purves, then treasurer of Hampton
Normal and Agricultural Institute.

The company bought4, ooo acres of land ad-
joining the farm of Tuskegee Institute at
Tuskegee, Ala. This land was generally re-
garded as useless for agricultural purposes,
and was purchased at prices ranging from four
to six dollars an acre. A sawmill was erected
and the settlers were given an opportunity to
earn enough money to provide for themselves
and make a first payment on the land.

It was not so easy to obtain settlers. These

almost barren sand-hills held out but a poor
prospect to Negro farmers who had found it
hard to get ahead even on the "fat land."
In some cases it was necessary, in order to
obtain the farmers the company needed, to
"buy them out of debt."

It was determined at the outset that every
man should have a piece of woodland and a
house. The first two-room cottage cost about
$ 165. Later, with the increased price of build-
ing material, they have been valued at $ 200.
At the present time, there are scventy-eight
houses on the company's land. This land has
increased in the meantime from 60 per cent.
to 150 per cent. in value.

While the men are paying for their land the
company advances them money, when neces-
sary, at 8 per cent., charging them, however,
only for the time they have the money. In
this matter of interest, therefore, the com-
pany has been able to make a considerable
saving to its farmers. The company also buys
fertilizer in quantities and sells it to its farmers
at prices considerably less than they could
purchase it elsewhere. It is one of the con-
ditions of the contract under which the land
is purchased that, during the process of pay-
ment, the farming must be done under the
direction of the company.

One of the farmers received, after all pay-
ments were deducted, $ 325 from the company
-an unusuallylarge earning for a farmer in the
circumstances in which these men are. Nearly
all of this land will be paid for next year. The
company ginned this year 900 bales of cotton,
though only 600 bales were raised on the com-
munity's land. Some of the community farm-
ers have been able to raise on this poor land
more than a bale an acre, which is four times
the average yield per acre of the whole state of
Alabama. Some of the tracts are small, not
more than twenty acres. The plan was to
give each man as much land as it was believed
he could conveniently work at a profit. Some
of the settlers have already paid for their land.
Only two of the seventy-eight have been com-
pelled to give up. It is expected that all of
the settlers now on the soil will pay for their
land within the time fixed by their contract
with the company, which is seven years.
