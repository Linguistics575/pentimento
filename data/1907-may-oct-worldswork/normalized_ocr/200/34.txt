it was, because of their preceding caution, the
banks stood like a solid wall behind the mar-

The warnings carried by this collapse to the

personal friend. Yet when that man

has become a public official, chosen
by an imperial state for a service affecting the
entire country, some measure of reserve may
be cast aside in the interest of truth. In the
year 1900, the name of Charles E. Hughes
was not to be found in "Who's Who in
America." In the year 1907, his name and
achievements are known in every village be-
tween the two bceans and in every capital of
Europe. And this sudden prominence has
not surprised any of his friends; they have
been quietly waiting for the world to discover
what they have many times asserted that he
is-" the ablest lawyer of his age in New York
City."

Thirty years ago I was one of a group of
college students that welcomed into Brown
University the boy who was "father to the
man." He was of slender, boyish figure,
obviously immature, uncertain of himself,
plastic and receptive, with little trace in his
bearing or manner of the strong" and dignified
personality that has since developed. Like
Kipling's ship, he had not "found himself."
He was "moving about in worlds half realized."
He clearly needed, not professional or tech-
nical study, but a chance to ripen under in-
tellectual sunshine. He needed, above all,
to "invite his soul." He would have been
stunted and ruined had he plunged at once
into professional or technical study. His

IT IS a difficult task to analyze a close

nature needed tempering rather than sharpen-
ing. The American college is often reproached
for offering to young men a life that is appar-
ently leisurely and desultory, as contrasted
with the intense and specialized activity of
the professional or technical school. But it
finds ample justification in the careers of men
who in those four years of unhurried ripening
discover for the first time their own powers,
their future task, and determine their own
Weltanscluruang. When such men graduate,
they are indeed "out of a job," but they are
in permanent possession of an ideal.

Young Hughes entered college poor in purse,
with no influential friends behind him, with no
athletic or social prestige, but with the blessing
of a sturdy, God-fearing ancestry, and an
intensely alert and eager mind. His father-
still living-was an honored clergyman, and
the boy was brought up to revere the simple,
homely virtues which have formed the sub,
stance of American character. Yet it was very
clear that he would not choose his father's
profession. Though of stainless character,
he was thoroughly unconventional in his mode
of life, and had a touch of that Bohemianism
which among students is so frequently the mask
of profound moral seriousness. He never
hurt himself through over-study. He was
intellectually a rover, wandering at will through
vast tracts of English and French literature,
and easily the best read man in his class. He
managed to take high honors in scholarship,
