IMMIGRATION AT HIGH TIDE



SLO VAK

in our history. In 1905, the million mark was
passed and the prophets themselves stood
amazed. And during the past year the 11um-
ber has shot upward until already a big start
has been made toward the two-million goal,
with every indication that the present year
will carry us at least a quarter of the remaining
distance to it. Recurring to his wave line,
one will find the 1906 influx of aliens towering
like a Himalaya in the midst of humble foot,
hills. But it, in turn, promises to be dwarfed
within a twelvemonth.

THE INCREASE OF A SINGLE YEAR

It is not easy to conceive what our immi,
gration has really come to be. The frgurcs
are too stupendous to be grasped by the mind.
Let one who has sat in the magnificent Stadium
at Cambridge, as one of 40,000 spectators at
a Harvard-Vale football game, reflect that if
the immigrants entering our ports during the
fiscal year 1906 were brought together, they
would make a throng twcr1ty-fwc and a half
times as large as that which crowds every
available foot of space around the great oval.
Let him consider that the number admitted

in this twelvemonth from Norway and
Sweden alone would more than fill the Stadium;
that the number from Germany would do the
same; that the influx from Great Britain
would fill it two and a half times. That from
Russia would fill it more than five times;
that from Austria-Hungary would fill it more
than six times; and the contributions from
Italy would do it seven times, with people
to spare Let him further call to mind that,
on the average, the Stadium could be packed
with the aliens who are landed at Ellis Island,
New York, every seventeen days throughout
the entire ycar-indecd, with those who are
landed in less than a week at certain busier
portions of the year.

Then let him consider that the total number
of immigrants admitted in 1906 would nearly
serve to populate either the city of Philadelphia,
or the cities of Boston and Baltimore com-
bined; that, in fact, it would people all Mary-
land, or all Nebraska, or the whole region
occupied by Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. These six
states and territories have an aggregate area
of 649,320 square miles, which is nearly 18
