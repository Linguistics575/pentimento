schemes that were offered me, but I learned the
methods of business investment. After I
came to Columbus, I made up my mind to put
into practice what I had learned, and I was
successful."

President Jones made a fortune, I am told,
of something like $ 30,000 before he came to
Wilberforce as president of the College.

PROMINENT CITIZENS OF WILBERFORCE

Iwas impressed with the fact, during my visits
to Wilberforce, that one thing which has given
chamcter to the community is the numberofdis-
tinguished men who have lived and worked here.

The house which President Jones occupies
at present was formerly occupied by Bishop
James A. Shorter, one of the founders of the
College. Bishop Daniel A. Payne, who was
more than any one else responsible for the
existence of the College, lived near by for many
years, until he died, in 1892. Bishop B. W.
Arnett, who, until he died in the fall of 1906,
was one of the most influential men in the
African Methodist Espicopal Church and
one of the trustees of the College, lived
for thirty-five years in Wilhcriorcc. Bishop
Arnett was born in a Quaker settlement at
Brownsville, Pa., in the same year as James
G. Blaine, whose parents lived directly across
the street.

Though these men are little known to the
world at large, they did good service for the
uplifting of the Negro race and are remembered
with reverence and gratitude by the people
they served, both outside and inside of the
church whose infiuence they have helped to
extend all over the United States and even to
Africa. Every year brings a considerable
number of students who come from Africa to
prepare themselves for the ministry at the
theological seminary connected with the Cole
lege here.

One of the most interesting little homes
in the community is that of Miss Hallie Q.
Brown, who has been for years a public figure.
She is an elocutionist, and in the course of a
long professional career has traveled all over
the world. She was at one time what used to
be known as "Lady Principal" at Tuskegee.
Although by the nature of her profession she
is constantly moving about, she has maintained
her home in Wilberforce ever since her gradua-
tion from the College in 1873. The house is
occupied at present by her mother and sister.
Mrs, Brown. her mother, is an interesting old

lady whose memories go back to the days
before the war, in Virginia. In 1860, she,
with her husband and a number of other
colored people, went from Pittsburg to Canada,
and lived for a time in what was known as
"Kings Settlement," one of several refugee
settlements founded near Chatham, Canada.
Her son, Jerrc Brown, is immigrant inspector
at Detroit, Mich. He is one ofa considerable
number of successful young men, in different
parts of the country, who have gone out from
Wilberforce and stillclaim it, in a way, as their
home.

Another former student, who after some
years in the West has returned to Wilberforce
to make his home, is W. A. Anderson, who
conducts a grocery business. He lives in a
comfortable and well ordered little home
which, like nearly all the homes in this com-
munity, displays a thrifty sense of order and
a discipline in the household virtues, which
is, after all, perhaps the most important prod-
uct of Christian civilization.

THE PROSPERITY OF WILBERFORCE NEGROES

Of the sixty families that make up the Wilber-
force community, forty-seven own their own
homes. Four farmers of the community own
land in the surrounding country which is
valued at about $ 100 an acre. The College
has 350 acres. President Jones has 280 acres,
a part of which he hopes to add to what the
school now possesses, should the agricultural
school eventually be established. In all, there
is owned by the school and members of the
community about 1,700 acres.

During the last few years, several handsome
new homes have been erected, fitted with all
the comforts and the conveniences of modern
city houses. The home of Bishop Lee, valued
at $ 6, ooo, is one of these. Bishop Lee grad-
uated from Wilberforce in 1872, and was
president of the College from 1876 until 1884,
when he resigned to accept the editorship of
the Christian Record, one of the publications
of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
He makes his home in Wilberforce, though
his duties take him away a large part of the time.

Joseph P. Shorter, superintendent of the
Normal and Industrial Department, which
was established by the Ohio legislature in
1887, owns a farm of eighty acres in the commu-
nity, the work of which he superintends, in
addition to his work in the College. Caleb
