The man who said this is not it Congressman
nor a capitalist nor a manufacturer, but an
humble, slave-born Negro farmer-Calvin
Brock, of Wayne County. He was talking
to the Governor of North Carolina, whose
salary is only $ 4,000 annually and whose clear
profit is minus-while Calvin Brock had made
the year before a clear profit of $ 2, r23.61 on
fifteen acres of strawberries alone, besides
cultivating fifty acres of land in other crops.

he astonished the soil itself by the energy of
his reforms. Hitching a 1,100-pound mule to
an ordinary plow, he found that it would not
penetrate the brickyard that lay beneath
the few inches of cultivated upper crust.
Then he hitched up two horses and they broke
off his plow, whereupon he "cussed" and sent
to Chattanooga for a four-horse disk plow.
By this time the "moss-backed" farmers who
had never averaged more than a quarter-bale
per acre had sworn that he would ruin his
land forever with his new-fangled "book-
farming" ideas; but to no'effect. "I surely
can't make money by your plans," he retorted,

Another experience is that of a white farmer
in an adjoining county who paid $ 500 for a farm
of 53 acres in r899--not quite $ 10 an acre. Its
former owner had acted on the theory that he
didn't own anything except three inches of
surface soil, and with such cultivation it took
four acres of the land to make a bale of cotton.
But that policy by no means commended itself
to the new owner. Thoroughly inoculated
with the idea of crop rotation and deep plowing,

for ruining the land, it's my own, I reckon,

The next year indicated the land's upward
trend; and by proper rotation and cultivation
he brought it up until, in 1905, part of it made
two bales of cotton per acre; and this year,
