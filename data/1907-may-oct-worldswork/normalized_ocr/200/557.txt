litigant or possible litigant. There was a
Captain Stone, a.fricnd, connected with a
telephone company. Captain Stone was re-
quested to render his bill for judge Taft's
private'phone. The bill did not appear, and
the Judge sent for it. He added a message
that if it was not forthcoming, he would be
compelled to have the'phone taken out of his
house. His attitude was the same toward

railroad passes. He never rode free except
on his own receivership roads.

pleasing both sides. Mr. Frank O. Lowland,
clerk of the court, who has served under twenty-
five judges or more, declares that hu never heard
21 lawyer grumble over one of his decisions.
