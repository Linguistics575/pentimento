THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE

are due to Wofford College. The ability to
see the profits in good schools, good roads,
good water, and sewerage plants is the mark of
an educated community. If Wofford College
had never graduated a distinguished scholar,
it would still rank as an efficient educational
institution, for it has trained a community to
have a far-sighted public spirit.

The influence of education in the future will
be greater than it has been, for Wofford is no
longer alone. There is now an adequate
public-school system to support it. Last year
one person in every six in the town was en-
rolled as a scholar at the public schools. Be-
sides this, Wofford maintains a high school
which has itself doubled in numbers in the last
five years. There is a new science hall at
Wofford, the gift of a mill president of Spartan-
burg. There is a girls' seminary just outside
of town and a girls' college in it. This college
was founded in a typically American way.
About the time the Spartan Mill was built, one
of its promoters asked Mr. Converse to move
into town. He replied that he was thinking
of going to Washington to educate his daughter.
He could not educate her in Spartanburg, he
said, because there was no girls' college there.

"What's the reason we can't have one?"
said the other man. No reason was found
sufficient even to delay the founding. A stock
company was formed and in 1890 Converse
College was built. On Saturday, January 2,
1902, the school burned down. On the for.
lowing Monday a meeting was called and in
thirty minutes enough money raised to rebuild
the college better than before. People in
Spartanburg now look upon the fire as a god-
send. When the stock company was formed,
the stockholders supposed that the college
would be self-supporting or perhaps might
even pay a small dividend. When they found
that the kind of an institution which they
wanted would not pay dividends, they gave the
property to a board of trustees and from time
to time during the next eight years Mr. Con-
verse, who had been the largest stockholder,
helped the college with money. He died in
1899. In his will he left the college one-third
of his fortune. The smokestacks are respon-
sible for the money and the education for the
wise use of it.

Nor is the influence of these institutions con-
fined to their students. The presence of the
faculties has an effect on the town. In 1894,
the professor of music at Converse organized

8993

a musical festival. One has been held every
year since and during that time they have had
"The Messiah," "Elijah," "Faust," "Aida,"
and many other notable performances.
Thomas's Orchestra has played at the festivals
and Madame Nordica, Madame Louise Homer,
Signor Campanari, and many other distin-
guished visitors have sung. The professor
of music Who organized the festivals has gone
away but the appreciation of good music has
been developed in the town so that the festivals
go on as successfully as before. The attend-
ance has been such that the guarantee fund
promised by citizens of Spartanburg has never
been needed. At other places in the Pied-
mont similar things have happened, for this
section, is the centre of an educational trans-
formation as significant as the revival of
industry. At Columbus, the profits of the cot-
ton mills have been used to establish trade
schools for all the people. At Durham, N. C.,
commercial prosperity has built up one of the
most amply endowed small colleges in the
United States.

The people of Spartanburg are now Com-
mercially and intellectually a part of the world.
Spartanburg goods are sold along the Red Sea
and in China; its people have Italian and
German opera at home. They travel in their
own country and abroad.

The economic benefits of the mills will be-
come more apparent in the future, for the
transformation of a people's habits cannot be
done in one generation.

FACTORY LIFE AND CHILD LABOR

When Mr. Converse was running the old
Glendale Mill he knew, personally, the people
who worked for him. Many of the older
employees had special privileges. He was
known among them as the "old man" -, term
of affection and regard. But he was an ex-
ceptional employer. In many of the mills the
operatives were not so well off. The wages
paid were high enough to attract large numbers
of people from the farms and mountains.
There was more mill labor than there was
demand for it. The mills in which the worst
conditions prevailed could get a full comple-
ment of "hands" as well as those that spent
some of their profits in making better tenements
and in building schools. Just the opposite
condition holds true now. There is hardly
a mill in the Carolinas that can keep all of its
machinery going the year round. The labor
