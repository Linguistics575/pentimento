THE PREVENTION OF WAR

great national policy. Yet, through the de-
cades, in the face of terrible defeats at the hands
of Napoleon and of the combined Anglo-
French forces in 1854, the ambition still lives
and underlies the very throne of Russia. Of
what avail a peace movement to check an
ambition such as that?

So well is this limitation recognized, even by
the peace advocates themselves, that many
of the leaders of the movement to-day except
from the list of quarrels which they believe to
be properly subject matter for arbitration
such international controversies as involve
a question oi national honor. Here, of course,
arises a great controversy, for who dare under-
take to say where national honor ends and
national conceit or national avarice begins?
When, in the tumess of time, Russia's march
upon the Persian Gui and the Indian Ocean
meets the outposts of Britain's power, how very
feeble will sound the voice that cries "Peace!"

WARS OF PERSONAL AMBITION

In the case of wars that arise from the per-
sonal ambition of one man, the task of the
Peacemaker is, perhaps, a trifle easier. It
may be that Napoleon III.vwas in large part
responsible for the Crimean War. It served
him two good purposes, the inflation of the
minds of the enthusiastic French with a new
idea of Imperial grandeur, and the gaining
of the good-wili of the Pope. But, outside of
it, he and his famous "blood-and-iron" con-
temporary, Bismarck, can be said to have
been directly responsible for four wars, insti-
gated by dynastic and territorial ambition,
which cost nearly half a million lives and over
two billion dollars.

An overwhelming world-opinion against war
might well have given to France and Germany
a few more years of patience and of thought
before they plunged into the Franco-Prussian
War. Even though the individual ambitions
of the men remained unchanged, the terrible
responsibility involved in entering upon a
course and a policy opposed to an evidently
universal sentiment might well tend to soften,
if not altogether to eliminate, a personal
ambition that called for war piled upon war.

The peace-propagandists are not without
resources for argument, both in respect to the
wars entered into for the sake of national
pride and the wars entailed by personal ambi-
tions. Once England went to war to avenge
an ear lost by a sea-captain called Jenkins,

somewhere abroad on the Spanish main. The
national pride was aroused, and in spite of the
eloquent protest of Walpole, war was declared.

WARS OF COMMERCE

To-day, the considerations of commerce
outweigh all others before the councils of
Britain, Germany, France, and the United
States, at least. There have been few real
commercial wars since the beginning of the last
century; but the questions that to-day look
most likely to result in war are commercial
questions, rather than questions of national or
personal ambition, territorial aggrandizement,
or even class freedom.

Perhaps the most immediately impressive
of these great questions is the question of the
"open door" in the Orient. The spheres of
influence are apparently well-defined, yet
Britain deemed it necessary to teal a march
on its neighbors by a treaty with Japan, and
the delimitation of the powers in the Orient
has not produced perfect harmony by any
means. Russia and Japan fought not so much
over the territory of Manchuria as over the
commerce of the littoray of Asia and the rich
valleys that lie behind it. The time may
come, though it is not in sight, when the very
life of the United States Pacific Coast will
demand a war between this country and Japan.
In such a case, what would the advocate of
peace have to offer as a quid pro quo for the
rights the prospective combatants must give
up for the sake of a settlement?

It has been pointed out of late that the rapid
increase of the commercial importance of the
Rhine va ley in the German Empire has made
it an irksome fact that the mouth of that river
lies in Holland, and that the very growth
fostered by Germany is enriching Rotterdam
and Antwerp, two foreign cities. Will time
remove the disadvantage of this situation, or
will time sweep away the national boundary?
One thing or the other, it would seem, must
come to pass. If the latter, the method of the
change is surely a fit subject for the advocates
of world-peace to consider carefully. If the
matter were brought down to a commercial
basis entirely and national pride eliminated,
those two cities and that stretch of Holland
might be bought and paid for in cash much
cheaper than they could be bought by war--
but what if they refused to be bought?

It is true that the growth of commerce and
the struggle for commerce between the great
