AN UNCTUOUS

A chapter of the report begins in this way:
"The best crop raised on the farm is the boy and girl.
The Winnebago County Farmer Boy's Experiment Club
was organized Feb. 22, 1902. It now has a membership
of 500. The Girls' Home Culture Club was organised
two years later. It now has a membership of 300."
Then follow suggestions of means of interest-
ing the boys and girls in farm life; stories are
told of prize competitions in farm tasks; a
poem, "The Boy With the Hoe," clinches the
argument for these competitions; needle-work
tests and bread-making tests are described.
There is tt chapter on manual training, others
on books and pictures, traveling libraries, and
the consolidation of country schools. The
few tables of statistics are carefully scattered
through the book, far enough apart never to
be tiresome. But pictures are everywhere,
and all through the report are lively corn-
parisons, and crisp sentences in the vernacular.
One lays down this handsome little book with
the wish that half the fiction of the day were
done as well. It presents a living story of
cheerful, vigorous real men and women teach-
ing real boys and girls to do and to think.
And it is a lesson in the art of presenting living
facts that other public servants may proiit by.

FOOTBALL HEROES AND EXAMINATION HEROES

HEN President Eliot, of Harvard Uni-

versity, declares that sports which re-
quire leg-padding, and face-guards and the
like have no place in educational activities,
doubtless he seems to a strenuous generation
to be speaking, a soft, degenerate language.
For, if this be true, how very far from a proper
training of youth have we wandered these
twenty years or more!

Yet the wonder is, to well-balanced men,
that Mr. Eliot and others in similar authority
have been so slow to tell the plain truth about
the abuse of "athletics" in college life. Per-
haps we had to run this cycle of silliness to
have done with it. But these signs of recovery
are grateful.

It is a simple matter to think clearly about,
difficult as it has been to act sancly. Nobody
wants boys to grow up as "mollycoddler" No-
body objects to sports; for sports have brought
a most wholesome change from the old self-
conscious type of pale college students. The
"grind" is an unlovely creature, as the foot-
ball brute is. And even sports that involve
danger are desirable.

But the harm has come in the attitude to

life and in the conception of training that the
prevalent view of football has brought. For
the exaggerated intercollegiate contests have
not encouraged athletics. They have had as
little to do with any sane system or conception
of athletics as they have had to do with
scholarship. They have made heroes of the
wrong kind of youth.

It is not perfectly clear that we need heroes
at all in our college life; and, when we recover
from examinations as a method of selecting
heroes of scholarship and from football as a
test of heroes of the undergraduate world, our
colleges will the better have in hand the per-
fectly plain task of training boys by normal
methods-that is, by steady, well-ordered
work, body, mind, and character. We shall
then have college youth with as little self-
consciousness as possible. It is doubtful
whether the colleges where football and ex-
aminations are the chief tests of manliness and
of scholarship are doing their tasks. The
Roman gladiator and the mediaeval priest
excelled us at both these exaggerated and
unbalanced activities.

AN UNCTUOUS JUNE INDUSTRY

THIS is the time of year when the giving of
honorary degrees becomes an unctuous
industry. A proper recognition of scholarship
or of distinguished public service when well
and sparingly bestowed, the honorary degree
has become in the hands of most American
colleges a farce that persists by vanity and
flattcry. Are you a rich manka moderately
rich man, just rich enough to give promise of
becoming richer a few years hence? If you
are, you may have to defend yourself against
an aggressive LL. D. If you are already very
rich, you are safe; for the hint would then be
too bald and bold. Are you a popular preacher
whom parents consult about the education of
their sons? If you are, a D. D. will get you,
if not this year, then the next, or the next.
Are you a college president, however humble,
or a professor who has edited a series of text-
books? Then the rules of the union demand
your decoration. The tailors who make (and
rent) academic gowns have had a pr0spcr0us
season; and the monohippic game goes sol,
emnly on, as if all the world did not smile at
it. How the D. D.'s and the LL. D.'s can
look each other in the face and remain grave
is a wonder; for these honorary distinctions
are no longer taken seriously by the public.
