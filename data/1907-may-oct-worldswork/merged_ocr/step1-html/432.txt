lawyer to the bench where his father had sat<br/>
twenty years before. Since then the son has<br/>
followed this eminent father higher and higher<br/>
up, as Solicitor-General, as Secretary of War,<br/>
and lastly, as a Presidential possibility; until<br/>
now, at only fifty years of age, he has passed<br/>
his father, and is a "probability."<br/>
<br/>
As a judge, Taft began to show that marvelous capacity for clear thinking which he<br/>
had been achieving by such hard work. He<br/>
hated the trickery, the juggling of <span style="color: #0000FF;">technicalities</span>, the playing for delays, that befuddled an<br/>
issue. Unerringly he went straight to the kernel<br/>
of justice.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Then </span>election day drew near. His unexpired term lasted but a year, and to continue<br/>
there, he must go before the people. But first<br/>
he was at the mercy of the nominating convention; and, as usual, the convention was at<br/>
the mercy of the machine. Men loyal to the<br/>
machine thought they should have the job<br/>
held by the machine's implacable foe. The<br/>
young leader, Cox, looked at the matter in the<br/>
same way. But Cox and Foraker happened<br/>
to be working together just then, and a whisper<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">floated </span>from the executive mansion: "Support<br/>
Taft." But there was no deal with Taft.<br/>
Foraker was a better public servant as Governor<br/>
than he has been since. And, moreover, Taft's<br/>
name on the ticket would help it. So Cox<br/>
did support Taft, in this, the only time when<br/>
he has ever been a candidate for <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>. And<br/>
Taft was nominated, and was elected. Five<br/>
thousand was a comfortable, and even <span style="color: #0000FF;">gratifying<br/>
</span>majority.<br/>
<br/>
He now had a term of five years before<br/>
him, but he served only two years. President<br/>
Harrison wanted him for the service of the<br/>
Nation, and in 1890 Judge Taft resigned, and<br/>
went to Washington as Solicitor-General <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the United States. In the routine press<br/>
mention of his appointment at the time, it was<br/>
stated that he had not been an applicant. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This<br/>
<br/>
</span>was strictly true, even though there were a<br/>
$ 7,000 salary attached. In this particular case<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>had sought the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SOLICITOR-GENERAL </span>OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>
<br/>
The appointment came on the last day of the<br/>
year, and a fortnight later he had on his hands<br/>
the defense of the Government in a controversy that had fretted the peoples of three<br/>
countries for fourteen years past. This was<br/>
the old, wearisome question of the seal fisheries.<br/>
It had flamed to a critical point, now. Our<br/>

<br/>
revenue cutters in Bering Sea had captured a<br/>
Canadian schooner, the Sayward, fifty-nine<br/>
miles from land, and the Federal District<br/>
Court in Alaska had condemned it to be sold.<br/>
The owner demanded damages. The Canadian Government thought he should have<br/>
them, and Great Britain thought the same.<br/>
The Premier, Salisbury, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vigorous</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>took the<br/>
matter up with Blaine, our Secretary of State.<br/>
But we rejected the Sayward claim, whereupon<br/>
the other side proposed arbitration. We were<br/>
considering this, when Great Britain startled<br/>
us by bringing the case before our own Supreme<br/>
Court.<br/>
<br/>
This was done indirectly, by giving sanction<br/>
to the Sayward's owner and the Canadian<br/>
Minister of Justice in an application for a writ<br/>
prohibiting the forfeiture proceedings against<br/>
the libelled vessel. Here was a most novel<br/>
suit, because of the parties thereto. Blaine,<br/>
however, did not relish the alleged compliment<br/>
to our courts. A decision against us would<br/>
put us in the wrong in a controversy with<br/>
another nation. But the other nation declined<br/>
to be bound by a decision the other way. Still,<br/>
in this embarrassing muddle so craftily <span style="color: #0000FF;">engineered</span>, it was very important that we should<br/>
win the Supreme Court case. Pending the<br/>
suit, more than one hundred vessels, nearly<br/>
all Canadian, were equipping for a crusade on<br/>
the seals. During one closed season, they<br/>
would literally destroy the rich industry.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the case stood when the new <span style="color: #0000FF;">Solicitor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">General </span>took hold. Opposing him <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Calderon </span>Carlisle, Jr., and later, Joseph H.<br/>
Choate. But he plunged into the devious<br/>
tangle, and came forth with a brief 300 pages<br/>
long, clearly, patiently, and effectively sustaining his country. It revealed a staggering<br/>
amount of research. And he won the <span style="color: #0000FF;">case</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Quickly following on the heels of this labor,<br/>
there had to be defended another suit of vast<br/>
importance. This grew out of Speaker Reed's<br/>
blithesome arithmetic in counting a quorum.<br/>
A firm of importers, being made to pay the<br/>
new high duties, tried to knock out the whole<br/>
McKinley tariff on the contention that the bill<br/>
had not been passed by a constitutional quorum.<br/>
They had won their <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>already in the Circuit<br/>
Court, but the Government had appealed to<br/>
the Supreme Court. Here its counsel (Taft)<br/>
fell back on the record of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">House</span>'s proceedings. Speaker Reed had announced from<br/>
the Clerk's list 74 members present at <span style="color: #0000FF;">roll-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">call </span>who had not voted. These, with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">38<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
