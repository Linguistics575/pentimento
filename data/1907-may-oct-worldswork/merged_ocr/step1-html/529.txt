<br/>
</span>The tunneling and lining are necessary to carry the canal through a range of soft adobe hills and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">protect </span>it<br/>
from sudden washing rains<br/>
<br/>
pumped into the heading for seventy-two hours<br/>
while the men outside worked in <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-minute<br/>
</span>shifts on a temporary opening. As they worked<br/>
the entombed men implored them to hurry.<br/>
The first lot that were saved took their turn at<br/>
the shovels until the others were reached. All<br/>
were rescued except six. These had been<br/>
caught and killed by the falling rock.<br/>
<br/>
The lowest price paid for labor is $ 2.50 a<br/>
day and the average is about $ 3. The men<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
have lodgings-with hot and cold showers--<span style="color: #0000FF;">frcc</span>. Their meals cost 75 cents <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>. They<br/>
can save about $ 15 a week after paying their<br/>
expenses. At the camp the food is <span style="color: #0000FF;">extraordinarily </span>good and varied. Yet the average<br/>
stay of laborers is only about two weeks. At<br/>
the slightest pretext, or often without any<br/>
pretext, they leave, for they know that they<br/>
can get their fare paid to any one of a dozen<br/>
other places where a job is <span style="color: #0000FF;">whiting </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
