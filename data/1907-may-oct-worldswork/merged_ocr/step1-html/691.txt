HOW TO FIND GOOD MEN IN YOUR OWN SHOP<br/>

<br/>
R. CHARLES M. SCHWAB, when<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>at the head of the Carnegie plants,<br/>
<br/>
once remarked with breezy, jovial<br/>
vehemence:<br/>
<br/>
"Good men! We make them here, the<br/>
same as we make good steel. There are no<br/>
better men in the world than hundreds of those<br/>
we have in our plants. We always know<br/>
where to find the man we want without going<br/>
outside."<br/>
<br/>
The difference between this view of the head<br/>
of 50,000 men and that of the great majority<br/>
of industrial captains, who continually and<br/>
bitterly bemoan the shortage of good men, is<br/>
due chiefly to the fact that Mr. Carnegie himself was a wizard in the discovery of latent<br/>
ability among his own employees.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Carnegie always ascribed his success to<br/>
his men and, on one occasion, suggested that an<br/>
appropriate epitaph for himself would be:<br/>
"Here lies one who knew how to get around<br/>
him men who were cleverer than himself!"<br/>
<br/>
This peculiar <span style="color: #0000FF;">insistency </span>on the value of men<br/>
was almost always reflected in his lieutenants.<br/>
Captain Jones, his noted superintendent, was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marvel of discernment and judgment in<br/>
making selections from even the yard laborers<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-of </span>whom Mr. Schwab was one. And, after<br/>
Mr. Schwab had risen to the highest position<br/>
in the Company, he always knew Tom, Dick,<br/>
and Harry at the machines. It was this<br/>
instinct, possessed by his lieutenants, in finding<br/>
"good men" among the army of employees<br/>
which has made the steel industry of America<br/>
the leader of the world in methods and costs.<br/>
<br/>
A member of a firm of contractors recently<br/>
replied to the writer's query:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span>'m often in trouble to find the men I<br/>
want, but it's because I have [ 0 move about<br/>
so much that I am not able to look for them."<br/>
<br/>
"But your foremen can always suggest good<br/>
men." I remarked.<br/>
<br/>
He smiled. "Look here!" he exclaimed.<br/>
"Here's a factory building that's got to be<br/>
<br/>
rushed. The foreman's a good man and loyal<br/>
to us, but, do you suppose that if I wanted to<br/>
select one or two of his assistants to put on<br/>
another job he'd pick out the best for me,<br/>
getting himself and this job <span style="color: #0000FF;">balled </span>up by so<br/>
doing? Not much! I've been <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>foreman<br/>
myself and I know just how it is. His reputation depends upon the way this job is put<br/>
through, and he's going to hang, like grim<br/>
death, to every good man he's got, and I don't<br/>
blame him. But it doesn't help me any in my<br/>
search for good men for other jobs."<br/>
<br/>
I have received one equally frank explanation from an employee-a chief clerk in the<br/>
freight auditing department of a great railroad.<br/>
He had resigned some time before and was in<br/>
business for himself.<br/>
<br/>
"There were more than forty clerks under<br/>
me," he said, "and of course some of them<br/>
were good-far too good to be doing routine<br/>
work. I don't believe you can get forty men<br/>
together, anywhere, without finding two or<br/>
three who are well qualified, in every respect,<br/>
for higher positions than those they are in.<br/>
Now who do you suppose was put in as my<br/>
successor?<br/>
<br/>
"They brought in a man from the Michigan<br/>
Central! That's policy, you know. He knew<br/>
rates and ways on that line which our manager<br/>
wanted to know, so they secured him; and<br/>
they didn't look for any good man among my<br/>
forty. There's a lot of that sort of thing going<br/>
on, but that is not where the chief difficulty<br/>
lies. I was often asked by the head of the<br/>
department if I had any good man suitable for<br/>
transfer to some more important work. Now<br/>
that's where it hit me, and hit me hard. Every<br/>
month the expense of my department was<br/>
compared with the corresponding expense<br/>
of the year before, or the year before that.<br/>
Every month the percentage of expense against<br/>
the business done was <span style="color: #0000FF;">figured</span>. If I broke <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>record, I received a little note urging me to<br/>
keep up the pace and improve it<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>If the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
