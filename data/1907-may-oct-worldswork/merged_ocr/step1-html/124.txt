became mutual, and--thanks to the alarmist<br/>
campaign-probably permanent. In that first<br/>
week of September, 1905, telegrams of the<br/>
most atrocious and sensational kind were<br/>
manufactured for and by the San Francisco<br/>
papers and worked round via Shanghai and<br/>
Manila. Investigation proved that they had<br/>
never passed through a Japanese telegraph<br/>
office. They were eagerly copied by all the<br/>
American journals. The editor of a leading<br/>
New York paper had, a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">weeks </span>earlier,<br/>
offered his columns to the Japanese authorities<br/>
for any matter which they might wish to lay<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unofficially </span>before the public. When the riots<br/>
occurred, it seemed <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>if there were at least one<br/>
powerful organ on which they could rely to<br/>
refute the falsehoods circulated in the press at<br/>
large, and a.cable, followed by a letter, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched</span>, explaining the real state of the<br/>
case. Neither was published. It was a small<br/>
incident but it will not be forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
THE JAPANESE IN HAWAII<br/>
<br/>
It will be a real misfortune to the United States<br/>
if Japanese labor be excluded from Hawaii.<br/>
While the islands constituted an independent<br/>
state, every inducement was held forth to Japanese emigrants to settle there, and the United<br/>
States, when it annexed them in 1898, continued the native policy in this particular. In<br/>
1902, four years after the annexation, out of a<br/>
total of 24,653 laborers on that rich soil, Japan<br/>
stood at the head of the list with 12,080 men;<br/>
the marked increase in the rice crop is chiefly<br/>
due to the Japanese, who introduced the cultivation of upland rice after their own methods.<br/>
Before their time, only swamp rice was grown<br/>
in the islands, and its culture was entirely<br/>
carried on by Chinese. At the end of 1903,<br/>
there were 68,740 Japanese residing in the<br/>
country; (50,341 males, 18,399 females). The<br/>
war' temporarily checked the influx, but during<br/>
the first year after its close, over 18,000 emigrants from Japan landed in the islands. The<br/>
numbers are now well above 100,000, and<br/>
emphatically have they justified the wisdom<br/>
of the United States Government in encourageing the movement. They have proved a real<br/>
benefit to the territory, and, what seems more<br/>
important in the eyes of their own people, they<br/>
are thoroughly happy and prosperous. <span style="color: #ff0000;">They<br/>
</span>represented, eleven years ago, nearly one-fourth<br/>
of the entire population, (24,407 out of 109,020);<br/>
this number has quadrupled, but we have still<br/>
to hear a single complaint against this large,<br/>
<br/>
OUR RELATIONS WITH JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
industrious, law-abiding community which is<br/>
taking American wages for hard work honestly<br/>
done. It is work which the people of our own<br/>
race cannot undertake, on account of the<br/>
climate, and certainly, as far as American<br/>
interests are concerned, it will be a great loss<br/>
if the labor exclusion act be enforced in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
THE JAPANESE IN THE PHILIPPINES<br/>
<br/>
Some nervousness was once shown regarding<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influx </span>of Japanese traders and workers<br/>
into the Philippine Islands. Well-founded<br/>
assertions are powerless to allay nervousness<br/>
if it should ever reach the epidemic stage;<br/>
and I am in a position emphatically to deny the<br/>
rumor that Japan has nefarious designs on the<br/>
Philippines. It will not be the fault of Japan<br/>
if peace is ever broken. In the unthinkable<br/>
event of hostilities breaking out between Japan<br/>
and the United States, it is true that the Philippines might fall a prey to the nearby army<br/>
and navy whose headquarters are almost<br/>
within speaking distance of Manila. But<br/>
to one who has had the privilege of talking<br/>
intimately with the present leaders of Japan,<br/>
the mention of such a war seems as incongruous<br/>
as a divorce clause inserted in a marriage contract.<br/>
<br/>
The sensational talk of some of the American<br/>
newspapers would put America in a ridiculous<br/>
and unworthy light before the world. It would<br/>
be regarded as weakness which would furnish<br/>
fine incitement to aggression did any <span style="color: #0000FF;">intending </span>aggressors <span style="color: #0000FF;">exist</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
</span>The best explanation of the raising of the<br/>
subject at all is offered in an editorial in the<br/>
Japan Mail of February 9th. The writer<br/>
(quoting the Japanese journals) says:<br/>
<br/>
"We have now to abandon the delightful relations <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>mutual trust that used to exist between Japan and the<br/>
United States, and the two friends hitherto so.well assured of each other's good intentions have to fall into line<br/>
with the common herd of nations whose motto is the strong<br/>
man armed keeping his house. The truth is that for<br/>
many years the United States and Japan lived in a kind of<br/>
diplomatic Utopia. The cause was plain. Neither of<br/>
the friends had become a world-power. Both, from their<br/>
high places of peaceful domestic development, looked out<br/>
calmly on the armor-clashing world around them. But<br/>
within a very brief space, both have stepped down into the<br/>
arena, and so they can no longer regard each other with<br/>
quiet eyes of trust and faith. The change was bound <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
</span>come. We may lament it, but we must bow to it."<br/>
<br/>
But it is, of course, unnecessary to destroy<br/>
a mutual trust which has lived for fifty years<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
