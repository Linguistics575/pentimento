<span>ADVENTURES OF DARING PHOTOGRAPHERS<br/>

"After the old bear and cubs had gone, I<br/>
waited for an hour or more, but got no more<br/>
camera shots at grizzlies. Several came, but<br/>
it was so dark that I could not see all their<br/>
actions plainly, and none of them saw <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>to<br/>
run into the thread. Just before I left the<br/>

timber was lit up I saw an old black bear<br/>
running as for dear life. He was, I thought,<br/>
at his best gait before he struck the string, but<br/>
in this I was mistaken; he had only been<br/>
fooling along before. He now let himself out<br/>
and, in less time than it takes to tell it, he had<br/>
vanished from sight and hearing. When this<br/>

not to step in the trail above where the wire<br/>
was placed. This time I selected a spot where<br/>
the trail wound around among some fallen<br/>
timber and where there would not <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>much<br/>
danger of the bears getting the scent of the<br/>
wire until they were right upon it.<br/>
