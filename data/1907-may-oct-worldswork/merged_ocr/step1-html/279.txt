<span>THE STORY OF ENGLAND IN EGYPT<br/>

forwarded to Constantinople in due time.<br/>
It would be quite natural to suppose that<br/>
Major Baring, trained in a school which<br/>
says to a man "'Do this' and he <span style="color: #0000FF;">doeth </span>it,"<br/>
could clear away all this Oriental tape with one<br/>
sweep of his artillery sword. But this he<br/>
could not do, however much his soul may have<br/>
longed for the privilege. He must do his work,<br/>

he would constantly be called upon to adjust<br/>
the relations between the officials and their<br/>
English guardians. Furthermore, a native<br/>

<br/>
</span>but not in his own way; the sensitive pride of<br/>
a suspicious people must not be humiliated.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Khedive must remain the nominal head<br/>
of the Government and all the departments of<br/>

mistake once-but only once.<br/>
