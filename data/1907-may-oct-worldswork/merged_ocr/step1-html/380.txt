without violating every principle of conservative investment. She was told that fact in<br/>
plain English. The safest course seemed<br/>
to be to put the money in a bank where it<br/>
would draw interest, and use it to give the boy<br/>
an education that would <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>him to earn a good<br/>
living for both at the end of five years-when<br/>
he would be eighteen. This could be done<br/>
without using more than half the $ 4,000 that<br/>
was left of the capital. The plan did not<br/>
appeal to the woman. She was determined<br/>
that the money should all be invested, "even<br/>
if I run a great risk of losing it all."<br/>
<br/>
Flatly against the advice of the writer, this<br/>
was done. Since it was determined that it<br/>
should be done, she was advised to sell her<br/>
common stock of the Steel Corporation. The<br/>
proceeds, together with part of the money in<br/>
the bank, were put into the preferred stock of<br/>
the same company. Sixty shares of this<br/>
stock cost, with commissions, $ 3,960, and they<br/>
paid dividends of $ 420 per annum. The<br/>
investor <span style="color: #0000FF;">wen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bark </span>to New Jersey and settled<br/>
down to live on her income, still hoping for<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">best</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Everyone knows how the tide turned. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">divulends </span>have been paid steadily on that<br/>
stock ever since, and at one time the investment was worth over $ 6,750. Last October,<br/>
the writer advised the investor to sell it, and<br/>
put the money into bonds that <span style="color: #ff0000;">wculd </span>give<br/>
her the same revenue; but this she will<br/>
not do. She believes that in the long run<br/>
it will give her back her $ 10,000 of capital.<br/>
Perhaps it will; and perhaps it will not.<br/>
One never can tell what an industrial stock<br/>
will do.<br/>
<br/>
The strange part of this episode is that if<br/>
the woman had been advised to hold her common stock, and spend the money in the bank<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tot </span>living expenses for two years, the advance<br/>
in the common stock would have given her<br/>
back her $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000 </span>in the autumn of 1906, when<br/>
it resumed dividends at the rate of $ 500 per<br/>
year on the shares she owned. On the other<br/>
hand, the more safe and conservative the<br/>
advice she followed, the smaller would be her<br/>
revenue to-day and the smaller her capital.<br/>
That merely means that the year 1904 was a<br/>
period in which it paid to be willing to take<br/>
risks, because all stocks bought in that year<br/>
advanced rapidly in 1905 and 1906.<br/>
<br/>
This story is told at some length because it<br/>
illustrates the extreme difficulty of making<br/>
investments for such investors. To advise<br/>
<br/>
HOW TO INVEST SMALL FUNDS<br/>
<br/>
safely such an investor, the adviser must<br/>
have the following data:<br/>
<br/>
(r) How much capital have you to invest?<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">z</span>) How much revenue do you need to live<br/>
upon?<br/>
<br/>
(3) Are you willing to give up chances of<br/>
large profits in order to obtain safety?<br/>
<br/>
(4) Should your investment be free of taxes<br/>
or not? If it must be free, in what state are<br/>
you taxed?<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>) Must your investment be of such a<br/>
nature that it may be turned into cash at any<br/>
moment?<br/>
<br/>
On the basis of these facts, the banker or<br/>
the private adviser may select for a man or a<br/>
woman the proper kind of an investment.<br/>
Without these facts, it is practically impossible<br/>
for anyone to judge intelligently whether a<br/>
particular investment is suitable for a particular<br/>
investor.<br/>
<br/>
Every investor should come to realize that<br/>
stocks and bonds are not intrinsically equal.<br/>
When the investor has realized that a stock<br/>
that is perfectly suitable as an Investment for<br/>
his landlord, his employer, or any other capitalist, may be full of menace for him, and that<br/>
a bond which may be perfectly suited to him<br/>
may be entirely unsuited to the investment of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>capitalist frien", then he has learned the<br/>
first principle of safe investment. Until he<br/>
does learn this cardinal fact, he will grope in<br/>
the dark. In fact, he may stumble over<br/>
something that will give him a fall severe enough<br/>
to take him entirely out of the investment class.<br/>
<br/>
To make this clear, THE WORLD'S WORK<br/>

'intends to <span style="color: #ff0000;">tal</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>up this subject in full. In<br/>
<br/>
subsequent articles, it will discuss the meaning<br/>
and the bearing of each of the five questions<br/>
which furnish the basis of conservative investment. In the meantime, day by day, the<br/>
Readers' Service is compelled to attempt<br/>
advice to investors who almost without exception <span style="color: #ff0000;">fail </span>to give enough data upon which to form<br/>
a really intelligent opinion. In a great many<br/>
cases, it is necessary to write to the questioner,<br/>
asking for further information about the class<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">investment</span>. Sometimes the letter-head furnishes more assistance to the man who answers<br/>
the questions than the letter itself. Frequently,<br/>
the mourning stationery and the sex of the<br/>
writer afford the clue. Far too often, doubtless, the answer is not as good as it should<br/>
be, because the Readers' Service has guessed<br/>
wrongly as to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cond</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ions </span>that surround the<br/>
