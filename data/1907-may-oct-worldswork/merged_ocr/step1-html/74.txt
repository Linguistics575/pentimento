was <span style="color: #ff0000;">c. </span>in of the realm in America and the only<br/>
standard of barter, fox skin was coin of the<br/>

EXPERIMENTS IN FUR FARMING<br/>
<br/>
The demand for skunk skins, both as<br/>
trimmings and as a staple fur, is universal.<br/>

</span>However desirable it might be for the trapper,<br/>
poison must not be used to take the skunk.<br/>
<br/>
They must be trapped. It will interest the<br/>
public to know that the grease scraped from<br/>
the inside of the skunk pelt is used for soap.<br/>
The pelt itself is deodorized by rolling and<br/>
trampling in mahogany sawdust. It is too<br/>
early yet to predict whether the skunk farms<br/>
of certain Western States will prove profitable<br/>

<br/>
or only a passing experiment, like the beaver<br/>
farming attempted a few years ago north of<br/>
Lake Superior. Over 600,000 skunk skins<br/>
a year come from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio,<br/>
and the group of central northwest states. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In<br/>
</span>fact, all fur farming so far-except blue fox on<br/>
the West Coast, silver on the East Coast, and<br/>
lamb <span style="color: #0000FF;">farming </span>in Persia and Russia, where the<br/>
animals thrive because they are left in their<br/>
natural state-seems foredoomed to failure<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Fur comes to its greatest excellence only<br/>
when the animal has that wide ranging of its<br/>
natural state which ensures robust health.<br/>
Cold weather always deepens and crisps the<br/>
furs, even furs of a warm climate, like the chinchilla. Speaking as a lay observer and not<br/>
as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientist</span>, chinchilla is something of a cross<br/>
between a rabbit and a rat. Owing to its<br/>
delicacy of color and lightness in weight, it will<br/>
