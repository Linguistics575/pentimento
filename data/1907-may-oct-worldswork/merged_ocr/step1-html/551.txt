<span>TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG<br/>
<br/>
importance in my mind with that of thinking<br/>
out my to-morrow's schedule. I will stay and<br/>
potter about little things that do not need<br/>
attention. My sense of balance, of proportion<br/>
and perspective, is gone. I've lost my eye for<br/>
the cash value of <span style="color: #0000FF;">things<br/>
<br/>
</span>A man whose mind is in good condition can<br/>
stand off from his work, look at it in the bulk,<br/>
and say to this item, "You need doing right<br/>
away;" to another, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">You</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'re </span>unimportant, you<br/>
can wait;" and to another, "Somebody else<br/>
can look out for you." No fatigued person can<br/>
see things straight.<br/>
<br/>
And the moral of that is: Don't make any<br/>
important decisions except when your mind<br/>
is fresh.<br/>
<br/>
With the best intentions in the world, many<br/>
men commit an economic sin right here.<br/>
They come to the office in the morning with<br/>
a good bunch of enthusiasm and clear-headedness to their credit. They feel it; and so they<br/>
say: "Come, let us be virtuous. Let us get<br/>
<br/>
TASKS 9349<br/>
rid of these million and one small left-overs.<br/>
That will clear the way for the big matters on the<br/>
docket." There's nothing that uses up nervous<br/>
energy faster than a long series of fussy responsibilities. When it comes time later for the big<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">things-the </span>important decision, the diplomatic<br/>
letter-the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seconscientious </span>spendthrifts have<br/>
neither heart nor head left for them.<br/>
<br/>
The big things should be done first.<br/>
<br/>
Every man at his best is<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>a man of mark, if<br/>
he only knew it. When he is up to his top<br/>
range he is a man with a special power and with<br/>
a special opportunity. It is a pity that he<br/>
should throw away that special power on the<br/>
accomplishment of small, everyday responsibilities that do not need special <span style="color: #0000FF;">power-drudgery </span>that could be put through with equal<br/>
success when the first fine cutting edge of his<br/>
mind was <span style="color: #0000FF;">dulled-for </span>when he has done this<br/>
he has thrown away his special opportunity<br/>
as well. The big thing is the opportunity for<br/>
the big man.<br/>

<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>N <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HEN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Secretary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>, then Solicitor<br/>
General, was named for the Circuit<br/>
Bench, a party of his former classmates gave him a dinner at the Union Club in<br/>
New York. At any momentous turning in the<br/>
road, Taft never fails to come in for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">heart-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">giving </span>God-speed from his old Yale friends,<br/>
and the Union Club dinner was an instance.<br/>
But the affair is mentioned rather because of a<br/>
very significant expectation that then took firm<br/>
hold in the minds of the hosts. They wore<br/>
imbued with the idea that Tait's star was now<br/>
definitely on the rise, and that henceforth<br/>
he would go ahead rapidly, and higher and<br/>
higher, to the very top. Their intuitions were<br/>
Correct. His work as a Federal judge was not<br/>
that which stirs the popular acclaim, but it<br/>
was history-making. And Taft was indeed<br/>
rising fast, even though for the next nine years<br/>
he was pleasantly enchained to the Bench.<br/>
But other friends, less discerning, perceived<br/>
<br/>
only a throwing away of golden opportunities.<br/>
They cited the Solicitor General's renown in<br/>
winning all the big Government cases, which<br/>
renown might now be coined into riches in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">private </span>practice. Law firms guaranteed him<br/>
splendid sums if he would join them as partner.<br/>
But Mr. Taft said very quietly, "There are<br/>
bigger things in the world than money." His<br/>
bent was judicial. He would rather be judge<br/>
than advocate, though one meant only $ 6,000<br/>
a year, and the other at least $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000</span>. He<br/>
left the battleground to others. Besides, he<br/>
was now in the line of succession for the one<br/>
absorbing ambition of his life, the Supreme<br/>
Bench. Accordingly, in March, 1892, at the<br/>
age of <span style="color: #0000FF;">35,116 </span>accepted President Harrison's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">appointment</span>.<br/>
