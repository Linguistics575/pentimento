</span>and work. He has been lucky from the first.<br/>
He was never one to originate opportunities<br/>
for his own advancement. At thirty he was<br/>
a judge on the bench. His tasks came to him.<br/>
We should say then, to be more exact and<br/>
more fair, that prodigious, untiring, effective<br/>
work reinforced luck and created it. And<br/>
with luck thrown in, this made a combination<br/>
not to be beaten by anything short of Fate.<br/>
<br/>
SECRETARY TAFT'S ANCESTRY<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Taft started right. Mirth was the silver<br/>
spoon in his mouth at birth. That happened<br/>
under favorable auspices half a century ago<br/>
in a new and rather exclusive suburb of Cincinnati. The favorable auspices were his<br/>
parents, for he and his two brothers and two<br/>
half-brothers have been cited to prove that<br/>
brains come by inheritance. One of the half<br/>
brothers took the highest honors ever known to<br/>
Yale, and the other married the richest girl<br/>
in Ohio. The father of these five boys was a<br/>
judge and the father's father was a judge,<br/>
and here in the third generation was his son<br/>
to be a judge. The grandfather, Peter Rawson Taft, interpreted the law in the courts of<br/>
Windham County, Vermont, and helped to<br/>
make them in the legislature of that state.<br/>
Behind him ran a line of ancestors to English<br/>
soil. Ahead of him ran his son Alphonso, to<br/>
Ohio. The new and energetic young town of<br/>
Cincinnati was his destination. But, before<br/>
starting West, Alphonso had worked on his<br/>
father's Vermont farm until he was sixteen;<br/>
had taught school to earn money for college;<br/>
had gone to Amherst, then to Yale, graduating<br/>
with high honors in 1833; had tutored there<br/>
while he went through the Yale Law School;<br/>
and at last, in 1838, procured himself a shingle.<br/>
The next year saw it hung up in Cincinnati.<br/>
<br/>
Quaint old Judge Taft, <span style="color: #0000FF;">learned</span>, absentminded, kindly, yet rigorous, as the present<br/>
generation remembers him, was soon one of the<br/>
foremost <span style="color: #0000FF;">citizens </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his adopted state, and an<br/>
especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">useful </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span>. He was insistent on public<br/>
education for that new country. The University of Cincinnati was menaced by an attack on<br/>
the trust fund that supported it, but Alphonso<br/>
Taft saved the fund by his talent before the<br/>
Supreme Court of the United States. He is<br/>
gratefully remembered for that to this day.<br/>
He worked zealously, though quietly, for the<br/>
development of the school system, and was<br/>
himself a trustee of the Woodward High<br/>
School, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">bis </span>boys attended. He was<br/>
<br/>
9139<br/>
<br/>
also the first Yale alumnus to be elected a<br/>
member of the Yale Corporation. He was the<br/>
trial judge to decide against Bibles being used<br/>
in the local public schools, and his dissenting<br/>
opinion became the law as announced by the<br/>
Supreme Court. He perceived that his city's<br/>
future depended on its securing trunk lines to<br/>
the strategic points, and he would not let his<br/>
fellow-citizens doze in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>complacency born of<br/>
the city's material advantages. He labored to<br/>
bring railroads to Cincinnati and he served on<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">directorate </span>or as counsel. He was<br/>
appointed, then elected by all parties, Judge<br/>
of the Superior Court of Cincinnati. Ten<br/>
years later Grant made him Secretary of War,<br/>
then Attorney-General, after which he was our<br/>
Minister to Austria, and next to Russia.<br/>
<br/>
The above items all indicate that William<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s father had brains, but a more convincing<br/>
fact is that he learned the German language<br/>
after he had passed his seventieth year. His<br/>
was then the ideal old age of the scholar.<br/>
They say of him that "he was a man of imposing personal presence, dignity, and refinement";<br/>
that "he was unostentatious, kindly, and gentle,<br/>
yet of a strong and forcible character which<br/>
won for him respect, confidence, and love."<br/>
<br/>
Young Taft was no less lucky as to his<br/>
mother, She, also, came of hardy, Colonial<br/>
stock, and there was an ancestor colonel who<br/>
did the conventional thing with his regiment<br/>
at the battle of Saratoga. Mrs. Taft is living<br/>
yet, at the age of eighty, and with her vigor<br/>
of intellect remains a comforting counselor<br/>
of her son in the momentous decisions of his<br/>
life. Her ambition for him is his own-a seat<br/>
on the Supreme Bench of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
SECRETARY TAFT AS A CHILD<br/>
<br/>
But William Howard Taft did not leave<br/>
matters to luck. Opportunities were very<br/>
small at first, being only those that confront<br/>
childhood. A roundish, roly-poly, little chap,<br/>
he went at the great sealed universe of knowledge with a grave earnestness and a big-eyed<br/>
curiosity. His brothers were bright above<br/>
the average. His neighborhood playmates<br/>
have many of them since attained honorable<br/>
distinction. In the old Mt. Auburn days-Mt. Auburn was the name of the suburb<br/>
where they lived-it became tacitly agreed,<br/>
even then, and by old Judge Taft the most<br/>
confidently, that Will was the heir apparent in<br/>
that Court of Boyville. He was a goodnatured hulk, with bones too big for him, who<br/>
