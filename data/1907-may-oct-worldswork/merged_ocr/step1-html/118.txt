</span>Armstrong, say: "It is too bad! I like that<br/>
boy's face; he has an honest look.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>"What do you propose to do?<span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>asked me.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that I had come to stay and that<br/>
I thought, with a week's preparation, I would<br/>
be able to pass the entrance examination. He<br/>
asked if I were afraid of hard work. I assured him I was not and that I had worked hard<br/>
all my life. An arrangement was then made<br/>
by which I was assigned to the sawmill. I had<br/>
worked at a sawmill before and had a good<br/>
general knowledge of lumber, but this mill was<br/>
on a larger scale than any I had ever seen.<br/>
I was put under the charge of Edward R.<br/>
Jackson, whom the boys called "Big Jack"<br/>
because he had a smaller brother in school.<br/>
He was to instruct me in Hampton's methods<br/>
of grading and piling lumber. On the second<br/>
afternoon, while working in the lumber yard<br/>
with "Big Jack," who is now the pastor of a<br/>
large church in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Frissell,<br/>
who was then Chaplain, passed along. He<br/>
asked if I were happy at Hampton and whether<br/>
I liked the place. His inquiries about my<br/>
home and people, his kindly expressed wish<br/>
that I would have a successful time at Hampton,<br/>
and his assurance that I was in the midst of<br/>
friends, gave me a great deal of hope and<br/>
courage. That afternoon was the only time<br/>
during my four years at Hampton that I experienced any real <span style="color: #0000FF;">homesickness</span>. A few days<br/>
later, I was put on a raft of logs, to get off the<br/>
chains. I got many a salt-water bath and was<br/>
thoroughly convinced that sea-water was really<br/>
salty. I soon learned to keep on the right side<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">logs-as </span>well as of the boss.<br/>
<br/>
On my first Sunday night at Hampton, 600<br/>
students were assembled, Negroes and Indians<br/>
and whites, and they sang plantation songs<br/>
such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>had heard all my life. It seemed to<br/>
me I had never heard music quite so sweet,<br/>
but notwithstanding the joy I felt at being a<br/>
student in such an institution, I was utterly<br/>
disgusted to hear these songs in a school. I<br/>
supposed that at Hampton we were to sing<br/>
white people's songs and I had come to school<br/>
to learn to sing and to speak and to do everything just like white people. I did not hesitate<br/>
to express my opinion to some of my newly<br/>
made friends after the service. Most of the<br/>
new boys agreed with me, but some of the<br/>
older students argued that if the songs were<br/>
beautiful and people enjoyed them, why<br/>
shouldn't we sing them? The only reply that<br/>
<br/>
A NEGRO'S <span style="color: #ff0000;">UPHILL </span>CLIMB<br/>
<br/>
I could give was that they were Negro songs<br/>
and we had come to school to learn something<br/>
better. And, too, I objected to exhibiting the<br/>
religious and emotional side of our nature to<br/>
white people, for I supposed that the whites<br/>
listened to these Negro songs simply for the<br/>
amusement they afforded. A few Sunday<br/>
evenings later, General Armstrong spoke to the<br/>
students about respecting <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span>--their<br/>
race, their history, their songs, and their folklore generally. He spoke of the songs as a<br/>
priceless legacy which Negroes ought to cherish.<br/>
While I was not entirely convinced, I was led<br/>
to think along a little different line. It was<br/>
the first time I had ever given serious thought<br/>
to anything distinctly Negro. This also was<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>time in my life that <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ever </span>saw anything<br/>
about my race of which I should be proud.<br/>
<br/>
My work at the sawmill was hard and<br/>
difficult, but we had a <span style="color: #ff0000;">greatdealof </span>real pleasure.<br/>
I learned a great many things, especially about<br/>
lumber and machinery. I learned to fire the<br/>
huge boilers, to run the Corliss engine, much<br/>
about steam-fitting, and also some carpenter<br/>
work. The record of what the twenty boys<br/>
who worked with me have done for their people<br/>
since leaving Hampton Institute would be<br/>
interesting reading. Mr. Westwood, the foreman of the mill, who had been an officer in the<br/>
Confederate army, was as strict as he was kind;<br/>
even to this day he takes a personal interest in<br/>
all of the young men who came under his instruction. He used to call me "Major" even<br/>
then, and often told me that I would be Major<br/>
some day at Hampton.<br/>
<br/>
I worked at the mill until October, 1886,<br/>
when I entered the day school. I had the<br/>
choice between entering the highest class in the<br/>
Junior grade or the lowest class in the Middle<br/>
year, but I preferred the highest Junior grade<br/>
to the lowest Middle, much to the satisfaction<br/>
of my teachers. I knew my deficiency in<br/>
English especially, and felt that if I missed the<br/>
Junior training I should be handicapped for<br/>
the rest of my course. I was made an officer in<br/>
the battalion and janitor of one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dormitories</span>, being responsible to the Commandant<br/>
for the care of the building, as well as for the<br/>
conduct of the young men.<br/>
<br/>
During my year as a work student, I was<br/>
constantly learning new things, in the drill, in<br/>
the care of my room, in the sawmill, in the<br/>
night school, and in things in general. It was<br/>
a year of general initiation into an entirely new<br/>
life-new people, different races, new standards,<br/>
<br/>
