<span>JAPAN'S WAR TAX AND POVERTY<br/>
<br/>
sold in little square wooden cups makes them<br/>
forget the toils of the day. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>winter they drink<br/>
"white horse," a very cheap sake, and in summer when their thirst is great they satisfy it<br/>
with shochu, a fiery liquor made from the dregs<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sake </span>breweries.<br/>
<br/>
After a time Taki left the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wharves </span>and markets and found employment with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lender of<br/>
quilts who lived in Shin Ami Cho (street) in the<br/>
Shiba quarter. It was getting on in the winter,<br/>
and his duties consisted of keeping track of the<br/>
quilts rented to the poor and collecting payment.<br/>
For this he received seven cents a day and his<br/>
food. In this one street there were seven quilt<br/>
lenders who supplied the 350 houses. The<br/>
poor cannot afford to own quilts, but when the<br/>
cold becomes intense they rent coverings made<br/>
of rags sewn together, which can be had as low<br/>
as one-half cent a night. In the nipping winter<br/>
air, an entire family will huddle under <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">single<br/>
</span>flimsy quilt. The rent must be paid before <span style="color: #0000FF;">midnight</span>. If not paid, the collector takes the quilt<br/>
and leaves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfortunate </span>shivering. Taki,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>had charged machine guns, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>veritable coward when it came to depriving<br/>
the poor of their quilts. Many times he<br/>
went away leaving a penniless mother with her<br/>
children in possession of a quilt they could not<br/>
pay for and turned in his own money instead.<br/>
Sometimes the <span style="color: #0000FF;">miserable </span>would take a rented<br/>
quilt and pawn it. A collection of rags that<br/>
rented for a penny a night would bring <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>cents<br/>
at a pawn shop and then, reckless of <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequences</span>, a family would dine. The quilt merchant<br/>
was relentless in such cases and the head of the<br/>
family was invariably arrested and imprisoned.<br/>
<br/>
A HOME WITH THE HOMELESS<br/>
<br/>
Taki hated his occupation; he began to think<br/>
better of the fat and prosperous'rickshaw men<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hangers-on </span>of the yoshiwara district, who<br/>
lived off the outcasts and tips from revellers.<br/>
Once he had esteemed them as the lowest scum<br/>
of Tokyo, but now he felt that he was in an even<br/>
lower station. He incurred the dislike of his<br/>
employer by interceding for patrons who were<br/>
unable to pay quilt rent and was discharged in<br/>
January. He went forth <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dreary, drizzling<br/>
day. With his few remaining sen he sought<br/>
a night's refuge in a cheap lodging house where<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mendicants</span>, beggars, <span style="color: #0000FF;">paupers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the homeless<br/>
crowd together in the midst of filth and insects<br/>
for a penny a night. He was so overrun with<br/>
vermin that sleep was impossible, and he left<br/>
the horrible den early in the morning and as a<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9341<br/>
<br/>
</span>last resort endeavored to find a comrade who<br/>
occupied one of the little habitations of three<br/>
mats' area which, like rows of dry-goods boxes,<br/>
filled the street. After a long search he found<br/>
his friend sick at home and suffering deplorably<br/>
from hunger and lack of medicine. The house<br/>
was so small that the household work was done<br/>
outside, yet the rent was three cents a day.<br/>
When the family of five slept they were crowded<br/>
on the three mats which covered the floor. The<br/>
sick soldier declared that if he could earn five <span style="color: #0000FF;">dollars </span>a month he could live and support his family.<br/>
To be sure they could have no amusements,<br/>
could buy no new clothing, and would have to<br/>
subsist on fish offal, bad fruit, and spoiled rice,<br/>
but they would have a roof over their heads.<br/>
<br/>
Taki had come with the intention of borrowing, but went away regretting that he had<br/>
not been able to lend. He walked blindly<br/>
through the fog, hungry and heartbroken; a dog,<br/>
he thought, fared better than a veteran soldier.<br/>
As he turned a corner a carriage bearing a rich<br/>
nobleman came at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>rapid pace from the Maple<br/>
Club. Taki walked directly before the horses<br/>
and was run down. He died in a little shop<br/>
near by in a few moments, and the newspaper<br/>
which chronicled his end quoted his last words.<br/>
They were:<br/>
<br/>
"Honorable countrymen, I give my life to<br/>
great Japan. May Heaven bless and preserve<br/>
our illustrious ruler. I go, a soldier, to, join<br/>
my warrior ancestors."<br/>
<br/>
With his last words Taki expressed the<br/>
dominant spirit of Japan. Suffer as they will,<br/>
object to the rise of the moneyed aristocracy,<br/>
grumble over taxes, work for preposterous<br/>
wages, they are loyal. The worst grumblers<br/>
are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first'to </span>insist upon war when the nation's<br/>
honor has been called into question. In the<br/>
slums of Tokyo one can hear as revolutionary<br/>
expressions of opinion as in Paris, but they are<br/>
not really meant. The average citizen realises<br/>
that Japan, having stepped into the arena,<br/>
cannot withdraw without losing everything<br/>
that it now holds dear. Therefore he is<br/>
steadfast in his patriotism, saying always as do<br/>
the story tellers in the Tokyo streets<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"When<br/>
the Emperor and his soldiers have finished with<br/>
the foreigners, he will make Japan an earthly<br/>
paradise with their wealth."<br/>
<br/>
And the Government says officially: "Although the national burden was rendered very<br/>
heavy by the increase in taxation, such was the<br/>
loyalty and patriotism of the whole nation that<br/>
no trouble whatever was experienced,"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
