</span>THE FUTURE OF CUBA<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">WITHIN </span>the last nine years, American<br/>
and British capital to the extent of more<br/>
than $ 300,000,000 has <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowed </span>into Cuba. The<br/>
movement appears to be in equilibrium at the<br/>
present moment, having been checked sharply<br/>
by the late insurrection. That it will resume<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MARCH<br/>
<br/>
</span>OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
within the next year or so is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confident </span>hope<br/>
of those daring capitalists <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>have already<br/>
broken the field. If it does resume, and if it<br/>
continues uninterrupted for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">spa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ce </span>of a few<br/>
years, the future of Cuba is assured. It will<br/>
become a highly important commercial factor<br/>
in the world, in a sense in which it has never<br/>
had a right to be so considered hitherto. The<br/>
two "if's" at the beginning of this sentence<br/>
might seem sufficient qualification of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>roseate<br/>
forecast for Cuba, yet they are but a part of<br/>
the limitations that beset the student who tries<br/>
to understand the position of that island.<br/>
<br/>
To-day the United States has a provisional<br/>
government in the island, and all is <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the surface. Beneath the surface, the<br/>
Cubans and the financial powers that advanced<br/>
that $ 300,000,000 of capital are exerting<br/>
influences that may make or mar the coming<br/>
days in Cuba. The capitalists, of course,<br/>
want the provisional government to last forever. The Cubans want it to last only long<br/>
enough to give the Cuban government the<br/>
power to cope with and regulate the capitalistic power in Cuba in such a way that the<br/>
island will remain the birthright <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Cubans.<br/>
The two aims are so entirely opposed that no<br/>
man may see the <span style="color: #0000FF;">final </span>result.<br/>
<br/>
By maintaining the "army of pacification"<br/>
in Cuba, the Government of the United States<br/>
is playing into the hands of the capitalists,<br/>
but at the same time it seems to be doing the<br/>
right thing for the Cubans themselves. Probably there will come a time when our Government must ask itself whether a continued<br/>
occupation would not be more for the capitalists<br/>
than for the Cubans. That time may not come<br/>
before the same question has to be answered<br/>
in respect to Britain in Egypt, but it may come<br/>
much earlier. In fact, the less responsible<br/>
element in Cuba is asking it <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day</span>, just as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>"Nationalists" are asking the similar<br/>
question in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, the one happy conclusion that<br/>
seems inevitable is that Cuba will not be allowed to lapse into anarchy, nor to acquire the<br/>
weakness for chronic and dangerous revolution<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">afflicts </span>the republics of South America.<br/>
If the Cuban Government is not strong enough<br/>
to hold the country, the United States must<br/>
always stand ready to step in. If the Cuban<br/>
Government really gets that strength, the<br/>
United States should be ready to step out.<br/>
Of course, capital could stir up a revolution<br/>
of some sort if it were necessary, but such<br/>
<br/>
