year shows an increase over the year preceding. At the same time, the patronage of<br/>
the three or four leading universities of the<br/>
Middle West is no longer local but truly<br/>
national.<br/>
<br/>
The enrollment of several Eastern universities is gradually assuming an international<br/>
aspect. Most "foreign" students come from<br/>
the neighboring countries of North America,<br/>
but the attendance from Asia increases, China<br/>
<br/>
and India having lately joined Japan in <span style="color: #0000FF;">send- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">V<br/>
<br/>
</span>ing a number of young men to our institutions.<br/>
England, Germany, and France all send good<br/>
delegations. In fact, every important nation<br/>
of Europe is represented. One hundred and<br/>
sixty-four European students were enrolled last<br/>
year at our six leading Eastern institutions.<br/>
South America sends us few, but during the<br/>
past year the number from this continent has<br/>
nearly doubled. The majority of those who<br/>
come from Europe and the countries to the<br/>
south of us are attracted by our technological<br/>
schools, while the Japanese show a particular<br/>
fondness for political science. Our professional schools of medicine and dentistry also<br/>
attract many foreigners.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most encouraging facts about the<br/>
gains in college attendance is that it has come<br/>
in spite of higher requirements for admission<br/>
and advancement. The practice of demanding a baccalaureate degree for admission to<br/>
professional schools is making only slow headway, but the so-called "combined course"<br/>
plan, whereby a student is enabled to earn both<br/>
his baccalaureate and his professional degree<br/>
in five or six years, is gaining new adherents<br/>
every year. Harvard has been a pioneer in<br/>
establishing high standards for admission to<br/>
professional study; its schools of law, medicine,<br/>
and theology have been conducted on a graduate<br/>
basis for several years, and the school of applied<br/>
science was added to this list last fall-the first<br/>
American school of technology to be placed<br/>
on that basis.<br/>
<br/>
The male attendance in the academic de<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">partments </span>of our universities has suffered at<br/>
the hands of the scientific and technological<br/>
schools, for the greatest gain is in these latter.<br/>
The number of women attending our higher<br/>
institutions is continually on the increase,<br/>
especially at the Western universities, where<br/>
they frequently outnumber the men in the<br/>

THE MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
academic department. The number of students of pedagogy is growing rapidly, "education" having won quite general recognition as<br/>
a legitimate university study. The enrollment<br/>
of the theological faculties tends to remain low,<br/>
but such studies as agriculture and forestry<br/>
show a gain in popularity.<br/>
<br/>
Two of the most recent additions to university<br/>
activity are the summer session and "<span style="color: #0000FF;">extension</span>"<br/>
teaching. The remarkable growth of the<br/>
Columbia summer session, which in its eighth<br/>
year attracted almost 1,500 students, is worthy<br/>
of notice, and there are several other institutions<br/>
where an almost equally rapid growth has been<br/>
experienced. At several universities-notably<br/>
Chicago, Columbia, and Pennsylvania-a series<br/>
of so-called "extension" courses gives teachers<br/>
an opportunity to continue the work of the<br/>
summer at convenient hours-Saturday forenoons, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">example-during </span>the regular term.<br/>
These departments have lately taken the step<br/>
of utilizing also the early evening hours, the<br/>
innovation having met with an immediate<br/>
response wherever it has been introduced. The<br/>
field of extension teaching has vast possibilities,<br/>
especially in thickly settled communities.<br/>

PROGRESS TOWARD UNIVERSAL PEACE<br/>
<br/>
HE advocates of peace who loudly express<br/>
their disappointment in the "inaction"<br/>
of the Hague Conference overlook the fact<br/>
that its delegates represent governments, not<br/>
peace societies. It is one thing for a company<br/>
of men and women-all of the same opinion--to come together and resolve that war is a<br/>
terrible evil and that every sword should be<br/>
turned into a pruning-hook. It is quite another thing for an international delegation of<br/>
diplomats-speaking different languages, holding widely different personal opinions, and<br/>
some representing nations whose policies are<br/>
directly or indirectly opposed to universal peace<br/>
--to bring conflicting views into harmony.<br/>
<br/>
The leaders of this Conference are practical<br/>
men and do not expect to remove, by a rising<br/>
vote, all possibility of future war. Their<br/>
energies have been directed toward the prevention of preventable wars and toward the<br/>
alleviation of the terrors of inevitable wars.<br/>
The very fact that the delegation is mainly<br/>
made up of international lawyers rather than<br/>
of diplomats (as was the first Conference) shows<br/>
that the peace movement has at last reached<br/>
the practical stage; the Powers are trying to<br/>
find a way to do what the peace <span style="color: #ff0000;">societies<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
