<span>AN UNCTUOUS<br/>
<br/>
A chapter of the report begins in this way<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"The best crop raised on the farm is the boy and girl.<br/>
The Winnebago County Farmer Boy's Experiment Club<br/>
was organized Feb. 22, 1902. It now has a membership<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">500</span>. The Girls' Home Culture Club was <span style="color: #0000FF;">organized<br/>
</span>two years later. It now has a membership of 300.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>Then follow suggestions of means of interesting the boys and girls in farm life; stories are<br/>
told of prize competitions in farm tasks; a<br/>
poem, "The Boy With the Hoe," clinches the<br/>
argument for these competitions; needle-work<br/>
tests and bread-making tests are described<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>There is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chapter on manual training, others<br/>
on books and pictures, traveling libraries, and<br/>
the consolidation of country schools. The<br/>
few tables of statistics are carefully scattered<br/>
through the book, far enough apart never to<br/>
be tiresome. But pictures are everywhere,<br/>
and all through the report are lively <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparisons</span>, and crisp sentences in the vernacular.<br/>
One lays down this handsome little book with<br/>
the wish that half the fiction of the day were<br/>
done as well. It presents a living story of<br/>
cheerful, vigorous real men and women teaching real boys and girls to do and to think.<br/>
And it is a lesson in the art of presenting living<br/>
facts that other public servants may <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit </span>by.<br/>
<br/>
FOOTBALL HEROES AND EXAMINATION HEROES<br/>
<br/>
HEN President Eliot, of Harvard <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uni<br/>
</span>versity, declares that sports which require <span style="color: #0000FF;">leg-padding </span>and face-guards and the<br/>
like have no place in educational activities,<br/>
doubtless he seems to a strenuous generation<br/>
to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">speaking </span>a soft, degenerate language.<br/>
For, if this be true, how very far from a proper<br/>
training of youth have we wandered these<br/>
twenty years or more!<br/>
<br/>
Yet the wonder is, to well-balanced men,<br/>
that Mr. Eliot and others in similar authority<br/>
have been so slow to tell the plain truth about<br/>
the abuse of "athletics" in college life. Perhaps we had to run this cycle of silliness to<br/>
have done with it. But these signs of recovery<br/>
are grateful.<br/>
<br/>
It is a simple matter to think clearly about,<br/>
difficult as it has been to act <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanely</span>. Nobody<br/>
wants boys to grow up as "<span style="color: #0000FF;">mollycoddler</span>" Nobody objects to sports; for sports have brought<br/>
a most wholesome change from the old selfconscious type of pale college students. The<br/>
"grind" is an unlovely creature, as the football brute is. And even sports that involve<br/>
danger are desirable.<br/>
<br/>
But the harm has come in the attitude to<br/>
<br/>
JUNE <span style="color: #0000FF;">INDUSTRY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9059<br/>
</span>life and in the conception of training that the<br/>
prevalent view of football has brought. For<br/>
the exaggerated intercollegiate contests have<br/>
not encouraged athletics. They have had as<br/>
little to do with any sane system or conception<br/>
of athletics as they have had to do with<br/>
scholarship. They have made heroes of the<br/>
wrong kind of youth.<br/>
<br/>
It is not perfectly clear that we need heroes<br/>
at all in our college life; and, when we recover<br/>
from examinations as a method of selecting<br/>
heroes of scholarship and from football as a<br/>
test of heroes of the undergraduate world, our<br/>
colleges will the better have in hand the perfectly plain task of training boys by normal<br/>
methods-that is, by steady, well-ordered<br/>
work, body, mind, and character. We shall<br/>
then have college youth with as little selfconsciousness as possible. It is doubtful<br/>
whether the colleges where football and examinations are the chief tests of manliness and<br/>
of scholarship are doing their tasks. The<br/>
Roman gladiator and the mediaeval priest<br/>
excelled us at both these exaggerated and<br/>
unbalanced activities.<br/>
<br/>
AN UNCTUOUS JUNE INDUSTRY<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">HIS </span>is the time of year when the giving <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>honorary degrees becomes an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unctuous<br/>
</span>industry. A proper recognition of scholarship<br/>
or of distinguished public service when well<br/>
and sparingly bestowed, the honorary degree<br/>
has become in the hands of most American<br/>
colleges a farce that persists by vanity and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flattery</span>. Are you a rich <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>moderately<br/>
rich man, just rich enough to give promise of<br/>
becoming richer a few years hence? If you<br/>
are, you may have to defend yourself against<br/>
an aggressive LL. D. If you are already very<br/>
rich, you are safe; for the hint would then be<br/>
too bald and bold. Are you a popular preacher<br/>
whom parents consult about the education of<br/>
their sons? If you are, a D. D. will get you,<br/>
if not this year, then the next, or the next.<br/>
Are you a college president, however humble,<br/>
or a professor who has edited a series of textbooks? Then the rules of the union demand<br/>
your decoration. The tailors who make (and<br/>
rent) academic gowns have had a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperous<br/>
</span>season; and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">monohippic </span>game goes sol<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">emnly </span>on, as if all the world did not smile at<br/>
it. How the D. D.'s and the LL. D.'s can<br/>
look each other in the face and remain grave<br/>
is a wonder; for these honorary distinctions<br/>
are no longer taken seriously by the public.<br/>
