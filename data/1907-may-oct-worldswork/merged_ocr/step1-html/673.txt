</span>south of Mason and Dixon's line which have<br/>
been declared eligible under the provisions of<br/>
the Carnegie Foundation. Its executive head<br/>
is President William G. Tight, an energetic<br/>
educator who came originally from Ohio. Dr.<br/>
Tight is a prominent geologist and geographer<br/>
and was recently president of the Cordilleran<br/>
section of the Geological Society of America.<br/>
His originality made a practical and artistic use<br/>
of his research work when he conceived this<br/>
pueblo idea.<br/>
<br/>
The largest of the new buildings already completed, the women's dormitory, is called "Hoko-na" <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Butterfly"), the Sikyatki symbol<br/>
for maiden. The men's dormitory, a trifle<br/>
smaller than the other, is called "kwa-ta-ka"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Man-eagle</span>"), after a legendary monster who<br/>
lived in the sky and harried the people of Siky<br/>
atki until their <span style="color: #0000FF;">war-god </span>killed it. On the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>of the buildings have been painted conventionalized likenesses of "Ho-ko-na" and<br/>
"kwa-ta-ka," copied from the mural decorations which once adorned the walls of Sikyatki<br/>
and from designs on pottery dug up from its<br/>
ruins.<br/>
<br/>
Each building is equipped with electric lights<br/>
and all modern conveniences, has commodious<br/>
suites, and is provided with furniture and interior fittings carrying out the Indian idea as far<br/>
as possible. The dormitories are strongly built<br/>
of brick and covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>coat of rough <span style="color: #0000FF;">cement </span>that exactly counterfeits the stone-adobe<br/>
construction of the original pueblos. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bricks<br/>
<br/>
</span>made of adobe or sun-dried mud, as well as<br/>
stone blocks, were used by the inhabitants of<br/>
Sikyatki and their neighbors<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
