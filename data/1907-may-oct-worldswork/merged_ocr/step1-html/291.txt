<span>A LIGHTHOUSE<br/>
<br/>
hoping to get a bid in competition with others<br/>
for that light.<br/>
<br/>
"I left Washington immediately after <span style="color: #0000FF;">presenting </span>this petition to Congress, as I considered<br/>
my work done, and I supposed Mr. Millis<br/>
would forward the matter. Mr. Millis then<br/>
went to Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, who<br/>
told me that Mr. Millis said that the Government could build this lighthouse for $ 80,000;<br/>
Mr. Lodge said of course they couldn't make<br/>
the appropriation any larger than Mr. Millis<br/>
asked, and so the bill was reduced and passed<br/>
Congress for that amount.<br/>
<br/>
"Mr. Millis then said:'We have not<br/>
sufficient money to build a lighthouse; therefore, we will build a lightship, experimentally,<br/>
and see if it will stand.' The lightship was<br/>
built, and I was thereby cut off from building<br/>
my structure.<br/>
<br/>
"I then presented a letter to Senator Frye,<br/>
signed by leading commercial men, saying that<br/>
a lightship was not satisfactory and that a lighthouse should be built there. When it was put<br/>
before the Senate, the Lighthouse Board and<br/>
the Engineering Secretary stated that the<br/>
channel at Pollock Rip was continually shifting<br/>
and that a lighthouse would do more harm than<br/>
good to navigation.<br/>
<br/>
"I then said;<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Is </span>there any other place on<br/>
the coast where this light would fit?' The<br/>
Engineering Secretary answered that he knew<br/>
of none. Senator Mallory, of Florida, who<br/>
was on the Committee at that time, then stepped<br/>
up to me and said:'It would be worth a<br/>
million dollars to the United States if you could<br/>
put that light at Cape Hatteras.' I then<br/>
changed my bill for Hatteras, and perhaps this<br/>
would substantiate my claim of good faith, as<br/>
is questioned in the letter.<br/>
<br/>
"I plainly remember, while on this work,<br/>
my first meeting with Senator Hoar. Evidently<br/>
he knew me, for he held out his hand and, with<br/>
a smile, said:'Captain, I am glad to meet you.<br/>
I hear you are making an attempt, under very<br/>
unfavorable circumstances, to do what I consider a great public work, and you shall have<br/>
my assistance in every way in which I can help<br/>
you. I met Engineer Eads when he considered<br/>
he had failed with Congress in his attempts<br/>
on the Mississippi River jetty system. I<br/>
think this is a similar instance, and there is a<br/>
great similarity in the names Eads and Eells.'<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>that time on, he gave me all the assistance<br/>
that he possibly could. He wrote letters and<br/>
talked with different members and would stop<br/>
<br/>
FOR HATTERAS 9089<br/>
his work whenever I stepped in to see him. He<br/>
not only made addresses in favor of the bill in<br/>
the Senate, but also went over to the House and<br/>
introduced me to many of the members. Among<br/>
them was Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lovering</span>, of Massachusetts, who<br/>
also worked well for the bill. Mr. Small, of<br/>
North Carolina, in whose district this lighthouse comes, also personally sought me out<br/>
and offered his assistance and said he would<br/>
do all in his power to help me, and he gave<br/>
valuable time in behalf of this project. Many<br/>
times he has left his home and gone to<br/>
Washington to attend to this bill. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heintroduced </span>it in his own name in the House and<br/>
has done all in his power to see the project<br/>
carried to completion.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECT APPEAL TO CONGRESS<br/>
<br/>
"After being blocked with the Pollock Rip<br/>
bill, I saw there was no other way except to<br/>
appeal to Congress to contract direct with me,<br/>
and I put in a bill to that effect. It came very<br/>
near passing in 1903, but there was some<br/>
trouble between the two parties and all private<br/>
bills failed to pass, mine among the others.<br/>
<br/>
"The next year, 1904, my bill passed; but<br/>
at the last moment a clause was put in which<br/>
required the approval of the Lighthouse<br/>
Board, and so brought us in with the engineers<br/>
again. It appeared to me that they were<br/>
determined to prevent any effort in the movement that I might make to commence this<br/>
work on the Diamond Shoals Lighthouse.<br/>
Although they had made an effort to do this<br/>
thing themselves and their plans had failed,<br/>
they seemed to be bound that no one else should<br/>
make the attempt.<br/>
<br/>
"I followed this bill very closely and called<br/>
it to the attention of the different members.<br/>
It received a unanimous vote in the Senate, and<br/>
finally passed the House with a great majority,<br/>
with an appropriation of $ 590,000.<br/>
<br/>
"I was forced to accept this bill as <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfactory</span>, although the appropriation was not<br/>
sufficient and the clause in regard to the Engineering Board was a continuance of the hindrance that had fought against me so long.<br/>
However, I sent to the Engineering Board and<br/>
asked what I should do in preparation of plans<br/>
that would be satisfactory, and I sent a drawing<br/>
of a foundation for the lighthouse to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Secretary </span>of Commerce and Labor. That drawing<br/>
had the endorsement of Mr. L. L. Buck, Chief<br/>
Engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, the Merritt<br/>
Wrecking Company, and the Newport News<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
