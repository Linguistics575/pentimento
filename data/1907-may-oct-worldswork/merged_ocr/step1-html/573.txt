<span>AMATEUR HAND CRAFTS THAT PAY<br/>
<br/>
sounds attractive, indeed fairly feasible; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>would it not be a lonesome occupation if <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>devoted all my time to it?" Not necessarily.<br/>
Craftsmen can get together in groups; in fact,<br/>
it is advisable that they should. Within a<br/>
few miles from the study where this article is<br/>
written, there are two such colonies, and very<br/>
jolly they are. But we are not discussing<br/>
your making a profession of artistic handiwork<br/>
just now. Nobody would advise your considering that <span style="color: #0000FF;">off-hand</span>. You must first prove<br/>
your fitness, taking up the work as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">pastimethe </span>sort of pastime that can be made, provided<br/>
you are good at it, to pay for itself. The dash<br/>
for liberty will come later, much later, if at all.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose, now, that you are convinced that<br/>
you possess ability and would like to teach your<br/>
hands to amuse your leisure while augmenting your income: how shall you make a <span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning</span>? First by telling yourself that mere<br/>
dabbling will not do. With a whole army of<br/>
trained workmen already in the field, there is<br/>
no room for "putterers." You must master<br/>
your trade, not "fool" with it. The "how-to"<br/>
books will give you rudimentary instruction,<br/>
teachers will elaborate it, and practice will<br/>
show you how best to apply it. Then will<br/>
come your most serious problem-the problem<br/>
of designing. Mere slavish copying brings<br/>
little pay and less fun; you must learn to<br/>
express your own individual ideas and to do<br/>
so without violence to law and form. The<br/>
principles of designing are known, and you<br/>
must learn them-sufficiently, at least, to<br/>
adapt other people's designs to your own purposes. Ten years ago-even five years ago--out-and-out crankiness was thought artistic,<br/>
but the folly of all that has begun to declare<br/>
itself. So has the folly of much that has been<br/>
written by sentimentalists about "sympathy,"<br/>
"atmosphere," and <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the right feeling." To the<br/>
Greeks foolishness and to the plain man <span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">guff</span>,"<br/>
it is going its way. To-day there is a strong<br/>
reaction toward the reasonable designs that<br/>
depend upon sheer beauty and grace and<br/>
elegance for their charm and not upon wild<br/>
whimsicality. So also as regards execution.<br/>
When the movement was new, it sought to<br/>
show by all tokens that its products were handmade. That is why it loved lop-sided ovals<br/>
and deformed squares, while detesting the perfect forms that suggested the product of the<br/>
machine. Thus it imagined that it was catching the spirit of the old-time artisans, whose<br/>
work so often lacked geometrical precision.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">937I<br/>
<br/>
</span>ll knows better now. It realizes that when<br/>
those antique workmen set out to make <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>thing round they made it as round as they<br/>
could, and that when they set out to make<br/>
a thing square, they made it as square as they<br/>
could. Slight inaccuracies resulted, but were<br/>
never aimed at. They were as little prized as<br/>
foolishness and crankiness of design.<br/>
<br/>
But, once you have mastered the theory and<br/>
practice of your craft, how are you to get your<br/>
goods to market? Quite easily. You may<br/>
join a Society of Arts and Crafts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">send </span>them<br/>
your work, let them pass judgment upon it,<br/>
and, if they think it worthy a place in their<br/>
shop, let them sell it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the sale of your handiwork, you<br/>
will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>still another source of revenue. You<br/>
can teach. Instruction in all sorts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">handicrafts </span>is at present in keen demand. People<br/>
are even devoting their entire time to it, here<br/>
and there, though the better way, from the<br/>
practical standpoint, is to teach part of the<br/>
while and make beautiful things yourself the<br/>
rest of the while. Otherwise you get curiously<br/>
theoretical and lose the very qualities that<br/>
would fit you to develop the talent of your<br/>
pupils.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, now, that the handicraft movement<br/>
has outgrown-or is rapidly outgrowing-its<br/>
early eccentricities and weaknesses; granted<br/>
that is is already a sound business proposition,<br/>
inviting recruits wherever people want a<br/>
pleasant and restful way of turning their<br/>
leisure to remunerative account; granted also<br/>
that talent plus training and industry can thereby win a livelihood-what, one can hardly<br/>
fail to ask, is the future of the movement?<br/>
Is it more than a passing enthusiasm? Can<br/>
you be sure, if you enter its army of workers,<br/>
that you will find a market for your wares ten<br/>
or twenty years hence?<br/>
<br/>
Reasonable questions, these. Nobody in<br/>
his senses will think of espousing the cause of<br/>
any form of art purely for sake of gain. People<br/>
who do so come to grief. William Morris<br/>
spoke as a practical man when he said, "Art<br/>
is the expression of a man's joy in his work."<br/>
But everybody has a right to ask whether<br/>
there is not a chance that he is going to spend<br/>
a lot of labor and a certain amount of money<br/>
learning a profession or adopting an <span style="color: #0000FF;">avocation<br/>
</span>that will go out of date after a while and leave<br/>
him stranded. What if the gold should wear<br/>
off, eventually, and baked clay begin to show<br/>
through?<br/>
