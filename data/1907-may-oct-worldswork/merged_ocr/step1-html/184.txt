<br/>
yard of his Mississippi home and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitting </span>words<br/>
to the tune, ushered in the dialect poem. Joel<br/>
Chandler Harris began to tell stories in the<br/>
Atlanta Constitution, gathered from the old<br/>
plantation' in his boyhood-and "Uncle<br/>
Remus" was soon known around the world.<br/>
Richard Malcolm Johnston saw in the light of<br/>
his mature imagination scenes of his boyhood<br/>
in middle Georgia. George W. Cable depicted<br/>
with consummate art the scenery and romance of<br/>
New Orleans. Miss Murfree, with the background of the mountains of east Tennessee,<br/>
interpreted the life of our "contemporary<br/>
ancestors." <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the'eighties, Thomas Nelson<br/>
Page wrote out the stories of the old times in<br/>
Virginia that he had told for a number of years<br/>
in the social circles of Richmond.' James<br/>
Lane Allen, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">finer </span>culture and with<br/>
an added note of idealism, set forth the<br/>
remoter life of the Revolutionary days in Kentucky, and the picturesque charm of the blueglass country. Still later, Miss Johnston <span style="color: #0000FF;">explored </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>of early colonial history, and<br/>
Miss Ellen Glasgow represented something of<br/>
the transition from the old South to the new.<br/>
Some of the most interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>in contemporary American literature are Southerners.<br/>
It is unfortunate that there has not been a<br/>
more notable fulfillment of the early promise,<br/>
but this fact may be in part attributed to the<br/>
general condition of American literature. The<br/>
most serious regret is that Sidney Lanier did<br/>
not live to complete the work that he had<br/>
planned; as it is, he has a distinct place among<br/>
the greater poets of this country.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually these writers, and others who<br/>
might be named, portrayed practically all the<br/>
picturesque phases of Southern life. The<br/>
creole, the mountaineer, the "cracker," the<br/>
Negro, the old Southern gentleman and his<br/>
lady, the overseer, found their interpreters in<br/>
a literature that was full of humor, pathos,<br/>
tragedy, and that was permeated with the air<br/>
of kindly sympathy and freedom. Southern<br/>
society that had been without expression, that<br/>
had prided itself on its solidarity, suddenly<br/>
revealed its secrets to men of genius. If there<br/>
was a tendency to idealize the life of the past<br/>
and to shut the eye to certain important phases<br/>
of that life, it was but natural. The significant<br/>
point is that men began to describe Southern<br/>
scenery, not some fantastic world of dreamland; sentimentalism was superseded by a<br/>
healthy realism touched with romance. The<br/>
writers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiction </span>fell in with contemporary<br/>
<br/>
tendencies in American literature, following<br/>
the lead of Bret Harte and Mark Twain, who<br/>
had faithfully written humorous local sketches<br/>
and incidents. They had the creative instinct<br/>
that removed them far from the purely didactic<br/>
spirit of the older writers<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>With them, literature<br/>
was not a diversion, as it had been with so many<br/>
of the leisurely gentlemen of the old South,<br/>
but a business. They were willing to be known<br/>
as men of letters who made their living by<br/>
literature. Their ideals were well expressed<br/>
by Joel Chandler Harris when he said of the<br/>
Southern writer: "He must be <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southern </span>and<br/>
yet cosmopolitan; he must be intensely local in<br/>
feeling but utterly <span style="color: #0000FF;">unprejudiced </span>and unpartisan<br/>
as to opinions, traditions, and sentiment. Whenever we have a genuine Southern literature it<br/>
will be American and cosmopolitan as well."<br/>
<br/>
Not the least <span style="color: #0000FF;">significant </span>point about this<br/>
literature was that it met with such hearty<br/>
response in the North. Contrary to the idea<br/>
which had prevailed after the war, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Northern </span>people would be slow to recognize Southern<br/>
genius, it must be said that Northern publishers,<br/>
Northern magazines, and Northern readers to<br/>
a large degree made possible the success of<br/>
Southern writers. In one number of Scribner's M <span style="color: #ff0000;">agazine </span>there were no less than seven<br/>
contributions by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southerners</span>, which led the<br/>
editor to comment on the fact of "a permanent<br/>
productive force in literature in the South"<br/>
and to "welcome the new writers to the great<br/>
republic of letters." The same recognition<br/>
came from the Century and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harper</span>'s. An<br/>
article in the Atlantic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monthly</span>, which had been<br/>
the special organ of New England writers, said<br/>
in 1885:<br/>
<br/>
"It is not the subjects offered by Southern writers which<br/>
interest us so much as the manifestation of a spirit which<br/>
seemed to be dying out of our literature. Their<br/>
work is large, imaginative, and constantly <span style="color: #ff0000;">reSponsiye </span>to<br/>
the elemental movements of human nature; and we should<br/>
not be greatly surprised if the historian of our literature,<br/>
a few generations hence, should take note of an enlargement of American letters at this time through the agency<br/>
of a New South. The North refines to a keen<br/>
analysis, the South enriches through <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">generous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">imagination</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The breadth which characterizes the best<br/>
Southern writing, the large, free handling, the confident<br/>
imagination, are legitimate results of the careless yet<br/>
masterful and hospitable life which has pervaded that<br/>
section. We have had our laugh at the florid, <span style="color: #ff0000;">coarseflavored </span>literature which has not yet disappeared at the<br/>
South, but we are witnessing now the rise of a school that<br/>
shows us the worth of generous nature when it has been<br/>
schooled and ordered."<br/>
