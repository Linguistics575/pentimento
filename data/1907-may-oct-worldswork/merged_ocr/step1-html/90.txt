<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8888 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">icans </span>have a lot to learn about the therapeutic<br/>
value of exercise. It keeps off fatty degeneration; it keeps off age. Look at the Swedes--<span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>clean skins, their fresh color, their freedom<br/>
from overplus weight. Look at their mortality<br/>
rate-the lowest in the civilized world!<br/>
<br/>
Even on the curative side of the health<br/>
problem, Sweden can give us points. The<br/>
Government believes in fresh-air as medicine<br/>
to the children of the slums. Instead of two<br/>
weeks in the country, Sweden gives them two<br/>
solid months. The ailing, the puny, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">weakchested </span>among the children of the common<br/>
schools go for the summer to vacation colonies<br/>
in the mountains. Great benevolent societies<br/>
bear the expense, and the government railroads<br/>
carry the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">ferie </span>barn" free. The colonies<br/>
do not cost much because the children themselves (under the eye of a matron) do all the<br/>
lighter sort of house and garden work, learning<br/>
thrift and hygienic methods while they drink<br/>
in the mountain air. By actual physical<br/>
measurements and tests, Sweden has proved<br/>
how much two months of happy, well-ordered<br/>
country life will do for under-developed childhood. Can we say as much for our fortnight of<br/>
free sunshine?<br/>
<br/>
The rational management of doctors might<br/>
also be learned from Sweden. The very system<br/>
which is raising such a hubbub in America<br/>
there flourishes, but flourishes under control.<br/>
I mean the taxing of the sick rich to pay the<br/>
medical bills of the sick poor. As a matter of<br/>
fact, there is no such thing as a doctor's bill in<br/>
all Sweden. Once a year every man sends<br/>
his contribution to his physician according<br/>
to his ability. If his purse is long, he may<br/>
send as much as $ 125. If he is straitened,<br/>
he makes it <span style="color: #0000FF;">825</span>. The poor pay a pittance,<br/>
paupers nothing at all. If a <span style="color: #0000FF;">doctor</span>'s patients<br/>
are mostly of the unmoneyed class, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government </span>subsidizes him to make up. And for<br/>
country districts, where the scattered population could not support a good physician, the<br/>
State either adds to the practitioner's stipend<br/>
or salaries him outright. Everybody must<br/>
have a doctor; that is axiomatic. And he<br/>
must be good. There are no fledglings among<br/>
the medical men of Sweden, for it takes a man<br/>
eleven years to win his diploma. The essential<br/>
beauty of the system is that patients do not<br/>
neglect small ailments from motives of frugality,<br/>
since public opinion forces them to pay their<br/>
doctor his yearly stipend whether he has treated<br/>
them or not. It's health insurance. You lay<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT </span>SCANDINAVIA <span style="color: #ff0000;">CAN </span>TEACH US<br/>
<br/>
up your money in the doctor's office, and when<br/>
illness comes, you draw on it.<br/>
<br/>
DANISH PROVISION FOR POVERTY AND AGE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Turning </span>to Denmark, we shall pick up some<br/>
suggestive hints about the care of the poor.<br/>
Destitute Danes do not starve in their pride<br/>
rather than come upon charity; and Danish<br/>
vagrants do not commit petty crimes in order<br/>
to board for a little while at the public expense.<br/>
For Denmark is all things to all men. It<br/>
draws a sharp line between the man who cannot<br/>
support himself and the man who will not.<br/>
The second it brands with the accursed name<br/>
of pauper, and proceeds to put him through a<br/>
regenerating course of sprouts. The first it<br/>
shields from the very shadow of disgrace.<br/>
Every Danish town has a free fund to tide<br/>
working-folk over temporary trouble. No<br/>
shame attaches to the acceptance of this sort<br/>
of public aid. It is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-preserver </span>which a<br/>
man would be a fool not to catch. To honest<br/>
working people in distress, the Danish <span style="color: #ff0000;">poorlaw </span>officer is a sort of special Providence. He<br/>
not only provides funds to put the embarrassed<br/>
on their feet; he helps them find work and<br/>
cheap lodgings. If landlords are extortionate,<br/>
he can compel them to come to terms. All<br/>
things are made to work together for good to<br/>
the man who is trying to pull himself up.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, once the poor-law officer<br/>
has convinced himself that a man is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">ne'er-doweel</span>, society turns toward that man quite<br/>
another face. It will support him, and his<br/>
wife and children, too-but on its own terms.<br/>
The day he accepts the name "pauper," by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">taking </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">am </span>he ought to do without, that day a<br/>
man signs away his personal independence.<br/>
Society sets out to sicken him of his choice.<br/>
At one stroke, she takes from him his right to<br/>
vote, his right to marry without the <span style="color: #ff0000;">poorofficer</span>'s permission, and his right to pawn his<br/>
own goods. He can no longer choose his own<br/>
occupation or his own dwelling. Stricter laws<br/>
apply to him than to honest men. If he is<br/>
disorderly, beats his wife, neglects his children,<br/>
or teaches them to steal or beg, to prison he<br/>
must go. So long as he remains an "<span style="color: #0000FF;">out</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>pauper" he is bound to work, and of course<br/>
the longer he works the more surely approaches<br/>
the day when he can no longer pretend to<br/>
need public aid<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>And what if he won't work? Then he finds<br/>
himself speedily imprisoned in a workhouse<br/>
upon indeterminate sentence. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Insubordina<br/>
