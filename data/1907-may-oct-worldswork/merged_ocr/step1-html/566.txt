<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9364<br/>
<br/>
</span>were established in different parts of Ohio in<br/>
the period before the war. Most of these<br/>
communities have disappeared and been <span style="color: #0000FF;">forgotten</span>, but traces of them may still be found<br/>
under obscure names in forgotten corners of<br/>
Ohio, and in other portions of the original<br/>
Northwest Territory. More than one of the<br/>
families now living in Wilberforce can trace<br/>
its history back to some one of the Negro<br/>
pioneers who crossed the mountains from<br/>
Virginia in the early days in order to <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>a<br/>
home in the free territory of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Northwest</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The conditions under which this and the<br/>
other Negro communities of which it is a type<br/>
were established in Ohio will be better <span style="color: #0000FF;">understood</span>, perhaps, if I recall the circumstances<br/>
under which the state was settled.<br/>
<br/>
A century ago one might have discovered in<br/>
Ohio a situation not unlike that which may be<br/>
seen to-day in the new state of Oklahoma.<br/>
Two currents of immigration, one from the<br/>
North, the other from the South, pouring into<br/>
the state and mingling on the same soil, brought<br/>
into touch with one another two widely different traditions, particularly with regard to<br/>
the Negro and the treatment that he deserved<br/>
at the hands of his white neighbors. The<br/>
effect of this was to produce a number of<br/>
abrupt changes in the situation of the free<br/>
Negroes, according as, in the course of history,<br/>
the anti-slavery or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro-slavery </span>element had<br/>
control of popular opinion. For instance, by<br/>
the terms of the Constitution, as it was first<br/>
adopted by the constitutional convention in<br/>
1802, Negroes were given the right to vote.<br/>
A motion subsequently made to strike out the<br/>
provision was carried only by the vote of the<br/>
presiding <span style="color: #ff0000;">officcr</span>. This was followed, however,<br/>
a few years later, by the enactment by the<br/>
Legislature of a so-called "black code," so<br/>
vigorous in its terms that, if it had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">enforced</span>, it would have made the position of the<br/>
free Negroes of Ohio quite as <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>as it<br/>
ever was in any of the slave states. Laws<br/>
were passed which were intended not merely<br/>
to prevent the further settling of Negroes in<br/>
the state, but which aimed to drive out those<br/>
already there.<br/>
<br/>
One thing about the character of the people<br/>
who settled the southern part of Ohio was<br/>
peculiar. Though most of the settlers in the<br/>
two or three tiers of counties were from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Virginia </span>or Kentucky, a large number were people<br/>
who had moved from the South for the purpose of freeing their slaves. Mount Pleasant,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span>NEGRO COLLEGE TOWN<br/>
<br/>
Smithfield, and several other neighboring<br/>
towns in Jefferson County were settled by<br/>
Quakers who had liberated their slaves in<br/>
North Carolina and after the adoption of the<br/>
ordinance in 1787 settled in the free territory.<br/>
It was at Mount Pleasant that Benjamin<br/>
Lundy, the founder of the Abolition movement, started the first Abolition paper, in<br/>
1821.<br/>
<br/>
But not merely Quakers and those of severe<br/>
and earnest religious views migrated to the new<br/>
country to secure freedom for their slaves.<br/>
Some of the men who were most prominent<br/>
in the early history of the state were drawn to<br/>
this new country for the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, from earliest times, it had become a<br/>
custom for masters who did not believe in the<br/>
institution of slavery, or who, for any reason<br/>
whatever, wished to free their slaves, either to<br/>
emigrate to the free territory or send their<br/>
slaves there to enjoy the fruits of freedom.<br/>
This practice of settling emancipated slaves<br/>
on the free soil of the Northwest Territory<br/>
was continued until the Civil War put an end<br/>
to slavery.<br/>
<br/>
The little Negro community at Tawawa<br/>
Springs-now known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilberforce</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-was<br/>
</span>Southern in its origin, and the school out of<br/>
which the present College eventually grew was<br/>
an attempt to redress some of the wrongs that<br/>
sprang from slavery.<br/>
<br/>
THE FOUNDING OF THE COLLEGE<br/>
<br/>
In 1856, when the anti-slavery agitation was<br/>
at its height in Ohio, the Methodist Conference<br/>
in Cincinnati, in conjunction with the Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal<br/>
Church, established at Tawawa Springs a<br/>
school for the Negro immigrants and refugees<br/>
who had settled there. Salmon P. Chase, the<br/>
first anti-slavery Governor of Ohio, was one of<br/>
the board of trustees. Governor Chase's<br/>
interest in the school continued throughout his<br/>
life, and when he died, as Chief-Justice of the<br/>
United States, he left $ 10,000 to assist in providing an endowment for the institution.<br/>
<br/>
At the time of the breaking out of the war,<br/>
this school had nearly one hundred pupils.<br/>
Many of these came from the families settled<br/>
in the neighborhood. Others were the natural<br/>
sons and daughters of Southern planters who<br/>
had sent them North to be educated. But with<br/>
the breaking out of the war the school, deprived'of its principal patrons, fell into decay,<br/>
and in June, 1863, it was sold for a debt of<br/>
<br/>
