families now the children are sent regularly<br/>
to the dentist-not so much to have cavities<br/>
filled, as to prevent them. Some people also<br/>
submit periodically to an examination of the<br/>
eyes, in order that any damage may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">detected </span>early and may be corrected before it has<br/>
gone far. And there are some men who have<br/>
the good sense to retain a physician upon<br/>
exactly the basis upon which the lawyer is<br/>
kept: not primarily to help them out of trouble,<br/>
but to keep them from needing to be helped<br/>
out. It will be his duty, of course, to undertake his client's case if, by infringing some of<br/>
Nature's laws, he has made himself liable for<br/>
damages; but the physician's main responsibility will be preventive-he will give his<br/>
client expert assistance in keeping out of<br/>
trouble. He will give him warning when he<br/>
is running under too little headway; he will<br/>
prime him for an emergency; he will tell him<br/>
when he is making a risky deal.<br/>
<br/>
He must be even more of a specialist in the<br/>
laws of health than in those of disease; for his<br/>
business is to show his client how to run his<br/>
complex, highly organized, physical corporation so as to get the biggest results-maximum<br/>
efficiency-with the least danger. Entanglements with disease are costly.<br/>
<br/>
The physician and surgeon are of much use<br/>
in sickness; but they are of far more use when<br/>
they succeed in preventing sickness. Prevention is worth more than cure. Its cash value<br/>
is greater. It is good economy: it saves time,<br/>
money, energy, opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Unless he has some decisive warning, unless<br/>
there is some creak worse than usual in his<br/>
physical machinery, the average man does not<br/>
see a doctor professionally from decade to<br/>
decade. What does he lose? What does the<br/>
engine lose if no one but the coal stoker looks<br/>
it over for a month, or a year? Perhaps the<br/>
engine will run without mishap 364 days, and<br/>
on the 365th day the boiler will burst. For<br/>
364 days the owner of the engine did not lose<br/>
anything by <span style="color: #0000FF;">his</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">neglect </span>to employ the skilled<br/>
engineer. On the 365th day he lost enough<br/>
to make the wages of the skilled engineer a<br/>
mere bagatelle in comparison. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>is it wholly<br/>
true to say that the owner of the engine lost<br/>
nothing in the 364 days. Under the management of the skilled engineer, the engine would<br/>
probably have developed a fraction of a horsepower more every day; the total difference<br/>
during the year might have been appreciable.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy is obvious. The man who<br/>
<br/>
TO <span style="color: #ff0000;">USE </span>A <span style="color: #ff0000;">DOCTOR<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9123<br/>
<br/>
</span>goes along twenty years without expert supervision over his physical machine may do <span style="color: #0000FF;">very<br/>
</span>well for twenty years; but it would have been<br/>
better to consult a physician every month for<br/>
twenty years and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-first </span>be saved<br/>
from going to "smash," than it would be to go<br/>
without his advice for twenty years and go to<br/>
pieces in the twenty-first. To consult a physician regularly is life insurance of a far more<br/>
vital type than the financial kind.<br/>
<br/>
The lawyer that is valuable to a corporation<br/>
is the lawyer that has been with it for years and<br/>
knows its most intricate characteristics. Corporations differ no more than human beings<br/>
differ. Jones & Company could not call in<br/>
even Daniel Webster and expect him to give<br/>
them the best advice on a knotty problem after<br/>
twenty minutes' consultation. The man who<br/>
expects to get expert counsel with reference to<br/>
health and the conduct of life by spending<br/>
twenty minutes in the office of a doctor who<br/>
has never seen him before, is no more reasonable. It is more true of the individual than<br/>
of the corporation that many essential elements<br/>
can be discovered only through long acquaintance, no matter how skilful the physician.<br/>
<br/>
It is just as necessary to go to a physician who<br/>
has specialized in this department of constructive medicine, as it is to go to an oculist when<br/>
one wishes most expert work done for the eyes.<br/>
As yet, relatively few physicians are specialists<br/>
upon hygiene, and the reason is not far<br/>
to seek: the public does not demand such<br/>
specialists. It prefers to take pills on "snap"<br/>
diagnoses, or to submit to occasional surgical<br/>
operations when the case has gone far. As a<br/>
result of this lack of public demand, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>compensations for this branch of medicine<br/>
are small.<br/>
<br/>
In order to be acquainted with the whole<br/>
range of preventive medicine, a man has fully<br/>
as large a scientific territory to explore and<br/>
keep in touch with as has any other specialist.<br/>
My own impression is that he has a larger field<br/>
than any other specialist. In a measure, his<br/>
field must include a general survey of all<br/>
others. He must be an expert diagnostician.<br/>
To discover the trouble is a far more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult<br/>
</span>thing to do than to select the measures that<br/>
shall make for cure.<br/>
<br/>
The large fee and the large place in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">community </span>are to-day given to the man who can<br/>
perform a surgical operation with skill. And<br/>
yet, it is of more importance to get that advice which shall make the surgical operation<br/>
<br/>
