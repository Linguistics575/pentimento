<span>9272 THE<br/>
a very large part of our political life and they<br/>
had come to think of themselves as the proprietors of American financial, industrial, and<br/>
political power. In this state of mind there<br/>
was danger enough. But <span style="color: #ff0000;">there </span>was a still<br/>
greater danger in the state of mind which lent<br/>
itself to what, for the lack of a better name,<br/>
may be called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hearstism</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The work of the Administration in reasserting the power of law over the great corporations<br/>
has been, not a radical, but a conservative<br/>
force. It has kept an angry and radical and<br/>
possibly destructive power from organizing<br/>
itself. If some state legislatures and executives<br/>
have gone beyond sound law and good sense,<br/>
this is a small evil that will <span style="color: #0000FF;">soon </span>be corrected.<br/>
But, if a strong public sentiment-all the forces<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissatisfied-had </span>rallied, let us say, to<br/>
Mr. Bryan when he came home and proclaimed<br/>
the government ownership of railroads, we<br/>
should have had a contest that would have<br/>
involved a degree of danger that might have put<br/>
an end to prosperity and to many other things<br/>
besides.<br/>
<br/>
Now Mr. Bryan himself has practically<br/>
recanted. The people have become accustomed to the hope and the expectation that<br/>
corporations will be made to respect the <span style="color: #ff0000;">la </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">w</span>, that<br/>
the Government will be conducted without surrender to them; and such revolutionary and<br/>
radical proposals as would lead to distrust,<br/>
insecurity, and even to confiscation are no<br/>
longer feared.<br/>
<br/>
And the problem has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearly </span>formulated<br/>
once for all. The complete solution of it will<br/>
require many experiments, many years, many<br/>
Presidential administrations. But <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mr. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Roosevelt </span>has proved that the predatory trusts can<br/>
be brought to respect the law without <span style="color: #0000FF;">overturning </span>our industrial structure and without<br/>
checking prosperity. His successors cannot<br/>
escape the same task.<br/>
<br/>
Whether, therefore, any particular experiment or proposal be fantastical or fanatical,<br/>
and whether any state enact and enforce<br/>
absurd laws, or whether Mr. Roosevelt's personal popularity be on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wane-thee </span>are of<br/>
little consequence. To-morrow they will all<br/>
be forgotten or reversed. The thing that will<br/>
remain for many a day and for other Presidents<br/>
and Congresses will be this <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-forrnulated </span>task<br/>
--to keep the great combinations of capital<br/>
within the bounds of just laws without stopping<br/>
the industrial machinery and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ihe-prrjiiiable<br/>
</span>activity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country.. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L<br/>
<br/>
</span>MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
THE MORALS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>CORPORATE CONDUCT<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>whole movement to regulate <span style="color: #0000FF;">corporations</span>, a movement which runs to excess<br/>
in vindictive and short-sighted legislation,<br/>
finds its justification in <span style="color: #0000FF;">this-that </span>it is a step<br/>
toward demanding the same standard of conduct in corporate and business life that is<br/>
demanded in private life. Public sentiment<br/>
sets up a standard for private conduct higher<br/>
than the standard that it holds the same men<br/>
to in their corporate dealings. An explanation<br/>
of this double standard is given by President<br/>
Hadley, of Yale University, in a recent volume<br/>
of addresses on <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>Standards of Public Morality."<br/>
Contrasting the judgment passed on men's<br/>
personal conduct and the judgment of the<br/>
same community on their corporate conduct,<br/>
he says:<br/>
<br/>
"Our experience in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>case has been much longer<br/>
than our experience in the other. Men have been trying to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>in peace and harmony with those about them for so<br/>
many thousand years that we know what is needed to keep<br/>
the peace. But there have been so few hundred years<br/>
since we <span style="color: #0000FF;">begun </span>experimenting with the present commercial<br/>
and industrial system that we do not yet know what virtues<br/>
are needed for its maintenance. In public morals,<br/>
whether commercial or political,. there is no such<br/>
consensus of public opinion as to the obligations which a<br/>
man ought to assume."<br/>
<br/>
The rude and sometimes mistaken "<span style="color: #0000FF;">interference</span>" with business by the Government is<br/>
an effort to enforce a higher standard of conduct; and, foolish and misdirected as some of<br/>
this activity is, the public conscience is <span style="color: #0000FF;">behind </span>it.<br/>

NORTH CAROLINA RAILROAD LEGISLATION<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>heated controversy between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">state<br/>
<br/>
</span>of North Carolina on the one hand and<br/>
the Southern Railway on the other points<br/>
clearly to the danger of legislation hastily<br/>
enacted to meet the demand of the public, and<br/>
without proper discussion. The legislature of<br/>
North Carolina at its recent session passed a<br/>
law reducing the passenger rate within the<br/>
state from <span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>cents per mile to 2% cents per<br/>
mile. In fixing the penalty for violation of<br/>
this law, the legislature appears to have tried<br/>
to make it impossible for any railroad to test<br/>
the law in the civil courts. In other words,<br/>
according to the statement made by Governor<br/>
Glenn on this point, the railroad must commit<br/>
a crime and must become the defendant in a<br/>
criminal suit <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>a' legal test of the law can<br/>
be' obtained<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
