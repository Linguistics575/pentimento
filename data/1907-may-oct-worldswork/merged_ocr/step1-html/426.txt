</span>career, then the career of William <span style="color: #ff0000;">H.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Taft would likely be described <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
<br/>
</span>the two words: "Useful Citizenship." Almost<br/>
since the day he left college in 1878, during the<br/>
thirty years that represent the most active<br/>
period of a man's life, he has given practically<br/>
his whole time, thought, and effort to the public<br/>
service. He has made no money beyond a<br/>
moderate living. When he returned from the<br/>
Philippines to enter on the expensive duties of<br/>
Secretary of War, he had $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">31</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500</span>. The thought<br/>
suggests itself that the nation owes this man<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
It is characteristic of a man like Secretary<br/>
Taft, however, that returns for service are<br/>
measured in other terms than money. Beyond<br/>
a doubt, he considers himself well paid. To<br/>
begin with, he holds that the college graduate's<br/>
first duty is to locate the polling place where<br/>
he can cast his vote. And then, for ten or<br/>
fifteen years, granting that the young man has<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
</span>not the support of a family on his shoulders,<br/>
there follows what he calls the period of obligations, when all graduates have the time and<br/>
energy "to attempt to make the politics of the<br/>
neighborhood better."<br/>
That is the way young Taft started. He had<br/>
not the competence that tempts to lazy ease,<br/>
but he did have family influence; so there was<br/>
required of him the moral courage, "much<br/>
greater than that of the poor man," to scorn<br/>
idleness and win for himself a useful place in<br/>
the community. He began his preparations<br/>
in the Cincinnati Law School, and on <span style="color: #0000FF;">graduation </span>divided the first prize with another student.<br/>
Later he was the youngest Yale alumnus to<br/>
get the honorary degree of LL. D. Like his<br/>
father, he also became a member of the Yale<br/>
Corporation. He worked for his father's law<br/>
firm, Taft & Lloyd, and did court reporting<br/>
for The Times-Star, the paper owned by his<br/>
half-brother, Charles P. Taft. Murat Halstead, the eminent editor of The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Commercial<br/>
