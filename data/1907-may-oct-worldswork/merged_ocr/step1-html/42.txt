</span>did the same. It was a terrible night. My<br/>
hair below my felt hat was covered with ice<br/>
in the morning, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>was nevertheless grateful<br/>
to the llamas. At Poto we also suffered<br/>
intensely from the cold, although we were not<br/>
troubled with'soroche,' the mountain sickness, which so often affects travelers at high<br/>
altitudes. It was evident that <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>was the first<br/>
white woman to reach this village, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Indians, usually so stoical, were quite curious<br/>
about my appearance." "<br/>

seldom realizes what skill and patience it has<br/>
taken to place that knowledge in its hands.<br/>
"It <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>fell to my lot," said a professional<br/>
who has made a specialty of nature photography, "to have to illustrate a wild-animal<br/>
story entirely by photography, the stipulation<br/>
being that all the pictures should be made of<br/>
the wild animal in his native surroundings,<br/>
and that I must turn in the prints within one<br/>
month. The wild animal to be photographed<br/>
was only a harmless porcupine. Yet it is not<br/>
