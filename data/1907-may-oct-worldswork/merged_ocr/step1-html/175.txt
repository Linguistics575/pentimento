</span>MR. WASHINGTON DUKE AND HIS FIRST TOBACCO FACTORY AT DURHAM, N. C.<br/>
<br/>
following corn last year, he hopes for a <span style="color: #ff0000;">twobale </span>average on the entire field. To-day he<br/>
wouldn't sell his $ 9.41 land of 1899 for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goo<br/>
</span>an acre; and why should he, since even at<br/>
that figure the buyer could pay for it with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>year's cotton crop? His example is but<br/>
one of thousands that might be cited, and that<br/>
have proved as contagious as measles.<br/>
<br/>
In five years the attendance on Farmers'<br/>
<br/>
Institutes has doubled, the number of farm<br/>
papers read has probably increased 400 per<br/>
cent., and the number of agricultural students<br/>
at the Agricultural and Mechanical College<br/>
has more than trebled. With financial <span style="color: #0000FF;">independence</span>, too, the farmer has acquired a<br/>
deeper dignity and pride in his calling. He<br/>
no longer owes the merchant, and so much<br/>
a thing of the past is the old, ruinous,<br/>
