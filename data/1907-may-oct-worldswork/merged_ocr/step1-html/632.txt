of contract. Certainly to an American company it would seem to bear but bony pickings.<br/>
<br/>
THE ELECTRICITY COMPROMISE<br/>
<br/>
Electric light and electricity for general use<br/>
went the same way. The Council had a <span style="color: #0000FF;">commission </span>at work on these subjects and the commission reported that the price of electricity<br/>
was extortionately high; that electricity had<br/>
remained a luxury for the Paris rich, whereas<br/>
it should have been a convenience for all<br/>
classes; that the greed of the companies stood<br/>
between the public and new inventions and<br/>
improvements; and that as the end of the<br/>
franchises approached the companies were<br/>
contracting the service and abusing public<br/>
patience. To remedy these evils, the Council<br/>
proposed that the city should take over the<br/>
electric lighting business and abolish private<br/>
ownership. Once more it encountered the<br/>
opposition of the Senate, and once more it<br/>
resorted to a temporary compromise. Contracts have been prepared for a revocable<br/>
license to the companies, covering a nominal<br/>
period of twenty-six years. The companies<br/>
thus allowed to do business must extend<br/>
their lines wherever, whenever, and in<br/>
such manner as the city shall direct. The<br/>
city is divided into six sections, with one<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">exploiter</span>, under municipal supervision, in each<br/>
section. Beginning with next year, each company is to pay the city <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per cent. of its annual<br/>
receipts, the percentage to be increased with<br/>
increasing business. The city has the right<br/>
to buy at any time the whole system of distribution, stations, sub-stations, branch-lines, and<br/>
the rest, the price to be the actual cost of construction, plus 10 per cent. for general expenses<br/>
and minus one twenty-fifth of the whole for<br/>
each year of service. Beginning in 1924, the<br/>
city will have an annual right, upon certain<br/>
conditions, to cancel the contract.<br/>
<br/>
CITY-OWNED PUBLIC UTILITIES<br/>
<br/>
Paris has now six main lines of underground<br/>
railroad completed or in construction, and has<br/>
planned a wonderful network of other lines<br/>
radiating to every quarter of the city, on both<br/>
sides of the Seine. The building of these lines<br/>
is a municipal undertaking; the operating<br/>
is by a company to which the city has granted<br/>
the temporary rights. The company pays to<br/>
the city an enormous rental, arranged on the<br/>
traffic. Thus, for every second-class ticket,<br/>
price three cents, the company pays one cent,<br/>
<br/>
THE HUMANITARIAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">RULE </span>IN PARIS<br/>
<br/>
with a minimum of 130,000,000 second-class<br/>
passengers a year; on early morning return<br/>
tickets (commutation), price four cents, it<br/>
pays one cent; on every first-class ticket, price<br/>
five cents, it pays two cents.<br/>
<br/>
Two private companies are constructing<br/>
underground railroads in Paris, but under<br/>
municipal control and supervision. They will<br/>
pay one-fifth of a cent for every ticket sold, up<br/>
to 30,000,000, and a slightly increased tax for<br/>
every additional ticket. As with the other<br/>
lines, the whole institution becomes city property at the end of the franchise; but in this<br/>
instance the city reserves the right to purchase<br/>
in 1924.<br/>
<br/>
Such of the street railroad lines as have<br/>
ancient foundations will be secured by the city<br/>
without much trouble. To these the Empire<br/>
gave franchises of fifty years but, when the<br/>
Republic came in, it generally reduced the<br/>
term to thirty years or thereabouts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Franchises<br/>
</span>of both the Empire and the Republic will soon<br/>
begin to expire and the franchises explicitly<br/>
provided for the city's possession of the lines<br/>
when the terms of the grants should lapse. Not<br/>
only the lines, but all the immovable possessions<br/>
of the companies are to be surrendered; plants,<br/>
power houses, poles, wires, office buildings,<br/>
and stations become city property without<br/>
legislation and without purchase. Most of the<br/>
omnibus franchises expire five years hence.<br/>
They have the same conditions and will pass<br/>
to the city in the same inexpensive manner.<br/>
Whether the Senate will seek to interfere with<br/>
the city's operation of these properties is uncertain. In 1924 the last of the street railroad,<br/>
motor line, and omnibus franchises will fall in.<br/>
By that year the Council expects to see the most<br/>
stupendous plan of interurban transportation<br/>
ever known in any city, a system to comprise all<br/>
forms of <span style="color: #0000FF;">transit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">underground </span>and surface<br/>
electric railroads, motor lines, compressed-air<br/>
vehicles, omnibuses, and river boats-covering<br/>
every <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner </span>of Paris, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">system </span>of universal<br/>
transfers, all owned and operated by the city<br/>
and all furnishing cheap, frequent, and convenient service. That is the plan. And if<br/>
there are any air-ship lines in practical operation<br/>
by that time, the Council will want them too.<br/>
<br/>
For several years now the humanitarian<br/>
element in Paris has been gaining strength in<br/>
the popular elections. The gravest question<br/>
seems to be how long a majority of the Parisians will be satisfied to allow themselves to<br/>
be turned back by the Senate wall.<br/>
