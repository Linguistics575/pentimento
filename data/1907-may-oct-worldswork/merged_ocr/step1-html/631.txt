<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">HUMANITARIAN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RULE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IN<br/>
<br/>
</span>three years old have a large and comfortable<br/>
play hall; boys from three to eight and girls<br/>
from three to thirteen are placed in school.<br/>
All of these institutions are clean, homelike,<br/>
and operated without <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>tyranny or red<br/>
tape. Strange to say, their net result does not<br/>
seem to tend in any way toward the making<br/>
of professional paupers; on the contrary, they<br/>
seem to produce an extraordinary proportion<br/>
of self-supporting members of society.<br/>
<br/>
AMUSEMENTS TAXED FOR CHARITY<br/>
<br/>
An ancient and admirable institution, not<br/>
duplicated elsewhere, so far as I know, is the<br/>
Assistance Publique. Its history goes back to<br/>
Louis XIV, when it began with a tax of <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per<br/>
cent. on every theatre ticket; but for the<br/>
source of its truest efficiency you must look to<br/>
latter-day humanitarianism. Every year it<br/>
provides 15,000 free beds in the hospitals<br/>
and 15,000 more in the asylums. It has built<br/>
a great maternity hospital that cares for<br/>
mothers (<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>children, too), asking no questions<br/>
but merely giving the sisterly hand. Whenever the hospital may be full, or when other<br/>
reasons may suggest more extended relief, the<br/>
Assistance Publique hires experienced midwives to care for poor women at their homes.<br/>
It pays for the bringing up of thousands of<br/>
children; it provides free medicines for the sick<br/>
poor, sends to them visitors and help, and<br/>
expends $ 10,000,000 a year in its great benevolences. Of this sum $ 3,000,000 is for <span style="color: #0000FF;">outdoor<br/>
</span>relief and $ 70,000 for free medicines furnished<br/>
to the poor in their homes. The Assistance<br/>
Publique has also a function in the protecting<br/>
of workingmen. It takes charge of cases of<br/>
serious injury, and collects from the employer<br/>
in every such case $ 1.25 a day for the benefit<br/>
of the injured person, the payments continuing<br/>
so long as there is incapacity for labor. Employers may shift <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>burden to accident<br/>
insurance companies, if they so desire, but<br/>
the $ 1.25 must be forthcoming daily. When<br/>
in Paris you go to a theatre, a concert, or to the<br/>
races, you may be pleased to <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflect </span>that you<br/>
are contributing to the support of a worthy<br/>
institution, for every amusement ticket carries<br/>
a tax for the Assistance Publique. Its receipts<br/>
from this source last year were more than<br/>
$ 800,000. The Municipal Council is <span style="color: #0000FF;">behind<br/>
<br/>
</span>the Assistance Publique, helping it in <span style="color: #0000FF;">many<br/>
</span>ways<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>On reasonable grounds, the Council desires<br/>
to municipalize the public utilities of the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">RULE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IN </span>PARIS 9429<br/>
It has demonstrated that it can conduct such<br/>
enterprises to the increased welfare of the consumers and it needs great revenues for its vast<br/>
schemes to better conditions. Hence it desires<br/>
to take over and operate street railroads, motor<br/>
lines, underground roads, gas, electricity, Seine<br/>
steamboats, omnibuses, the undertaking business-everything in sight that can be operated<br/>
by municipal agents. The Council points to<br/>
the invariable success with which other continental cities have conducted the like ventures;<br/>
but always the Senate plants itself across the<br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the Empire encouraged the private<br/>
ownership of public utilities and tied up all<br/>
the services of Paris with long-term franchises.<br/>
But the Empire has been dead these <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtysix </span>years and the franchises it granted are<br/>
expiring. And now comes on the question<br/>
whether they shall be renewed or be transferred to the municipality. The Council wants<br/>
them for the public welfare; the Senate insists<br/>
upon delivering them to private owners.<br/>
<br/>
THE STRUGGLE FOR CHEAP GAS<br/>
<br/>
One of the typical contests was over gas.<br/>
Paris gas, furnished exclusively by private<br/>
companies, was very high. Bent upon its way of<br/>
supervising life for all its people, the Council<br/>
desired to buy, build, and operate municipal<br/>
gas works. At the beginning of 1905 the<br/>
National Chamber of Deputies (the Lower<br/>
House), which usually sympathize with the<br/>
Council, passed the necessary enabling act;<br/>
the Senate promptly threw it out. The next<br/>
year the Council introduced another bill:<br/>
result, exactly the same.<br/>
<br/>
On January <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, 1907, the franchise of the old<br/>
gas company of the Empire expired; the<br/>
Council, without waiting for the Senate, took<br/>
over the property. But it could not legally<br/>
operate the works without the Senate's sanction,<br/>
and sanction the Senate resolutely refused to<br/>
give. The Council was therefore driven to<br/>
lease the works. Thirteen bids were received,<br/>
one from an American syndicate supposed to<br/>
represent the Standard Oil Company. When<br/>
the Council announced that it would require<br/>
the lessee to give to its employees all the rights<br/>
and privileges of men in the municipal service,<br/>
the Americans hurriedly <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew</span>. Five <span style="color: #0000FF;">bidders </span>were chosen from the remaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">twelve<br/>
</span>and from these will be selected one company<br/>
for the eventual prize. That is, if it will be<br/>
a prize when <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Council </span>completes the form<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
