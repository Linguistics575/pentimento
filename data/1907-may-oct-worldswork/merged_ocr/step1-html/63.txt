<span>THE HONOR OF THE RAILROAD <span style="color: #ff0000;">MAN'<br/>
<br/>
</span>buried unde: a little white stone that lay in the<br/>
path of the railroad.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh!" said the engineer.<br/>
<br/>
And that is the reason why the railroad runs<br/>
through that valley to this day on a gentle<br/>
curve, bending some forty feet from a tangent.<br/>
Which only goes to prove that the man who<br/>
tames the West can be reached some way, even<br/>
though it be not with <span style="color: #0000FF;">money'nor </span>with lands.<br/>
<br/>
If any man want confirmation of these<br/>
statements about the relative honesty of the<br/>
men who opened the West and carried its<br/>
business to and fro over the thirty years of<br/>
struggle, let him look for the men who did the<br/>
deeds. A dozen, out of the thousands, I<br/>
know are living in wealth in the great cities.<br/>
Two I can name who may have made the basis<br/>
of their wealth by dishonest dealing on a large<br/>
scale. The others came up slowly, by terrible<br/>
labor and sheer genius.<br/>
<br/>
But where are the men who made the West,<br/>
the pioneers who opened up the fertile valleys?<br/>
Some few of them you may <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>holding high<br/>
positions on the roads they built, or on yet<br/>
other roads. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span>of them can, at this day,<br/>
afford to retire from labor. Those who can,<br/>
you will find in the suburbs of St. Louis, in<br/>
the little towns of Illinois or Indiana, living<br/>
in modest houses, men small of means and not<br/>
at all pretentious. If any one of the engineers<br/>
who built the Union Pacific had so much as<br/>
gained an option on 1,000 acres of the land<br/>
through which the greater part of the railroad<br/>
lies, he would have been to-day a wealthy man.<br/>
If any one of them had sought <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>his own<br/>
profit, he would have been to-day a man of<br/>
millions.<br/>
<br/>
The same applies to the traffic men of the<br/>
last decade and the decade before. I know<br/>
three old men who served three railroads of the<br/>
West in traffic positions that could have yielded<br/>
to them hundreds of thousands of dollars in<br/>
perfectly safe and highly respectable "graft."<br/>
All are retired, and all are living modestly, and<br/>
on not as much money as the average man<br/>
could save in ordinary pursuits in a shorter<br/>
life than theirs, and a much easier one.<br/>
<br/>
I went beyond the facts I have set down, and<br/>
looked for the reason underlying them. I<br/>
think I found it. By way of comparison, and<br/>
merely to establish the reason, I carried my<br/>
questions into other professions. I found,<br/>
for instance, a fixed impression among the<br/>
junior officers of three great industrial and<br/>
manufacturing companies that the "shipping<br/>
<br/>
Mth<br/>
<br/>
department" and the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>department" of<br/>
these companies were very desirable places<br/>
to work, because the heads and the men immediately below the heads of these departments<br/>
"are apt to get rich."<br/>
<br/>
I did not go far enough to establish the charge<br/>
that this "aptitude" is general among the<br/>
industrial companies. In fact, I failed to<br/>
find it in two large industrial companies, so<br/>
far as I went into their affairs. I did find it<br/>
a fixed impression among the men of three out<br/>
of the five corporations to which I turned.<br/>
<br/>
THE RAILROAD CODE OF HONOR<br/>
<br/>
Among the men of the railroads, I have never<br/>
found that the habit of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">getting </span>rich" by<br/>
methods outside the regularly established salary<br/>
is expected, or winked at, or encouraged in the<br/>
men of any department on the railroad. In<br/>
fact, the man who seems to be living beyond<br/>
his visible means of support is immediately<br/>
under suspicion. The men below him do not<br/>
envy him. They despise him. The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">grafter</span>"<br/>
on a railroad cannot hold his staff together,<br/>
for the simple reason that the whole code of<br/>
railroad morals is directly against him. From<br/>
the smallest office boy in the executive offices<br/>
to the head of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>department, the same<br/>
code of morals obtains.<br/>
<br/>
I am writing, of course, of general conditions. It is well known that on at least one<br/>
railroad system there has been, and is, a reign<br/>
of "graft." The result is astounding to any<br/>
man who does not know the railroad men at<br/>
large. That railroad and its men are "blacklisted," quietly, automatically, all over the<br/>
West. The feeling runs into the operating<br/>
staffs, even to the presidents. Where traffic<br/>
can be diverted from that road it is diverted.<br/>
The road is considered a leper amongst its<br/>
fellows. The men who run it are tainted.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it is not argued that all the million<br/>
men who draw the pay of the railroads are<br/>
clean men--<span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span>from it. There are always,<br/>
in every profession, many men who think that<br/>
they can "beat the game." The point is that<br/>
"the game," on the railroads, is a clean game,<br/>
played under rules stricter and better enforced<br/>
than any other rules that regulate' a similar<br/>
profession.<br/>
<br/>
I can speak for this on my own authority<br/>
from years of close contact with the game as it<br/>
is played, and from a fair understanding both<br/>
of the code of railroad morals and the spirit<br/>
in which it is enforced.<br/>
<br/>
