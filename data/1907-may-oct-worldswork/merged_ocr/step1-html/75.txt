</span>always be a favorite of fashion; but the chinchilla that comes from the cool mountain<br/>
heights of Bolivia is just as superior to the<br/>
chinchilla that comes from the valleys of Peru<br/>
and the La Plata as the dark-brown beaver of<br/>
the far North was superior to the light-yellow<br/>
beaver that used to be found along the salt<br/>
lakes of Nevada and Utah. In fact, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>requirement for good fur is cold; the second,<br/>
fresh water in preference to salt, which fades<br/>
the furs; third, shaded woods in preference<br/>
to the blazing sunlight of the plains.<br/>

BEAVER, CHINCHILLA, SABLE, AND ERMINE<br/>
<br/>
Beaver needs no description here. Every<br/>
school child knows that the exploration of<br/>
North America followed the trail of the little<br/>
beaver and that, like the buffalo and the fur<br/>
seal and the sea otter, it has yearly grown<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">scarcer</span>. Will it, too, become extinct? I do<br/>
<br/>
not think so. The Government of Canada,<br/>
where the beaver thrives best, has taken steps<br/>
to protect it, though <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>closed season in the true<br/>
sense there can never <span style="color: #0000FF;">be-for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>simple reason<br/>
that the Indian treaties stipulate that the Red<br/>
Man shall have the right to hunt as long as<br/>
"the streams <span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>and the sun rises." But the<br/>
white trader can discourage the Indian hunter<br/>
from taking beaver out of season or killing<br/>
the mothers.<br/>
<br/>
Chinchilla is the finest fur of South America,<br/>
just as the silver fox is of North America; but<br/>
just as beaver was the staple of North America,<br/>
so nutria is the staple fur of South America.<br/>
Half a million nutria skins a <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>come to New<br/>
York alone from Brazil. And oddly enough,<br/>
a heavy piece of nutria could easily be <span style="color: #0000FF;">mistaken </span>for a light piece of beaver. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>is in the heaviness and natural curl and<br/>
gloss of the beaver<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Both nutria and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beaver<br/>
