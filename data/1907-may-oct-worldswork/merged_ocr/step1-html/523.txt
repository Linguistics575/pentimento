<span>WHAT THE FOOD <span style="color: #ff0000;">LAW<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, suggest themselves, for these articles of<br/>
food are often bought in bulk and resold to<br/>
the consumer in small quantities.<br/>
<br/>
SPECIMEN <span style="color: #ff0000;">LABELS<br/>
<br/>
</span>The following labels, taken at random, show<br/>
how the new law will affect some of the products in general use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TOMATO KETCHUP<br/>
<br/>
It is pronounced by connoisseurs one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>condiments for use with hot and cold meats, game, fish and<br/>
oyster stews, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This ketchup contains a combination <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>vinegar and spices, and is preserved with one tenth of 1%<br/>
benzoate of soda. No coloring matter.<br/>
<br/>
The above label could not be used now if<br/>
any coloring matter is employed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ORANGE MARMALADE FRUIT <span style="color: #ff0000;">JAM<br/>
</span>These jams are made from fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit </span>and are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest<br/>
</span>50% <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-30</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>granulated <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-wish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>corn<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">syrup-s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">benzoate </span>of soda.<br/>
<br/>
The word "fruit" on jams and jellies generally means apple juice. Most of these imitation products are given the particular fruit<br/>
or berry flavor indicated by the label from <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>coal-tar essence. This label is misleading and<br/>
the guarantee by no means insures that the<br/>
"fruit" is orange.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A CEREAL MIXTURE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Coffee </span>Sick People seldom charge their ill feelings to<br/>
the true cause.<br/>
<br/>
Analytical Chemistry shows the poisonous alkaloids of<br/>
Coffee, as in Tobacco, Whiskey and Morphine.<br/>
<br/>
A Perfectly Healthy Man or woman can stand these for<br/>
a time, but "constant dripping wears a stone," and finally<br/>
headache, torpid liver, sick stomach or heart, and that<br/>
"weak all over" feeling shows that a poisoned nervous<br/>
system is calling for help and relief.<br/>
<br/>
Small Wonder that a fixed organic disease of some of<br/>
the members is finally set up.<br/>
<br/>
Relief cannot be obtained unless the cause is removed.<br/>
<br/>
This Mixture, when brewed, takes the beautiful deep<br/>
seal brown color of Mocha or Java, changing to a rich<br/>
golden brown when cream is added.<br/>
<br/>
The above "exploitation" cannot be put on<br/>
a label under the new Food Law. It must be<br/>
reserved for bill-boards and other advertising<br/>
media.<br/>
<br/>

</span>mixed with Starch, Arrowroot or Sugar and is <span style="color: #ff0000;">therefom<br/>
</span>far more economical<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">BY </span>A PECULIAR PROCESS IN<br/>
<br/>
its manufacture which preserves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theobromine </span>and<br/>
nutritive portion, is rendered treble the strength of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cocoa<br/>
</span>as usually prepared. It yields a delicious flavor, and<br/>
is an easily digested and thoroughly wholesome Cocoa.<br/>
<br/>
There are very few simple articles of Food which possess<br/>
so many valuable and important dietary properties as<br/>
Cocoa. Medical men of all shades of opinion<br/>
have agreed in recommending it as the safest and most<br/>
beneficial article of diet for persons of weak constitution<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Excess of Oil having been Removed, no sensation<br/>
of heaviness follows the use <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this preparation.<br/>
<br/>
The sentence beginning with "medical men"<br/>
will probably be changed by October Ist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SHREDDED CODFISH<br/>
<br/>
One pound of Shredded <span style="color: #ff0000;">Codiish </span>is equal to more than<br/>
two pounds of any other fish in the market.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably an exaggerated claim.<br/>
Food Law Regulation 17, (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e</span>) says: "Descriptive<br/>
matter upon the label shall be free from any<br/>
statement, design or device regarding the article<br/>
or the ingredients or substances <span style="color: #0000FF;">contained<br/>
</span>therein, or quality thereof, or place of origin,<br/>
which are false or misleading in any particular.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>

This label does not state that the article i,<br/>
made only from quince, or from quince at all.<br/>
The guarantee given may be quite true. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>new law requires that such labels shall <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>more explicit.<br/>
