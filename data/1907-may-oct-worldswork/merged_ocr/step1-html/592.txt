<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9390 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE<br/>
</span>unearthed and mercilessly exposed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stock</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>watering of the most flagrant character has<br/>
been revealed, beginning with the original<br/>
companies, and repeated at every step in the<br/>
consolidation. Deliberate slighting of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">public </span>and ignoring of its right to adequate facilities have been shown to be the usual policy of<br/>
the New York traction companies. Officials<br/>
have been forced to the cynical confession that<br/>
the "the strap-hangers pay the dividends." It<br/>
has been discovered that one set of books was<br/>
destroyed, to prevent the discovery of certain<br/>
financial acts, presumably irregular. The<br/>
whole traction consolidation has been laid bare<br/>
before the eyes of the public as a debauched,<br/>
misguided, and totally unfit servant of the<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
This is the heart of the matter. In the<br/>
nature of things, a public utility company,<br/>
dependent upon franchises granted by the<br/>
public, is morally bound to serve the people.<br/>
The Commission has demonstrated beyond<br/>
all reasonable doubt that the New York companies have utterly failed in this duty; that they<br/>
have been conceived, financed, and operated<br/>
with an eye single to the gaining of profits by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>exploiters; and that the very people<br/>
who gave life to the companies have been made<br/>
the victims of these companies.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it is not right to forget that the<br/>
present heads of the traction companies are not<br/>
technically guilty of the worst offences uncovered by the inquisition. Many of the<br/>
offences antedate all or nearly all the present<br/>
financial officers. It is to be presumed, however, that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhcers </span>of to-day took up this<br/>
heritage of corruption, dishonesty, and trickery<br/>
with their eyes open. At any rate, the people<br/>
are in a mood to demand from the present<br/>
officers and directors a full and complete<br/>
explanation of all the irregularities. The<br/>
public is right, and the half-hearted attempt to<br/>
take refuge behind technicalities and legalities<br/>
will injure rather than assist these companies<br/>
and these individuals. It is a time for <span style="color: #0000FF;">frankness </span>and honesty, and open confession, if need<br/>
be, rather than for an attempt to fight against<br/>
an outraged public opinion by legal fence and<br/>
quibble.<br/>
<br/>
The direct results, so far, have been unfortunate. The stocks and bonds that represent<br/>
these great properties have suffered grievous<br/>
declines. In this, thousands of innocent investors have suffered. That is a pity, but it is<br/>
certainly no reason for regretting the inquisition,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>MARCH 0 <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span>EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
nor for attempting to stop it. It would be a<br/>
false and mawkish sentiment that should allow<br/>
these companies to take refuge behind the<br/>
skirts of the proverbial widow. There will<br/>
doubtless be a long and bitter <span style="color: #ff0000;">fight </span>in the courts,<br/>
an attempt to deny to this Commission, created<br/>
by the people specifically for the purpose of<br/>
investigation, the right to investigate. No<br/>
matter what the immediate outcome may be,<br/>
the ultimate end is certain. The people will<br/>
rule, no matter who oppose them.<br/>
<br/>
The lesson of the investigation and of the<br/>
coming struggle in the courts is plain enough.<br/>
There are thousands of public utility companies<br/>
throughout this country. Every one of them<br/>
must be taught that it is a servant, not a master,<br/>
of the people. The younger the company when<br/>
the lessons begin, the better for the company,<br/>
the better for the people. It is because the<br/>
New York companies have been allowed by an<br/>
indulgent executive and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">goodmatured </span>public<br/>
to grow old in sin that the companies to-day<br/>
are tottering, and their stockholders are to-day<br/>
losing their fortunes. _<br/>

THE MOBBING <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>CORPORATIONS<br/>
<br/>
HE time that has passed since Judge<br/>
<br/>
Landis fined the Standard Oil Company<br/>
more than 29 million dollars for violating the<br/>
Elkins law has won public sympathy for the<br/>
Company, and surely there has been a loss of<br/>
respect for the court; and loss of respect for<br/>
a court is a most regrettable thing.<br/>
<br/>
The lay public did not at first clearly understand the case because it has long been in the<br/>
habit of accepting every accusation made of<br/>
the Standard Oil Company as true, whether<br/>
it were an accusation made in a magazine, a<br/>
newspaper, or in court. The Company has<br/>
so long been the pet abomination of the press<br/>
and the arch-criminal of all the trusts in the<br/>
public mind that it is at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great disadvantage<br/>
in the court of public opinion. The startling<br/>
fact about its trial, in this case, and about this<br/>
colossal fine, is that it is at a similar disadvantage in a United States court. That is reason<br/>
for pause and regret.<br/>
<br/>
The Standard Oil Company of Indiana was<br/>
indicted for violating the Elkins <span style="color: #0000FF;">law-for<br/>
</span>shipping oil from Whiting, Ind. (a suburb of<br/>
Chicago), to East St. Louis, over the Chicago<br/>
and Alton Railroad, for six cents a hundred<br/>
pounds instead of eighteen cents. These facts<br/>
are undisputed: There are three railroads from<br/>
Whiting to East St. Louis, The Oil Company<br/>
