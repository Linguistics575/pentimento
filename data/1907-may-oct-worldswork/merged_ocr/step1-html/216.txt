of great shoe factories as well. Here is a<br/>
mountain city in Tennessee, then, proud of<br/>
its university and its great variety of manufactures, especially of wood and iron, and its<br/>
quarries, and-just across the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mountainsanother </span>city in Virginia where you hear talk of<br/>
shoes and tobacco and a famous college for<br/>
women which draws its patronage from all the<br/>
Southern States. Each has its machinery for<br/>
indefinite <span style="color: #0000FF;">wealth-getting </span>and for education.<br/>
Similarly in North Carolina, Charlotte, at the<br/>
foothills of the mountains, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">substratum </span>of<br/>
combined Scotch and Southern conservatism<br/>
and solidity (it is a very old-fashioned town yet<br/>
at bottom, in its social structure and in its<br/>
thought), has come to be a manufacturing city<br/>

already of great importance and of very much<br/>
greater promise. It is surrounded by cotton<br/>
mills; and it makes much machinery for cotton<br/>
mills and especially for <span style="color: #0000FF;">cottonseed-oil </span>mills.<br/>
It has nearby water-falls enough to give<br/>
uncommonly cheap power and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wheels </span>than it yet has. The people were<br/>
always sturdy and independent (it is a home<br/>
of Scotch Presbyterians), and they refuse to be<br/>
swept away from their moorings by sudden<br/>
impulses. But, in the steady growth of their<br/>
industry, they are among the best examples<br/>
of an old community that has taken on new<br/>
life without losing the old. The unusually<br/>
independent morning newspaper of the city, the<br/>
Observer-one of the best in the whole South-is a fair index both of the character and of the<br/>
enterprise of the people. It is fast becoming<br/>
one of the most important industrial centres<br/>
of the Piedmont region.<br/>

Typical of the industry of the ante-bellum period<br/>
<br/>
the whole South, the successful turning of the<br/>
Southern people to manufactures. It is one of<br/>
the busiest <span style="color: #0000FF;">manfacturing </span>places in the South,<br/>
growing all the while, at a rapid rate; and<br/>
some of its iron and steel works are now parts<br/>
of the great industrial combinations. But<br/>
every one of them was begun by individuals in<br/>
small ways; and, contrary to the general belief,<br/>
most of these individuals were poor Southern<br/>
men. Besides these large works, there are<br/>
many small manufacturing concerns, and<br/>
manufacturing concerns that <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>out small<br/>
wares, showing that the individual man may<br/>
yet have his shop there. It is a city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">diversified </span>industries. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">old-time </span>economist of Boston used to boast that there was a street of<br/>
successful workshops in that city-of many<br/>
sorts-in every one of which the proprietor<br/>
was himself a workman and that no one of them<br/>
employed more than two or three assistants.<br/>
It was a street of independent craftsmen.<br/>
Chattanooga has many such. A man may go<br/>
there who has his craft for his capital and only<br/>
himself as a workman and, if he can manage<br/>
his workman well, he may build up an independent manufacturing business. One of the<br/>
biggest plow-factories in the country began<br/>
there in that way<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
