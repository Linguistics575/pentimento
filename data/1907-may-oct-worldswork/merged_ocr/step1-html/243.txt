any party's sake, but for the growth of free<br/>
opinion and for stimulating political activity.<br/>

individual qualities and character and less by<br/>
generalizations about the whole race; and less<br/>
talk about race-problems.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>its very geography to the local history<br/>
of the people.<br/>
<br/>
Historical and economic study has been<br/>
begun in earnest by a growing body of <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trained </span>men, and it is a reasonable expectation that they will produce, in the next few<br/>
decades, noteworthy additions to the literature<br/>
of these subjects. The history of most of the<br/>
Southern States is yet adequately to be written<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-written </span>from the present wider point of view.<br/>
<br/>
THE SOUTHERN DAILY PAPERS<br/>
<br/>
HE <span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperity </span>of the Southern newspapers<br/>
is almost everywhere noticeable. In<br/>
every principal city there is one, in several<br/>
cities there are two, that yield very large incomes. And very few of them are "yellow."<br/>
The personalities of the editors count for<br/>
more than of corresponding editors in the<br/>
Northern States, or even in the West, as a rule.<br/>
The editor has something of the personal<br/>
authority that he had in the North two generations or more ago.<br/>
<br/>
There is only one Republican daily paper in<br/>
all the old Southern States. But most of the<br/>
best papers give less emphasis to <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>party<br/>
politics (certainly between campaigns) than<br/>
they used to give. They publish more matter<br/>
about education and about the schools (it<br/>
might almost be said) than all the other daily<br/>
papers in the country combined. They report<br/>
and discuss also with great fulness the new<br/>
industrial activity. The Richmond (Virginia) Times-Dispatch, for instance, gives a<br/>
large space once a week to a general review<br/>
of industrial activity throughout its wide<br/>
territory. It publishes also a page a week<br/>
devoted wholly to educational news in Virginia,<br/>
and many other newspapers do the same thing;<br/>
and it conducts a free "teachers' bureau."<br/>
<br/>
But they all have this peculiarity: If you<br/>
ride from Washington to Houston, Tex.,<br/>
around the seaboard, and buy a copy of every<br/>
daily paper published along the route, you<br/>
will read many editorials about the <span style="color: #ff0000;">raceproblem</span>, all saying the same thing. From<br/>
Houston, Tex., further west, you will miss<br/>

<br/>
that topic till you come back again into Louisiana or Arkansas. Then all the way back to<br/>
Washington, you will read the same editorials<br/>
over again.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Rev. John E. White, a patriotic<br/>
citizen and a vigorous Baptist <span style="color: #0000FF;">minister </span>in<br/>
Atlanta, who once said that the Southern<br/>
people had gone talk-mad about the Negro.<br/>
The subject surely never rests.<br/>
<br/>
The Southern press has an intense local<br/>
patriotism; it puts itself at the service of all<br/>
good causes-schools, good roads, public<br/>
improvements, and helpful activity in all its<br/>
forms; and most of these papers preserve<br/>
certain old-time ways that interest you. For<br/>
example, you will see a column headed tt <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hymenmal</span>," and another "Mortuary." "Marriages"<br/>
and "Deaths," for some reason, do not seem<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fill </span>the bill. But they have a real dignity<br/>
(at least between campaigns) as well as a<br/>
verbal rotundity.<br/>

</span>ABOUT GOING SOUTH, YOUNG MAN<br/>
<br/>
0 SOUTH, young man; but do not <span style="color: #0000FF;">go<br/>
</span>unless you are willing and able to do <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>man's work. The trouble from which these<br/>
states have suffered overmuch already is men<br/>
who were not willing to do full men's work.<br/>
But, if you throw away illusions about quick<br/>
wealth and get rid of a number of false notions<br/>
that you have probably heard about the country<br/>
and the people, and apply yourself to some<br/>
productive industry for which you <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>fitted by<br/>
temperament and training, you may easily<br/>
build a fortune, large or small, <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to your<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
