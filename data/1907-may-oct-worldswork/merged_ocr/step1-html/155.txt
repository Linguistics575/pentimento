<span>THE RAILROADS' WORK IN THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
A PLEA FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">ROADS<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
the vast natural resources of the Southern<br/>
<br/>
States rightly attracts marked attention.<br/>
During the last two decades the progress of<br/>
the South has, from an industrial, <span style="color: #0000FF;">agricultural</span>,<br/>
and commercial <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viewpoint</span>, been marvelous.<br/>
No section of our great country is advancing<br/>
materially with greater rapidity than is the<br/>
territory south of the Potomac and Ohio<br/>
Rivers.<br/>
<br/>
While much has been accomplished, there<br/>
is much more to be done and the people of the<br/>
South should unitedly work for its uninterrupted development. The field is promising<br/>
for more <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories </span>and an increased<br/>
development of the agricultural interests of the<br/>
South. All measures purely antagonistic to<br/>
the betterment and increase of transportation<br/>
facilities should therefore be discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Laws favorable to the investment of capital<br/>
in railroads are as essential as laws controlling<br/>
any other form of property. No other kind<br/>
of property has been so potent in promoting<br/>
the growth of the country as has the railroad.<br/>
Without it, settlement and population would<br/>
still be restricted to the ocean shores and interior waterways.<br/>
<br/>
The combined wealth of Virginia, North<br/>
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,<br/>
and Mississippi, as given by the last census, is<br/>
not equal to that of Massachusetts alone. The<br/>
wealth of New York is three times that of<br/>
Massachusetts, while that of Pennsylvania is<br/>
more than twice that of the Bay State. The<br/>
area of Massachusetts is not half that of any<br/>
Southern state named, and in no single resource or particular is it as bountifully favored<br/>
as any state of the South. It is, however,<br/>
favored with a skilled population busy putting<br/>
large values into raw materials from the South<br/>
and other states, and it is prospering accordingly.<br/>
Very little is heard or said of local restriction<br/>
of transportation and manufacturing enter<br/>
/ I IHE rapid and substantial development of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">prises </span>in Massachusetts and in other rich and<br/>
growing Eastern and Northern States, and it is<br/>
not probable that any displeasure will be felt<br/>
there if oppressive measures are put into force<br/>
in the South and West, where recent industrial<br/>
growth is affecting Northeastern values.<br/>
The South is now in its period of greatest<br/>
industrial and commercial growth. There is<br/>
room for a still greater growth in both population and wealth. A comparison of nine Southeastern States, in number of persons to the<br/>
square mile, with nine Northeastern States of<br/>
the Republic, is seen in the following table<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>

The South is now in a critical stage in its<br/>
industrial upbuilding. Technical training and<br/>
individual and corporate freedom should not<br/>
be unnecessarily hampered, or else dominance<br/>
will be maintained in sections less favored in<br/>
respect to natural resources. Massachusetts<br/>
is great because of the union of effort and<br/>
harmony among all classes in promoting<br/>
industries, and in having labor able to change<br/>
cotton into laces instead of jeans, and ore into<br/>
needles and pins instead of pig iron. It is<br/>
not enough that we have marvelous natural<br/>
resources. Through industrial and corporate<br/>
and individual freedom, our resources have<br/>
been unfolded and our country has won its<br/>
crowning place in commerce and manufactures.<br/>
In this development the railroad has been<br/>
one of the chief factors.<br/>
<br/>
The prominence of the railroad as a factor<br/>
in the business of the country naturally attracts<br/>
<br/>
