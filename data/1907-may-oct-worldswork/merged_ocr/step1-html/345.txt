<span>TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
"mixed." He would have shrivelled to a<br/>
dyspeptic skeleton had he not "mixed." He<br/>
was the most democratic man in his class.<br/>
He has never had any fads or fancies, except<br/>
as an alumnus of Yale; he "roots" for Yale<br/>
and sings Yale songs, even far away in a<br/>
Philippine jungle, and is ready at the drop of a<br/>
hat to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight </span>at any <span style="color: #0000FF;">reaction </span>on Yale. So what<br/>
must he have been when at Yale? He was the<br/>
most popular man there in many a day. How<br/>
he loved good stories and how the man could<br/>
laugh! It was not a coarse, boisterous guffaw,<br/>
but a laugh of the hearty, kindly simplicity of<br/>
soul, and of the genial overbubbling of a big<br/>
heart. The boys at Yale felt that, and they<br/>
were glad straight off. And then he was so<br/>
safe and comforting, no wonder that in college<br/>
and afterward everybody went to him for<br/>
advice! He always had sympathy for the<br/>
troubled one and there was the feeling that he<br/>
would go to the bottom of the question and<br/>
come up with a cheery bit of wholesome discourse. No wonder, again, that his popularity<br/>
naturally and simply took the measure of universal affection! And, of course, he was a<br/>
leader, as always before. Everywhere he was<br/>
active in the college life.<br/>
<br/>
He rowed, boxed, wrestled, played football,<br/>
and worked in the gymnasium-just as he<br/>
"observed all the social niceties," dressed well,<br/>
and associated with the girls. He was impelled<br/>
to the exercising of his splendid, untrained<br/>
frame by what may be described as a humorously sordid motive. That is, he merely<br/>
wanted to keep in shape, not for athletic<br/>
prowess, but that he could keep awake to a<br/>
yet smaller hour of the morning for <span style="color: #0000FF;">grinding-enlightened </span>grinding. He applied Herbert<br/>
Spencer's dictum to the letter-to be a good<br/>
man you must be "a good animal." He was<br/>
lucky, as in other things, with the gift of<br/>
physique, but just as in other things, he did<br/>
not squander the principal of the gift. He<br/>
added to it, and there has never been any question about "Bill" Taft being "a good animal."<br/>
<br/>
Some of the best stories of his strength<br/>
date from Yale. His were exploits to <span style="color: #0000FF;">intensify </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Varsity</span>'s chagrin over not being<br/>
able to claim him for the Eleven. His immense<br/>
figure, never gross nor beefy but a mass of<br/>
clean flesh and sinew, was much more wieldy<br/>
now, even as the good jaws and chin were<br/>
getting outline in the round face. There were<br/>
a celerity and a certainty in his movements<br/>
that made him, and still make him, an extraor<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9143<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dinarily </span>light and graceful dancer. He was<br/>
perhaps more ready, however, for a rush or a<br/>
fray of some kind.<br/>
<br/>
He and Herbert W. Bowen, later Minister<br/>
to Venezuela, were physically the two biggest<br/>
men in the class of 1878. They used to wrestle<br/>
together and the score was about even between<br/>
them until the very last, during commencement<br/>
week, when Taft got the <span style="color: #0000FF;">better </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>it <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>farewell<br/>
bout. As a freshman, he had already put one<br/>
"soph" champion after another on a mat in<br/>
the gymnasium; and later, as a "soph," he<br/>
did this: There was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>day in Hamilton<br/>
Park and the class of'78, Taft's class, was not<br/>
faring well. The old enemy, now the junior<br/>
class, was disposed to gloat. Then came the<br/>
tug-of-war, and at the first trial the'78 team<br/>
lost. Taft could <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>stand it no longer. He<br/>
threw off his coat, grabbed the end of the rope<br/>
and squatted firmly.<br/>
<br/>
"Now then," he said, angrily, "let the whole<br/>
junior class get on the other end!"<br/>
<br/>
The'78 men yelled joyfully. For once "Old<br/>
Bill" had been provoked into an official contest.<br/>
The tug-of-war proceeded with him helping<br/>
on the end, but the juniors might as well<br/>
have tried to pull up Gibraltar.<br/>
<br/>
Like all collegians in their normally abnormal<br/>
state, Taft imbibed brave, pure notions of public<br/>
affairs, and was fretted by exalted ideas as to<br/>
how the sovereign people should be governed.<br/>
Judge Taft was then in the national Administration, and the son at Yale, as he frankly confesses, was impatient with his father for not<br/>
seeming to value the "importance of pursuing<br/>
the up-to-date principles that should govern<br/>
the policy to be pursued by public men."<br/>
He adds, however, that "the step down from<br/>
senior year to a struggle for a living has a<br/>
healthy tendency in moderating this certainty<br/>
and severity of view."<br/>
<br/>
With him, and with most of his classmates,<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">laissevjaire </span>doctrine made a particular<br/>
appeal. They held "that the only proper<br/>
object of legislation was to free the pathway<br/>
of commerce and opportunity from the effect<br/>
of everything but competition and enlightened<br/>
selfishness." They even looked on the governmental delivery of letters with suspicion as a<br/>
pernicious interference. Further, Secretary<br/>
Taft declared only a little while ago that he<br/>
still thought these principles orthodox and<br/>
sound, "if only the official application of them<br/>
is not carried to such an extreme as really to<br/>
interfere with the public welfare." This is<br/>
