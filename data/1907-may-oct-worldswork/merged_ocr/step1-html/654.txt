have no idea what those magic words may<br/>
portend, or what they have to do with<br/>
sending "a letter to my love." That does not<br/>
matter at all.<br/>
<br/>
They can never keep still when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">handorgan </span>man comes around. It is a pretty<br/>
sight to see a crowd of happy youngsters on<br/>
the city street, dancing and skipping for joy<br/>
about the hurdy-gurdy. And they invent<br/>
dancing games and songs for themselves, this<br/>
small race of poets and mimics, never minding<br/>
what the sense may be, if only they get a chance<br/>
for active rhythmical expression.<br/>
<br/>
Surely this is the golden time in a man's life,<br/>
if there ever is one, for the cultivation and<br/>
development of this wonderful sense-a sense<br/>
which, if it is once given its due, opens up<br/>
many avenues into what is beautiful and noble.<br/>
<br/>
So far the scheme has been formally adopted<br/>
in New York only for girls. Whether, under<br/>
present conditions, equally good results could be<br/>
obtained in classes for boys is not altogether<br/>
clear, though some of the more vigorous hornpipes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flings </span>have been tried with them with<br/>
great success. But there is the right moment<br/>
for the beginning of any new movement. At<br/>
present the school-boys of New York have a<br/>
highly organized system of athletic games<br/>
which is bringing splendid results, both for<br/>
those who are naturally athletic and for those<br/>
who would keep altogether on the outside.<br/>
An innovation may not be desirable at this<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Neither is it yet certain just what dances<br/>
will prove the best suited for our American<br/>
conditions. Some of the spirited and char<br/>
OUR TOWN LIFE-WHAT IS IT WORTH?<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">acteristic </span>folk-dances of Sweden and Russia<br/>
have so far seemed to make the very greatest<br/>
appeal to the children. Great care is always<br/>
taken to have the accompanying music appropriate and distinctive, for the music and<br/>
the dance are organically related.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptations and changes there must of course<br/>
be. The dances are intended to meet the<br/>
needs of American children; they must relate<br/>
themselves to American conditions; and much<br/>
of their value would be lost through too strict<br/>
an adherence to the traditional letter of the<br/>
performance.<br/>
<br/>
Our national temperament, enthusiastic and<br/>
spontaneous, needs just such an outlet for its<br/>
surplus emotional energy. But one thing is<br/>
certain<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>any such growth must be from within.<br/>
There would be small use in instituting a<br/>
festival if there were no inner festival spirit.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the New Orleans Mardi Gras, in the Harvest<br/>
Homes of some Western cities, with their<br/>
pageants and ceremonies, in the Carnival at<br/>
Quebec, in the vividly remembered Dewey<br/>
Reception in New York, in the religious and<br/>
national Observances of all European countries, we see rational and appropriate expressions of this spirit.<br/>
<br/>
There is every reason for believing that a<br/>
country in which the children had been given<br/>
a chance to develop their natural instinct for<br/>
rhythmical and harmonious activity would<br/>
have a national life far richer, deeper, and<br/>
more beautiful than one where the main emphasis in education was upon bare intellectual<br/>
training for the purposes of "practical success." It is at least worth thinking about.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>E USED to have a "plaza" in our<br/>
town, where the hoboes rested in<br/>
<br/>
the shade at noon, and where at<br/>
<br/>
night twice a week we went to hear the band<br/>
concerts. Now we have a "courthouse park."<br/>
It is the same thirteen acres of grass and trees<br/>
and flowers, with the same courthouse in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>centre. But we call it by a different name. The<br/>
<br/>
transition from "plaza" to "courthouse park"<br/>
in our vocabulary marks the path of our<br/>
evolution from a frontier town in California,<br/>
with many traces of Mexican influence in our<br/>
"lingo," to a civilized modern little city<br/>
dominated intellectually by New England<br/>
