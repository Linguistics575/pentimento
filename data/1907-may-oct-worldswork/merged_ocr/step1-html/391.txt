There is one gigantic enterprise now nearing<br/>
completion that will turn nearly every wheel in<br/>
the valley of Mexico within a radius of 200<br/>
miles. As a colossal hydro-electric proposition<br/>
it is of especial interest Also, it is one conspicuous example of the foreigner's faith in<br/>
Mexico, being the largest single investment of<br/>
capital outside of railroad building. The sum<br/>
is $ 31,000,000, and this sum comes, not from<br/>
the United States, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Canada. The investor is the Bank of Montreal. Its representatives<br/>
appeared in the sleepy old one-horse-car town<br/>
of Puebla with $ 6,000,000. They gave that<br/>
town electric light, electric power, and trolley<br/>
cars. Then they went to the capital, and<br/>
bought the street-car system for $ 11,250,000.<br/>
They bought the lighting plants, and cut rates<br/>
in half. They could cut rates because they<br/>
had cheap power that was costing them the<br/>
balance of the millions. This power comes<br/>
from the Necaxa waterfall, ninety-five miles<br/>
away. In the dry season Necaxa shrinks from<br/>
a roaring cataract of 3,000 cubic feet a second<br/>
to a feeble, trickling brooklet. To make the<br/>
average good the year round, the Canadians are<br/>
walling up three great valleys. Six thousand<br/>
men are now at work on one of the dams, which<br/>
alone will cost a million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Since the mountains were stripped of their<br/>
forests, the cost of coal has stifled industries<br/>
in this region. But the Canadians count on a<br/>
manufacturing boom. They expect to market<br/>
the full 200,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">horsepower </span>capacity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Necaxa </span>falls. The big stamp mills at the El Oro<br/>
mines, 200 miles distant, are now run by power<br/>
from the falls, and ores are handled <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>per cent.<br/>
lower in value than could be handled before.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">goo-mile </span>line of transmission is said to be<br/>
the longest in the world from a single powerhouse. The company is delivering thousands<br/>
of horse power to the larger cities. Thirty<br/>
thousand will soon be available for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Guadalajara</span>, and 50,000 in the capital.<br/>
<br/>
Another striking instance of hydro-electric<br/>
power and its vitalizing effects is that of the<br/>
old deserted mining camp of Guanajuato.<br/>
This camp, worked by the old Spaniards, has<br/>
