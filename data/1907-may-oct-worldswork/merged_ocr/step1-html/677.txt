the glory and the shame of the savings banks. It is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">attempt </span>to make interesting and vital one<br/>
of the greatest public questions of the day, hitherto obscured from the eyes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the people by techni<br/>

</span>"I might have <span style="color: #0000FF;">converted </span>my interests into gold at one<br/>
time and have taken my money to England<span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>"<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">John </span>D. Rockefeller. quoted by the New York World.<br/>
<br/>
OULD it be done? I asked that question<br/>
of several of the prominent financial<br/>
critics of the United States. They all<br/>
<br/>
said, without hesitation, "No!" Then they<br/>
all took it back, that flat practical negative,<br/>
and began to theorize. At the end of the careful syllogism, each reached the conclusion that<br/>
it could be done, but that in the doing of it the<br/>
fortune of the great experimenter would shrink<br/>
marvelously, and that the finance and industry<br/>
of the United States would be left a pitiful<br/>
wreck.<br/>
<br/>
Practically, then, it is not to be feared that<br/>
any such attempt will be made. The strongest<br/>
argument against its practicability seems to<br/>
be that in the process it would be impossible<br/>
to keep from the knowledge of the banks the<br/>
fact that such an effort was under way, and that<br/>
the banks would act in concert to make it<br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, it could be done. Let us suppose that<br/>
a clique of great financiers, men of huge wealth,<br/>
retired from the most active pursuits, yet still<br/>
in business, had determined to teach the United<br/>
States a lesson. Let us imagine them piqued,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">humiliated</span>, angered beyond measure by the<br/>
attitude of the Executive, harassed by the labor<br/>
unions, goaded by popular baiting and newspaper obloquy into a frame of mind conducive<br/>
to hatred and malice. We shall suppose that,<br/>
<br/>
together, they command properties and securities that are worth in the markets to-day a<br/>
billion dollars. It will include real estate, and<br/>
stocks and bonds of all classes.<br/>
<br/>
Let us imagine that there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>conspirators, and that they have met together in a<br/>
magnificent private dining-room in New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yak<br/>
</span>City. One, we shall say, is a great industrialist,<br/>
a maker of trusts, who has been bitterly assailed<br/>
by Government and people. Another is a<br/>
railroad magnate, whose lofty ambitions have<br/>
brought down upon his head the obloquy of<br/>
press and people. The third is a mighty<br/>
banker, one whose hand has always been ready<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-organization</span>, for promotion, for high<br/>
finance in all its phases. The hands of the<br/>
fourth are the hands of a laborer, for he has<br/>
worked his way from the forge and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>to<br/>
a place near the top of the list of the kings of<br/>
Steel. The fifth is a Wall Street gambler,<br/>
yesterday poor and of little account; to-day<br/>
rich, a maker of markets, master of the art of<br/>
speculation. Each is a type. It is not the<br/>
intention of the writer to point to any particular<br/>
railroad man, or any particular banker. The<br/>
world of finance, in our day, has produced and<br/>
will continue to produce many who might <span style="color: #0000FF;">fill<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roles</span>. It would be <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>, perhaps, to<br/>
find in the United States to-day a maker of<br/>
trusts, a great financial banker, a leader of<br/>
speculation who has no grievance, real or<br/>
fancied, against the Government, against labor,<br/>
or against the people. The conditions <span style="color: #ff0000;">are<br/>
<br/>
