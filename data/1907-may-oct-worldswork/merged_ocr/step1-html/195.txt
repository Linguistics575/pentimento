<span>THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
are due to Wofford College. The ability to<br/>
see the profits in good schools, good roads,<br/>
good water, and sewerage plants is the mark of<br/>
an educated community. If Wofford College<br/>
had never graduated a distinguished scholar,<br/>
it would still rank as an efficient educational<br/>
institution, for it has trained a community to<br/>
have a far-sighted public spirit.<br/>
<br/>
The influence of education in the future will<br/>
be greater than it has been, for Wofford is no<br/>
longer alone. There is now an adequate<br/>
public-school system to support it. Last year<br/>
one person in every six in the town was enrolled as a scholar at the public schools. Besides this, Wofford maintains a high school<br/>
which has itself doubled in numbers in the last<br/>
five years. There is a new science hall at<br/>
Wofford, the gift of a mill president of Spartanburg. There is a girls' seminary just outside<br/>
of town and a girls' college in it. This college<br/>
was founded in a typically American way.<br/>
About the time the Spartan Mill was built, one<br/>
of its promoters asked Mr. Converse to move<br/>
into town. He replied that he was thinking<br/>
of going to Washington to educate his daughter.<br/>
He could not educate her in Spartanburg, he<br/>
said, because there was no girls' college there.<br/>
<br/>
"What's the reason we can't have one?"<br/>
said the other man. No reason was found<br/>
sufficient even to delay the founding. A stock<br/>
company was formed and in 1890 Converse<br/>
College was built. On Saturday, January 2,<br/>
1902, the school burned down. On the for.<br/>
lowing Monday a meeting was called and in<br/>
thirty minutes enough money raised to rebuild<br/>
the college better than before. People in<br/>
Spartanburg now look upon the fire as a godsend. When the stock company was formed,<br/>
the stockholders supposed that the college<br/>
would be self-supporting or perhaps might<br/>
even pay a small dividend. When they found<br/>
that the kind of an institution which they<br/>
wanted would not pay dividends, they gave the<br/>
property to a board of trustees and from time<br/>
to time during the next eight years Mr. Converse, who had been the largest stockholder,<br/>
helped the college with money. He died in<br/>
1899. In his will he left the college one-third<br/>
of his fortune. The smokestacks are responsible for the money and the education for the<br/>
wise use of it.<br/>
<br/>
Nor is the influence of these institutions confined to their students. The presence of the<br/>
faculties has an effect on the town. In 1894,<br/>
the professor of music at Converse organized<br/>
<br/>
8993<br/>
<br/>
a musical festival. One has been held every<br/>
year since and during that time they have had<br/>
"The Messiah," "Elijah," "Faust," "Aida,"<br/>
and many other notable performances.<br/>
Thomas's Orchestra has played at the festivals<br/>
and Madame Nordica, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Madame </span>Louise Homer,<br/>
Signor Campanari, and many other distinguished visitors have sung. The professor<br/>
of music Who organized the festivals has gone<br/>
away but the appreciation of good music has<br/>
been developed in the town so that the festivals<br/>
go on as successfully as before. The attendance has been such that the guarantee fund<br/>
promised by citizens of Spartanburg has never<br/>
been needed. At other places in the Piedmont similar things have happened, for this<br/>
section<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>is the centre of an educational transformation as significant as the revival of<br/>
industry. At Columbus, the profits of the cotton mills have been used to establish trade<br/>
schools for all the people. At Durham, N. C.,<br/>
commercial prosperity has built up one of the<br/>
most amply endowed small colleges in the<br/>
United States.<br/>
<br/>
The people of Spartanburg are now <span style="color: #0000FF;">commercially </span>and intellectually a part of the world.<br/>
Spartanburg goods are sold along the Red Sea<br/>
and in China; its people have Italian and<br/>
German opera at home. They travel in their<br/>
own country and abroad.<br/>
<br/>
The economic benefits of the mills will become more apparent in the future, for the<br/>
transformation of a people's habits cannot be<br/>
done in one generation.<br/>
<br/>
FACTORY LIFE AND CHILD LABOR<br/>
<br/>
When Mr. Converse was running the old<br/>
Glendale Mill he knew, personally, the people<br/>
who worked for him. Many of the older<br/>
employees had special privileges. He was<br/>
known among them as the "old man<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>term<br/>
of affection and regard. But he was an exceptional employer. In many of the mills the<br/>
operatives were not so well off. The wages<br/>
paid were high enough to attract large numbers<br/>
of people from the farms and mountains.<br/>
There was more mill labor than there was<br/>
demand for it. The mills in which the worst<br/>
conditions prevailed could get a full complement of "hands" as well as those that spent<br/>
some of their profits in making better tenements<br/>
and in building schools. Just the opposite<br/>
condition holds true now. There is hardly<br/>
a mill in the Carolinas that can keep all of its<br/>
machinery going the year round. The labor<br/>
