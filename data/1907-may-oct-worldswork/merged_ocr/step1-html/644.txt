</span>his arrival. In his inaugural speech, he told<br/>
the Filipinos that he would work for them first<br/>
of all, and all <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span>and they believed him.<br/>
A year later the dearest ambition of his life<br/>
was within his reach-a seat on the Supreme<br/>
Bench of the United States. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">general<br/>
<br/>
</span>public <span style="color: #0000FF;">already </span>understood that this was to be<br/>
his reward for his service in the Philippines.<br/>
And now, when the reward <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>at hand, he<br/>
realized that he was needed yet longer in the<br/>
Philippines, and he <span style="color: #0000FF;">declined </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>appointment.<br/>

</span>President Roosevelt urged him <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second time;<br/>
in his peremptory <span style="color: #0000FF;">way</span>, he made it practically<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>command. Thereupon the Filipinos, and<br/>
all others who had the Philippine question at<br/>
heart, requested that the President reconsider.<br/>
Governor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>earnestly seconded the appeal.<br/>
He put it on the ground of conscience.<br/>
<br/>
"All right, old fellow!" the President cabled<br/>
back, "you can stay."<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, a more urgent summons had<br/>
already brought him back, for a time, to the<br/>
United States. The people desired an account<br/>
"Now it is not good for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>health to <span style="color: #0000FF;">hustle<br/>

</span>For the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">riles </span>and the Aryan smiles, and he<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">weareth </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Christian </span>down<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
<br/>
</span>And the <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>fight <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>tombstone white with the<br/>
name of the late deceased<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">And </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">epitaph </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">drear</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fool </span>lies here who tried to<br/>

</span>But, in this case, "the Aryan brown" was <span style="color: #0000FF;">waiting </span>outside the Governor's palace, anxiously<br/>
watching the bulletins that told of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian</span>'s progress toward recovery.<br/>
