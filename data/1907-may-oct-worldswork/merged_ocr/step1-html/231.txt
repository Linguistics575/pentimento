<span>A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN <span style="color: #ff0000;">STATES </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9029<br/>
<br/>
</span>They will recall yellow-fever epidemics, <span style="color: #0000FF;">forgetting </span>that yellow fever has now no more<br/>
terrors for the South than smallpox has for the<br/>
North. They think of bad water. Yet Jacksonville, Fla., for instance, has its water-works<br/>
in the very heart of the city, where the supply<br/>
comes from artesian wells, and its death-rate<br/>
(of the whites) is among the lowest of the<br/>
cities of the United States. The same freedom<br/>
from disease is found in Savannah, and, indeed,<br/>
in most of the coast cities.<br/>
<br/>
So, too, of the people as well as of places:<br/>
While men elsewhere have been talking and<br/>
writing of "crackers" and "poor white trash,"<br/>
the sons of the people that they have been<br/>
writing about have built fine residences on the<br/>
"swell" streets of every Southern city. They<br/>
are manufacturers and bankers and the leaders<br/>
of great enterprises; or they are the owners of<br/>
cotton farms, or of cabbage farms or of lettuce<br/>
farms, or of lumber mills, and of everything<br/>
else that denotes prosperity. The sons of some<br/>
of the men who were rich generations ago<br/>
are also, of course, doing similar tasks. The<br/>
point is that the Southern man or the Southern<br/>
land of the old books and of the romances is<br/>
now not representative and is, in fact, often<br/>
hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">am </span>tired of the incredulity of men," <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>long-time resident of Florida-a man who went<br/>
there from Iowa many years ago. <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>When I go to<br/>
see my own kinspeople, they expect me to talk<br/>
about alligators and chills and fevers. I never<br/>
see an alligator except the little ones that are<br/>
caught for tourists, and I have never had chills<br/>
and fevers nor any other illness since I left<br/>
Iowa. I have an artesian well and my home<br/>
is drained-as many homes in Iowa are not.<br/>
Chicago has more sunstrokes in one summer,<br/>
I venture to say, than Florida has had since the<br/>
white man first came here. And there are<br/>
better roads about this town and more automobiles than in any town of the same size in<br/>
Iowa."<br/>
<br/>
Sanitation and intensive culture of the soil<br/>
and the general organization of industry by<br/>
modern methods have, of course, brought<br/>
changes so rapidly in the seaboard <span style="color: #0000FF;">South</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>those communities where there has been a<br/>
modern organization-that the changes are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">well-nigh </span>incredible. And they run through<br/>
the whole range of life-from every-day work<br/>
to the warp and woof of men's thought and<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
A countryman who wore home-made clothes<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9029<br/>
<br/>
</span>and lived meanly used to go from one of the<br/>
lower counties of Georgia to the legislature<br/>
at Atlanta. He was a clodhopper. Last winter, when an agricultural school was to be built<br/>
in his county and subscriptions were asked for<br/>
it, this man gave his check for $ 1,000. One<br/>
of the higher State officers, who had known<br/>
him in Atlanta during his legislative days,<br/>
asked the local banker if that old fellow's<br/>
check were good for $ 1,000. "Good for<br/>
$ 50,000," was the answer. "How did he do<br/>
it?" "Lumber and long-staple cotton." Yet,<br/>
even in Atlanta, they yet think of that man as<br/>
a clodhopper in home-made clothes. Even<br/>
they forget what a man may do in lower Georgia<br/>
in ten years.<br/>
<br/>
It was in Florida also-at Sanford-that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>man told me this story. We were standing<br/>
in his field of celery.<br/>
<br/>
"Every one of those rows of celery is worth<br/>
as much as a bale of cotton. It requires at<br/>
least two acres in South Carolina, where I<br/>
came from, to produce a bale of cotton. In<br/>
these two fields there are 400 rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">celery</span>$ 20,000. These two fields here, then, of about<br/>
twelve acres, will provide a crop as valuable<br/>
as the cotton produced on 400 acres of ordinary<br/>
South Carolina land. See?<br/>
<br/>
"Well, last summer I offered my own brother<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>for celery here. He said he couldn't<br/>
afford to leave his cotton farm.<br/>
<br/>
"'Haven't you some enemy?' I asked him,<br/>
'some man whom you wish to punish? Give<br/>
him your old cotton farm and go to Florida<br/>
with me and you'll get rich.'<br/>
<br/>
"He <span style="color: #0000FF;">has</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n't </span>come. My own brother regards<br/>
me as a visionary and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thinks </span>of Florida as a<br/>
home of alligators."<br/>
<br/>
Stories like these you can pick up all the way<br/>
from Chesapeake Bay to Aransas Pass, in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Texas</span>; for the coast is fast coming to be a vast<br/>
fruit and vegetable garden, as well as the home<br/>
of larger industries.<br/>
<br/>
In the seaboard South these words denote<br/>
fortune and opportunity-cotton (short and<br/>
long staples); sea food; lumber; truck and<br/>
fruit; rice.<br/>
<br/>
The profits of agriculture in this region,<br/>
especially, if we may assume that cotton will<br/>
continue to fetch <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>cents a pound or more,<br/>
are probably larger (and they will become<br/>
larger yet) than in any other extensive area.<br/>
<br/>
Of the coast cities, Norfolk will be a great<br/>
port-one of the great world ports, perhaps.<br/>
It has the best harbor on the Southern coast;<br/>
