whole, all reach a higher and more significant<br/>
stage of individual freedom than is possible<br/>
on the unorganized, free-for-all playground.<br/>
<br/>
The problem to be worked out, then, was to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the form of organized play which would<br/>
bring the greatest amount of good to <span style="color: #0000FF;">each<br/>
</span>child. Careful tests have proved that it could<br/>
not be found in gymnastics. There one has<br/>

<br/>
</span>but gymnastic exercises are primarily for the<br/>
body. Play is for the whole child-for his<br/>
heart, mind, and imagination, as well as for<br/>
his arms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">legs</span>, and chest.<br/>
<br/>
Play is far more important than mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">muscular </span>activity. It is the most natural and the most<br/>
potent <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">child</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>personality.<br/>

<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">element </span>of control, but it's not play.<br/>
Gymnastics have their place, and an important<br/>
one, in the routine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>school <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">They<br/>

schoolroom <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">constant </span>bending over<br/>

When the proposal was made to take up<br/>
dancing in the schools as an exercise for girls,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span>things were said in its <span style="color: #0000FF;">favor</span>, and all were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">worth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">considering</span>. The first was that in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">limited </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>of the gymnasium, the roof playground, or the school basement, a larger number of children could be handled at <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>in a<br/>
dance than in any other way. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">second<br/>
