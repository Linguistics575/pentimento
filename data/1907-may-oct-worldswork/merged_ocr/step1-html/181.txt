<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THAT<br/>
<br/>
</span>IS <span style="color: #ff0000;">SUPERSEDING </span>THE OLD-TIME ORATORY<br/>
BY<br/>
<br/>
EDWIN MIMS<br/>
<br/>
PROFESSOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>ENGLISH LITERATURE, TRINITY COLLEGE, N. <span style="color: #ff0000;">C.<br/>
<br/>
</span>was the orator held in such high<br/>
<br/>
repute as in the South before the war.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mr. </span>William Garrott Brown, in an illuminating<br/>
essay on William L. Yancey, makes this <span style="color: #0000FF;">observation </span>on the ante-bellum South:<br/>
<br/>
PERHAPS in no other part of the world<br/>
<br/>
"It was the spoken word, not the printed page, <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
<br/>
</span>guided thought, aroused enthusiasm, made history.<br/>
These were the true universities of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lower </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">South-the<br/>
</span>law <span style="color: #0000FF;">courts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the great religious and political <span style="color: #0000FF;">gatherings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>truly <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a grove was the university of Athens. The<br/>
man who wished to lead or to teach must be able to speak.<br/>
He could not touch the artistic sense of the people with<br/>
pictures, or statues, or verse, or plays; he must charm<br/>
them with voice and gesture."<br/>
<br/>
Within the memory of even a young man, the<br/>
decline of the orator's power in the South may<br/>
be traced, and a corresponding increase in the<br/>
power of the written word. Mr. Joel Chandler<br/>
Harris wrote in reply to an invitation to deliver<br/>
an address at a Southern university: "I would<br/>
not make a speech for one million dollars."<br/>
An increasing number of men-men of power<br/>
and influence-are not ashamed to make<br/>
the same confession. The old-time "ranter"<br/>
is hard to overcome, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>be said that ten<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>write their speeches to every one who<br/>
did twenty years ago; hence we have less emotionalism, and a greater precision and accuracy<br/>
in speaking. I have known more than one man<br/>
whose intellectual life has been revolutionized<br/>
by the process of weighing carefully his words<br/>
and stating concisely and pointedly his meaning.<br/>
<br/>
This change may be seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in academic celebrations. Recently the address at<br/>
an important civic celebration of a college in<br/>
North Carolina was delivered by a business<br/>
man who spoke in a plain, practical way on<br/>
"Work." People heard him gladly because<br/>
he was a commonwealth-builder and he had<br/>
something to say that went to the heart of<br/>
<br/>
things<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The same change may be seen in the<br/>
orations of college students. A politician of<br/>
the old school, on listening to the orations of a<br/>
certain college commencement, complained<br/>
that boys were no longer sophomoric, that they<br/>
were actually trying to convince an audience<br/>
of truths in which they believed.<br/>
<br/>
I lay stress on this point because it seems to<br/>
me one of the most significant facts with regard to the contemporary South. An outsider<br/>
who wishes to know the South of to-day, or at<br/>
least the South of the future, should look for<br/>
it, not in the Congressional Record nor in the<br/>
Southern speeches quoted with such relish in<br/>
the New York Sun, but in the more important<br/>
addresses that have been delivered at various<br/>
educational meetings of the past decade. More<br/>
than one of these addresses, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">subsequent<br/>
</span>publication, has influenced Southern opinion<br/>
profoundly.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the change in the style of public<br/>
address has come a pronounced activity in the<br/>
direction of writing. During the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">190576<br/>
</span>some <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>or thirty books were written<br/>
by North Carolinians--ten of them being<br/>
brought out by the leading publishers of the<br/>
country. The list included a book on syntax<br/>
that has won the approbation of the leading<br/>
English scholars of the world; a scientific discussion of education; a text-book on economics,<br/>
already adopted by many colleges and high<br/>
schools; two books on the cotton industry and<br/>
the changes caused thereby; a history of<br/>
Methodism in North Carolina based on a study<br/>
of documentary material collected by the<br/>
author; a history of the Federalist system<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-one </span>of the volumes in the American Nation<br/>
series; several historical studies, ranging<br/>
from doctoral dissertations to more elaborate<br/>
treatises; a biography of the leading Southern<br/>
poets since the war; a book of sketches and<br/>
<br/>
