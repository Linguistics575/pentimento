<br/>
large to some. Their proper proportion will<br/>
appear only when they <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>viewed in comparison with what other professions receive<br/>
for an equal amount of skill, labor, and responsibility. The average <span style="color: #ff0000;">fee </span>for the hazardous<br/>
task of opening the abdomen and subsequent<br/>
attention will look trivial when compared with<br/>
what a corporation or criminal lawyer would<br/>
charge in a suit of equal gravity. And beside<br/>
the $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">100,000 </span>income for a year's work among<br/>
the wealthy, place the statement recently made<br/>
by Senator Depew with reference to Senator<br/>
Spooner:<br/>
<br/>
"Had he resumed the law when he desired to, he would<br/>
have been employed as counsel in nearly all the big rail<br/>
road reorganizations, in some of which legal fees of<br/>
$ 1,000,000 were paid."<br/>
<br/>
REPRESENTATIVE SURGICAL INCOMES<br/>
<br/>
In considering the average American specialist and the average general practitioner,<br/>
let us take a city in the central part of the<br/>
Union, with a population between 200,000 and<br/>
300,000. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>have before me the figures relating<br/>
to such a city and have the advantage of an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">intimate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">knowledge </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">physicians </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span>,<br/>
which is a check on accuracy. Of the many<br/>
physicians-and the proportion of men with<br/>
far-reaching reputations is unusually <span style="color: #0000FF;">large</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>about 20 per cent. do the bulk of the medical<br/>
and surgical practice.<br/>
<br/>
Of the surgeons, there are about a dozen<br/>
whom their colleagues call "successful." In<br/>
round numbers, their yearly incomes are about<br/>
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>makes from $ 18,000 to $ 20,000<br/>
1 makes <span style="color: #ff0000;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">15,000 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">16,000<br/>
</span>6 make <span style="color: #ff0000;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">10,000 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">12,000<br/>
</span>4 make <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>5,000 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">6,000<br/>
<br/>
</span>Among those whose annual incomes are less<br/>
than $ 5,000, are the dozens of surgeons who<br/>
have never risen above mediocrity and the<br/>
younger men whose reputations are yet to be<br/>
made<br/>
<br/>
So much for the yearly incomes of the surgeons. What about individual fees? I happen to know the most important facts so far as<br/>
three of the leading surgeons are concerned.<br/>
Dr. A. is a specialist in operations within the<br/>
abdominal <span style="color: #0000FF;">cavity </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">next </span>to brain surgery the<br/>
most perilous of all. His standing in the profession is such that every medical society is<br/>
glad to have him as a member. He is also<br/>
a professor of surgery in an important college<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>IS THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">DOCTOR </span>A SHYLOCK?<br/>
<br/>
He is therefore entitled to receive as much as,<br/>
or more than, any surgeon in his city. This<br/>
specialist has never received a fee larger than<br/>
$ 1,000, and that amount has been paid him<br/>
but a few times. A number of times he has<br/>
received <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">400 </span>and $ 500, but the majority of his<br/>
fees range around $ 200. To the laity, the<br/>
average of these fees looks like "easy money,"<br/>
but the actual operation is the smallest part of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surgeon</span>'s work, as the following typical<br/>
case will show:<br/>
<br/>
The operation is to take place at eleven<br/>
o'clock. There have been at least three careful<br/>
examinations of the patient beforehand, one<br/>
of which included microscopic or chemical<br/>
work. No less than two assistant physicians<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">required-one </span>to give the anaesthetic,<br/>
another to pick up blood vessels as soon as<br/>
severed, to avoid hemorrhage. The preparation of doctors, patient, instruments, and<br/>
bandages has consumed most of the forenoon.<br/>
The patient is back in bed within an hour, but<br/>
the surgeon lingers until consciousness is fully<br/>
restored. He sees the patient again late in the<br/>
afternoon, and probably again at bedtime<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>He counts himself fortunate if he gets no<br/>
telephone call at midnight and if he escapes a<br/>
hurried call before daylight to check hemorrhage or allay pain. This average patient will<br/>
require regular attention for two weeks. Such<br/>
intangible cares as nervous strain, weight of<br/>
responsibility, liability for mishaps, and loss<br/>
of prestige through unavoidable failure cannot<br/>
be reduced to figures. And if this average<br/>
patient were rich-unfortunately, he is <span style="color: #0000FF;">not-the </span>surgeon would not feel overpaid if a grateful family should send him a check for $ 500 or<br/>
even $ 1,000. The patient's earning power,<br/>
perhaps his life, has been saved.<br/>
<br/>
There is another fact that must not be overlooked. Dr. A.'s average fee is about $ 200 for<br/>
these operations-mot his average for each<br/>
operation performed. I have seen this surgeon<br/>
operate in at least a dozen cases, each requiring<br/>
as much attention as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>above, from<br/>
whom he could not possibly have expected to<br/>
receive enough to pay for the ether used during<br/>
the operation. Yet his technique was as<br/>
thorough and his attention as conscientious as<br/>
any patient could have required.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. B. ranks equally with Dr. A. in almost<br/>
every respect. His largest fee, up to the present<br/>
time, is $ 600; it was for an abdominal operation<br/>
when the patient's life was at stake. His<br/>
smallest fee has been nothing-many times.<br/>
<br/>
