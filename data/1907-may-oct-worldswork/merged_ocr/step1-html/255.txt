</span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">LIGHT<br/>
<br/>
</span>that has ever <span style="color: #0000FF;">expressed </span>itself, perhaps, at any<br/>
state capital, this is truly an historic event.<br/>
<br/>
The new law gives two commissions, of five<br/>
members each (one for New York City and<br/>
the other for the rest of the state), as complete<br/>
regulative power over all public-service corporations, except telegraph and telephone<br/>
companies, as any law, state or Federal, has<br/>
ever given. It is fair to call it the most comprehensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>serious effort at state regulation<br/>
yet made in any of the older states. If its<br/>
intent is carried into effect, as there is every<br/>
reason to suppose that it will be, the era of<br/>
franchise-built politics and tyranny, as well as<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">diseriminations </span>and of imperfect public<br/>
service, will close. The agitation for the<br/>
regulation of public-service corporations has<br/>
produced no other result so definite and<br/>
promising.<br/>
<br/>
The fundamental principle of the law is<br/>
that the people must at all times and in all<br/>
places be superior to the creatures of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>'s making. No corporation must be<br/>
able to snap its fingers in the face of the people<br/>
who created it. That is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">principle </span>eternally<br/>
right, and upon which no compromise should<br/>
be possible. Because the state of New York<br/>
has compromised upon it in the past many and<br/>
many a time, the present Public Utilities law<br/>
was necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Now enters the second consideration-the<br/>
question of how this control is to be exercised.<br/>
The legislature of the state has again and again<br/>
demonstrated beyond question that it has<br/>
neither the ability nor the honesty properly to<br/>
exercise a duty so complex. In fact, no <span style="color: #0000FF;">legislature </span>in the land is so constituted as to be a<br/>
proper body to undertake direct supervision<br/>
over a huge, complex, and stubborn machine<br/>
such as, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">instance</span>, the traction system of<br/>
New York City.<br/>
<br/>
What is to be the result? If one asks the<br/>
financial powers, they frown and look <span style="color: #ff0000;">significant</span>, and point out that Mr. Ryan has sailed<br/>
for Europe after trimming his sails-or rather<br/>
stripping his poles <span style="color: #ff0000;">completely-An </span>preparation<br/>
for the storm. Their attitude, in fact, recalls<br/>
the attitude of the railroad powers when President Roosevelt came out against the Northern<br/>
Securities Company, and, later, in favor of<br/>
rate regulation. But these "radical and unsafe" policies of Mr. Roosevelt have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">followed </span>by tremendous advances in the prices of<br/>
railroad stocks, even those directly attacked.<br/>
Wall Street, in truth, is a discredited judge.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9053<br/>
<br/>
</span>The people rejoice that at last there is to be<br/>
some semblance of an effort to see that when<br/>
the people give life to these great corporations<br/>
the companies shall live up to their part of the<br/>
bargain. And in the hope that practical<br/>
results will be obtained, the people smile at<br/>
Wall Street and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls</span>, and go about their<br/>
business well content with Governor Hughes<br/>
and the triumph that he gains.<br/>
<br/>
A LIGHT THAT FAILS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>railroad companies and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">great<br/>
</span>corporations used, as a rule, to ignore<br/>
"the making of public opinion." But, when<br/>
the agitation began for rate-regulation, <span style="color: #ff0000;">most<br/>
</span>of the great railroad companies created "literary<br/>
bureaus" or contributed to their support.<br/>
All kinds of periodicals were flooded with<br/>
articles and with arguments.'f Special writers,"<br/>
<br/>
"economists," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">experts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-all </span>sorts of men<br/>
became active with their pens, at the railroads'<br/>
expense.<br/>
<br/>
Then other large corporations followed this<br/>
example. Nearly every one now has its "press<br/>
agent," a man, or a pair of men, who are kept<br/>
in its service to give out information to public<br/>
journals. There come to this desk almost<br/>
every day neatly typewritten or printed pieces<br/>
of information from such men. Most of this<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>free and some of these news-firms<br/>
frankly say that they are paid by their "clients."<br/>
But articles are offered also by writers who are<br/>
not so frank-men who were paid to go to<br/>
Cuba or to some part of the country through<br/>
which a new railroad runs. They also have<br/>
their "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Clients</span>." And there are "news-firms"<br/>
who send correspondents or reporters anywhere or everywhere to describe anything if<br/>
their "clients" pay the bill-ideal life in a<br/>
manufacturing town, the failure of municipal<br/>
ownership in some Western village, the cleanliness of a canning factory, the kindly rule on<br/>
the Congo-anything, anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Much of this ready-made, or "tainted"<br/>
news and description and argument is published in some journals, some of it because it is<br/>
interesting, more of it because it is cheap.<br/>
Some of it is true, some of it is false, most of<br/>
it is neither true nor false but merely "mollycoddle" stuff without character. You read<br/>
it in many newspapers and in some magazines.<br/>
You probably do not know that it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>tainted,"<br/>
but you do know that it is inane.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is, a writer who writes for a "client"<br/>
can never earn his fees, however small they<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
