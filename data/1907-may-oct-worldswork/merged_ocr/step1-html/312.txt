</span>PART OF BOMBAY UNIVERSITY<br/>
The universities of India are yearly giving to that <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scores<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>highly educated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hindustani </span>who are to be the <span style="color: #0000FF;">leaders </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">New<br/>
<br/>
</span>India <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to-morrow </span>and work out the salvation of their country<br/>
<br/>
but it fain would have us forget that while it<br/>
has sunk over $ 200,000,000 in the unprofitable<br/>
railroads, the people have died for lack <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>

</span>THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
reservoirs to catch and hold the waters that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>from the hills in spring, then come again<br/>
no more until the year has fled.<br/>
<br/>
The uplift of the world goes on, slowly, it<br/>
may be, here and there; but, for the most<br/>
part, swiftly, wonderfully. Little Japan stands<br/>
first, but close behind are Africa and South<br/>
America. Why is it that the past forty years<br/>
have brought these wonders?<br/>
<br/>
England and the United States supply the<br/>
answer. Time was when England went<br/>
a-colonizing with set <span style="color: #0000FF;">bayonets</span>. To-day, having learned many lessons, it colonizes with the<br/>
railroad locomotive and the plow. It is<br/>
commerce that to-day is founding schools to<br/>
teach the young men of the alien races to<br/>
write figures, building railroads to bring down<br/>
the riches of the Hinterland, irrigating <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span>deserts of Egypt and tempting the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dervishes<br/>
</span>to study the growing of cotton, teaching the<br/>
Zulu to handle the plow, coaxing the Congo<br/>
cannibal to mine the copper of his hills, driving<br/>
the railroads to the tips of the Andes, founding great docks on the muddy flats of the great<br/>
La Plata. It is the Age of Commerce, and<br/>
the walls that have stood unbroken for centuries against the onset of arms, religion, and<br/>
pedantry are crumbling to pieces before our<br/>
eyes as the first waves of commerce lap their<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bases</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
