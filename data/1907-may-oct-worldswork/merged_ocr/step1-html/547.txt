I it takes all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">energy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man can muster.<br/>
<br/>
It takes more than mere energy, too:<br/>
it takes the wisest possible investment of that<br/>
energy. A man must know when to spend<br/>
himself and when to spare himself. Success<br/>
lies as much in knowing the time to quit as in<br/>
the ability to keep plugging on in the face of<br/>
everything<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>That is why the various problems of fatigue<br/>
are important. Fatigue isn't nearly so simple<br/>
and plain-as-day a subject as we are likely to<br/>
think. When we "just feel tired," we <span style="color: #0000FF;">haven't<br/>
</span>by any means finished the story; there are a<br/>
great many varieties of feeling tired, and each<br/>
variety has a different bearing upon the business<br/>
of efficient living.<br/>
<br/>
Take the most obvious <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>of all-" <span style="color: #0000FF;">muscular</span>" fatigue. In the laboratory you can<br/>
stimulate a bit of muscle to contract over and<br/>
over again until finally it stops giving you any<br/>
response. But if you take the muscle out of<br/>
the apparatus and give it a bath in a warm<br/>
salt solution, it will begin reacting again with<br/>
almost as much snap as it had in the first place.<br/>
You have washed out the fatigue. It won't<br/>
keep it up so long this time, however; and a<br/>
second bath will have less effect than the first.<br/>
Finally, you come to a point where even a<br/>
bath doesn't help the situation. That is<br/>
muscular exhaustion, and, physiologically<br/>
speaking, it is an entirely different phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, however, the kind of<br/>
fatigue that we ordinarily call "muscular"<br/>
isn't in the muscle. We are simply using a<br/>
handy term. When a nerve centre has worked<br/>
a group of muscles until they refuse to respond<br/>
any longer, the trouble is usually with the controlling battery and not with the thing it runs.<br/>
If you put an electric current directly on the<br/>
nerve that feeds the "fatigued" muscle, at<br/>
once the muscle will begin to work again.<br/>
<br/>
The part of us that goes under first is the<br/>
nervous part. We do not use up the energy<br/>
<br/>
of our muscles; we exhaust the battery they<br/>
are "connected up" with.<br/>
<br/>
Emotional fatigue is another variety. Several times in my life I have been through one<br/>
hard experience after another-losses in the<br/>
family, for example-and when the first shock<br/>
came it seemed as if I couldn't endure it.<br/>
Then the next came, and the next. I simply<br/>
felt numb. I had nothing left to react with.<br/>
That was emotional fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
And we know how it works out in the opposite<br/>
direction, too. We have seen it at Christmas<br/>
time in the little folks. Long before the tree<br/>
is unloaded of its treasures, they are usually<br/>
so exhausted by their burden of happiness<br/>
that they hardly show any interest in the latest<br/>
additions to their pile of presents.<br/>
<br/>
Children make excellent laboratory material<br/>
in the field of emotional fatigue, because the<br/>
majority of their emotions get full play as long<br/>
as they last. I have seen children yield to<br/>
blazing anger until they reached a point where,<br/>
out of sheer exhaustion, the anger disappeared,<br/>
even though the original cause of it was just<br/>
as much in evidence as ever. This wasn't<br/>
the kind of exhaustion that follows intense<br/>
physical effort-the violent use of hands,<br/>
muscles, motor areas. The emotional engine<br/>
had simply worked off all its steam. It couldn't<br/>
get into action again until the fire was stoked.<br/>
<br/>
Will fatigue presents some of the biggest<br/>
problems a man has to face. If it were not<br/>
for will fatigue, we could all of us lead perfect<br/>
lives. Any minute that I choose to do so, I<br/>
can live perfectly. I can live perfectly for an<br/>
hour, if I keep at it hard enough. But I am<br/>
pretty sure that I couldn't do it for a week.<br/>
I have made the experiment more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">once-unsuccessfully</span>. The strain is too great; my<br/>
will gets tired, and then it "caves in." I<br/>
slump down to a lower level for a while, and<br/>
my volitional faculties take a rest.<br/>
<br/>
So far as my knowledge of such things goes,<br/>
there is nothing outside of us that forces us to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
