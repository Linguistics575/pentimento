<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the centre is the parasite that causes <span style="color: #0000FF;">sleeping-sickness<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>pupil of the School and the winner of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cragges<br/>
</span>Prize for his observations in connection with<br/>
the trypanosome. It was also a pupil of the<br/>
School, Dr. Forde, who first discovered, in the<br/>
Gambia colony, the presence of this parasite<br/>
in the blood of a patient. The parasite was<br/>
subsequently recognized by Dr. Dutton of the<br/>
sister school at Liverpool, as belonging to a<br/>
group of germs responsible for many grave<br/>
diseases among the lower animals.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequent observations by Colonel Bruce<br/>
and others have, says Sir Patrick Manson,<br/>
wholly endorsed the truth and importance of<br/>
Dr. Castellani's discovery. Nor is this all. A<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">past </span>student of the School was one of those who<br/>
aided in the proof of the mode of propagation<br/>
of yellow fever in Cuba; <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>showed<br/>
that the African <span style="color: #0000FF;">lick-fever </span>is due to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>parasite closely related to that of relapsing<br/>
or famine fever.<br/>
<br/>
While every student has an opportunity of<br/>
distinguishing himself or herself in original<br/>
research, each one, so far as teaching can ensure,<br/>
leaves the laboratories absolutely qualified for<br/>
actual practice in the tropics. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seen</span>,<br/>
and most of them have applied for <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span>,<br/>
the most recent methods of diagnosis, and they<br/>
have seen in operation <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">methods </span>of treatment<br/>
of the best repute. This practical education<br/>
not only increases the value of future work from<br/>
a scientific point of view, but it has <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>actual<br/>
commercial value. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>employers are enabled,<br/>
through the improved health-conditions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tropical </span>countries, to send out a better class of men,<br/>
and to keep them there, the gain is enormous<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The British Government has so far <span style="color: #0000FF;">contributed </span>about $ 22,000 toward the establishment<br/>
of the school, of which nearly $ 5,000 came from<br/>
the India Office. As a result of Sir Francis<br/>
Lovell's efforts, donations of $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>each were<br/>
sent by the governments of Hong Kong, the<br/>
Straits Settlements, and the Federated Malay<br/>
States. Among private benefactors, the name<br/>
of Sir John <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cragges </span>stands out as the founder,<br/>
for three years, of a traveling scholarship, held<br/>
by Dr. G. C. Low, and subsequently of a school<br/>
prize for the most valuable contribution to<br/>
tropical medicine during the year.<br/>
<br/>
In recognition of its importance, the school<br/>
has recently been admitted by the Senate as a<br/>
School of the University of London.<br/>
<br/>
Disease still decimates native populations <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>sends men home from the tropics <span style="color: #0000FF;">prematurely<br/>
</span>old and broken down. Until the white man has<br/>
the key to the problem, this blot must remain.<br/>
To bring large tracts of the globe under the<br/>
white man's rule has a grandiloquent ring; but<br/>
unless we have the means of improving the condition of the inhabitants, it is scarcely more<br/>
than an empty boast<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
