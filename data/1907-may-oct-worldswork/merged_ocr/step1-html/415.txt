of one tunnel to the mouth of another. It is<br/>
very simple, but enormously expensive. It is<br/>
followed, in some measure, by the Tidewater,<br/>
the Moffat Line, and the Western Pacific. It<br/>
is given to only a few engineers to build a road<br/>
like that. Most of them have had hard struggles to get their plans passed by the board of<br/>
directors. They have had to show that the<br/>
line was both best and cheapest. Mr. Berry<br/>

When a railroad follows a river, which after<br/>
all is the most common form of the mountain<br/>
pass, the work may be very simple, or very<br/>
severe. In broad alluvial bottoms, the grading<br/>
is as easy and fast as on a prairie, the main<br/>
problem being to raise the grade above highwater. When the river is a mountain torrent<br/>
