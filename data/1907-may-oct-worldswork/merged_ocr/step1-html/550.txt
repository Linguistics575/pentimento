<span>9348 THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL FATIGUE<br/>
<br/>
throughout her junior year-and she did this<br/>
without making any effort for it, either.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between those two years was<br/>
merely a difference in fatigue. Consecutive<br/>
fatigue in the one case had "let down" the<br/>
girl's whole personality-mentally, morally,<br/>
physically; in the other case, the personality<br/>
was lifted. In that junior year she was not<br/>
only a better person-she was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>person. She possessed happiness, independence,<br/>
and self-control. She belonged to another<br/>
level of civilization, one which not only held<br/>
the lower things in subjection, but added higher<br/>
things thereto.<br/>
<br/>
Fatigue has a definite order in which it<br/>
knocks us to pieces. It begins at the top and<br/>
works down. I have spoken of this before,<br/>
but I want to emphasize it.<br/>
<br/>
EFFECT OF FATIGUE ON MEMORY<br/>
<br/>
In minor ways, we observe the workings of<br/>
the principle in ourselves every time we get<br/>
thoroughly tired. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>thing that slips<br/>
out of our control is the power or strength or<br/>
skill that we have most recently acquired;<br/>
earlier acquisitions stick by us longer. A tired<br/>
man will stumble in speaking a foreign language, while still able to talk English readily.<br/>
School-children at the multiplication-table stage<br/>
of their education will, when tired, forget their<br/>
advanced tables long before they slip up on<br/>
the earlier <span style="color: #ff0000;">ones-mot </span>because the later tables<br/>
have not been successfully committed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">memory</span>, but because they have not sunk in so<br/>
deeply; they are not "ingrained" yet. The<br/>
earlier table rattles off with the facility of a<br/>
perfect reflex; the later ones still involve a<br/>
certain conscious effort.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the same thing repeatedly in<br/>
musicians. After severe muscular exertion,<br/>
they would still be able to play correctly<br/>
difficult pieces that they had long been<br/>
familiar with; but they failed entirely with<br/>
simple things that they had been recently<br/>
working on and constantly practising. Under<br/>
similar circumstances, I have noticed dancers<br/>
forget their more newly practised <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>These people could all do something more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>than the thing they were unable to do;<br/>
but the more difficult thing had been learned<br/>
earlier and had become thoroughly mechanized<br/>
-more like an instinct, which never fails to<br/>
"do the rest" when the button is touched.<br/>
<br/>
Now take the racial side of it. Some of the<br/>
elements that enter into the making of us are<br/>
<br/>
as old as life itself-hunger, for example, the<br/>
sexual instinct, self-interest, fear, and the like.<br/>
Those are rock-bottom things. It is on the<br/>
basis of them that countless generations of<br/>
community life and parental responsibility<br/>
have built up a superstructure of finer qualities:<br/>
unselfishness, for example, devotion to an<br/>
idea (such as the God-idea), chastity, <span style="color: #ff0000;">selfcontrol</span>, judgment. These are acquisitions<br/>
that have been fought and suffered for, and we<br/>
only hold on to them by constant struggle.<br/>
<br/>
But when we are fatigued, we don't struggle<br/>
very ardently. All these less-secure holdings<br/>
are promptly attacked and demoralized.<br/>
Fatigue lowers our control-ability far sooner<br/>
than it lowers our anger-ability.<br/>
<br/>
Tired men go on sprees. That is one result<br/>
of overwork.<br/>
<br/>
Just as fatigue lessens our ability to withstand diseases-which attack the physical<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">man-so </span>it lessens our ability to withstand<br/>
temptations, which attack the moral man.<br/>
This is not because the temptations are more<br/>
numerous, but because there is less energy of<br/>
resistance. The fact that typhoid fever takes<br/>
hold of people who are overworked is not<br/>
because overworked people drink a greater<br/>
number of typhoid bacilli in their milk, but<br/>
because the white <span style="color: #0000FF;">corpuscles </span>in their blood are<br/>
not vigorous enough. They are without resistance power.<br/>
<br/>
The girl I was speaking of had gone back<br/>
whole epochs in the history of civilization.<br/>
The fear that had laid hold of her was<br/>
the world-old racial fear-the fear of the<br/>
dark. And she had nothing to withstand it<br/>
with, having lost her self-control through<br/>
fatigue. Instinct had supplanted reason in such<br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
Fatigue promptly attacks and undermines<br/>
our sense of proportion. I know of no better<br/>
illustration of this than the way we will leave<br/>
our professional work. When I am really<br/>
fatigued, it is very difficult for me to go home<br/>
when the time comes. It is, of course, true<br/>
that there are always little things remaining<br/>
to be done; but when I am especially tired,<br/>
I cannot distinguish between those which are<br/>
important enough to keep me and those which<br/>
are not. I only see how many things there<br/>
are still undone; and I tend to go on and on.<br/>
<br/>
If I see a scrap of paper on the Mor, I cannot<br/>
help going out of my chair and taking time to<br/>
pick up that wretched thing and put it in my<br/>
waste-basket. It assumes, somehow, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
