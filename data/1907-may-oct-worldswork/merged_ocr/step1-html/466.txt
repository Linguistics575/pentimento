The public must learn that the blind man<br/>

is neither a genius nor a freak nor an idiot.<br/>
He has a mind which can be educated, a hand<br/>
which can be trained, ambitions which it is<br/>
right for him to strive to realize, and it is the<br/>
duty of the public to help him to make the best<br/>
of himself, so that he can win light through<br/>

short-lived books that the public,<br/>
perhaps, is inclined to forget the larger undertakings of the publishing houses. A few of<br/>
such large undertakings are, therefore, here<br/>
explained, as a reminder of the continuous<br/>
and less heralded additions to books of value.<br/>

EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY<br/>
<br/>
Of these "<span style="color: #0000FF;">libraries</span>," or growing <span style="color: #ff0000;">collections<br/>
</span>of books uniformly bound, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Evcryman's<br/>
</span>Library, <span style="color: #0000FF;">issued </span>in the United States by E. P.<br/>
Dutton & Company, is one of the most popular<br/>
as well as one of the most serviceable. It is<br/>
intended that it shall include not only the<br/>
English classics but also many books that are<br/>
either out of print, or so rare, or so expensive<br/>
as to be out of the reach of the everyday reader.<br/>
Reprints of such books, well printed and <span style="color: #0000FF;">modestly </span>bound, are here offered at a most reasonable price, for each volume. The public<br/>
appreciation of this idea has been shown in<br/>
several ways; by a large sale, of course, but<br/>
especially by the eagerness with which the<br/>
books by the more obscure authors of the past<br/>
have been bought. The publishers have thus<br/>
clearly performed a very real service toward<br/>
putting within easy reach <span style="color: #ff0000;">thLLt </span>part of English<br/>
literature that was hardest to procure.<br/>

</span>first of all devoted to a description of conditions<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>they exist in the United States, but they seek<br/>
also to suggest the problems that exist in our<br/>
political structure, with the considerations<br/>
involved in their solution. The books are sold<br/>
at $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">145 </span>apiece.<br/>
<br/>
"LEADING AMERICANS"<br/>
<br/>
A series on much the same subject, but<br/>
approached from the angle of the personalities<br/>
that have made conditions what they are, is<br/>
the series of biographies of Leading Americans,<br/>
in course of publication by Henry Holt and<br/>
Company. These volumes, of which "Leading<br/>
American Soldiers," by Mr. R. M. Johnston,<br/>
has been published, will be of large size, and<br/>
each will contain several biographies under<br/>
such classifications as "Leading American<br/>
Historians," by Prof. William P. Trent, of<br/>
Columbia University; "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Leading </span>American Lawyers," by Mr. Henry C. Merwin; "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Leading<br/>
</span>American Poets," by Dr. Curtis Hidden Page,<br/>
