of the rise of James B. Duke from selling agent<br/>
of a one-story tobacco factory in Durham, to<br/>
the management of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>business whose trade now<br/>
encircles the globe. Spray, in Rockingham<br/>
County, is only one of several North Carolina<br/>
towns which have developed almost as if by<br/>

now a small city of 8,000 people, with ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton </span>mills and a pay-roll of $ 2,000 a day. "I<br/>
expect to build one cotton mill every year until<br/>
I am fifty," says its founder, Mr. B. Frank<br/>

Oklahoma to Oregon. For the first time, too,<br/>
the state has real cities-no longer aggregations<br/>
of houses and men more or less accidentally<br/>
brought together, but communities of people<br/>
welded together by a spirit of unity, loyalty,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation </span>into a definite and effective<br/>
working force.<br/>

One would like to give a chapter, too, to the<br/>
development of North Carolina's water powers<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;"># </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3,500,000 </span>horse-power being available along<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton </span>mill above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">power </span>house is run by this <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-generated </span>electricity and power is sold <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>

maintain. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>have not heard anyone speak<br/>
of Winston-Salem as being "on a boom," yet<br/>
in the first seven months of last year it increased<br/>
its capital invested in manufacturing more<br/>
than <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third-from </span>$ 9,216,000 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">h </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2,750,000<br/>
</span>-doing, it merely as a matter of course and<br/>
without exciting outside comment. Almost<br/>
everywhere, in both town and country, I find<br/>
the same exuberant energy, the same intense<br/>
local pride, which a few years ago struck <span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>as<br/>
being a peculiar mark of the Westerner, from<br/>
<br/>
or from the hills of its Piedmont counties.<br/>
The Southern Power Company on the Catawba,<br/>
the Whitney Reduction Company on the<br/>
Yadkin, and the Rockingham Power Company<br/>
on the Great Pee Dee are now developing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hydro-electric </span>power <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>to run <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-fifth<br/>
</span>of all the spindles in England. And as yet<br/>
they <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>but tapped this enormous resource.<br/>
Already, as a result of the transmission of<br/>
power by electricity, the tendency is toward<br/>
building larger cotton mills instead of the many<br/>
small mills which formerly utilized the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water<br/>
