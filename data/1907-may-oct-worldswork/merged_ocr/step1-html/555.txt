<span>TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS 9353<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">.him </span>that often, when another of the judges<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">behindhand</span>, Taft would ask for the papers<br/>
and finish up his opinion for him. He did not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">overwork </span>his force, but he set the pace for them,<br/>
and they did well to keep up. So heavy a man<br/>
night well have gotten the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office-holder</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>lazy<br/>
preference for the path of least resistance, but<br/>
sloth was never a characteristic of Judge Taft.<br/>
He was very methodical about taking exercise.<br/>
Every morning he went through a system of<br/>
drudgery, of gymnastic <span style="color: #0000FF;">contortions</span>, until he<br/>
was in a streaming perspiration. He particularly liked to walk. He walked to court,<br/>
and back to his home on Walnut Hills. He<br/>
walked at <span style="color: #ff0000;">nodn</span>, and on a Saturday or holiday<br/>
he and two other judges-one his old boyhood<br/>
playmate and college chum, Howard C.<br/>
Hollister-used to strike out for any point of<br/>
the compass, and briskly scour the country<br/>
for miles around.<br/>
<br/>
His vacations were spent at Murray Bay,<br/>
Quebec, on the St. Lawrence. There as elsewhere he came in for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>nickname, and they<br/>
called him Le <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petit </span>Juge. Such a sobriquet<br/>
in connection with the gigantic magistrate must<br/>
have occurred to the piquant <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>Canadian<br/>
mind on one occasion when the board-walk<br/>
caught <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire</span>, and Judge Taft came out to see<br/>
what the trouble was. He saw that the flames<br/>
had seized on the walk, and would soon spread<br/>
to a number of cottages. Under his directions,<br/>
an agitated native set to work with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>crowbar.<br/>
But it soon appeared that he would not get the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>board pried loose before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flames </span>caught<br/>
him. Whereupon Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>drew off his<br/>
coat, stooped, and took the end of the board in<br/>
both hands. He ripped it off as one might<br/>
rip apart a blackberry box. He ripped off<br/>
board after board, and saved the cottages.<br/>
<br/>
Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s court was perhaps more<br/>
economically conducted than any other Circuit<br/>
Court. The earnings were large, but they<br/>
were not all spent on clerk hire. Half of these,<br/>
by Act of Congress, could be devoted to<br/>
library purposes. Judge Taft wanted a library<br/>
attached to his court, to give lawyers better<br/>
facilities in the study of cases. If an attorney<br/>
could look up the authorities and cite them,<br/>
he saved the Court's time. So Taft was<br/>
prompted by his constant guiding motive, the<br/>
best possible work, and founded the Library<br/>
of the Circuit Court, which now contains<br/>
15,000 volumes, and means an equipment<br/>
rare in Federal courts.<br/>
<br/>
Economy in clerk hire did not, however,<br/>
<br/>
mean that the public was getting less for its<br/>
fees. Records from the lower courts are sent<br/>
out to be printed, for which the Government<br/>
charges the litigant <span style="color: #ff0000;">twcnty-five </span>cents per page.<br/>
Judge Taft noticed that the records were taken<br/>
as they came from the printer, without any<br/>
reading of proof. That wouldn't do, he said.<br/>
The United States Government must give the<br/>
worth of its charges in his court, even if it had<br/>
to employ a larger clerical force; and his court<br/>
is declared to be almost unique in this respect,<br/>
that proof is still carefully read.<br/>
<br/>
HIS FAIRNESS AND KINDNESS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>HEART<br/>
<br/>
But fairness with Judge Taft always went<br/>
along as a component part with his courage.<br/>
He seemed instinctively to take the broadest<br/>
grounds, and drove straight to what was right,<br/>
even though a specific law to fit the case had<br/>
not yet found its way to the statute books. He<br/>
may even have been autocratic in brushing<br/>
aside technicalities. It is certain that he<br/>
promptly dismissed cases that had no merit.<br/>
<br/>
When a man named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Youtsey </span>was tried<br/>
before him for the shameless looting of the<br/>
Newport (Ky.) National Bank, and the case<br/>
had gone to the jury, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Youtsey</span>'s attorney said:<br/>
"If the verdict is guilty, we might as well<br/>
give up, for there's not a single exception I can<br/>
file to any one of the Judge's rulings. He is<br/>
absolutely the fairest judge I have ever seen on<br/>
the bench."<br/>
<br/>
That was fairness from the technical <span style="color: #0000FF;">standpoint</span>, suggesting an unerring legal mind, but<br/>
there was also the same quality of the heart.<br/>
A Kentucky lawyer once filed a petition to sue<br/>
a railroad for damages. His client was a<br/>
poor young girl whose foot had been partly<br/>
cut off in an accident. It was a deserving case,<br/>
but the lawyer was inexperienced. The petition was awkwardly drawn up. If Judge<br/>
Taft had taken no trouble, it could have been<br/>
thrown out on a demurrer from the opposition.<br/>
Moreover, the railroad's attorney, now a<br/>
judge, was a close friend of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s, and the<br/>
girl's "half-baked" counsel was <span style="color: #0000FF;">unknown </span>to<br/>
him. But Judge Taft <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>up the petition<br/>
himself, and the railroad attorney could not<br/>
throw it out. The young woman recovered<br/>
damages and her raw attorney later boasted<br/>
that William Goebel was not the only lawyer in<br/>
Kentucky who could get damages out of the<br/>
railroads.<br/>
<br/>
Again, there was a case before him on appeal<br/>
that had been fought from coast to coast and<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'3<br/>
