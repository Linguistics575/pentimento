<span>FRICK, THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">SILENT </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8855<br/>
<br/>
</span>closed: Mr. Frick was his logical successor.<br/>
Having done much to build this great industrial<br/>
structure, he would inherit the title of its king.<br/>
He would organize a company to buy out Mr.<br/>
Carnegie, and he would become in name as<br/>
well as in fact the leader of the steel industry<br/>
of the world. With him in the management<br/>
of the company were a score of young men,<br/>
afterward called "the young geniuses" by<br/>
Mr. Carnegie, but none of them, Schwab,<br/>
Gayley, Corey, or the others, measured up to<br/>
Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frick </span>in wealth or power.<br/>
<br/>
With his gigantic ambition in mind, Mr.<br/>
Frick associated with himself the second<br/>
largest owner of steel stock, Mr. Henry Phipps.<br/>
Then, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation </span>of Judge W. H.<br/>
Moore and others, he asked Mr. Carnegie for<br/>
an option on his interests. Mr. Carnegie<br/>
demanded $ 1,000,000 for a ninety days' option,<br/>
and named $ 157,950,000 in cash and bonds<br/>
as the price for his entire holdings. This price,<br/>
with the additional cost of the stock of the<br/>
other partners, brought the cost of Mr. Frick's<br/>
scheme to about $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000,000</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Frick invited a party of New York<br/>
bankers, including Mr. J. P. Morgan, to visit<br/>
Pittsburg. After they had examined the steel<br/>
works and had realized the tremendous volume<br/>
of their business, Mr. Frick unfolded to them<br/>
his scheme of reorganization. Never an effective speaker, his presentation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">proposition</span>, involving practically a cash payment of<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000,000 </span>for a business netting only about<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5,000,000 </span>a year, did not impress Mr.<br/>
Morgan. Then the death of Governor Roswell<br/>
P. Flower of New York caused a depression in<br/>
Wall Street that dashed the last hopes of Mr.<br/>
Frick's syndicate. And to make more bitter<br/>
the blow to Mr. Frick's ambitions, Mr. Carnegie, at the end of the ninety days, refused<br/>
to extend the option, and pocketed Mr. Frick's<br/>
million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
HOPES DEFERRED<br/>
<br/>
This was the first time in Mr. Frick's career<br/>
that he had failed to carry through a plan that<br/>
his judgment approved, and the blow to his<br/>
pride was staggering. He believed that Mr.<br/>
Carnegie intended deliberately to humiliate<br/>
him when he refused to renew the option, and<br/>
he has ever since dogged Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carnegie</span>'s trail<br/>
with the same resolute persistency he has<br/>
shown in business.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Carnegie, in turn, resented Mr. Frick's<br/>
desire to succeed to his preeminence in steel,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8855<br/>
<br/>
</span>and he was <span style="color: #0000FF;">mortified </span>that the failure of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Frick </span>syndicate left him in the position of<br/>
having been on the market with his holdings<br/>
which apparently could not be sold. He at<br/>
once undertook to oust Mr. Frick entirely<br/>
from the steel business. The method he<br/>
intended to use was the same method by which<br/>
he had maintained his control over the socalled "debtor partners," who were the "young<br/>
geniuses" who had been admitted to the firm<br/>
for distinguished services.<br/>
<br/>
When Mr. Carnegie wished to reward one<br/>
of his managers he was in the habit of giving<br/>
him a block of shares in the company under<br/>
an agreement called the "ironclad." By this<br/>
agreement the stock so given was carried on<br/>
the books in the manager's name, but it could<br/>
be forfeited to the company at Mr. Carnegie's<br/>
discretion upon payment to the manager of<br/>
the par value of the stock. By this arrangement, the manager received the revenues of<br/>
his stock as long as he enjoyed Mr. Carnegie's<br/>
favor, but he could be disciplined at any time<br/>
by the threat of its forfeiture, as the market<br/>
value of the stock was vastly greater than its<br/>
par value, and the profits from its possession<br/>
were proportionately great.<br/>
<br/>
AT WAR WITH MR. CARNEGIE<br/>
<br/>
After several quarrels with Mr. Frick, Mr.<br/>
Carnegie demanded that he resign as chairman<br/>
of the Board of Managers. Mr. Frick <span style="color: #0000FF;">complied</span>. Then Mr. Carnegie demanded that Mr.<br/>
Frick surrender his stock under the ironclad<br/>
agreement. This Mr. Frick vigorously declined to do, pointing out that he was not a<br/>
debtor partner, as he had paid for his stock<br/>
with stock in the H. C. Frick Coke Company,<br/>
and that therefore the ironclad did not apply<br/>
to him. Mr. Carnegie then ordered the Board<br/>
of Managers to declare Mr. Frick's stock<br/>
forfeited at its par value. Mr. Frick replied<br/>
with a suit against Mr. Carnegie and the Board,<br/>
asking for an injunction to prevent the practical confiscation of his stock.<br/>
<br/>
The war was now on in the open, and the<br/>
public learned of the bitterness within the<br/>
company. Mr. Carnegie's answer to Mr.<br/>
Frick's bill in equity contained <span style="color: #0000FF;">recriminations<br/>
</span>and charges against Mr. Frick's personal<br/>
temperament. The public eagerly expected<br/>
new disclosures of the inside workings of the<br/>
steel business.<br/>
<br/>
Then suddenly the lid was clamped down.<br/>
Peace was better than publicity. The case<br/>
<br/>
