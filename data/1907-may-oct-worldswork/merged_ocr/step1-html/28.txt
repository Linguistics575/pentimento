devouring the diseased germs-in other words,<br/>
to render a person immune, or to cure him,<br/>
by coming to the aid of the white corpuscles.<br/>
Aid may be given to them when they are attacked by certain diseases, by the injection<br/>
of a preparation made from a part of the<br/>
diseased matter <span style="color: #0000FF;">itself</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>This, in brief, is the philosophy of the<br/>
"opsonic" treatment, with which investigators<br/>
and practitioners are now busy and of which<br/>
the medical journals are full. The great<br/>
hope is that this treatment may be found<br/>
successful with pulmonary tuberculosis; but<br/>
the experimenters are not yet agreed that this<br/>
has yet been conclusively accomplished. But<br/>
it has been successfully used in the treatment<br/>
of local infections, such as recurring boils,<br/>
acne, inflammation of the bladder, bone and<br/>
joint inflammations, and (so some practitioners<br/>
claim) in typhoid fever.<br/>
<br/>
The profession, with the safe conservatism<br/>
of scientific men, goes slowly in drawing conclusions. But there are bacteriologists and<br/>
practitioners of high attainments who believe<br/>
that by this method a new era in medicine<br/>
has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">begun-that </span>typhoid and tuberculosis<br/>
and many other diseases will be cured by it;<br/>
and, theoretically, they regard it as probable<br/>
that men can be made immune to these diseases,<br/>
from time to time, as by vaccination we are<br/>
made immune to smallpox-but not by the<br/>
same method.<br/>
<br/>
The wise layman, as the wise investigator,<br/>
withholds a final judgment till there has been<br/>
a long accumulation of successful experiments.<br/>
But there is good reason already at least to<br/>
hope that we are about to <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit </span>by one of the<br/>
most important discoveries ever made.<br/>
<br/>
OUR RELATIONS WITH CANADA<br/>
<br/>
HERE are more than a dozen questions<br/>
<br/>
between the United States and Canada,<br/>
almost every one of which should be capable<br/>
of a quick settlement if responsible representatives of the two countries will get together for<br/>
the discussion of them. That such a discussion<br/>
is now contemplated is good news, both in<br/>
Canada and in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The visit of Secretary Root to Earl Grey at<br/>
Ottawa early in the year was a preliminary<br/>
step. It has been followed by a brief visit<br/>
by Mr. James Bryce, the new British Ambassador to the United States, who made the pilgrimage to Ottawa one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>steps in his<br/>
diplomatic career. All signs point to the belief<br/>
<br/>
THE MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
that Mr. Bryce, Mr. Root, and Earl Grey are<br/>
getting to understand one another in preparation for an international understanding on the<br/>
vexed questions between the countries.<br/>
<br/>
The Governor-General of Canada has always been considered a social rather than a<br/>
political figure. When it has come to real<br/>
diplomatic work between the countries, it is<br/>
probable that Earl Grey will give place to the<br/>
elected heads of the nation, but it must be<br/>
considered a tribute to the personal strength of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Canadian Governor-General that he has<br/>
been brought into the negotiations at all.<br/>
<br/>
The most important question is the tariff.<br/>
Mr. Root wants the Canadians to throw open<br/>
their markets to American trade, and build up<br/>
a tariff wall against the Mother Country.<br/>
That is a serious proposal, and Canada has<br/>
shown no disposition to concede to it. There<br/>
may be concessions, but there will be no surrender on the broad proposition. The settlement of a new basis for mutual traffic is a very<br/>
big and important diplomatic task.<br/>
<br/>
Some other questions that might be settled<br/>
by sensible arbitration are the preservation of<br/>
Niagara Falls by restrictive legislation, the<br/>
regulation of coastwise fisheries, the making<br/>
of a new law to allow the building of warships<br/>
on the Lakes, the saving of the seal herds in<br/>
the Bering Sea, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-enactment </span>of laws to<br/>
permit of freight transit in bond across sections<br/>
of both countries, the question of alien labor<br/>
laws in their application to Canadians in this<br/>
Country and Americans in Canada, and half<br/>
a dozen small specific matters local to boundary<br/>
territory. None of these present great difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
In general, the people of this country will<br/>
welcome any diplomatic activities that remove<br/>
or tend to remove the barriers between us and<br/>
our neighbors across the northern border.<br/>
There should be no room for hostility between<br/>
the United States and Canada, either in matters of politics or in matters of trade.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">0KLAH0MA</span>'S CONSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS<br/>
<br/>
HE hunger and thirst for corporate right<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eousness </span>that just now are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest<br/>
</span>appetites of the public will be appeased in<br/>
Oklahoma by the new constitution which will<br/>
be ready to go before the people of that state<br/>
for adoption next August, if the President<br/>
approve. It is an interesting experiment, for<br/>
it is an attempt to embody in the organic law<br/>
of a state the remedy for existing public evils,<br/>
so that no future legislation may even <span style="color: #0000FF;">permit<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
