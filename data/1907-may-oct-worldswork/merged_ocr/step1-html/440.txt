<br/>
</span>where commercial methods would have realized<br/>
nothing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Treasury </span>money had been deposited<br/>
with the explicit understanding that the note<br/>
of So-and-So, politician, was to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">discounted </span>out of the deposit, without any useless<br/>
fuss about security. This discovery aroused<br/>
the public indignation to the point of electing<br/>
William H. Berry, a Democrat, to the office<br/>
of state Treasurer in that fall's election; owing<br/>
no allegiance to the machine, he was under no<br/>
obligation to conceal what he should <span style="color: #0000FF;">find</span>.<br/>
The people had secured an accounting at last.<br/>
<br/>
When the state capitol was burned, in 1897,<br/>
with it burned fine libraries and any amount<br/>
of state records. It was openly charged that<br/>
the building had been fired by the Quay<br/>
machine in order to destroy compromising<br/>
evidence. The story found credence, but was<br/>
never carried to proof. It is certain that the<br/>
state lost its records. The State Board of<br/>
Public Grounds and Buildings, consisting of<br/>
Governor Daniel H. Hastings, Treasurer Benjamin J. Haywood, and Auditor-General Amos<br/>
H. Mylin, with their executive officer, John C.<br/>
Delaney, the Superintendent, at once rented<br/>
and fitted up a church for temporary use.<br/>
<br/>
THE FIRST CAPITOL COMMISSION<br/>
<br/>
There was a strong anti-Quay feeling among<br/>
the Representatives, and the members did not<br/>
feel like throwing open the treasury doors to<br/>
that crowd to build a new capitol. And yet<br/>
a new capitol must be built. On April 14th,<br/>
a measure was passed that authorized a Commission for that purpose and appropriated<br/>
$ 550,000, with specific instructions that the<br/>
Commission was not to go into debt and that<br/>
it was to complete the building ready for<br/>
occupancy in time for the session of 1899.<br/>
The Commission consisted of the Grounds and<br/>
Buildings Board and the presiding officers<br/>
of the two legislative houses. And so Delaney<br/>
became its executive officer. Henry Ives Cobb,<br/>
of New York, was selected as architect, and<br/>
the Commission began its work.<br/>
<br/>
Quay's term as United States Senator was<br/>
drawing to a close, and the state campaign of<br/>
1898 turned on his re-election. The fight was<br/>
bitter. Quay carried the state ticket but lost<br/>
a majority of the legislature. By thirteen<br/>
votes, he failed of succeeding himself as Senator. It was to a body of this condition of<br/>
mind that the Capitol Commission reported.<br/>
The half-million appropriation had been tied<br/>
up by its predecessor as tightly as words could<br/>
<br/>
PENNSYLVANIA'S PALACE OF GRAFT<br/>
<br/>
tie it, making it plain that the money granted<br/>
was to be all that was to be used, and that<br/>
there was to be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>capitol.<br/>
<br/>
When the legislature convened in 1899, there<br/>
was a curious spectacle on Capitol Hill. The<br/>
Commission reported that the capitol was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>, and that it had been done within the<br/>
appropriation. There was a vast barracks of<br/>
red brick, walls raw within and without, with a<br/>
hole in the roof for a dome, covered over with<br/>
rough boards to keep the rain out. The legislative chambers had been hung with burlap,<br/>
and a tawdry covering of paint and whitewash<br/>
and gilding was spread on them. It was the<br/>
mere brick skeleton of a vast and pretentious<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>; and that the Commission intended<br/>
this was shown early in the session by its<br/>
request for another appropriation-which it<br/>
did not get.<br/>
<br/>
THE SECOND CAPITOL COMMISSION<br/>
<br/>
By the time the election of 1900 came around,<br/>
the machine had recovered its grip on the state.<br/>
Accordingly a new appropriation of $ 4,000,000<br/>
was made and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>new Commission was charged<br/>
with the expenditure on virtually the old terms<br/>
-that the work was to be done within the<br/>
appropriation. This Commission was headed<br/>
by the new Governor, William A. Stone; the<br/>
other four members were William H. Graham,<br/>
Member of Congress from Pittsburg; William<br/>
P. Snyder, State Senator from Chester County;<br/>
Nathan C. Schaeffer, Superintendent of Public<br/>
Instruction, of Lancaster; and Edward Bailey,<br/>
a wealthy and respectable bank president of<br/>
Harrisburg. T. L. Eyre, of Chester County,<br/>
Senator Snyder's colleague in running the<br/>
home county political machine, was chosen<br/>
superintendent of the work. By appointment<br/>
of the Governor, he held the position of Superintendent of Public Grounds and Buildings.<br/>
<br/>
In the fall of 1902, Samuel W. Pennypacker<br/>
was elected Governor and took Stone's place<br/>
on the Commission. At the same election,<br/>
William P. Snyder was elected AuditorGeneral, and so became entitled to pass on all<br/>
the bills of the Capitol Commission, of which<br/>
he was a member. A competition of designs<br/>
for the new building was advertised, but the<br/>
method created such unfavorable sentiment<br/>
among architects that it was a failure. A<br/>
second attempt resulted in the selection of<br/>
Mr. Joseph M. Huston. Architect Cobb <span style="color: #ff0000;">didn't<br/>
</span>find favor, but his design for the brick barracks<br/>
made a perfect foundation for Huston's later<br/>
<br/>
