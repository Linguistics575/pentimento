<span>9352 TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>defendants were found guilty and fined.<br/>
They appealed, but the Supreme Court paid<br/>
Judge Taft the rare compliment of handing<br/>
down his decision in full, virtually as its own<br/>
decision. It is now the precedent in all the<br/>
courts of the land.<br/>
<br/>
But he criticizes the law itself. "The<br/>
Sherman Anti-Trust Act," he says, "is one<br/>
which might have been made much more<br/>
definite, in justice to the business community,<br/>
in justice to the executive and to the courts<br/>
required to enforce it, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large part of the<br/>
difficulty which has been experienced in attempted execution of that Act is due, not at<br/>
all to the lack of energy and courage on the part<br/>
of the executive or courts in enforcing it, but to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">indefiniteness </span>of the Act and the necessity<br/>
for mending it or rendering it <span style="color: #0000FF;">specific </span>by judicial<br/>
decision in such a way that it may become of<br/>
practical use. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>section, against <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspiracies </span>in restraint of trade, is perhaps not<br/>
so difficult to construe; but when it comes to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">definition </span>of what an unlawful monopoly<br/>
is in interstate trade, it is no wonder that even<br/>
at this late date there has been no satisfactory<br/>
judicial decision which can be used as a guide<br/>
by those charged with the immediate execution<br/>
of the law."<br/>
<br/>
His anti-trust decision, however, was not the<br/>
only instance when Judge Taft made a <span style="color: #ff0000;">preeedent</span>. He established also the law of patent<br/>
rights. Here was not only an entirely different<br/>
field, but a class of litigation full of technicalities. It requires lawyers expert in that one<br/>
study, and yet Judge Taft made himself an<br/>
expert in it too. All over the country the patent<br/>
lawyers <span style="color: #ff0000;">manoeuvred </span>to get their cases before<br/>
him if they possibly could. They were sure<br/>
then of an intelligent hearing.<br/>
<br/>
HOW JUDGE TAFT <span style="color: #0000FF;">WROTE </span>DECISIONS<br/>
<br/>
To appreciate the thoroughness and industry<br/>
with which Judge Taft worked, you should<br/>
know how he wrote his decisions. First, he<br/>
studied the case thoroughly, until he was an<br/>
authority on the particular law involved, its<br/>
origin, growth, and application. Then, without a note before him, he began dictating to his<br/>
secretary, and frequently kept at it until late<br/>
into the night. After stating the facts, he<br/>
would comment on the case by its logical<br/>
divisions. Completing a division, he cited<br/>
references and precedents. He would tell his<br/>
secretary to copy from a certain volume of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">reports</span>, at a certain page and <span style="color: #0000FF;">paragraph</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This was the only time he made use of notes.<br/>
But he had well in mind the substance of such<br/>
quoted passages, and constantly referred to<br/>
them during dictation without a note before<br/>
him. When all the divisions of the case had<br/>
been disposed of in their order, he would then<br/>
formulate his opinion, and this was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">clear</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>a delightfully clear-deduction from what had<br/>
gone before.<br/>
<br/>
His thinking was so clear, indeed, and his<br/>
grasp on the train of ideas so firm, that he<br/>
could be interrupted in the middle of a sentence,<br/>
talk, laugh, or joke, and afterward go on as<br/>
evenly as though there had been no interruption. Or if the secretary himself stopped him,<br/>
being uncertain of a passage, the Judge would<br/>
go back and dictate again, word for word,<br/>
what he had dictated before.<br/>
<br/>
Judge <span style="color: #ff0000;">Taft </span>was mightily hard pressed if he<br/>
closeted himself against interruptions. Usually<br/>
he worked with his door open, though other<br/>
judges wondered at him, and anyone might<br/>
break in on him and be received cheerily, as<br/>
though the Judge had nothing else in the world<br/>
to do but to tell jolly stories. He was<br/>
particularly kind to students in the Law School,<br/>
and he could always find time to help with any<br/>
hard legal knots they brought to him.<br/>
<br/>
But dictation was only the initial stage.<br/>
Judge Taft practically wrote his decisions<br/>
over again and again. The decision of the<br/>
anti-trust case he must have rewritten ten<br/>
times. In this he was like Justice Harlan, who<br/>
nearly breaks the Government with printer's<br/>
corrections, and just the opposite of Justice<br/>
Day, who dictated once, and if the printer<br/>
followed copy, the decision was ready to be<br/>
handed down. But with Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s first<br/>
proofs began the painstaking labor of making<br/>
the words fit the thought, and he would strike<br/>
out or insert a paragraph, change and interline,<br/>
and ask for corrected proofs. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Then </span>the same<br/>
process would begin again; and so on, until<br/>
the words were as glass, through which one<br/>
beheld the figure of Justice, not blindfolded,<br/>
but clear-eyed, with her scales accurately<br/>
poised.<br/>
<br/>
Even on his vacations-for a vacation was<br/>
only a change of venue for business-Judge<br/>
Taft would send for his cases, write out his<br/>
opinions, and send them back to be printed.<br/>
Thus his work went on just the same. He always<br/>
kept the court's docket close up to date, and<br/>
he seemed always ready to take on more work,<br/>
and to do that work cheerfully. It is told <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
