review. Besides these, he had pictures of the<br/>
late Shah taking a water cure in France, of<br/>
the Queen of Roumania, of the steamship<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ponce</span>, of a steel magnate and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">fianc√©e</span>, and<br/>
of half a dozen politicians. Then he had some<br/>
sets of pictures that he had made to order to<br/>
illustrate such stories as "The Making of<br/>
Easter Eggs," "The Making of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Valentines</span>,"<br/>
"American Train <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wrecks</span>," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Sports<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">America</span>," a series on "Child Labor," and<br/>
a number of others.<br/>

The rapid gathering of news pictures for<br/>
the daily and weekly papers is the larger<br/>
part of the commercial photographer's work.<br/>
Everything depends, at times, on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">quick<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">mess </span>with which he acts. When the train from<br/>
Southampton to London was wrecked, last<br/>
summer, the agent of an American dealer hired<br/>
an automobile, took two operators, and drove<br/>
the car as fast as it would go to the scene of the<br/>
disaster. The photographs were taken and<br/>
the automobile raced back to London. Before<br/>
night, the pictures were in the hands of the<br/>
purser of a steamer sailing for the United States<br/>
and a cable told the firm in New York that the<br/>
photographs were on that particular steamship.<br/>
The New York dealer acted with equal promptness. He sent a man down to quarantine for<br/>
them, but failed to get them until the ship was<br/>
docked. By the same method, a 48-hour<br/>
"scoop" was made of photographs of the<br/>

The professional photographer in New York<br/>
City has some <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>assignments. The<br/>
Times ordered a picture of Times Square,<br/>
showing the throng on election night. An<br/>
operator spent two days on the roofs of the<br/>
neighboring buildings in order to determine<br/>
the best point from which to take the photograph. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">camcra</span>'s work was such a complete success that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Times </span>made a two-page<br/>
reproduction of it, three and a half feet high<br/>
by two feet wide, the following Sunday. To<br/>
get a certain view of the East River, a photographer walked, with an outfit of cameras<br/>
and plate boxes, up a cable of the Brooklyn<br/>
Bridge to the top of one of the towers. Another,<br/>
to get a "head-on" picture of a horserace,<br/>
stayed on the track until the horses almost ran<br/>
