<span>AMATEUR <span style="color: #0000FF;">HAND-CRAF'I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span>THAT PAY<br/>
<br/>
to express himself, to do freely and with a glad<br/>
heart the thing his talent has qualified him to<br/>
do. Moreover, if he is half a man, he has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chafed </span>under the system that has hitherto<br/>
kept him making day after day the same parts<br/>
of the same objects; he wants to make whole<br/>
objects, no two alike-to say of a little masterpiece in metal or wood or enamel: "That's<br/>
my work, every inch of it, from original design<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">finishing </span>touches. It represents my taste,<br/>
my individuality, my patience, my skill, my<br/>
industry. I had a jolly time making it and<br/>
I'm proud of it!" Besides, he has all along<br/>
craved emancipation from the cramping tyranny<br/>
of the machine. By the limitations that beset<br/>
all mechanical devices, it trips up <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man's<br/>
sudden inspirations and prevents his getting<br/>
a hundred pleasing and graceful effects that<br/>
would be attainable if he worked with his<br/>
hands. So one can easily understand the<br/>
hilarity with which a gifted factory operative<br/>
achieves his break for liberty. He feels that<br/>
at last he has reached his real <span style="color: #0000FF;">element</span>.<br/>
Nevertheless, he will thank the factory for<br/>
the discipline it gave him. Not long ago a<br/>
journalistic art-critic described our craftsmen<br/>
as a pack of unsuccessful painters, who, having<br/>
too little skill to handle the brush, were getting<br/>
rich handling <span style="color: #ff0000;">tcols</span>. This was clever, perhaps,<br/>
but absolutely untrue. When a man has<br/>
failed at painting because of slipshod workmanship or lack of a sense of beauty, do you<br/>
fancy he will succeed at making exquisite<br/>
jewelry, engraving lovely patterns on glass,<br/>
carving wood with supreme delicacy, fashioning<br/>
wrought iron, or shaping elegantly outlined<br/>
vases? Not at all. His sins will find him out.<br/>
At painting he had a far better chance to cover<br/>
them up, for many a bad painter can get a<br/>
slap-dash effect that will pass for art, whereas<br/>
no craftsman can deal in humbug without<br/>
showing himself a cheat and a bungler. Time<br/>
was, of course, when people stood in holy awe<br/>
of hand-made objects, thinking it pious to<br/>
praise curly plates and hump-backed jugs.<br/>
Happily, that day is past. At present only<br/>
the most deft and able workmanship gets<br/>
recognition. And yet, as sometimes happens,<br/>
a painter fails less through want of skill than<br/>
through adaptation to that particular form of<br/>
art. Having clever fingers, a true eye, and<br/>
conscience enough to turn out a square job<br/>
every time, though meanwhile devoid of unusual imaginative powers, might he not associate himself with a designer and execute the<br/>
<br/>
9369<br/>
<br/>
splendid plans conceived by his colleague?<br/>
I do not hear that any disappointed artists<br/>
are doing so, but perhaps that is because they<br/>
have too exalted an opinion of themselves.<br/>
It looks like petty work, making <span style="color: #0000FF;">salt-cellars<br/>
</span>and paper-weights, after <span style="color: #0000FF;">plating </span>so <span style="color: #ff0000;">granclly<br/>
</span>of art with a capital A. However, it is a<br/>
finer thing, I take it, to excel in small matters<br/>
than to "lizzle" in great.<br/>
<br/>
A gentleman revisiting his native town after<br/>
an absence of twenty years met an old acquaintance, who, when he left, had just set out for<br/>
Paris to study with the best <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>masters.<br/>
"How about your career?" asked the returned<br/>
native; "you're an artist now?" "Yes, and<br/>
no," laughed the other; "my pictures were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">frights</span>; I don't mind confessing it; but I'll tell<br/>
you this, old chap: I can paint wagons with<br/>
any man within a radius of a thousand miles!"<br/>
That was sound, sane, courageous philosophy.<br/>
Hosts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">starring </span>artists might profit by cutting their flowing <span style="color: #0000FF;">tresses </span>and adopting it.<br/>
<br/>
If a possible resource for unsuccessful<br/>
painters, the delightful handicrafts are an<br/>
actual resource for successful artists. Mr.<br/>
Hermann Murphy, for instance, has already<br/>
distinguished himself as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">framc-rnakcr-the<br/>
</span>best, unquestionably, in America. He originates his own designs and executes them with<br/>
masterly skill. The revenue from his career<br/>
as an artisan helps to <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>his career as an<br/>
artist. And this I say without suspicion that<br/>
Mr. Murphy will resent the disclosure. To<br/>
every artist comes the question of a livelihood,<br/>
which question remains harrowing and insistent long after reputation and position have<br/>
been attained. There is not at present an<br/>
adequate market in America for paintings,<br/>
nor an adequate public for our painters.<br/>
They must supplement their incomes somehow, or suffer: why not by employing their<br/>
artistic genius in the production of objects of<br/>
use? There is good precedent for so doing;<br/>
many a famous artist (among them Benvenuto<br/>
Cellini and Quentin Matsys) did not disdain<br/>
the humbler modes of expressing their devotion<br/>
to beauty but left behind them a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>array of<br/>
handicraft products. Meanwhile, the making<br/>
of things other than painted <span style="color: #ff0000;">eanvasses </span>tends<br/>
to contribute to a man's ability to paint. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It<br/>
</span>cheeks his leanings towards a sham impressionism, forces him to be accurate, becomes<br/>
an unsparing critic of his workmanship by<br/>
showing him just where he has succeeded and<br/>
just where he has failed<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
