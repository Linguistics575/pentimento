each almost approach it.<br/>
<br/>
Many millions will be called for by this vast<br/>
system of internal improvement, both from<br/>
local sources and the Federal Government.<br/>
There have been more than So millions of<br/>
dollars appropriated by Congress for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mississippi </span>River improvements alone during the last<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">twenty- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>years. One subject successfully<br/>
carried out will suggest another-in river-work<br/>
and in canal work; and the task, after we<br/>
seriously begin it, will extend over many years<br/>
and will dwarf the Panama Canal both in cost<br/>
and time; but it may fairly be called the next<br/>
great step in the subduing of our rich territory.<br/>
A complete system of waterway improvements,<br/>
such as this Commission has an opportunity<br/>
to formulate in outline, will make our great<br/>
Central and Southern States capable <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>maintaining a population several times as great as<br/>
they now contain, with a higher degree of health<br/>
and productivity and convenience than we now<br/>
have. It will work the beginning of a really<br/>
intensive and scientific culture of the soil as<br/>
distinguished from the era of the pioneer, out<br/>
of which we have yet hardly passed.<br/>

NEW YORK'S PUBLIC UTILITIES BILL<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FAR </span>more comprehensive than the Interstate Commerce act is the Public<br/>
Utilities bill recommended by Governor Hughes<br/>
and pending in the New York legislature.<br/>
This bill comes somewhat as an answer to<br/>
Secretary Root's criticism of the failure of the<br/>
states to exercise their powers in curbing public<br/>
corporations. Constitutionally, the power of<br/>
the states is wider than that of the Federal<br/>
Government because eminent domain, corporate existence, and capitalization are all<br/>
state matters<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The Public Utilities bill proposes to create<br/>
a Public Service Commission which shall have<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
charge of all public service corporations except<br/>
telephones<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>including all railroad, express,<br/>
gas, and electric companies and pipe lines.<br/>
The state is to be divided into two districts,<br/>
with a commission for <span style="color: #0000FF;">each</span>, Greater New York<br/>
being the first district and the other counties<br/>
of the state the second. Each commission<br/>
in its respective district shall collect all the<br/>
facts in regard to public service corporations,<br/>
their actual investment, their fares, their service, and their capitalization-and shall make<br/>
these public. The provisions of the Interstate<br/>
Commerce act prohibiting passes, discrimination, and unreasonable fares are substantially<br/>
incorporated.<br/>
<br/>
The further step beyond the United States<br/>
law is that the Public Service Commission<br/>
shall regulate the issue of stocks and bonds, and<br/>
the capitalization of franchises is prohibited.<br/>
With the actual investment as the only basis<br/>
for capitalization, the annual <span style="color: #0000FF;">profits </span>enable the<br/>
easy determination of whether fares and freight<br/>
rates are excessive<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Where the Commission<br/>
deems any rate or fare excessive, it can order a<br/>
reduction. It can also compel better train<br/>
service and specifically order the improvement<br/>
of time tables, the adding of cars, and the running of additional trains<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The public service corporations have publicly accepted the general plan of the bill, while<br/>
offering numerous amendments. The principal amendment is to deprive the Commission<br/>
of the power to execute its own orders and to<br/>
require that it shall go into court as a litigant<br/>
before its rulings become effective. That is<br/>
the defect in the present New York laws under<br/>
which the Railroad Commission has been<br/>
unable to enforce its orders. Governor Hughes<br/>
opposed this amendment in a public address<br/>
and argued that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">judicial </span>review should be<br/>
confined to the protection of the constitutional<br/>
rights of public service corporations, just as<br/>
in all legislation affecting individuals.<br/>

GREAT GIFTS FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE<br/>
<br/>
N February 7, 1867, Mr. George Peabody<br/>
gave the Peabody Fund of $ 1,000,000<br/>
<br/>
to a board of trustees, made up of distinguished<br/>
men, to be used for the promotion of education<br/>
in the Southern States; and the income from<br/>
this fund, of which more than two millions and<br/>
a half have been spent, has all these years<br/>
brought good results. This public benefaction was, for its time, a very large one; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>the wisdom of Mr. Peabody has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">well<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
