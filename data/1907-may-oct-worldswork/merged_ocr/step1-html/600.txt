</span>Europe, until recent years, was an amusement<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>or the business of merchants or the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ambition </span>of students. Now men who have<br/>
no "<span style="color: #0000FF;">business</span>" to transact go as a recreation;<br/>
teachers in the public schools <span style="color: #ff0000;">go-evcrybody<br/>
</span>goes. Perhaps a million passengers (exclusive<br/>
of the steerage) have gone from all the ports<br/>
of the United States and Canada to Europe<br/>
during the last twelve months, or about one out<br/>
of every 160 of our total population.<br/>
<br/>
An English man-of-letters recently wrote:<br/>
"The time is coming when a large part of<br/>
Europe will become the play-ground and a<br/>
large part of the business of the people of our<br/>
old <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries </span>will be to amuse and to instruct<br/>
visitors from <span style="color: #ff0000;">iieher </span>and newer lands."<br/>
<br/>
While this stream of American travel to<br/>
Europe flows strong, stronger than ever flows<br/>
also the stream of immigration from Europe.<br/>
Italy and some of the Scandinavian countries<br/>
are bewailing the drain of their population and<br/>
are trying to forbid it and are talking even of<br/>
trying to reverse it. Still in almost all parts of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lnited </span>States the cry for men becomes more<br/>
insistent. The number of abandoned farms<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-not </span>in New England but in New York-has<br/>
become so great for the lack of farm-labor that<br/>
a convention is to be held to discuss remedies.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, too, Mr. J. Pierpont<br/>
Morgan and other men of taste and fortune are<br/>
buying great collections of artistic things in<br/>
Europe for the enrichment of American life.<br/>
<br/>
A PROBABLE CURE FOR MENINGITIS<br/>
<br/>
HE announcement-premature, perhaps--that a cure for <span style="color: #0000FF;">cerebrospinal </span>meningitis<br/>
has been discovered by Dr. Simon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Flexner</span>, of<br/>
the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research,<br/>
is especially gratifying. Since 1905, when<br/>
there were something like 4,000 cases of meningitis in New York City, three of every four<br/>
proving fatal, Dr. Flexner has been experimenting in the hope of developing a serum<br/>
that would do for this disease what the diptheria<br/>
antitoxin has done for that disease. That he<br/>
succeeded has for some time been the belief<br/>
of his associates, but it is not the custom of the<br/>
Institute to publish its hopes, or even its beliefs.<br/>
Though no official endorsement of the report<br/>
has yet come, it is reasonable to hope that a<br/>
cure has been found.<br/>
<br/>
However well-founded the report may prove<br/>
to be, it is well for the public to be conservative<br/>
in its expectations. Until Dr. Flexner shall<br/>
himself announce to the medical profession<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
that a cure has been found, there must remain<br/>
a measure of doubt. A serum of this kind is<br/>
the product of development, and is not a mere<br/>
"discovery"; time must therefore elapse before<br/>
we may expect it to reach perfection.<br/>
<br/>
Even then, we must recognize the difficulty<br/>
in the way of its universal application. In<br/>
the case of diphtheria, the injection of the<br/>
antitoxin is such a simple operation that any<br/>
physician of ordinary intelligence may administer it successfully. But meningitis attacks<br/>
the very citadel of life-the lower part of the<br/>
brain and the spinal cord. If rumor be correct,<br/>
the Flexner serum must be injected into the<br/>
area affected-and only an expert or a reckless<br/>
physician thrusts his needle into the spinal<br/>
cord or the meninges of the brain.<br/>
<br/>
But <span style="color: #0000FF;">cerebro-spinal </span>meningitis is such a<br/>
terrible disease-both in respect to its deathrate and the sufferings of its victims-that we<br/>
welcome any method that brings even a promise<br/>
of cure. Physicians the world over have<br/>
experimented with every drug that might<br/>
logically do good, only to fall back on the treatment of its worst symptom-the horrible pain.<br/>
The main hope in every case has been that a<br/>
mistake may have been made in the diagnosis.<br/>
The chief hope now is that the patient work<br/>
of Dr. Flexner has been rewarded.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, here is reason for public appreciation of scientific medicine, as represented by<br/>
the Rockefeller Institute.<br/>
<br/>
It is a curious and most hopeful fact that<br/>
while hospitals are becoming larger and more<br/>
numerous and while the medical colleges are<br/>
turning out more doctors every year, scientific<br/>
medicine is working along lines that logically<br/>
limit the physician's field. Smallpox, once<br/>
so dreaded, now makes small demand on his<br/>
time; one physician can quickly give immunity<br/>
to an entire village. Diphtheria is usually cut<br/>
short in a community by the use of its antitoxin. Yellow-fever is largely reduced to the<br/>
simple enforcement of medical regulations.<br/>
Malaria also seems to be on the way to extermination; it has fed many a physician's family<br/>
in certain sections. Tetanus, sleeping-sickness,<br/>
and a number of other distressing maladies<br/>
have reached the same stage as meningitis<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>But tuberculosis and cancer yet persist, in all<br/>
their fearful ravages. Typhoid fever, when <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanitation </span>fails, is still mainly a question of careful<br/>
nursing. And yet, there is not a physician of<br/>
middle life who does not expect some day to<br/>
administer a specific cure for these diseases.<br/>
