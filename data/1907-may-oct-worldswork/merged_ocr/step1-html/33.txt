<span>THE LESSON OF THE<br/>
<br/>
Could any lesson be stronger? Of course,<br/>
the lesson is negative-it is a warning against<br/>
buying at the time of great enthusiasm, advancing dividends, huge new creations of stocks<br/>
and bonds. It should be written by every<br/>
investor at the top of every page in his<br/>
stock-ledger.<br/>
<br/>
BUYING AT THE EBB-TIDE<br/>
<br/>
The second great lesson is a positive one.<br/>
If a man has patience to go back to the collapse<br/>
of 1893 and that of 1903, and study them with<br/>
an eye on the sudden collapse of 1907, this<br/>
lesson also becomes plain enough for the average<br/>
business man to see.<br/>
<br/>
The men who bought the railroad stocks at<br/>
the worst period of the panic of 1893 are today rich men. The Harriman fortune is<br/>
founded upon the purchase of a bankrupt<br/>
railroad at that time. In a lesser measure,<br/>
one may name a dozen millionaires who<br/>
made their fortunes by similar purchases<br/>
on a smaller scale. In a still smaller way,<br/>
scattered over the country, one will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find<br/>
</span>thousands of men who are to-day comfortable<br/>
because they bought such stocks at that time.<br/>
<br/>
The same holds true of the collapse of 1903.<br/>
Any man who bought standard railroad stocks<br/>
in that year or in 1904 has seen his capital grow<br/>
astonishingly in the intervening period. Even<br/>
if he has kept his stocks through to the present<br/>
time, his revenues are, in many instances,<br/>
largely increased through larger dividends.<br/>
<br/>
In all human probability, the phenomenon<br/>
of 1893 and of 1903 is to-day being repeated.<br/>
Of course, there are differences, but the fundamental facts are the same. Perhaps in the<br/>
next year one or two of the weaker railroads<br/>
will have to eliminate their dividends. The<br/>
stronger roads will not even reduce them,<br/>
unless the most astounding occurrences should<br/>
take place in the country at large. If conditions can be judged at all, they mean that<br/>
the shrewd investor now has an opportunity<br/>
to make wise purchases of stocks.<br/>
<br/>
The third lesson may be put very briefly,<br/>
thus: "Under no circumstances must the<br/>
investor strain himself in buying stocks or<br/>
bonds!" This is all-important. Each of these<br/>
collapses was caused by the straining of credit<br/>
and money-resources. One must judge for <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span>just how far he can rightly go. A business<br/>
man who invests his whole surplus in stocks<br/>
or bonds is a foolish business man, for the exhaustion of working capital led to half the<br/>
<br/>
WALL STREET PANIC 8831<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">receiverships </span>of 1893 and 1903-04. What is<br/>
true of the company is largely true also of the<br/>
business man.<br/>
<br/>
Neither should the very small investor take<br/>
all his money out of the savings bank to buy<br/>
either stocks or bonds or real estate. Savings<br/>
are an anchor to windward. They are not<br/>
merely an investment; they are an emergency<br/>
fund, to meet sudden and unlooked-for evils.<br/>
Enough of them should be kept safely in cash<br/>
to meet such emergencies. The rest may be<br/>
invested.<br/>
<br/>
One hesitates to draw another lesson from<br/>
this panic, because it is a lesson <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofiwide </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">application </span>and of supreme importance alike to<br/>
business man, trustee, investor, and saver of<br/>
small funds.<br/>
<br/>
Talking, one day, with a well-informed man,<br/>
about the reason why the public nearly always<br/>
sells at the bottom and buys at the top, I used<br/>
this illustration:<br/>
<br/>
"Suppose you are a stockholder in the<br/>
<br/>
Magazine. That magazine has<br/>
had a great boom. Its circulation has been<br/>
increasing by thousands a week. The revenues<br/>
are climbing. Under these circumstances,<br/>
you will not sell your stock at any price. No<br/>
one could induce you to get out of a business<br/>
under such conditions.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Brand-by</span>, the boom stops. Subscriptions<br/>
dwindle. In one week you lose 5,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">subscribers</span>, and gain only 200. Just as naturally<br/>
as the sun rises, you begin to look about to<br/>
find a buyer for your stock. It comes into<br/>
your mind that you will get whatever you can<br/>
get out of the ruck. Finally, you turn it over<br/>
to another partner made of sterner <span style="color: #0000FF;">stuff-and<br/>
</span>get out. For a while you congratulate yourself upon your <span style="color: #0000FF;">shrewdness</span>. Perhaps, in the<br/>
next year or two, business revives. In the end<br/>
you may go to the man to whom you sold and<br/>
buy it back again at twice the price he paid.<br/>
That is human nature. It is also the reason<br/>
why the public sells at the bottom and buys<br/>
at the top." That merely points the lesson of<br/>
the panic of March. Its application may be<br/>
left to the individual who reads it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are many other things to<br/>
be learned from this episode, but most of them<br/>
apply to special classes of individuals rather<br/>
than to the innocent investor. Above all else,<br/>
the panic taught caution. Had not the great<br/>
banks of New York been cautious for weeks<br/>
preceding it, there would have been a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dozen<br/>
</span>great failures in Wall Street, and the Baring<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
