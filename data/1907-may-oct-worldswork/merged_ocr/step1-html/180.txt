<br/>
</span>there was an almost riotous demonstration<br/>
when a delegate presented a proposition to<br/>
divide the school fund between the races in<br/>
proportion to the amount of taxes paid by<br/>
each, thus leaving the Negro without the<br/>
Southern white man's aid. The Democratic<br/>
caucus also refused to extend the life of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>"Grandfather Clause," giving the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">suffrage </span>to whites who will not learn to read<br/>
and write, while denying it to illiterate blacks.<br/>
So the stronger race has determined that the<br/>
inferior race shall have the fullest help and<br/>

advocate of universal education and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">defender </span>of the rights of the weaker race from<br/>
whom it was necessary to take the privilege<br/>
of suffrage; and the present Governor Glenn,<br/>
without neglecting his <span style="color: #0000FF;">predecessor</span>'s educational work, has made industrial development<br/>
the keynote of his administration. Throughout the South, too, it ought to be said, there<br/>
has been a broadening of religious opinion, and<br/>
the religious thought of <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>is as far removed<br/>
from ancient blue-law Puritanism on one hand<br/>
as it is from modern iconoclastic criticism on the<br/>

The South, with no immigration, has increased in population and sent thousands of people to other parts of the Union<br/>
<br/>
encouragement, and has also determined to<br/>
make its training fit its needs. Teaching<br/>
agriculture is but a beginning; other industrial<br/>
features will be added; and county trade<br/>
schools will follow in time.<br/>
<br/>
To-day the people demand the discussion<br/>
of practical issues. In 1898, it was enough<br/>
to know that leaders like Aycock and<br/>
Glenn stood for "white supremacy" and<br/>
"party <span style="color: #0000FF;">regularity</span>," and under old conditions<br/>
they might never have been recognized as the<br/>
champions of anything else. Now ex-Governor<br/>
Aycock has made a national reputation as the<br/>
<br/>
other-an advance that is <span style="color: #0000FF;">significant </span>in many<br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
So, at last, has come the enfranchisement of<br/>
the South, the most significant social development of our generation; and in its spirit the<br/>
people are building their <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonwealthsbuilding </span>them on the broad foundations of a<br/>
genuine democracy, developing their industries<br/>
and the wealth of their resources. The joy<br/>
of constructive work indeed is now the <span style="color: #0000FF;">South-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">erner</span>'s; and his blood stirs at the thought that<br/>
these next fifty years the South will have the<br/>
tasks of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">heroic </span>age.<br/>
<br/>
