<br/>
the foundation of mutual friendship and<br/>
admiration between the two rulers.<br/>
<br/>
The results are astonishing. In less than a<br/>
quarter of a century, the German net has been<br/>
cast over the whole body of the Turkish Empire.<br/>
German diplomacy is paramount to-day in<br/>
Constantinople. The Turkish army has been<br/>
reorganized upon the Prussian system, and is<br/>
under German control. The finances of the<br/>
Turkish Empire are gradually becoming a<br/>
dependency to the German banks by loans <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>concessions, which are constantly increasing.<br/>
By the great railroad from the Bosphorus to the<br/>
Persian Gulf, opening up by its branches <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>most fertile provinces of Asiatic Turkey<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Germany becomes master of the economical<br/>
development of this part of the Sultan's<br/>
empire.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the economical and political <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence<br/>
</span>of the Germans has been so much extended<br/>
and has gained such a domination that the<br/>
Turkish Empire is, in a sense, already a <span style="color: #0000FF;">German </span>protectorate. No act of importance is<br/>
possible in Turkey without the knowledge and<br/>
approval of Germany. Every act of Abdul<br/>

</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">brigand </span>band which the author visited<br/>
<br/>
but with a glorious future, the German policy<br/>
has thrown covetous eyes. When Bismarck<br/>
made his famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">declaration-that </span>the Eastern<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Question </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>not worth the bones of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pomeranian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">greaadier-the </span>German policy was<br/>
already maturing a vast plan of penetration in<br/>
the Near East. The real truth is that the<br/>
basis of this policy was the maintenance of<br/>
the Turkish rule, as a means for its realization.<br/>
<br/>
The true extent of German intrigue is not<br/>
realized. I may as well explain therefore that<br/>
the policy <span style="color: #0000FF;">was-<br/>
</span>(r) Support, and even encouragement, of<br/>
the despotical regime in Turkey, thus to obtain<br/>
the absolute confidence of Sultan Hamid.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Grasp of the reorganization of the<br/>
Turkish army, to use it <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
(3) Gain a dominant position in the Turkish<br/>
finances.<br/>
<br/>
(4) Lay hold on the communications of the<br/>
empire, and thus become the master of its<br/>
economical development.<br/>
<br/>
A full expansion was given to this policy<br/>
after the accession to the throne of William <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">=</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
