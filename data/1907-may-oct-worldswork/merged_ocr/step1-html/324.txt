appreciative of noble sentiment wrought into<br/>
marble and bronze, or made luminous upon<br/>
canvas, or infused into exquisite handicrafts.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, though, the work of husbanding<br/>
the legacy of the past gives us a still more<br/>
practical suggestion. Throughout the country<br/>
the Government prevents the decay of beauty.<br/>
Witness its guardianship of the ramparts of<br/>
Aigues-Mortes, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>city from which<br/>
St. Louis set forth with his Crusaders. Witness<br/>
also its restoration of the towered walls of<br/>
Carcassonne. You might name scores of other<br/>
cases in which relics of bygone ages <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>saved<br/>
from ruin, notably the work now in progress<br/>
at Avignon, where the palace of the Pope is<br/>
re-assuming its ancient glory. And the Government's campaign finds allies in associations<br/>
of private citizens, especially in the Touring<br/>
Club of France, which is at once a rebuke to<br/>
our heedlessness in letting old landmarks pass<br/>
away and to our inability as yet to make those<br/>
that remain as accessible as they ought to be.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, the Touring Club undertook to teach Frenchmen to know France.<br/>
Wherever there was an ancient town or a historic site or a magnificent bit of scenery, it<br/>
insisted upon its preservation and upon an<br/>
easy and agreeable excursion to it. At vast<br/>
expense, it repaired out-of-the-way roads and<br/>
bridges, cut paths where none had been, built<br/>
railings where desirable, and courted the<br/>
response of the tourist. But he, having already some knowledge of country hotels,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
replied, "The only outs are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inns</span>"; whereupon the Club set about improving those<br/>
delinquent <span style="color: #0000FF;">hostelries</span>. When a proprietor declared it would not pay to modernize his<br/>
establishment, since guests were so few, he<br/>
was met with an assurance that if he would<br/>
do his part the Club would send guests in plenty.<br/>
And it did. By crying up the charms of the<br/>
place, it made good hotel accommodations<br/>
profitable-why should they not be, when you<br/>
remember the Touring Club of France has<br/>
100,000 members? If we had an organization like the French. Instead of crossing<br/>
the ocean for our vacation travels, we should<br/>
begin to know the lovely scenery, the historic<br/>
landmarks, and the quaint and curious nooks<br/>
of our own country, most of which are at<br/>
present neglected because accessible only at<br/>
the price of extreme discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
Such, then, are the practical lessons, big and<br/>
little, that France can teach us. A further<br/>
lesson, of purely sentimental value but important for all that, is the lesson of understanding the real <span style="color: #0000FF;">Franco-of </span>seeing the best<br/>
elements in the nation arrayed against alcoholism, against pornography, against vice, and<br/>
against the many follies and weaknesses we<br/>
have so shallowly and unjustly called French.<br/>
They exist in France, just as they exist here<br/>
to a greater or lesser degree, yet they no more<br/>
represent the true genius of the country than<br/>
the aberrations of Pittsburg millionaires represent the genius of America.<br/>

not merely or mainly to institute or defend lawsuits; it is to prevent them. Such corporations<br/>
want the best men there are, for their advice<br/>

<br/>
No great company would think of entering<br/>
into an important contract or of taking any<br/>
step which would be likely to involve them in<br/>
liability, without first submitting the matter to<br/>
<br/>
their counsel. It is the business of the corporation lawyer to know the law thoroughly;<br/>
to know his corporation, its make-up, and all<br/>
its scheme of operations; and to see that the<br/>
corporation and the law do not interfere with<br/>
each other. It takes an expert to do that;<br/>
the work he performs is high-grade service,<br/>
and it commands a high price.<br/>

a corporation, a well-trained specialist should<br/>
