</span>N the campus of the University of New<br/>
0 Mexico, in Albuquerque, are two<br/>
quaint college buildings-the begin<br/>
nings of a group that will give a new lease of life<br/>
to a building type long obsolete. These structures arc to reproduce in plan and architecture<br/>
the ancient Indian <span style="color: #0000FF;">pueblo-not </span>the modern<br/>
pueblo of Arizona and New Mexico, with its<br/>
mixture of Spanish types. The entire group<br/>
will follow the details of the old towns with such<br/>
fidelity that it would startle the long-dead<br/>
pueblo-dwellers if they could see it. Of course,<br/>
the general style exists in the many Indian<br/>
villages of Arizona and New Mexico, but it<br/>
degenerated greatly through the Spanish in<br/>
fluence, as the University buildings will show<br/>
when they completely reproduce the original<br/>
style.<br/>
<br/>
The model for this college pueblo is the prehistoric town of Sikyatki, perhaps the oldest of<br/>
the communal towns in this part of the world.<br/>
It was situated in northern Arizona, amid<br/>
limitless deserts and frowning mesas, in that<br/>
strange land of sunshine and silence. In this<br/>
isolated region, where the Moquis hold their<br/>
snake-dances and blanket Indians climb to<br/>
their homes on precipitous cliffs, are the<br/>
Tusayan pueblos, occupied by small remnants<br/>
of tribes that had reached a <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">degree<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization</span>.<br/>
