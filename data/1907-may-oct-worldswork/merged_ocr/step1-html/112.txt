<br/>
run in for safety <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>food, feed on the larvae<br/>
so effectively as to exterminate them. No<br/>
matter how large the area of a swamp, the<br/>
following scheme of drainage will suffice.<br/>
Extend tide-water ditches, wide enough and<br/>
deep enough to carry the main body of neighboring water in both low and high tides, as<br/>
far into the swamp area as the drainage capacity of the smaller ditches requires. These<br/>
narrow ditches should be from six to eight<br/>
inches wide and eighteen to twenty-four inches<br/>
deep. They can carry about 1,000 feet, so<br/>
tide-water ditches must be planned accordingly.<br/>
The former should be about fifty feet apart.<br/>
Swamps so ditched will, except in spells of<br/>
continued wet-weather, be dry enough all<br/>
summer to walk over "dry-shod."<br/>
<br/>
There are some 50,000 acres of mosquito<br/>
swamp land on the western half of Long<br/>
Island, and 200,000 acres in the state of New<br/>
Jersey. The public does not realize that this<br/>
tundra soil is the most fertile and best adapted<br/>
to garden-truck farming of any <span style="color: #0000FF;">suburban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lands</span>.<br/>
It can raise $ 10 an acre of swamp grass without<br/>
cultivation, and as much as $ 100 an acre of<br/>
potatoes and other vegetables. What an<br/>
opportunity for corporation farming, or even<br/>
for individual garden trucking! The cost<br/>
of fitting such areas for such purposes, where<br/>
diking would not be necessary, would be much<br/>
less than the purchase or rental of customary<br/>
ground. The profits of the near future will<br/>
surely lie in the economies that will avoid<br/>
unnecessary waste and make waste places<br/>
bearers of healthy incomes.<br/>
<br/>
Extermination of the mosquitoes can be<br/>
accomplished in any community for less than<br/>
I per cent. of the realty value, and their removal will easily add <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per cent. to such value.<br/>
<br/>
RESULTS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED<br/>
<br/>
It has been proven during the last six years<br/>
by individual communities, that mosquitoes<br/>
can be so far exterminated as to cease to be<br/>
a noticeable annoyance. From one to three<br/>
years time has been required to do this. But,<br/>
as mosquitoes will fly from one district to another, it is evident that thorough extermination<br/>
is an undertaking for county or state control.<br/>
Both the states of New Jersey and New York<br/>
now have laws giving needed authority to<br/>
various boards of health to declare that any<br/>
territory breeding mosquitoes is sustaining a<br/>
public nuisance, and to step in to correct the<br/>
same if private owners do not do so. The New<br/>
<br/>
THES SECRETS OF THE MOSQUITO<br/>
<br/>
Jersey legislature appropriated some $ 350,000<br/>
last year for progressive application in clearing<br/>
its large <span style="color: #0000FF;">tracts-the </span>Newark meadows, coast<br/>
swamps, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc.-through </span>the next five years.<br/>
Some $ 10,000 had already been expended<br/>
largely in experimental work, the success of<br/>
which led to the larger donation. Staten Island<br/>
has received an appropriation from Greater<br/>
New York of $ 17,000, with most satisfactory<br/>
results up to date. The results obtained<br/>
in and around Havana-the almost complete<br/>
cessation of yellow fever-are a matter of<br/>
general knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
SUCCESS IN THE CANAL ZONE<br/>
<br/>
In a similar manner, a large body of men<br/>
along the Panama Canal are successfully coping<br/>
with a most difficult situation. Both the<br/>
anopheles and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stegomyia </span>are very abundant<br/>
there; but by extensive drainage and filling-in<br/>
on the one hand, and direct fumigative <span style="color: #ff0000;">destruo</span>.<br/>
tion of the infected mosquitoes in dwellings<br/>
where there has been malaria or yellow fever<br/>
on the other, Colonel Gorgas has secured<br/>
wonderful results, some of which are convincingly set forth in the message sent to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Congress </span>by President Roosevelt on his return<br/>
from the Isthmus. As a result of scientific<br/>
methods of extermination in Culebra cut, only<br/>
two solitary mosquitoes were found after a<br/>
careful house <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-house </span>examination, neither belonging to the two fatal varieties. At Corozal,<br/>
formerly one of the most unsanitary places on<br/>
the Isthmus, there was a marsh with a pond<br/>
in the middle. Colonel Gorgas drained the<br/>
marsh and the pond, cleared off the brush,<br/>
and made the breeding spot a meadow with<br/>
drainage ditches. As a direct result, the sick<br/>
rate of Corozal dropped to less than one per<br/>
cent. a week, reckoned by admissions to the<br/>
hospital. There is now a large hotel filled<br/>
with Canal employees and their wives, located<br/>
on what was once called a "hog wallow." The<br/>
President records, with much gratification, that<br/>
only one mosquito was seen by any member of<br/>
his party during his stay on the Isthmus.<br/>
<br/>
Some 20,000 people die annually in the<br/>
United States from malaria. Four thousand<br/>
died during the New Orleans epidemic of<br/>
yellow fever in 1878, and over 300 in 1905.<br/>
The money losses suffered by this city alone,<br/>
if applied to mosquito extermination, would<br/>
have more than cleared every state on the<br/>
Gulf of Mexico of the infected mosquitoes and<br/>
all their relatives.<br/>
