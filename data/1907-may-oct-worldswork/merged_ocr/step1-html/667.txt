<span>THE DAWN OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NEW<br/>
<br/>
</span>of this is concentrated so as to make the average<br/>
along the projected railroad lines from 2,000<br/>
to 3,000 per mile. A continuous line of villages<br/>
nearly twenty miles in length extends along the<br/>
survey line on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Panay</span>, and much of the country<br/>
is so densely populated that a traveler is never<br/>
out of sight of a house.<br/>
<br/>
It is probable that two classes of service will<br/>
be provided, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>differing but little in<br/>
appointments from the standard equipments of<br/>
America. The second, which precedent has<br/>
designated as third-class, will be less ornate in<br/>
finish and will provide fewer accommodations.<br/>
<br/>
Of a million and a quarter passengers carried<br/>
over the lines of the Manila and Dagupan<br/>
Railroad for a given period, over a million were<br/>
third-class, and the equipment shows nine<br/>
third-class cars for every first-class coach.<br/>
Despite the small percentage of first-class<br/>
passengers, this service must be maintained for<br/>
Spanish residents and the better class of natives.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to note that, on account of<br/>
the average small stature of the natives, narrowgauge cars will have practically the same<br/>
numerical capacity as standard-gauge cars<br/>
would have for Americans. Owing to the fact<br/>
that nearly all of the native shippers dispatch<br/>
goods in small quantities, freight cars having<br/>
a capacity of only four or five tons will be used.<br/>
The roads will be narrow-gauge but in every<br/>
other respect will be equal to the best American<br/>
railroads.<br/>
<br/>
THE ROUTE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE SURVEY<br/>
<br/>
The main line on the island of Panay will<br/>
be 110 miles in length, and will serve about<br/>
629,000 inhabitants. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iloilo</span>, the southern<br/>
terminus, the harbor improvements are almost<br/>
completed. and the little white city will soon<br/>
become a busy port. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iloilo </span>to Passi,<br/>
the road runs through a succession of villages;<br/>
with the exception of some thirty miles, where<br/>
the road crosses the backbone of the island,<br/>
the entire distance to Capiz is one continuous<br/>
settlement.<br/>
<br/>
Passi is a thriving city but suffers from the<br/>
fact that communication with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iloilo </span>is limited<br/>
to the dry season<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The backbone of the<br/>
island is a low range of hills, extending from<br/>
east to west, the divide being north of Passi<br/>
and south of Dao. Nearly all of this land is<br/>
suitable for hemp, coffee, rice, and fibre. Native pineapple fibres are woven into cloth and<br/>
nearly every house has a crude loom on which<br/>
the women and children weave sugar sacks<br/>

9465<br/>
<br/>
from the fibre of the palm. Millions of these<br/>
are shipped every year from Iloilo to Negros, to<br/>
be distributed to the great sugar plantations.<br/>
<br/>
Dao is a junction point, the railroad branching to Capiz and Bataan, both seaports on the<br/>
northern coast. The land from Dao north is<br/>
exceptionally fertile and the population is<br/>
dense. The estimated cost for this part of the<br/>
system is more than $ 4,000,000. Owing to<br/>
the large number of streams to be crossed,<br/>
bridges will average $ 7,000 a mile. It is<br/>
remarkable that 3 per cent. of the entire mileage<br/>
will be composed of bridges, trestles, or culverts.<br/>
<br/>
Concrete and steel alone will be used in all<br/>
bridge structures, and the line as a whole will<br/>
be more substantial than is customary in initial<br/>
railroad construction. Railroads are usually<br/>
built through sparsely settled territory and<br/>
require time in which to develop <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>. In the<br/>
case of the Philippine railroads, the population<br/>
is already there and the inauguration of both<br/>
passenger and freight business will be simultaneous with the advent of the carrier.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the island of Panay the land<br/>
holdings are small, averaging about two acres,<br/>
sugar and rice being the chief products of the<br/>
lowlands. The high and rolling country to the<br/>
east and west of the trunk-line is adapted to<br/>
the production of coffee, cocoa, hemp, and other<br/>
vegetable fibres.<br/>
<br/>
Negros, lying just to the south of Panay,<br/>
is probably the richest island, potentially considered, in the Philippine group. Its total<br/>
population is but 5 per cent. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Archipelago</span>, and but <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per cent. of the land is under<br/>
cultivation; yet it produces half of the sugar<br/>
grown in the islands. It is also an important<br/>
factor in the hemp industry. The island is<br/>
entirely volcanic in formation, the resultant<br/>
soil being <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>well adapted to the growing<br/>
of sugar cane. Two large volcanoes, one active,<br/>
the other extinct, are striking features of the<br/>
landscape. From these the land slopes away<br/>
gradually to the sea. Practically all the sugar<br/>
produced is grown near the coast, but there are<br/>
enormous tracts of sugar land extending back<br/>
into the interior from which thousands of tons<br/>
of sugar can be taken annually when transportation by rail is possible. The present output<br/>
of 80,000 tons of sugar per year will rapidly be<br/>
increased to 400,000 or 500,000 tons when the<br/>
railroads are completed and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hacienda</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>can<br/>
be worked on a large scale.<br/>
<br/>
The terminals of the Negros line are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Himamaylan </span>on the west coast and Escalante on the<br/>
<br/>
