<br/>
capitol on February 2, 1897, this story<br/>
<br/>
of monumental graft; but back of that<br/>
lies another story dating from the days of the<br/>
Civil War. Out of three circumstances of the<br/>
earlier day it all came, like a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower </span>from a bud<br/>
--Abraham Lincoln's need, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>'s sterling<br/>
patriotism, and Simon Cameron's remarkable<br/>
talent as an organizer. Cameron's party was<br/>
the party of the Union, and the people of<br/>
Pennsylvania fell into ranks under his orders<br/>
and were drilled into a political machine that<br/>
was invincible. To the same music marched<br/>
the soldier with his musket and the citizen<br/>
with his ballot, with almost the same precision<br/>
of action.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron found power a comfortable thing<br/>
to have. When the crucial days had passed,<br/>
he still held the Republicans of Pennsylvania<br/>
in the hollow of his hand. And, when ripe of<br/>
years, he sought to make his political power<br/>
hereditary by turning over the boss-ship and<br/>
the United States Senatorship to his son. But<br/>
J. Donald Cameron was of a different calibre<br/>
from his father, and the machine wabbled<br/>
badly.<br/>
<br/>
In 1887 came on the stage and into the<br/>
Senate one M. S. Quay. With all of Simon<br/>
Cameron's talent as an executive and none of<br/>
his contentment, Quay soon had the leadership<br/>
in his own hands; ten years later Don Cameron<br/>
dropped under the surface of politics, with<br/>
hardly a ripple to mark the place where he<br/>
went down.<br/>
<br/>
IT BEGAN with the burning of the state<br/>
<br/>
The Quay administration was from the first<br/>
a money affair. The party always had plenty<br/>
of funds. People came" to wonder how it was<br/>
and, little by little, the impression grew that<br/>
the state treasury was somehow at the bottom<br/>
of it. Quay found it expedient in more than<br/>
one Republican state platform to assert most<br/>
unequivocally that under Republican administration the state treasury had never lost a<br/>
dollar. But distrust still grew and the demand<br/>
for an accounting became insistent. It was<br/>
held that Quay was the real Treasurer of the<br/>
state, holding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>through such men as<br/>
he chose to have elected to draw the salary, and<br/>
that the state law limiting the term to two<br/>
years and forbidding the treasurer to succeed<br/>
himself had been practically nullified. If anything were wrong, one agent of Quay could<br/>
pass it along to the next and keep it covered<br/>
from the public.<br/>
<br/>
The treasury was fed by taxes on corporations<br/>
far beyond the state's needs, and the surplus,<br/>
rising gradually to ten or twelve millions-on<br/>
the books-was deposited in favored banks without interest. It was a fact, though, revealed in<br/>
1898, that the banks were paying interest, but<br/>
they were paying a compromise rate and paying<br/>
it into the treasury of the dominant party. The<br/>
mystery of easy money seemed explained. But<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1905 </span>the collapse of the Enterprise Bank at<br/>
Pittsburg revealed that it had millions of state<br/>
funds loaned out to politicians with no adequate security, and that machine politics was<br/>
able to make the bank good to the last dollar<br/>
