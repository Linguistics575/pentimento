<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ala-is </span>henceforth to be mainly a manufacturing instead of mainly an agricultural section.<br/>
As for North Carolina specifically, we have<br/>
already seen that from 1890 to 1900 it more<br/>
than doubled its output of manufactures, and<br/>
since 1900 its growth in manufacturing has<br/>
been four times as rapid as in the preceding<br/>
decade. And all this is simply the revival<br/>
of a former industry and not a new development. North Carolina was the third state to<br/>
engage in cotton manufacturing. In 1810 its<br/>
manufactures and those of the adjoining states<br/>
exceeded those of all six New England States<br/>
and of New York combined.<br/>
<br/>
In the Appalachians, from Pittsburg to<br/>
Birmingham, the South has convenient supplies<br/>
of coal and iron and also great reserves of<br/>
forest wealth. No other state in the Union,<br/>
says the Secretary of Commerce and Labor,<br/>
"offers such a variety of woods, both hard and<br/>
soft," as North Carolina. It is said of the great<br/>
White Oak Mills just completed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greens</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">boro</span>, the largest factory for the manufacture<br/>
of blue denims in America, that the difference<br/>
in labor cost resulting from the mere saving of<br/>
fuel to the operatives here as compared with<br/>
New England would afford such a margin of<br/>
profit as to make Northern competition unprofitable. And perhaps the greatest natural<br/>
resource of this Upland South is yet to be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">named-the </span>people themselves. They are of<br/>
the same stock as those who have won <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">acknowledged </span>industrial supremacy for Old<br/>
England and New England, and here in the<br/>
South their hands have not lost their cunning.<br/>
<br/>
In its primary stages, manufacturing has<br/>
naturally followed the lines of least resistance.<br/>
Cotton, tobacco, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lumber-these </span>it had at hand<br/>
and to these it first gave attention. In 1880,<br/>
of every 100 bales of North Carolina cotton<br/>
the state exported 93 and spun 7; it now exports 7 and spins 93-and but for the unusual<br/>
increase in the state's production of cotton, its<br/>
factories would already be calling on other<br/>
Southern States for raw material. Of manufactured tobacco, the output in ten years has<br/>
not merely doubled but trebled, and the output<br/>
of furniture has increased 1,000 per cent.<br/>
<br/>
No longer content with merely supplying<br/>
the wants of our own people, North Carolina's<br/>
cotton trade with China is now so extensive<br/>
that America's diplomatic relations with the<br/>
Orient are of interest to the entire state;<br/>
North Carolina tobaccos are advertised on the<br/>

Ganges and the Nile; High Point invites the<br/>
Cuban minister to its annual banquet because<br/>
of its fast-growing trade with his island; in<br/>
Thomasville I saw a factory which ships<br/>
chairs to South Africa; the Panama Canal<br/>
Commission rejected offers from all the rest<br/>
of the world and bought its furniture from<br/>
Mebane. In Durham I talked with the president of the chamber of commerce, who has<br/>
just returned from a stay of several years in<br/>
Japan, representing a Durham industry; another friend for whom I asked is now building<br/>
up a foreign trade in cigarettes "on the road<br/>
to Mandalay."<br/>
<br/>
FACTORIES WITH HOME CAPITAL<br/>
<br/>
In nearly every instance, too, these industries<br/>
have been developed by home talent and home<br/>
capital, mainly by men of small means, acquiring further capital and skill with the growth of<br/>
business. Thomasville and High Point may be<br/>
taken as illustrations. Some years ago, a man<br/>
who had failed at another business started a<br/>
$ 3,500 chair factory in Thomasville. Three<br/>
years later one $ 500 stockholder refused $ 5,000<br/>
for his shares. Other factories sprang up, and<br/>
now the sun never sets but that Thomasville<br/>
has shipped a chair for every man, woman,<br/>
and child in the town. High Point was only<br/>
a straggling country village fifteen years ago,<br/>
when three young men invested $ 9,000 in<br/>
furniture manufacturing. To-day it ranks<br/>
next to Grand Rapids, Mich., in output of<br/>
furniture; it can furnish a house from cellar<br/>
to garret except the piano (it will make pianos<br/>
before the end of the year), and has just added<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">street-car </span>and automobile making to its list of<br/>
new industries. In High Point, too, the<br/>
laborers are capitalists and the capitalists are<br/>
laborers; one-sixth of the laborers own stock<br/>
in the factories, and the city claims a larger<br/>
proportion of home owners than any other<br/>
place of equal population in the country. In<br/>
Gaston County, which grows less than 15,000<br/>
bales of cotton and spins 100,000, a considerable number of mills have been built up by<br/>
men who began as day laborers; and his<br/>
friends tell with pride that Mr. George A.<br/>
Gray-whose name has been given to a <span style="color: #ff0000;">milliondollar </span>mill and who is president of three others<br/>
---began work as a boy of eight sweeping factory<br/>
floors. In one small Piedmont town are<br/>
twenty-five men whose individual wealth must<br/>
be told with five figures, who formerly worked<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h </span>to $ 1.50 a day. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mebane </span>one<br/>
