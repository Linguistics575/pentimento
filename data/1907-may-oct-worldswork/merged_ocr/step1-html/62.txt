that <span style="color: #0000FF;">be</span>," the rebates paid illegally to great<br/>
shippers, the discriminations exercised in favor<br/>
of certain classes of industries, the great commissions paid to bankers, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">profits </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">promoters-all </span>are paid by the railroad to outside<br/>
parties.<br/>
<br/>
Promoters and financiers are not railroad<br/>
employees. The millions upon millions of<br/>
dollars made by the construction companies<br/>
which built many of our roads did not go to<br/>
the men that did the work, but to the men that<br/>
conceived it and financed it. The blackmail<br/>
levied on towns in the new lands, in the shape<br/>
of subsidies, did not go into the hands of the<br/>
railroad men, but into the hands of the financiers.<br/>
<br/>
Talking this matter over, one day, with Mr.<br/>
Frank Trumbull, president of the Colorado &<br/>
Southern Railway, who has been in the service<br/>
of the Western railroads since 1874, the favorable impression gained from the Pennsylvania<br/>
report was strengthened.<br/>
<br/>
"It is nothing surprising," said he, "to one<br/>
who knows the railroad men. Carry it back<br/>
into the rebate period, and it will be much<br/>
stronger. I have known the West for more<br/>
than thirty years, years when the traffic men<br/>
made their own rates with shippers on the<br/>
lines without resource to the heads of the systems at all-and I cannot name <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>a single<br/>
man of all of them who feathered his own nest<br/>
at the cost of his company."<br/>
<br/>
Can as much be said for any other profession<br/>
or employment in the world?<br/>
<br/>
That period covers a multitude of conditions.<br/>
Up to only a few years ago, a very large proportion of the traffic of the West was carried<br/>
on what were politely called "special rates."<br/>
That means that the shipper was charged a<br/>
rate, and the agent handed back to him a part<br/>
of the money paid over. The heads of the<br/>
system took the word of the agent for the<br/>
special rate, and credited him with the amount<br/>
he paid back.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I found Mr. Trumbull's statement<br/>
borne out by others. On the same day, I<br/>
lunched with a retired official who once commanded the freight traffic of the Union Pacific.<br/>
He was one of the fathers of the rate system<br/>
of the West. He knew all about special rates,<br/>
midnight tariffs, and all the other irregularities<br/>
of the great and abiding game. I asked him<br/>
specifically whether they used any special<br/>
methods to check up the superintendents and<br/>
the agents in the long years when the road lay<br/>
open to plunder at the hands of its men.<br/>
<br/>
THE HONOR OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>RAILROAD MAN<br/>
<br/>
"No," he said, "we didn't need to. We<br/>
<br/>
knew we should get the returns all right!"<br/>
THE HONESTY OF THE BUILDERS<br/>
<br/>
Turning to the other departments, the<br/>
engineers who run their lines through countries where the coming of the railroad means<br/>
everything, the men who scatter the cars that<br/>
make or unmake the fortunes of the farmers<br/>
and the shippers, one finds the same thing<br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
It has often been charged that the engineers<br/>
who ran the original survey of the Union Pacific<br/>
made it as long as they could, to get the Gov<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ernment </span>subsidy and to make their own picked<br/>
<br/>
lands valuable. Mr. J. B. Berry, now chief<br/>
engineer of the Rock Island, had charge of<br/>
the reconstruction of the Union Pacific under<br/>
Mr. Harriman, when all men strove above all<br/>
else to shorten the road from the original<br/>
survey.<br/>
<br/>
"Well," says Mr. Berry, "we have spent<br/>
something like $ 25,000,000 on this old road,<br/>
and we have saved the whole of twenty miles<br/>
between Omaha and Ogden-and that's several<br/>
thousand miles of distance."<br/>
<br/>
So disappears a slander that has stood as<br/>
gospel for nearly twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
No one knows just how much pressure is<br/>
brought to bear upon the men who run the<br/>
railroad lines through new country. The man<br/>
who squints along the transit makes or unmakes<br/>
the fortune of the speculator who has bought<br/>
up his thousands of acres along the possible<br/>
rights-of-way. The speculator is always<br/>
willing to "divvy-up." In fact, he presses<br/>
upon the engineer the offer of cash, of lands,<br/>
of all sorts and conditions of emoluments. In<br/>
nine cases out of every ten, the engineer refuses.<br/>
<br/>
There is a half-preserved record of an engineer who was running a railroad in Missouri<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-I </span>think it was the present'Frisco main line<br/>
west from St. Louis. He ran it across a pitiful<br/>
farm, while the two lads of the farm watched<br/>
him in great suspense. Presently, one of<br/>
them went to the house and came back armed<br/>
with a long muzzle-loading rifle. He sat on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>stump while his brother came to reason with<br/>
the engineer. The latter was obdurate. So<br/>
was the boy.<br/>
<br/>
"You will get more than your land is worth,"<br/>
said the engineer, "and the rest of it will be<br/>
worth three times as much as the whole of it<br/>
is worth to-day. What do you want, <span style="color: #ff0000;">anyhow </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The boy explained that the "old man" was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
