$ 7,217,101. This is the more gratifying to us,<br/>
because rarely does the balance of trade rest<br/>
with us as against any Latin-American country.<br/>
Mexico's trade with us, however, has trebled<br/>
during the last decade. Last year it bought of<br/>
us <span style="color: #0000FF;">53 </span>per cent. of all that it bought of anybody,<br/>
and sold to us 71 per cent. of all that it sold to<br/>
anybody. The difference in these two percentages shows that Mexico, in its turn, should<br/>
be appreciative. Excepting only Cuba, no<br/>
other country sends so large a proportion of its<br/>
exports to the United States. Furthermore,<br/>
there was but one other country that increased<br/>
the proportion of its sales to Mexico, and this<br/>
other country was our old familiar rival, Germany. With last year Germany ousted Great<br/>
Britain from second place as regards exports<br/>
to Mexico. Yet all countries put together<br/>
did not sell to Mexico as much as we did<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
However, though the exchange of goods<br/>
and dollars is a big item, the presence of the<br/>
American and the American dollar in the<br/>
country itself is a more <span style="color: #0000FF;">significant </span>one. When<br/>
a Spanish-American country agitates the abolishment of bull-fights and introduces prizefights, does that not show an awakened <span style="color: #0000FF;">sensitiveness </span>to civilization?<br/>
<br/>
Then the S. P. C. A. has arrived, and bargain<br/>
sales, and baseball, and the Y. M. C. A., and<br/>
night schools, and the three-ringed circus, and<br/>
a Luna Park under the very shadow of Chapul<br/>

Washington has an American name, is of<br/>
American parentage, and is a multi-millionaire<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The Governor in Guadalajara learns English<br/>
from the language'phone because he wants to<br/>
talk with American investors. There are<br/>
American schools and American magazines.<br/>
There are American daily papers, like the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mexican </span>H <span style="color: #0000FF;">erald </span>and the M <span style="color: #ff0000;">anterey </span>N ews. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Herald</span>, published in English by Americans, is<br/>
Mexico's largest daily and one of the best<br/>
advertising mediums in the republic, despite<br/>
the fact that it can be read by only a fraction<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">newspaper-reading </span>population. This is an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">extraordinary </span>situation for a foreign newspaper<br/>
in any country, and perhaps exists nowhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Altogether it would appear that Mexico,<br/>
for American purposes (and for its own),<br/>
is most encouragingly American. However,<br/>
one may not appreciate how true this is<br/>
until he has traveled in other Latin-American<br/>
countries of the same zone. From Cuba to<br/>
Venezuela, and especially in Porto Rico, the<br/>
American feels the native hatred of Americans.<br/>
But once in Mexico, he is not even a strange<br/>
being. They take him as a matter of course.<br/>
He might be at home, as much so as a German<br/>
in Cincinnati, or as an Irishman anywhere.<br/>
Mexico, you see, being fairly against our border,<br/>
is not the least bit sullen over our "<span style="color: #ff0000;">empiregrabbing </span>propensities." It really seems to<br/>
trust us.<br/>

muscular work or head work, we<br/>
might expect to <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>a steady, regular<br/>
increase in the fatigue that resulted from itso much work, so much fatigue. But that is<br/>
not the case. The "fatigue curve" is not a<br/>
straight line sloping up from one corner of<br/>
the chart diagonally to the other. Instead, it<br/>
goes sharply upward at the start; then for a<br/>
long distance it runs along on an approximate<br/>
level; and then it takes a sharp upward turn<br/>
again<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The level stage-the plateau of hard, normal<br/>
<br/>
working power, where the cost in energy <span style="color: #ff0000;">doesn't<br/>
</span>vary perceptibly-is the "second wind."<br/>
<br/>
You know how it is in <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-distance </span>running.<br/>
At first, the fatigue increases very rapidly;<br/>
a man has to push himself with all the willpower he can muster. Then, all of a sudden,<br/>
it gets easier. It seems as if he had tapped a<br/>
big, new supply of energy; and he can keep<br/>
running for a long time without any great<br/>
increase in his feeling of fatigue. At last, he<br/>
reaches a point where the exertion tells hard<br/>
again; fatigue piles up terribly fast now-so<br/>
fast that unless the runner knows just how<br/>
