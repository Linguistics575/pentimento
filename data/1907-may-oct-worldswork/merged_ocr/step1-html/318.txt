There is also an economic reason why our<br/>
farms should soon be equipped with electricity.<br/>
It will make farming more profitable. An<br/>
electric motor will save farm labor, and labor<br/>
is now hard to get. It will supply energy to<br/>
draw water, to run the milking machines, to<br/>
thresh wheat, to gin cotton, and to do a hundred other things. On a farm in Germany,<br/>
near Berlin, is" an electric plow. It runs by a<br/>
trolley wire which it automatically moves over<br/>
three rows on every trip; it plows three furrows<br/>
at a time and does the work of fifteen horses.<br/>
When the farmers see the uses they can make<br/>
of electricity, if the companies do not supply<br/>
them with power they will build their own<br/>
plants, as they have built their own telephone<br/>
lines. We may soon see many a farmer living<br/>
in an "electric" house, <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiently </span>working his<br/>
farm by electric power, loading his <span style="color: #ff0000;">proddce </span>on<br/>
the freight-cars of a trolley line, and settling<br/>
its price with a purchaser a hundred miles<br/>
away by telephone-perhaps by a wireless<br/>
telephone, for there is already such a thing in<br/>
existence. He can send his photograph, if he<br/>

wish, or sign a check over a wire. He may<br/>
sit in his home and listen to music from a telharmonium in a neighboring city. All these<br/>
things are possible with apparatus already<br/>
made.<br/>
<br/>
And these are commonplace achievements<br/>
compared with the possibilities of electric<br/>
development. The storage battery that <span style="color: #0000FF;">electricians </span>are working toward will eliminate the<br/>
worst features of our automobiles, take the<br/>
trolley wires from our streets, and make most<br/>
farm machinery electric. Sir Hugh Bell has<br/>
predicted that a century hence, with little or no<br/>
machinery aboard and scarcely any crew, ships<br/>
will be sped on their voyages by electricity<br/>
generated at Niagara Falls and transmitted<br/>
wirelessly over the Atlantic. Either the invention of the storage battery or the discovery<br/>
of wireless power transmission would be<br/>
almost enough to insure a commercial flying<br/>
machine. Yet, should no new electrical inventions be made, we have already enough to<br/>
make us far more comfortable and to enable<br/>
us to save much time and lost motion.<br/>

<br/>
Americans, occurs a most serviceable<br/>
<br/>
text for a lay sermon on "What France<br/>
Can Teach Us." Mr. Mason writes with<br/>
authority, being United States Consul-General<br/>
in Paris: "It is well known that, notwithstanding limited resources in coal and metals,<br/>
with not a pound of cotton or petroleum, with<br/>
a stationary population and heavy burdens<br/>
of public debt, France is one of the most prosperous nations. Paris, <span style="color: #0000FF;">gorged </span>with money,<br/>
has become the banker of Continental Europe."<br/>
Then he explains: "The underlying causes<br/>
of this prosperity are a genial climate, intensive cultivation of a fertile soil, industry<br/>
and frugality of the working classes, and, above<br/>
all, the instinct of artistic taste, fostered and<br/>
developed by education and governmental<br/>
influence until it has become a national attribute." In other words, France-a <span style="color: #0000FF;">handicapped </span>nation-has triumphed by the simple<br/>
and praiseworthy device of using its wits.<br/>
<br/>
IN THE last epistle of Mason to the<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looting the land, as we have done,<br/>
and leaving it strewn with abandoned farmsteads, the French agriculturist takes thought<br/>
both for to-morrow and for the centennial or<br/>
millenial of to-morrow. He tills every available inch of his little holdings and raises them<br/>
to the highest pitch of productivity compatible<br/>
with prudence; he conserves their resources<br/>
by putting back into the soil all he takes out<br/>
of it; he has been at this for a great many<br/>
centuries, and the farm lands of France are<br/>
to-day as rich as ever-perhaps richer.<br/>
<br/>
So in industry-especially in the work of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>women. By an ingenious employment<br/>
of their native shrewdness, they have found<br/>
ways to make every moment of the day productive. While tending sheep, vending flowers<br/>
or newspapers on the curb, guarding railroad<br/>
crossings, or selling tickets in the stations, or<br/>
while sitting behind the counters of tobacco<br/>
shops, they diligently ply their needles, and sell<br/>
their work to the great department stores<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
