laughs at. He did not contemplate the redemption of the nation. He attempted nothing<br/>
beyond the reach of his own powerful arms.<br/>
There was his own city, which had his affection<br/>
"in spite of its soot, its yellow water, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>politics." He was trying to make it cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
MR. TAFT AND GEORGE B. COX<br/>
<br/>
George B. Cox was also just entering public<br/>
life, and these two young men were natural<br/>
adversaries. They often met (they meet yet,<br/>
and they do this without bitterness), but they<br/>
did not foregather in the same circles. Cox<br/>
was husky, coarse-grained, and a power in<br/>
the saloons. He was the typical "heeler," but<br/>
he acquired great political sagacity and grew<br/>
to be, as Taft now describes him, a master in<br/>
his art. It is said that his personal hold on men<br/>
comes from dividing on the square. With<br/>
infinite patience he was already building at this<br/>
time what Taft calls <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the most perfect <span style="color: #0000FF;">machine<br/>
</span>for the control of party conventions and<br/>
elections."<br/>
<br/>
Taft fought him from the start. That was<br/>
inevitable. And yet, the only time Taft ever<br/>
ran for office, this man Cox supported him.<br/>
Politics has more vagaries than a cyclone, and<br/>
this was one of them. Taft's ideas of warfare<br/>
against what Cox represents are not the usual<br/>
ones. He does not believe in supplanting one<br/>
boss with a better boss. Taft proposes a<br/>
counter organization of sharp-eyed young men<br/>
who would put forward only the best candidates, and who would maintain their organization the year round. He would take the<br/>
offices from the boss permanently by means of<br/>
municipal civil service. He would separate<br/>
national politics from the administration of<br/>
local affairs, and he would have the direct<br/>
primary. These conclusions evolved themselves naturally during a quarter century of<br/>
antagonism to Cox's spoils system, an antagonism that had a temporary climax in the Akron<br/>
speech, and Cox's feigned retirement from<br/>
politics. From the above it is apparent that<br/>
young Taft was not, like many young men,<br/>
turned from his activities by "the distressing<br/>
effect" of machine rule, nor that he became<br/>
subservient to it.<br/>
<br/>
Within three years after leaving college, one<br/>
year after his admission to the bar, and at the<br/>
age of <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-four</span>, Taft held the first in his<br/>
long and varied series of public offices. One<br/>
of the old Mt. Auburn boys was elected <span style="color: #0000FF;">prosecuting </span>attorney of Hamilton County, and he<br/>
<br/>
TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
brought Will Taft into the office as an assistant.<br/>
Joe Moses, bailiff of the court at the time, who<br/>
made a record for never letting a prisoner get<br/>
away from him, was asked what struck him<br/>
most about Taft as a prosecutor.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, there's one thing," he said; "he<br/>
wanted to get every criminal into the<br/>
penitentiary."<br/>
<br/>
But, throughout, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s attitude has been just<br/>
this toward the unregenerate pests of society.<br/>
In the prosecutor's office he became familiar<br/>
with that chronic miscarriage of justice which<br/>
impels him to declare "that the administration<br/>
of the criminal law is a disgrace to our civilization." We are too prone, he thinks, to regard<br/>
the liberty of the individual more than the safety<br/>
of the community from crime. We extend<br/>
to the felon too many unwarranted chances,<br/>
very much as fox hunters give the fox a start.<br/>
And then, once a conviction is obtained, there<br/>
are the appeals, the re-trials, perhaps based on<br/>
exasperating technicalities that in no way<br/>
alter the fact of guilt. There are the delays<br/>
also, so that the rich lawbreaker <span style="color: #0000FF;">insolently<br/>
</span>buys immunity from punishment, an immunity<br/>
of class neutralizing the equality before the<br/>
law guaranteed by the Constitution, and an<br/>
offense to the spirit of our free institutions.<br/>
Out of such a condition arises another disgrace, the blind though more certain law of<br/>
Judge Lynch. "It men who commit crime,"<br/>
he says, "were promptly arrested and convicted, there would be no mob for the purpose<br/>
of lynching." The remedy rests with the courts.<br/>

DRIVING OUT A BLACKLEG LAWYER<br/>
<br/>
Cincinnati at the time was peculiarly afflicted<br/>
with an era of lawlessness. Thomas C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Campe<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bell</span>, a blackleg lawyer, usually managed by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>, terrorism, and every shyster trick,<br/>
to get his man off free. The thieves and<br/>
"toughs" even bore the name of "Campbell's<br/>
gang, and they grew more bold each day. At<br/>
last, after a cowardly murder at their hands,<br/>
there was mob violence and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">scoundrels<br/>
</span>burned the court house. Those were harassing<br/>
days for the prosecutor's office, and in the face<br/>
of evidence <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficultly </span>gathered the accused were<br/>
acquitted. Finally a committee of the local<br/>
bar, including Mr. Taft, appealed to the legislature to rid the state's criminal code of "those<br/>
features which placed the prosecution at great<br/>
disadvantage in the trial of capital cases."<br/>
These citizens wanted the <span style="color: #ff0000;">twcnty-three </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">challenges </span>all wed the defense reduced to twelve,<br/>
