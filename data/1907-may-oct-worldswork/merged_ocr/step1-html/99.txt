<span>ARMY LIFE AND DISCIPLINE<br/>
<br/>
the tropics and in the summer season in the<br/>
United States is not a thing of beauty, but it is<br/>
comfortable and is suited for field service in<br/>
hot weather, which is what it is intended for,<br/>
and it will wash. This uniform, and in fact<br/>
any other, is sloppy in appearance when the<br/>
blouse is worn unbuttoned, as the men seem<br/>
to have a perfect mania for doing as soon as<br/>
they get from under the eyes of their officers.<br/>
<br/>
TOO MUCH UNNECESSARY WORK<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Forbes, however, makes some good<br/>
points. In the matter of overworking the men,<br/>
I feel that he is to a certain extent right. There<br/>
is too much of the everlasting grind of drill<br/>
and practice marches, and at some posts too<br/>
much "fatigue" in the way of keeping the<br/>
reservations in apple-pie order. It is pretty<br/>
much of a shock to many men who have entered<br/>
the service to taste the delights of military life<br/>
to find that, from the standpoint of their post<br/>
commanders, the most important part of their<br/>
training consists in cutting brush and weeds.<br/>
<br/>
As to practice marches, a certain amount of<br/>
them are necessary to teach the men how to<br/>
march and carry their packs, but it is very<br/>
easily overdone. Practice marches should be<br/>
held only when the roads are good and the<br/>
weather neither too hot nor too cold. The<br/>
theory that in peace men should make marches<br/>
in rain and snow and in hot weather, merely<br/>
because they would have to do so in a campaign, is in my mind merely rubbish. Men<br/>
expect to undergo all sorts of hardships in war<br/>
and are willing to, but nothing makes them<br/>
curse and damn the service like a peace-time<br/>
practice march in snow or mud, merely to<br/>
carry out somebody's theories about <span style="color: #0000FF;">hardening </span>them. To work out this theory fully,<br/>
we should line the soldiers up and shoot at<br/>
them once <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>week to get them used to the sound<br/>
of bullets. Practice marches are all right and<br/>
necessary, but within limitations.<br/>
<br/>
WORKING HOURS TOO LONG<br/>
<br/>
I further agree with Mr. Forbes that reveille<br/>
is too early at all posts; 6:30 is early enough<br/>
for men to get up from March until September,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">7230 </span>during the balance of the year. The<br/>
day is long enough to get all necessary work<br/>
out of them if they rise at those hours. Retreat formation and roll-call is an old institution, and to the Army it would seem like sacrilege to do away with it. It serves no really<br/>
useful purpose other than that of keeping<br/>
<br/>
8897<br/>
<br/>
track of the men. The abolition of this rollcall, allowing the men not on guard to spend<br/>
their time as they see fit from the conclusion<br/>
of drill until call to quarters, would undoubt<br/>
edly add greatly to the contentment of the<br/>
men; but the privilege would be abused by a<br/>
certain element among the soldiers. These<br/>
latter could, however, be weeded out of the<br/>
army if the service was made so attractive that<br/>
there would be no difficulty in obtaining all<br/>
the recruits desired.<br/>
<br/>
The question of the attitude of many of the<br/>
young <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>toward the enlisted men is one<br/>
very difficult to express an opinion upon, for<br/>
the reason that those officers who cannot speak<br/>
to an enlisted man except in an insulting tone<br/>
of voice are pretty careful not to offend thus<br/>
in the presence of their superiors. I fear there<br/>
is too much truth in Mr. Forbes's complaints<br/>
on this score, but the offenders are nearly all<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>very recently commissioned. As they<br/>
grow older, they realize that shoulder-straps<br/>
do not make a man, and also become more<br/>
sympathetic and tolerant.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know that the officers coming from<br/>
the Military Academy are any worse in this<br/>
respect than those from the ranks or from civil<br/>
life, and doubt if they are. Shoulder-straps<br/>
seem to hurt most very young men when they<br/>
first get them on, unless they have good mental<br/>
balance. The remedy for abuses of this kind<br/>
lies in eternal vigilance on the part of regimental, post, and company commanders.<br/>
<br/>
THE CANTEEN QUESTION<br/>
<br/>
I feel some <span style="color: #0000FF;">hesitancy </span>about mentioning the<br/>
canteen for the reason that every army officer<br/>
who expresses an opinion favorable to that<br/>
institution is promptly spitted and boiled in<br/>
oil, figuratively speaking, by the intolerant<br/>
bigots who drove Congress into that piece of <span style="color: #ff0000;">illadvised </span>legislation. The sale of beer in the canteen would add greatly to the contentment of<br/>
the great majority of the men. It might,<br/>
however, start a few <span style="color: #ff0000;">ycung </span>men to drinking<br/>
before they otherwise would, which would of<br/>
course, be regrettable. The gymnasium and<br/>
amusement rooms for which Congress appropriated so liberally have not attracted the<br/>
men and are largely failures. When a man<br/>
comes in hot and dusty after a drill or practice<br/>
march, he wants a drink of beer and is going to<br/>
have it somewhere or other. He does not want<br/>
to be steered up against a pair of <span style="color: #0000FF;">dumb-bells<br/>
</span>or an encyclopedia.<br/>
