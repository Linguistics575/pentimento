<span>9396 <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE<br/>
</span>parts of the white man's world that are now<br/>
overcrowded.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons for the continued flow at hightide of people to the United States are the<br/>
obvious reasons of higher wages, cheaper lands,<br/>
the encouragement of kinspeople and friends<br/>
who <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>previously come here, and especially<br/>
the activity of the steamship lines in seeking<br/>
emigrant <span style="color: #ff0000;">traflic</span>. Most European countries<br/>
have laws forbidding the solicitation of emigrants; but, in spite of these laws, the transAtlantic lines have a thoroughly organized<br/>
system of drumming them up.<br/>
<br/>
The westward migration to our continent,<br/>
which, by the way, is the largest movement of<br/>
population in the history of the human race,<br/>
will go on for many years, till there will be<br/>
parts of Europe that will need immigrants more<br/>
than we shall need them. All the while, too,<br/>
the shipment of money by immigrants here to<br/>
their kinspeople in the old countries will increase<br/>
even over its present vast total of millions a<br/>
year; and the money spent in Europe by<br/>
travelling Americans will increase with our<br/>
prosperity. In these ways the Old World will<br/>
continue to levy its tax on us, and working<br/>
conditions in Europe will continue to improve<br/>
as men become relatively fewer there in proportion to the demand for them. Thus, it is<br/>
pleasant to think, the wheat-fields of the<br/>
Northwest and the cotton-fields of the Southwest lift the level of life in all the white man's<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Meantime the crowded areas of Asia have<br/>
no such lands for relief. No country held by<br/>
Europeans welcomes Asiatic immigrants; and<br/>
no such relief from overcrowding and from<br/>
poverty in India, China, and Japan is apparent as the North American continent<br/>
affords during these centuries to the densely<br/>
settled parts of Europe. The problem of<br/>
Asiatic emigration and economic upbuilding is one of the most serious that lies before<br/>
mankind.<br/>

ECHOES FROM THE HAGUE<br/>
<br/>
REAT Britain's proposal to the Hague<br/>
Conference that armaments be limited,<br/>
and military expenditures thereby reduced,<br/>
received only indifferent support. But it is<br/>
surely a long step in the right direction when<br/>
the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>Mistress of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seas'u-announces </span>that it is willing once a year<br/>
to exchange plans for new battleships with<br/>
any other Power likeminded.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">MARCH<br/>
<br/>
</span>OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
The chief opposition came from Russia.<br/>
M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nelidoff</span>, the president of the Conference,<br/>
declared the proposition to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>immature," and<br/>
explained how harmful to the interests of peace<br/>
a discussion would be. Yet the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Czar</span>'s main<br/>
object in calling the Conference of 1899 was the<br/>
very measure that his representative calls<br/>
"immature." But, then, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Czar</span>'s battleships had not gone out of commission in the<br/>
Sea of Japan. When his fleet shall have been<br/>
replaced with new ships, the Russian delegation may find the limitation of armaments to<br/>
have approached <span style="color: #0000FF;">maturity<br/>
<br/>
</span>However, there is no real reason for anybody<br/>
to worry over new battleships, larger projectiles, and more powerful explosives. All<br/>
human experience proves that a strong fighting<br/>
force is a most convincing argument in favor of<br/>
arbitration at a time when diplomatic relations<br/>
are out of joint. The peace of Japan is much<br/>
more secure since the performances <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Admiral<br/>
</span>Togo's squadron; and the marksmanship<br/>
records of the United States Navy are stronger<br/>
guarantee of our own quietude than all the<br/>
resolutions adopted at The Hague. The mere<br/>
knowledge that we possess the secret of dunnite<br/>
-an explosive more powerful even than that<br/>
which turned victory to Japan-will outweigh<br/>
the oratory of many diplomats.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the action of the Conference is<br/>
no bar to limitation of military expenditure<br/>
through treaties. At the close of M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nelidoff's<br/>
</span>long speech explaining the immaturity of<br/>
England's proposal, the Conference heard read<br/>
a treaty between Argentina and Chile by which<br/>
each nation will reduce its fighting force.<br/>
<br/>
II<br/>
<br/>
General Porter deserves the thanks of all<br/>
peace-loving men for a sensible suggestion in<br/>
the course of the discussion on compulsory<br/>
arbitration. Germany had taken the lead of<br/>
half a dozen states in opposing this measure,<br/>
on the ground that questions of national honor<br/>
might be involved. Thereupon, General Porter<br/>
submitted a long list of topics--<span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>as customs<br/>
regulations, copyright laws, relations between<br/>
companies and employees-and asked that the<br/>
Conference declare that these subjects do not<br/>
involve <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span>national honor." If this be not agreed<br/>
to, he suggests that individual nations take the<br/>
matter up and agree on as many items as<br/>
possible. Arbitration of disputes on such<br/>
questions shall then be compulsory so far as<br/>
the nations so agreeing are concerned. If his<br/>
