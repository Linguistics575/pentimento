deposits shows the marvelous increase of productive activity-from less than <span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span>millions in<br/>
1900 to more than 15 millions in 1906; and<br/>
the value of manufactured products from <span style="color: #ff0000;">15<br/>
</span>millions to more than 25 millions. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Within </span>the<br/>
same period the number of pupils in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colleges </span>and higher schools has increased from<br/>
5,200 to 7,100.<br/>
<br/>
The city now claims 140,000 inhabitants.<br/>
The census of 1900 gave it 80,000. And the<br/>
location of Nashville is extraordinary in <span style="color: #0000FF;">this</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is almost equidistant from Cincinnati,<br/>
Chicago, St. Louis, and again from Pensacola,<br/>
Mobile, and New Orleans.<br/>
<br/>
THE FUTURE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>VIRGINIA<br/>
<br/>
Virginia is not in the cotton belt and it has<br/>
not, therefore, shared directly in the increased<br/>
wealth that has come from the rise in the price<br/>
of cotton. But in all its chief cities-Norfolk,<br/>
Lynchburg, Petersburg, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Richmond-ond </span>in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the rural regions, the same sort of<br/>
advancement has taken place and is taking<br/>
place as in the cotton states.<br/>
<br/>
Within twenty years, the average size of the<br/>
farms has been reduced from 400 to 200 acres<br/>
and the number increased from 75,000 to<br/>
160,000. Last year 2,400 farmers from other<br/>
states went to Virginia and invested ten<br/>
millions in farming. Stock-raising has had a<br/>
new impetus. It need not be said that the<br/>
<br/>
valley of Virginia is, for agriculture as well as<br/>
for climate, one of the most attractive parts<br/>
of the continent. Nor need it be said to any<br/>
