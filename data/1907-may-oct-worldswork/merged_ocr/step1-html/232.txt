geographically, it is the<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>logical port for a vast<br/>
area west and southwest of it; and the building<br/>
of the new railroad from the mountains, with<br/>
a very gradual grade, is a significant event.<br/>
It is perhaps the best food-market that we<br/>
have-sea-food from Chesapeake Bay and<br/>
fruit and vegetables and game from the country<br/>
nearby.<br/>

"I used to know everybody that I saw on<br/>
the streets," said an old resident, "but during<br/>
the last year or two I do not know one in ten."<br/>

A man who went from Pennsylvania to<br/>
Norfolk to live was asked why he went: "I<br/>
read the papers and saw that nobody was selling<br/>
out. All the things that were for sale here<br/>
denoted improvement, not motion <span style="color: #0000FF;">backward</span>."<br/>

One indication of the growth of organization<br/>
is the career of The Eastern Shore of Virginia<br/>
Produce Exchange, started in 1900 with <span style="color: #0000FF;">500<br/>
</span>members. Now it has the patronage of more<br/>
than 2,500 growers, and has increased its<br/>
business from $ 250,000 to $ 1,500,000.<br/>

Charleston has long kept stationary, and its<br/>
Negro population has increased. It is a<br/>
charming old city, with a proud social quality<br/>
and an antique flavor. Invitations to the balls<br/>
of the St. Cecilia Society are yet delivered by<br/>
hand not by post, just as they were before the<br/>
post-office was established. But, after years<br/>
of resting, this old city, too, has felt the touch<br/>
of modern ways.<br/>
<br/>
No one knows our country who has not<br/>
spent some time in Charleston and in New<br/>
Orleans; and their foreign qualities are fast<br/>
passing. New Orleans was foreign because of<br/>
its French population; Charleston because it<br/>
was inbred for 200 years; or, perhaps, the<br/>
better way to say it is, that Charleston remained<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">American </span>and the rest of the United States<br/>
in varying degrees and in many ways moved<br/>
on-away from Colonial life.<br/>
<br/>
Truck farming is not limited to the coast. Its<br/>
area extends to considerable distances inland.<br/>
At Goldsboro, N. C., for instance, its influence<br/>
is felt. This is not only a trucking centre<br/>
itself but it has a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">jobbing </span>trade for a<br/>
wide area, and it is fast becoming a manufacturing city; and it has become, in consequence, a new town-new in fact and new<br/>
in spirit. It holds a place of honor for the<br/>
early energy that it showed in developing its<br/>
schools in modern ways.<br/>
<br/>
The whole coast line is a garden, and<br/>
much of the Gulf coast, far on into Texas.<br/>
How vast and profitable this industry is, a<br/>

A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
short description of cabbage culture near<br/>
Charleston will show. The following facts<br/>
were gathered by Mr. J. A. Hoyt, of<br/>
Charleston:<br/>
<br/>
Between $ 7,000,000 and $ 9,000,000 worth<br/>
of fruit and vegetables are sent every year<br/>
from South Carolina. Cabbage, potatoes,<br/>
asparagus, lettuce, snap-beans, strawberries,<br/>
in the order named, are the staples; but carrots,<br/>
radishes, cauliflower, onions, tomatoes, eggplants, beets, and peas are grown. Fields of<br/>
200 to 300 acres of cabbages are not uncommon,<br/>
and there is one planter who has 1,000 acres.<br/>
This man began as a farm laborer fifteen years<br/>
ago, with a monthly wage of <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ho</span>. He came<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Georgia-and </span>his wife taught him to read.<br/>
Now it costs him $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">110,000 </span>to plant and to<br/>
cultivate his crop. His telegraph bill, to keep in<br/>
touch with a changing market, runs up to $ 100<br/>
a day. The shipping sheds require seven<br/>
miles of railroad siding to accommodate them.<br/>
At the little station called Meggett, six large<br/>
locomotives are required to do the shifting at<br/>
the loading season. The cutting season lasts<br/>
from the middle of March to the middle of<br/>
May<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>For thirteen miles, in one place, nothing is<br/>
visible from the seat of a buggy but <span style="color: #0000FF;">cabbage</span>.<br/>
The whole world seems made <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cabbage</span>, and<br/>
they are hauled away at the rate of 200 carloads<br/>
a day. Buyers come there from many markets.<br/>
In the main shipping office there are telegraph<br/>
operators, a number of stenographers, bookkeepers, and shipping clerks. Sometimes, on<br/>
a single day, shipments will be made to half<br/>
the states in the Union. Of the 200 cars that<br/>
leave <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meggctt </span>daily, each contains 200 crates,<br/>
a total of 40,000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">cratcs- </span>$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">60</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo </span>worth of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cabbages </span>shipped daily from one little station<br/>
for about two months.<br/>
<br/>
Two men from Rhode Island went to Beaufort, S. C., and began planting truck. Last<br/>
year they netted $ 10,000 from 36 acres of<br/>
radishes, two crops on the same ground. These<br/>
two radish crops were followed by a crop of<br/>
beets; the beets were in turn followed by a<br/>
crop of cucumbers, and the cucumbers by<br/>
corn-five crops a year!<br/>
<br/>
There are some 30,000 acres planted in<br/>
truck around Charleston. An average yield<br/>
of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">150 </span>an acre brings $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">4</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">soo</span>, ooo to this city<br/>
alone. The total is really larger because this<br/>
calculation takes in only the main crop and<br/>
there are several crops a year.<br/>
<br/>
As of almost all the other capitals, most of<br/>
