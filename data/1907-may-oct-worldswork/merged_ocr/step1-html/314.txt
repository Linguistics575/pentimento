<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In place of a coal range or a gas stove, their<br/>
kitchens have a plain wooden table with a back<br/>
board holding sockets, to which the pots <span style="color: #ff0000;">and</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>pans are connected by wire. Instead of building a fire, the cook turns on the switch. Nothing<br/>
needs to be heated except while it is in use.<br/>
Equipped with an electrical stove and fans,<br/>
the kitchen remains as cool as any other part of<br/>
the house. In the laundry, a small motor runs<br/>
the washing machine. The irons <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>heated<br/>
from <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">electric-light </span>socket and maintain an even temperature. One faucet serves<br/>
for both hot and cold water. Around it is<br/>
placed an electric coil; when the current is<br/>
turned on, the water is heated as it passes<br/>
through the pipe, and when the current is off the<br/>
water, of course, runs cold. There are <span style="color: #0000FF;">other<br/>

<br/>
</span>heating coils which may be connected with<br/>
the light sockets and used for warming anything from the baby's milk in the middle of<br/>
the night to a hot toddy in the afternoon. The<br/>
current in the electric heaters can be turned<br/>
on or off at will, and in the summer they can<br/>
be removed altogether. An electric hot-water<br/>
bag-which contains no water and is not a bag<br/>
but a woolen pad heated by wires-would<br/>
have prevented, had it been used, the sickness<br/>
of the poor student who, during a coal-strike,<br/>
went to bed with a hot-water bottle and awoke<br/>
in the morning with a violent cold, his feet<br/>
resting on a rubber-covered cake of ice.<br/>
The dining-room, with a coffee percolator, a<br/>
tea-pot, a chafing-dish, and a toaster, makes<br/>
it easy to dispense with the kitchen for <span style="color: #0000FF;">some<br/>
