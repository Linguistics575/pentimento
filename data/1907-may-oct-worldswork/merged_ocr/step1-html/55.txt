</span>FRICK, THE SILENT 8853<br/>
<br/>
"The future of a man who has accomplished so much<br/>
in a life not yet forty years in extent, could hardly be<br/>
predicted. Indeed, it would seem almost impossible <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>estimate the probabilities.'Bright, active, and brainy<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>this young man has shown already the possession of the<br/>
highest qualities of financial generalship and business<br/>
management, and the fact that he is universally recognized<br/>
as one of the most prominent men of Pittsburg is sufficient<br/>
to give promise of an exceptionally brilliant and useful<br/>
career."<br/>
<br/>
This judgment took more practical form in<br/>
that same year, when Mr. Carnegie chose Mr.<br/>
Frick for chairman of Carnegie Brothers &<br/>
Company, Limited, the reorganization of<br/>
Carnegie Brothers. There was an underlying<br/>
purpose in this selection. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carnegie </span>were<br/>
embroiled in labor disputes over a change<br/>
they proposed to make in the system of paying<br/>
wages. Hitherto the wages had been paid<br/>
on a tonnage basis; that is, the men received<br/>
so much per ton produced. The increase in<br/>
production by means of improved machinery<br/>
without a proportionate increase in the number<br/>
of employees had caused the wages of some of<br/>
the men to rise as high as $ 15 a day. Mr.<br/>
Andrew Carnegie tried to change this state of<br/>
affairs by substituting the sliding scale as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>basis for wages. Under the sliding scale,<br/>
wages would be proportioned to the prices<br/>
received by the company for raw steel.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Carnegie had put his proposition of a<br/>
new wage scale to the test in 1889, and he had<br/>
been practically routed by the Amalgamated<br/>
Association of Iron and Steel Workers. He<br/>
had to consent to a three-year agreement that<br/>
was obnoxious to him. He determined, <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore</span>, to be in better condition to fight in 1892,<br/>
and he looked for the strongest man to lead the<br/>
fight<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>That man was H. C. Frick.<br/>
<br/>
THE HOMESTEAD BATTLE<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Frick at once began to strengthen his<br/>
hands for the conflict. F irst, he would complete<br/>
the Carnegie monopoly in the Pittsburg steel<br/>
industry. This he achieved by the purchase<br/>
of the Duquesne Steel Works, which he bought<br/>
for the company with $ 1,000,000 in bonds.<br/>
The bond issue was a clever device, for the<br/>
works earned the value of the bonds during the<br/>
first year, so that they cost the Carnegie Company practically not one cent.<br/>
<br/>
The other task of Mr. Frick's defensive<br/>
campaign was to unify the corporate control<br/>
of the subsidiary corporations of the Carnegie<br/>
steel interests. On July I, 1892, he consolidated all these scattered interests into one<br/>
<br/>
corporate body, under his control, as the<br/>
Carnegie Steel Company, Limited.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Frick was now ready to give battle.<br/>
Mr. Carnegie entrusted the whole responsibility of the approaching strike to Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick</span>,<br/>
and went to Scotland, where he remained in<br/>
unbroken seclusion during the dramatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">episodes </span>that followed. Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>carried on the<br/>
negotiations with the strikers, who conceded<br/>
the principle of the sliding scale, but who<br/>
refused to agree to other demands of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">company </span>and who insisted on the recognition of<br/>
the Amalgamated Association. On July I,<br/>
1892, a strike was declared at the Homestead<br/>
works, and the strikers took possession and<br/>
fortified the works.<br/>
<br/>
It is not necessary here to go into the details<br/>
of the Homestead strike. They are ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">history</span>, and the justice of either side's demands is<br/>
still in dispute. But so far as its events throw<br/>
light on Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick</span>'s character, it is sufficient<br/>
to assume that he believed the demands of<br/>
the company to be fair, and to know that,<br/>
whether he thought them fair or not, he fought<br/>
out their consequences with silent persistence<br/>
through riots, bloodshed, threats of <span style="color: #0000FF;">assassination</span>, and a storm of public <span style="color: #0000FF;">execration </span>which<br/>
he made no attempt to <span style="color: #0000FF;">conciliate </span>or appease.<br/>
<br/>
After the strike was declared, Mr. Frick<br/>
demanded that the sheriff of Allegheny County<br/>
protect the company's works at Homestead.<br/>
Four thousand armed strikers deported the<br/>
sheriff and his deputies and sent them home<br/>
to Pittsburg. Mr <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>replied with two<br/>
barges loaded with 300 armed Pinkerton<br/>
detectives. The strikers met them with rifle<br/>
shots and dynamite, and after a day of battle<br/>
in which ten men were killed and sixty wounded,<br/>
captured the Pinkertons and disarmed them.<br/>
A week later 8,000 State troops put an end to<br/>
the private war.<br/>
<br/>
During these days of violence, Mr. Frick<br/>
was besieged with every form of pressure to<br/>
induce him to end the strike. Public opinion<br/>
throughout the country raged against him.<br/>
Political influences worked upon him, and the<br/>
hostility of a Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania hampered his fight. To all appeals<br/>
he was obdurate. He had made up his mind<br/>
that he would win this <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span>, as he always had<br/>
won before, and at any cost. His life was<br/>
threatened. He walked or rode to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">office<br/>
</span>daily, unattended and unafraid.<br/>
<br/>
On July <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3d</span>, a Russian anarchist from New<br/>
York named Berkmann, who had no <span style="color: #ff0000;">connec<br/>
<br/>
