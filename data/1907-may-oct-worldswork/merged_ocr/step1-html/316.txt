heating at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">5-cent </span>rate was found too expensive. The general domestic use of electricity<br/>
is a new thing. The electrical companies have<br/>
not, until lately, manufactured cooking and<br/>
heating appliances or encouraged the use of<br/>
small motors. A certain timidity and great<br/>
ignorance on the part of the public still retards<br/>
their general adoption. Moreover, it is only<br/>
lately that electric power has been generally<br/>
for sale, even in the largest of our cities<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>To the people who employ servants, the<br/>
adoption of electricity will mean more comfort<br/>
and luxury; they will therefore be the first to<br/>
adopt it, for such improvements pass through<br/>
the hands of the luxurious before they reach<br/>
the less well-do-to. Fewer servants will be<br/>
needed and those that continue to serve will<br/>
have to learn a domestic science in which brains<br/>
are at a higher premium than now. But the<br/>
great number of American families in which<br/>
there are no servants will profit most by reducing<br/>
the lost motion of household work. The<br/>
life that the average farmer's wife leads is not<br/>
a credit to the twentieth century. The business<br/>
of housekeeping by electricity would itself keep<br/>

<br/>
Let us look at a common farmhouse equipped<br/>
It has a cool, clean kitchen;<br/>
a laundry where all the hard work is done by<br/>
an electric motor; good lights, with no lamps<br/>
to fill; and a small vacuum cleaner run by<br/>
electricity replaces the broom. A cleaner<br/>
house and better food in half the time! The<br/>
sewing-machine is run by electricity and the<br/>
incubator in the cellar is heated at an even<br/>
temperature in the same way. The tank on<br/>
the top of the house is filled by an electrically<br/>
run pump and there is running water in the<br/>
house. The woman who lives in this house<br/>
has not the dull, tired look which we see<br/>
so often now.<br/>
