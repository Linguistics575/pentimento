On the tenth day they came out, but not<br/>
where a salvage party awaited them with wire<br/>
netting. They reached the top of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">canon<br/>
</span>at "The Devil's Slide," a faint crease in the<br/>
almost perpendicular cliff 2,000 feet high.<br/>
Then they started for the nearest telegraph<br/>
station.<br/>
<br/>
"Come along Bill!" said Fellows, joyously,<br/>
as they began their nine-mile tramp. "There's<br/>
beefsteak, and baccy, and a bed at the end of<br/>
the road." -C. H. FORBES-LINDSAY.<br/>

A SCHOOL THAT GUARDS A TOWN'S FOOD<br/>
<br/>
HE Westfield, Mass., Normal School, a<br/>
<br/>
state institution, has made it practically<br/>
impossible to sell adulterated foods in the<br/>
town. The groceries, canned goods, meats,<br/>
and medicines sold in its best stores may be<br/>
used without fear of adulterants. In 1902,<br/>
Mr. L. B. Allyn became the teacher of<br/>
chemistry. He was quiet and unassuming,<br/>
but it was a practical kind of chemistry that he<br/>
taught and his pupils were enthusiastic in their<br/>
work. Foodstuffs were purchased and analyzed. Aniline dye, boracic acid, wood alcohol,<br/>
and many other adulterants were found in<br/>
large and small quantities in these articles of<br/>
common domestic consumption.<br/>
<br/>
The people of Westfield heard of the work in<br/>
the chemical laboratory of the Normal School.<br/>
When they were in doubt about any drugs,<br/>
gelatine, milk, or other articles of food, they<br/>
began to send them to the school for analysis.<br/>
Then the merchants began to hear about Mr.<br/>
Allyn. There was adverse criticism of both the<br/>
work and the workers. While this was going<br/>
on, a judge in a nearby town died from arsenical<br/>
poison, supposedly from wall-paper. This<br/>
caused much excitement and the townspeople<br/>
determined to be careful. A merchant who<br/>
had contracted to paper a large dwelling<br/>
had the paper analyzed at the school. This,<br/>
of course, brought the school into greater<br/>
prominence. It also brought forth more criticism, but by this time the people had developed<br/>
a faith in the school. The merchants alone<br/>
were unconvinced. Mr. Brodeur, the principal, invited them to the laboratory. They<br/>
saw the pupils extract <span style="color: #ff0000;">adultcrants </span>from goods<br/>
taken from their own shelves. Wood alcohol was<br/>
found in an extract of vanilla, and boric acid<br/>
used as a preservative for lambs' tongues. In<br/>
some strawberry jam one pupil found apple<br/>
stock and aniline dye, and also some seeds.<br/>
When planted, the seeds developed into<br/>

hardy clover. That was enough. If a drummer wants to sell goods in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Westfield </span>now, they<br/>
must bear the stamp of approval from the<br/>
Normal School. If they are condemned the<br/>
merchants do not buy. They have asked and<br/>
received the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation </span>of the board of health.<br/>
A section of its office is reserved for foodstuffs<br/>
that have been carefully analyzed and honestly<br/>
labeled.<br/>
<br/>
The school is also educating the people to<br/>
avoid injurious medicines. One of the women<br/>
residents of Westfield took pills habitually,<br/>
which relieved her only temporarily. When<br/>
the pain returned she took them again, but<br/>
grew worse. A physician told her that her<br/>
condition was caused by the pills, but she had<br/>
so much faith in them that she discredited the<br/>
doctor and continued their use. Some time<br/>
later her face became a dark, ashy color,<br/>
her respiration was slow, her pulse very low.<br/>
Samples of the pills were sent to the Normal<br/>
School laboratory for analysis, where they<br/>
were found to be highly injurious. As she<br/>
had absolute faith in Mr. Allyn's analysis, she<br/>
stopped taking them and has regained her<br/>
normal health.<br/>
<br/>
The school influence protects honest goods<br/>
while exposing the dishonest. A short time<br/>
ago a young woman of Springfield was slightly<br/>
ill and purchased a remedy which she was in<br/>
the habit of taking. After the first dose, she<br/>
felt a numbness in her arms; the numbness<br/>
increased until, after the third dose, partial<br/>
paralysis set in. The physician summoned<br/>
thought she showed symptoms of arsenical<br/>
poisoning. He sent a sample of the drug to<br/>
Mr. Allyn for analysis, and it was found<br/>
pure, although the patient showed every indication of poisoning. The druggist who<br/>
sold it can appreciate the value of an honest<br/>
analysis. Her condition was due to some other<br/>
cause.<br/>
<br/>
The school has educated the community<br/>
as well as its pupils. It is a live, constructive<br/>
force in the town, and it has aroused the<br/>
people, the merchants, and the board of<br/>
health to a realization <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the dangers of<br/>
adulterants.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of education is more effective than<br/>
pure food laws and it makes such costly<br/>
paternalism unnecessary. It is the kind of<br/>
education on which the fathers counted when<br/>
they framed our government-an education<br/>
which would make the people able to take <span style="color: #0000FF;">care<br/>
</span>of themselves,<br/>
