</span>thousands of people keep their families in one<br/>
municipality and do their business in another,<br/>
it is impossible that the distribution of taxes<br/>
should be even approximately equitable, or<br/>
that the expenditures for schools in particular<br/>
should be equitably divided between the business centre and the residence quarter.<br/>
<br/>
But it is in financing that the greatest<br/>
losses and inconveniences occur. When a<br/>
territory which should be under one control is<br/>
divided between twenty or thirty city and town<br/>
governments, the borrowing capacity of the<br/>
different municipalities will show great <span style="color: #0000FF;">varia..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tions</span>, those with the smallest credit being<br/>
unable to avail themselves of the superior<br/>
credit of larger or richer neighbors. Under<br/>
such circumstances, the prosperity and comfort of the entire region are diminished, because<br/>
no intelligent plan can be made and carried<br/>
out for either the construction or the maintenance of the highways, bridges, subways,<br/>
and other public works which ought to serve<br/>
in the most convenient way the whole community. Each petty municipality will make<br/>
its plans and execute them without the least<br/>
attention to the interests of the surrounding<br/>
communities. That the area under one city<br/>
government may reasonably be largely <span style="color: #0000FF;">increased </span>follows as a corollary from the improved<br/>
means of transportation which have come into<br/>
use within fifteen years. The telephone and<br/>
telegraph also imply larger units of municipal<br/>
administration because they permit wider<br/>
dispersion of the population without any diminution of the facilities for intercourse.<br/>
<br/>
THE PRESENT SYSTEM FAVORS CORRUPTION<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest evils connected with<br/>
municipal government in the United States has<br/>
been the corrupt dealings between the city<br/>
governments and the corporations which wish<br/>
to obtain valuable franchises for various semipublic purposes, such as transportation,<br/>
lighting, and telephone and telegraph service.<br/>
The corporation which wanted a franchise,<br/>
limited or unlimited in time, for money-making<br/>
purposes, was often prepared to pay the temporary incumbents of the city offices largely<br/>
for votes to give the privileges which the corporations desired; and the fact that such opportunities to make money frequently presented<br/>
themselves to aldermen and councilmen made<br/>
places in the city government desirable for men<br/>
who were ready to rob their constituents, and<br/>
betray the interests of the city in these ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">CITY </span>GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN<br/>
<br/>
A corruptible city government was the opportunity for the corporation which was willing<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">corrupt</span>, and the existence of such relations<br/>
made city politics selfish, dishonest, and degrading. The cure for this hideous evil must<br/>
be a fundamental one, because the evil has two<br/>
deep roots; on the side of the city, a bad form<br/>
of government combined with an inadequate<br/>
territorial unit; and on the side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">community</span>, a lax morality as regards the conduct<br/>
of corporations. The substitution for the<br/>
board of aldermen and the common council of<br/>
a small board in which power and responsibility<br/>
are concentrated would go far to remove from<br/>
municipal administration the weak or vicious<br/>
men who are capable of corruption; and the<br/>
enlargement of the municipal area under one<br/>
government would make that area coincide<br/>
with the area desirable for the activities of the<br/>
public franchise corporations. In other words,<br/>
the small governing board of a great city having<br/>
an area conterminous with the region desirable<br/>
for the purposes of a well-organized electric<br/>
railway corporation, or a gas and electric <span style="color: #0000FF;">light<br/>
</span>company, or a telephone company, would <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>in position to exercise the needed control over<br/>
these monopolies. At present such companies<br/>
have often to deal with two, three, or thirty<br/>
different municipalities in order to reach the<br/>
area which it is for the common interest of the<br/>
corporation and the community that they<br/>
should serve. Since these companies are<br/>
inevitably monopolies, they must be regulated<br/>
by public authority. So far as their issues of<br/>
stocks and bonds and the general rules under<br/>
which they shall operate are concerned, the<br/>
state may best supply the needed regulation, as<br/>
Massachusetts has long done through the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">admirable </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">railroad </span>and gas commissions; but<br/>
the other conditions under which they shall<br/>
render their service, such as their use of the<br/>
highways, subways, -and conduits, the transfers<br/>
on electric roads, and the amount of service to<br/>
be rendered, may best be controlled by city<br/>
authority. We see here again how the American cities have failed to keep up with the enormous changes in the mode of life of urban<br/>
communities which applied science has brought<br/>
about during the last twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
STATE SUPERVISION <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>CITIES<br/>
<br/>
All proposals for enlarging the units for<br/>
taxation and municipal administration are<br/>
invariably met by an outcry in favor of local<br/>
self-government. Has not Boston a right to<br/>
<br/>
