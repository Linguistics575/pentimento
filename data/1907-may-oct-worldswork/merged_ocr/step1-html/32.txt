What this means may be understood from<br/>
the fact that it is equal to the value of the entire export trade of the United States in 1906.<br/>
<br/>
In this collapse, many honest and innocent<br/>
investors were badly hurt. Of course, the<br/>
brunt of the battle fell upon the great financial<br/>
interests, who were carrying more stocks than<br/>
at any other time in years. They lost millions<br/>
where the investor lost thousands. To them,<br/>
sympathy would be an insult. They were<br/>
merely taking the normal chances of their profession, which entails huge profits or huge<br/>
losses. Of course, they were, in some cases,<br/>
badly hurt; and, in a few cases, they became<br/>
loquacious and explained to the world in great<br/>
detail just how it happened. Some of them<br/>
laid the blame entirely on President Roosevelt.<br/>
Others blamed a clique of Western <span style="color: #0000FF;">financiers</span>,<br/>
who, they said, had conspired together to wreck<br/>
the market as part of a general scheme to<br/>
destroy the marvelous power <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofHiklward </span>H.<br/>
Harriman. Their mutual recriminations and<br/>
excuses are of little importance to the general<br/>
public. They do not bring back any of the<br/>
vanished values in the stocks sold to the<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
This episode carries with it several important<br/>
lessons to the average man, who does not buy<br/>
stocks on margin but buys them for investment.<br/>
He wants to get his stocks at cheap prices. It<br/>
is much more comfortable to see the stock<br/>
you bought at $ 100 per share gradually go up<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">trio </span>per share than it is to see it go to $ 75.<br/>
Also, one can get half as much again for the<br/>
same money and the revenue will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>per<br/>
cent. greater. For it may be noted that the<br/>
panic has not led to the omission of many<br/>
dividends by the railroads, in spite of the huge<br/>
amount of talk among the railroad <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>.<br/>
<br/>
THE WRONG TIME TO BUY<br/>
<br/>
If there is one lesson that is more strongly<br/>
emphasized by this collapse than any other,<br/>
it is that one should not buy stocks at a time<br/>
when the financiers are making a great "<span style="color: #ff0000;">whoopand-hurrah</span>," and sending the prices to new<br/>
high records every day. The huge increases<br/>
in dividends in the autumn of 1906 were<br/>
intended to induce the public to "come-on-in!"<br/>
If any investor wants to find a parallel, he may<br/>
turn to the records of 1893 and the preceding<br/>
years. In the article on Mr. Harriman, in<br/>
the February number of THE WORLD'S WORK,<br/>
a month before the panic, the lesson was<br/>
<br/>
WALL STREET PANIC<br/>
<br/>
written clearly enough in the<br/>
paragraph<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"In the next year, 1891, the masters of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial<br/>
</span>world had an attack of "sun-blindness" unparalleled in<br/>
history-unless, indeed, it be paralleled by the last six<br/>
months of 1906. They turned to a period of reckless<br/>
promotion and expansion. The earth was very bountiful<br/>
in crops, and the spirit of bounty spread to the railroad<br/>
lords. Twenty great railroads began dividends or increased them. The public came in and bought stocks at<br/>
very high prices. The magnates fed them with rumors<br/>
and with dividends-dividends far beyond the dictates of<br/>
caution.<br/>
<br/>
"This reckless carnival of prodigality was of brief duration. In 1892, the money question became <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">threat</span>. Later,<br/>
crops promised failure. The restlessness of labor <span style="color: #0000FF;">culmin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ated </span>in the Homestead riots, at Pittsburg. Dozens of<br/>
small railroads failed, because they had been forced to<br/>
incur great debts to keep up the pace in the previous years,<br/>
and because they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>too fond of fighting. At the close<br/>
of the year, Jay Gould <span style="color: #0000FF;">died-just </span>before the direful harvest<br/>
came ripe to the sickle of the reapers."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">following<br/>
<br/>
</span>All men know the results. The panic of<br/>
1893 swept a quarter of the railroads into<br/>
bankruptcy, and brought upon the investing<br/>
public the most terrible losses in our financial<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
It is not intended to intimate that a recurrence of these conditions in full measure<br/>
threatens the country to-day. The Wall Street<br/>
conditions are very similar, but national conditions are not at all similar. The great railroads had been systematically plundered in the<br/>
year preceding 1893. They have been built<br/>
up and enriched in the years preceding 1907.<br/>
The currency question was an all-powerful<br/>
threat in 1893. To-day our currency is at<br/>
least solid. The development of the West has<br/>
placed the railroads in an entirely different<br/>
physical position from the position of 1893. It<br/>
is in the financial world, however, that the<br/>
striking parallel may be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #ff0000;">19o2-r903 </span>there was a mild repetition of<br/>
this occurrence. The United States became a<br/>
lavish country. The enthusiasm of the flotation of United States Steel and a dozen other<br/>
trusts and the steady increasing of railroad<br/>
dividends brought the public in thousands<br/>
to the slaughter. The financiers far overreached themselves. The public <span style="color: #ff0000;">falteredand </span>there was a crash that even threatened to<br/>
check the prosperity of the country at large.<br/>
In each instance, the public lost millions of<br/>
dollars of savings by coming in and buying at<br/>
the urgent solicitation of the financiers, who<br/>
had inflated the prices to high figures<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
