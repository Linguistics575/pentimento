<span>THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA IN THE PHILIPPINES<br/>

The elevator service of the building will<br/>
have several new features. In addition to the<br/>
"locals" and the usual "through express"<br/>
elevators to the upper floors, there will be a<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">shuttle </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>elevator for some of the intermediate<br/>
stories. Of the nine elevators which will be in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tower</span>, four will go to the thirteenth floor<br/>
only; three will go from the first to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtyfifth </span>floor; one from the first to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fortyseventh </span>floor; and the "shuttle" will run from<br/>
the thirty-fifth to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-eighth </span>only.<br/>
<br/>
These elevators are of a type in use in<br/>
only one New York <span style="color: #0000FF;">office-building </span>and they<br/>
differ in a striking way from the elevators<br/>
generally in use in this country. The usual<br/>
type has a lifting cable that winds upon a drum<br/>
as the car ascends and unwinds as the car<br/>
descends. The drum is made to turn by an<br/>
electric motor. This arrangement is undesirable in this building; on account of the great<br/>
height and corresponding length of the cables,<br/>
the drum would be too large to fit into the<br/>
available space. This difficult problem is<br/>
solved by omitting the drum and by putting<br/>
at the top of each shaft a motor and a wheel,<br/>
directly on the shaft of the' motor, over which<br/>
the cables pass. One end of the cable is<br/>
attached to the car and the other end to the<br/>
weights which counterbalance the car. As<br/>
the motor turns in one direction the car ascends;<br/>
as it turns in the other direction the car<br/>
descends. The elevators are equipped with<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
apparatus for safety so constructed that if<br/>
all the cables on top of the car should be<br/>
severed the fall would be gradually and gently<br/>
checked. In case of an excessive downward<br/>
speed of the car, the governor under the floor<br/>
automatically reaches out strong steel fingers<br/>
on either side; these press down the steel<br/>
blocks one on top of another as the car descends until the increased friction of these<br/>
many blocks, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>very tightly around the<br/>
wires, stops the descent without a single jar<br/>
and perhaps without the passengers realizing<br/>
that anything has happened.<br/>
<br/>
A radical departure has been made by the<br/>
owners in the letting of contracts for the construction. There is no general contractor.<br/>
The "general <span style="color: #0000FF;">contractor</span>" is a middle man<br/>
who accepts the entire responsibility for constructing a building but who does only a portion<br/>
of the work himself and "farms out" the rest,<br/>
upon which he either charges a commission or<br/>
makes a profit by charging more than he pays.<br/>
In this case the owners preferred to make <span style="color: #ff0000;">contracts </span>directly with the men doing the work.<br/>
Thus they contracted with the several companies for the foundation work, the elevators,<br/>
the brick work, etc. Altogether, nearly a<br/>
hundred contracts were let direct. Thus the<br/>
owner and the architect are brought in direct<br/>
contact with the contractors actually doing<br/>
the work and can maintain a more satisfactory<br/>
supervision. The work of construction was<br/>
begun May I, 1906, and it is expected that it<br/>
will be completed by January, 1908.<br/>
