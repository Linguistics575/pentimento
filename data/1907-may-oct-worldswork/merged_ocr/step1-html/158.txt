<br/>
over $ 100,000,000 cash in the next <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years<br/>
to enable it to handle the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>of the South,<br/>
and to properly assist the development of the<br/>
resources of the South. At this present<br/>
moment the states most intimately concerned<br/>
have blazoned upon their statute books the<br/>
fact that capital invested in the South is capital<br/>
<br/>
endangered, is capital that must be prepared,<br/>
<br/>
to fight for its life against the open hostility<br/>
of the people of the South!<br/>
<br/>
Let us compare this attitude with the attitude of Canada, for instance. In England,<br/>
the Southern Railway seeks to persuade the<br/>
English <span style="color: #ff0000;">investor-lose </span>purse is long-that<br/>
the South is worthy of his consideration as an<br/>
investment field. The bankers point out the<br/>
rich resources of that region, but half-developed.<br/>
They talk of cotton, and of iron, and coal,<br/>
and lumber. They dare not talk of the fate<br/>
of those who threw their millions into the<br/>
South in other days. England knows full<br/>
well that at this moment, in the midst of a<br/>
period of unbounded prosperity, the dividends<br/>
on Southern Railway preferred stock are<br/>
trembling on the verge.<br/>
<br/>
Against these bankers in the English market<br/>
compete the backers of the Canadian Pacific,<br/>
the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk,<br/>
a hundred other smaller companies, railroad<br/>
and otherwise, designed to open the provinces<br/>
of Canada. They, too, talk of resources, of<br/>
wheat and ores and lumber. When they<br/>
exhaust that line of argument, they clinch it<br/>
by a statement, uncontroverted, that the people<br/>
want the railroads; that the people cooperate<br/>
with the railroads; that the railroad commission of Canada is composed of men whose<br/>
private incomes are immense, and that that<br/>
commission has never been suspected of undue<br/>
preference for the railroad against the people.<br/>
It merely stands as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">personification </span>of justice,<br/>
of cooperation between the people and the<br/>
railroads.<br/>
<br/>
The result is that the railroads of the South<br/>
are coming to be beggars in the markets of the<br/>
world. The railroads of Canada <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>but to<br/>
ask, and the purses of the nations are emptied<br/>
for their needs. The burden of it falls upon<br/>
the railroads and their investors to-day, but<br/>
it will fall upon the people of the South before<br/>
many years have passed.<br/>
<br/>
In the face of these conditions, a few brave<br/>
men are building up great systems in the<br/>
South. The leaders in the railroad development of that region at this time are Messrs.<br/>
<br/>
THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
J. P. Morgan, Henry Walters, B. F. Yoakum,<br/>
and, perhaps, Thomas F. Ryan. The right<br/>
hand of Mr. Morgan in the South is Mr. W.<br/>
W. Finley, president of the Southern Railway.<br/>
Mr. Walters is himself in command of the<br/>
Atlantic Coast Line, which also controls the<br/>
Louisville & <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ashville</span>. Mr. Yoakum is also<br/>
on the firing line, as chairman of the Rock<br/>
Island, which controls the St. Louis San<br/>
Francisco. Mr. Ryan, in cooperation with<br/>
Messrs. Blair & Co., of New York, is seemingly<br/>
waiting his time to begin the revival of the<br/>
Seaboard Air Line.<br/>
<br/>
These great systems are doing little building<br/>
except what is absolutely necessary. The<br/>
Southern has let contracts calling for the double<br/>
tracking of the line between Charlotte, N. C.,<br/>
and Atlanta, Ga., within five years. It has<br/>
a line projected to extend.eighty miles in <span style="color: #0000FF;">North<br/>
</span>Carolina, another of twenty-five miles in<br/>
Kentucky, another of about forty miles in the<br/>
same state, and a small line in South Carolina.<br/>
All these can be, and probably will be, postponed if the company cannot raise new money<br/>
during the current year without destroying its<br/>
credit.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Walters</span>'s railroad system is wealthy.<br/>
At the present time, the Atlantic Coast Line<br/>
has but one important extension, a new line<br/>
to run from Newberry, Fla., northwest about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy-five </span>miles to Perry. About twenty<br/>
miles of this have been built. A forty-mile<br/>
extension in <span style="color: #0000FF;">North </span>Carolina has been proposed,<br/>
but nothing has been done toward building it.<br/>
<br/>
"We want to know more about North Carolina legislation," said an official to me, in<br/>
discussing it.<br/>
<br/>
The Louisville and Nashville is revising its<br/>
grades on important divisions, this work covering perhaps a little more than 100 miles of<br/>
the system. It has only a few miles of branch<br/>
road planned for building, and most of it is<br/>
merely spur track to reach various industrial<br/>
plants.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Yoakum is the most indefatigable<br/>
railroad builder in the South, but he confines<br/>
the most important of his activities to the<br/>
western section, rather than the eastern. His<br/>
roads have no important projects east of the<br/>
Mississippi. There are half a dozen important<br/>
roads to be built by these systems if the time<br/>
should ever come when the credit of the companies can stand the strain of financing new<br/>
enterprises on a large scale.<br/>
