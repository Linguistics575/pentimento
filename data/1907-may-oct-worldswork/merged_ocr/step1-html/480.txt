<span>9278 THE MARCH<br/>
<br/>
Influence in the Senate is not proportionate<br/>
to age, of course, but to a very considerable<br/>
degree it is proportionate to the length of<br/>
service; and most of these aged Senators have<br/>
had long service. As younger men succeed the<br/>
late aged Senators from Alabama (though the<br/>
new Senators, Bankhead and Johnston, are both<br/>
past sixty), younger men will within a few<br/>
years fill the places of the present Senators who<br/>
have passed seventy-five. The Senate may not<br/>
cease to be a body largely made up of venerable<br/>
men, as it now is, but it may not for some time<br/>
again have so many aged members.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the high average of age is in no sense a<br/>
misfortune. The House of Representatives<br/>
always has many young men, often too many<br/>
that are too young, at least in experience. That<br/>
is the end of the Capitol <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>initiative and<br/>
audacity find their proper place. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">objectionable </span>obstruction that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senatesometimes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">shows<br/>
</span>is not always, perhaps not often, the work of the<br/>
aged Senators; and the worst Senatorial misfortunes that we have suffered-the misfortune<br/>
of having Senators who represented special<br/>
privileges- cannot be charged to their age.<br/>
<br/>
These recent changes and the changes that<br/>
are likely to come in the near future will causea<br/>
new distribution of power and of leadership;<br/>
and the new political conditions that we face<br/>
will give a chance for men who have hitherto<br/>
been relatively obscure or who-and this is<br/>
more likely-have not yet gone into the Senate<br/>
at all. There, as elsewhere in our political life,<br/>
brilliant opportunities of <span style="color: #0000FF;">leadership </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>brought<br/>
just now by changing policies and methods.<br/>
<br/>
THE PROHIBITION WAVE OVER THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IF </span>the advancing wave of prohibition keeps<br/>
its present rate for a few years, most of<br/>
the Southern States will be "dry." By outright prohibition, by high license, by local<br/>
option, and by the dispensary system, <span style="color: #0000FF;">go<br/>
</span>counties of the 119 in Kentucky, most of North<br/>
Carolina (all except a few towns), South<br/>
Carolina, Mississippi, most of Texas, nearly<br/>
all of Tennessee (except the larger cities), and<br/>
now Georgia are closed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">liquor-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>.<br/>
This is a wave of prohibition as strong as<br/>
that which swept over northern New<br/>
England and some of the Western States a<br/>
generation ago, and it is due to similar causes.<br/>
First of all, of course, is the evil of the drink<br/>
habit, the habit especially of strong drink. In<br/>
this the South has, perhaps, suffered somewhat worse results in recent years than some<br/>
<br/>
OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
other parts of the Union because of its lack of<br/>
industrial organization. Where industry has<br/>
been compactly organized, drunkenness has<br/>
been greatly lessened. These states have, too,<br/>
a large irresponsible population-that is, a<br/>
population which social punishments do not<br/>
deter-such as a considerable part of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Negroes </span>and the less successful rural whites.<br/>
<br/>
Then what may be called Puritanism in the<br/>
churches, for the lack of a better name, has a<br/>
stronger influence in these states now than in<br/>
any other part of the Union. The preacher is<br/>
still a real power there, and the evangelist type<br/>
of the preacher sways the multitude. This<br/>
influence-the strong emotionalism of religion<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-always </span>makes directly for prohibitive laws.<br/>
Thus the present prohibition wave affords a<br/>
measure both of the industrial and of the<br/>
religious development of the states. They<br/>
have gone beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">old-time </span>Democratic<br/>
doctrine that the state should not undertake<br/>
"sumptuary" legislation, but they have not<br/>
reached either that density of population or of<br/>
industrial organization wherein the drinking<br/>
habits of the least responsible part of the population may be left to police regulation. This<br/>
part of the population, moreover, is a rural<br/>
population that knows few sports and that has<br/>
few mild drinks.<br/>
<br/>
High license and local option and the local<br/>
dispensary system have proved to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">enforceable </span>and, therefore, effective. Our experience<br/>
with prohibition has not been so conclusive.<br/>
By the evidence of the disinterested, it has in<br/>
many parts of M: ine <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>more harm to <span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span>than mere drinking did: it has not stopped<br/>
drinking and has incited to other sins. In<br/>
Kansas it has worked better. The success of<br/>
it depends, of course, wholly upon the public<br/>
sentiment of the community.<br/>
<br/>
The anti-drink movement in the South is a<br/>
forward movement, for it has a directly good<br/>
moral and economic influence wherever the<br/>
laws are enforceable; and they are enforceable,<br/>
especially the local-option prohibitory laws,<br/>
over a very wide area; and it is a part of the<br/>
strong tendency toward organization.<br/>
<br/>
ABOUT RICH MEN AND FOOLS<br/>
<br/>
S matters stand to-day, although we have<br/>
<br/>
a few enormously rich men in theUnited<br/>
<br/>
States and a great many rich enough to live in<br/>
luxury on their incomes, and although gigantic<br/>
combinations of wealth have attained great<br/>
power and have often misused their power <span style="color: #0000FF;">both<br/>
