<br/>
notable results in philosophic or scientific<br/>
fields, or wherever cities have made exceptional progress in their public-school work, they<br/>
have been invited to participate in this exhibit.<br/>
Through the efforts of Lieut.-Governor<br/>
Ellyson, governor of the Exposition's Department of History and Education, and his chief,<br/>
Prof. J. A. C. Chandler, the educational and<br/>
historical exhibit is larger and more diversified<br/>
than any similar exhibit ever gathered in the<br/>
United States. The Department of State has<br/>
on exhibition fac-similes of the Declaration<br/>
of Independence, the Articles of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Confederation</span>, and the Constitution, together with many<br/>
other interesting documents. The Treasury<br/>
Department maintains a small bureau of Engraving and Printing, which illustrates the<br/>
method of plate work used in that department.<br/>
The Post-Office Department has a model<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">post-office </span>in active operation under glass,<br/>
showing how the mails are collected and <span style="color: #0000FF;">distributed </span>and demonstrating the workings of<br/>
the many new inventions connected with the<br/>
mail department. One of the most interesting<br/>
branches of this exhibit is that of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">DeadLetter </span>Office, where is shown the variety of<br/>
articles that pass through the mails misdirected.<br/>
In the Fisheries Department is the most<br/>
complete display of everything pertaining to<br/>
fish and fishing ever seen at any exposition.<br/>
There will be salt-water and fresh-water<br/>
aquaria, living fish from stream, lake, and sea,<br/>
and preserved specimens of every description.<br/>
The United States Government supplies the<br/>
live fish and a complete supply of fishing<br/>
apparatus from a fish-hook to a harpoon.<br/>
<br/>
THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS<br/>
<br/>
The archives of all of the older states have<br/>
also been drawn upon. From the State Library of Virginia have come the portraits of<br/>
all the Governors, whose names were familiar<br/>
to most of the sightseers in their school days<br/>
-Berkeley and Spottswood, of the Knights of<br/>
the Golden Horse Shoe, who penetrated to the<br/>
mountains of Virginia and West Virginia;<br/>
and Patrick Henry. The Virginia Historical<br/>
Society has on exhibition one of the rarest<br/>
collections of colonial relics and papers in<br/>
existence. One of the contributions of the<br/>
Old Dominion is a collection of portraits of the<br/>
Jaquelin, Ambler, and Sherwood families,<br/>
who lived on historic Jamestown Island.<br/>
Many articles from the old, original town are<br/>
exhibited, among which will be the silver used<br/>
<br/>
THE JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION<br/>
<br/>
in the old Jamestown church, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foundations </span>of which, not long since unearthed, there<br/>
is being erected a duplicate of the old structure.<br/>
Old printing and presses from the Henkel<br/>
Shop at Newmarket, made famous in the<br/>
Civil War, have been sent, as well as the patterns of the first Confederate ironclad, the<br/>
Virginia, the rebuilt Merrimac.<br/>
<br/>
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,<br/>
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, and the later-formed<br/>
state of Ohio are elaborately represented in this<br/>
section. Ohio has one of the finest <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeological </span>exhibits in the United States, and this is<br/>
now at the Exposition.<br/>
<br/>
The Colonial Dames, the Daughters of the<br/>
American Revolution, and the United Daughters<br/>
of the Confederacy have assembled collections<br/>
that are representative of the respective periods<br/>
from which their societies take their existence,<br/>
and the exhibit is made up of loans from all<br/>
parts of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that these priceless relics were to be<br/>
kept in fire-proof buildings won for the Exhibition many contributions that would not<br/>
otherwise have been brought here. The original building, which was found not large enough<br/>
for the exhibits, has the appearance of being<br/>
a wing of the Auditorium and Administration<br/>
Building, being connected by a peristyle. In<br/>
addition to this, a new building, also fire-proof,<br/>
has been erected, 90 feet front and 300<br/>
feet deep.<br/>
<br/>
TRANSPORTATION AND HOTELS<br/>
<br/>
The grounds are within easy reach of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News, and Old<br/>
Point Comfort by electric car and by boat.<br/>
A ride of twenty minutes from any of these<br/>
places lands one on the grounds. Radiating<br/>
from Norfolk and the immediate vicinity are<br/>
eight great trunk lines and five short lines of<br/>
steamers, four Chesapeake Bay and four river<br/>
lines, and three river and canal lines.<br/>
<br/>
The exposition being within a short ride of<br/>
Norfolk, Newport News, Hampton, and other<br/>
cities and resorts, the problem of hotel accommodations ought to be an easy one. The<br/>
diagram on the opposite page shows the<br/>
distance to each city. Visitors who prefer<br/>
outdoor life to the bustle of a crowded<br/>
hotel can make arrangements whereby the<br/>
comforts of a seaside resort may be combined with the attractions of the exposition<br/>
