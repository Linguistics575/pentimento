<span>THE DANGER SPOT OF EUROPE<br/>
<br/>
the attitude of the Servian government to the<br/>
Macedonian question is an attitude that calls<br/>
for a period of complete tolerance. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Servians </span>believe that the injustice and barbarity of the Turkish rule must be stopped,<br/>
and that the mixed Greek, Bulgarian, Serb,<br/>
and Moslem population of that unhappy<br/>
country must be given ten years or so of tolerance, and liberty to work out their own salvation. They still look to England to take a<br/>
leading part in the establishment of such a<br/>
regime in Macedonia.<br/>
<br/>
There remains one Balkan State whose<br/>
position in the matter of Macedonia and the<br/>
Powers I have not touched. That is Northern<br/>
Albania, the wildest of all the Balkan states.<br/>
Albania is held by the Turks. I spent some<br/>
time in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Skodra</span>, or Scutari, and studied very<br/>
carefully the conditions that exist. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Skodra<br/>
</span>is not a town of progress, for there the <span style="color: #0000FF;">telephone </span>and the electric light are forbidden;<br/>
machinery of every kind is against the law, and<br/>
neither newspapers nor books are allowed to<br/>
enter the state. Therefore, in these crooked<br/>
streets the traveler is back in mediaeval days.<br/>
<br/>
The lean, ragged, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-fed </span>soldiers of the<br/>
Sultan occupy the city, but the wild tribesmen<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">come </span>down into the place in small detachments,<br/>
a dozen or so together, in complete <span style="color: #0000FF;">defiance<br/>
</span>of the Turk. With men upon whose heads a<br/>
price has been set, known brigands and murderers, indeed, I have chatted md drunk<br/>
coffee in the bazaar-all wild fellows who<br/>
know no law except their own and who<br/>
do not acknowledge the Sultan as their ruler.<br/>
<br/>
A little later, I was the guest of Vatt Marashi,<br/>
the brigand Chieftain of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Skreli</span>, in the wild<br/>
mountains, and he talked freely and confidently<br/>
upon the future of Albania.<br/>
<br/>
"We, with the Kastrati, the Hoti, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Klementi</span>, the Pulati, and the Shiala are masters<br/>
here. We have held the land always, and shall<br/>
hold it still.<br/>
our own, and pay no taxes to anybody. The<br/>
Turks know full well that when we unite with<br/>
our brothers, the Miriditi in the South, then<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Skodra </span>will be at our mercy. If they came<br/>
here, we would pick them off as fast as they<br/>
came. There are 40,000 of us <span style="color: #ff0000;">Skreli </span>alone<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>without the other tribes. If a Turkish army<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>came in here, it would never get out again."<br/>
<br/>
"And is there likely to be a rising against<br/>
the Turks?" I asked.<br/>
<br/>
"Why, of course.<br/>
one day ere long-when we are ready.<br/>
<br/>
The revolt will come<br/>
We<br/>
<br/>
We acknowledge no law except,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">92Sr<br/>
<br/>
</span>can afford to wait. Turkey will soon have its<br/>
hands full with Bulgaria and with Macedonia,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">then-well</span>, we shall help Bulgaria, and in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>week there won't be a Turk in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Skodra</span>."<br/>
<br/>
"You mean there will be a massacre?"<br/>
<br/>
For answer he shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
"And after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">revolution </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N'<br/>
<br/>
</span>"We hope to obtain our independence under<br/>
France or some other <span style="color: #0000FF;">far-off </span>country-England,<br/>
for instance. Austria and Italy, through their<br/>
priests, are carrying on a strenuous propaganda<br/>
among us, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>will not lift a finger for either<br/>
Italy or Austria. More than one of their agents<br/>
has of <span style="color: #ff0000;">late-disappeared </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.l </span>"<br/>
<br/>
Thus, I have canvassed the sentiment of<br/>
the whole Peninsula with regard to the fate of<br/>
Macedonia, the Land of Black Terror. I find<br/>
Bulgaria determined to strike for the lives and<br/>
liberties of its people in that luckless country.<br/>
Roumania and Servia are bound to inactivity<br/>
by their own political exigencies, but both will<br/>
actively support Bulgaria when the die is cast.<br/>
Montenegro is heart and soul with any movement for the expulsion of the Turk. The<br/>
wild Albanian tribes are merely waiting for<br/>
the signal to pour down from their mountain<br/>
fastnesses upon the outlying posts of the<br/>
Turkish Empire. Within a brief space, the<br/>
flames of war will blaze from one end of the<br/>
Balkans to the other.<br/>
<br/>
And Turkey rests, supine and confident. In<br/>
Constantinople, I talked with Noury Bey,<br/>
Secretary-General of the Imperial Ministry of<br/>
Foreign Affairs.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>question of Macedonia," he said, "is,<br/>
I admit, an extremely difficult one. We have<br/>
to govern a population so varied, both in nationality and creed, that there must, of necessity, be constant aggressions and outbreaks.<br/>
It is said that we aid and abet the Greek<br/>
bands in <span style="color: #0000FF;">massacring </span>the Christians. I totally<br/>
deny this. Surely it is to our own interest to<br/>
maintain peace and order in Macedonia!"<br/>
<br/>
"And the protests of Bulgaria?"<br/>
<br/>
His Excellency smiled.<br/>
<br/>
"We hear from time to time threats of war,"<br/>
was his response. "But when we hear them<br/>
we remember that we are 16,000,000 Turks;<br/>
and when we sleep, we sleep quite undisturbed<br/>
by any war rumors from Sofia."<br/>
<br/>
Later, I had other interviews at the Yildiz<br/>
with the Sultan himself, and with members of<br/>
the Government; all asserted that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span>' is<br/>
not in any way afraid of Bulgaria. The lot<br/>
is, Turkey is uncertain of the attitude of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sonic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
