confidence must <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>of all make himself<br/>
worthy of that confidence.<br/>
<br/>
From the citizen, little need at once be<br/>
expected; for in the nature of things a huge<br/>
mass of people must be led. No man who<br/>
understands the American people will doubt<br/>
that they will quickly follow, when they see<br/>
that the men whom they are to follow are honest,<br/>
robust, and strong. Especially is this true<br/>
when one reflects that the goal at which they<br/>
aim is their own profit.<br/>
<br/>
Then, what of the third party, the man with<br/>
the money? Can anyone doubt that he will<br/>
be ready to do his duty just as soon as the other<br/>
two reach an understanding? Is it so soon<br/>
forgotten that the foreign capitalists supplied<br/>
nearly half the money that was needed to build<br/>
our great railways in the first place? No one<br/>
can doubt that Europe will do again, if need be,<br/>
what it has done before. It needs only the<br/>
basis of confidence. There was a recent most<br/>
interesting article on American railways in the<br/>
London <span style="color: #0000FF;">Statist</span>. That paper, which is an<br/>
authority, declares that England is ready and<br/>
eager to supply the money needed by the<br/>
American railroads. English investors wait<br/>
a few more signs that the people-that is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">government-do </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nor </span>intend to destroy the railroads nor to cripple them. They hail with<br/>
delight the moderate Jamestown address by<br/>
President Roosevelt, and the veto of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">twocent </span>fare bill in New York by Governor Hughes.<br/>
They take the former to indicate the Federal<br/>
attitude, and the latter to prove that in the<br/>
State Governments there still exists enough<br/>
strength to over-rule the fanaticism of the professional anti-corporation legislator.<br/>

THE AVERAGE MAN AND PRESENT CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
HIS is a prosperous country. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Its </span>people<br/>
<br/>
are rich, and they are living well.<br/>
<br/>
The average <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-informed </span>man thinks that this<br/>
<br/>
condition of prosperity will continue at least<br/>
<br/>
for another twelve-month. He thinks that<br/>
<br/>
perhaps the presidential year will bring some<br/>
<br/>
falling off of the full current, but he does not<br/>
<br/>
dream that this disturbance will affect his<br/>
personal fortunes.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, here and there, one may <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">incidents<br/>
</span>that afford some food for <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflection</span>. One<br/>
hears, for instance, that the great telephone<br/>
supply company has laid off three thousand<br/>
employees because the telephone companies<br/>
are unable to raise money to pay their<br/>
debts and to carry on new work of con<br/>

struction. A great steel firm in New York<br/>
City goes into bankruptcy because it cannot<br/>
borrow money to carry on its business. Every<br/>
train into New York, St. Louis, and Chicago<br/>
a month or so ago brought home commercial<br/>
travelers who had cut short their trips because<br/>
business was too slow.<br/>
<br/>
These are little things, noted in special<br/>
industries and trades. If the same thing were<br/>
going on in every industry and trade at the same<br/>
moment it would not be necessary to ask any<br/>
question about the prosperity of the country.<br/>
As it is, a question arises, but that is all. In<br/>
last December a few of the railroads began to<br/>
stop their extensions. Later, a few industrial<br/>
companies began slowly to cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span>their<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tt </span>bills payable," and to build up a cash reserve<br/>
to meet anything that might happen to come<br/>
in the spring. Even more slowly, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">individual </span>tradesman, or manufacturer, has begun<br/>
to follow the same policy. It is, therefore,<br/>
a time for the average man who is a consumer,<br/>
whether he be a producer or not, to take heed<br/>
of these things.<br/>
<br/>
For the average man is generally the last<br/>
man to see changing financial conditions<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He<br/>
begins to cut down his working expenses only<br/>
after half the men in his department have been<br/>
dismissed, and when dismissal is hanging over<br/>
his own head. In fact, the merchant who<br/>
begins to cut down his <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>and store expenses<br/>
in January seldom begins to economize at home<br/>
in the same month. His living expense has<br/>
probably advanced, rather than decreased, as<br/>
the uncertainty has increased in business circles.<br/>
While, therefore, the average man need not<br/>
be alarmed, his condition is at least worthy of<br/>
his close attention.<br/>

SAVINGS BANK LIFE INSURANCE<br/>
<br/>
HE issue of insurance policies for amounts<br/>
<br/>
less than a thousand dollars with premiums payable in weekly or monthly instalments is known as "Industrial Insurance" and<br/>
is limited to a few companies. The cost of this<br/>
form of insurance is enormous. Out of every<br/>
dollar that policy-holders pay in, they receive<br/>
back less than a third. The cost of soliciting<br/>
and management is forty to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>cents out of<br/>
every dollar-more than twice the cost of the<br/>
conduct of standard insurance. The reason<br/>
for this great economic waste lies in the system<br/>
itself. It is a bad system, because a high percentage of cost is unavoidable where solicitors<br/>
are paid commissions for collecting nickels <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
