<span>A NEGRO'S UPHILL CLIMB <span style="color: #ff0000;">9199<br/>
<br/>
</span>from my engagement with him. His reply<br/>
showed his feeling about colored boys going<br/>
North to work. He expressed his <span style="color: #0000FF;">gratification<br/>
</span>that Hampton needed my services and said that<br/>
he had been afraid that I might become so<br/>
attached to Northern city life that I would remain there rather than stay in the South and<br/>
work among my own people, as he was anxious<br/>
that I should do.<br/>
<br/>
I had never before taught Indians. I had<br/>
been with them for four years, in the classroom,<br/>
on the parade ground, in the dining-room, on<br/>
the playground, etc., and had some very <span style="color: #0000FF;">intimate </span>friends among the young men; but I was<br/>
now for the first time to learn the Indian's<br/>
point of view and to note how different it was<br/>
from my own. It was surprising to observe<br/>
how hard it was for many of the Indians to<br/>
adapt themselves to the white man's civilization, and many of them actually felt that the<br/>
old ways were better. This was a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">experience </span>for a Negro, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>my people think that<br/>
the white man's way is the only proper way,<br/>
and we had tried to adapt ourselves to the<br/>
white man's methods. I learned for the first<br/>
time to really sympathize with another race and<br/>
one, too, that was more nearly on the plane of<br/>
my own and whose difficulties seemed to be<br/>
much greater.<br/>
<br/>
My duties included the clerical work in the<br/>
Commandant's office, the supervision of the<br/>
drills, and the instruction of the battalion in<br/>
tactics. Mr. Freeland was a man of remarkable ability and very methodical, and this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">year</span>'s experience was invaluable. My work<br/>
as Commandant of the school cadets for the<br/>
last sixteen years has been largely influenced<br/>
by my association with Mr. Freeland.<br/>
<br/>
I went North with General Armstrong in<br/>
November as a member of the Quartet and also<br/>
as one of the speakers, helping to <span style="color: #0000FF;">raise </span>the<br/>
money necessary for Hampton's work. I had<br/>
gone the previous spring on a short trip to<br/>
Baltimore, Washington, and New York, but<br/>
this time we made <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pretty thorough tour of<br/>
New England, going to Boston and many<br/>
other places that I had always wanted to see.<br/>
I used to argue with Mr. Frissell, who conducted our news-items recitation during the<br/>
middle and senior years, over the relative importance of Virginia and New York. While<br/>
the text-books spoke of the greatness of New<br/>
York, I believed Virginia was almost as great<br/>
and that Richmond and Norfolk, while not so<br/>
large, were quite as important as New York<br/>
<br/>
City. During this trip we were returning on a<br/>
Sunday morning from Brooklyn. Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rissell<br/>
</span>pointed out Brooklyn Bridge, the elevated <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway </span>and a number of the tall <span style="color: #0000FF;">office-buildings </span>in<br/>
New York and asked me if we had anything<br/>
like these in Virginia. Riding out one evening<br/>
to a meeting in Orange, N. J., I told Mr.<br/>
Frissell how interested I was in Central Park<br/>
and the Metropolitan Museum, especially the<br/>
Egyptain mummies and the Obelisk. He<br/>
asked me how these things compared with<br/>
those of Richmond and Norfolk! I finally<br/>
admitted that Virginia was not quite so great<br/>
as New York.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting incidents of this<br/>
trip was a dinner given in Troy, N. Y., by a<br/>
number of gentlemen who were members of the<br/>
first company that General Armstrong recruited<br/>
and took to the war. Their enthusiasm for<br/>
General Armstrong, who had been their captain, impressed me very much. While at<br/>
Stamford, Conn., we went to the beautiful home<br/>
of Dr. John Lord, where the Quartet was to<br/>
sing at an informal reception given to<br/>
General Armstrong. I remember being introduced to Dr. Lord and how frightened I<br/>
was when some one whispered that he was the<br/>
Dr. John Lord who had written "The Old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ro-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">man </span>World" and "Beacon Lights of History,"<br/>
and how honored I felt at being in the home of<br/>
a man who had written books. He seemed so<br/>
simple and so much like General Armstrong<br/>
and Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rissell </span>that I was almost disappointed<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>I had expected that a man so distinguished<br/>
would not think of shaking hands with me,<br/>
but he talked more with us than with any of his<br/>
guests and seemed very much interested in<br/>
what we had to say.<br/>
<br/>
While riding with General Armstrong between Boston and Albany, he asked me if I<br/>
thought I could manage the discipline of the<br/>
school and if I could organize a battalion and<br/>
an <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer</span>'s court. He advised me to become<br/>
familiar with all phases of the work of the<br/>
Department of Discipline, and of the school<br/>
generally. I was much disturbed, feeling that<br/>
perhaps I had not been doing my duty. On<br/>
my return to Hampton, I consulted with Mr.<br/>
Frissell, and asked if he could give me any<br/>
idea as to what General Armstrong's advice<br/>
meant. He told me that Mr. Freeland had<br/>
resigned, that General Armstrong wished to<br/>
put a colored man at the head of the discipline,<br/>
and that they felt that I could do the work.<br/>
This was like a thunderbolt, for my idea was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
