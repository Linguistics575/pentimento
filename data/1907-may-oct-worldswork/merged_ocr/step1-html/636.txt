</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1900</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">JR.<br/>
<br/>
</span>at the head of the Philippine Commission<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>whose task it was to inaugurate civil<br/>
government among <span style="color: #0000FF;">6,500,000 </span>Asiatic Christians, 1,500,000 Mohammedan Moros, and a<br/>
million other fractious pagans, including the<br/>
untamed hill tribes. They had been fighting the<br/>
Spanish down through the centuries, and lately<br/>
had commenced with us where they had left off<br/>
with Spain. And it was our task to substitute<br/>
a civil government (and partly autonomous at<br/>
that) for the martial government then stalking<br/>
them to their lairs in jungles and mountains.<br/>
<br/>
About this time President McKinley and<br/>
Judge Day, Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s former associate on the<br/>
Circuit Bench, happened to be traveling together on the same train. The President<br/>
made known his desperate need of a colonial<br/>
executive; he wanted a man who was "strong,<br/>
honest, and tactful." Judge Day turned with<br/>
the remark:<br/>
<br/>
"You have described Judge Taft."<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Elihu Root, then Secretary of War, was<br/>
of the same opinion, and Judge Taft was invited to come to Washington.<br/>
<br/>
"Why," in effect exclaimed the astonished<br/>
Judge on hearing the offer, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>am not the man<br/>
you want. To begin with, I have never approved of keeping the Philippines."<br/>
<br/>
The President said that such had not been<br/>
his desire either, but<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that the obligation had<br/>
been forced upon us and we could not shift the<br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Judge Taft accepted the appointment <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the Commission with reluctance, for it meant<br/>
that he must give up the work of his life, of<br/>
which he had grown so fond. But he is afflicted,<br/>
often to his own disadvantage, with what<br/>
President Roosevelt describes in him as "a<br/>
willingness to bear responsibility." Some of<br/>
his friends may have perceived in this the<br/>
stepping- -stone to a higher national <span style="color: #0000FF;">prominence</span>,<br/>
but he himself viewed the appointment in a<br/>
different light,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1900</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">President </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">McKinley </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wanted </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">man<br/>
<br/>
</span>"I want to do those people good," he said<br/>
earnestly.<br/>
<br/>
In two years, he calculated, his work on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Commission </span>would be ended; he could then<br/>
return to simple citizenship and earn for his<br/>
family the competence he had so long neglected.<br/>
<br/>
He and his fellow Commissioners landed<br/>
at Manila in the sweltering June of 1900. They<br/>
had come to win the confidence of natives who<br/>
had learned not to trust their rulers. Messages<br/>
of good-will weighted the baggage of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Conv</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>missioners, but the Filipinos had little faith in<br/>
them. The Filipinos were fighting just then,<br/>
it should be remembered. There were daily<br/>
skirmishes in the brush, and<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>we had a large<br/>
army scattered over the islands. The authority that welcomed the Commission was a Military Governor, Major-General MacArthur.<br/>
And yet, hardly had Commissioner Taft's foot<br/>
pressed the Oriental soil, with the little brown<br/>
men crowding around, when he called them in<br/>
to help him solve their problems.<br/>
<br/>
"We invite suggestions from the Filipinos<br/>
and all others who have sympathy with our<br/>
purpose," he said. "We are here to do justice<br/>
to the Philippine people and to secure to them<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">best </span>government in our power, and such a<br/>
measure of popular control as will be consistent<br/>
with the stability and security of law, order,<br/>
and property."<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the messages of <span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>will.<br/>
But the Filipinos stretched the phrase "a<br/>
measure of popular control" beyond all<br/>
reason. A peace banquet was arranged by<br/>
them, not only in honor of the Commission's<br/>
arrival but also on account of an amnesty proclamation just issued by General MacArthur.<br/>
At this oratorical fiesta one Pedro Paterno was<br/>
to speak. Pedro had already had inscribed<br/>
upon the triumphal arches mottoes which<br/>
more than hinted at promises of early independence and it was his plan to compromise<br/>
the Commission. Mr. Taft saw the trap and<br/>
sent word to Pedro that the Commission could<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
