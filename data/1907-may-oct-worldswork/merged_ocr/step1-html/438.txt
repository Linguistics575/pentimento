'bus. The motor'buses also earn more$ 22.50 to $ 30 apiece, against $ 12.50 to $ 13.75<br/>
each for the horse-drawn'buses.<br/>
<br/>
The example of one company will show the<br/>
financial success of the system and its service<br/>
to the public. The gross receipts of the London Motor Omnibus Company, Ltd., the<br/>
largest of the companies, for the eighteen<br/>
months ending June 30, 1906, were $ 624,690.<br/>
This company alone carried considerably<br/>
more than a million passengers a month for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-one </span>months, without a single loss of<br/>
life. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>annual meeting of the company, held on October 22, 1906, a dividend<br/>
of IO per cent. was declared on the ordinary<br/>
shares, after placing $ 30,000 to reserve, allowing 20 per cent. for depreciation, and putting<br/>
$ 2,000 back into the business.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of such facts as these, the business<br/>
is growing rapidly. Three hundred new'buses<br/>
have been added to the service in the six months<br/>
beginning with October, 1906, and about 900<br/>
more are being built on orders from the transit<br/>
companies. Of the $ 5,000,000 invested in the<br/>
business, some $ 3,000,000 is represented by<br/>
the vehicles, at an average cost of $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>apiece.<br/>
And the companies already employ 4,000 men<br/>
in their various enterprises.<br/>
<br/>
Another means toward a solution of the<br/>
transit problem is the taximeter cab service<br/>
of Paris. About three years ago, an automobile cab fitted with a taximeter was put on the<br/>
streets of Paris, and the fare was regulated so<br/>
that it about equaled the fare of a horse cab.<br/>
A few months later, one of the big companies<br/>
ordered 250 small motor cabs of a special<br/>
type, all fitted with the taximeter. The<br/>
minimum fare was <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>cents and about<br/>
twenty cents for each additional mile. These<br/>
cabs are silent, swift, and elegant in appearance;<br/>
they seat two or four persons, and may be made<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>or closed at will. They were an instant<br/>
success. By the end of 1906, more than 1,000<br/>
were in use, and the outstanding orders will<br/>
bring this total to 2,000 by the end of this year.<br/>
The cabs are from 8 to 14 horse-power, and<br/>
cost about $ 1,500 apiece.<br/>
<br/>
The taximeter system has largely made such<br/>
rapid progress possible. The taximeter is a<br/>
simple but ingenious instrument which automatically measures the distance traveled and<br/>
indicates on a clock-like dial the amount of<br/>
fare to be paid. On entering the cab a small<br/>
metal flag above the taximeter is lowered and<br/>
immediately the figures "<span style="color: #0000FF;">75</span>" appear on the<br/>
<br/>
A NEW RELIEF TO CITY TRAFFIC<br/>
<br/>
dial, meaning 75 <span style="color: #0000FF;">centimes-equal </span>to 15 cents,<br/>
the minimum fare. At the end of 1,300 yards,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>change to 85 centimes, or 17 cents,<br/>
and continue changing at regular intervals<br/>
until the passenger leaves the cab and the flag<br/>
is again raised. To-day, this system is used<br/>
exclusively and gives entire satisfaction. The<br/>
success of this system has led to the manufacture<br/>
of these cabs by one company in lots of 2,500.<br/>
At least two distinct companies are now preparing to introduce French and American<br/>
taximeter cabs in New York City.<br/>
<br/>
But New York has not yet obtained this<br/>
system, nor such cheap fares as the Parisians<br/>
pay. The nearest approach to this <span style="color: #0000FF;">system-which </span>may have in it the beginnings of the<br/>
cheap and convenient transit of London and<br/>
Paris-is the service of one large company<br/>
in New York, which operates 650 electric<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">vehiclesihansoms</span>, broughams, landaulets, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">victorias..<br/>
<br/>
</span>This motor cab service of New York is<br/>
exclusive. When one wishes to hire a cab or<br/>
brougham, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">Must </span>send his order to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">central </span>storage station. Fare for the service is<br/>
charged by the driver according to a published<br/>
tariff. Roughly, the rates for hansoms and<br/>
two-passenger broughams range from <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>to<br/>
75 cents a mile and from $ 2 to $ 2.75 per<br/>
hour.<br/>
<br/>
Four stations are maintained by this <span style="color: #0000FF;">company</span>. They accommodate more than 700<br/>
vehicles. A destructive <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>early this year<br/>
burned out the central portion of the main<br/>
station. This had the largest portable storage<br/>
battery room in the world; <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>batteries could<br/>
be charged at one time. There were half a<br/>
dozen hydraulic lifts that removed the batteries<br/>
from the vehicles and replaced them with<br/>
freshly charged batteries without either having<br/>
been touched by hand. Trains of small trucks<br/>
operated electrically, conveyed the batteries<br/>
from beneath the vehicles into the great battery room, where they were picked up by<br/>
enormous electric traveling cranes and moved<br/>
to any desired stands in the room. Plans are<br/>
being drawn for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconstruction </span>of this entire<br/>
station on an improved <span style="color: #0000FF;">fireproof </span>system. It is<br/>
probable, also, that about 200 of the electric<br/>
vehicles which were burned will be replaced<br/>
by gasoline cabs, all <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>with taximeters, like<br/>
the cabs of Paris.<br/>
<br/>
There is no motor omnibus service at present<br/>
in New York, except an experimental French<br/>
'bus in operation on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fifth </span>Avenue from<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
