<span>WHAT FRANCE<br/>
<br/>
We associate frivolity with the French people;<br/>
rather ought we to think of them as incredibly<br/>
industrious and as taxing their wits to enlarge<br/>
their industrial efficiency. When the workers<br/>
of America catch their zest and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellthought-out </span>schemes for application, we shall<br/>
distance our own best record.<br/>
<br/>
THE FRENCH SAVE THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">SOUS<br/>
<br/>
</span>And as the Gallic mind abhors futility in<br/>
industry, so it abhors futility in the disposal of<br/>
the wages of industry. A Frenchman once<br/>
said to me, "You Americans don't know how<br/>
to spend money; you waste it." After a<br/>
long sojourn among us, he had concluded that<br/>
in our handling of money we displayed precisely the traits we attribute to the French-heedlessness, impulsiveness, and an extreme<br/>
volatility. And when you know France as<br/>
well as he knew America, you will be inclined<br/>
to agree with him. Back of <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>thrift lies<br/>
a series of virtues all too rare in America--consistency, constancy, self-restraint, <span style="color: #0000FF;">serious-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ness</span>, and especially the readiness to conceive<br/>
of a man's life as a whole, to plan out that<br/>
whole, and to live up to that plan with heroic<br/>
determination.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Paris</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nsaid </span>George Warrington Steevens,<br/>
"is a place where they save sous." It is more<br/>
than that. What the tourist usually sees tells<br/>
only a tithe of the story. He sees parades<br/>
of "mutualistes" (societies for saving); he sees<br/>
shop-keepers wrapping parcels in old newspapers; he sees children wearing black pinafores to protect their clothes; he sees countless<br/>
establishments for mending and dyeing; he<br/>
sees the middle-class Parisienne lift her precious<br/>
skirt, ere she takes a seat upon a bench at<br/>
the wayside, and sit upon her less precious<br/>
Petticoat; he sees people eating forgotten portions of beeves and sheep. Then he says<br/>
wisely, "Ah, yes! Steevens was right. Paris<br/>
is a place where they save sous." Once, being<br/>
in a great hurry, I boarded a street-car within<br/>
four blocks of the end of the line. That is,<br/>
I partly boarded it. The conductor, beside<br/>
himself with compassion, put me off and<br/>
shouted back to me, "Good heavens, <span style="color: #0000FF;">monsieur</span>,<br/>
this car is going only four blocks<span style="color: #ff0000;">!</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Not for<br/>
half a kingdom would he have allowed a fellow<br/>
mortal to pay a fare for so short a ride! As<br/>
this happened when I was new to Gallic ways,<br/>
I thought it expressed the very essence of<br/>
French frugality.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't though. The essence of the phenome<br/>

non is not in the daily savings; it is in the<br/>
application of sagacity to the problem of one's<br/>
economic lifetime. Taking a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bird's-eye </span>view<br/>
of his entire earning and spending career, your<br/>
typical Frenchman sets before himself two<br/>
perfectly definite objects-the one to provide<br/>
for the marriage dowries of his children, the<br/>
other to provide for his own retirement from<br/>
business. Accordingly, he apportions his income so as to "equalize his budget" and save<br/>
a predetermined yearly sum. If his income<br/>
is small, he will always ride on top of an omnibus for three cents instead of inside it for six,<br/>
always sit on a green bench in the park for<br/>
nothing instead of in a rented chair for a penny,<br/>
always travel second-class or third, always<br/>
buy an inexpensive seat at the play.<br/>
<br/>
Possessing this scrupulously calculated code<br/>
of economies, carried out to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">minutest<br/>
</span>detail till it becomes a sort of second nature,<br/>
your Frenchman prepares his soul for gaiety.<br/>
His lightheartedness is largely <span style="color: #0000FF;">temperamental</span>,<br/>
of course, but it is at the same time due in no<br/>
small measure to his sense of security in money<br/>
matters, his consciousness that he is getting on<br/>
in the world, however ploddingly, and his<br/>
freedom from that self-reproof which so<br/>
grievously embitters the existence of the rasher<br/>
and less reasonable American.<br/>
<br/>
As for the objects of French thrift-the<br/>
marriage dowry and the retirement from business-what more sensible? When the parents<br/>
arrange the marriages of their children, there<br/>
is small room for romance, to be sure, but<br/>
also small risk of divorce. The quarrels that<br/>
disrupt the family here in America spring<br/>
largely from difficulties regarding money. In<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rance</span>, the wedded pair are capitalized at the<br/>
outset. They begin their married life on even<br/>
terms, as partners. Indeed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Madame </span>has<br/>
sometimes as shrewd an insight into commercial<br/>
affairs as Monsieur, perhaps more so. While<br/>
the young man was serving his two years with<br/>
the colors, the young woman, very likely, was<br/>
getting two years' business training-for somebody must take the soldier's place; and more<br/>
girls, possibly, are at work in France than here.<br/>
So the husband comes early to rely upon his<br/>
wife's judgment. He naturally assumes that<br/>
you cherish an equal reverence for that of your<br/>
own wife. Drop into "Style House" (how<br/>
these <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frenchmen </span>adore English names!) to<br/>
purchase a Derby hat, and you find that it is<br/>
the French wife, not the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>husband, who<br/>
fixes the price-after long and impassioned<br/>
<br/>
