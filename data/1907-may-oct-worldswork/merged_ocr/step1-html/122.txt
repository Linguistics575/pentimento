Virtue, honor, loyalty still accomplished deeds<br/>
of incredible difficulty, deeds which will stand<br/>
to all time as the achievements of purest heroism; but they were the outcome of pride of<br/>
virtue, pride of honor, pride of loyalty.<br/>
<br/>
THE RISE OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>MIDDLE CLASS<br/>
<br/>
In considering Japanese character to-day,<br/>
it is necessary to realize that this pride of<br/>
race is still one of the strongest materials of<br/>
its fibre. In past times it was the inheritance<br/>
of the ruler, the noble, and the soldier; these<br/>
regarded the classes engaged in trade and labor<br/>
(agriculture excepted) as mere useful cattle.<br/>
Now, by the emancipation of the lower classes<br/>
and their newly acquired rights under a representative government, as well as by the<br/>
renown achieved in the late war, it has become<br/>
with certain modifications the distinguishing<br/>
quality of the masses in Japan. In the rush<br/>
to the towns for education and employment,<br/>
and in the influence spreading out from the<br/>
towns to carry modern activities further every<br/>
day, a great new element has been created in<br/>
Japan, the element of a middle class, with<br/>
all the good and bad qualities which the term<br/>
implies.<br/>
<br/>
What effect is this new element likely to<br/>
have on the national character? A glance at<br/>
the history of the middle class in England may<br/>
help us to answer that question. Its rise to<br/>
prominence has been a quick growth, comprising actually some fifty or sixty years. Before<br/>
that there was a commercial class, <span style="color: #0000FF;">indeed-the </span>British merchant and the British banker<br/>
were powers in the land. Each was proud<br/>
of his calling, staunch in his politics, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">educated</span>, well-read, high-thinking man. He<br/>
was jealous of his privileges, reluctant to trespass on those of his social superiors, and<br/>
abhorred the idea of lowering himself by intercourse with <span style="color: #0000FF;">interiors</span>. The gulf between the<br/>
peer and the merchant was no deeper than that<br/>
which lay between the merchant and the<br/>
tradesman. The aristocrat governed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>, in Parliament and out of it; his younger<br/>
sons went forth to fight its battles and annex<br/>
new continents; the British Empire is the<br/>
work of the well-born cadets for whom there<br/>
was no room at home. It was their business<br/>
to open the ports of the world to British commerce; but, that done, their task was ended<br/>
and the steady-going British merchant did the<br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
All these conditions are changed, and the<br/>
<br/>
OUR RELATIONS WITH JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
change is in great part due to American<br/>
influence. The wedding-garment of wealth<br/>
admits any churl to society's banquet, and<br/>
there is no master of the feast to bid him take<br/>
a modest place. There is no longer an upper<br/>
class in the true sense of the word; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tradesman </span>of yesterday can hobnob with royalty<br/>
to-day, and his errand-boy may look forward<br/>
to the same honor to-morrow. All is muddy<br/>
with mediocrity. In its initial state, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">middle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">class </span>element is commendably spongy, absorbing greedily all that touches it, whether<br/>
from above or below. When it has reached<br/>
the limit of its absorbing capacity, it hardens<br/>
and becomes <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>concrete mass.<br/>
<br/>
America stands sponsor, more or less <span style="color: #0000FF;">directly</span>, for the new middle class in Japan. It<br/>
consists of millions of men who have too suddenly discovered that all human beings are<br/>
equal; that obscure birth and lack of fortune<br/>
are no real <span style="color: #0000FF;">disqualifications </span>in the race of life;<br/>
that education is to be had for the asking and<br/>
opens the way to all that men desire, whether<br/>
ambition or love of gain be their guiding star.<br/>
Like the middle class in other countries, they<br/>
are quick forgetters of past benefits and inordinate believers in their own powers; and,<br/>
in common with their prototypes beyond the<br/>
seas, their aims are rather personal than<br/>
national, their sensibilities blunt, and their<br/>
methods coarse.<br/>
<br/>
HOME EDUCATION FOR THE JAPANESE<br/>
<br/>
The young Japanese of low birth wants one<br/>
thing only-the teaching which shall help him<br/>
to make money. The ancient pride of race,<br/>
just communicated to him by its old safekeepers, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aristocrat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>quickly <span style="color: #0000FF;">degenerate<br/>
</span>into conceit and is apt to <span style="color: #ff0000;">fill </span>him with inflated<br/>
ideas of his own powers. When he contemplates the apparent prosperity of other countries and realizes the tremendous force of<br/>
money, and thinks he sees it so easily made<br/>
in America, he resents the meagreness of his<br/>
own chances. He tells himself that he has<br/>
quite as much "smartness" as any foreigner,<br/>
and that he lacks nothing for success on the<br/>
same lines except fluent English and a little<br/>
practice in business methods. He is the man<br/>
whom conceit is blinding to-day.<br/>
<br/>
This new eagerness for gain is the result of<br/>
the in-rush of American influence combined<br/>
with the inevitable swing of the pendulum<br/>
which balances all human history. In a class<br/>
which in the future must count for much in the<br/>
