<br/>
THE PERSONNEL AND METHODS OF THE UPPER HOUSE,<br/>
WHICH THE COMMONS WOULD PRACTICALLY ABOLISH<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>1893 saw in England a conflict<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>between one of the most venerable<br/>
<br/>
statesmen and one of the most venerable institutions in existence anywhere in the<br/>
world at that time. Mr. Gladstone passed a<br/>
bill for Irish Home Rule through a House of<br/>
Commons just elected to support him, and that<br/>
bill was rejected by the House of Lords. Two<br/>
years later, an enormous majority of British<br/>
voters endorsed this action of the Lords in<br/>
thwarting their own representatives. The<br/>
people had declared the hereditary chamber<br/>
to be right and the popular chamber to be<br/>
wrong, and after an eclipse of sixty years the<br/>
House of Lords had become a decisive power<br/>
in the state. In 1906 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1907 </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflict </span>of<br/>
the two houses was renewed. For Englishmen,<br/>
the matter is of great practical importance; for<br/>
constitutional theorists, it is intensely interesting<br/>
and suggestive; on the part of those anywhere<br/>
who are living under representative institutions,<br/>
it may perhaps arouse some curiosity as to the<br/>
nature, composition, faults, and merits of the<br/>
oldest legislative chamber in the world.<br/>
<br/>
The British legislature possesses from day<br/>
to day an unlimited authority over the<br/>
whole of the public and private law of the<br/>
Empire. It can do anything. To limit its<br/>
legal powers there would be need of an interposition of Providence. No written constitution, no referendum, no ancient custom hampers<br/>
its full power to turn its lightest or wildest<br/>
fancy into the law of the land in a single day.<br/>
Of this legislature, together with the King and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commons</span>, the House of Lords forms a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">co6rdinate </span>part, whose consent is necessary<br/>
to the passing of any act. Sitting at Westminster on red benches <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>a gilded chamber,<br/>
down a not very long corridor from the House<br/>
of Commons, it is presided over by the Lord<br/>
Chancellor of Great Britain, an official who<br/>
is at once a judge and a Minister and <span style="color: #0000FF;">who-after </span>the Archbishop of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canterbury-ranks<br/>
<br/>
</span>highest among British subjects. Six hundred<br/>
and twenty-two persons have the right to sit<br/>
and vote as members of the House; <span style="color: #0000FF;">549 </span>of these<br/>
are hereditary peers, whose rights pass down<br/>
from father to son subject to the same law that<br/>
regulates the intestate succession to landed<br/>
property. Twenty-eight are <span style="color: #0000FF;">peers </span>elected by<br/>
the peerage of Ireland; sixteen are elected by<br/>
the peerage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scotland</span>; neither of these bodies<br/>
come to the House of Lords in their full <span style="color: #0000FF;">complement </span>like the peerage of England. Twenty-six<br/>
are Bishops of the Church of England, and<br/>
three are Princes of the Blood Royal. But of<br/>
this multitude, there are not many to be seen<br/>
by him who goes to the gallery and gazes on<br/>
the House of Lords at work. Considerably<br/>
more than a hundred peers have never been in<br/>
the House in their lives. Large numbers<br/>
attend but rarely, A great occasion will bring<br/>
together good numbers, and more than 400<br/>
came to vote against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>Rule Bill in<br/>
1893. It would not, however, be fair to put<br/>
the attendance on days of ordinary importance<br/>
at more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>or sixty; and the homely<br/>
informality of this little band would much<br/>
surprise people used to other assemblies.<br/>
<br/>
THE HOUSE OF LORDS AT WORK<br/>
<br/>
From a seat in the gallery the visitor sees the<br/>
thrones of the King and Queen at <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>far end<br/>
of the chamber, well protected from dust and<br/>
light by dark-red coverings. On the steps of<br/>
the throne will be sitting a youth or two, perhaps<br/>
a boy in an Eton coat, whose right to loll about<br/>
on that distinguished ground is a privilege<br/>
granted to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eldest </span>sons of peers in order to<br/>
familiarize them with the work of the chamber<br/>
where they may one day sit. Sitting or <span style="color: #0000FF;">standing </span>in the same place will be also a Minister<br/>
or an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ex-Minister </span>of the Crown, who has<br/>
strolled along the corridor from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commons'<br/>
</span>House to hear the debate or watch the fate of<br/>
some bill that concerns his department. In<br/>
