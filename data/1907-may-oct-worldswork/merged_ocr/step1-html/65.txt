</span>a dry season for some years; certainly two or<br/>
three million from these regions alone."<br/>
<br/>
"But you only pay from four to ten cents<br/>
for these."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, no, we don't<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>We pay from twentyfive cents to forty cents a skin for especially<br/>
good ones. That means between $ 500,000<br/>
and $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">800,000 </span>a year for muskrat alone in those<br/>
two sections. It was only in the early times<br/>
and in especially good years that seal or seaotter yielded more a year than that. Then,<br/>
take skunk skin: The demand for skunk skin<br/>
is so much greater than the supply that men in<br/>
the West are running skunk farms; and for<br/>
the skins they receive the same price as used to<br/>
be paid for beaver-all the way to $ 2 and $ 3,<br/>
according to grade.<br/>
<br/>
"The same with fox skins. The demand is<br/>
greater every day. We pay all the way from<br/>
$ 250 to $ 750 for a pure silver fox, though<br/>
if a millionaire fancier should offer us $ 10,000<br/>
for a prize silver fox, we of course would not<br/>
refuse him. The average for silver fox runs<br/>
about $ 200 or $ 300; for red fox, $ 5 down the<br/>
grade; for gray fox, from $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>down; for cross<br/>
fox, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">3315 </span>down. These are higher prices<br/>
than were paid for beaver in its <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmiest </span>days."<br/>
<br/>
"Will this growing demand for furs lead to<br/>
the extermination of fur-bearing animals?"<br/>
<br/>
"Never! In the first place, fashion is as<br/>
capricious as the wind. Trade <span style="color: #0000FF;">does</span>n't create<br/>
fashion. It is fashion that creates trade<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>What is fashion? There you have me!<br/>
Fashion in the fur trade is simply this: one<br/>
woman or man takes a fancy to try some new<br/>
wrinkle and has it made to order, say a chinchilla stole, or a sable-trimmed cape, or a mink<br/>
coat. Some one else sees it and orders one<br/>
like it. That special fur then becomes the<br/>
fashion and prices go up. Word goes out to<br/>
the trappers. They pursue that fur most<br/>
because it pays the best. While that fashion<br/>
is in, other furs get a rest and the animals<br/>
multiply. For instance, a few years back<br/>
mink was not wanted; so mink became plentiful. Now mink is the fashion; and there are<br/>
mink enough to supply the demand till fancy<br/>
takes up something else.<br/>
<br/>
"But there is another way in which the trade<br/>
protects the fur-bearing animals. Poison spoils<br/>
the pelt, fevers the animals, and takes the<br/>
glossy life from the fur. We don't give paying<br/>
prices for the skin of a poisoned animal. That<br/>
discourages poisoning. Again, animals killed<br/>
out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">season-m </span>summer or when mothers are<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8863<br/>
<br/>
</span>bearing their <span style="color: #0000FF;">young-done </span>yield fur that pays<br/>
the trapper for his trouble. Consequently,<br/>
trapping for money is confined to the midwinter months for the heavily furred animals.<br/>
That gives the animals eight months out of<br/>
twelve as chances against the hunter. The<br/>
fact that we don't pay for skins taken out of<br/>
season is the best protection for game."<br/>
<br/>
THE WORLD-MARKETS OF THE FUR TRADE<br/>
<br/>
Without attempting to enumerate all the great<br/>
fur companies now doing an enormous business in America, it may be stated that the raw<br/>
furs converge to some half dozen places: in<br/>
Canada to Montreal, Winnipeg, and Edmonton;<br/>
in the United States to St. Paul, St. Louis, San<br/>
Francisco, Chicago, and New York. Not one<br/>
of these places is in the true sense a fur market<br/>
for the world. It is more a receiving depot or<br/>
a clearing house, where that required for domestic supply is sorted out to be manufactured,<br/>
while the great bulk is sent forward to the three<br/>
famous fur markets of the world, London,<br/>
Leipsic, Nijni <span style="color: #ff0000;">Novgorod-An </span>other words, to<br/>
England, Germany, Russia. To these three<br/>
great marts come all the best furs of the whole<br/>
world-even the seals of the North America<br/>
Commercial Company, which come back to<br/>
America in coats, the sea otter of the Aleutians,<br/>
the beaver and marten and mink of Hudson<br/>
Bay, the ermine and sable of Russia, the lamb<br/>
skins of Persia, the nutria and chinchilla of<br/>
South America. Here congregate all the buyers<br/>
of the fur world and the sellers, though the<br/>
actual purchasing is done by expert fur brokers.<br/>
<br/>
In London, the furs are sold by auction at<br/>
such well-known sales as Lampson's, Nesbitt's,<br/>
and the Hudson's Bay Company. Annually,<br/>
an average of nearly $ 5,000,000 worth of raw<br/>
furs is sold in London. After thorough examination of the pelts as classified, the buyers<br/>
assemble before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">auctioneer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes<br/>
</span>in a huge glass-lighted room at the top of the<br/>
warehouses, or away from the furs altogether<br/>
in some regular sales room. The bidding is<br/>
the very opposite of the wild scramble in the<br/>
New York Stock Exchange, where a thousand<br/>
yells assail buyer and seller. At the fur sales,<br/>
a silent nod of the head knocks down a bid.<br/>
<br/>
Formerly, these sales were more picturesque.<br/>
They were held at some well-known coffeehouse, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">classified </span>pelts stacked up at<br/>
one side. Buyers were regaled with sumptuous<br/>
dinners by the sellers. Then, a lighted candle<br/>
with pins stuck in at intervals was put up.<br/>
