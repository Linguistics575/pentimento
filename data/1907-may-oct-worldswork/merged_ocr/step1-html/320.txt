bargaining-while it is to your wife, rather<br/>
than to yourself, that the proposition is mainly<br/>
addressed. This deference to the woman's<br/>
understanding makes for contentment in the<br/>
home; it conserves her self-respect; it recognizes her as the equal (if not more) of her<br/>
"lord and master"; and thus it fosters a tenderness and a fidelity as genuine-yes, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>as romantic-as in marriages founded<br/>
upon sentiment. It is almost solely in French<br/>
plays and French novels that the moral integrity of the home is held lightly-and there<br/>
only because the prevailing regularity lacks<br/>
dramatic or literary interest, to a degree,<br/>
whereas breach of regularity supplies it; besides, both drama and fiction are at present<br/>
the victims of a fashion-none too <span style="color: #0000FF;">admirable-which </span>will pass, in time, and be superseded by<br/>
a better and more representative.<br/>
<br/>
One can hardly advocate the French marriage system in its entirety for America. We<br/>
are too sentimental to adopt it outright. But<br/>
we may advocate its respect for the economic<br/>
foundations of the family and its refusal to<br/>
countenance the mating of those who lack the<br/>
wherewithal to support themselves and who<br/>
so blithely trust to luck. We call this "romantic"; <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftenest </span>it kills romance. And one<br/>
must also admire the arrangement that frees<br/>
the wife of that sense of dependence which is<br/>
annoying at best and at worst degrading.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of the Frenchman's deliberate<br/>
resolve to retire from business, I endorse it<br/>
whole-heartedly. Any Frenchman will <span style="color: #0000FF;">forgive </span>Russell Sage's <span style="color: #ff0000;">close-iistedness</span>, but no<br/>
Frenchman can forgive his sticking to his desk<br/>
all his days. No Frenchman can understand<br/>
it, for, to the Gallic mind, work is only a means<br/>
to an end. The great affair of life is not work;<br/>
it is life itself. And if commercial prowess<br/>
in America yields its splendid rewards-such<br/>
rewards as fame, power, and the satisfaction<br/>
of personal vanity-France has found a way<br/>
to distribute glory without asking a man to<br/>
sweat for it till he drops. Whereas the toiling<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">septuagenarian </span>of New York may have his<br/>
palace, his villa, his art-treasures, and his<br/>
ocean-going steam yacht, and rejoice to see<br/>
them pictured in the Sunday papers, the<br/>
septuagenarian of Paris would give them all<br/>
for the little red ribbon of the Legion of Honor,<br/>
which means a larger fame, a more genuine<br/>
power, and a more soothing balm to selfesteem. It is for distinction as a man, rather<br/>
than as a mere winner and ruler of goods and<br/>

chattels, that he yearns. He honors work;<br/>
but he views it as Henry Ward Beecher viewed<br/>
a certain other factor of human life when he<br/>
exclaimed, in a generalization no less sane than<br/>
brilliant, "It is the test of every good institution<br/>
that it digs its own grave."<br/>
<br/>
Now this world is so constituted that whenever a nation applies its mental energies to<br/>
securing certain definite advantages, certain<br/>
minor advantages seem almost to come of<br/>
themselves: and so it is thrift that has given<br/>
France its small, compact newspapers-of<br/>
from four to eight pages, printed in reasonably<br/>
coarse type and containing only the reading<br/>
matter its subscribers want-whereas we Americans, with our immense sixteen-page papers in<br/>
fine print, devote half our attention to deciding<br/>
what to skip. We endure this nuisance<br/>
because we have a mania for extravagant<br/>
advertising. The papers provide countless<br/>
columns of absolutely uninteresting "news"<br/>
in order to provide "pure reading matter"<br/>
next to the advertisements. Half the advertisers would retrench if they dared, but each<br/>
fears to cut down his space lest his rivals crush<br/>
him. Nothing but a general agreement, like<br/>
that proposed for the reduction of armaments<br/>
among the nations, could remedy the evil-an<br/>
evil which the French, by reason of their genius<br/>
for economy, have never allowed to engulf them.<br/>
Thus they supply themselves with newspapers<br/>
that suit the hand, the eye, and the intelligence.<br/>
Whatever the failings of French journalism,<br/>
these <span style="color: #0000FF;">virtues-tether </span>with the dignity that<br/>
enables them to publish articles by the greatest<br/>
French authors of the time and the custom<br/>
that requires reporters to sign their <span style="color: #0000FF;">work-are </span>certainly things to be envied.<br/>
<br/>
And when the postman arrives, he <span style="color: #ff0000;">doesn't<br/>
</span>load you down with circulars, prospectuses,<br/>
announcements, and sham letters. The money<br/>
that is expended-and two-thirds <span style="color: #0000FF;">wasted</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>that sort of advertising in America is<br/>
mainly saved in France, and everything you<br/>
purchase is thereby made less expensive.<br/>
"Send for our free illustrated catalogue" reads<br/>
like a charity, but the proprietor requires his<br/>
customers to pay the printer.<br/>
<br/>
Thus far we have followed Mr. Mason's<br/>
explanation of French prosperity without<br/>
difficulty, but now we come to what is at first<br/>
glance a hard saying. He traces that prosperity not only to sane agriculture and to rare<br/>
industry and frugality, but "above all, to the<br/>
instinct of artistic taste, fostered and <span style="color: #ff0000;">developed<br/>
<br/>
