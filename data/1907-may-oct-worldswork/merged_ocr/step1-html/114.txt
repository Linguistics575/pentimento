<br/>
all the plants and other tangible property of<br/>
the gas and the electric companies cost less<br/>
than one-quarter of the stock and bonds they<br/>
had issued, and that they were paying in<br/>
interest and dividends more than 20 per cent.<br/>
on their real investment. From this he went<br/>
on to examine the cost of producing and distributing gas, with the result that it was<br/>
apparent that dollar gas paid 90 per cent.<br/>
gross profit.<br/>
<br/>
These facts were collected in a logical report.<br/>
The legislature accepted its conclusions and<br/>
passed bills reducing the price of gas to<br/>
eighty cents, and in like manner cutting down<br/>
the price of electric light and power. There<br/>
was also created a state commission whose<br/>
approval was made necessary to any further<br/>
issue of stock and bonds, and standards of<br/>
candle-power and inspection were provided<br/>
that the public might get what they paid for.<br/>
<br/>
THE INSURANCE INVESTIGATION<br/>
<br/>
The next legislature, stirred by the<br/>
Alexander-Hyde quarrel in the Equitable<br/>
Life'Assurance Society, provided for a general<br/>
insurance investigation. That committee naturally selected Mr. Hughes as its chief counsel.<br/>
In his important insurance work, Mr. Hughes<br/>
pursued the same persistent policy as in the<br/>
gas investigation. He refused to be diverted<br/>
from any phase of the subject until he had<br/>
exhausted its possibilities and he wholly declined to depart from the subject of insurance<br/>
to go into other matters, either of politics or of<br/>
ethics. For this reason, when the examination<br/>
of Mr. George W. Perkins and the statements<br/>
of Presidents McCall and McCurdy had revealed<br/>
payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars<br/>
of the policy-holders' money to political committees, Mr. Hughes refused to call either<br/>
Chairman <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cortelyou </span>or Treasurer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bliss-on<br/>
</span>the ground that the legitimate scope of his<br/>
inquiry included only the misuse of the policyholders' money and to what purposes it was<br/>
put, and that what the campaign committee<br/>
did with it was not germane. For the same<br/>
reasons, after it had been brought out that<br/>
the "Big-Three" life insurance companies<br/>
maintained lobby funds and that millions of<br/>
dollars had been expended by their lobby<br/>
agents to influence members of the legislature<br/>
throughout the United States, Mr. Hughes<br/>
did not undertake to convict the recipients<br/>
of bribery and to turn the insurance investigation into a general political house-cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
GOVERNOR HUGHES-NOW AND LATER<br/>
<br/>
He stuck to his one specific object and that<br/>
was to disclose what methods and practices<br/>
of the New York insurance companies were<br/>
wrong, and to devise legislation that would<br/>
prevent, so far as legislation could prevent, a<br/>
continuance or a recurrence of insurance <span style="color: #ff0000;">wrongdoing</span>. By adhering to this policy, he secured<br/>
a unanimous report of the legislative committee,<br/>
two at least of whose members might have been<br/>
involved had the distribution of the lobby<br/>
money been traced to its ultimate recipients;<br/>
and the legislature, many of whose members<br/>
were of notoriously corrupt affiliations, passed<br/>
without weakening amendment all of the bills<br/>
which Mr. Hughes drafted. This was a record<br/>
for accomplishment never surpassed by any<br/>
prior legislative investigation in New York.<br/>
The reason for Mr. Hughes's success was his<br/>
ingrained policy of sticking to the specific<br/>
object in view and deviating therefrom neither<br/>
to make political capital nor to distinguish<br/>
himself as a showy and sensational lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
MR. HUGHES <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>POLITICS<br/>
<br/>
His conduct in these two investigations won<br/>
for Mr. Hughes the confidence of the people<br/>
of his state. At that time New York politics<br/>
was undergoing one of its occasional periods<br/>
of ebullition. Mr. William R. Hearst had,<br/>
the preceding year, been an Independent candidate for mayor of New York City on the platform that both the old political parties were<br/>
corrupt and that their bosses were owned by<br/>
the public-service corporations; and that he,<br/>
if elected, would give the public what they<br/>
wanted-a better street-car service and lower<br/>
fares, fifty-cent gas, model tenement houses<br/>
and lower rents, an eight-hour working day<br/>
and union wages, municipal ownership and<br/>
operation of public franchises, and the overthrow of corporate politics. On election day,<br/>
Mr. Hearst polled a great many votes, so many<br/>
that for more than an hour the returns stopped<br/>
coming in, and after considerable delay the<br/>
official announcement was made that Mr. McClellan was <span style="color: #ff0000;">reelected </span>by less than 4,000<br/>
plurality. Mr. Hearst had no election inspectors and his machinery for checking up the<br/>
vote was incomplete. He at once raised the<br/>
cry of fraud and took legal proceedings to<br/>
recount the votes.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>hundreds of thousands of men who<br/>
voted for him believed that he had been cheated<br/>
and many thousands of men who did not vote<br/>
for him believed that he was entitled to a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
