"You know," said Sullivan afterwards, "all big men are<br/>

do get started they go like <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>and John L. thought he<br/>

<br/>
</span>TAFT AS A COLLEGE BOY<br/>
<br/>
When Mr. Taft was only seventeen, he was<br/>
already tall and powerful; and when, with<br/>
"a choice lot of boys" from Andover, he went<br/>
to Yale, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beardless</span>, 225-pound freshman was<br/>
hailed in prophetic glee. His class, his<br/>
University, had visions of the things he would<br/>
do on the gridiron, this splendid, clear-eyed<br/>
giant. Then came one of those rushes in<br/>
Hamilton Park, when freshmen manifest a<br/>
disposition not to be pushed off the earth.<br/>
In this particular rush, Taft went crashing<br/>
through the sophomores like a catapult. One,<br/>
a man of his own weight, leaped in front of<br/>
him. Then Taft let forth a joyous roar and<br/>
charged! He grappled with the other Ajax,<br/>
lifted him bodily, and heaved him over his head.<br/>
No wonder he promptly got the nickname of<br/>
"Bull" Taft! And the godsend he would be<br/>
for the athletic <span style="color: #0000FF;">field</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>But they did not know him yet. Judge<br/>
Taft, his father, cherished the old-fashioned<br/>
notion that a man ought to work at college, and<br/>
work hard. He had taken honors himself,<br/>
and so had young Taft's half-brother. The<br/>
thing was a family tradition, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">22 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i-pound<br/>
</span>freshman entered college with that one idea<br/>
in mind. He joined no elevens, no crews, no<br/>
track teams. His industry was amazing. The<br/>
courses at Yale then were rigidly prescribed,<br/>
almost nothing being elective before the senior<br/>
year, but Taft went at the distasteful part of<br/>
it as at all things else. He was "Bull" Taft<br/>
again, charging obstacles, and a convincing<br/>
heavyweight at it, too. His exhaustless physique he used to back up his clear intellect,<br/>
and at the hardest study he never tired. His<br/>
was none of the brilliant off-hand coups of<br/>
genius, but huge, safe momentum; from day<br/>
to day, lesson by lesson, he slowly made his<br/>
way close to the head of his class.<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate: A younger collegian went to<br/>
him (everybody fell into the way of going to<br/>
"Old Bill") and asked him about collateral<br/>
reading. The younger man, being very young<br/>
and ambitious, had planned for himself a<br/>
course of outside reading which would lead to<br/>
<br/>
TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
a broader culture. He thought that he wanted<br/>
to read <span style="color: #0000FF;">deeply </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>literature, or in German, you know.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't do it," advised the unrevolutionary<br/>
Taft. Throwing an arm about the shoulder<br/>
of the enthusiastic youngster, he talked to him<br/>
as "a Dutch uncle," more or less in this<br/>
fashion:<br/>
<br/>
"Get over it," he said. "You mustn't try<br/>
to be too independent, just yet. These University professors have laid out a course, and<br/>
it's the result of their long experience, while<br/>
you-well, this is your first trial at educating<br/>
anybody, isn't it? All right, then, perhaps<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">you</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'d </span>just better stick to the course. While<br/>
you're here, bang along at what's prescribed,<br/>
and bang as hard as you can, and stand as<br/>
far away from the foot of the class as your<br/>
efforts and the rest of the class will let you.<br/>
There's no hurry about that collateral reading."<br/>
<br/>
"Old Bill" might have talked in the same<br/>
owlish way about collateral celebrating. As to<br/>
himself, the business of carousing was never<br/>
brought to him to decide on moral grounds.<br/>
He was liberal enough in such matters, but the<br/>
loss of time was the stand on which he decided<br/>
it; or rather, he never came to the point of<br/>
actual decision on any grounds. He simply<br/>
did not want to lose a day at his "pounding"<br/>
for an honor. A night off would incapacitate<br/>
him for the morning after; he would have to<br/>
cut two or three recitations and would be set<br/>
back by that much. He trusted nothing to<br/>
native brilliancy to carry him through. By<br/>
steady, ponderous work he had to drive each<br/>
peg as he came to it. He could not drive two<br/>
at the same time, one with each hand. He<br/>
swung his sledge with both hands, laying on<br/>
his powerful weight, and it was a fast-driven<br/>
spike that sank into the hard, fine-grained<br/>
wood of his intellect. For this reason, he kept<br/>
in good physical shape. His strength was<br/>
uncultivated by training, but it was an enormous<br/>
natural strength. Physically, he was another<br/>
Jean Valjean, and he could have made himself<br/>
a colossal campus hero. But he proved the<br/>
more colossal because he turned his back on<br/>
the glory indicated by his huge frame, and set<br/>
the rare example of a college giant patiently<br/>
plodding along at his books.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he was not one of those insufferable,<br/>
pedantic "grinds" that pose as a reproach to<br/>
all healthy, sane fellows who know the best joy<br/>
of living. Secretary Taft is essentially a<br/>
social character and always has been. He<br/>
