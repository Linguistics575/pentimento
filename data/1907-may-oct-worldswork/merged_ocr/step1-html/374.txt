by year so gradually that we are likely to forget<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">-that </span>the products of the tropics are already<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">becoming </span>more abundant and cheaper for the<br/>
enrichment o' the life of all Northern peoples.<br/>
The curious may <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>much entertainment in<br/>
comparing the total use of tropical products in<br/>
' civilized" countries now and ten, twenty,<br/>

<br/>
THE CONFLICT WITH ASIA<br/>
<br/>
UT of the anarchy from which San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco </span>suffers comes one annoyance to the<br/>
Japanese after another-too little perhaps to<br/>
deserve notice under normal conditions. But<br/>
the Japanese jingoes notice even a reported<br/>
prohibition of Japanese employment agencies<br/>
by the San Francisco'authorities; and one of<br/>
their newspapers, an organ of the Opposition,<br/>
publishes a sort of demand for an international<br/>
inquiry. In the Hawaiian Islands, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meeting<br/>
</span>of Japanese "demands" the admission of<br/>
Japanese laborers to the United States-contrary to the terms of our treaty.<br/>
<br/>
These are <span style="color: #ff0000;">triding </span>incidents. Neither the<br/>
Government at Washington nor the Government at Tokyo pays heed to them; and there<br/>
is no strain on their good relations. But the<br/>
people of Japan, or some of them, are sensitive;<br/>
and their trade organizations have addressed<br/>
a polite letter of protest to President Roosevelt<br/>
and to American Boards of Trade. In a word,<br/>
if San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco </span>and the United States wish to<br/>
continue cordial trade relations these annoying<br/>
incidents, however insignificant, must cease.<br/>
<br/>
Japan has no thought of war, no wish for<br/>
war, no <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>ability to wage war; nor has<br/>
the Government of Japan shown, so far as<br/>
the public knows, any irritation. Yet the<br/>
sensational press of both countries and even<br/>
some of the sensational newspapers of Europe<br/>
keep the subject of a possible breach between<br/>
the United States and Japan under discussion;<br/>
and irresponsible agitators in California and<br/>
Opposition politicians in Japan continue to<br/>
give occasion for news-items and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason lies deeper than mere sensational news-getting. The persistent, if <span style="color: #ff0000;">dormant</span>, race-feeling blindly asserts itself; and<br/>
along with this the white man's fear that the<br/>
yellow man will yet get the mastery of much<br/>
of the world's <span style="color: #0000FF;">trade-the </span>fear that by cheap<br/>
labor and cheap living he will yet utilize the<br/>
modern mechanism of manufacture and commerce to the exclusion of the white races.<br/>
<br/>
THE MARCH <span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span>EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
There is a race conflict and an economic<br/>
conflict between Asia and the rest of the world<br/>
-so, at least, a large section of Western opinion<br/>
fears. This is the large world-fact that must<br/>
be faced at last by statesmen of all continents.<br/>
To grant that such a situation must lead to<br/>
troublesome trade conflicts, to say nothing of<br/>
possible war at some time, would be to discredit in advance the wisdom and the justice of<br/>
governments and the enlightenment of civilized<br/>
peoples. For the closer contact of these races<br/>
ought to develop increasing mutual respect<br/>
and helpfulness. But the sense of a serious<br/>
problem rests on many minds, and already<br/>
there is growing up a considerable literature<br/>
that has the tone of the following prediction:<br/>
<br/>
"Old ideas of Asia must be modified to-day.<br/>
<br/>
One is still apt to cherish the belief that <span style="color: #ff0000;">P </span>beneficent<br/>
Providence has placed the white nations forever in an<br/>
economic position which can never be seriously <span style="color: #0000FF;">assailed<br/>
</span>But there are already apparent the beginnings of a renewal<br/>
of the old struggle between the West and the East. Only<br/>
it is assuming a new form.<br/>
<br/>
"The real Asiatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">peril </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the acquisition by commercial<br/>
pressure and trade treaties of the right of entry to lands<br/>
now closed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>will be a repetition, less brutal and probably slower and more subtle, of the policy of Europe toward<br/>
Asia in the Nineteenth Century. The cloud to-day is no<br/>
bigger than a man's hand. In a generation it may darken<br/>
the whole political horizon."<br/>
<br/>
This is the writing of an Englishman, not of<br/>
a Californian agitator; for it is taken from<br/>
Mr. L. E. Neame's book on "The Asiatic<br/>
Danger in the Colonies." He goes on to say:<br/>
<br/>
"The Englishman who has never lived in Asia, or in<br/>
a country in which there has been a considerable influx<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatics</span>, does not grasp two things. It is not easy to<br/>
convince him that the Asiatic inevitably underlives and<br/>
undersells the white man. It is not less difficult to make<br/>
him understand that Asiatic immigration cannot be classed<br/>
with any other. It differs essentially from'the lowest<br/>
class of European immigration. The masses of Southern<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southeastern </span>Europeans who have entered the United<br/>
States will in time be absorbed in the population. The<br/>
process may take a varying length of time'with different<br/>
nationalities; but in the end there will emerge the American<br/>
people, even if their natural character becomes modified<br/>
by infusion of alien blood. But no white <span style="color: #ff0000;">race </span>can absorb<br/>
the Asiatic. The Eastern peoples always remain apart.<br/>
You can never get rid of what Meredith Townsend called<br/>
'the dull, unconquerable, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unmitigable</span>, distaste of Asiatics<br/>
for white <span style="color: #0000FF;">mem</span>' It is not unreciprocated. Deep down<br/>
beneath the strongest ideas of theoretical justice and the<br/>
desire to admit no prejudice there is a similar barrier."<br/>
<br/>
The best safeguard against the realization<br/>
of these large, vague fears is statesmanship<br/>
of the type and temper shown by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Secretary<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
