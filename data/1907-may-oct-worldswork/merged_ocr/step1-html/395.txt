formed to take over the Copper King mine,<br/>
on the coast of Guerrero. Mr. Charles<br/>
Schwab, ex-president of United States Steel<br/>
Corporation, is reported as having acquired<br/>
two silver mines in Chihuahua for $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500,000</span>.<br/>
A new $ 350,000 smelter at Guaymas, on the<br/>
Gulf of California, has given an impetus to<br/>
mining all along the line of the Sonora<br/>
Railroad.<br/>
<br/>
And so on, the items could be multiplied.<br/>
But the new and especially sensational feature<br/>
is copper. For Mexico copper is a new industry, yet production is going close to<br/>
150,000,000 pounds this year, a bound of 25<br/>
per cent. over last year. Experts figure on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">225,000,000 </span>pounds for next year, or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Str</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'cent</span>. gain over this year. And yet the industry<br/>
has only just begun. In 1901 Mexico <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>

fifth in copper mining. In 1902 it was third.<br/>
The next year found it second, and one year<br/>
later its output was one-fifth that of the United<br/>
States. As with silver and lead, it now exports<br/>
to us more copper than any other country.<br/>
<br/>
But it must not be thought that Mexico is<br/>
any less the greatest silver producer. Last<br/>
year it sent us $ 15,000,000 more than it did<br/>
the year before. But at the same time, it is<br/>
becoming more and more identified with gold<br/>
production. In 1904 it mined $ 15,300,000<br/>
worth, which was an increase of $ 4,000,000<br/>
over the year before, and also more than <span style="color: #ff0000;">onesixth </span>of what we mined ourselves. Last <span style="color: #0000FF;">year<br/>
</span>it sent us an increase of more than $ 3,000,000<br/>

<br/>
Where mining starts a country in life, it is<br/>
only after long years that any other industry<br/>
can predominate. And this is rare indeed<br/>
when the mineral deposits seem exhaustless,<br/>
as in Mexico. That any other human occupation should rival the digging of precious<br/>
metals at the very height of the fever means for<br/>
that country the most reliable of promises that<br/>
its prosperity will endure. Now Mexico has<br/>
never been identified in the popular mind as<br/>
a farming country, yet here is this remarkable<br/>
prediction, that within a few years its agricultural products will exceed its mineral output<br/>
a hundred-fold. It is based on a gradual<br/>
