<span>A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>recently sent to the Isthmus on this<br/>
errand. An inland city of Mississippi looking<br/>
across seas for trade!<br/>
<br/>
The people who own Mississippi have,<br/>
of course, been the planters. In recent years<br/>
the lumbermen have come to share this ownership, and the tradesmen follow. There is yet<br/>
little manufacturing in the state except lumber,<br/>
but the men who settled it were among the very<br/>
best immigrants from the older Southern States<br/>
to the East. They are men of ability and of<br/>
cultivation; and now that the era of <span style="color: #ff0000;">townbuilding </span>is coming, they are likely to show their<br/>
character, both in commercial and industrial<br/>
energy and in good judgment, and to have<br/>
better public leaders. But Mississippi is yet<br/>
an unoccupied land. When it has been<br/>
settled and even a small part of its rich area<br/>
brought under cultivation and its vast stretches<br/>
of country made accessible by railroads, it will<br/>
be a rich part of the great, rich valley.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Whitfield, the Superintendent of Public<br/>
Education in Mississippi, says that "never<br/>
in the history of the world was the life of a<br/>
people so completely changed as was the life<br/>
of the people of Mississippi by the war" -by<br/>
the change from the feudal organization of<br/>
society. There are more than 1,800 white<br/>
boys and girls at the industrial schools-a<br/>
fact that shows the practical turn of thought<br/>
and effort. "Our young men are <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriotically<br/>
</span>falling into line. They see that there is just<br/>
as much honor and emolument in being good<br/>
engineers as in being good lawyers."<br/>
diffusion of prosperity here, too, is indicated by<br/>
the growth of banks-from 113 to 247 since<br/>
1890; and the bank deposits have been multiplied by five and a half. From 1896 to 1899,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">565 </span>stock companies of all kinds were chartered,<br/>
with a capital of 25 millions; from 1900 to<br/>
1903, 1,312 were chartered, with a capital of<br/>
73 millions. The cotton crop, too, has greatly<br/>
increased-from a million bales in 1900 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>million and a half bales in 1906.<br/>
<br/>
NEW ORLEANS<br/>
<br/>
The revolutionary achievement of New<br/>
Orleans is its <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-fold </span>work of constructing<br/>
an adequate water-supply, a sewerage system,<br/>
and a system of drainage. The draining of<br/>
the city brings a new era in health and in building-they can have cellars now; and "skyscrapers" are going up that have <span style="color: #0000FF;">eighteen </span>or<br/>
twenty feet of dry land <span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The great city that is fast growing up there<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>9037<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-its </span>estimated population is now <span style="color: #ff0000;">340,000will </span>be an uncommonly healthful city; the last<br/>
report gives 17 deaths (whites) per 1,000.<br/>
<br/>
The imports increased <span style="color: #ff0000;">25 </span>per cent. and its<br/>
exports 16 per cent. in 1906 over 1905; and<br/>
last year 2,000 buildings were put up. A hint<br/>
of the growing valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>is given by this<br/>
fact-that the'Frisco Railroad system is<br/>
building terminals at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalmette </span>(seven miles<br/>
below the city) to cost 4 millions, and the new<br/>
sugar refinery there will cost 3 millions.<br/>
<br/>
The city, for an indefinite <span style="color: #0000FF;">time-as </span>it expands into a great metropolis-will keep its old<br/>
social charm and its partly foreign character,<br/>
which make it different from any other American city. Its very thought is different: it is<br/>
both extremely Southern and very strongly.<br/>
Roman Catholic.<br/>
<br/>
It has now passed its period of political depression and of epidemics. It has itself in hand.<br/>
It is growing rich. Even its geographical<br/>
isolation becomes less and less as its great<br/>
transportation systems multiply. It is the<br/>
great Southern gateway of the Great Valley<br/>
and the gay, <span style="color: #0000FF;">old</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-foreign</span>, peculiarly<br/>
Southern capital <span style="color: #0000FF;">besides</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>MEMPHIS<br/>
<br/>
For a story of commercial and industrial<br/>
activity, you may well <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>to the recent history<br/>
of Memphis-the city that, in a sense, lies in<br/>
the very heart of the Mississippi Valley. To<br/>
begin with, it made itself a remarkably <span style="color: #0000FF;">healthful </span>city by an effective sewerage system, and by<br/>
the use of artesian water. Its reported <span style="color: #0000FF;">death</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rate </span>is less than 10 per 1,000 of white persons.<br/>
Then it went about building itself, first of all<br/>
by its cotton. It is the market for nearly or<br/>
quite a million bales a year; and it must have<br/>
a new warehouse to shelter it and to ship it<br/>
from, a mammoth concrete structure of 160<br/>
compartments which shall hold 1,000 bales each,<br/>
with compresses. Then it went to work<br/>
building oil mills and the like; then its great<br/>
hardwood lumber industries followed. It built<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>million dollars worth of buildings in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1902</span>;<br/>
in 1903, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>millions; in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1904</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span>% millions, and<br/>
so on, till last year the buildings put up were<br/>
valued at about <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>millions. Its population<br/>
increased even faster; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third </span>of the<br/>
white people are said to be of Northern birth.<br/>
When a man or a company thinks of going to<br/>
Memphis to begin any industrial enterprise--or, if there be reason to think he may go <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>Memphis "commissioner" goes to see him;<br/>
