</span>York City handled 23,175 cases and<br/>
<br/>
spent less than $ 23,000. More than<br/>
23,000 people who would otherwise have been<br/>
defrauded were given justice at a cost of less than<br/>
$ 1 apiece. Probably there is no money spent<br/>
in the United States which does so much toward<br/>
planting a faith in our democracy among the<br/>
immigrants that come to our shores.<br/>
<br/>
This movement began in a small way. In<br/>
1876, some German merchants in New York<br/>
were so bothered with requests for legal aid<br/>
by immigrants from their own country that<br/>
twenty of them hired a lawyer to take care of<br/>
these complaints. He was known as "The<br/>
German Legal Aid Society." At a later date,<br/>
the scope was extended and the present organization confines itself to no one nationality.<br/>
The president of the society, Mr. Arthur von<br/>
Briesen, like Carl Schurz' and Jacob Riis,<br/>
came to New York filled with the greatest<br/>
admiration for the young Republic. He was<br/>
poor, and during his early years in this country<br/>
he came to realize how hard it was for foreigners<br/>
without money and without knowledge of our<br/>
court procedure to engage counsel or press<br/>
their suits in court. When the Legal Aid<br/>
Society <span style="color: #ff0000;">outgrew </span>its purely German character,<br/>
Mr. von Briesen became a member. He had<br/>
saved enough money to study law and, after<br/>
service in the Civil War, he took up his profession and built up a large practice. In 1890,<br/>
the chance came for him to lead in the work<br/>
which so deeply interested him as a young<br/>
man. He was elected president of the New<br/>
York Legal Aid Society because, as he said,<br/>
"there was no other fool on whose hands to let<br/>
it die." He has been at its head ever since and<br/>
he has seen the Society quadruple in size under<br/>
his direction. A year or two ago, the French<br/>
Government decorated him with the cross of<br/>
the Legion of Honor in recognition of his great<br/>
services to the poor.<br/>

<br/>
The New York Society was the pioneer.<br/>
Since its founding, similar organizations have<br/>
arisen in most of the large cities of this country<br/>
-Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Newark,<br/>
Hoboken, Pittsburg, Cleveland, Chicago, and<br/>
Denver. It is such a practical benevolence (for<br/>
it is supported chiefly by subscription), that it<br/>
has been copied abroad. London has a<br/>
similar organization and there are others <span style="color: #0000FF;">elsewhere </span>in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The work in New York is carried on through<br/>
six offices, which are conducted in the same<br/>
manner as the office of any large law firm. One<br/>
of the attorneys in charge finds out whether the<br/>
applicant is able to engage private counsel.<br/>
If the case is one which properly comes within<br/>
the Society's scope, a full statement is made<br/>
out and the applicant becomes a regular client.<br/>
In each case a retaining fee of ten cents is<br/>
charged, but when this sum cannot be paid,<br/>
the attorney is allowed to remit it. Ten per<br/>
cent. of amounts collected above $ 5 is charged,<br/>
and this, together with the retaining fees, is<br/>
paid into the Society's treasury.<br/>
<br/>
In the first year of its existence, the New<br/>
York Society handled 202 cases; in 1906,<br/>
3,175, and, in the first thirty years, 206,916<br/>
cases. The amount collected and paid<br/>
to clients during this thirty years was<br/>
$ 1,182,453.10. Of the 23,175 clients during<br/>
the year 1906, 7,154 were Americans, 3,434<br/>
were Russians, 3,412 were Germans, 3,122 were<br/>
subjects of Great Britain, and 3,017 were<br/>
Austro-Hungarians. More than half of the<br/>
applicants were men and more than half of<br/>
these had not yet become citizens of the United<br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
The best exposition of the work actually<br/>
accomplished is given by a few specific cases.<br/>
Take, for example, the following case handled<br/>
by the East-Side Branch, which does most of<br/>
its work among the Jews: A loan company,<br/>
doing business under the title of "The<br/>
