</span>on piles above the floods? To <span style="color: #ff0000;">mymemory</span>,<br/>
that nation was a hotbed of malaria, cholera,<br/>
and piracy. Clothes were few and far between.<br/>
Rats and mice were the staples of diet. Now,<br/>
turn from this picture of Siam to the picture of<br/>
Siam to-day. Along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-paved </span>streets of<br/>
Bangkok electric <span style="color: #0000FF;">cars </span>run to meet the great<br/>
steamers at the docks. Telegraph and <span style="color: #0000FF;">telephone </span>lines cross and recross, running to all<br/>
points along the mainland. Wireless <span style="color: #0000FF;">telegraphy </span>helps out to reach the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koh-aichang</span>, out in the Gulf. Four hundred miles<br/>
of railroad run hither and yon about the<br/>
country. The same Danish company that<br/>
runs the street-cars in Bangkok also provides<br/>
electric lights for the city. The policing of<br/>
the cities is good, the sanitation excellent.<br/>
Schools are scattered all over the country.<br/>
Siam is rapidly approaching the condition of a<br/>
civilized country.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the King is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chulalongkorn</span>, but<br/>
for years past the real management of the<br/>
country has been in the hands of foreigners,<br/>
British, Danish, American. An American<br/>
diplomat, Mr. E. H. Stroebel, has had as much<br/>
as anyone else to do with the uplifting of Siam.<br/>
Working closely with a group of English<br/>
officials, "lent by the Indian Government,"<br/>
he has been a factor in most of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feforms</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>The British <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation </span>of Zululand has <span style="color: #0000FF;">eliminated </span>the national pursuit<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Zulu, war, but peace finds some use <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the Zulu<br/>
<br/>
The King appears to have joined the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Automobile </span>Club of Bangkok, and left the reins of<br/>
government in the hands of this American,<br/>
these Englishmen, and Prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Damrongtse</span>, a<br/>
Siamese of English training. The combination<br/>
has worked like a charm.<br/>

Ten years ago, slavery was in full force;<br/>
