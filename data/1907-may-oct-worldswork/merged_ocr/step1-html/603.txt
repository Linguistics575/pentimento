other companies noted above. They can also<br/>
be surmounted in the trade of selling <span style="color: #0000FF;">high<br/>
</span>class bonds, once the tradition of the Wall Street<br/>
banker is laid aside. That tradition makes a<br/>
bond <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,000 </span>instrument, and makes the<br/>
investor a rich man. No intelligent effort has<br/>
ever been made to give to the smaller investor<br/>
the same chance that is afforded to the larger<br/>
investor in railroad and <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-class </span>industrial<br/>
bonds. It is time that such an effort be made.<br/>
<br/>
Turning from bonds, the small saver of<br/>
money may <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>some field in the guaranteed<br/>
stocks, usually issued in lots of $ 100 but <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>in shares of $ 50 or $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>. These stocks<br/>
are mostly the capital of small railroads and<br/>
industrials leased by the great railroads and<br/>
trusts. The Pennsylvania, New <span style="color: #0000FF;">York </span>Central,<br/>
Baltimore & Ohio, Delaware, Lackawanna &<br/>
Western, all have solid guaranteed stocks.<br/>
Some of them sell very high. Most of the<br/>
stocks guaranteed by the Eastern railroads<br/>
yield the investor little more than 4 per cent.<br/>
They have the advantage, however, of being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tax-free</span>. like most stocks. Also, they are<br/>
perfectly safe. Almost any strong banking<br/>
house will furnish a list of such stocks on request, with prices. A few good banking<br/>
houses in Wall Street make a specialty of<br/>
them. As <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>class, the writer believes that<br/>
there is no other form of investment better than<br/>
this for the man who would save his money in<br/>
small blocks.<br/>

of course, affords an unlimited <span style="color: #0000FF;">field</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the<br/>
great majority of cases, however, THE WORLD'S<br/>
WORK hesitates to advise taking them for<br/>
savings. If a man wants to buy stocks of this<br/>
sort, it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span>better to buy the good, solid, <span style="color: #0000FF;">preferred </span>stocks of the best roads than to buy the<br/>
common stocks, subject to wide changes in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">price</span>, up or down, and subject to market<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>sorts. At a time like the<br/>
present, a man might well select stocks like<br/>
Baltimore & Ohio preferred, Norfolk & <span style="color: #0000FF;">Western </span>preferred, Union Pacific preferred, Atchison<br/>
preferred, and put his savings into them. The<br/>
only danger is that if a man gets the habit of<br/>
buying these listed stocks he is apt to persist in<br/>
it, both in booms and depressions. Unless he<br/>
wants to be called upon to use considerable<br/>
discretion at all times, he might far better leave<br/>
the listed stocks entirely alone.<br/>
<br/>
It will be seen that there is an answer to the<br/>
query with which this article began. The<br/>
field is fairly wide, but not yet wide enough.<br/>
The most desirable of all the chances for investment is still practically closed to the regular<br/>
saver of small funds. That it will be opened<br/>
soon is the belief and the hope of the writer.<br/>
In the meantime, the saver of this character<br/>
may find his best chance in the stocks, or even<br/>
in the real-estate field if he is able to <span style="color: #0000FF;">discriminate</span>. We do not recommend investment<br/>
through insurance policies. If you want insurance, for its own sake, buy it; but it is not<br/>
a profitable form of investment.<br/>

The New York man studied over this for a<br/>
