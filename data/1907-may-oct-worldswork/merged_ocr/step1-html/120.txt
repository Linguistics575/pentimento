I introduced a number of new things during<br/>
the year. The first was a Thanksgiving<br/>
Day celebration; later on a Christmas-tree.<br/>
Few of them had ever seen a Christmastree before. We must have had 2,000<br/>
people at one of the large churches and the<br/>
grown people as well as the children got a<br/>
better idea of how Christmas should be celebrated.<br/>
<br/>
The year was a busy one but I had found time<br/>
for reading and study, so the superintendent<br/>
of schools for Prince Edward County, whose<br/>
law office was in Farmville, gave me lessons<br/>
in law and loaned me such of his books as I<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">needed</span>. He would not accept any pay but<br/>
often allowed me to work in his office on<br/>
Saturdays copying deeds, contracts, etc., which<br/>
saved time for him and was splendid practice<br/>
for me. I had always had a feeling that I<br/>
should like to study law. This enabled me to<br/>
occupy my evenings in a systematic and definite<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Cumberland County seemed to me just<br/>
the place for a small school on the Hampton plan, so I got some of the more substantial<br/>
colored men together and we went over a<br/>
scheme for such a school. I wrote to some of<br/>
my teachers at Hampton, setting forth our<br/>
plans. They advised me not to do it but to<br/>
return to Hampton and complete my course.<br/>
They felt that I did not have sufficient education<br/>
to undertake such a work. Thus I was led<br/>
to give up the scheme. My school term was<br/>
only five months, but I induced the parents to<br/>
lengthen the term a month and a half and we<br/>
succeeded in raising <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>money to continue our school with the two teachers for that<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It was very difficult to leave that community.<br/>
The colored people, who were assured of the<br/>
assistance of the whites, offered to double my<br/>
salary the next year if I would come back, and<br/>
I was told by the county superintendent that<br/>
I might have a school in his county as long as<br/>
he was in office. He visited my school a number of times during the year, as did also other<br/>
members of the district board. He used to<br/>
hold it up as a model to the other colored<br/>
teachers and to some of the white as well, and<br/>
several of the white teachers came to see our<br/>
work. We taught the boys to drill and the<br/>
girls to take gymnastic exercises and they all<br/>
sang under my leading the plantation songs,<br/>
which they learned to love and appreciate even<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #ff0000;">NEGRo</span>'s UPHILL CLIMB<br/>
<br/>
in school. We gave Friday-evening talks to<br/>
the parents and older children on habits and<br/>
manners and many other things that seemed<br/>
to us needful.<br/>
<br/>
That summer I found work in Philadelphia<br/>
in John Wanamaker's store, where I came<br/>
indirectly under the influence of Mr. Robert<br/>
C. Ogden, whose office, among other things,<br/>
it was my duty to clean.<br/>
<br/>
I returned to Hampton in October, 1889,<br/>
and entered upon the Senior year. This was<br/>
in some ways my most interesting year. Some<br/>
seventy pupils had been promoted but only<br/>
forty-eight returned. I had served as a captain in the battalion during my Middle year;<br/>
now I was senior captain and also assisted Mr.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span>W. Freeland, who was then commandant<br/>
of the school cadets.<br/>
<br/>
When I entered Hampton, I had no particular plan or notion as to what I should do<br/>
when I should have completed the course.<br/>
As time went on, I was more and more inclined<br/>
to the legal profession. Most of my teachers<br/>
advised against it, however; that is, they<br/>
raised the question whether I thought I could<br/>
render my people the greatest service as a<br/>
lawyer, and whether legal advice was the<br/>
greatest need of an ignorant, struggling people.<br/>
During the last half of the year, General Armstrong taught the Senior class in the Outline<br/>
Study of Man. I have scant recollection what<br/>
I learned from the ttrt-book, but I doubt if<br/>
there is a member of that class to-day who does<br/>
not feel the power and influence of General<br/>
Armstrong's strong, earnest, forceful personality. Before many months most of the<br/>
class-Indians as well as Negroes-had determined that they would engage in some work<br/>
that would definitely help their races.'<br/>
<br/>
One Saturday night in the early spring,<br/>
General Armstrong invited the Senior boys<br/>
to his house, where he told us some interesting<br/>
war experiences with Negro soldiers. When<br/>
we rose to leave, he asked me to remain. He<br/>
took me into his study and questioned me as<br/>
to my plans for the future. I told him of my<br/>
industrial school scheme for Cumberland<br/>
County and my desire to help those people.<br/>
He thought I could be of more use to my people<br/>
by remaining at Hampton and helping to<br/>
prepare teachers. The result was that at the<br/>
close of school in June, 1890, I accepted the<br/>
position of drill-master and assistant to the<br/>
commandant of the school cadets.<br/>
