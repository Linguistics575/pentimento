</span>for instance, will prove as interesting to many<br/>
as the sight of the battleships. These races<br/>
will be in competition for various cups, the<br/>
principal of which are those offered by President<br/>
Roosevelt, by King Edward, by Emperor<br/>
William, and by Sir Thomas Lipton. In<br/>
addition to the races for these cups, there will<br/>
be at least twenty other cup races, participated<br/>
in by all sorts of crafts. One of these events is<br/>
a motor-boat race from New York City to<br/>
Hampton Roads; another will be run from the<br/>
Exposition to the Bermuda Islands.<br/>

is the "War Path," which corresponds to the<br/>
"Midway," the "Pike," and the "Trail"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>previous expositions. The attractions here<br/>

historical events in harmony with the plan<br/>

Extensive preparations have also been made<br/>
for tests with airships and balloons by individuals and by aeronautical clubs of the United<br/>
States and foreign countries, especially France.<br/>
The latter country will conduct tests with a<br/>
view to determining the usefulness of balloons<br/>
in military manoeuvres. Among the other events<br/>
of this nature are various <span style="color: #ff0000;">internatio.nal </span>athletic<br/>
contests, which will be participated in by<br/>
visitors from all parts of the United States and<br/>
from England, France, Germany, and Austria.<br/>
<br/>
known collectively as the Arts and Crafts<br/>
Village. In this building is taught, on stated<br/>
occasions, a model school comprising all grades.<br/>
Competent teachers are employed and pupils<br/>
are supplied by the surrounding cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News, and other<br/>
contiguous points.<br/>
<br/>
In a building set aside for Education and<br/>
Social Economy is an educational exhibit<br/>
