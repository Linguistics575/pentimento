is coming in at the rate of $ 200,000,000 a year.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller may think all this no more than<br/>
the boom in our own country spilling over the<br/>
border. Yet, by the last analysis, it is found<br/>
to be due to Mexico itself; above all, to<br/>
its <span style="color: #0000FF;">statesmanship</span>. There rages, for instance<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span>of the wave will keep on growing. As someone<br/>
aptly puts it, Mexico has just begun to scratch<br/>
around the margin of its opportunities. Yet<br/>
it makes good its title to premier rank in LatinAmerica. Not fifty years ago, European<br/>
troops landed to collect debts. To-day <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mexico<br/>
</span>is blessed with fiscal independence. Last year<br/>
it came out $ 10,000,000 ahead, and there was<br/>
a reserve of $ 36,000,000 more in the treasury.<br/>
But it is reducing taxes, paying higher salaries,<br/>
and spending millions on public works. Thus<br/>

<br/>
</span>For which American residents and American capital are chiefly responsible<br/>
<br/>
no boom in Venezuela. But in Mexico there<br/>
has never been so much development work as<br/>
now. It swells imposingly along every line,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dwarfing </span>the red-blanketed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Indito </span>huddled in<br/>
stolid awe. There are the titanic irrigation<br/>
dams, the sea walls, the wheels turned by water<br/>
a hundred miles distant, the electric hoists in<br/>
shafts abandoned for centuries, the fields<br/>
that were mesquite flats only a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
Do not, however, mistake this for inflation.<br/>
There is, of course, a crest to the wave and bad<br/>
times will whip off the foam, but the volume<br/>
<br/>
a wise exploitation of resources has produced<br/>
taxable property. During six months, more<br/>
than 1,000,000 acres of government lands were<br/>
transferred to private ownership.<br/>
<br/>
Another sign of enduring prosperity is the<br/>
building of public works. There is the new<br/>
federal <span style="color: #0000FF;">postoffice </span>at the capital, the first completed of a superb group of government buildings, as well as the first modern one. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Here<br/>
</span>the American postal system is being <span style="color: #0000FF;">inaugurated-an </span>official recognition of the invasion of<br/>
American methods. Even the special <span style="color: #0000FF;">furniture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
