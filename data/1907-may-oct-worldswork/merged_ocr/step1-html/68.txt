<br/>
the traces would tangle. But provisions must<br/>
be packed in; so the hunter ties some on the<br/>
dog's back, the rest on his own shoulders by<br/>
the pack strap around his forehead; and with<br/>
cased gun in hand, forward he marches. Of<br/>
his lonely nights in the snow-padded silences<br/>
of the great forests, of his lonelier tramps over<br/>
the frost-glazed drifts till the snow-glare sets<br/>
the purple patches dancing in his vision, of<br/>
being snowed up by blizzards for weeks at a<br/>
time till provisions run low and his only course<br/>
is to take a reef in his belt each day-space does<br/>
not permit the story. Woe to the trapper who<br/>
has been "holed-up" by storm with "a pardner" of the trail and comes out of those winter<br/>
quarters without that partner. He will have<br/>
to tell a very straight story, indeed, of how he<br/>
escaped and the partner didn't, unless he wishes<br/>
to fall under the suspicion of having "done his<br/>
pardner" to death-scuttled provisions, run<br/>
away, or let him starve. And when spring<br/>
comes, the furs that have been trapped and<br/>
cached for the winter must be brought out<br/>
much the same way that the hunter went into<br/>
the wild-by packing over rough ground, by<br/>
dog-sleigh or canoe on a clear trail, down to<br/>
some point on the railroad like Edmonton or<br/>
Winnipeg.<br/>
<br/>
Or take the romance of the sea otter exposed for sale at Nijni. Formerly ermine was<br/>
the badge of nobility in Russia and could be<br/>
worn by no one else. Then it commanded<br/>
fabulous prices. To-day, sea otter is the<br/>
badge of wealth and rank. When sea otter<br/>
were first taken off the Aleutian Islands of<br/>
Alaska, the catch ran from 100,000 a year to<br/>
140,000. To-day, it has dwindled down to<br/>
400, of which-I am told by <span style="color: #0000FF;">traders-only </span>200<br/>
come to the American market. Any over that<br/>
go to Russia. The sea otter is a furred creature of the sea more the size of a large dog than<br/>
of an otter. Hold a pelt up by the nose with the<br/>
tail tip just touching the floor-it is longer than<br/>
a six-foot man. In the days when sea otter<br/>
were plentiful, they could be shot by still hunt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>calm weather, as their heads came to the<br/>
surface of the sea to breathe. Now they must<br/>
be hunted in the teeth of the wildest Alaskan<br/>
gale. The native Aleutian rides out in his <span style="color: #ff0000;">skinskiff</span>, with oiled-skin wrapping his body tight<br/>
round the little manhole where he sits in the<br/>
skin covering, so that the boat can take no<br/>
water. Double-bladed paddle plying from<br/>
side to side, the hunter mounts the seething<br/>
waves and rides in on the back of the storm to<br/>
<br/>
THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">reefiest </span>coasts of the Aleutians. Here the<br/>
sea otter have been driven by the storm and<br/>
hide with their heads buried in the tossing,<br/>
wave-washed seaweed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beaching </span>his boat,<br/>
the hunter runs from rock to rock, slippery as<br/>
glass, beaten by the wind, sometimes caught<br/>
by the waves and hurled to death. A single<br/>
blow of his gaff-pole, and he has killed the sea<br/>
otter, whose pelt is to be exposed for sale at<br/>
Nijni.<br/>
THE CRUELTY OF SEAL-POACHERS<br/>
<br/>
Or, take the pelt of the beautiful Alaskan<br/>
fur seal. These are best dressed in England<br/>
and those from the North American Commercial Company, which has the exclusive<br/>
right to the Pribilof Islands, will be found<br/>
chiefly in the London auction marts; but there<br/>
is also a Russian sealskin company with rights<br/>
on the Commander Islands; and the biggest<br/>
sealer of all is the unnamed company of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">poachers-Japanese</span>, American, Canadian.<br/>
The poachers rove the high seas, raiding the<br/>
migrating herds, and when a heavy fog falls<br/>
they scoot in under cover across the forbidden<br/>
line and plunder the seal islands <span style="color: #ff0000;">themselvesboth </span>the American islands of Pribilof and the<br/>
Russian Commander Group. Cruisers are on<br/>
the lookout for poachers; but cruisers can't<br/>
see through fog; and fog at the seal islands<br/>
falls thick as wool. What ground there is for<br/>
it, I don't know-but the Japanese, who were<br/>
not signatories to the sealing treaty, get the<br/>
credit or discredit of being the most recklessly<br/>
daring and cruel poachers. In 1874, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fun<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seal </span>herd numbered almost 5,000,000. In<br/>
1891-98, at the time of the American-Canadian<br/>
dispute, it numbered only 1,000,000. To-day,<br/>
in spite of the international treaty forbidding<br/>
sealing within sixty miles of the seal islands, the<br/>
seal herd numbers barely 180,000. Not so<br/>
many years ago, 100,000 seal pelts were annually<br/>
brought to the markets of the world.<br/>
<br/>
"I don't <span style="color: #0000FF;">believe</span>," said one of the largest<br/>
traders in the world-one who was lately<br/>
called on to give information to the President<br/>
on the subject because he has no connection<br/>
with either the San Francisco or the St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petersburg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">companies-Nhat </span>there will be more than<br/>
10,000 or 14,000 seals come to market annually<br/>
for the next few years. The trouble is not so<br/>
much in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sealing </span>itself-it is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">indiscriminate </span>killing. Hunters who shoot the<br/>
migrating herds as they swim can't tell male<br/>
from females. On the islands, the females <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
