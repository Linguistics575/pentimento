WILD ANIMAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">PHOTOGRAPHY<br/>
<br/>
</span>In July, 1906, Mr. W. H. Wright found a<br/>
trail into a swamp where bear went to feed, in<br/>
the main range of the Rockies at the southeast<br/>

corner of Yellowstone Park. Here he tied<br/>
a thread across the trail, so fastened to the<br/>
camera that if it were disturbed it would set<br/>
off the flashlight powder and open the shutter<br/>
of the camera. He then retired some distance<br/>
and waited.<br/>
<br/>
"Soon an old she-bear with three little cubs<br/>
came down the trail," said Mr. Wright, "but<br/>
they were just as cautious as others had<br/>
been. Every few feet the old mother bear<br/>
would stop and sniff the air, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and-the </span>babies<br/>
had to do just as she did. If she stood up<br/>
on her hind feet, they also stood up. When<br/>
the mother bear stopped to sniff the air, they<br/>
would run up to her and, placing their tiny<br/>
feet against her sides, would peer wisely and<br/>
anxiously ahead until the old lady started on<br/>
again. When they came to the thread they<br/>
stopped short; while the old bear was taking<br/>
a good sniff at the cord, her babies stood up<br/>
with their fore-feet resting against her body<br/>
and waited the result of the sniff<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>I imagine<br/>
it may have been a little different from what<br/>
they had expected, for, after satisfying herself<br/>
that the obstacle was placed there for no good,<br/>
mama gave a lively snort that could have been<br/>
heard for a hundred yards and, without waiting<br/>
for her babies to get down, she turned tail and<br/>
upset the whole lot, disappearing up the trail<br/>
like a whirlwind with the little cubs trying<br/>
their best to overtake her.<br/>
