</span>IS THE DOCTOR A SHYLOCK? 8895<br/>
<br/>
I called him once to come in haste to a laboring<br/>
man whose ankle had been badly crushed; it<br/>
was a protracted case and upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surgeon's<br/>
</span>skill depended the man's ability to support his<br/>
family. The charge for all services was $ 25.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. C. is an older surgeon, and there is none<br/>
in his city who outranks him. Before me lies<br/>
the record of his first <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOO </span>operations for appendicitis, read to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small group of surgeons the<br/>
evening after the last operation. Every man<br/>
in the room sat straight up when he began to<br/>
read it, for it was well known that his operations<br/>
had been the most desperate of all. "Forlorn<br/>
hopes," upon which other surgeons refused<br/>
to operate, sent for Dr. C. If there appeared<br/>
one chance in ten to save life, the surgeon took<br/>
reputation in his teeth and went in. His<br/>
colleagues accused him of occasionally operating<br/>
after death! His remarkable success with<br/>
these cases does not concern this article so<br/>
much as his compensation. For no operation<br/>
out of the hundred did he receive more than<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1,000</span>; the average was $ 100.<br/>
<br/>
SPECIALISTS AND GENERAL PRACTITIONERS<br/>
<br/>
In this representative city are eight "<span style="color: #0000FF;">successful</span>" specialists in diseases of the eye, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ear</span>,<br/>
nose, and throat. Their annual incomes are<br/>
about as follows:<br/>
<br/>
2 make from <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12,000 </span>to $ 15,000<br/>
3 make from <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000 </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2,000<br/>
</span>3 make from 3,000 to 6,000<br/>
<br/>
Besides the foregoing, there are probably not<br/>
more than two or three specialists in other lines<br/>
who receive as much as $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000 </span>a year.<br/>
<br/>
Of the general practitioners, there are probably fifteen in the upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">ranks-men </span>of<br/>
excellent reputations, prominent in medical<br/>
societies, most of them professors in medical<br/>
colleges. A fair estimate of their yearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">in-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comes </span>is the following:<br/>
<br/>
3 or 4 range above<br/>
4 or 5 range from 8,000 to $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000<br/>
</span>6 or 8 range from 4,000 to 8,000<br/>
General average of the fifteen: 8,000<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">510,000 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">year<br/>
<br/>
</span>What do they do to earn it? They are in<br/>
their carriages so constantly that it is difficult<br/>
to keep office hours, rarely possible to leave the<br/>
city for a few days, and impossible to take a<br/>
vacation without serious loss. To gain an<br/>
income of this size, they do much more than<br/>
ordinary day-and-night medical work. Most<br/>
of them are also insurance examiners and<br/>
physicians to institutions; many of them lecture<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">$ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">10,000 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">year<br/>
<br/>
</span>to students more hours than the average college<br/>
professor, and also spend many hours each<br/>
week in clinics and laboratories.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to fees, I systematized the<br/>
accounts of one of these general practitioners<br/>
and kept his books for two years. His practice<br/>
is large and wealthy, and his standing is such<br/>
that when he rises in a medical society to discuss<br/>
a case, all others sit down. His scale of prices,<br/>
which rarely varied, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>in this way: day<br/>
visits, $ 2 or $ 3; night visits, $ 5; office consultation, $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">31 </span>or $ 2; consultation with other<br/>
physicians in serious cases, <span style="color: #ff0000;">$ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>or $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">10</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>special<br/>
examinations, $ 5 to $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>His bills were<br/>
rendered all the way from three months to a<br/>
year after the service, according to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">patient's<br/>
</span>circumstances. The only instances I can recall<br/>
when payment was insisted upon were cases<br/>
where <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-to-do </span>patients were in flagrant<br/>
default. At the end of every month, the number of calls I was instructed not to transfer to<br/>
the ledger was surprisingly large; they were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">profit </span>and loss. Medical service to students<br/>
and to institutions was not recorded, even on<br/>
his daily memorandum. "At least half of<br/>
our work <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">never </span>paid for," he said one day<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'u-except </span>in thanks or the reverse."<br/>
<br/>
Yet this man, like most of his colleagues<br/>
throughout the country, is stamped as a Shylock<br/>
by the easy writer who feels the sting of a recent bill for medical attention.<br/>
<br/>
All these whose incomes are given fall within<br/>
the 20 per cent. doing the bulk of the business.<br/>
Of the remaining 80 per <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, one thoroughly<br/>
competent to judge says that the young doctor<br/>
probably makes from $ 500 to $ 1,000 a year<br/>
during his first five years of practice. After<br/>
his business is established, his average should<br/>
be about $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,800</span>, gross. Another places the<br/>
average income for the entire country at $ 1,000;<br/>
he thinks 80 per cent. collect less than $ 3,000<br/>
a year.<br/>
<br/>
THE COUNTRY DOCTOR<br/>
<br/>
The income of the doctor in the small town,<br/>
if his practice be established, will range from<br/>
$ 750 to $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">51,250 </span>a year. A Western physician<br/>
made the statement last year that careful inquiry made by him in nine different states had<br/>
shown that the charges of physicians had not<br/>
increased one cent in <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>years, though<br/>
the incomes of the people had more than<br/>
doubled. The schedule for four states was<br/>
about as follows: Day visit in town, $ 1; <span style="color: #0000FF;">office<br/>
</span>consultation, 50 cents; country visits, <span style="color: #0000FF;">50 </span>cents<br/>
<br/>
