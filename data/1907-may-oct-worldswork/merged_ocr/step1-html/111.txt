<span>THE SECRETS OF THE MOSQUITO<br/>
<br/>
boring ship in a fog, was familiar with this<br/>
gnat mechanism? With perpetuation of his<br/>
kind insured, the male mosquito shortly dies;<br/>
the widowed female, within a couple of days,<br/>
will deposit her quota of posthumous eggs in<br/>
the form of an "egg-boat" on the placid surface of some neighboring pool-and so the<br/>
vicious circle of mosquito perpetuation is<br/>
complete.<br/>
<br/>
Clear knowledge of the divisions of this<br/>
cycle of mosquito life, the time spent as egg,<br/>
larva, pupa, and mosquito, is necessary in our<br/>
efforts at extermination of the pests; and the<br/>
face of a clock affords a simple mnemonic.<br/>
Consider each hour of the clock as representing<br/>
one day in mosquito development. From<br/>
XII around to XII will be twelve days,<br/>
divided as follows: From egg-laying at XII<br/>
to II <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'c'is</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">turo </span>days, hatching of the larvae;<br/>
from II to <span style="color: #ff0000;">VII-five </span>days, change of the larvae<br/>
into pupae; from VII to <span style="color: #ff0000;">X-thrs </span>days, birth<br/>
of the mosquitoes; and from X to <span style="color: #ff0000;">XII-two<br/>
</span>days, deposit of eggs by the "new" mosquitoes.<br/>
This division of time represents an average,<br/>
there being many variations; warm weather<br/>
and abundance of food hasten development,<br/>
while their opposites retard it.<br/>
<br/>
Such, in brief, are the conspicuous family<br/>
secrets of the great little enemies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">man-the </span>mosquitoes. Far more interesting and<br/>
important from our human standpoint are the<br/>
why. and wherefore of malaria and yellow fever,<br/>
now known to result from mosquito bites and<br/>
only from them. Suspicion began to fasten on<br/>
mosquitoes in general as responsible for human<br/>
malaria back 2,000 years ago. But since<br/>
only two branches of this great family of over<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hundred clans could inoculate man, because<br/>
the microscopic tools were lacking; and<br/>
because the peculiar problems of bacteriology<br/>
are the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>in the world to solve, it<br/>
took centuries to reach a <span style="color: #0000FF;">verdict-tho</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>it<br/>
required but six years when modern methods<br/>
of investigation were applied. Why the <span style="color: #0000FF;">anopheles<br/>
</span>only can given us malaria, and the stegomyia<br/>
holds a similar monopoly on yellow fever, is a<br/>
question that involves the fundamental fact<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">inbacteriology-immurlitr </span>And the simplest<br/>
answer to this is, that-just as cows grow on<br/>
grass, tigers on meat, vultures on "high"<br/>
carrion, and man on every conglomeration<br/>
under the sun-so certain spores, bacteria,<br/>
micro-organisms, and fungi can thrive on certain<br/>
foods only; and when an <span style="color: #ff0000;">anophelina </span>mosquito<br/>
bites a man whose blood is at a certain stage of<br/>
<br/>
8909<br/>
<br/>
malarial fever, it will take in and hold in its<br/>
stomach forms of malarial germs which will<br/>
thrive because they will find food in the anopheles only on which they can develop. There<br/>
is thus a difference in the nutritive material<br/>
between one family of mosquitoes and another.<br/>
Then, in from one to two weeks, this anopheles<br/>
rascal, if he bites a healthy man, will insert the<br/>
malarial parasite; this will multiply in the<br/>
man's blood until, if a healthy <span style="color: #ff0000;">anophelese<br/>
</span>innocent bites him, there will be yet another<br/>
mosquito armed with the germ. And this is<br/>
the "vicious circle" of give and take. Which<br/>
side started it we know not, but man must get<br/>
his malarial inoculation from some member of<br/>
the anopheles family, which has in her turn<br/>
been foolish enough to draw blood from some<br/>
human being whose blood<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>was in active ferment<br/>
from the disease.<br/>
<br/>
Yellow fever yields similar facts-the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stegomyia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fasciata </span>being in this case cup-bearer to<br/>
King Yellow Jack. Along the Atlantic coast<br/>
the most common variety of mosquito is the<br/>
Culex <span style="color: #ff0000;">solicitans</span>, which breeds in swamps.<br/>
The little fellows who can "osmose" through<br/>
the meshes of mosquito netting are the Culex<br/>
pipiens, who much affect rain-water barrels<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof-tanks</span>, water which cannot be treated<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiseptics</span>, as it is used for drinking purposes. Any kind of mosquito may cause <span style="color: #ff0000;">bloodpoisoning </span>by accidentally carrying septic matter on his "hypodermic needle," but the<br/>
anopheles and stegomyia are the old families<br/>
holding proprietary rights in the distribution<br/>
of definite parasitic diseases in our part of the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
EXTERMINATION OF THE PESTS<br/>
<br/>
Three brief clauses will just about state the<br/>
whole method of destroying mosquitoes wholesale and efficiently. Drain all standing waters<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">fill </span>in depressions; screen all waters kept for<br/>
domestic uses; and keep crude petroleum on<br/>
all cess-pools. Mosquito larvae can develop only<br/>
in water, and the time-clock shows how long<br/>
the water must stand to breed from eggs to<br/>
flying mosquitoes. The great mosquito <span style="color: #0000FF;">factories-the </span>swamps-are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to render<br/>
sterile. They can be drained at a cost of about<br/>
$ 1.50 an acre. Mosquito larvae cannot thrive<br/>
in rapidly running water, their hold on the<br/>
surface in breathing being broken until they<br/>
suffocate; and they cannot survive in tidewaters flowing in and out of inlets and ditches.<br/>
