busy, are of secondary importance-are the<br/>
mere physical handles whereby they take hold<br/>
on the real subject. For the real subject <span style="color: #0000FF;">is-Are </span>the railroads law-abiding creatures or are<br/>
they great forces above the law, whose attorneys<br/>
"take care of legislation by whatever means<br/>
may be most effective," and whose subordinate<br/>
officers "explain things to the general public?"<br/>
It is the lack of frankness with the public, the<br/>
lack of straightforward dealing, the yielding<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">discreditable </span>political <span style="color: #0000FF;">methods-these </span>are<br/>
the things that the public resents and builds<br/>
suspicion on. And in many cases, when the<br/>
probe of publicity has been inserted by force,<br/>
these suspicions have been justified.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a railroad is a great public institution<br/>
as well as a corporation to do business, and it<br/>
must have relations with public opinion as<br/>
well as with its business patrons and with<br/>
its stockholders. The President or the owner<br/>
of a railroad and its officers are, therefore, to<br/>
a degree public servants. When they deal<br/>
candidly with the public, and when they have<br/>
nothing to conceal either in their financial<br/>
policies or in their practical management, they<br/>
have nothing to fear from the public. There<br/>
are railroads and railroad managers that are<br/>
regarded only as public benefactors. There<br/>
are even railroads which habitually win cases<br/>
in the courts for personal damages-railroads<br/>
that have the public feeling of the communities<br/>
that they serve wholly in their favor. But<br/>
these are not roads that are managed by men<br/>
whose lawyers "take care of legislation" and<br/>
whose subordinates "explain things to the<br/>
general public." They have no concealed or<br/>
questionable financial thimble-rigging; they do<br/>
not take a part in politics; they do not have<br/>
secret rates or give rebates; they simply do<br/>
their business "in the open" and their managers regard the whole public as their partners,<br/>
worthy of confidence and of frank dealing.<br/>
<br/>
If Mr. Harriman himself and other railroad<br/>
"magnates" had followed this <span style="color: #0000FF;">policy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
</span>dealt directly with the public and with public<br/>
opinion without cynicism and without concealment, there would now be no acute railroad<br/>
trouble. But simply <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>coming out in the open<br/>
and telling the people the railroads' side of<br/>
the matter" is not enough. They must <span style="color: #0000FF;">remain </span>in the open, work in the open, and keep<br/>
the public in their confidence. A few years of<br/>
such a policy as this would silence all wild<br/>
talk of governmental ownership, would make<br/>
any troublesome governmental control <span style="color: #0000FF;">un<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>8821<br/>
<br/>
necessary, and would cause public opinion to<br/>
have a vociferous enthusiasm for the railroads.<br/>
The people would boast of them as they boast<br/>
of schools and great works of public utility.<br/>
The roads would have public sentiment in<br/>
their favor in the courts, in the legislatures,<br/>
in the public press; and our great railroad<br/>
men would be regarded as public benefactors<br/>
and as great leaders rather than as silent and<br/>
inaccessible plotters against the public welfare.<br/>
Mr. Harriman ought to have become frank<br/>
and confidential and loquacious fifteen years<br/>
ago and been as willing all these years "to<br/>
explain the railroads' side of the matter" as<br/>
he has recently become. The purpose of the<br/>
public as it expresses itself through President<br/>
Roosevelt and through radical and even foolish<br/>
state legislatures is only to bring and to keep<br/>
the railroads "in the open." The public<br/>
goes about it in rough ways, often in unjust<br/>
ways, and it does not make proper discriminations: for a democracy uses crude and often<br/>
cruel tools. But it does insist that its institutions and agents shall be <span style="color: #0000FF;">democratic-shall </span>live and work "in the open"; and this<br/>
result is all that it is trying to accomplish.<br/>
The little questions of rates and fares and the<br/>
like are important only as methods of carrying<br/>
this main point. And quiet will come just as<br/>
fast as Mr. Harriman's new plan of action is<br/>
generally carried into effect.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the railroad "magnate" of the near<br/>
future may, if he be wise enough as well as<br/>
frank enough, become as great a public hero<br/>
as the college president, for instance, now is;<br/>
or, for that matter, perhaps, as-the President<br/>
of the United States himself. But he will<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>to dismiss his lobbies and press agents and<br/>
demean himself as a servant of the whole public<br/>
as well as of his directors and stockholders.<br/>
He must cease to be a Great Person of silence<br/>
and of mystery and of cynicism and of dark<br/>
politics and of private cars and of adventures<br/>
in the stock-market. He must become a<br/>
democratic public servant<br/>

ON THE LITTLENESS OF THE GREAT<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IF </span>IT be an anxious spring for great <span style="color: #0000FF;">fman</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ciers </span>and for minor Presidential candidates, it is pleasant to think that the Average<br/>
American Citizen-whose first thought is<br/>
neither political nor financial-seems to be in<br/>
good mood with this cheerful season of the<br/>
year. True, he must have money and he will<br/>
have politics. But he has tasks of his own to<br/>
