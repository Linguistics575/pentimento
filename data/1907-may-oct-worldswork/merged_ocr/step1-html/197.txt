<br/>
</span>sentiment is growing up that in time will force<br/>
all these children into the schools, and it is<br/>
largely on <span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the mill prosperity that the<br/>
school facilities are being made adequate to<br/>
attend to them. The mill <span style="color: #0000FF;">presidents</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">convention </span>of South Carolina recommended to<br/>
the legislature of that state that it pass a compulsory-education bill. Since then North<br/>
Carolina has passed such a law and another<br/>
raising the age limit for children's work.<br/>
South Carolina has passed a law reducing the<br/>
hours of labor. The age limit of these laws<br/>
is still low, but as public sentiment and the<br/>
school facilities grow the limit will be raised<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The mill tenements are better than they<br/>
used to be. The Whitney Mill at Spartanburg<br/>
is preparing to serve a good breakfast to its<br/>
employees for two cents apiece, because their<br/>
breakfasts are so ill-prepared at home. At<br/>
<br/>
another mill <span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span>per cent. interest is allowed on all<br/>
money left with the company treasurer more<br/>
than six months. In some places the <span style="color: #0000FF;">operatives </span>are beginning to save money. Many of<br/>
the people who work in the mill at Ramseur,<br/>
N. C., own their own homes, with gardens<br/>
about them. Some even own farms that they<br/>
rent and many have bank accounts. If people<br/>
come to work there who do not measure up<br/>
to the moral standards of the community, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>delegation from the mill will notify the owner<br/>
and he dismisses them. They live as well as<br/>
any people of small means in a small town.<br/>
Ramseur has been a mill town for two or three<br/>
generations. It goes its way now as any other<br/>
prosperous <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">industrious </span>manufacturing town.<br/>
It has no "problems." And the mill there<br/>
has better labor and more of it in proportion<br/>
than most of the mills in the South. <span style="color: #0000FF;">k </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
