</span>Orleans and worked <span style="color: #0000FF;">fora </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span>as a clerk. The<br/>
Bradstreet and Dun mercantile agencies assess<br/>
the value of his property at $ 20,000 to $ 25,000.<br/>
His neighbors say that he and his wife are<br/>
worth $ 50,000. W. T. Montgomery-who is<br/>
the postmaster, the brother of the founder, and<br/>
vice-president of the bank-is a man of <span style="color: #0000FF;">independent </span>means. He owned and conducted<br/>
for twelve years a farm of 640 acres near Fargo,<br/>
N. D., which he sold at the time of the rise in<br/>
Dakota lands at an advance of from $ 20 to $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s<br/>
</span>per acre over what he paid for it and invested<br/>
in other lands in the neighborhood of Winnipeg,<br/>
Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Among the directors of the bank are R. M.<br/>
McCarthy, who owns 450 acres of land in the<br/>
colony and runs a cotton gin. T. C. Jordan<br/>
has a bakery and meat market. He started<br/>
in the colony as a farmer. He is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>be worth something like $ 8,000 or $ 9,000.<br/>
J. Barker is the town marshal. C. R. Stringer<br/>
is treasurer of the town. H. A. Godbold,<br/>
who came into the settlement as a farmer<br/>
about 1895, runs a general store. The bank<br/>
and its directors, because they represent and<br/>
are so completely identified with the interests<br/>
of the town, have come to have the position of<br/>
a sort of chamber of commerce, guarding the<br/>
credit of the various enterprises and directing<br/>
and inspiring the economic and business<br/>
development of the colony.<br/>
<br/>
There are some special difficulties in the<br/>
financial direction and development of a town<br/>
and colony like Mound Bayou. For instance,<br/>
it has been the constant aim of the men who<br/>
founded the colony to preserve it as a distinctively Negro enterprise. Separated from,<br/>
yet intimately bound up with the commercial<br/>
and political interests of the other communities<br/>
about it, the problem of preserving this <span style="color: #0000FF;">isolation </span>has often been a perplexing one. A difficulty arose a few years ago when the Louisville, New Orleans, and Texas Railway was<br/>
sold to the Yazoo and Mississippi. Practically<br/>
all the lands purchased from the railroad<br/>
company had been subject to a lien for deferred<br/>
payments. With the change of ownership in<br/>
the railroad, a wholesale foreclosure of these<br/>
mortgages seemed imminent. Charles Banks<br/>
and his associates in the bank managed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, to have the loans renewed and upon terms<br/>
by which the mortgages were to bear 6 per<br/>
cent. interest instead of 8 per cent.<br/>
<br/>
In time, all of the original purchase money<br/>
for these lands was paid, but many of the colon<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TOWN </span>OWNED BY NEGROES<br/>
<br/>
ists had borrowed money for improvements.<br/>
There was, therefore, a constant danger that<br/>
farmers who were not able to discharge the<br/>
mortgages when they came due would lose their<br/>
holdings. To provide against this, the Mound<br/>
Bayou Loan and Investment Company was<br/>
formed, with a capital stock of $ 50,000. W.<br/>
T. Montgomery was made president of this<br/>
company and Charles Banks secretary and<br/>
treasurer. The plan of this company was to<br/>
sell stock to the farmers in the community.<br/>
The price of shares was fixed at $ 50, payable<br/>
in monthly instalments of one dollar. By<br/>
this means, a capital was secured to take over<br/>
the mortgages of those members of the community who were not able to pay the loans as<br/>
they fell due, and at the same time provide a<br/>
way by which the owners of the land might<br/>
accumulate a sum sufficient to pay off the<br/>
indebtedness for which the mortgage was issued.<br/>
It is expected that the capital accumulated<br/>
in this way will eventually be used to assist<br/>
settlers coming into the colony to acquire and<br/>
pay for lands, and in this way extend the holdings and the influence of the colony.<br/>
<br/>
THE TOWN<span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br/>
<br/>
Mound Bayou has been from the first, at<br/>
least in the minds of the men who founded it,<br/>
more than a business enterprise. As a matter<br/>
of fact, its most conspicuous success has been<br/>
its local government.<br/>
<br/>
The records of the mayor's court show that,<br/>
as Delta towns go, Mound Bayou is a remarkably quiet and sober place. There have been<br/>
but two homicides in twenty years. Both of<br/>
these were committed by strangers-men who<br/>
drifted into the community in the early days<br/>
before the local self-government and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traditions </span>of the town had been established. One<br/>
of the men killed was Benjamin T. Green, who<br/>
was the partner of Isaiah T. Montgomery in<br/>
the early days of the town. The man who<br/>
committed this crime was afterwards identified<br/>
as a fugitive from justice, who was wanted for<br/>
some desperate crime committed in the vicinity<br/>
of Mobile. The murder was the result of a<br/>
trivial altercation in regard to a box of tacks.<br/>
<br/>
During the whole twenty years of the town's<br/>
existence, only three persons have been sent to<br/>
the circuit court for trial. Two of these were<br/>
men convicted of theft. Since the town<br/>
obtained its charter in 1898, there have<br/>
been, up to February, 1907, but 163 criminal<br/>
cases tried in the town. Of these, fifty were<br/>
