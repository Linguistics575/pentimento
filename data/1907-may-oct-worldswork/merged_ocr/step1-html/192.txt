<span>THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
THE GREAT WORKING REVIVAL IN THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING CENTRE<br/>
OF THE UNITED STATES-A TYPICAL TOWN OF INTELLECTUAL INDUSTRIALISM<br/>

<br/>
twenty feet higher, a passenger <span style="color: #0000FF;">would<br/>
</span>hardly be out of sight <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>cotton mill<br/>
from the time he left Danville, Va., until he<br/>
reached Atlanta, Ga.--a distance of 400 miles.<br/>
It is one long mill village; and within the last<br/>
thirty years the part of the Carolinas and of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Georgia </span>known as the Piedmont region has<br/>
become one of the great cotton-manufacturing<br/>
districts of the world. And there are, of course,<br/>
many cotton mills, and some of the largest,<br/>
further South. This industry has caused a<br/>
rapid and dramatic transformation of the<br/>
people. To get a measure of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">transformation</span>, it seemed to me better to make a study<br/>
in detail of a mill community-a community<br/>
that owes its prosperity almost wholly to its<br/>
mills-than to make a general study of a wide<br/>
area. I selected the town of Spartanburg,<br/>
S. C.; but I might have selected any one of<br/>
dozens of other towns.<br/>
<br/>
The street from the station is paved with<br/>
vitrified brick and is scrupulously clean.<br/>
Almost the first buildings in sight are a large<br/>
public school and a public library. In the<br/>
centre of the main square is a statue to General<br/>
Morgan, the hero of the battle of the Cowpens.<br/>
There is one telephone for every eighteen<br/>
people in the town, including the Negroes and<br/>
mill "hands." On the corner of Wall Street<br/>
there is a United States Depository; within<br/>
sight there are six or seven other banks.<br/>
That 5,000 or 6,000 men and their families<br/>
should have built for themselves so well appointed a city seemed surprising. The president of one of the banks told me the reason:<br/>
<br/>
"Two things made it," he said, "smokestacks and education."<br/>
<br/>
The story of the smokestacks and of education in Spartanburg is an important chapter<br/>
in the second great emancipation of the South<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-the </span>commercial emancipation. In 1880,<br/>
it was a straggling town in a county of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>and not very prosperous farms. On<br/>
<br/>
the porches of the stores the loafers sat and<br/>
chewed tobacco. Two thousand dollars was<br/>
a large month's business for a merchant, and<br/>
even this was practically all credit. A man<br/>
who had lived there described the sidewalk<br/>
as a cowpath to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">courthouse</span>, and at times<br/>
the streets were so bad that once a mule was<br/>
said to have drowned in a mud-hole in one of<br/>
them. A little way from the main square was<br/>
an old man who could make baseball bats<br/>
and turn a top, and he was the principal<br/>
manufacturer.<br/>
<br/>
But two institutions were to change the COWpath to concrete and to make the village of<br/>
1880 the city of to-day. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Five </span>miles from town<br/>
Mr. D. E. Converse had a cotton mill, and at<br/>
the edge of town stood the old building of<br/>
Wofford College. Mr. Converse had found<br/>
work at some small job in a little cotton mill<br/>
in 1855. When the mill was reorganized the<br/>
next year, he received a share in it. Such was<br/>
the start in life of the man who is known as the<br/>
pioneer cotton manufacturer in South Carolina.<br/>
He operated the mill during the war for the<br/>
Confederate Government and contrived to<br/>
keep it going even during Reconstruction. As<br/>
the country grew quieter, his mill began to<br/>
make a profit and he determined to build<br/>
another. To raise the $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">200,000 </span>necessary<br/>
for the new mill was a difficult undertaking at<br/>
that place and time. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span>people believed in<br/>
the venture and, besides, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>money.<br/>
A man in South Carolina could get little <span style="color: #0000FF;">credit<br/>
</span>in the banking centres of the country and the<br/>
prevailing rates of interest were IO per cent.<br/>
and 12 per cent., even higher. Insurance on<br/>
Southern mills was fifteen times as costly as<br/>
it is now. It was thought, too, that the climate<br/>
was not adapted to cotton manufacturing, that<br/>
no labor could be found successfully to operate<br/>
the machinery, that the mills in Europe and in<br/>
other parts of the United States were so well<br/>
established that a mill in South Carolina could<br/>
not compete with them. But Mr. Converse<br/>
