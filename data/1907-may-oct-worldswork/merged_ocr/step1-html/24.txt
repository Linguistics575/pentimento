<br/>
engage his thoughts and his time-a farm, a<br/>
factory, a school, a craft, a family, his relation<br/>
to his neighbors, his duties to his community,<br/>
his enjoyment of an active and more or less<br/>
normal life. The big headlines in the newspapers do not startle him. A sudden shrinkage<br/>
of values from the level of a great inflation<br/>
does not disturb him, for he has few securities<br/>
or none. The reports of a sensational criminal<br/>
trial in court neither entertain him nor disturb<br/>
him as much as the conductors of the "yellow"<br/>
journals seem to think. He cannot be made<br/>
to believe that the railroad trains will cease to<br/>
run because the legislature reduced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">passenger </span>fare to two cents a mile, nor that<br/>
President Roosevelt is wrecking the country.<br/>
Most of the subjects that are loudly talked<br/>
about in the newspapers seem remote to the<br/>
Average American <span style="color: #ff0000;">Citizen. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>The daily press reports, and to a degree<br/>
creates, a sort of artificial life. The big men<br/>
in Wall Street are alarmed! The big men in<br/>
Washington are doing vast damage! <span style="color: #0000FF;">Presently </span>the women at Newport will be active<br/>
in great social affairs! But all these Great<br/>
Worlds are really remote from the everyday<br/>
thought of the millions of us who have little<br/>
power and much contentment with life that<br/>
moves in smaller orbits. We read the headlines and go on about our business.<br/>
<br/>
A great financier, a great statesman, a great<br/>
leader of fashion, or a great anybody else,<br/>
would be startled and perhaps humiliated to<br/>
learn how little we really know or care about<br/>
him. If such a Great Person should step<br/>
from a train at a town in Kansas or in Texas<br/>
or in Georgia-without the blare of greatness<br/>
-and were to live there for a time <span style="color: #0000FF;">incognito</span>,<br/>
he would discover that the condition of the<br/>
road to the next town is of greater importance<br/>
than the fluctuations of Union Pacific stock,<br/>
that the building of the new schoolhouse is<br/>
an event of importance to more persons than<br/>
the last report about anybody's Presidential<br/>
"boom"; that the "stand" of wheat or of<br/>
cotton is watched with much more concern<br/>
than the latest investigation of any trust; that<br/>
the latest marriage in Smithville is talked about<br/>
by as many good women as the latest ball in<br/>
Newport.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you be a Great Man or an Average<br/>
Man, it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>good exercise of your modesty to<br/>
go to Smithville, where nobody knows you,<br/>
and to make a study of life there by at least a<br/>
few days' observation in the town and in the<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
country about it. You may at first think life<br/>
there very dull; but, unless you are dull yourself, you are likely to come away reflecting on<br/>
the narrow range of your own thought and<br/>
on the number of purely artificial interests<br/>
that you burden yourself with. The normal<br/>
man carries few worries, and such as he does<br/>
carry are his own-not worries about far-off<br/>
problems or about gigantic forces or about<br/>
great battles in finance and politics and society.<br/>
Nor does he himself get into the newspapers.<br/>
Those that live in the artificial world of the<br/>
noisy journals often forget the Average Man<br/>
in his modest life, his quiet contentment, and his<br/>
steady industry. And, when the "great centres"<br/>
of these artificial industries become excited, it<br/>
is well to recall him; for if he is well, we are<br/>
well; and if he is happy and reasonably<br/>
prosperous, we shall all fare likewise; for he<br/>
is the United States, because he is one of the<br/>
millions-the millions who are the steady<br/>
base of our democracy.<br/>
<br/>
THE DANGER OF AN INDUSTRIAL SETBACK j<br/>
<br/>
EVERAL railroads have announced that<br/>
they think it expedient to stop new constructive work and to husband their money;<br/>
and this is one of the chief reasons of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">feeling </span>of uncertainty in the financial and industrial outlook. There are many other reasons,<br/>
but they lie deeper. We saw a setback to our<br/>
industry in 1903, but it amounted to little as<br/>
we view it in retrospect. It might have<br/>
amounted to much more had Europe not then<br/>
had funds a-plenty, and rushed them to our<br/>
assistance when the terms became good enough<br/>
to tempt them.<br/>
<br/>
At present, if a crisis should arise, Europe<br/>
could hardly help us, because Europe itself is<br/>
in need of more money. There is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarcity<br/>
</span>both here and abroad. A crisis would, therefore, test our own strength far beyond the<br/>
test of 1903. The situation to-day is much<br/>
more like the situation in 1892, which was<br/>
followed by the disasters of 1893.<br/>
<br/>
Let us balance the threatening features<br/>
against the steadying influences, seeking to<br/>
measure the situation as it stands. Primarily,<br/>
we are short of funds. The New York banks,<br/>
upon whom the stock-market burden falls<br/>
most heavily, have allowed their surplus<br/>
practically to disappear, and have been compelled to use the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">drastic </span>means to strengthen it. All over the country, the demand for<br/>
money has been urgent for the last six months<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
