SENATOR JOSEPH B. <span style="color: #ff0000;">FORAKER<br/>
<br/>
</span>While Governor <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Ohio he appointed young <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>as Judge of the<br/>
Superior Court <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Ohio, an honor unsolicited and unexpected<br/>
<br/>
Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s success and the quality of what some<br/>
men call his genius, one must remember his<br/>
untiring apprenticeship; and remember, above<br/>
all, that this apprenticeship has never ceased.<br/>
<br/>
During those arduous days he was as serene<br/>
and jovial as always, with time enough, somehow, to be the man and brother. He loved<br/>
Cincinnati for its social ideals, "where wealth<br/>
is valued less for the vulgar display it affords<br/>
and more for the opportunity it grants to do<br/>
good to one's fellow-man." He moved, as of<br/>
right, in the best circle there, and he was as<br/>
popular with women as with men; but in all<br/>
circles he was-first and most of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all-democratic</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In one of his recent lectures at Yale, he<br/>
virtually describes his own activities during<br/>
these earlier years:<br/>
<br/>
"The graduate," he said, "will spend as much time as<br/>
he can in learning the local situation, in becoming<br/>
acquainted with the precinct and ward leaders, in consulting them as far as he can, in making himself acquainted<br/>
not only with the well-to-do and well-educated persons in<br/>
his precinct and ward, but also with the laborers, the<br/>
artisans, the store-keepers, the saloon-keepers, in order that<br/>
he may understand the controlling influences in the primaries and elections of that precinct and ward."<br/>
<br/>
Secretary Taft grants that this may mean<br/>
contact with undesirable associates, but he has<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"BOSS" GEORGE B. COX<br/>
<br/>
Although he was young <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">political </span>adversary, he supported him<br/>
at the only time he has ever been a candidate for a public office<br/>
<br/>
a good word to say even for the saloon-keepers,<br/>
pointing out that many of them are honest and<br/>
hard working, and that they help to influence<br/>
opinion among wage-earners. The young<br/>
graduate, he insists, must convince those he<br/>
hopes to control for good purposes that he does<br/>
not hold himself above them. On the other<br/>
hand, he has as much to learn from them as<br/>
they can learn from him, because through<br/>
them alone can he hope to understand the<br/>
motives and real feelings of the great mass of<br/>
the American people. He vigorously condemns the "scholar in politics," and urges<br/>
these to learn by contact "the real needs of<br/>
their less fortunate fellow-citizens."<br/>
<br/>
His own contact has always been genuine<br/>
enough. It went, on occasion, even to that<br/>
of his boulder-like fist. There was no gainsaying the big youth's prestige after he had<br/>
"thrashed" a thug-heeler or two. In primary<br/>
or convention, he was again the "Bull" Taft<br/>
of the college rushes, charging every obstacle<br/>
in his path. Old Judge Taft had recently<br/>
been defeated for Governor, and young Taft<br/>
was indignant. Politicians had traded off his<br/>
father coldly, cynically, like a chattel, so that<br/>
the boy's very first touch of practical politics<br/>
had left a sting. He was in no amiable mood,<br/>
then, when the Mt. Auburn citizens, his<br/>
