<span>THE COMING <span style="color: #0000FF;">AIR-SHIP-A </span>SUGGESTION<br/>
<br/>
Hay during his last years of diplomatic work<br/>
and by Secretary Taft in his dealings with our<br/>
Asiatic dependencies. This is to say that there<br/>
will be a larger demand in the future for<br/>
American <span style="color: #0000FF;">statesmanship </span>of this calibre and<br/>
quality than there has ever before been.<br/>
<br/>
OUR REFUSAL T0 PLUNDER CHINA<br/>
<br/>
IN A COMMENDABLE spirit of fairness<br/>
<br/>
and generosity, the Administration has<br/>
revised the indemnity figures that represent<br/>
the debt of China to the United States as a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>sult of the Boxer troubles. Under the protocol, signed on September 7, 1901, China agreed<br/>
to pay to the United States, in forty years,<br/>
$ 24,440,000 and interest at the rate of 4 per<br/>
cent. The Administration has agreed to<br/>
remit this debt on the payment of $ 11,055, <span style="color: #0000FF;">000</span>, of which $ 6,000,000 has already been<br/>
paid.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this administrative act, since it<br/>
alters the terms of settlement established by a<br/>
treaty agreement, must be ratified by Congress<br/>
before it goes into effect. Since it is admitted<br/>
by the Government that the revised figures<br/>
cover all the actual cost to this country<br/>
through the Boxer outbreak, Congress cannot<br/>
very well afford to refuse to ratify the amendment. A failure to do so would amount to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">aconfession </span>that this country desires money<br/>
more than it desires a reputation for common<br/>
honesty.<br/>
<br/>
The important and interesting phase of the<br/>
matter is the fact that the revision throws more<br/>
than a reasonable doubt upon all the awards<br/>
made under that protocol. If the United<br/>
States award was unjust, or, as Mr. Root gently<br/>
calls it "a maximum," what of the Russian<br/>
award of $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">87,300,000</span>, the German award of<br/>
$ 60,000,000, the F rench award of $ 56,000,000?<br/>
The plain truth is, that China was, one might<br/>
say, sand-bagged by the Christian Powers<br/>
in 1901, as weak nations have generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">been<br/>
</span>The United States alone, so far, has recorded<br/>
a refusal to keep the plunder. This is not so<br/>
much a credit to us as it is a discredit to the<br/>
other governments.<br/>
<br/>
But there is no doubt that such an act of<br/>
friendliness will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>its echo in our commercial<br/>
balance sheets. And with China, in particular,<br/>
we need all the good-will that we can create.<br/>
It is too soon to forget the Chinese boycott.<br/>
No step that could be taken could do more to<br/>
reestablish the friendly trade relations that<br/>
so lately were disturbed.<br/>

AMERICAN AND BRITISH CONCENTRATION OF<br/>
WEALTH<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>concentration of a large part of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>wealth of the United States in the hands<br/>
of a few men is one of the disquieting facts of<br/>
our era of great organization. But, far as this<br/>
concentration has gone in our country, it is<br/>
not comparable to the concentration of the<br/>
sources of wealth and of financial power under<br/>
the older class-governments of Europe.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a writer in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Contemporary<br/>
</span>Review estimates, from the receipts of the<br/>
income-tax and from similar data that "about<br/>
95 per cent. of the entire wealth of the United<br/>
Kingdom is owned by about <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-ninth </span>of its<br/>
population." He estimates<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that about 200,000<br/>
or at most 250,000 families own nearly the<br/>
whole of the accumulated wealth of the kingdom; and he adds:<br/>
<br/>
"This small group of people exercises the effective<br/>
government of the nation by its control of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">means </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>production. The'Government' <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>impotent because, like the mass of our people, it has little<br/>
or no property. The'investments' of the State, like <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'investments</span>' of the masses, form a negligible quantity<br/>
And those rule who own."<br/>
<br/>
All such statistics are avowed estimates, but<br/>
after a liberal allowance has been made <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>error, the fact of a tremendous concentration<br/>
remains.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States there are two great<br/>
forces that make for the distribution of wealth-our vast productive agricultural area which<br/>
permits (even compels) the ownership of the<br/>
land by the masses, and the prohibition of<br/>
entail. Concentration has come in our country<br/>
chiefly by reason of industrial organization<br/>
and the organization of transportation; and<br/>
upon this problem we are surely making some<br/>
interesting experiments.<br/>
<br/>
THE COMING AIR-SHIP-A <span style="color: #ff0000;">SUGGESTION<br/>
<br/>
</span>HE world is still eagerly waiting for a<br/>
successful <span style="color: #0000FF;">flying </span>machine. Although<br/>
much has been done in an experimental way<br/>
and short flights have been accomplished, we<br/>
still fall short of success. The best of the flying<br/>
machines and dirigible balloons constructed<br/>
to date have been hardly more than scientific<br/>
toys.<br/>
<br/>
With appreciation of the efforts and results<br/>
of the experimenters, it must be said that they<br/>
have been trying to fly through the air with<br/>
the fins and tail and by the motions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fish<br/>
<br/>
