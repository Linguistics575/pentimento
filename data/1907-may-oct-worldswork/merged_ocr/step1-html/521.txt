</span>cent. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>tablespoonful of tomato ketchup,<br/>
one would <span style="color: #ff0000;">eat </span>0.16 of a grain. From I to 10<br/>
grains of benzoic acid are eliminated through<br/>
the kidneys every day by human beings, largely<br/>
in the form of hippuric acid. One grain of<br/>
benzoic acid in a "helping" of a given food is<br/>
safe and harmless-but suppose we get it in<br/>
a dozen foods at one meal?<br/>
<br/>
A CATALOGUE OF FOOD INIQUITIES<br/>
<br/>
The following examples show the most<br/>
common substitutes, adulterants, and preservatives employed:<br/>
<br/>
Jams and Jellies. Adulterants: Apple juice<br/>
is the "stock" for all the jellies and jams.<br/>
It is mixed with "commercial glucose" (not<br/>
unhealthful), flavored with an artificial essence,<br/>
and colored with a synthetic dye or cochineal.<br/>
Gelatine is often used to "<span style="color: #0000FF;">icll</span>" the mixture;<br/>
also a "coagulator" of citric or tartaric acid.<br/>
About 10 per cent. of jellies and jams on the<br/>
market are pure.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ketchups</span>. Adulterants: Skins and refuse of<br/>
canning factories (cheap, but not necessarily<br/>
unhealthy); sometimes fermented, when <span style="color: #0000FF;">salicylic </span>or benzoic acid becomes needed. A bad<br/>
article. Colorings: Standard ketchup should<br/>
be dull, partially bleached red. Aniline dyes<br/>
or cochineal are used in more than 80 per cent.<br/>
The bright magenta stuff should be refused.<br/>
<br/>
Milk. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adulterant</span>: Water. Belief in the<br/>
use of starch, chalk, glycerin, etc., may be<br/>
discarded. Skimming, and both skimming<br/>
and watering, are frequent. Coloring and<br/>
preserving: Skimmed and watered milk is<br/>
given a rich, creamy appearance by adding<br/>
annatto, azo-colors, or caramel. Formaldehyde, boric acid, borax, and sodium bicarbonate<br/>
are used to check or conceal fermentation.<br/>
<br/>
Butter. Adulterants: Coloring <span style="color: #ff0000;">mattercarrot </span>juice, annatto, turmeric, azo, or coal-tar<br/>
colors. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uncolored </span>natural butter is best, and<br/>
artificially colored butter should be rejected.<br/>
Renovated butter is made from rancid material;<br/>
it is water-heated to remove the curd, brine<br/>
and scum; then it is air-blown to drive off the<br/>
bad odors, mixed with milk (often skimmed<br/>
milk), "ripened," worked, salted, and packed.<br/>
<br/>
Oleomargarine, or butterine, is made from<br/>
oleo oil as the main base, and variously mixed<br/>
with neutral lard, milk, genuine butter, coloring matter, and small amounts of cottonseed,<br/>
peanut, or sesame oil. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oleo </span>oil comes from<br/>
beef fat, lining the intestine and "caul," a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">finc</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">pure </span>article, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lashed</span>, melted, and pressed.<br/>
<br/>
9319<br/>
<br/>
The oil then contains stearine, from which it<br/>
is strained. Adulterants<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>Not likely, but fat<br/>
from diseased animals may be used. Standard oleomargarine is as healthful and nutritious as pure butter, and better than renovated butter.<br/>
It is always colored.<br/>
<br/>
Detection: Pure butter boils quietly in a<br/>
spoon; renovated butter and <span style="color: #0000FF;">butterine </span>sputter.<br/>
<br/>
CONFLICTING LAWS ABOUT FOODS<br/>
<br/>
To secure food safety, there should first be<br/>
a national standard to arbitrarily state what is<br/>
wholesome and what is not; second, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">final<br/>
</span>buyer should know exactly what he is<br/>
purchasing.<br/>
<br/>
There is at present no standard authority<br/>
on foods. The so-called "Pure Food Law"<br/>
makes the United States Pharmacopoeia the<br/>
standard authority for all drugs. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">pharmacopoeia </span>may have errors of omission, or of<br/>
commission; but it is the safest possible <span style="color: #0000FF;">authority</span>. It is the consensus of our national drug<br/>
knowledge, constantly undergoing elimination<br/>
and addition with further experience. There<br/>
is no such standard for foods. What is good<br/>
food at Crossroads Corners may be outlawed<br/>
across the border. Michigan says "X" strawberry jam shall be labeled "imitation";<br/>
Wisconsin says it shall be labeled "glucose<br/>
preserves"; Minnesota says it shall be labeled<br/>
"imitation preserves, mixture adulterated."<br/>
If any of the jam labeled <span style="color: #0000FF;">in'Minnesota </span>got<br/>
across the Duluth bridge into Wisconsin it was<br/>
outlawed; and if the Wisconsin jam slipped<br/>
over into Duluth, it went legally bad. When<br/>
a manufacturer put the labels of all three states<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peripatetic </span>cans, they were all thrown<br/>
out. And one of these labels gave the exact<br/>
formula of the jam: Apples, 15 per cent.;<br/>
granulated sugar, 45 per cent., and "fruit" as<br/>
indicated.<br/>
<br/>
It is more difficult to determine the values<br/>
of foods than of drugs. The use of preservatives is rapidly extending, for it is cheaper to<br/>
preserve than to pasteurize, and foods can be<br/>
sent further. But while <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-tenth </span>of one per<br/>
cent. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">benzoic </span>acid with one article of food<br/>
may be absolutely harmless, if the drug is put<br/>
into a number of foods we may get an overdose<br/>
at a single meal. Yet it may be wiser to use<br/>
preservatives in some foods than to run risks<br/>
of ptomaine poisoning, but the use of preservatives should be limited by necessity. Some<br/>
coal-tar products which will color or flavor<br/>
