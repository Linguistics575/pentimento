<span>WHAT FRANCE<br/>
<br/>
they can let the air into their houses far more<br/>
freely than we can. The French windows,<br/>
opening like double doors, allow the removal of<br/>
the whole sash from the window frame, whereas<br/>
ours, sliding up and down, leave half the space<br/>
constantly closed.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it is when you come to the table that you<br/>
find the most significant contrast between<br/>
French household ways and those at home.<br/>
Not only does France know how to cook, it<br/>
knows how to eat<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It takes its time, serves<br/>
a meal in several courses, never loads its plate<br/>
to the discouragement of appetite, and regards<br/>
a luncheon or a dinner as a festal occasion,<br/>
thereby facilitating digestion and promoting<br/>
sociability. Incidentally, things taste better,<br/>
brought on so daintily.<br/>
<br/>
On this latter point, however, a single remark is worth insisting upon. The striking<br/>
difference between American and <span style="color: #0000FF;">French<br/>
</span>manners is not that the French people are<br/>
more polite, but that so many more French<br/>
people are polite. A hotel clerk receives you<br/>
as an honored guest and personally shows you<br/>
to your room. A shop-keeper inquires solicitously for your health. Your laundress's manner is grace and dignity and sweetness combined.<br/>
If you go to the great markets at four in the<br/>
morning, when unspeakably rough-looking<br/>
men and women are getting their wares into<br/>
shape for the day and immense loads of beef<br/>
and vegetables and fish are being moved through<br/>
the jostling throng of market folk, you will<br/>
hear only such cries as "Take care, <span style="color: #ff0000;">monsieurl</span>"<br/>
or "Please let me pass, <span style="color: #0000FF;">madame</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>" Think<br/>
what you would hear in an American crowd<br/>
of that grade!<br/>
<br/>
And soon you discover that you can be polite<br/>
to servants without spoiling them. For service, among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French</span>, is recognized as a fine<br/>
art. A waiter, for instance, does not blush<br/>
for his calling; he does not assert his quality<br/>
by abusing you or refuse deference till bullied<br/>
into yielding it. He glories in serving you<br/>
exquisitely, and the more sweetly you receive<br/>
his attentions the more graciously he bestows<br/>
them. It never enters his head that service<br/>
degrades. How, pray, should one member<br/>
of a democratic community think his honor<br/>
tarnished by performing kindly offices kindly<br/>
for another member of that community and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">gaining </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>just recompense? We talk a lot about<br/>
democracy over here, but there is more of real<br/>
democracy in a square mile of France than in<br/>
a thousand square miles of the United States.<br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, Frenchmen do not stand<br/>
in undue awe of their fellows. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hey </span>are less<br/>
afraid than we are of "Mrs. Grundy." They<br/>
do as they like, regardless who is looking, and<br/>
have even courage to show their feelings and<br/>
to follow impulse without a qualm. Hence<br/>
their incomparable genius for holiday making.<br/>
The trouble with our holiday <span style="color: #0000FF;">frolics </span>is not lack<br/>
of gaiety; it is our terror lest somebody will<br/>
see us stand on our heads and think the less<br/>
of us. We are not "solemn asses," but we<br/>
pretend to be, on the curious theory that to<br/>
get mistaken for cold, lifeless, unfeeling clods<br/>
will win us admiration! Perhaps the French<br/>
go too far in the opposite direction, and yet<br/>
a little more disregard for the onlooker would<br/>
improve us mightily.<br/>
<br/>
The French have doubtless derived this<br/>
charming independence from the life of the<br/>
café. When two hundred people sit together<br/>
in the open air, chatting, sipping "<span style="color: #0000FF;">bucks</span>,"<br/>
playing cards, writing letters, smoking, reading<br/>
newspapers, or merely idling, they get used to<br/>
being watched. At the same time, they learn<br/>
a jolly sociability, which is not without its<br/>
moral value, since it makes for friendliness<br/>
and something very like democracy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you will think I have strayed a<br/>
long way from the subject of art when I make<br/>
it admit the holiday and the café, but really<br/>
these and the other aspects of French life we<br/>
have been speaking of show how persistently<br/>
the French require that whatever they set<br/>
their hands to shall have the touch of thoughtfulness, taste, and perfect adjustment to human<br/>
needs, of whatever degree or whatever sort.<br/>
They have made life itself an art-yes, a fine<br/>
art.<br/>
<br/>
And as for the arts distinctively "fine,"<br/>
who, think you, presides over their affairs?<br/>
A Cabinet Officer. No less a dignitary governs the great museums, the opera, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conservatory </span>of music, and the drama, the preservation of public monuments, and the restoration<br/>
of palaces, cathedrals, and castles. It is just<br/>
as Consul-General Mason said: artistic taste<br/>
has been fostered by governmental influence<br/>
until it has become a national attribute.<br/>
Technical schools leave their stamp of elegance<br/>
upon French manufactures. Works of art,<br/>
acquired by the state, fill galleries to <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflowing </span>and adorn parks frequented by the<br/>
very working people. Minor cities have their<br/>
treasure houses of beauty. Everywhere extends the influence that makes the Frenchman<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
