</span>The national Pure Food Law is a fairly<br/>
complete enactment. It marks a vast <span style="color: #0000FF;">improvement </span>over previous conditions. But it<br/>
should require all labels to give the date of<br/>
manufacture, because age deteriorates quality<br/>
in some cases and, in the case of canned goods,<br/>
may cause unhealthy acid solution of metals.<br/>
The public right to desirable knowledge overrides all commercial interest.<br/>
<br/>
Trade-mark or proprietary <span style="color: #0000FF;">labels </span>which<br/>
do not inform the buyer of the materials should<br/>
name the ingredients, if not the proportions.<br/>
Such labeling as "compound," "mixture,"<br/>
and "fruit," are not fairly explicit, even though<br/>
the Government has private information that<br/>

<br/>
</span>the articles are harmless. It would be better<br/>
in the long run, for manufacturers to use labels<br/>
more explicit than "premium," "standard,"<br/>
etc. Let the people know just what they are<br/>
buying, and they will pay for what they want<br/>
and pay what it is worth. It will of course<br/>
take time, but this result will eventually be<br/>
achieved.<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate value of the national food law<br/>
depends upon the wisdom of the Bureau of<br/>
Chemistry, which body must arbitrarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">become </span>food gods, determining what is good and<br/>
what is <span style="color: #0000FF;">bad </span>We may safely assume that<br/>
present problems will be worked out in the<br/>
interest of the consumer.<br/>

RUNNING A RIVER THROUGH A<br/>
MOUNTAIN<br/>
<br/>
THE SIX-MILE GUNNISON TUNNEL <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>COLORADO AS AN<br/>
EXAMPLE OF THE RECLAMATION WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT<br/>
<br/>
BY<br/>
ARTHUR W. PAGE<br/>
<br/>
I I <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>great series of works to irrigate the<br/>
dry lands of the West, which are in<br/>
progress under the provisions of the<br/>
<br/>
Reclamation Act, mark a distinct chapter in<br/>
our history. The magnitude of this work is<br/>
hardly appreciated outside of governmental<br/>
and engineering circles. I send the following<br/>
description of the Gunnison tunnel, merely as<br/>
one picturesque example of what the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government </span>is doing.<br/>
<br/>
In the southwestern part of Colorado the<br/>
Gunnison River flows through a steep-walled<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">caiion</span>. Twenty miles away the Uncompahgre<br/>
River runs slowly through a sage-brush desert,<br/>
but it is so small a stream that it will irrigate<br/>
less than half of its valley. The United States<br/>
<br/>
"Reclamation Service is doing an interesting<br/>
piece of work to divert water from the Gunnison<br/>
into the Uncompahgre in spite of the fact that<br/>
there is a mountain range between them. It<br/>
is cutting a six-mile tunnel through the base<br/>
<br/>
of the mountain-a distance of an hour and a<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">half</span>'s walk at a good fast pace-blasting it out<br/>
<br/>
of rock foot by foot.<br/>
<br/>
Two miles and a half in the mountain from<br/>
the Uncompahgre side are about <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>men<br/>
<br/>
with three drills working in the rock. Two<br/>
steel pipes, about a foot in diameter, lead from<br/>
a shaft to the head of the tunnel, one pumping<br/>
in fresh air and the other sucking out foul air.<br/>
An electric train hauls out the rock as it is<br/>
excavated, down the long wet tunnel lighted<br/>
here and there by electric lights. But near<br/>
the western portal is the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lujane </span>with<br/>
its power plant, machine shop, bunkhouses,<br/>
mess rooms, hospital, and 350 busy men, from<br/>
the engineer <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the cook, for these two are<br/>
the most important men in camp. The work<br/>
of all these can be expressed only by the<br/>
number of feet a day that the men in the heading remove. If something happens so that they<br/>
cannot work, the expense goes on unlessened,<br/>
nor can the work be hastened by increasing the<br/>
number of men, for there is not room for more<br/>
to work. On the efficiency of a few <span style="color: #ff0000;">daylaborers </span>the progress of the whole work depends.<br/>
<br/>
Six years ago a topographic survey was <span style="color: #ff0000;">made<br/>
</span>of the Gunnison region. Mr. A. L. Fellows<br/>
went down the lower end of the cation in a<br/>
boat and surveyed the river. His boat upset.<br/>
Some of his instruments were lost, but he kept<br/>
his records and reported that a tunnel <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
