<span>TAFT<span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>because, when he fell, he always fell on his<br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
He used to throw himself heart and soul<br/>
into any sport that was on. He liked to go in<br/>
swimming, and was a great fellow to play<br/>
marbles. In those days one had to "knuckle<br/>
down," and a patch of rabbit fur was laid on<br/>
the ground as a sort of gun-carriage for the<br/>
hand. But "Bill" and his partner started the<br/>
custom of aiming the "taw" while standing<br/>
up, and thus "Plumping" at the target marbles.<br/>
He grew very expert at this, and several<br/>
eminent members of the Cincinnati bar can<br/>
vouch for it that "Bill certainly did skin us."<br/>
<br/>
YOUNG <span style="color: #0000FF;">TAFT</span>'S PHYSIQUE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Very'early </span>in life, even while he was in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Woodward </span>High School, Taft began to emerge<br/>
from his chubby state and solidify into powerful and agile proportions<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>chums somehow left off calling him "<span style="color: #ff0000;">LU</span>." "Old Bill"<br/>
seemed to describe him better, or at least their<br/>
own affection for him; <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>thereafter, in the<br/>
college, on the Bench, in the President's<br/>
Cabinet, he has always been "Old Bill" to<br/>
those early, loyal friends.<br/>
<br/>
They will tell you that he was never very<br/>
active on his feet, and therefore rather too<br/>
heavy for baseball. "But he would make <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>stab at it. He had the pluck, all right." On<br/>
the other hand, he was a formidable proposition at wrestling, and while his enormous<br/>
natural strength made him equally so at boxing,<br/>
he had not great skill. One of the boys in the<br/>
block remembers hitting him once when his<br/>
feet were together; "and then," says this old<br/>
chum, "Bill toppled over backward like <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>marble statue."<br/>
<br/>
As to young Taft's physique, here is another<br/>
story of the time of his early manhood. Early<br/>
one evening Judge Taft saw two or three of the<br/>
Mt. Auburn boys, then young men, coming<br/>
past the house; he went out, stopped them,<br/>
and began chatting. They were evidently<br/>
going somewhere, and their manner impelled<br/>
the shrewd old Judge to ask where. They<br/>
knew him to be almost austere in his conduct,<br/>
but they admitted that they were going to see<br/>
Muldoon wrestle. It was the match, by the<br/>
way, that made Muldoon the world's champion.<br/>
The Judge talked gently to the boys, asking<br/>
them if they did not think the theatre where<br/>
they were going was an improper place. They<br/>
explained that they had no idea of seeing the<br/>
performance, but wanted only to see the wrest<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9141<br/>
<br/>
</span>ling match. At that the Judge's eyes glowed,<br/>
and there was longing in his voice. "Wait,<br/>
boys," he said, "until I get on my shoes. Do<br/>
you know, I like those trials of strength, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I'd<br/>
</span>like to go along with you." But the Judge<br/>
did not go. Mrs. Taft probably kept him.<br/>
<br/>
A VISIT FROM JOHN L. SULLIVAN<br/>
<br/>
At another time, the champion, John L.<br/>
Sullivan, was in town, and Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>sent for<br/>
him. The Judge was a prominent man, and<br/>
the pugilist came gladly <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>his office. Judge<br/>
Taft apologized for his odd request, and said<br/>
that he had heard so much of John L., and that<br/>
he was interested in big physical men. Would<br/>
Mr. Sullivan have the kindness to step into<br/>
the Judge's private office for inspection? Mr.<br/>
Sullivan would, and did so. The Judge,<br/>
himself magnificently built, felt over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">champion </span>in a sort of awe, as a connoisseur before<br/>
an overpowering work of art. At last he<br/>
exclaimed:<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Well</span>, sir, you are surely a marvelous<br/>
specimen!" And then he added, "But let<br/>
me tell you, sir, I wanted you up here to decide<br/>
if you're a better put-up man than my son<br/>
Will."<br/>
<br/>
"Well?" queried Sullivan, grinning.<br/>
<br/>
"Well," said the Judge, "you'll have to<br/>
pardon me, sir, but you are not. My Will is<br/>
the better <span style="color: #ff0000;">man </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">y</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It is interesting to know, in this connection,<br/>
that Sullivan and Will Taft met in later years,<br/>
when one was only an ex-warrior and the<br/>
other was Secretary of War. But to quote<br/>
from the newspaper correspondent who saw it:<br/>
<br/>
As John L. sat in a chair waiting for his arrival to be<br/>
announced to the President, Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>walked out<br/>
of the executive offices. John L. saw him.<br/>
<br/>
"There goes the real goods!" said John L., "a genuine<br/>
heavyweight. I want to meet him."<br/>
<br/>
While a newspaper man stopped Secretary Taft, another<br/>
beckoned John L. to come forward. With the grace that<br/>
he always showed in the ring, John L. passed out his<br/>
famous right and caught the Secretary full in the palm of<br/>
the hand. But Secretary Taft didn't even stagger. He<br/>
looked John L. square in the face and welcomed him.<br/>
<br/>
"How much do you weigh, Mr. Sullivan?" asked<br/>
Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, I'm a lightweight," said Sullivan. "But I<br/>
expect I have got you skinned about a block"; and the<br/>
former pugilist confessed that he weighed 330 pounds,<br/>
while Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">admitted </span>close around 280.<br/>
<br/>
A photographer, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whese </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">outfit </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">standing </span>outside,<br/>
waiting for a permit from Secretary Loeb to take some<br/>
pictures, nearly had a fit because his permit had not<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
