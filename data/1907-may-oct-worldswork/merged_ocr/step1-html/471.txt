<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Federal </span>Government against the Ameri<br/>
can Tobacco Company and its subsidiary<br/>
corporations, if other <span style="color: #0000FF;">means </span>of preventing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">restraint </span>of trade fail the court is asked to<br/>
"appoint receivers to take possession of all the<br/>
assets of the various companies, and, if <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary</span>, to wind them up.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>This newly proposed weapon to prevent<br/>
trusts from restraining <span style="color: #0000FF;">trade-the </span>weapon of<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">receivership-is</span>, of course, yet to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">tried</span>.<br/>
The court has not, when this is written, allowed its use; and <span style="color: #ff0000;">no- </span>such new attack can be<br/>
effectively made until the Supreme Court of<br/>
the United States shall pass judgment on it;<br/>
and it is not yet by any means certain that such<br/>
a case will ever be brought before that court.<br/>
On the soundness of this method of procedure,<br/>
of course the courts themselves must pass. It<br/>
may conceivably be a perfectly sound method<br/>
of punishing combinations in restraint of trade,<br/>
for the attorneys for the Government are <span style="color: #0000FF;">law-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yers </span>of repute and experience. But the <span style="color: #0000FF;">choice<br/>
</span>of methods of legal procedure and even the<br/>
decisions of courts are affected <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the public<br/>
mood; and the proposal of such <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plan </span>has had<br/>
a singular <span style="color: #ff0000;">effect </span>on public discussion and<br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The whole commercial world firmly holds<br/>
to the usual conception of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">receivership</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-as<br/>
</span>a method of dealing with a business that has<br/>
failed. The proposal to use it as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>punishment is a new conception to the lay mind; and<br/>
the proposal to use it as a punishment for<br/>
"success" (financial <span style="color: #0000FF;">success </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">least</span>) seems<br/>
to a large part of the business <span style="color: #0000FF;">community</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>either fantastic or fanatical.<br/>
<br/>
IN THE bill of complaint made by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">COP </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">right</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">m7</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">» </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">»</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Parte </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">F</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Such <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>judgment may be utterly erroneous;<br/>
but it has been taken by the financial and<br/>
political enemies and victims of the Administration as an occasion to decry the President<br/>
and his policy of corporation-regulation. Another such excuse is the extreme length to which<br/>
some of the states have gone in enacting and in<br/>
enforcing (for the time being) absurd <span style="color: #0000FF;">regulative<br/>
</span>statutes which will not stand the test of the<br/>
courts. "The whole movement has gone too<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">far</span>!" "You see the inevitable result!" Such<br/>
remarks as these are more frequently heard<br/>
than at any time since Mr. Roosevelt became<br/>
President. The opposition to the regulation<br/>
of corporations hopes that a tide of public<br/>
opinion is turning in their favor.<br/>
<br/>
Hardly. And now appears one of many<br/>
good results of Mr. Roosevelt's taking himself<br/>
out of the next Presidential contest. If he<br/>
were a candidate now, or if he could accept a<br/>
renomination, the discussion of this central<br/>
subject of the regulation of corporations might<br/>
possibly be shunted off the main track of the<br/>
public thought. It might be labeled "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Roose<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">vcltism-personar</span>"; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>least an effort<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>be made to have it regarded as a merely<br/>
personal policy. Mr. Roosevelt does deserve<br/>
the personal <span style="color: #0000FF;">credit </span>for making it the dominant<br/>
subject of politics; but it is not <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>merely <span style="color: #0000FF;">personal </span>contention. There is a great principle<br/>
involved. The people have laid hold on it,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">absurd </span>efforts to apply it will not loosen<br/>
their hold.<br/>
<br/>
The service that the President has done is<br/>
clear to men who think beyond to-morrow and<br/>
back of yesterday. Six <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seven </span>years ago the<br/>
great corporations almost openly <span style="color: #ff0000;">ctmtrolled<br/>
