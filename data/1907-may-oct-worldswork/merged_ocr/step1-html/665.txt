<span>THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA<br/>
<br/>
without pay. It was but natural that this state<br/>
of affairs, continuing throughout many generations, should bring the native to a point where<br/>
he demanded his pay in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Prepayment for labor was, of course, out of<br/>
accord with modern methods, but ingenuity<br/>
solved the problem. A box of brass checks,<br/>
like those <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonlyused </span>in factories, was found<br/>
and every native went to work with a check<br/>
hung about his neck. The natives were told<br/>
that this new money must be kept until payday, when it would be changed into dollars.<br/>
After a few weeks had gone by the Filipinos<br/>
realized that the checks had no real value,<br/>
but that the American firm was treating them<br/>
fairly; then they became reconciled to the<br/>
ordinary system and it has continued in force.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as it was understood that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Americans </span>were honest, contractors in and about<br/>
the larger cities had no trouble in securing<br/>
labor in sufficient quantity. But another<br/>
difficulty arose-one more or less common to<br/>
all tropical and Latin countries. There are<br/>
only about four months in the year when work<br/>
of any consequence can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplished-January</span>, February, March, and May. During<br/>
the rainy season construction work in the<br/>
country is out of the question, for even the roads<br/>
are impassable. Throughout other parts of<br/>
the year frequent saints' days and festas<br/>
depopulate the camps. It is probable, how..<br/>
ever, that these festas will be blotted from the<br/>
calendar one by one until only the more important feast days remain.<br/>
<br/>
But the native likes to gamble, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cockfight </span>and pony-race wring from him the last<br/>
cent of a week's pay. If he is lucky in his<br/>
gaming, he will probably buy a pen of birds,<br/>
and then he is supremely happy. When he<br/>
travels, he may leave his family at home but a<br/>
bird is tucked under his arm; this queer pair<br/>
is a common sight on the railroads of northern<br/>
Luzon and on the electric lines of Manila.<br/>
The Filipino is especially fond of music and<br/>
gaiety, but he is devoted to his home and<br/>
family. Although not naturally fond of work,<br/>
he is willing to work for good food and pleasant<br/>
surroundings. Money is not an object to him,<br/>
but a little is necessary to enable him to pay<br/>
taxes and gamble. In some parts of the<br/>
Islands coins are used only as ornaments, and<br/>
labor can often be paid for with trinkets. A<br/>
shirt of army pattern constitutes a full suit of<br/>
clothing for a native and often becomes his<br/>
most prized possession. A blanket satisfies<br/>
<br/>
IN THE PHILIPPINES 9463<br/>
the longing of a lifetime, and an old derby or<br/>
silk hat marks the owner as a man of affairs.<br/>
<br/>
In the time that has elapsed since the American occupation, the Filipino has justified the<br/>
confidence of those who argued that he needed<br/>
only tactful and helpful supervision to develop<br/>
him into a valuable workman and a useful<br/>
citizen. About five years ago American <span style="color: #0000FF;">interests </span>joined in securing a franchise for an electric<br/>
railway and lighting system in. Manila. Three<br/>
years were required to build the machinery<br/>
and equipment in American shops, to ship it to<br/>
Manila, to lay forty miles of track, erect miles<br/>
of "feeder <span style="color: #ff0000;">wires</span>," and put into operation the<br/>
finest electric property west of the Golden Gate.<br/>
The tall chimney of the power house is the first<br/>
object sighted from an incoming steamer, and<br/>
it was erected entirely by natives. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moros </span>and<br/>
Tagalogs joined in excavating for the power<br/>
house; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Igorrotes </span>dropped the ties into place,<br/>
spiked down the shining rails, and lifted the<br/>
steel poles into position; <span style="color: #ff0000;">1locanos </span>soon learned<br/>
the art of heating iron rivets and deftly tossing<br/>
them to a fellow workman high up in the steel<br/>
structure of the power house.<br/>
<br/>
TEACHING THE USE OF TOOLS<br/>
<br/>
At first it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to instruct the men in<br/>
the use of such simple tools as the pick, shovel,<br/>
and wheelbarrow. This had to be done<br/>
through an interpreter, but the men were quick<br/>
to learn. But the wheelbarrow was a mystery.<br/>
Any one with a grain of intelligence could see<br/>
that the barrow was to be filled with earth,<br/>
stone, or whatever was to be moved. Ordinarily it would be filled with the hands, but they<br/>
saw that this new tool of the Americana, the<br/>
shovel, would do it quicker. But when full,<br/>
the barrow was balanced on the head, as are<br/>
all bundles in the Philippines, and carried to its<br/>
destination! Then "the big boss" showed the<br/>
interpreter how to roll it. It was difficult for<br/>
them, at first, to balance the load on a single<br/>
wheel, but with a little practice it became easy.<br/>
That, in a nutshell, is the story of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">apprenticeship </span>of the Filipino. If the foreman swore at<br/>
Miguel for "<span style="color: #0000FF;">loafing</span>" instead of shoveling sand<br/>
into the barrow, ten to one Miguel would drop<br/>
the shovel and begin to scoop up the sand with<br/>
his hands. This reversion to primitive methods<br/>
when confused or frightened is only natural<br/>
to one who has a lifetime and an ancestry of<br/>
primitive customs behind him and only a year<br/>
of training in the use of modern tools.<br/>
