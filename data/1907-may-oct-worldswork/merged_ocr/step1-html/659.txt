<span>OUR <span style="color: #ff0000;">TOWN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">LIFE-WHAT </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IT </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WORTH</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>have the reading habit, as a people. Some of<br/>
our younger people have the reading disease:<br/>
no other word describes the passion for the<br/>
printed page that hunches them up over books<br/>
when they had better be at play, and gives the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">optician </span>his harvest. But even this mania for<br/>
anything to read, regardless of quality, is a<br/>
cheerful thing. It is a part of our craving for<br/>
improvement, for freedom from the commonplace, for education. By it imaginations are<br/>
stirred and ambitions aroused, that lead many<br/>
of the readers into braver fields of endeavor<br/>
than they would have dreamed were possible<br/>
in the little world around them.<br/>
<br/>
Our desire to travel, too, feeds on minds<br/>
thus disturbed by images of unseen things. A<br/>
few years ago we were in the midst of "hard<br/>
times," so hard that when one young fellow<br/>
succeeded in borrowing a hundred dollars to<br/>
go East on, one of our bank presidents went to<br/>
him to find out where he got it, as he would<br/>
like to borrow that much himself and couldn't<br/>
get it. But to-day, with "flush" times, good<br/>
crops selling at high prices, and the bank<br/>
accounts fairly full, we have set our hearts on<br/>
seeing the places we have read and dreamed<br/>
about. Hardly any of us need deny ourselves<br/>
a trip to San Francisco or Los Angeles: many<br/>
go "back East" <span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>our eyes what "out West"<br/>
is to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Easterner</span>: some even go to Europe, or<br/>
Hawaii, or Alaska, or Japan. We spend our<br/>
margin of savings on these expeditions, and<br/>
then usually we come back pretty well content<br/>
with our own town. We have learned that<br/>
people everywhere live just about as we do;<br/>
that folks in New York have as much trouble<br/>
and complain as much of the narrowness of<br/>
their horizon as we do; in short, that we are<br/>
pretty well off. And when we return we realize<br/>
the preciousness of old friendships and <span style="color: #0000FF;">accustomed </span>paths and familiar faces. What we<br/>
have seen better done elsewhere we strive to<br/>
improve in our town, but that is building up a<br/>
familiar structure, and not a reckless throwing<br/>
away of valuable associations. Travel becomes<br/>
thus part of our education in knowledge, in<br/>
the broadening of our sympathies, and in contentment with our own way of living.<br/>
<br/>
We are progressing in our amusements, too.<br/>
A larger proportion of our people enter into the<br/>
spirit of play than formerly-l mean the older<br/>
people. Our grown business men have taken<br/>
to handball on Y. M. C. A. courts, and they and<br/>
the principals of the schools and even some<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>our preachers aid and encourage the field<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">LIFE-WHAT </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IT </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WORTH</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>

meets and ball games of the boys. They even<br/>
tried golf for a time, but that did not work out<br/>
very well; it did not seem to satisfy our more<br/>
nervous temperament and our desire for<br/>
"results," and our craving for sharp competition. Tennis suits us better. One club<br/>
that began in high school days continues with<br/>
almost unbroken membership now that the<br/>
boys who founded it are men with children ten<br/>
years old.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back over <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>years of pretty<br/>
rapid changes in our town, it seems to me we<br/>
have done mighty well. Ours is a good place<br/>
to live in. Here we find full satisfaction of our<br/>
social instincts-we have our friends, the<br/>
pleasant sight of familiar faces even of people<br/>
we do not know, our snug social groups and<br/>
social gatherings. Education for us, without<br/>
our town, would be less sufficient, less <span style="color: #0000FF;">enjoyable</span>. Our business requires such a centre.<br/>
But for the town, music and the theatres would<br/>
be difficult pleasures, rarely attained. Travel<br/>
would be less. We should have no circus, no<br/>
Fourth of July parade.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, we are the focus of activities<br/>
in our neighborhood; we are to our vicinity<br/>
what New York is to the country at large, the<br/>
centre of the pleasures and benefits and <span style="color: #0000FF;">conveniences </span>that gather around the concentrating<br/>
point of business anywhere. We are our local<br/>
metropolis.<br/>
<br/>
And the destiny of the country is bound up<br/>
in such places as this. They are a vital part<br/>
of our national machinery of government, of<br/>
industry, of commerce, of education, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">democracy</span>. Where the country supplies the raw<br/>
material-men and products-we perform the<br/>
first labor of polishing them and shaping them<br/>
for greater uses. We sort them, work them<br/>
over, distribute them. We are a half-way<br/>
house toward the more complex and refined<br/>
products of civilization, and we are indispensable. Our life is much the same as the<br/>
life in cities of the same size all over the United<br/>
States, and in that fact lies the importance of<br/>
understanding our life. We are the secondary<br/>
units of a coherent nationality, as important<br/>
in the unity of the country as the states.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is significant of the future direction of our influence that in our case the New<br/>
England stock of people, with their New<br/>
England educational ideals and their political<br/>
faith and their sterner business training, are<br/>
rather getting the better of the Southern<br/>
element.<br/>
