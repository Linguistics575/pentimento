I <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tHE </span>development of the skyscraper has<br/>
advanced to such a point that problems<br/>
new even to this class of architecture<br/>
<br/>
are being met. The new Singer Building<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>in lower New York, will be the tallest building<br/>
in the world-forty-seven stories in height, <span style="color: #ff0000;">rising </span>612 feet above the street.<br/>
<br/>
When completed, this office-building will<br/>
have a floor space equivalent to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-story<br/>
</span>building covering twenty city blocks. To concentrate such an immense space upon a total<br/>
area of but 26,000 square feet, presents at once<br/>
the serious question of sufficient light and air.<br/>
Usually, a high building is designed to cover<br/>
as much of the area of the lot as possible,<br/>
thereby cutting off the light of surrounding<br/>
buildings. For this reason dark offices are multiplying in the largest American cities. And many<br/>
buildings that are now well lighted must soon<br/>
depend wholly or in part upon artificial light,<br/>
as adjacent buildings are extended upward.<br/>
All the offices of the Singer Building will be well<br/>
lighted, but the building adjoining it will not<br/>
suffer. The part of the building that will be<br/>
carried up forty-seven stories will occupy but<br/>
one-sixth of the lot; the remainder will be<br/>
only fourteen stories in height. This high<br/>
portion will also be in approximately the<br/>
centre of the new building. Thus every<br/>
office will be well lighted without a sacrifice<br/>
of real estate values that would be <span style="color: #ff0000;">commer</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cially </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">impracticable</span>. The location of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">high<br/>
<br/>
</span>tower near the centre of the lot also makes<br/>
it possible for nearby offices to share the sunli ht.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>is claimed that the safest parts of this<br/>
building in time of earthquake will be the<br/>
highest stories. The lesson of the San Francisco earthquake is that "the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steel-frame<br/>
</span>structure is the best earthquake resister.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>The steel-frame building is constructed <span style="color: #0000FF;">very<br/>
</span>much like a bird-cage, while an ordinary <span style="color: #ff0000;">build<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ing </span>of brick is a house of cards in comparison<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The only possibility of danger to the tenants <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>this high building will be the dislodgement of<br/>
<br/>
M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">RIPLEY<br/>
<br/>
</span>masonry; this, of course, would affect only the<br/>
lower floors.<br/>
<br/>
The danger of fire has been eliminated,<br/>
for inflammable material has been entirely<br/>
omitted. Even so-called "<span style="color: #0000FF;">fire-proof</span>" wood<br/>
has been barred. Nothing but metal, stone,<br/>
and baked clay enters into its construction.<br/>
Even the small plugs of wood usually inserted<br/>
into the wall to receive nails used in hanging<br/>
pictures have been excluded. The fires in<br/>
Baltimore and San Francisco proved that the<br/>
alleged "fire-proof" building is not fire-proof,<br/>
for wooden floors, window-frames, and trimmings for such a building amount to millions<br/>
of feet of lumber.<br/>
<br/>
Before beginning construction, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>test borings"<br/>
were made in order that the engineers<br/>
might know the exact condition of the soil<br/>
underneath the site of the building. These<br/>
borings are similar to the sample <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>plug" which<br/>
the careful buyer of watermelons demands in<br/>
advance. The process of building foundations<br/>
must be modified if large boulders are to be<br/>
encountered during the work. Four test<br/>
borings were driven down eighty to one <span style="color: #0000FF;">hum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>dred feet below the surface of Broadway to<br/>
explore the ground for irregularities in the soil.<br/>
After bed-rock was reached, these cores were<br/>
driven several feet into the rock; here it was<br/>
necessary to use drills with diamonds set around<br/>
the cutting edge. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">carefuldrawing </span>was made<br/>
so that the exact kind of soil at any distance<br/>
below the street could be known at any time,<br/>
and an actual core several feet in length was<br/>
lifted out of the rock and examined in the office<br/>
of the architect. This was considered necessary in order to be sure that the rock found<br/>
was bed-rock and not merely a huge boulder.<br/>
In each instance the cores brought up proved<br/>
conclusively that the building would rest upon<br/>
a foundation amply firm. Another reason<br/>
for taking the test borings was to allow a close<br/>
estimate of the cost of the foundation structure<br/>
to be made.<br/>
<br/>
