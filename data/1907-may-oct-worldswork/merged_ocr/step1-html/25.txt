<br/>
</span>so urgent as to form a constant menace to the<br/>
money markets of both New York and London.<br/>
To get the money, we have over-extended our<br/>
credit, both at home and abroad, almost as<br/>
badly as we over-extended it in 1893. In<br/>
fact, it has several times been near the breaking<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
The necessity for money has compelled the<br/>
railroads to borrow at very high rates of interest, mostly on 5 per cent. notes running for three<br/>
years. Half a dozen of the greatest manufacturing companies have found it well-nigh<br/>
impossible to borrow money for their needs,<br/>
even at these rates, and have practically abarr<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>doned the work they meant to do. The railroads also have curtailed their expenses where<br/>
they could, cancelling orders for rails which<br/>
they intended to use for extensions and renewals, abandoning surveys, and making no<br/>
further effort to find men for their labor.<br/>
<br/>
These conditions are strangely like the conditions that preceded the check in the industrial world in 1903. There are, however, a<br/>
few comforting differences. The great bankers<br/>
of Wall Street in 1903 were loaded with huge<br/>
bond issues which they could not sell at any<br/>
price. There is no such condition now.<br/>
Then the curtailment of orders from the railroads and the consequent check to <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufacturing </span>came suddenly and without much warning.<br/>
Now, there has been plenty of warning.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps most reassuring of all is the fact that<br/>
the banks, weak as they undoubtedly have<br/>
been in surplus, have also for months been<br/>
doing their best to set their houses in order.<br/>
In consequence, they met the ordeal of March<br/>
with a courage and a confidence totally unlike<br/>
the timidity that fell upon them at the beginning of the collapse of 1903, and as far<br/>
removed as possible from the actual bankers'<br/>
panic of 1893.<br/>
<br/>
It is an economic truth that, when the industries and the banks alike have made preparation for curtailment, the curtailment is<br/>
likely to pass by, because the very preparation<br/>
removes the main causes of economic disturbance. It would not be at all surprising<br/>
if the Wall Street "smash" were really the<br/>
worst that is to happen, after all. Certainly,<br/>
that "smash" has gone far toward relieving<br/>
the general situation in the money market,<br/>
and some of the best critics are disposed to look<br/>
for a period of quiet markets, with money<br/>
piling up and industrial strength constantly<br/>
increasing from this time on,<br/>

<br/>
OUR GREAT INLAND WATER PROBLEM<br/>
<br/>
HE Inland Waterways Commission,<br/>
<br/>
recently appointed by the President,<br/>
has an opportunity to write a report that shall<br/>
become one of the greatest practical documents<br/>
of our industrial history; for this Commission<br/>
has the task of making a unified and comprehensive plan for the improvement and the full<br/>
utilization of our river systems. How big and<br/>
how important this task is, only professional<br/>
geographers and those engineers who have<br/>
attacked some of these problems know. There<br/>
is already a vast literature on the subject, mostly<br/>
technical. There have been hundreds of local,<br/>
and some comprehensive, plans made by commercial bodies in the Great Valley; but a<br/>
complete study of the whole vast problem has<br/>
not been presented in one treatise. Every<br/>
reader of Dr. McGee's remarkable article on<br/>
the Mississippi River in a recent <span style="color: #ff0000;">nurpber </span>of this<br/>
magazine got glimpses of the importance,<br/>
the difficulties, and the fascination of the<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
The water-courses that converge in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mississippi </span>River are one of the greatest assets of our<br/>
country. Enormously useful as they are, even<br/>
under our general system of neglect, they are<br/>
yet undeveloped and untamed resources.<br/>
Transportation by rail has so taken our attention and energies that we have postponed till<br/>
now even a careful study of river navigation.<br/>
From the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic<br/>
there are waterways which, if improved, would<br/>
admit ships to forty states and reach communities that comprise perhaps 90 per cent. of the<br/>
wealth and population of the country. Mr.<br/>
J. J. Hill has made the calculation that it would<br/>
require the building of nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">75,000 </span>more miles<br/>
of railroads at a cost of $ 5, <span style="color: #0000FF;">500,000,000 </span>to meet<br/>
even the present demands for <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>, and that<br/>
this same result could be reached if only <span style="color: #ff0000;">onefifth </span>of the carrying power of the waterways<br/>
were utilized. The products of the interior<br/>
states have been doubled in ten years and the<br/>
railroads' capacity has been increased only<br/>
about 12% per cent. But transportation is<br/>
not the only problem that will be solved by a<br/>
proper utilization of the rivers. As important<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>is, agriculture (the rivers now waste<br/>
our lands, for the Mississippi alone carries away<br/>
400 million tons of soil a year), and forestry<br/>
(the cutting of trees causes floods), and irrigation (for water now runs to waste that could<br/>
be made to convert vast dry areas into the<br/>
most fertile fields), and water-power (the value<br/>
<br/>
