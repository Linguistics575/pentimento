the passes of the mountains. Here go the axemen to clear a path for the guiding <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag </span>of the<br/>
"front <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-man</span>." Behind them trails the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">transit-man </span>to measure the distances and the<br/>
angles; and with him comes his staff of axemen and flag-men. Behind him, again, follows<br/>
the leveller, to record the levels, and with him<br/>
are axe-men and rod-men. Sometimes there<br/>
follows a topographer, somewhat of an artist,<br/>
who makes a clay model of the general contour, not merely of the line but of the country<br/>
round about as well. So they travel on their<br/>
way, merely making notes as they go, and<br/>
leaving here a stake, and there another stake.<br/>
<br/>
When the light fails, they travel back to<br/>
camp. In flat country, where the work is<br/>
swift, the camp moves on as the men progress,<br/>
making fast stages. In plotting a route through<br/>
the mountains, the camp is usually located<br/>
at one point for weeks. In such a case, light<br/>
shacks spring up; but usually the work is done<br/>
under canvas. A tent serves for kitchen,<br/>
dining-room, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">commissary</span>. Another <span style="color: #0000FF;">shelters </span>the rod-men, axe-men, transit-men, and<br/>
levellers. Yet another covers the heads of the<br/>
survey. In this last, work goes on by night<br/>
as well as by day. The notes of the day's<br/>
work are gone over, plotted, made into a rough<br/>
sketch of the line surveyed.<br/>
<br/>
THE REWARDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>BRILLIANT WORK<br/>
<br/>
It is no easy life, but it has many compensations. In exceptional cases, two or three<br/>
years in the ranks lead to a promotion to be<br/>
an assistant engineer on some great project.<br/>
This happened in the case of General Dodge,<br/>
and in the case of the late Alexander J. Cassatt.<br/>
As a rule, however, progress is made through<br/>
the regular routine, from axe-man to rod-man,<br/>
then transit-man, then leveller, then assistant<br/>
engineer. From this routine have graduated<br/>
many of the men whose names stand high in<br/>
the list of railroad officials of America. Hence<br/>
came the president of the Pennsylvania, James<br/>
McCrea, and the third vice-president, Samuel<br/>
Rea. Howard Elliott, H. B. Ledyard, W. J.<br/>
Wilgus, and dozens of others of high rank<br/>
began their work carrying an axe or a chain in<br/>
a surveying party. To-day it would perhaps<br/>
be invidious to try to declare that any one man<br/>
overtops his fellows among the locating <span style="color: #0000FF;">engineers</span>. In the profession, John M. Graham<br/>
of the Erie, E. H. McHenry of the New Haven,<br/>
William Hood of the Southern Pacific, and J.<br/>
B. Berry of the Rock Island enjoy great reputa<br/>

<br/>
THE WORK OF THE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEER<br/>
<br/>
The "locating <span style="color: #0000FF;">engineer</span>" does not do all<br/>
the work by any means. He but outlines the<br/>
work that is to be done. When the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">location</span>"<br/>
is completed, there follows the task of building<br/>
according to that location. In this work, the<br/>
construction engineer takes command. He<br/>
belongs to a class that covers all branches,<br/>
civil and mechanical engineering, bridge building, and that rare faculty that finds its expression in the executive handling of great armies of<br/>
men. It is in this field that the greatest danger<br/>
to life is encountered, and here it is that the<br/>
finest genius of the American railroad builder<br/>
has found its expression. The keynote of the<br/>
successful construction engineer is resourcefulness. He must be stopped by nothing in<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Can you build a one per cent. line through<br/>
the Sierras?" I asked, dubiously, one of the<br/>
consulting engineers of the Western Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
"Sure we can-and we will," he said, "for<br/>
if you give an engineer enough money he can<br/>
build any kind of a line anywhere."<br/>
<br/>
To-day, the profile of that road shows a<br/>
maximum grade of only one per cent., <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiftytwo </span>feet to the mile, through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">snow-capped<br/>
</span>mountains that, of all others, seemed <span style="color: #ff0000;">most</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>forbidding.<br/>
<br/>
The grade has not been easy to obtain.<br/>
To get it the builders have upset most of<br/>
the traditions of the Sierra Nevada. They<br/>
have passed "impassable" hills, and sounded<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>bottomless "chasms; they have made a path<br/>
through "pathless" forests, and tunnelled<br/>
through <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>impenetrable" mountain ranges.<br/>
They have called upon the flower of the engineering profession, it is true, and have spent<br/>
the money of the Goulds as a spendthrift<br/>
throws his wealth to the winds. But they<br/>
have done the thing that many men of many<br/>
decades have declared was a thing impossible.<br/>
They have run a low-grade line through the<br/>
crests of the Sierras.<br/>
<br/>
The engineer who has charge of the construction of such a line has a difficult task<br/>
indeed. If he is given the two termini and<br/>
told merely to get a line between them with<br/>
so much grade, the task is relatively easy.<br/>
He will run his road around in circles, picking<br/>
his way along a river bed, making spirals about<br/>
some towering peak, following the <span style="color: #0000FF;">meanderings<br/>
<br/>
