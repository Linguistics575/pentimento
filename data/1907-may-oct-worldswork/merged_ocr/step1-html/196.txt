supply is not sufficient. Many of the mill<br/>
hands do not work constantly. Some of them<br/>
live no better than they did in their mountain<br/>
homes, and to maintain that standard they<br/>
do not have to work all the time. They move<br/>
about from mill to mill. I saw a woman and<br/>
a boy come into the superintendent's office of<br/>
a Spartanburg mill to ask for an advance on<br/>
their wages. On being questioned, she named<br/>
eight mills at which she had worked during the<br/>
past two years. A family in Charlotte, N. C.,<br/>
moved four times in one week. To keep their<br/>

"Some time ago," said one mill president,<br/>
"they may have had child labor because it was<br/>
cheap; but, considering what they do, the<br/>
children that work now are the most expensive<br/>
help we have." The mill men's position<br/>
is, that the best place for the children is in<br/>
school; the next best place (for those over<br/>
the legal age) is in the mill, and the last place<br/>
for them is running loose in idleness<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

Practically all the larger mills in Spartanburg<br/>
County maintain free schools for the children<br/>
of their villages. At a little North Carolina<br/>
town, the mill superintendent was asked if he<br/>
objected to a graded school near his mill.<br/>
"No," was the answer; "the more children<br/>
you get to go to it, the better I like it. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lwant<br/>

<br/>
Unconsciously the mills are doing more to<br/>
stop the labor of children and send them to<br/>
school than any other influence. In North<br/>
Carolina, for instance, in 1880, before there<br/>
were many mills, 56 per cent. of the male children between IO and <span style="color: #0000FF;">15 </span>years of age were at<br/>
work, mostly on the farms. In 1900, after so<br/>
many boys had gone into the mills as <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>doffers,"<br/>
the percentage was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Si</span>. But in 1900, when<br/>
the working children were congregated, people<br/>
at once recognized that they were working and<br/>
that they were not at school. A public<br/>
