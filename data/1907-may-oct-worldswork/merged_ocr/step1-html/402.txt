</span>to stay at Hampton for only a few years and<br/>
then go into some pioneer work among my<br/>
people. A few weeks later, General Armstrong<br/>
asked me if I would assume the responsibility<br/>
of the discipline and the military instruction of<br/>
the institution, as Mr. Freeland had been<br/>
appointed a chaplain in the United States army.<br/>
<br/>
I remained at Hampton that summer. In<br/>
the fall, I had my first experience in organizing<br/>
the battalion and assigning work and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms<br/>
</span>to the boys. It was not so <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>as I had<br/>
supposed, largely because I had the good will<br/>
and cooperation of the young men of both<br/>
races.<br/>
<br/>
In November, General Armstrong, while in<br/>
the North pleading the cause of the Negro and<br/>
the Indian, was stricken with paralysis, from<br/>
which he never recovered. During his long<br/>
illness, I learned to know him better than ever.<br/>
I had traveled with him in the North and many<br/>
things about him had struck me as very unusual. I could never understand why a man<br/>
so great and so busy as he could be so solicitous,<br/>
under all circumstances, for the comfort of the<br/>
Quartet and the other boys who were with<br/>
him. If we had uncomfortable quarters, he<br/>
would share them. If we were put at a seemingly undesirable table in a hotel, he would<br/>
sit with us. If we found it necessary to take<br/>
a hack at a station or to hire a wagon for our<br/>
baggage, he always got the man who had the<br/>
poorest horse and the most disreputable <span style="color: #0000FF;">looking </span>vehicle. He remarked one day that such<br/>
a man needed the money most and therefore<br/>
we must help him. A few days before his<br/>
death, he asked to see me, but this was against<br/>
the doctor's orders. He insisted, however,<br/>
and Mrs. Armstrong finally yielded. He said<br/>
that he had noticed that the students were<br/>
much quieter during <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>few days. He had<br/>
not heard the laughter of the boys going past<br/>
his house to and from their meals, and he<br/>
wanted to know if any order had been given<br/>
for them to be quiet on his account. I told<br/>
him that this was the case. He asked that I<br/>
should immediately countermand the order<br/>
and say that their noise pleased him. He did<br/>
not wish his illness to have in any sense a<br/>
depressing effect upon teachers or students,<br/>
and he suggested that I see Mr. Frissell and<br/>
that we arrange as soon as possible a concert<br/>
or humorous reading. He wanted to counteract the depressing effect that his illness had on<br/>
the school. I could not then understand how<br/>
a man so ill should be thinking about such<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">UPHILL </span>CLIMB<br/>
<br/>
minor details as the life of the students and the<br/>
school. <span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>this interview, he questioned<br/>
me about the <span style="color: #ff0000;">minutest </span>detail of the school<br/>
work, even about individual pupils.<br/>
<br/>
General Armstrong's death, in May, 1903,<br/>
was to <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the students and friends of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hampton </span>a tremendous blow. We could not see how<br/>
the school could possibly exist without him. He<br/>
had actually worn himself out going throughout<br/>
the North, begging the money necessary for<br/>
the maintenance of the work which he had<br/>
founded at so great <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sacrifice of time and<br/>
strength and energy. His personality was so<br/>
overwhelming that it seemed to me that no one<br/>
could possibly take his place. We all loved<br/>
Mr. Frissell and had the greatest respect for<br/>
him, but we doubted seriously whether he<br/>
could take General <span style="color: #0000FF;">Armstrong</span>'s place, and, as<br/>
I think of it to-day, we were right. General<br/>
Armstrong had completed his work and Mr.<br/>
Frissell, who succeeded him, is doing as <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfect </span>and as complete a work as did General<br/>
Armstrong; but he is filling his own place and<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>I am sure, in a way that would merit General<br/>
Armstrong's approval.<br/>
<br/>
I felt, after graduating, as did many of my<br/>
fellow resident graduates, that our education<br/>
was not by any means completed, so for some<br/>
years we did graduate work in advanced <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects </span>under <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of the teachers of Hampton<br/>
Institute. Out of this effort for advanced<br/>
training has grown the present graduate courses<br/>
in the institution. I continued my law studies<br/>
also for some time under the tutelage of Mr.<br/>
F. S. Collier, a lawyer in the town of Hampton,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Southern gentleman, who not only instructed<br/>
me without pay but allowed me the use of his<br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
The work <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">disciplinarian </span>one would naturally expect to be irksome; to ferret out <span style="color: #0000FF;">irregularities</span>, to punish misdemeanors, and settle<br/>
disputes, would naturally not make a man<br/>
popular with those over whom he exercises<br/>
such authority. And then, too, I had the added<br/>
difficulty of being a Negro and having to<br/>
deal with the Indians as well as the members<br/>
of my own race. Many of my friends advised<br/>
me against accepting the work, feeling that<br/>
while I might succeed with my own race I<br/>
could not get along with the Indians, and that<br/>
when questions arose between the two races it<br/>
would be impossible for me to give a decision<br/>
that would satisfy both. I confess that I also<br/>
had serious misgivings; but I felt that if one<br/>
were honest and sympathetic in his dealings,<br/>
<br/>
