</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MR</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>TAFT'S PRESIDENTIAL PROGRAMME<br/>
<br/>
SECRETARY TAFT'S speech at Columbus,<br/>
Ohio, which was accepted as a formal<br/>
declaration of his candidacy for the Republican<br/>
nomination for the Presidency (and which was<br/>
so meant), lacked the quality of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bugle-call</span>;<br/>
but it did not lack definiteness nor sincerity.<br/>
As a member of Mr. Roosevelt's Cabinet, he is<br/>
in hearty accord with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr. </span>Roosevelt's aims.<br/>
If he were not, he would not retain his portfolio.<br/>
He is not a man to serve where he does not<br/>
approve. Since he is in accord with these<br/>
policies, the burden of his speech was necessarily<br/>
an <span style="color: #0000FF;">explanation </span>and approval of them; for these<br/>
are the subjects that now demand discussion.<br/>
<br/>
He approved the Federal <span style="color: #0000FF;">regulation </span>of railroad rates and favored amendments to the<br/>
present <span style="color: #0000FF;">law </span>which should enable the Interstate<br/>
Commerce Commission to classify traffic and<br/>
to bring about uniform classification; and he<br/>
approved the Federal regulation of interstate<br/>
railroad capitalization and securities. Such<br/>
supervision, he explained, was not socialistic,<br/>
but preventive of socialism. He added:<br/>
<br/>
"I am opposed to Government <span style="color: #0000FF;">ownership<br/>
</span>"First, because existing Government railways are not<br/>
managed with either the efficiency or economy of privately<br/>
managed roads and the rates charged are not as low and<br/>
therefore not as beneficial to the public.<br/>
<br/>
"Second, because it would involve an <span style="color: #ff0000;">esrienditure </span>of<br/>
certainly twelve billions of dollars to acquire <span style="color: #0000FF;">interstate<br/>
</span>railways, and the creation of an enormous National <span style="color: #0000FF;">debt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"Third, because it would place in the hands of a reckless executive a power of control <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">business </span>and politics<br/>
that the imagination can hardly conceive, and would expose our popular institutions to danger."<br/>
<br/>
He would "restrain unlawful trusts with <span style="color: #0000FF;">all<br/>
</span>the efficiency of injunctive process, and would<br/>
punish with all severity of criminal prosecution<br/>
every attempt on the part of aggregated capital<br/>
through illegal means to suppress competition."<br/>
<br/>
He favors a Federal graduated inheritance<br/>
tax, when the Government should need the<br/>
revenue, and a graduated income tax if the<br/>
Supreme Court should reverse its decision<br/>
against such a measure.<br/>
<br/>
He spoke for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>revision of the tariff after the<br/>
next Presidential election.<br/>
<br/>
There was, therefore, nothing very new in<br/>
the speech. Yet it was none the less genuine.<br/>
It was the speech of a man who spoke his own<br/>
convictions and it put Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>in a<br/>
definite relation to every important public<br/>
question of the day. If he become President,<br/>
essentially the same policy will be pursued as<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">FOR </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IMPROVING<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE POSTAL SERVICE 9393<br/>
President Roosevelt is pursuing, with a difference of temperaments. This is not news to<br/>
any one who knows the Secretary's personality<br/>
or thought: indeed, the speech lacked novelty<br/>
only because his views were already known.<br/>
<br/>
The action of the Republican Convention<br/>
next summer can be only guessed at. But<br/>
as good a guess as any is that Mr. Taft will be<br/>
nominated, thanks both to his own positive<br/>
qualities and to the kind of enemies that he has<br/>
made in Ohio<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>His visit to the Philippines<br/>
and his journey around the world will be likely<br/>
to add to his popularity. By the way, his<br/>
travels since he became Secretary of War go<br/>
beyond all precedents set by high officials in<br/>
our Government, or perhaps in any other<br/>
government.<br/>
<br/>
PLANS FOR IMPROVING THE POSTAL SERVICE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OSTMASTER-GENERAL </span>MEYER has<br/>
<br/>
set the task to make several far-reaching<br/>
and long-discussed improvements in the postal<br/>
service. Among them are these:<br/>
<br/>
(r) He will urge Congress to establish a<br/>
domestic parcels-post to carry parcels weighing<br/>
as much as ten pounds. This recommendation<br/>
will be opposed by what Mr. Wanamaker,<br/>
when he was Postmaster-General, called "the<br/>
six reasons" against it-namely, the six<br/>
express companies. A vigorous opposition<br/>
will be made also by some country merchants,<br/>
because a parcels-post would increase the business done by mail by the great department<br/>
stores in the cities. But it would <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>a great<br/>
convenience to the public.<br/>
<br/>
(2) He will make an effort to establish a<br/>
system of postal savings-banks. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement </span>will doubtless incidentally lead the states<br/>
that do not <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>safeguard the deposits<br/>
in the savings-banks to revise their laws governing those institutions. To this, too, there will<br/>
be vigorous opposition. It will doubtless be<br/>
the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>item in his programme to<br/>
carry through. We have already given the<br/>
Filipinos postal savings-banks.<br/>
<br/>
(3) He will revive the old postal notes, but<br/>
with some modifications. These will be limited<br/>
in amount to $ 5, or possibly less, and will be<br/>
made payable to individuals instead of "to the<br/>
bearer."<br/>
<br/>
(4) He is experimenting with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>slot-machine<br/>
for selling postage stamps. If it proves satisfactory, the Government will probably manufacture the machines. One-cent, two-cent, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">five-cent </span>stamps will be sold.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
