<span>9088 A LIGHTHOUSE<br/>
mention particularly the south-bound vessels<br/>
because they labor under a great disadvantage<br/>
at the Cape, as they have to sail between the<br/>
shoals and the Gulf Stream, while those bound<br/>
north can go broad off in the Gulf Stream with<br/>
a fair tide.<br/>
<br/>
"With a westerly wind, it is of great importance, to sailing vessels especially, to turn the<br/>
corner or elbow of the coast as near to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>shoal<br/>
as is safe, but at present they have no means of<br/>
knowing in the night or thick weather when<br/>
they are at a safe distance from this shoal.<br/>
In a clear night, under the most favorable<br/>
circumstances, many captains run their vessels<br/>
until they sink the light on the mainland at<br/>
Cape Hatteras below the horizon, but this<br/>
carries them twenty miles at sea into the strong<br/>
tide and rough water; in many instances, this<br/>
sweeps them back to the north and east, and<br/>
the vessels often lie off Hatteras for weeks in<br/>
trying to round the Cape. After this point is<br/>
passed, a vessel can sail with safety nearer the<br/>
shore and inside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the tide.<br/>
<br/>
"In thick or <span style="color: #0000FF;">stormy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">weather</span>, here is the home<br/>
of storms, with nothing to mark the shoals but<br/>
the foaming breakers; the vessels are tossed by<br/>
this peculiar Hatteras sea and swept back by<br/>
the ever-changing, rapid tide, into the vicinity<br/>
of the dreaded shoals. The greatest loss on<br/>
Hatteras Shoal is caused by having to give it<br/>
too wide a berth, there being no light and<br/>
whistle to guide the captains. It has been<br/>
supposed impossible to put even a buoy on<br/>
Hatteras Shoal, since the saw-teeth (as the<br/>
peculiar sea is called) chafe the chains off in a<br/>
short time. My plan (which I have placed<br/>
before the most competent engineers of the<br/>
country and which is by them pronounced<br/>
practical) is for an iron structure to be built on<br/>
shore, launched, ballasted, towed to place and<br/>
sunk, forming an immense diving-bell in which<br/>
the sand pumps can be worked to sink the<br/>
structure into the sand, forming a solid<br/>
foundation.<br/>
<br/>
"After working on these plans for a number<br/>
of years, I went to Washington and made<br/>
application for a patent, but it did not go to<br/>
issue at that time. When I finally found that<br/>
my patents could be allowed, I showed them<br/>
to the engineer of the Lighthouse Board, and<br/>
am sorry to tell you that he looked at me as<br/>
though he considered me a <span style="color: #0000FF;">meddler</span>, interfering with the work of the Lighthouse Board.<br/>
<br/>
"I then went to see Governor Dingley, he<br/>
being then the Representative from my district,<br/>
<br/>
FOR HATTERAS<br/>
<br/>
and he wrote me a letter of introduction to<br/>
Commodore Greer, who was the chairman of<br/>
the Lighthouse Board. He received me<br/>
very kindly, promised to do all he could, and<br/>
then introduced me to the Engineer Secretary,<br/>
Mr. John Millis.<br/>
<br/>
"I went to see Mr. Millis at his office, and<br/>
said to him:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>have a plan for building a lighthouse on<br/>
sandy foundations, and a letter from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Repretative </span>Dingley.'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tt'Mr</span>. Eells, I would rather you would not<br/>
trouble Hatteras,' he said,'as there are other<br/>
movements being made at that point. Is there<br/>
not some other point where you could plant<br/>
your structure? If there is, I will be glad to<br/>
cooperate with you.'<br/>
<br/>
"'Yes,' I said,'on Pollock Rip, at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">entrance </span>to the shoals off Monomoy, near where<br/>
my captain lost my vessel, and who was drowned<br/>
with another man who came from my home.<br/>
What is the usual procedure in establishing a<br/>
new lighthouse? Is it necessary to get a<br/>
petition signed?'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'I </span>think something of that kind would be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span>,' he replied.<br/>
<br/>
"I then got a petition signed by nearly every<br/>
commercial interest along the Atlantic coast<br/>
and by ship-owners in New York, Boston, and<br/>
Baltimore, for a lighthouse to be built at Pollock<br/>
Rip. I laid this petition before the engineers,<br/>
but never heard anything more from it.<br/>
<br/>
"I finally took the drawings to New York<br/>
and showed them to Abner McKinley, the<br/>
President's brother, and through Mr. McKinley<br/>
I met Admiral Schley, who was then chairman<br/>
of the Lighthouse Board.<br/>
<br/>
"He looked the drawings over, spoke well<br/>
of the plans and said<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'I </span>will do what I can for<br/>
you in having this idea carried out.' All the<br/>
naval men whom I met during this effort were<br/>
strongly in favor of, and very much pleased with,<br/>
my project; but, to counteract this, I am sorry<br/>
to say that I had continuous opposition from<br/>
the army engineers, who were the engineering<br/>
officers of the Lighthouse Board.<br/>
<br/>
"Admiral Wilde, whom I had previously met<br/>
when he was Naval Secretary of the Lighthouse Board, always showed great pleasure<br/>
in promoting my project. I consider him to<br/>
be my first friend in the Government employ<br/>
to endorse this project.<br/>
<br/>
"I used a great deal of time in getting<br/>
signed this petition for the appropriation of<br/>
$ 300,000 for a lighthouse at Pollock Rip,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
