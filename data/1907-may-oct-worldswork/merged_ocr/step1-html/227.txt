from England when Williamsburg was the capital of the colony<br/>

local natural resources such as compel a city's<br/>

as a necessary railroad centre, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">indus<br/>

trial pluck of its people. The emancipation<br/>
of the common man by the end of the old<br/>
Southern <span style="color: #0000FF;">regime </span>showed itself more quickly<br/>
and dramatically here than anywhere else.<br/>
Most of the men who have built the city and<br/>
made fortunes came from country homes,<br/>
or little villages of upper Georgia, Tennessee,<br/>
and North Carolina-came with nothing in<br/>
their pockets and with no capital but their<br/>
energy. They demonstrated quickly that the<br/>
Southerner has exactly the same commercial<br/>
traits as the New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Englander </span>or the man of<br/>
the Northwest. The city's growth continues<br/>
at an amazing rate. For instance, the value<br/>
of its manufactured products, shown by the<br/>
census bulletin of 1905, was nearly 26 million<br/>
dollars a year. Deposits in its banks a year<br/>
ago were 268 millions. It has the busy air<br/>
of a Western rather than of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">old-timc </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">South-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ern </span>town. Its growth has at times outrun<br/>
the development of its civic character; but the<br/>
race riot of last year roused the people to<br/>
the most beneficial movements for <span style="color: #0000FF;">improving<br/>
