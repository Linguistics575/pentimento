it was, because of their preceding caution, the<br/>
banks stood like a solid wall behind the markets where the people deal and saved the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>from a host of failures.<br/>

The warnings carried by this collapse to the<br/>
legislators of the country, to the Federal<br/>
authorities, to the financiers, to the banking<br/>
lords, are subjects of economic and political<br/>
discussion rather than subjects of advice to<br/>
investors. Therefore they may be omitted<br/>

<br/>
has become a public official, chosen<br/>
by an imperial state for a service affecting the<br/>
entire country, some measure of reserve may<br/>
be cast aside in the interest of truth. In the<br/>
year 1900, the name of Charles E. Hughes<br/>
was not to be found in "Who's Who in<br/>
America." In the year 1907, his name and<br/>
achievements are known in every village between the two <span style="color: #ff0000;">bceans </span>and in every capital of<br/>
Europe. And this sudden prominence has<br/>
not surprised any of his friends; they have<br/>
been quietly waiting for the world to discover<br/>
what they have many times asserted that he<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">is</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>ablest lawyer of his age in New York<br/>

<br/>
Thirty years ago I was one of a group of<br/>
college students that welcomed into Brown<br/>
University the boy who was "father to the<br/>
man." He was of slender, boyish figure,<br/>
obviously immature, uncertain of himself,<br/>
plastic and receptive, with little trace in his<br/>
bearing or manner of the strong" and dignified<br/>
personality that has since developed. Like<br/>
Kipling's ship, he had not "found himself."<br/>
He was "moving about in <span style="color: #0000FF;">worlds </span>half realized."<br/>
He clearly needed, not professional or technical study, but a chance to ripen under intellectual sunshine. He needed, above all,<br/>
to "invite his soul." He would have been<br/>
stunted and ruined had he plunged at once<br/>
into professional or technical study. His<br/>
<br/>
IT IS a difficult task to analyze a close<br/>
<br/>
nature needed tempering rather than sharpening. The American college is often reproached<br/>
for offering to young men a life that is apparently leisurely and desultory, as contrasted<br/>
with the intense and specialized activity of<br/>
the professional or technical school. But it<br/>
finds ample justification in the careers of men<br/>
who in those four years of unhurried ripening<br/>
discover for the first time their own powers,<br/>
their future task, and determine their own<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Weltanschauung</span>. When such men graduate,<br/>
they are indeed "out of a job," but they are<br/>
in permanent possession of an ideal.<br/>
<br/>
Young Hughes entered college poor in purse,<br/>
with no influential friends behind him, with no<br/>
athletic or social prestige, but with the blessing<br/>
of a sturdy, God-fearing ancestry, and an<br/>
intensely alert and eager mind. His <span style="color: #ff0000;">fatherstill </span>living-was an honored clergyman, and<br/>
the boy was brought up to revere the simple,<br/>
homely virtues which have formed the sub<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>stance of American character. Yet it was very<br/>
clear that he would not choose his father's<br/>
profession. Though of stainless character,<br/>
he was thoroughly unconventional in his mode<br/>
of life, and had a touch of that Bohemianism<br/>
which among students is so frequently the mask<br/>
of profound moral seriousness. He never<br/>
hurt himself through over-study. He was<br/>
intellectually a rover, wandering at will through<br/>
vast tracts of English and French literature,<br/>
and easily the best read man in his class. He<br/>
managed to take high honors in scholarship,<br/>
