<br/>
</span>these wonderful adaptations to an end could be explained<br/>
in a very simple way. Young caterpillars, for example,<br/>
will follow the light, so long as they are hungry. If <span style="color: #0000FF;">they<br/>
</span>find no food, they will keep on climbing, conceivably until<br/>
they die. When they are cold, they will not move. When<br/>
the warm sun comes up in the spring, they begin to crawl<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">upward</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>All that is needful to assume is that in the<br/>
hungry condition the light sets up certain chemical reactions<br/>
which cause the animal to move, just as it sets up a reaction<br/>
in a photographic plate, or explodes a mixture of hydrogen<br/>
and chlorine gas. Certain chemical stimuli from meat<br/>
cause a fly to lay its eggs. In the fat these stimuli are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lacking </span>They can be produced artificially."<br/>
<br/>
In short, if the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of light, heat, acids,<br/>
alkalies, pressure, gravity, electricity, etc., can<br/>
be rightly applied, not only can the actions of<br/>
living creatures be varied and directed, but<br/>
their protoplasmic or cellular formations and<br/>
growths can be more or less controlled, for they<br/>
are all working under similar forces. And<br/>
so are the vast majority of the actions unconsciously occurring in our bodies. Our conscious<br/>
intellects can control many functions, yet have<br/>
no glimmering sense of the extensive chemical<br/>
stimuli, responses, and consequent alterations<br/>
which compose the field of cellular growth and<br/>
nutrition in our bodies. We are familiar with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the'marvelous </span>variations in flowers, fruits, and<br/>
vegetables, accomplished artificially by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Burbank </span>and others. Many equally interesting<br/>
"controls" have been accomplished in the<br/>
animal kingdom. Two classes of such controls<br/>
especially interest the public: reproduction<br/>
independent of the male, and checking the<br/>
processes which bring decay and death to the<br/>
adult. We might add a third: reversing the<br/>
trend of physical life, by which one would<br/>
"grow" from age to youth.<br/>
<br/>
In all the higher forms of the animal kingdom, reproduction can only follow fertilization<br/>
of the ovum, or female cell, by the generative<br/>
cell of the male. Immediately following such<br/>
fertilization, the ovum cell begins to divide<br/>
into halves, each half possessing all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">elements </span>of the original cell. These two each<br/>
divide, and the division goes on until millions<br/>
of such cells have grown from the parent cell<br/>
into an organized structure-the embryo.<br/>
Reproduction is not always dependent upon<br/>
fertilization by a male cell, however; many of<br/>
the lower classes of animal life possess both<br/>
male and female elements within themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, Dr. Loeb, by altering the<br/>
conditions of the sea water in which <span style="color: #ff0000;">seaurchins </span>were placed, whereby they were led<br/>
to mature their eggs without fertilization by<br/>
<br/>
BE LENGTHENED? <span style="color: #ff0000;">9233<br/>
</span>the males, did not demonstrate a <span style="color: #0000FF;">new<br/>
</span>method of reproduction; but he did interfere<br/>
with the normal method in the case of <span style="color: #0000FF;">seaA<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">urchins</span>. What he actually proved was, that<br/>
fertilization of the sea-urchin<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>eggs is largely<br/>
due, not to some mysterious "vital force"<br/>
existing solely in the male cell, but to chemical<br/>
stimulation, or action of ferments, which can<br/>
be generated artificially. Placing unfertilized<br/>
sea-urchin eggs in sea water, he found that an<br/>
addition of chloride of magnesium caused <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>number of the eggs to develop, but not to such<br/>
an extent that these fatherless larvae of <span style="color: #0000FF;">seal<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">urchins </span>could reproduce their kind.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Loeb's discovery is of deep significance<br/>
in shaping our conceptions of vital processes;<br/>
he has discovered a basic principle that upsets<br/>
our ancient views of life, but it is a far cry to<br/>
the day when masculinity need tremble lest it<br/>
become dethroned. The invention of a<br/>
spinet limited to one taut wire, a hammer, and<br/>
a key, would justify the prediction of a concert<br/>
grand piano, but Dr. Loeb's sea-urchin victory<br/>
advanced to the control of human reproduction<br/>
by such laboratory means would require<br/>
millions of added intricacies. No escutcheon<br/>
will ever be emblazoned with a pinch of salt<br/>
and an incubator. No microscope can pierce<br/>
so deep into the delicacy of detail in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reproductive </span>cell as to reach its limit. In the human<br/>
race the male cell is <span style="color: #0000FF;">I-f</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5,000 </span>of an inch wide,<br/>
and yet the adult product of its <span style="color: #ff0000;">coalescence-the<br/>
</span>child-will resemble the father. Out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>cell<br/>
so small that thousands of them could herd<br/>
within the confines of a single drop of dew,<br/>
spring the little traits of character of the father<br/>
-his smile, his gait, his way of thinking, his<br/>
physique, the gathered individualities of his<br/>
ancestry-which shape and constrain, modify<br/>
and define, the lines of this man in the making.<br/>
Search through the world of wonders and you<br/>
will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>no more impressive phenomenon than<br/>
this. It gives a keener appreciation of the<br/>
meaning of atoms and molecules, millions of<br/>
which abide in every cell.<br/>
<br/>
The life process is discovered. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">electrochemical</span>, and the delicacy of detail in construction of the wonder cell of reproduction<br/>
has followed the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>in varied<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>applies in producing all the<br/>
varied forms, colors, sizes, and individualisms<br/>
of full-grown animals. Heat will alter the<br/>
color of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rabbit</span>'s hair, of the butterfly, and<br/>
the chameleon; light will redden the apple, tan<br/>
man's skin; arsenic at the roots will dye green<br/>
