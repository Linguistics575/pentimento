<span>OUR TOWN <span style="color: #ff0000;">LIFE</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>IS IT WORTH?<br/>
<br/>
notably Mississippians, Georgians, Tennesseeans, Kentuckians, and, most notably, Missourians. Our non-American population was mostly<br/>
Scandinavians, Chinese, and the remnant of<br/>
the Mexicans who had once held the state.<br/>
The "Chinks" and the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Greases</span>" colored<br/>
our life the most: the former with their utter<br/>
foreignness; the latter with the words we used<br/>
that were not used in the East. We spoke of<br/>
a cowboy as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">vaquero</span>, we did things pronto<br/>
instead of quickly, and in many other common<br/>
words used the remnants of the once universal<br/>
language of the state.<br/>
<br/>
In those days-fifteen years ago-were men<br/>
active in business who remembered when our<br/>
valley was desert, when the Indians had massacred one of the overland prairie schooner<br/>
caravans here, when vigilance committee law<br/>
was the only law, and when the first irrigation<br/>
ditch made life below the foothills a practicable<br/>
existence.<br/>
<br/>
Our industries then were primitive. The<br/>
oldest fortunes in our town were made by men<br/>
who drove their flocks of sheep to the mountains<br/>
in summer and to the foothills and valleys in<br/>
winter, and who, for months at a time, had no<br/>
companions but a couple of dogs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes </span>a Bible. A few of them still <span style="color: #0000FF;">survive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">soft-voiced</span>, slow-spoken, <span style="color: #0000FF;">black-tanned </span>by our<br/>
fervent sun, their eyes squinted with years of<br/>
shielding them against the glare. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day </span>most<br/>
of their magnificent free ranges are under<br/>
cultivation or are closed against them by fenced<br/>
cattle ranges in the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Our other great industry in those days was<br/>
wheat-growing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Unfenccd </span>miles on miles of<br/>
grain stretched out to the horizon on our level<br/>
valley floor-owned by the section (squaremile), by the thousand acres, and in one or<br/>
two instances, ten thousand acres. Now the<br/>
wheat kings, too, have lost their kingdoms.<br/>
Orchards, vineyards, dairy farms, have broken<br/>
up the great estates into smaller ranches, which,<br/>
by the way, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influx </span>of new population,<br/>
are gradually coming to be called "farms."<br/>
The expansive glory of our past is succeeded<br/>
by more intensive and <span style="color: #0000FF;">diversified </span>industries.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fifteen </span>years ago we were beginning to feel<br/>
the change-especially in politics. The pioneers<br/>
remembered when the first Republican vote<br/>
was cast in the county, and that armed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Democrats </span>had tried to find who cast it that they<br/>
might run him out. Now there were <span style="color: #0000FF;">enough<br/>
</span>Republicans to support a daily paper, and to<br/>
cast a respectable vote at elections<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Our <span style="color: #ff0000;">popu<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>9453<br/>
<br/>
lation was increasing fast, but immigration from<br/>
the South was at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">standstill</span>. Our new<br/>
settlers were from Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, and<br/>
most largely from Illinois. Their political<br/>
influence was changing the vote of the county<br/>
until to-day it is pretty evenly divided, with a<br/>
general leaning toward the Republican side.<br/>
<br/>
Their <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>in education, too, was soon<br/>
visible. Among them were many graduates<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vale </span>and Harvard and Ann Arbor-heirs of<br/>
the New England tradition of education in<br/>
public schools, with a grafting of Middle<br/>
Western ideas of pronunciation tacked on to it.<br/>
Where we youngsters had <span style="color: #0000FF;">droned </span>our lessons<br/>
in the soft, r-less speech of our fathers, we were<br/>
soon nervously calling a dog that unspeakably<br/>
atrocious <span style="color: #0000FF;">d-Yankee </span>o-g, instead of our old<br/>
friendly, euphonious "dawg." <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Coffee" went<br/>
the same path, and our parents <span style="color: #0000FF;">jeered </span>or<br/>
groaned. But when they were addressed as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">motherrrr </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fatherrr </span>indignation took the<br/>
place of ridicule. But there was no help for it,<br/>
and the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">luckless </span>youngsters of Southern<br/>
parents who have succeeded us, both by precept<br/>
and by the example of their Northern playmates, have had torn from them their birthright<br/>
of the most pleasing speech this country knows.<br/>
Only some of the girls-like most women, more<br/>
conservative of habit and tradition-retain the<br/>
accent of their mothers.<br/>
<br/>
But the methods of teaching generally have<br/>
changed with our pronunciation. We have<br/>
adopted all the latest wrinkles in pedagogy.<br/>
We have gymnasium work every day. We<br/>
teach manual training, as an elective study in<br/>
the grammar grades and high school. We<br/>
have nature study classes that go botanizing<br/>
or zoologizing about the edge of town, and that<br/>
dissect frogs in the class-room. Our high<br/>
school students talk glibly of the chemical<br/>
"lab." and the physical "lab." They publish<br/>
a school paper every month, written and<br/>
edited by the students. They have a "student<br/>
body," an organization that controls the paper,<br/>
school athletics, the school orchestra, and other<br/>
student activities. The town supports a<br/>
"parental school," which gives special attention<br/>
and instruction to truant, wayward, or backward children. Our teachers attend summer<br/>
schools and <span style="color: #0000FF;">teachers</span>' institutes and otherwise<br/>
display an amazing activity and interest and<br/>
initiative in their work, compared to our<br/>
plodding teachers of <span style="color: #ff0000;">iiftccn </span>years ago. Verily<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">influcncc </span>of Massachusetts has done us<br/>
wondrous things.<br/>
