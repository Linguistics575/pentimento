<br/>
ability as a practical man; and you may do<br/>
something better than make a fortune-you<br/>
may lead a useful life in helping to develop a<br/>
rich country and a capable people. You may<br/>
enjoy life, too, in a healthful climate, if you<br/>
select your place of residence wisely. If you<br/>
have brain and brawn to invest (and character),<br/>
you can make them yield large dividends.<br/>
If you have money to invest, you can make<br/>
that also yield large dividends; but you will<br/>
be more likely to keep your money safe and<br/>
to make it earn good dividends if you manage<br/>
it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to practice the law or to preach,<br/>
you will not be so likely to succeed. These<br/>
professions are not particularly in need of<br/>
recruits in the South. If you are a teacher,<br/>
and especially if you think more of <span style="color: #0000FF;">doing </span>good<br/>
work and of seeing appreciative results of your<br/>
work than of earning a large income, you will<br/>
find a <span style="color: #ff0000;">held </span>of usefulness as wide as the most<br/>
ardent ambition could ask. If you are an<br/>
engineer or any such craftsman-a man who<br/>
can build things-you will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>profitable<br/>
work and plenty of it. The land cries out for<br/>
builders, developers, workers, practical men;<br/>
and great rewards await them. It has (and to<br/>
spare) philosophers and politicians and professional men of all the old sorts.<br/>
<br/>
A WORD 0F WARNING<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">WHILE </span>it is impossible to write of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>industrial South without enthusiasm,<br/>
it must be remembered that the prosperity of<br/>
a city or a state may not mean the success of<br/>
every individual effort, nor does it mean that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fortune </span>or even employment is always easily<br/>
found by every man.<br/>
<br/>
There is no land where everybody can get<br/>
rich. In Montgomery, Ala., a man who had<br/>
just been talking for an hour about the need<br/>
of men, saying, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>We can give work to men<br/>
who can do anything well, from hod-carriers<br/>
to artisans of the highest skill," was accosted<br/>
by a young fellow who had come there from<br/>
a distance and whose family <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span>to<br/>
him. He sought work and failed utterly. He<br/>
was willing to do anything, he said; he had<br/>
tried in vain for two days to find a job in<br/>
Montgomery. It turned out that the young<br/>
man had never done but one kind of work and,<br/>
lacking experience and self-confidence, he had<br/>
seriously sought work only of that sort. Such<br/>
a case shows only that men will try to fill<br/>
round holes with square pegs. This general<br/>
<br/>
THE ARISEN SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
note of warning is necessary, for a quick success<br/>
is not easy to win in the South. It isn't easy<br/>
to win anywhere. But in the South it is now<br/>
easier than in any other part of the Union,<br/>
for the men who do the right things at the right<br/>
places and at the right times.<br/>
<br/>
OLD-TIME COURTESY WITH NEW ACTIVITY<br/>
<br/>
HE information gathered about the South<br/>
<br/>
in the preparation of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">magazine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>its industries, its cities, its towns, its<br/>
opportunities-incomplete as it is, comprises<br/>
a vast number of facts for which there is no<br/>
room in these pages. The territory is so<br/>
large and the subjects so numerous that no<br/>
single description could hope <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>be nearly<br/>
complete.<br/>
<br/>
But through the Service Department of<br/>
THE WORLD'S WORK, information about any<br/>
of these subjects or localities will be given to<br/>
any reader for the asking. And, if <span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>is wanted that is not in this office, any<br/>
inquirer will be directed to a trustworthy source<br/>
from which it may be obtained. This Service<br/>
Department is at the free use of every<br/>
reader.<br/>
<br/>
It is a pleasant duty to say here, at the conclusion of this most interesting incomplete<br/>
task of reporting and emphasizing the South's<br/>
progress, that the editors of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">magazme </span>and<br/>
other writers for it who have gathered these<br/>
facts have had a most pleasant experience.<br/>
Everywhere they went-and they went in almost<br/>
every part of every Southern State-they<br/>
found courteous and helpful men, in official<br/>
and in private life. The search for information from them has been made an agreeable<br/>
task; and these long journeys were journeys<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">personal </span>kindness to another, and<br/>
from one hospitality to another-through a<br/>
land of Qld-time courtesy as well as of a newly<br/>
awakened activity.<br/>
<br/>
If there be readers who find a magazine<br/>
monotonous that is given wholly to one subject, such a journey is commended to them;<br/>
for they will see the rapid rise of a great population of American folk, which is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cheerfulest<br/>
</span>sight on our continent and the most important<br/>
event that is taking place in our life. If there<br/>
be monotony, it is the fault of us who have<br/>
written, not of the subject; for it may be said<br/>
now (and this could not have been said for a<br/>
hundred years till now) that the Southern<br/>
people are coming into the full current of the<br/>
life of the Republic.<br/>
