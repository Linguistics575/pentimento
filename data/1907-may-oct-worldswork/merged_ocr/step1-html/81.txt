ject began to be preserved, an aggregate<br/>
<br/>
of something over 24,000,000 has been<br/>
added to our population through immigration.<br/>
Looking back over the wave line which depicts<br/>
the successive risings and fallings of the alien<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influx </span>during these eighty-seven years, one will<br/>
be struck not only by its extremely jagged and<br/>
irregular character but also by the periodicity<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>undulations it records. He will observe<br/>
that the years <span style="color: #ff0000;">1854</span>, 1873, 1882, and 1892<br/>
stand as culminating points, from which the<br/>
line dips in either direction into periods of<br/>
depression. In other words, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obvious </span>omission of the Civil War decade, each<br/>
ten years of the last half of the nineteenth<br/>
<br/>
SINCE 1820, when the statistics of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sub<br/>

<br/>
century, roughly speaking, witnessed a rapid<br/>
and formidable swell of the immigrant stream,<br/>
followed by almost, if not quite, as pronounced<br/>
a subsidence.<br/>
<br/>
On this principle, we should have reached<br/>
another maximum about 1902 or 1903 and<br/>
should now be sinking back by long leaps<br/>
toward the lower level. We reached the<br/>
maximum promptly at the scheduled time;<br/>
but, instead of passing over it and downward,<br/>
we have continued to mount higher and higher<br/>
ever since. With a slight interruption in 1904,<br/>
for the tenth time straight each year's immigration has considerably surpassed in numbers<br/>
that of the preceding year. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1903</span>, a point<br/>
was reached which was the highest <span style="color: #0000FF;">yet </span>attained<br/>
