<br/>
</span>to waste millions in school expenses, to keep<br/>
the tax books of private title companies up to<br/>
date while <span style="color: #0000FF;">letting </span>city books get years in arrears,<br/>
to lease dock and park privileges for a song,<br/>
to vote hundreds of millions without knowing<br/>
what service was paid for or what service was<br/>
rendered.<br/>
<br/>
It is a mistake for a city to try to cure its<br/>
diseases of government by putting in power<br/>
men who will rely upon their integrity and<br/>
social standing rather than upon a knowledge<br/>
of the details of government. Experience has<br/>
proved conclusively that there is really nothing<br/>
about a good man that enables him intuitively<br/>
to know whether asphalt is seven inches or<br/>
three inches thick, whether specifications are<br/>
drawn for the advantage of one man, whether<br/>
money intended for vacation <span style="color: #0000FF;">schools </span>is diverted<br/>
to salaries of supervision, what the city debt is,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">BLIND </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9259<br/>
</span>or whether taxpayers get their moncy's worth<br/>
of service, comfort and health protection.<br/>
<br/>
If the Bureau's work in connection with<br/>
the Ahearn Inquiry promises more permanent<br/>
results than the moral upheavals with which<br/>
we associate past failures of good citizens to<br/>
keep their shanty in repair, it is because its<br/>
purpose is not to uncover gross scandal but<br/>
to remove the ignorance on which corruption<br/>
and inefficiency feed. Happily, too, the method<br/>
is within easy reach of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">community</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unlike </span>the moral upheaval method which gives<br/>
the great cities all the scandals, not because<br/>
our small cities have a low percentage of<br/>
corruption and inefficiency, but because a<br/>
moral upheaval in a small town seems pitifully small in comparison with a similar<br/>
"revolution" in Philadelphia, Chicago, or<br/>
New <span style="color: #0000FF;">York</span>.<br/>

<br/>
HE American people have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">liberal<br/>
</span>in their gifts to the blind. Their at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">titude </span>has been one of sincere <span style="color: #0000FF;">interest<br/>
<br/>
</span>and kindly expectation of success. There <span style="color: #ff0000;">has<br/>
</span>been generous provision to educate the <span style="color: #ff0000;">children<br/>
</span>and to surround the aged with comfort. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yet<br/>
</span>the truth forces itself upon those who <span style="color: #0000FF;">study<br/>
<br/>
</span>the problem that much remains to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">done</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>that there is some important work which has<br/>
not been even started in many of our states.<br/>
<br/>
MUCH <span style="color: #ff0000;">BLIXDNESS </span>UNNECESSARY<br/>
<br/>
To begin at the beginning, we have found<br/>
that much blindness is unnecessary, that<br/>
perhaps a third of it is the result of disease<br/>
which can be averted by timely treatment.<br/>
Then the instruction of parents and friends<br/>
in the care of blind children needs to be carried<br/>
to every corner of the country. We have before<br/>
us a long campaign of education to teach<br/>
parents that they must encourage sightless<br/>
children to romp and play and grow strong as<br/>
their seeing brothers and sisters do. Failure<br/>
to understand this, and the natural inclination<br/>
<br/>

KELLER<br/>
<br/>
to shield and pamper defective children impose<br/>
upon the schools the unnecessary burden of<br/>
straightening crooked backs and deformed<br/>
limbs and correcting nervous habits, engendered by lack of intelligent discipline at home.<br/>
The backward condition of the pupils when they<br/>
enter the schools for the blind accounts in part<br/>
for the failure of some of our institutions in<br/>
the work they are intended to do. The failure<br/>
is due partly to the inadequacy of the schools<br/>
themselves. Thus we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>need of improvement in training from babyhood to adult life;<br/>
and finally we discover a large class of adult<br/>
blind persons for whom, as yet, no provision<br/>
has been made in most American communities.<br/>
<br/>
The records recently gathered by investigators show that even the educated, industrious<br/>
blind cannot earn their living without more<br/>
special assistance than they now receive. They<br/>
are so severely handicapped throughout life<br/>
that they cannot shift for themselves. Even<br/>
after careful training and apprenticeship, they<br/>
still need help to find their place in the world<br/>
of workers, a world which often does not<br/>
