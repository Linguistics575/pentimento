<br/>
</span>tasks are so unlike save in bigness<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Curzon<br/>
might have failed in Egypt; Baring might not<br/>
have <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>the Viceroy's chair so <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span>.<br/>
Quietly, for more than twenty years, Lord<br/>
Cromer worked steadily <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>one of the world's<br/>
hard jobs-and it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>his good fortune to be<br/>
allowed to work at it so long without Cabinet<br/>
interference. It is a significant fact that<br/>
England has entrusted the fate of Egypt to<br/>
men who knew the conditions and who were<br/>
willing to stay until the work was done. Lord<br/>
Cromer has been in Egypt almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">continuously<br/>

</span>ABBAS <span style="color: #0000FF;">HILMI</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">KHEIHVE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">OF</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
As "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy</span>" of the Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Turkey, he is the nominal <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruler </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
since 1877; Sir Eldon Gorst, who succeeds<br/>
him, has been in service there since 1880;<br/>
Sir Reginald Wingate, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor-General </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Soudan, has had a part in almost every<br/>
important happening in its modern history.<br/>
"He was among the last men that saw Gordon,<br/>
he was one of those who welcomed Slatin back<br/>
to Cairo after his eleven <span style="color: #0000FF;">years</span>' captivity in the<br/>
Mahdi's country; he was with Kitchener at<br/>
Khartum; he was with him at Fashoda when<br/>
the famous interview occurred with Colonel<br/>
Marchand." But think how many Governors<br/>
we have had in Porto Rico and in the Philippines<br/>
since <span style="color: #0000FF;">1898-and </span>how many engineers in<br/>
Panama!<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>STORY OF ENGLAND IN<br/>
<br/>
EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
Since Egypt has a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive </span>of its own, and<br/>
since it belongs to a nation which has a Sultan,<br/>
how happens it <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>a British "Agent and<br/>
Consul-General" rules the land? This is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">puzzling </span>question on this side the sea, except<br/>
to those who have had some reason for following the <span style="color: #ff0000;">maze </span>of international politics.<br/>
<br/>
But it is a story of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>rather than of<br/>
politics. Americans can easily understand it<br/>
by recalling <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>similar situation closer home.<br/>
England is in Egypt for practically the same<br/>
reasons that the United States is in Cuba<br/>
to-day.<br/>
<br/>
" But we are in Cuba merely to restore order<br/>
and to protect American capital invested <span style="color: #0000FF;">there</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>"<br/>
<br/>
Exactly; and that is why England is in<br/>
Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
"But we have explicitly stated that we will<br/>
recall our troops just so soon as Cuba can<br/>
demonstrate its ability to maintain a stable<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">government</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>England issued the same explicit statement<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tommy </span>Atkins ever left the <span style="color: #0000FF;">troopship-and </span>there is no reason to doubt the sincerity<br/>
of the ministry that issued the statement.<br/>
Successive Cabinets from the time of Gladstone<br/>
on down have shown <span style="color: #0000FF;">lukewarmness </span>on the<br/>
subject of British occupation either of Egypt<br/>
or of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Soudan.<br/>
<br/>
"But <span style="color: #ff0000;">twenty-fivc </span>years have passed, and<br/>
England is in Egypt yet!"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and we are still in Cuba-and there is<br/>
none of our elder statesmen wise enough to<br/>
tell us when we will get out or how long the<br/>
Cubans will let us stay out.<br/>
<br/>
Here, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">barest </span>outline, is the story. The<br/>
details are mercifully omitted, for so good <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
</span>authority as Lord Milner remarks that "it is<br/>
not <span style="color: #0000FF;">given </span>to mortal intelligence to master at one<br/>
blow the complexities of Turkish <span style="color: #0000FF;">suzerainty </span>and<br/>
foreign treaty rights."<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1863</span>; Khedive Ismail came to the<br/>
throne, his brain throbbing with big ideas.<br/>
He was a royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">financier </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>a royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">spender<br/>
</span>rarely surpassed in history. Egypt was fairly<br/>
prosperous, with revenues sufficient to keep<br/>
the wheels turning, so Ismail found his credit<br/>
remarkably good in Europe. Everybody<br/>
wanted to lend him money, and he devised<br/>
so many ways of spending it that by the<br/>
end of thirteen years he had advanced the<br/>
national debt from about $ 15,000,000 to<br/>
$ 425,000,000<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>During this period he and De<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lesseps </span>had built the Suez Canal, the Khedive<br/>
retaining most of the shares<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
