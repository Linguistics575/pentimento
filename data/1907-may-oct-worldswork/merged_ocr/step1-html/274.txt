</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gordon </span>met his <span style="color: #0000FF;">tragic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">death</span>, was the signal <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a popular <span style="color: #0000FF;">subscription<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">England </span>to establish a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">native </span>training <span style="color: #0000FF;">school </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a memorial<br/>
<br/>
hopelessly <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrecked</span>. Popular <span style="color: #0000FF;">education</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>arts, the sciences, were unknown. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tcwlik<br/>
</span>was surrounded by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>class made up of<br/>
the most unscrupulous <span style="color: #ff0000;">seoundrels </span>that ever<br/>
cursed <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>helpless people. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cwfik </span>periodically<br/>
caught "the men higher up" by the heels and<br/>
shook them until the pockets of their capacious<br/>
bloomers were emptied of coin; the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">men<br/>
</span>higher up" then <span style="color: #0000FF;">exercised </span>the men <span style="color: #0000FF;">lower<br/>
</span>down in the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">way</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">lowest-of-alldown</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellaheen</span>, had no coin, but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">taxgathers </span>were skilled to the point of extracting<br/>
blood from a turnip. They did not come<br/>
down upon the peasant at the time of harvest<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">carry </span>away his crop; that was an old,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unscientific </span>practice. They came while his<br/>
crop <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>growing. If he could not procure<br/>
actual money, they beat him; at their next<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">visit</span>, he had the choice of the frying-pan or the<br/>

</span>It is now the seat of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor-General </span>of the Soudan<br/>

<br/>
fire. He could either sell his crop in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">field<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>half its value, or he could mortgage it to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">money-lender </span>and pay 60 per cent. interest.<br/>
The tax outlaw and the money-lender were<br/>
usually in league with one another-and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shylock </span>of Shakespeare was a philanthropic<br/>
gentleman in comparison with either.<br/>
Starvation and slavery stared every working<br/>
man in the face-and a more shameful fate<br/>
waited at the door of every young girl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Emaciated</span>, naked, filthy, the lower classes huddled<br/>
together in wretched huts, along with their<br/>
few bony goats and chickens and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Curr-a<br/>
</span>conglomerate mass of dirt and vermin, the<br/>
absolute picture of wretchedness and disease.<br/>

</span>KHARTUM FROM THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">PALACE<br/>
<br/>
</span>The contrast in <span style="color: #0000FF;">size </span>and dignity <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the Government <span style="color: #0000FF;">houses<br/>
</span>and the houses of the governed illustrates the English trait of<br/>
magnifying the majesty of the law in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eyes </span>of the natives<br/>
<br/>
There was scarcely a semblance of the human<br/>
left in them: there was less of the human in<br/>
their oppressors. Simple justice and "a square<br/>
deal" were dreams as remote as the Paradise<br/>
of Mohammed.<br/>
<br/>
Major Baring knew all these distressing<br/>
facts, and more, when he took up his work<br/>
at the beginning of 1884. He knew also that<br/>
the task of cleaning up the land was not the<br/>
worst of it. There was a Parliament across<br/>
the water that might stop him at any moment;<br/>
there was a concert of fifteen Powers whose<br/>
consent must often be obtained before important steps could be taken; there were European<br/>
<br/>
