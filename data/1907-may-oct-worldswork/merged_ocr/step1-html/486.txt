<br/>
ducted as to be free of "fads" and above the<br/>
suspicion of mere private gain. Along with<br/>
this conception of right living and of guarding<br/>
against disease, we ought to develop practitioners of prevention, prescribers of modes of<br/>
life according to individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the application to agriculture of the<br/>
facts that have been demonstrated over and<br/>
over again and that are not yet in general use<br/>
would enable many men, perhaps most men,<br/>
who now till the soil, to double their yields.<br/>
Yet the teaching of the farmers who are themselves now tilling the earth has been hardly<br/>
begun. These facts, for example, have been<br/>
proved time and again: By the expenditure of<br/>
one per cent. more-of <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">101 </span>where $ 100 is now<br/>
spent-the dairyman who has common cows<br/>
could get a breed of cows that would yield<br/>
from 10 per cent. to 25 per cent. more milk or<br/>
butter. The same will hold good of wheat-common wheat as against wheat of a good<br/>
variety. The labor is the same in each<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these tasks require community of<br/>
action. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hey </span>require a degree of cooperation<br/>
that we have not developed yet. A sufficiently<br/>
compact organization and cooperation of society<br/>
would enable us to eliminate an enormous<br/>
number of economic wastes that we endure only<br/>
by reason of habit.<br/>
<br/>
It will become one of the evidences of public<br/>
spirit in men and in bodies of men that they<br/>
turn their attention to such tasks. The Merchants' Association of New York had not the<br/>
slightest idea, when it was organized, that it<br/>
would ever consider it a part of its business to<br/>
set about the possible extermination of house<br/>
flies; and yet it would be hard to find a greater<br/>
public service that it could do.<br/>
<br/>
We have hitherto left comprehensive plans<br/>
for the practical betterment of groups or communities of people either to the commercial<br/>
interests of inventors (a perfectly good method<br/>
as far as it goes) or to the impractical and<br/>
badly managed experiments of the builders of<br/>
Utopias or of "colonies," who have burdened<br/>
the real work of betterment with a lot of theories<br/>
and doctrines. There is an indefinite <span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>of<br/>
work in furthering the practical application<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>knowledge for all sorts of organizations. If a great association of merchants in New York think it worth their while<br/>
to attack flies, any practical organization of<br/>
men or women may find similar tasks near at<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
THE MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
THE PHYSICAL CONSCIENCE<br/>
<br/>
IN A noteworthy review of the attention<br/>
<br/>
given to some form of physical culture in<br/>
almost all countries, Dr. Richard Cole Newton<br/>
says in The Popular Science M <span style="color: #ff0000;">onthly</span>:<br/>
<br/>
"In nearly every quarter of the earth, pagan and Christian alike, are to be perceived unmistakable signs of the<br/>
approach of a general'physical renaissance such as the<br/>
world has only seen twice, or perhaps thrice, and which<br/>
preceded the most brilliant periods in the intellectual history<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>mankind.' In spite of the lamentations which we so<br/>
often hear of the sordidness and vulgarity of modern life,<br/>
of the brazen display of wealth and the venality of public<br/>
men, there are not wanting signs that the tide is setting in<br/>
toward a higher and nobler manhood and a purer, simpler,<br/>
and more wholesome life; and not the least of these signs<br/>
is the evidence gathered from many different sources that<br/>
the physical conscience is again, after slumbering for 2,000<br/>
years, awakening and asserting itself, and will rule the<br/>
world again as it did in ancient Greece.<br/>
<br/>
"If the coming man will listen to its voice, it will lead him<br/>
into'a civilization that will surpass that of Greece by as<br/>
much as the present age surpasses that of Pericles in the<br/>
solid progress of the sciences and their application to the<br/>
useful arts.<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>"<br/>
<br/>
Some of the facts that warrant this cheerful<br/>
outlook are the sane and <span style="color: #0000FF;">wcll-balanced </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">attention </span>that all the leading peoples of the world are<br/>
giving to physical training for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">masses-physical </span>training as a necessary aid to efficiency<br/>
and to health. Consider the change in our own<br/>
country. Eighty years ago there was not a<br/>
college gymnasium in the United States. Today hardly a college can be found without one.<br/>
A large part of our cities employ physical<br/>
training teachers in the public schools. Even<br/>
the Sunday Schools have "athletic leagues."<br/>
The attendance at the gymnasia of the Young<br/>
Men's Christian Associations in the United<br/>
States has increased from 50,000 to more than<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">50,000 </span>in ten years. The same tendency is<br/>
shown also in the Young Women's Christian<br/>
Associations. Dr. Newton declares that "the<br/>
city of Philadelphia alone spends more resources<br/>
and employs more agents in the interests of<br/>
public health to-day than did the whole <span style="color: #ff0000;">Englishspeaking </span>world a century ago." Chicago has<br/>
more than 73 acres of playgrounds, Philadelphia 110, Brooklyn 40, Boston 200.<br/>
<br/>
All this is matched and much of it surpassed<br/>
in some other countries. In fact, nearly all<br/>
modern nations are turning their social and<br/>
educational forces in the same <span style="color: #ff0000;">direetion-Germany</span>, Sweden, and Japan in particular.<br/>
<br/>
How long it has taken the Christian part of<br/>
mankind to recover from the medieval <span style="color: #ff0000;">concep<br/>
<br/>
