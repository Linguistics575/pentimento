"For," he went on, "bridges will be here all<br/>
our lives, during the lives of our children and<br/>
of their children and of their children, as long<br/>
as this shall be a city. Every house now standing here may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">torn </span>down or <span style="color: #0000FF;">modified</span>, for<br/>
most buildings are temporary. But a road<br/>
and a bridge are eternal things. They will<br/>
remain as long as the stream runs.<br/>
<br/>
"Here is a chance, then, to construct one of<br/>
the most beautiful things in the world, perhaps<br/>
the best chance that the city affords. If we<br/>
had been patient and wise enough to have made<br/>
bridges that should be beautiful, we should<br/>
have added to the charm of our city for ever.<br/>
This was a great opportunity lost."<br/>
<br/>
The feeling of this man is the feeling of the<br/>
art societies-the American Institute of Architects, the Fine Arts Federation and the Society<br/>
of Beaux Arts-which have appointed a committee to petition Congress to establish a<br/>
Federal Department of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fine </span>Arts, the head of<br/>
which shall be a member of the President's<br/>
Cabinet. The Department should have "supervision of government works, the erection of<br/>
public buildings, the laying out of national<br/>
parks, the establishment of museums and<br/>
galleries in various cities, the acquirement of<br/>
works of art and the stimulation of universities<br/>
and colleges in the education of art."<br/>
<br/>
This is a very comprehensive programme<br/>
which will encounter many practical objections,<br/>
and it is not likely to be carried out in this<br/>
form or perhaps in any form at any early time.<br/>
But there is a profitable field for popular<br/>
education up to an appreciation of this purpose.<br/>
Within a generation or two the United States<br/>
might surpass any land in the world in the<br/>
beauty of its public works and places, if we<br/>
should go about it right; for we are just beginning an era of ambitious and, to a degree,<br/>
permanent construction.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>ABOLITION <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DISEASE<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IT </span>IS EASY, following the analogy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">some<br/>
</span>foreign <span style="color: #0000FF;">governments</span>, to suggest the<br/>
creation of additional departments of our<br/>
national <span style="color: #ff0000;">governnient </span>with new members of the<br/>
President<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>Cabinet as their heads. But there<br/>
are few innovations more difficult to bring<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
But the movement, which has lately gathered<br/>
much force, to'extend the powers and duties<br/>
and responsibilities of the Government in guarding the public health, is likely to lead-if not<br/>
to a Department with representation in the<br/>
<br/>
MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
Cabinet-to a wider range of governmental<br/>
activity; and there is no other such extension<br/>
of public activity for which so strong an <span style="color: #ff0000;">art</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">trment </span>can be made.<br/>
<br/>
In one of the most instructive books of recent<br/>
years, "The Kingdom of Man," Professor<br/>
E. Ray Lankester, the foremost of English<br/>
biologists, makes it plain that civilized governments must increase their activity in combating<br/>
diseases, especially in preventing them. There<br/>
is no other agency that can do the task adequately, because no other agency can exercise<br/>
control over masses of people.<br/>
<br/>
"Within the past few years," he writes, "the knowledge<br/>
of the causes of disease has become so far advanced that<br/>
it is a matter of practical certainty that, by unstinted<br/>
application of known methods of investigation and consequent controlling action, all epidemic disease could be<br/>
abolished within a period <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>short as <span style="color: #ff0000;">ffty </span>years. It is merely<br/>
a question of the employment of the means at our command.<br/>
Where there is one man of first-rate intelligence employed<br/>
in detecting the disease-producing parasites, their special<br/>
conditions of life and the way to bring them to an end,<br/>
there should be a thousand. It should be as much the<br/>
purpose of civilized governments to protect their citizens<br/>
in this respect as it is to provide defence against human<br/>
aggression. Yet it is the fact that this immensely important<br/>
control of a great and constant danger and injury to mankind is left to the unorganized inquiries of a few enthusiasts.<br/>
So little is this matter understood or appreciated, that<br/>
those who are responsible for the welfare of states, with the<br/>
rarest exceptions, do not even know that such protection<br/>
is possible."<br/>
<br/>
He goes on:<br/>
<br/>
"The explanation is that the masses of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>, in<br/>
civilized as well as uncivilized countries, are not yet aware<br/>
of the situation. When knowledge on this matter reaches,<br/>
as it inevitably will in time, to the general population, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>certain that the democracy will demand that those who<br/>
expend the resources of the community, and, as government<br/>
officials. undertake the organization of the national defence<br/>
and other great public services for the common good,<br/>
shall put into practice the power of Nature-control which<br/>
has been gained by mankind, and shall exert every sinew<br/>
to obtain more<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To effect this, the democracy will demand<br/>
that those who carry on public affairs shall not be persons<br/>
solely acquainted with the elegant fancies and stories of<br/>
past ages, but shall be trained in the acquisition of natural<br/>
knowledge and keenly active in the skilful application of<br/>
Nature-control to the development of the well-being of<br/>
the community."<br/>
<br/>
The growing organization to carry this very<br/>
idea into action is securing the support of<br/>
influential men of all callings.<br/>
