<span>MEXICO <span style="color: #ff0000;">AT<br/>
<br/>
</span>Nearly all of it comes to us, and of late we<br/>
have been buying about $ 15,000,000 worth<br/>
each year. As to coffee, we bought <span style="color: #ff0000;">24,6oo</span>, ooo<br/>
pounds from Mexico last year, an increase of<br/>
3,000,000, though our total importations fell<br/>
off by 200,000,000 pounds. Of tobacco we<br/>
took $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">2,000,000 </span>worth; of vanilla, $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">4,000,000<br/>
</span>Then there is sugar cane, which next to cotton<br/>
is developing fastest as an industry. The<br/>
demand for sugar has grown so during the past<br/>
five years that even the peons no longer regard<br/>
it as a luxury, and consequently the sugar<br/>
business is creating a place for itself near the<br/>
top. There are sugar mills, equipped with<br/>
American machinery, throughout the cane<br/>
districts, and sugar even figures on the export<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Wheat, corn, and breadstuffs must still be<br/>
imported, but the area of cultivation is constantly widening, owing to the introduction of<br/>
modern American farming implements.<br/>
Hitherto much of the virgin soil was not broken<br/>
because of the crude facilities, but now the<br/>
land is increasing in value, and is also becoming more thickly settled. Mexico has<br/>
many flour mills, but as yet it must buy about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2,000,000 </span>in wheat from us each year to keep<br/>
them running at their full capacity all the time.<br/>
<br/>
A REVOLUTION IN FARMING<br/>
<br/>
Though this is Mexico, and a farm is a domain, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unit </span>of land measurement is<br/>
more than 4,000 acres, yet progress is at work<br/>
even here to make the acre produce more.<br/>
Mexico has always had irrigation, though not<br/>
on the stupendous modern scale that reclaims<br/>
deserts. But immense irrigation schemes are<br/>
now under way, particularly in the arid north.<br/>
The President recently authorized an <span style="color: #0000FF;">expenditure </span>of $ 5,000,000 for one in Coahuila.<br/>
Another, in Hidalgo, made possible three crops<br/>
in two years. In some districts three crops of<br/>
corn are gathered in one year. Mexico is also<br/>
looking into dry farming to bring its millions<br/>
of barren acres into the national assets. Soil<br/>
inoculation proves especially effective. One<br/>
expert, Zeferino Dominguez, who has a model<br/>
farm in Puebla, cultivated the bacteria that<br/>
supply the frijole bean with nitrogen, then<br/>
made a solution in which he soaked the frijole<br/>
seeds. Thus he increased the number of pods<br/>
for each vine to four hundred, as against sixty<br/>
and eighty ordinarily. He maintains that he<br/>
can triple the production of Mexico's haciendas.<br/>
<br/>
Now let us come to the invasion of the<br/>
<br/>
HIGH-TIDE 9195<br/>
American cowboy. At home the wire fence<br/>
has lost him his paradise, but on the vast ranges<br/>
of Chihuahua he finds it again. Here the<br/>
barbed wire, the sheep man, the homesteader,<br/>
may never shorten his horizon. From Mexico<br/>
the cattle business first crept into the United<br/>
States, and now from the United States it is<br/>
going back again, but on the big American<br/>
scale. Ranches are of the size of kingdoms.<br/>
There is one of 17,000,000 acres; another of<br/>
5,000,000; a third, owned by an American<br/>
company, of 2,000,000; a fourth, Canadian,<br/>
of 1,000,000. One syndicate of Americans<br/>
owns 4,000 square miles. And to improve<br/>
the stock on these vast ranges, carloads of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">purebred </span>American cattle and horses are coming in every week, so great is the demand.<br/>
<br/>
TRADE <span style="color: #0000FF;">WITH </span>THE UNITED STATES<br/>
<br/>
This last item suggests how, the more <span style="color: #ff0000;">selfsustaining </span>a country becomes, the more dependent it is. Mexico's bill of goods is <span style="color: #0000FF;">constantly </span>growing. It bought $ 42,000,000 more<br/>
in 1906 than in 1905 and required $ 38,178,000<br/>
more in metals, including mining machinery,<br/>
which it got from us. Because of new mining<br/>
development, there prevails almost a famine<br/>
in machinery and tools. The American factories are about six months behind with orders;<br/>
and as to steel rails, of which Mexico will need<br/>
millions, we have practically abandoned it<br/>
to Europe. But the attitude of our steel barons<br/>
is not altogether due to the overrush. They<br/>
fear tariff speeches, and desire to give no such<br/>
provocation as underbidding Europeans in a<br/>
foreign market and selling at from five to ten<br/>
dollars less per ton than they ask in the United<br/>
States. They would rather wait until after<br/>
the next campaign. But as to rolling stock,<br/>
we are not so reluctant. We are hurrying<br/>
locomotives and freight and passenger cars into<br/>
Mexico at a fast clip.<br/>
<br/>
But in all lines of foreign commerce Mexico's<br/>
last fiscal year showed a proportion of increase<br/>
unprecedented for any country. The increase<br/>
of imports was 23.83 per cent; of exports,<br/>
30.03 per cent. But though its exports increased the most, and though the balance of<br/>
trade was in its favor and slightly against us<br/>
the year before, yet the balance was in our<br/>
favor this last year. In other words, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">absorbed </span>all the increase in its imports, and more<br/>
too. As against all countries combined, last<br/>
year it had a balance in its favor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">25,000,000</span>,<br/>
and yet there <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a balance in our favor of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
