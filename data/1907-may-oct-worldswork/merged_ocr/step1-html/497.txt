</span>THE STREET RAILWAY IN <span style="color: #ff0000;">1898<br/>
<br/>
</span>The horse-cars of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mayaguez </span>were the only street-cars <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the<br/>
island. Each car could accommodate 16 passengers<br/>
<br/>
next step will be the erection of country <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolhouses</span>. Progress in this direction has been<br/>
blocked by the inability to secure titles to the<br/>
necessary lands, but this obstacle has at last<br/>
been cleared away.<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1898 </span>there were about 500 alleged schools,<br/>
conducted in rented rooms, supervised by local<br/>
boards, some of whose members could not<br/>
have passed a primary school examination.<br/>
The teachers were far behind the times, were<br/>
poorly paid-when paid at all-and ranked low<br/>
in the community. The families of the better<br/>
classes were <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>permitted and then expected<br/>
to pay tuition, so <span style="color: #ff0000;">that </span>free public instruction<br/>
had become <span style="color: #0000FF;">pauperized</span>. Girls were not<br/>
allowed to go to schools attended by boys; if<br/>
the town could not maintain two schools, the<br/>
girls stayed at home. Of fourteen <span style="color: #0000FF;">rural<br/>
</span>schools at that time, not one <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>school for<br/>
girls.<br/>
<br/>
The story of the education of yesterday is<br/>
suggested by Dr. H. K. Carroll's report of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

This is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">ox-cart </span>of an improved type, but the oxen are still <span style="color: #ff0000;">yoked<br/>

</span>A STREET RAILWAY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TO-UAV<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">American </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">trulley-cars </span>are now running in Ponce and San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Juan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>

<br/>
visit to a public school in San Juan shortly<br/>
after the Spanish sailed away:<br/>
<br/>
"The room was on the second floor, front<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It was<br/>
fitted up with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>number of maps. There were also<br/>
charts for the purpose of <span style="color: #0000FF;">teaching </span>arithmetic, cases of<br/>
insects, numerous moral maxims, a small desk <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>primitive manufacture, and several tiers of rough benches for<br/>
the children. On two opposite walls were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crucifixes..<br/>
<br/>
</span>Two male teachers were in charge of the school...<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The children were all clothed."<br/>
<br/>
Four years later, the superintendent of the<br/>
San Juan district made the following report of<br/>
a public school in the same locality; it tells<br/>
the story of the education of to-day:<br/>
<br/>
"The <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Emerson </span>School, on Cruz Street, San Juan,<br/>
of 9 <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>was opened on time, fully equipped.<br/>
Each room is furnished with modern pupils' desks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">teacher's<br/>
</span>desk, chairs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">book-case</span>, waste-basket, call bell, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive </span>blackboard space<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>latrines are on each <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>school, <span style="color: #0000FF;">r-including </span>the principal-are Porto Ricans;<br/>
the other 4 are Americans."<br/>
