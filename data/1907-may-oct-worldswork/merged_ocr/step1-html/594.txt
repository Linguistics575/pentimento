and was a plain and proper statement. But<br/>
a part of the pamphlet was made up of a<br/>
recital of events with the purpose to show that<br/>
the whole Administration at Washington has<br/>
conspired, in most sensational ways, to hound<br/>
the Standard Oil Company. This was a mistake---a mistake of a piece with Judge Landis's<br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
As the matter now stands in the public mind,<br/>
therefore, a United States judge has done a<br/>
sensational and apparently vindictive thing;<br/>
and the Standard Oil Company has tried to<br/>
prove to the public that the whole Administration is vindictively pursuing it. The sensational part of the public may take a morbid<br/>
pleasure in this situation. But thoughtful<br/>
American citizens deplore it because the courts<br/>
must administer exact justice. They are our<br/>
chief organized safeguards against <span style="color: #ff0000;">mobjudgments</span>. Every thoughtful man wishes the<br/>
Standard Oil Company, and every other<br/>
accused company and individual, to establish<br/>
its innocence of wrong-doing, if it has done no<br/>
wrong, and to be brought to proper punishment<br/>
if it has done wrong. But we have no place<br/>
in American life for vindictiveness, least of all<br/>
in courts of justice; and by the same token an<br/>
accusation of vindictiveness on the part of the<br/>
Government, made <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>defendant in the courts,<br/>
is in bad taste; it arouses bad blood, it shows<br/>
bad judgment, and the course of exact justice<br/>
and of ultimate sound judgments by the people<br/>
is thereby made more difficult.<br/>

THE LONG CRUISE OF THE NAVY<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span>LONG cruise of the greater part of <span style="color: #0000FF;">our<br/>
</span>Navy is to be begun about the middle<br/>
of December. Sixteen battle-ships, under the<br/>
command of Rear-Admiral Evans, and a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ilotilla </span>of six destroyers will steam around<br/>
South America, up the Pacific to San Francisco,<br/>
where the very considerable Pacific squadron<br/>
will meet them, thence possibly to Puget Sound,<br/>
thence to the Philippines, and (if a yet unconfirmed report be true) through the Suez Canal<br/>
back to our Atlantic waters. Such a journey<br/>
even as the sail around South America by such<br/>
a fleet of such ships has never yet been made.<br/>
They will make friendly calls of several days<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>each of the principal ports on the voyage,<br/>
and they will spend a month in target-practice<br/>
in the Pacific before they reach San Francisco<br/>
--<span style="color: #ff0000;">isarly </span>in April<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>This announcement has been received somewhat hysterically by a part of the press, on the<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
assumption that this voyage is meant to be a<br/>
boastful notice to the world, and to Japan in<br/>
particular, that we are in fighting trim. Such<br/>
an assumption is gratuitous. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government </span>and the naval officers of every Power in<br/>
the world know perfectly well the size, the<br/>
armament, and the condition of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting<br/>
</span>ship that we have. Assembling them and<br/>
forming one huge fleet will not give any government on earth a single item of information<br/>
that it does not now possess.<br/>
<br/>
So far from witnessing such a fleet with fear,<br/>
every South American government will be<br/>
pleased by a visit from it, and our officers will<br/>
be received everywhere with the greatest <span style="color: #0000FF;">cordiality </span>and everywhere they will carry friendly<br/>
greeting. When they reach our own Pacific<br/>
coast, they will be greeted with the greatest<br/>
enthusiasm. The pride that the people take<br/>
in the Navy-have those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacific<br/>
</span>States not as clear a right to it as those<br/>
of the Atlantic States? Moreover, the ships<br/>
must be in motion somewhere most of the time,<br/>
for practice and discipline; and a continuous<br/>
voyage of many thousand miles, for these<br/>
purposes, does not greatly differ from many<br/>
shorter voyages up and down our Atlantic<br/>
coast. In regard to practice<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and discipline,<br/>
the sailing of a big fleet will have some advantages over the corresponding work of small<br/>
squadrons.<br/>
<br/>
As for boasting or warlike demonstration,<br/>
that may be left out of all calm comment. No<br/>
nation now has any thought of war with the<br/>
United States, nor have we any thought of war<br/>
with any nation. But if there were any such<br/>
thought or fear-let us say of war with Japan--the presence of this great fleet in the Pacific<br/>
would be the best possible reason for Japan's<br/>
hesitation. That remote silliness apart, the<br/>
voyage will remind our own people, and the<br/>
rest of the world as well, that we have two great<br/>
oceans instead of one, and that our interests<br/>
in the Pacific from Panama to Bering Strait<br/>
and thence to Manila are important interests.<br/>
Americans are at home in all these regions;<br/>
the Navy is theirs, quite as much as it is the<br/>
people's of the Atlantic States; and, since we<br/>
are at peace with all the world, securely and<br/>
indefinitely, there are no reasons of danger<br/>
why our warships should forever hug our <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eastern </span>shore. Jefferson wished to have a navy<br/>
that might be drawn ashore on the flats of the<br/>
Potomac between wars; and this notion does<br/>
not seem yet to have become wholly obsolete.<br/>
