<span>WHAT FRANCE CAN TEACH US<br/>
<br/>
by governmental influence until it has become<br/>
a national attribute." And yet this, too, is<br/>
easy of comprehension, once you gain a broad<br/>
conception of artistic taste. It isn't merely<br/>
the appreciation of beauty in what we call the<br/>
fine arts-as if no other arts were fine! It is<br/>
also the appreciation of charm and grace and<br/>
excellence in all the things that make life agreeable, as well as an appreciation of noble qualities in all the work of a man's hands. Because<br/>
of the agreeableness of human existence in<br/>
France, Frenchmen loathe the thought of<br/>
emigration; consequently, notwithstanding an<br/>
appallingly low birth-rate, the country's population has not declined. Because of the<br/>
agreeableness of human existence in France,<br/>
vast hordes of tourists and sojourners <span style="color: #0000FF;">flock<br/>
</span>thither to spend lavishly. Because of the rare<br/>
artistic feeling put into manufactured articles,<br/>
France maintains an immense export trade<br/>
despite all the hostile efforts of rival nations.<br/>
In these ways taste is minted into money.<br/>
<br/>
Barring the absenteeism of the "exposed"<br/>
and the idle, we are as yet in no danger from<br/>
emigration; our problem is immigration, and<br/>
it is a problem because only the lower classes<br/>
of Europeans come in large numbers to America.<br/>
The upper classes avoid us. They have no<br/>
ambition to settle here, extremely little ambition to travel here; and this is largely because<br/>
we have in many respects made American life<br/>
disagreeable-causing our surroundings to rob<br/>
us of the comfort and convenience and artistic<br/>
satisfaction so common in Europe and so<br/>
profitable.<br/>
<br/>
Look, for instance, at our business streets.<br/>
When an American, a patriotic American, an<br/>
American who wants to see his country surpass<br/>
the most admirable achievements of the Old<br/>
World, comes home from France and again<br/>
threads the commercial thoroughfares that<br/>
correspond to the Grand Boulevards of Paris,<br/>
he gets a curious shock of disappointment.<br/>
The stately buildings are here, looking fully<br/>
as grand as before his European rovings;<br/>
perhaps a dozen new ones have risen up in his<br/>
absence-and he is proud of their architectural magnificence; but still he feels a strange<br/>
sense of something missing, something the<br/>
French city possesses and the American city<br/>
hasn't yet attained. What is that something?<br/>
Fine rows of trees in the down-town streets.<br/>
<br/>
People talk as if trees would not grow in a<br/>
business street, and certainly they will not and<br/>
do not, treated as we treat them. If you were<br/>
<br/>
9119<br/>
<br/>
a tree, and the sidewalk shut away the water<br/>
from your <span style="color: #0000FF;">roots </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>over here-you<br/>
would swear a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">arboreal </span>oaths, struggle for<br/>
life a year or so, and then wither and die. If,<br/>
however, your trunk were encircled by a huge,<br/>
round grating, like a church register six feet<br/>
across, the moisture would keep you lusty.<br/>
It is by this simple arrangement, chiefly, that<br/>
the Grand Boulevards maintain their wealth<br/>
of greenery.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing the returned traveler misses<br/>
is flowers. Where are the floral embellishments for theatre fronts, restaurants, and<br/>
shops-the urns, the window-boxes, the gorgeous hanging baskets? A society in Paris<br/>
offers prizes for the handsomest flowered balconies. When a tradesman wants to make<br/>
his establishment conspicuous, he dresses it<br/>
up in the gayest blossoms obtainable.<br/>
<br/>
And yet a commercial thoroughfare wants<br/>
something more than adornment; it also demands the removal-or at least the mitigation<br/>
-of disfigurements. In Paris, the telegraph<br/>
pole is a thing unknown. So, in general, is<br/>
the trolley-pole. And advertising-that gravest<br/>
menace to municipal beauty-shrinks to its<br/>
lowest terms. Instead of letting the billposter cover an enormous flat surface, as we<br/>
do, the French roll the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>surface up into a<br/>
cylinder, thus producing what they call the<br/>
advertising pillar. In this way they reduce its<br/>
diameter by more than half, while the pillar<br/>
itself has a decorative canopy top, within which<br/>
a ring of lights gleams prettily at night and<br/>
illumines the posters. Equally ingenious is<br/>
the six-sided kiosk, quite picturesque in outline and fitted with panels of translucent glass<br/>
carrying advertisements. The kiosk becomes<br/>
a tool-house for street-cleaners' brooms and<br/>
shovels, and after dark it is lighted from within.<br/>
<br/>
But it is in restraining the hideous atrocities<br/>
of the elevated railway that the French display<br/>
their finest originality. The Parisian "El"<br/>
avoids the noblest streets, yet even there it<br/>
would be infinitely less a curse than its Amercan prototype. It has ornamental stone pillars and, wherever possible, a screen of foliage<br/>
on either side so that you seem almost to be<br/>
spinning through a forest as you ride.<br/>
<br/>
All such mitigations of ugliness, as well as<br/>
the manifold intelligent efforts at embellishment, Paris owes in a great measure to its<br/>
artists. The French do not regard an artist<br/>
as a sentimental madman: they respect him<br/>
and get work out of him. When war <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
