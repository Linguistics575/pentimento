<span>THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION<br/>
<br/>
Thomas Jefferson was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>American to<br/>
advocate the study of Anglo-Saxon. The<br/>
late Professor Thomas R. Price was one of the<br/>
first to give English its proper place in the<br/>
college curriculum, and his pupils whom he<br/>
inspired to take <span style="color: #ff0000;">advanceo </span>ork in German<br/>
universities were the first Americans to project<br/>
a series of Anglo-Saxon texts. Sidney Lanier<br/>
indicated with rare insight and enthusiasm<br/>
the importance of the study of English literature, and left behind some brilliant excursions<br/>
into the realm of philosophical criticism. His<br/>
letters and his lectures at Johns Hopkins<br/>
University entitle him to the praise of doing<br/>
for the study of English literature what Longfellow and Lowell, over a much longer stretch<br/>
of time, did for French and German.<br/>
<br/>
The standard biography and the definitive<br/>
edition of Edgar Allan Poe are the work of<br/>
Professor Harrison of the University of Virginia.<br/>
Most significant was Professor Trent's work<br/>
at the University of the South. A man of wide<br/>
reading in classical and modern literature, a<br/>
prodigious worker, a writer of exceptional<br/>
power, he was a teacher of much inspiration,<br/>
and established himself, while still at Sewanee,<br/>
Tenn., as one of the best literary critics of the<br/>
country. Through the Sewanee Review, he<br/>
not only published his own writings, but was<br/>
the means of inspiring other Southern scholars<br/>
to write on Southern literature and other vital<br/>
subjects. In his life of William Gilmore Simms,<br/>
a Southerner made for the first time a critical<br/>
study of Southern literature before the war,<br/>
and at the same time an incisive and philosophical presentation of certain phases of antebellum life. Although the book met at the<br/>
time with abuse at the hands of conservative and<br/>
sensitive Southerners, some of the best friends<br/>
of the University of the South going so far as<br/>
to demand the author's resignation, it has been<br/>
generally recognized as a work of first-rate<br/>
importance. Some of his most important<br/>
contentions were that the ante-bellum South<br/>
was "the least-favored section of all America<br/>
for successful literary work," that "no nation<br/>
or section will ever get a literature by shrieking<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the-national </span>and the sectional, and not<br/>
praying for the true and the beautiful," that<br/>
the Southern poet was "too easy-going to<br/>
succeed in any form of verse that required patience and skill," for he "relied on inspiration,<br/>
not on hard work," and that Simms did not<br/>
attain to the results that his genius promised.<br/>

With the same desire to approach the subject of the South's literature <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>a scientific<br/>
standpoint, the late Professor Baskervill, of<br/>
Vanderbilt University, published just <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>his<br/>
death a volume on the new school of Southern<br/>
writers. Agreeing with Professor Trent in<br/>
his estimate of ante-bellum literature, he<br/>
hailed with gladness the appearance of the<br/>
writers of fiction and poetry who began their<br/>
work under new conditions in an atmosphere<br/>
of freedom and nationalism.<br/>
<br/>
Maurice Thompson once said that the space<br/>
between the literature of the South before the<br/>
war and that which is before us now is not "the<br/>
mere space of time which separates them. It<br/>
is measured by a finer reckoning than the<br/>
counting of years." Without going into any<br/>
elaborate comparison between the literature of<br/>
the two periods, or without giving even a <span style="color: #0000FF;">summary </span>of the work of the new school of writers,<br/>
I merely suggest some of the more significant<br/>
phases of what may be called a literary movement. There was in the South immediately<br/>
after the war a demand, sometimes vociferously<br/>
expressed, for a distinctive "Southern" literature. Magazines were started in many Southern cities, publishing houses were projected<br/>
either in the South or in the North for the express purpose of promoting the sale of Southern<br/>
books, and there were many men and women<br/>
who wrote with the avowed aim of setting the<br/>
South right before the world. Some wrote out of<br/>
their extreme poverty. There was a deluge<br/>
of poems, sentimental and morbid; <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>reminiscences carelessly put together; of histories written without reliance on documentary<br/>
material; of fiction highly romantic and sensational; and text-books written because the<br/>
South could "no longer trust the mental and<br/>
moral training of sons and daughters to teachers<br/>
and books imported from abroad." The idea<br/>
was that, as the world was all against us,<br/>
patriotic men should now come forth to justify<br/>
the Southern point of view.<br/>
<br/>
THE NEW SOUTHERN LITERATURE<br/>
<br/>
About 1875 there began to appear in Northern magazines short stories and poems which<br/>
were of a distinctly different quality. The real<br/>
Southern literature-or better American literature in the South-came almost without observation, when men began to describe in a<br/>
simple and yet artistic way the human life about<br/>
them. Irwin Russell, listening to an old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Negro<br/>
