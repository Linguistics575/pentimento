<span>8856 <span style="color: #0000FF;">PRICK</span>, THE SILENT<br/>
<br/>
was settled out of court. By mutual agreement a new company was formed to settle, by<br/>
a redistribution of stock, the relative interests<br/>
of all the partners. This corporation was<br/>
named The Carnegie Company, and its stocks<br/>
and bonds, consisting of $ 160,000,000 of each,<br/>
were issued to Mr. Frick and the debtor partners, as well as to Mr. Carnegie, upon the basis<br/>
of their proportionate interest in the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">company</span>. This stroke <span style="color: #ff0000;">made </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>the young <span style="color: #ff0000;">geniuses</span>"<br/>
millionaires overnight. It made Mr. Frick<br/>
one of the wealthiest men in the United States,<br/>
for his share was worth at par, roughly,<br/>
$ 15,484,000 in stocks and <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">15,800,000 </span>in<br/>
bonds.<br/>
<br/>
These events occurred in 1900. A few<br/>
months later Mr. Frick's pride received another<br/>
blow. The great scheme he had cherished of<br/>
a reorganized steel industry was put through,<br/>
but under Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carnegie</span>'s direction and by one<br/>
of Mr. Carnegie's adherents. Mr. Charles M.<br/>
Schwab arranged another dinner with Mr.<br/>
Morgan and other New York bankers, and<br/>
his eloquence succeeded where Mr. Frick's<br/>
had failed. He painted a more glowing picture<br/>
than Mr. Frick's of the wonders of a consolidated steel industry. His eloquence won<br/>
the imagination of Mr. Morgan, and he undertook to finance the scheme. The result was<br/>
the United States Steel Corporation, organized<br/>
in 1901, with Charles M. Schwab as president,<br/>
to take over all the holdings of The Carnegie<br/>
Company and to include many independent<br/>
steel concerns of the country. The great<br/>
edifice of steel was finished, but it was what<br/>
Mr. Carnegie had intended it to be, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">monument </span>to himself.<br/>
<br/>
The one consolation to Mr. Frick was that<br/>
his fortune was doubled by the deal. For his<br/>
$ 31,000,000 of stocks and bonds in The<br/>
Carnegie Company, he received, roughly,<br/>
United States Steel stocks worth at par<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">45,500,000</span>, and bonds worth $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">15,800,000</span>,<br/>
or about $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">61,300,000 </span>in all.<br/>
<br/>
FOLLOWING MR. CARNEGIE'S TRAIL<br/>
<br/>
But Mr. Frick was not done with Mr.<br/>
Carnegie. He would yet shatter the Carnegie<br/>
dream of an enduring monument in steel. He<br/>
established New York headquarters, which<br/>
to-day are in the name of Mr. S. L. Schoonmaker, with whom he was once associated in<br/>
the coke business in Pittsburg. In 1903, when<br/>
the general decline in stocks carried down the<br/>
value of the United States Steel Corporation's<br/>
<br/>
securities, Mr. Frick bought heavily into them.<br/>
He emerged from what seemed to Wall Street<br/>
to be a speculative campaign with enough<br/>
United States Steel stocks in his control to<br/>
make him a first-class power in its direction.<br/>
<br/>
His next move was to compass the downfall<br/>
of Charles M. Schwab, who as president <span style="color: #0000FF;">personified </span>the Carnegie preeminence. In this<br/>
he succeeded, though he could not prevent<br/>
the election of another Carnegie man, W. E.<br/>
Corey, to the presidency. But he has succeeded<br/>
in making Wall Street and steel men realize<br/>
that, though Mr. Corey is in name the head of<br/>
the corporation and directs its routine details,<br/>
Mr. Frick is the genius whose will shapes the<br/>
policies and commands the destinies of the<br/>
steel industry of the country. And he has<br/>
succeeded further in creating the belief that it<br/>
will not be long before his power will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>to bring him to the front publicly as the<br/>
successor to the title of the Steel King. When<br/>
he has finally wrested this title from Mr.<br/>
Carnegie, one of Mr. Frick's deepest wounds<br/>
will be healed. He will have wiped out what<br/>
he believes to be the humiliation that Mr.<br/>
Carnegie inflicted upon him.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Frick has followed the Carnegie trail<br/>
in another curious fashion. The first modern<br/>
office building in Pittsburg was erected by Mr.<br/>
Carnegie about 1900. He named it the Carnegie Building. It occupies an imposing site<br/>
on Fifth Avenue, near the crest of the hill<br/>
crowned by the Allegheny County Courthouse.<br/>
The Frick Building, completed in 1904, towers<br/>
above the Carnegie Building on the next lots<br/>
up the hill, and shuts off the light from one side<br/>
of the Carnegie Building. The Frick <span style="color: #0000FF;">Building </span>is of noticeably finer finish; it has only<br/>
Carrara marble and mahogany within. Its<br/>
main entrance leads directly to a great stained<br/>
glass window representing "Progress," by Mr.<br/>
John La Farge, the modern master of the art.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the Frick Building Annex. It<br/>
cuts off the light from another side of the Carnegie Building. And the lots across Fifth<br/>
Avenue from the Carnegie Building, formerly<br/>
the site of St. Patrick's Cathedral, are now<br/>
owned by Mr. Frick.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Carnegie desires to leave behind him in<br/>
Pittsburg another great monument to his<br/>
name. In Schenley Park he bought a large<br/>
tract of land upon which he erected the Carnegie<br/>
Library and the Carnegie Technical Schools.<br/>
These magnificent buildings cost many millions and are endowed with many more<br/>
