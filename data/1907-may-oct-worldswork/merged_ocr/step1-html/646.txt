can point "another important way to improve<br/>
the civilization of the world." We shall have<br/>
to change the Filipino's nature, and create in<br/>
him a motive for work. We shall probably<br/>
have him on our hands for three generations<br/>
before he can take care of himself.<br/>

to the United States to enter the President's<br/>
Cabinet, where he has served ever since.<br/>

But Secretary Taft has never forgotten his<br/>
little brown friends in the Philippines. On<br/>
the day he took the War portfolio, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>recommended again to the Senate that the Philippine<br/>
duties be reduced. Then, later, he carried<br/>

</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Datto </span>has just given his <span style="color: #0000FF;">bolo </span>to Gen. Corbin who returned it<br/>
<br/>

In Manila his reward awaited him. The<br/>
Filipinos were glad to see him-honestly, tearfully glad. He governed them for two years<br/>

was finished: he had started the Philippine<br/>

Again, last spring, when he began to be<br/>
mentioned as a suitable candidate for the<br/>
Presidency, it was assumed that he would<br/>
remain at home to look after his campaign.<br/>
A reporter asked him if he still intended<br/>
to go to the Philippines this fall for the opening of the first legislative assembly of the<br/>
Filipinos.<br/>

<br/>
"Why, yes," he said<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
