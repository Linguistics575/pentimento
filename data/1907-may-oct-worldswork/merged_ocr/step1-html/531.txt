</span>The water drawn from the Gunnison River will here be delivered to nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">130,000 </span>acres of arid lands<br/>

From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luj</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>over the mountain by road to<br/>
River Portal in the Gunnison <span style="color: #0000FF;">caiion </span>is twelve<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">miles-twie </span>as far as through the tunnel.<br/>
Up the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uncompahgre </span>side the road winds, as<br/>
any other mountain road, but on the other slope<br/>
parts of it had to be blasted out of soil rock.<br/>
It is the only wagon road into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">crh'on </span>for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy </span>miles. The grade is so steep that the<br/>
four-horse wagons going over it present the<br/>
appearance of being almost all brakes. In<br/>
places it drops as much as 22 feet in a hundred.<br/>
Over this road is hauled, at $ 4.50 a ton, all the<br/>
machinery for the power house, the rails, wire,<br/>
motors, and cars for the tunnel, all the building<br/>
material and food supplies for the town, and<br/>
<br/>
hundreds of tons of coal. Most of this hauling<br/>
must be done in the summer, for the top of the<br/>
divide is two or three feet deep in snow in winter.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of the gorge, River Portal is<br/>
built partly on the dump from the tunnel and<br/>
partly on the side of the gorge where each house<br/>
has to have an <span style="color: #ff0000;">embankment </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">madeto </span>give it<br/>
room to stand. The tunnel on this end has<br/>
gone through rock so solid that timbers have<br/>
been needed only in a few places. Some beds<br/>
of rock have been encountered which have<br/>
required from twelve to twenty hours for <span style="color: #0000FF;">drilling </span>blast holes. On this side they tapped <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
</span>underground stream with a volume of about<br/>
700,000 gallons a day.<br/>
