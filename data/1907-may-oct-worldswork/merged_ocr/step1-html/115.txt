<br/>
</span>recount and that the law's delays were unduly<br/>
turned against him. He had his own Independence League (a corporation) nominate<br/>
him for Governor; the Democratic state <span style="color: #0000FF;">convention</span>, fearing that if it did not endorse<br/>
Mr. Hearst, its candidate would be third in<br/>
the race and it would lose its half of the election<br/>
machinery of the state, made Mr. Hearst its<br/>
candidate.<br/>
<br/>
The Republican state administration had<br/>
been unsatisfactory. Both branches of the<br/>
legislature were Republican. The state Senate<br/>
had many members whose personal corruption<br/>
was believed by the general public. The<br/>
administration of the state departments, particularly of banking, insurance, and public<br/>
works, had been attended with public scandals.<br/>
Among the Republican state leaders there was<br/>
a bitter factional fight over the spoils. Governor Higgins, who has since died, was in such<br/>
a state of health that he was unable to supervise the acts of his subordinates. Under<br/>
the custom of the party, the state officials<br/>
were all entitled to renominations. If this<br/>
course had been followed, the whole Republican ticket would have gone to defeat<br/>
and Mr. Hearst would have been triumphantly elected.<br/>
<br/>
This situation confronted the last Republican state convention. Governor Higgins declined a renomination on account of his health.<br/>
He would have been defeated had he run. All<br/>
the minor state officials were clamoring for<br/>
a popular candidate at the head of the ticket.<br/>
The public sentiment for Mr. Hughes was<br/>
strong, but there was not a political leader<br/>
in favor of his nomination until Congressman<br/>
Herbert Parsons came from New York City<br/>
and said that he was going to put Mr. Hughes<br/>
in nomination and that the old political hacks<br/>
could do as they pleased. The convention<br/>
organized with the Governorship still undecided. Things were in this chaotic state<br/>
when Congressman Cocks, who represents<br/>
Nassau County where President Roosevelt<br/>
votes, appeared at Saratoga and told the<br/>
leaders that the President thought that Mr.<br/>
Hughes was the only man who could win. So<br/>
the convention unanimously selected Mr.<br/>
Hughes and renominated the minor state<br/>
officers.<br/>
<br/>
How sound was this political judgment<br/>
election day proved: Mr. Hughes was elected<br/>
and everybody else on the Republican state<br/>
ticket was defeated. Mr. Hughes ran tens of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8913<br/>
<br/>
</span>thousands of votes ahead of his ticket in the<br/>
Democratic parts of the state, particularly<br/>
New York and Brooklyn. During the campaign he repeatedly appealed to Democrats<br/>
to vote for him. He pledged himself not to be<br/>
a Republican Governor or the Governor of any<br/>
party or of any faction but to be Governor of<br/>
all the people irrespective of politics. The<br/>
people believed him, although the Republican<br/>
politicians did not. They took his speeches<br/>
as campaign promises and regarded his pledges<br/>
as "good politics."<br/>
<br/>
MR. HUGHES AS GOVERNOR<br/>
<br/>
When Governor Hughes assumed office, the<br/>
first shock to the Republican state leaders was<br/>
his telling them personally and privately that<br/>
he proposed to keep the pledges he had made<br/>
to the people. He began with an inaugural<br/>
message in which he advocated a legislative<br/>
recount of the votes cast at the mayoralty<br/>
election in New York, on the ground that if<br/>
Mr. Hearst was elected he was entitled to the<br/>
office and that it was more important that<br/>
elections should be honestly conducted and<br/>
that the public should be satisfied that the<br/>
count was honest than that any individual<br/>
should or should not hold office. He favored<br/>
a reorganization of the state departments and<br/>
promised that he would investigate every one<br/>
of them. Greatest of all, he favored the state<br/>
regulation of all public-service corporations<br/>
and asked the legislature to pass a bill <span style="color: #0000FF;">empowering </span>him to appoint a public-service commission<br/>
which would act on behalf of the people of the<br/>
state in all matters relating to the steam and<br/>
street railroads, water, gas, and electricity, in<br/>
order that an intelligent and comprehensive<br/>
policy might be pursued which would insure a<br/>
reasonable return to the corporations on their<br/>
investment and would reserve all other profits<br/>
from public franchises to the general public<br/>
in the shape of lower fares and better service.<br/>
There were other recommendations for the<br/>
preservation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">state </span>forest preserve, for a<br/>
more <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficient </span>administration of the state departments, for the improvement of the Erie Canal,<br/>
and for better highways. All in all, the message<br/>
treated the affairs of the state as a business to<br/>
be conducted and administered for the sole<br/>
benefit of the people of the state.<br/>
<br/>
Revolutionary as this message was, the<br/>
politicians were willing to let that pass and to<br/>
adopt whatever legislation might please the<br/>
Governor, if only the state patronage were<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
