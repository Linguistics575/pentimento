<span>9346 THE EFFECTS OF<br/>
do wrong. We fail from the inside; we haul<br/>
down the flag deliberately, by our own consent,<br/>
just because we have got tired of fighting; and<br/>
then the enemy walks in. I am not now<br/>
referring to the making of mistakes: our<br/>
ignorance often compels us to do that. Making mistakes isn't an item that can be debited<br/>
to conscience. But <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>mean the conscious and<br/>
deliberate doing of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>thing that we know isn't<br/>
in line with sound morals.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody is guilty of such faults; he does<br/>
what he oughtn't to do; and he knows that he<br/>
oughtn't to do it. He says: "What the <span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fund </span>lets it go at that. He sits up late at<br/>
night when he knows he ought to be in bed;<br/>
he even enjoys it. He could do otherwise if<br/>
he tried. He doesn't try; he's tired of trying.<br/>
We get into the mood of wanting a holiday<br/>
from all that sort of thing. I'm not defending<br/>
this specific variety of holiday habit: I am<br/>
simply noting its existence.<br/>
<br/>
For therein lies the fallacy of the doctrine<br/>
of perfect living. The will can't stand up to<br/>
the doctrine. It "caves in." It yields to<br/>
anger, to worry, to fear, to appetite-to whatever one's own specialty may be in these<br/>
lines. Afterward comes a time when we feel<br/>
ashamed of ourselves, and make up our minds<br/>
-if we are normal human beings-to put up<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">stiffer </span>fight next time. And perhaps we do.<br/>
That's the way life goes.<br/>
<br/>
But if it were not for fatigue of the will, we<br/>
could stay all the time on our best level. We<br/>
could always keep doing the highest things of<br/>
which we are capable, without a let-down.<br/>
<br/>
FATIGUE IS NOT ABNORMAL<br/>
<br/>
I do not wish to give the impression by all<br/>
this that fatigue is an abnormal thing, an<br/>
enemy seeking to make shipwreck of us. On<br/>
the contrary, it is a perfectly inevitable and<br/>
normal result of work; and work is one of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span>'s choicest commodities.<br/>
<br/>
Fatigue, indeed, is the price of growth.<br/>
The muscle to be vigorous and strong must<br/>
be put to hard use-must get tired. But it<br/>
must also be given a fair chance to get rested<br/>
and rebuild its broken-down tissues. Destruction, reconstruction-reconstruction on a larger<br/>
scale-that is the fundamental law of healthful<br/>
living, bodily or mental. If we were never<br/>
tired, we should never be strong.<br/>
<br/>
But it certainly is important that a man<br/>
should know the dangers to which fatigue exposes him-where it makes him weak for the<br/>
<br/>
MENTAL FATIGUE<br/>
<br/>
time being, where and how it reduces his power<br/>
of resistance, what things it unfits him for,<br/>
how it alters his personality. Since it is a<br/>
thing which each of us has to deal with, whether<br/>
he wants to or not, it's worth our while to deal<br/>
with it intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
A fatigued will exposes us on every side.<br/>
When there is big business on hand, we cannot<br/>
afford to have our powers of decision reduced<br/>
and distorted. And they need not be if we<br/>
have learned the lesson of will economy.<br/>
<br/>
Will is a thing you can waste just like your<br/>
cash. You can throw it away on little things<br/>
that don't count, on petty decisions, trivialities;<br/>
and when the moment comes <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>important<br/>
decision, it's exhausted, and either balks or<br/>
goes wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It happens occasionally, I hope, that after<br/>
the close of the day's work somebody takes<br/>
you out to dinner. What a relief it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is-suppose </span>it's an <span style="color: #0000FF;">EL </span>la <span style="color: #ff0000;">carte </span>affair-to sit back in<br/>
your chair, at perfect peace with the world,<br/>
and watch your friend do the ordering. How<br/>
you enjoy the privilege of not having to make<br/>
up your mind again about anything. You<br/>
look with pity upon him as he wanders in a<br/>
daze of indecision among a score or two of<br/>
interesting-looking eatables and drinkables.<br/>
<br/>
Right in that matter, I take it, lies the great<br/>
attraction for most of us in the table <span style="color: #0000FF;">d'hhe<br/>
</span>meal; it relieves the mind of a problem which,<br/>
after all is said and done, isn't worth the bother<br/>
of solution. Utterly free of responsibility,<br/>
you simply watch the series of good things<br/>
appearing, one after another; and you know<br/>
that the process will go through satisfactorily.<br/>
<br/>
The table <span style="color: #0000FF;">d'Mte </span>dinner isn't a perfect<br/>
illustration of my point; but I chose it because<br/>
it is in just such insignificant matters as that<br/>
that the principle of will economy can be most<br/>
easily applied. Similar occasions recur over<br/>
and over again every day in a man's work.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows how much will fatigue he<br/>
often experiences in the effort of "getting<br/>
down to business," most of all if the special<br/>
business on hand is hard or unattractive. You<br/>
stop and carefully scrutinize a fly as it crawls<br/>
zig-zag up the wall. You find yourself becoming interested in a conversation that is going<br/>
on across the room. Then you decide to take<br/>
a few minutes off and smoke, thinking that it<br/>
will be easier after that-but it won't be and<br/>
you know it. Then you remember an important note that ought to be got off at once. And<br/>
so it goes on.<br/>
