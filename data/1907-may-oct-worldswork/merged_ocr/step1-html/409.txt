<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>in a railroad story he turns naturally<br/>
<br/>
to the engineers. When he has<br/>
gone the rounds, interviewed every <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">engineer </span>and every railroad president in town,<br/>
he comes at last to Number I Broadway,<br/>
and finds General Grenville M. Dodge. He<br/>
cannot miss that trail, for every engineer and<br/>
every president will begin his conversation<br/>
with the remark:<br/>
<br/>
"General <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lodge </span>is the man you ought to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">see</span>!"<br/>
<br/>
He sits at a big oak desk in a high office on<br/>
the south side of the building beside a window<br/>
that affords him a sweeping view of the two<br/>
rivers and the harbor, away down beyond the<br/>
Narrows. Without a view like that, New<br/>
York would cramp him, for he spent the better<br/>
part of his life in the plains and the mountains<br/>
of the West.<br/>
<br/>
He is an old man now-seventy-six by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">calendar-but </span>he neither looks it nor acts it.<br/>
He is still chairman of the board for a company<br/>
or two, and his associates vouch for it that <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>is no "dummy <span style="color: #0000FF;">director</span>." His face is <span style="color: #ff0000;">weatherbeaten </span>and gray, but his eyes are still the eyes<br/>
of the Major-General who won his stars with<br/>
Sherman and with Grant, and who led the<br/>
forces of the Union in more than one of the<br/>
Indian campaigns.<br/>
<br/>
The place is redolent of history. Faded<br/>
prints and portraits hang upon the walls,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">authographed </span>portraits of Grant, Sherman,<br/>
Lincoln, and many others of the mighty men of<br/>
the last generation.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, I met Lincoln, along before the War,"<br/>
he says, "and he was a wonderful man. It was<br/>
in Council Bluffs, in 1859, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>think. I had been<br/>
out on the plains looking for a line to the Coast.<br/>
I was sitting on the steps of the hotel when<br/>
along came Mr. Lincoln and sat down beside<br/>
me. I had stored up a lot of information to<br/>
<br/>
give to my employers, but Mr. Lincoln got it<br/>
all. He had that way about him."<br/>
<br/>
When General <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lodge </span>grows reminiscent,<br/>
the ghosts of the past come to life. Of Sherman, in particular, he speaks with familiarity<br/>
and always in terms of the warmest friendship<br/>
and admiration. He can tell wild tales of the<br/>
eight years from 1852 to 1860, the years he<br/>
spent out in the great wilderness beyond<br/>
Omaha, making the first surveys that were to<br/>
establish the route for the Union Pacific,<br/>
traversing the "barren" plains, planting the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>stakes of civilization's survey in a land of<br/>
savage promise. And then, in later years, there<br/>
came the building of Jay Gould's Texas &<br/>
Pacific, piercing the plains of western Texas.<br/>
It is the Epic of the Plains, told in terse prose.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this article is to give to the<br/>
uninitiated some faint idea of the methods that<br/>
are followed in the building of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">railroads </span>through the mountain regions. General<br/>
Dodge's expeditions in search of a route for the<br/>
Union Pacific illustrate very aptly the methods<br/>
and purposes of what is technically called a<br/>
"reconnaissance." For that reason it will be<br/>
referred to in this article quite frequently.<br/>
<br/>
THE FIRST STEP IN RAILROAD BUILDING<br/>
<br/>
Roughly, a new railroad may be said to begin<br/>
with this reconnaissance. It is simply a trip over<br/>
the ground made by a man or men with, as<br/>
they say, "an eye for the country." This<br/>
means that the head of the party must be<br/>
qualified by nature and experience to take in<br/>
all the essential details of the country, its<br/>
physical capability to support a railroad, its<br/>
natural obstacles, the nature of its rock formations, its soil, and all other broad characteristics. His report is not greatly detailed. He<br/>
will, perhaps, recommend that the surveys<br/>
take the south side of a certain ridge because<br/>
of the freedom from snow-slides; or the north<br/>
