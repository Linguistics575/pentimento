<span>TEACHING FARMERS TO FARM<br/>
<br/>
THE SIMPLE AND DIRECT METHOD WHEREBY A MAN IS TAUGHT TO GROW TWO<br/>
BALES OF COTTON ON THE SAME LAND WHERE HE GREW ONLY ONE BEFORE<br/>
<br/>
to a large number of men who them<br/>
selves work farms-the present farmers-whereby they not only may, but will,<br/>
increase the product of their farms from <span style="color: #0000FF;">So<br/>
</span>to 200 per cent.-this is a big thing to do. It<br/>
is one of the biggest things that could be done<br/>
for the enrichment of the country and for the<br/>
development of men. It has, in fact, been<br/>
called by a business man of one of our central<br/>
cities "perhaps the most important event in<br/>
modern times."<br/>
<br/>
This is now done in several Southern states;<br/>
but the method is so simple that it seems almost<br/>
a waste of ink and paper to describe it; and<br/>
the wonder grows that it had never been hit<br/>
upon before. It is this:<br/>
<br/>
A man, under the direction of Dr. S. A.<br/>
Knapp of the Department of Agriculture, goes<br/>
into a neighborhood where farmers are growing cotton as they have grown it for half a<br/>
dozen generations, producing, let us say, an<br/>
average of a third <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a bale per acre-for this<br/>
is the average throughout the whole cotton<br/>
area. He studies the neighborhood until he<br/>
finds a farmer of industry and of influence with<br/>
his neighbors. He goes to this farmer and<br/>
tells him that he represents the Department of<br/>
Agriculture of the Government and that he<br/>
would like to make an experiment on, let us<br/>
say, five acres of his land. The "demonstrator," for this is what they call the traveling<br/>
teacher of agriculture, selects five acres, and<br/>
the farmer agrees to till it according to the<br/>
demonstrator's directions. The demonstrator<br/>
provides a plow, which will cut a furrow twice<br/>
as deep as the plow that the farmer has always<br/>
used. He instructs the farmer to hitch two<br/>
mules to it instead of one. He plows the<br/>
land in the fall. The farmer has, perhaps, not<br/>
been in the habit of doing this. Then he gives<br/>
him directions about fertilizing the land. In<br/>
most cases the fertilization is cheaper and<br/>
simpler than the farmer has been accustomed<br/>
to. Then, at planting time, the demonstrator<br/>
provides the seed with which these five acres<br/>
are planted. Of course, it is well-selected<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>TEACH a better system of farming<br/>
<br/>
seed. He gives other simple elementary instruction about the whole year's work.<br/>
<br/>
When the farmer comes to gather his crop,<br/>
he observes that these five acres have produced<br/>
twice as much cotton as any other five acres in<br/>
his field. Then the demonstrator explains to<br/>
the neighbors just what has made the difference<br/>
--the simple devices of deep fall plowing, of<br/>
proper fertilization, and preparation of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">land</span>, and proper seed selection. He has, perhaps, taught no other lessons than these simple,<br/>
fundamental things. The result is that the<br/>
farmer has a demand for the cotton seed which<br/>
grew on those five acres, at so high a price that<br/>
he sells them alone for perhaps more than both<br/>
seed and cotton from any other five acres would<br/>
bring. Of course, the next year he cultivates<br/>
all his cotton land as those <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>acres were <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivated</span>. Of course, too, the most teachable<br/>
of his neighbors cultivate their land in the same<br/>
way. As soon as they see that by their own<br/>
labor, and with the expenditure of practically<br/>
no more money, they can double the yield of<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">lands-then </span>the lesson is learned.<br/>
<br/>
This system of instruction was first started<br/>
under the direction of Dr. S. A. Knapp in<br/>
regions of Texas where the boll weevil had<br/>
devastated the crop. The result was that the<br/>
farmers grew a cotton that matured sufficiently<br/>
early and was <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>hardy practically to<br/>
resist the weevil; and there is more cotton<br/>
grown now in those regions than there was before the weevil appeared. So completely successful did the method turn out to be that the<br/>
Agricultural Department provided for the<br/>
application of it to cotton lands east of Texas,<br/>
anticipating the appearance of the weevil,<br/>
which travels steadily eastward at a rate of<br/>
somewhat less than one hundred miles a year.<br/>
<br/>
The General Education Board, in cooperation<br/>
with the Department of Agriculture, is now<br/>
extending this kind of agricultural instruction<br/>
in states still further east-in Alabama, in<br/>
Georgia, the Carolinas, and in Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are communities to which<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>no demonstrators were sent by the Government, which, having heard of these results,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
