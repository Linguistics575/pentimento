downtrodden fellaheen. "Let us ask you," said<br/>
the Prime Minister of Egypt the other day, to<br/>
Lord Cromer, "to allow us to consider you<br/>
always as one of us." This is the simple key<br/>
not only to the full tide of sympathy and gratitude upon which the retiring Agent went out<br/>
across the bar of Port Said, but to the success<br/>
which had won for him the love of a whole<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he also kept the perspective of the<br/>
foreigner. Except that he did not follow<br/>
Joseph's extortion in the lean years, Lord<br/>
Cromer saw that the happy development of<br/>
Egypt lay in adopting his predecessor's <span style="color: #0000FF;">foresight </span>and determination, so long also as he was<br/>
backed, just as Joseph was, by unanswerable<br/>
power. Without looking to the right hand<br/>
or to the left, he has always pursued that simple<br/>
and consistent policy. So dear to him have<br/>
always been the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">voiceless </span>millions of <span style="color: #ff0000;">blueshirted </span>fellahin" that he has denied them the<br/>
fatal gift of self-government. Wholly spurious<br/>
and manufactured, he says, is this demand for<br/>
Parliamentary institutions. Could we ourselves find some alternative, how gladly we<br/>
would embrace it. We have long lost our own<br/>
love for party politics. Both in England and in<br/>
the United States, the doubt is rising in the<br/>
minds of those who think whether there is<br/>
any other justification for the party system<br/>
than that it has become by this <span style="color: #ff0000;">timeinevitable</span>,<br/>
an inelastic obstacle to true progress.<br/>
<br/>
LORD CROMER UPON HIMSELF<br/>
<br/>
His own summing-up of what his task was<br/>
is an interesting document. Clear before him<br/>
when in 1883 he was appointed was the twin<br/>
necessity-peace, and if possible friendship,<br/>
must at most costs be maintained with <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rance</span>;<br/>
a humane and far-sighted policy must be<br/>
introduced into a regime that had of necessity<br/>
to be bureaucratic. It is old history to repeat<br/>
but the trouble with France deserves a word.<br/>
When, in 1882, England called upon France to<br/>
join in intervention to save both the Khedive<br/>
and the situation, France declined. "Who<br/>
pays the piper calls the tune" and, since<br/>
that refusal, England-who entered upon the<br/>
tremendous enterprise with reluctance and a<br/>
heavy heart-has necessarily called it, subject<br/>
only to an ever-lessening control of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>international board.<br/>
<br/>
But one who visits Cairo to-day for the first<br/>
time is not likely to understand the position<br/>
with which Lord Cromer found himself face<br/>
<br/>
CROMER, MAKER OF EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
to face <span style="color: #ff0000;">twcnty-four </span>years ago. The country<br/>
was nearly bankrupt; the worst evils of the<br/>
corv√©e were still crushing the fellaheen into<br/>
despair; agriculture was almost at a standstill,<br/>
even in the Delta; the whip was the argument<br/>
of the governing power; slavery was accepted<br/>
as a matter of course; the administration of<br/>
justice was at the service of the highest bidder;<br/>
hospitals were unknown; education in a modern sense was unknown; sympathy between<br/>
rulers and ruled was <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-existent</span>; the whole<br/>
of the Sudan province had been captured;<br/>
the meaning of Egypt as the centre of the<br/>
Old World had long been forgotten. With<br/>
just and serious pride, Lord Cromer referred<br/>
the other day to the undeniable fact that every<br/>
one of these abuses has been swept away during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-four </span>years of his government.<br/>
Egypt has become the classical example of<br/>
sudden and splendid prosperity, and the<br/>
wrinkles of <span style="color: #0000FF;">immemorial </span>time across its face have<br/>
been transformed by Lord Cromer into fertile<br/>
furrows from which in a decade it means to<br/>
challenge on equal terms the cotton and sugar<br/>
growing countries of the world.<br/>
<br/>
AN ELUSIVE PERSONALITY<br/>
<br/>
But what of the man? I could hardly<br/>
describe him better than by saying that no one<br/>
knows Lord Cromer. His appointment, a<br/>
quarter of a century ago, was severely criticised.<br/>
Never in all the time that has elapsed has he<br/>
appeared upon the surface, while all the time<br/>
he was performing miracles unequaled in<br/>
history. The other day, I asked a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cabinet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">minister </span>what the attitude of the new Radical<br/>
government was on the Egyptian question.<br/>
He said: "If Lord Cromer wishes to remain<br/>
till he is eighty, the present Government will<br/>
put no obstacle in his way." It has been given<br/>
to him to fill the most criticized position in<br/>
the whole round of civilized authority for the<br/>
working time of a man's prime of life, and in<br/>
that brief space a new and strong nation has<br/>
been formed out of jarring interests and corruption. Without a day's friction with his<br/>
own chiefs, without serious trouble with any<br/>
one of the many jealous watching powers,<br/>
he has brought the thing to pass and he has<br/>
done it so that when at last he leaves his throne,<br/>
the Egyptians and the very French themselves<br/>
join in a splendid act of gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Partly, of course, Lord Cromer judges his<br/>
man most excellently. He picked out <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kitchener</span>, who as a spectator watched from Admiral<br/>
<br/>
