THE WEST-END PUBLIC SCHOOL<br/>
In Spartanburg, to which mill children <span style="color: #0000FF;">go<br/>
<br/>
</span>employees and were gradually promoted to their<br/>
present positions. The Proximity has done<br/>
more work among its employees than most of<br/>
the other mills, but almost all of the mill men<br/>
believe with the Proximity owners that the<br/>
better educated the employees are, and the<br/>
better they live, the more profitable workers<br/>
they will become. The pressure of economic<br/>
conditions is lifting the mill operatives to a<br/>
higher plane of living and the employers are<br/>
aiding that advance because they realize that<br/>
it is for their advantage. On the farms from<br/>
which these people came, there was little social<br/>
intercourse and little to stir them to progress.<br/>
In the mill village there is plenty of social intercourse; they are in touch with the world. Their<br/>
dormant ambitions are aroused. And their<br/>
own ambitions are the strongest force that can<br/>
be brought to bear to make them better workers<br/>
and better citizens. Such is the transformation<br/>
which, with some abuses and some delays,<br/>
the mills are working among the purest Amer<br/>
MILL VILLAGE <span style="color: #0000FF;">SCHOOL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AT </span>GLENDALE<br/>

<br/>
The transformation of the Piedmont region<br/>
has been so rapid that the railroads which <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>a few years ago served this section with ease,<br/>
admit now that in spite of tremendous improvements in rolling stock, they are unable to<br/>
handle the freight that originates along their<br/>
lines. The main reason for all this growth<br/>
still exists. More mills are being built<br/>
every day. There is more local capital than<br/>
there used to be and outside capital is easier<br/>
to get. The mills are meeting the scarcity of<br/>
labor by training their help to be more efficient.<br/>
Improved machinery is making it possible for<br/>
fewer hands to do more work. A man who<br/>
can operate six ordinary looms can run twelve<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>automatic ones and do more weaving<br/>
with each loom. A drawing-in machine lately<br/>
invented obviates some of the most trying<br/>
labor that girls do in the mills. <span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>the help<br/>
