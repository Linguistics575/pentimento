<span>9370 AMATEUR HAND-CRAFTS THAT PAY<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, as the people in that little shop<br/>
will tell you, the revived handicrafts have <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>come a remunerative resource for amateurs.<br/>
By amateurs I do not mean bunglers; I mean<br/>
those who support themselves by other sorts<br/>
of work and adopt handicrafts as a recreation, develop a high degree of skill, and produce things every whit as good as do those who<br/>
call themselves professionals. They make<br/>
their fun pay for itself, and more. It occupies<br/>
only their leisure, but it serves as an additional<br/>
channel of income. Suppose, for instance,<br/>
that a farm lad, instead of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">loafing</span>" about the<br/>
village store of an evening, should train himself<br/>
to stamp and tint leather or to hammer brass or<br/>
copper; suppose that a village girl, instead of<br/>
busying her <span style="color: #0000FF;">fingers </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">beautiless </span>"fancy<br/>
work", should study <span style="color: #0000FF;">designing-lint<br/>
</span>teachers can be found in the nearest large city<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-and </span>devote herself to really artistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">needlework </span>that would express all her originality<br/>
and enthusiasm and love of harmonious line<br/>
and color; both would secure a worthy pastime,<br/>
and both would meanwhile be making money.<br/>
Elbert Hubbard's "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Roycroftcrs</span>" are recruited<br/>
almost entirely from a country community,<br/>
and although the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roycroft </span>wares invite criticism<br/>
in certain respects, the fault lies with the controlling spirit rather than with the workers.<br/>
If they can reach the Roycroft standard, they<br/>
prove themselves capable of reaching a higher<br/>
standard under abler direction. Moreover,<br/>
hundreds of business and professional people<br/>
are learning that while the day's toil fags brain<br/>
and nerves, the evening passed in using the<br/>
hands at pleasing labor soothes the wearied<br/>
body and calms the distracted mind. The<br/>
effect of such labor is refreshing. It occupies<br/>
the attention just <span style="color: #ff0000;">sufficicntly </span>to shut out worry<br/>
and no one finds it fatiguing. The tired<br/>
lawyer or the exasperated editor can make<br/>
book-bindings or carve ivory while his wife<br/>
is reading aloud to him.<br/>
<br/>
I warrant the result less upon the voucher<br/>
of my own <span style="color: #0000FF;">experience-which </span>accounts for<br/>
something, though-than upon the testimony<br/>
of many physicians, some of whom have prescribed handicrafts as a sort of medicine in the<br/>
treatment of nervous ailments. Certain sanatoriums have shops in which patients are<br/>
put to work-with the most cheerful effect.<br/>
Naturally, the particular kind of work allotted<br/>
must suit the especial needs and aptitude of the<br/>
Individual; for instance, a doctor would hardly<br/>
set a <span style="color: #0000FF;">neurasthenic </span>at over-delicate work;<br/>
<br/>
basketry would do better, in every respect, and<br/>
so, probably, would the tinting of tiles. In<br/>
such an institution, a New York business man,<br/>
terribly broken down when he arrived, learned<br/>
to make baskets. Not only did that aid in<br/>
restoring him to health, but at the same time<br/>
his new occupation so captivated him that<br/>
instead of returning to the city he <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew<br/>
</span>to a charming country village, and is now<br/>
following basketry as a profession, He is<br/>
probably the most artistic basket-maker in the<br/>
United States.<br/>
<br/>
His story might well be that of many a city<br/>
dweller driven to extremities by nervous strain.<br/>
In every <span style="color: #ff0000;">trolley-ear</span>, every "<span style="color: #0000FF;">el</span>" train, you see<br/>
men who ought to quit the city forever. Quit it<br/>
they would, had they the courage and had they<br/>
hope of making a living elsewhere. For some<br/>
of them, at least, the revived handicrafts point<br/>
a way of escape. Once you have mastered a<br/>
trade, you can live where you will. You can<br/>
take your tools and your talent to the mountains, to the deep woods, even to a pine-clad<br/>
island somewhere off the coast of Maine. And<br/>
if men can make their hands set them free of<br/>
the city and its horrors of din and hurry, they<br/>
can make them set them free of irksome employments. I know of a business man <span style="color: #0000FF;">who</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>hearing that last year a neighbor of his had<br/>
sold $ 6,000 worth of the work of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">hands</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-threw </span>up a profitable but infuriating job,<br/>
learned an enjoyable handicraft, and now bids<br/>
fair to be as prosperous as before, while infinitely more contented.<br/>
<br/>
Taken all in <span style="color: #0000FF;">all'hese </span>are matters to set one<br/>
thinking. Might not you. too, gain a new<br/>
kind of pleasure, a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span>. of rest, a new<br/>
source of income, and possibly even a new<br/>
independence by simply discovering that <span style="color: #0000FF;">those<br/>
</span>things on the ends of your arms are hands,<br/>
and that hands can acquire handicrafts?<br/>
What if you are not clever at basketry or<br/>
leather work: there is a long list of other arts<br/>
to choose from. At a recent exhibition held by<br/>
the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts, the products displayed made a catalogue of more<br/>
than a hundred pages, covering this <span style="color: #0000FF;">significantly </span>wide range of departments: basketry,<br/>
book-binding, ecclesiastical work, glassware,<br/>
jewelry, leather work, metal work, photography,<br/>
pottery, printing, engraving, stained-glass,<br/>
textiles, embroidery, and woodworking-to<br/>
say nothing of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very interesting department of<br/>
"miscellaneous objects."<br/>
<br/>
"Well," I seem to hear you reply. "all <span style="color: #0000FF;">this<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
