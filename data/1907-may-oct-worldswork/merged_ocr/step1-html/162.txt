a rule, they go in small groups. There is yet<br/>
no large continuous stream, except to Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Italians have begun to go, especially to and<br/>
through New Orleans. There has been much<br/>
controversy about the Italian as a cotton grower.<br/>
But there is no doubt of his success, as the following test, described for these pages by Mr.<br/>
Alfred H. Stone, will show.<br/>
<br/>
"The test was made on the'Sunny Side' property, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the Mississippi River, in Chicot Country, Arkansas. The<br/>
number of Italian squads in 1898 was 38, with 200 working<br/>
hands, cultivating 1,200 acres of cotton. Of Negro squads<br/>
there were 203, with 600 working hands, cultivating 2,600<br/>
acres of cotton. At the end of 1905, after eight years, there<br/>
were on the property 107 Italian squads, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>working<br/>
hands, and 38 Negro families, with 175 working <span style="color: #0000FF;">hands-an </span>increase of 69 squads and 300 hands for the Italians,<br/>
a decrease of 165 squads and 425 hands for the Negroes.<br/>
The total cotton acreage had increased to 3,900, of which<br/>
the Italians were cultivating 3,000 acres and the Negroes<br/>
<br/>
900. The figures in detail from 1899 to 1904 make the<br/>
following exhibit:<br/>

<br/>
"Thus the Italian seems to have produced more lint per<br/>
hand, by 1,410 pounds, or 120.1%, and to have exceeded<br/>
the Negro's yield per acre by 170 pounds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>72.9%. The<br/>
difference in money value in favor of the Italian was<br/>
$ 148.89 per hand, or I 15.8%, and $ 18.41 per acre, or 69.8%.<br/>
<br/>
"Of the 110 Italian squads who started to work at the<br/>
beginning of 1905, 44 were new arrivals. Of the total<br/>
number, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>squads, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">59 </span>per cent., had no supply accounts<br/>
for the year. Of the 61 Negro families who started to<br/>
work at the beginning of 1905, only 2, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">3.2 </span>per cent. of<br/>
the whole, had no such accounts. To the 66 Italian<br/>
families in 1904, cash balances above accounts were paid<br/>
in the sum of $ 38,764.58, an average of $ 587.35 per family.<br/>
Of the I <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>Negro families in 1904, two drew total balances<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">015480.50</span>, while the firm had on its books at the end of the<br/>
year the sum of $ 6,456.20 in Negro balances due.<br/>
<br/>
"There were 107 Italian squads at the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1905</span>. Of<br/>
these 104 owned 123 head of work stock, and other live<br/>
stock, such as cattle, sheep and hogs, to the total value of<br/>
$ 23,400. Only 3 squads owned no stock. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the 38<br/>
Negro squads, 21 owned work and live stock to the total<br/>
value <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>$ 3,360, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">17owned </span>no stock."<br/>
<br/>
The thorough and earnest way in which the<br/>
South is going about this work is shown by the<br/>
<br/>
IMMIGRATION TO THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
organization which Mr. J. A. Betjeman, of<br/>
Georgia, is perfecting in that state. In every<br/>
community, committees are formed to secure<br/>
trustworthy information, which is written on<br/>
proper blanks and classified. From these it<br/>
may instantly be found out what sort of men are<br/>
wanted in any community, what is the work to<br/>
be done, what the wages, what the arrangements<br/>
for living, and what the cost. In the same<br/>
way opportunities for farmers are classified.<br/>
The Georgia Bureau of Immigration can <span style="color: #0000FF;">inform </span>a man in Sweden or in Canada just where<br/>
he can buy a farm of so many acres that will<br/>
produce so much of such and such products,<br/>
what it will cost him, what it will cost per year<br/>
to cultivate it, etc., etc. This kind of work<br/>
does not produce great results immediately;<br/>
but in time it will greatly add to the population of the state. For the immigrants that<br/>
come to the South and are satisfied induce<br/>
others to follow. Some of these who landed<br/>
at Charleston found work in the mills at<br/>
Greenville, S. C. After a few months they<br/>
held a meeting and sent one of their number<br/>
back to Belgium to bring over as many of their<br/>
friends and relatives as he could induce to<br/>
come. Toward the last of February, he<br/>
arrived with thirty-five. Others of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowpassengers </span>formed a colony near Columbia.<br/>
Within a few weeks they had selected a place,<br/>
bought their truck farms, and were engaged in<br/>
getting the ground ready for planting. They<br/>
have already been joined by friends from<br/>
Canada and expect others from Belgium.<br/>
<br/>
The chief difficulties yet are: first, the almost<br/>
universal ignorance in regard to the South, or<br/>
(worse) widespread definite errors about <span style="color: #0000FF;">it-that </span>it is not healthful, that it is not orderly,<br/>
that it is oppressively hot; second, the lowness<br/>
of wages. Wages have enormously increased<br/>
during the last five years; but in most regions<br/>
they are yet somewhat below wages in the North<br/>
and West. But living is yet cheaper. The<br/>
strong tendency is to equalize these conditions<br/>
directly in proportion to the development of<br/>
cheap transportation.<br/>
<br/>
The most sensible immigration is of farmers,<br/>
whether from the Northern States or from<br/>
Europe. It is to these that great opportunities<br/>
are offered. Trucking near the cities or on<br/>
railroad lines and cotton-growing are especially<br/>
profitable-so profitable that a practically<br/>
unlimited number of men, who will learn the<br/>
business, can quickly earn a competence, and<br/>
the ablest of them build fortunes.<br/>
