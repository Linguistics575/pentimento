brought it about that England has no farmers<br/>
and that the English trade schools have till<br/>
lately been far inferior to the German schools.<br/>
<br/>
But public opinion in the United States has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>passed most of the academic indifference<br/>
to the broadening of education to include the<br/>
teaching of any useful thing, provided only<br/>
it be taught well enough. As for youthful<br/>
ideals and ideals of culture in general, we are<br/>
learning that they are endangered not by honest<br/>
work of any kind, but only by that narrower<br/>
view of life which insists rather on the old<br/>
formulas of culture than upon its substance.<br/>
The man of thorough work-the man who takes<br/>
a pride in his work and does it well because<br/>
he is proud of it-does more for the solid culture of the people as well as for their sound<br/>
character than any unproductive cultivated<br/>
scholar. The main thing is thoroughness,<br/>
which is another name for character.<br/>

MAPS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>PUBLIC OPINION<br/>
<br/>
AN INTERESTING public-opinion map<br/>
<br/>
of the United States could be made which<br/>
should show pretty accurately what might be<br/>
called both the geography and the geology of<br/>
public thought on most important subjects.<br/>
For example, a map of opinion favorable to<br/>
the stringent regulation of railroads would<br/>
show almost a uniform color outside the large<br/>
financial centres, the color deepening in the<br/>
Mississippi Valley and in the South, becoming<br/>
deepest of all in Texas. So much for the<br/>
"geography" of this opinion. Its "geology'<br/>
would reveal a lower stratum of industrial<br/>
society that favors not mere regulation but<br/>
ownership by the Government of public-utility<br/>
corporations. Maps of pro-trust or anti-trust<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">feeling </span>would be almost identical with the maps<br/>
of railroad-regulation feeling.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">taiT-opinion </span>map would contain more<br/>
colors. The general background would indicate a dominant feeling in favor of protection<br/>
to a degree. There would, of course, be freetrade areas, small or large, on every part of it.<br/>
But they would not be large contiguous areas.<br/>
A wish for free coal would show in New<br/>
England, for free lumber elsewhere, for free<br/>
sugar elsewhere; and so on. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">many<br/>
</span>patches of color would all indicate a pretty<br/>
general wish for the revision of some of the<br/>
schedules.<br/>
<br/>
A map of opinion about immigration would<br/>
show a division of feeling in the Pacific States,<br/>
the dominant color being anti-Asiatic. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>

rapidly spreading wish for immigrants (white,<br/>
of course) would appear on the map of the<br/>
South. A welcome color, too, would still<br/>
prevail over the Middle West.<br/>
<br/>
A map of the President's popularity would<br/>
show enthusiastic approval in all the Northern<br/>
and Western States, except the cities where<br/>
men of high financial plans live most densely<br/>
and in those regions of the West where it has<br/>
been necessary to enforce land-laws that were<br/>
long disregarded.<br/>
<br/>
A geological opinion-map of the northernmost New England States, of Pennsylvania,<br/>
and of most of the Southern States would show<br/>
those ancient strata of political habit which<br/>
suggest that formulas and traditions have long<br/>
been mistaken there for thought. The forces<br/>
which change all our political maps at intervals<br/>
are strongest in the Middle West.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the study of political opinion might<br/>
be made easy for amateur <span style="color: #0000FF;">politicians</span>. Such<br/>
maps would be useful, too, to financiers and<br/>
to labor-leaders, two classes of men who seem<br/>
to flounder worse than others in their studies<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this subject. The place of a man's residence<br/>
and his place in industrial life, as a rule, determine his opinions on current subjects; and what<br/>
he thinks, or thinks that he thinks, is generally<br/>
what his neighbors and fellows think; and much<br/>
such thinking is done by inheritance, by formula, and by the drift of the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
THE DISTRIBUTION OF WHITE MEN<br/>
<br/>
HE Congressional Commission that spent<br/>
<br/>
the summer in Europe, investigating the<br/>
emigration thence to the United States, has<br/>
called attention to facts that show this most<br/>
interesting conclusion-that there are not<br/>
enough white men in the world. Parts of the<br/>
United States still welcome all hale and <span style="color: #0000FF;">industrious </span>newcomers, but most of the European<br/>
governments are lamenting the departure of<br/>
their subjects, some are taking vigorous means<br/>
to prevent more from leaving, and several are<br/>
even trying to turn the tide back toward<br/>
Europe.<br/>
<br/>
In the countries that maintain large armies,<br/>
objection is made to the departure of men who<br/>
would do military service. But there is a<br/>
sounder economic reason than this for discouraging emigration. Laborers are becoming<br/>
scarce in parts of Europe, especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">farm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">laborers</span>. In a word, white men who can and<br/>
will work are needed everywhere. Except<br/>
the jungles of the great cities, there are few<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
