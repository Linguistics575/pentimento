</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9360<br/>
<br/>
</span>case system. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Twenty-six </span>students entered the<br/>
first class, and nearly all of them graduated.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>school surrendered and came over to<br/>
the new one to form the Law Department of<br/>
the University of Cincinnati. Judge Taft<br/>
was dean, and took for his subject "Real<br/>
Property." He had four hours a week at the<br/>
school, and sometimes six.<br/>
<br/>
This brings us to one of Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s greatest<br/>
qualities as a judge, <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>which denotes<br/>
the ideal judicial mind. He is entirely lacking<br/>
in what he calls "a pride of first opinion."<br/>
Once his mind is made up, he is like a wall<br/>
against any change, if the change <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>attempted<br/>
by anything <span style="color: #0000FF;">resembling </span>moral invasion. Any<br/>
change must be within himself, started by new<br/>
evidence or reasoning that will prove him<br/>
mistaken. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hen </span>he reverses himself as cheerfully as he would <span style="color: #ff0000;">doff </span>his overcoat for duck<br/>
clothes on sailing into the tropics, and with as<br/>
little thought of wounding his <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-respect</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>of Mike <span style="color: #0000FF;">Devanney</span>, who<br/>
wanted to become a United States marshal. He<br/>
tried to get Judge Taft's <span style="color: #0000FF;">endorsement </span>He<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>good, "gritty," little Irishman, but the<br/>
Judge honestly thought that he was not <span style="color: #0000FF;">competent </span>and refused. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Devanney </span>was much hurt,<br/>
and though he received the appointment to the<br/>
place, it became his ambition to prove to the<br/>
Judge that he was competent. He worked <span style="color: #0000FF;">hard<br/>
<br/>
</span>and conscientiously in his office, and a year<br/>
or so had passed when Judge Taft received an<br/>
inquiry of some sort from the Department of<br/>
Justice at Washington. In answer, he had<br/>
occasion to mention the marshal's office, and<br/>
he added that the present marshal, Devanney,<br/>
was the best marshal he had ever known in that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">district</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Devanney </span>himself was ignorant of<br/>
this correspondence, but it happened to get<br/>
into the papers and he saw it, and was jubilant.<br/>
I have it on authority that he still carries<br/>
the clipping in his hat <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand<br/>
<br/>
</span>To sum up in a few lines, Mr. Taft was<br/>
known in his community and to the legal<br/>
fraternity generally as a great lawyer. He<br/>
was also a thorough, safe, keen, and upright<br/>
jurist; but in that Court where he presided,<br/>
with men like Day and Lurton, he could not be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span>to stand head and shoulders above them.<br/>
Strictly as a learned judge, he was not <span style="color: #0000FF;">regarded </span>by many of the local bar as superior to<br/>
Judge Lurton, for instance. Nor was he<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">eloquent</span>, or brilliant. But there was a feeling<br/>
that in other <span style="color: #0000FF;">directions </span>he was, or could make<br/>
himself, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">strong</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rpsl </span>effective as in the law.<br/>
<br/>
Other things than the law he might do<br/>
as well. <span style="color: #0000FF;">There </span>lacked but the opportunity.<br/>
But opportunity came, and it was given him<br/>
to accept or to reject the one great task of his<br/>
life <span style="color: #0000FF;">-tlu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>American task in the Philippines<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
