<span>HOW TO INVEST SMALL FUNDS<br/>
<br/>
yield a high return, in order that the investor<br/>
may live; yet in every case it calls at the same<br/>
time for an investment that shall be absolutely<br/>
safe, or as near it as we can come in this world.<br/>
<br/>
Such an investor may fall into the hands of<br/>
a mining promoter, or an enthusiastic believer<br/>
in some new industrial. The problem is then<br/>
simple. The money goes into a venture that<br/>
may, or may not, pay very high returns, but<br/>
one that does not certainly contain a single<br/>
element of the safety that is the fundamental<br/>
principle of conservative investment. In a<br/>
large majority of such cases, the investment<br/>
points the way to the charity-ward or to the<br/>
poor-house.<br/>
<br/>
Escaping this peril, the investor may come<br/>
upon a banker who will lightly undertake to<br/>
put the money into bonds or stocks that are<br/>
suitable for a business risk by a business man<br/>
or woman, but not for the innocent investor,<br/>
who has no way of watching the results of the<br/>
investment until she or he hears that it has<br/>
greatly increased in value, or greatly shrunk.<br/>
<br/>
The writer has in mind the case of a<br/>
woman who lived in New Jersey, barely supporting herself and one child on the proceeds<br/>
of a life insurance policy invested in Newark<br/>
City bonds that gave her an income of $ 400<br/>
per annum from her capital of $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">120,000</span>. She<br/>
had become accustomed to living on that<br/>
amount, and did not find it a hardship. She<br/>
planned that, when her boy came of age, the<br/>
investment should become his capital in some<br/>
small business enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
In the early summer <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tpor</span>, she was induced<br/>
by a neighbor to go to a broker and listen to the<br/>
tales that were current concerning the common<br/>
stock of the United States Steel Corporation.<br/>
The broker was perfectly honest. He asked<br/>
about her investment. The income seemed<br/>
pitifully small to him. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">substan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>of his<br/>
conclusions was contained in a letter, the gist<br/>
of which is quoted here, from memory:<br/>
<br/>
"I do not advise you to invest permanently in a stock<br/>
like this; but I do <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmly </span>believe that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>per cent. divi<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">dends </span>are to be considered safe beyond reasonable doubt<br/>
and that within a year or two this stock will be considered<br/>
cheap at $ 75 per share. I should advise you to purchase<br/>
250 shares at the current price, and hold them until the<br/>
stock becomes widely scattered among investors and the<br/>
price meets with its natural advance. At that time you<br/>
can sell it, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-invest </span>your capital in bonds. This<br/>
measure should increase the amount of your capital from<br/>
$ 10,000 to nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">820,000</span>. In the meantime, it will yield<br/>
you $ 1,000 per annum instead of the $ 400 per annum you<br/>
now <span style="color: #0000FF;">enjoy</span>."<br/>

This advice was disinterested, and perfectly<br/>
honest. Of course, it appealed strongly to the<br/>
investor. She sold her bonds and bought <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So<br/>
</span>shares of United States Steel common stock.<br/>
The broker bought it for her, transferred it<br/>
to her name, and delivered it to her. She put<br/>
it into a bank, where she also opened a savings<br/>
account. She was wise enough not to increase her scale of living to meet the increase<br/>
in her yearly revenue. Her living did not<br/>
reach $ 500, so that she saved, out of her income, nearly $ 1,000 in the two years that<br/>
followed. That money stayed in the bank<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
Everything went well for a time. She read<br/>
one day that the Steel stock had gone over<br/>
$ 50 per share, and figured out that her 250<br/>
shares were worth over $ 12,500. It gave her<br/>
a feeling of comfort. Then came the awakening. Quite by accident, after a few months,<br/>
she heard that the stock was down to near 30.<br/>
She thought it was going to be all right, <span style="color: #0000FF;">because </span>only a few days before she had received<br/>
her dividends. She was quite sure it would<br/>
come up again. In that certainty, she let<br/>
things drift along, until, in December, 1903,<br/>
the usual dividend check did not arrive. In<br/>
its stead came a check <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>half the usual<br/>
amount. She did not understand it. She<br/>
wrote to the company, and, in time, was told<br/>
that the directors had found it necessary to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">declare </span>a smaller dividend because of the fall'ng off in revenues. The reply left her quite<br/>
uncertain as to whether or not she would receive another dividend, even at the reduced<br/>
rate.<br/>
<br/>
She found also that her capital had shrunk<br/>
amazingly. The stock she had bought for<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000 </span>she found worth little more than half<br/>
that amount. She saw that she could not sell<br/>
out and live on the proceeds of the sale. She<br/>
hung on grimly, hoping for the best. In<br/>
March of the next year, the worst came to pass.<br/>
There was no dividend at all. Her stock was<br/>
worth hardly $ 3,000. She had lost all faith in<br/>
the broker and had not gone to him at all for<br/>
comfort or advice. It was at this point that<br/>
she came to the writer to find out where she<br/>
stood.<br/>
<br/>
It was a very bad case. At the market<br/>
quotations, at that time her stock was worth<br/>
only about $ 3,100, and the possibility of dividends seemed very remote. She had in the<br/>
bank nearly $ 1,000 cash. It seemed quite<br/>
impossible to get a living revenue out of that<br/>
<br/>
