<span>8878 THE FUR TRADE<br/>
But while rabbit is the fur most used-the<br/>
greatest sinner in all the long list of shoddy<br/>
imitations--<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>wears out quickest and so <span style="color: #0000FF;">renews </span>its own demand. In fact, rabbits have<br/>
become such a hunted pest in California and<br/>
Australia that they are actually developing the<br/>
claws and climbing qualities of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tree-nesters</span>.<br/>
<br/>
I have already referred to the millions of<br/>
muskrats sent from the swamps of New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
and what is more, it is an imitation that wears;<br/>
and one often sees excellent muskrat imitations<br/>
of ladies' mink coats. Muskrat is one of the<br/>
few imitations that does more lasting service<br/>
than its prototype.<br/>
<br/>
It takes an expert to tell diamonds from<br/>
paste nowadays; but he who runs may read the<br/>
difference between chinchilla and dyed cat,<br/>
between rabbit with black dots stuck over it<br/>

<br/>
Mr. Colin Fraser sorting out black fox skins from his stock<br/>
<br/>
and Delaware. As many again are yearly sent<br/>
from Canada; as many from Russia and<br/>
Austria. Whether it be that the Russian and<br/>
Austrian muskrats are finer than the American<br/>
or that the German dressers know their <span style="color: #0000FF;">business </span>better, certain it is that the best muskrat<br/>
skins come from the Leipsic sales. Here it is<br/>
that the beautiful gray linings for ladies' opera<br/>
cloaks and the heavy brown linings for men's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">overcoats </span>are bought-the soft fur of the under<br/>
body being used for the former, the backs split<br/>
off for the latter. The large Russian muskrat<br/>
can be dyed to a perfect imitation of marten;<br/>
<br/>
and ermine of the jet tail-tip, between silver<br/>
fox which nature has <span style="color: #0000FF;">silvered </span>and a black fur<br/>
silvered by chemicals.<br/>
<br/>
For trade purposes American squirrel may<br/>
be ignored. The squirrel of commerce comes<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asia-the </span>black from <span style="color: #0000FF;">japan</span>, the red<br/>
from Kazan, the gray <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Urals, the blue<br/>
from the Lena, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">black- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">brown </span>from Yakutsk<br/>
and Okhotsk. These go to the fur fairs of Germany and Russia, whence they find their way<br/>
to America. Monkey fur is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>study by itself,<br/>
but it has not been so great a favorite with<br/>
fashion in America as in Europe.<br/>
