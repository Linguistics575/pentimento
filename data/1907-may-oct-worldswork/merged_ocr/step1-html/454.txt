and Roumania, and is rather mystified as to<br/>
what Austria will do in the event of war. Relying upon Germany and treating Great Britain<br/>
with studied politeness, it views the present<br/>
critical position with perfect coolness and<br/>
indifference.<br/>

<br/>
ORE than fifteen years ago I made<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>diligent but unsuccessful search for a<br/>
plan of organization which would<br/>
make it possible for pupils to advance in grade<br/>
as they were able, in place of being hurried or<br/>
held back by others. This search revealed the<br/>
fact that the plan universally used was defended<br/>
by none, and almost unanimously condemned,<br/>
not only by parents and teachers, but even by<br/>
boards of education and superintendents who<br/>
were responsible for the method.<br/>
<br/>
This method requires all children to move<br/>
at the same pace, regardless of a hundred<br/>
differing factors which <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>their progress. The teachers have been compelled to<br/>
waste their energy in striving to stretch those<br/>
mentally "short" and compress those who are<br/>
mentally "long," that all may appear equal to<br/>
the mythical average pupil. A system which<br/>
would not be tolerated for the physical development of children is no better for their mental<br/>
development. The decree of uniformity is:<br/>
"In together, all together, on together, out<br/>
together" -if there are any left with sufficient<br/>
intellectual life to get to the top of the mental<br/>
tread-mill.<br/>
<br/>
A COMPARISON OF PLANS<br/>
<br/>
Having failed to find a satisfactory plan, I<br/>
worked out one which produced results entirely<br/>
different. These results were secured by<br/>
making it easily possible to keep pupils of about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ty </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lal </span>advancement together at all times, that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>e work might be accurately suited to the<br/>
needs and capacities of all. This much desired<br/>
<br/>
end was reached by the abolition of the promotion examination, and by allowing pupils<br/>
to advance at any time by a number of short<br/>
steps rather than once a year by a long jump.<br/>
<br/>
By the usual plan, a pupil who falls a month<br/>
behind drags along until the end of the term,<br/>
fails to be promoted, and loses a year. Thus<br/>
thousands of years are lost unnecessarily.<br/>
Why should a pupil lose a year when but a<br/>
month or so behind his class? By the flexible<br/>
plan of grading, which many have adopted, a<br/>
pupil, who for any reason falls a month behind,<br/>
drops back that distance, which may easily be<br/>
made up if he has the ability and the disposition<br/>
to do so. For this reason, pupils lose only the<br/>
time they should lose.<br/>
<br/>
Under the old plan, pupils are moved to<br/>
advance work at the time arbitrarily fixed,<br/>
when it is hoped even the slower ones may be<br/>
ready. Is it any wonder that 85 per cent.<br/>
lose time under such a plan? Need we be surprised that the records prove that few, if any,<br/>
finish the course in less than eight years, and<br/>
that the large majority of those who have not<br/>
become <span style="color: #0000FF;">discouraged </span>take almost ten years<br/>
to do the work? Why should we be surprised<br/>
that 80 per cent. of the pupils in the public<br/>
schools of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">United </span>States are found in the<br/>
four lowest years of a twelve-year course?<br/>
Under the new plan, pupils take up advance<br/>
work when they are ready for it. By so doing,<br/>
80 per cent. below the high school save time.<br/>
Seventy-five per cent. of those who completed<br/>
the grammar course in Elizabeth, N. J., last<br/>
year did so in less than eight years. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Twelve<br/>
