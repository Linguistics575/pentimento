men will <span style="color: #0000FF;">remember </span>the result. It was the<br/>
most disastrous panic and the most deplorable<br/>
depression in the history of our day.<br/>
<br/>
The conspiracy hinted at in the opening<br/>
paragraphs of this article would probably<br/>
plunge the country into a catastrophe the<br/>
like of which has never been seen. With the<br/>
sudden withdrawal of the money that is the<br/>
basis of credit, the whole structure would<br/>
tumble like a house of cards. In 1893, the<br/>
great railroads were using credit in hundreds of<br/>
millions of dollars. As the gold <span style="color: #ff0000;">ebbed </span>away<br/>
from the banks and the Treasury, the credit<br/>
vanished. Half the railroads of the United<br/>
States collapsed with it. Wall Street, that<br/>
strange, dark-shadowed, light-hearted marketplace of billions, does business almost entirely<br/>
on credit. With the withdrawal of gold, a<br/>
panic would sweep the Street that would make<br/>
all other panics of the past seem like the murmuring of a summer breeze upon the sea.<br/>
Stock values would not fall; they would <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappear</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Let us imagine that the conspirators, to complete the ruin, determined to hold their money<br/>
entirely out of commerce for a period of years,<br/>
using it neither <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nor </span>abroad, but simply<br/>
locking it up and drawing upon it only for their<br/>
own immediate needs. If the gold were<br/>
immediately put in circulation in Europe, it<br/>
would gradually come back, following the<br/>
natural law that money flows to the centre of<br/>
greatest demand. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">plotters</span>, then, to make<br/>
their work doubly certain, cap the conspiracy<br/>
by locking up in their vaults all the gold that<br/>
they have been able to collect.<br/>
<br/>
Let it come at a flood-tide of commerce, or<br/>
at ebb, it would not matter. Perhaps, if the<br/>
streams of commerce were full to their very<br/>
banks, the disaster would be the worse. Let<br/>
it be so. Let us suppose that all the great<br/>
plants are running full; that the books are<br/>
crammed with orders; that millions of extra<br/>
men are working at the forges, at the looms, in<br/>
the mills, along the railroad right-of-way, on<br/>
the docks, at the engine-throttle, everywhere;<br/>
that wages are at their highest, and prices of<br/>
food and clothing at the top. Let us suppose,<br/>
in fact, that to-day is the day.<br/>
<br/>
Then, to-morrow, the sun of commerce stands<br/>
still in the heavens. Blight falls upon the<br/>
world, -like the dew at night, missing nothing.<br/>
The greater merchants hasten to cancel ail<br/>
orders at the mills. The loom and the forge<br/>
grow silent and dark. In time a million<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">MONEY-KIN'GS<br/>
<br/>
</span>men walk the streets, looking in vain for work<br/>
where no work is. The labor union falls of<br/>
its own weight and dies. The wage-scale melts<br/>
away. Prices of food and drink and clothing<br/>
do not merely fall; they, too, like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prices </span>of<br/>
stocks, come down to nothing. For the country faces, at one stroke, the very depths of<br/>
national poverty, the very exhaustion of its<br/>
basic wealth that once or twice before it faced,<br/>
but only <span style="color: #0000FF;">after </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>long and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bitter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">struggle</span>, sinking<br/>
slowly to the depths like a great plate through<br/>
the water.<br/>
<br/>
For commerce, industry, capital, labor,<br/>
investment, life-all things in <span style="color: #0000FF;">fact-are </span>but<br/>
an inverted pyramid, standing upon a moiety<br/>
of real money, gold. The commerce of this<br/>
country, in all forms, calls each year for transactions through banks that aggregate from <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOO<br/>
</span>billions to <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>billions of dollars. Technically,<br/>
these transactions are called "bank clearings."<br/>
They represent the year's business, perhaps<br/>
as closely as it can be represented. It is all<br/>
based upon that billion of gold, commercial<br/>
gold, in the Treasury and the banks. That is<br/>
the apex of the pyramid. The "clearings"<br/>
represent the money and credit used in <span style="color: #ff0000;">manufacture</span>, trade, industry, merchandising, wages,<br/>
rents, taxes-the thousand and one things that<br/>
make up the activities of human life. That<br/>
is the pyramid itself. It is merely an alloy;<br/>
nearly all of it is credit, very little of it is<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
CREDIT'S PLACE IN THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">SYSTEM<br/>
<br/>
</span>It is the type of our civilization. In the days<br/>
of barter there was no credit. A man might<br/>
trade a carven spear for a comely <span style="color: #ff0000;">slairp</span>, then<br/>
trade again the slave for a flint. The richest<br/>
man in all the tribe might gather up his goods<br/>
and go, and no other man would be the poorer.<br/>
But we have made for our needs a wonderful<br/>
system. We call it money. It involves banks,<br/>
treasuries, coins, bills, notes-a thousand<br/>
agencies, little and big. It is our servant; we<br/>
are its slaves. You and I, being poor men and<br/>
not of much account in the world of commerce,<br/>
may laugh at it, knowing that we, too, like <span style="color: #0000FF;">our<br/>
</span>far-distant ancestor, may take our goods and<br/>
go, and no man will care much. But he, our<br/>
neighbor, being a man of many millions, cannot<br/>
go. He is caught in the web of credit.<br/>
He cannot get away without destroying, or<br/>
threatening to destroy, that web. And the web<br/>
is his life, the very thing that makes him the<br/>
rich man that he is. Therefore <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>stays.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
