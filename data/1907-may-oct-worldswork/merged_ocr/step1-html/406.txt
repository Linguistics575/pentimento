<br/>
Twenty-three per cent. of all shipwrecks<br/>
on the Atlantic shore of the United States occur<br/>
on Cape Cod, which rivals even Hatteras in<br/>
treachery. According to the reports of the<br/>
Government lighthouse keepers, 6,000 steam<br/>
vessels and 24,000 sailing vessels annually<br/>
pass through the Vineyard Sound route between<br/>
New York and Boston. The freight handled<br/>
amounts to about 25,000,000 tons, 10,000,000<br/>
tons of which are coal for the factories of New<br/>
England. The danger to which this important<br/>
traffic is constantly subjected around Cape<br/>
Cod is shown by the figures of the United States<br/>
Life-Saving Service:<br/>
<br/>
From October 1, 1875, to July 1, 1895, 137<br/>
vessels were lost, $ 1,615,245 worth of property<br/>
was destroyed, and 63 lives <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>lost. From July<br/>
1, 1895, to January I, 1899, there were on an<br/>
average one vessel and one life lost on Cape<br/>
Cod every month and a half. As the traffic<br/>
grows, this record will probably increase.<br/>
Since a comparatively short canal would<br/>
eliminate the dangers of this route, it is surprising that the work was not done long ago.<br/>
<br/>
The need of a canal across the narrow part<br/>
of Cape Cod was recognized 230 years ago,<br/>
and there have been agitations for it from time<br/>
to time ever since. In 1676, there was a movement among the inhabitants of the village of<br/>
Sandwich, on the northern shores of Cape<br/>
Cod peninsula, to construct a waterway from<br/>
the north shore to the headwaters of Monument River, which was then so far navigable<br/>
that just a narrow neck of land prevented the<br/>
connection. The matter was taken to the<br/>
general court of Massachusetts, but nothing<br/>
was accomplished. Twenty years later, a<br/>
legislative committee was appointed, but it<br/>
<br/>
was not until 1776 that any actual step was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">taken </span>A surveying party began laying out<br/>
the route for a canal, but the work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Revolution.<br/>
During President Monroe's administration,<br/>
while the nation's commerce was on a boom,<br/>
the agitation took the shape of a petition to<br/>
Congress. But the matter received no <span style="color: #0000FF;">friend</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lier </span>recognition than a pigeon-hole at Washington. The Federal Government caused surveys<br/>
to be made in the early'sixties, but the Civil<br/>
War stopped this attempt. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">187 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span>, the chief<br/>
of the Coast Survey reported that the isthmus<br/>
could be crossed by a sea-level waterway, but<br/>
no actual work was begun. The next <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement </span>was on the part of an inventor, Mr. F. A.<br/>
Lockwood, of Boston, who hoped to prove the<br/>
virtues of a new dredge of his own design by<br/>
establishing this almost mythical waterway.<br/>
Nearly a mile of the canal had been dug when<br/>
the dredge broke down; the death of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inventor </span>about that time ended the work.<br/>
<br/>
At last, Mr. DeWitt Clinton Flanagan, whose<br/>
father left him an interest in a vast dredging<br/>
enterprise, became interested in the scheme<br/>
which for almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">30 </span>years had been associated<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">idle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dreams </span>and wrecked hopes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Flanagan </span>visited the sandy isthmus, tramped across<br/>
it, saw with his own eyes what could be done,<br/>
and went back to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>to think the matter<br/>
over. Could the canal be built? How much<br/>
money would it take? Would it pay as an<br/>
investment? These were the questions which<br/>
had to be settled. He engaged Mr. A. L.<br/>
Rives and Mr. E. L. Corthell to determine the<br/>
engineering propositions, and dived into statistics himself to figure out the possibilities of<br/>
profit in the enterprise. He saw that the canal<br/>
could be built, and satisfied himself that it<br/>
would be a paying investment. He then<br/>
applied to the Massachusetts Legislature for a<br/>
charter, depositing with the State Treasurer<br/>
the required $ 200,000.<br/>
