man will say, "It is a place to put your money<br/>
so that it will be safe." He means a savings<br/>
bank. Another, a learned one, replies, "It is<br/>
an institution established to certify credits."<br/>
He means a commercial bank. Yet another<br/>
declares that it is "an investment institution,<br/>
into which you put your money for safe-keeping<br/>
and profit." He probably means a trust company, or perhaps a private bank. As a matter<br/>
of sober fact, the term "bank" is now so<br/>
broad that it cannot be defined in a few<br/>
words. For example, a savings bank in New<br/>
York state is as different from a savings<br/>
bank in Maine as a steamship is from <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>full-rigged ship.<br/>
<br/>
The object of these articles is to bring out<br/>
some of the most striking facts about banks,<br/>
bankers, and banking. It is full time that the<br/>
people came to understand some of these mysteries. Whatever a bank may be, it will be at<br/>
once evident, from the introduction to this<br/>
article, that it not only holds the people's money,<br/>
but also that it is the most important of all<br/>
the agencies that make for prosperity or the reverse in the country. The time is coming, and<br/>
swiftly, when the bank will take the place of<br/>
the railroad as the centre of the popular interest<br/>
and the popular agitation. From a fair working knowledge of the ways of both the railroad<br/>
and the bank, I believe that the latter is not<br/>
only the more immediately important to the<br/>
people, but also the more worthy of public<br/>
attention on account of methods and manners.<br/>
<br/>
THE BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>
<br/>
Briefly, it is well to outline the banking<br/>
situation in this country. I prefer to do it in a<br/>
table, taken from the report made by the<br/>
Government last October. The table shows<br/>
the number of banks of various sorts, and the<br/>
amount of deposits in each. It is important<br/>
only because it is the basis of the whole series<br/>
of articles that is to follow<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

Anyone who cares to revise the figures is at<br/>
liberty to do so. Later figures are available<br/>
for the national and savings banks, but not<br/>
for the whole list. At the worst, changes are<br/>
<br/>
MONEY-KINGS<br/>
<br/>
comparatively slight. This table is recent<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here arises a mystery. It was shown<br/>
earlier in this article that all the banks have<br/>
in their vaults only <span style="color: #ff0000;">$ </span>h, <span style="color: #ff0000;">rcxo</span>, coo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">roco </span>of cash.<br/>
Then, you may ask, how is it that the Government shows that there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3,000,000,000 </span>of<br/>
deposits in these banks? And if the conspirators of whom you write can get nearly the<br/>
whole of that billion dollars of real money,<br/>
what do the rest of us get?<br/>
<br/>
You get credit, that is all. It is nothing to<br/>
be alarmed about, for the credit is good. Let<br/>
us say that the table shows $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">11,000</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo<br/>
</span>of deposits against which the banks have no<br/>
cash to report. If not cash, what then? The<br/>
answer is simple. A very large part of the<br/>
balance is represented by first-class <span style="color: #0000FF;">bonds-government</span>, railroad, municipal-or real estate.<br/>
An even larger part is balanced against the<br/>
trade of to-morrow. It includes notes issued<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gainst </span>the cotton crop, the wheat crop, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn<br/>
</span>crop; or notes of the great manufacturers, issued<br/>
against orders that are to be filled within six<br/>
months; in fact, that balance which supports<br/>
your bank account means the commerce, the<br/>
industry, the business of this country. Is it<br/>
not good enough? In England, they figure that<br/>
if the combined banks show one dollar of cash<br/>
for every nineteen dollars of such credits the<br/>
banks are sound. With us, the proportion is<br/>
about one to ten. If the United States is not<br/>
good enough security, take your money from<br/>
the bank and hide it in a stocking.<br/>
<br/>
The bank is just as sound as are the people<br/>
that run it. If your bank president is a burglar,<br/>
a thief, or a pirate by birth and election, then<br/>
it is not a safe bank, no matter under what law<br/>
it is organized. If the cashier is a gambler or a<br/>
race-track follower, your money, or some of it,<br/>
is in danger. In some few cases-or perhaps it<br/>
would be truer to say in many cases-you must<br/>
look to the law under which your bank is<br/>
regulated and inspected; but the point of first<br/>
importance is-the man that runs the bank.<br/>
<br/>
THE OVERLORD OF CREDIT<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, this study of the banks and<br/>
bankers of the United States begins with a<br/>
man. He is a man who has built up in the<br/>
midst of a presumed Republic of Banks<br/>
a little plutocracy. You will find the heart<br/>
and centre of this plutocracy in the middle of<br/>
the western edge of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">flat-ttTIN </span>desk located<br/>
in a small office in the southwest <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
