<span>INVESTING MONEY BY SMALL<br/>
INSTALMENTS<br/>
<br/>
"Some months I have $ 50 of savings, and other<br/>
months it is as low as $ 10. There is only one savings<br/>
bank in town, and I have as big an account in it as it<br/>
will take. It pays me <span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>per cent. I cannot buy bonds<br/>
because they are too large. I am afraid to buy stocks,<br/>
because I do not know anything about them. The amount<br/>
of money is too small to loan as it comes in. What<br/>
would you advise as a safe means of investing these<br/>
small savings as they accumulate?"<br/>
<br/>
The above extract from a letter puts pretty<br/>
clearly the case of hundreds of savers and<br/>
would-be investors throughout the country.<br/>
Most bonds and notes are issued in blocks of<br/>
$ 1,000 and upward, which puts them out of<br/>
the reach of any man who desires merely to<br/>
invest current savings. Yet bonds and notes<br/>
are unquestionably the safest medium for savings of this kind. What has Wall Street provided to meet this demand?<br/>
<br/>
Let us take the case of the man who will<br/>
have an average of $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">100 </span>every six months for<br/>
investment or for a savings bank. At the outset, good advice would be to leave it in the<br/>
savings bank until the limit is reached. In this<br/>
state, the limit is $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">3,000</span>, not for each family, but<br/>
for each individual. An account can be opened<br/>
for father, mother, and each of the children, if<br/>
one care to do it. In the case of banks that pay<br/>
4 per cent., in New York, this is good sense.<br/>
Not everyone is fitted to become an investor.<br/>
<br/>
Failing this, and presupposing that the saver<br/>
wants to be an investor, there are half a dozen<br/>
ways in which he can do it with safety and with<br/>
profit. First of all comes the municipal bond.<br/>
New York City, for example, issues its own<br/>
bonds, or stocks, in lots as low as $ 10. The<br/>
saver can get them, to yield 4 per cent. or more.<br/>
They have some advantage in being tax-free<br/>
in this state. Similarly, in every state there<br/>
will be found plenty of strong municipal bonds,<br/>
tax-free, that can be bought in very small<br/>
blocks. Even Ohio, which taxes nearly everything, is now exempting its municipals. I<br/>
believe that it will be found profitable in nearly<br/>
every case to get any bonds of this sort registered in your own name, rather than have to<br/>
collect the coupons every six months. Of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">course</span>, that is a matter of preference<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>The United States Government issues its<br/>
bonds in small blocks, usually from $ 50 up,<br/>
but the Panama Canal loan is from $ 20 up.<br/>
These bonds are so high in price, owing to<br/>
special causes, that they may not be regarded<br/>
as fit investments for savings. The new<br/>
Japanese 4 per cent. loan in this country is in<br/>
blocks of $ 50, $ 100, etc. One Mexican bond<br/>
listed on the Stock Exchange may be bought in<br/>
lots of $ 100 and multiples of that sum. These<br/>
last two issues are not suitable for every saver<br/>
of money, but they are fairly good all-around<br/>
investments for the average man to own.<br/>
<br/>
Turning to corporation bonds, which should<br/>
naturally constitute the largest part of the<br/>
investment of the people, one finds only a few<br/>
of the big, popular, widely scattered bond<br/>
issues made in blocks of $ 100 or less. Some<br/>
of the very old bonds, such as the Alabama &<br/>
Vicksburg or the Atlanta & West Point issues,<br/>
created to attract the subscriptions of the<br/>
neighbors, were made in such small blocks.<br/>
In fact, the Southern railroads have always been<br/>
inclined to make their bonds smaller than the<br/>
Northern bonds, because popular subscription<br/>
has very often been essential to the building of<br/>
the smaller roads of the South.<br/>
<br/>
The smallest listed railroad bond of which<br/>
I know anything was issued in 1877, and will<br/>
be paid off next July. It is called the Buffalo<br/>
& Southwestern first-mortgage bond. It bears<br/>
6per cent., and was issued in blocks of $ 50.<br/>
The road is a part of the Erie. There are two<br/>
or three other small bond issues on the old<br/>
branches of the Erie that have bonds in blocks<br/>
of $ 100, but all the well-known newer bonds of<br/>
that system are in blocks of from $ 500 upward.<br/>
If one go through the list of bonds, it will be<br/>
discovered that nearly all the issues in blocks<br/>
of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span>are dated in the twenty years from<br/>
1865 to 1885. It was a period in which the<br/>
builders of roads sought to enlist the sympathies and get the help of the people through<br/>
whose land they built.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, an occasional railroad makes its<br/>
bonds in such small blocks, but usually it is<br/>
only when the bonds are to be listed in Germany, or France, or Holland. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">41 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>per<br/>
