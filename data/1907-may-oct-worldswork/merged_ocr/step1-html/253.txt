<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">PRESIDENTE </span>INDIANAPOLIS SPEECH<br/>
<br/>
of the people was so unmistakable. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">anti</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harriman </span>flame has swept the country, <span style="color: #0000FF;">kind</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ling fires not merely in the newspapers but in<br/>
the social clubs, the associations of <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufacturers</span>, shippers, agriculturists, lawmakers,<br/>
and even preachers of the gospel. The attack<br/>
is not so much on Mr. Harriman as on the things<br/>
for which the name of Mr. Harriman has come<br/>
to stand. The public, the shippers, the consumers, the railroad employees, the stockholders, are in open revolt against high-handed administration. The divine right of magnates, so<br/>
tersely expressed by Mr. Geo. F. Baer during<br/>
the coal strike, has received a very severe jolt.<br/>
<br/>
Out of it will come weakness, then strength.<br/>
When any great mechanism is suddenly thrown<br/>
out of gear, the jolt is apt to be disturbing.<br/>
The insubordination and the re-adjustment of<br/>
this year have thrown out of gear the most<br/>
complicated machine and the greatest machine<br/>
in America-the administrative function of our<br/>
huge corporations. Luckily, the first shock<br/>
fell upon Wall Street, and the people barely<br/>
felt it. It is too much to hope that the great<br/>
industrial life of the country can escape scotfree; but there seems fair hope that the disturbance that must follow will be neither very<br/>
serious nor very protracted.<br/>
<br/>
When the shock passes, the machine will<br/>
probably run much better than before. The<br/>
people of the United States look forward with<br/>
confidence to the day when real railroad men<br/>
will run the railroads, administer their policies,<br/>
and plan their operations. The people demand<br/>
that the railroad executive function be divorced<br/>
entirely from the Wall Street ticker, at least<br/>
in relation to the traffic, the making of rates,<br/>
and all the other phases of the administration<br/>
with which the people come in contact. And<br/>
the people are right. The country needs and<br/>
must have railroad men who can get much<br/>
nearer the people of the West than they can<br/>
get by a visit to the Chicago Club.<br/>
<br/>
The measure of the prosperity of the railroads and the people in the next few years will<br/>
be the measure of the unanimity with which<br/>
the railroad magnates lay aside the fiction of<br/>
prerogative with which they have deceived<br/>
themselves for the last ten years and come down<br/>
into the open to meet the people face to face<br/>
and hand to hand, not in struggle <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>in<br/>
friendly service. All signs-but one or <span style="color: #0000FF;">two-point </span>to this regeneration. It must come, and<br/>
the blind men who shall oppose it will be<br/>
swept aside by the current of the time,<br/>

THE CHECK <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>RAILROAD BETTERMENT<br/>
<br/>
HE greatest hurt done by the railroad<br/>
<br/>
agitation has been to increase the dif..<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">iiculty </span>of the roads in borrowing money for<br/>
better equipment, for extensions, for larger<br/>
terminals, for double tracks, and such other<br/>
improvements as their great volume of traffic<br/>
demands. This disadvantage in many cases<br/>
is real and serious-with the railroads of the<br/>
South, for example. But the check thus put<br/>
upon improvement and extension will at the<br/>
worst be temporary. If favorable conditions<br/>
continue in the business world, these extensions<br/>
and improvements will be made-more slowly<br/>
than if large sums could immediately be <span style="color: #0000FF;">bor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rowed</span>, but none the less surely. And a <span style="color: #0000FF;">temporary </span>disadvantage, however serious, does<br/>
not counterbalance the permanent advantage<br/>
of bringing railroad practice into proper<br/>
relation with good conduct and with other<br/>
activities of the people. No serious student<br/>
of large tendencies can forget that a little while<br/>
ago it was not an absurd question to ask<br/>
whether the railroads would rule the people<br/>
or the people rule the railroads. But this<br/>
question is now not seriously asked in any<br/>
quarter. If in any quarter it be now asked<br/>
whether the railroads will continue to pay,<br/>
the answer is that if they paid under reckless<br/>
financial management they ought ultimately<br/>
to do better under safeguarding regulation.<br/>
<br/>
THE PRESIDENT'S INDIANAPOLIS SPEECH<br/>
<br/>
RESIDENT ROOSEVELT, in his recent<br/>
<br/>
speech at Indianapolis, set himself the<br/>
task of stating and explaining these two propositions-that the regulation of railroads was<br/>
not going to cease, and that their regulation<br/>
would not unsettle values. Events are proving the truth of both propositions, and neither<br/>
involves any radical thought or conduct.<br/>
<br/>
But as a literary task, so to call it, the explanation of both these propositions required the<br/>
frequent use of balanced sentiments and<br/>
sentences and of the preposition but. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">captious </span>critics of the President have made<br/>
much of his this but that. Yet there isn't a<br/>
man who heard or read the speech that did not<br/>
understand it and that did not clearly see that<br/>
its purpose was to allay financial apprehension,<br/>
if any financial apprehension exist, and to<br/>
allay it without changing the Administration's<br/>
policy at all. It had that effect; and whether<br/>
that effect were produced by the use of many<br/>
buts or in spite of them is a problem for<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
