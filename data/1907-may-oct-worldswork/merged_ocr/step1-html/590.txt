<span>9388 THE<br/>
use of franchises and by wrong corporation<br/>
methods and by the wrong use of <span style="color: #0000FF;">banking<br/>
</span>facilities. And these things must stop!<br/>
<br/>
Every Man's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Duty</span>, Then<br/>
<br/>
What, then, is the plain duty of every man of<br/>
affairs in a time like this? Ought he to go<br/>
about crying alarm and declaring that the<br/>
Administration's "war on trusts" is bringing<br/>
anarchy? This tide against unjust corporate<br/>
acts runs far deeper than any activity of any<br/>
Administration; for, if the present public mood<br/>
continue, the next Administration may <span style="color: #0000FF;">be-may </span>have to be-far more "belligerent" than<br/>
this. Secretary Taft is perhaps the most conservative and judicial and safe man who is<br/>
spoken of as a possible Presidential candidate<br/>
of either party; yet he takes essentially the<br/>
same stand as President Roosevelt, and rightly<br/>
calls it "conservative." For the alternative<br/>
is Bryan or Hearst. The people are not going<br/>
back to the old ways of corporate domination.<br/>
<br/>
The first duty of every man of affairs is to<br/>
keep his common sense and not talk about a<br/>
possible panic.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Next</span>, he will conduct his own business with<br/>
common sense. He will not conclude that his<br/>
success or failure is determined by "the<br/>
Administration" or "the times," but <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>by his own management.<br/>
<br/>
If he has doubtful debtors, he will collect<br/>
his bills as fast as he can. He will see that his<br/>
finances and his business methods are sound;<br/>
and he will work harder than ever to keep them<br/>
so. If he has been wise, he has already created<br/>
a reserve for just such possible emergencies,<br/>
so that he will not be dependent, even at the<br/>
worst, on the money-market while it is high.<br/>
He will reduce his expenses wherever he can<br/>
without doing structural harm to his business;<br/>
and he will not make or accumulate a large<br/>
surplus stock of wares.<br/>
<br/>
The Large Results That Are Coming<br/>
<br/>
The business of the country is good. It is<br/>
active and sound. There is not enough available capital for the rapid expansion of many<br/>
great industries, but there is a plenty of money<br/>
for ordinary productive uses. The adjustment<br/>
of corporation conduct to a new standard of<br/>
morals is causing a shock-that is the chief<br/>
trouble. Industrial stocks lessen in value and<br/>
other stocks fall in sympathy<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>This was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inevitable</span>. Some sound companies and many<br/>
innocent investors will suffer some loss. But<br/>
<br/>
MARCH OF<br/>
<br/>
EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
these losses are the necessary incidents of a<br/>
change to a sounder basis of conduct. The<br/>
foundations of prosperity are not shaken. And<br/>
the acceptance of the inevitable will make the<br/>
change easy and safe; and the future will be<br/>
far more secure against disturbance and panic<br/>
than any period of our past has <span style="color: #ff0000;">been.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>The inevitable changes that are taking<br/>
place are:<br/>
<br/>
A more honest conduct of corporations;<br/>
<br/>
A loosening of the grip of the financial kings<br/>
on the surplus capital of the whole country; and<br/>
<br/>
A reform of the tariff.<br/>
<br/>
The sooner these tasks are done, the sooner<br/>
we shall be rid of both real and imaginary<br/>
reasons for fear of harm to our vast and prosperous industrial structure.<br/>
<br/>
THE HONEST MAN'S LAND<br/>
<br/>
IN THE light of this fundamental awaken<br/>
ing and of this change that is demanded<br/>
in corporation methods and morals, there is<br/>
something silly and pitiful in the attitude of<br/>
Wall Street to the President.<br/>
<br/>
"Where will he stop?"<br/>
<br/>
"What will he do next?"<br/>
<br/>
"Can't something be done to change his<br/>
conduct?"<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, this is far too flattering to<br/>
the President's power. He does not hold the<br/>
prosperity of the country in the hollow of his<br/>
hand. From another point of view, it is a<br/>
sort of insult to him to assume that, having<br/>
started on a clearly defined policy, he is going<br/>
to turn back because the price <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>securities<br/>
falls. He is not that kind of man, and nobody<br/>
wishes that he were.<br/>
<br/>
Then, again, while Mr. Roosevelt's method<br/>
is his own, the general course of action of the<br/>
<br/>
.Administration is the action of the American<br/>
<br/>
people; and the "criminally rich" may just.<br/>
as well recognize this fact. Mr. Roosevelt is<br/>
only one of the people's instruments.<br/>
<br/>
To a student of our national temperament<br/>
and mood, who has watched the course of<br/>
events for the last few years, these things are as<br/>
plain as the nose on a man's face.<br/>
<br/>
Plain also is this danger: if the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>interests stand in the way of the punishment of the guilty or try to prevent the adoption<br/>
of a higher standard of corporate conduct,<br/>
they will bring a stronger class-feeling, a deeper<br/>
hatred by the poor of the rich. The people<br/>
of the United States-the great masses of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">people-stand </span>with President Roosevelt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
