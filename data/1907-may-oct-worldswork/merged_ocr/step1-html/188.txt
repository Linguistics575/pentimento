<br/>
librarian is no longer a mere curator of books<br/>
but a well-trained, professional man, the<br/>
library has been recognized as an active force<br/>
in college life.<br/>
<br/>
Their growth, however, has not been entirely<br/>
intensive. Since 1895, the University of Virginia has erected a $ 60,000 library building and<br/>
has added 50,000 volumes to the 12,000 saved<br/>
from the disastrous fire which destroyed its<br/>
former library. In North Carolina, Trinity<br/>
College has received a splendid $ 50,000 building since 1899 and has increased its book collection from 11,000 to 37,000 volumes. In<br/>
September of the present year, the University<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>North Carolina will house its present <span style="color: #0000FF;">col</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>lection of 45,000 volumes in a new, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fireproof<br/>
</span>structure and will enjoy, in addition to its<br/>
present library revenues, the income from a<br/>
new $ 55,000 endowment fund for books. At<br/>
the Universities of Georgia and Louisiana,<br/>
$ 50,000 library buildings have been occupied<br/>
in the last four years and material additions<br/>
have been made to the original collections.<br/>
South Carolina, Texas, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tennessee</span>, and Alabama have each added one or more college<br/>
library buildings since 1905; and since January<br/>
of the present year, Florida has received a<br/>
gift of $ 40,000 for library purposes at Stetson<br/>
University.<br/>

BOOKS FOR RURAL DISTRICTS<br/>
<br/>
The traveling library, too, has firmly <span style="color: #0000FF;">estab-</span>.<br/>
lished itself in the South and has met with<br/>
immediate success. Its general adoption in<br/>
rural and sparsely settled communities is certain, being conditioned solely upon a proper<br/>
provision by the states for its care and direction. Georgia inaugurated the movement in<br/>
1898. By 1905 twenty-three schools had been<br/>
added to the traveling list; ninety-seven schools<br/>
and forty-six rural communities had received<br/>
circulating collections; 4,174 magazines and<br/>
periodicals had been sent out; and since 1898,<br/>
800 schools have been influenced to make<br/>
permanent improvements upon their <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolhouses </span>or grounds; 400 have established libraries of their own; forty-six rural communities<br/>
have founded village improvement societies, and<br/>
a total of 5,468 books have been kept in constant<br/>
circulation. In North Carolina and Texas,<br/>
the movement has found strong support in the<br/>
Federation of Women's Clubs. In Virginia<br/>
the traveling libraries have been placed under<br/>
direct state control. A fund of $ 7,500 was<br/>
appropriated for their maintenance for two<br/>

THE GROWTH OF THE LIBRARIES<br/>
<br/>
years. Free transportation was received from<br/>
the railroads; and thus the small Virginia<br/>
village, which hitherto has contented itself<br/>
with its general store, post-office, school, and<br/>
church, has been brought under the broadening, vitalizing influence of the open book.<br/>
<br/>
The most conclusive proof of library development is the state library association. In<br/>
seven of the Southern States, such an organization-composed of librarians, trustees, educators, members of social clubs, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">cthers</span>--has<br/>
been formed. With a membership of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,000</span>, these<br/>
associations have given serious consideration<br/>
to various library problems and have worked<br/>
toward one common end-the popularization<br/>
of the library movement and the creation of a<br/>
public sentiment sufficiently strong to insure<br/>
every community some form of library<br/>
facilities. The state library commissions<br/>
of Maryland, Virginia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tennessee</span>, and Georgia<br/>
have grown out of the state associations and<br/>
have placed all forms of public library activity<br/>
upon a permanent basis. In North Carolina,<br/>
Alabama, and Texas, the state associations<br/>
have not yet succeeded in securing definite<br/>
legislation, but the need has been clearly<br/>
shown and the demand, sooner or later, will<br/>
be met..<br/>
<br/>
In Georgia and Texas, library progress of<br/>
all kinds has been longer lived and the results<br/>
are more satisfying. In South Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida, growth has been less<br/>
evident. But everywhere throughout the South<br/>
undisputed progress has been made. Three<br/>
facts in this connection are significant. The<br/>
first is that the American Library Association<br/>
held its annual meeting this year in Asheville. <span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
</span>A development of sufficient magnitude in the<br/>
South brought this deliberative body to the<br/>
Southern field for the discussion of special<br/>
problems of the Southern libraries.<br/>
<br/>
The second is that, at its last <span style="color: #0000FF;">annual </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meeting</span>,<br/>
the Southern Educational Association created<br/>
a permanent department of libraries, thereby<br/>
insuring the library due consideration in the<br/>
educational work of the South.<br/>
<br/>
The third, and the most significant, is that<br/>
there is now in Atlanta a highly developed,<br/>
well-attended library training school. This<br/>
marks the passing of the untrained librarian<br/>
in the South.<br/>
<br/>
In the last ten years, the Southern library<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>made a long stride forward. It has been<br/>
making for a broader culture and for a larger<br/>
view of life. Its success is assured.<br/>
