</span>Belt and label his description "The Southern<br/>
People." It may be that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Porto </span>Rican is<br/>
called a "trickster" in other parts of the<br/>
Caribbean; the natives from other parts of<br/>
the Caribbean are sometimes called by worse<br/>
names in Porto Rico. My own experience<br/>
has been that the native Porto Rican is, as a<br/>
rule, more honest than many classes with<br/>
which he has to deal. Half a dozen regiments<br/>
landed on his island in 1898, and gave the native<br/>
his golden opportunity for trickery. The<br/>
soldiers knew nothing then of the value of<br/>
Porto Rican currency; they bought things to<br/>
eat, handed out an American coin, and took<br/>
what change was offered. Gradually the men<br/>
learned the proper rate of exchange and were<br/>
in a position to recognize any attempt at<br/>
cheating. That there was some cheating must<br/>
<br/>
be taken for granted; yet I mingled for months<br/>
with the men of these regiments and I cannot<br/>
recall a single instance of that kind. The<br/>
soldiers trusted the natives more implicitly<br/>
than they trusted each other.<br/>
<br/>
There is much more that might be said of<br/>
the work of the United States in Porto Rico,<br/>
but it would be only a prolongation of the same<br/>
note of progress. Just among ourselves, we<br/>
may say with some degree of satisfaction that<br/>
we have administered the island honestly, in<br/>
the interest of its people rather than of ourselves. And if some non-office-holding native<br/>
now and then fills the air with his discordant<br/>
wail, there is an abundance of undeniable<br/>
records that will show what Porto Rico was<br/>
when the Spanish went down beyond the horizon and what it is in this year of grace.<br/>

</span>[ The author of this article made a <span style="color: #0000FF;">personal </span>investigation of the conditions of labor in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>stores of New York City. She questioned the girls themselves, the proprietors and managers of<br/>
the stores, and for some time lived in the "homes" for working girls in various parts of the<br/>
<br/>
city, where she came into intimate relations with them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>Broadway between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thirty-fifth </span>Street<br/>
and Eighth Street, and Fourteenth, Eighteenth<br/>
and Twenty-third Streets between Fifth and<br/>
Sixth Avenues-there are between twenty and<br/>
thirty thousand girls and women employed<br/>
in the dry-goods and department stores, and<br/>
nearly three thousand more who are employed<br/>
in the smaller shops and in the dry-goods and<br/>
department stores of the outlying districts of<br/>
the city. Between two and three thousand<br/>
girls and women are employed in each of the<br/>
larger department stores, and in the smaller<br/>
department stores between three hundred and<br/>
eighteen hundred<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Much has been said of the inhuman conditions under which this great body of young<br/>
women labor. But fairness demands the <span style="color: #0000FF;">state<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scientious </span>effort to preserve the health, happiness, and character of their employees. They<br/>
do this not so much from humanitarian motives,<br/>
perhaps, as from sound business principles.<br/>
<br/>
"The welfare of the help is the welfare of<br/>
the business," is the motto of one of the stores,<br/>
which, in a quiet and unostentatious way, is<br/>
doing a great deal for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>of its<br/>
employees.<br/>
<br/>
In one large department store, where fifteen<br/>
hundred girls and women are employed during<br/>
the slack season and more than two thousand<br/>
during the rush season, a school is maintained<br/>
on one of the upper floors for the younger girls,<br/>
who receive free tuition in the English branches<br/>
during certain hours of each day. Proficiency<br/>
in school work is made a reason for more<br/>
rapid promotion, and many of the present heads<br/>
of departments received most of their education<br/>
in the store-school<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
