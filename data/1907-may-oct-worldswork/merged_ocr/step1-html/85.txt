<br/>
</span>even if our Slavic and Italian and Hebrew<br/>
newcomers represented the solid citizenship<br/>
of the countries from which they spring, as<br/>
did the English and German immigrants of<br/>
forty years ago. But, by common agreement,<br/>
they do not. Our immigrants to-day are not<br/>
only of widely different racial <span style="color: #0000FF;">antecedents</span>;<br/>
they are distinctly inferior to those of earlier<br/>
times in the fundamental qualities of character<br/>
and economic status. In the last analysis,<br/>
the basis of judgment in the matter must be<br/>
the equipment, material and otherwise, which<br/>
the mass of aliens bring for taking up life<br/>
under American conditions and growing with<br/>
fair facility into self-reliant and productive<br/>
citizens. To be quite desirable, the immigrant<br/>
must have sufficient money to enable him to<br/>
live independently until he finds employment<br/>
and has an income upon which to rely for support; he must be sturdy and healthy in body,<br/>
capable of doing as much hard work as his<br/>
station is apt to involve; he must be of fair<br/>
intelligence-not necessarily "educated," perhaps not even able to read or write, but at<br/>
least possessing a mind susceptible of some<br/>
discrimination and sanity of judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these qualities are difficult to <span style="color: #0000FF;">measure<br/>
</span>and it would be foolish to attempt to affirm<br/>
just what proportion of our immigrants to-day<br/>
possess any or all of them, and in what degree.<br/>
Financial equipment is a tangible thing, however, and as that is a matter carefully inquired<br/>
into by the inspectors at our ports, we have<br/>
some information regarding it which is worth<br/>
while. The total amount of money shown<br/>
by the aliens admitted to the country in 1906<br/>
was $ 25,109,413, which looks like a big sum<br/>
until one figures out the average when <span style="color: #0000FF;">distributed </span>among more than a million people.<br/>
As a matter of fact, the record was not so good<br/>
as in the preceding year, when 75,000 fewer<br/>
immigrants brought nearly $ 50,000 more<br/>
money. Moreover, the resources of this sort<br/>
were very unevenly distributed. The 45,079<br/>
English brought an aggregate of $ 2,610,439,<br/>
while three and a half times as many Jews<br/>
brought only $ 2,362,125. The 144,954 Germans and Scandinavians brought $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">5,091,594</span>,<br/>
while 263,655 southern Italians and Greeks<br/>
brought but $ 4,183,398. The average Jew or<br/>
Italian or Greek who lands at the Battery with<br/>
his fifteen dollars has obviously not a very long<br/>
lease of existence unless he finds ready employment, or is supported by friends, or falls<br/>
back upon public charity.<br/>

<br/>
Another fairly tangible standard of measurement is the educational test. What the immigrant's actual capacity of intellect may be<br/>
there are ordinarily small means of knowing.<br/>
But a record is kept of the amount of illiteracy<br/>
and this furnishes an index of considerable<br/>
value. The results thus attained confirm at<br/>
every point the impression that the mass of<br/>
our immigrants to-day will not measure up<br/>
with those of twenty-five, ten, or even five,<br/>
years ago. Of the 964,462 aliens over 14<br/>
years of age who were admitted in 1906,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">265,068 </span>could neither read nor write and 4,755<br/>
could read but not write. The figures for<br/>
1905 were 230,882 and 8,209 respectively.<br/>
That is, while the total illiteracy in 1906 was<br/>
about 28 per cent., that in 1905 was not more<br/>
than 26 per cent., which in turn was an increase of I per cent. over that of 1904.<br/>

IMMIGRATION WAVE, 1820 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1906<br/>
<br/>
</span>Showing the number of immigrants from all countries since the<br/>
preservation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>such statistics began<br/>
<br/>
One aspect of the situation which is capable<br/>
of various interpretations is the fact that the<br/>
percentage of arriving aliens who <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>debarred<br/>
from landing has noticeably increased. In<br/>
1902 the number was 4,974, or .76 per cent.;<br/>
in 1903, 8,769, or 1.02 per cent.; in 1904<br/>
7,952, or .94 per cent.; in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1905</span>, 11,480, or<br/>
1.07 per cent.; and in 1906, 12,432, or 1.06<br/>
per cent. Obviously, in these times of heavy<br/>
immigration the number ought to increase<br/>
absolutely to signify simply the maintenance<br/>
of the traditional degree of <span style="color: #0000FF;">vigilance </span>at our<br/>
ports. Probably most of us would feel that<br/>
it ought also to increase relatively with <span style="color: #0000FF;">mar<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reliableness </span>than the foregoing percentages<br/>
indicate that it does. As a matter of fact,<br/>
during the past eighteen months the proportion<br/>
of the debarred has been rather conspicuously<br/>
declining. It is to be hoped that this is due,<br/>
<br/>
