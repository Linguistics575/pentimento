<span>WHEN TO USE A LAWYER<br/>
<br/>
lots, An action to recover the land was brought<br/>
against the holders; it was tried three times, and<br/>
on each occasion was the subject of extensive<br/>
newspaper comment; after sixteen years the<br/>
suit came to final termination. Meanwhile,<br/>
more than a hundred people bought lots and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>houses. Not until the sheriff notified<br/>
them to leave did they retain counsel. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fortunately</span>, the successor of the original holders<br/>
settled the case at this point and the purchasers<br/>
lost nothing. Negligent people buy property<br/>
from others who do not own it or take over realestate covered with liens of record, or purchase<br/>
"first" -mortgages subject to prior liens, loan<br/>
money on judgments against the husband when<br/>
the wife holds the title or on titles already staggering under the weight of a bad record, not to<br/>
mention loaning without a safe margin on clear<br/>
security. Western mines have been sold to<br/>
Eastern innocents without even color of title.<br/>
<br/>
BEFORE SIGNING ANY KIND OF CONTRACT<br/>
<br/>
Presumably no one would sign a paper that<br/>
he did not understand, but the presumption is<br/>
by no means correct. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that most written agreements that<br/>
are entered into are very imperfectly understood. Few men understand the terms of their<br/>
fire-insurance policies, and many do not appreciate the provisions in their policies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">insurance</span>. Fire-insurance policies have been<br/>
found, too late, to cover stock when fixtures<br/>
were intended to be insured. When a fire<br/>
occurs, it is sometimes discovered that the loss<br/>
is only partly insured when it was supposed to<br/>
be fully covered. Life-insurance policies have<br/>
been issued when, on account of the absence of<br/>
insurable interest, they were wholly void. If<br/>
part of an agreement is in writing, it should all<br/>
be in writing. Nothing should be omitted in<br/>
any case and nothing should be included as a<br/>
matter of form unless it is known to be such.<br/>
Most matters in form are found to be really<br/>
matters of substance, especially when they are<br/>
contained in the printed portion of any contract;<br/>
the lawyer who draws that contract inserts<br/>
every sentence with a purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Many do not know that some agreements are<br/>
absolutely void unless put in writing in such a<br/>
manner that the terms of the agreement can be<br/>
found in the paper itself. Among the most<br/>
important transactions that fall under this rule<br/>
are those pertaining to real-estate. Excepting<br/>
short-term leases, practically all agreements<br/>
for an interest in, to, or out of real-estate must<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
be in writing, and require so much care in<br/>
drafting that success to the inexpert will happen<br/>
mostly as a matter of chance, if at all.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN DRAWING UP DEEDS OR WILLS<br/>
<br/>
To draw the ordinary deed is a rather simple<br/>
matter, but the difficulty arises in distinguishing<br/>
the ordinary deed from one which may have<br/>
certain peculiarities. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">real-estate </span>man once<br/>
remarked to me that he would do all his own<br/>
conveyancing if he had the time. It is fortunate<br/>
that this particular real-estate man seems to<br/>
be unable to give this matter his personal attention, for on at least two occasions he is known<br/>
to have committed errors which might have<br/>
cost him several hundred dollars had the deeds<br/>
which he tendered been accepted. Every<br/>
lawyer has run across deeds which fail to<br/>
sufficiently define the land intended to be conveyed-a fatal error. Through carelessness or<br/>
negligence, provisions may be omitted which<br/>
are decidedly essential and proportionately<br/>
costly.<br/>
<br/>
In regard to wills, we find two contradictory<br/>
popular suppositions; one to the effect that to<br/>
draw a will requires little skill; the other that<br/>
a shrewd lawyer can break any will. Both of<br/>
these impressions are very far from correct.<br/>
Wills should always be drawn by an attorney<br/>
and the instructions should be given by the<br/>
testator (the person making the will) on an<br/>
occasion when he is in good health, free from<br/>
unfavorable influence, and preferably in the<br/>
attorney's office. The paper should then be<br/>
carefully preserved in a safe-deposit box, or<br/>
in some other place secure from meddling.<br/>
No one who is to receive anything under the<br/>
will should be present when the instructions<br/>
are given, or when the will is signed. The<br/>
presence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>principal beneficiary at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">execution </span>of the will has been the frequent cause<br/>
of contests. The disappointed draw the inference of undue influence, and if to the presence<br/>
of the beneficiary is added a weak and dependent condition of mind and body in the<br/>
person making the will, a contest may ensue.<br/>
A will prepared by an attorney under instructions received direct from the client, in the absence of outsiders and executed in good health,<br/>
offers great resistance to attack; in at least nine<br/>
cases out of ten, it will prevail after death.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty in drawing wills arises not<br/>
from the amount involved but from the provisions which are to be inserted in the testament.<br/>
It is often a difficult matter to draw a <span style="color: #0000FF;">will<br/>
