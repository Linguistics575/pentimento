<span>A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
an educational system, who lazily compiled<br/>
lists of inaccurate figures, drew pitiful salaries,<br/>
and published dull reports that had no particular meaning. In these same <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflices </span>now, or<br/>
bigger and better <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>, you find a <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff </span>of<br/>
men and women at work who are ready to<br/>
show you hundreds of photographs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ramshackle </span>old schoolhouse that <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>bun<br/>
abandoned and of handsome new ones that<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">have </span>been built to <span style="color: #0000FF;">take </span>their places. They<br/>
will show you photographs of children <span style="color: #ff0000;">plantirg<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ilowcrs </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">school-yards</span>, and of other chil<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>dren doing manual <span style="color: #0000FF;">training </span>work in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolroom</span>. They will take from their <span style="color: #0000FF;">desks </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wellkept</span>, neat, and accurate reports which show<br/>
an enormous increase of expenditure and<br/>
great pride in the schools. They will tell you<br/>
of traveling libraries; they will explain how<br/>
pictures have been put up in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolhouse</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the colleges you find that the men who<br/>
teach spent their last vacations either abroad,<br/>
or at some university centre in the United<br/>
States. They no longer speak a local language.<br/>
They still tell, of course, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient </span>equipment; but, if you will inquire, you will find that<br/>
the states have enormously increased their<br/>
appropriations for the state schools; that the<br/>
schools which are maintained by private subscription or by religious sects have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">successful </span>in increasing their endowments; and,<br/>
best of all, you will find that the schools now<br/>
have local support-support by <span style="color: #0000FF;">ever-increasing<br/>

local taxation. And no school or other institution can permanently exist on any basis but<br/>
the basis of local support.<br/>
<br/>
You will find everywhere the spirit of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation</span>. There was a time when every institution<br/>
was conducted only with reference to itself.<br/>
Now <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is conducted with reference to all the<br/>
others, and with reference to the secondary<br/>
schools. The annual conferences for education<br/>
in the South have been both cause and effect<br/>
of this change. An enthusiasm for <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation<br/>
