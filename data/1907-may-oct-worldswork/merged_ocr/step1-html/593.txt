<br/>
</span>had shipped its products over all three of them,<br/>
paying one road six cents, another six and <span style="color: #0000FF;">one<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quarter </span>cents (because of some greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">advantages </span>at the point of delivery), and paying the<br/>
Alton road six cents. The other roads had<br/>
published the six-cent and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">six-and-one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quarter-cent </span>rates and filed them with the Interstate Commerce Commission, as required by<br/>
the law. The Alton road had openly quoted<br/>
to the Oil Company its six-cent rate, but it had<br/>
failed technically to publish this rate and to<br/>
file it with the Commission-a purely technical<br/>
omission of duty by the railroad, for there was<br/>
no concealment of the rate and no discrimination. The last rate on these products properly<br/>
published and filed by the Alton road was an<br/>
old "class" rate of eighteen cents, which was<br/>
never used. There was no dispute of these<br/>
facts; and the crime, if crime was committed,<br/>
was (as every layman would suppose) a crime<br/>
of the Alton road.<br/>
<br/>
But Judge Landis refused to admit these<br/>
facts in the evidence. He held the testimony<br/>
rigidly to the facts that the last rate filed by<br/>
the Alton road was eighteen cents and that the<br/>
Oil Company had paid only six cents. He<br/>
declared that the presumption is "that the<br/>
honest man who tenders a commodity will not<br/>
be <span style="color: #ff0000;">fraudently </span>misled by the railroad company<br/>
into allowing it to haul his property for less than<br/>
the law authorizes it to collect." In a word,<br/>
the shipper must ascertain whether the railroad<br/>
has complied with the law before he accepts<br/>
a rate quoted to him-must make sure that the<br/>
railroad is charging him enough. Judge Lan..<br/>
dis ruled that the Oil Company had not used<br/>
"due diligence" to determine whether the<br/>
railroad was disobeying the law.<br/>
<br/>
The Standard Oil Company of Indiana was<br/>
therefore found guilty of shipping 1,462 carloads of oil at an unlawful rate; the Judge<br/>
imposed the maximum fine of $ 20,000 a carload, which is forty-four times as much as the<br/>
oil was worth.<br/>
<br/>
The defendant was the Standard Oil Company of Indiana, a corporation of $ 1,000,000<br/>
capital. Judge Landis held an inquiry to<br/>
ascertain that much (or most) of this stock is<br/>
held by the Standard Oil Company of New<br/>
Jersey, a corporation with a capital of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">100,000,000</span>. When this was ascertained,<br/>
he imposed the colossal fine, regarding the New<br/>
Jersey corporation, which had not been <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicted </span>in his court, as the real defendant.<br/>
<br/>
But the fine cannot by process of law be<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">MUBBIN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">G </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span>CORPORATIONS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9391<br/>
<br/>
</span>collected from the New Jersey corporation.<br/>
Most competent lawyers know, too, that so<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>a fine against the Indiana corporation is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">confiscatory</span>, and therefore in violation of the<br/>
United States Constitution; and it is practically<br/>
certain that the Supreme Court will so decide.<br/>
This conviction, secured by the Judge's<br/>
extraordinary rulings, and this fine, which it<br/>
is practically certain cannot be collected, therefore work great harm in arousing the suspicion<br/>
and the fear that a United States judge is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>playing to the galleries." The probable truth<br/>
is that Judge Landis is a "hopelessly academic "<br/>
judge-that is to say, in plain English, lacks<br/>
common sense-and that he pursued a purely<br/>
technical course of reasoning to an absurdity.<br/>
But the impression made on the public mind<br/>
is that he made these extraordinary rulings and<br/>
imposed this extraordinary fine (larger than<br/>
any court ever imposed in any case in any<br/>
country) because, consciously or unconsciously,<br/>
he felt that, having at last convicted the <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">criminal </span>of all the trusts, he would make the<br/>
punishment fit the public clamor.<br/>
<br/>
But whatever be the "psychological" <span style="color: #0000FF;">explanation </span>of Judge Landis's reasoning and action,<br/>
the whole movement to bring great corporate<br/>
offenders to justice has been harmed; for such<br/>
sensational action by a court smacks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">vindictiveness</span>. Public opinion may become vindictive, as it often does. Even prosecuting<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhcers </span>may, under provocation, become vindictive, as, no doubt, they do. The press and<br/>
the public mood become sensational in their<br/>
judgments. Sensational suits are brought in<br/>
the courts. But when a United States court<br/>
becomes sensational and even provokes the<br/>
suspicion of showing <span style="color: #0000FF;">vindictiveness-then </span>(so<br/>
far as that court and that judge are concerned)<br/>
we have forsaken the calm method of exact<br/>
justice and taken up the method of judgment<br/>
by a public <span style="color: #0000FF;">mood-mob </span>judgment, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>word.<br/>
It is better that the worst criminal should<br/>
escape than that vindictiveness or attention<br/>
to public clamor (whether conscious or <span style="color: #0000FF;">unconscious</span>) should affect the administration of<br/>
justice. Courts then become the instruments<br/>
of mob-opinion. This is a case of mobbing<br/>
a corporation. The fact that it is the most<br/>
unpopular of the great corporations makes the<br/>
matter worse rather than better.<br/>
<br/>
The Standard Oil Company issued a pamphlet to its stockholders and employees (and<br/>
to the public) in explanation of this trial. The<br/>
body of this explanation was well conceived,<br/>
