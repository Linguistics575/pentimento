</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>-its clients. I have in mind a banking house<br/>
that, at one time in recent years, did a very<br/>
large business for the so-called Harriman<br/>
clique. On the day that the Union <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacific<br/>
</span>dividend was increased to <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per cent., the<br/>
head of this house turned back to his people.<br/>
In the afternoon, he sent out to every customer<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>a letter full of the most solemn warning not to<br/>
follow the speculation in the stocks of the<br/>
Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific. He<br/>
advised, without qualification, to sell all stocks,<br/>
of all sorts, and either to hold the proceeds in<br/>
cash or to invest in only the best kinds of bonds.<br/>
<br/>
"It is my opinion," he wrote, "that it will<br/>
be many months, and it may be some years,<br/>
before the public will be justified in trading<br/>
in this market with any confidence that they are<br/>
not mere tools for the use of the great<br/>
speculators."<br/>
<br/>
That letter, followed as it was by many<br/>
others of a similar tone, practically destroyed<br/>
the commission business of that house. The<br/>
biggest individual account was withdrawn<br/>
almost immediately, and transferred to a house<br/>
that is still advising its clients to buy Union<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacific </span>and Southern Pacific at all times.<br/>
The old clients of the house did as they were<br/>
advised, and their trade in stocks since August<br/>
last has been very small indeed. The banker<br/>
who wrote the letter knew that his commission<br/>
business would be cut down to a minimum<br/>
because his clients are not of the class that<br/>
trades heavily on what is called the "short<br/>
side," hoping for a decline. He did it with<br/>
his eyes open, holding that as an honorable<br/>
banker worthy of the name, the interests of<br/>
his customers came first and his own interests<br/>
second.<br/>
<br/>
This is not an isolated case, by any means.<br/>
In some measure, every old-line banking<br/>
house in Wall Street is trying to do the same<br/>
thing, though it does not always succeed.<br/>
Individuals have added their assistance to the<br/>
warning movement. Mr. Stuyvesant Fish<br/>
and Mr. Jacob Schiff are two men whose<br/>
voices have been raised to warn the investment<br/>
public not to be too sanguine. The warning<br/>
came at the very moment that it was most<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">needed-at </span>the moment when the directors<br/>
of the Union Pacific, of the Baltimore & Ohio,<br/>
of the Atchison, of the Pennsylvania, of the<br/>
Southern Pacific, and of the New York Central<br/>
had hung out new lures in the shape of increased dividends. The slaughter that <span style="color: #0000FF;">followed </span>is a matter of history; but it would<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">906 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>undoubtedly have been a hundred times worse<br/>
had not the old-line Wall Street houses, a few<br/>
daring individuals, and two or three unharnessed newspapers and periodicals been shouting their warnings from the house-tops for<br/>
two full months.<br/>
<br/>
Before passing to another phase of this<br/>
subject of public safety and the returning safeguards, a word must be said about another<br/>
kind of alleged "banking house." There are<br/>
three hundred firms below Park Row, New<br/>
York, who call themselves by this honored<br/>
name, then drag that name through the slime<br/>
of dishonesty, deceit, and fraud. They do<br/>
not owe allegiance to any of the great financiers.<br/>
They are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">merest </span>prostitutes of finance.<br/>
These firms are formed hurriedly, in most<br/>
cases, to sell to the hungry public little blocks<br/>
of mining stock, oil stock, cheap and miserable<br/>
industrial stocks, stocks that represent a <span style="color: #0000FF;">promoter</span>'s hopes for the future of some new <span style="color: #0000FF;">invention-anything </span>at all, <span style="color: #0000FF;">intact</span>, that the poor<br/>
public might be induced to buy. They have<br/>
no standing. Neither Dun nor Bradstreet<br/>
knows them. If they are members in any<br/>
exchange at all it is one of the four or <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">self..<br/>
</span>organized, lawless, loose, and unholy exchanges<br/>
that exist merely to give a weak semblance of<br/>
respectability to just such firms as these by<br/>
allowing them to call themselves members<br/>
of an "<span style="color: #0000FF;">exchange</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>The advertisements of these firms are accepted by three of the great daily newspapers<br/>
of New York, and paraded in the Sunday<br/>
editions without shame. They do most of<br/>
their advertising, however, outside New York,<br/>
where the public might be supposed to be<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">easier </span>picking." Their cards appear in nine<br/>
out of ten of the Wall Street papers, being<br/>
refused only by a little handful of clean men<br/>
in that delectable branch of the journalistic<br/>
profession. Four of their cards appeared<br/>
a few weeks ago in a journal devoted to women,<br/>
with the alluring statement in one form or<br/>
another that "Special facilities are afforded<br/>
to ladies desiring to invest." Two of these<br/>
firms offered to the widow and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spinster </span>a<br/>
glorious opportunity to sink their savings or<br/>
their life-insurance funds in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>cobalt mine<br/>
that has not yet disclosed a single ounce of<br/>
silver or of cobalt.<br/>
<br/>
These "bankers" have no right to live. In<br/>
order to safeguard oneself against them, it is<br/>
now necessary to make a rule never, under any<br/>
circumstances whatever, to have one single<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
