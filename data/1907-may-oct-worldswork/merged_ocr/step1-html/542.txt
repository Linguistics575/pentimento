<br/>
</span>One day, while roaming sorrowfully in the<br/>
desolate wilderness of low, flat houses, Taki<br/>
met his old Colonel, who received him<br/>
kindly and gave him one yen. With this the<br/>
veteran purchased a stock of salt mackerel,<br/>
dried cuttle, salmon trout and codfish on skewers<br/>
and started out as an itinerant merchant in the<br/>
country. He found the farmers and villagers<br/>
so poor that they could not afford to pay <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">okyo<br/>
</span>prices for his delicacies and he was compelled<br/>
to sell at a loss. He trudged along manfully,<br/>
however, hoping that luck would change. He<br/>
washed his coarse blue kimono in the wayside streams. He was still a self-respecting<br/>
Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
On the road and in the hamlets of Chichibu<br/>
and Omiya he met homeless veterans and<br/>
beggars of all sorts. It seemed to him that<br/>
Japan had become the saddest country on<br/>
earth. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ikao </span>he sold the last of his stock<br/>
and found that he had but ten cents left. He<br/>
determined to return to Tokyo. There was a<br/>
stroke of good luck on the way. Ten miles<br/>
from the city a farmer hired him to draw a load<br/>
of vegetables to the market. The clumsy cart<br/>
carried fully 700 pounds, but Taki tugged it to<br/>
its destination and received eight cents for his<br/>
labor. This was a large sum, as eight cents in<br/>
the market had a buying power of 13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">cucumbers<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or 20 egg-plants. It meant a temporary supply<br/>
of food.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">AS </span>A COLLECTOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>GARBAGE<br/>
<br/>
Back in Tokyo, Taki gave a grafting employment agency his last sen and secured employment in a rice shop which sold the leavings of<br/>
large restaurants and public institutions. His<br/>
wages were five cents a day and all the spoiled<br/>
rice he could eat. It was a repulsive business.<br/>
The dilapidated shop boasted a little yard and<br/>
in this were stretched old mats upon which the<br/>
rice was dried. Inside, bottles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tasks</span>, broken<br/>
boxes, tubs, and kettles were filled with refuse<br/>
rice. Everything was very dirty, and yet to the<br/>
neighborhood it was a mainstay for food cheap<br/>
enough to be within reach. Twice a <span style="color: #0000FF;">day </span>Taki<br/>
and the other assistants made a round of the<br/>
restaurants and public institutions, such as the<br/>
hospitals and the Military College, and bought<br/>
the rice and the bits of food that had been left<br/>
over. They also picked bits of fish and decayed<br/>
fruit from the garbage receptacles. A tub of<br/>
rice weighing 125 pounds could be bought in<br/>
this way for 50 cents. It was retailed to the<br/>
poor at the shop for one cent a pound. The<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">JAPAN</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'S </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WAR </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TAX </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AND </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">POVERTY<br/>
<br/>
</span>rice, the fragments of bread and fish, the spoiled<br/>
fruit, the stale pickles and the like were carefully sorted.<br/>
<br/>
A Japanese is dirty only when he cannot help<br/>
himself, and Taki shuddered at the filth of this<br/>
garbage gathered like precious metal and<br/>
weighed out to the last ounce by the stewards of<br/>
the restaurants and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhcials </span>of the public<br/>
buildings. Poverty made him and his fellows<br/>
live in dirt and eat dirt; it was not to be<br/>
escaped. He learned to speak the slang of the<br/>
second-hand food dealers. Rice scorched in<br/>
the kettle was termed "tiger's skin," while<br/>
rice washed out in cleaning was known as<br/>
"slop"; fragments of bread he called "stove"<br/>
in jocular allusion to the warmth they did not<br/>
give the stomach; and bits of vegetables were<br/>
sold as "stumps." Taki soon became a <span style="color: #0000FF;">con</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">noisseur </span>in the various forms of edible swill.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there were doleful days occasion,<br/>
ally when the patrons of the cafes, and the<br/>
students in the colleges, and the hospital<br/>
patients cleaned up their plates and there<br/>
was little refuse to gather. On such days the<br/>
throng at the shop which awaited the return of<br/>
the laden carts made a lugubrious assemblage.<br/>
When there was not enough to go around, the<br/>
repulsive mess was divided up so as to enable<br/>
each patron to buy a fractional meal.<br/>
<br/>
Taki worked here for several months, but all<br/>
the time the combination to control the secondhand food supply was being perfected, and when<br/>
it finally took over the various collecting carts<br/>
and routes the veteran found that he was not<br/>
wanted, owing to new economies in gathering<br/>
the garbage in central stations.<br/>
<br/>
WORKING AS A DAY LABORER<br/>
<br/>
Taki began once more a weary round of<br/>
labor seeking. He even joined the homeless<br/>
coolies who make their headquarters on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Reiganjima</span>, an island in Tokyo, formed by the River<br/>
Sumida. Here the poorest class of coolies<br/>
resort, bearing a pad on their shoulders and<br/>
wearing a single coarse garment. Not having<br/>
employment by the day, they seek piece-work<br/>
and odd jobs. <span style="color: #ff0000;">They </span>haunt the lumber yards<br/>
and the vegetable markets. They pull heavy<br/>
carts great distances for a cent and a half.<br/>
After a day of killing toil scattered over half<br/>
the sections of the city, they regard a total <span style="color: #0000FF;">earning </span>of ten cents as a great harvest. Then they<br/>
begin to think of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sake </span>shops and a hilarious<br/>
evening. A dish of cooked food can be had for<br/>
a half-cent and this washed down with <span style="color: #0000FF;">sake<br/>
<br/>
