<br/>
THE OLDEST INDUSTRY OF MANKIND<br/>

this fur-hunting and fur-trading. The<br/>
cave man, who slew a beast with a<br/>
stone spear that he might take the pelt for<br/>
his own covering, was the world's first manufacturer. And it is an industry on which no<br/>
trust, no monopoly, can lay a <span style="color: #0000FF;">stifling </span>hand.<br/>
The wayside vagabond, wandering in the<br/>
wood with his gun, could upset the biggest<br/>
trust by throwing his furs on the market at an<br/>
independent price. And it is an industry that<br/>
has led to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pathfinding </span>of half the world.<br/>
Not glory in the abstract, but the little beaver,<br/>
led discoverers from the St. Lawrence to the<br/>
Mississippi and from the Mississippi to the<br/>
Rockies. Likewise it was the little sable that<br/>
led the Cossacks across what is now Russia,<br/>
from the Ural Mountains to Kamchatka; and<br/>
it was the big sea otter that led Russians,<br/>
Americans, Spaniards, and Englishmen around<br/>
the world in crazy boats to the exploration of<br/>
Western America, from Alaska to California.<br/>
Just when these fur traders began to combine into the great companies I do not know.<br/>
The Skinners Company of London dates from<br/>
the 1300's. Russian traders had begun to<br/>
hold their great fairs by the 1400's; and from<br/>
the time Canada was discovered in 1535, its<br/>
history was a continuous succession of different French fur companies to <span style="color: #ff0000;">17 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">59</span>. Danes<br/>
had their Copenhagen furriers hunting Greenland and Spitzbergen before Henry Hudson<br/>
had found the harbor of New York. The<br/>
Dutch West India Company's men sought furs<br/>
almost as diligently as spices and broke the<br/>
heads of rivals over a pelt as readily as Spaniards<br/>
spit an enemy for a doubloon. The great<br/>
Hudson's Bay Company of the Canadian<br/>
Northwest came into existence in 1670.<br/>
Those companies whose operations were<br/>
really the pioneer history of Western America<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-the </span>Northwest Company of Montreal, the<br/>
Russian-American Company of the Pacific<br/>
Coast otter hunters, Astor's three companies<br/>
<br/>
(the Mackinaw, the Pacific, the American, ranging the Western States), and the two great companies operating from St. Louis, the Rocky<br/>
Mountain and Missouri-nearly all came into<br/>
existence just before the 1800's and had run<br/>
their course before 1840.<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean that the furs of America<br/>
are exhausted. On the contrary, the fur trade<br/>
of America is greater to-day than ever before<br/>
in its history. The Hudson's Bay Company<br/>
now sells more furs than in the days when it<br/>
held monopoly over all Canada except New<br/>
France, and this in spite of the fact that it is<br/>
now opposed by a French company as powerful as itself, which does as big a volume of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">business-mot </span>to mention hosts of lesser companies that support free traders on the<br/>
field and buy by mail. It will astonish most<br/>
readers to be told that, on the American side<br/>
of the line, the volume of the fur trade is the<br/>
largest ever known in the United <span style="color: #ff0000;">Statesgreater </span>than in the days when the buffalo and<br/>
beaver had the whole continent as a stampingground. Buffalo as a fur yielder has been<br/>
exterminated. Beaver in the most of the<br/>
states is practically extinct. Sea otter, from<br/>
yielding 100,000 pelts a year now give at the<br/>
most only 400, at the least 200 for the trade;<br/>
and the fur seal is on the way to extermination,<br/>
falling from 100,000 a year to 10,000 and<br/>
14,000. But other furs have taken their place.<br/>
<br/>
"What fur would you say yields the biggest<br/>
crop in America?" I asked one of the famous<br/>
buyers. "Mink or beaver?"<br/>
<br/>
"Neither," he answered. "It will seem<br/>
absurd; but there is more money going to<br/>
trappers to-day for skunk and muskrat and fox<br/>
than was ever made out of beaver and sea otter<br/>
and seal and the rare furs. Why, the swamps<br/>
of New Jersey and Delaware alone yield millions of muskrats a year."<br/>
<br/>
"How many millions?"<br/>
<br/>
"I wouldn't like to say: different for different years; highest when there hasn't been<br/>
