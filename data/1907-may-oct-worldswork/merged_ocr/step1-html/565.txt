<span>A NEGRO COLLEGE TOWN<br/>
<br/>
Green County, in the centre of which the community is located, is one of the most prosperous<br/>
counties in the whole rich farming region of<br/>
southern Ohio, and is noted as a centre of the<br/>
stock-raising industry of the state.<br/>
<br/>
Approaching from the city, there is nothing,<br/>
at a little distance, except the college buildings<br/>
to distinguish Wilberforce from any of the<br/>
other country villages which one meets in this<br/>
part of the country. It is merely a little<br/>
cluster of houses against a background of<br/>
pleasant woods, a little centre of country<br/>
residences with lawns and gardens, and a few<br/>
farmhouses on the outskirts.<br/>
<br/>
But turning from the country road into the<br/>
wide avenue along which the town is arranged,<br/>
you find yourself in the midst of a quaint and<br/>
beautiful little college town, which has some<br/>
of the rustic charm of a country village, with<br/>
something, also, of that <span style="color: #0000FF;">flavor </span>of refinement<br/>
and grace which inevitably comes, with time,<br/>
to every college town, where men are permanently bound together for a high purpose.<br/>
On one side of the long avenue, along which<br/>
the town has arranged itself, are the college<br/>
buildings, and on the other are the homes of<br/>
the teachers and officers of the school. The<br/>
road terminates in a little wood, and rambles<br/>
off into the meadows beyond the town.<br/>
<br/>
A CONTRAST TO MOUND BAYOU<br/>
<br/>
Different in almost every way from the<br/>
sprawling frontier village of Mound Bayou,<br/>
which I have described in a previous article,<br/>
Wilberforce is quite as distinctively a Negro<br/>
community. Mound Bayou, situated in the<br/>
wilderness of the Yazoo Delta of Mississippi,<br/>
is a pioneer town. It exhibits in a picturesque<br/>
and unique way the struggle of the masses of<br/>
the Negro people in the South to get possession of the land and make it their own. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilberforce </span>is older, slower, less enterprising, and<br/>
more beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Mound Bayou has sprung up as the centre<br/>
of an industrial enterprise. Wilberforce has<br/>
grown up about a school and reflects in its<br/>
homes the slow, refining influence of half a<br/>
century of Negro education:<br/>
<br/>
It is only during the last twenty or twentyfive years that the masses of the Negro people<br/>
have begun to seek a solution of their problem<br/>
in industrial progress. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>great passion<br/>
of the Negro race after the war was for education. If the church stands for the first great<br/>
interest in which the Negro, as a race, has<br/>
<br/>
9363<br/>
<br/>
sought salvation, it may be said that the<br/>
schoolhouse represents the second. The College<br/>
of Wilberforce, which is, so far as I know, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>permanent institution of learning founded<br/>
by Negroes in this country, gave at an early<br/>
period a definite expression to that aspiration.<br/>
It came into existence in the midst of the<br/>
commotion of the great Civil War, at a time<br/>
when the masses of the people were still in<br/>
slavery: at a time when everything that concerned the Negro people, their fitness for<br/>
freedom and their capacity for education, was<br/>
looked upon with much more doubt than it<br/>
is to-day. In the half century since that time<br/>
the scattered Negro community in which the<br/>
College began its work, while it has not to any<br/>
great degree increased in size, has grown to<br/>
represent in a very concrete way, in its homes<br/>
and the habits of the people, the spirit and<br/>
influence of the College.<br/>
<br/>
There are a certain number of persons who<br/>
are in the habit of saying that Negro education<br/>
has been a failure, for the reason that it has<br/>
tended rather to increase than to diminish<br/>
the number of Negro criminals. It is my<br/>
experience that whenever a permanent school<br/>
for Negroes has been established, there has<br/>
almost always grown up around it a permanent,<br/>
decent, and orderly Negro community. I do<br/>
not know where one can better study the actual<br/>
effects of education upon the Negro than in<br/>
these communities, where one can see the concrete results of its permanent and lasting<br/>
influence.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>Mound Bayou represents what Negroes<br/>
have accomplished in the direction of industrial<br/>
progress and political self-control, then Wilberforce may be said to represent the slower and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">subtler </span>influence which the patient struggle to<br/>
gain an education has had upon the life and<br/>
character of the race.<br/>
<br/>
Wilberforce is both a college and a town.<br/>
But many persons who know something of<br/>
the College and its history know nothing of<br/>
the community that has grown up around it,<br/>
though the community is older than the College.<br/>
Its history reaches. back into the days before<br/>
the war, when the Northwest Territory, made<br/>
free by the ordinance of 1787, was a refuge for<br/>
Negroes who sought permanent freedom.<br/>
<br/>
HOW THE COMMUNITY STARTED<br/>
<br/>
In its origin, Wilberforce is at once <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>representative and a survivor of a number of<br/>
somewhat similar Negro communities which<br/>
