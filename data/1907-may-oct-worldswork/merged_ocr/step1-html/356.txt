<br/>
After the experiments at Hadleigh, Fort<br/>
Romie, and Fort Amity, no attempt has been<br/>
made in Canada to "colonize," in the common<br/>
acceptance of the term, for two reasons. First,<br/>
the lack of money; though a man may be<br/>
brought to the Canadian Northwest for $ 50,<br/>
at least $ 500 is required to give him a fair<br/>
start as a "homesteader." Second, the great<br/>
majority of colonizing enterprises on a large<br/>
scale have failed hitherto because of the inexperience of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonist</span>. Hence the policy<br/>
of letting the emigrant get his experience as a<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">hired </span>man" in the more thickly populated<br/>
Eastern Provinces. And though the hired<br/>
man's lot has never been regarded as easy, it<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">significant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>no "Army" emigrant has<br/>
asked to be returned to England.<br/>
<br/>
But the movement was essentially to be a<br/>
transplanting to the wide fields, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>the<br/>
present year it has been given the opportunity<br/>
to take full course in that direction. Large<br/>
donations of money are coming to the "Army,"<br/>
and both the Dominion and the Provincial<br/>
Government of Ontario have decided to do<br/>
their part'in the matter of providing the<br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Fort Romie, a committee of<br/>
the chamber of commerce of San Francisco<br/>
cooperated with the "Army" in the purchase<br/>
of the land. In the case of Fort Amity, it had<br/>
to be bought. But, in addition, there were<br/>
many other initial expenses. To start the<br/>
colonist with an honest chance of success, he<br/>
was provided with a twenty-acre holding, a<br/>
team of horses, a cow, seed, implements, etc.,<br/>
for which he gave a chattel mortgage. And<br/>
to build his house, he was loaned $ 300 in cash.<br/>
Only $ 25 of this was to be spent for actual<br/>
labor; each man was expected to build for<br/>
himself, or to realize the advantage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation</span>. For every five colonists ignorant of <span style="color: #0000FF;">farming </span>work-and in the case of Fort Amity they<br/>
had been drawn from the tenements and had<br/>
been carpenters, teamsters, tailors, <span style="color: #0000FF;">canvassers</span>,<br/>
street-railway conductors, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">We-a<br/>
</span>"pace-setter," a man of experience from whom<br/>
the other five might learn, was given a central<br/>
holding. This proved an excellent idea.<br/>
<br/>
The "Army" has practically been given the<br/>
refusal of two great tracts of land in Canada,<br/>
amounting to nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">500,000 </span>acres, at a cost<br/>
of almost nothing. The first proposes the<br/>
settlement by the "Army" of two townships-<br/>
TRANSPLANTING A <span style="color: #0000FF;">CITY</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span>POOR<br/>
<br/>
from 230,000 to 250,000 acres-in the northern<br/>
Ontario clay belt, along the line of the new<br/>
Transcontinental Railway. The clay belt consists of some of the finest agricultural land in<br/>
Canada and enjoys a climate much milder than<br/>
the wheat lands of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.<br/>
The Ontario Government has not as yet given<br/>
out its final statement, but its attitude in the<br/>
matter is sufficiently guaranteed by the large<br/>
grants of money and other assistance which it<br/>
has already made to this unofficial Immigration<br/>
Department. It is understood that the colonization agreement to be entered into between the<br/>
Province and the "Army" is about as follows:<br/>
<br/>
The "Army" will obtain the land at somewhat less than the fifty cents an acre usually<br/>
charged settlers in these districts; and the<br/>
payments will also be extended over a term of<br/>
years, probably ten, without interest. Such a<br/>
price merely covers the necessary township<br/>
surveys. The "Army" agrees to settle <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigrants </span>of the best selected class upon allotments of 160 acres. The Government will<br/>
appoint a number of <span style="color: #ff0000;">expeJenced </span>men to assist<br/>
members of the "Army" staff in locating the<br/>
settlers, building suitable homes, clearing the<br/>
land, and teaching the rudiments of agriculture. The settlement will be gradual; there<br/>
is no idea of bringing in thousands of people<br/>
to live in tents or rough shanties. As a further<br/>
aid to the settlers, there will be an experimental<br/>
farm in Ontario, which will be a sort of agricultural headquarters for settlers.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Wilfrid Laurier's offer in the name of the<br/>
Dominion Government was of 240,000 acres<br/>
in the Northwest Provinces, on condition that<br/>
the British Government should stand behind<br/>
the movement. That condition will probably<br/>
be removed. On the occasion of General<br/>
Booth's visit to Ottawa in March of the present<br/>
year, both Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Earl Grey,<br/>
the Governor-General, foreshadowed in their<br/>
speeches, an "Army" colonization scheme<br/>
upon a gigantic scale with Dominion support.<br/>
<br/>
The movement has already begun to spread<br/>
in other directions. A private land company<br/>
in Rhodesia has offered the "Army" a homestead grant of 1,000,000 acres free. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor </span>of British East Africa has set aside large<br/>
tracts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">agriculturaHand </span>along the line of the<br/>
Mombasa and Victoria-Nyanza Railroad. In<br/>
South Africa and the Transvaal, the "Army"<br/>
is regarded by the Imperialist Progressives<br/>
as the power that may yet reverse the present<br/>
pro-Dutch racial balance.<br/>
