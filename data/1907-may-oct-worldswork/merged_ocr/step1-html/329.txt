<span>A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES<br/>
<br/>
of the community, about 6,000 acres are<br/>
already under cultivation. This land produces annually about 3,000 bales of cotton and<br/>
from one-half to two-thirds of the corn and<br/>
fodder consumed by the community. The<br/>
original site of the town has been extended<br/>
until, including the thirty acres in the original<br/>
plot and the several additions that have been<br/>
made since, it embraces a tract of ninety-six<br/>
acres.<br/>
<br/>
With the influx of population, the value of<br/>
land in the town and the surrounding country<br/>
has greatly increased in value. Property<br/>
inside the town that formerly cost from $ 7<br/>
to $ 9 an acre sells at present, in the form of<br/>
building lots, at prices ranging from one to<br/>
three cents per square foot. This land, which<br/>
was assessed at one time at two dollars an acre,<br/>
has now an assessed valuation of $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3,073. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The business of the town has grown with the<br/>
growing population. There are thirteen stores<br/>
and a number of small shops in the town<br/>
which do an annual business of something like<br/>
$ 600,000. The express business at Mound<br/>
Bayou amounts to $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>per month. The<br/>
railroad station is the tenth in importance<br/>
between Memphis and Vicksburg, according<br/>
to a writer in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Planter</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">Journal</span>, and the<br/>
railroad traffic amounts to $ 40,000 a year.<br/>
<br/>
There are six churches and three schools in<br/>
the town. One of these, the Mound Bayou<br/>
Normal and Industrial Institute, conducted<br/>
by B. F. Owsley, has a building which, with<br/>
the seven acres of land belonging to and adjoining the school, is valued at $ 3,500. This<br/>
school was started by the American Missionary<br/>
Association before the town was incorporated.<br/>
The expenses of maintaining it, about $ 1,500<br/>
a year, are met in part by the society that<br/>
founded it, but in part by a tuition fee of $ 1<br/>
a month from its pupils. A second school,<br/>
established and maintained by what are known<br/>
familiarly as the "Sister Workers of the Colored Baptist Church of Bolivar County," has<br/>
a large two-story building for <span style="color: #0000FF;">recitations</span>, and<br/>
plans are now being made for the building of<br/>
a dormitory to provide accommodations for<br/>
pupils who come in from the surrounding<br/>
farms to get the advantages of better schools<br/>
than the county can provide.<br/>
<br/>
The town is gradually increasing its facilities<br/>
for doing business and is acquiring all the<br/>
machinery of a highly organized community.<br/>
Mound Bayou has a bank, three cotton gins,<br/>
a telephone exchange, a weekly newspaper,<br/>
<br/>
9127<br/>
<br/>
and is preparing to issue bonds for the construction of waterworks and the erection of a<br/>
system of electric lighting. It is an indication<br/>
of the progress of the town that a well-kept<br/>
cemetery-an institution too often neglected<br/>
by Negroes-has been established on one side<br/>
of the town, and a public park of five acres<br/>
has been laid out on the other. Mound Bayou,<br/>
though an exclusively Negro town, keeps up its<br/>
connection with and interest in the outside<br/>
world. The post-office business amounts to<br/>
between $ 400 and $ 500 a quarter. Fifty<br/>
Memphis papers are sold every day in the<br/>
town and there are a number of subscribers<br/>
to the magazines of general information.<br/>
<br/>
The business interests of Mound Bayou<br/>
town and community centre in the Bank of<br/>
Mound Bayou, organized March 8, 1904, with<br/>
a capital stock of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000</span>. The earnings of<br/>
the bank during the first eight months of its<br/>
existence amounted to <span style="color: #0000FF;">17 </span>per cent. In 1906,<br/>
it paid a dividend of 16 per cent. and set aside<br/>
a considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum </span>as a surplus. The following statement indicates the condition of the<br/>
bank on Feb. 12, 1907:<br/>

As practically all of the business of the colony<br/>
centres in the bank, it is natural that nearly all<br/>
the prominent business men of the town should<br/>
be represented on the board of directors.<br/>
Charles Banks, the founder and cashier of the<br/>
bank, was a successful <span style="color: #0000FF;">business </span>man at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Clarks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>dale before he came, in 1903, to Mound Bayou.<br/>
He became interested at that time in the success of the enterprise, sold out his business<br/>
interests at Clarksdale, and cast in his fortunes<br/>
with the colony. He is the youngest and most<br/>
aggressive business man in the town. John<br/>
Francis, the president of the bank, came to<br/>
the settlement in an early day from New<br/>
<br/>
