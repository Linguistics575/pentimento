<span>9372 THE MONGOLIAN AS A WORKINGMAN<br/>
<br/>
No such thing is likely to happe" in this<br/>
case, for the little shop with the thrilling pricelist appeals to a permanent instinct in a class<br/>
of cultured purchasers that is steadily growing<br/>
more numerous. People who can afford them<br/>
will always pay high for useful things made<br/>
by hand-and for three reasons: their beauty,<br/>
their individuality, and their associations.<br/>
There is a certain dryness, a certain stiffness,<br/>
a certain insipidity and shoddiness about most<br/>
machine-made objects. This comes partly<br/>
through bad designing, but partly, also, from<br/>
the inability of a machine to perform its function with the freedom and the brilliant dexterity of a human hand controlled by a mind<br/>
filled with enthusiasm and kindled by artistic<br/>
inspiration. It is no use to say that the machine<br/>
might do as well; the fact is that it doesn't, as<br/>
a rule; the results prove it. Then, as regards<br/>
individuality, hosts of people resent the idea<br/>
of their treasures being possessed in uncounted<br/>
replicas by others. They want an "original,"<br/>
a rarity.<br/>
<br/>
But the final consideration cuts still deeper<br/>
into human nature. We have all of us a<br/>
feeling that an art-product expresses the artist<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-his </span>ideas, his taste, his skill, his patience, his<br/>
loving and devoted industry. We admire him<br/>
<br/>
because of what he has made, we admire what<br/>
he has made because of himself. The lifeless<br/>
object brings us into a real acquaintance with<br/>
the living man. His hands fashioned it, his<br/>
heart conceived it, his joy and ardor watched<br/>
its growth, his pride and contentment saw it<br/>
completed. With machine-made things we<br/>
lose all that. Men made them, in a sense, but<br/>
no one man made the whole of any one of them.<br/>
Smith applied machine number one, Fogarty<br/>
machine number two, Jones machine number<br/>
three, Hogan machine number four, and so on<br/>
and on till the finished thing emerged. A<br/>
whole crowd of workmen had their turn at it,<br/>
each incapable of more than a fraction of its<br/>
making, each working without cheerfulness,<br/>
each ready to cut and run at the sound of the<br/>
factory whistle. If machine-made things suggest anything human, they suggest ignorance,<br/>
boredom, and a profound distaste for exertion.<br/>
This necklace, for <span style="color: #ff0000;">instancc-twentrtwo </span>unwilling workmen have wished it was in Ballyhack!<br/>
<br/>
And so I predict without misgivings that,<br/>
as long as people care for beauty, for rarity,<br/>
and for the concrete testimony of artistic zeal<br/>
in the artisan, they will continue to spend<br/>
money freely in the little shop I have told<br/>
you of.<br/>

THE MONGOLIAN AS A WORKINGMAN<br/>
<br/>
A PACIFIC COAST EXPERIENCE WITH THE ORIENTAL PROBLEM<br/>
<br/>
BY<br/>
<br/>
DR. WOODS HUTCHINSON<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HAVING </span>lived along the Pacific Coast<br/>
from Vancouver Island to Los <span style="color: #0000FF;">Angeles </span>for nearly seven <span style="color: #0000FF;">years</span>, I have had time enough<br/>
to observe the situation without remaining in<br/>
any one place long enough to absorb local<br/>
prejudices. Being neither a day-laborer nor an<br/>
employer of labor, my point of view has not<br/>
been obscured by personal interest.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, no class on the Pacific Coast<br/>
desires an unlimited, or even a very large,<br/>
immigration of Mongolians, whether coolies or<br/>
merchants, Chinese, Japanese, or Koreans.<br/>
The people want <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-keep </span>this Coast a white<br/>
man's country. Many of us are keenly alive<br/>
to the complications arising from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">permanent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">presence </span>of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">inferior </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">race </span>with which it is<br/>
<br/>
not suitable to intermarry. Yet in these seven<br/>
years I have found the consensus of intelligent<br/>
opinion in the community-farmers, merchants,<br/>
professional men, lumbermen, housewives, in<br/>
fact all grades and conditions of people except<br/>
the labor unions, the "hoodlums," and the<br/>
politicians and editors who truckle to such<br/>
classes-strongly in favor of a limited Mongolian immigration.<br/>
<br/>
They believe that the Chinese and the Jap-s<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">anese-up </span>to, say, a quarter or half a <span style="color: #0000FF;">million-would </span>be of enormous commercial value to the<br/>
Coast and of little or no social or moral disadvantage. They do not say much about it in<br/>
public, for intelligent opinion goes about in fear<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">noisier </span>and more prejudiced <span style="color: #ff0000;">expressions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
