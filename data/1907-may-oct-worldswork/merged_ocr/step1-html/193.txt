<span>THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
bought the site of an old foundry on the<br/>
Pacolet River and, on February 16, 1880,<br/>
wrote: "We will break dirt to-day." Now<br/>
there are more cotton-mill spindles turning<br/>
in Spartanburg County than in any place of<br/>
similar size in this country.<br/>
<br/>
The second mill in that community was<br/>
organized under even harder conditions. Captain John H. Montgomery came back from<br/>
the war to his farm, <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-one </span>miles south<br/>
of Spartanburg, as his son described it, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>broke."<br/>
After several years' work as farmer and merchant, Captain Montgomery bought a site for<br/>
a mill a little further down the Pacolet River.<br/>
People were even less inclined to believe in his<br/>
venture than in that of Mr. Converse. He<br/>
knew nothing about cotton mills, they said.<br/>
Nevertheless, he persevered. He finally sold<br/>
about half of his stock in the neighborhood,<br/>
and most of the rest to fertilizer manufacturers<br/>
in Baltimore. By 1882 the Pacolet Mill, as<br/>
he named it, was in operation. For fifteen years<br/>
its average <span style="color: #0000FF;">profits </span>were 25 per cent. a year on<br/>
its capitalization. It was so profitable that<br/>
two more mills, Pacolet No. 2 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">No</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span>, were<br/>
built near by. The same thing had happened<br/>
to Mr. Converse's mill and, twenty years after<br/>
it was built, there were three.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of these mills was inside the city<br/>
limits of Spartanburg, but the money they had<br/>
set in circulation had helped the town. It had<br/>
grown to 5,000 inhabitants. The stores ceased<br/>
to have front porches and the loafers had <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared </span>with them. People began to pay<br/>
cash for what they bought. Men began to see<br/>
the possibilities of the future. Half a dozen<br/>
influential citizens got together in the office of<br/>
the First National Bank and decided that the<br/>
town needed a mill within its borders. That<br/>
meant that steam instead of water power<br/>
would have to be used. Many feared this<br/>
could not be successful, and to raise the money<br/>
the stock had to be sold on the installment<br/>
plan. The machinery of the old Ocean Mill<br/>
at Newburyport, Mass., was shipped down<br/>
and the Spartan Mill was started. That<br/>
machinery has long since been thrown on the<br/>
scrap heap but the Spartan Mill, many times<br/>
larger than it was, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is'now </span>paying a <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>per cent.<br/>
dividend on a million-dollar capitalization.<br/>
<br/>
Mills rose on all sides of the town. One<br/>
example is enough. Two or three miles from<br/>
the city limits is the Saxon Mill. The first<br/>
investment ever made by the president, Mr.<br/>
John A. Law, was for some of the installment<br/>
<br/>
8991<br/>
<br/>
shares of the old Spartan Mill. There are<br/>
now in Spartanburg county 37 mills with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">671,941 </span>spindles and more than 19,000 looms.<br/>
<br/>
THE PROSPERITY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>A FACTORY TOWN<br/>
<br/>
That is how the smokestacks <span style="color: #0000FF;">came </span>to<br/>
Spartanburg. What they have done for Spartanburg is more remarkable. There are about<br/>
50,000 bales of cotton grown in Spartanburg<br/>
County. This used to be bought for mills in<br/>
England and other parts of the United States<br/>
and shipped away. With cotton selling at<br/>
ten cents a pound, the county would get<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500,000 </span>for its 50,000 bales. Now the mills<br/>
buy this cotton and manufacture it into cloth,<br/>
which is worth on an average about 25 cents a<br/>
pound. When shipped away from Spartanburg in this form, the county gets $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">7,2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000<br/>
</span>for that same 50,000 bales of cotton. But the<br/>
mills manufacture about 200,000 bales of<br/>
cotton grown outside the county, and that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">200,000 </span>bales increases in value about<br/>
$ 19,000,000 from the time it comes into the<br/>
county until it is shipped away again. The<br/>
mills have made a direct increase in the county's<br/>
yearly income of about $ 23,750,000. The<br/>
farmers have been benefited by this<br/>
more than any <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>class. They.used to<br/>
sell cotton to the local merchants under the<br/>
ruinous credit system; now a bale of cotton is<br/>
seldom seen in Spartanburg. There is a mill<br/>
on every road leading into town and the mills<br/>
pay cash. Instead of paying interest to a<br/>
merchant for credit, the farmer puts his money<br/>
into the bank and draws interest himself. And<br/>
he gets more for his cotton, also, since the mills<br/>
pay a little higher than the market price for<br/>
local cotton because they do not have to pay<br/>
freight on it. Before. the mills came, the<br/>
farmers had practically no market for any<br/>
thing but cotton. The mill villages and the<br/>
town now need more food than the local<br/>
farmers can supply, so they can sell their food<br/>
products up to prices elsewhere, plus the<br/>
freight to Spartanburg. I heard a housekeeper complaining that "<span style="color: #ff0000;">frying-size </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>chickens<br/>
used to cost only ten or twelve cents apiece,<br/>
while now they cost that much a pound.<br/>
The sheriff used to be busy foreclosing <span style="color: #0000FF;">mortgages</span>. Now the farmers have about $ 8,000,000<br/>
deposited in the banks in Spartanburg and there<br/>
are four farmers' banks in other parts of the<br/>
county. The mills are not wholly responsible<br/>
for this but they, more than any other contributing cause, helped the farmer from poverty<br/>
