<span>A SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE<br/>

and the dock region, is one of the most<br/>
<br/>
dismal labyrinths of mean streets to be<br/>
seen in the whole of the metropolis. Nearing<br/>
Tidal Basin, however, forests of masts begin<br/>
to rise above the roofs, and here and there is<br/>
a practical reminder that this is the haunt of<br/>
sailors. Here is located the London School of<br/>
Tropical Medicine.<br/>
<br/>
This medical college is attached to a branch<br/>
hospital belonging to the Seamen's Hospital<br/>
Society, which had its first home on board the<br/>
old <span style="color: #0000FF;">5o-ton </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Grampus </span>in the Thames. Seamen<br/>
in general, and Lascars, Negroes, and Chinese<br/>
in particular, object to being taken, when ill,<br/>
far from their own ship; and in the cheerful hospital wards are seamen of many nations.<br/>
Among the strange complaints treated in these<br/>
wards during the last ten years are plague,<br/>
leprosy, malaria, beri-beri, trypanosomiasis,<br/>
numerous cases of guinea-worm, etc., the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unchecked </span>spread of any one of which in the port<br/>
of London would have involved a serious<br/>
money loss, to say nothing of the loss of life.<br/>
During its eighty-five years' work, the Society<br/>
can show a wonderful record of beneficent<br/>
work on behalf of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Jack Tars" from all over<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
All the students are physicians, <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>women<br/>
wishing to gain special knowledge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">diseases </span>with which they will have to deal in the<br/>
tropical countries to which they expect to go.<br/>
The popularity of the school is proved by the<br/>
fact that the accommodation has twice been<br/>
increased during the seven years that have<br/>
elapsed since it was opened. Over 660 students<br/>
have been enrolled, many of whose names are<br/>
well known for subsequent good work in different quarters of the globe. Of these, 303 were<br/>
in the service of the British tropical colonies<br/>
and other British service, 35 in that of foreign<br/>
governments, 80 were medical missionaries,<br/>
while the remainder were employed by private<br/>
firms, or engaged in practice on their own<br/>
account, mainly in the tropics. The course<br/>
<br/>
BETWEEN Liverpool Street, London,<br/>
<br/>
of study, originally fixed at three months, has<br/>
been extended to four, and a more prolonged<br/>
course may be arranged shortly.<br/>
<br/>
It is hardly necessary to remark that the<br/>
lecturers are specialists in their various departments. All branches of science bearing on<br/>
tropical diseases are dealt with and demonstrations are given in the museum and <span style="color: #0000FF;">postmortem </span>room as opportunity occurs. The<br/>
teaching staff includes Sir Patrick Manson,<br/>
well known for his work in connection with the<br/>
mosquito-malaria theory. Sir Francis Lovell<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">clean</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago, tropical medicine had but<br/>
a small place in the ordinary medical <span style="color: #0000FF;">curriculum</span>, while the enormous mortality among<br/>
government <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, business employees, and<br/>
missionaries was one of the chief hindrances to<br/>
commercial and social development in the<br/>
tropics. To-day, as the direct result of advanced knowledge, not only is it known that<br/>
many diseases which gained for some regions<br/>
the title of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the white man's grave" are preventable, but vigorous measures are being taken to<br/>
exterminate them. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medicalinvestigators </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">working </span>in isolation hailed with joy the opportunities afforded by Sir Patrick Manson, who<br/>
gathered together all the physicians he could<br/>
collect and demonstrated to them some of the<br/>
recent discoveries. At the same time, a series<br/>
of lectures given at Charing Cross Hospital<br/>
attracted the attention of Mr. Joseph <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>lain, then Colonial Secretary, and at his invitation the Seamen's Hospital Society opened<br/>
a small laboratory for eighteen students.<br/>
<br/>
Almost simultaneously, a similar movement<br/>
was set on foot at Liverpool, and since that<br/>
time laboratories have been established in<br/>
Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kwala Lumpur, the Federated Malay States, Entebbe,<br/>
Uganda, British Guiana, and Khartum.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most interesting expedition<br/>
carried out was that conducted by Drs. Low<br/>
and Sambon, following on Ross's proof of the<br/>
mode of transmission of malaria. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">two<br/>
