<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OMETIMES</span>, when so jaded that<br/>
S neither newspaper scare-heads, nor<br/>
blood-and-thunder plays, nor even<br/>
<br/>
detective stories can awaken interest, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">drop </span>in<br/>
at a quiet little shop I know of, here in Boston,<br/>
and price its wares. This pair of salt-cellars?<br/>
Twenty-eight dollars. Yonder bit of coarse<br/>
embroidery? Twelve dollars. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thatovalmirror</span>, with frame of carved wood, gilded? Seventyfive dollars. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">undeeorated </span>silver bowl in<br/>
the window? One hundred and <span style="color: #0000FF;">twentyfive<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dollars-the </span>same price as the small <span style="color: #ff0000;">colognebottle </span>in the show-case or the unpretentious<br/>
after-dinner coffee-set next to it. And the<br/>
screen beneath the mirror? A <span style="color: #0000FF;">bargain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>one hundred and fifty dollars!<br/>
<br/>
Prices like those will wake up almost anybody, especially when he learns that the quiet<br/>
little shop actually sold $ 40,000 worth of its<br/>
wares last year and will very likely have reached<br/>
a total of $ 50,000 for 1907. We have here a<br/>
wonder story made real; and the secret of it<br/>
is just this: all the beautiful and useful things<br/>
on sale in that shop are made by hand, and the<br/>
demand for <span style="color: #ff0000;">hand-rpade </span>objects is increasingly<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">keen-mot </span>merely in Boston but in many other<br/>
centres. There is now a chain of handicrafts<br/>
societies <span style="color: #0000FF;">reaching </span>clear across the continent.<br/>
Yet the Boston group is the oldest, the Boston<br/>
shop the first of its type, the Boston public the<br/>
most appreciative. It is here that you see the<br/>
best development of a movement that began in<br/>
England and has been acclimatized in America<br/>
for about ten years-long enough to prove its<br/>
merits.<br/>
<br/>
Express your admiration of a carved chair<br/>
or an exquisitely woven basket in a Boston<br/>
home, and your hostess will say: "I'm ever<br/>
so glad you like it; I'm so fond of it myself.<br/>
Mr. So-and-So made it, and it attracted a lot<br/>
of attention at the show last winter. Wasn't<br/>
I lucky to capture it?" As for the price, she<br/>
will not mention that, nor does she consider it<br/>
anything <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable-tlu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>you know Bos<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tonians </span>are not celebrated for wasting their<br/>
money. And presently you perceive that she<br/>
has become quite expert in her knowledge of<br/>
hand-made treasures, thinking such lore as<br/>
much a part of a civilized mortal's intelligence<br/>
as an acquaintance with good pictures, good<br/>
music, and good books. She has sought out<br/>
the leading craftsmen in their dens, it may be,<br/>
but in any case she will talk enthusiastically<br/>
of the Arts and Crafts Exposition-and why<br/>
should she not? It delighted painters, <span style="color: #ff0000;">artcritics</span>, students, social grandees, and even the<br/>
eager multitude who seek, however vainly, to<br/>
keep "in the swim." Possibly she herself has<br/>
cultivated a gift for designing and taught her<br/>
aristocratic hands to manipulate tools. Unquestionably she has friends, in her own<br/>
fashionable world, who have done so. They<br/>
love to shape beautiful objects to adorn their<br/>
homes. They love to give away the product of<br/>
their taste and skill at Christmas time. Meanwhile, it is thought a graceful compliment to<br/>
assume that a gift has a double charm (not<br/>
simply a double, triple, or quadruple <span style="color: #ff0000;">marketvalue</span>) if the one who receives it can be told<br/>
that it was made by hand.<br/>
<br/>
A solid benefit, this, to craftsmen who support themselves by their enjoyable trade.<br/>
Long something very like a fad, the<br/>
handicraft movement has at last acquired a<br/>
sound economic basis. It provides a kind of<br/>
fun that pays for itself, yielding an adequate<br/>
livelihood for the inspired workman. Looking<br/>
over the books of the Boston shop, you find<br/>
single accounts with craftsmen ranging all the<br/>
way up to $ 4,381 within a twelvemonth.<br/>
<br/>
Who are these workmen? Graduates of<br/>
the factory system mostly. The best artisans,<br/>
seeing no advancement for themselves save by<br/>
becoming foremen or by leaving the factory<br/>
altogether, will choose the latter course. When<br/>
a man has developed superb dexterity and a<br/>
rare sense of the artistic, he hates merely to<br/>
direct the work of others<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He wants to create<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
