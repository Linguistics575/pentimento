and of the newspapers which echo them. Our<br/>
politicians take their cue from the shoutings of<br/>
the mob and misrepresent us on this question.<br/>
A false impression has grown up in the East<br/>
with regard to the real attitude of Oregon and<br/>
California toward the Oriental problem.<br/>
<br/>
The considerations that lead many intelligent<br/>
people to favor Chinese and Japanese immigration are these:<br/>
<br/>
First, there is an utter absence on the Coast<br/>
of any native-born or American white <span style="color: #ff0000;">daylaboring </span>class below the artisan or skilled<br/>
I have never yet met on this coast<br/>
an American white man who was willing to<br/>
regard himself as a day-laborer by profession,<br/>
who expected to pass his life in that capacity.<br/>
American laborers are too intelligent and too<br/>
ambitious for that. The native-born men and<br/>
boys who cultivate our ranches, pick our fruit,<br/>
build our railroads, and man our lumber crews,<br/>
are simply "working for a stake." As soon as<br/>
they have earned one or two hundred dollars, off<br/>
they go to the mines, the fisheries, the timber<br/>
and homestead claims, to set up for themselves.<br/>
They are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>labor on earth, as long as<br/>
you can hold them, but the moment they have<br/>
"made their stake" they leave. A new find at<br/>
Bullfrog, Tonopah, or Rhyolite will empty the<br/>
bunk-houses in a week.<br/>
<br/>
There is only a small supply of Italians,<br/>
Poles, Hungarians, and Russians. <span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>immigrants come by way of New York and stop<br/>
off along the whole breadth of the continent,<br/>
so the handful which reaches us is wholly<br/>
inadequate for our needs.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, we prefer the Chinese to any of<br/>
these or to the Mexicans with their dirt, laziness,<br/>
and stupidity. The Chinaman is the most<br/>
industrious worker that walks the earth in <span style="color: #0000FF;">hu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>man form. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">does</span>n't seem to know how to get<br/>
tired. All you need to do is to show him what<br/>
he has to do, and set him at it; he will stay by<br/>
it as long as he can see to work, seven days out<br/>
of the week. There is something positively<br/>
uncanny about his affection for work. No<br/>
class of white men will work with the unremitting persistency of the Chinese. The Japanese<br/>
is more human. He will quit of his own accord<br/>
occasionally, but he also is a tireless, cheerful<br/>
worker.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the Chinaman is absolutely trustworthy. If he says that he will work for a<br/>
month, you can depend on getting thirty days<br/>
of labor out of him with a certainty equaled by<br/>
few other things on this planet. If he falls sick,<br/>

<br/>
he promptly provides a countryman to do his<br/>
work and to take care of him in the intervals, if<br/>
you will allow him to remain where he is; if<br/>
not, he goes to the hospital. He may quarrel<br/>
with you, yet he will not quit his job. He will<br/>
take it out in <span style="color: #0000FF;">gesticulations </span>and Oriental "<span style="color: #0000FF;">cuss</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">words</span>" until you can get another man in his<br/>
place. You may even have difficulty in discharging him for cause until his time is up.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese is not quite so reliable in this<br/>
respect. He will sometimes leave without a<br/>
word of warning, often without any reason that<br/>
you can discover. "I like you very much, but<br/>
I think I go to-morrow" is all the satisfaction<br/>
you can get. However, it is only fair to say<br/>
that this form of desertion is not so common<br/>
as among white laborers or servants, the only<br/>
difference being that the latter grumble <span style="color: #ff0000;">beforehand</span>, threaten to leave, and give various alleged<br/>
reasons for their action, while the Jap says<br/>
nothing until his mind is made up and then<br/>
nothing can change it. He is polite and smiling<br/>
but adamant. "Shall I get you new boy?"<br/>
is his ultimate word. One of the secrets of his<br/>
troublesomeness in this regard is that he is here<br/>
for a purpose other than earning money. He<br/>
wants to learn a language, a trade, a military<br/>
secret, the geography of a town or country.<br/>
Till he accomplishes this, he is your most faithful servant; the moment it is done, he goes on<br/>
to the next accomplishment. It is significant<br/>
that it is the student class of Japanese that gives<br/>
most <span style="color: #0000FF;">trouble </span>in this respect. The coolie class<br/>
"stays put" quite steadily.<br/>
<br/>
Both races are very particular to get in advance every detail of the work they are expected<br/>
to do, or to get it during the first few days; and<br/>
then, if anything vital has been omitted, not an<br/>
inch will they go beyond the limits of the original<br/>
agreement-not even for more wages-during<br/>
that month, or week. At the end of the term<br/>
they again become elastic and will consider a<br/>
new contract, but a modification of the old<br/>
seems a thing unthinkable to them.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese is also very particular from<br/>
whom he takes his orders. "And who my<br/>
boss?" is one of his first inquiries after the<br/>
preliminaries are settled, and the person specified is the only one in the family or establishment whose authority he recognizes. He is<br/>
polite and obliging to everybody, but no change<br/>
in the order or time of his regular duties will he<br/>
make except by order of "The Boss."<br/>
<br/>
A third quality that commends both Japanese and Chinese to the people of the Coast is<br/>
