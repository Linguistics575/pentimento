</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>You see I could not <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>be Governor!"<br/>
The man who said this is not <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>Congressman<br/>
nor a capitalist nor a manufacturer, but an<br/>
humble, slave-born <span style="color: #0000FF;">Negro </span>farmer-Calvin<br/>
Brock, of Wayne County. He was talking<br/>
to the Governor of North Carolina, whose<br/>
salary is only $ 4,000 annually and whose clear<br/>
profit is minus-while Calvin Brock had made<br/>
the year before a clear <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit </span>of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">2,723.61 </span>on<br/>
fifteen acres of strawberries alone, besides<br/>
cultivating fifty acres of land in other crops.<br/>
The black Cincinnatus certainly could not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>to leave his plow for the salary of the<br/>
Chief Executive-although he has never <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen<br/>

he astonished the soil itself by the energy of<br/>
his reforms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hitching </span>a 1,100-pound mule to<br/>
an ordinary plow, he found that it would not<br/>
penetrate the brickyard that lay beneath<br/>
the few inches of cultivated upper crust.<br/>
Then he hitched up two horses and they broke<br/>
off his plow, whereupon he "cussed" and sent<br/>
to Chattanooga for a four-horse disk plow.<br/>
By this time the "moss-backed" farmers who<br/>
had never averaged more than a quarter-bale<br/>
per acre had sworn that he would ruin his<br/>
land forever with his new-fangled "<span style="color: #ff0000;">bookfarming</span>" ideas; but to no'effect. "I surely<br/>
can't make money by your plans," he retorted<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>

Another experience is that of a white farmer<br/>
in an adjoining county who paid $ 500 for a farm<br/>
of 53 acres in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1899</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>quite <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ho </span>an acre. Its<br/>
former owner had acted on the theory that he<br/>
didn't own anything except three inches of<br/>
surface soil, and with such cultivation it took<br/>
four acres of the land to make a bale of cotton.<br/>
But that policy by no means commended itself<br/>
to the new owner. Thoroughly inoculated<br/>
with the idea of crop rotation and deep plowing,<br/>
<br/>
"and it can't be any worse to try <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'book</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">farming</span>' ideas, as you call them. And as<br/>
for ruining the land, it's my own, I reckon,<br/>
and I will plow clean down half-way to China<br/>
if I want to." Of course the man ought to<br/>
have deepened his seed-bed gradually, instead<br/>
of bringing so much subsoil to the surface at<br/>
once, but liberal disk harrowing largely overcame his errors here, and the heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">cowpea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>crop and the barnyard manure did the rest.<br/>
The next year indicated the land's upward<br/>
trend; and by proper rotation and cultivation<br/>
he brought it up until, in 1905, part of it made<br/>
two bales of cotton per acre; and this year,<br/>
