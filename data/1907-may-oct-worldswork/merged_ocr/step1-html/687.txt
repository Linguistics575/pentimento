<span>ENGLAND'S HOUSE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF<br/>
<br/>
</span>Cabinet, and discussing national questions with<br/>
expert knowledge and absolute decorum.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN LORDS AND COMMONS CLASH<br/>
<br/>
The other side of the picture is very different.<br/>
There comes a time when the Lords step out<br/>
as a second chamber of the most powerful and<br/>
distinctive type and show an individuality of<br/>
which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>Senate has never dreamed.<br/>
The situation that then arises is, in a democratic<br/>
country, most extraordinary. The nation, at<br/>
a general election, returns a Liberal House of<br/>
Commons. The King, by constitutional usage,<br/>
at once appoints a Liberal Cabinet. The Cabinet passes a Liberal bill through the House of<br/>
Commons, and at once from all quarters of the<br/>
globe flock Conservative peers to Westminster<br/>
to defeat that bill in their chamber and balk its<br/>
passage into law. The hereditary chamber has<br/>
thwarted the will of the peoples' representatives. The exasperation of the House of Commons, the rage of Liberal Ministers, the scandal<br/>
to democratic ideals can better be imagined<br/>
than described. And there is no practical<br/>
remedy. It is true that the King, by a stroke<br/>
of the pen, could create the necessary <span style="color: #ff0000;">goo </span>peers<br/>
to give the Liberal party a majority in the House<br/>
cf Lords; but it is one of those many things<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">thich </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">might</span>, but do not, happen. Without<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vAtication</span>, it must be admitted that in<br/>
this <span style="color: #ff0000;">emocratic </span>country the hereditary house<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">525</span>, on the rare occasions when it chooses<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sit</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>legal and practical power of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ob</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Itiction </span>against which it is hopeless to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scaten'l </span>within the existing Consti ution.<br/>
<br/>
Conservatives who will condescend to <span style="color: #0000FF;">im<br/>
</span>agine, let us say, a House of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nonconformist </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">parsons </span>with the power of vetoing the measures<br/>
put <span style="color: #ff0000;">forwa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span>when the Conservative party is in<br/>
office, will be forced to recognize the natural<br/>
justice of Liberal rage against the Lords on these<br/>
occasions. Logical and obvious, however, as<br/>
is the Liberal plea of representation versus<br/>
heredity, a test must be applied which in England is far above logic. Logic, indeed, is not<br/>
an English attribute. The Constitution exists<br/>
on no ideal plan, but it lives from day to day as<br/>
a rough-and-ready engine for effecting the<br/>
fundamental purpose of government in this<br/>
country-the realization of the peoples' will.<br/>
Of Lords and Commons alike, this is the function. And when they differ, when one <span style="color: #0000FF;">house<br/>
</span>votes this way and the other that way, the one<br/>
that is doing its duty by the English Constitution is the one that the people, on a referendum<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9485<br/>
<br/>
</span>would hold to be right. All parties agree on<br/>
this. To say, as less thoughtful Liberals do,<br/>
that the representative chamber must <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessarily </span>think the same as the people who created<br/>
it, is to beg the question. It is more; it is to<br/>
deny the truth. For, odd and perverse as it<br/>
may seem, the pages of history record no<br/>
single occasion since 1832 when the Lords<br/>
have seen their action condemned by a general election.<br/>
<br/>
The Constitutional theorist is here faced by a<br/>
most peculiar historical fact. On the only<br/>
serious occasion when the Lords and the representative chamber have come to blows, in 1893,<br/>
the people took the first opportunity of sweeping<br/>
away-not the Lords, but the existing Liberal<br/>
House of Commons. Why and how this arises<br/>
is beyond the wit of democratic man to see.<br/>
The occasion may not be repeated. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day</span>,<br/>
when again the Lords have thwarted the Commons, the electoral decision may be different.<br/>
The indications, however, are not altogether<br/>
that way. And if the theorist will abase <span style="color: #ff0000;">himsel </span>to the level of an erring human being, he<br/>
may catch a fleeting notion of some inner subtleties of the art of representation which are<br/>
revealed to babes and sucklings, but which wise<br/>
men seek in vain. The Lords, when they come<br/>
in their hundreds, are Englishmen and not<br/>
politicians. They are prejudiced, they are<br/>
dull, they are human, they are averse to change.<br/>
And so are the English people. Liberals are<br/>
just men with most enlightened minds, and so<br/>
was Aristides. But there came a day in Athens<br/>
when the people banished Aristides, because,<br/>
in the ever-memorable story, "they were tired<br/>
Philosophy<br/>
may one day be able to account on some such<br/>
lines for the peculiar fact that the Lords have<br/>
never offended, and have once emphatically<br/>
asserted, the existing opinion of the English<br/>
people as against a Liberal Government.<br/>
<br/>
The final view of this strange chamber is<br/>
that it permanently represents the stolid characteristics of the English race, which is at once<br/>
democratic and conservative. Its virtues and<br/>
vices are those of common Englishmen. It<br/>
never leads; it sometimes follows with <span style="color: #ff0000;">relue<br/>
</span>tance. But the instinct that guides it, bad or<br/>
good, is the instinct of the ordinary man who<br/>
cares for politics far less than for sport. Just<br/>
as the prejudices of the Sultan of Turkey are<br/>
those of his benighted subjects, so, if the lowest<br/>
view be taken, is the obstruction of the Lords<br/>
the obstruction of the people. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Commons<br/>
