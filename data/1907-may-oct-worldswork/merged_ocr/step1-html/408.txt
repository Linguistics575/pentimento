Meanwhile, Mr. Flanagan's financial supporters <span style="color: #ff0000;">had.become </span>so involved with railroad<br/>
building in Mexico that they notified him that<br/>
they could not meet the issue, and he found<br/>
himself without the necessary funds to go on<br/>
with the project. But Mr. Flanagan got others.<br/>
Mr. August Belmont, although he was then<br/>
grappling with the great task of building the<br/>
New York subway, became interested in the<br/>
project. He knew a great deal about the<br/>
lower Massachusetts coast, for he had often<br/>
sailed yachts in those waters. By a curious<br/>
coincidence, it happens that the earth which<br/>
will be dug out for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">across </span>Cape Cod<br/>
was once owned by the first of the Perry settlers in this country, a forefather of Commodore Perry, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">kinsman </span>of Mr. Belmont.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Belmont summoned Mr. William Barclay Parsons, the consulting engineer of the<br/>
New York subway, and turned over to him all<br/>
the engineering problems, while other questions<br/>
were being studied in the various departments<br/>
of his banking house. When once satisfied<br/>
of the final outcome, Mr. Belmont determined<br/>
to back Mr. Flanagan and his scheme to the<br/>
extent of the required $ 12,000,000.<br/>
<br/>
The canal will be about twelve miles long.<br/>
From Buzzards Bay (on the south side of the<br/>
isthmus) to the village of Sandwich in Barnstable Bay (on the north side) the distance is<br/>
about eight miles. The approaches on both<br/>
sides will add about four miles more. The<br/>
canal will start on the south side at the spot<br/>
where stands the country house of Mr. Grover<br/>
Cleveland. The country home of the late<br/>
Joseph Jefferson will likewise be in the canal<br/>
zone, so the digging of the big ditch will cause<br/>
"Gray Gables" and <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Crow's Nest" to vanish<br/>
from the map.<br/>
<br/>
The width of the canal will vary at certain<br/>
places from 250 to 300 feet at the surface, and<br/>
at the bottom it will be 160 feet wide. The<br/>
depth will be thirty feet. By borings which<br/>
have already been made, it has been found that<br/>
the formation is of sand, with an occasional<br/>
boulder. The route is through a valley, the<br/>
last spot on the isthmus from which the ocean<br/>
receded ages ago when the geological formation<br/>
of the region was in progress. There will be<br/>
nothing difficult in the construction of the great<br/>
waterway. As the sandy soil extends all the<br/>
way to the required depth, no expensive<br/>
rock-drilling will be necessary. The entire<br/>
work can be done with dredges, four of which<br/>
will be set to work next summer. One<br/>
<br/>
THE CAPE COD SHIP CANAL<br/>
<br/>
will be put in operation at "Gray Gables,"<br/>
on the south side, and will work northward.<br/>
Another will be started at the village of Sandwich, on the Barnstable or north shore, and<br/>
will work southward. The other two will be<br/>
placed in the centre of the route, one working<br/>
each way. At the entrance to Barnstable Bay,<br/>
a jetty 2,400 feet long will be constructed from<br/>
the lower water line out to a depth of thirty<br/>
feet.<br/>
<br/>
About 30,000 vessels now pass around Cape<br/>
Cod in a year. As traffic increases, 40,000<br/>
will more nearly represent the number that will<br/>
be on the coastwise route to and from Boston<br/>
by the time the canal is completed. It has<br/>
been figured out that, with a basis of four miles<br/>
per hour and a headway of half an hour, there<br/>
would be in the canal at one time nine vessels.<br/>
This would give a comfortable distance of more<br/>
than a mile between each vessel going in the<br/>
same direction. By increasing the speed and<br/>
lessening the headway, the capacity of the canal<br/>
could be greatly augmented.<br/>
<br/>
On a basis of six miles per hour, which is,<br/>
perhaps, nearer the actual speed, the canal will<br/>
be able to accommodate 60,000 vessels per<br/>
annum. If the headway is reduced to a quarter<br/>
of an hour, the canal can accommodate 80,000<br/>
ships per annum. Many of the sailing vessels<br/>
will be towed in fleets. The barges which do<br/>
much of the coal business will likewise be<br/>
towed through the canal.<br/>
<br/>
This shortening of the time between New<br/>
York and Boston will enable a man owning<br/>
two vessels to do the business of three. If the<br/>
owners of. the canal do not fix the rate of tariff<br/>
or toll too high, it is probable that 95 per cent.<br/>
of the ships doing business along the coast will<br/>
take the "near-cut" and avoid the dangers of<br/>
Vineyard Sound and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">treacherous </span>shores of<br/>
Cape Cod.<br/>
<br/>
The opposition at first manifested by the<br/>
railroad lines against the promoters of the<br/>
Cape Cod canal has completely vanished.<br/>
They recognize that the canal will work to the<br/>
general prosperity of the manufacturing industries of New England and will create more<br/>
business for railroads and steamships alike.<br/>
Instead of endeavoring to obstruct the progress<br/>
of the work by throwing obstacles in Mr.<br/>
Flanagan's way, they are working harmoniously<br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a valuable waterway in case of<br/>
war, for it will allow the passage of the largest<br/>
ships in the navy.<br/>
