<br/>
</span>usual method, and that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>small proportion are born with such mental and physical<br/>
defects as materially <span style="color: #0000FF;">affect </span>their progress.<br/>
<br/>
THE CRUCIAL TEST<br/>
<br/>
If one wishes to know whether his school<br/>
is really educating the children as they should<br/>
be educated, let him make an <span style="color: #ff0000;">inrcigation</span>.<br/>
The test is easy. Sometime after the beginning of the term, let him go into the rooms and<br/>
ask the teachers if they have pupils who are<br/>
not fitted for the work. In every class will be<br/>
found a number who are dragging, and a<br/>
number at the head of the class who can easily<br/>
do the work though absent every other day.<br/>
If this condition exists, the friends of the<br/>
schools should insist upon such a change as<br/>
will make it possible for the teacher to give<br/>
tasks and instruction suited to all the pupils<br/>
in the class.<br/>
<br/>
In New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, and other cities, I have sought in vain for<br/>
a class where the teacher thought all were<br/>
fitted for the work. Most said they never had<br/>
been and never expected to be so fortunate<br/>
as to have such a condition. At the Rhode<br/>
Island Teachers' Association I asked 2,000<br/>
teachers how many had in their classes only<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9255<br/>
<br/>
</span>those who should be there. Not a hand was<br/>
raised. Seemingly every hand was raised when<br/>
I asked how many always had pupils who<br/>
should not be where they were. Similar<br/>
results were shown when I lately asked 1,000<br/>
Washington teachers the same questions. I<br/>
received no different answers from any body<br/>
of teachers of whom I asked the questions.<br/>
<br/>
TEACHERS AND PUPILS DIFFER<br/>
<br/>
Since all admit that teachers vary greatly<br/>
in many ways affecting their <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency</span>, and<br/>
none dare deny that the children in every grade<br/>
differ widely in many ways affecting their<br/>
progress, is it not an injustice to expect all to<br/>
move at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>rate? Why should pupils<br/>
be put in educational mills and the teachers<br/>
be expected to grind them out alike? Who<br/>
will assert that individuality is not of more<br/>
importance than uniformity of taste, of grading,<br/>
of ability, of character, or of aspiration? Is<br/>
not individuality the divinity of the child which<br/>
should be watched for, carefully studied and<br/>
lovingly guarded? Is it not of vital importance<br/>
that the friends of the schools should insist<br/>
upon an immediate change in the method of<br/>
organization, that all may advance as they<br/>
have the individual ability and opportunity?<br/>

WILLIAM H. ALLEN<br/>
<br/>
SECRETARY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>BUREAU <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>MUNICIPAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">RESEARCH</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>NEW YORK<br/>
<br/>
[ The Bureau of Municipal Research in New York is an<br/>
organization to find out and to keep the public informed of<br/>
the facts about government, as expert bookkeepers enable<br/>
managers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>business concerns to know how they are doing.<br/>
The trustees of it include such men as Messrs. E. R. A. Seligman, R. Fulton Cutting, Carrol D. Wright, and Richard<br/>
Watson Gilder. In this article, Mr. Allen explains its<br/>
method of work under the direction of Mr. Henry <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brubre</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>HE main trouble with good city govern<br/>
I ment in the United States is that it<br/>
comes and goes by fits and starts. A<br/>
<br/>
good administration is followed by a bad one;<br/>
and so on<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The reason is the lack of a clear<br/>
knowledge by the people of the real facts about<br/>
city government-whether it is good or bad.<br/>
There is no mechanism whereby facts may be<br/>
<br/>
carefully investigated and presented in convincing form to the voting population. The<br/>
Bureau of Municipal Research in New York<br/>
is an attempt to remedy this defect and the<br/>
results of one experiment show the manner in<br/>
which it does its work.<br/>
<br/>
A SPECIMEN INVESTIGATION<br/>
<br/>
The Bureau determined upon an <span style="color: #0000FF;">investigation </span>of the administration of Mr. Ahearn,<br/>
the President of the Borough of Manhattan,<br/>
on account of the magnitude and importance<br/>
of its operations. The investigators started<br/>
out with no evidence that there was corruption,<br/>
with some little evidence that there was <span style="color: #ff0000;">ineffi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ciency</span>, but especially with a full <span style="color: #0000FF;">appreciation<br/>
<br/>
