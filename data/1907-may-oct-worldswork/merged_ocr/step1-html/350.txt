nations is itself more and more a safeguard.<br/>
As far back as the middle of the last century,<br/>
Napoleon <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>gave up his plan to help drive<br/>
the Austrians out of Italy <span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span>cause the mere<br/>
rumor of such an intention created a panic on<br/>
the Bourse. Years later, the French nation<br/>
pocketed its resentment over the British<br/>
occupation of Egypt, because that occupation<br/>
was followed by a steady rise in the value of<br/>
the Egyptian bonds held largely by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French<br/>
</span>people. Similarly to-day, England and America are held in bonds of commerce so<br/>
strongly that an eminent British statesman<br/>
is said to have suggested that in case of<br/>
war England burn the warehouses of Liverpool and America the warehouses of New<br/>
York as the first step in the struggle.<br/>
And if we went to war with Japan to-day, the<br/>
first result would be that the American holders<br/>
of over a hundred million dollars of Japanese<br/>
bonds would see a large part of that property<br/>
disappear.<br/>
<br/>
The very essence of the peace movement<br/>
seems to lie in this matter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">commerce</span>. The<br/>
problem that brought it to life seems to have<br/>
been strangely compounded of humanitarianism<br/>
and of commercialism. First, it is the problem of saving life. Second, it is the problem<br/>
of using the life thus saved for the further<br/>
development of the world. Third, it is the<br/>
problem of diverting the billions of dollars<br/>
<br/>
that would be wasted in war to the development of the world and the increasing of its<br/>
commerce.<br/>

cost of wars, the advocate of peace has a good<br/>
argument in the immense amount of money<br/>
expended by the nations on preparations for<br/>
war. Ten European nations and the United<br/>
States spent upon their armies in 1889<br/>
$ 873,423,401. The combined armies, upon<br/>
a peace footing, numbered 2,755,000. The<br/>
armies of the same nations upon a war <span style="color: #0000FF;">footing </span>would have numbered 8,062,000. If,<br/>
either <span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>the peace movement or through<br/>
the continued growth of the commercial spirit,<br/>
one-half of the annual peace-basis expenditure<br/>
of these nations can be diverted so that in the<br/>
year 1925 it will go to the opening of new<br/>
industrial or agricultural regions in Africa, by<br/>
just so much the world would be the richer.<br/>
<br/>
It is only within the last half-century that<br/>
war for war's sake has ceased to be a conventional thing among the nations. To-day a<br/>
wanton war is liable to be stopped by the<br/>
waving of the club of one of the world's <span style="color: #0000FF;">policemen-the </span>United States, Britain, Germany, or<br/>
France. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yet </span>the condition of the world remains a condition of armed neutrality, so<br/>
delicately balanced that its equilibrium may<br/>
be threatened even by so <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>an individual as a Castro of Venezuela.<br/>

[ Early in May, Mr. Yoakum, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway,<br/>
was asked by THE WORLD'S WORK to outline his views on the railroad problem<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the steps that must be taken to<br/>
<br/>
settle it. This article is the result<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
</span>BELIEVE that the solution of the railroad<br/>
I problem is to be found in the cooperation<br/>
<br/>
of the people and the railroads, through the<br/>
Government of the United States. The time<br/>
has gone by when the railroad could go ahead<br/>
and work out its plans, and carry on its operations, without consulting the interests of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">As </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leaders </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">school</span>" of railroad <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, he is qualified to<br/>
<br/>
people. The railroad must fall in line with<br/>
the democratic institutions of this country.<br/>
That there have been mistakes by the<br/>
railroads, we admit, and that some of the<br/>
troubles of to-day are the legitimate and logical<br/>
outgrowth of such mistakes. The object<br/>
