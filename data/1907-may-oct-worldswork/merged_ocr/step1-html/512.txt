<br/>
</span>least one point from which you may see the<br/>
ocean on either side of the island. On days<br/>
when the atmosphere is heavy, one may have<br/>
the experience of riding through a mist of cloud,<br/>
with clouds floating down into the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneath </span>him. He need not even lean in the<br/>
saddle to pluck the coffee berries growing by<br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things we did was to pass a<br/>
law that made it practically impossible for the<br/>
planter to sell his coffee anywhere except in<br/>
the United States. And when he brought it<br/>
to the United States, we waved him aside with<br/>
the remark that his coffee was not up to the<br/>
standard of the Mocha and Java which we get<br/>
from the Latin-American republics. But a<br/>
worse blow came the following year. The<br/>
hurricane of 1899, which destroyed thousands<br/>
of lives, almost ruined the coffee plantations<br/>
-and the coffee bush grows slowly.<br/>
<br/>
It has now been eight years since the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hurricane</span>, and the plantations have recovered; but<br/>
market conditions have improved but slightly.<br/>
The Americans are steadily at work on two<br/>
problems-to make two berries grow where<br/>
only one formerly grew, and to improve the<br/>
quality. That high-grade coffee can be produced in Porto Rico is beyond doubt. Not<br/>
even in the French Market of New Orleans<br/>
could you obtain a finer brew than some old<br/>
Negro woman would serve you in a Porto<br/>
Rican market-place in 1898 for two centavos.<br/>
This was the ordinary coffee. A dealer in the<br/>
coffee district showed me a much finer grade<br/>
which he called <span style="color: #ff0000;">caracolillo</span>, which was not on<br/>
the market. When the American coffee drinker<br/>
improves his taste, the Porto Rican planter<br/>
will come again into his own.<br/>
<br/>
THE FINANCES OF THE ISLAND<br/>
<br/>
When the Island first became American<br/>
territory, the finances of the cities and towns<br/>
were in an indescribable condition. Even<br/>
in 1901, only two out of the sixty-six municipalities were free of debt. That the prosperity<br/>
and progress of the island have been general<br/>
is shown by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Treasurer</span>'s report. By the<br/>
end of June, 1906, all but thirty-five towns<br/>
were out of debt and the indications were that<br/>
the end of the present year would <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>not a<br/>
single town whose indebtedness was not provided for. Yet they have at the same time<br/>
been spending more in public works than they<br/>
had spent for decades.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best evidences of the financial<br/>
<br/>
THE UNITED STATES IN PORTO RICO<br/>
<br/>
soundness of Porto Rico is given by the sale of<br/>
its bonds for building roads. The issue was<br/>
for $ 1,000,000 at 4 per cent. Notwithstanding<br/>
some unfavorable conditions connected with<br/>
this issue, the amount was found to be oversubscribed at a premium, at a time when New<br/>
York City fours were selling at par.<br/>
<br/>
ERADICATING THE ONE GREAT DISEASE<br/>
<br/>
To say that the American occupation has<br/>
resulted in the introduction of sanitary methods<br/>
in the various towns would be to utter a commonplace. The house-cleaning and <span style="color: #ff0000;">streetcleaning </span>all the way from San Juan to Mayaguez<br/>
were begun long ago. But the most far-reaching work that has been done for the health<br/>
of the island is the achievement of Dr. Ashford,<br/>
of the Army, and Dr. King of the Marine<br/>
Hospital Service, with whom were associated<br/>
a number of native physicians.<br/>
<br/>
If you will examine the books on Porto Rico<br/>
that were written a few years ago, you will<br/>
read that "tropical anemia" was the great<br/>
disease of the island and that the high deathrate and low percentage of persons older than<br/>
forty-five were due to this impoverishment of<br/>
the blood. It was really pitiful to travel over<br/>
the island and see the number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pallid</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">listless<br/>
</span>natives; but to the soldiers, this was an evidence either of laziness or of lack of nourishing food. The American doctors began to<br/>
make blood examinations and it was soon<br/>
found that the island was afflicted with the<br/>
"hook-worm" disease-a parasitic affection<br/>
of the blood which is infectious. When this<br/>
report was made, the insular legislature made<br/>
a small appropriation for experiment work;<br/>
the next report showed that several thousand<br/>
cases had been treated and all but a few<br/>
patients had been cured. Larger appropriations and further experiments confirmed all<br/>
that had gone before, so the legislature of 1906<br/>
set aside the sum of $ 50,000 for experiment<br/>
stations for the eradication of this widespread<br/>
and debilitating affection. This means that the<br/>
stigma of laziness will be removed from the<br/>
Porto Rican and there will no longer be the<br/>
remarkable difference between the eager,<br/>
bright-eyed children and the sluggish, listless<br/>
adults that has so often impressed the traveler.<br/>
<br/>
Too many writers have fitted the description<br/>
of the various classes of West Indians found in<br/>
the coast towns to the native Porto Rican.<br/>
It would be just as <span style="color: #0000FF;">fair </span>for an Englishman to<br/>
describe the inhabitants of a town in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Black<br/>
<br/>
