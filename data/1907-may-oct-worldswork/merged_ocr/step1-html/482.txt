<br/>
The fallacy of Socialism is in supposing that<br/>
men are much more nearly equal than they are<br/>
in capacity. The best way to combat it is to<br/>
make men as nearly as possible equal before<br/>
the law and in opportunity. This means<br/>
the prevention of the improper economic or<br/>
political use of wealth. This is a task of<br/>
government, of the practical business world,<br/>
and of society. There is no formula whereby<br/>
it may be done. It can be done only by the<br/>
nurture of vigorous personalities and by the<br/>
maintenance of right social, economic, and<br/>
political standards-in a word, by public<br/>
opinion as it expresses itself in all these ways.<br/>
In the last analysis, this is the only safeguard<br/>
that we have against any dangerous tendency.<br/>

A HUNDRED MILLION-DOLLAR SAVINGS BANK<br/>
<br/>
HE deposits in a single savings bank,<br/>
<br/>
situated on the Bowery in New York, have<br/>
reached 100 million dollars. That is an event<br/>
not only in the life of the Bowery Savings Bank<br/>
but also in the life of the East Side of New<br/>
York. It is not a community in which one<br/>
looks for thrift: rather the contrary. Of course<br/>
the bank does not draw alone from the poorer<br/>
section of the city. Its deposits come from all<br/>
over New York and from outside as well. Still<br/>
it is a remarkable thing that a savings bank<br/>
located as this one is located should have become the giant of the savings banks.<br/>
<br/>
One hundred million dollars is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>huge sum<br/>
of money. In these days when the Wall Street<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">financiers </span>have adopted a hundred millions as<br/>
the unit of large finance, one is apt to forget just<br/>
how big the sum is. The deposits in this one<br/>
bank are nearly three times as great as the<br/>
entire postal savings of Japan. If put into<br/>
railroad building, they would build more than<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">3,000 </span>miles of road at an average of $ 33,000 per<br/>
mile-and that is more than most of the roads<br/>
in the West have cost. They would build a<br/>
fleet of fourteen first-class battleships and leave<br/>
a surplus. Ten years ago, the total net deposits<br/>
of all the national banks in Chicago barely<br/>
equaled the deposits in this one New York<br/>
savings bank to-day.<br/>
<br/>
Two forces have brought about the result.<br/>
The first is the increasing thrift of the people.<br/>
Wages, of course, have been very high for the<br/>
last few years, and men have learned to save<br/>
because they had something to save. The<br/>
lesson of thrift has been a hard one for the<br/>
<br/>
MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
average American working man and woman to<br/>
learn. It comes more naturally to the German,<br/>
the Hebrew, and the Italian of the East Side<br/>
than to anyone born under the Stars and Stripes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-yet </span>it has come to the native American, to<br/>
some extent at least. There are about <span style="color: #0000FF;">2OO</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OOO<br/>
</span>people who have deposits in this one bank.<br/>
Throughout the whole country, there are over<br/>
8,000,000 who have funds in the savings banks.<br/>
In one year, 1906, the number of depositors<br/>
increased nearly half a million.<br/>
<br/>
The other force that has made this bank great<br/>
is the stringent state law of New York with<br/>
regard to savings banks. That law has made<br/>
them as nearly absolutely safe as it is possible<br/>
to make them. All investments are limited to<br/>
a certain kind of real estate loan, to certain<br/>
strong railroad bonds, and to certain specified<br/>
loans. Inspection is rigid and severe. The<br/>
savings bank is not a business institution so<br/>
much as it is a trust for the people. The men<br/>
who undertake it look for no sudden profits,<br/>
but seek their reward through slow growth and<br/>
stability. The result is that the people of the<br/>
United States have come to regard the savings<br/>
banks of New York and Massachusetts-where<br/>
similar laws are enforced-as the safest,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">soundest</span>, and most conservative financial<br/>
institutions in this country. It is a lesson the<br/>
other states may well take to heart.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">LESSON </span>FROM MARS<br/>
<br/>
HE astronomers this summer have another<br/>
chance to find out what they can about<br/>
life on Mars, while the planet is within the<br/>
nearest range of our <span style="color: #0000FF;">telescopes </span>and cameras.<br/>
Whether the inhabitants of Mars have a system<br/>
of artificial canals or not, the theory that they<br/>
have has a great interest for men of imaginative<br/>
minds, as Professor Ray Lankester has pointed<br/>
out, for purely terrestrial reasons. These canals,<br/>
if the astronomers' guess be correct, imply the<br/>
peaceful cooperation of the population of the<br/>
whole planet. It is an irrigation-work on a<br/>
world-wide scale. The inhabitants must all<br/>
have not only peaceful relations but a definite<br/>
and active plan of cooperation with one another<br/>
from pole to pole. There must be social and<br/>
industrial helpfulness as well as peace. The<br/>
whole planet must be as one country. Socialism itself has never dreamed nor sketched a<br/>
more complete system of cooperation.<br/>
Now this is good to think about. If all the<br/>
nations on our globe were obliged to depend<br/>
for water and the fertility of the earth upon the<br/>
