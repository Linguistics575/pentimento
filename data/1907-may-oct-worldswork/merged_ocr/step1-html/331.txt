<span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOWN<br/>
<br/>
</span>committed by strangers or by men who had come<br/>
into town from the surrounding community.<br/>
Twenty-eight cases were either never tried or<br/>
were of so trivial a nature that no fine was<br/>
imposed. Sixty-four were cases of disturbing<br/>
the peace.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to read the records of the<br/>
mayor's court. They are an index to the life<br/>
of the village and reflect the changing current<br/>
of public opinion in regard to the moral discipline and order of the town.<br/>
<br/>
In July, 1902, the records show that fourteen<br/>
persons were arrested and fined for failure to<br/>
pay the street tax. Every citizen of the town<br/>
is required to do $ 3 worth of work on the<br/>
streets every year. Some had neglected to pay<br/>
this labor tax and allowed the streets to fall<br/>
into a condition of neglect. As a result of a<br/>
discussion of the matter in the town council,<br/>
a number of the delinquents were arrested and<br/>
compelled to pay fines amounting to $ 3.30<br/>
and costs amounting to $ 1.40, each.<br/>
<br/>
Again, in 1904, a man was arrested for<br/>
gambling. He had established what is known<br/>
in sporting parlance as a "crap" game, and<br/>
on Saturday nights a number of the young men<br/>
of the village were accustomed to gather at his<br/>
place to gamble. He was repeatedly warned<br/>
and finally the town marshal and some of the<br/>
more substantial citizens made a raid upon the<br/>
place and arrested fifteen persons. The cases<br/>
were <span style="color: #ff0000;">dismissed'after </span>each man had paid a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine<br/>
</span>of $ 2. A year later, another man was arrested<br/>
for running a "blind tiger," selling liquor <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>a license. He formerly owned a store in<br/>
the town but began selling liquor, then commenced to drink, and was rapidly "going to the<br/>
dogs." After his place had been closed, he<br/>
went out into the country and took up farming<br/>
again. It is reported that he is doing well<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
During the year 1905, there were several<br/>
disturbances in the town which were traced<br/>
directly to the illicit liquor sellers. Men<br/>
would come into town on Saturdays to do their<br/>
marketing, fall to drinking, and end in a fight.<br/>
Things became so bad at last that a public<br/>
meeting was held in regard to the matter. As<br/>
a result of this meeting, the town marshal,<br/>
the mayor, and the treasurer were appointed<br/>
to get evidence and secure the conviction of<br/>
those who were guilty. Six persons were<br/>
convicted and fined at that time. One of<br/>
these, a woman, left town. Another is still<br/>
under suspicion and the rest, now on their farms,<br/>
<br/>
9129<br/>
<br/>
have become respectable citizens. To my<br/>
mind, the interesting fact in regard to these<br/>
prosecutions is that they served not merely to<br/>
correct a public abuse but to reform the men<br/>
who were prosecuted. In most cases, these<br/>
men went back to the farms and became useful<br/>
members of the community.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be pretty well agreed that the<br/>
moral conditions of the Mound Bayou colony<br/>
are better than those in other Negro settlements in the Delta. Some years ago, when<br/>
the question was an "issue" in the community,<br/>
a committee was appointed from each of the<br/>
churches to make a house to house canvass of<br/>
the colony, in order to determine to what extent<br/>
loose family relations existed. The report of<br/>
this committee showed that there were forty<br/>
families in the colony where men and women<br/>
were living together without the formality of<br/>
a marriage ceremony. As a result of this<br/>
report, the people of the town gave notice that<br/>
these forty couples would have to marry within<br/>
a certain length of time or they would be prosecuted. Nearly all of them acted upon this<br/>
suggestion; the others moved away.<br/>
<br/>
"Since then," said Mr. Montgomery, in<br/>
speaking about the matter, "we have had no<br/>
trouble of this kind. Upon occasions, the<br/>
women who are conspicuous in towns and<br/>
cities and who travel in the Delta, making the<br/>
various camps on pay-days and who more or<br/>
less infest the larger plantations, have tried to<br/>
get a footing here, but have never succeeded.<br/>
They can get no place to stay and have to leave<br/>
on the next train. This is now generally<br/>
known and we have no trouble on that score."<br/>
<br/>
When I asked Mr. Montgomery how he<br/>
explained the fact that they had been able to<br/>
obtain such good results in the way of order<br/>
and morality among the people of the colony,<br/>
he said: "I attribute it to the force of public<br/>
opinion. The regulations that we enforce<br/>
have public sentiment behind them. The<br/>
people recognize that the laws, when they are<br/>
enforced, represent the sentiment of the community and are imposed for their own good.<br/>
It is not so easy for them to realize that where<br/>
the government is entirely in the hands of<br/>
white <span style="color: #0000FF;">mem</span>"<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has helped to maintain order<br/>
in the colony is the fact that Bolivar County<br/>
prohibits the sale of liquor. More than once<br/>
the liquor men have attempted to pass a law<br/>
that would license the selling of liquor in the<br/>
county. Some years ago a determined effort<br/>
