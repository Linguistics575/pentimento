</span>tested these forty years-his wisdom in leaving<br/>
the fund to be administered by a board of<br/>
public-spirited men, without conditions except<br/>
his indication of the general use to which it<br/>
should be put; and the members of the<br/>
board have, of course, served without compensation. They have administered it more<br/>
usefully than the donor himself could have<br/>
spent it for this purpose in his lifetime; for a<br/>
self-perpetuating board of high-minded men<br/>
can fit their action to changing conditions,<br/>
year by year, decade by decade.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Peabody's example was followed in<br/>
1882 by Mr. John F. Slater, who gave<br/>
$ 1,000,000 to be used for the education of<br/>
Negroes. Of this fund, the income, which<br/>
has now exceeded the principal, has<br/>
been wisely applied-much more wisely applied than it would have been if it had been<br/>
given by any one man for whatever specific<br/>
institutions he could have thoroughly investigated in his lifetime. The unexpended<br/>
part of this fund is now about $ 1,700,000.<br/>
Its increase is due largely to the efficient <span style="color: #0000FF;">administration </span>of Mr. Morris K. Jesup, the<br/>
treasurer.<br/>
<br/>
This example was, in turn, followed by Mr.<br/>
Carnegie when he established, by a gift of<br/>
$ 10,000,000, the Carnegie Institution for the<br/>
promotion of research. Again a board of<br/>
distinguished men was found to give their<br/>
time and thought to discover most fruitful<br/>
uses of this money.<br/>
<br/>
Then Mr. John D. Rockefeller adopted the<br/>
same plan when he gave first $ 1,000,000 to be<br/>
used in furthering education in the South; to<br/>
which he added $ 10,000,000 for furthering<br/>
higher education throughout the United States,<br/>
and subsequently (in February of this year,<br/>
just forty years to a day after the gift of George<br/>
Peabody was made) $ 32,000,000 more for the<br/>
same large purpose-making a total of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">343,000,000</span>, the income of $ 42,000,000 of<br/>
which is administered for education by the<br/>
General Education Board, without restrictions<br/>
or conditions; and members of this self-perpetuating board, of course (as of all the similar<br/>
boards), do this public service without <span style="color: #0000FF;">compensation</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Carnegie made another <span style="color: #ff0000;">foundationfollowing </span>the same plan of <span style="color: #ff0000;">administrationof </span>$ 10,000,000 for the compensation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">collegeteachers </span>of long and honorable service. The<br/>
latest of the now lengthening list of these<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">munificent </span>foundations, made on this same<br/>

principle, is the fund of $ 10,000,000 for the<br/>
betterment of conditions of living made by<br/>
Mrs. Russell Sage.<br/>
<br/>
Not to speak of many lesser gifts, these<br/>
make six great foundations which comprise<br/>
an original principal of $ 75,000,000 devoted<br/>
to the public welfare, released on the instant<br/>
the gifts were made from all control or in-,<br/>
fluence by their donors and administered by<br/>
men who give their time and thought to the<br/>
work from love of their fellows; and all these<br/>
great <span style="color: #ff0000;">bcnefactions </span>are unaccompanied by any<br/>
conditions except an indication by the donors<br/>
of the large purposes for which they are to be<br/>
used.<br/>
<br/>
These important boards are, in a sense,<br/>
a new sort of the machinery of civilization.<br/>
They are neither political nor ecclesiastical.<br/>
They exist, each for its own purpose and for<br/>
nothing else, without obligations or entanglements; and they are all <span style="color: #ff0000;">sclf-perpetuating</span>.<br/>
They have, in varying degrees, as the purpose<br/>
of each requires, thorough organizations;<br/>
and they go about their work of bettering the<br/>
conditions of life, of broadening human<br/>
knowledge, and of strengthening and <span style="color: #0000FF;">extending </span>education as systematically as the best<br/>
business organizations do their business tasks.<br/>
<br/>
A POSSIBLE NEW ERA IN MEDICINE<br/>
<br/>
IGH hopes are held by an increasing<br/>
number of distinguished physicians of<br/>
what promises to be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">revolutionary </span>system<br/>
both of curative and preventive treatment<br/>
of a large number of diseases. Sir Almroth<br/>
Edward Wright, a distinguished English <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>vestigator and physician, who has had much to<br/>
do with its application, has declared that<br/>
"we have, in the power of raising the <span style="color: #0000FF;">antibacterial </span>power of the blood with respect to<br/>
any invading microbe, out of all comparison<br/>
the most valuable asset in medicine."<br/>
<br/>
For that is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mcthod-to </span>increase the<br/>
resisting power of the blood against <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>invading disease. The philosophy of the treatment is simple-delicate and <span style="color: #ff0000;">difticult </span>as its<br/>
application is. The white <span style="color: #0000FF;">corpuscles </span>of the<br/>
blood devour invading disease <span style="color: #ff0000;">germs-that<br/>
</span>is their function. When they are equal to<br/>
this task, the attacked person escapes the<br/>
disease. When the disease germs overpower<br/>
the white corpuscles, the attacked person<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">takes</span>" the disease. The new treatment is<br/>
so to fortify and strengthen these white corpuscles that they shall be equal to the task of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
