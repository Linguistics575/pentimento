<span>THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
should visit London and write of the ruins of<br/>
St. Paul's? London still stands, but the<br/>
gentleman from Lima is ready to fulfil his part<br/>
of the contract whenever London falls. Lima<br/>
boasts the oldest university on the whole<br/>
American continent. To-day, it is establishing<br/>
training schools and technical colleges in the<br/>
higher sciences. Education is spreading. With<br/>
it commerce grows, wealth increases, industry<br/>
reaches out its hands and grasps the tools of<br/>
its usage. The mines of the mountains yield<br/>
up their gold and copper, the great forest plains<br/>
their wealth of timber and rubber. Light<br/>
dawns in old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Peru-and </span>in Ecuador.<br/>
<br/>
Who hears of Guayaquil? Anyone who<br/>
does considers it merely "one of those little<br/>
South American places" and lets it go at that.<br/>
Our minister to Ecuador, Mr. Joseph Lee,<br/>
immortalized it recently before the National<br/>
Geographic Society by the claim that its Union<br/>
Club is the best in the tropics, with the exception of the Hong Kong Club. Guayaquil<br/>
is the emporium of Ecuador, a busy, live, commercial city. Britain, Germany, and France<br/>
are building up a steady trade with it, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>it to pay.<br/>
<br/>
Back of it, away in the mountains, lies<br/>
Quito. It attained a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleeting </span>fame in our<br/>
geographies as "the highest town in the world."<br/>
To-day, it is opening its doors to a railroad,<br/>
creeping up from Guayaquil. The railroad<br/>
is being built by a New Jersey corporation,<br/>
which may or may not be a sign' of enlightenment. If anybody regard Quito as an outlandish place, let him study, for a moment, the<br/>
following extract from the report of Mr. Lee,<br/>
before referred to:<br/>
<br/>
"Ladies in smart victorias, drawn by Chilean or native<br/>
horses, drive to and from the shops with merchandise from<br/>
Paris, New York, London, Vienna, and Berlin. Handsome officers in full regimentals stroll along the streets.<br/>
Gentlemen in frock coats and top hats are everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
"There are several good hotels in Quito-the Royal<br/>
Palace, Hotel de Paris, Hotel Americana, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Case </span>Azul.<br/>
<br/>
"The people of Quito are charming, courteous and<br/>
hospitable. I do not know any city of its size which<br/>
contains so many intelligent and cultivated people!"<br/>
<br/>
Let us take for granted the progress of Chile<br/>
and Brazil, with their greatly widening markets,<br/>
their splendid universities, their modern<br/>
methods of transportation, their constantly<br/>
growing foreign trade. These things are<br/>
written in the consular reports of the United<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">States'dryly</span>, it is true, but clearly enough.<br/>
<br/>
9097<br/>
<br/>
Venezuela and Guiana are worth fighting for.<br/>
All over South America the banners of en-.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lightenment </span>and commerce wave proudly, side<br/>
by side as, step by step, the nations rise.<br/>
<br/>
MEXICO UNDER PRESIDENT DIAZ<br/>
<br/>
In North America, too, there is progress.<br/>
About the great central city of Mexico there is<br/>
a new awakening. The lifetime of a Diaz,<br/>
the finest product of Latin America, has been<br/>
devoted to this end, and the declining years of<br/>
the great President see the beginning of the new<br/>
life he has sought to bequeath to his country.<br/>
For Mexico has but this last year taken a<br/>
great step that will, in time, put it on an equality<br/>
with the commercial nations-namely, the<br/>
adoption of a gold standard. The layman,<br/>
wise in lack of economic training, finds it hard<br/>
to realize that a debased currency has been one<br/>
of the great factors in preventing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">advancement </span>of Mexico, or any other country, as a<br/>
commercial nation. Yet it is true. The year<br/>
1906 will probably go down in Mexican history<br/>
as the year in which this final step was <span style="color: #0000FF;">taken-and </span>as the beginning of an era of commercial<br/>
growth for the land of Cortez.<br/>
<br/>
And commerce does grow, to-day, in Mexico.<br/>
Of course, there will never be true internal<br/>
growth, nor will there ever be full national<br/>
stature, until the peons become land-owners<br/>
and the great estates are homesteaded. As it<br/>
stands to-day, the great mass of Mexico's<br/>
15,000,000 inhabitants owns no land, does<br/>
little or no work, lives as live the beasts of the<br/>
field. To remedy that will take many generations, yet even to-day Mexico has put its hand<br/>
to the plow for the tilling of this most stubborn<br/>
of its fields.<br/>
<br/>
It has adopted a campaign of education--<span style="color: #0000FF;">real </span>education. There are to-day nearly 6,000<br/>
schools under state and central government,<br/>
nearly 2,500 under municipal government,<br/>
and hundreds of parochial schools in Mexico.<br/>
Nearly a million boys and girls are steadily at<br/>
school. More than sixty colleges exist for<br/>
higher education, and they are increasing<br/>
constantly. Quite recently, Mill's "Logic,"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Spencer</span>'s "Ethics," and many other philosophic<br/>
and economic text-books have been translated<br/>
into the native tongue. American critics,<br/>
such as Professor J. Mark Baldwin, have nothing but praise for the educational policies they<br/>
find in operation in the Republic of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
And what of China-the degenerate? The<br/>
fact of the matter seems to be that the terrible<br/>
<br/>
