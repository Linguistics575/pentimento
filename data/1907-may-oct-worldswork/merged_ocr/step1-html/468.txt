series combined. First in its <span style="color: #0000FF;">field</span>, it has<br/>
maintained its position as the most complete<br/>
library of outdoor life. The following<br/>
volumes are now published<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Bird <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neigh<br/>

country the Cambridge Modern History.<br/>

of Cambridge, and edited by A. W. Ward, G.<br/>
W. Prothero, and Stanley <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leathers</span>, it is the<br/>
most ambitious and'comprehensive history of<br/>
modern times. Its scope is the evolution of<br/>
Europe and America from the Renaissance to<br/>
the present, and the nine volumes (of the twelve<br/>
planned) that have been published have met<br/>

<br/>

THE TEMPLE CLASSICS<br/>
<br/>
The Temple Classics, which combine in almost unrivalled degree the virtues of beauty,<br/>
convenience, and cheapness, are being issued<br/>
in this country by several publishers. McClure,<br/>
Phillips <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>Co. have announced the first two<br/>

translations to fairy tales and novels and the<br/>
older plays.<br/>
<br/>
OTHER SER IES<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rederick </span>Stokes and Company-are publishing The Story of Exploration Series, that are<br/>
authoritative studies of new lands by members<br/>
of the Royal Geographical Society of Great<br/>
Britain.<br/>
<br/>
John Lane publishes three series (at <span style="color: #ff0000;">$ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span>net,<br/>
a volume): Handbooks of Practical Gardening,<br/>
Country Handbooks, and Living Masters of<br/>
Music; besides the New Pocket Library of<br/>
standard fiction, at 75 cents net, in cloth.<br/>
<br/>
This record of serious books, all of them<br/>
elaborate undertakings involving a great investment of capital, upon which the returns must<br/>
necessarily be slow and often of doubtful profit,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">far </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">complete</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>But it serves to prove<br/>
that the publishers are, after all, men who do<br/>
seriously consider their duty to the public and<br/>
to literature as well as their own immediate<br/>
profit. It is an encouraging record of honest<br/>
endeavor to do something toward maintaining<br/>
a tradition of publishing that has not so much<br/>
been changed as obscured in the public mind<br/>
by changed methods of exploiting the lighter<br/>
products of literature.<br/>
