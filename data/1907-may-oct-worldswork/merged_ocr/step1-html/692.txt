</span>fell behind, I got a note which took away my<br/>
appetite for days. Do you suppose that, in<br/>
the face of those conditions, I was going to give<br/>
away my best men-to recommend for promotion the men who, above all others, were<br/>
enabling me not only to run that office efficiently<br/>
and economically but to hold my position and<br/>
my reputation? Not much! It may sound<br/>
selfish but it's business. Business and human<br/>
nature. I didn't propose to hurt myself and<br/>
build up some other department by giving<br/>
away the good men whom I had had the trouble<br/>
of breaking in."<br/>
<br/>
Such are the experiences and points of view<br/>
of the captains of 50,000 men, of 2,500 men,<br/>
and of 40 men. They all point to one logical<br/>
conclusion-that no true, systematic method<br/>
of sifting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>good men" from among a large<br/>
mass of employees has yet been devised.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt most industrial managers <span style="color: #0000FF;">appreciate </span>this fact, and many have made efforts, in<br/>
various ways, to devise a method for recording<br/>
individual work and capabilities of all employees. But the difficulties of doing this in a<br/>
thorough manner are always very great, and<br/>
often insurmountable. A system of inviting<br/>
suggestions upon the work has proved successful in some cases, but usually the "suggestion"<br/>
idea is so poorly devised and followed up as to<br/>
be even worse than useless. Two instances<br/>
show how it works for or against a company.<br/>
<br/>
The first is the case of a great machine-shop<br/>
in New England, employing more than 8,000<br/>
hands. A bulletin inviting suggestions from<br/>
employees has been posted in every department of the plant for the last three years.<br/>
<br/>
To an outsider, that bulletin looks all right;<br/>
especially one sentence which seems to show<br/>
the underlying desire to obtain some clue to<br/>
the "good men."<br/>
<br/>
I asked one of the most valued mechanics<br/>
in the shop how it worked.<br/>
<br/>
"Nothing doin'!" he replied, "and never<br/>
has been. Look <span style="color: #ff0000;">hcrel</span>" he continued with<br/>
real earnestness, "Supposing I knew of some<br/>
little rig that would expedite work; d'ye suppose <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'d </span>throw it in unless it was big enough to<br/>
get a patent on and give me good money?<br/>
Not much! Here's the way it works. If I<br/>
send it to the manager, he lays it before the<br/>
foreman and the foreman gets sore at me<br/>
because he hadn't thought of it himself.<br/>
That's human nature. No foreman likes to<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NEW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SCIENCE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">BUSINESS<br/>
<br/>
</span>have one of his workmen butting in on his job<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>he's pretty apt to let the man know it.<br/>
<br/>
"Then, again, if it's something that's adopted<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">makes </span>a change in the work and often in<br/>
the piece-work price, and then the poor devil<br/>
who suggested it has all his fellow workmen<br/>
down on him. That's the way it worked at<br/>
first, and every man in the plant knows it, and<br/>
I'll bet they don't get, now, five suggestions a<br/>
year!"<br/>
<br/>
That has been the fate, in a great number<br/>
of factories, of the "suggestion" idea. One<br/>
company has been more far-seeing and consequently more successful. Boxes are placed<br/>
in its various shops and the suggestions deposited therein are seen only by the manager.<br/>
If the idea is of value, it is adopted after consultation with the foreman or other authorities,<br/>
but the origin of the suggestion is not made<br/>
known. An adequate cash reward reaches the<br/>
man or, if the idea is <span style="color: #0000FF;">patentable</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fair arrangement is made with him; but his relations with<br/>
his foreman or fellow workmen are not disturbed. Consequently, no workman is likely<br/>
to hold back any idea, either of expediting<br/>
production or eliminating waste.<br/>
<br/>
The manager has on file all of these suggestions, good or useless, and gradually a list<br/>
is built up of the men who have made them.<br/>
At opportune times the manager interviews<br/>
these men, to estimate them. He has thus<br/>
secured the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span>and locations of a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">prob</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>ably "good men" out of the thousands of<br/>
employees.<br/>
<br/>
The foregoing are illustrations of a system<br/>
well applied, and poorly applied; but in the<br/>
best practice it is an unscientific makeshift<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>"good <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>Another method has been tried by the<br/>
manager of a locomotive-building plant. He<br/>
notified the foremen of the various shops that he<br/>
would pay for a correspondence course of<br/>
technical education for any two young men in<br/>
their departments whom they might <span style="color: #0000FF;">recommend-sixteen </span>in all. There was no hiding<br/>
of good men in this case. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">foremen </span>knew<br/>
that the education of those young fellows<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>not interfere with their shop work, and<br/>
they nominated the best-the most promising<br/>
they had. The plan is successful. The manager<br/>
is finding his good men right in his own works;<br/>
but he had to devise that ingenious and somewhat expensive scheme to do so<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
