men, suitable men were found to do the<br/>
work, although all the circumstances were<br/>
adverse, the city being nearly bankrupt. In<br/>
Boston, the quality of the various commissions<br/>
and boards, among which the greater part of<br/>
the city business has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">parcelled </span>out, has<br/>
been good from the beginning, and still is, and<br/>
the work of these commissions and boards is<br/>
the best municipal work done in Massachusetts.<br/>
Witness the far-seeing plans of the Metropolitan Water Board and of the Metropolitan<br/>
Park Commission. So soon as the Boston<br/>
School Committee was reduced from twentyfour to five, it was found possible to get five<br/>
competent men to do the work; and immediately<br/>
the new Committee commanded to a striking<br/>
degree the confidence of teachers, parents, and<br/>
the public at large. On this Committee of<br/>
five there were two Catholics, two Protestants,<br/>
and one Jew.<br/>
<br/>
If it be clearly understood that <span style="color: #0000FF;">successful </span>men of proved capacity are needed and<br/>
wanted for the city's service, able men will be<br/>
attracted to the service, just because the standard of the service is set high. There are always<br/>
plenty of good candidates for offices with which<br/>
go power, responsibility, and public <span style="color: #0000FF;">consideration</span>. To an office which requires for the proper<br/>
discharge of its duties a high degree of intelligence and public spirit, public-spirited men,<br/>
young and old, will aspire. Elderly men who<br/>
have already succeeded in their business and<br/>
become <span style="color: #0000FF;">pecuniarily </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">independent </span>will take office<br/>
because they find in public duties a new interest,<br/>
and a new incentive to exertion. Younger men<br/>

of high capacity will take office, because<br/>
they believe that in public office they will<br/>
have an opportunity to show to advantage what<br/>
their quality is, and that this demonstration<br/>
will be useful to them in other large affairs,<br/>
either public or private. That aldermen and<br/>
common councilmen have fallen into contempt<br/>
is a grave misfortune; for that very fact makes<br/>
it extremely difficult to recruit those bodies<br/>
with desirable citizens, except indeed in an<br/>
occasional and spasmodic way. Large school<br/>
committees, which were until lately the<br/>
rule in American cities, fell into disrepute<br/>
because election to them came to be considered<br/>
a first step for aspiring politicians. It will<br/>
be quite impossible to re-constitute the boards<br/>
of aldermen and the common councils with a<br/>
more effective and respected class of citizens;<br/>
because those boards have in many cases lost<br/>
the greater part of their powers, and with their<br/>
powers they have lost the sense of responsibility<br/>
and the consideration of the public. Whenever<br/>
an office is aggrandized, the man of capacity who<br/>
really fills the office will set a new standard of<br/>
efficient work for the office; hence the economy<br/>
of consolidations in financial, manufacturing,<br/>
and transportation enterprises. The enlarging<br/>
of units of organization is a world-wide tendency in all sorts of business; so that the<br/>
changes here suggested in municipal government are only another group of instances in<br/>
a stream of tendencies. Larger functions in<br/>
fewer hands will command the services of<br/>
better men-of men honest, efficient, and<br/>
public-spirited.<br/>

that morning, they had lighted the lamps<br/>

The justice looked down austerely upon the<br/>
woman at the bar; she focused her terrified and<br/>
wavering gaze and looked up at the justice.<br/>
<br/>
She was of Stepney; of the crushed tribe<br/>
swarming in that frightful region. She bore<br/>
the marks of dirt and privation, and yet clearly<br/>
she was not from the lowest depths. About<br/>
her shoulders was an old shawl, tattered and<br/>
faded to a dirty yellow; beneath, a gown worn<br/>
and rusty with stains; her bare toes protruded<br/>
