<span>A NEGRO CO <span style="color: #ff0000;">LLEGIC<br/>
<br/>
</span>for the Xenia markets, has a farm of <span style="color: #ff0000;">100 </span>acres<br/>
in the neighborhood. James E. Smith, of<br/>
the class of 1891, a carpenter by trade, has a<br/>
farm of 100 acres near the school.<br/>
<br/>
Among other homes are those of James<br/>
P. Maxwell, treasurer of the College, who has<br/>
lived here for <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>years; Horace Talbert, who has been for ten years secretary of<br/>
the College; Mrs. S. T. Mitchell, wife of a<br/>
former president of the College; James <span style="color: #0000FF;">Masterson</span>, whose house is now occupied by Lieutenant Davis, teacher of military tactics, and<br/>
Edward H. Clark, professor of physics and<br/>
astronomy. He is a descendant of a family<br/>
that came out to Cincinnati from Virginia at<br/>
an early day, members of which have been<br/>
connected with the University almost since its<br/>
foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Among the other members of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">snity<br/>
</span>who have been attracted to Wilberforce by the<br/>
advantages that it offers as a place of residence<br/>
and the opportunities for education of their<br/>
children, is Thomas Perkins, a retired farmer<br/>
from Mississippi. Mr. Perkins is the owner of<br/>
a plantation of 1,200 acres near Belzona, on the<br/>
Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. He<br/>
was employed for a number of years as a laborer<br/>
on the farm he now owns. At the death of the,<br/>
owner the heirs first rented it, and finally sold<br/>
it, to Perkins. He managed the property with<br/>
such thrift that he was able to pay $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">20,000 </span>for<br/>
it within <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>period of about six years. After he<br/>
had acquired the property he was induced to<br/>
come North on account of malaria, and<br/>
decided to settle in Wilberforce, where he could<br/>
conveniently give his children the benefit of an<br/>
education. Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Perkins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>now a man of<br/>
in: Tendent means. He has a fine house,<br/>
surrounded by wide lawns, and has been living<br/>
for some years past on the earnings of his<br/>
Mississippi plantation, which has <span style="color: #ff0000;">greatlyincreased </span>in value in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most successful farmers in the<br/>
neighborhood is J. Fowler, who owns 150<br/>
acres a few miles from the College. Fowler<br/>
and his wife walked over the mountains from<br/>
Virginia in 1860. He worked as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">farm-hand<br/>
</span>in the neighborhood of the College in the early<br/>
days, and has, as he says, "dug his fortune out<br/>
of the earth." He lives in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>old country<br/>
place, built of stone and bearing the date 1821<br/>
carved over the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Another farmer, who came to Wilberforce<br/>
community some years ago to educate his<br/>
children, is J. J. Turner, who, with his sons<br/>
<br/>
TOWN 9367<br/>
Arthur and Cyrus, conducts a dairy farm of<br/>
some 200 acres not far from the school. They<br/>
have a dairy herd of 250 cows and dispose of<br/>
their milk and butter in Springfield. Cyrus<br/>
Turner went to the State University at Columbus, after his graduation at Wilberforce, and<br/>
devoted himself for several years to the study<br/>
of agriculture. They have a fine home, which,<br/>
like most of the ether farms in this vicinity,<br/>
is connected with Xenia by telephone, and are<br/>
rapidly increasing a fortune that is already<br/>
considerable even for an Ohio farmer. They<br/>
sell about 500 pounds of butter fat a month in<br/>
Springfield, and secure two cents a pound<br/>
premium on each pound of their product.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cyrus </span>Turner received the highest mark at<br/>
college in the butter-making contest, and his<br/>
scientific knowledge, added to the practical<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>experience of his father, has contributed to the<br/>
<br/>
business success of the dairy farm.<br/>
<br/>
Linked as it is by its history with the past and<br/>
possessing for colored people a certain historic<br/>
interest as the first college established in this<br/>
country by Negroes, and for many years almost the only college exclusively for Negroes<br/>
north of Mason and Dixon's line, Wilberforce<br/>
occupies a position of importance in the<br/>
rapidly increasing population of the southern<br/>
section of Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
In the county adjoining it is Springfield,<br/>
the scene of the race riots of 1905. To <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>west is Dayton, the city in which the late Pauli<br/>
Laurence Dunbar, the Negro poet, was born<br/>
and raised. The constant, steady influx of<br/>
Negro immigration from the southern shore of<br/>
the Ohio River has brought to this whole region<br/>
of southern Ohio, under somewhat changed<br/>
conditions and with different motives, the same<br/>
struggle for the adjustment of the races that<br/>
one meets elsewhere. If in other parts of the<br/>
country Negroes'have been made to feel that<br/>
they were alien and intruders, here, where they<br/>
are firmly planted in the soil, they have been<br/>
able to feel at home.<br/>
<br/>
One of the subtle charms of Wilberforce is<br/>
that in this place a people that for almost<br/>
250 years has been almost without a tradition<br/>
of its own is beginning to make a history.<br/>
This is, no doubt, why so large a number of<br/>
the students who have gone out from here into<br/>
the world have returned to make their homes.<br/>
It is one of the things that make the Negro<br/>
communities that are growing up elsewhere<br/>
in the South and in the West interesting and<br/>
important.<br/>
