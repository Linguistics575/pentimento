<span>OUR RELATIONS WITH JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
composition of the nation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-interest </span>is<br/>
beginning to master self-respect. It is safe<br/>
to say that the Japanese Government has no<br/>
particular sympathy for the ardent youths who<br/>
leave Japan in order to better their condition;<br/>
the best practical education, including instruction in English, can be had at home.<br/>
Secondary schools are being multiplied daily.<br/>
The primary schools have a much larger average of attendance than such schools in America,<br/>
and include a scope of subjects and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">thor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>oughness of method hardly to be met with<br/>
anywhere else. A little incident at Iriye the<br/>
other day proves this clearly. A distinguished<br/>
Japanese (formerly president of the Tokyo University) offered to present the portrait of some<br/>
famous man or woman to the Iriye primary<br/>
school, on condition that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">children-343<br/>
</span>boys and girls-should themselves choose<br/>
the subject of the picture. These pupils,<br/>
between six and fourteen years of age, wrote<br/>
down their votes with the following results:<br/>
George Washington 69, Abraham Lincoln 53,<br/>
Admiral Togo 28. The fifth in popularity<br/>
was Benjamin Franklin, and the list included,<br/>
besides the names of some famous Japanese,<br/>
those of Florence Nightingale, Nelson, Bis<span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">march</span>, Napoleon, Galileo, Socrates, Columbus,<br/>
Roosevelt, Peter the Great, and Admiral<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Makharoff</span>. The list would be hard to beat<br/>
for excellence and breadth of sympathy.<br/>
<br/>
To return to the subject of the older students,<br/>
the knowledge of business forms can be acquired more <span style="color: #0000FF;">readily </span>in the United States and<br/>
pay for all kinds of work IS higher here than <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>Japan; hence the eager desire to get to America.<br/>
But the Japanese Government has no wish to<br/>
see thousands of <span style="color: #ff0000;">able- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bodied </span>young men leave<br/>
the country in order to grow rich. The true<br/>
wealth of Japan, its careful and extended culture of such valuable crops as tea, silk, and<br/>
rice, must suffer heavily unless some check be<br/>
put on emigration. The country needs its<br/>
young men; the enormous sum of five hundred million dollars has been invested in new<br/>
enterprises since the close of the war; and<br/>
there is no lack of steady lucrative employment<br/>
for qualified workers.<br/>
<br/>
THE SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL INCIDENT<br/>
<br/>
But these opportunities are not good enough<br/>
for the crude new element in Japan. Its eyes<br/>
are dazzled by visions of wealth; and since<br/>
money-making is the gift (how utterly the<br/>
bane they do not dream!) of America, the<br/>
<br/>
8921<br/>
<br/>
United States is still the goal of their desires.<br/>
Deep, therefore, will be the disappointment<br/>
inflicted by the new regulations arising from<br/>
the San Francisco school affair. Why the<br/>
California legislators should have put forward<br/>
such a pretext for the real exclusion bill which<br/>
they wanted, is something of a mystery. The<br/>
hardship of having to seat 69 Japanese children<br/>
in schools designed for a population of close<br/>
on 400,000, located on an area covering fortytwo square miles, was too infinitesimal to be<br/>
sympathized with. (The twenty-four <span style="color: #0000FF;">pupils<br/>
</span>who were over sixteen could have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">excluded </span>without appeal.) The seriousness with<br/>
which the plea was argued would be laughable<br/>
had not the gravest of issues, an infringement<br/>
of treaty rights, been involved. If one state<br/>
can refuse to be bound by a treaty ratified at<br/>
Washington, then all may do so, and no<br/>
future treaty will be worth the signature of a<br/>
foreign power.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese Government has taken this<br/>
point alone into consideration, and maintained<br/>
an attitude of calmness, trusting implicitly<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">President</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>decision. But the indication of <span style="color: #0000FF;">deep-seated </span>hostility must inflict another lasting wound on the confidence in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">America</span>'s professions of friendship. It had<br/>
been generally accepted as an axiom: "There<br/>
will never be any necessity to stand on the<br/>
defensive with this good neighbor." The<br/>
attitude of America during the last fifty years<br/>
had so far overcome the inborn scepticism of<br/>
the Japanese that they still believed in the<br/>
sincerity of the old sentimental cry, "Hands<br/>
across the sea." England had made most of<br/>
its early entrances into Japan in full armor,<br/>
scattering gunboats around as visiting cards;<br/>
Commodore Perry landed with a hymn-book<br/>
in his hand-the mother of a friend of mine<br/>
still remembers his cheery voice leading the<br/>
hymns of praise on the shore at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uragc-and</span>,<br/>
in spite of his curt and emphatic methods,<br/>
managed to create an impression of friendliness.<br/>
This was confirmed when peace descended on<br/>
the country after the struggles attending the<br/>
Restoration, and did not wear off till the autumn of 1905, when, in the full swing of the<br/>
Portsmouth negotiations, the American press<br/>
made its sudden right-about-face in favor of<br/>
Russia.<br/>
<br/>
That, I think, was the definite beginning of<br/>
the disillusionment. When the announcement<br/>
of the peace terms was received with public<br/>
protestations in Japan, the disillusionment<br/>
<br/>
