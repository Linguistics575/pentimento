</span>The worst "joints" are those which are run for<br/>
the benefit of white visitors and white patrons.<br/>
We pay too high a compliment to Chinese <span style="color: #0000FF;">intelligence </span>when we imagine that he can devise<br/>
anything more ingenious or complicated in the<br/>
way of vice than we. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">gamble</span>, of course,<br/>
but fan-tan is his only substitute for the racecourse and Wall Street. In the absence of<br/>
family life, he invents all sorts of ingenious<br/>
deviltry-just like New York or London clubmen. He smokes a good deal of opium and<br/>
probably shortens his life considerably by so<br/>
doing, but for some strange racial reason it<br/>
seldom makes the abject physical and moral<br/>
wreck of him that morphine does of the white<br/>
man. So far as I can learn, only about <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>per<br/>
cent. of the Chinese and scarcely 20 per cent.<br/>
of the Japanese "hit the pipe" at all. Of these<br/>
probably not more than a third do so to excess,<br/>
and even they "carry it" surprisingly well.<br/>
Unless thoroughly familiar with the symptoms,<br/>
you might see a Chinese every day and never<br/>
suspect that he was an opium habitu√©. Unlike<br/>
Mark Twain's Prospector who "never let his<br/>
business interfere with his drinking," the Chinese never lets his pipe interfere with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">work-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">until </span>the last few weeks, or months before<br/>
the end. He smokes only out of business<br/>
hours, or at the end of his week or <span style="color: #0000FF;">month</span>,<br/>
when he can get a day or two <span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>. it is not<br/>
<br/>
a handsome nor attractive vice, and the only<br/>
whites who are led to indulge in it are of the<br/>
lowest class.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the great majority of<br/>
Orientals either abstain from alcohol or take<br/>
it in strict moderation. There are a few saloons<br/>
in each Chinatown and they can generally be<br/>
picked out by the group of white men hanging<br/>
about the door. Of late, the Japanese is showing a little tendency to take kindly to whiskey<br/>
as a substitute for his native <span style="color: #0000FF;">sake </span>(rice brandy).<br/>
Occasionally he will even take enough to become boisterous and come in contact with the<br/>
police, which occasions much shaking of heads<br/>
and wagging of beards over "<span style="color: #ff0000;">steins</span>."<br/>
<br/>
Managers of canneries which have to handle<br/>
promptly and regularly every day of the season<br/>
large amounts of valuable raw material or have<br/>
it spoil on their hands, will tell you frankly that<br/>
they prefer Chinese or Japanese to white labor,<br/>
because they never get drunk or go on sprees at<br/>
critical periods and require no holidays or days<br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
In fine, while the Chinese and the Japanese<br/>
have their defects, and the Coast has no desire<br/>
to "gush" over them or urge them to become<br/>
citizens, we regard them as a valuable <span style="color: #0000FF;">commercial </span>factor, and as a race as free from vice or<br/>
other drawbacks as can reasonably be expected<br/>
of mortals.<br/>

EXPLORING THE GUNNISON <span style="color: #0000FF;">CAN'ON<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ITHIN </span>the mountain-locked Uncompahgre Valley, described on page<br/>
9322 of this number by Mr. Arthur W.<br/>
Page, lie <span style="color: #ff0000;">2OO,00O </span>acres of rich land fed by<br/>
a scanty stream. Taking the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gambler</span>'s chance,<br/>
five had homesteaded the desert wastes where<br/>
only one might irrigate his holding. Longingly<br/>
they cast their eyes to the eastward, where the<br/>
Gunnison River flows along the bottom of a<br/>
narrow canon, 3,000 feet below the surface of<br/>
the mesa and between walls of precipitous rock.<br/>
Engineers glanced at the topography and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronounced </span>the situation hopeless.<br/>
<br/>
Among the settlers was a dreamy Frenchman<br/>
-Lauzon by name-who held on to his barren<br/>
forty acres. He became convinced that the<br/>
Gunnison might be tapped by a tunnel<br/>
and infected his fellow-settlers with his belief.<br/>
<br/>
They joined their voices to his and presently<br/>
the cry of the desert-dwellers was heard in<br/>
Washington. A chief engineer, whose bureau<br/>
is devoted to the' performance of benevolent<br/>
miracles, sent this telegram to the Denver office<br/>
of the Reclamation Service:<br/>
<br/>
"Advise me if it is possible to divert Gunnison<br/>
to Uncompahgre Valley by tunnel under<br/>
Vernal Mesa."<br/>
<br/>
Mr. A. L. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fellows</span>, the district engineer, read<br/>
it and silently pushed it across the table to<br/>
Mr. W. W. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Terrence</span>, his aide.<br/>
<br/>
"Nasty job for somebody," said the assistant.<br/>
<br/>
"That's me," said Mr. Fellows. "I shall<br/>
need a <span style="color: #ff0000;">_..-.-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>"That's me," replied Mr. Terrence.<br/>
<br/>
The feasibility of a tunnel can be determined<br/>
only after locating both ends of it. In this<br/>
case one end must necessarily be in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">caiion<br/>
