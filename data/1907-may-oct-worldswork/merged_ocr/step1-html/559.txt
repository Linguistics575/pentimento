<span>TAFT: A <span style="color: #0000FF;">CAREER<br/>
<br/>
</span>The defeated man was somehow convinced<br/>
that he was in the wrong. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">ability </span>to<br/>
make even the losers <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfied </span>is extraordinary<br/>
evidence, not only of the Judge's wonderful<br/>
kindliness, but of the invariable faith in his<br/>
discernment and integrity.<br/>
<br/>
But Judge Taft made lawyers "toe the<br/>
mark." An attorney <span style="color: #0000FF;">starting </span>to say something<br/>
<br/>
eral of the state, and ex-President Harrison,<br/>
who had made him judge, pleaded for more<br/>
time. But Judge Taft could not see why it<br/>
should be granted and the case was tried at<br/>
once. Thus he cleaned up the dockets and<br/>
put new life into Federal court practice.<br/>
<br/>
His direct way of hitting the nail on the<br/>
head <span style="color: #0000FF;">enabled </span>him to be an efficient workman.<br/>

"Stop!" said Taft, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span>can't hear any of that."<br/>
He would not let the <span style="color: #0000FF;">counsel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wrangle </span>nor<br/>
