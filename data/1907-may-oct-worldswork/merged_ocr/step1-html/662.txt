<span style="color: #ff0000;">esting </span>problems. The tower alone will weigh<br/>
more than 18,000 tons. This great weight<br/>
must be concentrated upon an area 65 feet<br/>
square, with 90 feet of mud and wet sand<br/>
between the surface and bed-rock. The contractor for the foundation must not only guarantee the new building against settling or<br/>
leaning for generations to come, but he is also<br/>
held responsible for any damage done to <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighboring </span>buildings during the course of construe<br/>
tion. The foundations must rest on bed-rock.<br/>
<br/>
The ground in this part of New York City<br/>
is saturated with water to such an extent as to<br/>
be fluid; hence the old method of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">cellardigging</span>" is impossible. Every building in<br/>
the vicinity would begin to settle, and would<br/>
eventually collapse. The Singer Building on<br/>
its present location would have been an utter<br/>
impossibility a dozen years ago, before the<br/>
development of the pneumatic caisson process<br/>
of foundation <span style="color: #ff0000;">building. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>The pneumatic caisson is a huge timber box,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">open </span>at the bottom and with a small entrance<br/>
hole in the top. It is made air and water-tight<br/>
and is filled with compressed air, which is<br/>
prevented from escaping from the entrance by<br/>
two successive trap-doors, a patented device<br/>
known as the "air-lock." This caisson, containing workmen with picks and shovels, sinks<br/>
lower and lower through the wet soil as the<br/>
forty-five pounds of compressed air crowds the<br/>
water away from under it and the men hoist<br/>
the solid material to the top through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">air-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lock</span>. As the men excavate they stand on<br/>
comparatively dry earth, yet the soil scarcely<br/>
two feet below them is full of quick-sand or<br/>
wet mud. With the old-time method, tons of<br/>
water and slime would have to be pumped out<br/>
and hoisted, making of the foundation hole<br/>
often a mere cess-pool.<br/>
<br/>
As the caisson sinks still lower, it becomes<br/>
necessary to attach to the entrance hole a steel<br/>
shaft reaching up to the street level so that the<br/>
workmen, in frequent changes of shift, can<br/>
relieve each other of the strain due to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">compressed </span>air. A dozen of these "sand-hogs"<br/>
work by electric light in each <span style="color: #0000FF;">caisson-stripped<br/>
</span>to the waist, even in the dead of winter, for the<br/>
earth is not susceptible to outside temperature<br/>
changes at such depth. Meanwhile, the roof<br/>
of the caisson is being covered with layer after<br/>
layer of concrete. Each layer is exactly the<br/>
same size as the caisson and each hardens<br/>
in the open air before it gradually sinks, pressing<br/>
the wooden box deeper into the ground, New<br/>
<br/>
A BUILDING FORTY-SEVEN STORIES HIGH<br/>
<br/>
lengths of the steel entrance shaft are added for<br/>
the laborers, now eighty feet below the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sidewalk</span>. These men climb up and down a hatchway surrounded on all sides by the solid concrete upon which later the building is to rest.<br/>
Bucket after bucket of <span style="color: #ff0000;">d√©bris </span>is hoisted up<br/>
through this hatch-way. One contains a<br/>
piece of antique Dutch ware; another brings up<br/>
old Indian relics. Here the superintendent<br/>
found a piece of wood that had been undisturbed since lower Manhattan was under<br/>
the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly the descending pier of concrete sinks<br/>
nearer its ultimate resting-place on the bedrock. This pier, solid save for the entrance<br/>
shaft down its centre, through which the men<br/>
and materials pass, begins to penetrate the<br/>
few feet of "hard-pan," which lies just above<br/>
its final <span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-place</span>. Now a geological<br/>
expert is sent for; he descends the narrow<br/>
shaft to determine if the proper bed-rock has<br/>
been reached.<br/>
<br/>
If the rock stands inspection, every vestige<br/>
of earth is hoisted to the outside air, fresh concrete is lowered into the shaft and laid and<br/>
tamped carefully on the rock. The entire<br/>
caisson is then filled with concrete; the timber<br/>
roof is torn out and that space filled also, the<br/>
workmen retreating up the shaft as more and<br/>
more concrete is laid and tamped in the former<br/>
passage-way. The result is a solid concrete<br/>
pier, its lower end resting on bed-rock and its<br/>
upper end reaching up ninety feet to receive<br/>
the load of the great steel column for which it<br/>
was especially designed. There are twenty<br/>
of these piers under the tower alone, each being<br/>
approximately ten feet thick and twenty feet<br/>
wide. The building will be bolted down<br/>
with forty huge steel bolts, each six inches in<br/>
diameter. This precaution is sufficient to hold<br/>
up the building against a hurricane exerting<br/>
a pressure of thirty pounds per square foot.<br/>
No wind has ever been known to exert more<br/>
than ten pounds pressure per square foot. The<br/>
weight of the tower alone is sufficient to hold<br/>
against any gale reasonably to be expected. The<br/>
forty steel bolts are imbedded in the concrete<br/>
foundations to a depth of fifty feet below the<br/>
lower basement floor. Concrete grips any<br/>
steel that it may surround with a tenacity that<br/>
in some cases is more than ample to break the<br/>
steel under strain before it could be dislodged<br/>
by the pull. Concrete will also protect the<br/>
steel from the action of water and of the<br/>
atmosphere<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The upper part of each bolt is<br/>
