<span>BIRMINGHAM TWENTY YEARS AGO<br/>
<br/>
The city was founded in <span style="color: #0000FF;">tap </span>and its first iron furnace was built<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1870</span>. The opposite page shows a scene now typical<br/>
<br/>
hopeless ignorance of fundamental economic<br/>
forces; and you would often hear allusions. to<br/>
the North as if it were a foreign country and a<br/>
country where men somehow prospered at the<br/>
expense of the South. I do <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>recall bitterness in this undertone of conversation so much<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">loneliness-an </span>isolation, and a sense of<br/>
despair. The South somehow seemed doomed<br/>
to poverty for a long time to come.<br/>
<br/>
After two months of such observation, in<br/>
spite of the pleasant personal experiences that<br/>
I had had, when I went back to Boston I<br/>
wrote nothing for publication. I read over<br/>
my <span style="color: #0000FF;">notebooks </span>and concluded that if I undertook to describe what I had <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen-and </span>heard<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">JOURNEY </span>THROUGH <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
the dominant note would be a note of <span style="color: #0000FF;">depression</span>, and I did <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>see how such a report would<br/>
be of any value to anybody. It surely would<br/>
not cheer the Southern readers of the magazine,<br/>
and I was afraid that it would only deepen<br/>
certain misapprehensions that some Northern<br/>
readers already had of the Southern people<br/>
and of Southern conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>have time and again been in most of the<br/>
Southern States during the intervening ten<br/>
years, but I had not, until this year, made a<br/>
systematic journey to them all, for the purpose<br/>
of definite observation. But now I have just<br/>
gone over the same journey, taking two months<br/>
and a half to make it, and I have visited nearly<br/>
all the places that I visited ten years ago, and<br/>
a good many more. Everything is different.<br/>
The larger cities have become enormously<br/>
larger and more active, and their tone, if you<br/>
can speak of the tone of cities, is wholly <span style="color: #0000FF;">different</span>. The street scenes, the street conversations, the things that you see by going up<br/>
and down through the business thoroughfares<br/>
now are the same as you will see and hear in<br/>
active business cities anywhere else in the<br/>
world. There is nothing, except, perhaps,<br/>
the presence of the Negro, to indicate whether<br/>
you are in the South, or in the West, or in<br/>
the North. The activities and methods of<br/>
all sections are becoming very much alike<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
