litigant or possible litigant. There was a<br/>
Captain Stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.friend</span>, connected with a<br/>
telephone company. Captain Stone was requested to render his bill for <span style="color: #0000FF;">judge </span>Taft's<br/>

the Judge sent for it. He added a message<br/>
that if it was not forthcoming, he would be<br/>
compelled to have the'phone taken out of his<br/>
house. His attitude was the same toward<br/>
<br/>
railroad passes. He never rode free except<br/>
on his own receivership roads.<br/>
