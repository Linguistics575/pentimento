It is the nearest Gulf port to the Panama<br/>
Canal. It has 16 public schools (8 for white<br/>
and 8 for colored) for a population of 25,000; It<br/>
has good railroad facilities; and the new energy<br/>
and foresight and ambition of the Southern<br/>
town-builders of to-day. It is one of the seaports for a wide inland territory, extending<br/>

Inland Florida, too, has well-kept, prosperous<br/>
towns. Orlando is a good example. In it and<br/>
all round about it-in this beautiful lake<br/>
country-many persons spend pleasant, quiet<br/>
winters; and there are prosperous orange and<br/>
grape-fruit groves; and at Sanford are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">famous </span>celery farms, already referred to<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY<br/>
<br/>
HE lower Mississippi Valley has under<br/>
gone less radical change than any other<br/>
great section of the South. But it, too, has<br/>
felt the touch of prosperity. Cotton culture<br/>
has always been, and is yet, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">industry<br/>
</span>of this rich region and it probably always will<br/>
be; but there are careful students of agriculture<br/>
who expect a very large acreage to be given to<br/>
corn, when more of the lands have been drained.<br/>
These lowlands have two great sources of profit;<br/>
first, their timber, in some places long-leaf<br/>
pine and in other regions hardwoods. Since<br/>
the recent rapid increase in the price of lumber, these forests have been opened with great<br/>
rapidity and the lumber trade at every important shipping port has its millionaires.<br/>
The hardwoods in Tennessee and Arkansas,<br/>
for example, are also being cut with great<br/>
rapidity. One great source of income at<br/>
Memphis and at Nashville is from the sale of<br/>
hardwoods. The gum tree, for instance, was,<br/>
until a few years ago a despised growth of the<br/>
swamps; now it is not only sold throughout<br/>
the United States, but large quantities of it are<br/>
exported; and for interior finishes it takes so<br/>
fine a polish that in some cases it is sold as<br/>
mahogany.<br/>
<br/>
For many years to come the lumber industry<br/>
of this region will be an important business.<br/>
It would be an important business for all time<br/>
to come if the forests were so cut as to make<br/>
their yield perpetual.<br/>
<br/>
The cotton-growing of this area has gradually increased in acreage in the most progressive communities. The methods employed<br/>
are more skilful than they used to be and, of<br/>
course, the profit has become greater as the<br/>
price of cotton has risen. This region, therefore, has a new era in its prosperity. The one<br/>
great drawback to the extension of cotton culture is the lack of labor, and it is to this region<br/>
<br/>
that Italians are gradually coming, and more<br/>
will come by way of Louisiana.<br/>
<br/>
The prosperity that comes from lumber and<br/>
cotton has shown itself here in the building up<br/>
of towns and cities such as Memphis, which is<br/>
having a most remarkable commercial development, and Jackson, Miss., which ten years ago<br/>
was a sleepy capital of an undeveloped commonwealth, and which has now completely rebuilt<br/>
itself and is a small city of extraordinary growth<br/>
in trade and in population. Vicksburg, Shreveport, Meridian, and the shipping town which<br/>
has grown up at Gulfport are other<br/>
examples. At Gulfport, ships are loaded with<br/>
lumber from Mississippi which sail to almost<br/>
every port in the world. Long stretches of the<br/>
Gulf coast are now built up as resorts for<br/>
Northern people in winter and for Southern<br/>
people from cities in summer, and a considerable region here is becoming an interesting<br/>
seashore playground.<br/>
<br/>
Very great changes will come within a<br/>
generation in these Mississippi Valley lands.<br/>
As soon as the world in general finds out that<br/>
the culture of the cotton plant in this rich soil<br/>
is perhaps the most profitable agriculture,<br/>
certainly of a great staple, that can be carried<br/>
on anywhere in our continental area; and, as<br/>
soon as the additional fact is fully appreciated<br/>
that good drainage will make this region a<br/>
perfectly healthful place for white men to live<br/>
in, it must come to pass that a vast population<br/>
will go there. When a vast population goes<br/>
there and better methods of cotton culture<br/>
become general, the lower Mississippi Valley<br/>
will maintain an even denser population than<br/>
the states of the upper Mississippi Valley;<br/>
and there are good reasons why they should<br/>
be as prosperous as their Northern neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Here we come face to face with interesting<br/>
problems of several kinds. One is the problem<br/>
