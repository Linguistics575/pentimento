<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9058 </span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">MARCH<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9058<br/>
</span>arbitration held at Lake Mohonk, the serious<br/>
discussion-if not of disarmament, at least of<br/>
limiting armaments-by responsible men in<br/>
many of the great Governments, and, most of<br/>
all, the successful test of the Hague Tribunal<br/>
have put the whole subject in men's minds in<br/>
a new way. The public opinion of the world<br/>
is taking seriously the subject of the substitution<br/>
of arbitration for war; and this is an incalculable step forward. The present Conference<br/>
will consider seriously the making of the Hague<br/>
Court a judicial tribunal instead of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">semidiplomatic </span>body; and the automatic assembly<br/>
of the Conference hereafter, so that there may<br/>
always be a sort of High Court of the nations<br/>
and a regular periodical meeting of their<br/>
representatives. The present <span style="color: #0000FF;">Conference-most </span>of all-has the serious attention <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span>public opinion of the whole world.<br/>
<br/>
CANADA'S DESTINY<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OTHING </span>that has arisen from the<br/>
Colonial Conference in Great Britain is<br/>
more profoundly interesting than the outburst of<br/>
imperial loyalty in Canada. Every word, trite<br/>
or heart-felt, that was uttered by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">premiers </span>to bring closer together the scattered<br/>
units of the Empire seems to have awakened<br/>
genuine echoes in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Is Canada drifting toward rather than away<br/>
from the mother country? Americans, counting the thousands that yearly emigrate to the<br/>
North, figuring carefully and statistically the<br/>
commercial ties that yearly strengthen between<br/>
Canada and the United States, have been wont<br/>
to take it for granted that some day Canada<br/>
will be at least a second American republic,<br/>
if not a part of our own republic. Yet to-day,<br/>
the imperial note is stronger in Canada than<br/>
it was ten years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Nor does the native-born American population of the Canadian Northwest seem to alter<br/>
the situation greatly. For every American,<br/>
the Dominion records tell us, who goes across<br/>
the border, two real Britons from the old<br/>
country come in to keep the balance true.<br/>
<br/>
In Ontario and Quebec, the Canadian<br/>
traditions are kept as sacred as they <span style="color: #0000FF;">ever </span>were.<br/>
Toronto is in no respects an American city,<br/>
either in its business or its social life.<br/>
<br/>
Things move slowly, but the growth looks<br/>
healthy. Certainly, the future of Canada<br/>
gives, if anything, less worry to the Canadians<br/>
than it gives to us. They are confident, and,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">apparently</span>, quite satisfied with their status.<br/>
<br/>
A REPORT THAT HAS LIFE IN IT<br/>
<br/>
IF GLADSTONE made the figures of a<br/>
budget read like a romance, a county<br/>
public school superintendent in Illinois has<br/>
achieved as remarkable a victory over a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sub</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ject usually even more dull than figures-he<br/>
has made a school report a human document<br/>
of delightful as well as stimulating reading.<br/>
The county is Winnebago County, and the<br/>
superintendent is Mr. O. J. Kern.<br/>
<br/>
His <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>phrase strikes a note that runs<br/>
throughout, "People of Winnebago County:"<br/>
no formal address, but a strenuous sort of<br/>
greeting.<br/>
<br/>
"The schools belong to the people and the people can<br/>
have what they want. Country people can have<br/>
better schools when they spend more money on them and<br/>
spend it in a better way. It is said that the farmers cannot<br/>
get their children to the central school. The farmers of<br/>
Winnebago County never fail to get their milk to the<br/>
central factory, if it takes four horses...<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
truth that the money question is fundamental in making<br/>
better country schools might as well be faced first as last.<br/>
It is the duty of the county superintendent to ascertain<br/>
what is being done out on the front line of county school<br/>
improvement all over the United States. It is his duty to<br/>
present these facts to the consideration of his people. It<br/>
is for the people to act. The people can have better schools<br/>
if they want them."<br/>
<br/>
Then follow reports from every school <span style="color: #0000FF;">district-an </span>average of three lines of type to a<br/>
school, in answer to three terse questions:<br/>
<br/>
"What were net proceeds of school social and how was<br/>
money <span style="color: #0000FF;">expended</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>"What improvement on school grounds in spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1906</span>?<br/>
<br/>
"What attempt at a school garden?"<br/>
<br/>
The answers are preceded by this comment:<br/>
"Where no reply is given nothing was done.<br/>
This does not necessarily imply that there was<br/>
no need of doing anything."<br/>
<br/>
Photographs of school grounds, well kept<br/>
and ill, are printed beside the names of the<br/>
teachers and directors who deserve the credit<br/>
or the censure for their condition. The<br/>
"deadly parallel" is used, as in the argument<br/>
for more beautiful school yards. A page<br/>
of pictures of lovely country scenes in Winnebago County carries this comment: "Children<br/>
see these on their way to school; why do not<br/>
the school grounds reflect some of this beauty? "<br/>
Beside two pictures of farmers' homes set <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>groves of trees the legend reads, "Do the<br/>
owners of these homes believe in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">educational </span>value of trees? How about the school<br/>
grounds in their respective districts?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
