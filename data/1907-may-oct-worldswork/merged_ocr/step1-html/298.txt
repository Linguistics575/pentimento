continent. A generation may pass-then no<br/>
more of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Waganda</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there along the Uganda Railway<br/>
'are white settlements, but for the greater part<br/>
the country is peopled as it was twenty years<br/>
ago. The only difference is that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">slaveraids </span>are no more; but in their place is the<br/>
white trader, building up his little commercial<br/>
world as well as he may, or as badly as he<br/>
sometimes does. Only a year or so ago a<br/>
huge rhinoceros made things interesting by a<br/>
headlong charge upon the locomotive, but<br/>
now-a-days the wilder game is driven far back<br/>
from the railroad. The country has a long<br/>
way to go before it is abreast of Cape Colony,<br/>
but progress is sure. The Pax Britannica<br/>
rests upon these colonies in Eastern Africa.<br/>
<br/>
IN THE NORTH OF AFRICA<br/>
<br/>
The progress of Egypt in recent times is<br/>
told elsewhere in the story of Lord Cromer. It<br/>
is a marvelous story, this regeneration of the<br/>
land that Pharaoh ruled. Something of magic<br/>
there is in it, of the same magic that ruled<br/>
India, that taught the Maori in one short<br/>
generation how to make to himself a law, that<br/>
made of the Australian bushman a herdsman<br/>
of tame cattle, that put into the hand of the<br/>
Zulu a plow-handle to take the place of an<br/>
assegai. The Dervish of to-day has learned<br/>
to handle the throttle of an American-built<br/>
locomotive instead of the huge two-handed<br/>
sword he swung ten years ago. It is a symbol<br/>
of the New Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in Africa the light burns dimly.<br/>
Algiers and Morocco, the twin <span style="color: #0000FF;">degenerate</span>, are<br/>
drunk and lustful as of yore. Mr. Eugene<br/>
Aubin's picture of Abdul Abd-el-Aziz of<br/>
Morocco as a balloonist, motorist, and polo<br/>
player fails to waken enthusiasm over the prospects of speedy civilization and enlightenment in<br/>
these two northern countries. Abyssinia is far<br/>
more promising. The fact appears to be that<br/>
the ruling classes of Morocco, in particular,<br/>
have turned their backs upon the law. A melancholy picture of Morocco is drawn by Asaad<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalarji </span>Karam, himself a trader in Morocco<br/>
and thoroughly grounded in the subject:<br/>
<br/>
"And in regard to the bank (proposed by the Algeciras<br/>
Conference as a measure of betterment). The Moors<br/>
have not the least comprehension of the workings of a bank,<br/>
and, moreover, their religion forbids them to deposit their<br/>
money in one. Moors who have money bank it in the<br/>
ground. Many of them die without disclosing to anyone<br/>
else their place of deposit. No Moor dares to appear<br/>

THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
rich for fear of being cast into prison and despoiled by the<br/>
officials of his government, or for fear of assassination at<br/>
the hand of other robbers. The Government has no<br/>
public works, and the mass of the people have no arts and<br/>
trades."<br/>
<br/>
That phrase "other <span style="color: #0000FF;">robbers</span>" -how eloquent it<br/>
is of official oppression and national decadence!<br/>
<br/>
WONDERS IN SOUTH AMERICA<br/>
<br/>
Hardly less astonishing than the progress of<br/>
Africa is the progress of South America. We<br/>
have heard for a long time of Buenos Aires<br/>
and Montevideo. In our school days, we<br/>
heard of them as big South American towns,<br/>
no more. To-day, Buenos Aires is nearly<br/>
twice as big as Boston, and perhaps is more<br/>
important in the world at large. Over a million people live within its boundaries. Its<br/>
parks, its avenues, its business streets, its<br/>
newspapers, libraries, and churches compare<br/>
favorably with the best of Philadelphia. Its<br/>
docks are as the docks of Liverpool. In<br/>
lighting, sewerage, water supply, the critics say<br/>
that it is beyond the best equipped city on this<br/>
continent, comparable only to Berlin among the<br/>
great cities. It is, perhaps, better policed,<br/>
more law-abiding, more sober, and cleaner<br/>
than any American city. Only to-day it has<br/>
come to electric traction; and now, learning by<br/>
our example, it plans two great subways for its<br/>
urban traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Montevideo is little behind it--a city as<br/>
big as Detroit and humming with <span style="color: #ff0000;">worldcommerce</span>! Yesterday it seemed but an outland<br/>
village, steeped in a Latin stupor. To-day<br/>
it plays New Orleans to Buenos Aires' St.<br/>
Louis, for it lies at the mouth of a river greater<br/>
than the Mississippi, with the bigger city<br/>
higher up the stream. Big steamships ply<br/>
between the two, and thence a thousand miles<br/>
up into the very heart of the continent, to little<br/>
Paraguay. Men grow to be millionaires, to<br/>
live in marble palaces on broad and beautiful<br/>
avenues. Their sons go through the schools,<br/>
graduate from the universities, go out into the<br/>
world equipped. They study statecraft as a<br/>
science, loving it. Therefore, in government,<br/>
control, and the spirit of law, they are far<br/>
ahead of us, who learn our law by breaking it.<br/>
<br/>
We speak of South America as a land of<br/>
earthquakes and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrection</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>It is true<br/>
enough. Yet, in spite of it, and in spite of the<br/>
Latin temper, South America is holding its<br/>
own in the world. Was it not Walpole who<br/>
described a mythical visitor from Lima who<br/>
<br/>
