<br/>
to the state Senate the removal of Otto Kelsey,<br/>
Superintendent of Insurance, for no other<br/>
reason than that Mr. Kelsey had not <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiently<br/>
</span>performed his official duties. Mr. Kelsey was<br/>
one of the Wadsworth lieutenants. Congressman Wadsworth was the boss of Livingston<br/>
County. Mr. Kelsey was for nine years the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assemblyman.then </span>Deputy Comptroller, Comptroller, and Superintendent of Insurance. His<br/>
seat in the assembly is now filled by James W.<br/>
Wadsworth, Jr., the present speaker. His<br/>
great political virtue was that he always<br/>
did what he was told. When Governor<br/>
Hughes asked for his resignation, he told<br/>
the Governor that. if any changes were<br/>
desired in the Insurance Department he<br/>
would be only too glad to oblige. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor </span>replied that all he wanted was a superintendent who would run his department properly. This was a startling novelty to Mr.<br/>
Kelsey. It is many years since the real head<br/>
of the Insurance Department has condescended<br/>
to go on the state's pay-roll as Superintendent<br/>
of Insurance. As Mr. Kelsey explained, last<br/>
year Governor Higgins managed the Insurance<br/>
Department. Before that, Chairman Odell, of<br/>
the Republican state committee was the head<br/>
of the Department. Before that, the presidents<br/>
<br/>
8915<br/>
<br/>
of the "Big-Three" New York companies<br/>
had managed the Department through their<br/>
legal and lobby bureaus. When Mr. Kelsey<br/>
expressed his willingness to let Governor<br/>
Hughes run the Department, he thought he had<br/>
done all he could do.<br/>
<br/>
MR. HUGHES AND THE FUTURE<br/>
<br/>
This is only a sample of the difference in the<br/>
way Governor Hughes and the state politician<br/>
regard public office. Naturally, the state<br/>
politicians are combined against him. They<br/>
do not oppose his recommendations but they<br/>
delay action. They avoid test votes. The first<br/>
three months of the session, they did nothing.<br/>
They will not carry the recommendations of<br/>
his message nor his executive policy into effect<br/>
until they are compelled by public opinion,<br/>
which may not become effective <span style="color: #0000FF;">unless </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Governor calls a special session.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, Governor Hughes's ambition has developed with the combat. If the<br/>
public support which he is receiving from the<br/>
people of New York should prevail over the<br/>
resistant policy of the professional politicians,<br/>
he believes that he will be the most available<br/>
man for promotion to the vacancy caused by<br/>
President Roosevelt's refusal to run again.<br/>

STUDENT LIFE AT HAMPTON INSTITUTE<br/>

<br/>
ENTERED Hampton Institute in Octo<br/>
I her, 1885. Hampton was the most<br/>
beautiful place I had ever seen. I<br/>
came up through the school farm, with its acres<br/>
of vegetables, and passed the beautiful National<br/>
Cemetery where stood 4,000 white marble<br/>
headstones marking the final resting-place of<br/>
Confederate as well as of Union <span style="color: #0000FF;">soldiers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">there </span>are now over six thousand. As I saw the<br/>
beautiful grounds of the school, the water-front,<br/>
the neat, well-kept buildings and lawns, it all<br/>
seemed like fairyland to me. A few mischievous boys called out "fresh fish" <span style="color: #ff0000;">-and </span>were inclined to <span style="color: #ff0000;">make-fun </span>of my very small trunk,<br/>
<br/>
which was entirely out of proportion to the<br/>
size of its awkward owner.<br/>
<br/>
I at once presented myself to the Commandant, George L. Curtis, now a clergyman<br/>
in Bloomfield, N. J. When given my entrance<br/>
examination shortly thereafter, I failed utterly<br/>
to pass, though the examination had seemed<br/>
easy. Iwas very much upset and when I<br/>
handed Mr. Curtis the note announcing my<br/>
failure, he seemed disappointed and expressed<br/>
as much to me. I remember his handing the<br/>
note to Mr. Briggs, the business agent, and<br/>
their whispering. I overheard Mr. Briggs,<br/>
whom I had all this time taken for General<br/>
