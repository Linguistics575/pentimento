<br/>
</span>the clatter of tongues, and the general pandemonium begins again, to go on without<br/>
cessation until the closing gong brings relief.<br/>
<br/>
Then come a rush for surface cars, elevated<br/>
stations or subways, and a ride home in a car<br/>
that is packed to suffocation, hanging to a strap<br/>
and being pushed and squeezed and shoved<br/>
about by a throng of fellow passengers.<br/>
<br/>
When she reaches her abiding place there<br/>
is barely time to wash hands and face and tidy<br/>
up disordered hair before dinner. Then when<br/>
dinner is over there is a skirt to clean, shoes to<br/>
brush, rubbers to wash, to-morrow<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>clothes<br/>
to be laid out and put in order-and then it<br/>
is time for bed.<br/>
<br/>
There is no time for pleasure in her life, no<br/>
time for the softer, sweeter, tenderer things<br/>
of womanhood. It is a life stripped of humanity, robbed of most that makes life beautiful,<br/>
and spent in one ceaseless, perpetual <span style="color: #ff0000;">grindsimply </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>live.<br/>
<br/>
Is it any wonder that some of the weaker<br/>
spirits sometimes weary of the monotony and<br/>
go the devious path that leads to <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>and ruin?<br/>
Is it any wonder that, starved for the pleasures<br/>
and amusements that are the right of youth,<br/>
they seek the pernicious Saturday night dances,<br/>
where they are sure to find light and life,<br/>
merriment and admiration? And yet it is a<br/>
<br/>
fact that the proportion of <span style="color: #ff0000;">saleswomen </span>that<br/>
frequent public dances is comparatively<br/>
small. Close observation proves that most<br/>
shop-girls are serious, self-respecting young<br/>
women, who are obliged to earn their own<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">iiving </span>and are working hard to rise in their<br/>
work, or to get out of it into something<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
Among <span style="color: #ff0000;">saleswomen </span>in New York City, the<br/>
writer knows one girl who is studying law and<br/>
hopes to be admitted to the bar next fall, one<br/>
girl who is studying medicine, one who is taking<br/>
a course in English at night, expecting in<br/>
another year or two to enter the field of literature, one who works well into the wee sma'<br/>
hours of morning studying Latin and German,<br/>
hoping to teach in a few months, and one who<br/>
spends all her evenings at a business college,<br/>
fitting herself to enter an office.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of the fact that the shop-girl has<br/>
little time, little strength, and little opportunity<br/>
for the development of her higher self, there<br/>
are those who are getting, and will continue to<br/>
get, a good deal out of life. There are many<br/>
among them, who, in spite of the difficulties<br/>
in the way of courtship, will become loved<br/>
wives and mothers, and there are many who<br/>
will become prosperous business women, and<br/>
do a creditable share in the world's work.<br/>

<br/>
ISS PRISCILLA PETERKIN had<br/>
<br/>
Nf given a week-end entertainment to a<br/>
<br/>
few friends, including an analytical<br/>
<br/>
chemist from Boston. Here is an abstract<br/>
from his diary:<br/>
<br/>
"We had a savory breakfast of home-made<br/>
sausage and buckwheat cakes. The coffee,<br/>
bought'ground,' had a fair degree of coffee<br/>
mixed with the chicory, peas, and cereal.<br/>
There was enough hog meat in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pure'homemade</span>' sausage to give a certain pork flavor and<br/>
about one grain of benzoic acid in each pate.<br/>
I also detected saltpetre, which had been used<br/>
to freshen up the meat. Whether corn or<br/>
<br/>
potato starch or stale biscuit had been used as<br/>
a'filler,' I had to leave in doubt.<br/>
<br/>
"The buckwheat cakes looked nice and<br/>
brown, from their generous mixture with rye<br/>
and caramel. The baking powder had too<br/>
much alum, but it did its work-it raised the<br/>
cakes; the oleomargarine that came from the<br/>
grocer as'pure butter' looked golden rich, and<br/>
added one more grain of benzoic acid to my<br/>
portion. The pure maple syrup, with some<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">go </span>per cent. of'golden drip' (commercial<br/>
glucose) upon the hot cakes, really tasted<br/>
more like maple than some I have had in the<br/>
Canadian maple camps. But there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
