<br/>
bill to prevent this practice of "shanghaiing"<br/>
became a law at the last session of Congress.<br/>
<br/>
A "Sailor's Log Book" was prepared by Mr.<br/>
Richard D. Currier, in charge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seamen's<br/>
</span>Branch. This gives in condensed form the<br/>
laws pertaining to sailors and their rights on<br/>
the high <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>The edition of 5,000 copies was<br/>
quickly distributed, and the results of its<br/>
publication have already appeared in the better<br/>
understanding by the seafarers of their rights<br/>
against boarding-house keepers and the various<br/>
"crimps" who molest them on shore. Mr.<br/>
Currier cites two instances as typical of the use<br/>
of this "Log":<br/>
<br/>
"One sailor secured a copy of the pamphlet in a reading<br/>
room in New York and learned through reading the book<br/>
of a certain right which he had, but had never known before.<br/>
Relying upon the statement in the'Log' as correct, he<br/>
made a trip to Baltimore to enforce his newly discovered<br/>
right against a vessel upon which he had just been<br/>
employed. The outcome of his trip was <span style="color: #0000FF;">entirely </span>successful.<br/>
Perhaps the greatest compliment paid the book was that<br/>
given by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">seaman</span>'s society which devotes much time to<br/>
distributing libraries on vessels. This society began sending out a copy to each library. Soon a great protest was<br/>
<br/>
THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
raised on the part of the captains, who complained bitterly<br/>
about the book, because they said that it was teaching the<br/>
sailors too much law. One captain went so far as to<br/>
threaten to throw a whole library overboard unless the<br/>
pamphlet was removed. Rather than <span style="color: #0000FF;">Injure </span>the usefulness<br/>
of the libraries in general, the society decided to discontinue the use of the'Sailor's Log.' Although praise of a<br/>
negative character, it is very gratifying to the Seamen's<br/>
Branch."<br/>
<br/>
The New York Society issued a similar book<br/>
for the use of servants.<br/>
<br/>
All of the societies are supported mainly by<br/>
voluntary contributions. At a performance at<br/>
the Metropolitan Opera House for the benefit<br/>
of the New York Society, Mark Twain said:<br/>
<br/>
"There is something so eloquent about those plain,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unadorned </span>statistics and the quoted incidents that it would<br/>
not be in human nature <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>either the highest or the lowest<br/>
in the land to read them and not be strongly moved to<br/>
desire the privilege of sharing in the Society's generous<br/>
crusade in the behalf of the oppressed and friendless."<br/>
<br/>
It is not charity; it has no pauperizing effects.<br/>
It is merely providing that all men shall have<br/>
justice and "a square deal."<br/>

<br/>
HOW THE LAST <span style="color: #0000FF;">STRONGHOLDS </span>OF BARBARISM ARE <span style="color: #0000FF;">YIELDING </span>TO CIVILIZATION<br/>
BY<br/>
<br/>
C. M. KEYS<br/>
<br/>
HERE is nothing in the world more<br/>
<br/>
I astonishing than the rapidity with which<br/>
<br/>
the outlying and until lately <span style="color: #0000FF;">unprogressive </span>corners of the earth are yielding to the<br/>
uplifting <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of Western civilization and<br/>
commerce. All around the world the story<br/>
is the same, the story of modern methods in<br/>
regions but a few years ago barely reached by<br/>
the scouts of progress..<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the Transvaal and the other South<br/>
African colonies of Great Britain are the most<br/>
striking example at the moment. Until to-day,<br/>
the reputation of South Africa has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">sinister</span>. Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria,<br/>
Buluwayo, Ladysmith-the names are eloquent<br/>
of battle. They recall the militant pilgrimage<br/>
of the Boers, seeking a land where slavery<br/>
might thrive; the Zulu Impi, and its mad<br/>
charge upon the circle of Cape wagons; the<br/>
sufferings of a Livingstone, wandering hopeless<br/>
through a hopeless land; at the last, the rumblings of Boer and British cannon, the patient<br/>
<br/>
march and countermarch, the long siege, the<br/>
death march echoing from hill to hill.<br/>
<br/>
But the names are taken to-day from the<br/>
time-table of the railroad. They are the<br/>
central points of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>is growing, that<br/>
is becoming civilized, that has put off the ways<br/>
of war and has become a trader in the marts<br/>
of peace. A little time ago, General Botha,<br/>
perhaps the best of the Boer leaders, was<br/>
elected Premier of South Africa. To-day,<br/>
there are hundreds of Zulus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matabeles</span>, and<br/>
other once warlike Africans working for daily<br/>
wages in the mines, the markets, and the fields<br/>
of British South Africa.<br/>
<br/>
And all these colonies and all their central<br/>
markets are linked together with the double<br/>
band of steel, the railroad, emblem of the Age<br/>
of Progress. Splendid trains whirl out of<br/>
Cape Town, and away into the Northern Outland. The glare of electric lights from the<br/>
windows sweeps the broad veldt where yesterday Gordon, the peaceful hunter, gazed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
