<span>THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL FATIGUE<br/>
<br/>
In the end you have lost far more than mere<br/>
time. You have lost the energy of a good start;<br/>
you have been making a long, slow, dribbling<br/>
expenditure of your will power; and when<br/>
you finally get to the job itself, you are already<br/>
out of temper for it; your mind has grown<br/>
soggy.<br/>
<br/>
Of course such is not the result in every case.<br/>
It takes some people a long time to get warmed<br/>
up to an undertaking; they always have to go<br/>
through that period of preliminary fuss and<br/>
bother. When this is actually true, economy<br/>
certainly requires such a man, once he is underway, to keep up steam on a long stretch; not to<br/>
let down until he has a positive accomplishment to show. He cannot afford to have to<br/>
put himself through those first costly and painful steps again; it's an inexcusable <span style="color: #0000FF;">extravagance</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us Americans, however, have the<br/>
ability-if we will only take advantage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">it-to </span>jump into a job quickly and hard without<br/>
dawdling over the preliminaries. Therefore,<br/>
it's the only right way for us to do. A man<br/>
who takes his hard jobs on this principle will<br/>
be likely to carry them through, for he makes<br/>
the attack while his mind is fresh and clear,<br/>
with a good cutting edge on it. Afterward,<br/>
if he like, he can give himself the luxury of<br/>
dawdling.<br/>
<br/>
Economy of the will requires that, so far as<br/>
possible, a man should push his job through to<br/>
a finish when once he has undertaken it. To<br/>
some sort of a finish: if not the whole job, then<br/>
some complete separate part of it, something<br/>
definite, that can count as a bundle by itself,<br/>
and which, when it is tied up, is really out <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the way. Don't break things off in the middle.<br/>
Don't keep having to get at a thing. When<br/>
you have to take your attention by the scruff<br/>
of the neck every minute or two and force it<br/>
back on the scent, you are making a terrible<br/>
and useless drain on your will power.<br/>
<br/>
Another practical conclusion is this: As<br/>
far as possible, bunch the little things you have<br/>
to do so as to make one larger job of them.<br/>
If you can make a list of the minutiae that need<br/>
attention, and then go at them with a running<br/>
start, the end will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">reached-mot </span>necessarily<br/>
quicker yet certainly with a tremendous saving<br/>
of energy. You don't need to issue your<br/>
manifesto before annihilating each separate<br/>
petty enemy; you can include them all in the<br/>
same warrant.<br/>

<br/>
bear in mind. Keep decision power for things<br/>
that are worth deciding. Then it won't fail<br/>
you when you need it.<br/>

EFFECT OF FATIGUE ON CHARACTER<br/>
<br/>
When a man is fatigued, he is literally a<br/>
different person from his ordinary normal self.<br/>
The qualities that go into his making-up are<br/>
not the same qualities: his disposition, his tastes,<br/>
his intellectual faculties, are all shifted. He<br/>
still carries some of his "recognition marks"<br/>
around with him-such <span style="color: #0000FF;">trifles </span>as bodily structure, hair, history, and clothes-but he ought<br/>
not to use the same visiting card.<br/>
<br/>
Into my own experience has come this case<br/>
of a young college girl, and it is not an exceptional case, either: Through her freshman<br/>
year she did unusually good work; she stood<br/>
in the upper quarter of her class-a normal,<br/>
high-spirited, energetic young person of seventeen years.<br/>
<br/>
During the summer following that first year,<br/>
she worked very hard, rising every morning<br/>
at five o'clock-for they had no domestic, and<br/>
she always aimed to surprise her mother by<br/>
getting the washing and ironing out of the way<br/>
herself. She made all her own clothes for the<br/>
year to come. During that whole vacation,<br/>
she kept herself under this strain.<br/>
<br/>
Then she went back to college. She had<br/>
never been a timid girl; but now, oddly<br/>
enough, she suddenly developed a terrible fear<br/>
of going upstairs to her room alone. Some<br/>
one always had to go with her. She would<br/>
look under her bed, behind the door, in the<br/>
closet. The thing kept her awake at night.<br/>
She stood low in her classes, but that did not<br/>
seem to make any difference to her; she appeared to have lost all interest in her marks.<br/>
She neglected her studies in a way that completely bewildered her friends. She had made<br/>
up her mind to enjoy herself at all costs; and<br/>
she succeeded wretchedly. It was a miserable,<br/>
unhappy year. You would not have recognized her as the girl of the year before.<br/>
<br/>
Another summer came. She had a perfect<br/>
vacation. Most of the time she lived out of<br/>
doors in camp, sleeping well, eating heartily,<br/>
dressing comfortably, taking plenty of moderate<br/>
exercise with wholesome companions.<br/>
<br/>
Back in college once <span style="color: #0000FF;">more-she </span>was a junior<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now-she </span>took the lead in her class. There<br/>
was not the slightest trace of that fear of the<br/>
dark; she never thought of hesitating to go upstairs alone. She had a splendid time all<br/>
<br/>
