a year of sugar alone. One company in<br/>
particular, the American-Hawaiian, which<br/>
owns steamers aggregating 100,000 tons, has<br/>
abandoned the Cape Horn route to associate<br/>
itself with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tehuantepec </span>project. During<br/>
the very first month the road handled 1,000 tons<br/>
a day.<br/>

The third feat of history-making also concerns transportation. Mexico is now a controlling partner in its two big trunk lines. It<br/>
faced that menace to ourselves, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pernicious<br/>

facilities and big orders for equipment are now<br/>
the rule.<br/>

As for new railroad construction, that is<br/>
going on throughout the republic on almost the<br/>
same gigantic scale as with us. Until now the<br/>
rugged backbone of the continent has kept the<br/>
rich coast country of the Pacific a virgin <span style="color: #0000FF;">wilderness</span>. Even a wagon may not find its way over<br/>
the impassable Sierra Madre, and yet both the<br/>
Central and the Southern Pacific are now in<br/>
the lists against crusty old geography. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>

merger; and it simply bought shares in one<br/>
road and then in the other, and did its own<br/>
merging. It effected it through a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">corporation </span>with a capital stock of $ 225,000,000,<br/>
financed largely by American bankers, who<br/>
look for a speedy and vastly increased development of the properties. The hope is reasonable, because over the 7,000 miles of railroad<br/>
(out of a total of 11,000 miles in the country)<br/>
there will now prevail economy of operation<br/>
and elimination of competition. Depots, <span style="color: #0000FF;">warehouses</span>, sidings, all are piled high with freight.<br/>

There has never been construction more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>in Mexico, yet it has never been better.<br/>
The grade will in no place exceed 2 per cent. and<br/>
for one strip alone, not forty miles long, the<br/>
cost is $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">5,000,000</span>. This is apart from the<br/>
harbor works at Manzanillo, where $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500,000<br/>

years more should see trains moving and<br/>
opening up territory that promises to be<br/>
one of the most productive regions in all Mexico.<br/>
The opportunities are possibly greater than<br/>
