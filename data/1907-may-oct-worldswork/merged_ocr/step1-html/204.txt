Finger had a cotton mill then. Dr. James<br/>
Bivings had a mill on the Pacolet River. It<br/>
was at this mill, although after Dr. Bivings<br/>
had left it, that Mr. D. E. Converse got employment in 1855. That mill was the connecting<br/>
link between the manufactures of the old iron<br/>
district and of the modern Spartanburg.<br/>

Mr. D. A. Tompkins, of Charlotte, N. C.,<br/>
prints a little pamphlet of four pictures of High<br/>
Shoals, N. C., in 1750, 1800, 1850, and 1900,<br/>
which explains what happened to the manufactures of the South during the middle of the<br/>
eighteenth century. The first picture shows<br/>

THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
were made the rifles used along the Southern<br/>
frontier. There were eight gunpowder factories in the state, and paper plants that turned<br/>
out 6,000 pounds of paper a year.<br/>
<br/>
The picture of High Shoals in 1850 is typical<br/>
of the next epoch in the history of the South.<br/>
The roller mills were in ruins. The manufacturing interests of this whole section had<br/>
decayed and with them had gone free education. The invention of the cotton gin had<br/>
suddenly made the production of cotton with<br/>
slave labor so profitable that it choked the<br/>
growing manufactures of the South, ruined its<br/>
varied industries, and turned all its energies<br/>
toward developing an economic system <span style="color: #0000FF;">directly<br/>

What the novelists call the "Old South" was<br/>
this period of cotton plantations on the seaboard and small cotton farms in the Piedmont:<br/>
of ruined iron works and struggling cotton<br/>
factories-the period of slavery.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth picture shows High Shoals as<br/>
it is to-day, with the water power turning the<br/>
spindles and looms of a great cotton mill.<br/>
Freed from the institution of slavery, when<br/>
they recovered from its results, and from war and<br/>
Reconstruction, the people of the Piedmont<br/>
began to manufacture again as they had done<br/>
when they first came to this country.<br/>
<br/>
The smokestacks and a revived education,<br/>
the cotton mills and the colleges have again<br/>
started the people of the Piedmont as a part<br/>
of a great nation to doing their work in the<br/>
progress of the world.<br/>
