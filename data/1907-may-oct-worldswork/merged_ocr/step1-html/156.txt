to itself more attention than any other feature<br/>
of our commercial life. By the census of<br/>
1900, the total wealth of the country was<br/>
placed at <span style="color: #0000FF;">881</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>billion dollars, of which vast<br/>
sum <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-tenth </span>was railroad property. After<br/>
deducting nine billions as railroad values,<br/>
there remained 79% billions as representing all<br/>
other interests. No other kind of property,<br/>
however, is so universally distributed over the<br/>
country as the railroad and none is more subject to discussion at all times, entering as it<br/>
does so vitally into the necessities of every<br/>
community; and when you ask what lines of<br/>

THE RAILROAD <span style="color: #ff0000;">ENTERPRISES<br/>
<br/>
</span>OF THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
development I think of most importance, I<br/>
have no hesitation in saying that the lines of<br/>
development now most pressing are in respect<br/>
to additional track capacity and a better <span style="color: #0000FF;">understanding </span>between the railroads and the people.<br/>
As I have said on other occasions, the most<br/>
valuable and the most patriotic service a man<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>render his country, particularly at this<br/>
time, is in assisting to establish a better<br/>
and more friendly understanding between the<br/>
people and the railroads, and cooperation between our governments, both state and national<br/>
and the managements of railroads.<br/>

THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE<br/>

<br/>
T THE present time, the South and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>Southwest lead all the other sections<br/>
of the United States in the number and<br/>
extent of railroad lines projected or under construction. The Railway A ge recently published<br/>
a very complete summary of the railroad<br/>
mileage under contract or under consideration<br/>
in the United States. For the purpose of this<br/>
article, the table published by this authority<br/>
may be rearranged, as follows<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>

Total <span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>11,912<br/>
<br/>
From this summary, it appears that the Southern and Southwestern States are responsible<br/>
for about 49 per cent. of the entire railroad<br/>
mileage under contract or under construction<br/>
in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
From the same authority, we learn that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>states generally included under the<br/>
<br/>
term "Southern and Southwestern" gained<br/>
about 45 per cent. of the new railroad actually<br/>
built in the year 1906. This summary is<br/>
interesting. The results of it are given below,<br/>
by states:<br/>
<br/>

</span>The South appears to be at this time a<br/>
fertile field for railroad builders of the imaginative type. I remember investigating one of<br/>
these projects some three years ago. The<br/>
road was announced with a great <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourish </span>of<br/>
trumpets, in a Texas newspaper. The announcement named a "prominent financier<br/>
of New York" as the president. His name<br/>
was familiar in Wall Street. He was a Kerr.<br/>
tucky gentleman, famed for the stories that he<br/>
told if one found him late in the day<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
