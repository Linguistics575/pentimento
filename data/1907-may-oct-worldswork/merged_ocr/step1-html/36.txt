and is unusually <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-informed</span>. In travel he<br/>
is enthusiastic, and has penetrated most of<br/>
the corners of Europe. In golf he is a devotee.<br/>
In organized religious effort he has always been<br/>
interested, and has rendered most valuable<br/>
assistance to the church. In music and art<br/>
and scientific invention he has been a wide<br/>
and constant reader.<br/>
<br/>
These broad ranges of interest give him a<br/>
genuine human quality, which grapples his<br/>
friends with hoops of steel. He does not,<br/>
indeed, clap a friend on the back with that<br/>
impertinent <span style="color: #0000FF;">breeziness </span>and effrontery which<br/>
in some circles take the place of real esteem<br/>
and human kindness. But a better storyteller, or a more <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole-souled </span>companion<br/>
on a journey, it would be hard to find. I<br/>
have heard him read the effusions of "Mr.<br/>
Dooley" to scores of friends with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dramatic<br/>

<br/>
HIS VIEW OF PUBLIC LIFE<br/>
<br/>
But what chiefly concerns us <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>is Mr.<br/>
Hughes's conception of public life as simply<br/>
public service. He regards himself, in his<br/>
own words, as "trustee of the people's confidence." To abuse that confidence would be<br/>
to him the depth of <span style="color: #ff0000;">perfidyr </span>to deserve and<br/>
honor it is for him the supreme ambition. He<br/>
is immensely democratic in his principles,<br/>
believing in the people as heartily as did<br/>
Abraham Lincoln. The higher education and<br/>

a friendly acquaintance with great financiers<br/>
have not changed in the smallest degree his<br/>
faith in popular government. He does not<br/>
crave political office, and gladly looks forward<br/>
to the time when he can resume the practice<br/>
of his profession. But, having been summoned<br/>
against his will into the arena of public life, it<br/>
must be confessed that he enjoys it.<br/>
confront opposition with as much zest as he<br/>
can face a precipitous Alpine summit. Heartily<br/>
he believes that "aggressive fighting for the<br/>
right is the greatest sport in the world." He<br/>
is faithful to his trust, not because he has<br/>
determined to be heroic, but because to be<br/>
unfaithful seems to him stupid and inane and<br/>
inconceivable<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He moves from task to task,<br/>
not so much under pressure of the "New<br/>
England conscience," as in the light of a clear<br/>
intelligence which shows him that no enduring<br/>
achievement is possible, except along lines of<br/>
truth and righteousness.<br/>
<br/>
When a noted politician recently tried to get<br/>
Governor Hughes to support him in a certain<br/>
personal scheme, he came away utterly crestfallen, saying: "That is the strangest man<br/>
I ever met. You can't make any sort of trade<br/>
with him; you can't approach him on the side<br/>
of personal advantage; you can't seem to<br/>
touch his political ambition. He is beyond<br/>
me; the fool simply does right the whole<br/>
time!" Of such noble folly the country<br/>
may safely expect Mr. Hughes to continue<br/>
guilty.<br/>
