in Canada. Tibet lamb is noted for being as<br/>
white as snow and as <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>as silk. Dyeing with<br/>
a fine gloss, it is used for trimmings. Including<br/>
Shiraz, pure Persian lamb, and Tibet lamb,<br/>

Almost better known than Persian lamb is<br/>
Astrakhan fur, erroneously regarded and called<br/>
in some markets "Astrakhan dog skin." <span style="color: #ff0000;">Like<br/>
</span>the Persian fur, it is a lamb skin; it comes from<br/>
the south of Russia, which annually sends<br/>

THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
fur-experts state that there are 500,000,000<br/>
sheep in the world which yearly yield up their<br/>
hides for men's use. I do not vouch for the<br/>
figures; they are too big for me.<br/>
<br/>
THE MYSTERY OF THE SILVER FOX<br/>
<br/>
Next to the lamb "furs," I don't suppose<br/>
any fur is more generally known than fox skins,<br/>
used as boas, <span style="color: #0000FF;">muffs</span>, tippets, and rugs. King<br/>
of all fox skins, of course, is the silver fox.<br/>
Let me say right here, silver fox is not gray<br/>

</span>SEA-OTTER HUNTERS IN THEIR KAYAKS OFF THE ALEUTIAN <span style="color: #ff0000;">ISLANDS<br/>

600,000 to the Nijni fair. From Russia, they<br/>
pass to Leipsic to be dyed, and from Leipsic<br/>
to Paris and London and Montreal and New<br/>
York, whence they scatter to the local markets.<br/>
"Gray Persian lamb" is another term expressive of a false notion about the fur made into<br/>
coats and caps for juveniles. It is not Persian<br/>
lamb, but Crimmer lamb from the Crimean<br/>
region of Russia. Including all sheep-the<br/>
common sheep of the farm which gives us<br/>
meat and leather and rugs, and the rare Russian and Persian sheep whose wool we use as<br/>
<br/>
fox and it is not blue fox and it is not black fox,<br/>
with the hairs silvered by chemicals. It may<br/>
seem a truism, but silver fox is silver <span style="color: #0000FF;">fox-glossy </span>as silk, springy as wire, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">silvered<br/>
</span>furs intermingled with black-the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">uniform </span>the silver the more valuable the pelt. Its<br/>
price ranges from $ 300 to $ 750.<br/>
<br/>
What is silver fox? That is a question over<br/>
which scientists have been breaking each other's<br/>
heads for <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>hundred years. I asked a <span style="color: #0000FF;">naturalist </span>who had studied the silver fox in the north<br/>
