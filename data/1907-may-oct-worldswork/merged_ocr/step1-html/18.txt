<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">8816 </span>THE<br/>
position of personal controversy with a subscriber to a campaign fund who has always<br/>
regarded his political contributions as purchases<br/>
of influence or of immunity.<br/>
<br/>
The moral is two-fold and clear. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span>) The <span style="color: #0000FF;">tari </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ff</span>, which gives a partya chance to swap protection for funds, must be removed before we shall<br/>
have done with this system; and (2) campaign<br/>
managers must be compelled by an enforceable<br/>
law to keep their books open-to make public<br/>
their receipts and their expenditures. If Mr.<br/>
Bliss and Mr. Cortelyou had been obliged to<br/>
write down and publish an item like this:<br/>
<br/>
"Received from E. H. Harriman the sum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand<br/>
</span>dollars to be spent <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>--"<br/>
<br/>
there would have been no such unhappy <span style="color: #0000FF;">experience </span>as we recently had in reading letters<br/>
that, under a decent system of campaigning,<br/>
would never have been written.<br/>
<br/>
We had as well bend ourselves to these great<br/>
cleansing tasks now as later. It would be an<br/>
uplifting experience surely to be rid of such<br/>
scandals in the future.<br/>
<br/>
THE FIRST LINE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL BATTLE<br/>
<br/>
HE contest for the Republican Presi<br/>
dential nomination has begun in earnest<br/>
in Ohio. Senator Foraker stands for the<br/>
political machine and for policies that are<br/>
opposed to President Roosevelt; and he <span style="color: #0000FF;">chal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">longed </span>Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>to test his strength at a<br/>
party primary. The challenge was promptly <span style="color: #0000FF;">accepted </span>for the Secretary, who at the time was<br/>
in Panama, by his brother, Mr. Charles P.<br/>
Taft, of Cincinnati. The Republican primary<br/>
election thus contemplated may never be held,<br/>
but the contest between these two factions has<br/>
begun and will continue till some event clearly<br/>
indicates the public and the party preference.<br/>
<br/>
This Ohio <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight </span>is noteworthy chiefly because.<br/>
<br/>
it puts Secretary Taft clearly in the race.<br/>
<br/>
For the endorsement of his own state will<br/>
put him foremost in line for the nomination.<br/>
He will stand, as no other candidate could<br/>
stand, for the Roosevelt policies of regulating<br/>
the railroads and other corporations, of our<br/>
island governments, of the Panama canal,<br/>
and the rest.<br/>
<br/>
The contest is the more illuminating because<br/>
Senator Foraker admirably represents the <span style="color: #ff0000;">antiRoosevelt </span>influences in the Republican <span style="color: #ff0000;">party-the </span>old machine, a tacit alliance with corporate<br/>
disregard of the law, the complaisant programme of indulgence to the privileged classes<br/>
<br/>
MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>short, the policies that lead backward into<br/>
the old ruts and are meaningless when not<br/>
corrupt. For these reasons, this Ohio contest<br/>
looks very like the first thin line of battle.<br/>
<br/>
THE DEMOCRATIC INDECISION<br/>
<br/>
HE Democratic party in the meantime<br/>
<br/>
presents a curious study to the student<br/>
of politics. It is giving no thought to the<br/>
next campaign. It shows no spirit. It seems<br/>
to have no hope. It develops no leaders.<br/>
It has no opinion that finds assertion. It<br/>
seems, without an effort at resistance, to have<br/>
surrendered to Mr. Bryan, whose chief claim<br/>
to distinction is that he has twice failed as a<br/>
leader and has not learned a leader's wisdom<br/>
by defeat. The sober part of the party does<br/>
not want him as a candidate again, and yet<br/>
no effort is made to prevent his nomination.<br/>
Now, when it is recalled that at least half of<br/>
the voters in the United States are Democrats<br/>
by tradition, if not by definite inclination and<br/>
doctrine, this momentary abjectness of the<br/>
great party is a very curious fact.<br/>
<br/>
The meaning of it is plain. Both the old<br/>
parties, merely as parties, are moribund. The<br/>
life that either shows depends on the personalities of their leaders.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting and active public<br/>
leaders now are Republicans. The success of their party is, therefore, taken for<br/>
granted. Yet their party is strong not<br/>
because their party doctrines are strong. It is<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">lead </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ers</span>' personal strength with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">people-the </span>people's confidence in them. If there<br/>
were men in the Democratic party of great<br/>
personal popularity who had the quality of<br/>
leadership, the fact that they were Democrats<br/>
would not lessen their chance of success.<br/>
Probably it would help it. Mr. Bryan, if<br/>
we may guess from present indications, will<br/>
have an easy and even inevitable victory in<br/>
the nominating convention, because apparently<br/>
there will be no other candidate whom any<br/>
large number of the people know. Yet the<br/>
very men who expect his nomination and will<br/>
acquiesce in it expect him to be defeated.<br/>
<br/>
It is an interesting thing to speculate about<br/>
-how parties find leaders. In times of great<br/>
moral earnestness, strong men are pushed<br/>
forward by this earnestness. But, when party<br/>
doctrines have become mere formulas, as<br/>
now, and it is chiefly the personal desire for<br/>
office or for power that impels men, those<br/>
men become leaders whose personal <span style="color: #ff0000;">qualities<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
