<br/>
thank those that save it." But the white man<br/>
takes up his burden as ever. Thanks from<br/>
those he saves he does not need; he demands<br/>
only the sympathetic attitude of his other<br/>
white brethren-and that at last Lord Cromer<br/>
won and hands down to his happier successor.<br/>
But England has educated the so-called<br/>
Nationalists in Egypt only to have them turn<br/>
against her, just as in India Britain has raised<br/>
the timid Bengali from dirt and oppression<br/>
only to see them lead the sedition and misrepresentation of the peninsula against her.<br/>
<br/>
THE OUTLOOK<br/>
<br/>
But the pilot has been dropped and for a<br/>
moment men's interest centres round the new<br/>
helmsman. Strong as Cromer was strong,<br/>
strong as an elemental force, Gorst is not.<br/>
His strength lies in his gigantic knowledge of<br/>
every aspect of every question affecting Egypt<br/>
a knowledge, which, as was intended and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">foreseen</span>, has been solidified and extended by<br/>
his term of work in the Foreign Office in<br/>
London. Yet his lack of creative power is the<br/>
less to be deplored because Cromer has put<br/>
all things in such train that the exact policy<br/>
to be pursued at every point is for his successor<br/>
rather a tradition or a necessity than a choice.<br/>
For the future, it will be more a question of<br/>
manner than matter. The manner of Cromer<br/>
was superb. There was apparently no discussion: no one's name, not even the Agent's,<br/>
was put forward; unless it was advisable, there<br/>
was not even warning given, but the desired<br/>
end was secured. As we have seen, it was here<br/>
a case of closing elementary schools; there it<br/>
was a question of the spending of $ 30,000,000<br/>
and the destruction of Phila<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to ensure the<br/>
permanent prosperity of the country. There<br/>
was scarcely a ripple on the surface as the<br/>
finances of Egypt were slowly pulled out of<br/>
the slough into which they had fallen; there<br/>
was no more advertisement than was inevitable<br/>
on the occasion of the publication of the<br/>
annual Budget.<br/>
<br/>
Once and only once, there had to be a display. Egypt had lost the Sudan provinces<br/>
and bided its time for their recovery. The<br/>
time came, and Kitchener went up the Nile.<br/>
At a cost that was ludicrously small, the two<br/>
battles of the Atbara and Omdurman were<br/>
fought, the valley of the Nile was secured for<br/>
British influence, the Mahdi's supremacy was<br/>
destroyed, Gordon was avenged, and the upper<br/>
lands of the Nile returned again to be admin<br/>

<br/>
CROMER, MAKER OF EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">istered </span>in Cairo. Yet, even at this time,<br/>
Cromer's name hardly appeared; and afterward, while the great schemes he has inaugurated were coming to fruition, in silence he<br/>
moved strongly about the vast spaces of Egypt.<br/>
He has touched nothing from the Great Lakes<br/>
to the Alexandrian breakwater which he has<br/>
not helped most powerfully.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there are few men who claim to know<br/>
him, and the secret of his influence is kept<br/>
even from them. Those who are best acquainted with his methods will often bewilder<br/>
a listener in attempting to describe his personality. After using many words, there still<br/>
remains the apparent inadequacy of Lord<br/>
Cromer's means, however fully they may be<br/>
described, to the ends he obviously attained.<br/>
This is a secret which cannot be imparted,<br/>
though perhaps it is the most important<br/>
secret of these modern days. For the time<br/>
has gone by when outward show produced<br/>
respect and smoothed the path of achievement.<br/>
Lord Cromer's strenuous retirement from<br/>
public observation not only facilitated difficult<br/>
passages with foreign governments, but was<br/>
own cousin to that impenetrable veil which<br/>
hid the personality and baffled the critics of<br/>
Lord Salisbury. Immense industry, wide views,<br/>
and a determination to achieve the aim rather<br/>
than to get the credit for it laid solid foundations<br/>
for such work as Lord Cromer's, but do not<br/>
catch the eye. Now, as after twenty-four<br/>
years of unremitting work he resigns the government of the collection of half-civilized families,<br/>
clans, and tribes which he has made into a<br/>
state, the personal modesty of the man has in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>measure prevented the imagination of common<br/>
men from being stirred by his achievement.<br/>
Yet it cannot be too well recognized that<br/>
among the great administrators and creators<br/>
of mankind, Lord Cromer holds a place which<br/>
no other living man can claim to-day, and which<br/>
in its worth, degree, and permanence is not<br/>
less than that with which Bismarck, Garibaldi,<br/>
Clive, and Washington are associated in the<br/>
minds of men. What the future holds it is<br/>
impossible to guess, but never was a ship<br/>
launched with half the certainty of her holding<br/>
her own against the worst violence of the<br/>
troubled seas, than must now gladden Lord<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cromer</span>'s heart as he steps down from the<br/>
bridge of the stout ship of his own construction<br/>
and gives over his life's work to the use and<br/>
care of a younger and more vigorous man<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>And that is all he cares about<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
