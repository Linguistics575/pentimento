<br/>
</span>Sir Patrick Manson is between the two women students.<br/>
above him is Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Castellani</span>, with Mr. Daniels next, and next to him again is the Secretary, Mr. Michelli.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Sambon is second in the front row<br/>
<br/>
into which the experimenters retired when the<br/>
insects came out to feed, and whence they did<br/>
not emerge until feeding time was over. At the<br/>
same time, they sent some of the infected<br/>
mosquitoes to London, and these successfully<br/>
conveyed malarial disease to two healthy individuals who volunteered to be bitten-Mr. P.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thurburn </span>Manson, son of Sir Patrick Manson,<br/>
and Mr. Warren, a laboratory assistant. The<br/>
following telegram, sent from the hut at Ostia<br/>
by Professor Grassi, an eminent Italian physician, indicates the importance attached to the<br/>
double experiment:<br/>
<br/>
"Assembled in British experimental hut,<br/>
having witnessed perfect health experimenters<br/>
amidst malaria-stricken inhabitants. Italian<br/>
physicians congratulate Manson, who first formulated mosquito-malarial theory. Grassi."<br/>
<br/>
It was Dr. G. C. Low, too, who showed for<br/>
the first time in what manner the blood-worm<br/>
responsible for an important group of tropical<br/>
diseases, represented by that hideous and <span style="color: #0000FF;">disabling </span>illness, elephantiasis, gains access to the<br/>
human body. Like the malaria parasite, it is<br/>
introduced by the proboscis of the female<br/>
mosquito. This discovery is in itself of sufficient importance to justify the existence of the<br/>
school many times over, since it indicates the<br/>
way of escape from a whole class of diseases<br/>
prevalent in hot climates, namely, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mination </span>of the mosquito.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing is that these minute<br/>
parasites have it in their power to control<br/>

the destinies of millions of human beings. They<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">can</span>, and do, reduce the population of whole<br/>
towns and villages. One of the illustrations<br/>
shows the trypanosome, one of the most recently<br/>
discovered of the parasites, in the blood corpuscles. Introduced into the human body through<br/>
the proboscis of its host-the tsetse fly--it<br/>
multiplies until the whole system is poisoned and<br/>
the patient dies of "sleeping sickness," perhaps<br/>
two years after being bitten. A royal commission has reported that the population of a small<br/>
village on the Congo was reduced from 3,000<br/>
to 300 through the ravages of sleeping sickness.<br/>
The extraordinary extent to which the disease<br/>
spread is attributed, by some authorities, to<br/>
the exaction of the hut tax, since in lieu of payment thousands of men go yearly to Entebbe<br/>
(where there is now a laboratory for investigations) and, while working for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government</span>, live in grass huts along the shore of the<br/>
lake where these insects abound.<br/>
<br/>
At the present moment, the British Commissioner of Uganda is making vigorous efforts<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">deal </span>with "sleeping sickness," and all persons<br/>
suffering from the disease are being removed<br/>
from the fly-infected districts and placed in<br/>
settlements inland, where they are being treated<br/>
with atoxyl. An expenditure of some $ 6,000,<br/>
spread over three years, is estimated.<br/>
<br/>
Four years ago, the English Foreign Office<br/>
instigated an expedition to Uganda to inquire<br/>
into the cause of this terrible illness, one of the<br/>
expeditioners being Dr. Castellani, a former<br/>
<br/>
