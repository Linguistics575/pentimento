<br/>
and for work that had been done before he had<br/>
touched a finger to the enterprise; more than<br/>
that, to collect his 4 per cent. on what was<br/>
not done or not delivered at all, a commission<br/>
figured on the total amount of the graft.<br/>
<br/>
How was all this possible?<br/>
<br/>
The marvel is that in all this broad scheme<br/>
of plunder it has not yet been shown where the<br/>
great bosses came in. What the state is now<br/>
asking is, who got this money? It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">inconceivable </span>that it was a present to Payne and<br/>
Sanderson and Huston. If it was, then there<br/>
was a reason for that-some momentous service<br/>
by one or all to the machine, a service of which<br/>
the public has no inkling. These men were<br/>
not bosses, big or little. They were favored<br/>
citizens. Why? The machine is not given<br/>
to favoring citizens. It holds all it gets<br/>
strictly for its own. How are these men connected with the machine? One of two things<br/>
is certain, though neither of them has been<br/>
indicated as yet by a single atom of evidence<br/>
before the Investigating Commission: either<br/>
they were simply the agents to draw the money<br/>
from the treasury for some of the big fellows,<br/>
or else they have rendered such service that<br/>
their profit of millions is only a fair recompense.<br/>
The investigation will not be complete until<br/>
one or the other of these things is developed.<br/>
<br/>
It is plain that there were two commissions<br/>
at work at the same time, or in part at the same<br/>
time. One erected the building and the other<br/>
furnished it. Both recognized architect Huston<br/>
as chief. Huston didn't draw any fine line<br/>
between the two; he got his commission on<br/>
either job, and out of the same treasury. There<br/>
was a beautiful opportunity here to duplicate<br/>
work, and testimony shows that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Opportunity<br/>
</span>was not overlooked. Again, there was a chance<br/>
for one to assume that contracts existed with<br/>
the other, and to juggle them back and forth<br/>
as occasion prompted.<br/>
<br/>
What graft there was in the construction of<br/>
the building has not yet been carefully gone into.<br/>
It is known that Payne & Co., the contractors,<br/>
substituted putty for carved mahogany moldings, and plaster for tile; and laid 4-inch concrete walks instead of walks of standard depth,<br/>
and put in cheap glass instead of the costly<br/>
partition glass specified. But there is little<br/>
that can yet be told in detail as to this. We<br/>
know that months before the letting of the<br/>
contract for the granite, months before the<br/>
completion of the specifications even, Huston,<br/>
John H. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanderson</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>Philip C. Johnson, a<br/>

PENNSYLVANIA'S PALACE OF GRAFT<br/>
<br/>
brother-in-law of Israel Durham, and some<br/>
others, were trying to secure a quarry near<br/>
Easton from which a peculiarly veined marble<br/>
called <span style="color: #ff0000;">verdolite </span>can alone be obtained, and that<br/>
they wanted to capitalize the quarry on a basis<br/>
that gave the owner IO per cent. Failing to<br/>
get his consent, they tried--and failed-to<br/>
open up the same vein on adjoining land.<br/>
They at last selected the Woodbury granite,<br/>
whose owner paid an associate of Huston<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5,000 </span>to have the contract swung his way.<br/>
<br/>
THE FARCE OF SOLICITING BIDS<br/>
<br/>
But it was different with the furnishing.<br/>
The present legislative committee has revealed<br/>
enough to make one's brain dizzy. The Board<br/>
of Public Grounds and Buildings quietly<br/>
adopted a resolution offered by Governor<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pennypacker </span>that no bids should be considered<br/>
that did not cover the whole job. That fact<br/>
was not made public, and the advertisements<br/>
allowed bids for the whole or in part. All<br/>
the witnesses before the Commission said that<br/>
they were encouraged to bid on single items<br/>
by Joseph M. Huston, the architect, and two<br/>
witnesses declared that Mr. Pennypacker himself<br/>
told them there was nothing to hinder them<br/>
from bidding on any separate item. John H.<br/>
Sanderson alone knew of this resolution; he<br/>
alone bid on the whole, 23 per cent. off maximum rates. He got the contract and he knew<br/>
he would get it. Long before this time, he was<br/>
studying Huston's plans in the locked attic<br/>
in the Witherspoon Building in Philadelphia,<br/>
where the draughtsmen were at work. He<br/>
had organized "The Pennsylvania Bronze<br/>
Company," with his brother-in-law, Pedro J.<br/>
Salom, as visible head; it furnished chandeliers at $ 4.85 per pound, regardless of <span style="color: #0000FF;">specifications</span>; and notice that $ 4.85 is not 23 per cent.<br/>
off a $ 5 maximum but 3 per cent. The 2 got<br/>
lost after the contract was awarded, so witnesses<br/>
testify, and never figured afterward except on<br/>
the witness stand. It does not matter. He<br/>
was the only legal bidder. When one realizes<br/>
that some of these. chandeliers weigh two tons,<br/>
are loaded with iron worth four cents a pound,<br/>
and are billed to the state at far in excess of<br/>
their actual weight, one sees Sanderson's possibility. This was the working of Delaney's<br/>
"per-pound" rule, that none of the other prospective bidders for the contract knew how<br/>
to figure on.<br/>
<br/>
And the "per-foot" rule was equally <span style="color: #ff0000;">benchcent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Sanderson, A table; <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">half<br/>
