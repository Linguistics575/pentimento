<span>A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
Atlanta's buildings and its methods are the<br/>
buildings and the methods of a large modern<br/>
commercial city. It is the "Southern headquarters" for every kind of company or<br/>
organization that has to do with the South.<br/>
Unattractive in location, self-confident, noisy,<br/>
successful, energetic, its population is cosmopolitan. It has its street of millionaires (every rich<br/>
man is a millionaire for the conveniences of<br/>
boasting) made opulent from patent medicines<br/>
well as as by legitimate trade and manufacturing; office-buildings and residences that would<br/>
do credit to any city; far-sighted captains of<br/>
industry, who proved the energy and the constructive ability of the common man, as soon<br/>
as opportunity opened its doors to him. It is<br/>
the great commercial, financial, and railroad<br/>
centre of the South east of New Orleans, and is<br/>
full of paradoxes and contrarieties, as all new<br/>
cities are. It is the home at once of "Uncle<br/>
Remus," who has made the Negro immortal<br/>
in literature, and of the worst cranks who discuss the Negro-the best and the worst, the<br/>
strongest and the silliest products of Southern<br/>
life. All catch the local enthusiasm; all are<br/>
building Atlanta. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Georgian Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
BIRMINGHAM<br/>
<br/>
Or, for sheer romance in city-building, consider Birmingham, Ala. There are men now<br/>
living who remember the gentle old geologist,<br/>
Professor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuomey</span>, who spent a summer wandering through the valley in which Birmingham<br/>
is situated and who filled his wallet with a colored<br/>
earth which he picked up on the mountain side.<br/>
He took it down to the village of Elyton, where<br/>
he spent the night, and told the people that it<br/>
was iron ore. They gathered around him and<br/>
laughed at him and remarked to one another<br/>
that the old man thought he had found something of value when it was nothing but "dye dirt";<br/>
for the Indians and their successors had used<br/>
this ore for dyeing cloth from time immemorial.<br/>
Yet not a cannon was made of it during<br/>
the war that began after Jefferson Davis was<br/>
inaugurated at Montgomery. In the course<br/>
of time, a railroad was built through Elyton.<br/>
Some time later, another railroad line was to<br/>
come through the region, but the people of<br/>
Elyton had been disturbed enough by one road,<br/>
and they declined to have another. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">railroad-crossing</span>, therefore, was made a few miles<br/>
away from the village. That railroad-crossing<br/>
is now the centre of the city of Birmingham.<br/>
The "dye dirt" indicated a mountain of ore that<br/>
<br/>
9027<br/>
<br/>
for all practical purposes is inexhaustible. So<br/>
is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">supply </span>of coal and both are near at hand.<br/>
Nature, therefore, made a great city in the<br/>
valley inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
The furnaces and its rail-making are the<br/>
foundation of the town, which is already taking<br/>
on the appearance and adopting the methods<br/>
of a large city. These industries are, of course,<br/>
but the forerunners of other great works of a<br/>
similar sort, and all these are but the forerunners of a manufacturing development yet to<br/>
come, when small things as well as pig-iron and<br/>
steel-rails shall be made there, and when one of<br/>
the great manufacturing cities of the Union will<br/>
fill the valley. People have come to Birmingham<br/>
from most parts of the Union, and they are<br/>
still coming. It is easy to see that the stream<br/>
will continue for an <span style="color: #0000FF;">indefinite </span>time, for here<br/>
must be one of the great inland cities of the<br/>
continent. Already the people are aware of<br/>
this, not simply in their boasts but in their<br/>
preparations. They have laid out a city by<br/>
a method which admits of indefinite growth<br/>
without radical changes of plan. They have<br/>
already developed a school system which is<br/>
really effective. It would be hard to find in<br/>
any city of its size better work done, and it<br/>
has a public spirit that builds solidly as it goes,<br/>
but at the same time builds for a constantly<br/>
expanding future. No American city has a<br/>
surer future as a great manufacturing centre.<br/>
<br/>
MONTGOMERY<br/>
<br/>
Montgomery is neither seaboard nor upland.<br/>
It is a city that has an <span style="color: #0000FF;">old-time </span>flavor. It was<br/>
regarded by its neighbors as a sleepy village,<br/>
where the capitol of the state had the misfortune<br/>
to be situated-such was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">goodmatured<br/>
</span>bantering of newer cities around it, until the<br/>
present period of prosperity set in. Then Montgomery began to build round about its quiet<br/>
and conservative life a commercial activity<br/>
that has transformed it, although it has not<br/>
changed its old character. Ten years ago,<br/>
they used to remind you that Jefferson Davis<br/>
was inaugurated as President of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Con-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">federacy </span>in the old capitol. Now they tell<br/>
you of the plan that they are carrying out to<br/>
remodel the old building and to make it worthy<br/>
of the commonwealth. On a conspicuous corner in the business part of the town, a substantial building, six stories high, which until a<br/>
few years ago was the most important business<br/>
building in the city, has been torn down to give<br/>
room to a skyscraper, for the land does not<br/>
