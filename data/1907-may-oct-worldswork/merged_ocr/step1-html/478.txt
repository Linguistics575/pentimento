<span>9276 THE MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
terminable after a fixed period, and meanwhile subject to<br/>
purchase at a fair value.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Municipalities </span>should have the power to enter the field<br/>
of municipal ownership upon popular vote under reasonable<br/>
regulation.<br/>
<br/>
"Private companies operating public utilities should be<br/>
subject to public regulation and examination under <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>system of uniform records and accounts and of full<br/>
publicity."<br/>
<br/>
The general attitude of the committee to the<br/>
whole large subject of the nature of public<br/>
utilities is worthy of note. These it believes<br/>
to be monopolistic and not subject to the<br/>
regulative force of competition. It thus follows<br/>
that they should be either regulated or operated<br/>
by the public, if the public is to secure fair<br/>
treatment. The report as a whole is encouraging to those who believe in moderate municipal<br/>
ownership and effective public control. It<br/>
utterly discourages the leaving of <span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>corporations to regulate themselves and, on the<br/>
other hand, it refuses to regard municipal<br/>
ownership as a panacea. It is probable that<br/>
this is as fair a statement of our experience and<br/>
of the conclusions of thoughtful men as could<br/>
be made. It means that we have definitely<br/>
abandoned the old idea of leaving public utilities<br/>
to corporations without regulation and that we<br/>
are ready to adopt even municipal ownership<br/>
wherever local conditions permit a reasonable<br/>
hope of success.<br/>
<br/>
CITY REFORMATION THROUGH CALAMITIES<br/>
<br/>
HE more experiments we make in trying to<br/>
get rid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">corrvpt </span>municipal politics, the<br/>
clearer it becomes that concentrated personal<br/>
responsibility in government is one of the conditions of success. Whenever a city finds itself<br/>
overwhelmed by some disaster or by simply<br/>
insufferable corruption, it turns instinctively<br/>
to this method.<br/>
<br/>
The "Texas idea" had its beginning after<br/>
the great flood at Galveston. The city government broke down under this calamity and the<br/>
public affairs were thrust into the hands of a<br/>
committee of public-spirited men in whom the<br/>
community had confidence. They restored<br/>
order; they set the community going again in a<br/>
satisfactory fashion; and the people then asked<br/>
themselves why this highly successful form of<br/>
improvised city government should not be made<br/>
permanent. The charter was changed; a<br/>
mayor-president and four commissioners were<br/>
elected-every man personally responsible for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>department. Other cities of Texas <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>lowed. The notable success of the plan'in<br/>
Houston, which substituted a remarkably good<br/>
government for a very bad one, gave a great<br/>
impetus to it; and the principle has now been<br/>
applied in several parts of the United States.<br/>
San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco </span>had a double calamity; for<br/>
its government at the time of the disaster and<br/>
afterwards was perhaps the most <span style="color: #ff0000;">corrunt </span>and<br/>
shameless in all American experience. By the<br/>
energy of Mr. Heney, as prosecutor, and of<br/>
Mr. Rudolph Spreckels, as a public-spirited<br/>
man of wealth, Mayor Schmitz was sent to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">penitentiary </span>for five years; and a mayor was<br/>
chosen by the supervisors, practically at the<br/>
dictation of those who had brought Schmitz to<br/>
trial. They chose Dr. E. R. Taylor, a most<br/>
versatile and highly esteemed man who has had<br/>
experience in almost every kind of work but<br/>
politics. He was dean of a law school, acting<br/>
president of a medical college (being both a<br/>
lawyer and a physician), and a poet to boot.<br/>
He takes the full personal responsibility for the<br/>
government of the city at this critical time, when<br/>
public crime has followed the great physical<br/>
calamity and when confidence and honesty<br/>
count for more even than usual. There are<br/>
perhaps 100 million dollars' worth of buildings<br/>
now going up there, and more than ever before<br/>
the community needs rest from thieves and<br/>
bosses. At such a time, it turns to the plan of<br/>
concentrating the responsibility for its government on one <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>he not a political creature.<br/>
Again, in Louisville, Ky., a similar thing has<br/>
been done. The era of Goebel politics in<br/>
Kentucky brought something closely akin to<br/>
civil war in Louisville municipal elections.<br/>
The city ceased to be a "stronghold" of Democracy and a vigorous opposition grew up to<br/>
the brutal machine methods<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>unscrupulous did the machine become at the<br/>
last election that its candidates took the offices<br/>
by fraud. When the contest was carried into<br/>
the courts, the election was declared void, the<br/>
incumbents were removed, and it fell to the<br/>
Governor to appoint new city <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>pending<br/>
an election. Governor Beckham appointed as<br/>
Mayor Mr. Robert W. Bingham, a young<br/>
lawyer of courage and character and standing,<br/>
who has the full personal responsibility for the<br/>
city's government. The subordinate officials<br/>
of the machine have been removed and Mayor<br/>
Bingham is practically in the same relation to<br/>
the government and to the city as Mayor Taylor<br/>
of San Francisco, and each of them has the<br/>
same concentrated personal responsibility <span style="color: #ff0000;">as<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">brutal </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
