out the friars. That would have ended the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">grievance </span>but for the fact that the friars had<br/>

was much consultation among clerical statesmen. It ended in a decision to sell; and in<br/>
this way was solved one of the most vexatious<br/>
of our Philippine problems.<br/>
<br/>
The tariff was another grievance but the<br/>
United States Senate held views differing from<br/>
those of Judge Taft. However, the Commission<br/>
lightened the burden as much as possible,<br/>
bearing <span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span>hard on luxuries and lightly on<br/>
necessities. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a reversal of the principle of the Spanish tariff, when the duty on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">foodstuffs </span>had been prohibitive. The Commission wanted <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>75 per cent. reduction in our<br/>
duties on imports from the Philippines <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>

respects to the Civil Service law of the United<br/>
States. All appointments are based on merit.<br/>
An applicant can enter the lowest rank, if<br/>
qualified for nothing better, and work himself<br/>
up to the head of a department. Where a<br/>
Filipino's qualifications equal those of an<br/>
American applicant, the Filipino is given the<br/>
preference. But there were many discouragements at first and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>less patient man might have<br/>
abandoned the attempt. The Filipino did not<br/>
recognize any sacred trust in the handling of<br/>
public money and had to be taught how not<br/>
to steal. The American applicant, too, was<br/>
frequently seeking an easy field for graft.<br/>
