<span>THE RAILROAD CONQUEST OF THE MOUNTAINS 9223<br/>
<br/>
heart of "Bret Harte's land," running the line<br/>
of the Western Pacific, are just as were the<br/>
"roaring" camps of the last generation, save<br/>
that they lack Bret Harte. The engineers<br/>
still lose themselves in the deep snow, perish<br/>
by falls from the cliffs, are swept away by the<br/>
strong rivers. The "company boarding<br/>
houses" along the Sierra still serve their patrons<br/>
with bacon, beans, and hard black bread, the<br/>
only noticeable difference being that nowadays<br/>
the weekly charge for the same is $ 5 instead of $ 1.50. The den, the dance-hall,<br/>
the saloon still cast their lurid lights across the<br/>
midnight camp in the rift of the snow-capped<br/>
Rockies, where the army of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jim</span>" Hill is<br/>
fighting the cliffs of the Columbia to build that<br/>
anomalous "water-grade" through the very<br/>
heart of the great mountains.<br/>
<br/>
But, with all their <span style="color: #0000FF;">crudity </span>and cruelty, the<br/>
forces gain their end. There is no mountain<br/>
range on the whole American Continent that<br/>
can to-day strike terror to the heart of the man<br/>
with the transit and the level.<br/>
<br/>
Though ropes will break, men will take long<br/>
chances so long as the world endures. A one-inch<br/>
rope once frayed out along the verge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gunnison </span>Canyon and the Denver & Rio Grande lost<br/>
one of its best young engineers. A little carelessness, a misstep, a tumble, a cry from the black<br/>
ravine-and the songs in the camp are hushed<br/>

"It was impossible to cut the ledge, so they leaned great steel girders<br/>
against the rocks and swung a bridge to <span style="color: #0000FF;">carry </span>the line"<br/>
<br/>
that night. But the spirits of the pioneers are<br/>
elastic, and the work brings swift forgetfulness.<br/>
