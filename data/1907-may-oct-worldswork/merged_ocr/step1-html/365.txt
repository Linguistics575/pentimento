would again stand for something definite, even<br/>
in defeat. And it will be fortunate if the<br/>
Republicans nominate a man who vill fix the<br/>
Roosevelt policies as permanent party doctrines.<br/>
<br/>
IS MR. BRYAN'S NOMINATION A FOREGONE<br/>
CONCLUSION?<br/>
<br/>
T STILL seems likely that Mr. Bryan<br/>
will again be <span style="color: #0000FF;">nominated </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">default</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">simply </span>because his party has no other man.<br/>
Yet very significant protests against such a<br/>
policy are appearing in some of the Southern<br/>
Democratic newspapers. This, for example,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Wilmington (N. C.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">essenger</span>:<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Has</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n't </span>Bryan made as much money and as great <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>reputation out of his candidacy for the Presidency as did<br/>
the man who defeated him? <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>it is money in his pocket<br/>
and increased notoriety to be the candidate, whether elected<br/>
or defeated, why should he hesitate at accepting the nomination if it comes to him with assurance of defeat? If<br/>
Bryan, the third time defeated candidate for President,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>be a bigger man than Bryan the twice defeated man,<br/>
of course he will accept the nomination without regard to<br/>
the possibility of election or certainty of defeat."<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of putting such a protest into<br/>
effect is the lack of an available candidate-as<br/>
yet. There are two kinds of possibilities.<br/>
One is the nomination of such a man as Governor Johnson, of Minnesota, who has been<br/>
twice elected, as a Democrat, in a state that<br/>
has a large normal Republican majority. He<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>plain, honest, vigorous man, a "son of the<br/>
people"; and the suggestion of him is not a<br/>
bad suggestion, in spite of the fact that he has<br/>
had no experience in national affairs. Mr.<br/>
Cleveland had had no experience in national<br/>
affairs when he was elected, and Mr. Lincoln<br/>
and Mr. Roosevelt had had little. Governor<br/>
Johnson <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>, emphatically a tariff-reformer, and<br/>
he <span style="color: #ff0000;">woulu </span>stand on the Tilden-Cleveland<br/>
platform.<br/>
<br/>
The other possibility is the capture of the<br/>
Democratic nomination by Mr. Hearst. Or<br/>
is this an impossibility? Let us hope so. Yet<br/>
few men thought it possible that the Democratic Party in New York would have such a<br/>
fate as to fall into his hands; and, had the<br/>
insurance scandals not occurred, which gave<br/>
Mr. Hughes an unusual advantage, Mr. Hearst<br/>
would probably be the Governor of New York<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day</span>. An abject party is an easier victim<br/>
of the aggressive and unremitting use of money<br/>
and of newspapers than men realize in times<br/>
ot <span style="color: #0000FF;">ovies </span>dignity<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>WHERE OUR WORKING CHARACTER IS<br/>
BREAKING <span style="color: #ff0000;">DOWN<br/>
<br/>
</span>RESIDENT MELLEN, of the New York,<br/>
New Haven and Hartford Railroad<br/>
Company, said a little while ago that, in his<br/>
experience, the efficiency of organized labor<br/>
had of late years become less as wages had<br/>
become higher. This is a startling and discouraging declaration; but it has received <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmation </span>from other men of large experience.<br/>
Some careful students of the census tables of<br/>
manufactures and wages have declared that<br/>
this tendency is more or less general throughout<br/>
our manufacturing activities.<br/>
<br/>
But, after all, the cause is not hard to find.<br/>
We have been passing through an era of labor<br/>
organization when one of the chief purposes<br/>
of the unions has been to make of themselves<br/>
mainly strong fighting machines. A union card<br/>
means that its owner has paid his dues and<br/>
will obey an order to strike. It may or may<br/>
not mean that he is an efficient workman; and<br/>
there is no difference between the card of a<br/>
very good workman and the card of a far less<br/>
good one. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nor</span>, under the rules of most organizations, has a very good workman <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chance to<br/>
earn more money than a far less good one.<br/>
<br/>
In a word, the organization of labor has not<br/>
been wholly on the basis of efficiency in work<br/>
but rather on the basis of loyalty to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">organizations</span>. In a sense, efficiency in work,<br/>
beyond a certain grade, has really been discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Another cause of decline in efficiency is the<br/>
lack of good training in most trades. The<br/>
labor unions have abolished a systematic<br/>
apprentice system, and we have yet developed<br/>
few trade schools where boys are thoroughly<br/>
trained. Thus the lack of thorough systematic training in the first place, and thereafter<br/>
the kind of organization which permits skill<br/>
of the second grade to receive as high wages<br/>
as skill of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class</span>, have discouraged<br/>
the development of the highest efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fact that touches the very foundations of American character and of American<br/>
progress. It should be a subject of the gravest<br/>
concern not only to labor unions, to skilled<br/>
workmen, and to the employers of skilled<br/>
workmen, but to every class of society. It<br/>
means <span style="color: #ff0000;">retrogrcssion</span>. It means-to the extent<br/>
to which inefficiency has increased-a failure<br/>
in our educational and social life.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Mellen, in fact, only put in <span style="color: #0000FF;">concrete<br/>
</span>form what the best students <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>American<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
