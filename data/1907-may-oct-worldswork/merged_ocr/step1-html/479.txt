<br/>
A complete collapse of a city government,<br/>
through corruption or a physical calamity or<br/>
both, seems to suggest the same method of<br/>
escape; and the underlying principle of this<br/>
method is proving itself the saving principle<br/>
in our struggle for good municipal government.<br/>
<br/>
SECTIONAL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SOUTHERN </span>political thought lags very<br/>
far behind Southern activity of other<br/>
kinds. While industrial and educational<br/>
work are vigorous and liberal and courageous and in touch with contemporaneous<br/>
work elsewhere, the discussion of politics goes<br/>
back to a long-dead time. For instance, the<br/>
recurring discussion of nominating a Southern<br/>
man as the Democratic candidate for the<br/>
Presidency provokes such comment as this:<br/>
The New Orleans Picayune says:<br/>
<br/>
"Why shall not the <span style="color: #0000FF;">National </span>Democratic party nominate<br/>
a Southern man for the Presidency? The answer is that it<br/>
would be most unwise, imprudent, and untimely to put up<br/>
a Southern man. It is yet too early to forget that... the Southern States fought a tremendous<br/>
war to establish the national independence of their section."<br/>
<br/>
This kind of political thinking is done in terms<br/>
of more than forty years ago, when only a small<br/>
percentage of the men who will vote next year<br/>
were of age and most of them were not born.<br/>
It ignores all the changes that have taken<br/>
place since. It is very certain that no Presidential campaign could be won with such<br/>
servitude to the past as this. Suppose the<br/>
leaders of education, the builders of railroads,<br/>
of mills, and of cities in the South were to use<br/>
corresponding arguments of despair and<br/>
inactivity-what progress would they make?<br/>
The Civil War of a generation and a half or<br/>
two generations ago has gone completely out of<br/>
the minds of all men except these belated and<br/>
ancient political writers in the South.<br/>
Similarly, the St. Louis Republic:<br/>
<br/>
"But in a measure isolated, formerly by slavery and<br/>
later by conditions incident to a large population of free<br/>
Negroes, the South has little sought the Presidency since the<br/>
'Virginia Dynasty' ended with Monroe. The South has<br/>
wisely preferred to fortify itself against attack by alliance in<br/>
the North and West, and the Southern Democracy in<br/>
National conventions has generally supported available<br/>
candidates belonging to those sections."<br/>
<br/>
This sectional self-consciousness keeps sectionalism in politics alive<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IN </span>THE SENATE 9277<br/>
Of another sort, however, is this true remark<br/>
by the Charleston (S. C.) News and Courier:<br/>
"The South will have no candidate for President until it has a man not afraid of his own<br/>
shadow." And it will not produce such a man<br/>
in politics till its leaders cease to think and to<br/>
talk always of "the South" and cease to be<br/>
burdened with a sectional self-consciousness.<br/>
The truth is, there has never been a better<br/>
chance in our whole political history for a man<br/>
to do a great political service than there now is<br/>
for a Democrat, preferably from some <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southern </span>state, to come forward and claim the nomination-the right kind of man on the right<br/>
kind of platform. He must be national in his<br/>
thought. He must have no sectional selfconsciousness. He must leave the war <span style="color: #0000FF;">alone-a </span>war that ended before he became of age.<br/>
He must talk of something else besides the<br/>
"Negro problem." He must have a program of interest and of justice to men alike in<br/>
Maine and in Georgia, in Minnesota and in<br/>
Oregon. He must not "be afraid of his<br/>
shadow,<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>nor of Mr. Bryan, nor of the backward Southern political press. He must speak<br/>
the language of Tilden and of Cleveland, and<br/>
this must be also his own language. The<br/>
nomination of such a man might not lead to his<br/>
election next year (who is sure that any Democrat can be elected next year P), but it would<br/>
bring the party and the South out of the utterly<br/>
hopeless death-valley of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-conscious </span>sectionalism; and that would be a great gain.<br/>

CHANGES <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>PERSONNEL IN THE SENATE<br/>
<br/>
HE death of Senator Pettus, of Alabama,<br/>
at the age of eighty-six, following close<br/>
upon the death of his colleague, Senator Morgan, at the age of eighty-three, and this in turn<br/>
following the resignation of Senator Spooner,<br/>
of Wisconsin, who was among the strongest of<br/>
the Senators of recent times, <span style="color: #ff0000;">remindsthe </span>country<br/>
of the almost sudden change that will take place<br/>
in the leadership of the Senate. Among the<br/>
aged members now <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>Senator Allison, of<br/>
Iowa, seventy-eight; Senator Teller, of Colorado, seventy-seven; Senator Cullom, of<br/>
Illinois, seventy-eight; Senator Frye, of Maine,<br/>
seventy-six; the two Senators from New York,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy-three </span>and seventy-four; Senator Proctor, of Vermont, seventy-six; and Senator<br/>
Whyte, of Maryland, eighty-three. These are<br/>
not all yet feeble by reason of age, but they<br/>
are all old men and the period of activity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>most of <span style="color: #0000FF;">them </span>will soon end.<br/>
