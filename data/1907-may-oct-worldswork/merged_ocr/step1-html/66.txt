<br/>
</span>This is what is meant by the announcement<br/>
"sales by inch of candle." Bids were received<br/>
as the candle burned from pin to pin-quick<br/>
work, for the candle was a pencil-like thing.<br/>
The last bid was the one before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flame </span>went<br/>
out; and to that bidder went the furs. March,<br/>
January, and November seem always to have<br/>
been the favorite months for the fur sales in<br/>
London. The furs sold were not necessarily<br/>
those recently come to market. It was a<br/>
trick, <span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span>a clairvoyant sixth sense, to scent<br/>
the coming vagaries of fashion, and when a<br/>
rare fur was down in price to buy it up and<br/>
store it in warehouses till fashion's pendulum<br/>
swung round again, when out would come the<br/>
same raw furs to be auctioned at a higher price.<br/>
<br/>
THE FUR FAIRS IN GERMANY AND RUSSIA<br/>
<br/>
The Leipsic fur sales took the <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span>of a<br/>
great Fur Fair at Easter. Booths go up like<br/>
mushrooms. Warehouses that have been close<br/>
as dungeons for the year, hiding secrets of<br/>
famous dyeing processes from rivals and which<br/>
no one can enter or leave without being searched,<br/>
not even trusted workers, now open to the<br/>
public like a flower to spring. Thither <span style="color: #0000FF;">flock<br/>
</span>buyers and sellers from America, from Persia,<br/>
from China, from Siberia, from Japan, from<br/>
Tibet, from England, from South America.<br/>
Quaint costumes are seen in the streets. For two<br/>
weeks the fair lasts, a curious relic of bygone<br/>
customs come down to modern days. The<br/>
broker is an expert at haggling, the seller at<br/>
holding off, so that as merry a game of bartering goes on as with the fish-wife who comes to<br/>
market at four in the morning that she may<br/>
have the pleasure of refusing customers till<br/>
mid-day.<br/>
<br/>
Why should Germany, which is not one of<br/>
the great fur producers, be famed as a market<br/>
for furs? The secret is in the dyeing and<br/>
dressing. Whole hamlets and towns are given<br/>
over to the dressing of raw furs. Austria and<br/>
Russia produce the best squirrel skins for<br/>
linings in the world; but the skins from both<br/>
must be sent to Germany to be dressed. Sometimes the secret is in getting the oil out of the<br/>
pelt without <span style="color: #0000FF;">tingeing </span>the white fur yellow, as<br/>
in the case of ermine and white fox and Polar<br/>
bear. Again, other dressers polish the furs<br/>
with inferior grease instead of butter; or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deodorize </span>them imperfectly instead of tramping with mahogany sawdust. Other raw fur<br/>
fairs are held in Germany, but they are for<br/>
the local product, not the world market.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">FUR </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TRADE </span>OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
In Russia, fairs are also the method of selling<br/>
raw furs: at Irbit in February, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ischim </span>in<br/>
December, at Nijni Novgorod in August.<br/>
And to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiatka</span>, on the border of China, bluegowned mandarins and merchant princes and<br/>
Chinese nobles still come for the ermine and<br/>
the marten and the sable of Siberian wilds,<br/>
as their ancestors came two hundred years ago<br/>
to barter with wild Cossacks and Siberian<br/>
bandits and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chuckchee </span>traders and Alaskan<br/>
sea otter hunters. China produces very few<br/>
furs and those of poor quality; but the Chinese<br/>
grandee has as great a passion for fine fur<br/>
trimmings as the London grand dame for<br/>
Jager diamonds and Burman rubies. Long<br/>
before the western world had awakened to the<br/>
beauty of seal and sea otter, there was a <span style="color: #ff0000;">highpriced </span>market for both in China<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>But the great fair of the year in Russia-the<br/>
one which is a world market-is at Nijni.<br/>
For a year, by <span style="color: #ff0000;">flat-bottom </span>raft boats, by reindeer sled, and by long dusty Persian caravan,<br/>
the furs have been on their way to Nijni. The<br/>
little place doubles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">quadruple </span>in size like<br/>
a mushroom city. By August, the fair is<br/>
open. Here, chiefly, are sold the furs of Asia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-Persian </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Astracan </span>lamb, Mongolian<br/>
goat, Siberian sable and ermine, the great<br/>
timber wolf, the rare squirrel-skin <span style="color: #0000FF;">linings-gray </span>almost to silver, or black and glossy as<br/>
jet-and the few, the very few of the diminishing sea otter and seal. There, as Kipling says<br/>
of the Suez, East and West meet-the furs<br/>
brought down by canoe and dog-train from the<br/>
Canadian Northwest jostle with the pelts<br/>
brought by reindeer and caravan from Siberia<br/>
and Persia.<br/>
<br/>
FUR-HUNTING AS A ROMANCE<br/>
<br/>
To describe the picturesque side of such a<br/>
fair and all it means would require an article<br/>
by itself. Take, for instance, a piece of fine<br/>
wood marten from America. If it be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine<br/>
</span>specimen-dark, deep, glossy-the chances are<br/>
that it is from the far North; for the farther<br/>
north the better the fur. The only woods in<br/>
the far North are on the slopes of the Rockies.<br/>
Well, then, your trapper for this piece of fur has<br/>
set out in summer from a fur post for his <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter </span>hunting grounds. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>part of his<br/>
journey would be by canoe against stream-except for the hard work of portaging provisions over rough tracts--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-sheer </span>joy to every<br/>
trapper that tramps the wilds. Then summer<br/>
gives place to autumn. Ice edges along <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
