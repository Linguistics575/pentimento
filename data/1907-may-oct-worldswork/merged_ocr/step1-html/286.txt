<br/>
from the army and began the great work of his<br/>
life in Egypt, though his continuous service<br/>
dates from 1884.<br/>
<br/>
"When I came to Egypt," he once said to<br/>
a friend, "I made up my mind that the work<br/>
was big enough for the life of one man, and that<br/>
I would devote my life to it and not ask promotion or take promotion until I had made<br/>
it a complete success." And even the proffer<br/>
of a Cabinet position did not change his<br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
One of the great factors in his success has<br/>
been his thorough honesty. In the reorganization of the country's finance, in the distribution of office, in the expenditure of public<br/>
money, and in many other ways, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">undoubtedly<br/>
</span>had opportunities a-plenty for enriching <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself-which </span>Egypt expected him to do. But<br/>
at the close of a quarter-century, he left Egypt<br/>
with his integrity unimpeached. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>idea<br/>
that Lord Cromer would allow any suspicious<br/>
deal whatever," remarked a native connected<br/>
with the financial board, "is so absolutely<br/>
impossible that one does not stop even to consider it." This is a remarkable statement,<br/>
especially since it is repeated by a Frenchman,<br/>
whose sympathies would naturally lead him<br/>
to be skeptical. It seems to be a fact that<br/>
whenever the interests of Egypt clashed with<br/>
those of England, Cromer always decided in<br/>
favor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-and </span>the home Government<br/>
allowed him to do so. His administrative<br/>
policy was admirably stated by Lord Milner<br/>
some years ago: "The application of a reasonable amount of common sense and common<br/>
honesty to a country ruined by the absence of<br/>
both."<br/>
<br/>
THE PERSONALITY OF LORD CROMER<br/>
<br/>
When it is remembered that Lord Cromer<br/>
has had constant diplomatic relations with<br/>
three widely differing nationalities-the native,<br/>
the Frenchman, and his own countrymen-it<br/>
is perhaps not to be wondered at that he should<br/>
have suffered adverse criticism at times. Men<br/>
occasionally went to his office expecting to<br/>
meet a diplomat, with bland, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unctuous</span>, Oriental<br/>
manners; they found an Anglo-Saxon, plain<br/>
and blunt. Matter-of-fact, he undoubtedly is<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>he has carried burdens enough to drive<br/>
affability from the most genial temperament.<br/>
Hard to get along with, some have said; but<br/>
the records of the long service of his English<br/>
associates argue against this.<br/>
<br/>
"He is not a man after the heart of an inter<br/>

<br/>
</span>viewer," remarks a writer with a wide<br/>
experience. "If he allows one question<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>it is useless to ask two. From the first he<br/>
grasps exactly what you desire to learn, and if<br/>
he vouchsafes a reply it is given clearly and<br/>
without superfluous words." But the writer<br/>
adds that his voice is soft, his manner simple,<br/>
and his personality charming. One of his<br/>
own countrymen who has known him intimately<br/>
for thirty years declares that he is one of the<br/>
gentlest and most kind-hearted of men.<br/>
<br/>
To the end of his long service in the midst<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Oriental peoples, Cromer remained an<br/>
Englishman. Others of his countrymen have<br/>
become Orientalized, but not Cromer. You<br/>
will look long before you find a photograph of<br/>
him in Turkish garb, with decorations scattered<br/>
all over his breast. And yet the initials of<br/>
the distinctions that have come to him would<br/>
extend more than across a page.<br/>
<br/>
His retirement from his high office was purely<br/>
voluntary, in spite of the fact that it was based<br/>
on the familiar ground of "ill-health." He<br/>
made it very clear in his letter of resignation<br/>
that no political considerations whatever entered<br/>
into the case.<br/>
<br/>
"After spending forty-nine years in the<br/>
Government's service," he said, "I am thoroughly worn out, and really unable to support<br/>
any longer the excessive strain which my work<br/>
here <span style="color: #0000FF;">entails</span>."<br/>
<br/>
THE FUTURE OF EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
Egypt without Cromer does not mean Egypt<br/>
without England. The British "occupation"<br/>
not only continues, but continues along the<br/>
line of the same policies that have brought<br/>
the land to its present high estate. This was<br/>
clearly stated by the Foreign Secretary after<br/>
reading Lord Cromer's resignation to the House<br/>
of Lords, and was shown with equal <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearness<br/>
</span>by the appointment of Sir Eldon Gorst to<br/>
succeed him. Sir Eldon, who has been in the<br/>
diplomatic and colonial service since the age<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-four </span>(he is now forty-seven), has<br/>
spent most of his public life in Egypt. As<br/>
financial adviser to Lord Cromer, he has<br/>
helped to formulate his policies almost from<br/>
the beginning and is in hearty accord with the<br/>
plans now in process of execution. It is his<br/>
task, first, to build the superstructure upon the<br/>
Cromer foundation-just as the engineers are<br/>
preparing to add twenty feet to the height of<br/>
the great dam at Assouan. A more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult<br/>
</span>task awaits him in the future, the guiding of<br/>
<br/>
