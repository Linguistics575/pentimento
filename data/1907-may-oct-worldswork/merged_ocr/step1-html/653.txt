<span>DANCING AS A PART OF EDUCATION<br/>
<br/>
face (that do not slap), the quaint cajolery, the<br/>
dignified ceremoniousness, the whole gamut<br/>
of mimic social life.<br/>
<br/>
The music, too, is always appropriate. It<br/>
is the music that has grown up with the dance<br/>
and belongs to it-the strange harmonies and<br/>
peculiar rhythm of a Slavic <span style="color: #ff0000;">chardos</span>; the<br/>
spirited, sharply accented air, with the bagpipe drone imitated in the bass, of "the Highland <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ling</span>."<br/>
<br/>
The fun does not last for more than twenty<br/>
minutes, and another group of girls, waiting<br/>
their turns, takes the places of the dancers.<br/>
But the children have something to carry home<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">them-a </span>really significant experience.<br/>
The noisy, crowded street and the dingy<br/>
tenement will be happier places because of the<br/>
healthy, full-blooded rhythm that still pulsates<br/>
through their bodies-and through their souls,<br/>
too; for it means that they have a new feeling<br/>
about life: it is "the little white bird" that is<br/>
going to keep on singing in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
At least that is what those of us who have<br/>
watched developments closely are beginning<br/>
to believe. And if this is true in New York,<br/>
the very storm centre of our civilization, the<br/>
place where our national ideals are most<br/>
relentlessly brought to bay, where every fallacy<br/>
is most pitilessly forced to light in the working<br/>
out of a new social order, then it is certain that<br/>
the movement will reach out to the children<br/>
of other cities as well.<br/>
<br/>
For all those who have interested themselves<br/>
in this new movement, it has been a revelation. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">school-teachers </span>who first volunteered to give up an hour a week of their precious time to learning folk-dances and to teaching them to squads of children did so because<br/>
they thought it would be a good thing for the<br/>
girls. Many of them have since declared<br/>
that the dancing-hour is the hour in the week<br/>
to which they themselves most eagerly look<br/>
forward; that it does them more good, and<br/>
somehow means more to them than anything<br/>
else they have undertaken.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient Greeks understood the significance of these things better than we. In their<br/>
eyes the body and the mind were a unity,<br/>
inseparable, interdependent, to be developed<br/>
and perfected together, and in no other way.<br/>
In the education of every Athenian youth,<br/>
music, athletic training, and dancing had a<br/>
part. The theory is beautifully stated in one<br/>
of Plato's dialogues: "Rhythm and harmony<br/>
are made familiar to the souls of the youths,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">945I<br/>
<br/>
</span>that they may grow more gentle and graceful<br/>
and harmonious, and so be of service both in<br/>
words and deeds; for the whole life of man<br/>
stands in need of grace and of harmony."<br/>
<br/>
Rhythm is a fundamental principle of life,<br/>
perhaps the most fundamental. The stars<br/>
swing through heaven in rhythmical relations<br/>
with one another; the sea <span style="color: #0000FF;">rise </span>and falls in<br/>
rhythm; the human heart keeps its measured<br/>
pulsations in the very centre of our being. All<br/>
our normal bodily functions work best in<br/>
rhythm. In poetry, in music, in everything<br/>
that man knows that is highest and most<br/>
beautiful, in all the supreme products of his<br/>
imagination, there is still to be found some<br/>
expression of this eternal principle.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it is not the intellect, the part of us that<br/>
understands, so much as it is the body, the part<br/>
of us that feels, which responds and vibrates<br/>
in the most vivid unison with this principle.<br/>
And it is the body which has always first<br/>
sought to show it forth, to make assertion of<br/>
it, to put itself actively into sympathy with it.<br/>
<br/>
Dancing is an expression of this desire. It<br/>
is the most primitive of the arts. The rudest<br/>
savages practise it, making it an essential element in every religious observance, in every<br/>
festival of the tribe. Their emotions inevitably<br/>
take form-give themselves concreteness and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">actuality-through </span>the dance. Marriage,<br/>
death, harvest, spring, rain, every stirring event<br/>
of tribal existence is so celebrated. It is a<br/>
universal language.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is a commonplace of psychology that,<br/>
after a fashion, every child repeats in his own<br/>
individual development the long history of the<br/>
development of the human race. He is the<br/>
human race in miniature.<br/>
<br/>
Logic would lead us to expect that the<br/>
emotional life of the child would seek to embody itself in some of the same forms that are<br/>
normal and instinctive to <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncivilized </span>peoples.<br/>
And this is exactly what we find to be true.<br/>
<br/>
Childhood is the time when the physical<br/>
nature is most sensitive to rhythmical movement. Children love even the meaningless<br/>
swing of <span style="color: #ff0000;">f<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Ene, m√©-ne, mi-ne, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ma</span>"<br/>
The words which the Australian uses in his<br/>
tribal dances, so anthropologists tell us, often<br/>
make no coherent sense at all; for everything<br/>
has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificed </span>to the rhythmic accent.<br/>
<br/>
Our modern little folks, so hilariously<br/>
singing:<br/>
<br/>
"A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket,<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
