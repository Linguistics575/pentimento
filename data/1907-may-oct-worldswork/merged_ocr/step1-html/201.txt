horse-power when the turbines are installed.<br/>
It is claimed that this power can be sent by<br/>
transmission lines as far as Fayetteville, 80<br/>
miles away. Charlotte, Greensboro, and Concord, the largest mill centres in <span style="color: #0000FF;">North </span>Carolina,<br/>
and innumerable smaller towns are within half<br/>
that distance. The Southern Power Company<br/>
has about a dozen <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-power </span>plants, which<br/>
when they are finished will furnish power from<br/>
Concord and Taylorsville in North Carolina<br/>

The city of Augusta pays less than $ 10 per<br/>
horse-power for hydro-electric power. At the<br/>
present time a mill can buy it from the<br/>
Southern Power Company for $ 20 a horsepower a year. An auxiliary steam plant is<br/>
necessary for heating and <span style="color: #0000FF;">humidifying</span>, and<br/>
there is some small danger that an accident to<br/>
the transmission lines would cause a loss of<br/>
time in the mill. On the other hand, when<br/>
buying from the power companies, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>mills will only pay for what they <span style="color: #0000FF;">actually<br/>

<br/>
Their transmission lines in this territory will<br/>
be accessible to more than half the mills in<br/>
the South. In Georgia and Alabama, also,<br/>
the rivers are being harnessed.<br/>
<br/>
"This is equivalent," said a mill president<br/>
in Charlotte, "to the discovery of an inexhaustible coal supply east of the mountains." <span style="color: #0000FF;">Before<br/>
</span>these great power companies began operations,<br/>
mills not situated on streams either used the<br/>
power of the steam engine direct or used the<br/>
steam engine to generate electricity; with coal<br/>
selling from $ 3.75 to $ 4 a ton, it cost them<br/>
<br/>
use. With a steam plant, it costs almost<br/>
as much to run half the machinery as it does<br/>
for all of it.<br/>
<br/>
Those mills which find steam power cheaper<br/>
or more convenient than power from the<br/>
transmission lines will not be affected by the<br/>
rates of the power companies, but the presence<br/>
of the transmission lines gives every mill in<br/>
this great section a low price for power above<br/>
which they do not have to go. Mr. E. A.<br/>
Smith, the president of the Dover Mills at<br/>
Pineville, N. C., says:<br/>
