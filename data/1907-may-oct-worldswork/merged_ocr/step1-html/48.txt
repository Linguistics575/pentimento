</span>HAUNTS: A COW-MOOSE<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">cow-moose </span>allowed the moving-picture machine, mounted on the bow of a canoe, to approach <span style="color: #0000FF;">within<br/>
</span>When she did move, she made such speed that she got out of the field of the camera.<br/>
<br/>
This accounts for the short break in the series, as it required some seconds to swing the canoe and bring <span style="color: #0000FF;">her<br/>
</span>Then she came straight toward the canoe, which was pushed against the bank. She<br/>
<br/>
was <span style="color: #ff0000;">ssithin </span>ten or twelve feet of the camera before she became frightened again and ran in the opposite direction<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
