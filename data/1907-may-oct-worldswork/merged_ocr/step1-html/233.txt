which were till a few years ago sleepy political<br/>
villages, it may be said of Columbia, S. C., also,<br/>
which lies half way up to the hill-country, that<br/>
it is becoming an active business centre. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manufacturing </span>and banking give it advancing rank.<br/>
<br/>
SAVANNAH<br/>
<br/>
Savannah is one of the most beautiful old<br/>
cities in the Union. It was laid out not only<br/>
with wide streets, but with a succession of<br/>
beautiful squares at their intersections, and in<br/>
these squares are statues, commemorating<br/>
chiefly Revolutionary heroes-Sergeant Jasper,<br/>
General Nathanael Green, and Pulaski.<br/>
<br/>
One of the few monuments in the South to<br/>
an industrial leader stands in one of the squares<br/>
of Savannah. The interesting inscription is<br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">WILLIAM </span>WASHINGTON GORDON, born June 17, 1796;<br/>
died March 20, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1842</span>. The pioneer of works of internal<br/>
improvement in his native state and first president of the<br/>
Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia, to<br/>
which he gave <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>time, <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>talents, and finally his life.<br/>
<br/>
"Erected 1882 by the Central Railroad and Banking<br/>
Company of Georgia in honor of a brave man, a faithful<br/>
and devoted officer, and to preserve his name in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">grateful </span>remembrance of his fellow citizens."<br/>
<br/>
In several ways, Savannah <span style="color: #0000FF;">typifies </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wcll</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">balanced </span>combination which should be the<br/>
ideal development of all the old Southern<br/>
cities, of social and financial conservatism,<br/>
and the methods of modern life. They <span style="color: #ff0000;">boast<br/>
</span>of the security of their banking institutions,<br/>
not one of which for fifty years has failed. They<br/>
do not boast of their "hustle," and yet there<br/>
is the energy of a modern city there. The<br/>
old social structure has gradually yielded to<br/>
the new life of the town, maintaining its oldtime pride, sometimes under discouraging circumstances, but always giving its flavor of<br/>
dignity to the whole social structure. It is<br/>
a city that possesses a distinct character of its<br/>
own, a character that compels your respect.<br/>
It has, for instance, a public art <span style="color: #0000FF;">gallery</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
spirit of the place is admirably illustrated by<br/>
these two facts: that the people have a veneration for every old building and every historic<br/>
association, but within a stone's throw of<br/>
Colonial houses there has been built one of<br/>
the most attractive and well-appointed railroad<br/>
stations to be found anywhere.'<br/>
<br/>
The full meaning of the water-power of the<br/>
Appalachian streams has not been dreamed<br/>
of by the public-or what their full power will<br/>
mean if the mountain forests are preserved.<br/>
<br/>
But a suggestion of it is given at Savannah,<br/>
Ga. The city owns a nine-mile canal, of<br/>
14,000 horse-power. There is a large group<br/>
of big cotton mills there and<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>others nearby;<br/>
for Augusta is one of the great centres of this<br/>
industry. Power is sold for about $ 5.50 per<br/>
horse-power per year, which is one of the<br/>
cheapest rates, in great quantities, to be found<br/>
anywhere. Yet this mill community has<br/>
become also a famous winter resort; for the<br/>
beautiful old city shows the lavish plan and<br/>
wisdom of its first builders-a street 180 feet<br/>
wide with rows of trees in the middle. The<br/>
modern city has proved worthy of this spacious<br/>
plan. For instance, it is spending large sums<br/>
in making macadam roads. It retains, too,<br/>
the flavor of its old-timc social character.<br/>
<br/>
THE TRADE SCHOOLS OF COLUMBUS, GA.<br/>
<br/>
In Columbus, Ga., there are cotton and<br/>
woolen mills with 188,000 spindles and more<br/>
than 4,000 looms. There has been worked<br/>
out there an educational system that stands<br/>
like a beacon to all manufacturing communities.<br/>
In Phenix City and Girard, across the Chattahoochee River, live the 1,500 operatives of the<br/>
Eagle and Phenix Mills, whose lives touch as<br/>
many as 6,000 individuals. The mills support<br/>
in these towns free kindergartens in large <span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings</span>, steam-heated, lighted by great windows<br/>
which command a magnificent view of the<br/>
river, and are thoroughly equipped. Near each<br/>
kindergarten is a gymnasium with walls of<br/>
lattice work and floor of fine white sand.<br/>
Swings, joggle-boards, and toboggans placed<br/>
in the yards give out-of-door exercise. The<br/>
kindergartens teach horticulture, and the<br/>
flower and vegetable gardens about the buildings are cultivated by the children. Competent teachers are employed, and two of them<br/>
are sent by the mills every summer to normal<br/>
schools. These free kindergartens are always<br/>
filled, and "mothers' days" are joyously <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span>by old and young. The development<br/>
of the mill child who outgrows the kindergarten<br/>
is continued at the Primary Industrial School,<br/>
a beautiful structure in Columbus, supported<br/>
by the city, and having an attendance of nearly<br/>
one hundred mill children. Here are taught,<br/>
besides the elementary studies, handicrafts,<br/>
horticulture, and industrial subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. G. Gunby Jordan, the president of the<br/>
Eagle and Phenix Mills, is also president of the<br/>
Columbus school board. Free kindergartens<br/>
are a part of every elementary school, white and<br/>
<br/>
