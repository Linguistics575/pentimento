to progress; from a condition in which the<br/>
banks had to "run" the farmers to the condition where the farmers "run" the banks.<br/>
The mills have meant $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3,7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000 </span>a year to<br/>
the county, in money. They mean much<br/>
more than this in human progress. There are<br/>
20,000 people in the mill village, most of whom<br/>
have been brought out of the loneliness of farm<br/>
life or the isolation of the mountains into touch<br/>
with progress. Mr. Arthur Shadwell, the<br/>
English economist, in his book entitled "<span style="color: #ff0000;">IndustrialEfficiency</span>," says of the Southern mills:<br/>
<br/>
"The conditions of life are by no means so bad as might<br/>
be inferred from the wages and the hours and absence of<br/>
factory laws. They are, in fact, better than in the more<br/>
'advanced' communities in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">North</span>. I have not said<br/>
anything about <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cost </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">livingin </span>America.... but<br/>
the difference between North and South is so great "as to<br/>
more than counterbalance the difference in earnings. And<br/>
in regard to other external conditions, the advantage<br/>
lies equally with the South. Life is rural, not urban, in<br/>
these mill settlements: there is none of the squalor and<br/>
congestion of the town; the people live close to their work<br/>
amid surroundings which are often charming and sometimes ideal-veritable garden cities. Such a one is Pelzer<br/>
in South Carolina. It has a population of 7,000 to 8,000,<br/>
which has grown around the mills in 20 years. The<br/>
business was started in 1881, with one mill containing<br/>
10,000 spindles; there are now four containing <span style="color: #0000FF;">130,000<br/>
</span>spindles and 3,600 looms, and giving employment to 3,000<br/>
hands.<br/>
<br/>
"The people have good houses, for which they <span style="color: #0000FF;">pay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">8<br/>
</span>shillings ($ 2) a month rent, churches of various denominations, schools, and stores, where they can buy every<br/>
necessity good and cheap. It is all set among fir trees<br/>
in very pretty country. No liquor is sold in the place.<br/>
These people are not badly off or discontented; they have<br/>
Â£20,000 ($ <span style="color: #ff0000;">100,000</span>) in the savings bank and get 4 per cent.<br/>
on it. I nowhere found any local feeling against the mills<br/>
which have brought work and wages."<br/>
<br/>
This is a more favorable report of the lives of<br/>
the operatives than most of the mill men give.<br/>
In many places the operatives do not live well.<br/>
But they live better than they did in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">narrow </span>isolation of their mountain homes; and<br/>
the opportunity for further improvement is<br/>
more valuable than the progress already made.<br/>
<br/>
"Thirty years ago," said an old resident of<br/>
Spartanburg, "our people knew how to raise<br/>
money on farm property and they could put<br/>
a chattel mortgage on a bull, and that is about<br/>
all they knew about brokerage." Last year<br/>
a broker made $ 30,000 dealing in real estate<br/>
and stocks and bonds. When that man came<br/>
to Spartanburg eight years ago, he had never<br/>
seen a draft. The money he used in doing<br/>
<br/>
THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
this was part of the $ 23,750,000 yearly increased income which the mills have brought<br/>
to Spartanburg County. The $ 1,000,000 of<br/>
capital and surplus and the $ 2,000,000 of<br/>
deposits of the Spartanburg banks are chiefly<br/>
due to the increased prosperity brought by the<br/>
mills.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the smokestacks have made<br/>
Spartanburg. And Spartanburg is but one<br/>
place in many. The Piedmont country from<br/>
Virginia to Alabama is being transformed.<br/>
<br/>
In 1850 there died in Spartanburg an old<br/>
bachelor who preached on Sundays and who,<br/>
by trading the other six days in the week, had<br/>
made a fortune and gained a reputation for<br/>
parsimony among his more easy-going <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbors</span>. Thus, the Rev. Benjamin Wofford left<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">100,000 </span>to found a college. For the last<br/>
fifty years, the dominant figure at the college<br/>
has been Dr. James H. Carlisle. Without<br/>
either money or political power, this old man,<br/>
by the strength of his character, has kept<br/>
education in its broadest sense alive, even in<br/>
the extreme poverty of the people just after<br/>
the war, and has saved it from being swamped<br/>
by the successful commercialism of the present<br/>
time. I heard one man ask another what he<br/>
had studied under Dr. Carlisle. "Astronomy,"<br/>
was the answer. "Did you learn any thing?"<br/>
the first one asked. "Yes," answered the<br/>
other, "I learned to be a man." A Texas<br/>
ranchman who had studied under Dr. Carlisle<br/>
told a friend from home that he had tried to go<br/>
to the devil for ten years and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Doctor's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">forefir1ger </span>had kept him straight; and he<br/>
wanted his friend when he got back to tell the<br/>
Doctor what a h-l of a man he was.<br/>
<br/>
There is no commercial standard in which<br/>
the influence of Dr. Carlisle and of Wofford<br/>
College can be measured. While I was in<br/>
Spartanburg at the hotel, there was a man<br/>
there who was trying to hire a house. He had<br/>
moved his family from an adjoining county<br/>
while his son should go to college. The president of Wofford told me of another man who<br/>
had sold his business in Richland and moved<br/>
to Spartanburg for the same reason. Many<br/>
graduates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wofford</span>, who come from other<br/>
parts of South Carolina and from other states,<br/>
settle in Spartanburg. Almost all the bank<br/>
presidents, their assistants, and many of the<br/>
cotton-mill men and merchants in the town are<br/>
Wofford graduates. Not one of these men<br/>
ever heard street-paving mentioned in a classroom. Yet the good streets of Spartanburg<br/>
