<br/>
lumber road should have. Even so, the grade<br/>
on this part of the line ran up as high as seventy<br/>
feet to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mile-mot </span>at all an economical<br/>
grade. The line has been built on to Mullins,<br/>
58 miles from Deepwater, the latter <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>being somewhat better than the old line.<br/>
Surveys are through the mountains. Princeton, <span style="color: #ff0000;">350 </span>miles from Norfolk, is to be a sort of<br/>
centre for the system. The coal brought down<br/>
by the line that runs north and west from here<br/>
will be made up at that point into through<br/>
trains for the run to Norfolk. Princeton is to<br/>
be one of the important railroad towns of West<br/>
Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
The work is tremendous. In a ten-mile<br/>
section of the road near East River, there are<br/>
five tunnels, many deep rock cuttings, and one<br/>
bridge 2,100 feet in length. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">building </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the line requires the moving of millions of cubic<br/>
yards of rock and earth. The forces have<br/>
gone ahead, apparently, without regard to cost.<br/>
The road is to be laid with American Standard<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">85-pound </span>rails, and ballasted with crushed<br/>
rock in pieces not less than three-quarters of<br/>
an inch nor more than two and one-half inches<br/>
in diameter. Everything about the road is<br/>
solid, heavy, and high-class.<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean to West Virginia and to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Virginia</span>? Will it threaten the life of the Norfolk & Western or the Chesapeake & Ohio?<br/>
Will it bring competition to the shippers of coal<br/>
from the Pocahontas fields? These are the biggest railroad questions of the day in the South.<br/>
<br/>
To answer them one must look carefully at<br/>
the business of railroading in those states. A<br/>
coal road, say the Norfolk & Western, gets<br/>
its coal from mines that are located exactly on<br/>
the line of the Norfolk & Western. No railroad that runs a line five miles away from that<br/>
mine can get any of its coal to <span style="color: #0000FF;">carry</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>There<br/>
are four or five points on the Norfolk & Western<br/>
where its coal traffic can be reached by the new<br/>
line, but not more than that. It hardly reaches<br/>
the mines on the Chesapeake & Ohio at all.<br/>
For miscellaneous freight from the seaboard<br/>
into the mountain country it will, of course,<br/>
compete directly with both these railroads and<br/>
also with the Baltimore & Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
The fact of the matter is that the new line<br/>
runs through an untouched section of West<br/>
Virginia. It will have to create its own coal<br/>
mines, not directly nor indirectly owned, for<br/>
that is against the new rate law, but served<br/>
entirely by the new road. Men who have<br/>
owned coal lands that could not be developed<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
because there was no railroad, will open them<br/>
to feed the new road. Men who are directors<br/>
of the new road are said to own great areas of<br/>
coal lands, bought for little because they were<br/>
not reached by the Norfolk & Western or the<br/>
Chesapeake & Ohio. These lands will be<br/>
opened. This very opening of the untouched<br/>
areas will people those areas with a new population. Coal cannot be mined without men to<br/>
do the work. Naturally the creation of a huge<br/>
industry, sufficient to keep alive a road that<br/>
costs as much as this road, will of itself create<br/>
new <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>to be carried from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seaboard </span>to the<br/>
mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning in 1904, the Norfolk & Western<br/>
has spent or will spend about $ 20,000,000 to<br/>
bring the line to a new standard. Detours<br/>
are built around cities, bridges across chasms<br/>
take the place of long circuitous climbs, tunnels piercing the hills replace zigzag lines<br/>
along the cliffs, great valleys are filled up with<br/>
earth and rocks to save a few feet of climb.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main objects of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">tremenduous<br/>
</span>work is to make the Norfolk & Western a<br/>
fit passenger railroad to serve the sections<br/>
which it has peopled. In the first place, it<br/>
was a freight railroad and no fast passenger<br/>
service was attempted. As the country has<br/>
grown, the demand for a passenger service has<br/>
grown with it.<br/>
<br/>
There are several more or less certain consolidations now under way in the South. The<br/>
Norfolk & Southern, under new control, is<br/>
in union with the Raleigh & Pamlico South,<br/>
the Virginia & Carolina Coast, and the Atlantic<br/>
& North Carolina, and has over 150 miles<br/>
of road in contemplation. Mr. John Skelton<br/>
Williams, formerly the president of the Seaboard Air Line, has a <span style="color: #0000FF;">plan </span>to consolidate half<br/>
a dozen small roads and build a few links between them to create a new line running from<br/>
northeast to southwest, from the manufacturing region of North Carolina to the Gulf of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">exieo</span>. The project is destined to strike<br/>
at the main line of the Seaboard Air Line, the<br/>
Atlantic Coast Line, and the Southern Railway.<br/>
<br/>
The railroad development going on in the<br/>
Southwest cannot be handled in this article.<br/>
It is of great importance, and its scope is wider<br/>
than the building under way in the eastern<br/>
section. The old South, it will be seen, is<br/>
ripe for an era of progress. If the people of<br/>
the South cooperate with the railroad pioneers,<br/>
no man may foretell the railroad future of this<br/>
region.<br/>
