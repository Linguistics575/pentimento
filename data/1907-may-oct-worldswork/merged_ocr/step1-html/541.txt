<span>JAPAN'S WAR TAX AND POVERTY<br/>

carriages, organizing to keep out newcomers<br/>
and to protect themselves. They felt that the<br/>
60,000 able-bodied'rickshaw men of Tokyo<br/>
ought to make themselves a force to be reckoned<br/>
with. Taki was not a member of the new<br/>
union, and was not desired.<br/>
<br/>
One day Taki bethought himself of Harris,<br/>
the rugged young Englishman employed on the<br/>
staff of the Japan Times, a daily newspaper<br/>
published in English. When Harris had lived<br/>
in the neighboring village of Kanagawa, Taki<br/>
had been his'rickshaw <span style="color: #0000FF;">coolie</span>. So Taki went<br/>
to the very British Harris, and after many<br/>
bows and felicitations stated his condition and<br/>
asked the "honorable" writer's advice. Harris<br/>
said to him:<br/>
<br/>
"Shobe, your condition is that of thousands<br/>
of your comrades; everywhere your countrymen are suffering; in several provinces they<br/>
are dying of starvation. Japan is weak with<br/>
exhaustion; it finished the war on nerve.<br/>
You and your fellows must go on paying the<br/>
price of victory. Peace will be harder than war<br/>
for many years to come, and all Japan-men,<br/>
women and children-must suffer together.<br/>
Japan has puffed out its chest and feels that it<br/>
must maintain the expansion; it will be a hard<br/>
business. I am sorry for you, Taki. Here are<br/>
five yen ($ 2.50). It is all that I can afford.<br/>
Please do not come again, for you are but one<br/>
of many good friends in equal distress."<br/>
<br/>
Taki prostrated himself with thanks and left<br/>
broken-hearted. He felt that Harris had<br/>
spoken all too truly.<br/>
<br/>
He clung desperately to his five yen while he<br/>
hunted employment. Everywhere he met veterans in the same straits. Taki and two other<br/>
soldiers pooled their little capital and rented<br/>
a tiny house in a street in the Shitaya quarter.<br/>
This street, occupied by the poorest of the poor,<br/>
is filled by 2,000 houses separated by alleys<br/>
crossing one another at right angles. One<br/>
large house under one long low roof is divided<br/>
into many little habitations by partitions. These<br/>
places are called <span style="color: #0000FF;">nagaya</span>. There are little shops<br/>
among them called <span style="color: #ff0000;">yornzuya </span>or "sellers of ten<br/>
thousand things." There are <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse-flesh<br/>
</span>restaurants and <span style="color: #ff0000;">caf√©s </span>where spoiled rice and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>entrails are the stock <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>trade. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Secondhand </span>stores and pawnshops abound, for in<br/>
Japan the pawnbroker will make an advance<br/>
on any article that does not fall below a penny in<br/>
value.<br/>
<br/>
The three veterans opened a little restaurant<br/>
called the tt Home of the Honorable Ten Thou<br/>

<br/>
sand Heroes." The average bill <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a guest<br/>
was four cents, but there were plungers who<br/>
squandered as much as eight cents, and these<br/>
had a feast, receiving for this sum three bottles<br/>
of sake, a dish of sashimi or raw fish served with<br/>
horse-radish, a cup of bean soup, and a saucer of<br/>
stewed fish. To them came many old soldiers<br/>
asking food, which was never refused. Had it<br/>
not been for the coolies employed in the larger<br/>
shops, who came in their working kimonos<br/>
bearing the sign of their employer on the back,<br/>
the three veterans would have soon lost their<br/>
all. As it was they lost, despite the fact that a<br/>
basket of shark entrails purchased for 30 cents<br/>
retailed for 50 and the heads of tunny <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish<br/>
</span>purchased for 25 cents brought in various<br/>
dishes fully $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">51.50</span>. As times grew harder trade<br/>
grew slack; the number of soldier visitors<br/>
increased, and it was impossible to refuse the<br/>
poor devils something to <span style="color: #ff0000;">cat </span>when they pathetically gazed in silence at the tempting cuttlefish<br/>
and fresh corn. Then the rent was advanced<br/>
and the veterans, after borrowing money at 186<br/>
per cent. interest, finally gave up and moved to<br/>
a cheaper house of three mats with a backyard<br/>
just two feet wide. One by one they pawned<br/>
their clogs, sandals, and socks, their umbrellas,<br/>
braziers, little low tables, rice kettles, and<br/>
miserable <span style="color: #0000FF;">bedding </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">everything </span>that could be<br/>
pawned<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE GREED OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>PAWNBROKERS<br/>
<br/>
The Government rate of interest in the<br/>
pawnshops is supposed to be about one and<br/>
three-quarters per cent. a month, but by devious<br/>
devices the Tokyo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shylocks </span>secure from five<br/>
to eight per cent. per month. Then, whenever an article was taken out, an additional<br/>
charge of one-half per cent. was made. In the<br/>
matter of pipes, the pawnbrokers, after advancing, would rent them out to their owners for a<br/>
few mills a day so that the unfortunate might<br/>
still have his smoke of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">thimbleful </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">horrible </span>stuff supplied by the Government monopoly.<br/>
The three veterans huddled together on their<br/>
ragged old mats and lived on the entrails of<br/>
fish, horses and cattle, which, prepared in<br/>
itinerant kitchens by curb restaurateurs, were<br/>
sold nicely browned on long wooden skewers.<br/>
One skewer cost half a cent, and in common<br/>
with many of their neighbors they chewed the<br/>
very wood to <span style="color: #0000FF;">extract </span>the last atom of nourishment. For amusement they read newspapers<br/>
which when twelve hours old were sold to the<br/>
very poor for one-third of the original prices.<br/>
