All the original thirteen states, except New<br/>
Hampshire, and many of the other states have<br/>
buildings on the grounds. They all face on<br/>
Willoughby Boulevard, overlooking Hampton<br/>
Roads, giving an unobstructed view of all the<br/>
naval displays. Some of the states have<br/>
erected replicas of famous historic buildings,<br/>
but the others are colonial in style. Their<br/>
construction is permanent and they will become<br/>
residences, hotels, and club houses after the<br/>
Exposition closes.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most imposing of all the state<br/>
buildings is that of Virginia, which represents<br/>

<br/>
a large type of the colonial mansion, built of<br/>
brick and ornamented with stone. It contains<br/>
no exhibits but is a reception and entertainment building of the Old Dominion. Here Virginia, the "Mother of States," will proudly act<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">role </span>of hostess to her children who have<br/>
wandered far and are come back again during<br/>
the Exposition. From every state in the<br/>
Union, the sons and daughters of the Old<br/>
Dominion will gather once more beneath the<br/>
rooftree of their native state. Even from<br/>
Oregon, 10,000 Virginians are preparing for<br/>
the journey back to their native state during<br/>
the summer.<br/>
