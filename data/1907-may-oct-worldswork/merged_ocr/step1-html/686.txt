that, whether asked about a legislative chamber<br/>
or about a chimney sweep, can find its answer<br/>
only in a reference to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">purposes </span>which the<br/>
institution is designed to serve<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>If it performs<br/>
the functions assigned to it, it is good; if not,<br/>
it is bad. The Constitution of the United<br/>
States has given functions to the Senate which<br/>
have little or no resemblance to those which are<br/>
or ought to be performed by the House of Lords,<br/>
and comparison is impossible. The German<br/>
Empire has a second chamber of a most remarkable kind, called the Federal Council. It<br/>
consists of deputies nominated by the various<br/>
governments of the Empire, Prussia having a<br/>
standing majority, and its duty is to represent<br/>
in the parliament of the Empire the particular<br/>
interests of the federated states which compose<br/>
it. Here, again, we see something essentially<br/>
different from what the House of Lords is, or<br/>
ought to be. In France, the parallel is somewhat closer. There is a Senate elected by the<br/>
people simply and solely to do the work of<br/>
legislation in coordination with the Chamber<br/>
of Deputies. But as England, Germany, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>America understand the term, the second<br/>
chamber of France is non-existent. It is, as<br/>
it were, a mirror of the lower chamber. <span style="color: #ff0000;">French<br/>
<br/>
</span>legislation has two rooms in its House because<br/>
two are more fashionable than one, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">not-as </span>in the other countries mentioned-because<br/>
each is needed to represent one element in the<br/>
national system. Lastly, the parallel between<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>and English second chambers breaks<br/>
down completely when attention is drawn to<br/>
the wide difference between the relations of<br/>
Cabinet to Parliament in the two countries.<br/>
<br/>
THE CABINET MAKES THE LAWS<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>chambers are to a large extent<br/>
the actual parents of French laws. In England, however, all important legislation originates in the Cabinet. This is not the theory,<br/>
but it is the fact, of constitutional practice.<br/>
The Cabinet is really a committee of the majority of the Commons; when it produces a<br/>
legislative proposal, everyone knows that unless<br/>
the sky should fall that proposal will pass<br/>
through Parliament into law. It will pass the<br/>
House of Commons because the majority there<br/>
will support the proposal of the Cabinet which<br/>
was appointed to serve its purposes and represent its policy and whose individual members<br/>
lead it in debate. This point is dwelt <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon-this </span>origination of legislation in the Cabinet,<br/>
this commission which the Cabinet holds to<br/>
<br/>
ENGLAND'S HOUSE OF LORDS<br/>
<br/>
represent and act for the majority of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commons</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-because </span>it materially affects the duties<br/>
which each house of Parliament is called on to<br/>
perform.<br/>
<br/>
It has been charged against the House of<br/>
Lords that frequently it sits for a quarter of an<br/>
hour a day, and that it will dispose of half a<br/>
dozen intricate measures in half as many days.<br/>
Well would it be for English public life if the<br/>
House of Commons would sometimes do the<br/>
same. This speedy legislation means nothing<br/>
but that the Cabinet of the day has conceived,<br/>
framed, and drafted a measure so unobjectionable that criticism is wasted upon it. The<br/>
House of Commons, very likely, has discussed<br/>
it for five days without altering "more than a<br/>
word or two. The Lords, with Olympian<br/>
celerity, produce the same result in as many<br/>
minutes. This is not intended as a slur on the<br/>
representative chamber; what it is most <span style="color: #0000FF;">im</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>portant to make clear is that the business of<br/>
both Commons and Lords, of the Lords in an<br/>
especial degree, is not to legislate but to give<br/>
sanction or refusal to what the Cabinet each<br/>
year proposes. Only what the Cabinet proposes has the slightest chance of becoming law.<br/>
If the Lords, in an industrious access of legislative fervor, were to work for hours a day and<br/>
pass bills of heavenly wisdom morning, noon,<br/>
and night, not one of these would become law.<br/>
The Commons would never look at them.<br/>
Lack of time would cause them to perish, <span style="color: #0000FF;">be</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>cause the immense mass of Cabinet legislation<br/>
annually leaves the Commons no time to consider anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Now it may be thought that the view here<br/>
taken of the English Constitution raises the<br/>
Cabinet to an unwarranted level of importance<br/>
and degrades the legislature into a mechanical<br/>
farce. It can only be answered that anyone<br/>
curious enough to come and watch the working<br/>
of politics in London will not be long in subscribing to the doctrine. And in the system<br/>
thus described, the House of Lords-the<br/>
chamber of youthful dukes and <span style="color: #ff0000;">nonogenarian<br/>
</span>barons, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>dried-up lawyers and bishops in<br/>
lawn sleeves-plays its humble part with admirable fidelity. There is little asked of it by<br/>
the English Constitution, and that little it<br/>
performs with the dignity and speed and honesty of business men and gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Let it be repeated, then, that the Lords in<br/>
normal timps, <span style="color: #0000FF;">consist </span>of a small number of very<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">distinguishiWhwn</span>, making trifling but excellent<br/>
alterations in the legislative proposals <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
