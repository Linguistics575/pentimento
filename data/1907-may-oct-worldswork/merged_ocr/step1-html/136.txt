and two Presidents to the United States.<br/>
Thus this historic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Exposition </span>is held in a land<br/>
of historic <span style="color: #0000FF;">memories</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Exposition </span>will emphasize-really for<br/>
the first time in the minds of the whole American people, who know their New England<br/>
history far better than they know their Southern<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">history-the </span>romantic and interesting story<br/>
of the great Southern colony. In fact, this<br/>
may turn out to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>the great-the very great-permanent <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>of the Exposition, that the<br/>
beginning and early centuries of Southern life<br/>
will take their proper place in popular knowledge; and it will be sure to stimulate the<br/>
study of Southern history.<br/>

THE BEAUTY OF THE GROUNDS<br/>
<br/>
The Exposition grounds have a water frontage on two <span style="color: #ff0000;">sides-Hampton </span>Roads and Boush<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek-and </span>along this prospect for two and a<br/>
half miles stretch four rows of trees. The<br/>
other two sides are enclosed by a wall of living<br/>
green and scarlet, constructed in an original<br/>
way. A fence was made of wire mesh about<br/>

</span>THE RHODE ISLAND BUILDING<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>feet high; above this are a number of<br/>
strands of barbed wire, making the fence about<br/>
eight feet high. Strung upon cross timbers<br/>
that extend two and a half feet on either side<br/>
from the top of the posts are five other strands<br/>
of barbed wire, making it almost impossible<br/>
for any one to get through or over the fence.<br/>
But all this framework is hidden beneath a<br/>
mass of <span style="color: #0000FF;">verdure </span>that makes it look like a huge<br/>
hedge fence in mid-summer. At each post<br/>
is planted a <span style="color: #0000FF;">trumpet-vine</span>; between each post<br/>
is a crimson rambler rose; and between the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">trumpet-vines </span>and crimson <span style="color: #ff0000;">ramblers</span>, honeysuckle has been trained. The vines were<br/>
planted in May, 1905, and, as they are native<br/>
to the South, they have attained full growth<br/>
and now form a mass of green begemmed<br/>
with fragrant flowers that charm the eye and<br/>
fill the air with fragrance.<br/>
<br/>
For three years, the landscape gardeners<br/>
have been transforming the beauty of this<br/>
wilderness into <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wilderness of beauty. All<br/>
the natural charm of the site has been saved<br/>
and augmented. Upon the eastern margin<br/>
