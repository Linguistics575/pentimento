This is not a matter for Congressional action but for diplomacy. Joint action with<br/>
the postal authorities of each country must<br/>
be secured.<br/>

EXAMPLES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS<br/>
<br/>
HE constant additions to <span style="color: #0000FF;">educational<br/>
</span>equipment and opportunities in the<br/>
United States make our time very different<br/>
from any period that preceded us; and the youth<br/>
of our country are incomparably more fortunate<br/>
than any of their forerunners. For examples,<br/>
there came to this office on the same day an<br/>
official explanation of the eleven new district<br/>
agricultural schools in Georgia and the report<br/>
of the committee of the Massachusetts Industrial Commission that had investigated <span style="color: #ff0000;">tradeschools </span>in Europe. These are but fair samples<br/>
of the extension and the construction of good<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>educational machinery and opportunity. Other<br/>
states are doing similar or equally important<br/>
things..<br/>
<br/>
The eleven district agricultural high schools<br/>
in Georgia begin their work this fall. The<br/>
communities in which they are situated have<br/>
given to them land and money to the value of<br/>
more than $ 850, cco. They are really a part<br/>
of the public schools system, being technically<br/>
under the direction of the state university.<br/>
Boys will be taught farming and <span style="color: #ff0000;">farmmanagement</span>, and girls the <span style="color: #0000FF;">housewifely </span>sciences.<br/>
The theory is that one of these schools shall be<br/>
within easy reach of every boy and girl in<br/>
Georgia who wishes to be trained for <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficient<br/>
</span>farm life. Just as a well-developed publicschool system everywhere has a high school<br/>
which trains pupils either for business or for<br/>
college, so these agricultural schools add farming to the accessible kinds of training and aim<br/>
to put it on the same plane of dignity and<br/>
thoroughness.<br/>
<br/>
The Massachusetts Commission on Indus.<br/>
trial Education, it will be recalled, has recommended the establishment of trade high schools,<br/>
as a part of the public school system. <span style="color: #0000FF;">These<br/>
</span>also will, if they are established, correspond<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
to the existing high schools in the thoroughness<br/>
and dignity of their work.<br/>
<br/>
Agricultural high schools in a rich farming<br/>
state and trade high schools in a manufacturing<br/>
state go with refreshing directness toward the<br/>
most hopeful methods of building up our life<br/>
soundly. The riches of Georgia are in the soil.<br/>
The riches of Massachusetts are in the shop<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The rounded development of all the people<br/>
of each community can be attained in no other<br/>
way. There has been a social prejudice against<br/>
these obviously right ways of training youth.<br/>
The lad on the farm has thought it more <span style="color: #ff0000;">respectable </span>to go to the town. The lad near the shop<br/>
has regarded commercial or professional life<br/>
as better than life as a craftsman.<br/>
<br/>
Our old method had in it, in fact, for many<br/>
youths a falsehood-a falsehood that <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>at<br/>
the very basis of their lives. We have now, in<br/>
consequence, to overthrow a wrong social<br/>
standard. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">wholesomest </span>thing imaginable<br/>
is a liberally endowed effort to change this<br/>
false standard. Successful agriculture is a<br/>
very profitable and dignified calling. The best<br/>
workshops afford careers of profit and dignity.<br/>
There is no good reason <span style="color: #0000FF;">why </span>Georgia and<br/>
Massachusetts should not have as good farms<br/>
and as good workshops as there are in the world.<br/>
They have just as capable youth to train as the<br/>
youth of any nation. If they are as earnest<br/>
about it as the Germans, the Belgians, and the<br/>
French have been, and as the Irish are <span style="color: #0000FF;">becoming</span>, there is no reason why commissions from<br/>
these foreign nations should not soon come<br/>
here to learn how we have managed to induce<br/>
the most capable men to take to farming and<br/>
to the trades.<br/>
<br/>
Nor does such an impetus given to purely<br/>
practical education result in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lowering </span>of<br/>
high academic aims. It does not turn Education into "a mere preparation for earning a<br/>
living." It does not rob youth of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">birthright</span>, and lessen its indulgence in high ideals.<br/>
The error in this assumption is that if there<br/>
were no trade schools the boy who will now<br/>
learn a trade would learn literature or philosophy instead. It is the sort of error that<br/>
little coteries of half-educated men, men whose<br/>
economic vision is short, sometimes make.<br/>
The assumption is that, if you have a few<br/>
scholars or especially fortunate or especially<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">able </span>men of high academic cultivation, society<br/>
will be safe and the rest of mankind will get<br/>
on somehow very well. It is this deep-rooted<br/>
feeling in English social life that has<br/>
<br/>
