</span>must be loosened and plucked. Unplucked<br/>
nutria is used as imitation seal.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting point with all the soft furs is<br/>
that they do not need chemicals. Once they<br/>
are dehaired, it remains only to clean them.<br/>
That is variously done-by immersion in soft<br/>
water, by brushing, by revolving in sawdust<br/>

tanks, by being tubbed in a huge butter vat and<br/>
trodden by half-naked men, the heat of the<br/>
human body supplying a natural resolvent and<br/>
polishing the fur without spoiling it.<br/>
<br/>
Two of the costliest rare furs are sable and<br/>
ermine, though I have heard experts say that<br/>
they would prefer a first-class American marten<br/>
to any Russian sable except the costliest. The<br/>
great hunting fields for the sable are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kam</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">chatka</span>, Yakutsk and northern China. The<br/>
sable is barely nine inches long, including the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tail-brown</span>, dark brown, silver, and black<br/>
being the prevailing colors. For a perfect<br/>
black pelt of this little creature, as high as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">33150 </span>has been paid, though the price runs all<br/>
the way from $ 2.50 to $ 75, according to grade.<br/>
Of the black sable, seldom more than 25,000<br/>
a year come to the markets of the world; of<br/>
the commoner red sable, as many as 100,000.<br/>
Like the sable, the ermine is as small as one's<br/>
finger, and for the purpose of the fur trade is<br/>
limited exclusively to the cold regions. And<br/>
like the silver fox, it is the subject of stormy<br/>
scientific discussions; for when the most perfect pelt for whiteness is found on the youngest<br/>
kittens just past their ash-colored birth condition, white hair can hardly be explained as<br/>
old age or a coat changing for the season. In<br/>
southern climates, the ermine is nothing more<br/>
than a sulphur-colored, vicious, worthless, little<br/>
weasel. In the North, where white is the best<br/>
non-conductor of heat from a body, ermine is<br/>
king, the best Russian coming from Yakutsk,<br/>
the best American from Mackenzie River.<br/>
When ermine is sold with black spots instead<br/>
of tails, it is the well-known miniver of royal<br/>
and noble regalia. The priceless value attached to ermine when it was exclusively a<br/>
royal fur no longer <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruler-the </span>trapper receiving all the way from four cents for a spoiled<br/>
skin to $ 4 for a perfectly prime one.<br/>
<br/>
MARTEN, MINK, AND OTTER<br/>
<br/>
Closely allied to Russian sable is American<br/>
marten, a larger animal of which the fur has<br/>
recently so increased in price that is it now one<br/>
of the most valuable furs on the traders' list.<br/>
More than 100,000 are yearly sold in London, of<br/>
which three-quarters come from the Hudson's<br/>
Bay Company. For marten, the trapper<br/>
receives from $ 5 to $ 35 a pelt. Fisher, or<br/>
pekan, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>kind of marten the size of a cat, is not<br/>
much better than cat if it is not prime, but a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>specimen is almost equal to marten.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these are the furs of the<br/>
