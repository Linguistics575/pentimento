northeast, both thriving markets. The foothills are covered with forests of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest<br/>
</span>hardwood, and the standing timber on this<br/>
island is probably more than double that of<br/>
the states of Washington and Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
In view of the fact that American railroads<br/>
already find it necessary to draw on Japan for<br/>
their ties, it is not at all improbable that<br/>
Philippine hardwood will carry the rails of<br/>
our American systems within the next five<br/>
years. It is practically impossible to carry on<br/>
lumber operations on an ordinary scale; logging<br/>
by water is out of the question as the streams<br/>
are rapid and erratic in flow. Then, too, the<br/>
native woods are so heavy that each log must<br/>
be lashed to bamboo floats. Conservative<br/>
estimates of the standing timber place the<br/>
stumpage value to the Government at nearly<br/>
three billion dollars.<br/>
<br/>
At Escalante is one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>land-locked<br/>
harbors in the Archipelago; when dredged, it<br/>
will afford a deep anchorage for a dozen oceangoing steamers.<br/>
<br/>
Negros also produces large quantities of hemp<br/>
of the best grade. The population is not as<br/>
large as that of Panay and the railroads must<br/>
depend for a large portion of their revenue upon<br/>
freight receipts. The passenger <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>on the<br/>
Panay roads will be heavy from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Cebu, a long narrow island to the cast of<br/>
Negros and separated from it by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanon<br/>
</span>Strait, has about half of its eastern coast served<br/>
by a trunk-line terminating at Danao on the<br/>
north and Argao on the south, with a branch<br/>
from Carcar running across the island to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Julugao</span>, a seaport on the Strait. Cebu, on<br/>
the main line, has a fine natural harbor, which<br/>
has been dredged and improved by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Govern</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ment. All along the east coast of this island<br/>
are coal lands of undetermined extent, forming--<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the estimate of many-one of the most<br/>
valuable assets of the Archipelago.<br/>
<br/>
Practically all of the coal now used in the<br/>
Philippines is Japanese coal from Nagasaki, or<br/>
Australian coal, which costs more than $ 6 gold<br/>
at Manila. It is not improbable that coal can<br/>
be mined on Cebu at such a cost that it can be<br/>
landed at Manila for $ 4.50 a ton. This matter<br/>
of native coal is of great importance on account<br/>
of the naval coaling station which the United<br/>
States Government is now building at Olongapo,<br/>
on Subig Bay. Most of the coal now used by<br/>
the fleet in the Far East comes from the United<br/>
States via <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">V<br/>

THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA IN <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>PHILIPPINES<br/>
<br/>
the islands, and nearly half of the entire railroad<br/>
system will be in the shape of additions to the<br/>
existing Manila and Dagupan Railroad. From<br/>
Manila the railroad runs in a northerly direction<br/>
to Dagupan, also a seaport. From here the<br/>
road skirts the coast to San Fernando, where<br/>
a steamer connection is contemplated. From<br/>
Manila southward a trunk-line will be built<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pagailao</span>, following the shores of the lake<br/>
known as Laguna de Bay. Several short spurs<br/>
are being built into the richer territory, tapping<br/>
tobacco and other agricultural lands. In the<br/>
extreme southern end of Luzon, in the provinces<br/>
of Albay, and Camarines Sur, two lines will<br/>
extend inland from Pasacao, which is to be<br/>
connected with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pagailao </span>by a steamer service.<br/>
<br/>
Active work in the construction of the Philippine railroads began in April, 1906, when fifty<br/>
American engineers sailed for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philippines<br/>
</span>on the steamship Minnesota. The party included field engineers, cashiers, clerks, and<br/>
stenographers-forming the nucleus of an<br/>
organization which has been supplemented as<br/>
progress advanced.<br/>
<br/>
Eight thousand tons of steel for eighty miles<br/>
of track have been shipped, and locomotives<br/>
and cars are now in the islands. Survey work<br/>
is being carried on simultaneously on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>islands and it is the intention of the projectors to lay track as rapidly as possible, starting at the various seaports. Thus it will be<br/>
possible to develop a profitable business on<br/>
some sections of the road before the entire<br/>
system is completed, and it will also facilitate<br/>
the transportation of supplies and materials.<br/>
<br/>
The preparations for <span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span>out the work<br/>
of survey and construction were made with the<br/>
utmost care, and provided for all possible<br/>
emergencies. Food and medical service and<br/>
sanitation receive careful attention in order to<br/>
minimize sickness and accidents.<br/>
<br/>
The lines on the island of Luzon, Negros,<br/>
Cebu, and Panay will cost, in the aggregate,<br/>
about $ 30,000,000; but the project is considered<br/>
a paying one from the start.<br/>
<br/>
The establishment by the United States<br/>
Government of a naval base at Olongapo, the<br/>
improvement of the harbors of the principal<br/>
seaports, the upbuilding of industries, both<br/>
old and new, and the completion of this system<br/>
of railroads will mark a new era in the history<br/>
of the Far East. During the next decade the<br/>
increased value of the Philippine Archipelago<br/>
to the United States will astonish those who<br/>
knew the islands ten years <span style="color: #0000FF;">ago</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
