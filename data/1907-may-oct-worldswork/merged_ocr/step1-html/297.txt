<span>THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
upon the millions of Springbok and tracked<br/>
the great lion to his lair. The train, from its<br/>
fittings, might be one of the Pennsylvania<br/>
flyers to Chicago; but it is merely the "train<br/>
de luxe" for Victoria Falls. It follows the<br/>
trail of the Lost Legion, the "long trek" of<br/>
the Father of the Boers. It cuts across the<br/>
battlefields of Cronje, De Wet, and Botha.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>taps Johannesburg, the heart of the Rand.<br/>
It threads the hills where Roberts swept the<br/>
broken forces of the Boers back on Pretoria.<br/>
Then on and on it picks its way, up through<br/>
the hills and plains, leaping at last on great<br/>
steel arches over the Zambesi, Livingstone's<br/>
river, then on into the unbroken jungle of the<br/>
great central plateau.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there spurs pierce the ranges, or<br/>
reach down into valleys where white men<br/>
labor at the arts of peace, or black men work<br/>
the mines. They come from Durban up by<br/>
Ladysmith, creeping through the ranges to<br/>
tap the riches of the central land. And<br/>
with them come the hosts of civilization. Here<br/>
come the man of commerce, seeking his<br/>
wares; the German drummer, whose sole<br/>
ambition is to stamp his "made in Germany"<br/>
across the map of every country in the world;<br/>
the Pittsburg agent, anxious to show the<br/>
wonders of his mining machinery to the British<br/>
magnates of the Rand; agents for Canadian<br/>
whiskey, Scotch tweeds, English marmalade,<br/>
and all the other commodities that make things<br/>
hum on all the frontiers of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
South Africa lies wide open. In each of its<br/>
colonies education and commerce grow side<br/>
by side, each in its separate way. At Bloemfontein, Pretoria, and other of the greater<br/>
centres, there are colleges that prepare the<br/>
students for university standing; and all over<br/>
the country there are schools, rural and town,<br/>
high and low, Dutch and English. They are<br/>
making an educated race in South Africa.<br/>
Good public libraries are springing up in even<br/>
the smaller villages. Life on the veldt has<br/>
lost its rigors. Last year they sent a football<br/>
team to Britain, and it won nearly all its games<br/>
against the best that Britain could oppose to<br/>
it. The country goes ahead with the leisurely<br/>
haste of the Englishman.<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">UPLIFT </span>OF CENTRAL AFRICA<br/>
<br/>
If one contemplate in amazement the progress of the South African regions, what shall<br/>
he say of the Congo, of Uganda, of Egypt?<br/>
Mr, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vemer</span>, among others, has written <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9096<br/>
<br/>
</span>present-day tendencies in the Congo basin.<br/>
He has taken the traveler by rail and steamboat to the deep dark forests where the pygmies<br/>
dwell. Where Stanley blazed the way, the<br/>
cohorts of civilization have followed closely.<br/>
The very cannibals who hurled against the<br/>
canoes of the intrepid explorer clouds of<br/>
arrows are to-day themselves the pilots, the<br/>
firemen, the engineers of the river steamboats.<br/>
You may go on a winter excursion to the grave<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uledi</span>, suffering no hardship whatever on<br/>
the journey. Great regions of forest where<br/>
Stanley hewed his canoes are to be laid out<br/>
by companies incorporated under American or<br/>
Belgian laws, and developed at the hands of<br/>
American syndicates. The greedy hands of<br/>
industry reach far out into the very heart of<br/>
the Dark Continent, drawing down from the<br/>
eternal forests their wealth of rubber, timber,<br/>
and ivory.<br/>
<br/>
On the opposite side of the continent, the<br/>
progress is even more startling. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mombassa</span>, half-way up the eastern coast of Africa,<br/>
the English built a railroad. They spent<br/>
nearly $ 25,000,000, merely to connect the<br/>
coast with the waters of the Victoria Nyanza.<br/>
It takes two days to travel by this little line<br/>
from the Indian Ocean to the great inland lake.<br/>
The result of it has been the rapid advancement<br/>
of civilization throughout British East Africa.<br/>
One hears very little of that region, but what<br/>
does come through the veil of official British<br/>
silence seems all very cheerful. Mr. A. C.<br/>
Coolidge, writing to The Nation recently,<br/>
described the steps in the progress of the<br/>
country in these words:<br/>
<br/>
"A large savage population is being taught the principles<br/>
of law and order by a handful of honest, determined, and<br/>
devoted white officials. Life and property are generally<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">secure</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Evenhanded justice is dealt out, roads are built,<br/>
production and trade are increasing."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">secure</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>A hopeful picture, surely. It is saddened,<br/>
yet brightened, by the story of the brave<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Waganda</span>, perhaps the noblest of the native<br/>
African tribes. They live at the upper end of<br/>
the railroad, on the highlands about the<br/>
lakes. In arts, in sciences, in civilization at<br/>
large, they have been esteemed the most advanced of all their brethren. They have been<br/>
called, at times, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Japanese of Africa." But<br/>
they have bought their progress at great cost.<br/>
The race is dying, swiftly and certainly. The<br/>
terrible "sleeping sickness" has followed the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flag </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Britain </span>to the ridge of the African<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
