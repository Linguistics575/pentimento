<span>GOVERNOR HUGHES-NOW AND LATER<br/>
<br/>
AN EXECUTIVE WITHOUT A "MACHINE"<br/>
<br/>
BY<br/>
<br/>
"Q. P."<br/>
<br/>
ORE surprising political events might<br/>
M happen than that Governor Hughes<br/>
l should receive the next Republican<br/>
Presidential <span style="color: #ff0000;">nomination-mot </span>as the Roosevelt<br/>
candidate but as the only man who could<br/>
defeat the Roosevelt candidate in convention<br/>
and then stand a reasonable chance of election.<br/>
If any thing can induce Mr. Roosevelt to<br/>
reconsider his determination not to run again,<br/>
it will be the political situation in his own<br/>
state. For while Mr. Roosevelt is not only<br/>
willing but anxious to conclude his executive<br/>
responsibilities with his present term, it is<br/>
certain that he does not regard that as the<br/>
end of his political career. Having done what<br/>
he could in administrative office, he naturally desires to turn over that work to a sympathetic and harmonious successor.<br/>
<br/>
The voting population of the United States<br/>
is with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr.Roosevelt</span>. The people believe<br/>
in his sincerity, his purpose to do what is right,<br/>
his "square-deal" policy. Whatever he favors<br/>
the public will clamorously support. He is<br/>
their champion against "Standard Oil," the<br/>
beef-packers, the railroads, Wall Street, and all<br/>
the other ogres. On Mr. Roosevelt's strength<br/>
and popularity with the people none puts<br/>
a higher estimate than the "high financiers"<br/>
themselves. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mr. </span>Morgan, Mr. Harriman, Mr.<br/>
Rogers, Mr. Ryan, Mr.Armour, and the rest of<br/>
them are so convinced of their inability to stem<br/>
Mr. Roosevelt's popularity that their prayers<br/>
for clemency are now addressed directly<br/>
to him. While they and the Senators<br/>
and the other political bosses of their circle,<br/>
if they thought they could, would seek<br/>
to nominate and to elect Mr. Fairbanks or<br/>
Speaker Cannon, their fear of Mr. Roosevelt's<br/>
strength with the people is so great that the<br/>
only way they see to escape him is to take some<br/>
other man in whom the people have great<br/>
confidence<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>No other man who answers this<br/>
description is available except Governor<br/>
Hughes.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Hughes never had anything to do with<br/>
politics before his nomination last fall. And<br/>
according to Albany reports, his abstinence<br/>
continues. For twenty years he had alternated<br/>
in occupation between a law office and lawschool professorships. In both he was secluded.<br/>
As a lawyer, his partners did the trial <span style="color: #0000FF;">work </span>and<br/>
he was the office counsel. A great part of his<br/>
modest income came from giving advice to<br/>
other lawyers. He was a man of infinite<br/>
patience and detail, an expert on contracts<br/>
and involved agreements. His first appearance<br/>
in public was as chairman of the legislative<br/>
Gas Committee three years ago. Senator<br/>
Frederick C. Stevens was chairman of that<br/>
committee. Mr. Stevens had been in the gas<br/>
business himself. He was a banker in Washington and a gentleman farmer in Wyoming<br/>
County, N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Y</span>, where his father and grandfather lived and where he returned to go into<br/>
politics and raise fancy cattle. Senator Stevens<br/>
knew Mr. Hughes as the kind of a lawyer he<br/>
would personally employ. Instead of hiring<br/>
a legal star or a political lawyer, the committee<br/>
took Mr. Hughes.<br/>
<br/>
PROBING THE GAS COMPANIES<br/>
<br/>
The gas companies were investigated as<br/>
never before. Instead of oratorical display<br/>
and calling as witnesses the men who really<br/>
controlled the gas monopoly and prying into<br/>
their political relations and private monetary<br/>
affairs, Mr. Hughes stuck to gas. He first<br/>
went into the franchises of the companies, not<br/>
the manner in which they had been obtained<br/>
but solely their present legal value and existence.<br/>
He disclosed flaws in many franchises. He<br/>
proved the expiration of the original franchises.<br/>
He brought out that the consolidation into one<br/>
monopoly was illegal and could be readily<br/>
upset in the courts. Then he went into the<br/>
question of actual investment of real money<br/>
which the capitalization of more than<br/>
$ 200,000,000 represented. He proved that<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
