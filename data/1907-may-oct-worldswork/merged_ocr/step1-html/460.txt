<br/>
who are good." It is surprising how many<br/>
people accept without protest these premises.<br/>
Even so great a teacher as President Hadley<br/>
despairs of securing at an early date a large<br/>
enough quantity of high ideals to insure good<br/>
government oftener than once in a great while.<br/>
When, however, we look about us, scan the<br/>
faces of the men and women we meet on the<br/>
street, in the shop, coming from the factory,<br/>
working on the railroad, handling other men's<br/>
cash, we must concede that the rank and file<br/>
of us are honest, always in favor of what the<br/>
Moral Upheavalist calls good government,<br/>
and always opposed to what he calls badness<br/>
in government. Our most urgent need is not<br/>
to manufacture good character, but rather to<br/>
increase the certainty that the ideals and the<br/>
character already in existence will make themselves felt, not merely when reeking corruption<br/>
is uncovered, but everyday, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
THE EXAMPLE OF PHILADELPHIA<br/>
<br/>
For example: The people of Philadelphia<br/>
who in 1906 turned against a corrupt political<br/>
machine were the identical people who reinstated that machine in 1907. Judging from<br/>
the progress of the rest of the world, the average moral character of the voters was somewhat better in 1907 when they voted corruption<br/>
in, than in 1906 when they voted corruption<br/>
out. The difference between Philadelphia<br/>
corrupt but contented, and Philadelphia corrupt and discontented, is not one of character<br/>
but of vision-of information-a chasm to be<br/>
bridged not by ethical training but by information about their government. In 1906<br/>
Philadelphia was brilliantly informed about<br/>
two or three dangers. Everybody could identify the shady side of the street, its pitfalls and<br/>
obstructions. But in 1907 the electric searchlight gave way to a parade of flickering torches<br/>
supplemented by an occasional bonfire. When<br/>
election day came the rank and file found one<br/>
side of the street about as dark as the other and<br/>
naturally chose, since compelled to stumble,<br/>
to stumble over the familiar path of party<br/>
regularity.<br/>
<br/>
Philadelphia's relapse could have been prevented just as the idealists of New York could<br/>
have <span style="color: #ff0000;">reiilected </span>Mayor Low, and just as San<br/>
Francisco can, if it takes the right steps, insure<br/>
itself against the recurrence of the condition<br/>
which is to-day making that city "the scandal<br/>
of the world." No political "<span style="color: #ff0000;">isms </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>are needed,<br/>
no moral upheaval. <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>quack or faith cure.<br/>
<br/>
HOW TO KEEP GOVERNMENT EFFICIENT<br/>
<br/>
The moral upheaval in Philadelphia made<br/>
no provision for keeping alive the intelligence<br/>
created by the great illumination of 1906.<br/>
The Mayor converted knew as little as the<br/>
Mayor unconverted, about the current acts<br/>
of his subordinates and about the every-day<br/>
needs of his city. The leaders of the reform<br/>
party knew little more than the Mayor and<br/>
little more than their followers. Instead of<br/>
keeping up the bonfire of intelligence and<br/>
enthusiasm by adding new fuel, they tried to<br/>
make a blaze out of the ashes and charred<br/>
timbers of the great bonfire of the year before.<br/>
No new incentive and no new information were<br/>
given to the citizens who desired good government. When the Mayor turned over a new<br/>
leaf, and as leader of the reform army became<br/>
the most highly eulogized mayor in the United<br/>
States, his advisers used up their time applauding his conversion, talked about the "superiority of good motive when once aroused," and<br/>
secured the removal-not of the soil that bred<br/>
disease but of the men who profited from its<br/>
spread. They did not use their opportunity<br/>
to obtain a scheme for effective, cumulative<br/>
publicity that would give the man in the street<br/>
a basis for independent judgment and make<br/>
detection of graft so certain that it would be<br/>
too dangerous to practice it. Not even in the<br/>
departments of health, charities, and police<br/>
were methods adopted to weed out the inefficiency that invites and shelters corruption.<br/>
Everybody put on the Goodness button and<br/>
talked about the new era of good intention in<br/>
government. The tooth stopped aching-the<br/>
visit to the dentist was put off. The rain<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ceased </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>cared for <span style="color: #0000FF;">holes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>roof? When<br/>
the Mayor relapsed the whole movement<br/>
collapsed. When election day came the<br/>
reformers themselves were so confused that<br/>
many of them sincerely believed that there was<br/>
more goodness outside reform circles than<br/>
within. Reform was voted out because its<br/>
leaders could not give adequate reasons for<br/>
staying in to the man who was more interested<br/>
in health, comfort, and wages than in the<br/>
relative goodness of the two candidates.<br/>
<br/>
Philadelphia's relapse parallelled that of<br/>
New York in 1903, after two years of government by the rarest galaxy of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">good</span>" officials<br/>
New York ever had. Y et under men <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>unspotted reputation and unquestioned public<br/>
interest, it was possible to mix the board bill<br/>
for babies with the postage account, to charge<br/>
clerical work to contagious disease inspection<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
