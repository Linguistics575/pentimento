</span>thunder storm came up. Just before it began<br/>
to rain I had gone out a little way from the<br/>
trail and <span style="color: #0000FF;">peeled </span>the bark from a couple of<br/>
small trees to cover over my camera and the<br/>
can of batteries, to keep them from getting wet.<br/>
The flash-pan was <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>with a loose cover<br/>
easily thrown off when the powder ignited.<br/>
Then I put on my rain-coat and crawled under<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">thiek-limbed </span>umbrella-like tree and waited<br/>
for the storm to pass. Right in the middle <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>

crouched on a limb, rolled himself into a small<br/>
ball with his nose resting between his feet, and<br/>
thus he remained until the storm was over.<br/>
"Shortly after the rain ceased, I saw an old<br/>
grizzly coming down the trail. He was very<br/>
large and fat, and would weigh from <span style="color: #ff0000;">6co </span>to 700<br/>
pounds. He came on, practising the usual<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tactics-stopping </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sniffing</span>, standing up and<br/>
looking about. I was well pleased now <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>

it, I saw a small black bear coming through<br/>
the timber. At every flash of lightning he<br/>
would make a dash for the nearest tree as if<br/>
to climb it, but by the time he reached the tree<br/>
the flash was over, and he would come on again.<br/>
Just as he got to within fifty yards of my tree,<br/>
there came the bolt of the day. Chain-lightning seemed to run up and down every tree,<br/>
followed by a crash of thunder that shook the<br/>
very earth. This was too much for him. He<br/>
took to the nearest tree within reach and did<br/>
<br/>
it had rained, for I thought that all scent must<br/>
be obliterated and that this bear would run<br/>
against the wire. But I was again doomed to<br/>
disappointment. When only six feet from the<br/>
wire, the brute stopped, slowly nosed his way<br/>
up to it, and stood for a few seconds with his<br/>
nose but a little way from it. He then became<br/>
so interested that he worked a little nearer,<br/>
and while he was trying to make out what it<br/>
was all about, there was a sudden flash that<br/>
immediately brought him up on his hind feet<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
