<span>CROMER<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Seymour's flagship off Alexandria the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bombardment </span>which was to open the doors of work<br/>
and glory to him. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moncrieff </span>and Garstin he<br/>
knew and favored; from Cassel he accepted<br/>
the shared benefit with full knowledge and<br/>
approval; Tewfik's loyalty, Nubar's broad<br/>
common sense, the bold reforms of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Riaz-all </span>he tested and all he set in their due place<br/>
for the great work of regeneration which was<br/>
entrusted to him. Never a man whom he had<br/>
chosen disappointed him. But the man himself remains as elusive as the Sphinx seven<br/>
miles <span style="color: #ff0000;">awayacross </span>the Nile. It may be that<br/>
the man's entire simplicity conceals no art at<br/>
all, but no one living can put his finger on the<br/>
secret of his success. After all, men who in<br/>
times of stress drive their fellows before them<br/>
know little how they do it, and care less. The<br/>
secret of Rhodes's tremendous force died with<br/>
him. Clive lived to be criticized only by those<br/>
who did not know him. Wolsey was to foreigners a butcher's dog; to Englishmen he was<br/>
the inevitable <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>and the savior of his<br/>
generation. Napoleon and Nelson are as<br/>
inexplicable. Men of this kind do not study<br/>
methods; they accept results and hardly know<br/>
that they have contributed to them. It is a<br/>
hard matter to follow the lead of such men,<br/>
but Lord Cromer has followed them.<br/>
<br/>
SIR <span style="color: #ff0000;">ELDON </span>GORST<br/>
<br/>
Lord Cromer is to be succeeded by Sir Eldon<br/>
Gorst, a handsome man with a vast acquaintance with every detail of Egyptian administration and finance. He succeeds to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">superintendence </span>of a structure of which the designs<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>, the foundations are laid, and the<br/>
building itself finished up to the first string<br/>
course. It may be that the extension of the<br/>
building will be in his hands; it may be that<br/>
he will have to fight for the carrying out of the<br/>
existing designs. Should he fail in any part,<br/>
he at least cannot plead ignorance, for no man<br/>
in Egypt knows Egypt like Sir Eldon Gorst.<br/>
The work that lies before him on the lines laid<br/>
down is enough to wear a man's energy out.<br/>
Not until the new bed of the hill, <span style="color: #0000FF;">zoo </span>miles<br/>
long, is cut above the Sobat; not until the Great<br/>
Lakes themselves are dammed for the eternal<br/>
benefit of Egypt, is England's work in northeast Africa finally established. Yet what<br/>
work it is that Cromer hands down to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">carried </span>out! <span style="color: #0000FF;">Each </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inch </span>of dam in the gorge of the<br/>
Victoria Nyanza is worth twenty-seven Assouan<br/>
reservoirs full to the brim. The very <span style="color: #ff0000;">concep<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9065<br/>
<br/>
</span>tion of the thing is bewildering. Egypt, from<br/>
being the close valley of the Nile, will have<br/>
become a latitudinal fact. One day the desert<br/>
oases will find their occupation gone; one day<br/>
the dykes of the Canal will keep fresh water<br/>
in as well as hold salt water out. Nothing<br/>
less has Cromer set before him as a goal; nothing<br/>
less will be demanded of his follower.<br/>
<br/>
There is something fascinating about this<br/>
slow invasion of almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">prehistoric </span>places from<br/>
the influence of which no man can wholly<br/>
escape. It was once remarked of Khufu that<br/>
had he utilized in another and more usual<br/>
manner the national brute force and endurance<br/>
which went to build the Great Pyramid, he<br/>
would have been king from the Cataracts to<br/>
the Euxine; and the criticism is probably true.<br/>
It is also probably true that his successor, a<br/>
man as relentless, might in the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">way-had </span>he cared to do so-have exchanged cubic<br/>
feet of stone for square miles of European<br/>
dominion. Discipline, endurance, meat; these<br/>
were the three requisites; all were there to be<br/>
used and, had the idea struck an Egyptian<br/>
king of that day, he might have spent his<br/>
summers on the Riviera, and the fate of the<br/>
world would have been strangely different.<br/>
<br/>
THE KEY TO EGYPT<span style="color: #ff0000;">'S </span>FUTURE<br/>
<br/>
Water! There is the whole Egyptian problem in a word. For only if Egypt should<br/>
become poor again, only if the security it offers<br/>
for the millions there invested should be<br/>
lessened-only in that case will Europe once<br/>
more interfere with its affairs. And the wealth<br/>
of Egypt depends not upon this thing nor upon<br/>
that, but upon water. There is no better soil<br/>
than this thirsty and crystalline desert sand,<br/>
and the men who give Egypt water, men like<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Moncrieff </span>and Garstin, solve the question that<br/>
no one has faced since the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fayoum </span>irrigation<br/>
scheme was mooted. There is little to trouble<br/>
Gorst along his horizons; the only anxieties<br/>
are at his feet.<br/>
<br/>
But here in Egypt, the old abuse creeps in.<br/>
It is the same everlasting story of the contact<br/>
between West and East. The East is rescued<br/>
by England from disease, cruelty, starvation,<br/>
injustice, dirt, and despair, but no solitary<br/>
flash of gratitude ever lightens the work of its<br/>
benefactors. Even Cromer referred with a<br/>
touch of sadness to this. He quoted a Frenchman's observation as the summing up of the<br/>
matter: "<span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>a people has suffered too<br/>
much, it scarcely has strength enough to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
