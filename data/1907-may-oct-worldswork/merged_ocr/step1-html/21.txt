<span>WHY THE PRESIDENT'S POPULARITY<br/>
<br/>
commend them to the people. Else those<br/>
become leaders who capture the party machinery and get command mainly by physical<br/>
--that is to say, financial-strength. For the<br/>
moment, there are but two men in national<br/>
politics who have large personal followings-Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Bryan. The policies<br/>
that Mr. Roosevelt stands for will force a real<br/>
leader to the front-Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>, for example;<br/>
or, if this fail, some man of <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>type may<br/>
get control by mechanical methods, such as<br/>
Mr. Fairbanks. But, in the Democratic party,<br/>
there is no man but Mr. Bryan who stands<br/>
for any specific policy, and the mechanical<br/>
machinery of his party seems to be in the hands<br/>
of his friends. The Democratic party will,<br/>
of course, come to life and come into power<br/>
again-perhaps even in the next campaign, if a<br/>
Fairbanks secures the Republican nomination.<br/>
But, unless its enemies give it such a chance,<br/>
it will first have to have a great impulse or to<br/>
produce a great leader.<br/>
<br/>
WHY THE PRESIDENT'S POPULARITY GROWS<br/>
<br/>
THE President keeps his popularity and<br/>
even widens and deepens it; and those<br/>
who think in the political terms of <span style="color: #ff0000;">suaver </span>and<br/>
gentler Administrations continue to wonder<br/>
that this is so. By all the rules of official<br/>
dignity and gentleness, he ought now to be<br/>
regarded as a reckless, dangerous, excited<br/>
pilot who will surely run the ship on rocks at<br/>
the next turn. Hear his loud talk and see his<br/>
wild gestures! Alas, the dignity of the great<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>And in their wonder at his continued<br/>
popularity, they say that he is the most astute<br/>
politician that we have ever had, fooling the<br/>
people not some times but allt he time. The<br/>
inexplicable, deluded people, will they applaud<br/>
the very wrecking of our institutions?<br/>
<br/>
It is in this tone that most of the daily papers<br/>
in New-York, for instance, are talking<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>-in<br/>
tones of pity either for the Great Office, for<br/>
the President, or for the silly people. As for<br/>
the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office</span>, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew<br/>
Jackson, and Abraham <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lincolnoheld </span>it; and,<br/>
while they held it, a large part of the critics<br/>
saw the impending ruin of our institutions and<br/>
despaired of the judgment of the people who<br/>
seemed to like these ungentle revolutionists.<br/>
The journalistic criticisms of these three great<br/>
positive Presidents was as a storm to a breeze<br/>
compared with the present criticisms of Mr.<br/>
Roosevelt. It is instructive reading to turn<br/>
back and see how almost every vigorous man<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">GROW </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">8819<br/>
</span>in the White House was "destroying our<br/>
institutions" and how the silly people applauded the destruction, and then to observe<br/>
how men came later to look back at most of<br/>
these vigorous Presidents as philosophic and<br/>
even as gentle and long-suffering leaders.<br/>
<br/>
In fifty years-or ten years perhaps-Mr.<br/>
Harriman, for instance, will be as dim a figure<br/>
as Jay Gould now is, or dimmer, and the present political clashes between persons of this year<br/>
or next will be known only to diligent students<br/>
of our political history. Even the scandals<br/>
about campaign funds will be forgotten. Men<br/>
will not know who Bliss and Cortelyou and<br/>
Odell and Penrose were-nor who lied and<br/>
what he lied about, and who paid and what he<br/>
paid for, and who conspired and what he conspired about, and who told cock-and-bull<br/>
stories and who got drunk and babbled-nobody will care about these things year after<br/>
next, to say nothing of ten or fifty years hence.<br/>
<br/>
But boys half a century hence will read in<br/>
their histories and all the world will know and<br/>
remember a few simple great facts such as these<br/>
(for it is only a few simple great facts that the<br/>
world <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>it worth while to remember):<br/>
<br/>
"Theodore Roosevelt was the most popular President<br/>
that the United States has had since Washington. He<br/>
came to the Presidency at the time when the Republic<br/>
first fully felt its strength, and his temperament fitted the<br/>
vigor of its mood. We had acquired outlying possessions<br/>
as a result of a war in which he served. Under his administration, we shaped our colonial policy; the Panama Canal<br/>
was begun; Government had an unprecedented<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>abroad. At home the plan of reclaiming our<br/>
desert lands was made; and the work of saving and renewing our forests was begun, and the policy of improving<br/>
and utilizing our river systems was laid down. It was<br/>
under his Administration that great land thefts were<br/>
stopped, and that the army was made energetic and the<br/>
navy strengthened. This was the period when great fortunes were made by unregulated corporations, whose<br/>
leaders threatened the control of the people in politics and<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">government </span>Great interests had their silent privileges<br/>
and their Senators, their vested rights and their legislatures.<br/>
It was President Roosevelt who exposed them and punished them and again made the law respected. He<br/>
refused to become a candidate for a third term and he used<br/>
his popularity with the people to have his policy continued<br/>
of forbidding the corporations to control the Government<br/>
and of living above the law."<br/>
<br/>
our<br/>
<br/>
And there<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>may be half-humorous, diverting<br/>
foot-notes like these:<br/>
<br/>
"President Roosevelt <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man of vigorous <span style="color: #0000FF;">speech </span>and emphatic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">manner</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>When <span style="color: #ff0000;">measion </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arose</span>. or his temper prompted him, he said<br/>
right <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">suth-qml-such </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>lied. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>spoke as a man as well<br/>
as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">President</span>. He knew almost everybody <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>his time and he talked<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
