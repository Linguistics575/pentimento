</span>a road has ever had. Cotton, sugar, rice,<br/>
cocoanuts, cacao, chili, indigo, tobacco, coffee,<br/>
hard woods, cattle, and hogs, all await the<br/>
freight car in this sixty-mile strip of the west<br/>
coast. And off to the sky-line are the mountains, the fabulous treasure houses of Sonora,<br/>
of Sinaloa, of Guerrero, and Michoacan, where<br/>
copper and gold and silver abound and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Where<br/>
</span>the peaks are of iron.<br/>
<br/>
"For years," says <span style="color: #ff0000;">Modern </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">exico</span>, "the only railroad in<br/>
Sonora was the line running from Nogales to Guaymas<br/>

</span>their custom to get out and cut a lot at the head of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">grade</span>,<br/>
and then, after steaming up, to rush pell-mell down the<br/>
grade, in the wild hope that Providence and momentum<br/>
would lift them up the hill again. It is said that burros<br/>
were employed occasionally to haul the engine to the top of<br/>
the grade while the conductor played monte with the<br/>
passengers and the engineer took a <span style="color: #0000FF;">nap</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Now this<br/>

<br/>
This is the work of Harriman, who is<br/>
unloading barrels and barrels of American<br/>
dollars in Mexico. His Southern Pacific<br/>
extension-soo miles now in <span style="color: #0000FF;">operation-will<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
eventually connect Guaymas on the Gulf of<br/>
California with the capital. His interests<br/>
have so far appropriated $ 50,000,000 for the<br/>
work already outlined, and more than 5,000<br/>
men are on his pay-roll in the construction<br/>
camps. One million <span style="color: #0000FF;">ties </span>are coming from<br/>
Japan, and the rails will come from Europe,<br/>
since American concerns cannot promise satisfactory deliveries.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere engineers are laying out more<br/>
roads. There is the loudly trumpeted Mexican<br/>
& Orient, also heading for the west coast,<br/>
besides two or three shorter lines. Both <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>National and the Central are extending their<br/>
network of feeders. The Central is building<br/>
from Tampico to the capital, on which it spent<br/>
nearly half a million dollars for locating alone.<br/>
One bridge, that over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Panuco</span>, will cost a<br/>
million. There is also a million-dollar ship<br/>
canal being dug by the Government from<br/>
Tampico to Tuxpan. Last of all should be mentioned that part of the mythical Pan-American railroad that is not talk, but track-laying.<br/>
A few miles further, and Mexico will have done<br/>
its part. By September the rails should touch<br/>
the boundary line of Guatemala-possibly to<br/>
