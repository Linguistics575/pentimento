<span>THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
management of the interests represented by<br/>
Mr. Thomas F. Ryan and Mr. James Blair, has<br/>
recently announced an intention to spend in<br/>
the next few years many millions of dollars for<br/>
improvements, but there are few important<br/>
extensions now under way. In Florida, the<br/>
aggression of the Atlantic Coast Line has<br/>
forced this road into one important line, and<br/>
there is another small spur under contemplation. The money that is behind the Seaboard<br/>
Air Line is what is called in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Street </span>"canny<br/>
money," which means that the system will<br/>
proceed very slowly in its development, <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>taking any unnecessary risks.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Harriman's Illinois Central is carrying<br/>
on one important extension begun under the<br/>
Fish administration. It is a new line from<br/>
Corinth, Miss., to Haleyville, Ala., where it<br/>
connects with the St. Louis & San Francisco,<br/>
which lets the Illinois Central into Birmingham, Ala. The new line is about eighty miles<br/>
in length. Its importance lies in the fact that<br/>
it adds another railroad to the big group that<br/>
centres about Birmingham, which has had a<br/>
wonderful growth in railroad life as its iron and<br/>
coal industries have advanced. The railroad<br/>
kings are trying to read the future of Birmingham, and each of them concludes that he must<br/>
have a line into that city, no matter what it<br/>
costs.<br/>
<br/>
In general, the work of the big systems is<br/>
not of striking importance. It will be seen<br/>
that it consists mainly of building only what<br/>
the roads are practically forced to build. It<br/>
is not too much to say that there is not a single<br/>
one of the big roads that is now trying to expand.<br/>
The effort is rather to build up the present lines<br/>
to a condition that will make it possible for<br/>
them to handle the traffic which now swamps<br/>
them. The biggest work going on in the South<br/>
is the revision of grades, the double-tracking<br/>
of crowded divisions, the buying of new terminals, the purchase of new equipment, the<br/>
building of new bridges in place of old. If<br/>
some good genius were to place at the disposal<br/>
of the five big systems of the South $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">100,000,000<br/>
</span>each, they could spend it profitably on these<br/>
works without building a single mile of new<br/>
railroad. The roads of the South are more<br/>
urgently in need of such improvement than<br/>
are the roads of any other section of the United<br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting piece of railroad work being<br/>
carried on by one of the smaller lines is the<br/>
extension of the Florida East Coast Railway<br/>
<br/>
8957<br/>
<br/>
from Homestead, Fla., southwest, 125 miles<br/>
down the Florida Keys to Key West. At the<br/>
last report the work had been carried thirtyseven miles, to the southern end of Key Largo.<br/>
The route is designed to shorten the run to<br/>
Cuba, and in the mails it will save a great<br/>
many hours. Of course, the right of way is<br/>
interesting, consisting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>series of short lines<br/>
on land connected by long bridges across the<br/>
inlets.<br/>
<br/>
The Atlanta, Birmingham, and Atlantic<br/>
has been pushing work on its new line from<br/>
La Grange, Ga., to Birmingham, 165 miles.<br/>
The project also calls for a 77-mile extension<br/>
from Chalybeate northward to Atlanta. It<br/>
is the formation of a new trunk line from the<br/>
two important inland cities to tidewater at<br/>
Brunswick, Ga. The enterprise is backed,<br/>
largely, by Boston capital, and the financing<br/>
has been done, of late, in short-term notes.<br/>
This proposition amounts to a new railroad<br/>
to rival the Central of Georgia in carrying to<br/>
the sea the products of the big manufacturing<br/>
towns of the uplands, and to draw down also the<br/>
tonnage from the West coming in over the<br/>
Southern, the St. Louis & San Francisco, and<br/>
the Illinois Central. Relations between this<br/>
road and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Y </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oakum </span>lines are friendly.<br/>
<br/>
By far the most interesting railroad project<br/>
in the South, from every point of view, is the<br/>
line that has recently been consolidated under<br/>
the name of the Virginia Railway. It pierces<br/>
a rugged, mountainous country. It crosses<br/>
the Pocahontas coal-fields, which produce the<br/>
finest grades of bituminous coal for the markets<br/>
of the East. It was not expected, at the outset, that the new road would be anything but<br/>
a logging railroad in the interest of the lumbermen in that region. As time went on, however,<br/>
other interests came in. They decided to push<br/>
the road through the mountains and run<br/>
alongside the Norfolk & Western to tidewater, making a new coal railroad from the<br/>
Pocahontas fields to Norfolk, Va. The whole<br/>
project finally became known as a project<br/>
backed largely by Mr. H. H. Rogers, of the<br/>
Standard Oil Company.<br/>
<br/>
The western section of the new road is a<br/>
heavy bit of work. It twists its way through<br/>
the serrated ranges, following a stream here,<br/>
plunging through a long tunnel there, climbing<br/>
across a giddy trestle over a roaring river to<br/>
avoid a mile or so of twisting climb. When<br/>
they began to build it, in 1894, they followed<br/>
the river course, seeking only such grades as a<br/>
