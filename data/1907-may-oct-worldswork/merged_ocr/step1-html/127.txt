</span>HE present industrial awakening in the<br/>
<br/>
I Southern States is the most important<br/>
<br/>
economic event in our history since<br/>
the settlement of the West. Go where you will,<br/>
the people are building homes, schools, and<br/>
roads, and in the cities business buildings and<br/>
factories. "There is a crying need of more<br/>
houses in this town" headline like this<br/>
appears in most of the newspapers from<br/>
Virginia to Texas. The trains are crowded<br/>
with people. The railroads cannot haul the<br/>
freight. On one day lately, <span style="color: #0000FF;">IDD </span>freight trains<br/>
passed through the first capital of the Confederacy; and Montgomery is now a city of<br/>
beautiful homes and modern business methods.<br/>
The very streets of Mississippi River cities were<br/>
filled with cotton last spring, for there were<br/>
not enough boats and trains to move it. The<br/>
income from the very cabbage and lettuce <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields<br/>
</span>of South Carolina is greater than the revenue<br/>
of the state was when it <span style="color: #0000FF;">seceded</span>. There are<br/>
new hotels in most of the towns, and new and<br/>
old alike are crowded. Several Southern<br/>
States have commissioners of immigration in<br/>
Europe seeking men. Emigration has stopped,<br/>
and you may read in the newspapers of. the<br/>
Northwest advertisements for farmers to go<br/>
South, where fertile lands and good markets<br/>
await them.<br/>
<br/>
A young man who inherited a farm in Georgia<br/>
left it ten years ago and went to Atlanta, thence<br/>
to New York. After a few years of successful<br/>
work in New York, he went back to Atlanta;<br/>
and now, after successful work in Atlanta, he<br/>
is going to return to the farm. He has made<br/>
every one of these moves along the line of the<br/>
greatest profit.<br/>
<br/>
The newspapers are prosperous; fine school<br/>

<br/>
</span>houses are replacing old and smaller ones.<br/>
Thousands of farmers who used to be in debt<br/>
now have cash in banks that did <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>exist five<br/>
years ago. The people are cheerful and they<br/>
look at life from a new angle.<br/>
<br/>
The South has worked out three fundamental<br/>
tasks which all the world may <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit </span>by:<br/>
<br/>
(r) How to teach the farmer who is now on<br/>
the land to double his crop;<br/>
<br/>
(2) How to teach boys and girls practical<br/>
trades while they are "getting their education";<br/>
<br/>
(3) How to govern cities without politics<br/>
and without graft.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the old notions about the South and<br/>
the Southern people that have been held in the<br/>
North must now be revised; for every-day<br/>
events contradict the conclusions that were<br/>
drawn from facts of the past.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the old notions likewise about the<br/>
South and the Southern people that were<br/>
formerly held by the Southern people themselves must now be revised; for every-day<br/>
events contradict the conclusions that they<br/>
also drew from the facts of the past. New<br/>
economic forces are at work.<br/>
<br/>
It is these changes that are explained and<br/>
emphasized in this number of THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">WORLD's<br/>
</span>WORK, because there is nothing in our contemporaneous life more interesting or more<br/>
important than this rise of the people in these<br/>
states, eager to the task of their own development and of the development of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">richest<br/>
</span>region of the Union. This work has now been<br/>
begun with such vigor that it will go on indefinitely; for natural forces have <span style="color: #0000FF;">come </span>into<br/>
play <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the land of "problems" has <span style="color: #ff0000;">become<br/>
<br/>
</span>a land of progress.<br/>
