<br/>
</span>teenth century from the structure of the national<br/>
government, and therefore had its upper house<br/>
- the aldermen, its lower house - the common<br/>
council, and its executive - the mayor. Now,<br/>
city business is almost wholly administrative<br/>
or executive, and is very little concerned with<br/>
large policies or far-reaching legislation. There<br/>
is no occasion for two legislative bodies, or<br/>
even one, in the government of a city. Modern<br/>
cities have to provide and maintain schools,<br/>
roads and bridges, sewers, a water supply, a<br/>
fire department, courts, police, and street lights,<br/>
and to take care of the numerous helpless and<br/>
defective members of the community. On all<br/>
these subjects there is no doubt whatever as to<br/>
what the people need, and the proper supply<br/>
of their needs is a matter of purely administrative business. There is no question of<br/>
general policy to be advanced by public discussion, as in state legislatures or Congress.<br/>
Now and then a question arises which the will<br/>
of the whole people properly expressed may<br/>
best settle; but for the prompt and conclusive<br/>
expression of that will the initiative and the<br/>
referendum-now well-recognized means of<br/>
popular action-are greatly superior to any<br/>
means of expressing public opinion which a<br/>
board of <span style="color: #0000FF;">alderman </span>and a common council can<br/>
possibly afford. It should be remembered<br/>
also that there is not a single item of municipal<br/>
work which is now done, or can be done, in the<br/>
way in which the corresponding piece of work<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-if </span>there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">any-was </span>done when the ordinary form of the American city government was<br/>
adopted. The conditions under which municipal business is now conducted are so different<br/>
from those which existed when the American<br/>
form of city government was set up, that one<br/>
might reasonably expect a form not wholly<br/>
impracticable sixty years or eighty years ago to<br/>
have become absolutely unsuitable, or even<br/>
impossible, to-day.<br/>
<br/>
In the next place, there is no branch or de,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">partment </span>of city business to-day which can be<br/>
properly carried on except by experts. In all<br/>
departments, amateur executive agents are<br/>
completely out of place, and are sure to be<br/>
sources of inefficiency, if not of corruption.<br/>
This, indeed, is one of the main sources of<br/>
municipal failure in the United States. Nothing can be plainer than the general proposition<br/>
that lawyers, engineers, electricians, teachers,<br/>
architects, physicians, and similar experts are<br/>
the only competent persons to really do the<br/>
work of cities. Such trained persons must be<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
employed continuously and on long tenures of<br/>
office in the service of a city, or its work will not<br/>
be properly done. The only question is how<br/>
best to provide a suitable, central board to<br/>
select and employ the needed experts. The<br/>
justice of this proposition may be established<br/>
from the experience of all the existing organizations for business purposes, such as railroads,<br/>
mills, mines, factories, banks, and steamship<br/>
companies. The administrative work of all<br/>
such organizations is done by experts selected,<br/>
employed, and directed by a small administrative board, or even by a single official. The<br/>
<br/>
method used by these corporations is the only.<br/>
<br/>
method for a city, if its work is to be well done.<br/>
Imagine the state of a railroad or factory whose<br/>
business was mainly directed by sub-committees<br/>
of two large bodies and a president, annually<br/>
elected by 50,000 shareholders. Yet city<br/>
business is very like corporation business,<br/>
except that it is not conducted for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">.profit</span>.<br/>
<br/>
THE CITY NO LONGER ISOLATED<br/>
<br/>
Underlying the provision of a board of aldermen and a common council for the American<br/>
cities, was the idea of two sorts of representation of the will of the citizens-one by a small<br/>
board elected at large, and the other locally<br/>
elected from small districts. This conception<br/>
of local representation has become entirely<br/>
inapplicable in city populations. When the<br/>
cities had no public water-supplies, any family<br/>
might have a strong local interest in a particular<br/>
well near their house; but now the interest of<br/>
every family in regard to its water-supply is<br/>
not at all within the limits of the city, but really<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">in.the </span>pure <span style="color: #ff0000;">condition</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>of a water-shed twenty<br/>
or forty miles away, quite outside of the geographical boundaries of the city. In the same<br/>
way, before the modern modes of transportation<br/>
came into existence, the citizen might be supposed to have a peculiar interest in the sidewalk and roadway in front of his house; but<br/>
now he is much more nearly interested in the<br/>
good condition and safe operation of the 200<br/>
miles of electric railway which maintains for<br/>
him easy communication over a circle, the<br/>
radius of which sweeps ten miles round his<br/>
home. Again, the citizen's interest in roads and<br/>
bridges used to be limited to the few highways<br/>
over which wagons brought his daily food and<br/>
fuel from the immediately surrounding country;<br/>
but now the citizen has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>more intense<br/>
interest in <span style="color: #ff0000;">thtrskilful </span>operation of half a dozen<br/>
transcontinental railroads, than he has in the<br/>
