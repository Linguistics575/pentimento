will have vanished down the same road on<br/>
which the stage coach has preceded it.<br/>
Already forest destruction in the mountains<br/>
has visibly diminished the water power depended<br/>
upon by important mills. It is fortunate for<br/>
the country, and especially fortunate for the<br/>
South, that by the creation of the Waterways<br/>
Commission the President has called public<br/>

attention to the fact that our streams and rivers,<br/>
like our farm land and forests, are among the<br/>
great resources which support our wellbeing and<br/>
give us rank among the great powers of the<br/>
world. Forethought, intelligence, and wise<br/>
control of our collective action in the light of<br/>
the best information that science can give <span style="color: #0000FF;">pertain </span>to statesmanship and good business.<br/>

<br/>
present industrial development in the<br/>
<br/>
South is a revival and not an initial<br/>
movement. Mr. Harry Hammond, of Beach<br/>
Island, S. C., has said that in 1810 the manufactured products of Virginia, the Carolinas,<br/>
and Georgia exceeded those of all the New<br/>
England States taken together. Certain it is<br/>
that in the Colonial days and in the early days<br/>
of the Republic, the South had a well-developed<br/>
and thriving system of <span style="color: #ff0000;">manufactures.- </span>In<br/>
transportation, the South also led. The first<br/>
steamship that crossed the ocean went out of<br/>
Savannah. The South Carolina Railway, constructed from Charleston to Hamburg, 140<br/>
miles, was probably the biggest engineering<br/>
enterprise in America when it was building.<br/>
The thing which hindered and ultimately<br/>
nearly dried up the manufacturing and commercial interests <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the South was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">institution </span>of slavery. The introduction of cotton<br/>
production into the South enhanced the value<br/>
of slaves and, with slave labor, cotton production required less effort and yielded more<br/>
profit than manufactures and commerce.<br/>
Following the invention of the cotton gin,<br/>
the number of slaves in the cotton-growing<br/>
states was rapidly increased by importation,<br/>
largely from other parts of the United<br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
The constantly growing influence of slavery<br/>
finally stopped white immigration altogether,<br/>
and went further. It stimulated a tide of white<br/>
emigration from the South Atlantic States to<br/>
the Northwest. Lincoln, Harrison, and others<br/>
<br/>
IT HAS often been pointed out that the<br/>
<br/>
were in this Northwest tide. It stimulated<br/>
another tide of emigration to the Southwest.<br/>
This was made up of the sons of slaveholders,<br/>
with slaves, seeking more land. By 1830 the<br/>
production of a few staple crops with slave<br/>
labor was practically all that was left. Cotton,<br/>
tobacco, rice, and sugar, all with slave labor,<br/>
absorbed the time of the managing white folk<br/>
in the South, and the industrial workers who<br/>
did not get away settled in the mountains or<br/>
became very poor in the low country.<br/>
<br/>
We often hear that the immigrant <span style="color: #ff0000;">ceased<br/>
</span>coming South because of the Negro. This is a<br/>
misunderstanding of the subject. It was <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>institution of slavery and not the Negro which<br/>
dried up manufactures and commerce, which<br/>
stopped white <span style="color: #ff0000;">immigation </span>to the South, and<br/>
which stimulated white emigration from the<br/>
South to the Northwest. The Negro has had<br/>
no more influence on these movements than<br/>
the Indian had. The Negro is here still, in<br/>
greater numbers than ever, and in his presence<br/>
manufactures and commerce have revived,<br/>
and white emigration has ceased and white<br/>
immigration has set in anew.<br/>
<br/>
It has been estimated that within sixty miles<br/>
of Charlotte, N. C., there are available water<br/>
powers sufficient to develop 1,000,000 horsepower. Reckoning one horse-power as the<br/>
equivalent of ten man-power, this would make<br/>
the power of these rivers capable of doing as<br/>
much work as 10,000,000 common laborers.<br/>
This is probably not more than one-third the<br/>
power in the Piedmont region in Virginia, the<br/>
Carolinas, and Georgia.<br/>
