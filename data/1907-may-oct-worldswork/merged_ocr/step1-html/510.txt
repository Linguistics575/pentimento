<br/>
of it, are fitting up their homes with more of<br/>
the comforts of modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">times</span>, are buying<br/>
machinery and tools that will increase their<br/>
productive power. The figures show that the<br/>
people bought more breadstuffs, twice as much<br/>
codfish, twice as large a quantity of vegetables,<br/>
more than twice as much meat and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dairy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">products</span>. It suggests a happier state of existence,<br/>
for example, in the case of a poor tenant I<br/>
once saw on the trail northwest of Coamo.<br/>
It was Sunday morning and he had evidently<br/>
been to a small country store a mile or two<br/>
from his hut, to get supplies for his Sunday<br/>
dinner. He was bareheaded, barefooted, and<br/>
clothed in garments of cheap cotton cloth. In<br/>
one hand he carried a small piece of codfish;<br/>
in the other was a large yam potato. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Experience </span>had already taught me that this food<br/>
supply was for no ordinary occasion.<br/>
<br/>
In the last five years, Porto Rico's clothing<br/>
bill has increased about <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>per cent. and<br/>
much of the clothing has gone to the classes<br/>
that needed it the most. The people have<br/>
bought four times as much furniture, more<br/>
than four times as much of things made of<br/>
iron and steel, and nearly every ship brings<br/>
over one or more automobiles.<br/>
<br/>
When we turn to the things which the island<br/>
has produced and sold, the facts are <span style="color: #0000FF;">equally<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>indicate hundreds of acres, and x less than 100 acres.<br/>
New regions are being cleared<br/>
<br/>
encouraging. Dr Willoughby says that the<br/>
value of the exports for last year was nearly<br/>
three times as much as in 1901, so it is easy<br/>
to see that the income of the farmer is <span style="color: #0000FF;">increasing</span>, and this means a rise in wages for the laboring class. The best year the island ever had<br/>
under Spanish rule was 1896, yet Porto Rico<br/>
did twice as much business last year. And<br/>
it is somewhat gratifying to know that most<br/>
of this business came to us and that the products were shipped in American bottoms.<br/>
We sent to Porto Rico last year eight times as<br/>
much as we sent in 1898 (troops excepted),<br/>
and one-fourth as much as we sold in all the<br/>
markets of South <span style="color: #0000FF;">America</span>.<br/>
<br/>
TEACHING THE PLANTERS NEW TRICKS<br/>
<br/>
The American in the role of a teacher of<br/>
tropical farming seems an anomaly, but the<br/>
results of his teaching speak for themselves.<br/>
Take the sugar planter first, since sugar is<br/>
king in Porto Rico. We have taught the large<br/>
planter the economy of using <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-plow</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>instead of oxen; he has thus increased his<br/>
acreage. New methods of irrigation have<br/>
opened up districts that once were unprofitable<br/>
for cane. Great sugar "centrals" costing<br/>
millions of dollars, with machinery for grinding<br/>
the cane of a thousand acres, have shoved into<br/>
<br/>

An electric line across the island, driven by the power of a single<br/>
fall, is now <span style="color: #ff0000;">projected<br/>
