per cent. of the total area of the United States.<br/>
It is a rather startling fact to face that this very<br/>
considerable proportion of the country's area<br/>
has an aggregate population no larger than<br/>
the ordinary course of immigration has brought<br/>
to us in a single <span style="color: #0000FF;">twelvemonth</span>.<br/>
<br/>
One may or may not take alarm at the mere<br/>
matter of numbers. The adding of a round<br/>
million of foreign-born to our population<br/>
every year is not necessarily ruinous to the<br/>
essential interests of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nation-even </span>to the<br/>
ultimate survival of the American as a type of<br/>
cultivated human being. The country and<br/>
its resources are enormous. Its population<br/>
is relatively small. There is still an abundance<br/>
of room-for the right sort of people. The<br/>
discouraging fact which cannot be evaded,<br/>
however, is that along with the increase in<br/>
volume of immigration has gone a hardly less<br/>
pronounced falling off in quality. There is no<br/>
need to argue the question whether one race<br/>
of people is inherently better or more capable<br/>
than another. Probably in the long run the<br/>
conclusion would be that, the habit of a thousand generations of one's ancestors being <span style="color: #0000FF;">hard<br/>

<br/>
</span>to overcome, we still allow mere differences<br/>
of race to shape our judgments far more than<br/>
is really <span style="color: #0000FF;">justifiable</span>. But, as practical affairs<br/>
go, everybody understands that some peoples<br/>
are more industrious than others; that some<br/>
are more ambitious than others; that some<br/>
assimilate with their neighbors and perpetuate<br/>
the better qualities of both, while others herd<br/>
together and accentuate their own deficiencies.<br/>
In other words, men springing from certain<br/>
stocks are eminently more desirable as immigrants than are their cousins in whose veins<br/>
flows a different blood.<br/>

THE CLASS OF IMMIGRANTS CHANGING<br/>
<br/>
It is a commonplace that since about 1885<br/>
there has been a profound change in the predominant elements of our immigrant population. The cardinal fact is the shifting of the<br/>
preponderance from the Celtic and Teutonic<br/>
peoples of the north and west of Europe to<br/>
the Iberian and Slavic stocks of the south and<br/>
east. If one will cast up the percentages<br/>
representing the relative proportion of immigrants from the leading European <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries<br/>
