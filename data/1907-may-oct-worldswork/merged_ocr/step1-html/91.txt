tion there lands him promptly in a penal workhouse, where he gets no dinner till he has earned<br/>
it, where he lives in a cell deprived of tobacco,<br/>
visits, and the privilege of free correspondence.<br/>
Six months is the shortest term he can hope for,<br/>
and then release means only return to an ordinary workhouse, where he stays till the<br/>
authorities believe he has acquired the habit of<br/>
work. They say that when a man has once<br/>
been through the rigors of a term in a Danish<br/>
penal workhouse, he never wants to go back.<br/>
The system works; it regenerates confirmed<br/>
paupers. Why should it not work on our side<br/>
of the big pond?<br/>
<br/>
Not satisfied with "making it hot" for<br/>
paupers, Denmark goes further and offers a<br/>
powerful incentive to a life of honest work.<br/>
Every working man and woman who has<br/>
lived blameless, neither committing crime,<br/>
nor being guilty of drunkenness or immorality,<br/>
nor accepting pauper aid, graduates at sixty<br/>
into the honor of an old-age pension. That is,<br/>
of course, in case they have no money for their<br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Now the spectre of our aged poor is the poorhouse. But the Danish old-age homes do not<br/>
mean heart-break, but proud content. The<br/>
distinction of the pension draws the sting of<br/>
"coming on the State." The homes are delightful places. with private rooms, prettily<br/>
furnished; military bands play in the gardens,<br/>
and a general air of cosy comfort prevails.<br/>
The pensioners are free to go where they<br/>
choose and to receive visitors how and when<br/>
they please. Under no unnecessary <span style="color: #0000FF;">surveillance</span>, they are as contented as kittens.<br/>
<br/>
These are the deserving old people. But<br/>
in Denmark even the undeserving aged get a<br/>
soft berth. They are called paupers, which<br/>
is in itself a terrible thing. But then they are<br/>
beautifully taken care of. In Copenhagen,<br/>
the "Almindelig" is like Elmira, divided into<br/>
three grades according to the respectability of<br/>
the inmates, and the aged paupers have a<br/>
chance to rise to greater privileges and comforts<br/>
if they choose to mend their ways. For Denmark never wholly despairs of reforming a<br/>
pauper until he is dead. The poorhouse is for<br/>
the aged alone; no insane, demented, nor<br/>
inebriate old folks are ever lodged there, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">110 </span>infants nor human wreckage drift in to<br/>
complicate the problems of the institution,<br/>
which is managed solely for the good of old<br/>
people. There are libraries and <span style="color: #ff0000;">smokingrooms </span>and gardens. The inmates can work<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
if they like and sell their bits of knitting and<br/>
their hand-made shoes, keeping the money for<br/>
themselves. Were it not for the name "<span style="color: #0000FF;">pauper</span>," they would be quite content.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from its human kindliness, this system<br/>
has two striking advantages over our own<br/>
method of caring for the aged and indigent.<br/>
With us, the fortunate few are housed by private<br/>
charity in old-age homes where it is to be feared<br/>
they are altogether too much managed by<br/>
assiduous and philanthropically minded boards<br/>
of ladies. For the rest, there is nothing but<br/>
the poorhouse; and the muck-rake all too<br/>
seldom betrays the squalid misery of such. Not<br/>
only are the Danish old-age homes under<br/>
responsible official management, instead of<br/>
being subject to the whims and wranglings of<br/>
private charitable boards, but they are wide<br/>
open to visitors. The sunlight of publicity<br/>
destroys the germs of "graft."<br/>
<br/>
HELPING PEOPLE TO SELF-HELP<br/>
<br/>
In America, we are just learning that the<br/>
greatest gift you can give a blind man is the<br/>
ability to earn his own living. Denmark<br/>
extends that boon to the halt and maimed as<br/>
well as to the blind. A workman crippled in<br/>
a Danish factory knows precisely what to do.<br/>
He goes to the School for Disabled Workers<br/>
and learns to support himself without the lost<br/>
arm or leg or finger, as the case may be. The<br/>
school has made an exhaustive study of trade<br/>
chances for crippled folk. It provides tools,<br/>
food, medicine, and free orthopedic treatment<br/>
for its unfortunate pupils, buys their work as<br/>
soon as it is salable, and once they know a<br/>
trade finds them positions. Here is a prophecy<br/>
for the future extension of the American movement for the industrial independence of the<br/>
blind.<br/>
<br/>
Although not a public <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficence </span>nor a<br/>
private charity but a cold business proposition, the Danish Garden Union deserves mention here. It leases garden plots to city people<br/>
cooped up in tenements. On the outskirts<br/>
of Copenhagen, great tracts of land are fenced<br/>
in and divided off into hundreds of tiny individual gardens, each with summerhouse and<br/>
seats, where the pueblo dwellers may come<br/>
to delve in the soil to raise their own salad and<br/>
flowers, and to take tea under their own vine<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fig </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tree</span>. We have tried the municipal<br/>
potato patch: Why not rent out the waste<br/>
lands in garden plots to the poor?<br/>
