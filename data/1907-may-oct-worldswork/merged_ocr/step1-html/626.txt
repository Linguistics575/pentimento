of the worst injuries to the community, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, have been the result rather of stupidity<br/>
and incompetence on the part of the municipal<br/>
authorities than of dishonesty. Schools have<br/>
not been provided in <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>number or in the<br/>
right places; roads and bridges have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">illplanned</span>, ill-paved, and badly maintained;<br/>
water systems have been frequently polluted,<br/>
and even left polluted for long periods, as at<br/>
Pittsburg; the police department has sometimes been so corrupt and ill-disciplined as to<br/>
become in parts of great cities the ally of vice,<br/>
and the corruptor instead of the protector of<br/>
society; pay-rolls have been padded; inspectors<br/>
have been unfaithful; unreasonable wages have<br/>
been paid for a bad day's work and exaggerated<br/>
prices for street lamps and other city supplies;<br/>
trades unions have been allowed to introduce<br/>
their low standards of industry and good-will,<br/>
and with consummate <span style="color: #0000FF;">selfishness </span>to keep nonunion laborers out of cities which were in utmost<br/>
need of abundant labor; the term "city laborer"<br/>
has become a discreditable title instead of a<br/>
peculiarly honorable one, as it should be, and<br/>
valuable long-term franchises have been given<br/>
to monopolistic corporations without adequate<br/>
compensation to the city.<br/>
<br/>
CITY GOVERNMENT BY COMMISSIONS<br/>
<br/>
These evils have within recent years become<br/>
so deplorable that many efforts have been made<br/>
in a partial and detached way to remedy them.<br/>
One tolerably successful method has been to<br/>
take out of the hands of city governments large<br/>
portions of their work, and assign them to <span style="color: #ff0000;">stateappointed </span>commissions. Thus, in Boston, all<br/>
the park work is in the hands of two commissions-one city, the other state-appointed; the<br/>
police are governed by an appointed commissioner; the water supply and the main intercepting sewers are in the hands of a state-appointed<br/>
commission; the city library and the city hospital are managed by appointed boards of<br/>
trustees; and the fire department is controlled<br/>
by a single commissioner appointed for that<br/>
one <span style="color: #0000FF;">function</span>, This means, of course, that a<br/>
large amount of municipal business has been<br/>
withdrawn from the mayor, aldermen, and<br/>
council, and placed in the hands of small<br/>
bodies organized each for a special part of the<br/>
city's work.<br/>
<br/>
Another method lately come into successful<br/>
use is to replace the mayor, aldermen, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">council </span>by a single body whose functions are wholly<br/>
administrative. Thus the city of Galveston<br/>
<br/>
GOVERNMENT BY <span style="color: #ff0000;">FEWER<br/>
<br/>
</span>MEN<br/>
<br/>
procured from the legislature of Texas, after<br/>
the tidal-wave catastrophe which almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">destrayed </span>the place, a wholly new city charter<br/>
which gave all city powers to a body of five men,<br/>
of whom three were originally appointed and<br/>
two elected, but all of whom are now elected<br/>
by the people. Each of these five men has a<br/>
large department of the city work to superintend, and together they employ the needed<br/>
experts and conduct the city's business on<br/>
business principles. This venture of the city<br/>
of Galveston, entered upon under desperate<br/>
circumstances, has been so successful that it has<br/>
been copied in several other Texan cities,<br/>
always with good results. Moreover, much<br/>
older and larger cities than Galveston have<br/>
adopted that method for parts of the city<br/>
administration. Thus the public schools have,<br/>
in several American cities, been placed in the<br/>
hands of small boards which themselves do no<br/>
executive work, but only direct and organize<br/>
the experts they employ. A good example of<br/>
this method of accomplishing honestly and<br/>
efficiently municipal work has been set by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Congress </span>in appointing a small commission to carry<br/>
on the whole municipal business of the city of<br/>
Washington, including the assessing of taxes<br/>
and the spending of all the money so collected.<br/>
To be sure, the case of Washington is unique,<br/>
because it is neither a manufacturing nor a<br/>
commercial city, and the motives which attract<br/>
to it a considerable population are peculiar.<br/>
The number of members of such a municipal<br/>
board would naturally vary with the size of the<br/>
city; but it never ought to exceed seven. The<br/>
ancient title of mayor might be kept in use by<br/>
giving it to the chairman of the board.<br/>
<br/>
These modes of procuring an honest and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">efficient </span>transaction of municipal business, or<br/>
of portions thereof, resemble the ordinary mode<br/>
of conducting great industrial, financial, and<br/>
transportation companies, and they also recall<br/>
the original New England town government.<br/>
They have, however, been resorted to perforce,<br/>
and not by the desire of the people.<br/>
<br/>
It has often been alleged that effective commissions of this sort are undemocratic, that they<br/>
escape from the control of the people, and become arbitrary and inconsiderate in their<br/>
methods and manners. This objection requires<br/>
some examination. In the first place, every<br/>
commission, every small school committee, and<br/>
every complete city government, like that of<br/>
Galveston, acts under a state statute or charter<br/>
which defines its duties and powers. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">there</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
