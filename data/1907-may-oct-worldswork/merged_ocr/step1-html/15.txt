<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">OLITICS </span>is sometimes war, and this<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">P </span>is one of the times, especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>Republican politics. The contest is<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and is to be, between that part of the party<br/>
which favors Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roosevelt</span>'s policies and<br/>
that part which opposes them; and the<br/>
most pronounced enemies of these policies<br/>
are, of course, some of the great railroad and<br/>
corporation "Interests." This conflict came<br/>
suddenly to a sharp clash with the collision of<br/>
the President and Mr. Harriman; and the<br/>
story divides itself into two parts.<br/>
<br/>
The first part has to do with the present<br/>
split in the Republican party. The conflict<br/>
has been made an open one by the President;<br/>
and, as usual, he takes the people into his confidence. There is no doubt that the mass of<br/>
people are opposed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">political </span>domination,<br/>
or even to the suspected political domination,<br/>
of the corporations. The President will win<br/>
in this contest in spite of the violence that he<br/>
does to the traditions of his office, which are<br/>
traditions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">dignified </span>silence under attack.<br/>
Yet, when we speak of traditions of dignified<br/>
silence, it is well to recall that Andrew Jackson<br/>
once held the Presidential <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>, and he, too,<br/>
was a good fighter.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever plans the Great Interests may<br/>
have or may make against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">President's<br/>
</span>policy, he and his friends have one weapon<br/>
that they lack-the confidence of the people;<br/>
and the people the millions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">people-are<br/>
</span>not sticklers for gentle manners. And they<br/>
do like a fight. If the fight be against political<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">corruptionists</span>, so much more to their liking.<br/>
The revelations of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Harriman's <span style="color: #0000FF;">political<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Copyright</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">AM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Doubleday</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>code of morals has dug his grave, and the<br/>
President is again fortunate in his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
THE SCANDAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS<br/>
<br/>
HE other part of the story of these recent<br/>
<br/>
events has to do with the scandal of<br/>
campaign contributions. Why tell again that<br/>
sordid story? All large campaign managers<br/>
have received contributions for which favors<br/>
were expected; and they always will receive<br/>
them so long as two things <span style="color: #ff0000;">esist- </span>(r) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">protective </span>tariff, and (2) secrecy about the origin<br/>
and use of these funds. Mr. Harriman <span style="color: #0000FF;">expected </span>pay, in some form, for his contribution <span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>
</span>that's the kind of man that Mr. Harriman is.<br/>
And most men who make large contributions<br/>
are like him, and they have generally got what<br/>
they paid for. That is the greatest scandal in<br/>
our political life.<br/>
<br/>
Most men would have known that Mr.<br/>
Harriman and his like <span style="color: #0000FF;">expected </span>pay in some<br/>
form for the contributions. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the President<br/>
and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">campaign </span>managers did not know this,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">then-well</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">then-of </span>course they knew it.<br/>
That Mr. Roosevelt ever promised <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pay<br/>
</span>or protection or <span style="color: #0000FF;">favor </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">contribution</span>,<br/>
nobody ever for a moment <span style="color: #0000FF;">believed</span>. But<br/>
that whole system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">campaigning </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">malorlor<br/>
</span>ous; for the devil pays the bill. And even<br/>
if you afterwards kick the devil downstairs,<br/>
you may <span style="color: #0000FF;">save </span>your soul, but what <span style="color: #0000FF;">about<br/>
</span>accepting his help and then having to <span style="color: #0000FF;">punish<br/>
</span>him? It were better not to have his help.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Yet</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">system</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">spee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l.<br/>
