GREAT fall in the price of securities has<br/>
A been taking place the world over; large<br/>
borrowers-railroad companies, for instance-have had an increasing difficulty for a<br/>
year or more in borrowing money for pressing<br/>
improvements and many of them have had to<br/>
give up their efforts. There is not available<br/>
money enough to keep up with the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">demands </span>of industry, for reasons that have been<br/>
explained many times in this magazine. But<br/>
this state of the money market has now <span style="color: #0000FF;">become </span>so acute that the usual superstitions are<br/>
repeated and the easily provoked fear of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>circles asserts itself; and these seem<br/>
to make it worth while to set down here the<br/>
simple, fundamental facts on which our <span style="color: #ff0000;">prospcrityrcsts-to </span>write common sense about the<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
THE FOUNDATIONS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>PROSPERITY<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">HERE </span>are three things required to make<br/>
wealth and to keep the people prosperous. They are productive work to be<br/>
done, men to do it, and money or credit to do<br/>
it with. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>have all three. There is a plenty<br/>
of productive work to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">done</span>, work that<br/>
supplies the needs of mankind and adds to the<br/>
real wealth of the world-land to be tilled,<br/>
mines and forests to be worked, materials of<br/>
every sort to make useful things of, and hauling<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>done-in other words, agriculture, mining,<br/>
manufactures, transportation, and all the<br/>
activities that these imply. Ours is, therefore,<br/>
a land both of plenty and of industry. There<br/>
is no lack of wealth to be got for work and<br/>
there is no lack of energy in working for it.<br/>
The millions of productive Americans who<br/>
<br/>
sow and reap and <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>and make and distribute<br/>
commodities of every sort are supplying the<br/>
real needs of society-the necessities of life.<br/>
Rich as we have become, a very small proportion of the work done in the United States, or<br/>
of the raw material used up, goes into mere<br/>
luxuries or into any other form of economic<br/>
waste. Most of it goes to make things that are<br/>
necessary for the food and the shelter and the<br/>
health and the comfort and the convenience<br/>
of mankind. The margin of wasted work is<br/>
yet very small.<br/>
<br/>
There is, then, nothing the matter with the<br/>
resources of the country and nothing the matter<br/>
with the energy or the industry of the people.<br/>
<br/>
Now let us consider the third thing that keeps<br/>
prosperity going-money to work with. That,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">too</span>, has been productively used during this<br/>
long period of prosperity. Nobody has <span style="color: #0000FF;">hoarded<br/>
</span>it. Many men have become rich, but the rich<br/>
have been using their money in productive<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ways</span>. They have built and equipped and<br/>
conducted railroads; they have cut forests;<br/>
they have mined metals; they have built <span style="color: #0000FF;">lilo<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tories </span>and most of their investments have been<br/>
made in our own country. Capital has <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowed<br/>
</span>freely into all sorts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">profitable </span>uses. A man<br/>
who could make money has been able to get<br/>
money to work with. The distribution of<br/>
capital for productive uses has been easy.<br/>
<br/>
And these three things have made us <span style="color: #ff0000;">prosperous-wa </span>land of plenty, men to work, money<br/>
to work with that could be got in small sums<br/>
or big sums for profit-earning uses.<br/>
<br/>
Now no change has come or is coming in the<br/>
productive possibilities of the country. Nor is<br/>
any change coming in the industrious <span style="color: #0000FF;">habits<br/>
