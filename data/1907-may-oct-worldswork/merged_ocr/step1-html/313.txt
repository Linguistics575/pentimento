WENTY-THREE years ago, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
I William J. Hammer, an electrical engineer, equipped his residence in Newark,<br/>
<br/>
N. J., with electricity. On entering it, the<br/>
pressure of his foot on the first step lighted the<br/>
bulbs around the number over the door. The<br/>
next step <span style="color: #0000FF;">rang </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>front door bell, and the third<br/>
automatically opened the door. By putting his<br/>
foot upon a small rest and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pressing </span>a pendant<br/>
bulb, he set two small brushes at work cleaning<br/>
his shoes. When he reached the top of the first<br/>
flight of stairs, the light in the hallway went out<br/>
and the light in his bedroom was lit; and it, in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">turn</span>, went out when he laid his head on the<br/>
pillow. Part of the cooking in this house was<br/>
done by electricity and seven different musical<br/>
instruments were <span style="color: #0000FF;">electrically </span>played. Mr.<br/>
Hammer decorated a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Christmas-tree </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">lily<br/>
</span>electric lights instead of candles. He sent up<br/>
rockets, Roman candles, and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">fircworks<br/>
</span>by electricity. At a dinner given to the<br/>
Franklin Society, a phonograph inside a <span style="color: #ff0000;">lifesized </span>figure of the philosopher repeated the<br/>
sayings of "Poor Richard," and a tiny <span style="color: #0000FF;">circular<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>electric railway was employed to carry the<br/>
electrically cooked food around the table<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>There are now many "<span style="color: #ff0000;">clcctrical</span>" houses<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
