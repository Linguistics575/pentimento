of hammering. Old buildings are being renovated; adobe and stone and mortar are undergoing transformation. In other cities there<br/>
is the same phenomenon. In Guadalajara a<br/>
thousand substantial buildings are going up,<br/>
and labor is at a premium. The new factories<br/>
in Monterey require modern dwellings for the<br/>
operatives. Saltillo is laying out suburban<br/>
sections and has under construction a smelter,<br/>
a rubber factory, a theatre, a big store, and<br/>

THE NEW POST-OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY<br/>
<br/>
This, the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>government building, is one of a group to be constructed<br/>
<br/>
two <span style="color: #0000FF;">flour </span>mills. In San Luis Potosi the <span style="color: #0000FF;">demand </span>for houses exceeds the rapidity of their<br/>
building. There are old ones in plenty, but<br/>
American residents want the new kind, with<br/>
electric lights and running water, and the<br/>
Mexicans are beginning to want them too.<br/>
Now when the sluggish landlords of Latin<br/>
America are pried loose by a boom, then <span style="color: #0000FF;">you<br/>
</span>may know that the germ of enterprise has<br/>
actually gotten into the blood. It alters <span style="color: #0000FF;">noth<br/>
</span>tremendous harbor works at either end. For<br/>
Mexico and its future, it is one of the superb<br/>
strokes of history-making. Even so long<br/>
ago as the time of Philip I, the Spaniards<br/>
planned to dig a canal through the 190 miles<br/>
of the Tehuantepec neck, and they did make<br/>
a first survey. Later, after our war with<br/>
Mexico, we sought concessions for the same<br/>
thing, and it was not until 1880 that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tehuantepec </span>canal project was abandoned for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
