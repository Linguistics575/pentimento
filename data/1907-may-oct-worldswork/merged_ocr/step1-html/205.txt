STATES<br/>
<br/>
THE CHANGES OF TEN YEARS<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">EN </span>years ago, I made a <span style="color: #ff0000;">two-months'<br/>
<br/>
</span>journey through all the Southern<br/>
<br/>
States east of Texas, to write of <span style="color: #0000FF;">what<br/>
<br/>
</span>I saw for The Atlantic Monthly. It'was a<br/>
journey that yielded many pleasant experiences.<br/>
I saw, of course, the routine of activity in the<br/>
principal cities from Richmond to New Orleans,<br/>
and in these cities there was a very considerable<br/>
prosperity. Men of large affairs were steadily<br/>
building fortunes; transportation systems were<br/>
in course of formation and consolidation; and<br/>
throughout the country there were fair crops.<br/>
You could see a deal of energy and <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>hopeful<br/>
men; and, as any other traveler who had<br/>
acquaintances and friends throughout this<br/>
region, I found the journey full of pleasure and<br/>
instruction. I went to many small towns also<br/>
and made journeys into the country in several<br/>
states. In the country as in the towns, I<br/>
encountered the natural <span style="color: #ff0000;">eheerfulness </span>and<br/>
hospitality of the people; but the farmers <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>not making money. There was almost uni<br/>
versal complaint that they were in debt to the<br/>
merchants. Many of the merchants, in turn,<br/>
were themselves in debt; and away from the<br/>
activity of the larger trading and manufacturing<br/>
centres one heard much more about <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>than about triumphs.<br/>
<br/>
There was a somewhat similar impression<br/>
made by visits to the centres of education.<br/>
The men who were conducting the colleges<br/>
and universities were working with heroic<br/>
devotion, but almost everywhere with pitifully<br/>
meagre equipment; and there was a certain<br/>
depression in the tone in which they spoke of<br/>
their problems. In talking with men, singly<br/>
or in clubs or at dinners, either in commercial<br/>
circles or in educational circles, the hard times<br/>
of the past was still the most frequent topic of<br/>
conversation. Men spoke of the burden imposed by Reconstruction; they talked about<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>of developing the country <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>capital; many men whom you would<br/>
expect to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">welI-informed </span>spoke with a sort of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
