EN years ago, in a magazine descriptive<br/>
<br/>
I of the general growth of the Southern<br/>
<br/>
States, a statement of the development of the library as an institution which<br/>
largely affected the life of the South would<br/>
scarcely have found a place. Then there was<br/>
no clearly defined, well-organized library movement. The free public library, the finest product of all library development, was scarcely<br/>
known.<br/>
<br/>
But the modern library-rural, public, college, and traveling-has, since 1896, firmly<br/>
established itself as an institution making for<br/>
saner life and broader culture.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly the most notable step taken has been<br/>
the establishment <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the rural school library.<br/>
In North Carolina, when the educational<br/>
qualification for suffrage was enacted, something very definite in the way of greater educational facilities for all the people had to be<br/>
provided. The legislature of 1901 equipped,<br/>
with the aid of funds raised by the school<br/>
districts and counties, at least six rural<br/>
school libraries in each of the ninety-seven<br/>
counties. By means of further appropriations<br/>
in 1903 and 1905, the number of libraries in<br/>
each county was increased from six to eighteen,<br/>
and on June 30th, 1906, 1,400 of these libraries,<br/>
containing a total of <span style="color: #ff0000;">12 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5,000 </span>volumes, were in<br/>
operation in the state.<br/>
<br/>
In Virginia, the same idea has been carried<br/>
out by a system of traveling school libraries,<br/>
which has been operative since October, 1906,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">2,62 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>volumes have been put in immediate<br/>
circulation. Libraries containing fifty volumes<br/>
each are made up from it and sent out daily<br/>
to the rural school stations throughout the state.<br/>
Every station is allowed to keep its collection for<br/>
four or six months, and then to send it back to<br/>
the state library to receive a new collection.<br/>
<br/>
At the close of December, 1906, twenty<br/>
thoroughly equipped Carnegie libraries, <span style="color: #ff0000;">repfcsenting </span>$ 537,000 in buildings, were in operation<br/>
in Texas. Since 1897, Durham, Raleigh,<br/>
<br/>
WILSON<br/>
<br/>
Greensboro, Asheville, Charlotte, and other<br/>
North Carolina towns, a score or more in all,<br/>
have established public libraries, and during<br/>
the year 1906 the <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>towns just named recorded loans totaling <span style="color: #0000FF;">200,000 </span>volumes among<br/>
25,000 borrowers. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">rgor6</span>, Virginia and<br/>
Arkansas each established its first three public<br/>
libraries. Within the past six months, Atlanta<br/>
has received $ 30,000 for two additional branch<br/>
libraries, Louisville $ 2oo, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ooo </span>for eight similar<br/>
branch stations, and the New Orleans library<br/>
is just finishing its $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">200,000 </span>quarters.<br/>
<br/>
The most significant fact growing out of the<br/>
activities of these public libraries, however, is<br/>
not that they have been placed on a sound<br/>
financial basis and are recording a splendid<br/>
total of loans, but rather that they have tended<br/>
to reproduce themselves in other communities.<br/>
In Charlotte, Atlanta, Austin, Louisville, Chattanooga, Nashville-in fact, in all the larger<br/>
towns-the public library has been a fertile<br/>
centre from which decidedly active influences<br/>
have spread. In each of these libraries, a<br/>
system of apprenticeship and general library<br/>
instruction has been maintained which has<br/>
quickened individual growth, and a publicity<br/>
bureau has been operated which has helped to<br/>
form and crystallize a fine, general library<br/>
sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
Southern college libraries have also undergone a complete revolution in spirit, although<br/>
their growth has not been so apparent as that<br/>
of the school and public libraries. While<br/>
they have not served the public directly, they<br/>
have served it none the less effectively by<br/>
impressing the student with the true importance of the library as an institution. Quietly,<br/>
but at the same time enthusiastically, they<br/>
have worked their way up to a place of dignity<br/>
and power in college life. Ten years ago,<br/>
the library was useful to the student of literature primarily, and not to the college as a whole;<br/>
but, since it has come to be more and more a<br/>
perfectly equipped laboratory, and since the<br/>
