</span>the water, four or five huge alligators immediately ran out of the muddy water toward us.<br/>
I confess that here my courage quailed a bit<br/>
and I thought that a few distant shots were all<br/>
I should succeed in getting. But by throwing<br/>
meat to them, they were kept at <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>safe distance<br/>
and the long poles were a great protection if<br/>
they tried to come too near. Two days I<br/>
visited the place and, after many hours of<br/>
manoeuvring, I managed to get such pictures<br/>
of these brutes <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>I am confident are better<br/>
than anything previously done.<br/>

of his snout on my boot and his jaws snapped<br/>

Many others have enriched our current<br/>
literature of photography at the risk of their<br/>
lives. Mr. Lindpaintner, the only photographer in Port Arthur during the siege, had<br/>
his studio wrecked by a Japanese shell. Mr.<br/>
E. <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>Curtis, of Seattle, spent eight years and<br/>
almost lost his life in taking photographs of<br/>
Indians in the Southwest. To get <span style="color: #0000FF;">unconscious<br/>

<br/>
</span>AT THE FOOT <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>203 METRE HILL<br/>
A shell like that bursting on the hill struck the photographer's studio in Port Arthur and completely wrecked it<br/>
<br/>
making photographs of them, and I doubt if<br/>
you ever saw a stereograph of a man in a more<br/>
dangerous position. You will see I am not<br/>
ten feet from the open jaws of an immense<br/>
brute. So enthusiastic was I, that in successive<br/>
views I approached nearer and nearer until,<br/>
discarding the advice of the men with the poles<br/>
who were behind me, I approached within<br/>
seven feet of the fiercest and finest of the lot.<br/>
This rash act nearly cost me my life. Just<br/>
as I let the shutters go on the second picture<br/>
of him, the brute rushed at me with an awful<br/>
snort. I turned and ran as the men shouted,<br/>
and not a moment too soon; before the men<br/>
<br/>
Indians against having their pictures taken,<br/>
he used a deceptive-angle camera, which takes<br/>
pictures at the side while it seems to<br/>
point in front. Mr. Ellsworth Huntington has<br/>
photographs of the canyon of the Euphrates,<br/>
although there is not a native along its banks<br/>
who has ever been down the gorge. Mr. Frank<br/>
A. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Perret </span>took photographs from the observatory on Mt. Vesuvius while the volcano was in<br/>
violent eruption. Lhasa is no longer a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">forbidden</span>" city, for a man may sit quietly in<br/>
Washington or London and look over picture<br/>
after picture of its mysteries. In the summer of<br/>
