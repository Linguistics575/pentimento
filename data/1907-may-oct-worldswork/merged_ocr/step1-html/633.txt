A METHOD OF INOCULATION TO INCREASE THE RESISTING POWER OF THE BLOOD<br/>

DR. EDWARD A. AYERS<br/>
<br/>
F THE defences of the human body,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>the skin is the outer wall, impenetrable<br/>
to all bacterial foes save a few. But<br/>
there are hordes ever ready at an <span style="color: #0000FF;">instant's<br/>
</span>opportunity to rush in through a break in the<br/>
wall or to enter through an open gate. There<br/>
are natural gates to the fortress, such as the<br/>
eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth. Each<br/>
has its own peculiar guards-tears, wax, mucus, and automatic gates; and many of these<br/>
entrance tunnels are lined with out-sweeping<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">brooms-fine </span>hairs, similar to the "nap" or<br/>
"pile" of carpet or plush-which constantly<br/>
sweep back and forth like wheat stalks waving<br/>
in the breeze. You cannot see them with the<br/>
low-powered eye, but neither can you see the<br/>
germs. They sweep the mucus from lungs and<br/>
throat and try to keep the ventilators free from<br/>
dust and germs. Behind the scarf wall of the<br/>
skin and the broom-brigade of the mucous<br/>
membranes, the soldier corpuscles of the blood<br/>
march around the entire fortress every twentyeight seconds. But a cut, a bruise, a cold<br/>
draught, wet feet, a stuffy, germ-laden room<br/>
upset the routine and there is a rush of thousands of white blood-cells to the break.<br/>
<br/>
Within the body's protecting wall (the skin),<br/>
the blood maintains a standing army of white<br/>
blood-cells, some 30 billions strong. Disease<br/>
germs of various kinds, in varying numbers, are<br/>
constantly scaling the wall or entering the body<br/>
through its natural gates or through abrasions.<br/>
It is the business of the white blood-cells to<br/>
attack these invaders and destroy them before<br/>
they can multiply to the point of producing<br/>
illness. The defense of health is carried on<br/>
by the blood in four ways.<br/>
<br/>
The blood covers some germs with a sticky<br/>
paste and makes them adhere to one another,<br/>
thereby anchoring them so that they become<br/>
as helpless as flies on <span style="color: #0000FF;">fly-paper</span>. The paste<br/>
comes from the liquid of the blood, the plasma.<br/>
Another <span style="color: #0000FF;">blood-weapon </span>(the "lysins") dissolves<br/>
the germs as lye does. A third means of de<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tense </span>is the ability of the white blood-corpuscles to envelope and digest the living germs.<br/>
One white cell can digest dozens of germs but<br/>
it may mean death to the devouring cells.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth and recently discovered weapon<br/>
of the blood is called the opsonins. This is a<br/>
chemical material present in all blood, but in<br/>
varying degree. Metschnikoff demonstrated<br/>
the ability of the white blood-cells to ingest<br/>
bacteria. Sir Edward Wright has shown that<br/>
these cells eat a larger number of bacteria when<br/>
the latter are soaked in opsonins; and also<br/>
that this appetizer can be made in a laboratory<br/>
out of a colony of hot-house bacteria and used<br/>
as a "vaccine," each variety of germ requiring<br/>
opsonic sauce made from juices extracted from<br/>
the bodies of its own species.<br/>
<br/>
We must now stand back a pace, while<br/>
studying this battle picture of cannibal germs<br/>
and devouring blood-cells, and get the perspective of the whole scene. In the complex<br/>
mysteries of immunity lie our weapons for the<br/>
conquest of most of the diseases that kill <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtyfour </span>out of thirty-five human beings before<br/>
they have lived long enough to die of old age.<br/>
Since the day when Jenner proved that vaccination so affects the blood that the smallpox germ can no longer live upon it, it has<br/>
been the accepted tenet of physicians that,<br/>
since there is smallpox immunity, there must<br/>
be immunity from diphtheria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">typhoid</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>, scarlet<br/>
fever, measles, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and<br/>
other diseases. Light began to penetrate this<br/>
mystery when Pasteur evolved the problem of<br/>
germ fermentation.<br/>
<br/>
Immunity is a most complicated subject.<br/>
Why is it that A, having had smallpox, is safe<br/>
from it for a number of years? Why does B,<br/>
equally exposed with C to scarlet fever, retain<br/>
his health while C is stricken? Why is it that<br/>
D lies down and dies from pneumonia while E,<br/>
apparently in equally good or bad condition,<br/>
recovers? Why does cancer attack man but<br/>
pass animals by? Why does the malarial<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
