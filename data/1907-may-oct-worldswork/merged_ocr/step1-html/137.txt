of the harbor front, for example, a half-mile<br/>
stretch of embankment has been left untouched; rising to a height of several feet<br/>
above a beach, this presents the identical prospect which met the eyes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>colonists<br/>
at their approach to these shores. At the<br/>
western extremity stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>clump of towering<br/>
pines, a worthy memorial of the great primeval<br/>
forest, offering a touch of severity that emphasizes the lavishness beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Turning from the water front, with its miles<br/>
of trees and flowers and shrubs and vines, the<br/>
prospect stretches out in pleasing perspective.<br/>
Broad avenues radiate in every direction,<br/>
terminating in secluded spots as inviting as<br/>
any that the solitude of the forest can offer.<br/>
Extending through these grounds is a beautiful<br/>
winding walk, called "Lovers' Lane," with<br/>
overhanging vines and flowering plants, and<br/>
here and there a cozy seat. Near this <span style="color: #0000FF;">walk<br/>
</span>and winding in the same general direction is the<br/>
"Canoe Trail," a beautiful stream of water<br/>
where small boats may glide under rustic<br/>
bridges and through a paradise of beauty.<br/>
The constant breezes from the ocean make<br/>
the whole enclosure delightfully cool<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

<br/>
</span>waters of Hampton Roads, the Government<br/>
has constructed, at a cost of $ 400,000, two<br/>
great piers, with towers for lighthouses and<br/>
wireless telegraphy. These piers are each 200<br/>
feet in width and extend nearly half a mile;<br/>
at their extremities they are connected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>pier of the same width. This latter pier is<br/>
arched in the centre to permit small craft<br/>
to come and go. On the shore line are<br/>
landing stations of handsome design. A<br/>
million incandescent lights illuminate the<br/>
entire length of the pier-way, and monster<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">searchlights </span>surmount the towers. The enclosed harbor affords a measurement of approximately forty acres. In the basin within<br/>
the piers, water sports -are conducted, while<br/>
the ships at anchor in Hampton Roads may<br/>
be reached by boats from the landing places.<br/>
The harbor illumination by night is very<br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
The Jamestown Exposition differs in one<br/>
respect from all other <span style="color: #0000FF;">expositions-most </span>of<br/>
its buildings are to remain permanently.<br/>
Seen from a distance, the effect is that of a<br/>
beautiful group of colonial architecture, this<br/>
