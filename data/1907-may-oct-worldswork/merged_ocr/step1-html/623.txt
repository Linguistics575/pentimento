<span>CITY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN<br/>
<br/>
local highways. His food and fuel, and the<br/>
materials of his clothing and of his shelters<br/>
come to him from afar on steel tracks or over<br/>
the trackless ocean. In short, his real interests<br/>
are, in the majority of cases, not at all local<br/>
in the old sense, and with every decade they<br/>
grow wider and wider. When the former<br/>
local interests thus broadened, the old idea<br/>
of local representation by wards or districts<br/>
became absurd and, like all absurdities in<br/>
government, whether survivals or novelties, bred<br/>
mischiefs.<br/>

TAX-PAYERS SHOULD BE THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">TAX-SPENDERS<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the New England town governments the<br/>
entire adult male population exercised an active<br/>
control over the amount of taxes to be raised,<br/>
and the objects for which public money should<br/>
be spent. Having determined these points, they<br/>
left to a small board of Selectmen the entire<br/>
administrative business of the town. This was<br/>
the wisest and most successful mode of democratic government ever organized. Compare<br/>
with it the condition of an urban population<br/>
to-day in regard to the raising and expenditures<br/>
of taxes. In the first place, in most American<br/>
cities, the people who determine what the taxes<br/>
shall be are not the main body of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">voters-far </span>from it; secondly, the body of taxpayers on<br/>
property do not determine, as in the New<br/>
England town, how the money raised by taxation shall be spent; on the contrary, the number<br/>
of resident individuals who pay taxes on property is almost always less than half the number<br/>
of legal voters; so that the control of expenditures is in the hands of resident individuals<br/>
who pay no taxes on property. In making<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">statement</span>, non- resident taxpayers, and<br/>
corporations and firms which, as such, have no<br/>
vote are of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>excluded. Considering the<br/>
importance which was<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">attached </span>I40 years ago to<br/>
the doctrine, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>taxation without <span style="color: #ff0000;">reprieseiita'tion</span>," it is a singular condition which confronts<br/>
urban populations in the United States, a condition in which the taxpayers have been deprived of every adequate control over the<br/>
expenditure of the taxes they have paid. Of<br/>
course, this condition of things tends strongly<br/>
to public extravagance, because the <span style="color: #ff0000;">nontaxpaying </span>voters believe that their interest lies<br/>
in heavy public expenditures, since they like<br/>
the fruits of expenditure and suppose themselves to make no direct contribution to the<br/>
bearing of the public burdens. They will<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">naturally</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>elect <span style="color: #0000FF;">agents </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their <span style="color: #0000FF;">own </span>sort. This<br/>

is the root of much municipal incompetency<br/>
and wrong-doing.<br/>
<br/>
Another very serious difficulty in municipal<br/>
government is the inadequate size and irrational<br/>
boundaries of the municipal unit for taxation.<br/>
This difficulty has been obviated in some<br/>
measure in some localities by the process of<br/>
annexing large suburban areas to the city<br/>
which is attracting a growing population. There<br/>
still remain, however, many instances in which<br/>
numerous separate municipalities occupy an<br/>
area which ought to be unified for all municipal<br/>
purposes and for taxation. Thus, in Boston<br/>
and the vicinity, the community has learnt that<br/>
it is impossible to provide and carry on satisfactory water systems, sewer systems, and<br/>
park systems through the independent action of<br/>
thirty different municipal organizations within<br/>
eleven miles of the State House; and accordingly separate metropolitan commissions have<br/>
been organized for these purposes. The community has also learnt that it is impossible<br/>
properly to regulate public-franchise corporations by separate municipal action, each municipality working only within certain narrow geographical boundaries which the corporations<br/>
transcend. The state has therefore been called<br/>
upon to provide such supervision. There are,<br/>
however, other municipal departments in which<br/>
the crying need of procuring unity of operation<br/>
has not yet been recognized, as, for instance,<br/>
in the fire departments, police departments, and<br/>
schools. For each one of these departments a<br/>
metropolitan administration is urgently needed,<br/>
the present heterogeneous and dislocated <span style="color: #0000FF;">administrations </span>inevitably producing both waste<br/>
and injustice. It is not too much to say that<br/>
no just method of taxation can be devised to<br/>
cover the three objects of expenditure just<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">nientioned </span>without enlarging the unit of <span style="color: #0000FF;">territory </span>for taxation. The consolidation of different municipalities will generally effect striking economies and also produce increased<br/>
efficiency. Thus, when two contiguous municipalities maintain separate fire-departments, and<br/>
a fire occurs near the dividing line, it is not the<br/>
dozen nearest engines which rush to that <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire</span>;<br/>
the near-by engines of one municipality arrive<br/>
quickly, but the far-off engines of the same<br/>
municipality, coming from a considerable distance, of course arrive late and leave without<br/>
protection the distant regions where their<br/>
houses are situated. Meantime, there were<br/>
plenty of engines within easy reach just across<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">thtlineyof </span>the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">municipality </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wherever<br/>
