<span>TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
there. And there the Judge worked, making<br/>
corrections until the last minute, and as the<br/>
clock struck twelve, he entered the crowded<br/>
court room. Friends had begged him to<br/>
postpone his decision. At least, they said,<br/>
he could have it read by the clerk. And this<br/>
failing, they urged his need of a bodyguard.<br/>
The strikers had sworn that in the event of an<br/>
unfavorable decision he should never leave<br/>
the room alive. Taft sent Phelan to the<br/>
county jail for six months. The Judge was big,<br/>
magnificent, and his kind blue eyes were<br/>
blazing. His concluding words were for those<br/>
who were there to kill him:<br/>
<br/>
"When you men leave this room," he said in<br/>
effect, "I want you to go with the conviction<br/>
that, if there is any power in the army of the<br/>
United States to run those trains, those trains<br/>
shall be run!" And down on the desk before<br/>
him came his great fist.<br/>
<br/>
The strikers gazed up at him as men dazed.<br/>
Judge Taft rose and retired. The court room<br/>
was as quiet as a church. The strikers looked<br/>
askance at one another. They had not<br/>
realized what had happened, and then they<br/>
began straggling out, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Quiet</span>, awed, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncertain</span>. They had not known before that the<br/>
majesty of the law was such a solemn business.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Debs</span>'s mushroom organization of <span style="color: #ff0000;">250,000<br/>
</span>members soon afterward collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
But there were many among the strikers<br/>
who said that Judge Taft had given them a<br/>
fair trial. One day, about six months later,<br/>
a man with a coat slung over his shoulder<br/>
asked to see the Judge. The man was Phelan,<br/>
and he had just finished his sentence. The<br/>
labor element had not worked to defeat Mr.<br/>
Charles P. Taft for Congress, and Phelan may<br/>
have been disgusted with his own martyrdom.<br/>
But, at any rate, he was truly repentant. He<br/>
confessed the charges against him, which he<br/>
had denied at the trial. He had gotten what<br/>
he deserved, he said. Since coming out of<br/>
jail he had seen the misery of the former strikers,<br/>
and he was remorse-stricken. He was willing<br/>
to go back for another six months, he said,<br/>
if the Judge would only get those men reinstated in their jobs. Thereupon Judge Taft<br/>
asked the receiver to abolish the black-list, and<br/>
the men were taken back as vacancies occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every time that Labor has come before<br/>
Judge Taft, Labor has been in the wrong.<br/>
One regrets, on both their accounts, that Labor<br/>
could not have been in the right at least once<br/>
or twice; the Judge might have liked to<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9351<br/>
<br/>
</span>indulge his sympathy. But the irony of circumstances was against him. Once, when yet<br/>
in the Superior Court of Cincinnati, he had to<br/>
decide against the Bricklayers' Union, sustaining the verdict of a lower court <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">damages<br/>
</span>done by conspiracy and boycott.<br/>
<br/>
Again he had to issue a restraining order<br/>
against P. M. Arthur, chief of the Brotherhood<br/>
of Locomotive Engineers. The Toledo & Ann<br/>
Arbor Railroad had a strike, and other roads<br/>
threatened to reject its freight, in fear of a<br/>
sympathetic strike. District Judge Ricks enjoined these roads from carrying out their<br/>
threat. Chief Arthur was included as a defendant, for he was ordering the employees of<br/>
these roads not to handle freight from the Toledo<br/>
& Ann Arbor, and did this even after the injunction. Brought for contempt before Judge<br/>
Ricks and Judge Taft, he pleaded ignorance of<br/>
the injunction. He got off with a notice to<br/>
rescind his orders. There was much bitterness at the time, but one of Arthur's counsel<br/>
has since come out in favor of Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft<br/>
</span>for the Presidency.<br/>
<br/>
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD CORPORATE CRIME<br/>
<br/>
Judge Taft was much more severely disposed,<br/>
however, toward big corporate <span style="color: #0000FF;">insolence</span>. If<br/>
to his mind there is any distinction in kinds of<br/>
lawbreaking, then he hates most that which<br/>
seeks immunity through wealth and influence.<br/>
For eight years after its passage, the Sherman<br/>
Anti-Trust Law was a dead letter. Efforts to<br/>
enforce it had failed, and even the Attorney<br/>
General gave up, announcing that the law was<br/>
inadequate. And then, after all these years,<br/>
a certain powerful combination was <span style="color: #ff0000;">arraigned<br/>
<br/>
</span>before Judge Taft. The case was that<br/>
of the United States vs. the Addyston<br/>
Pipe & Steel Company, et al<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>With <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span>monopoly, the defendants had been taxing<br/>
every city that needed to lay a foot of cast-iron<br/>
pipe. For a month after the hearing, Judge<br/>
Taft delved and groped and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fitted </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tsrether</span>, and<br/>
at the end of the month he came forth with <span style="color: #ff0000;">L<br/>
</span>decision that held good. It was really a <span style="color: #0000FF;">treaty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>on that entire branch of the law in all its phases,<br/>
and is to-day perhaps the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablest </span>work on the<br/>
subject. He began with the old common law<br/>
on contracts, and followed it through each<br/>
stage of growth and development to the last<br/>
law regarding contracts in restraint of trade.<br/>
He broke the legs under this particular<br/>
trust as cleanly as he had broken the backbone of the American Railway Union strike.<br/>
