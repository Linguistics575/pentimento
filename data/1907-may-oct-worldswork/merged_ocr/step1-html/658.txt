of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">week</span>'s most popular visitor or most<br/>
successful hostess or most charming debutante.<br/>
But we are democratic in our <span style="color: #0000FF;">town-we </span>have<br/>
to be, or be lonesome-and the weddings of<br/>
our <span style="color: #0000FF;">ultra-fashionable </span>go into the same august<br/>
column with the wedding of the blacksmith's<br/>
daughter and the butcher's son. It would be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">indiscreet </span>of the banker's wife to protest, for the<br/>
banker of to-day was a blacksmith <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>years<br/>
ago, and everybody knows it. But the society<br/>
reporters give the banker's wife her revenge,<br/>
for when a fashionable crowd spends Sunday<br/>
with a hostess it goes into the paper as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>weekend party," while the same affair in humbler<br/>
circles appears as plain "stayed over Sunday."<br/>
<br/>
Seclusion, also, is a retreat for pride of caste.<br/>
We used to build a house wherever we could<br/>
get a lot we liked, but lately our Brahmins are<br/>
flocking together in exclusive residence districts. Only the elect are encouraged <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">enter<br/>
</span>these districts and they are expected to maintain<br/>
a certain standard of appearances. Of course,<br/>
this is an old story in Eastern towns, but it is a<br/>
new thing for us. We are separating along<br/>
worldly lines, and the old comradeship of<br/>
"classes" is less and less evident.<br/>
<br/>
Our religious ideas have passed through<br/>
some transitions. We used to be mainly<br/>
"shouting" Methodists, and we "got" religion<br/>
at revivals and camp-meetings. These gatherings were tense with emotional excitement.<br/>
Children, at these meetings, their feelings<br/>
wrought upon by pulpit "threats of hell and<br/>
hopes of paradise," by crying women and<br/>
groaning men, went forward to the "mourners'<br/>
bench" and underwent an agony of mental<br/>
torture in an effort to become "converted"-from what they did not know, nor to what,<br/>
nor least of all, why. Sometimes they got<br/>
religion and kept it; sometimes they got it<br/>
and lost it the week after; sometimes<br/>
they did not get it at all. Whatever they got<br/>
was purely an emotional experience, pure<br/>
unreason, often a bitter haunting experience,<br/>
that led sometimes to insanity.<br/>
<br/>
To-day we are not so fond of revivals. We<br/>
follow a little more closely St. Paul's adjuration<br/>
that we know some "reason for the faith that<br/>
is in us," before we accept the faith. Not that<br/>
we are any less religious than we used to be,<br/>
but we have more religions to choose from-so<br/>
wide a range as all the Protestant denominations,<br/>
Catholicism, Christian Science, Unitarianism,<br/>
theosophy, and Buddhism. Naturally, with<br/>
so many paths to salvation, we are more deliber<br/>
OUR TOWN LIFE-WHAT IS IT WORTH?<br/>
<br/>
ate in our choice, we must perforce stop and<br/>
weigh their arguments and balance our faith<br/>
against our reason. As a result, our religion<br/>
is becoming less powerful as the guardian of<br/>
certain traditions of personal conduct, and more<br/>
powerful as a practical force for everyday<br/>
efficient morality and neighborliness, which<br/>
latter is, after all, the substance of most<br/>
religion. And we have fewer people with a<br/>
conception of religion like that of one young<br/>
enthusiast in our town who declined a chance<br/>
to go to college because he had "decided to<br/>
serve the Lord instead."<br/>
<br/>
Other agencies-semi-religious-help in this<br/>
better <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement</span>. The Young Men's Christian<br/>
Association has been revived under the friendly<br/>
cooperation of our business men, and its handsome building, with gymnasium, and bathing<br/>
pool, and reading room, is the lively centre of<br/>
a seven-days-in-the-week religion that includes<br/>
a morality of the body and of the mind and of<br/>
social <span style="color: #0000FF;">amiability </span>as well as the more formal<br/>
religion of dogmas about the soul, and hymns,<br/>
and sermons, and rituals. We are realizing<br/>
in religion what doctors are realizing in <span style="color: #0000FF;">medi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>cine, that the cure of the soul's diseases, like<br/>
the cure of the body's diseases, is a more arduous task than the prevention of disease. When.<br/>
young fellows are kept off the streets and their<br/>
minds off of devilment by wholesome exercise<br/>
that develops muscle and character and the<br/>
spirit of <span style="color: #0000FF;">teamwork </span>that is at the bottom of<br/>
social order and respect for law, there is less of<br/>
the devil's fire to be fought by the churches.<br/>
<br/>
Our society for the prevention of various<br/>
things-cruelty to children, cruelty to animals,<br/>
and the like-as most societies for the performance of thankless jobs, has only one really<br/>
active member, and he the butt of countless<br/>
jokes. But with a zealot's enthusiasm he<br/>
pursues his work with ardor <span style="color: #0000FF;">unquenchable</span>,<br/>
and after all we are grateful to him, when <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
</span>stop to put ourselves in the place of the helpless<br/>
whom he serves. His work is a good one, and<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>our consciences to know that somebody<br/>
else is doing it, and we are glad he enjoys his<br/>
unpleasant task.<br/>
<br/>
We are getting to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be-mo</span>, we are-great<br/>
readers. We had our free public library long<br/>
before Mr. Carnegie gave us a better, permanent<br/>
home for it, and we have used it with increasing<br/>
pleasure. Most of us are not very profound<br/>
in our choice of books: the librarians complain<br/>
that they are forever asked for "something<br/>
new" to <span style="color: #0000FF;">read-the </span>newest fiction<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>But we<br/>
