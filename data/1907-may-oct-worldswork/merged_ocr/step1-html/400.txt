<br/>
restlessness, shown in muscular movements.<br/>
Many times, he says, he has sat in a position<br/>
where he could watch an audience as it listened<br/>
to some long scientific memoir. He took notes<br/>
of how people acted under the strain of protracted attention-how often they moved.<br/>
At the beginning of the hour they would sit<br/>
quietly; then they would begin to move on the<br/>
average of once every four seconds, then<br/>
every three seconds; and he says that it is<br/>
possible to trace right through any audience<br/>
every degree of fatigue by the number of muscular movements made.<br/>
<br/>
He has simply put together mathematically<br/>
some data that are familiar to all of us. We<br/>
have, all seen-and, alas, been a part of-an<br/>
audience that was trying to endure the last<br/>
half hour of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unendurable </span>speech. Everybody was shifting his position, crossing one<br/>
leg over the other or back again, moving the<br/>
fingers, playing with watch-charms or chains,<br/>
yawning, twitching, folding programmes,<br/>
wiping eyeglasses, adjusting back-hair, twisting <span style="color: #0000FF;">mustache</span>. Those were all fatigue signs.<br/>
<br/>
A loss of self-control in small things: that's<br/>
the symptom in different terms; and another<br/>
name for it is irritability.<br/>
<br/>
At first, it seems strange that this undue<br/>
sensitiveness to slight stimuli should be so sure<br/>
an effect of fatigue; but it means that the<br/>
resistance gates are down, and we become<br/>
aware of sensations pouring in from all sides,<br/>
slight sensations that ordinarily we take no<br/>
notice of because-by the laws of <span style="color: #0000FF;">attention-<br/>
</span>A NEGRO'S UPHILL CLIMB<br/>
<br/>
they are quietly shut out from our consciousness.<br/>
But when our attention is tired-no longer<br/>
focused, but scattering-all these slight <span style="color: #ff0000;">nervepricks </span>attack us insistently and we cannot<br/>
neglect them.<br/>
<br/>
A noise that you <span style="color: #0000FF;">Will </span>not hear when you are<br/>
rested will be perfectly distracting when you<br/>
are tired. You will go over and shut a <span style="color: #0000FF;">window</span>; you will walk around aimlessly; you will<br/>
swear at the faint cackle of a distant graphophone. If there is a light above you at an<br/>
evening lecture, it will hurt your eyes almost<br/>
beyond endurance. Instead of making the<br/>
nervous system a less responsive instrument,<br/>
fatigue makes it more responsive. More<br/>
responsive, but less serviceable.<br/>
<br/>
And at the same time that you have increased<br/>
irritability, you have decreased power. You<br/>
can take things up, but you cannot do them<br/>
hard. You can't put vim and snap into <span style="color: #0000FF;">anything</span>. You can't memorize well. You can't<br/>
think consecutively; your mind will constantly<br/>
wander to something else.<br/>
<br/>
Irritability, weakness-thee two words belong together. A man who is constantly<br/>
fatigued can't work well or live well; and he<br/>
is very hard to live with.<br/>
<br/>
Every man who is anxious to hit his job<br/>
between the eyes should make a study of his<br/>
own fatigue curve; and he should put the<br/>
moral of it to heart. To know when it's<br/>
time to quit-and to quit when it's <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>one of the first lessons in the primer of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency</span>.<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>had engaged work through <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Ogden in Wanamaker's store in<br/>
Philadelphia. Meanwhile, one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">teachers<br/>
</span>who had been engaged <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>teach in the Indian<br/>
summer school found at the last moment that<br/>
she could not come, and I was asked to take her<br/>
place; also to live in "the Wigwam," the<br/>
dormitory for Indian boys, and have general<br/>
charge of the Indian boys. It also happened<br/>
<br/>
that Mr. Freeland, the Commandant, had to<br/>
go to the Dakotas to bring on a party of new<br/>
Indian pupils, so I began at once upon my new<br/>
duties. These were not entirely new so far as<br/>
the management of the boys was concerned,<br/>
but my relation to the Indian boys in "the<br/>
Wigwam" and my experience as a teacher of<br/>
Indian pupils, boys and girls, were both new<br/>
and interesting. At my request, Mr. Freeland<br/>
wrote Mr. Ogden, asking that I be released<br/>
