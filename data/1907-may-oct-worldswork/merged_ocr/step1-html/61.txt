<span>THE HONOR OF THE RAILROAD<br/>
<br/>
belief that they would sign a statement which<br/>
they did not believe to be literally true.<br/>
<br/>
Let us look into the methods they employed<br/>
in their research and the results at which they<br/>
arrived. They went back to January, 1900,<br/>
so that their investigation covered seven years<br/>
of work on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Every<br/>
one of the 40,000 stockholders was addressed<br/>
in a circular, asking for information with regard to any act of malfeasance by any employee of the road. The public also was asked<br/>
to turn in any complaint that it had to make.<br/>
Over 2,500 of the officers and employees in<br/>
positions of trust were examined personally,<br/>
and compelled to reply frankly to every question,<br/>
whether of duty to the company or of personal<br/>
investment or pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the original discontent arose from<br/>
the method of giving cars to shippers. The<br/>
committee hired the Audit Company of New<br/>
York to go into this. This independent concern put 35 accountants, 80 clerks, and 12<br/>
stenographers on the books, examined 16,000<br/>
sheets showing the daily car distribution and<br/>
7,500 special orders for cars, made 45,000,000<br/>
postings on these reports, and finally turned<br/>
in a report of 2,678 pages, giving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conclusions</span>.<br/>
<br/>
It is probably safe to say that never in the<br/>
history of business has a large corporation<br/>
been so mercilessly dissected. The Pennsylvania has over <span style="color: #0000FF;">200,000 </span>employees. In the<br/>
seven years under review, its men have<br/>
handled, from earnings and capital, close<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">500,000,000 </span>cash, and have had the spending of that amount of money, in payrolls,<br/>
purchases, and various other ways. The<br/>
men who have been in a position to divert parts<br/>
of this tremendous total to their own uses num<br/>
ber 2,505. These are the managers, superintendents, comptrollers, and others in<br/>
authority.<br/>
<br/>
Now let us look upon the results. Of the<br/>
40,000 stockholders, one wrote to the committee making a complaint. From the general<br/>
public, 19 signed letters of complaint and suggestion were received, and 6 men wrote anonymously. All the complaints were taken up<br/>
in detail.<br/>
<br/>
The net result of the investigation is that 15<br/>
men on the systems have been reported by the<br/>
committee to the presidents for punishment.<br/>
They were found to have taken from various<br/>
outside interests stocks of various kinds, presumably in the nature of bribes.<br/>
<br/>
MAN 8859<br/>
<br/>
Of the others, 251 are found in possession<br/>
of stocks of companies with which the Pennsylvania does business, but the stocks were<br/>
bought and paid for in money. In almost<br/>
every case, the holding of the stocks dates<br/>
back to the days when the officers of the road<br/>
were encouraged to create and assist in creating<br/>
companies, in order to create business for the<br/>
road at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Not one single instance of "graft "is reported<br/>
in the purchasing of supplies, in the immense<br/>
purchases of real estate in New York, in the<br/>
colossal transactions involved in the new<br/>
building carried on through these seven years.<br/>
In the awarding of contracts, the committee<br/>
found as follows:<br/>
<br/>
"That no officer or employee of the railroads has directly,<br/>
or indirectly, received any compensation, or gratuities, from<br/>
any contractor."<br/>
<br/>
When I read this report, I regarded it as an<br/>
artistic whitewash. Going through it step<br/>
by step, with my mind upon the names of the<br/>
men who signed it, it became the most splendid<br/>
vindication of human nature that has ever been<br/>
given to the public of the United States. I<br/>
know the railroad business. It is full of the<br/>
most beautiful opportunity to any man of<br/>
brains who wants to practise "graft." There<br/>
is no other occupation in the world of business<br/>
in which the sharper or the grafter could so<br/>
flourish as in this occupation of handling<br/>
thousands of dollars of "company money,"<br/>
and distributing to hundreds of great shippers<br/>
Yet,<br/>
here is a committee beyond reproach. It has<br/>
gone through the whole business for seven<br/>
years back, employed outside auditors of known<br/>
reputation, checked up every possible chance<br/>
for crookedness. At the end, it convicts<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>men of possible, not totally proven,<br/>
dishonesty.<br/>
<br/>
Before going further, it is as well to say that<br/>
this Pennsylvania report, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">contributary<br/>
</span>facts to follow, refer to the relationship of the<br/>
railroad men to the railroad. The point of it<br/>
is that the men on salary, the privates of the<br/>
line, as it were, are faithful to the railroad, and<br/>
that they do not abuse their power to collect<br/>
tribute at the expense of that railroad.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is familiar enough with the story<br/>
of corporation "graft." The trail of it lies<br/>
all over this country. When it comes down<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>final analysis, the money paid out to<br/>
legislators, the passes issued to the "powers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
