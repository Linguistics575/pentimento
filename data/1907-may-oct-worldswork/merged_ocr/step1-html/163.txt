of a dozen new commonwealths be<br/>
yond the Mississippi; the next fifty<br/>
years will see the re-making of a dozen old<br/>
commonwealths below Mason and Dixon's<br/>
line. The energies of these people, for generations tragically pent-up or misdirected, are<br/>
now turned at last into their natural channels<br/>
of development. From 1900 to 1950 the<br/>
South will be the Land of Opportunity. As<br/>
our epic of the nineteenth century was the<br/>
Winning of the West, so our epic of the twentieth<br/>
will be the Development of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">South</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In population, North Carolina was sixteenth<br/>
in rank among the states in 1890, fifteenth in<br/>
1900; twenty-third in rank as an agricultural<br/>
state in 1890, it was twentieth in 1900; <span style="color: #0000FF;">rank</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>thirty-first in manufacturing in 1890, in<br/>
1900 it stood twenty-eighth. For net gain<br/>
of rank in population, agriculture and manufactures it was equaled by no old state east or<br/>
west of the Mississippi, and only the newest<br/>
of the new states and territories of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WestOklahoma </span>and Montana, drawing a sudden<br/>
stream of men and means from all other sections<br/>
-kept the same pace. The state made its<br/>
gain in population without foreign immigration, and the gain in agriculture and manufactures was made practically without foreign<br/>
capital. It was the energy of an awakened<br/>
and enfranchised people, coming at length<br/>
into its rightful heritage. With 17 per cent.<br/>
gain in population, the state made <span style="color: #ff0000;">78. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">per<br/>
</span>cent. gain in agricultural output and 125 per<br/>
cent. gain in gross value of manufactured<br/>
products.<br/>
<br/>
In the last five years the people of the state<br/>
have put more money into industrial establishments than they had accumulated in them for<br/>
the two hundred years preceding. Every time<br/>
the moon changes, they now add as much to<br/>
their property values as they had averaged per<br/>
year prior to 1900. Every two years they now<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>last fifty years have seen the making<br/>
<br/>
put into their banks more money than all the<br/>
generations gone before had accumulated in<br/>
them up to the last census year. And they are<br/>
building a dozen <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolhouse </span>for every factory,<br/>
and in the last decade they set up more printing<br/>
presses than banks.<br/>
<br/>
There has been no noisy exploitation, no<br/>
sudden discovery of rich material resources,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>influx of aliens. In 1900 there were but<br/>
128 persons who could not speak English, and<br/>
no other state has made smaller drafts upon<br/>
the population of other American states.<br/>
<br/>
The state began<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>its rebuilding in 1890 by<br/>
turning to the development of its people. The<br/>
agitation for longer and better schools took<br/>
definite shape in a widespread demand for<br/>
increasing the general tax rate for educational<br/>
purposes. The legislature elected in 1890<br/>
provided for the establishment of the Normal<br/>
and Industrial College for Young Women at<br/>
Greensboro. The same year the new Agricultural and Mechanical College at Raleigh<br/>
was beginning work with its first class.<br/>
<br/>
These were but a few evidences of that broadening of democracy in which, I think, we have<br/>
the dominant note of upland Southern life<br/>
these last fifteen years. It has shown itself<br/>
not only in the determination to give a chance<br/>
to every boy and girl of every creed and color,<br/>
but it has also shown itself in political life.<br/>
Here no ruling aristocracy has prevented the<br/>
rise of the former non-slaveholding classes to<br/>
leadership. It was a "farmers' legislature"<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1891 </span>that began the educational revival<br/>
in North Carolina. So it was largely a revolt<br/>
against what the rural classes regarded as<br/>
machine rule that drove the Democratic Party<br/>
out of power in 1894; it came forward in 1898<br/>
with new leaders and amore modern spirit.<br/>
<br/>
The most significant industrial fact brought<br/>
out by the census of 1890 is that the Piedmont<br/>
or Upland South-all that region from the<br/>
mountain ranges to the long line of sand hills<br/>
