<br/>
</span>over and found positions-for the most part as<br/>
farm help-for some 7,000. In 1906, it did<br/>
as much for nearly 13,000. In the spring<br/>
months of the present year, it transplanted<br/>
more than 30,000. And the Transportation<br/>
Department states that, as a matter of course,<br/>
these figures will themselves seem small when<br/>
compared with what will be accomplished<br/>
in the five years to come.<br/>
<br/>
First, as to the receiving end of the Transportation Department. In the London headquarters is a staff of 100 <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>whose business<br/>
it is to see that assistance shall go only to those<br/>
who deserve it. There is no lack of material<br/>
to choose from. In 1906, when 13,000 were<br/>
taken, 112,000 asked to be "emigrated"; and<br/>
at the present time, applications are coming in<br/>
at the rate of 1,000-per day. But the applicant<br/>
must <span style="color: #0000FF;">fill </span>out certain blank forms, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">statements </span>of which become the basis of a searching<br/>
investigation. The best evidence of this lies<br/>
in the fact that of a total of 20,000 so far<br/>
brought to Canada, only nineteen have proved<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">undesirable</span>," and these were deported at<br/>
the instance of the "Army" itself. Applicants<br/>
are not expected to be or to become <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Salvationists." Catholics and Protestants are equally<br/>
welcome. The character of the individual<br/>
is the great consideration. After that, the<br/>
preference is given to the man with some farming experience. Married men are advised to<br/>
experiment upon themselves, and send later<br/>
for the wife and little ones.<br/>
<br/>
In the London headquarters there is also a<br/>
complete bureau of information<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Questions<br/>
are answered by word of mouth, by letter, and<br/>
through the columns of two new "Army"<br/>
periodicals-The Emigration <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gazette </span>and The<br/>
N ew <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sewer</span>. The whole organization throughout Canada supplies the information upon<br/>
which these answers are based. It is impressed<br/>
upon every would-be emigrant that there are<br/>
no poorhouses in Canada, and that he must<br/>
elect either to work or starve. The "Army"<br/>
will not allow itself to be made the means for<br/>
supplying "scab" labor in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>of strikes<br/>
and lockouts.<br/>
<br/>
Where the emigrant has money, he is "personally conducted." In the language of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Transportation </span>Department, he is "selected,<br/>
directed, protected"--) when settled in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9153<br/>
<br/>
</span>ably. After advancing the cost of the passage<br/>
money and transportation to whatever <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canadian </span>centre to which a man may be "booked,"<br/>
the "Army" lends him from $ 5 to $ 15. The<br/>
unmarried man is expected to return the<br/>
amount within one year; the married man is<br/>
allowed three years. Of the money so advanced and which has come due to date, no<br/>
less than 95 per cent. has been refunded.<br/>
<br/>
In the actual matter of transportation,<br/>
steamers are taken in their entirety wherever<br/>
possible. Three large liners were chartered<br/>
for the present year. In addition to this,<br/>
every individual unbooked passage on the<br/>
Canadian boats up to the end of June was<br/>
engaged. When the whole boat is taken, a<br/>
bureau of advice is opened on board. The<br/>
advice is apt to be homely <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">point</span>.<br/>
<br/>
And here the "Army's" machinery has<br/>
shown itself astonishingly efficient. Using<br/>
the various Canadian headquarters as bases,<br/>
central farm help and information bureaus<br/>
have been established in St. John, Halifax,<br/>
Quebec, Montreal, Kingston, Toronto, London,<br/>
Winnipeg, Brandon, and Vancouver. Each<br/>
bureau makes it its business to keep a complete<br/>
list of all situations vacant in its territory.<br/>
In 1906, 60 per cent. of these emigrants were<br/>
taken before they could pass through Ontario.<br/>
There were situations offered for <span style="color: #ff0000;">1S</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo-or<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>2,000 more than were available.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of young women emigrants,<br/>
a servants' hotel has been opened in Toronto.<br/>
From it as a distributing centre, much is being<br/>
done <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-solve </span>the great domestic problem in<br/>
Canada. And the province of Ontario, in<br/>
recognition of the fact that the "Army's"<br/>
emigrants "have cost the Government less,<br/>
man for man and woman for woman, and<br/>
proved more satisfactory than the emigrants<br/>
from any other source," has purchased a small<br/>
Toronto hotel where the family of an emigrant<br/>
brought over by the "Army" may stay while<br/>
the husband is establishing himself. In connection with this, the various central bureaus<br/>
have been carrying on a campaign of education<br/>
to show the Canadian farmer that his wife<br/>
needs help no less than he does himself, and<br/>
that it will pay him in the end to take the<br/>
married emigrant, family and all. It means<br/>
that the farmer must build a tenant house,<br/>
but it has been shown to give a vastly more<br/>
permanent form of labor. Four years ago,<br/>
only 2 per cent. of the applications were for<br/>
<br/>
