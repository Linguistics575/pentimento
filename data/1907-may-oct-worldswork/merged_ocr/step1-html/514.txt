In several stores lunch rooms are supported<br/>
by the management, where healthful and<br/>
nourishing food is provided at prices which<br/>
do not nearly cover its cost.<br/>
<br/>
"We figure on a loss of about $ 5,000 a year<br/>
in the lunch room," said one manager, "but<br/>
we consider the money well invested, as we<br/>
have found that the girls' health-and consequently their <span style="color: #0000FF;">services </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>better because<br/>
of the better food."<br/>
<br/>
In several of the large stores, hospitals with<br/>
doctors and nurses in attendance are provided for the women. If a girl feels ill she is<br/>
at once sent up to the hospital, where a trained<br/>
nurse receives her and calls the house doctor<br/>
if necessary. All medical attention is paid for<br/>
by the store, the girls paying only for their<br/>
medicine.<br/>
<br/>
In one store, where three thousand girls<br/>
and women are employed, a pleasant recreation<br/>
room is provided, with plenty of comfortable<br/>
easy-chairs, a piano, books and magazines on<br/>
the tables, and a waxed floor, where they may<br/>
dance or rest and chat for a few minutes<br/>
when they have finished their luncheon.<br/>
<br/>
A number of the wealthier stores maintain<br/>
summer homes in the country for their girls,<br/>
where they are sent for their two weeks' vacation.<br/>
The girls are not treated here as charity girls<br/>
but as the guests of their employers, some of<br/>
whom have their own wives and daughters<br/>
there to receive them and help to entertain<br/>
and make them comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
In most of the larger shops benefit associations are maintained, and in a number of<br/>
the better class stores the money collected under<br/>
the fine system, which is much the same in all<br/>
the department stores of New York, is turned<br/>
over to the Employees' Benefit Fund.<br/>
<br/>
OBEDIENCE TO LABOR LAWS GENERAL<br/>
<br/>
The laws governing the employment of<br/>
women and children are both rigid and comprehensive, and these, I found on close investigation, are fairly well observed. Most of the<br/>
girls employed are over sixteen, with a few cashgirls and messengers between fourteen and<br/>
fifteen. In the higher class shops the cashgirl system has been largely supplanted by an<br/>
electric system which is both safer and quicker.<br/>
In the smaller shops the cash-girls are still to<br/>
be found, many of them looking so pitifully<br/>
young and small that one at first disbelieves<br/>
the statement that they are all over fourteen<br/>
years of age. A careful and rigid investigation,<br/>
<br/>
WHAT IS A SHOP-GIRL'S LIFE?<br/>
<br/>
conducted both within and outside the establishment, however, convinced the writer that<br/>
young and childish as many of these overworked little wage-earners appear, it is rare<br/>
that children under the age limit are to be<br/>
found. To the manager or proprietor who is<br/>
thinking more of results than of wages, the mere<br/>
child, barely fourteen or under, is no longer<br/>
desirable.<br/>
<br/>
"It is not only that we are compelled by the<br/>
child-labor laws to be extremely particular<br/>
about the age of our young employees," said<br/>
the manager of one large department store,<br/>
"but our own interests demand it. We find that<br/>
it does not pay us to have a lot of irresponsible<br/>
youngsters under foot who are always where<br/>
they are not wanted, and never to be found<br/>
where they are. To do the work we require<br/>
of our cash-girls they must read and write well,<br/>
and be fairly quick and accurate at figures.<br/>
These qualifications we have not found in the<br/>
younger applicants, and we seldom employ<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>girl under sixteen. Although there are now<br/>
more than eighteen hundred girls and women<br/>
on our <span style="color: #0000FF;">pay-roll</span>, there are only thirty-five of them<br/>
under the age of sixteen years."<br/>
<br/>
In even the cheapest stores the laws requiring<br/>
that suitable, cleanly, and sanitary retiring<br/>
rooms be provided are fairly well observed;<br/>
and the law requiring that seats be provided<br/>
for girls and women has been almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">universally<br/>
</span>complied with, usually in the form of a stool<br/>
swung upon springs, which folds under the<br/>
counter when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
The laws regulating the hours of work for<br/>
women and children are also very generally<br/>
observed. No employee under sixteen years<br/>
of age may be permitted to work more than<br/>
fifty-four hours in any one week, or more than<br/>
nine hours in any one day; and no female<br/>
employee over the age of sixteen may be permitted to work more than sixty hours in any<br/>
one week or more than ten hours in any one<br/>
day, except to make shorter some other day<br/>
of the week.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the stores close at 5:30; and fortyfive to sixty minutes are allowed for lunch. A<br/>
special provision has been made by the law<br/>
for extra hours of work during the Christmas<br/>
holidays, and for these most of the stores give<br/>
adequate extra payment.<br/>
<br/>
THE SHOP-GIRL'S WAGES<br/>
<br/>
And now we come to a more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>question: the wages paid to the shop-girl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It has<br/>
