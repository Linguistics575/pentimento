<span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">territory<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>who are apt to regard Austria <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Christian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">andprogressive </span>Power instead of the ogre of<br/>
the Balkans. To the injustices <span style="color: #0000FF;">inflicted </span>upon<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">peasantryhto </span>their many grievances and<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">viorititrfights</span>, I have not space here to<br/>
refer. Austria seeks to Germanize the whole<br/>
land by steel and by hunger. The injustice<br/>
and cruelty of the police is <span style="color: #0000FF;">unspeakable-parallelled </span>only in Russia. Austria <span style="color: #0000FF;">systematically </span>covers its sins against Bosnia by bribing<br/>
press correspondents, by suppressing the publication of unfavorable books, and by paying<br/>
systematic blackmail to every newspaper in<br/>
Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br/>
<br/>
And this is the Austria that <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>plans to<br/>
dominate the Balkans! Go to the Balkans<br/>
and you will see what <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>have seen. You will<br/>
realize the clever, subtle influence of Austrian<br/>
agents in Montenegro where they persuade<br/>
the pride of the country <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>emigrate, <span style="color: #ff0000;">themselves<br/>

THE DANGER SPOT OF EUROPE<br/>
<br/>
paying the expenses, and thus sap the nation<br/>
of its future population; in Northern Albania,<br/>
where the priests in Austrian pay never cease<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">descant </span>upon the benefits of Austrian rule;<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Servia</span>, where they are always stirring strife;<br/>
in Bulgaria, where their spies <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>ever active;<br/>
and in Macedonia, where they secretly encourage the Greek bands to massacre the Bulgars.<br/>
Thus over the whole of the Balkans Austria<br/>
has spread forth its wings, and its dark threatening shadow is now over everything. The<br/>
Austrian policy is to compete with Germany<br/>
and become the paramount Power in the<br/>
Peninsula, and obtain Montenegro, Albania,<br/>
and Macedonia for itself, together with the<br/>
much-coveted port of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Salonica</span>. From this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">latter </span>point, it already has a railroad through<br/>
Uskiib, joining the main <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vienna-Constants'nople </span>line at Nisch, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Servia</span>. Therefore<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>part of the policy is to lay hold of the kingdom<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of Servia. Fortunately, Servia knows how to<br/>
take care of itself.<br/>
<br/>
Servia to-day bars Austria's way southward<br/>
to Salonica. It is, therefore, not to Austria's<br/>
interest that Servia should be at peace. So<br/>
long as things went badly in Servia, Austria<br/>
allowed matters to go on without interference<br/>
and watched eagerly for the downfall of the<br/>
kingdom. Unfortunate events occurred, as is<br/>
well known, but, to the great dismay of Servia's<br/>
arch-enemy, the country has become contented and is greatly prospering under the rule<br/>
of King Peter. For <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reason</span>, Austria has<br/>
once again sought to stir discord and to create<br/>
troubles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties</span>. At the moment of<br/>
writing, the secret police have a list of more<br/>
than one hundred Austrian political agents<br/>
living in Belgrade alone!<br/>
<br/>
From King Peter himself, and from M.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Patchitch</span>, his Secretary of State, I learned <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
