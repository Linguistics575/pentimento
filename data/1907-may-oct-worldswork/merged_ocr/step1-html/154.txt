In the first three decades succeeding the<br/>
Civil War, little progress was made. In the<br/>
fourth decade the tide turned, and things are<br/>
now going better than at any time preceding,<br/>
before or since the war. This may be shown<br/>
by the following general facts about the production and price of cotton per annum in the<br/>
four decades succeeding the war:<br/>
<br/>

Formerly the cotton crop was, in the cotton<br/>
area, practically the only source of money<br/>
income. This one source brought $ 300,000,000.<br/>
Now the income has increased until the following figures show, roughly, something of the<br/>
improvement:<br/>

<br/>
Besides this increase in the value of cotton<br/>
and what is made out of it over and above<br/>
what used to be, there are other gigantic values<br/>
being realized in the South; and other kinds of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">maufacturing </span>from mines. Coal, mineral oil,<br/>
furniture, iron, and steel, and many other<br/>
interests have come from absolutely nothing<br/>
to be giant interests; and, if the annual values<br/>
in these be added, the figures become <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellnigh </span>incredible.<br/>
<br/>
The South has practically a monopoly of<br/>
cotton. It is not indigenous to the United<br/>
States, and it seems quite extraordinary that<br/>
it has been developed outside its indigenous<br/>
territory to give the greatest and cheapest<br/>
supply of raw material for clothing for the<br/>
people of the world. While cotton is indigenous<br/>
to most tropical and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sub-tropical </span>countries,<br/>
<br/>
THE SOUTH'S VAST RESERVES<br/>
<br/>
none of those countries produces an approximately reliable supply. It has been said<br/>
that the reason for this is, that where cotton is<br/>
indigenous the cotton-destroying insects survive the winter and destroy the crop. In the<br/>
cotton area of the United States, the winters are<br/>
cold enough to kill the bugs which destroy<br/>
cotton and yet the summer is long enough,<br/>
taken together with a mild spring and fall, to<br/>
permit the growth of a crop. No similar<br/>
climatic conditions seem to have been found<br/>
in any other part of the world. Therefore,<br/>
until some other area with similar climatic<br/>
conditions is found, the South will remain<br/>
secure in the practical monopoly of cotton<br/>
production.<br/>
<br/>
LOW-GRADE ALIENS NOT NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
While more people are needed both for the<br/>
production of cotton and in general manufactures, it is not desired that the gates shall be<br/>
opened wide to immigration of alien stocks. It<br/>
is better rather to maintain a degree of scarcity<br/>
of labor to stimulate fair prices-high enough<br/>
to maintain better standards of living for working people. This condition of a degree of<br/>
scarcity of labor would also stimulate the adaptation of natural forces, such as water power, to<br/>
do much work. Immigration is needed in a<br/>
moderate tide, and of the best blood only, in<br/>
order to bring a new strain into the home blood<br/>
and to help tide over the pressure for labor now,<br/>
pending the development of natural forces<br/>
and their adaption to the work to be done.<br/>
<br/>
The South has had ample experience with<br/>
cheap, ignorant labor. Slave labor was both<br/>
cheap and ignorant. While it was depended<br/>
upon, the natural forces and resources, excepting only the fertility of the soil, remained<br/>
untouched. To get full values from these,<br/>
each succeeding generation must be better<br/>
trained and more highly educated.<br/>
<br/>
The movement for education and training<br/>
that is higher and better is already well <span style="color: #0000FF;">inaugurated</span>. Practically every Southern state<br/>
has established and maintains an agricultural<br/>
and mechanical college.<br/>
<br/>
This is wholly apart from the state universities. These technical and practical schools<br/>
are well attended by the boys. So also are the<br/>
new state normal and industrial schools well<br/>
attended by the girls. The public school system of every Southern state is being broadened<br/>
and extended. These educational movements<br/>
include provision for colored people.<br/>
