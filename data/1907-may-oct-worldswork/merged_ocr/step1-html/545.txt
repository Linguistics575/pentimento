<span>THE PERIL OF JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
and Rousseau became the staple diet of Japanese adolescence. There were no half-way<br/>
measures.<br/>
<br/>
It was the same in finance, industry, trade,<br/>
and war. Western methods were not grafted<br/>
upon the old methods, but the old methods were<br/>
summarily thrown out of doors, and the new<br/>
were suddenly installed. The meteoric rise<br/>
of the army and the navy to Western "<span style="color: #ff0000;">tandards<br/>
</span>is a matter of marvel, but of common knowledge. The highly organized educational system, centring about great universities, is<br/>
coming to be understood in America. Four<br/>
years after the end of Feudalism, the Government quietly appropriated the National Banking Law of the United States, and made it the<br/>
National Banks Regulations of Japan. Within<br/>
eight years there were 153 national banks in<br/>
the Kingdom. By 1884, there had grown up<br/>
over 900 other banks, not under this law-very<br/>
like our trust companies and savings banks.<br/>
Japan therefore took another leaf from the<br/>
Book of the West, and made national laws to<br/>
regulate these banks properly-which is one<br/>
step farther than we have <span style="color: #0000FF;">gone<br/>
<br/>
</span>The reckless, impetuous progress of the<br/>
nation has been seen in every department of<br/>
the national life. It was only in 1872 that the<br/>
first mercantile fleet under the Japanese flag<br/>
came into being. Growth was rapid and<br/>
sound, but it was not fast enough to satisfy<br/>
the Government. Therefore, in 1896, the Navigation Encouragement Law was passed, granting great subsidies to all ships over 1,000 tons.<br/>
To-day, the merchant fleet includes 1,500<br/>
steamers with a gross tonnage of over 1,000,000<br/>
tons, and the Japanese <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag </span>is flown on all the<br/>
great trade routes to Europe, America, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aur</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>tralia, and Bombay. The growth has been<br/>
helped by large bounties paid to Japanese<br/>
builders, with the result that within the past<br/>
ten years have come into existence in Japan<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">art</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>private shipyards and 42 private docks.<br/>
<br/>
The telegraph service of the Empire began<br/>
in 1869, but it did not amount to very much<br/>
until 1879, when the country joined the International Telegraph Union. To-day, the wires<br/>
measure over 95,000 miles, radiating from<br/>
2,600 offices. The telephone system of the<br/>
country is over 45,000 miles, based on 483<br/>
offices, of which 143 are automatic.<br/>
<br/>
These things are nothing marvelous in<br/>
themselves. The marvel of them lies in the<br/>
swiftness with which they have come about.<br/>
There has been in Japan no slow broadening<br/>

<br/>
down from precedent to precedent. Instead<br/>
they have, in the spirit of their edict, "searched<br/>
all lands for knowledge," and taken to themselves swiftly the best of everything they found.<br/>
<br/>
JAPANESE CONDITIONS IN 1907<br/>
<br/>
It is time to turn to the reverse of the picture.<br/>
In the Financial Annual for 1907, the Minister<br/>
of Finance undertakes to outline the economic<br/>
condition of the country. The spirit of the<br/>
comment may be gained from the following<br/>
phrases, gathered from the text:<br/>
<br/>
"The year... closed <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>a state of unparalleled prosperity.. Enterprises also arose with unprecedented<br/>
briskness and the stock market was more active than it<br/>
had ever been hitherto. Consequently the prices of<br/>
securities rose higher and higher. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Further</span>, there<br/>
was a great increase in bank deposits and postal savings<br/>
<br/>
and our <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreign </span>trade reached a remarkable degree<br/>
of prosperity. If we take the average of wages<br/>
at 100 in 1903, it remained from January, 1906, at 106 to<br/>
107: however, toward the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1906 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>showed an upward<br/>
tendency. Meantime, the average cost of <span style="color: #0000FF;">commodities</span>, based on 100 in 1903, rose in November, 1906,<br/>
to I 19.1 <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>"<br/>
<br/>
But the very report in which this statement is<br/>
given contains evidences that the price of<br/>
securities for a brief period may not be a fair<br/>
index of the economic condition of the people.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, here is a pregnant paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
"As the extraordinary special taxes were first imposed for<br/>
the purpose of obtaining revenue required to<br/>
meet the war expenses, they were to have been abolished at.<br/>
the end of the year following that in which peace was<br/>
restored; but the increase which took place as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>result of<br/>
the war in pensions, annuities and debt charges<br/>
rendered unavoidable the continuance of these taxes<br/>
<br/>
and accordingly the law relating to the taxes was<br/>
revised, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>became permanent."<br/>
<br/>
The italics are not from the report. It is<br/>
timely to analyse those taxes, and the debt<br/>
which is responsible for them. The taxes,<br/>
of course, are based on the expenditure. In<br/>
the year that will end on March 31, 1908, the<br/>
government expenditure of Japan will reach a<br/>
total of $ 313,220,000, or about $ 6.40 per<br/>
inhabitant. Of this total, $ 83,000,000 goes<br/>
for interest on the debt, and more than<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">97,000,000 </span>for the army and the navy, not<br/>
including pensions.<br/>
<br/>
It is well to digress here to point out a<br/>
very remarkable fact: In the year ending<br/>
March 31, 1908, the Japanese Government<br/>
will spend more money on its army and its<br/>
navy than it ever spent in a single year before.<br/>
