<br/>
</span>great national policy. Yet, through the decades, in the face of terrible defeats at the hands<br/>
of Napoleon and of the combined <span style="color: #0000FF;">AngloFrench </span>forces in 1854, the ambition still lives<br/>
and underlies the very throne of Russia. Of<br/>
what avail a peace movement to check an<br/>
ambition such as that?<br/>
<br/>
So well is this limitation recognized, even by<br/>
the peace advocates themselves, that many<br/>
of the leaders of the movement to-day except<br/>
from the list of quarrels which they believe to<br/>
be properly subject matter for arbitration<br/>
such international controversies as involve<br/>
a question <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>national honor. Here, of course,<br/>
arises a great controversy, for who dare undertake to say where national honor ends and<br/>
national conceit or national avarice begins?<br/>
When, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fulness </span>of time, Russia's march<br/>
upon the Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gud </span>and the Indian Ocean<br/>
meets the outposts of Britain's power, how very<br/>
feeble will sound the voice that cries "Peace!"<br/>
<br/>
WARS OF PERSONAL AMBITION<br/>
<br/>
In the case of wars that arise from the personal ambition of one man, the task of the<br/>
Peacemaker is, perhaps, a trifle easier. It<br/>
may be that Napoleon <span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>in large part<br/>
responsible for the Crimean War. It served<br/>
him two good purposes, the inflation of the<br/>
minds of the enthusiastic French with a new<br/>
idea of Imperial grandeur, and the gaining<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">good-wili </span>of the Pope. But, outside of<br/>
it, he and his famous "blood-and-iron" contemporary, Bismarck, can be said to have<br/>
been directly responsible for four wars, instigated by dynastic and territorial ambition,<br/>
which cost nearly half a million lives and over<br/>
two billion dollars.<br/>
<br/>
An overwhelming world-opinion against war<br/>
might well have given to France and Germany<br/>
a few more years of patience and of thought<br/>
before they plunged into the Franco-Prussian<br/>
War. Even though the individual ambitions<br/>
of the men remained unchanged, the terrible<br/>
responsibility involved in entering upon a<br/>
course and a policy opposed to an evidently<br/>
universal sentiment might well tend to soften,<br/>
if not altogether to eliminate, a personal<br/>
ambition that called for war piled upon war.<br/>
<br/>
The peace-propagandists are not without<br/>
resources for argument, both in respect to the<br/>
wars entered into for the sake of national<br/>
pride and the wars entailed by personal ambitions. Once England went to war to avenge<br/>
an ear lost by a sea-captain called Jenkins,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WAR </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9147<br/>
</span>somewhere abroad on the Spanish main. The<br/>
national pride was aroused, and in spite of the<br/>
eloquent protest of Walpole, war was declared.<br/>
<br/>
WARS OF COMMERCE<br/>
<br/>
To-day, the considerations of commerce<br/>
outweigh all others before the councils of<br/>
Britain, Germany, France, and the United<br/>
States, at least. There have been few real<br/>
commercial wars since the beginning of the last<br/>
century; but the questions that to-day look<br/>
most likely to result in war are commercial<br/>
questions, rather than questions of national or<br/>
personal ambition, territorial aggrandizement,<br/>
or even class freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most immediately impressive<br/>
of these great questions is the question of the<br/>
"open door" in the Orient. The spheres of<br/>
influence are apparently well-defined, yet<br/>
Britain deemed it necessary to teal a march<br/>
on its neighbors by a treaty with Japan, and<br/>
the delimitation of the powers in the Orient<br/>
has not produced perfect harmony by any<br/>
means. Russia and Japan fought not so much<br/>
over the territory of Manchuria as over the<br/>
commerce of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">littoral </span>of Asia and the rich<br/>
valleys that lie behind it. The time may<br/>
come, though it is not in sight, when the very<br/>
life of the United States Pacific Coast will<br/>
demand a war between this country and Japan.<br/>
In such a case, what would the advocate of<br/>
peace have to offer as a quid pro quo for the<br/>
rights the prospective combatants must give<br/>
up for the sake of a settlement?<br/>
<br/>
It has been pointed out of late that the rapid<br/>
increase of the commercial importance of the<br/>
Rhine <span style="color: #0000FF;">va </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ley </span>in the German Empire has made<br/>
it an irksome fact that the mouth of that river<br/>
lies in Holland, and that the very growth<br/>
fostered by Germany is enriching Rotterdam<br/>
and Antwerp, two foreign cities. Will time<br/>
remove the disadvantage of this situation, or<br/>
will time sweep away the national boundary?<br/>
One thing or the other, it would seem, must<br/>
come to pass. If the latter, the method of the<br/>
change is surely a fit subject for the advocates<br/>
of world-peace to consider carefully. If the<br/>
matter were brought down to a commercial<br/>
basis entirely and national pride eliminated,<br/>
those two cities and that stretch of Holland<br/>
might be bought and paid for in cash much<br/>
cheaper than they could be bought by war-but what if they refused to be bought?<br/>
<br/>
It is true that the growth of commerce and<br/>
the struggle for commerce between the great<br/>
<br/>
