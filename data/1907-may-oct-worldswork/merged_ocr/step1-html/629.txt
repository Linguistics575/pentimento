<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">HUMANITARIAN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RULE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PARIS<br/>
<br/>
</span>through holes in her shoes; her old black straw<br/>
hat was a ruin. Yet her hair was combed<br/>
decently; her face, thin and pathetically lined<br/>
by suffering and fear, was not blowzy nor<br/>
defiant like other faces in the prisoners' dock;<br/>
she still bore herself with matronly self-respect.<br/>
Misery of her forty years spoke in all her looks,<br/>
but not crime nor gin. Watching there, I<br/>
wondered what desperate assault upon society<br/>
had brought her to that cruel pass.<br/>
<br/>
Swift <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>the wheels in a London police<br/>
court. A policeman said a few words and an<br/>
officious looking man with no pity in his face<br/>
and no kindness in his voice explained the case.<br/>
He was the School Board Officer. He said<br/>
that the prisoner at the bar was a widow with<br/>
nine children; that she lived in a basement<br/>
tenement of one room; that her two elder children had been absent from school. How<br/>
often? Of a possible total of 68 attendances,<br/>
each had made but 54. The woman had been<br/>
warned repeatedly; she had persisted in violating the law; and it had become necessary to<br/>
arrest her.<br/>
<br/>
The justice, dignified but not unkind, asked<br/>
the woman if the officer's statement was<br/>
correct. She said, in her frightened way, that<br/>
it was. Only, she added, she was desperately<br/>
poor and the children had been absent from<br/>
school while they tried to get something to eat.<br/>
The justice said that he had no option in the<br/>
matter, and fined her nine shillings.<br/>
<br/>
She groaned aloud and said she could not<br/>
pay; she had not a shilling in the world. The<br/>
School Board Officer broke in again and<br/>
informed His Worship that it would be quite<br/>
useless to issue an execution against the<br/>
woman's property. He had visited the one<br/>
room in which the family lived and all its contents together were not worth nine shillings.<br/>
The justice reflected a moment and said that<br/>
he would give her a week in which to find nine<br/>
shillings; in default thereof, it would be his<br/>
duty to send her to jail. So the woman went<br/>
away crying and the wheels ground up the<br/>
next human fragment.<br/>
<br/>
What were the nine children to do, meantime, if she should be sent to jail? I do not<br/>
know. Nobody knows. Perhaps it is not<br/>
important. The main thing seemed to be to<br/>
vindicate the law and to punish the offender.<br/>
<br/>
THE GENTLER METHOD OF PARIS<br/>
<br/>
On that same day, in some dirty back street<br/>
in Paris, in a region akin to Stepney, some other<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9427<br/>
<br/>
</span>widow toiling for bread in an attic saw <span style="color: #0000FF;">Authority </span>come and clothe her children and feed them<br/>
and lead them happily to school, and knew<br/>
that whatever else might happen they would<br/>
be neither hungry nor cold nor untaught.<br/>
<br/>
Here, then, are two ways of dealing with the<br/>
problem of educating the children of the poor;<br/>
the Club and the Open Hand.<br/>
<br/>
While London clings yet to the Club, the<br/>
Municipal Council of Paris has elected to try<br/>
the Open Hand. One day it quietly decided<br/>
that it would not try with force and fear to<br/>
drive children to school nor to punish parents<br/>
whose poverty compelled them to keep their<br/>
children at home. Instead, it would try first<br/>
to remove. the causes of absence from school.<br/>
<br/>
The 2,714,000 people of Paris are governed<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>when the national legislature can be induced to<br/>
keep its hands off, by this Municipal Council<br/>
of eighty members, four being elected from<br/>
each of the twenty wards of the city. There<br/>
is no mayor of all Paris, but each ward has its<br/>
own mayor, an arrangement that seems to<br/>
work with much smoothness.<br/>
<br/>
This regulation about school children fell<br/>
within the Municipal Council's campaign.<br/>
One day the fact was revealed in the Council<br/>
that some children of the poor were kept out<br/>
of school because they did not have proper<br/>
clothing to wear, and some others because they<br/>
had no certainty of the day's food unless they<br/>
went out and earned it. At once the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Council </span>sent about the city searching for all such cases,<br/>
even in streets and corners most <span style="color: #0000FF;">obscure</span>, that<br/>
all might be verified and tabulated. Then<br/>
at public expense, from the city's funds, it<br/>
supplied all such children with shoes and<br/>
clothing and food. Daily it continues so to<br/>
supply them, believing that thereby it is following the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shrewdest </span>of all business policies; in<br/>
the Council's view, it is infinitely cheaper to<br/>
prevent crime than to punish it, and cheaper<br/>
to abolish misery than to "neglect it. It not<br/>
only furnishes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">children</span>, when it has led<br/>
them into school, all things free that they need<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">there-books </span>and slates and stationery and<br/>
instruments-but furnishes free to all children<br/>
that need it a daily luncheon, a real luncheon<br/>
of soup, meat, and vegetables, cooked in the<br/>
kitchens of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolhouse</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and served hot.<br/>
Children of the well-to-do pay for their luncheons; children of the poor pay nothing. An<br/>
ingeniously devised system of checks prevents<br/>
the curious from discovering who pays and who<br/>
does not, and spares the feelings of the poor.<br/>
