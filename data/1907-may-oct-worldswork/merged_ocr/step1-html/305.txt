<br/>
</span>And Japan-the wonderful story of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Japan-who </span>does not <span style="color: #0000FF;">knowit</span>? Its statesmen have sat<br/>
at the feet of Bismarck, Gladstone, Hay, von<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Caprivi</span>, and have turned their lessons into the<br/>
gold of peaceful conquest. Its <span style="color: #0000FF;">admirals </span>have<br/>
studied the craft of the waters from the best<br/>
of Britain's splendid commanders, and have<br/>
turned their lessons into laurels such as no<br/>
other sea-warriors wear. Its generals have<br/>
studied in the best schools of Germany, Britain,<br/>
America, and have exchanged their <span style="color: #ff0000;">ccrtificatcs<br/>
</span>for the proud decorations of their Emperor,<br/>
given as the reward of victory on victory.<br/>
<br/>
This is <span style="color: #ff0000;">much-hut </span>there are greater things.<br/>
Not alone have its armies and its navies conquered their foes, but in the lists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">commerce<br/>
</span>Japan has won even greater <span style="color: #ff0000;">victories</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day<br/>
</span>its <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleets </span>trade all about the coast of Asia, up<br/>
through the Mediterranean, to Spain, to England. To-day the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun-flag </span>rules the blue<br/>
Pacific. Its admirals of peace have named a<br/>
price at which they will buy out the American<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fleets </span>on that ocean, the great liners of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacific </span>Mail, the Hill lines, and others. Its<br/>
commerce over-seas is increasing by leaps and<br/>
bounds, if one allow for the abnormal flood of<br/>
war supplies sent out in the years of battle.<br/>
Its banks are scattered around the world, in<br/>
San Francisco, London, Wall Street. It has<br/>
its own great stock exchange, its own railways,<br/>

has it not? Mr. Jacob H. Schiff, returning<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">japan</span>, tells us that the universities of<br/>
Tokio, Waseda, and Kyoto compare favorably<br/>
with the best of our colleges and universities,<br/>
both as to apparatus and as to quality of the<br/>
faculties.<br/>

The progress of Japan has been as a pillar of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>in the darkness of the Orient, guiding the<br/>
nations onward into freedom. China has<br/>
followed the light, and Formosa, Siam, even<br/>
