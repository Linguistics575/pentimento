<br/>
defeat at the hands of Japan, twelve years ago,<br/>
was the beginning of a new era for the Chinese<br/>
Empire. Prior to that time, China had been<br/>
blind, moribund, insensate. The nation was<br/>
drunk with <span style="color: #0000FF;">overweening </span>pride, drugged stupid<br/>
with its opium, staggering toward oblivion,<br/>
like a century-old giant stumbling in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
The terrible defeat by Japan called into<br/>
being a new life in the Empire. Wisdom came<br/>
to see new lights. The Viceroy Chang became<br/>
the apostle of education. He laid his petitions<br/>
at the feet of the Emperor, begged him, threatened him, coaxed him, as one would coax a<br/>
child. In the end, a thousand schools sprang<br/>
into being suddenly throughout the Empire. Today, over 10,000 Chinese students are imbibing<br/>
modern methods at the great universities<br/>
of Japan, England, Germany, and America.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">To-day</span>, a thousand temples of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ancient </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gods<br/>
</span>in China are serving as schools to teach the<br/>
sons of the Dragon the wisdom of their<br/>
conquerors.<br/>
<br/>
Results must, of necessity, be slow; for the<br/>
number of the people is legion, and the generations of benighted darkness that have gone are<br/>
as stones to weigh them down-but the firstfruits have been gathered. The eyes of China<br/>
are turning from the blood-stained fields of<br/>
war to the markets of the strife of commerce.<br/>
When China resolved to strike the United<br/>
States, a little time ago, it created a boycott of<br/>
American goods. That is the war of the<br/>
twentieth century-not the war of China's<br/>
tradition.<br/>
<br/>
Thirty years ago this year, the Chinese<br/>
Government bought a foreign railroad within<br/>
its borders. It was called the Wu-Sung Railway. China wanted that railroad. As soon<br/>
as it had it, it proceeded and did with it as it<br/>
desired. It tore the rails from the roadbed and<br/>
threw them into the deep river. It threw the<br/>
rolling-stock after them. That was the way of<br/>
China with a railroad thirty years ago.<br/>
<br/>
To-day, the Chinese Empire is about to<br/>
build a great trunk-line railroad that shall<br/>
connect Peking with Canton and the outside<br/>
world. Already more than 7,000 miles of<br/>
railroad are in operation within the boundaries<br/>
of the Empire. The great ports welcome,<br/>
week by week, huge steamers flying the English,<br/>
French, German, American, and Canadian<br/>
flags, fill them from keel to deck-beams with<br/>
the products of Chinese industry, and send<br/>
them far upon their several ways. Splendid<br/>
Chinese commission houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Shanghai,<br/>
<br/>
THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
Canton, Hong Kong order their goods in<br/>
thousands of tons from the forges of Sheffield<br/>
and Birmingham, the looms of Manchester,<br/>
the mills of Pittsburg, and scatter them <span style="color: #0000FF;">thousands </span>of miles broadcast over the interior of<br/>
China. The hundreds of millions of the subjects of Tsi An are taking a place as a commercial factor in the markets of the world.<br/>
What will they do as decade follows decade,<br/>
with education ever growing, wealth ever<br/>
increasing, efficiency ever advancing? Mr.<br/>
James J. Hill says that they will come, at last,<br/>
to eat American wheat and to wear American<br/>
clothes. Perhaps-who knows? If they want<br/>
wheat, there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncounted </span>millions of acres of<br/>
land in China fit for the growing of wheat.<br/>
Perhaps we of the Occident may sometime<br/>
reverse the current of things and draw upon<br/>
China for wheat for our own feeding. Stranger<br/>
things than this have come to pass.<br/>
<br/>
Much may be read in current literature <span style="color: #0000FF;">concerning </span>China and its awakening. The bulk<br/>
of the writing is based upon the advance in the<br/>
Chinese army. <span style="color: #ff0000;">That </span>is merely typical. When<br/>
the heart of Chang turned toward education,<br/>
ten years or more ago, it was still mindful of<br/>
the practical things, and an army is a very<br/>
practical thing in China. Therefore, he also<br/>
advocated calling upon the Japanese for<br/>
soldiers to train the army of China. They<br/>
came, those little brown Napoleons, and with<br/>
them came many others of all colors and all<br/>
creeds-an Irishman who had ridden the wide<br/>
ranges with the Canadian Northwest Mounted<br/>
Police, some few gunners from the British<br/>
navy, retired or merely dropped overboard on<br/>
a dark night in Shanghai harbor, German<br/>
strategists who demanded, and got, big salaries<br/>
because they knew just what ought to be done<br/>
at any certain time under any certain conditions,<br/>
even though <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>had never seen it done-all<br/>
these and <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>others came, and they did<br/>
things unnumbered to the Chinese army.<br/>
Therefore is it that the little yellow soldier<br/>
wears to-day a uniform instead of a swaddling<br/>
cloak, and fights-with blank cartridge-with<br/>
all the virtues of the nations great in arms.<br/>
So well has China taken to her heart the lesson<br/>
of the Yalu River. And, all the while, men<br/>
confidently talk of Peace, around the world!<br/>

THE TRANSFORMATION OF SIAM AND FORMOSA<br/>
<br/>
Who can forget the Siam of the school<br/>
geography, with the eloquent picture of the<br/>
Malay running <span style="color: #0000FF;">amuck</span>, with Bangkok, <span style="color: #ff0000;">perched<br/>
<br/>
