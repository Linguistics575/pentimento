</span>evils of other sections." When the late Dr.<br/>
McIver wrote that "we pay convicts, when we<br/>
employ them to work on our own public roads,<br/>
more than we pay capable men and women<br/>
to train children," and that "there is nothing<br/>
in our homes that we would let a forty-dollara-month laborer work upon except the brains<br/>
of our children," he was applauded for it.<br/>
<br/>
A HIGHER INTELLECTUAL AVERAGE<br/>
<br/>
More important than the statement of facts<br/>
has been the presentation, in various forms,<br/>
of the immense significance of universal<br/>
education. One of the most noteworthy<br/>
changes in the more important institutions of<br/>
learning is that their presidents are men<br/>
who have been trained as specialists, and<br/>
who therefore approach educational <span style="color: #0000FF;">prob<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lems </span>from the standpoint of educational<br/>
experts. The time when a broken-down<br/>
politican could be elected to an important<br/>
presidency has passed here as in the rest of the<br/>
country. This is but one of the many changes<br/>
that are indicative of the rejuvenated life of<br/>
Southern colleges. Their faculties, composed<br/>
almost altogether of specialists, are carrying on<br/>
the work of higher education in a spirit which<br/>
has already been noted as characteristic of the<br/>
departments of history and English. Students<br/>
in these institutions are thoroughly abreast<br/>
with contemporary tendencies, both in the<br/>
college world and in the larger world of affairs.<br/>
<br/>
The culmination of the activity in higher<br/>
education is the larger freedom in which men<br/>
work and think. In spite of ecclesiastical influences on the one hand and political influences<br/>
on the other, the best colleges are moving <span style="color: #0000FF;">toward </span>tolerance in all things.<br/>
<br/>
These institutions are the centres of independence in politics, just as independent newspapers and business men are becoming more<br/>
and more prevalent. They are also promoters<br/>
of liberalism in religion-a healthy liberalism<br/>
which has so <span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>caused any radical cleavage.<br/>
Perhaps the most widely circulated story with<br/>
regard to a Southern institution is that of the<br/>
dismissal in 1878 of Professor Winchell from<br/>
Vanderbilt University on account of his views<br/>
on evolution. And yet, if one were to take<br/>
that incident as typical of the educational life<br/>
of the present South, he would misjudge and<br/>
misinterpret it.<br/>
<br/>
The most striking confirmation of the growing freedom in Southern colleges was the action<br/>
of the board of trustees of Trinity College in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SOUTH</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'S </span>INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION<br/>
<br/>
North Carolina in refusing to accept the resignation of Professor Bassett, notwithstanding<br/>
his views on the Negro question. In the face<br/>
of a widespread popular clamor, the trustees<br/>
set forth a declaration of academic freedom<br/>
that resounded throughout the country. Some<br/>
of the sentences will indicate the spirit of<br/>
the whole:<br/>
<br/>
"The search for truth should be unhampered and in an<br/>
atmosphere that is free. Liberty may sometimes lead to<br/>
folly. Yet it is better that some should be tolerated than<br/>
that all should think and speak under the deadening <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fluence </span>of repression. Money, students, friends, are not<br/>
for one moment to be weighed in the balance with tolerance, fairness and with freedom."<br/>
<br/>
The late Chancellor Hill, on reading this<br/>
statement to the students of the University of<br/>
Georgia, characterized it as a ringing <span style="color: #0000FF;">declaration </span>of academic liberty which will be an <span style="color: #0000FF;">immortal </span>chapter in the history of civilization in<br/>
this country.<br/>
<br/>
The movements which I have here briefly<br/>
suggested as they have found expression in<br/>
worthy writing, are but now in the beginning.<br/>
I do not mean that all of them have been victorious, or that they are predominant in Southern life to-day. The forces of reaction and of<br/>
conservatism seem at times all too strong for<br/>
the forces of progress and enlightenment. But<br/>
I have no doubt of the ultimate triumph of<br/>
truth and righteousness and freedom. There<br/>
is in the minds and hearts of the men who work<br/>
for these forces a buoyant <span style="color: #0000FF;">hopefulness </span>that augurs well for the future. Whether they are doing<br/>
the actual work in the industrial world, or<br/>
whether they are engaged in the work of interpreting through the written and spoken word<br/>
the tendencies that I have indicated, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">believe </span>that their task is one of the noblest ever<br/>
committed to men. They do not need the pity<br/>
of any outsider who may look with condescension upon the South of to-day. They<br/>
glory in the difficulty and the high privilege<br/>
of the task. They believe the South to-day<br/>
to be, as America was in the day of Emerson,<br/>
the land of opportunity. As one of our own<br/>
number has recently said:<br/>
<br/>
"Those that sit in soft places and discuss academic<br/>
propositions (and mistake self-indulgence and criticism<br/>
for the intellectual life) are welcome to their ease. We<br/>
would not swap birthrights with them. If we have a rough<br/>
task, it is a high task. While we are doing it, we shall<br/>
have the joy of constructive activity. We look forward<br/>
to a golden age that we may surely help to bring, not back<br/>
to one that never was."<br/>
