<br/>
</span>after-glow on my tongue of a coal-tar essence<br/>
that must have been used too freely. Another<br/>
grain of benzoic acid taken in with the syrup<br/>
didn't matter very much.<br/>
<br/>
"For lunch, we enjoyed spring lamb chops<br/>
of frozen <span style="color: #0000FF;">tenderness-and </span>nitre and red ochre<br/>
freshness. The peas were copper-greened and<br/>
fresh-from the can. The horseradish was<br/>
out of a bottle of ground turnip, while onethird of a grain of benzoic acid and some<br/>
cochineal came with the brilliant ketchup. A<br/>
whole grain of benzoic acid (natural to the<br/>
fruit) joined those which had gone before,<br/>
when I ate some cranberries<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Wc all looked well preserved for our years,<br/>
with promise of more to come. The'pure<br/>
leaf lard' made of <span style="color: #ff0000;">olemn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cottenseedii </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ct </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stearinii<br/>
</span>gave the French-fried potatoes a piquant<br/>
individuality, although its repetition when we<br/>
ate lettuce with salad dressing fetched an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">olive-oil </span>reminiscence to my mind. More<br/>
benzoic acid came with the down-trodden<br/>
spaghetti, served with <span style="color: #ff0000;">non-deeomposable </span>sauce.<br/>
We had a little more with the nice hamburger<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pttés</span>; but not so much as rightfully occurred<br/>
in the prunes served with a very thick, rich,<br/>
yellow cream, which analyzed into skimmed<br/>
milk, water, <span style="color: #ff0000;">viscogen</span>, and annatto oil. I<br/>
figure about seven grains of benzoic acid since<br/>
rising.<br/>
<br/>
"Miss Peterkin praised the'home-made'<br/>
quince jelly, one of the'Mother Jones Pure<br/>
Jellies.' This particular specimen worked<br/>
out as apple juice, glucose, gelatine, <span style="color: #0000FF;">saccharin</span>,<br/>
and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">f1avoring </span>coal-tar essence of quince,<br/>
formula <span style="color: #ff0000;">CZHSCQHWOZ</span>. There was just a<br/>
little benzoic acid here. I had to take a<br/>
long walk after lunch; having overheard the<br/>
order for dinner, I figured on about <span style="color: #0000FF;">11 </span>to 15<br/>
grains more of benzoic acid reaching my<br/>
stomach by bedtime."<br/>

ADULTERATIONS GOOD AND BAD<br/>
<br/>
There are 409 pages of text in the<br/>
Government report of the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hearing </span>before the<br/>
Committee on Interstate and Foreign <span style="color: #ff0000;">Commcrcc</span>," but there is very little agreement on<br/>
questions about the harmfulness of preservatives<br/>
and the use of synthetic products; the general<br/>
impression on the reader is that nobody knows<br/>
whether they are harmful or not. Dr. Vaughn,<br/>
professor of physiological chemistry and hygiene<br/>
in the University of Michigan, a man of the<br/>
highest scientific standing, declared the use<br/>
of certain amounts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">benzoic </span>acid to be safe<br/>

<br/>
</span>SAVES US FROM <span style="color: #0000FF;">9317<br/>
</span>and healthful. Dr. Wiley, for the Government, says, in effect, "not proven and probably<br/>
not true."<br/>
<br/>
There are two sides to the question of food<br/>
preservatives. Packing houses make two kinds<br/>
of lard. One is composed of the leaf fat of<br/>
the hog; it is the lard of our ancestors, white,<br/>
pure, and homogeneous. The other is a mixture of stearine and cottonseed oil, stearine<br/>
being the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oil-globule </span>skins of suet, the residue<br/>
in the press after its oil has been expressed for<br/>
use in making oleomargarine. The other<br/>
element used in composing this second variety<br/>
of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">lard </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>is cottonseed oil. It comes from the<br/>
South in tank-cars like those of the Standard<br/>
Oil Company, and is renovated and strained<br/>
through fullers' earth. There is no health<br/>
principle involved in this straining through<br/>
fullers' earth; it is to prevent the lard from<br/>
looking murky when dancing in the skillet<br/>
and blue when asleep in the can. This would<br/>
lead to its detection<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This care in the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">make-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">up</span>" costs the manufacturers <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a cent per<br/>
gallon. Now is this lard impure, unhealthy,<br/>
adulterated? Is an oil taken from a hog that<br/>
has been fed on swill and vegetable garbage<br/>
any purer or more nutritious than an oil<br/>
elaborated from an ever self-purifying hillside<br/>
soil?<br/>

On the shelves of a wholesale <span style="color: #ff0000;">maufaeturer<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">synthetieal </span>products (nature foods or essences<br/>
made in the laboratory) stand a number of<br/>
two-gallon bottles. Pass the corks in turn<br/>
gently under the nose, and you can name the<br/>
fruit odors they aim to duplicate-pear, banana,<br/>
pineapple, raspberry, peach, plum, etc. Here<br/>
are delicate variations of odors, differences as<br/>
slight perhaps as the vibratory waves of color,<br/>
close imitations of the perfumes of fruit and<br/>
flower because they are the "formulary" perfumes of fruit and flowers. And yet not one of<br/>
them came from <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower</span>, fruit, or berry.<br/>

THE VERSATILE COAL-TAR PRODUCTS<br/>
<br/>
Coal-tar, the black refuse of the retort that<br/>
lights our homes, is the parent stock of these<br/>
sweetest, lightest, fairy perfumes of the synthetic garden. Coal-tar, that crackles in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">canncl-coal</span>, can destroy the infesting germs<br/>
and slay as readily as it can save our lives;<br/>
it can paint the lily and the rose in a thousand<br/>
shades of dye; it can redden the faded ketchup,<br/>
green the sallowed pea, sweeten the acrid coffee,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">saffronize </span>the pale oleomargarine, rainbow the<br/>
peppermint stick, <span style="color: #0000FF;">emeraldize </span>the white <span style="color: #0000FF;">créme<br/>
