</span>edible neglected in Tokyo's garbage. Every<br/>
ounce of material goes to cheap <span style="color: #0000FF;">eating-houses<br/>
</span>in the slums to be retailed <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the poor. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
</span>corporation has been formed to control the<br/>
collection of garbage and its distribution to the<br/>
restaurants which make up their bill of fare<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">filthy </span>mess brought to them daily.<br/>
With work scarce in comparison to the labor<br/>
supply, wages low, and food and clothing high<br/>
in price and going higher, the man in the Tokyo<br/>
street is becoming <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">grumbler</span>. With the newly<br/>
rich evincing a class despotism that the kindly<br/>
old aristocracy never dreamed of, the Japanese<br/>
is beginning to resent his wholesale exploitation.<br/>

places. The huge factory is driving out the<br/>
little shop where the worker was an artist carrying out his <span style="color: #ff0000;">ownrideas </span>of beauty in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest </span>things and making his humble trademark<br/>
famous in his locality. But, hardest of all,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Japanese </span>capitalist is the most remorseless<br/>
devourer of little ones the world has known.<br/>
He has prevented any legislation whatever to<br/>
protect the children, and they are remorselessly used as factory hands.<br/>

The Japanese newspaper men work for<br/>
salaries that would be despised by a New <span style="color: #0000FF;">York<br/>
