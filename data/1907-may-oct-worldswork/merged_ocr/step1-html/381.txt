<span>MEXICO AT HIGH-TIDE<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>REMARKABLE PROGRESS OF A <span style="color: #0000FF;">WONDERFULLY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RICH<br/>
</span>COUNTRY BEING DEVELOPED LARGELY BY AMERICAN CAPITAL<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">EXICO</span>'S prosperity is of a piece with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>the general prosperity. Good times<br/>
with us redound to its advantage,<br/>
putting wheat bread as well as tortillas into the<br/>
mouth of the peon. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">the.other </span>hand, its<br/>
prosperity is, in a degree, our own. This<br/>
indicates a real bond of kinship between sister<br/>
republics. There is no question of the boom<br/>
having broken out all over Mexico, from the<br/>
tawny northern deserts to the black-green<br/>
jungles of the Hot Country. Like a rash at<br/>
red heat, it has swept across the Chaparral and<br/>
up the Sierras and down into the earth where<br/>
the old Spaniards dug as far as they could.<br/>
<br/>
Four years ago the words "swift enchant-<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meat</span>" were used to suggest the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tremendous</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>

</span>PRESIDENT PORFIRIO DIAZ<br/>
<br/>
Who has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">President </span>since <span style="color: #0000FF;">1877 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>now <span style="color: #0000FF;">sixty-seven </span>years<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">age<br/>
<br/>
</span>was only the leaping forth of the magic wand that<br/>
one saw. Now you see the real <span style="color: #0000FF;">enchantment</span>,<br/>
for progress is advancing with the rapidity of the<br/>
growth of a tropical weed. The Mexican Government has attracted capital to its vast natural<br/>
resources to a degree that means development.<br/>
This it has achieved more especially of late by<br/>
two or three brilliant strokes cf history-making.<br/>
The former article (September, 1903) bemoaned<br/>
the erratic silver standard as a drag on industrial<br/>
development. There were, indeed, half a billion<br/>
American dollars then invested in Mexico, but<br/>
millions and millions more were piled up and<br/>
ready to flood over the valleys and mountains so<br/>
soon as Mexico itself opened the sluices by the<br/>
lever of a stable currency. "If Diaz gives his<br/>
country sound money," it was then predicted,<br/>
