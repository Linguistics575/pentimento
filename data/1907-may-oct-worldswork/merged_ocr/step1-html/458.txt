<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9256 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">HOW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">KEEP<br/>
</span>that nobody in the community knew the methods<br/>
by which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Borough </span>President was spending<br/>
the people's <span style="color: #0000FF;">money</span>. The inquiry was begun<br/>
in January, 1906, by men engaged to work<br/>
every day until the task was finished. The<br/>
results were published in November, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1906</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The report showed that the Borough President could not himself know what his <span style="color: #0000FF;">subordinates </span>were doing because misleading records<br/>
were kept; that for two years his books had not<br/>
even been balanced; that friends and aliases of<br/>
borough officials had received jobs without<br/>
public bids; that $ 5,000 jobs were divided<br/>
into five contracts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">351,000 </span>so that the letter<br/>
of the law should not be violated; that the<br/>
Borough President had used $ 250 a month<br/>
for unspecified expenses; that streets were<br/>
neglected because inefficiency prevailed. There<br/>
was nothing picturesque or sensational about<br/>
such evidence. Its publication aroused no one<br/>
to a white heat of moral indignation. In fact,<br/>
it is safe to guess that among any particular<br/>
thousand "best citizens" in New York not<br/>
ten ever gave the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>announcement a second<br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
When the report was published, the Borough<br/>
President won for himself no little sympathy<br/>
by asking the Mayor for a thorough investigation. He had "absolutely nothing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>same appealing candor as was<br/>
used by insurance plunderers, more recently<br/>
by Ruef of San Francisco, and always by<br/>
offenders so long as they think the searchlight<br/>
is temporary. The Mayor's Commissioners<br/>
of Accounts pottered around a few days and<br/>
then reported that they had examined the <span style="color: #0000FF;">books<br/>
</span>and acts of the Borough <span style="color: #0000FF;">President</span>'s various<br/>
officers and were happy to say that, while<br/>
certain technical irregularities were discovered,<br/>
they were of the kind to be expected in the<br/>
conduct of any large business. They also<br/>
respectfully and regretfully reported that the<br/>
Bureau's total on page 113 should be $ 78,943.13<br/>
instead of $ 78,940.13, etc. They fully expected<br/>
that after this vindication the <span style="color: #ff0000;">combatantsreformer </span>and accused <span style="color: #0000FF;">official-would </span>shake<br/>
hands and exchange compliments. Indeed,<br/>
nothing further would have happened if the<br/>
issue had been one of "goodness" rather than<br/>
of efficiency, if the Bureau had not sought<br/>
to make the situation intelligible rather than<br/>
to bring about <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>moral upheaval.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>white-washing" report of the Commissioners of Accounts was not printed in the<br/>
newspapers. It was withheld because the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">HOW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">KEEP </span>GOVERNMENT EFFICIENT<br/>
<br/>
Mayor was confronted with facsimiles of<br/>
receipts, requisitions, and correspondence,<br/>
taken directly from the books and records of<br/>
the Borough President, that disproved the<br/>
Commissioners' report. The official experts<br/>
were ordered to investigate again and to bring<br/>
back the truth and the whole truth. Even<br/>
now, when Mr. Ahearn has dismissed his chief<br/>
subordinates on the ground that their <span style="color: #0000FF;">inefficiency </span>has brought him into disrepute, and when<br/>
the deposed subordinates declare that whatever irregularities they committed were committed under orders from the Borough President, there are those in the community who say<br/>
that the investigation has been successful only<br/>
because of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">factional </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span>between the Mayor<br/>
and Tammany Hall. It is true that it would<br/>
have been harder, and would have cost more to<br/>
prove the gross inefficiency of the Borough<br/>
President and his subordinates, had the Mayor<br/>
thrown obstacles in the way. It is quite as<br/>
true, however, that taxpayers have at all times<br/>
the right to obtain such information regarding<br/>
any inefficient department, and can at any<br/>
time secure public condemnation of guilt or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inefficiency</span>, if willing to spend the money and<br/>
the time necessary to obtain the facts for<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But the uncovering of inefficiency or dishonesty is but a small part of the end sought<br/>
by the Bureau. Whether any particular<br/>
official is removed or not, whether or not<br/>
criminal charges are brought against him and<br/>
his subordinates, makes relatively little <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference</span>. He knows, and all of his subordinates<br/>
know, that the same discomfort and discredit<br/>
can be brought about again within thirty days<br/>
by exactly the same methods, unless inefficiency<br/>
is removed or overcome. The reason why this<br/>
official is not defiant is that he has lost the chief<br/>
asset of the corrupt leader-namely, ignorance<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">on'the </span>part of the public. Nothing <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>puts<br/>
the standing of any kind of "crook" <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">grafter</span>" in jeopardy among his peers as<br/>
"being found with the goods on him." A<br/>
less clever man than Mr. Aheam could see<br/>
that it would be futile for him to say that there<br/>
were no holes in the streets, no perversion of<br/>
funds, etc., when he knows that a convincing<br/>
refutation would immediately be published by<br/>
the Bureau of Municipal Research.<br/>
<br/>
If the Borough President is removed and<br/>
a corrupt man takes his place, that corrupt<br/>
man will know that unless he installs a system<br/>
to prevent inefficiency, he cannot, so long as<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
