After seven years of work in tropical jungles,<br/>
this "bridge of the world's commerce," as<br/>
Humboldt called it, was formally opened last<br/>
January by Presidential decree. General <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dial<br/>
</span>pressed a button, and an electric <span style="color: #0000FF;">crane </span>lifted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>bags of Hawaiian sugar from the hold<br/>
of a steamship. A train was loaded, which he<br/>
sealed, and a few days later he broke the seal<br/>
on the other coast of the continent. The<br/>
cargo had saved 1,250 miles, or five days, by<br/>
going this way instead of by Panama. Even<br/>

shorter route, by four days. Former Chief<br/>
Engineer Wallace recently urged on a Senate<br/>
committee the need of better facilities and<br/>
lower rates on the Panama Railroad. Even if<br/>
we must operate the road at a loss, we should do<br/>
so, he is quoted as saying, because if once<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>is diverted to Tehuantepec, we may lose<br/>
five or ten million dollars a year on our Canal<br/>
during the years required to draw the traffic<br/>
back again. But this much is certain: the<br/>
freight in sight for the first year <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tchuautepec </span>road is already half a million tons; or,<br/>
to quote the constructing engineer, "probably<br/>
33% more than the Panama Railway ever<br/>
