</span>A JAPANESE HOME IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">TH<br/>
<br/>
</span>The burden <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>war taxes falls heavily on the peasants<br/>
<br/>
tind means of livelihood anywhere. Thousands<br/>
of them are roaming the highways or starving<br/>
in the city slums. The fact that a Japanese<br/>
once in possession of a job cannot be dislodged<br/>
made it hard for the veterans to get the <span style="color: #ff0000;">stayat-homes </span>out of the places they <span style="color: #0000FF;">preempted<br/>
</span>when the lighting men went to the front. These<br/>
poor fellows found that while cheered in the<br/>
streets they were politely but none the less<br/>
firmly rejected in shops and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">here<br/>
</span>was no room for them. It is interesting to<br/>
follow the history of an individual known to the<br/>
writer:<br/>
<br/>
Taki <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zenzaburo </span>was one of the first of the<br/>
Tokyo'rickshaw men to quit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">profitable<br/>
</span>stand at the Shimbashi railway station and go<br/>
to war. He had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">earning </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">tsvomty-fivc<br/>
</span>to fifty cents a day, and was esteemed a very<br/>
lucky fellow. He sold his'rickshaw to raise<br/>
money for the support of his aged father, whom<br/>
he left alone in the little house of a few mats<br/>
they rented not far from the busy station. After<br/>
sixteen months he returned, a sturdy, healthy<br/>
figure broadened and benefited by campaigning.<br/>
He wore his war medal proudly and marched<br/>
with his comrades along cheering lanes of little<br/>
men and women under canopies of flags and<br/>
felt himself more than compensated for <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>TAX AND POVERTY<br/>
<br/>
sacrifices when the Son of Heaven reviewed the<br/>
army in Uyeno Park. Taki was happy; he<br/>
had offered his all to his country, and surely<br/>
good fortune pursued those who dared the<br/>
Patriot's death.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Taki was mustered out he hurried<br/>
to his home, which he found occupied by<br/>
strangers. His father had died a few days<br/>
before, and his effects had been sold to pay the<br/>
funeral expenses and doctor's bills. For a<br/>
time he was welcome everywhere and was<br/>
entertained by patriotic citizens who took<br/>
delight in receiving heroes of the great war, but<br/>
soon the enthusiasm died out and Tokyo<br/>
returned to its monotonous daily life. Taki<br/>
was unable to find employment, owing to the<br/>
glut of unskilled labor. In all that city of five<br/>
hundred thousand houses and two million souls<br/>
there was no niche for him. He could not<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">reenter </span>the ranks of the'rickshaw men at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shimbashi </span>station, as he had no money to buy or<br/>
rent a vehicle and to pay the $ 25 deposit required of those human coach horses who have<br/>
the monopoly of this rich territory. He found<br/>
the'rickshaw coolies, discouraged by the competition of the railroads, the tram cars, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
