<span>THE DIRECTION OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE<br/>
<br/>
</span>in some sections of the country under certain<br/>
conditions and in other sections of the country<br/>
under other conditions. Fundamentally the<br/>
matter is the same: too small a value is put on<br/>
a human life. And this is yet a defect in our<br/>
American way of thinking and living.<br/>
<br/>
A SHORT STEP ON A LONG JOURNEY<br/>
<br/>
F THE facts about disease and its causes<br/>
and its transmission that have been<br/>
proved over and over again were known and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">healed </span>by the whole population, all contagious<br/>
and most infectious diseases might be banished<br/>
in a single generation. It is within the power<br/>
of any country or community, if all the people<br/>
would work together, to begin a wholly new<br/>
era in health and consequently in efficiency<br/>
and in happiness-to be more healthful and<br/>
robust than any large group of people has ever<br/>
been since the world began.<br/>
<br/>
We are making progress in this direction,<br/>
greater progress, perhaps, than ever before.<br/>
But it is slow, at its swiftest. How discouragingly slow it is in comparison with what it<br/>
might be! For we are yet <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>long way from that<br/>
public and social opinion which will discredit<br/>
a man who becomes ill-regard him as a fool or<br/>
a criminal and untrustworthy. We have not<br/>
yet come into that state of mind which would<br/>
compel the swift and severe punishment of any<br/>
property-holder who has a place where mosquitoes may breed, or who keeps a stable <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>house<br/>
that swarms with flies. Yet such persons are<br/>
worse public enemies, let us say, than petty<br/>
thieves or other kinds of criminals against<br/>
property whom we energetically punish. We<br/>
shall reach this state of mind some day.<br/>
<br/>
In proof of such a prediction, consider a<br/>
recent action of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Merchants' Association of<br/>
New York, which is, of course, a body of very<br/>
practical men, who address themselves to very<br/>
practical tasks. The association solicited a<br/>
fund to investigate "the part played by flies in<br/>
carrying germs of intestinal diseases from the polluted waters about the city to the food supplies<br/>
exposed for sale." Nobody knows how many<br/>
deaths and how much suffering and how much<br/>
impaired efficiency are caused in this way. A<br/>
polluted pool or a neglected lot or an <span style="color: #ff0000;">uncaredfor </span>backyard on a farm or in a suburban<br/>
village has its germs of disease and its swarm<br/>
of flies. The flies carry the germs to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit<br/>
</span>and the vegetables that are sold in the city and<br/>
eaten without cooking; and men, women, and<br/>
children contract diseases in mysterious ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nobody </span>punishes the culprit. Nobody knows<br/>
who the culprit is. We yet accept such diseases<br/>
as unavoidable incidents of life.<br/>
<br/>
Society is only beginning to learn the extent<br/>
to which cooperation is necessary, especially<br/>
sanitary cooperation. For the smaller the<br/>
enemy, the more perfect must be the organization and the cooperation to guard against it.<br/>
To defeat flies and mosquitoes, to say nothing of<br/>
typhoid and tubercular enemies, requires a<br/>
more compact and "centralized" government<br/>
than we have yet accustomed ourselves to;<br/>
for we are still in that crude stage of political<br/>
and social cooperation where the chief work of<br/>
government is <span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting </span>human enemies.<br/>
<br/>
THE DIRECTION OF THE GREATEST PROGRESS<br/>
<br/>
HE direction in which the surest and most<br/>
helpful progress lies for the betterment<br/>
<br/>
of mankind is not in politics nor in religious<br/>
faith nor in what is usually meant when we<br/>
say "education"--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>is, the formal training<br/>
of youth in a conventional set of studies. The<br/>
most rapid and certain progress would be made<br/>
by the application to daily life of the scientific<br/>
knowledge that has been accumulated. Some<br/>
discoveries and inventions do find practical<br/>
application quickly and easily, such as electric<br/>
lighting, the telephone, the gas-engine, inoculation for diphtheria, and many more. Others,<br/>
and many very much simpler, remain unapplied or are slow in <span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>practical use. We<br/>
are beginning to apply the transmission of<br/>
power by the rapid development of hitherto<br/>
unused water-power. But we are yet very slow<br/>
about it. We are strangely slow, too, in applying electricity to many household uses. In<br/>
the great field of preserving health-preventive<br/>
medicine, we sometimes call <span style="color: #0000FF;">it-we </span>are criminally slow. The quack and the vendor <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">drugs</span>,<br/>
even of unknown drugs, do as thriving a business as they ever did. In those tasks that<br/>
require more compact social and political<br/>
organization, such as the conquest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tuberculosis</span>, the prevention of diseases conveyed<br/>
by milk and water, the extermination of mosquitoes and the like, we go forward hesitatingly.<br/>
The adoption of healthful methods of eating,<br/>
even the eating of less food in middle life, is a<br/>
slow process. Real health-resorts, or sanitaria-places where men and women may<br/>
learn before disease attacks them how to live<br/>
so as to avoid the ailments that a wrong system<br/>
of life will surely bring-ought to be within the<br/>
reach of everybody and ought to be so <span style="color: #0000FF;">con<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
