</span>"We are using electricity at the Dover Yarn Mills. At<br/>
the time we installed electric motors, we were also putting<br/>
in some additional machinery and making some other<br/>
changes. However<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as near <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>we can figure, we are getting<br/>
the use of power <span style="color: #ff0000;">to-day-also </span>our lighting, heating, and<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">slashing-for </span>about ll per cent. less than our coal bills<br/>
were, prior to the installation of electricity. I would say,<br/>
however, that we were running under poor conditions so<br/>
far as the distribution of power was concerned.<br/>
<br/>
"We were enabled, in addition to the reduction of coal<br/>
bills, to utilize the space formerly used for boilers and<br/>
engine room for putting in new machinery, and we have<br/>
to-day quite a little more machinery in the same space<br/>
than when we were running by steam alone. The saving<br/>
in head-shafts, heavy shafting, boiler setting, engine <span style="color: #0000FF;">foundations</span>, and boiler and engine rooms, would justify putting<br/>
in electricity in a mill even if the cost of horse-power were<br/>
the same."<br/>
<br/>
The development of the power of the Southern rivers means as much to the Piedmont<br/>
mills as the power of Niagara would mean<br/>
to English cotton spinning if it were situated<br/>
in Manchester. With the added advantage<br/>
of the water power, the development of the<br/>
Southern mills is limited only by the manufacturing ability <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Southern people. In<br/>
spite of their work of the last twenty years,<br/>
that capability is sometimes questioned<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
