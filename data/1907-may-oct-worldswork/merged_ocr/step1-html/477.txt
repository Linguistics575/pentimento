The law went into effect on July Ist. On<br/>
May 8th, the Southern Railway brought suit<br/>
before a Federal Circuit Court to enjoin the<br/>
enforcement of the law pending a final decision.<br/>
This case came to a hearing on June 26th, four<br/>
days before the law was to have gone into effect.<br/>
The court granted this injunction and appointed<br/>
a commissioner to take evidence and report on<br/>
the matter in September, so that a final decision<br/>
could be reached in October. The decision<br/>
ordered the railroad to give to each passenger<br/>
a coupon for the amount he was charged over<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">2i-cent </span>fare, the coupon to be cashed after<br/>
the final decision if this should be against the<br/>
company.<br/>
<br/>
This seemed a sensible settlement, and it is<br/>
practically the arrangement now in force in<br/>
other states in which the railroads have appealed<br/>
to the courts against rate legislation. But<br/>
North Carolina, in the face of the Federal<br/>
decision, prosecuted the Southern Railway for<br/>
a refusal to obey the law and sentenced two<br/>
hapless agents of the company to the chaingang for the offense of selling tickets at the old<br/>
rate. Another agent was forced to give up<br/>
his service, under threat of the law.<br/>
<br/>
Again the railroad had recourse to the<br/>
Federal courts, obtaining freedom for the<br/>
agents and a stay of proceedings under the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">much-discussed </span>law. By the end of July, it<br/>
was a pretty tangle. The state and Federal<br/>
courts were in open conflict. Penalties were<br/>
piling up against the Southern Railway at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>rate sufficient to bankrupt it within a very<br/>
brief time. Under the circumstances, it was<br/>
time for a truce. The Southern Railway<br/>
yielded its point with respect to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">2ยง-cent<br/>
</span>fare, and agreed to put in force such a fare not<br/>
later than August 8th, and to maintain it pending a final judgment before the Supreme<br/>
Court of the United States. To the end that<br/>
such a judgment shall be obtained speedily,<br/>
a suit will be pressed before the Supreme<br/>
Court of the state and, if decided against the<br/>
company, carried thence to the Supreme Court<br/>
of the United States. In the meantime, the<br/>
state will not institute any other suits for failure<br/>
to comply prior to August 8th, and will endeavor<br/>
to restrain private individuals from bringing<br/>
suits on such grounds.<br/>
<br/>
At this point the matter now rests. It is not<br/>
possible to form a judgment on the constitutional question until the Supreme Court shall<br/>
have passed upon it. It is clear, however, that<br/>
North Carolina did deliberately attempt, in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9275<br/>
<br/>
</span>framing this law or in enforcing it, to close the<br/>
Federal courts to the railroads affected by the<br/>
law. The state has put itself in a position not<br/>
at all praiseworthy. The law should give to<br/>
every man all possible safeguards in his property rights, and should in all cases assist appeals<br/>
to the courts for protection in such rights. In<br/>
this anti-railroad legislation a deliberate effort<br/>
has been made to cut off from the railroads,<br/>
themselves the creatures of the state, the full<br/>
privilege of law.<br/>
<br/>
The real result of the episode, however, is<br/>
to stir up hatred against the corporations.<br/>
The whole affair lends added point to the<br/>
following paragraph, printed in THE WORLD'S<br/>
WORK for June, in a discussion of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">legisrs<br/>
</span>lation of Alabama, North Carolina, and other<br/>
Southern States:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'m </span>is all of a character to satisfy the demands of the<br/>
people who elected the legislators, and much of it is designed at the same time to destroy a large part of the<br/>
earning capacity of capital invested in those states within<br/>
the past twenty years. Such as is most <span style="color: #0000FF;">flagrantly </span>in<br/>
violation of the rights of property will be set aside by the<br/>
Supreme Courts, but the net result of the steps necessary<br/>
to this end will be that the public hostility toward the railroads will be increased by the bitterness growing out of<br/>
suits fought by the railroads against the states."<br/>

HE Civic Federation appointed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">competent </span>committee, made up of men<br/>
several of whom are men of distinction and all<br/>
men of earnestness, to investigate the working<br/>
of the municipal ownership of public utilities<br/>
in the United States and, as far as they chose,<br/>
abroad. First, individual investigators of the<br/>
committee made their reports, and of these<br/>
somewhat conflicting reports the whole committee made a final one. The committee<br/>
contains men who hold different and conflicting<br/>
theories and among them are professional<br/>
students of such questions, business men, and<br/>
leaders of labor. The value of the final report,<br/>
therefore, is very considerable. Its most<br/>
important clauses are:<br/>
<br/>
"Public <span style="color: #ff0000;">Utilities</span>, whether in public or private hands, are<br/>
best conducted under a system of legalized and regulated<br/>
monopoly<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Public utilities in which the sanitary motive largely<br/>
enters should be operated by the public.<br/>
<br/>
"The success of municipal operation of public utilities<br/>
depends upon the existence in the city of a high capacity<br/>
for municipal government.<br/>
<br/>
"Franchise grants to Private corporations should <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
