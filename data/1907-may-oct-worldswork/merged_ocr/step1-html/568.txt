schemes that were offered me, but I learned the<br/>

came to Columbus, I made up my mind to put<br/>

President Jones made a fortune, I am told,<br/>
of something like $ 30,000 before he came to<br/>
Wilberforce as president of the College.<br/>
<br/>
PROMINENT CITIZENS OF WILBERFORCE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>impressed with the fact, during my visits<br/>
to Wilberforce, that one thing which has given<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span>to the community is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">distinguished </span>men who have lived and worked here.<br/>
<br/>
The house which President Jones occupies<br/>
at present was formerly occupied by Bishop<br/>
James A. Shorter, one of the founders of the<br/>
College. Bishop Daniel A. Payne, who was<br/>
more than any one else responsible for the<br/>
existence of the College, lived near by for many<br/>
years, until he died, in 1892. Bishop B. W.<br/>
Arnett, who, until he died in the fall of 1906,<br/>
was one of the most influential men in the<br/>
African Methodist <span style="color: #ff0000;">Espicopal </span>Church and<br/>
one of the trustees of the College, lived<br/>
for thirty-five years in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilberforce</span>. Bishop<br/>
Arnett was born in a Quaker settlement at<br/>
Brownsville, Pa., in the same year as James<br/>
G. Blaine, whose parents lived directly across<br/>
the street.<br/>
<br/>
Though these men are little known to the<br/>
world at large, they did good service for the<br/>
uplifting of the Negro race and are remembered<br/>
with reverence and gratitude by the people<br/>
they served, both outside and inside of the<br/>
church whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>they have helped to<br/>
extend all over the United States and even to<br/>
Africa. Every year brings a considerable<br/>
number of students who come from Africa to<br/>
prepare themselves for the ministry at the<br/>
theological seminary connected with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">College </span>here.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting little homes<br/>
in the community is that of Miss Hallie Q.<br/>
Brown, who has been for years a public figure.<br/>
She is an elocutionist, and in the course of a<br/>
long professional career has traveled all over<br/>
the world. She was at one time what used to<br/>
be known as "Lady Principal" at Tuskegee.<br/>
Although by the nature of her profession she<br/>
is constantly moving about, she has maintained<br/>
her home in Wilberforce ever since her graduation from the College in 1873. The house is<br/>
occupied at present by her mother and sister.<br/>
Mrs, Brown<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>her mother, is an interesting old<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">NEGRO </span>COLLEGE TOWN<br/>
<br/>
lady whose memories go back to the days<br/>
before the war, in Virginia. In 1860, she,<br/>
with her husband and a number of other<br/>
colored people, went from Pittsburg to Canada,<br/>
and lived for a time in what was known as<br/>
"Kings Settlement," one of several refugee<br/>
settlements founded near Chatham, Canada.<br/>
Her son, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerre </span>Brown, is immigrant inspector<br/>
at Detroit, Mich. He is one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>considerable<br/>
number of successful young men, in different<br/>
parts of the country, who have gone out from<br/>
Wilberforce and <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">claim </span>it, in a way, as their<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
Another former student, who after some<br/>
years in the West has returned to Wilberforce<br/>
to make his home, is W. A. Anderson, who<br/>
conducts a grocery business. He lives in a<br/>
comfortable and well ordered little home<br/>
which, like nearly all the homes in this community, displays a thrifty sense of order and<br/>
a discipline in the household virtues, which<br/>
is, after all, perhaps the most important product of Christian civilization.<br/>
<br/>
THE PROSPERITY OF WILBERFORCE NEGROES<br/>
<br/>
Of the sixty families that make up the Wilberforce community, forty-seven own their own<br/>
homes. Four farmers of the community own<br/>
land in the surrounding country which is<br/>
valued at about $ 100 an acre. The College<br/>
has 350 acres. President Jones has 280 acres,<br/>
a part of which he hopes to add to what the<br/>
school now possesses, should the agricultural<br/>
school eventually be established. In all, there<br/>
is owned by the school and members of the<br/>
community about 1,700 acres.<br/>
<br/>
During the last few years, several handsome<br/>
new homes have been erected, fitted with all<br/>
the comforts and the conveniences of modern<br/>
city houses. The home of Bishop Lee, valued<br/>
at $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">6,000</span>, is one of these. Bishop Lee graduated from Wilberforce in 1872, and was<br/>
president of the College from 1876 until 1884,<br/>
when he resigned to accept the editorship of<br/>
the Christian Record, one of the publications<br/>
of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.<br/>
He makes his home in Wilberforce, though<br/>
his duties take him away a large part of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph P. Shorter, superintendent of the<br/>
Normal and Industrial Department, which<br/>
was established by the Ohio legislature in<br/>
1887, owns a farm of eighty acres in the community, the work of which he superintends, in<br/>
addition to his work in the College. Caleb<br/>
Nooks, a former student who is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">cattle-buyer<br/>
