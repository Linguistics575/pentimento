CAMPAIGN FUNDS AS AN EDUCATIONAL<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">INFLUENCE<br/>
<br/>
</span>IN ONE of his interesting recent <span style="color: #0000FF;">addresses </span>at Yale University, Secretary Root<br/>
spoke of the educational value of political<br/>
campaigns and in defense of campaign funds.<br/>
Among other interesting things, he said this:<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Doubtless </span>there may have been abuses in raising and<br/>
applying campaign funds, but in the main there is no more<br/>
useful expenditure of money from the public point of view<br/>
than this, which in the last Presidential election, according<br/>
to official statements, amounted to only about three and<br/>
one-half cents per capita for the people of the United States<br/>
on one side and probably somewhat less on the other, for<br/>
the great bulk of it is applied to the political education bf<br/>
voters."<br/>
<br/>
True enough, if only campaign funds be<br/>
willingly paid and be paid only for patriotic<br/>
motives and be spent in legitimate ways. The<br/>
main matter is not the amount of a fund but<br/>
what it is paid for, both when it is paid in and<br/>
when it is paid out.<br/>
<br/>
We have grown somewhat more sensitive<br/>
about motives and purposes; and it is hoped that<br/>
this public sensitiveness will continue till <span style="color: #0000FF;">Con</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>gress makes it imperative <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the collectors and<br/>
spenders of these funds that they shall publish<br/>
a truthful accounting. Then there can be<br/>
little, if any, objection to them or to the size of<br/>
them. In fact, publicity will prevent them<br/>
from becoming very large. And, whether<br/>
large or small, their educational value will be<br/>
as great as Secretary Root declares, just as<br/>
their demoralizing influence under the old<br/>
practice of bargains and secrecy is out of proportion to their size.<br/>
<br/>
ABOUT SECRETARY TAFT<br/>
<br/>
SYMPATHETIC sketch and study of<br/>
Secretary Taft's career is begun in<br/>
this number of THE WORLD'S WORK not only<br/>
(nor mainly) because he seems the most<br/>
probable candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency, but especially because<br/>
it is a practically unbroken career in the public<br/>
service; and it is a career that is as good an<br/>
example as contemporary life affords in any<br/>
land of high devotion to public duty.<br/>
He has shown a genius for public affairs,<br/>
and he has had a succession of experiences<br/>
that make him, perhaps, better equipped for<br/>
<br/>
OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
the Presidency than any other man has been in<br/>
our later history. A well-trained lawyer, a notable solicitor for the Government, a judge, the<br/>
practical molder of our colonial <span style="color: #ff0000;">government'<br/>
</span>in the Philippines-a piece of work comparable<br/>
to Lord Cromer's in Egypt-and Secretary<br/>
of War during this period of canal-building<br/>
and of our tutelage of Cuba-this is an experience to ripen a man's judgment, if there<br/>
ever was such an experience. Luck has been<br/>
with him; for luck generally shows a <span style="color: #0000FF;">preference </span>for such a combination of character and<br/>
temperament. Mr Lyle's story of Secretary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s life is as good matter for the building up<br/>
of a sound view of public service in our <span style="color: #0000FF;">democracy </span>as this magazine knows how to present.<br/>
It is a record of high service, not of private<br/>
gain, at every step.<br/>
<br/>
And, as far as present indications are trustworthy (in the shifting scenes of national<br/>
politics where all indications may be fallacious),<br/>
Secretary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seems </span>much more likely than<br/>
any other man to be the Republican nominee.<br/>
The farce of Senator Foraker's opposition to<br/>
him in Ohio was too shallow and too short<br/>
even to afford good political sport; and no<br/>
other man within the range of the convention's<br/>
probabilities presents such positive qualities<br/>
of confidence and popularity. The Secretary,<br/>
with character and experience of the highest<br/>
kind and with a winning personality, stands<br/>
for definite policies which the people understand and have approved both at a Presidential<br/>
and a Congressional election-the broad <span style="color: #ff0000;">policies </span>of the present Administration.<br/>
<br/>
Again, if present signs mean anything, the<br/>
Democrats will nominate Mr. Bryan; and<br/>
Secretary Taft will win with Mr. Bryan as<br/>
his opponent. That is as certain as any<br/>
political prediction can be.<br/>

THE NEW YORK PUBLIC UTILITIES LAW<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">MOST </span>extraordinary and most hopeful<br/>
thing has come to pass in the state <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>New York. Public opinion led by one resolute<br/>
man has expressed itself in radical legislative<br/>
action against the determined and combined<br/>
efforts of the political managers of both parties<br/>
and of the great interests that hold the public<br/>
franchises in the state. Governor Hughes's<br/>
Utilities Bill became a law in spite of these<br/>
difficulties and over the veto of the mayor of<br/>
New York City. As a demonstration of the<br/>
power of public opinion, well led, over the<br/>
strongest combination of opposing interests<br/>
