<br/>
of railroads for new capital for improvement,<br/>
equipment, and development of the property,<br/>
and the country served, should be placed under<br/>
the supervision of the Interstate Commerce<br/>
Commission, with authority only to authorize<br/>
such increase of capital as the property needs<br/>
to fully take care of its requirements.<br/>
<br/>
This is a question that will require careful<br/>
consideration and the Commissioners should<br/>
be allowed sufficient latitude for them to use<br/>
some discretion as conditions may warrant.<br/>
<br/>
4. Uniform System of Accounts<br/>
<br/>
I believe that there should be uniformity in<br/>
accounts, and I am glad to see the efforts now<br/>
being made in that direction by the Government. When the end is accomplished and the<br/>
plan is in working order, the investor will<br/>
know that the reports of the different companies are a correct guide to the value of their<br/>
securities. In other words, the annual <span style="color: #ff0000;">r√©ports<br/>
</span>of the railroads will be a proper and <span style="color: #0000FF;">legitimate </span>basis for public confidence, as they<br/>
should be.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>Publicity<br/>
<br/>
There should be no mystery in the railroad<br/>
business. I think that our accounts should<br/>
be subject to inspection by the Government,<br/>
as openly and as freely as the accounts of a<br/>
national bank are now subject to the inspection of the examiners; but all information<br/>
pertaining to the railroads' business should<br/>
be protected against improper use. Such<br/>
publicity will be found the ultimate safeguard of the laws looking toward fair rates<br/>
and equitable dealings, and will, at the same<br/>
time, afford to the investor another proper<br/>
test of value for the securities he buys or owns.<br/>
<br/>
6. Legalized <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rafic </span>Association<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that railroad pools should be<br/>
legalized, but I do believe that traffic associations between railroads should be allowed.<br/>
Suppose, for instance, that two railroads can<br/>
reach all the lumber traffic of the states of<br/>
Texas and Washington. They might form<br/>
a pool with certain connecting lines northward<br/>
and eastward, whereby those connecting lines<br/>
should receive all this lumber for transportation beyond the northern and eastern termini<br/>
of the two lines. A pool is a closed association.<br/>
A traffic association, on the other hand, is open,<br/>
and all the connecting lines are allowed to<br/>
participate. The Federal Government, by<br/>
<br/>
THE PEOPLE, THE RAILROADS, AND THE GOVERNMENT<br/>
<br/>
endorsing a pool, would give an advantage to<br/>
a few of the stronger lines to the detriment of<br/>
others not parties to the pool. By legalizing<br/>
the traffic association, however, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government </span>would be legislating for the whole, rather<br/>
than for the part. This is the true function<br/>
of Government.<br/>
<br/>
When the Government shall have established<br/>
its interstate traffic agents at the different<br/>
commercial centres of the country, the Federal traffic representative should attend the<br/>
meetings of the railroad traffic associations,<br/>
where all matters pertaining to the movement<br/>
of traffic, rules, rates, and regulations governing<br/>
same, could be discussed between the officers<br/>
of the roads and the representative of the<br/>
Government.<br/>
<br/>
7. A Reasonable Time for Delivery<br/>
<br/>
The railroads should fix a reasonable time<br/>
in which the freight is to be delivered to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">consignees</span>. The limit should be abundantly<br/>
reasonable, because the nature of the freight<br/>
business, over which the railroads cannot always<br/>
control, demands a great deal of liberality in<br/>
its movement, but I believe some of the time<br/>
now consumed in such delivery should be and<br/>
could be saved, to the profit of both the consignees and the railroads. Such a regulation<br/>
could be worked out that would be of mutual<br/>
interest to the railroads and the shippers.<br/>
<br/>
8. Relation of State and Federal Power<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>Where the state regulation of rates, or state<br/>
legislation on other railroad subjects, directly<br/>
affects interstate transportation, the Federal<br/>
authority should rule. For instance, let us<br/>
assume that the rate from Denver to St. Louis<br/>
is $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">150</span>, made up of $ 1 from Denver to the<br/>
Missouri River and 50 cents local from the<br/>
Missouri River to St. Louis. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>Missouri<br/>
should reduce the local rate in Missouri to 30<br/>
cents, it would make the interstate rate $ 1.30,<br/>
which means, in effect, that the rate on commerce between states has been fixed by the<br/>
State Commissioners instead of the Federal<br/>
Commissioners. This is only one of the numerous cases and is the same as is taking place in<br/>
all the states and territories where state legislation, by reducing state rates, is establishing the<br/>
rate on the interstate commerce; while our<br/>
National Commissioners at Washington, although authorized by specific Act of Congress,<br/>
charged with the duty, and the only body<br/>
authorized by law to make such regulations,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
