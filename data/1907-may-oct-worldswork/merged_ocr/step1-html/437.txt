Most of the activities of to-day in the world<br/>
of medicine and its wide-spreading allies are<br/>
along the lines of control of the destructive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ferments</span>. Bacterial infections act <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>through the poisonous <span style="color: #0000FF;">ferments </span>secreted by<br/>
the germs in the blood. Internal disarrangements of stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney,<br/>
thyroid, suprarenals, loss of arterial elasticity,<br/>
are all instituted by the loss of balance between<br/>
the constructive and destructive ferments; and<br/>
investigators aim at discovering the exact<br/>
chemical nature of these ferments, and the<br/>
discovery of their antidotes. Medicine has<br/>
yet far to go to not only successfully cope with<br/>
the giant ferments that make such short <span style="color: #0000FF;">shrift<br/>

deeper, more delicate, and difficult class of<br/>
ferments which work destruction to all alike in<br/>

But it seems almost certain that the next fifty<br/>
years will see far more amazing advance than<br/>
even the past half-century has shown, in which<br/>
over 90 per cent. of present day medical skill<br/>
has been attained; and equally certain, that no<br/>
one great discovery will throw open the portals<br/>
of this great realm of mysteries, either in cause<br/>
or cure. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Many </span>angles and facets, shadows<br/>
and high-lights must be thrown on the screen<br/>

A NEW RELIEF TO CITY TRAFFIC<br/>
<br/>
THE SUCCESS <span style="color: #ff0000;">oy </span>MOTOR CABS AND'BUSES IN LONDON AND PARIS<br/>
<br/>
BY<br/>
HARRY <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>PERRY<br/>
<br/>
of a great city by the use of motor<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">omnibuses</span>. Last year 800 of these<br/>
'buses, operated by 25 companies, carried<br/>
184,000,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">passengers-Foot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">day </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>an average fare of a little more than a cent a<br/>
mile. The street railways of London carried<br/>
4,000,000 fewer passengers during the same<br/>
period, and the best record of the New York<br/>
subway is only about 540,000 passengers<br/>
carried in one day. And this new and simple<br/>
device for relieving traffic has earned from 7<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per cent. a year on an investment of<br/>
$ 5,000,000<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>No American city has such a system, but<br/>
the facts that follow seem to show that the<br/>
example of London and Paris could be followed<br/>
by New York and Chicago, and other congested cities, to the great convenience and comfort of the public and to the profit of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">promoters</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The advantages of the system <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>being<br/>
increasingly appreciated. The owners have<br/>
no heavy investment to make in rails or trolleys. The public convenience is better served,<br/>
because the routes of the'buses may be altered<br/>
in an emergency to go around a blocked street,<br/>
<br/>
I ONDON is solving the transit <span style="color: #0000FF;">problem<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>or to meet the exceptional demand for transit<br/>
over new routes on holidays. Ordinarily, these<br/>
'buses run over regular <span style="color: #ff0000;">routes </span>on schedules<br/>
that in some cases assure a passenger that he<br/>
will not have to wait more than ten minutes<br/>
for a'bus at any time of the day. And the<br/>
city traffic problem is simplified by the fact that<br/>
the motor'buses occupy less space and carry<br/>
more passengers than'buses drawn by horses.<br/>
<br/>
These new'buses are double-decked; each<br/>
has seats for <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-four </span>passengers, or ten<br/>
more than the horse'buses accommodate.<br/>
Most of the passengers prefer to sit on the upper<br/>
deck, to which they ascend by means of a<br/>
curved stairway from the rear platform. The<br/>
wheels are rubber-tired, noiseless, and easy.<br/>
The engines, generating from 24 to 40 horsepower, are run by gasoline, all except a very<br/>
few that use steam. The'buses cover their<br/>
eight routes at an average speed of twelve<br/>
miles an hour, making an average daily run<br/>
of from 90 to 120 miles a day. The relative<br/>
seating capacity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">motor'buses </span>and of the<br/>
horse-drawn'buses, considered with the greater<br/>
distance traveled by the motor'bus, indicates<br/>
that one motor displaces from twelve to sixteen<br/>
horses a day, reckoning eleven horses to one<br/>
