bowsprit, there was not sufficient crew to haul<br/>
off the hawser of the life-line, and the line<br/>
soon parted.<br/>
<br/>
"The night was horribly cold, with three<br/>
men on the fore crosstrees and the captain on<br/>
the cap of the bowsprit, with the sea washing<br/>
over him. Soon after dark, the crew aloft<br/>
heard the captain say:'My eyes are now<br/>
freezing, I am growing blind. Oh, my poor<br/>
children!' His hands and feet had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">previously </span>frozen and he was probably washed off<br/>
some time during the night, for he was missing<br/>
in the morning and his body was never found.<br/>
<br/>
"There were three left on the wreck. Two<br/>
were rescued by a tug the next morning and<br/>
the other was left frozen in the crosstrees. I<br/>
arrived on the scene shortly after the tug had<br/>
rescued the two men, and from where I stood<br/>
I could see my townsman frozen in the<br/>
crosstrees. This had a depressing effect on<br/>
me, as it was a vessel which I had personally<br/>
built and sent to sea. I could not but feel at<br/>
the time that I was the murderer of those two<br/>
townsmen and I made up my mind to try and<br/>
atone for this terrible calamity by helping to<br/>
prevent recurrences of such disasters by <span style="color: #0000FF;">establishing </span>lighthouses on unmarked dangers.<br/>
<br/>
"I believe that can be called my first act or<br/>
thought that might be in answer to the letter<br/>
asking for'good faith.'<br/>
<br/>
"That night I was left alone in a cold hotel;<br/>
during the night <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>formed a resolution to make<br/>
an effort of this kind. That led to my subsequent invention of the lighthouse which I have<br/>
worked so many years to get through Congress.<br/>
I also had in mind my own terrible experience<br/>
on my last <span style="color: #ff0000;">vogage </span>south in 1881, in this same<br/>
schooner J. R. Eells, of which I was then<br/>
master and which I sailed from New York<br/>
loaded with railroad-iron bound for Palatka.<br/>
<br/>
"Everything went well until we reached<br/>
Hatteras. It was night and I wished to be on<br/>
the safe side; when by log I had run far enough<br/>
to haul to-that is, to turn the corner-l thought<br/>
the tide might have run stronger than I<br/>
supposed, so I stood further off and was caught<br/>
by the Gulf Stream, which made the water so<br/>
rough that I could not carry sail. In consequence, we were blown to sea and did not get<br/>
back again for thirteen days; and when at<br/>
last I saw land again, I was still north of but<br/>
in sight of Hatteras. Again I tried to round<br/>
the Cape and under very much the same circumstances, but with no better success. My<br/>
vessel was new and strong, as it was built the<br/>
<br/>
FOR HATTERAS 9087<br/>
preceding year, but the sails gave out and the<br/>
oil was spilled and we were in darkness-with<br/>
not even a light in the binnacle to see the compass-and our provisions were getting short.<br/>
Four times we were blown off and four times we<br/>
made Hatteras on the wrong side; in desperation, I made up my mind to hold to the land the<br/>
next time and we went in around the shoals in<br/>
ten fathoms, but with a vow that if we did<br/>
strike the sands I would use every effort to<br/>
place a light on this dreaded shoal. I was then<br/>
supplied with oil and provisions from the<br/>
Fryingpan Lightship, but could get no canvas<br/>
to repair my sails, so we proceeded to Georgetown for repairs. While crossing over the<br/>
bars with a pilot on board, our vessel struck<br/>
on the sand for want of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>sail, injuring<br/>
the hull, and we had to be towed to Charleston<br/>
for repairs; there my bill for repairs was nearly<br/>
$ 4,000. Two other vessels that were in company with us during that terrible time off<br/>
Hatteras were never heard from again.<br/>
<br/>
"On my return to New York, I went to<br/>
Staten Island, to the Lighthouse Department,<br/>
and talked with the man in charge; perhaps<br/>
I should say that this was really my first act of<br/>
good faith in reference to the lighthouse off the<br/>
bars on the Diamond Shoals.<br/>
<br/>
"The southeastern point on the coast of<br/>
North Carolina forms Cape Hatteras; ten miles<br/>
at sea is Hatteras Shoals, on which the seas of<br/>
the Atlantic break and on which many known<br/>
and unknown wrecks have occurred. The<br/>
sands in some locations shift at every gale.<br/>
Sweeping round in close contact with the shoals<br/>
runs the Gulf Stream, setting to the northeast,<br/>
laden with storms and squalls and lashed by<br/>
the very hell of the ocean. Here is a narrow<br/>
channel, then, with a dangerous shoal on one<br/>
side and this raging river of the ocean on the<br/>
other. Many south-bound sailing vessels, with<br/>
the prevailing westerly wind, are forced into<br/>
and caught by the Gulf Stream in an effort to<br/>
round the Cape to avoid the shoal and are<br/>
swept back and often blown broad off the land,<br/>
perhaps to return in a crippled condition after<br/>
weeks of hardships and suffering, or else<br/>
obliged to abandon a worthless and dangerous<br/>
wreck to be left in the path of vessels-if they<br/>
do not go down with an exhausted and helpless<br/>
crew to the silent bed of the ocean. This<br/>
shoal is situated in the direct course of vessels<br/>
bound for the Southern ports of the United<br/>
States, and is passed by nearly all the southbound vessels from our Northern ports. I<br/>
