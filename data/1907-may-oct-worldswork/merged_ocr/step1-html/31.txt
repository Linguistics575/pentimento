<span>THE LESSON OF THE RECENT WALL<br/>
STREET PANIC<br/>
<br/>
railroads of the United States became<br/>
<br/>
lavish in the payment of dividends.<br/>
The Baltimore & Ohio, the Pennsylvania, the<br/>
Santa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fe</span>, the New York Central, the Union<br/>
Pacific, and many other companies increased<br/>
their rate of dividends.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, half a dozen of the great<br/>
roads issued new stocks. Probably the amount<br/>
of money raised by the companies in this <span style="color: #ff0000;">sixmonth </span>period was more than $ 500,000,000.<br/>
The prices of all the stocks advanced to new<br/>
high records. The country was exceedingly<br/>
prosperous, earnings were very great, and it<br/>
looked as if there were no limit either to the<br/>
general prosperity or to the advances in the<br/>
prices of railroad stocks.<br/>
<br/>
Many thousands of innocent investors all<br/>
over the country were moved to buy these stocks<br/>
at very high prices. Had the money of the<br/>
country not been pretty fully employed in<br/>
industry and in the expansion of business, there<br/>
would undoubtedly have been a period of public<br/>
purchases of stock unparalleled in our history.<br/>
As it was, much stock was <span style="color: #ff0000;">bought </span>by the public,<br/>
but nothing like the amount that would have<br/>
been so bought under slightly different conditions. In making their great new stock<br/>
issues and in raising their dividends to new<br/>
high levels, the financiers counted that the<br/>
enthusiasm worked up in Wall Street by these<br/>
methods would spread over the country, and<br/>
that the public would come in and buy the<br/>
stocks, which the financiers held in perhaps<br/>
the greatest volume in ten years.<br/>
<br/>
But, as early as last December, it came to<br/>
be recognized by a few financiers that the<br/>
public was not coming in. At the same time,<br/>
it began to be generally known that the Federal<br/>
Government and the legislatures of many<br/>
states had taken a stand with regard to the<br/>
railroads which threatened harm to existing<br/>
methods. President Roosevelt made no secret<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of the fact that he intended to see to it that the<br/>
existing Federal laws were obeyed by the<br/>
railroads, no matter who was hurt by such<br/>
obedience<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The state legislators framed laws<br/>
<br/>
IN THE last six months of 1906, the<br/>
<br/>
against the railroads in great abundance. Before the end of the sessions, thirty-eight states<br/>
had passed laws that either enforced a two-cent<br/>
passenger rate or in other ways sought to limit<br/>
the power or the wealth of the roads.<br/>
<br/>
Running alongside this ominous condition,<br/>
there was a scarcity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">money</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">United<br/>
</span>States was calling for more and more money<br/>
to carry on its ordinary business. At a time<br/>
when all the manufacturing companies are<br/>
expanding and when their books are full of<br/>
orders, much more money is needed by them<br/>
for working capital than at a time when their<br/>
business is dull. Also, the nation is rich.<br/>
Men who were wont to regard a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ten-dollar </span>bill<br/>
in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">pockets'as </span>sufficient daily security<br/>
against want, came to carry around with them<br/>
twenty or forty dollars. At the same time,<br/>
the Wall Street financiers were determined to<br/>
have in Wall Street a great booming market.<br/>
That, of itself, takes many hundreds of millions<br/>
of money. All these things combined brought<br/>
it about that the credit of the banking world<br/>
was strained to the limit. It was imperative<br/>
that either the prosperity of the country or<br/>
the Wall Street boom be brought to a sudden<br/>
stop.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the legislation against the railroads<br/>
and the Federal courage in attack provided<br/>
the final push that sent the Wall Street inverted<br/>
pyramid tumbling over the verge. Very probably they did. At any rate, the month of<br/>
March, 1907, saw the most spectacular collapse<br/>
in Wall Street that has been seen in many<br/>
a year.<br/>
<br/>
THE SUDDEN COLLAPSE<br/>
<br/>
It came like a thunderbolt. In one day the<br/>
value of the Union Pacific common stock<br/>
dropped nearly $ 40,000,000. Similar collapses<br/>
occurred in Reading stock, Amalgamated<br/>
Copper, and many other stocks that belong in<br/>
the class which Wall Street calls "active."<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hat </span>means that they are the stocks that are<br/>
traded in largely at <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>times and that make up<br/>
the bulk of the market. In two days, the value<br/>
of all the stocks traded in on Wall Street<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
