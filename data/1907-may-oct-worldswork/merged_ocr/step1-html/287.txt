</span>an awakening nation as it gradually develops<br/>
a capacity for self-government-and an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ambr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>tion for self-government out of proportion to<br/>
that capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Eldon, speaking three years ago, expressed<br/>
a fear that the national character was not<br/>
developing as rapidly as the country itself.<br/>
He was apprehensive that the fruit would be<br/>
rotten before it was ripe. The same feeling<br/>
is shared by many who have studied the<br/>
Egyptian at close range. "Twenty years ago,"<br/>
remarked one well acquainted with the native<br/>
character, "I thought that it would have been<br/>
sufficient to educate them. I was wrong; it<br/>
is their entire character which must be altered."<br/>
<br/>
To a lesser degree, the Egyptians themselves<br/>
feel this. M. de Guerville, whose recent book<br/>
on Egypt is one of the best, says that the<br/>
Khedive not only feels his dependence upon<br/>
England but prefers its guidance to that of<br/>

<br/>
</span>any other Power. Shortly before Cromer's<br/>
resignation, the question of the future was put<br/>
direct to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minister </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Interior, Moustapha<br/>
Fehmy Pasha. This was his reply:<br/>
<br/>
"You ask me if Egypt will one day be able<br/>
to do without England? That is a delicate<br/>
question, and one which time alone will answer.<br/>
But this much I can say, that at the present<br/>
moment we cannot do without her. The point<br/>
has not yet been reached when Egypt can be<br/>
left to its own resources."<br/>
<br/>
And so, under favorable conditions, Sir<br/>
Eldon comes to his great task-the execution<br/>
of a policy that has stood the severe test of<br/>
twenty-five years, that has the confidence and<br/>
support of the home Government, and that has<br/>
the approbation of the leaders of the subject<br/>
country. It is the general belief that the reins<br/>
of government have fallen into strong and<br/>
capable hands. The men picked by Lord<br/>
Cromer do not fail.<br/>

</span>THE PROJECT OF CAPTAIN EELLS TO MAKE AMERICAN WATERS SAFER<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HE </span>extreme point of the long, low <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand<br/>
</span>banks that lie along the eastern coast of<br/>
<br/>
North Carolina is Cape Hatteras. For<br/>
many miles on either side, there is not an harbor<br/>
in which a passing vessel may seek safety from<br/>
the frequent and furious storms of this coast.<br/>
Although there is comparatively little coastwise <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>past the Cape, it has exacted on<br/>
the average a toll of one vessel every three<br/>
months for the last thirty years. There are<br/>
life-saving stations every five miles along the<br/>
sand-banks, and a lightship is anchored over<br/>
the shifting sands of the Diamond Shoals outside the Cape; yet, in spite of these, millions<br/>
of dollars' worth of property and many lives<br/>
have been lost.<br/>
<br/>
Two attempts to build lighthouses have<br/>
failed. In 1905, Congress authorized Captain<br/>
A. F. Eells to make another attempt, guaranteeing a payment of $ 750,000 for the light after<br/>
it has stood <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years. If it proves a failure,<br/>
Captain Eells and his associates stand the loss.<br/>
In reply to a letter of the Department of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Corn</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meree </span>and Labor, seeming to doubt his good<br/>
faith in the project, Captain Eells wrote to<br/>
Secretary Straus the whole history of his plan.<br/>
"More than twelve years ago," the letter<br/>
said, "on one winter's afternoon, I received<br/>
a telegram from Orleans stating'Your schooner,<br/>
the J. R. Eells, is ashore at Nauset, Mass.<br/>
Crew not saved.' The schooner had run<br/>
ashore on account of having lost her sails in a<br/>
heavy snowstorm and gale, she having no mark<br/>
to run for to <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the channel leading to the<br/>
Nantucket Shoals at Pollock Rip, Mass.; it<br/>
being a thick snow-storm, the captain-rather<br/>
than take his chances in running down to the<br/>
entrance to the Shoals-ran the vessel on the<br/>
beach in the morning, the only lightship at<br/>
that time being placed within the shoals. After<br/>
the vessel struck, attempts were made by the<br/>
life-saving crew to launch a boat, but failed.<br/>
They shot the gun off with ball and line which<br/>
passed over the wreck; but, on account of one<br/>
man being frozen in the rigging and the captain having slipped down to the cap of the<br/>
