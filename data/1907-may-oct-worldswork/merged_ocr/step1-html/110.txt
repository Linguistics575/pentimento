THE CULEX AND THE ANOPHELES MOSQUITOS<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">How </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>distinguish malaria from ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosquitos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>resting<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">attitudes<br/>
<br/>
</span>eye of the microscope and watch the pupa<br/>
through his two days' preparation, you will see<br/>
quickly forming within his transparent shell<br/>
the outlines of a mosquito. His long legs,<br/>
soft and rubber-like, are coiled in the bottom<br/>
of his bulging chest like an <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cean </span>cable in the<br/>
bottom of a ship; his eyes peer out from his<br/>
mosquito head through the transparent <span style="color: #0000FF;">visor<br/>
</span>of his mail; his wings are <span style="color: #0000FF;">furled </span>neatly along<br/>
the body in the segmented tail-piece; his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">antenna </span>are tucked like a bib about his throat.<br/>
<br/>
And now, when his natal hour has come, you<br/>
will observe that he lies just against the surface<br/>
of the water-a little globule of air enclosed in<br/>
his forehead serving to bring this submarine<br/>
just to the surface; you will see his shell suddenly split open along the back, just as many<br/>
a boy has seen occur in a locust as it clings to<br/>
the trunk of a tree. You will next observe<br/>
<br/>
his shoulders slowly rise through this crack in<br/>
his shell up into the air, then his head, <span style="color: #0000FF;">antennae<br/>
</span>and forelegs.<br/>
<br/>
He <span style="color: #0000FF;">straight.ens </span>out his soft wet<br/>

<br/>
legs and plants his feet upon the water surface.<br/>
He lifts his body, wings, and remaining legs<br/>
free from his childhood shell and, having little<br/>
air cups in the hollows of his feet, he finds <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span>able to stand upon the water. Then he<br/>
unfolds his wings and dries them, straightens<br/>
and loosens his <span style="color: #0000FF;">antennae</span>, takes a brief glance<br/>
at his new surroundings, then flies into the air<br/>
and begins to sing. In leaving his shell, if<br/>
his hatching is normal, he will not touch the<br/>
water except with the soles of his feet; but if<br/>
a ripple blows his way, or he loses his balance<br/>
and falls upon his side, he is unable to<br/>
lift himself free from the water, and quickly<br/>
drowns. His pupa shell, from which he has<br/>
just escaped, will float like any other deserted<br/>
boat, until it softens and sinks.<br/>
<br/>
The appearance and careers of male and<br/>
female mosquitoes are strikingly distinct.<br/>
The male <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Joe </span>distinguished with the naked<br/>
eye by his bushy, plume-like antennae, the<br/>
female having straight, bare "feelers." The<br/>
male does not bite us; the female does, when<br/>
impregnated. The first-and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jast-object </span>of<br/>
the newborn male is to find a mate. According<br/>
to Russell, he makes marvelous use of his<br/>
whiskered antennae in finding a mate. Born<br/>
after dark, as many of them are, he must discover her solely by her song. His antennae<br/>
seem sensitive to musical waves, and when he<br/>
hears in the surrounding darkness her <span style="color: #0000FF;">monotonous </span>melody, he slowly revolves as on a pivot<br/>
until he "feels" through his antennae the sound<br/>
waves equally with both of them, when he<br/>
knows that the object of his desire is straight<br/>
ahead. We wonder if the inventor of the<br/>
