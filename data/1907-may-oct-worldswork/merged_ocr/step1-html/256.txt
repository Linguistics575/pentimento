ma" be. It is not the quantity of "printed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stuff </span>that shapes public opinion, nor is <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sucn </span>information or argument as the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">news</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">firms</span>" <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the "news-syndicates" and the<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">economists</span>" and such-like persons grind out.<br/>
The experience of the railroad companies<br/>
proved that. They spent hundreds of thousands<br/>
of dollars to keep broken-down editors and<br/>
"experts" in most <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluent </span>activity; but public<br/>
opinion shaped itself without apparent reference to what they wrote.<br/>
<br/>
The writing that counts in the shaping of<br/>
public opinion is the writing that is sincere,<br/>
that has the ring of a personal conviction, that<br/>
shows the accuracy of honest work, that is<br/>
done by men whose only aim and whose<br/>
obvious aim is to tell the truth, and that is<br/>
published in journals which receive their income only from the public-from their readers<br/>
and from their legitimate and clearly designated<br/>
advertisers. The ready-made, tainted "syndicates" and writers and the periodicals that<br/>
use their matter have slight effect on public<br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The most serious inquiry suggested by the<br/>
whole matter is <span style="color: #0000FF;">this-Es </span>any corporation in<br/>
which you are interested wasting your money<br/>
in maintaining this imbecile sort of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">publicity</span>"? If it is, you ought to call its managers<br/>
to task; for this method is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>best method<br/>
that could be hit upon of bringing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">corporation </span>under suspicion. If it needs paid writers<br/>
and publicity men, is there not something<br/>
wrong? something that requires explanation?<br/>
It is surely true that those corporations that<br/>
maintain "publicity bureaus," from which<br/>
much reading matter comes, thereby arouse<br/>
the suspicion of independent journals; for<br/>
no independent periodical will ever publish<br/>
any article written by a paid publicity agent of<br/>
any corporation.<br/>

HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING<br/>
<br/>
HE average American of our day lives<br/>
<br/>
better than his parents lived. He enjoys<br/>
more luxuries, can spend far more money,<br/>
is better educated, eats better food, reads<br/>
better current literature and more of it, wears<br/>
better clothes, and in almost every other<br/>
respect has advantages beyond the advantages<br/>
of his forefathers.<br/>
<br/>
In wealth, the average American of <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day<br/>
</span>possesses nearly four-fifths as much again as<br/>
did the average American of 1880. He carries<br/>
in his pocket, or at any rate keeps in circula<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
tion, about 70 per cent. more money. In the<br/>
banks, he has more than three times as much<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a wonderful thing, therefore, that<br/>
the life of the citizen of to-day should be much<br/>
more civilized, if one may use the term, than<br/>
the life of the citizen of yesterday. For,<br/>
strange as it may seem to the mind of the man<br/>
who sees but the darker side of our national<br/>
life, the real necessities of life cost little if<br/>
any more <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>than they cost <span style="color: #ff0000;">twenby-seven<br/>
</span>years ago. The statistics that cover the<br/>
cost of all food, clothing, metals, and other<br/>
factors that enter into the daily living expense,<br/>
show that the average cost at the first of the<br/>
year was represented by the figure 107.264,<br/>
while in 1880 it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">108.655</span>. It is true that<br/>
in 1897 it dropped to <span style="color: #0000FF;">72145. </span>but that was in a<br/>
period of disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently the average citizen has money<br/>
to spend for luxuries. He spends it well.<br/>
Perhaps the history of higher education in the<br/>
country during the period is as good an index<br/>
as any. In 1880, there were in all the colleges,<br/>
technical schools, and other institutions of a<br/>
higher grade but 38,000 students. In 1906,<br/>
the total had grown to 120,000, of whom about<br/>
27,000 were women. In the same period, the<br/>
attendance of children at the public schools<br/>
had doubled. The country has taken a long<br/>
step onward toward the ideal of universal<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
And in the home, comfort has grown. The<br/>
ideals of home life, at least in the matter of<br/>
creature comforts, has steadily grown higher.<br/>
It is difficult to find a perfectly satisfactory<br/>
test for this statement, which rests rather upon<br/>
the facts that one may gain from observation<br/>
than upon scientific data. The average<br/>
American of <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>uses about seventy-six<br/>
pounds of sugar a year as against about fortytwo in 1880. Turning to more practical tests,<br/>
one finds that the rag carpet has been crowded<br/>
out by the machine-made rug; that modern<br/>
plumbing, or at least plumbing of some sort,<br/>
is becoming common, even in the rural communities; that the demand for household help<br/>
has far outstripped the supply, even at prices<br/>
two and three times the prices of 1880.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Today </span>the working man lives in what<br/>
would have been called luxury a quarter of a<br/>
century ago. In New York, in this last year<br/>
or so, he has been the mainstay of a huge<br/>
speculation in city lots at outlying points. In<br/>
many cases, he builds his own little home. In<br/>
