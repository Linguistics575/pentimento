</span>THE FOUNDATIONS OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">PROSPERITY<br/>
<br/>
</span>methods which the corporate world has devel<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>oped and accepted. In the last analysis, therefore, the whole subject of the danger to prosperity comes back to the character of corporate<br/>
conduct and of banking conduct. Such a code<br/>
of corporation morals as the life-insurance<br/>
investigation disclosed and as the railroad <span style="color: #ff0000;">ratelaw </span>and similar laws are meant to correct-so<br/>
long as it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerated-will </span>enable men to use<br/>
other men's money in such a way as to <span style="color: #0000FF;">slacken<br/>
</span>industry when there is no good economic reason for a slackening of it.<br/>
<br/>
A Question <span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Moral</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>at Last<br/>
<br/>
Now we come to the very gist of the present<br/>
situation. We have had a code of morals in<br/>
corporation conduct and in high finance that<br/>
was not honest. So long as we endured that,<br/>
the prosperity of the country could not be safe.<br/>
This fact the public has at last perceived; and<br/>
the public, through various agencies, is now<br/>
trying to correct this evil-to make great corporations responsible for their conduct, to bring<br/>
a new and higher standard of corporation<br/>
morals, to prevent men who control great<br/>
companies from taking unfair advantage of<br/>
the rest of the community and from having a<br/>
disproportionate, or corrupt, proportion of<br/>
power in government and over the liquid<br/>
capital of the community.<br/>
<br/>
The public sentiment of the United States<br/>
is seriously engaged in bringing this change<br/>
about. It demands the same fairness and<br/>
honesty in business done on a large scale as in<br/>
business done on a small scale. It demands<br/>
the same responsibility in the conduct of<br/>
insurance companies and of business in Wall<br/>
Street as it demands in the ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">transactions </span>between individuals; and it is trying<br/>
to find a way to make this righteous determination effective. It is trying to find a way to<br/>
punish corporate <span style="color: #0000FF;">evil-doers </span>as it has found ways<br/>
of punishing individual criminals.<br/>
<br/>
And the purpose and the aim of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">peopleof </span>this public sentiment-is right. It is<br/>
righteous. It will prevail. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrong-doers<br/>
</span>and the quibblers may as well recognize this<br/>
inevitable quality of the public mind. We are<br/>
going to have in this Republic a standard of<br/>
financial and corporate morals that will square<br/>
with the moral sense of the American people<br/>
in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">private </span>conduct; and we are going to<br/>
have it at any cost. It may come at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrific<br/>
</span>financial and industrial cost. It may come<br/>
only through mistaken and even unfair methods,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9387<br/>
<br/>
</span>for an aroused and outraged public opinion is<br/>
not always discriminating. It sometimes takes<br/>
the most costly and even reckless ways to carry<br/>
out its purpose. But it is an invincible thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>a Sudden Public <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mood<br/>
<br/>
</span>This is not a new nor sudden public mood<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>It has been showing itself more and more<br/>
plainly for a number of years. It is a mere cry<br/>
of ignorance to declaim against Mr. Roosevelt;<br/>
for he and his policies are only one of its expressions. The so-called Granger railroad legislation of years ago was one expression of it. The<br/>
creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission, long ineffective except as a bureau<br/>
of information, was another expression of it.<br/>
The national anti-trust law was another. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">anti-trust </span>legislation in many states is another<br/>
expression-much of it an ignorant and unwise<br/>
expression. The life-insurance investigation<br/>
in New York; the growing sentiment in favor of<br/>
experiments in municipal ownership; in fact,<br/>
the strongest tendency in current legislation<br/>
and the most popular party doctrine are<br/>
efforts to bring about the same responsibility<br/>
in the management of corporations as in the<br/>
management of individual business. And, before this public mood passes, attention may be<br/>
given to great banking corporations as well<br/>
as to insurance companies, railroad companies,<br/>
and the like; and it is likely also to demand a<br/>
reduction of the tariff.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to declaim against some of the<br/>
forms that this agitation takes; for example,<br/>
some of the absurd and unjust state laws<br/>
against railroads. But these are only the small<br/>
mistakes of a great and earnest movement;<br/>
and against the movement itself it will do no<br/>
good to cry out<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Rich men and great corporations may have reason to fear. The<br/>
money-kings may withdraw capital from the<br/>
easy currents of productive investment. We<br/>
may have an artificially high rate of interest.<br/>
The stock market may tumble to still lower<br/>
prices. Corporations that have been doing<br/>
business on easily borrowed capital may fail.<br/>
All these events, if they come, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">incidents-perhaps </span>necessary incidents-of an important<br/>
change from one code of morals to another.<br/>
If values shrink, what of it? We may as well<br/>
come to the honest management of corporations<br/>
at once and be done with it<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>There are worse<br/>
things than loss of values in stocks; and one<br/>
worse thing is the creation of artificial values<br/>
and the maintenance of them by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">improper<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
