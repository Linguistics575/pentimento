</span>other cases, he is a partner in a cooperative<br/>
building group, that makes for its people comfortable homes at less cost than they could<br/>
build their several houses. He has learned to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperate </span>in the saving of money. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pennsylvania</span>, with its big classes of skilled labor,<br/>
is the heart and centre of the cooperative<br/>
building and loan business of the United<br/>
States. The laboring man is working out his<br/>
own freedom from the tenement and the slum.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there is misery, as there always<br/>
must be. The point of the situation is that<br/>
the average man, who is compounded of the<br/>
high, the middle, and the low, to-day has money<br/>
to spend. In an age when it is the fashion to<br/>
abuse the trusts, and to accuse them of<br/>
robbing the people of their sustenance, this<br/>
fact alone is of vital interest. Perhaps it is<br/>
even more interesting to note that coal, sugar,<br/>
steel, and railroad transportation to-day cost<br/>
the average man considerably less money than<br/>
they cost him <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>years ago. That is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">one </span>of the principal reasons why he has more<br/>
money to spend on education, art, and creature<br/>
comforts.<br/>
<br/>
LIFTING A SHADOW FROM MILLIONS OF LIVES<br/>
<br/>
HE reception given to the special Southern<br/>
<br/>
number of THE WORLD'S WORK is<br/>
a gratifying indication that this great <span style="color: #0000FF;">undeveloped </span>part of the United States is now at last<br/>
rapidly to be brought under productive activity,<br/>
both by the people who now live there and<br/>
by an increasing immigration. Great wealth<br/>
is already every year got from Southern soil<br/>
and mines and forests and factories, but its<br/>
production is yet only a promise of a greater<br/>
yield.<br/>
<br/>
There is one kind of opportunity there that<br/>
makes an especially strong appeal-an appeal<br/>
that goes deeper than the usual economic<br/>
chance and that has a profound social <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance</span>. There is a shadow that begins in<br/>
middle life to darken every man's way who<br/>
has only a small income; and this class includes most of the population. First, how<br/>
may he give his children a fair chance? Then<br/>
how may he provide for his own unproductive<br/>
years and for his wife in her old age? This<br/>
thought clouds all good men's happiness till<br/>
they solve it. In the uncertain fortunes of<br/>
industrial life in cities, it is hard to solve.<br/>
Shifting engagements and shifting values, the<br/>
increasing expense of living, the ever-changing<br/>
organization of industry make security seem<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9055<br/>
<br/>
</span>less and less certain except to the few that<br/>
are either unusually fortunate or strong.<br/>
<br/>
The opening of the West answered this<br/>
question to millions of men a generation or<br/>
two ago; and the Homestead Act added to<br/>
human happiness <span style="color: #ff0000;">inealculably</span>. A quarter<br/>
section of good land meant security. Good<br/>
land cannot be had in the South quite so<br/>
cheap as it was got in the West; but it can be<br/>
had by any capable man who is able to <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit<br/>
</span>by it. And the enormously increased attractiveness of agricultural life will for another<br/>
generation or two remove this great shadow<br/>
from other millions of lives. A truck farm<br/>
or a cotton farm means a competence to the<br/>
industrious man and to his children. To<br/>
estimate the value to American character and<br/>
American development of these sunlit fields<br/>
during the next half century or more would<br/>
tax the imagination of the boldest economist.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>HARDEST TASK <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>CIVILIZATION<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>FIND out how to prevent want-that<br/>
<br/>
is, doubtless, the gravest problem of<br/>
civilization; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>advocates of every sort of<br/>
social or economic change have their theories.<br/>
Experiments, some hopeful but most of them<br/>
merely alleviating at best, go on all the while.<br/>
We have reduced charity to a sort of science.<br/>
But the underworld remains with us, pitiful,<br/>
threatening, ever perpetuating itself.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">world-old </span>problem is not likely to be<br/>
solved soon nor by any single force that is now<br/>
at work. But, if civilization is ever to become<br/>
worthy of its name and pretentions, it must be<br/>
solved some time; and every well-directed effort<br/>
ought to be hailed with encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
The Sage foundation of ten millions of dollars for the betterment of the poor-for finding<br/>
out, first of all, how life on lower levels can be<br/>
permanently <span style="color: #0000FF;">bettered</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>such an effort; and<br/>
it is in the hands of wise and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unselfish </span>men.<br/>
Mr. John M. Glenn is the executive <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer </span>of<br/>
the foundation; and no man living has in more<br/>
earnest measure the good wishes of all good<br/>
people than he. It is a wise use of a great sum<br/>
of money and a noble use of one's life to<br/>
attack this central grave task of civilization<br/>
in a sympathetic and scientific way.<br/>
