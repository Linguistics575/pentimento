Nor is this all. During the summer vacation,<br/>
the city (at public expense) sends the poor<br/>
children on excursions to the country, to the<br/>
seaside, or even to Switzerland, the outing<br/>
varying from a few days to a month, according<br/>
to the physical condition of the children. In<br/>
the Council's opinion, the way to have healthy,<br/>
wholesome, and vigorous men and women is to<br/>
have healthy, wholesome, and vigorous boys and<br/>
girls. It believes in the "ounce of prevention."<br/>
<br/>
PROVIDING HOMES FOR THE POOR<br/>
<br/>
"Housing" is a burning subject in Paris,<br/>
for the city grows <span style="color: #0000FF;">apace </span>and, as always happens,<br/>
the tendency of its growth is to constrict the<br/>
poorer quarters. The problem of <span style="color: #0000FF;">overcrowding<br/>
</span>is not wholly solved to this day; compared with<br/>
London and some other cities, however, few<br/>
families in Paris are crowded. But the Council<br/>
wants better conditions. Two years ago it<br/>
appointed a commission to investigate and report upon the whole subject of the dwellings of<br/>
the poor. The commission, disregarding the<br/>
convenient fence of comparison behind which<br/>
distressed <span style="color: #0000FF;">municipal </span>bodies habitually take<br/>
refuge, declined to say that Paris was not as<br/>
bad as it might be, but declared unequivocally<br/>
that even the crowding that exists in Paris is a<br/>
hot-house for disease, drunkenness, and prostitution. It discussed in its report many things<br/>
that might be done, and then declared that<br/>
the city should build houses and offer them for<br/>
rent, giving preference to the largest and poorest<br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
But there was the Senate! The Council<br/>
had found by this time how helpless was the<br/>
task of breaking a way through that august<br/>
convocation of grave and reverend <span style="color: #0000FF;">antediluvians</span>; and while it waited for Providence to<br/>
cease to afflict France with a Senate, it turned<br/>
to remedies within its grasp. One was to<br/>
encourage building societies. These, operating<br/>
always under the approval of the Minister of<br/>
Labor, can borrow money from the government<br/>
savings banks at 3 per cent. These societies<br/>
must build sanitary houses, subject to the<br/>
approval of official committees. In Paris the<br/>
annual rent of their houses must not exceed<br/>
$ 110; in small towns the rent is often as little<br/>
as $ 28. All of these societies are under the<br/>
Government's control. About forty of them<br/>
exist in and about Paris. The state will not<br/>
allow them to pay more than 4 per cent. in<br/>
annual dividends to their shareholders. They<br/>
are filling some of the suburbs with tasteful,<br/>
<br/>
THE HUMANITARIAN<br/>
<br/>
RULE IN PARIS<br/>
airy, and sanitary dwellings, subject to purchase<br/>
on reasonable and easy terms by the tenants.<br/>
<br/>
Observant visitors to Paris must have noticed<br/>
how comparatively free are its streets from<br/>
idlers, tramps, and outcasts. You do not hear<br/>
of Parisian processions of the unemployed,<br/>
nor of an ever-increasing menace from regions<br/>
corresponding to Stepney and Whitechapel,<br/>
in London. One reason is that the municipality is determined that, so far as possible, every<br/>
man in the city shall work and that no person<br/>
shall be shelterless. There is a peculiar kind<br/>
of municipal establishment, part workhouse<br/>
and part refuge, that has this task in hand.<br/>
It exists in fair numbers throughout the city<br/>
under the direction of a city bureau. Any<br/>
man out of work can apply in the daytime at<br/>
one of these institutions and receive a ticket<br/>
entitling him to food and lodging for the night.<br/>
If he finds work he does not, in most cases,<br/>
return to the refuge; but, in any event, he is<br/>
sure of shelter and food. If his hunt for work<br/>
is fruitless, he comes back with his ticket, gets<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>bath, has his clothes steamed and pressed,<br/>
eats a supper of bread and soup, and sleeps in<br/>
a separate bed for which <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>cubic feet of air<br/>
is allowed-and knows that bed and bedding<br/>
have that day been cleaned and disinfected. In<br/>
the morning he arises at six o'clock, has a<br/>
breakfast of bread and soup, and is free to<br/>
depart to look for work. Or, if he prefers, he<br/>
can labor in the workhouse that is part of the<br/>
refuge. The Municipal Council encourages<br/>
these workhouses and helps to keep them busy.<br/>
For instance, all the firewood used by the city<br/>
is prepared at these places.<br/>
<br/>
Similar institutions exist for women. Besides a night refuge or lodging-house these have<br/>
an industrial refuge for unemployed <span style="color: #ff0000;">workingwomen</span>, a home for expectant mothers, an<br/>
asylum for <span style="color: #0000FF;">convalescent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>after childbirth, a<br/>
temporary asylum for children, an asylum for<br/>
orphan girls. Some of these enterprises seem<br/>
to express an unusually broad spirit of charity.<br/>
For instance, at the industrial refuge for women<br/>
out of work, a woman is received with her<br/>
children and, in extreme cases, maintained<br/>
there for four days while she searches for a<br/>
situation. At the end of that time, if she should<br/>
not find anything to do, she is employed as a<br/>
seamstress at another city establishment.<br/>
Meantime, her children are not taken from her<br/>
but are educated at a school under the same<br/>
roof. In the children's asylum the babies<br/>
are cared for in a creche; children from one to<br/>
<br/>
