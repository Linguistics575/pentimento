</span>in our history. In 1905, the million mark was<br/>
passed and the prophets themselves stood<br/>
amazed. And during the past year the <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span>has shot upward until already a big start<br/>
has been made toward the two-million goal,<br/>
with every indication that the present year<br/>
will carry us at least a quarter of the remaining<br/>
distance to it. Recurring to his wave line,<br/>
one will find the 1906 influx of aliens towering<br/>
like a Himalaya in the midst of humble foot<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>hills. But it, in turn, promises to be dwarfed<br/>
within a twelvemonth.<br/>
<br/>
THE INCREASE OF A SINGLE YEAR<br/>
<br/>
It is not easy to conceive what our <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigration </span>has really come to be. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures<br/>
</span>are too stupendous to be grasped by the mind.<br/>
Let one who has sat in the magnificent Stadium<br/>
at Cambridge, as one of 40,000 spectators at<br/>
a Harvard-Vale football game, reflect that if<br/>
the immigrants entering our ports during the<br/>
fiscal year 1906 were brought together, they<br/>
would make a throng <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>and a half<br/>
times as large as that which crowds every<br/>
available foot of space around the great oval.<br/>
Let him consider that the number <span style="color: #0000FF;">admitted<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">POLISH<br/>
<br/>
</span>BULGARIAN<br/>
<br/>
in this twelvemonth from Norway and<br/>
Sweden alone would more than fill the Stadium;<br/>
that the number from Germany would do the<br/>
same; that the influx from Great Britain<br/>
would fill it two and a half times. That from<br/>
Russia would fill it more than five times;<br/>
that from Austria-Hungary would fill it more<br/>
than six times; and the contributions from<br/>
Italy would do it seven times, with people<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">spare </span>Let him further call to mind that,<br/>
on the average, the Stadium could be packed<br/>
with the aliens who are landed at Ellis Island,<br/>
New York, every seventeen days throughout<br/>
the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">year-indeed</span>, with those who are<br/>
landed in less than a week at certain <span style="color: #ff0000;">busier<br/>
</span>portions of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Then let him consider that the total number<br/>
of immigrants admitted in 1906 would nearly<br/>
serve to populate either the city of Philadelphia,<br/>
or the cities of Boston and Baltimore combined; that, in fact, it would people all Maryland, or all Nebraska, or the whole region<br/>
occupied by Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,<br/>
Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. These six<br/>
states and territories have an aggregate area<br/>
of 649,320 square miles, which is nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">18<br/>
