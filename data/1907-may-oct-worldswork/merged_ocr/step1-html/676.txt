</span>rear, the roofs and walls will thus gradually <span style="color: #0000FF;">de</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>crease in height to the low one-story buildings at<br/>
the front <span style="color: #0000FF;">corners</span>. Inside will be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious<br/>
<br/>
</span>A UNIVERSITY PUEBLO<br/>
<br/>
placita. The highest part of each pueblo will<br/>
be about seventy feet. Each pueblo will measure about a thousand feet around the outer<br/>
walls. Small porticoes <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the roofs, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">massive </span>outside buttresses, and other features of<br/>
construction will complete the semi-pyramidal<br/>
effect which characterized the ancient villages.<br/>
<br/>
One each side of the avenue which will separate the two pueblos is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen-foot </span>sidewalk,<br/>
bordered on the inside by weeping willows and<br/>
on the outside by quick-growing <span style="color: #0000FF;">cottonwoods<br/>
<br/>
</span>used temporarily for effect, shade, and ornament, pending the growing of elms and other<br/>
hardwood trees, hundreds of which have already<br/>
been started in the nursery on the great campus.<br/>
<br/>
That the effect of the whole architectural<br/>
scheme will be extremely beautiful and stately<br/>
is now evident from the appearance of the completed dormitories, the central heating plant,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">president</span>'s residence, all built in the old<br/>
Indian style. Art, economy, and durability are<br/>
most effectually combined. A recent feature of<br/>
the campus is an immense sun-dial in front of<br/>
the "Ho-ko-na," the gift of the class of 1907.<br/>
The dial is accurately adjusted and decorated<br/>
with inscriptions and symbols.<br/>
<br/>
One of the pueblos will be used exclusively<br/>
for women students and the other for men; they<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>meet a very pressing need for increased<br/>
accommodation as the number of students<br/>
increases. The old buildings were wholly<br/>
inadequate<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
