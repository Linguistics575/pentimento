<br/>
securities which could be turned into immediate<br/>
cash was the thing that he most prized.<br/>
<br/>
The New York merchant told the story to his<br/>
partners and suggested that they put aside from<br/>
the business an amount equal to <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>per cent. of<br/>
the pay-roll each week and invest it in <span style="color: #0000FF;">firstclass </span>securities.<br/>
<br/>
Said one partner: "Why tie up in securities<br/>
yielding, say, 5 per cent., money which if <span style="color: #0000FF;">employed </span>in our active business will yield 20 or 30<br/>
per cent.?"<br/>
<br/>
The answer came quickly: "Why pay <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurance </span>when the money thus spent would yield<br/>
more gain in trading? There should be a<br/>
financial insurance begun and carried on in<br/>
good times to guard against sudden emergencies.<br/>
Most men of long experience have walked the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>in times of tight money. Many men have<br/>
done it every week when the pay-roll hung over<br/>
a depleted bank-account. Having passed<br/>
through this experience <span style="color: #0000FF;">once</span>, few men like to<br/>
contemplate a second term of similar trials.<br/>
<br/>
"Beside, walking the floor kills initiative and<br/>
power in every other direction. The Chicago<br/>
man's plan draws the kind of sharp distinction<br/>
between brick <span style="color: #0000FF;">and.mortar </span>assets and marketable securities that we need to think about now<br/>
and then. In a young business, any sort of<br/>
asset must answer; as a business grows older,<br/>
it is worth while to protect its improved condition and to have at least enough of the marketable kind of assets to help through a tight place.<br/>
<br/>
"Another valuable feature of the plan is that<br/>
it leads to saving instead of spending, a virtue<br/>
as valuable for a business house as for an individual."<br/>
<br/>
Said another partner: "But this money<br/>
might be used in enlarging the output of the<br/>
house."<br/>
<br/>
Replied the first: "To which I answer that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>per cent. of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pay-roll-or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>per cent., or<br/>
2 per cent., if you like-invested in securities<br/>
will not seriously retard the development of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">firm</span>; if a house crowds in its earnings as fast as<br/>
that, it needs this reserve all the more. It needs<br/>
to check a headlong <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of business frenzy."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>But suppose the bonds go down?"<br/>
<br/>
"Suppose they do? They are locked in your<br/>
safe; they pay their <span style="color: #0000FF;">interest-all </span>pure profit.<br/>
We need not worry. There is only one sure<br/>
way to make money in Wall Street: never sell<br/>
at a loss. If worst comes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">worst-and </span>probably worst won't come to worst-this very habit<br/>
leads to caution; the bonds can be borrowed on<br/>
when credit is strained<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>"<br/>
<br/>
WHY NOT BUSINESS INSURANCE?<br/>
<br/>
The things here related happened about five<br/>
years ago. In the case of the New York man,<br/>
there was an interesting sequel.<br/>
<br/>
The firm prospered as most firms have done<br/>
in the last five years. The money was regularly<br/>
sent to the brokers in weekly instalments. Most<br/>
of the bonds purchased were in from $ 3,000 to<br/>
$ 5,000 lots, but paid for at the rate of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">200<br/>
</span>a week. In all cases, high-class securities were<br/>
chosen. When one lot was paid for, it was<br/>
turned over to the firm, registered, and locked<br/>
up, and payment on a new lot begun. In the<br/>
five years the prices of bonds varied not very<br/>
greatly. Occasionally the banker advised the<br/>
change of one security for another, but this was<br/>
always done at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit</span>. The New York man<br/>
remembered Baron Rothschild's reply to the<br/>
question, How did you make your fortune?<br/>
"By never buying at the bottom or selling at the<br/>
top."<br/>
<br/>
The statements of the firm in which these<br/>
securities were listed as part of its assets always<br/>
attracted the favorable and somewhat surprised<br/>
attention of the banks where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firm </span>kept its<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
In the last summer (of this year), this New<br/>
York house needed for a proper business opportunity a larger line of discount than usual, <span style="color: #0000FF;">exactly </span>at the time when banks looked askance at<br/>
any increase of accommodation, no matter how<br/>
good the borrower. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">competitor</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in<br/>
getting ready money had given the opportunity<br/>
of which the house wished to avail itself.<br/>
<br/>
The bank president was, with many apologies<br/>
and explanations, disposed to decline to extend<br/>
the line of discount.<br/>
<br/>
"Very well," said the merchant, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pll </span>go to<br/>
my brokers and borrow on my <span style="color: #ff0000;">bonds</span>; if I can't<br/>
rely on you for money when I most need it, I<br/>
must get it elsewhere."<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the bank president didn't let him<br/>
go to the broker; there is too great a demand<br/>
for good accounts in these days of competition.<br/>
<br/>
From the banker's point of view, the plan has<br/>
many advantages. Not only is an additional<br/>
safeguard thrown about his risk, but any class<br/>
of good investment security which shall be<br/>
taken out of Wall Street and locked up in the<br/>
safes of conservative business men makes for<br/>
stability and strength.<br/>
<br/>
The man from New York has <span style="color: #ff0000;">never</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eased </span>to<br/>
thank his Chicago friend for starting the business insurance idea in his mind, and this story<br/>
is written in the hope that its telling may suggest to other business men to go and do likewise,<br/>
<br/>
