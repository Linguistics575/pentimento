<span>A NEW KIND OF INSURANCE<br/>
<br/>
HOW ONE COMPANY INSURES ITS MEN AGAINST ACCIDENTS<br/>

<br/>
</span>back on when wages stop and <span style="color: #ff0000;">expenses<br/>
<br/>
</span>double. The only sort of insurance<br/>
that most of them know is industrial insurance,<br/>
the most expensive in the world, and they<br/>
have to die to be benefited by it! True, they<br/>
find, often to their cost, that the employer<br/>
knows <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>kind of insurance; but only<br/>
in the case where he has been guilty of negligence do the men profit by it. The negligence<br/>
may have been that of a fellow servant; there<br/>
is no recovery. Even if the man has been<br/>
negligent himself, that does not make his suffering or that of those dependent on him the less<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In any case, the employer seldom figures except as he is forced to do so. That is why it is<br/>
interesting to note what one large corporation<br/>
is doing for its employees that are injured,<br/>
in order to help them over this period of storm<br/>
and stress.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat more than a year ago, the largest<br/>
power generating plant in New York began<br/>
the experiment of dealing with the men who<br/>
are injured in their employ-not according to<br/>
the legal liability incurred but according to the<br/>
moral liability.<br/>
<br/>
Among its 3,800 men, with a pay-roll of about<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500,000</span>, there were, in the calendar year of<br/>
1906, 751 accidents; and the company cared for<br/>
every one of them at a cost, in wages paid, of<br/>
$ 13,056.82. Of these 751 cases, 459 were<br/>
accidents of such a nature as to lay up the<br/>
victims, resulting in the payment of wages<br/>
full time until the men returned to work, to the<br/>
equivalent of 1,223 weeks' wages. These<br/>
cases included men injured by their own, their<br/>
fellow servants,' and the company's negligence. In 84 more cases where the company<br/>
had absolutely no liability and the men had<br/>
been grossly careless, <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-time </span>was paid.<br/>
<br/>
The men received far more than they<br/>
would have received under the system of<br/>
liability insurance, for, by the most liberal<br/>
construction, in only <span style="color: #0000FF;">51 </span>cases was the com<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">BY<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">REEVE<br/>
<br/>
</span>pany legally liable. In 613 cases, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">employees </span>themselves were clearly at fault, and<br/>
in 87 cases it was clearly the act of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowservant</span>. That is to say, the cost of some<br/>
700 accidents was accepted by the corporation,<br/>
which, according to strict legal rules, need not<br/>
have been accepted.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how it turned out: During the year<br/>
from May <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, 1905, to May <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, 1906, the premium<br/>
that the company would have paid for liability<br/>
insurance would have been $ 21,396.19. Of<br/>
this, the sum that <span style="color: #ff0000;">would</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">have </span>been returned<br/>
by the insurance company for allowance of<br/>
expenditures for "first aid" would have been<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">38</span>. That is, there would have been paid<br/>
$ 19,858.19. But, instead, the company assumed the handling of its accidents itself,<br/>
with the cost in doctors' bills of $ 6,297, and in<br/>
druggists' bills of $ 1,122.17, paying the wages<br/>
of the men while they were disabled to the<br/>
amount in that fiscal year of <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ho,8ir.33-a<br/>
</span>total of, $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">18,270</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So</span>. That is to say, the cash<br/>
saving was $ 1,587.69.<br/>
<br/>
One of the officers Was asked why they had<br/>
given up settling along the line of strict legal<br/>
liability. "This business is one that calls<br/>
for extreme fidelity on the part of the men," he<br/>
said, "in many emergencies, for instance, there<br/>
is real risk. The moving machinery and the<br/>
electrical feature make the occupation hazardous. The employee must feel that his welfare<br/>
is assured or he might falter at the critical<br/>
moment. This may not be the cheapest way<br/>
to settle, though it seems to have been so far.<br/>
That will take five or six years' experience to<br/>
determine. But it gives us a free hand to deal<br/>
justly with our employees so that they will<br/>
know that they are going to be taken care of<br/>
if anything happens to them. We can treat<br/>
each case upon its merits and not according<br/>
to legal necessity. Even if it does turn out to<br/>
cost more than the legal liability would, it<br/>
will pay, we think, in increased efficiency of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mem</span>"<br/>
