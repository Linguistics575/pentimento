<br/>
A NEW SCHOOL OF HISTORIANS<br/>
<br/>
Most notable has been the work done in<br/>
historical writing. That the American Historical Association should have met in New<br/>
Orleans in 1904, that four of the American<br/>
Nation series should be written by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southerners</span>, and that a score or more of specialists<br/>
in history are now, either in leading <span style="color: #0000FF;">universities </span>or in their own colleges in the South,<br/>
<br/>
pursuing definite lines of historical research,<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>As a result'<br/>
<br/>
are matters of prime importance.<br/>
of the excellent work in history at Johns Hopkins<br/>
University inaugurated by the late Herbert B.<br/>
Adams, and the later interest in Southern <span style="color: #0000FF;">history </span>manifested by the departments of history<br/>
at Columbia and Harvard, there has come a<br/>
change in the point of view and in the style of<br/>
Southern historians. In spite of excessive<br/>
hours of teaching and of meagre libraries for<br/>
research <span style="color: #0000FF;">work</span>, and in spite of a constant demand on the part of many Southerners that<br/>
history should be written to substantiate previously formed opinions, Southern scholars<br/>
have made rapid progress in the study and<br/>
interpretation of Southern life and history<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Much of the work up <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>time has been in<br/>
the form of monographs, which are often lacking<br/>
in literary charm and in philosophical grasp;<br/>
but such foundation work has been absolutely<br/>
necessary. Such writings as Houston's<br/>
"Nullification in South Carolina," Garner's<br/>
"Reconstruction in Mississippi," Bruce's<br/>
"The Plantation Negro as a Freeman,"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fleming</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>"Civil War and Reconstruction in<br/>
Alabama," and the volumes in the American<br/>
Nation series already referred to, take rank<br/>
with the best work of the kind done by American <span style="color: #0000FF;">scholars</span>. The works on a larger scale<br/>
by McCrady, Hannis Taylor, and Woodrow<br/>
Wilson show how far we have come from the<br/>
work of Pollard, Stephens, and Gayarr√©.<br/>
A singularly impartial study of the causes<br/>
leading to the Civil War is "The Brothers'<br/>
War <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>by Mr. John C. Reed, of Atlanta, who<br/>
has given even the New England abolitionist his<br/>
due. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">William </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Garrott </span>Brown, in his "Lower<br/>
South in American History," and his Atlantic<br/>
Monthly articles on the decade after the Civil<br/>
War, has so combined scholarly research with<br/>
<br/>
THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION<br/>
<br/>
literary charm and philosophical perspective<br/>
as to give promise of being one of the great<br/>
American historians.<br/>
<br/>
Of less historical value, but of more popular<br/>
interest, has been the publication of Southern<br/>
memoirs and letters and reminiscences. General Gordon's "Reminiscences of the Civil<br/>
War" is a distinct advance on earlier books,<br/>
which were often written by Southern generals<br/>
without proper study. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Letters and Recollections of Robert E. Lee," by his son, Capt.<br/>
Robert E. Lee, give better than any previous life<br/>
the story of Lee's last years at Lexington. The<br/>
book reveals Lee as--in spirit and in work--the leader of the New South, as well as the consummate flower of the civilization of the Old<br/>
South. There are scattered throughout the<br/>
letters golden words that should be the inspiration of every forward movement in the<br/>
South to-day, for Lee was with the forces that<br/>
make for progress rather than reaction, for<br/>
constructive effort rather than futile obstruction,<br/>
for nationalism rather than <span style="color: #0000FF;">sectionalism</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We have had a rather noteworthy lot of<br/>
sprightly, entertaining books by Southern<br/>
women who have touched with charm some <span style="color: #ff0000;">outof-the-way </span>nooks and corners of history. If<br/>
they have lacked the scientific point of view of<br/>
the studies already referred to, they are interesting as human documents. Mrs. Avary's<br/>
"A Southern Girl During the War," and<br/>
"Dixie after the War," Mrs. Clay's "A Belle of<br/>
the'Fifties," and Mrs. Pryor's "Reminiscences<br/>
of Peace and War" have conveyed to a large<br/>
number of people the humor, pathos, and<br/>
tragedy of eventful times. Of distinctly better<br/>
quality is John S. Wise's "The End of'an<br/>
Era," which is perhaps the most vivid picture<br/>
of life just before and during the war that has<br/>
yet been written. Chapters in a most interesting autobiography-yet to be completed,<br/>
one may hope---may be found in the files of the<br/>
Forum and the Atlantic Monthly. I refer to<br/>
the sketches by Professor Gildersleeve of his<br/>
early life in Charleston and of his experiences<br/>
as a teacher in the University of Virginia and<br/>
as a member of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gordon</span>'s staff.<br/>
<br/>
ESSAYS AND LITERARY CRITICISM<br/>
<br/>
The fine literary flavor of "Essays and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stud</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ies" by the same author suggests a kind of writing in which the activity has not been so great as<br/>
in the field of historical writing. The South has<br/>
an honorable record in suggesting the lines along<br/>
which the teaching of English has proceeded.<br/>
