owned and managed by Southern men, who<br/>
make the management of mills their business,<br/>
have paid enormously; and they have paid, on<br/>
the average, perhaps twice as large dividends as<br/>
the mills that are owned in New England.<br/>
While outside investors have made and will<br/>
make much money exploiting the South, very<br/>
much more money has been made and will be<br/>
made by local investors in their own home<br/>
enterprises. The peculiarity of the labor<br/>
problem is one good reason why this is true,<br/>
but there are other good reasons as well.<br/>
<br/>
To the men of the South, the present affords<br/>
a time to measure their common sense against<br/>
their patriotism, and find out where they stand<br/>
<br/>
THE ARISEN SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
as investors. A little common sense applied<br/>
to investment will pay larger dividends than a<br/>
whole world of patriotic enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
On the whole, the South is a very promising<br/>
field for the investor, Southern or Northern.<br/>
No one who has watched its growth can doubt<br/>
it. In 1896, the Southern banks had but<br/>
$ 310,499,095 of deposits. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day </span>they have<br/>
over $ r, ooo, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ooo</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ot</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oo </span>of deposits. In the past<br/>
fifteen years the <span style="color: #0000FF;">farm </span>products of the South<br/>
have increased over <span style="color: #ff0000;">12 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>%, the lumber products<br/>
over 175%, the manufactured products over<br/>
90%. The growth is going on to-day, just as<br/>
it was going on five years ago. All indications<br/>
point to its continuance to-morrow, as well.<br/>
<br/>
THE ARiSEN SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
HE presentation of the working South<br/>
<br/>
made in this magazine is not meant to<br/>
be, to any considerable extent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">statistical</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">certainly </span>not <span style="color: #0000FF;">encyclopaedic</span>. It is meant rather<br/>
to show the spirit and the general direction of<br/>
a great movement.<br/>
<br/>
The rate of wealth-creation is published in<br/>
the trade and financial journals and is easily<br/>
accessible, and it is impressive in its great<br/>
totals. Absolutely accurate totals, by the way,<br/>
are hard to get, for the statistics of one set of<br/>
officials differ from those of another; and the<br/>
movement is too swift to be tabulated easily.<br/>
But more important than statistics covering<br/>
so vast a field are these questions:<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">15 </span>the prosperity economically sound?<br/>
It is. The stripping of forests indiscriminately<br/>
involves, of course, an ultimate waste of wealth.<br/>
But all other Southern industries are real<br/>
additions to wealth.<br/>
<br/>
(2) <span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>the prosperity difused<span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>
</span>industrious, productive man share it? Is it<br/>
bringing individual well-being? Yes, to a<br/>
remarkable degree. The individual has a<br/>
greater range of opportunity in the South today than in any other part of the Union.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">May </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">every<br/>
<br/>
</span>ARE THE OLD TRAITS LOST?<br/>
<br/>
OW are the fine old traits of Southern<br/>
character faring in this rush of <span style="color: #ff0000;">moneygetting </span>men? Is leisure, is hospitality, is good<br/>
talk, is the gentle art of idleness, is the high<br/>
craft of story-telling, is the elaborate deference<br/>
to women, are the charming old idlers and<br/>
rhetoricians with their bubbling, <span style="color: #0000FF;">full-bellied<br/>
<br/>
</span>good humor-are these good things of mellower<br/>
days in the process of passing away?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in a sense. Industry is a rude thing,<br/>
and progress is cruel. Something is lost in the<br/>
change that is taking place. You will now<br/>
find, in some old towns where gentlefolk once<br/>
ruled social life, a new and raw company who<br/>
make "society." It is so the world over.<br/>
<br/>
But the sum of such social losses is more<br/>
than balanced by the genuine additions to<br/>
cultivated life and to high aims and to sterling<br/>
and even beautiful character that the rise of the<br/>
people is bringing-vastly more than balanced.<br/>
<br/>
For the most important change that is taking<br/>
place is not the development of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wealth-great </span>as that is-but the development of the<br/>
people, the people who till now have been<br/>
isolated, side-tracked, held back, kept out of<br/>
the highways of life. The base of cultivated<br/>
society is now immensely broadened. More<br/>
individuals-a thousand times more-share<br/>
its benefits than under the old regime.<br/>
<br/>
LESSONS FROM THE SOUTH AND FOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
HREE great lessons have elsewhere been<br/>
pointed out that the South may teach<br/>
the rest of the country. There are others, but<br/>
these stand out clearly-municipal government, the teaching of trades, the teaching of<br/>
farmers. If one had to say what lessons the<br/>
South needs itself most to learn, these would<br/>
be selected:<br/>
(r) Sound economic thought, which would<br/>
bring greater freedom from mere traditions<br/>
and formulas.<br/>
