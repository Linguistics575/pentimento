<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">REGULATION<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">spite </span>of any mistakes of method that he may<br/>
make and in spite of the gross mistakes of<br/>
loquacity that some of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>family have<br/>
made. If he were to modify his general policy,<br/>
then many of the masses would stand <span style="color: #0000FF;">with-let </span>us say some Hearst or other. The Great<br/>
Interests may, if they are foolish enough, cause<br/>
the rise of class-hatred and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bring </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>danger of<br/>
an angry class-conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Roosevelt is a man who understands<br/>
the necessity of keeping property secure; he<br/>
was reared among the property-owning class;<br/>
he is a "rich" man in the sense that he is not<br/>
a poor man; he has the same regard for the<br/>
preservation of real wealth as any other man<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">property-holding </span>class has. Moreover,<br/>
he has not a much longer period in the White<br/>
House. He would be pleased to end his term<br/>
with great popularity. He has <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>enough<br/>
enemies, and doubtless he would be glad not<br/>
to add to the list of them. He has an <span style="color: #0000FF;">abhorrence </span>of disorder in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>world, as in<br/>
any other part of American life. His ideal<br/>
American citizen is a prosperous, vigorous,<br/>
normal, cheerful, productive man; and a man<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">can</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>be very productive or very cheerful if he<br/>
be not reasonably prosperous.<br/>
<br/>
He is, then, pursuing his course not <span style="color: #0000FF;">recklessly </span>but deliberately and for the sole purpose<br/>
of correcting the criminal methods of the<br/>
predatory corporations which have brought<br/>
abnormal conditions; and he is not going to<br/>
change that course, in spite of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vindictive<br/>
</span>action of some courts and state governments,<br/>
nor in spite of the hubbub in Wall Street.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption of Wall Street is that the<br/>
stability of values of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>interests<br/>
is the most sacred thing in the world; that any<br/>
attack on a rich man or company or kind of<br/>
"securities" means anarchy; and that the<br/>
safety of the finances of the rich is of more<br/>
importance than the financial safety of the<br/>
poor. The swollen vanity of this view of<br/>
the world is one of the most pitiful things in<br/>
American life. It would be merely ludicrous<br/>
if it were not dangerous; for if the rich or their<br/>
spokesmen cry out too painfully, they may<br/>
cause a panic, as men cause a panic at a fire<br/>
by mere excitement.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a rich man's country nor a poor<br/>
man's country. It ought to belong-and it<br/>
will belong-to every man, rich or poor, in<br/>
proportion to his honest earnings and his<br/>
character in their management. But it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is-and<br/>
</span>it will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be-the </span>country of the honest man, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>9389<br/>
<br/>
man who obeys the laws, which are made alike<br/>
for rich and for poor, and the man who regards<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbor</span>'s rights as sacred as his own.<br/>
<br/>
CHANGING METHODS OF CORPORATION LAWYERS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IF </span>ANY man ask for proof of the change<br/>
that is taking place in the management<br/>
of corporations, let him investigate the work<br/>
now being done by the best corporation lawyers.<br/>
A few years ago, they had no hesitation in<br/>
using dummies in making organizations, not<br/>
dummies for merely technical reasons but for<br/>
the very structure of corporations. They<br/>
guarded their clients chiefly against the dangers<br/>
of internal dissensions and the dangers of<br/>
technical violations of the law. Now there is<br/>
a great change in the practice of corporation<br/>
law. The advice that you will receive is that<br/>
the directors must really direct; that the stockholders must be considered; that the issues<br/>
of stock must bear rigid investigation; that<br/>
expenses must be charged where they belong;<br/>
and your corporation <span style="color: #ff0000;">lassryer</span>'s mind is fixed<br/>
on the possibility that the corporation may<br/>
at some time be investigated. The practically<br/>
complete disappearance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>non-directing<br/>
director is another noteworthy change.<br/>
<br/>
Now <span style="color: #ff0000;">there </span>changes, and many more like<br/>
them, did not come of themselves nor did they<br/>
come from the inner grace of corporation<br/>
lawyers. They came because of the pressure<br/>
that is everywhere felt for the cleaner and more<br/>
scrupulous conduct of corporate business. This<br/>
pressure <span style="color: #0000FF;">comes </span>through the national government, or through the state goverment, or<br/>
merely by the general awakening. The main<br/>
matter is, that there is such a pressure and<br/>
that such a change is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS<br/>
<br/>
HE <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>act of the new Public Utilities<br/>
Commission of New York was the investigation of the traction situation in New York<br/>
City, beginning with the subway, the elevated<br/>
roads, and the surface lines of Manhattan<br/>
Borough. The Commission went swiftly to<br/>
work. Within a few weeks of the taking of<br/>
office, Chairman Willcox and his committee<br/>
were probing into the affairs of the so-called<br/>
Interboro-Metropolitan Company.<br/>
<br/>
Under the skilful questioning of Mr. W. M.<br/>
Ivins, the counsel of the Commission, there<br/>
have been revealed to the public many dark<br/>
secrets. Almost every financial wrong-doing<br/>
of which a corporation is capable has been<br/>
<br/>
