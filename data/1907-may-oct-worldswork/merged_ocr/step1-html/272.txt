</span>One of the great achievements of Lord Cromer's policy is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective </span>body of trained native soldiers<br/>
<br/>
the very guns of the British and French <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleets</span>,<br/>
and scores of Europeans were murdered.<br/>
Both <span style="color: #ff0000;">flccts </span>cleared for action, but the Frenchman received a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cablegram </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">clear </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The English admiral then told Arabi how<br/>
much time he had in which to dismantle the<br/>
Alexandrian forts. Arabi put his hand over<br/>
his mouth to restrain his <span style="color: #ff0000;">undignifwd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">merri<br/>
</span>ment. The English cannon then dismantled<br/>
the forts. In retaliation, Arabi prepared to<br/>
<br/>
cut off the water supply of the Europeans in<br/>
Alexandria. England hurriedly attended to<br/>
the formalities written down in the book of<br/>
international etiquette and then landed the<br/>
marines.<br/>
<br/>
Arabi left Alexandria and threatened the<br/>
Canal. England called on all the Powers to<br/>
unite in its protection, but they refused. France<br/>
was then asked to help save the work of its<br/>
engineers, but the statesmen <span style="color: #0000FF;">declined</span>. England then put <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tommy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Atkins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ashore </span>at Ismailia.<br/>
Tommy caught <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabi </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tcl-cl-ke</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and<br/>
made a good job of it. Arabi disappeared<br/>
over the horizon toward Cairo, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">two<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>squadrons of English cavalry rode hard across<br/>
the burning sands and Cairo surrendered.<br/>
Two days later, London <span style="color: #0000FF;">notified </span>Constantinople<br/>
that Tommy would be leaving for home shortly.<br/>
That was in 1882, and London would not have<br/>
believed that he would be there in 1907.<br/>
<br/>
It was really the Mahdi who blocked the<br/>
game. The uprising in the Soudan led England to send Gordon to Egypt as <span style="color: #ff0000;">GovernorGeneral </span>of the Soudan, and this was intended<br/>
to result in the evacuation of that part of the<br/>
country. But when Gordon was making <span style="color: #0000FF;">his</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">single-handed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fight</span>, begging England to <span style="color: #0000FF;">send<br/>
</span>him just one British regiment to save the<br/>
national honor, public sentiment forced the<br/>
Gladstone ministry to land more troops on<br/>
Egyptian soil. Major Baring had meanwhile<br/>
returned to Egypt, landing in the midst of these<br/>
stirring events. The most inexplicable thing<br/>
in Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cromer</span>'s career is that Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wolseley</span>,<br/>
commanding the Gordon relief expedition,<br/>
should have been allowed to stay in Cairo long<br/>
enough to be just <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few hours too late to <span style="color: #0000FF;">save<br/>
</span>the picturesque and daring soldier whose tragic<br/>
