<span>9144 TAFT<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>
</span>a curiously Democratic utterance from a probable Republican nominee for the Presidency,<br/>
especially as contrasted with the only Democratic candidate's fervid desire for centralization<br/>
through the Government ownership of railroads.<br/>
<br/>
The undergraduate, however, did not give<br/>
all his political thought to the nation. With<br/>
"the choice lot of boys from Andover," a<br/>
clique was formed that controlled matters in<br/>
their class, and then pretty much in the whole<br/>
University. Then Taft showed himself a<br/>
clever amateur at <span style="color: #0000FF;">practical </span>politics. This<br/>
does not mean that he was starting the career<br/>
of a political gamester. He simply played the<br/>
college political game out of pure zest and love<br/>
for the college.<br/>
<br/>
At this time there was considerable animosity<br/>
aroused because of the two senior societies,<br/>
and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s senior year "the Neutrals"<br/>
organized against them. Now Mr. Taft's<br/>
father had helped to found one of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">societies</span>, "the Skull and Bones," back in 1832, and<br/>
the honor of membership naturally fell to the<br/>
son, though it would have come in any case.<br/>
When the election for class orator came on,<br/>
the two societies, of fifteen members each out<br/>
of a class of 120, found "the Neutrals" arrayed<br/>
against them. But the societies put up Taft for<br/>
orator, and after the vote, Taft was declared<br/>
elected. Then someone charged trickery,<br/>
whereupon Taft wrathfully demanded another<br/>
election. He could not accept the honor under<br/>
a cloud. The second election only<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>increased<br/>
his majority. "The Neutrals" wanted him,<br/>
too, and he stood for his class as orator.<br/>
<br/>
His oration was pronounced "a good,<br/>
strong, substantial piece of work." It was not<br/>
very notable for style, or graceful periods,<br/>
or particular brilliancy; but it was clear and<br/>
logical, free from rambling side issues;<br/>
yet, most of all, it produced effect because of<br/>
his earnestness and sincerity. He stood second<br/>
in the class of 120, and was salutatorian.<br/>
William H. Taft had done creditably the first<br/>
big job of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-that </span>of getting educated.<br/>
<br/>
THE LOYALTY OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">HIS </span>CLASSMATES<br/>
<br/>
One thing further should be noted, since<br/>
it is a finger of prophecy, pointing from his<br/>
college life into the future. The thing is this:<br/>
it got to be the common idea, even among so<br/>
promising a generation of Yale men, that<br/>
"Bill" Taft would rise high in the nation.<br/>
The idea became a matter of course, a creed,<br/>
and afterward, a Yale tradition. Once grown<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span>CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
to college age, Taft no longer announced that<br/>
he was going to be President. In the modesty<br/>
of added years, an ambition like that seemed<br/>
absurd and was to be forgotten with. all<br/>
reverence. But his classmates announced it<br/>
for him. However curious this seems, the<br/>
thing was obvious to them and they believed<br/>
it firmly, and continued to believe it. They<br/>
have always been intensely loyal and <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthusiastic </span>in his behalf, and ever ready to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight </span>for<br/>
him. So long ago as the Minneapolis Convention (the one which nominated Benjamin<br/>
Harrison the first time), when the party was<br/>
shifting desperately around to <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>"a black<br/>
horse," two Yale men of'78 wired to a third<br/>
man of'78, the latter being prominent in the<br/>
Convention:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Now is the time!"<br/>
<br/>
They wanted to nominate "Old Bill" for<br/>
the Presidency of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>United States.<br/>
<br/>
But there remains for us to trace the busy,<br/>
useful life of the stalwart young graduate who<br/>
left Yale in 1878.<br/>
<br/>
For the present we add his own words, that<br/>
he took "the step downward that has to be<br/>
taken from the altitude of the senior year to the<br/>
sense of <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificance </span>that comes quickly to<br/>
the ordinary graduate in the year succeeding<br/>
his college life." "It is a year," he says<br/>
further, "that adds much to the graduate's<br/>
usefulness in his community, and restores his<br/>
sense of proportion."<br/>
<br/>
Young Taft's sense of proportion was <span style="color: #ff0000;">restored </span>in his father's law office in Cincinnati,<br/>
and there he experienced "the humbling<br/>
change from the estimate of the college world<br/>
to the estimate of the world at large." About<br/>
his own conception of the world at large, suggesting the buckling on of armor and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">impatience </span>of the untried warrior-suggesting,<br/>
too, his unvarying attitude, that of industry,<br/>
monumental industry, we have again his own<br/>
statement, in the following clear-cut words:<br/>
<br/>
"The young man most to be congratulated is he who has<br/>
been given an education as thorough and as useful as he<br/>
himself wishes to make it, and then under the spur of<br/>
necessity enters upon a life of work without the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temptation<br/>
</span>to lack of effort and idleness which a competence <span style="color: #0000FF;">always<br/>
</span>creates."<br/>
<br/>
Again he was lucky. But he deserved it.<br/>
Henceforth, as we shall see, his luck and his<br/>
deserts continued in the refreshingly and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">poctically </span>justifiable way that so rarely happens<br/>
outside of books written for growing boys<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
