<span>WHAT SCANDINAVIA <span style="color: #ff0000;">CAN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TEACH<br/>
<br/>
</span>is called in Scandinavia merely social justice<br/>
and is accomplished largely out of the public<br/>
purse.<br/>
<br/>
So much may be said of Scandinavia as a<br/>
whole. But we are here dealing with three<br/>
peoples, three temperaments, three <span style="color: #ff0000;">exchecquers</span>.<br/>
When seeking specific examples of applied<br/>
democracy, we shall <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>them first in one<br/>
country of the trio and then in another.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">BODY-BUILDING </span>IN SWEDEN<br/>
<br/>
Sweden, for instance, can teach us a broader<br/>
conception of the term "public health." The<br/>
health we foster publicly in American cities is<br/>
but the absence of disease. In Sweden, health<br/>
means something more than not-sickness; it<br/>
stands for physical well-being, soundness,<br/>
splendid vigor. Without for a moment neglecting medical precautions, it attacks the positive<br/>
side of the question-" How to insure to every<br/>
Swede his natural birthright of abounding<br/>
vitality."<br/>
<br/>
The answer, as everybody knows, is Exercise.<br/>
<br/>
But we do not all know how far Sweden<br/>
carries that creed. Exercise, gymnastic exercise, not mere walking, is a religion. The<br/>
very criminals under sentence must have it,<br/>
and therefore full instructions for daily gymnastics are posted even in the condemned cell.<br/>
As soon would they think of depriving a malefactor of his Bible as of his "day's order."<br/>
Grown folk must have it, and therefore the<br/>
gymnasiums spring up as thick as mushrooms.<br/>
The children must have it; therefore, when<br/>
the State has done all that it can for them<br/>
physically, private associations take them up.<br/>
Free skating rinks and toboggan slides-even<br/>
free toboggans and skates for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">skatelessare </span>provided less with the end of giving the<br/>
children joy than of promoting that fetish of<br/>
the Swedish soul-public health. Associations for outdoor games take charge of the<br/>
public playgrounds, organizing so-called pedagogic games that are not only uproarious fun<br/>
but develop swiftness, precision, and snap.<br/>
With government aid, these societies send<br/>
teachers of games to all the common schools<br/>
and the children are turned loose in the openair every day for a short romp. We use these<br/>
Swedish games in our gymnasiums and in such<br/>
of the public schools as can command the<br/>
space. Why not use them out-of-doors and<br/>
make them universal?<br/>
<br/>
The Swedish Government itself takes splendid care <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the muscles of its little citizens.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">TEACH </span>US 8887<br/>
Every school-child in the kingdom is under<br/>
bonds to learn to swim, unless, as is rarely<br/>
the case, the schoolhouse is too far from any<br/>
water. The Swedish small boy is more likely<br/>
to be provided with swimming trunks and<br/>
forced into the water than, as with us, arrested<br/>
for going in without them.<br/>
<br/>
As for the formal gymnastics in Swedish<br/>
schools, it is a very serious affair; for it is<br/>
body building. One system (the Ling) prevails throughout the kingdom, and even in the<br/>
country schools the teachers are all experts.<br/>
A Swede would as soon think of letting a <span style="color: #0000FF;">medical </span>student experiment upon his liver as of<br/>
permitting a teacher to meddle with his children's muscles without a <span style="color: #0000FF;">certificate </span>from the<br/>
Royal Institute. The worship of the Ling system may be ludicrous, but the American <span style="color: #ff0000;">nosystem </span>is not less absurd. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Think </span>of the young<br/>
women who, "take up" Delsarte or <span style="color: #0000FF;">whatnot<br/>
</span>and are permitted to teach. Think of the overworked grade teachers who are considered good<br/>
enough to educate the bodies of the children<br/>
in the public schools. True, experts sometimes<br/>
teach these luckless teachers to teach the <span style="color: #0000FF;">children </span>to wave their arms and legs. But you cannot make good gymnasts, theoretical or practical,<br/>
out of the rank and <span style="color: #0000FF;">file </span>of stiff or <span style="color: #0000FF;">flabby </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">schoolma'ams</span>. The bodies of young Americans are<br/>
not "<span style="color: #0000FF;">built</span>" -they just grow.<br/>
<br/>
The rugged children of Sweden are a <span style="color: #0000FF;">convincing </span>recommendation of the national<br/>
method. In agility, poise, and grace, to say<br/>
nothing of physical stamina, they are far in<br/>
advance of our school children. A bigger<br/>
investment in scientific physical training in<br/>
our schools would pay dividends in the shape<br/>
of a steadier nervous organization, a sounder<br/>
physique.<br/>
<br/>
When a Swede gets his body built, he does<br/>
not leave off there. What the club is to an<br/>
American business man, the gymnasium is to<br/>
the Swede. He takes exercise suited to his<br/>
age to keep in condition; or if ailing, puts into<br/>
the nearest gymnasium for repairs. The<br/>
movement cure and <span style="color: #0000FF;">massage-thee </span>are his<br/>
substitutes for nostrums. Headaches, <span style="color: #ff0000;">livercomplaints</span>, nerves, dyspepsia are all treated,<br/>
at least partially, by active or passive gymnastics. That is, the Swede either <span style="color: #0000FF;">exercises </span>or<br/>
lies down and permits an attendant to exercise<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Medical gymnastics after the Swedish model<br/>
are more and more coming into favor with<br/>
American physicians. But middle-aged Amer<br/>
