The next Conference is to be held not later<br/>
than 1914, if the proposal of the American<br/>
delegation be adopted<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the meantime, we<br/>
shall see the establishment of the International<br/>
High Court of Justice, which will be the most<br/>
august judicial body in the world. According<br/>
to the present plan, this Court will consist of<br/>
fifteen <span style="color: #ff0000;">judges-mine </span>from Europe, four from<br/>
America, and two from Asia. It will be a<br/>
court of appeal from the decisions of all commissions that have to do with international<br/>
disputes. This Supreme Court of the World<br/>
will be the achievement of Mr. Choate, whose<br/>
addresses not only made him a commanding<br/>
person in the Conference, but really led to the<br/>
adoption of the proposition.<br/>
<br/>
The opposition to this tribunal comes from<br/>
the nations that are not Powers-chiefly from<br/>
the Latin-American states, whose sense of<br/>
proportion needs readjustment. It is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">regrettable </span>fact that some of the Latin-American<br/>
delegates have taken their admission to the<br/>
Conference too seriously. They have shown<br/>
a disposition to estimate their importance to<br/>
.the world's peace by their <span style="color: #ff0000;">indi1idual </span>titles<br/>
and medals, rather than by the relative<br/>
standing of <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>respective <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries-Venezuela </span>would rank with Germany, or higher!<br/>
This is, unfortunately, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>matter of temperament.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, these small republics<br/>
were probably invited to the Conference somewhat in the same spirit that the eldest sons of<br/>
English peers are given <span style="color: #0000FF;">access </span>to the House of<br/>
Lords-that they may serve an apprenticeship<br/>
in international affairs. It was not expected<br/>
that a forty-first-rate nation would insist upon<br/>
representation equal to that of a first-rate<br/>
Power.<br/>
<br/>
IV<br/>
<br/>
This racial characteristic is further shown<br/>
in the plans for a Central-American Peace<br/>
Conference, to be held in Washington early in<br/>
the coming year. The five Central-American<br/>
states have agreed to submit their quarrels to<br/>
the joint-umpireship of the United States and<br/>
Mexico, that an end may be brought to the<br/>
<br/>
9397<br/>
<br/>
senseless revolutions that have long blocked<br/>
the road to prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
But the significant announcement is also<br/>
made that none of the diplomatic representatives of these republics that are now at Washington will be members of the Conference-on<br/>
account of petty jealousies that exist. The one<br/>
great need of the countries to the south of us is<br/>
a generation of men of larger <span style="color: #0000FF;">calibre-states</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>men to replace the excitable little <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofcc-seckers<br/>
</span>with their pompous titles and their fondness for<br/>
epaulettes.<br/>
<br/>
V<br/>
<br/>
But, in spite of all that the nations have not<br/>
agreed upon, we are on the high road to peace.<br/>
The Great Powers have come closer <span style="color: #0000FF;">together<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>nations that have <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dreadnoughts</span>, and<br/>
torpedo flotillas, and explosives against which<br/>
there is no human protection. The Powers<br/>
that really <span style="color: #0000FF;">hold </span>the world's peace in their hands,<br/>
and that police the high seas and the semicivilized lands, have had no serious disagreement on the main subject that brought the<br/>
Conference together. War has not been <span style="color: #0000FF;">abolished</span>, and will not be. Men have not wholly<br/>
ceased to knock each other down under great<br/>
provocation, though we have excellent statutes<br/>
and a strong public sentiment against it. And<br/>
nations are only men in mass.<br/>
<br/>
But public opinion-the real peace-compelling power anywhere-is stronger for peace<br/>
than it ever has been in human history<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

URING the first half of this year 43,000<br/>
more persons went from New York to<br/>
Europe than <span style="color: #ff0000;">duiing </span>the same period last year;<br/>
and the total <span style="color: #ff0000;">numbcr </span>of passengers this <span style="color: #0000FF;">half</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>(exclusive of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steerage</span>) was nearly<br/>
300,000. It is significant that the greatest increase is in the number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">third-class </span>passengers<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-persons </span>who <span style="color: #ff0000;">travcl </span>at moderate expense.<br/>
An equally surprising increase would doubtless<br/>
be shown, if the figures were known, of the<br/>
number of Americans who have recently made<br/>
a journey around the world.<br/>
<br/>
This increase in the number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">travelers </span>is a<br/>
result, of course, of the prosperity of the people.<br/>
Every year the number who can afford such<br/>
a luxury grows larger. Travel, in fact, is no<br/>
longer a luxury. It has become a necessity for<br/>
a large class of persons. But this is not all<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The swelling tide of travel shows also an <span style="color: #ff0000;">everincreasing </span>intellectual curiosity. A trip <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
