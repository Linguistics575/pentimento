</span>The ore usually in the bins awaiting <span style="color: #0000FF;">treatment </span>is worth $ 1,000,000<br/>
<br/>
but the mountains were cleared of timber until<br/>
the circle grew too big, and as the shafts, fitted<br/>
with "chicken ladders," could not be followed<br/>
any deeper, the treasure still there had to be<br/>
abandoned. Then an American harnessed up a<br/>
waterfall and brought a wire into camp. The<br/>
ore can be lifted by modern hoists, and then<br/>
treated cheaply because of cheap power. And<br/>
now they say in that camp that the old Spaniards only scratched the vein. The millions<br/>
of ounces taken out were but a crumb. Costly<br/>
development work, including a tunnel to open<br/>
up the ore body, may or may not justify such<br/>
a hope. But meantime Guanajuato enjoys<br/>
life again. Nearly 600 stamp mills are in<br/>
operation, and the cheap ores the Spaniards<br/>
could not touch, and their tailings and dumps<br/>
out of which they could not get the gold, are<br/>
yielding handsomely. One entire village <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>300 adobe houses, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tepetapa </span>by name, has been<br/>
bought for pay dirt on the basis of actual<br/>
assays. The adobe bricks had been made<br/>
from the slimes formed by grinding ore, and<br/>
the gold in them runs as high as $ 12 to the ton.<br/>
<br/>
However, all volcanic Mexico seems like a<br/>
thriving mining camp. Mexico gave our<br/>
continent its very first mining boom, and to-day<br/>
after four centuries it is part of the boom that<br/>
spreads even to the Arctic regions. "It is<br/>
believed," says The Engineering and Mining<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">carnal</span>, "that the development of the mineral<br/>
resources of the republic has been only begun."<br/>
It is estimated that during <span style="color: #0000FF;">1905-06 </span>$ 50,000,000<br/>
of American capital went into Mexican mines.<br/>
At Cananea, an American copper enterprise<br/>
has invested $ 15,000,000, <span style="color: #0000FF;">employs </span>5,000 men,<br/>
and supports a town of 25,000. In Sonora<br/>
