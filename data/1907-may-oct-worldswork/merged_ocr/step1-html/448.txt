Macedonia. The opinions of the monarchs<br/>
were, of course, in entire confidence. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Therefore </span>I can but say in general terms that they<br/>
were unanimous in the belief that Macedonia<br/>
must be established as an autonomy under a<br/>
European prince as Governor-General.<br/>
<br/>
In more than one high quarter, Prince<br/>
Danilo of Montenegro was mentioned, and in<br/>

"What, in your opinion, would be the best<br/>
settlement of the question?" I asked.<br/>
<br/>
"There is but one way; namely, for the<br/>
Powers to call a conference and place Macedonia under a governor-general, who must<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>European prince. The reforms <span style="color: #0000FF;">would<br/>
</span>then be carried out and the Greek bands<br/>

<br/>
While in Montenegro, I talked this matter<br/>
over with Prince Nicholas, the spendid ruler<br/>
of that brave little country. I found that he<br/>
held very strong views on this Macedonian<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
"It is a monstrous state of affairs," he<br/>
declared. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Something </span>must be done at once,<br/>

He is a very bright and well-educated <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span>,<br/>

neighboring states and to the importance of<br/>
