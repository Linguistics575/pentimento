<span>FRICK, <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SILENT<br/>
<br/>
</span>millions. Then he planned to build a great<br/>
philanthropic institution across the street<br/>
from the Carnegie Library. His agents undertook to buy the property. Mr. Frick had<br/>
already bought it.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Carnegie built a palatial residence on<br/>
Fifth Avenue at Ninety-first Street in New<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">York </span>City. A little while ago, the legislature<br/>
of New York authorized the trustees of the<br/>
Lenox Library to sell the entire block on Fifth<br/>
Avenue between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sixth-ninth </span>and Seventieth<br/>
Streets. There has been no denial to the<br/>
repeated publication of the statement that Mr.<br/>
Frick will be the purchaser, and that he intends to tear down one of the most beautiful<br/>
buildings in New York to make way for a<br/>
residence that shall excel Mr. Carnegie's<br/>
residence, a few blocks above, in beauty and<br/>
in the noble spaciousness of the grounds that<br/>
surround it.<br/>
<br/>
These things may all be coincidences, but<br/>
the statements of warm friends of both Mr.<br/>
Carnegie and Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>seem to discredit that<br/>
assumption. They declare that Mr. Carnegie<br/>
has mellowed with years, and that, having no<br/>
longer an active business career, he would<br/>
willingly be quits with Mr. Frick; but that Mr.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>has neither forgotten nor forgiven the past.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Mr. Frick is in the prime of<br/>
business life. Besides the interests that have<br/>
been named above, he is a power in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>bria Steel Company, the Norfolk and Western<br/>
Railroad, and in the Baltimore and Ohio.<br/>
His latest active speculations have been in<br/>
Reading Railroad stocks. He has only begun<br/>
his life as a financier, as distinguished from a<br/>
manufacturer.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick</span>'s first public appearance in New<br/>
York was at the disclosures of corruption in<br/>
the Equitable Life Assurance Society. With<br/>
many other eminent men, he was on the board<br/>
of directors by courtesy and to give the company distinction. When the late James W.<br/>
Alexander and the younger Mr. Hyde made<br/>
counter charges of dishonesty against each<br/>
other, Mr. Frick was appointed chairman of<br/>
the committee to investigate the charges. The<br/>
committee reported that the charges of each<br/>
were true and recommended that both leave<br/>
the company. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">committee</span>'s report was<br/>
killed in a directors' meeting, and the committee resigned from the board. There has<br/>
been no evidence produced to show that Mr.<br/>
Frick had any profitable connection with the<br/>
funds of the Equitable.<br/>
<br/>
8857<br/>
<br/>
But about this time the opportunity came<br/>
for Mr. Frick to ally himself with Mr. Harriman. This alliance began with Mr. Frick's entrance into the directorate of the Union Pacific,<br/>
and has continued until Mr. Frick is now a<br/>
member of the Executive Committee. These<br/>
friendly relations with Mr. Harriman persist,<br/>
becoming daily more apparent in the relations<br/>
of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore & Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Frick's connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad dates back to the days of his<br/>
management of the Carnegie Steel Company.<br/>
The Pennsylvania handled most of the enormous freight of the steel company, and it was<br/>
inevitable that the manager of such vast freight<br/>
interests should be compelled to have an<br/>
interest in his principal means of transportation. Mr. Frick has increased that interest steadily until to-day he is credited with<br/>
the ownership of about $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">8,590,000 </span>of Pennsylvania Railroad stock.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick</span>'s political activities are also inevitable results of his business interests. As the head<br/>
of the steel business, which, perhaps more than<br/>
any other business, owed its enormous growth<br/>
and profit to the protective tariff, it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">inevitable </span>that he should support the Republican<br/>
party which maintained that tariff. He is<br/>
credited in Pennsylvania with being consistently<br/>
one of the largest subscribers to the National<br/>
Republican campaign fund. His relations<br/>
with the devious paths of the Pennsylvania<br/>
state machine are impossible to trace. Only<br/>
one story of consequence has been published,<br/>
and that can only be repeated on the authority<br/>
of the newspapers whose reports were not<br/>
denied. Their story was that at the time that<br/>
Senator Matthew S. Quay died, the Republican<br/>
State Committee of Pennsylvania owed sums<br/>
variously estimated to aggregate from $ 150,000<br/>
to more than a million dollars: that the Committee offered the seat of the late United States<br/>
Senator to the man who would pay that debt;<br/>
that Mr. Carnegie declined to touch it; and that<br/>
finally, at a meeting in Philadelphia of Mr.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick</span>, Mr. Cassatt, and representatives of the<br/>
Standard Oil Company, the election of Senator<br/>
Knox was decided upon, and the bill was paid.<br/>
The only obvious substantiation of the story<br/>
is the fact that Mr. Knox was at that time Mr.<br/>
Frick's personal attorney.<br/>
<br/>
Upon Pittsburg <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>Mr. Frick seems to<br/>
have impressed, regarding himself, his own seal<br/>
of silence. So powerfully <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>his influence<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
