<span>9488 WHEN TO USE A LAWYER<br/>
<br/>
disposing of a small estate, on account of the complications that may arise. Many contingencies<br/>
must be <span style="color: #ff0000;">foreseen </span>and anticipated, and to effectuate the intention of a will requires considerable<br/>
foresight, clear expression, and the avoidance<br/>
of many technical perils. A correct will is of<br/>
great value; a careless one frequently does<br/>
positive damage. Guardians, executors, trustees, sales, loans, and investments frequently<br/>
must be provided for, and in the skilful handling<br/>
of these provisions the attorney's fees may be<br/>
saved several times over. Unskilful persons<br/>
unintentionally and unknowingly insert terms<br/>
in the paper which are a great detriment to the<br/>
persons concerned. Debts which cannot be<br/>
raised for a long time are frequently charged<br/>
against the land and the title is thereby encumbered and rendered unmarketable. Through<br/>
an imprudent disposition of the estate, so many<br/>
practical obstacles may be encountered <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>title may become seriously involved and expensive court proceedings be made necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Any one who acts in a fiduciary <span style="color: #0000FF;">capacity-such </span>as executor, guardian, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">trustee-must<br/>
</span>have legal aid and can charge the cost of the<br/>
same to the estate which he represents. There<br/>
is a general principle of law that persons who<br/>
act in the representative capacity are entitled<br/>
to nothing whatever beyond their <span style="color: #0000FF;">commission-in </span>other words, that their acts may entail loss<br/>
to themselves but may not produce gain.<br/>
Furthermore, one trustee or executor may become liable for the default of his <span style="color: #ff0000;">co-trustee </span>or<br/>
co-executor. Yet, in spite of the danger which<br/>
may occur, fiduciaries frequently assume risk<br/>
from pure carelessness. They have a habit of<br/>
acting first and consulting a lawyer afterward.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN FACING PROBABLE BANKRUPTCY<br/>
<br/>
Business men not infrequently hang on to the<br/>
point of actual bankruptcy before they seek<br/>
advice. It should be unnecessary to state that<br/>
time should not be wasted until the assets are<br/>
dissipated before action. In such cases, little<br/>
can be done in the way <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>settlement or adjustment in the absence of cash to pay expenses.<br/>
However, if taken at the proper time, before the<br/>
danger is imminent and while the client is still<br/>
in a position to dictate terms, many business<br/>
concerns which otherwise would run into<br/>
almost total loss to both debtor and creditor<br/>
may be reorganized.<br/>
<br/>
The lawyer always endeavors so to arrange<br/>
transactions that whatever is done can be<br/>
proved, and proved without running the gaunt<br/>
let of a multitude of technical objections. The<br/>
popular practice, however, is to neglect the<br/>
proof until a suit is necessary, and usually until<br/>
much of it is destroyed or in the hands of an<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">oppoment</span>. Judging by this practice, one<br/>
might think that proper system required that<br/>
the names and addresses of witnesses should be<br/>
immediately forgotten and all documents in<br/>
the case consigned to the waste-basket.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN A SUIT IS THREATENED<br/>
<br/>
The settlement of actual or threatened litigation has to-day become almost an art. To<br/>
ascertain the present value of a future trial is<br/>
often the problem to be decided. To reach<br/>
this decision requires a practical knowledge of<br/>
the technical advantages, as well as the equities<br/>
of the case. In both respects, the knowledge of<br/>
the attorney is superior to the client's. His view<br/>
is less personal, and success in his profession<br/>
requires that he examine both sides of a dispute.<br/>
Litigation is costly to all concerned. One side<br/>
must lose in every trial, and the gain of the other<br/>
side is frequently less than the indirect loss. In<br/>
proportion to the amount involved, trial-fees<br/>
are large and office-fees small. The trial of a<br/>
case may consume days and even months, and<br/>
the preparation for it generally requires more<br/>
time than the legal proceedings. In addition,<br/>
all parties are subject to a heavy strain, and<br/>
entire success for either side is the exception.<br/>
To-day, not only the weak cases but also the<br/>
strong, are settled out of court, for these reasons,<br/>
and generally with considerable profit to the<br/>
client; his net balance, after deducting counsel<br/>
fees, exceeds the amount, often by several times,<br/>
that he can obtain unaided. The client seldom<br/>
understands the advantages and disadvantages<br/>
of his position.<br/>
<br/>
The indirect gain to a client must not be overlooked. The assistance of the counsel <span style="color: #0000FF;">produces<br/>
</span>a sense of security and induces courage. The<br/>
office of a lawyer is a clearing-house for information in his line, and the lawyer of to-day must<br/>
be a man of affairs. His advice on business<br/>
questions that incidently arise is of not less<br/>
benefit than his legal advice. This advice is<br/>
open to the inexperienced and the poor, as well<br/>
as the rich, and tends to produce an equality of<br/>
position. Clients must be educated in the<br/>
habits that render them to some extent self<br/>
protecting, and they can only be taught by<br/>
practical experience the cases which they can<br/>
decide for themselves and those that require<br/>
assistance,<br/>
