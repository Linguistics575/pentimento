<br/>
the applicant, and the necessity "of getting<br/>
high interest returns out of the investment.<br/>
<br/>
To the man or woman who has saved $ 500<br/>
by dint of long self-sacrifice, the reply is almost<br/>
invariable. It is to leave the money in the<br/>
savings bank, provided the bank is organized<br/>
under strong protective laws. To the New<br/>
York or Massachusetts saver this advice is <span style="color: #0000FF;">always </span>given. To the depositors in the socalled savings banks in some other states<br/>
we think it a kindness to suggest that they<br/>
take the money out of the banks and put<br/>
it into the bonds of such a company as the<br/>
Pennsylvania Railroad, or into strong<br/>
municipal bonds. This article is not the<br/>
proper place to discuss in full the laws of the<br/>
various states.<br/>
<br/>
Turning to the wider class of savers who are<br/>
thinking of investment, the class that holds<br/>
from $ 1,000 to $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,500 </span>cash, earning <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>savings banks an average of perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">M- </span>per<br/>
cent., the question becomes more difficult.<br/>
This is the class of people that falls an easy prey<br/>
to the promoter and the swindler. In reality,<br/>
such an individual should either leave the<br/>
money in bank, or else invest it only in a most<br/>
conservative way; but it is astounding how<br/>
large a percentage of such people will risk half<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-quarters </span>of this fund in some mining<br/>
stock, some great invention, or some iridescent<br/>
dream of a promoter.<br/>
<br/>
In answering such queries, this magazine<br/>
allows itself some latitude. If the saver is a<br/>
man on a good salary, pretty well established<br/>
and not likely to worry over things, it is possible to go so far as to advise the purchase of a<br/>
few shares of a standard stock, either railroad<br/>
or industrial. This has been the case in <span style="color: #ff0000;">particcular </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>last spring. A small amount of<br/>
Union Pacific preferred or common, of Great<br/>
Northern preferred, Northern Pacific, New<br/>
York Central, or General Electric at the prices<br/>
obtaining through the spring and early summer,<br/>
has not seemed to us amiss for such an investor.<br/>
The returns are large, and the ultimate values<br/>
behind the stocks are plain enough for any man<br/>
to see.<br/>
<br/>
. 1f the query comes from a woman teaching<br/>
school, saving a pittance from stenography, or<br/>
saving her pennies from a shop-girl's pay, the<br/>
answer is very generally to keep the account<br/>
in the savings bank, unless the savings bank is<br/>
in a state where an investment would be safer,<br/>
or at least as safe. In a case like this last, the<br/>
advice often is to buy bonds.<br/>
<br/>
INVESTING A SAVINGS BANK FUND<br/>
<br/>
Let us assume, for instance, the case of a<br/>
woman <span style="color: #0000FF;">school-teacher </span>who has saved $ 1,000<br/>
and has it in savings banks paying her 3 per<br/>
cent., under laws that do not make the savings<br/>
bank absolutely secure. Various replies have<br/>
been given to such queries as this. One investment that has been suggested more than<br/>
once is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
2 Bonds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3500 </span>each, Pennsylvania convertible <span style="color: #0000FF;">335</span>%,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
due on Nov. 1, 1912, selling at 94. $ 940<br/>
Left in <span style="color: #ff0000;">bank.. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>60<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Total </span>$ 1,000<br/>
<br/>
The price is the quotation ruling at the time<br/>
this article is written. It may vary, either way,<br/>
before the article is printed. A commission<br/>
to the banker is included in it. This is very<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">small-about </span>$ 1.25.<br/>
<br/>
Examining such a transaction, the points of<br/>
advantage will become clear. In the savings<br/>
bank, the annual interest is $ 30. From the<br/>
bonds, the annual interest is $ 35, paid in two<br/>
instalments on November Ist and May Ist.<br/>
Supposing that the bonds are held until they<br/>
come due, on November 1, 1912, and are then<br/>
cashed, the proceeds are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>principal $ 1,000.00<br/>
From interest (simple) 192.50<br/>
Total<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>$ 1,192.50<br/>
Add amount left in bank<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">60.00<br/>
</span>Simple interest at 3% 9.00<br/>
Total....... $ 1,261.50<br/>
Amount <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>in bank, with simple interest at 3% 1,150.00<br/>
Profit through investment <span style="color: #ff0000;">_.. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So<br/>
<br/>
</span>If anyone cares to work out the difference<br/>
at compound interest, reckoned in the case of<br/>
the bonds by depositing the $ 17.50 interest on<br/>
each November Ist and May Ist to draw 3<br/>
per cent. interest in the savings bank, it is not<br/>
difficult to do so.<br/>
<br/>
No one in the United States expects that the<br/>
Pennsylvania Railroad will fail to pay these<br/>
interest instalments when they fall due, or to<br/>
pay the principal in 1912. It follows that the<br/>
investment is to all intents and purposes<br/>
absolutely safe. Dozens of other investments<br/>
equally safe may be selected. This particular<br/>
bond is here used merely because it has seemed<br/>
good to recommend it from time to time to<br/>
individual enquirers, and because no question<br/>
of safety is likely to arise against it in the mind<br/>
of any critic<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
