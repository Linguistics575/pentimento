Unless a fact is labeled, we do <span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
</span>recognize its importance, and if it is<br/>
labeled in letters of sufficient size we recognize<br/>
it whether it be really important or not. We<br/>
shout ourselves hoarse over the relief of a town<br/>
that should never have been defended; we<br/>
grow hysterical over a <span style="color: #ff0000;">cold-bloodecl </span>murderer<br/>
until our even more hysterical ministers commute his entirely just punishment. Our perspective is entirely wrong. We thrust ourselves unabashed upon our great men; we<br/>
allow our Lttle men to thrust themselves unabashed upon ourselves. A man who has<br/>
rendered service in his generation to the causes<br/>
which our generation represents-and no man<br/>
can do more-is, as often as not, allowed to<br/>
die neglected and perhaps in poverty. But<br/>
thirty years later, up he goes in bronze, though<br/>
the work he did, the difficulties he faced, the<br/>
ideals he brought down to live on earth, are all<br/>
as tinkling brass to the dull <span style="color: #0000FF;">aftercomers </span>who,<br/>
thanks to him, start where he gave up his work.<br/>
The only great work that man can do in this<br/>
world is to hand on his torch alight.<br/>
<br/>
LORD CROMER IN EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
Quite quietly and without further trumpetings and salutes than an official eulogy from<br/>
those whose servant he has been for four and<br/>
twenty <span style="color: #ff0000;">yearp-and </span>the usual fifteen-gun salute<br/>
as his train steamed out from Cairo-the one<br/>
absolute monarch in the world to-day, and<br/>
probably the greatest of living benefactors to<br/>
his kind, resigned his throne on May 6th.<br/>
There is never a crowned head east or west of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues </span>which possesses the unconditioned autocracy which Lord Cromer has just laid down.<br/>
The circumstances have had no parallel in<br/>
modern times; in ancient history the man<br/>
himself recalls no prototype. That reserved<br/>
man, known to everyone in Cairo and known<br/>
by almost none, exercised an <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>invisible<br/>
<br/>
and omnipresent without display, without<br/>
argument, without appeal.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a new visitor from the United<br/>
States who spoke to me under the great <span style="color: #ff0000;">bougainvillca </span>in the garden of the German Church in<br/>
the Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Manakh</span>. He was greatly puzzled<br/>
about a notice he had seen that morning.<br/>
So far as he could remember, it set out that as it<br/>
had seemed good to the Agent (no reason<br/>
given) to close half a dozen elementary schools<br/>
(of which a list was named), those elementary<br/>
schools thereby were and would <span style="color: #0000FF;">thenceforward<br/>
</span>remain shut.<br/>
<br/>
"Just'shut' and no more about it.<br/>
who in is this Agent? I never heard of<br/>
such a thing. Just'shut!' It's more like<br/>
Genesis than anything I have struck yet."<br/>
<br/>
I explained that the Agent was the British<br/>
Consul-General.<br/>
<br/>
"Well," he said, "and what of that? Our<br/>
Consul-General Long doesn't go about shutting<br/>
up elementary schools. Why, it would be<br/>
bad form in an ambassador."<br/>
<br/>
I told him that the British Consul-General<br/>
was also Lord Cromer, and his face lightened.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought he was a Viceroy, or something<br/>
like that," he explained; and, much comforted,<br/>
he took a tram to see real Eastern romance in<br/>
the Muski. There has been, since 1883, more<br/>
Eastern romance at the Agency than in all the<br/>
Cairene bazaars put together. But you have<br/>
to be able to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Still, my <span style="color: #0000FF;">American</span>'s remark seemed in some<br/>
ways a happy one. It is because Lord Cromer<br/>
has observed the ways of Genesis that he has<br/>
been so entirely successful.<br/>
<br/>
Why, one is tempted to ask, has Lord <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cromer<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>succeeded where Cleopatra and Napoleon<br/>
failed? Because, to an extent with.which <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>has never yet been credited, he has been able<br/>
to understand and willing to identify himself with the timid but <span style="color: #0000FF;">eternal </span>prejudices of<br/>
that backbone of Egypt, the despised <span style="color: #ff0000;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
