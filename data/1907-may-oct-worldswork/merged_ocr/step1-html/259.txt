<span>THE SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE<br/>
<br/>
affairs generally reach a point where the menace<br/>
outweighs the promised benefit, and capital<br/>
learns its lesson quickly.<br/>
<br/>
JAPAN AND THE PEACE OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ENERAL </span>KUROKI was received in the<br/>
United States everywhere with real<br/>
admiration as well as with pardonable curiosity;<br/>
and everywhere he went he called forth expressions of friendliness to himself and to his<br/>
country. For instance, the formation of a<br/>
Japan Society in New York, a club to preserve<br/>
and to encourage the most friendly relations<br/>
between the two countries, was a graceful<br/>
indication of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cordiality</span>.<br/>
<br/>
But the visit of this distinguished Japanese<br/>
General and of the naval officers who made us<br/>
a brief visit has set going much diplomatic<br/>
speculation about the part that Japan will<br/>
play in world-politics. The friendly <span style="color: #ff0000;">compacts </span>between England and Japan and France<br/>
and Japan; the probability of Japan's building<br/>
up an influence in South America by immigration and by trade; the pressure of Japanese<br/>
immigration eastward to the Philippines, the<br/>
Hawaiian Islands, and the United States; the<br/>
part that Japan may play in the development<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">China-those </span>and such subjects have come<br/>
up for renewed discussion and speculation<br/>
throughout the whole Western world.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of the absurdity of the talk that was<br/>
heard months ago about the danger of a<br/>
breach of friendly relations between the United<br/>
States and Japan because of the San Francisco<br/>
school incident, expressions of remote <span style="color: #0000FF;">apprehension </span>still crop out here and there. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>reminded that the inevitable race-feeling would<br/>
assert itself if Japanese immigration were to<br/>
become great; we are reminded that, as the<br/>
Japanese discovered that they were taken<br/>
seriously by the world as soon as they showed<br/>
good warlike qualities, they may conclude that<br/>
another war in due <span style="color: #0000FF;">time-when </span>they can afford<br/>
to pay for it-would increase their prestige<br/>
still more, and that the stronger the nation with<br/>
whom they <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight</span>, the greater the glory would<br/>
be. We are reminded, too, that their industrial development may be an annoyance to our<br/>
trade-interests.<br/>
<br/>
In every one of these apprehensions that<br/>
find expression, now here and now there, there<br/>
may be both a logical error and a misinterpretation of popular feeling on both sides; for there<br/>
are a hundred good reasons why the future<br/>
should have nothing but peace, to every sound<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9057<br/>
<br/>
</span>reason why it should have war in store for us.<br/>
But it is well for thoughtful men to remember<br/>
that there is in these days of a closely-knit<br/>
world only one very serious danger of war<br/>
between civilized nations; and that is the<br/>
growth of an inflamed public opinion or <span style="color: #0000FF;">prejudice </span>in one nation against another. Kings<br/>
and other rulers are becoming increasingly"<br/>
powerless to cause war, even when they are<br/>
so inclined. Grievances and open offences,<br/>
if they <span style="color: #0000FF;">arc </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">definite</span>, are usually settled and<br/>
removed by diplomacy so long as public<br/>
opinion is quiescent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">.But </span>danger lurks chiefly<br/>
in the moods and prejudices of the people.<br/>
The thing of prime importance to the future<br/>
of Japan (and for that matter of the United<br/>
States also) is that the people shall not receive<br/>
wrong notions about international prestige<br/>
or about the character and purposes of other<br/>
races. For this reason, it is probably true that<br/>
the most dangerous influence in the world <span style="color: #0000FF;">today</span>, in every nation, is the "yellow" press,<br/>
because it never makes for calmness but always<br/>
for popular excitement.<br/>
<br/>
But happily General Kuroki's visit has<br/>
called forth in all the Western countries the<br/>
friendliest expressions to Japan; and, if there<br/>
be real danger to the peace of the world in<br/>
Japanese ambition, or in any possible opposition to Japan's legitimate development, it is<br/>
a danger that lies far in the future.<br/>
<br/>
THE SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>HE second Hague Conference of <span style="color: #ff0000;">repre<br/>
</span>sentatives of all the chief Powers <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds<br/>
</span>the world in a very different mood from the<br/>
mood that prevailed when the first Conference<br/>
met. Then any concerted movement looking<br/>
toward the prevention of war was regarded as<br/>
an impracticable dream.<br/>
<br/>
The Tribunal created by the Conference was<br/>
regarded as an impractical and academic thing.<br/>
But it has settled international differences,<br/>
and the practicability of arbitration has steadily<br/>
won its way in the minds of men and of nations.<br/>
It is true that there have been two great wars<br/>
in recent years-the Boer war and the Japanese war with Russia; but the agitation for<br/>
the peaceful settlement of international differences has nevertheless made unexpected<br/>
and most remarkable progress.<br/>
<br/>
Such events as the growth of the Interparliamentary Union, the great Peace Conference recently held in New York, the widening influence of the annual conferences for<br/>
