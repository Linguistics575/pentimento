<br/>
consider that many of the best Siberian furs are<br/>
hunted by Siberian exiles from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chuckchee<br/>
</span>Peninsula to China, it is seen that the romance<br/>
of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>is as glamorous as that hanging over<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">canoeman </span>of Canadian rivers, or the sea<br/>
otter hunter of the Aleutians, or the lawless<br/>
dare-devil poacher of the seal islands.<br/>
<br/>
I know of no way to reckon what the volume<br/>
of the world's fur trade may be, even at a wild<br/>
guess. Let me explain why. Canada, which<br/>
has been called <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1vorld</span>'s fur preserve," now<br/>
yearly exports about $ 2,500,000 worth of furs.<br/>
But this does not include Alaska, which<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">FUR </span>TRADE OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
sends out $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">500,000 </span>worth a year, nor the<br/>
Moravian missionaries of Labrador, who send<br/>
out some of the best pelts in the world.<br/>
Neither does it include the seal islands which,<br/>
up to 1890, must have shipped out $ 2,000,000<br/>
worth of furs a year. Put the value of furs<br/>
north of the 49th parallel at $ 6,000,000, and<br/>
you have not included what has been used for<br/>
the home market. While the rarest furs are<br/>
exported to be dressed and manufactured, the<br/>
common furs are dressed and manufactured<br/>
at home; and the aggregate value of the cheapest <span style="color: #0000FF;">fur-muskrat-equals </span>the aggregate value<br/>
of the rarest fur. For instance, in 1883, when<br/>
the Hudson's Bay Company sold 47,500 of<br/>
marten, they sold 1,000,000 muskrat. How<br/>
many muskrats were kept for home use in<br/>
Canada, it is impossible to tell. The same<br/>
may be said of raccoon and badger and otter.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to consider the American<br/>
market, the facts are still more confusing; for<br/>
Canadian furs bought by American shippers at<br/>
St. Paul, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York are<br/>
shipped from American ports classified as<br/>
American furs. Experts state that $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">5,000,000<br/>
</span>of furs are sold by auction in London every<br/>
year; but that does not cover the sale of furs<br/>
by private contracts, which often takes place<br/>
when the price is either especially high or very<br/>
low. Nor does it cover the sales of furs which<br/>
some of the great houses collect in the raw state<br/>
and manufacture for themselves without putting<br/>
the raw furs on the market at <span style="color: #0000FF;">all<br/>
