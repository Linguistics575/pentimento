<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE<br/>
<br/>
</span>I may be allowed to speak with some positiveness. For two years I was State Health<br/>
Officer of Oregon, and one of my first duties<br/>
was a thorough investigation of the Chinatowns<br/>
of San Francisco and Portland with reference<br/>
to the bubonic plague, which was at that time<br/>
smouldering in the former city. If there was<br/>
anything in these colonies that I did not see, it<br/>
was my own fault, as I was always courteously<br/>
accompanied by Federal, state or <span style="color: #0000FF;">municipal </span>officers. When in search of a suspected<br/>
case of plague, every door which was not<br/>
promptly opened on demand was smashed in<br/>
with an axe. In addition, I have been for<br/>
years keenly interested both in tropical <span style="color: #0000FF;">diseases </span>and in the forms assumed by European<br/>
diseases in Oriental races.<br/>
<br/>
I have no hesitation in saying that neither<br/>
the Chinese nor the Japanese has a single <span style="color: #ff0000;">dis<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>or vice which does not exist among white<br/>
men, except certain geographical infections like<br/>
beri-beri, nor is he subject to them in any<br/>
higher degree than white men of his grade of<br/>
intelligence. Leprosy, for instance, is no more<br/>
prevalent among them than it was in Norway<br/>
and Sweden fifty years ago, and in Scotland and<br/>
Ireland 150 years ago. More lepers have<br/>
actually come into the United States from<br/>
northern Europe than from all Asia, and since<br/>
the United States Marine Hospital Service<br/>
began inspecting intending immigrants in<br/>
Chinese ports, scarcely a single case has entered<br/>
by any Pacific port. Whatever danger threatened from this disease is already abolished.<br/>
<br/>
The same may be said of any further danger<br/>
from the bubonic plague. While both Chinese<br/>
and Japanese suffer severely from tuberculosis,<br/>
this is little more prevalent among them than<br/>
among Irish, Scandinavians, Italians, Russians,<br/>
or Hungarians, and can with equal readiness be<br/>
absolutely excluded by competent sanitary<br/>
inspection and quarantine regulations. Diseases peculiar to men are neither more frequent<br/>
nor more virulent among them than among<br/>
white <span style="color: #0000FF;">siren </span>of the same class. Most cases have<br/>
been contracted since coming to this country.<br/>
<br/>
The sanitary (or, more properly, insanitary)<br/>
conditions of Chinatowns are only such as<br/>
result from overcrowding. The chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in the way of their complete removal is the<br/>
shameful opposition of the white owners of the<br/>
property, <span style="color: #ff0000;">manyof </span>them pillars of society and<br/>
of the church, whose enormous revenues from<br/>
the rookeries are in direct ratio to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">number<br/>
</span>of tenants they can crowd into them. Money<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">AS </span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">WORKINGMAN </span>9375<br/>
greed and the dishonesty of politicians and<br/>
police who blackmail its vices and necessities<br/>
are the sole hindrance to the cleansing of these<br/>
"Oriental plague-spots."<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese contribute to the situation<br/>
simply by their patient submission to overcrowding and their willingness to pay rent for<br/>
space in which a white man would <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffocate<br/>
</span>Contrary to popular impression, they are not<br/>
dirty in their personal habits. I have physically examined scores of Chinese and Japanese,<br/>
and they strip cleaner than any European immigrants of their class. Their bedrooms are<br/>
neatly kept and their kitchens are cleaner than<br/>
those of the average restaurant. In fact, they<br/>
must be clean, as a matter of stern survival<br/>
necessity. I have frequently seen inside-rooms<br/>
fifteen feet square, without windows or <span style="color: #ff0000;">airshafts</span>,<br/>
their only opening being a door into a dark,<br/>
narrow passage, in which cooked, ate, and<br/>
slept ten to twelve Chinese; and yet there was<br/>
little or no offensive odor.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese and Japanese servants are models<br/>
of neatness and cleanliness and usually report<br/>
for duty in white duck jackets. They keep<br/>
both kitchens and bedrooms far cleaner than<br/>
the average foreign-born hired girl.<br/>
<br/>
Any Chinatown can be kept in good sanitary<br/>
condition, merely by a little energetic and<br/>
honest health-policing and by enforcing the<br/>
building and lodging-house laws already in<br/>
existence. Make the owners of the property<br/>
pay a special <span style="color: #ff0000;">license-tax </span>out of their enormous<br/>
rentals, use this to provide a special sanitary<br/>
inspector, and the thing is done. Chinese<br/>
stand in holy fear of the law and its <span style="color: #ff0000;">officers</span>, and<br/>
one or two lessons would be enough. They<br/>
take very kindly to overcrowding; if permitted<br/>
they will take a room or Mor, "split" it into<br/>
two stories, if the ceilings are more than twelve<br/>
feet high, by putting in an extra Mor six feet<br/>
above the original one. If the ceiling is lower,<br/>
they build tiers of bunks clear to the top, with<br/>
perhaps a gallery four feet below it. These<br/>
quarters are then sublet to a dozen or a score<br/>
of sub-tenants. But a <span style="color: #0000FF;">few </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arrests </span>and a tearing out of these "improvements" would soon<br/>
stop all this. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hey </span>do not love overcrowding<br/>
and dirt for their own sake, but merely put up<br/>
with them to save money; the rooms of the<br/>
more intelligent and wealthy Chinese are often<br/>
light, airy, and spotlessly clean.<br/>
<br/>
Many disgusting things are to be seen in our<br/>
Chinatowns, but nothing that cannot be<br/>
matched in any city slum or "<span style="color: #0000FF;">tenderloin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>"<br/>
