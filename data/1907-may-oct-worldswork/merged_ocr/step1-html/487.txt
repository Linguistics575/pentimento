tion of the body as a thing of little account or of<br/>
worse than no value, a thing to be punished and<br/>
suppressed! But the sweeping and pleasing<br/>
thought that a higher civilization lies in the<br/>
direction that we are now going is warranted;<br/>
and its attainment will not be long postponed<br/>
if well-balanced physical training and healthful<br/>
living become general enough. The "physical<br/>
conscience" and "the sense of health" are<br/>
among the most important senses of mankind.<br/>

A SCULPTOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>ENDURING FAME<br/>
<br/>
Y THE death of Augustus Saint Gaudens,<br/>
on August 3rd, the country lost not<br/>
only its most distinguished sculptor but one<br/>
whose influence had a very real effect upon the<br/>
growth of artistic taste in public and private<br/>
life. For while in his own art he was the first<br/>
to represent the value of the modern system<br/>
of Parisian training, he also was the intimate<br/>
of architects and painters who, returning from<br/>
the schools of Paris thirty years ago, established<br/>
new standards of taste and technical proficiency. Their example has been followed by<br/>
thousands, until now throughout the country<br/>
there are evidences of the improved conditions<br/>
in monumental and domestic buildings, and<br/>
in their external and interior embellishments.<br/>
<br/>
Before the entrance of Saint Gaudens into<br/>
public recognition, on the occasion of the unveiling of his "Farragut" in 1881, the trend of<br/>
American students of sculpture had been<br/>
toward Rome and imitation of the antique<br/>
had served them as a motive. But Saint<br/>
Gaudens went to Paris, and in the studio of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jouffrey </span>came under the modern system of<br/>
teaching that was based upon the study of life.<br/>
It was a rigorous discipline for eye and hand,<br/>
but he had already proved his capacity for hard<br/>
work by the practice for six years of the craft<br/>
of cameo-cutting, attending meanwhile the<br/>
evening classes at the Cooper Union and<br/>
National Academy. His course at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jouffrey's<br/>
</span>completed, he spent three years in Italy, being<br/>
especially attracted by the works of Donatello<br/>
and the early Florentine<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Their simple and<br/>
sincere rendering of nature corresponded with<br/>
the teachings of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jouffrey </span>and with the promptings of his own temperament.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as his "Farragut" appeared, it was<br/>
recognized that its unqualified naturalness and<br/>
the atmosphere of character with which it was<br/>
invested set a new and a higher standard. He<br/>
has since given the country a series of memorial statues-Lincoln, Sherman, Peter Cooper,<br/>
<br/>
9285<br/>
<br/>
Shaw, and others; for their extraordinary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fidelity </span>of portraiture and their exalted suggestion, these challenge rivalry with the finest<br/>
European sculpture of the nineteenth century.<br/>
<br/>
For Saint Gaudens had to a rare degree the<br/>
essentially artistic faculty of what has been<br/>
called the "plastic mind." He felt and thought<br/>
in terms of form, and his intelligence and<br/>
imagination alike expressed themselves naturally and completely in modeled surfaces. He<br/>
needed no accessories to make his meaning<br/>
clear to others as to himself; for his comprehension of a subject was purely and exclusively artistic, without the slightest strain<br/>
of literary or anecdotal tendency. His business was to model a figure and in the modeling<br/>
itself to express the sentiment with which the<br/>
original impressed him. The measure of his<br/>
distinction consisted less in the excellence of<br/>
technique, for this he shared with other sculptors, than in his wonderful capacity of seeing<br/>
the significance in form and of interpreting it<br/>
purely through form. It was this which gave<br/>
to every thing to which he set his hand both a<br/>
tangible and an elusive dignity. A supreme<br/>
example is his "Lincoln." Compared with<br/>
it, almost all other representations seem <span style="color: #0000FF;">commonplace</span>, while none approaches its impressiveness. And a similar genius for including<br/>
the spiritual personality in the physical is the<br/>
distinctive characteristic of all his works. A<br/>
review of these appeared in THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">WORLD'S<br/>
</span>WORK, February, 1904; since that date a statue<br/>
of Charles Stewart Parnell, has been unveiled<br/>
in Dublin. Practically his last finished work<br/>
was the designing of the new gold coins soon<br/>
to be issued by the Government.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>DIRECTIONS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>COLLEGE GROWTH<br/>
<br/>
EVERAL changes, distinct enough to be<br/>
noted, are taking place in the growth of<br/>
<br/>
our colleges and universities. First of all, a<br/>
number of them have increased in attendance<br/>
during the last <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years as much as 20 per<br/>
ccnt.-a very remarkable fact. In 1903, only<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">three-Harvard</span>, Columbia, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chicago-had </span>an attendance of more than 4,000 students.<br/>
To-day Cornell and the Universities of Michigan and Minnesota fall into the same category.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>six largest universities of the country are<br/>
distributed equally over the East and the West.<br/>
The phenomenal growth of the prominent<br/>
Western institutions has not been, as is sometimes supposed, at the expense of their older<br/>
Eastern rivals. The percentage of <span style="color: #ff0000;">students<br/>
