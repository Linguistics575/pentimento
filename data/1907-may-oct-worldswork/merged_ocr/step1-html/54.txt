men began to draw in the lines of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">busi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ness, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>to get out of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">speculative </span>enterprises. Mr. Frick's partners joined<br/>
the rush to cover, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>& Company was<br/>
one of the concerns from which they struggled<br/>
to be free.<br/>
<br/>
This was young Frick's opportunity, and he<br/>
demonstrated two of his vital characteristics:<br/>
faith in the ultimate returns from the possession<br/>
of any primary commodity of trade, and the<br/>
courage to back his faith. The uses of coke<br/>
at that time were few, but he saw a great future<br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, instead of abandoning his company, young Frick wrote to Judge Thomas<br/>
Mellon, a wealthy banker of Pittsburg, asking<br/>
for a loan of $ 10,000. Judge Mellon commissioned Mr. J. B. Corey to go to the coke<br/>
district and report on the security offered by<br/>
this unknown would-be borrower.<br/>
<br/>
THE FIRST FEAT IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">FINANCE<br/>
<br/>
</span>At his destination Mr. Corey asked for young<br/>
Frick. He was directed to a little <span style="color: #ff0000;">cokeburner</span>'s cabin nearby. The cabin he found<br/>
contained two tiny rooms, one used as an<br/>
office and the other as sleeping quarters; but<br/>
both were fastidiously neat and arranged with<br/>
systematic orderliness. Here he found a <span style="color: #ff0000;">cleanshaven </span>boy, who admitted that he was the<br/>
author of the request for $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000 </span>The principal collateral he had to offer was the future<br/>
he believed to be in his business and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">invincible </span>faith in himself, in brief, his cool, quiet<br/>
"nerve." Mr. Corey spent the day and that<br/>
night with Frick. He found him alert, clearheaded, straightforward. He knew the business for which he needed money, and he<br/>
convinced Mr. Corey of its future. He got<br/>
the money. It was a good investment. Ever<br/>
since that time Mr. Frick's <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>has aided<br/>
the Mellons, and to-day the Mellons National<br/>
Bank of Pittsburg is one of the most powerful<br/>
institutions in Pennsylvania. And the boy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to.whom </span>Judge Mellon lent $ 10,000 on his<br/>
word Can <span style="color: #ff0000;">borrew </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tm,000,000 </span>to-day as easily<br/>
on the same security.<br/>
<br/>
With this capital, Mr. Frick bought out his<br/>
timid partners. Coke was down to ninety<br/>
cents a ton. Other men in the coke busi,<br/>
ness as gladly sold him their coal beds and<br/>
ovens.<br/>
<br/>
The panic subsided. The price of coke<br/>
rose to $ 4, even <span style="color: #ff0000;">$ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>, a ton, and Mr. Frick's<br/>
holdings made <span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span>a millionaire before<br/>
<br/>
FRICK, THE SILENT<br/>
<br/>
he was thirty years old. In 1878 he sold an<br/>
interest in the business to Mr. E. M. Ferguson,<br/>
of New York, and later another interest to<br/>
Mr. Ferguson's brother. The business grew<br/>
in prosperity, without incident until 1882, when<br/>
it was reorganized under the name of the H. C.<br/>
Frick Coke Company, with a capitalization<br/>
of $ 2,000,000. The new company now owned<br/>
3,000 acres of coal beds and 1,026 ovens.<br/>
<br/>
PARTNERSHIP <span style="color: #0000FF;">WITH </span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">CARNEGIES<br/>
<br/>
</span>With the reorganization Mr. Frick entered<br/>
upon the second era of his career, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">encountered </span>a personality that has supplied the motive<br/>
of much of his later life, first by encouragement,<br/>
next by rivalry, and later by open hostility<br/>
and warfare. The new era began with the<br/>
selling of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-interest </span>in the H. C. Frick<br/>
Coke Company to Carnegie Brothers of Pittsburg. The personality that has influenced<br/>
Mr. Frick's career is that of Mr. Andrew<br/>
Carnegie.<br/>
<br/>
Until 1882 Mr. Frick had been a dealer in<br/>
coke. Now, in exchange for an interest in<br/>
his coke business, he was admitted to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firm<br/>
</span>of Carnegie Brothers, and began a new career<br/>
as a manufacturer of steel. This action was<br/>
a fair test of Mr. Frick's foresight in his coke<br/>
enterprise. His holdings had made him <span style="color: #0000FF;">indispensable </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Camegies </span>in their expanding<br/>
steel business, where coke is necessary to reduce<br/>
the iron ores.<br/>
<br/>
In 1883 the capital of the H. C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>Coke<br/>
Company was increased to $ 3,000,000. By<br/>
1886 the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carnegie </span>had acquired a majority<br/>
interest in the company through the retirement<br/>
of two of Mr. Frick's partners. In 1887, they<br/>
ordered a settlement with striking coke burners<br/>
that seemed to Mr. Frick to implicate him in a<br/>
breach of faith with other coke companies that<br/>
had combined to resist the strikers. Mr.<br/>
Frick therefore resigned from the presidency<br/>
of the H. C. Frick Coke Company, though he<br/>
retained his interest both in that company and<br/>
in Carnegie Brothers. An idea of the value<br/>
of his holdings in the former company (nearly<br/>
a half-interest) may be got from the fact that<br/>
it now owned <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5,000 </span>acres of coal lands, 10,000<br/>
ovens, 35 miles of railroad, and 1,200 cars,<br/>
and that it employed <span style="color: #0000FF;">11,000 </span>men who produced<br/>
1,100 cars of coke a day.<br/>
