<br/>
</span>of labor to pick the cotton from the plant.<br/>
While it is foolish to make <span style="color: #0000FF;">definite </span>predictions<br/>
about mechanical inventions, it does seem<br/>
reasonable to conclude that a machine will be<br/>
perfected at some early time which will do at<br/>
least the greater part of this work. There are<br/>
machines made after three or four models which<br/>
now do it imperfectly; and all through the<br/>
Southern States men who have seriously studied<br/>
this mechanical problem are of one mind about<br/>
it, that within a reasonable period a practicable<br/>
machine will be invented. It ought to be<br/>
said, however, that the great majority of people<br/>
still look upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">it-as </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uponthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flying-machine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>an impossible thing to perfect.<br/>
<br/>
The invention of a cheap practicable machine for picking cotton would go far toward<br/>
solving the problem of labor in this region.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem that we encounter here is<br/>
the relation of the races. For it is this part of<br/>
the United States that is more densely populated by Negroes than any other part. It is<br/>
here, too, that the Negroes are most backward; but it ought to be remembered always<br/>
that both Negroes and whites in this region<br/>
constitute so sparse a population that the conditions of labor, or the social conditions that<br/>
are now found there, are not a fair indication<br/>
of the conditions that will prevail after there<br/>
has been a large influx of white immigration,<br/>
the coming of which is inevitable. Then the<br/>
conditions, both as regards labor and as regards the race relations, will gradually come<br/>
to be what they are in the somewhat more<br/>
elevated regions of the South.<br/>
<br/>
In all these long reports of Southern progress,<br/>
no separate word has been said about the Negro.<br/>
He contributes to it and he shares it in varying<br/>
degrees in different communities. His capacity<br/>
to profit by opportunity is well shown in this<br/>
report by Mr. Emmett J. Scott of the success<br/>
of the Southern Improvement Company, near<br/>
Tuskegee, Ala., organized seven years ago by<br/>
Alexander Purves, then treasurer of Hampton<br/>
Normal and Agricultural Institute.<br/>
<br/>
The company <span style="color: #0000FF;">bought </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4,000 </span>acres of land adjoining the farm of Tuskegee Institute at<br/>
Tuskegee, Ala. This land was generally regarded as useless for agricultural purposes,<br/>
and was purchased at prices ranging from four<br/>
to six dollars an acre. A sawmill was erected<br/>
and the settlers were given an opportunity to<br/>
earn enough money to provide for themselves<br/>
and make a first payment on the land.<br/>
<br/>
It was not so easy to obtain settlers. These<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9035<br/>
<br/>
</span>almost barren sand-hills held out but a poor<br/>
prospect to Negro farmers who had found it<br/>
hard to get ahead even on the "fat land."<br/>
In some cases it was necessary, in order to<br/>
obtain the farmers the company needed, to<br/>
"buy them out of debt."<br/>
<br/>
It was determined at the outset that every<br/>
man should have a piece of woodland and a<br/>
house. The first two-room cottage cost about<br/>
$ 165. Later, with the increased price of building material, they have been valued at $ 200.<br/>
At the present time, there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy-eight<br/>
</span>houses on the company's land. This land has<br/>
increased in the meantime from 60 per cent.<br/>
to 150 per cent. in value.<br/>
<br/>
While the men are paying for their land the<br/>
company advances them money, when necessary, at 8 per cent., charging them, however,<br/>
only for the time they have the money. In<br/>
this matter of interest, therefore, the company has been able to make a considerable<br/>
saving to its farmers. The company also buys<br/>
fertilizer in quantities and sells it to its farmers<br/>
at prices considerably less than they could<br/>
purchase it elsewhere. It is one of the conditions of the contract under which the land<br/>
is purchased that, during the process of payment, the farming must be done under the<br/>
direction of the company.<br/>
<br/>
One of the farmers received, after all payments were deducted, $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">32 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>from the company<br/>
-an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unusually </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>earning for a farmer in the<br/>
circumstances in which these men are. Nearly<br/>
all of this land will be paid for next year. The<br/>
company ginned this year <span style="color: #ff0000;">goo </span>bales of cotton,<br/>
though only 600 bales were raised on the community's land. Some of the community farmers have been able to raise on this poor land<br/>
more than a bale an acre, which is four times<br/>
the average yield per acre of the whole state of<br/>
Alabama. Some of the tracts are small, not<br/>
more than twenty acres. The plan was to<br/>
give each man as much land as it was believed<br/>
he could conveniently work at a profit. Some<br/>
of the settlers have already paid for their land.<br/>
Only two of the seventy-eight have been compelled to give up. It is expected that all of<br/>
the settlers now on the soil will pay for their<br/>
land within the time fixed by their contract<br/>
with the company, which is seven years.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN THE IMMIGRANT COMES<br/>
<br/>
For the present, the greater part of Arkansas<br/>
and of western Tennessee, of Mississippi, and<br/>
of Louisiana require the engineer and the<br/>
