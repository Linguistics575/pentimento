<span>A <span style="color: #ff0000;">JOURNEY<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">THROUGH </span>THE SOUTHERN <span style="color: #0000FF;">STATES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>jury, and sheriff, kept all the active forces of<br/>
society separated from one another. They<br/>
are now uniting. In the large cities you not<br/>
only find new skyscrapers, and more of them;<br/>
new <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufacturing </span>enterprises and more of<br/>
them; an enormous increase both in the number of banks and in the money handled by the<br/>
old ones; but you tind that industrial activity<br/>
in all these places is linked with industrial<br/>
activity elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago, a man from Boston or New<br/>
York who went into the South was compelled<br/>
to feel in certain senses that he was going into<br/>
a foreign country. In order to get this <span style="color: #0000FF;">feeling<br/>
</span>now, you must go into some very remote rural<br/>
region. In bidding goodbye to a gentleman<br/>
who had shown me many attentions in a little<br/>
country town in central Georgia-a town to<br/>
which, a few years ago, a stranger seldom went<br/>
and from which you could readily believe the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">w.</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">-<br/>
</span>residents seldom <span style="color: #ff0000;">ventured-f </span>asked him to<br/>
come and see me in New York. He replied<br/>
that business took him to New York once a<br/>
month, and that he would be glad to call the<br/>
following week.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere you find the trains <span style="color: #ff0000;">crowdednot </span>merely on the great routes of tourist travel,<br/>
but on the roads where the travel is local.<br/>
Almost everywhere the hotels are <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled</span>, little<br/>
hotels and big; and if you are prudent you will<br/>
engage your room before your arrival. There<br/>
has been nothing less than a revolution, by<br/>
the way, in the hotels themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The general impression, therefore, that one<br/>
brings away after two or three months' journey<br/>
to these states and to these country regions,<br/>
this year, is not only an impression of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cheerfulness</span>, of prosperity, of extraordinary material<br/>
progress; but a deep-rooted feeling that there<br/>
had been for a long weary time, not only <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>ONE OF THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">GREAT </span>CIGAR <span style="color: #0000FF;">FACTORIES-AT </span>TAMPA<br/>
<br/>
In 1905, Tampa manufactured 220,430,000 cigars, worth more than $ 15,000,000<br/>
