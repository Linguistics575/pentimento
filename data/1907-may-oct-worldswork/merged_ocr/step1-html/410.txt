side of another ridge, because the south side<br/>
is rock while the north side is loam. He may<br/>
narrow the choice of mountain passes to two or<br/>
three. Occasionally, he will select the pass,<br/>
as General Dodge selected the Sherman Pass<br/>
by which the railroad crosses the Black Hills.<br/>
<br/>
THE FIRST SURVEY AND THE "LOCATION"<br/>
<br/>
When the reports of all the <span style="color: #ff0000;">reconnaisances<br/>
</span>are digested, the preliminary survey begins.<br/>
This is usually in detail, but it is not quite<br/>
final. In the case of the new Tidewater<br/>
Railroad, in Virginia, these surveys left a choice<br/>
on some divisions between as many as twelve<br/>
routes to be decided by the chief engineers and<br/>
the directors. Each alternative route, however,<br/>
is fully detailed. For instance, if the survey<br/>
shows a cut through a hill, it is supposed to<br/>
show also whether the cut is through rock,<br/>
sand, clay, shale, loam, or any other substance.<br/>
Grades are carefully figured, as also curvature,<br/>
bridges, fills, and cuts.<br/>
<br/>
The next step is the location of the line.<br/>
This is decided from the surveys. The report<br/>
of the location must be in the fullest detail, every<br/>
hollow, every rock, every river being minutely<br/>
examined and measured. The letting of the<br/>
contracts for construction is based upon this<br/>
location. If an engineer errs by so much as<br/>
reporting a ledge of shale in the side of a hill<br/>
instead of a ledge of granite, this mistake<br/>
throws out the estimate of "first cost" by just<br/>
so much. On a single mile of road, that one<br/>
mistake may make a difference of nearly<br/>
$ 10,000 in the cost of construction.<br/>
<br/>
So much for the routine by which the placing<br/>
of a new line is accomplished. It is very simple, of course. If there is one thing that stands<br/>
out from it quite clearly, it is that the effectiveness of this routine and the perfection of the<br/>
work accomplished through it depend directly<br/>
upon the men who put it into execution. That<br/>
points to the civil engineer.<br/>
<br/>
The cream of this profession rises thin. It<br/>
is a strange and interesting fact that nearly all<br/>
the great railroads through the Rocky Mountains were surveyed and carried through by the<br/>
same men. Of course, each system had some<br/>
new men, but the backbone of the staff in each<br/>
instance seems to have been composed of the<br/>
engineers who ran <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Union </span>Pacific and the Central Pacific to a junction at Promontory, Utah, in<br/>
1869. They met again at Sierra Blanca when<br/>
Mr. Gould's Texas <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacific </span>joined Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Huntington</span>'s Southern Pacific, and yet again on<br/>

the Santa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fe</span>, the Northern Pacific and the<br/>
Canadian Pacific when the rails from the West<br/>
met the rails from the East. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0-day</span>, most of<br/>
these veterans are gone, but here and there one<br/>
may be found holding an honorable post.<br/>
For instance, Mr. Robert <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bliekensderfer</span>, consulting engineer of the Wheeling & Lake Erie<br/>
at Pittsburg, helped to build the Santa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fe</span>, the<br/>
Missouri Pacific, the St. Louis & San Francisco, and the Union Pacific. General Dodge<br/>
was a factor in building the Union Pacific, the<br/>
Texas Pacific, the Fort Worth & Denver City,<br/>
and the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railroads.<br/>
<br/>
SOME DANCERS OF A RECONNAISSANCE<br/>
<br/>
Let us start with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>reconnaissance of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>transcontinental line, the Union Pacific.<br/>
It was headed by Peter A. Dey, with Grenville<br/>
M. Dodge as first assistant. They crossed the<br/>
Missouri River at the point where Omaha now<br/>
stands, and General Dodge will not commit<br/>
himself as to whether they used a raft or a<br/>
flat-boat. In any case, it was no palatial ferry.<br/>
They struck out into a howling wild. One<br/>
incident will serve very well to illustrate the<br/>
nature of the expedition and the country. It<br/>
is told by the General himself in a speech that<br/>
he made in 1888, a copy of which he gave to<br/>
the writer for use in this connection:<br/>
<br/>
"When I crossed my party over to make the first explorations, not one of us had any knowledge of the Indians,<br/>
of the language, or of plainscraft. The Indians surrounded<br/>
our wagons, took what they wanted, and dubbed us<br/>
'squaws.' In my exploring, ahead and alone, I struck the<br/>
Elkhorn River about noon. Being tired, I hid my rifle,<br/>
saddle, and blanket, sauntered out into a secluded place<br/>
in the woods with my pony, and lay down to sleep. I was<br/>
awakened and found my pony gone. I looked out into<br/>
the valley and saw an Indian running <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>with him. I<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>miles from my party, and was terrified,<br/>
It was my first experience, for I was very young. What<br/>
possessed me I do not know, but I grabbed my rifle and<br/>
started after the Indian, hollowing at the top of my voice.<br/>
The pony held back, and the Indian, seeing me gaining<br/>
upon him, let the horse go and put the Elkhorn between<br/>
us. The Indian was a Pawnee. He served under me in<br/>
1865, and said to me that I made so much noise he <span style="color: #ff0000;">wa'<br/>
</span>'heap scared.' "<br/>
<br/>
For eight years they carried on that survey,<br/>
learning as they went much about these Indians.<br/>
They followed the trail of the fur-seekers, broken<br/>
wide by the Mormons in their long pilgrimage. When the settlers' movement to California<br/>
began, General Dodge made a map to guide the<br/>
feet of the emigrants. It took the trail <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
