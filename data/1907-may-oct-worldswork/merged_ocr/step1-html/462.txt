</span>believe that they can work. Step by step they<br/>
must prove their ability. At the present time,<br/>
thousands of such American men and women<br/>
are living idle, dependent lives. The cause<br/>
of their unproductive dependence is the error<br/>
of not carrying their education far enough,<br/>
and of not <span style="color: #0000FF;">providing </span>them with suitable employment. I can explain the situation by outlining<br/>
what seems to be the main tendency of the<br/>
education of the blind in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The effort there is to give them <span style="color: #0000FF;">trades </span>and<br/>
handicrafts by means of which they can earn<br/>
their bread, or part of it. The aim of the best<br/>
European education is to make each individual<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">self-supporting</span>. The blind require <span style="color: #0000FF;">special<br/>
</span>teaching to enable them to use the senses of<br/>
hearing and touch in the place of sight, to live<br/>
and toil in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
ODD BELIEFS ABOUT POWERS OF THE BLIND<br/>
<br/>
When philanthropists first approach the<br/>
problem, they expect that education will<br/>
develop in the blind extraordinary mental<br/>
capacities. They reason that blind persons<br/>
shut out from <span style="color: #0000FF;">every-day </span>distractions will enjoy<br/>
great concentration of mind, and as a result<br/>
will be poets, musicians and thinkers. Such<br/>
was the dream of Valentin <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haiiy </span>in France<br/>
and Dr. S. G. Howe in Boston, and such <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-das</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>is the dream of the good Queen of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roumanim<br/>
</span>But experience taught <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haiiy </span>and Howe that<br/>
the poets, the musicians, and the philosophers<br/>
were not forthcoming. We have to deal with<br/>
a miscellaneous class of defective persons who<br/>
are often not only blind, but weak from the<br/>
very cause that destroyed their sight. From<br/>
confinement and want of exercise they are<br/>
often deficient in vitality and dulled in mind.<br/>
In such conditions of body and mind genius<br/>
can hardly <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourish</span>. It is true that blind men<br/>
sometimes have the divine spark in them.<br/>
They have become distinguished in art, in<br/>
science, in literature. But whatever eminence<br/>
they have attained has been in spite of their<br/>
misfortune, and not because of it. The great<br/>
exceptions cheer and encourage us; but they<br/>
remain exceptions. The question is, what<br/>
shall be done with the uninspired majority.<br/>
In Europe it was soon determined that the<br/>
wisest course is not to direct their instruction<br/>
wholly toward things of the intellect, but provide trades and industries by means of which<br/>
they can earn a livelihood. The more advanced<br/>
schools of Europe try to give them an education<br/>
suited to their common intelligence and their<br/>
<br/>
BE DONE FOR <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>BLIND<br/>
<br/>
uncommon infirmity, and the work <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
schools is supplemented and <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">practical<br/>
</span>by societies which help them to put their education to the best use as ordinary, industrious,<br/>
self-respecting citizens. The vicissitudes of<br/>
business are so complicated that they easily<br/>
miss their few chances of self-support, unless<br/>
they have special organizations to find positions<br/>
for them, to advertise their abilities and <span style="color: #0000FF;">persuade </span>the community to give the blind musician,<br/>
or teacher, or broom-maker, or masseur, or<br/>
whatever he may be, profitable employment.<br/>
There <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>such organizations in Europe that<br/>
use every effort to bring industrial training<br/>
within the reach of all the blind, and are the<br/>
channels through which the true end of education and charity for the sightless is <span style="color: #0000FF;">achieved<br/>
<br/>
</span>NECESSITY FOR BUSINESS TRAINING<br/>
<br/>
In America, where the struggle for existence<br/>
is less severe, and where money is more plentiful, we have been long coming to realize the<br/>
necessity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitting </span>each individual for a selfsupporting life. Our education has been<br/>
administered to all children alike, without<br/>
regard for their capacities or circumstances.<br/>
Consequently most children leave school unprepared for a trade or industry or profession.<br/>
This general state of American education has<br/>
complicated the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>of the sightless.<br/>
Excellent schools for their instruction, <span style="color: #0000FF;">established </span>on sound principles, have existed since<br/>
1832 when the first institutions for the blind<br/>
were opened in Boston and New York. But<br/>
they have laid little or no stress upon industrial<br/>
training. Their system of education has the<br/>
same faults as that in the ordinary American<br/>
schools for the seeing. Besides, our <span style="color: #0000FF;">institutions </span>for the blind are intended for children<br/>
and youths, and have not taken very much<br/>
interest in the adults. Until recently we have<br/>
had nothing which corresponds to the societies<br/>
for the blind in Europe, and the associations<br/>
which have lately been formed in two or three<br/>
American states are scarcely beyond the stage<br/>
of tentative effort.<br/>
<br/>
One great difficulty of the adult blind is,<br/>
that of the thousands of occupations in which<br/>
men <span style="color: #0000FF;">engage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>only a very few will ever be possible for the sightless. The occupations in<br/>
which they have already succeeded are the<br/>
manufacture of mattresses, brooms, brushes,<br/>
mats, baskets, some simple kinds of carpentry<br/>
and weaving, cobbling, typewriting, <span style="color: #ff0000;">pianotuning</span>, massage, knitting, crocheting and plain<br/>
<br/>
