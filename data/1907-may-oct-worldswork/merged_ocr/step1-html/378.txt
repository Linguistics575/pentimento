better adjustment of our great educational<br/>
machinery to contemporaneous life and to<br/>
its <span style="color: #0000FF;">multiform </span>activities. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">significant</span>, too,<br/>
that the Presidents of Yale, of Princeton, of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">University </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Chicago, of Williams and of many<br/>
other colleges and universities are men trained<br/>
in the groups of studies classed under History<br/>
and Economics. It is these upon which the<br/>
activity of our time puts the greatest emphasis.<br/>
<br/>
THE DIFFICULTY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>MOVING MEN<br/>
<br/>
HIS is surely an extraordinary condition:<br/>
The stream of immigrants to the United<br/>
States is larger than it ever was before; the<br/>
demand for workers of every grade of labor<br/>
is more general than it ever was before; in<br/>
spite of the considerable movement of newcomers to the Southwest and in much smaller<br/>
numbers to the South, the demand there is<br/>
not supplied; and meanwhile the slums of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">New </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">York </span>and presumably of other large cities<br/>
become worse crowded than ever<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>With the ease and cheapness of transportation and with all our facilities for making the<br/>
wants of one region known in every other<br/>
region, we do not seem to be able to distribute<br/>
our population quickly in accordance with<br/>
economic demands. In the long run such a<br/>
distribution no doubt does take place, but it<br/>
does not seem to take place with organized<br/>
intelligence, certainly not with swiftness.<br/>
<br/>
But certain agencies for sending settlers to<br/>
the South and to the Southwest are succeeding<br/>
in a measure. But any one who sees the<br/>
abnormal crowding of parts of New York,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">contrary </span>to all sound laws of economics and of<br/>
health, must wonder at the still imperfect control that we have acquired over the habits and<br/>
tendencies of ignorant masses.<br/>
<br/>
GOVERNMENT BY KNOWLEDGE, OR BY FITS?<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">b </span>HE proposition is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sound </span>one, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>good conduct of departmental government, like the good conduct of private business,<br/>
or for that matter like the good conduct of<br/>

life in general, must rest not on <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitful </span>emotional<br/>
impulses, but on a thorough knowledge at every<br/>
step of what is done. There is nothing novel<br/>
in this proposition. But, if we should apply<br/>
it to city government, we should make the first<br/>
long step away from government by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fits </span>and<br/>
starts.<br/>
<br/>
As things usually are, the mass of citizens<br/>
are ignorant of their city government. If it<br/>
be reasonably well conducted, all right. If it<br/>
be badly conducted, its badness goes on till<br/>
it becomes worse, there is a scandal, the public<br/>
conscience is aroused, and at the next election<br/>
the people proceed to turn the rascals out-for<br/>
a time.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. William H. Allen's plea in this number<br/>
of THE WORLD'S WORK is for such work as<br/>
the Bureau of Municipal Research is performing in New York. It is expert accountants'<br/>
work (and something more) applied to the<br/>
city departments, about the financial conduct<br/>
of which the body of citizens knows <span style="color: #0000FF;">noth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ing.<br/>
<br/>
When a bureau of such research has done its<br/>
work, the next step is to inform the public of<br/>
the results and to convince them of its value.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Unlt </span>ss a great scandal is exposed, it is hard to<br/>
reach the public attention.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the public attention with anything<br/>
of normal (and not sensational) <span style="color: #0000FF;">interest </span>is the<br/>
most difficult of all tasks in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">rlecrccrao</span>.<br/>
Disease could be abolished, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">triff </span>could<br/>
be reformed, bad food would <span style="color: #0000FF;">cease </span>be sold,<br/>
the tenements might all be torn down, children<br/>
could be properly taught-great Heavens!<br/>
we could begin a very respectable Utopia<br/>
within a week if there were any way to teach<br/>
the mass of the people only a dozen or two fundamental well-ascertained, often-demonstrated<br/>
facts.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, a bureau of any sort of research<br/>
is a good thing whenever and wherever applied;<br/>
and if the citizens of New York or any other<br/>
city really wish to know how their government<br/>
is conducted, this is the way to find it out.<br/>

HOW TO INVEST SMALL FUNDS<br/>
<br/>
' NE of the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>tasks that falls<br/>
to the lot of the conscientious broker<br/>
or banker is the giving of advice to<br/>
<br/>
those who have to invest small sums of money<br/>
<br/>
for helpless and unskilled investors. It is a<br/>
task that calls for honesty, caution, and extreme resourcefulness. In nine cases out of<br/>
ten, it is necessary that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">investment </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">should<br/>
