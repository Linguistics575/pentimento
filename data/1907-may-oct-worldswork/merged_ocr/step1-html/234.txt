<span>9032 A <span style="color: #0000FF;">JOURNEY </span>THROUGH<br/>
colored. The whole public school system<br/>
here is built upon an ideal of industrial service;<br/>
and cooking, dressmaking, home-keeping, carpentering, foundry work, go hand in hand with<br/>
elementary and academic studies. The output<br/>
of industrial work done in the Negro schools<br/>
is especially promising. The Secondary Industrial School is a free institution recently established for boys and girls and offers (besides<br/>
studies in four academic branches) practical<br/>
instruction in carpentry, pattern-making, forge<br/>
and foundry work, machine work, textiles,<br/>
millinery, dress-making, domestic science, and<br/>
commercial training.<br/>
<br/>
THE CONTRADICTION OF ALL THEORIES<br/>
<br/>
To set down a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">specific </span>illustrative <span style="color: #0000FF;">facts<br/>
</span>out of a wealth of such facts-this is a weary and<br/>
inadequate way to tell the transformation that<br/>
industry is making in the lowland South, a<br/>
transformation not only in the fortunes of the<br/>
people but in their point of view and in their<br/>
outlook.<br/>
<br/>
But, on the other hand, to draw sweeping<br/>
conclusions is likely to give a wrong notion,<br/>
for fortunes cannot be picked up, and there<br/>
is no such thing as a sudden change in the<br/>
thought or in the habits of any people. To<br/>
describe the new impulse, the new opportunities,<br/>
the overcoming of old difficulties, the operations<br/>
of new economic forces, the changed angle of<br/>
vision-that is a hard task. This magazine is<br/>
not given to "booming" anything. Exaggeration defeats its own purpose. Yet to write<br/>
with less than enthusiasm would be to write<br/>
less than the truth. The following incidents<br/>
indicate a few of the kinds of changes.<br/>
<br/>
I asked a young man at one of the Southern<br/>
schools of technology why he chose this training rather than training for one of the older<br/>
professions. "My grandfather," said he, "was<br/>
a mighty man in theology in his day. He<br/>
knocked out his opponents and he battered the<br/>
devil. My father was a lawyer and a soldier.<br/>
He fought the United States by argument<br/>
and in war. I notice that the devil and the<br/>
United States are both doing business yet.<br/>
I made up my mind, therefore, that I would<br/>
change the family job and do what I can to<br/>
build mills and roads in Georgia."<br/>
<br/>
I saw a record of the transfers of a tract of<br/>
land in the outskirts of Memphis which had<br/>
increased in value, within about twenty years,<br/>
from $ 500 to $ 45,000; and such an experience<br/>
can be found in any of these larger cities.<br/>
<br/>
THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
Nobody in Memphis or anywhere else believed<br/>
this possible. Of course, such a fact means a<br/>
new adjustment of man to the land-a new<br/>
adjustment to life.<br/>
<br/>
Less than twenty-five years ago the principal<br/>
taxpayers in Durham, N. C.,. protested in<br/>
writing against the levying of a local tax for<br/>
schools. They didn't believe in "free schools,"<br/>
nor in being taxed to educate other people's<br/>
children. These same men built, not many<br/>
years later, by their private subscriptions as<br/>
well as by their taxes, large and beautiful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolhouses </span>for Negro children as well as for<br/>
white children; and they now properly boast<br/>
of their schools.<br/>
<br/>
I recall a speech that I heard a man of learning make ten years ago to prove that the Negro<br/>
could not accumulate <span style="color: #0000FF;">or.manage </span>property.<br/>
There are to-day eleven banks owned and<br/>
managed by Negroes in Mississippi-in Mississippi, mind you.<br/>
<br/>
Another instance: Two men, whose parents<br/>
were "poor white trash," have, without formal<br/>
education, in ten or a dozen years made<br/>
property worth $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2cacvyocr</span>---by growing cotton;<br/>
and they manage their business as systematically as any business in New York is managed.<br/>
<br/>
I know a young man who declined a <span style="color: #0000FF;">comfortable </span>salary and a post of honor in a Northern university because he wished to teach<br/>
country youth at his own Southern college on<br/>
an insecure guarantee (year by year) of only<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">8500</span>. There are hundreds such.<br/>
<br/>
I know a little Southern railroad that was<br/>
built through a pine forest to haul lumber.<br/>
What would become of it when the lumber<br/>
was exhausted? Its freight receipts now from<br/>
small manufactured wood-products are greater<br/>
than they ever were from lumber.<br/>
<br/>
Similar experiences <span style="color: #ff0000;">maybe </span>found in any<br/>
rapidly developing part of the country. But<br/>
the point is, you have always expected such<br/>
things to happen in the West. Now these<br/>
very things are happening in the lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">South-things </span>that contradict every old theory, Northern or Southern.<br/>
<br/>
This era of change brings us, therefore, to<br/>
this happy conclusion-many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">troublesome </span>problems of <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>will not be troublesome<br/>
problems <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-morrow</span>. The "problem" stage<br/>
of Southern life is passing. The theoretical<br/>
stage is passing. The industrial era is bringing<br/>
natural forces into activity. This is true, of<br/>
course, in varying degrees in different places.<br/>
But the change has begun, and only time is<br/>
<br/>
