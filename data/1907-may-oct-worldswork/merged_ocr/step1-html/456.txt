<br/>
since have demanded a change from the unscientific method of organization which has<br/>
come to us from the Middle Ages.<br/>
<br/>
In a late report, the superintendent of the<br/>
schools of New York City acknowledged that<br/>
102,000 pupils were from two to seven years<br/>
behind the proper grade for their age. Another authority undertakes to show that seven<br/>
out of ten were from one to seven years behind,<br/>
and were therefore considered backward pupils.<br/>
The proportion of those losing time in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>year was much greater than the number<br/>
losing time in the first year. The proportion<br/>
losing time in the third year was twice as great<br/>
as the number losing time in the first year;<br/>
and so on, in ever-increasing ratio.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT BECOMES OF THE PUPILS<br/>
<br/>
In an article on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">17 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span>York schools, I<br/>
called attention to the fact that the reports<br/>
never showed the number of pupils promoted.<br/>
It is encouraging to note that the last report<br/>
devotes several pages to this important subject.<br/>
It states that <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-fifth </span>of those left at the end of<br/>
a term were not promoted to advance work, but<br/>
were compelled to repeat the work of a whole<br/>
term. This they were forced to do, though<br/>
but a short distance behind the rest of the class.<br/>
While some schools report from 50 to 60 per<br/>
cent. not promoted, the average per cent. of<br/>
failures is made to appear small; by some<br/>
peculiar method of estimating the number<br/>
promoted, in some schools it was reported that<br/>
from 104 to 137 per cent. were promoted. But<br/>
the average is bad enough, for, even at this<br/>
rate, in less than <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years 100 per cent. would<br/>
lose time and be considered backward pupils.<br/>
Yet this is not the worst. During the year<br/>
680,322 pupils were enrolled; it is acknowledged that of these but 434,706 were promoted<br/>
and 113,283 not promoted. What became<br/>
of the other 132,233? Some have died; some<br/>
have moved away; few were old enough to<br/>
go to work. How many of these were quietly<br/>
forced to stop school lest they reduce the per<br/>
cent. of those promoted? How many left<br/>
because of utter discouragement resulting from<br/>
a system which demands of pupils and teachers<br/>
the accomplishment of the impossible? How<br/>
many of the bright ones left because they<br/>
could not forever bear the marking time and<br/>
waiting for the slower ones to learn what they<br/>
long since knew well?<br/>
<br/>
Under such conditions, is it any wonder that<br/>
so few reach the higher grades, and that the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">SCHOOL-CHILDREN<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'bright </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">schools</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IN </span>LOCK-STEP<br/>
<br/>
lower grades are congested with those who are<br/>
unjustly considered backward? Need we be<br/>
surprised that the number reported upon as<br/>
being from two to six years behind their grade<br/>
increases year after year?<br/>
<br/>
GREAT LOSS TO NEW YORK<br/>
<br/>
This means a great loss to New York City in<br/>
several ways. Leaving out of consideration<br/>
the pupils not accounted for, if only those not<br/>
promoted lost one half-year twice a year, this<br/>
means that 113,283 must go over the year's<br/>
work, though the records prove that on an<br/>
average they are but a tenth of a year behind<br/>
in essential work. As the annual cost of<br/>
instruction was $ 43 per capita, it meant an<br/>
expenditure for the year of more than four<br/>
millions, which could have been saved if pupils<br/>
had not been compelled to review one-half of a<br/>
year's work. In addition to this, as much<br/>
more might have been saved if the brighter<br/>
children had been allowed to go forward when<br/>
they were able, in place of waiting until all<br/>
were ready to move. This loss of time also<br/>
means that the individual's productive life<br/>
would be shortened by the number of years<br/>
lost. If but 100,000 of those losing time should<br/>
finish their work one year earlier and could<br/>
earn but <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span>a year, it would mean to them a<br/>
saving of <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>millions. Or, if the pupils who<br/>
were from two to six years behind had averaged<br/>
a loss of but three years and could earn but<br/>
$ 100 a year, it <span style="color: #ff0000;">W'uld </span>mean a saving to them<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>millions.<br/>
<br/>
But great as is the financial loss to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">trict </span>and pupils, the loss in mental discipline<br/>
is even more to be regretted. Having the<br/>
bright, the slow, <span style="color: #ff0000;">trind </span>the average in every class,<br/>
teachers are compelled to become pupil drivers.<br/>
While trying to force the slow into an unnatural<br/>
gait, the brighter pupils are drilled in habits<br/>
of idleness and <span style="color: #0000FF;">inattention </span>and lose their mental<br/>
elasticity by cont, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tually </span>repeating work which,<br/>
because of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">familiarity</span>, has long since<br/>
ceased to furnish suitable exercise.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">UNSATISFA </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">JORY </span>EXPLANATIONS<br/>
<br/>
All sorts of excuses have been offered for<br/>
these unsatisfactory conditions. The most<br/>
popular excuse is that so many pupils are dull.<br/>
We are asked to believe that the backward<br/>
children are born so, and the others made<br/>
Yet there is much to<br/>
prove the assertion that the most of the socalled backward children are made so by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
