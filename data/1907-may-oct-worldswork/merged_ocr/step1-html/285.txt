<span>THE STORY OF ENGLAND IN EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
idea of education is a new proposition. The<br/>
schoolgirl, for instance, was formerly an unknown-almost an unthinkable-quantity; now<br/>
there are certainly more than 10,000 girls in<br/>
Egyptian schools. The new movement is<br/>
only begun, for it is Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cromer</span>'s conviction<br/>
that Egypt's great need is for agricultural and<br/>
trade schools. This system is yet to be built<br/>
up, but first must come the primary teaching<br/>
now in progress. That the Egyptian, despite<br/>
his Moslem traditions, takes kindly to instruction of a practical character is shown by the<br/>
reform school near Cairo. Lord Cromer has<br/>
been repeatedly embarrassed by the requests of<br/>
Egyptian parents that their children be allowed<br/>
to enter this institution-designed only for the<br/>
criminal class of boys. It is a remarkable fact<br/>
in connection with all his educational work<br/>
that Lord Cromer has insisted that the pupils<br/>
are not to be taught the English language.<br/>
All primary instruction is given in their native<br/>
tongue.<br/>
<br/>
The contrast between the old and the new in<br/>
higher education can be shown by brief <span style="color: #0000FF;">reference </span>to two great institutions. At Cairo is a<br/>
Mohammedan "university," which was old<br/>
when the Universities of Oxford, Paris, and<br/>
Berlin were founded. Judged by the number<br/>
of its pupils, it is one of the largest in the world;<br/>
judged by its work, it is one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deadest</span>.<br/>
Its young men squat around ancient theologues<br/>
and commit to memory passages from the<br/>
Koran and other books, written in a language<br/>
now almost obsolete. The influence of this<br/>
"university" is about as progressive as that<br/>
of the mummies on exhibition in the great<br/>
museum of Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
GORDON MEMORIAL COLLEGE<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartum</span>, on the banks of the Nile,<br/>
stands Gordon Memorial College-the university of <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>and to-morrow. When the<br/>
news reached England that Kitchener had<br/>
avenged Gordon, London overflowed into<br/>
Trafalgar Square and buried the hero's statue<br/>
in flowers. Then came an appeal from the<br/>
avenger that a great training school be established on the spot where Gordon fell. The response was instantaneous. In 1898, Khartum<br/>
was the stronghold of the Mahdi's successor.<br/>
Now, in less than ten years, it has a college with<br/>
three departments: (r) a normal school, training<br/>
young men to become teachers and judges; (2)<br/>
a primary school for a larger number of pupils,<br/>
most <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>whom will eventually hold <span style="color: #ff0000;">gqvemmcm<br/>
<br/>
</span>9083<br/>
<br/>
positions; (3) a manual training department<br/>
which will furnish the land with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">much</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">needed </span>artisans. The plan of Lord Cromer,<br/>
which has his <span style="color: #0000FF;">successor</span>'s earnest support,<br/>
provides for the establishment of similar<br/>
schools in many parts of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Much could be said about the improvement<br/>
that has come in the direction of sanitation,<br/>
better methods of transportation, the everyday life of the people. A traveler recently<br/>
described a trip all the way up the Nile into<br/>
Uganda on a steamer equipped with electric<br/>
lights, hot and cold baths-and ice! The<br/>
following was the menu served 850 miles from<br/>
Cairo:<br/>
<br/>
"Potage Julienne<br/>
Poisson bouilli, Sauce hollandaise<br/>
Grosse piece de <span style="color: #0000FF;">band </span>garni<br/>
Petits pois a l'Anglaise<br/>
Poulet <span style="color: #ff0000;">roti<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Salade </span>de <span style="color: #ff0000;">laitue<br/>
</span>Creme <span style="color: #ff0000;">renversée<br/>
</span>Dessert et Café."<br/>
<br/>
But to those of us who are not tourists, it is far<br/>
more comforting to believe that the hardworking Egyptian peasant has at last a sufficient<br/>
quantity of plain, nutritious food for himself<br/>
and his family, and forage for his stock.<br/>
<br/>
THE MAN WHO DID THE WORK<br/>
<br/>
For the transformation that has been<br/>
wrought, credit must go in large measure to<br/>
Lord Cromer. It goes without saying that<br/>
much of the work has been accomplished by<br/>
his associates, but Cromer deserves credit for<br/>
knowing how to pick men for <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>tasks.<br/>
It is also much to his credit that he gave his<br/>
younger associates full opportunity to distinguish themselves, when a smaller man would<br/>
have taken the honors to himself. Mr. Moberly Bell says that in Cromer's reports he often<br/>
mentioned the name of a subordinate as having<br/>
procured valuable information or done a particularly good piece of work, when in reality<br/>
the chief was himself entitled to the distinction.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Cromer's career outside of Egypt can<br/>
be told in a few words. He graduated from<br/>
the military school at the age of seventeen; at<br/>
twenty, the young lieutenant was aide-de-camp<br/>
to Major-General Storks in the Ionian Isles;<br/>
at twenty-five he was in Jamaica. In 1868<br/>
he was a captain of artillery. From 1872 to<br/>
1876 he was private secretary to Lord Northbrook, Viceroy of India. In 1875 he reached<br/>
the rank of <span style="color: #0000FF;">major</span>; four years later he retired<br/>
<br/>
