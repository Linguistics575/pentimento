</span>Some uninformed person, many years ago,<br/>
classified the Southern white people as aristocracy and "poor white trash," and thousands<br/>
of uninformed people have thoughtlessly repeated the phrase until, by sheer repetition,<br/>
it has come to have the semblance of truth.<br/>
This classification has probably caused more<br/>
misunderstanding than any other in the world<br/>
that had so little fact to stand upon. At the<br/>
beginning of the nineteenth century, the socalled "poor white trash" of the Carolinas and<br/>
Georgia were the manufacturers of the nation.<br/>
Twenty years after Washington was made<br/>
President, those three states did more manufacturing than any other section of the country.<br/>
The manufactures of North Carolina were<br/>
worth $ 2,989,140 when those of Massachusetts<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>worth $ 2,219,279; Virginia was first in<br/>
population and wealth, and North Carolina<br/>
third, of the original colonies. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactures </span>of this section were not conducted<br/>
by the slave-holding aristocracy, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">was<br/>

vicinity. That part of the country was<br/>
known as the "old iron district." There <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
