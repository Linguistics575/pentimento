</span>THE RAILROAD CONQUEST OF THE MOUNTAINS<br/>
<br/>
Omaha up the Platte Valley, across the hills<br/>
through Salt Lake City, thence by the Humboldt and Truckee Valleys to California. It<br/>
showed the camping places for each night,<br/>
indicated where grass, water, and wood could<br/>
be found, and marked the fords of the rivers.<br/>
It was not intended as a report of a railroad<br/>
reconnaissance, but it will serve to show the<br/>
variety of information gathered up by a skilled<br/>
railroad scout on a pilgrimage through a<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
It was on a much later expedition that<br/>
General Dodge discovered the Sherman Pass.<br/>
He was coming back from the Powder River<br/>
campaign against the Indians. With six<br/>
troopers and a guide, he left his force and rode<br/>
miles along the ridge of the hills. His little<br/>
party was cut off from the main force by a<br/>
body of hostiles. All afternoon they rode for<br/>
their lives, holding off the Indians by rifle fire<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>They came, at last, down into the level plains.<br/>
<br/>
"I then said to my guide that if we saved our scalps, I<br/>
believed we had found the crossing <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Black <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hills-and </span>it was over this very ridge that the wonderful line was<br/>
built. For over two years all explorations had failed to<br/>
find a satisfactory crossing.<br/>
<br/>
"In 1867 we located there the post of D. A.<br/>
Russell and the city <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Cheyenne. At that time, the<br/>
nearest settlement was at Denver, <span style="color: #0000FF;">150 </span>miles away; and<br/>
while we lay there the Indians swooped down on a Mormon train that had followed our trail, and killed two of<br/>
its men; but we saved their stock, and started the graveyard <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the future city."<br/>
<br/>
These are but episodes of the reconnaissance of the Union Pacific. They can<br/>
be duplicated from the history of every one<br/>
of the transcontinentals.<br/>
<br/>
The original survey of the Canadian Pacific<br/>
route through the Rocky Mountains was as<br/>
difficult a piece of work as could be imagined.<br/>
The two ranges <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>very close together, and it<br/>
seemed simply impossible for any road to find<br/>
its way across them, on account of the great<br/>
depth of the narrow valley between them.<br/>
To-day, the trains pass through the eastern<br/>
range in the Kicking Horse Pass, and the<br/>
western range in the Eagle Pass. The former,<br/>
according to General <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sherman</span>'s statement,<br/>
was discovered by an American engineer<br/>
named Randolph, and was named from the<br/>
fact that his horse kicked him on the knee at<br/>
that stage in his wanderings. The passage of<br/>
this range had been practically given up, and<br/>
a great detour through <span style="color: #0000FF;">Howse </span>Pass was<br/>
intended.<br/>
<br/>
9209<br/>
<br/>
Eagle Pass was discovered by accident.<br/>
General Sherman credits the same Randolph<br/>
with its discovery, but the records are against<br/>
him. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Y </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ears </span>before, when the Canadian <span style="color: #0000FF;">engineers </span>were seeking a route for a wagon road<br/>
from British Columbia, Walter Moberly, head<br/>
of a surveying party running the line from West<br/>
to East, was led by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">eagle</span>'s flight through<br/>
this almost impenetrable range of the Selkirks.<br/>
He was on the point of turning back, weary<br/>
and discouraged from a long search for a<br/>
passage, when an eagle swept over his head and<br/>
on into the heart of the range. He followed<br/>
it around a great projecting corner, up a huge<br/>
rift in the side of the glacier-and then the pass<br/>
opened clear before his <span style="color: #0000FF;">eyes </span>It is that same<br/>
rift that to-day carries the rails of the Canadian<br/>
Pacific from the snows to the valleys of the<br/>
coast.<br/>
<br/>
Many a mile of these great railroads was<br/>
laid beside the graves of the engineers. Down<br/>
in the heart of Mexico, in the rolling hills of<br/>
sand, there is a little group of graves, marked<br/>
by white crosses. They are merely a typical<br/>
tribute to the perils of reconnaissance in a<br/>
savage country. Four young American engineers building the Mexican Central were caught<br/>
at that point in 1881 by the Apaches. They<br/>
fought until they died, fearing the torture.<br/>
Their names <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>Fordham, Leavitt, Grew,<br/>
and Wallace; and that is about all that the<br/>
records show. It was but an incident-no<br/>
more-echoed in Texas when they shoved the<br/>
Texas Pacific through the Staked Plain; parallelled in Idaho on the Northern Pacific survey.<br/>
<br/>
THE PERILS OF THE SURVEY<br/>
<br/>
The reconnaissance, however, is but a little<br/>
part of the location of a railroad through the<br/>
wilds. The survey follows it. In most cases,<br/>
the final route of a railroad across the ranges<br/>
threads the valley of a river. It is so that the<br/>
Denver & Rio Grande pierces the Rockies,<br/>
following the canyons of the Grand and the<br/>
Gunnison. Here it is that the engineer meets<br/>
other dangers than the hostility of man. Along<br/>
these frowning cliffs, towering to the snows,<br/>
the line must find <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>foothold. Great logs are<br/>
slung in chains above stream for men to stand<br/>
upon while they plot out the level of the ledge.<br/>
Sometimes men are dropped over the cliffs<br/>
to operate their transits and their levels from<br/>
the end of a rope, dangling above a torrent.<br/>
<br/>
The life in the field is rigorous. From the<br/>
dawn come the feet of the engineers, up through<br/>
<br/>
