</span>powers direct. Under ordinary conditions, a<br/>
cotton mill depending on steam for power finds<br/>
its fuel bill as much as one-sixth of its total<br/>
expenses, and I know one factory which <span style="color: #0000FF;">expects </span>to save $ 12,500 a year by substituting<br/>
electric power for coal next July.<br/>
<br/>
But manufacturing progress has not been<br/>
made at the expense of agriculture. In the last<br/>
census decade, North Carolina, Virginia, and<br/>
Tennessee were among the eleven states which<br/>
made <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>net gain of three points or more in rank<br/>
in gross value of agricultural products. If <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8965<br/>
<br/>
</span>tually, eastern North Carolina, for example,<br/>
is likely to become <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vast </span>garden for supplying Northern markets and its own increasing<br/>
factory population with early vegetables, fruits,<br/>
and berries. It has not been many years<br/>
since it began <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-ship </span>strawberries. Yet in<br/>
two days last year 386 refrigerator <span style="color: #0000FF;">carloads<br/>
</span>passed through Rocky <span style="color: #ff0000;">Motmt-2</span>, ooo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quarts</span>,<br/>
or enough to furnish one cupful to every person in every city and county in New York.<br/>
In Wilmington, the other day, I saw forty<br/>
acres under cloth-Mr. D. N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chadwick's<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>advance of North Carolina manufacturing is<br/>
more notable than the advance of agriculture<br/>
it is only because it is more novel, not because<br/>
it is more substantial. From 1890 to 1900, the<br/>
increase in agricultural production was five<br/>
times as great as the increase in population,<br/>
and since 1900 this rate of progress has been<br/>
further accelerated.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, the Upland South is now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>out just what nature intended to make<br/>
of each section and is working in harmony<br/>
with her instead of at cross-purposes. Even<br/>
immense lettuce crop, his returns from this one<br/>
vegetable having netted him $ 40,000. One<br/>
man who came to eastern North Carolina<br/>
penniless has since cleared as much as $ 25,000<br/>
in one year from truck crops. Even the poorest sand-hill land, once regarded as fit for nothing except "to hold creation <span style="color: #ff0000;">togethcr</span>," has<br/>
trebled in value as its adaptability for growing<br/>
fruits and vegetables (notably peaches, grapes,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dewberries</span>) and its susceptibility to <span style="color: #0000FF;">improvement </span>have been demonstrated. "We<br/>
have the climate, and we can make the soil,"<br/>
