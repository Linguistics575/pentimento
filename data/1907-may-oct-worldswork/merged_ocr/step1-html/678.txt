right to produce men in each of these classes<br/>
who might be imagined as willing to teach the<br/>
country a lesson. Let us imagine, then, these<br/>
five representatives of the financial <span style="color: #ff0000;">cl </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ISSes<br/>
</span>gathered together to complete the details of<br/>
their great conspiracy.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner passes swiftly. Coffee and cigars<br/>
prepare the way for business. The waiters<br/>
and the butler disappear. The host gets up,<br/>
locks the door, sits down again. The setting<br/>
is ready. The curtain is up on the first scene<br/>
of the great conspiracy. The host speaks:<br/>
<br/>
"We have prepared a plan," he says, "and<br/>
will discuss it now. We understand each<br/>
other, and we know where we stand. The<br/>
object is to clear our hands of every dollar's<br/>
worth of property and every stock and bond we<br/>
own in the United States, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>do it in such<br/>
a way as to secure to ourselves the best results,<br/>
yet leave as we go memories that will <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lesson<br/>
not merely to the Administration and the People<br/>
of this country, but to all Administrations and<br/>
to all peoples. I shall now read the'plan."<br/>
<br/>
A CONSPIRACY OF THE BIG FIVE<br/>
<br/>
It is simplicity. A year is allowed for the<br/>
sale of all property, and of all securities. The<br/>
banker is pledged to assist in every way possible.<br/>
Such stocks and bonds as have a broad market<br/>
are to be fed out to the public slowly, yet as<br/>
fast as may be without disturbing the market<br/>
over-much. A new market is to be made for the<br/>
quiet stocks. One great industrial corporation<br/>
with 100 millions of stock, selling at $ 500 per<br/>
share, is to be reorganized quickly into a <span style="color: #0000FF;">500million </span>dollar company, because the public<br/>
will buy ten shares at $ 100 more quickly than<br/>
one share at $ 500. The selling is to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">distributed </span>among a hundred stock exchange<br/>
houses, so that it may not be traced. A huge<br/>
campaign is to be started by the Gambler,<br/>
because it would not attract any suspicion and<br/>
would serve to divert attention. The Banker<br/>
will see that Wall Street has money in plenty.<br/>
All checks received from the brokers who sell<br/>
are to be deposited in his bank. They will<br/>
provide abundant credit, and this is to be kept<br/>
at the disposal of Wall Street for many months<br/>
to come. Extra dividends are to be declared on<br/>
the magnate's railroad stocks, one after another,<br/>
yet not too close together. The Steel Man is<br/>
to plot a great consolidation of the trust and<br/>
all the independents. It must hang fire and<br/>
last as long and create as much speculative<br/>
interest as did the great "Hill ore-deal," in 1906.<br/>
<br/>
MONEY-KINGS<br/>
<br/>
"That, gentlemen," says the spokesman,<br/>
"is as far as we need go at present. It is the<br/>
first step. It is, of course, obviously necessary.<br/>
The rest is all prepared, but it is as well, with<br/>
your permission, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">take </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>step at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span>.<br/>
What do you say?<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Â»</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
<br/>
</span>And so it comes about that Wall Street wakes<br/>
up and hangs out its most alluring banners.<br/>
The market hums, and sings, and dances.<br/>
Men make millions gambling in stocks and, of<br/>
course, re-invest the millions in the same stocks.<br/>
The struggle between capital and labor subsides, strikes cease, harmony reigns supreme.<br/>
Groups of the magnates hasten to Washington,<br/>
time in, time out. Peace breathes from the<br/>
columns of the press, in sage and guarded interview, in brilliant editorial<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Big Stick<br/>
is hung aloft to make a perch for cooing doves.<br/>
The fiery backwoods legislator is quenched in<br/>
an editorial bucket of common sense. All is<br/>
serenity. The people are rich and happy.<br/>
Financial editors note, with entire satisfaction,<br/>
that the common people, at large, have taken<br/>
to investing in stocks and bonds as the French<br/>
do. Confidence has returned to the land.<br/>
<br/>
So pass ten months. Then, on a night, the<br/>
Five come together again, in the same room, to<br/>
the same call. Once more, over cigars and<br/>
coffee, the host opens his mind.<br/>
<br/>
"Everything is sold," he says, "except my<br/>
country place, and that is mortgaged for more<br/>
than it cost me, and Mr. B's stable of horses,<br/>
and that is insured against fire. We can now<br/>
pass on. Before another step <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span>taken, however, it is necessary to confer as to whether we<br/>
shall go on or turn back. There has been a<br/>
year of great prosperity and peace<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>smiled-" and perhaps some of us think it<br/>
would be better not to go on, but to-well,<br/>
what do you say?"<br/>
<br/>
"Go on!" said the Gambler.<br/>
<br/>
"There will be a crash anyway in a few<br/>
months," said the Steel Man, "if that Consolidation goes through!"<br/>
<br/>
"I want to get out of the country," said the<br/>
Industrialist, "before the public starts to sell<br/>
its stocks. Whether we go on or not, this<br/>
country will soon be too hot for me. A falling<br/>
market breeds enemies for us."<br/>
<br/>
"With the growth of Socialism," said the<br/>
Banker, "the country is not fit to live in anyway. Let us go on."<br/>
<br/>
"Very <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-we </span>shall go on. We find that<br/>
our united wealth is now represented by<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,2oo</span>, ooo, ooo, all in bank credits, We have<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
