</span>THE FIRST BAPTIST <span style="color: #0000FF;">CHURCH </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PONCE<br/>
</span>This one denomination has twelve church-houses in the island<br/>
<br/>
along at a speed of about twelve miles an<br/>
hour.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Then </span>there were three short, disconnected<br/>
sections of a proposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">belt-line-Ponce </span>to<br/>
Yauco, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hormigueros </span>to Aguadilla, and Camuy<br/>
to San Juan. The now American company<br/>
has connected these sections and there is<br/>
now a continuous line from Carolina in the<br/>
northeast to Ponce in the south. There <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>UNITED STATES <span style="color: #ff0000;">IN </span>PORTO RICO<br/>
<br/>
also a number of independent branch lines<br/>
that feed the main line, but all these various<br/>
divisions may be legally compelled to work<br/>
together. Instead of the "dinky" engines,<br/>
American locomotives now pull the trains,<br/>
and the supply of box-cars has been doubled.<br/>
<br/>
Another joke with the soldiers-unless they<br/>
were in a hurry-was a ride on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mayagucz<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">street-car</span>, which had accommodations for one<br/>
large family, besides the conductor and the<br/>
"motorman." But both San Juan and Ponce<br/>
now have fine trolley systems and an electric<br/>
line is being constructed to run from the capital<br/>
along the route of the military road toward<br/>
Aibonito. The island has an efficient <span style="color: #0000FF;">telegraph </span>system with fifty stations, and telephone<br/>
lines connect these with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">smaller </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">towns</span>.<br/>
It is something new for the towns of Porto<br/>
Rico to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>direct communication with one<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING<br/>
<br/>
When it is remembered that Porto Rico is<br/>
wholly an agricultural country, that it sends out<br/>
of the island practically everything of <span style="color: #ff0000;">value<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>A REMINDER OF THE OLD REGIME<br/>
The cathedral and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Spanish </span>priest will <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>have a place in Porto Rican <span style="color: #0000FF;">affection<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
