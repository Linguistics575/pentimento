</span>PORTO <span style="color: #0000FF;">RICOS </span>POPULATION IN 1900, BY RACES<br/>
<br/>
The proportion of colored to <span style="color: #ff0000;">white </span>is slightly higher than in<br/>
the South Atlantic States and is <span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">higher </span>than in Cuba. The<br/>
proportion of whites is higher inland than in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coast </span>districts<br/>
<br/>
the background the small mills set up on each<br/>
plantation. The miles of railroad track and<br/>
scores of little cars for transporting the cane<br/>
from the fields to the "central" are evidence<br/>
that the planter has been an apt pupil.<br/>
<br/>
We have also given him some lessons in<br/>
making use of the waste products of his cane.<br/>
The tops are now used for feed; the pulp after<br/>
the cane is crushed keeps the furnace fires<br/>
going; the ash from the furnace is a good<br/>
fertilizer; that part of the juice which does not<br/>
crystallize into sugar is made into molasses;<br/>
the very dregs go to restore the fertility of the<br/>
soil.<br/>
<br/>
What has been the result? Last year the<br/>
planters loaded three times as much sugar on<br/>
the ships as was sent out in 1901, and it brought<br/>
fourteen millions instead of less than five.<br/>
<br/>
The tobacco planter has been to the same<br/>
school. The tobacco he shipped last year was<br/>
worth five times as much as that shipped five<br/>
years ago, and the number of cigars sent out<br/>
of the island advanced from <span style="color: #0000FF;">TI </span>millions to<br/>
113 <span style="color: #ff0000;">millons</span>. Why? Partly because of increased acreage, partly because of better<br/>
methods of curing and manufacturing, but<br/>
chiefly because the American has taught the<br/>
tobacco planter a new trick. Five years ago<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cigar </span>factories could not get a grade of<br/>
tobacco suitable for wrappers; the American<br/>

</span>PORTO RICO'S POPULATION IN 1900, BY <span style="color: #ff0000;">AGE<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportion </span>of children is higher than in any state in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>Union and the population under <span style="color: #0000FF;">ten </span>years (<span style="color: #ff0000;">31</span>%) is higher by 3<span style="color: #ff0000;">%<br/>
</span>than among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Negroes </span>of the South. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>elderly people<br/>

</span>THE MARRIAGE RELATION IN 1900<br/>
The proportion of single (including children) is higher than in<br/>
<br/>
any country outside <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the West Indies. Of the large number living<br/>
together by mutual consent, most could not <span style="color: #ff0000;">pay </span>the wedding <span style="color: #0000FF;">fees<br/>
<br/>
</span>showed him what could be done by growing<br/>
it under cheese-cloth. Now the Porto Rican's<br/>
tobacco patch looks like a circus tent covering<br/>
hundreds of acres.<br/>
<br/>
The tobacco story is yet in its first chapter.<br/>
A revolution has been going on in the factories<br/>
at the same time, and with the increasing market<br/>
comes the desire for more land. Only a small<br/>
portion of that suitable for tobacco has yet<br/>
been brought under cultivation. At the end<br/>
of another five years, cane may no longer be<br/>
king in Porto Rico.<br/>
<br/>
But from the coffee planter we have taken<br/>
away by legislation what we have given by<br/>
scientific agriculture, and have taken also<br/>
most of what he already had. That the<br/>
general prosperity has not intimately affected<br/>
him is the more regrettable in view of the large<br/>
area involved. Good times for the sugar<br/>
grower help the big planters along the coast.<br/>
Good times for the tobacco grower mean happiness in several coast districts and in the highlands along the military <span style="color: #0000FF;">road</span>. But distress<br/>
to the coffee planter affects the small planters<br/>
all over the island except in the cane districts.<br/>
<br/>
All over the centre of the island in 1898, you<br/>
could see the coffee growing on the hillsides<br/>
and on the slopes of the mountains-one of<br/>
the most beautiful regions in the world. These<br/>
mountains rise to great heights; there is <span style="color: #ff0000;">at<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">percentage </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">illiterates </span>was higher than in any state <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>then<br/>
