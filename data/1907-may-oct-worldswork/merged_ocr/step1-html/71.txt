<span style="color: #0000FF;">TRANSPORTING </span>FURS BY DOG TRAIN OVER AN ALASKAN TRAIL<br/>
<br/>
When one leaves the trade side of the question and studies furs in themselves, the subject<br/>
is as <span style="color: #0000FF;">fascinating </span>as the study of diamonds. Of<br/>
the expensive furs, none is better known or<br/>
more universally used than Persian lamb; and<br/>
about none are there more absurd errors current. One of the errors almost universally<br/>
believed is that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eurliest </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">glossiest </span>and<br/>
blackest Persian lamb is obtained by killing<br/>
the mother to get the unborn kid. This is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sheerest </span>nonsense. The great desideratum<br/>
in Persian lamb is to avoid the prevailing<br/>
reddish tinge that can be seen by holding the<br/>
fur up between you and the light. Germans<br/>
excel in the dyes of all sheep skins, <span style="color: #0000FF;">owing-it<br/>
</span>is said-to a quality in the waters of German<br/>
rivers and to the mineral properties of German<br/>
clays. But it need hardly be explained that<br/>
a pelt which is a beautiful jet black before<br/>
dressing will be a finer skin for the market than<br/>
the reddish pelt that has to be made black.<br/>
What owner of a herd of Persian sheep would<br/>
be such a fool <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>to kill a sheep that produced<br/>
these finest black lambs? It is to his interest<br/>
to keep her alive that she may produce more<br/>
lambs, and to take the very best care of her.<br/>
Besides, if the lambs <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>allowed to grow the<br/>
pelts will be larger.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Revillon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ercs</span>, who have large<br/>
sheep farms at Bokhara, in Persia, to supply<br/>
their Paris <span style="color: #0000FF;">trade</span>: "Do you ever, <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">any<br/>
</span>circumstances, slay the mother to <span style="color: #0000FF;">get </span>a good<br/>
pelt from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unborn </span>kid?"<br/>
<br/>
"No, never!" he answered. "The <span style="color: #0000FF;">way<br/>
</span>that false impression has arisen about Persian<br/>
lamb is this: when the summer heat becomes<br/>
<br/>
great, herders drive their sheep from the valleys<br/>
to the cooler heights of the mountains. On<br/>
the road, sometimes, a ewe dies of exhaustion.<br/>
Then, of course, the drovers take the pelt of<br/>
both mother and kid."<br/>
<br/>
Shiraz is known as the half-Persian lamb.<br/>
It comes from the south of Persia. The pelt<br/>
is curly but coarser, more like wool than fur.<br/>
Much of this is bought for high-grade Astrakhan<br/>
