<span>OPSONINS-A NEW HOPE FOR HEALTH<br/>
<br/>
the sick man's blood is discovered, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>amount of opsonic vaccine is indicated. To<br/>
make this plainer, let us rehearse the play.<br/>
<br/>
Scene: A medical laboratory. Persons in<br/>
the play<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>John Doe, suffering from tuberculosis;<br/>
Richard Roe, a healthy friend; Bacterius, an<br/>
expert germ chef.<br/>
<br/>
Bacterius, the laboratory man, has in a glass<br/>
tube a stock supply of living white blood-cells<br/>
which he has obtained from the blood of a<br/>
healthy person. These white blood-cells have<br/>
been separated from the other elements that<br/>
compose this sacrificial blood-offering. Bacterius now punctures the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ear-lobe </span>of sick John<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Doc</span>, secures a few drops of blood in a pipette,<br/>
and puts them into a whirling machine, which<br/>
quickly separates the red blood, white blood,<br/>
and serum into layers. He then places this<br/>
pipette alongside the one holding his "stock<br/>
supply" of white blood-corpuscles.<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile Bacterius has secured some<br/>
of the living tubercle germs from the expectorated mucus of sick John Doe and placed<br/>
them on a gelatine and agar jelly, where they<br/>
soon raise millions of other tubercle bacilli.<br/>
These he stews for two hours. Then he puts<br/>
this germ-stew into a bottle holding a number<br/>
of little glass shot, and shakes the bottle to<br/>
crush the germs and to press out their body<br/>
juices. It is this extract that strengthens the<br/>
opsonic forces of the blood liquid.<br/>
<br/>
Bacterius next places some of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">tubercle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stew </span>into a third pipette. Then he prepares<br/>
a fourth pipette of blood serum obtained from<br/>
the blood of the sick man's friend, Richard<br/>
Roe-healthy blood. So here are four pipettes:<br/>
.one .containing digesters (white blood-cells<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>only); another holding <span style="color: #0000FF;">crushed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tubercl√©-stew</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirfcontaining </span>John <span style="color: #ff0000;">Doe'i </span>blood in three<br/>
layers, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">opsonic </span>serum layer on top; the<br/>
fourth holding Richard <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roe</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>specimen of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">healthy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blood</span>. Bacterius now takes another<br/>
kind of pipette and draws equal parts of John<br/>
Doe's serum, the bacilli-stew, and the white<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">blood-cells</span>, and mixes them. He places this<br/>
mixture in a chamber heated to blood heat<br/>
to warm the white blood-cells and their prey,<br/>
the tubercle bacilli. They are kept here for<br/>
twenty minutes. According to the opsonic<br/>
power of the serum in this mixture, each of the<br/>
white blood-cells will <span style="color: #0000FF;">engulf </span>a certain average<br/>
number of bacilli. Bacterius warms another<br/>
mixture, which contains the healthy serum<br/>
from Richard Roe's blood. He now has the<br/>
Doe and Roe mixtures ready for comparison.<br/>
<br/>
9433<br/>
<br/>
He spreads the Doe mixture on one microscopic cover-glass (like a miniature <span style="color: #ff0000;">watchcrystal</span>), and the Roe mixture on another;<br/>
placing each under a high-power microscope,<br/>
he counts the number of bacilli found in a<br/>
hundred white blood-corpuscles in each specimen. Dividing the total by 100, he has the<br/>
average in each cell in both specimens. Suppose there are 300 bacilli lying in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'IOO </span>white<br/>
blood-cells in John Doe's specimen (average<br/>
3), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>in Roe's specimen (average 5);<br/>
this shows that healthy Richard Roe's opsonic<br/>
power is <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>to 3 better than the sick man's,<br/>
or 40 per cent. stronger. This determines<br/>
the amount of the vaccine (the tubercle bacilli<br/>
stew) needed to bring <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sick man's opsonic<br/>
power up to that of normal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roe</span>'s blood.<br/>
<br/>
We might make this complex laboratory<br/>
play still more simple by assuming the white<br/>
blood-cells to be sharks; the tubercle germs to<br/>
be minnows; and the blood serum specimens<br/>
from Doe and Roe as two water tanks, with one<br/>
more salty than the other-and assume also<br/>
that the saltier the water the more minnows<br/>
the sharks would eat. Then Bacterius would<br/>
put the same number of minnows in each tank<br/>
and an equal number of sharks in each, and<br/>
leave them together for twenty minutes. Then<br/>
he would take a hundred sharks from Doe's<br/>
tank, cut them open and see how many minnows<br/>
they had eaten; then he would do the same with<br/>
the sharks in the Roe tank and compare the<br/>
two. Then he would know how much saltier<br/>
(opsonic) was the water of one tank than that<br/>
of the other<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE MESSAGE <span style="color: #ff0000;">OF</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">HOPE<br/>
</span>The verdict of'medical science <span style="color: #ff0000;">sorropsonins<br/>
</span>may determine the fate <span style="color: #0000FF;">of-million</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>of men.<br/>
Thousands of careful tests are being made<br/>
with typhoid, tubercular, eruptive, and other<br/>
opsonic vaccines, but not <span style="color: #0000FF;">until </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great many<br/>
results have been compared with the usual<br/>
results will we begin to know the real value of<br/>
opsonins. Their best showing thus far is in<br/>
cases of skin eruptions. Typhoid results have<br/>
not been so good. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tests </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">tuberculosis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Koch</span>'s newest "tuberculin" (an opsonic <span style="color: #0000FF;">vac<br/>
</span>cine) being employed in many cases-encourage<br/>
further experiment. One thing seems certain<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-that </span>Wright's opsonic discoveries mark a<br/>
genuine advance in the field of acquired<br/>
immunity or serum treatment, and it will not<br/>
be long before investigators will have <span style="color: #0000FF;">determined </span>the specific value of opsonins.<br/>
