<br/>
The conversation now is not about Reconstruction. In one place it is about alfalfa, in<br/>
another it is about stock, in another about corn.<br/>
You hear of any number of agricultural<br/>
products besides cotton, and cotton itself has a<br/>
new meaning. There is as much difference<br/>
between cotton at <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>or six cents a pound <span style="color: #0000FF;">ind<br/>
</span>cotton at ten or twelve cents a pound, as there<br/>
is between poverty and affluence. I doubt if<br/>
anywhere in the world there has been so rapid<br/>
a change in what may be called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fundamentals </span>of good living and of, sound thinking<br/>

and of cheerful work, as the change that has<br/>
taken place these ten years in many of these<br/>
rural districts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>farmer who was in debt<br/>
to his "factor" now has money in the bank,<br/>
a bank that itself did not exist ten years ago.<br/>
The inherent good nature of the people approaches something like hilarity. If you<br/>
direct the conversation toward prosperity,<br/>
they will crack jokes with you about the needy<br/>
condition of Wall Street, and remind you that<br/>
their banks have money lent at interest in New<br/>
York.<br/>
<br/>
I think that every educational institution<br/>
that I visited has a new building or more than<br/>
one. The men that you talk with speak less<br/>
of their poverty of equipment and tell you, with<br/>
pride, what has been done within the last five<br/>
years. I suppose that the most hopeless places<br/>
in the world a decade ago were the offices<br/>
of the superintendents of public instruction<br/>
in most of these commonwealth; In some of<br/>
them, you would find men without hope, without plans, without any adequate knowledge of<br/>

Looking toward the Capitol where Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as President of the Confederacy. Every <span style="color: #0000FF;">year<br/>
</span>50,000 bales of cotton are brought into Montgomery by wagon, and sold in the public square<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>It is also one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">great<br/>
