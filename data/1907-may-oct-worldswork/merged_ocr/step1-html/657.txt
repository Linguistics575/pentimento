<span>OUR TOWN LIFE-WHAT IS IT WORTH?<br/>
<br/>
in the mayor's hands. Next they elected a<br/>
non-partisan set of officials from the decent<br/>
element. After a stiff fight the open gambling<br/>
was stopped. The nickel-in-the-slot machines<br/>
were the hardest to root out, but they had to go.<br/>
The hours of opening of saloons were regulated<br/>
better. The police department was improved<br/>
and lawlessness stamped out. The Chinese<br/>
lotteries were pretty well cleaned up.<br/>
<br/>
We are still far from model in our regulation<br/>
of these things, but our town is no <span style="color: #0000FF;">longer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>frontier inferno, and it is a better place for a<br/>
boy to grow up in than it used to be.<br/>
<br/>
Socially, our regeneration has passed through<br/>
some important evolutions. The women began<br/>
it-that was their job while the men cleaned up<br/>
politics-with some literary clubs. Culture<br/>
soon stalked in our midst with thunderous<br/>
tread. Our ladies dissected Shakespeare and<br/>
probed Browning's mysteries, and recovered<br/>
from these fatiguing operations with tea. The<br/>
encyclopedias in the public library grew worn<br/>
and aged, as the pursuit for culture <span style="color: #0000FF;">galloped<br/>
</span>through them. Books on art-pardon, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Artwere </span>in demand. The favorite authors of all<br/>
ages were kept day and night in uniform at<br/>
call, even including that prolific old standby,<br/>
Mr. "Ibid," whose works one lady demanded<br/>
should be included in the reading course of one<br/>
study club. Even to this day our women's<br/>
clubs <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourish </span>and are increasingly useful. They<br/>
have brought an esthetic element into our life<br/>
that we were <span style="color: #ff0000;">wofully </span>lacking in. They have<br/>
brought lecturers to our town who have told<br/>
us of the progress of art and science all over<br/>
the world. They have brought great musicians<br/>
-Paderewski, Ysaye, Hoffman, Gadski, and<br/>
their like-to interpret the world's best music<br/>
for us. They have led the movement for more<br/>
beautiful avenues about our town. And where<br/>
we were once only amused or indulgent with<br/>
their work, we now take it seriously and thank<br/>
them for its results, as they deserve.<br/>
<br/>
We draw social lines, perhaps loosely, but<br/>
still they are there. Our Southern remnant<br/>
hangs together fairly well, rallying around the<br/>
organization of the Daughters of the Confederacy and an occasional supper of'Possum, with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">yarns</span>, from down South. Then the pioneers<br/>
of the county, who still call everything east of<br/>
the mountains "the States," form a looser<br/>
social circle. Of course, the churches form<br/>
their own centres of social activity. The labor<br/>
unions-we are unionized clear through from<br/>
cooks to retail <span style="color: #ff0000;">clerks-Hose </span>members are<br/>
<br/>
9455<br/>
<br/>
nearly all members of "fraternal orders,"<br/>
centre their relaxation around these orders.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have our vulgar rich crowd. The<br/>
rest of us disapprove of them. There is too<br/>
much drinking and gambling and smoking by<br/>
men and women in that crowd, and we frown<br/>
on them. Some of the women break into the<br/>
culture clubs and are socially redeemed, but<br/>
we let most of them go their vulgar, boisterous<br/>
ostentatious way, ignoring them. But we must<br/>
confess that they seem to get a good deal of<br/>
gross animal enjoyment out of life, which<br/>
irritates us. They are "common," and we<br/>
don't understand why they should have the<br/>
money when we could use it so much better to<br/>
minister to our higher and more delicate<br/>
cravings.<br/>
<br/>
Not all our rich people, of course, nor anything like all of them, come under the head of<br/>
our "vulgar" rich. Most of our well-to-do<br/>
people are simply ourselves grown a little better<br/>
off than our neighbors, and our new possessions<br/>
do not affect our neighborliness nor our<br/>
manners. Some of our richest citizens are even<br/>
conspicuously public spirited, being leaders in<br/>
the support of our library, our Y. M. C. A., our<br/>
good roads movement, and our political reforms.<br/>
<br/>
Our social diversions have improved in some<br/>
respects. Fifteen years ago, in the hot weather,<br/>
the ladies went to the Coast or the mountains to<br/>
keep cool, while the men worked and perspired<br/>
in the valley town. Thus grew up the Alfalfa<br/>
Club, or order of temporary widowers. The<br/>
members met in the cool of the evening on some<br/>
man's lawn, with a keg of beer for refreshments,<br/>
and proceeded to make Rome howl with song<br/>
and story. At about ten o'clock the Wienerwurst band appeared, consisting of musicians-or at least men with musical <span style="color: #0000FF;">instruments-dressed </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">ragamufnn </span>style, each man playing<br/>
a different tune, the whole discord being a<br/>
chorus for the high-pitched cornet's air which<br/>
was invariably "There'll Be a Hot Time in<br/>
the Old Town To-night."<br/>
<br/>
The Alfalfa Club is a tradition now, and the<br/>
Gentlemen's Club is its successor. This latter<br/>
has pleasant quarters and is run like any wellordered men's club anywhere. Its membership<br/>
includes many of the best professional and<br/>
business men in town.<br/>
<br/>
Our social progress now is chronicled in a<br/>
Society column, in the papers-I had almost<br/>
forgot to say that we have three daily papers<br/>
now, with full press dispatches. Here we print<br/>
the picture of yesterday's bride and groom, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or<br/>
