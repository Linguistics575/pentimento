institution a school of art as well as of philosophy and science. He has also served as<br/>
instructor in Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, and in<br/>
the Art Students' League and the Academy<br/>
of Design in New York. Some of his pupils<br/>
are themselves artists; <span style="color: #0000FF;">others </span>have become architects, landscape designers, and draughtsmen.<br/>
Others are still at work under his direction.<br/>

MRS. MACNEIL'S WORK<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Carol Brooks MacNeil is the daughter<br/>
of an artist and grew up with brushes and<br/>
palettes. When she threw them aside in her<br/>
preference for clay and modeling tools, it was<br/>
a keen disappointment to her father, but the<br/>
success of her work has justified her decision.<br/>
She might be called a miniature sculptor, if<br/>
there is such a phrase, for her creations are not<br/>
of statuesque proportions. Portrait busts she<br/>
has done, and they are well done; but her<br/>
originality has run rather to unique designs for<br/>
vases, inkstands, fountains, and other articles<br/>
of practical utility. They are spun from pure<br/>
fancy with only enough of the solidly real to<br/>
hold them down to earth.<br/>

wilting under the suddenly realized sentence.<br/>
This work in marble is now owned by the elder<br/>
Mrs. Cyrus McCormick, of Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. MacNeil has recently modeled her two<br/>
beautiful boys in one group and is now engaged<br/>
in transforming the plaster into more enduring<br/>
marble. This part of the sculptor's work is<br/>
generally turned over to the professional <span style="color: #ff0000;">marblecutter</span>, but this portrait bust of her two sons<br/>
will be the work of her own hands and may<br/>
therefore have a quality of tender finish that<br/>
it might not otherwise receive.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. MacNeil finds time for her children, her<br/>
friends, and her music. The MacNeil home at<br/>
College Point overlooks the Sound, with its<br/>
fleet of yachts and pleasure craft. It is a<br/>
quiet, beautiful spot where plants and children<br/>
grow in the sunshine, and yet is within easy<br/>
reach of New York City. In the summertime, Mr. MacNeil is often to be found at work<br/>
in the open air back of his studio, either in<br/>
front of a modeling stand or in a diminutive<br/>
garden. When the tide comes in, he and his<br/>
boys throw down their tools and hasten into<br/>
their bathing suits for an hour of recreation.<br/>
In an atmosphere of natural and unrestrained<br/>
joy, the sculptors MacNeil live their lives and<br/>
do their chosen work.<br/>

GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN<br/>
<br/>
THE SUPERIORITY OF A SMALL COMMISSION OVER THE<br/>
ANTIQUATED SYSTEM OF MAYOR AND COUNCILMEN<br/>

<br/>
PRESIDENT or HARVARD <span style="color: #0000FF;">UNIVERSITY<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">UNICIPAL </span>government in the United<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>States has nowhere been successful,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in many places it has been so<br/>
corrupt and inefficient as to suggest to anxious<br/>
minds the ultimate failure of free institutions.<br/>
Yet municipal government comes nearer to<br/>
the individual citizen than any other sort of<br/>
government. If the municipal business is well<br/>
done, it promotes the comfort and dignity of<br/>
his own life and that of his family. If it is ill<br/>
done, it stains and degrades his whole existence.<br/>
The mere sight of municipal work done dishonestly, or merely shiftlessly, is extremely<br/>
demoralizing for all citizens. Their own<br/>
<br/>
standards of work may easily be affected by<br/>
the standards of municipal work; and any dishonesty or lack of fidelity in municipal servants<br/>
is sure to rob the mass of citizens of securities,<br/>
comforts, or facilities which they need, and<br/>
have paid for directly or indirectly. Moreover,<br/>
corruption and fraud in municipal administration tend to penetrate the larger <span style="color: #0000FF;">administrations </span>of the state and the nation. Let us<br/>
first examine some of the sources of municipal<br/>
failure in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, the structure of the city<br/>
government in this country was a <span style="color: #ff0000;">mostiunfortynate </span>one<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It was copied early in the nine<br/>
