foods are perfectly harmless, and others are<br/>
deadly. They should all be classified in<br/>
national law. Some methods of preserving<br/>
meats are practically harmless, if the meats are<br/>
thoroughly soaked and washed free from the<br/>
drugs; but who shall make the method <span style="color: #ff0000;">foolcook </span>proof? Some adulterations are not only<br/>
harmless, but actually desirable.<br/>
<br/>
NO "GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED" FOODS<br/>
<br/>
The patent-medicine industry is rapidly<br/>
being put in well deserved strait-jackets, but<br/>
it has set the pace for makers of patent and<br/>
proprietary foods. The objection is not to<br/>
honest refinement in food manufacture, but<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">trade-marking </span>foods whose composition is<br/>
kept secret, and whose values are whatever<br/>
the makers' standards of morality choose to<br/>
claim for <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>
<br/>
</span>The new Pure Food law prohibits specified<br/>
articles in candy-making; prohibits mixture of<br/>
a cheaper article with one claiming to be all of<br/>
the best, as mixing "compound lard" with<br/>
pure leaf lard and calling it all "pure leaf lard";<br/>
or adding any injurious substance to such<br/>
standard, such as an injurious amount of<br/>
benzoic acid, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">cochineal </span>to ketchup; but<br/>
it does not declare how much is injurious, nor<br/>
does it even classify preservatives and coloring<br/>
matters into "safe" and "unsafe," but it<br/>
prohibits the use of anything that conceals<br/>
inferiority, such as red ochre on hamburger<br/>
steak, to make a stale article look fresh. It<br/>
permits an unhealthy amount of preservative<br/>
to be used on meats intended for distant shipment, provided it can be washed or macerated<br/>
out by water before being cooked, but the label<br/>
must give directions for such removal. It<br/>
prohibits any use of spoiled meats or vegetables;<br/>
so it may prevent the manufacture of ketchup<br/>
from the soured tomato remnants of a canning<br/>
factory, or curtail the use of renovated butter<br/>
or spoiled milk. It prohibits the use of trademarks by other than rightful owners; and<br/>
labeling that tends to deceive, such as naming<br/>
the product by the principal ingredient only.<br/>
It prohibits false statements as to weight and<br/>
measure, and any falsification on the label or<br/>
package; but this does not prevent "<span style="color: #0000FF;">drawing<br/>
</span>the long bow" in advertising. It permits<br/>
secrecy to proprietary food makers as to exact<br/>
composition, provided the makers satisfy the<br/>
Government that no harmful ingredients are<br/>
used. This lets the public know that the article<br/>
will not do any harm, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">tuts </span>no limit on<br/>
<br/>
WHAT THE FOOD LAW SAVES US FROM<br/>
<br/>
the exaggerated claims that may be made<br/>
for it. The law registers an article under<br/>
a given number on statement by its manufacturer or wholesaler that it is sold in conformity with the law, and that he is responsible, not the retailer, in case of a suit for<br/>
damages. This unfortunate use of the word<br/>
"guarantee" has been falsely used to lead the<br/>
public to believe that the Government guarantees the purity and wholesomeness of the article,<br/>
whereas it does nothing of the sort. Secretary<br/>
Wilson has recently issued a special order to<br/>
put a stop to this deceptive practice.<br/>
<br/>
MORE GOVERNMENT EXPERTS NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
Authority is conferred upon the Secretary<br/>
of Agriculture, and by him conferred upon the<br/>
Bureau of Chemistry, to from time to time<br/>
make "regulations" which shall arbitrarily<br/>
decide what are wholesome or harmful foods,<br/>
preservatives, coloring matters, essences, etc.<br/>
It also allows interested manufacturers to be<br/>
heard before such regulations are issued.<br/>
Thus, what was lacking in specification in the<br/>
food law is to be incorporated from time to<br/>
time. Our Bureau of Chemistry becomes our<br/>
national formulary of foods. In the absence<br/>
of any national food "Pharmacopeia," we<br/>
must rely upon Dr. Wiley and his advisers to<br/>
rule upon the wisdom of using benzoic acid,<br/>
salicylic acid, formaldehyde, coal-tar essences<br/>
and dyes, and a multitude of unsettled food<br/>
problems. But the medical profession believes<br/>
that such arbitrary powers should be placed in<br/>
the hands of a number of experts, for the subject is too vast to permit any one man to master<br/>
it, even with many subordinate experts to<br/>
advise him.<br/>
<br/>
DANGER IN THE BROKEN PACKAGE<br/>
<br/>
If a high-class firm sells pure leaf lard in<br/>
large tierces to the retailer for one price, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ordinary </span>hog lard for less, and "compound lard"<br/>
(cotton-seed oil and stearine) cheaper yet, and<br/>
the retailer mixes the cheapest with the best<br/>
and sells to the consumer out of the best<br/>
lard's can, and at best lard's price, it becomes<br/>
a gross fraud.<br/>
<br/>
Now the Government makes the manufacturer, not the retailer, responsible for<br/>
reliability here. The food situation, therefore,<br/>
seems to drive us to the unbroken package, in<br/>
everything capable of adulteration by the<br/>
retailer, or specially tempting to him. In<br/>
such a list sausage, lard, maple syrup, wines<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
