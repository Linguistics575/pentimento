</span>Montgomery's idea to establish on these wild<br/>
lands a Negro colony, and his plan was heartily<br/>
seconded by the officers of the railroad. In the<br/>
spring of 1887, accompanied by a civil <span style="color: #0000FF;">engineer</span>, he made a personal inspection of these<br/>
lands and finally located a site for the present<br/>
town on the line of the railroad 104 miles south<br/>
of Memphis and 116 miles north of Vicksburg.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty years ago, this whole region was<br/>
wild and inaccessible. The country was covered with a heavy hardwood forest, which<br/>
united with a dense undergrowth of briars<br/>
and cane to make a dense jungle, through<br/>
which it was only possible to thread one's<br/>
way by the use of a magnetic needle,<br/>
cutting the path as one proceeded. Through<br/>
this semi-tropical jungle, the railroad had<br/>
blazed a wide furrow for a distance of 200<br/>
miles from Memphis to Vicksburg, along<br/>
which were scattered a few straggling villages,<br/>
with here and there a larger town.<br/>
<br/>
One morning in the fall of 1887, a northbound train stopped in the midst of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">wildeiness</span>, a party of Negroes stepped off, and the<br/>
train went its way. The leader of the group,<br/>
a small, slender man, with strongly marked<br/>
features and a deliberate and thoughtful manner, held in his hand a plot, which he looked<br/>
at from time to time. This was Isaiah T.<br/>
Montgomery and the men with him were the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>contingent of prospective settlers.<br/>
<br/>
It was not easy, as I have often heard Mr.<br/>
Montgomery say, to find settlers in that early<br/>
day. The task of taming this wild country<br/>
seemed hopeless to men with so few resources<br/>
and so little experience. On this particular<br/>
morning, Mr. Montgomery thought it best to<br/>
make a little speech before proceeding with<br/>
the work that had brought them thither.<br/>
<br/>
"You see," he said, waving his hand in the<br/>
direction of the forest, "this is a pretty wild<br/>
place." He paused, and the men looked<br/>
hesitatingly in the direction he had indicated,<br/>
but said nothing.<br/>
<br/>
"But this whole country," he continued,<br/>
"was like this once. You have seen it change.<br/>
You and your fathers have, for the most part,<br/>
performed the work that has made it what it is.<br/>
You and your fathers did this for some one else.<br/>
Can't you do as much now for yourselves?"<br/>
<br/>
The men picked up their axes and attacked<br/>
the wilderness. The idea of the thing got<br/>
hold of the minds of some of them, so they<br/>
went back home and prepared to return and<br/>
take up the work of pioneers. It was not<br/>

<br/>
until February, 1888, however, that the first<br/>
permanent settlers moved in. A month later<br/>
the ground was cleared sufficiently to set up a<br/>
small store. Two dwellings were also erected.<br/>
A few of these early buildings may still be seen<br/>
in remote corners of the community. They<br/>
were constructed of the materials at hand,<br/>
walls of rough-hewn logs, roofed with a sort<br/>
of shingle split with an axe from hardwood<br/>
blocks.<br/>
<br/>
There was, of course, no land to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivated </span>when the first settlers arrived on the<br/>
scene and no crop-lien system to provide in<br/>
advance for provisions until something could<br/>
be earned from the land. But the railroads<br/>
needed <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross-ties </span>for their constantly extending<br/>
lines. Timber agents came along in search<br/>
of stave-bolts and spoke-material. This gave<br/>
the settlers a chance to earn something while<br/>
they were clearing the land. In this way the<br/>
colonists solved the problem of living off the<br/>
wilderness while they were engaged in subduing it. At the end of three years they had<br/>
located and purchased 4,078 acres of land and<br/>
had cleared and made ready for cultivation<br/>
some 1,250 acres. They had earned during<br/>
this time $ 8,780 from their timber operations<br/>
and had raised 379 bales of cotton and 3,045<br/>
bushels of corn on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">65 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>acres of land which<br/>
they had cleared.<br/>
<br/>
The wilderness had become the frontier.<br/>
The colonists came in faster now. The ragged<br/>
outline of the forest steadily receded in all<br/>
directions and large areas were opened for<br/>
cultivation in the surrounding territory.<br/>
<br/>
THE GROWTH OF THE COLONY<br/>
<br/>
It was not the ordinary Negro farmer who<br/>
was attracted to Mound Bayou colony. It<br/>
was rather an earnest and ambitious class<br/>
prepared to face the hardships of this sort of<br/>
pioneer work. The scheme was widely <span style="color: #0000FF;">advertised </span>among the Negro farmers <span style="color: #ff0000;">thoughout<br/>
</span>the state and drew immigrants from all parts<br/>
of Mississippi, and a certain number from other<br/>
states. Some of the most valuable settlers in<br/>
the community came from the "white-capping"<br/>
counties in the southern part of the state. No<br/>
doubt, the fact that the men who settled Mound<br/>
Bayou are a select class has been an important<br/>
factor in its success.<br/>
<br/>
After twenty years of existence, Mound Bayou<br/>
colony numbers about 800 families, making<br/>
a total population of some 4,000 persons.<br/>
