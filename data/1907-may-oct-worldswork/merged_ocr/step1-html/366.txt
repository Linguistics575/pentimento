<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9101 </span>THE MARCH<br/>
conditions have lately become more and more<br/>
alarmed about. We have no adequate <span style="color: #0000FF;">machinery </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>training boys for high hand-work; and<br/>
there is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">increasing </span>social <span style="color: #0000FF;">disinclination </span>to<br/>
take up the trades. Some of the few trade<br/>
schools that we have lack as many pupils as<br/>
they could train, because boys of ability and<br/>
earnestness prefer the more "respectable"<br/>
life of business and of the professions. A lad<br/>
will become a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank-clerk </span>for $ 10 a week who<br/>
would scorn to become an iron moulder for $ 20,<br/>
in spite of the fact that the moulder is the more<br/>
likely, if he have thrift and executive ability,<br/>
to attain independence.<br/>
<br/>
On one side the workingmen's organizations<br/>
discourage the highest <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency </span>and on the<br/>
other side our educational <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>and our social<br/>
life set up false standards. It is high time<br/>
we were <span style="color: #0000FF;">waking </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>to the peril in which this<br/>
puts American life; and the many <span style="color: #0000FF;">signs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>we<br/>
are waking up are <span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>the most cheerful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">facts </span>of present activity<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE OPEN SHOP CAMPAIGN<br/>
<br/>
HE National Association of Manufacturers is alive to the danger to our<br/>
industries that a lack of workmen's <span style="color: #ff0000;">cfficiency<br/>
</span>brings. Under the presidency of Mr. James<br/>
W. Van Cleave, of St. Louis, the Association<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">undertaking</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tro </span>arouse the public to the full<br/>
truth of our industrial situation. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Its </span>platform<br/>
has as its principal plank the open shop. The<br/>
open shop means: "No restrictions in the<br/>
use of tools, machinery or materials, except<br/>
of such as are <span style="color: #ff0000;">unsafe</span>; no <span style="color: #0000FF;">limitation </span>of output;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mo </span>restriction of the number of apprentices<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">yantl </span>helpers, when of proper <span style="color: #ff0000;">ageino</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">boycott</span>;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sympathetic</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>strike; <span style="color: #ff0000;">no'fsaeriiiee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the<br/>
independent workingman <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>labor union;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mo </span>compulsory use of the union label.<span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">principles </span>are necessary for American<br/>
industrial progress. For that matter they are<br/>
necessary even for social or political progress.<br/>
Under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the unions, apprentices<br/>
have been restricted, the boycott and the<br/>
sympathetic strike have been used to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">damage<br/>
</span>of innocent persons, and output has been<br/>
limited. Worse yet, where they have had<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>political influence, graft has thriven<br/>
-necessarily because politics rested on a<br/>
false basis. Worse yet, our social notions<br/>
have so changed that the skilled trades are not<br/>
as attractive to American youth as they once<br/>
were and must become again<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Association </span>of Manufacturers, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
local organizations, is systematically undertaking a campaign of education, using every<br/>
legitimate method of persuasion; and it will<br/>
establish labor bureaus where workmen may<br/>
find employment and employers may find<br/>
workmen. Every State will have its committee to further the Association's aims. And<br/>
it is undertaking a general campaign for the<br/>
establishment of trade <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-schools </span>as a part<br/>
of the public school system. This is the<br/>
solution of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diflicOy </span>that seems most<br/>
promising and most probable.<br/>
<br/>
THE OPEN SHOP-A CASE IN POINT<br/>
<br/>
HE efforts of ill-managed labor unions<br/>
<br/>
to obstruct industrial progress are illus<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">trated </span>by a little occurrence in the press-room<br/>
of THE WORLD's WORK.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical feeders are now made which<br/>
feed paper to printing presses with greater<br/>
regularity and at greater speed and consequently<br/>
with greater economy than men can feed it;<br/>
and the presses on which this magazine is<br/>
printed are equipped with these mechanical<br/>
feeders. The Feeders' Union in New York<br/>
demanded that as many men should be employed in this shop as would <span style="color: #0000FF;">Joe </span>required if<br/>
no mechanical feeder had been invented.<br/>
<br/>
This demand means that a number of men<br/>
must be kept at full wages whose sole duty it<br/>
would be to stand (or to sit) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">machinery </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">run-c-see </span>the presses fed better than<br/>
they could feed them. When the owners of the<br/>
shop declined to accede to this demand, all<br/>
the feeders and the pressmen as well, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>had<br/>
not even the feeders' excuse, went out. Some<br/>
of them, or their fellows of the union, are now<br/>
spending their days on the street nearby <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>"pickets," <span style="color: #0000FF;">endeavoring </span>to persuade the men<br/>
who have their places to give up their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
This demand is the same as to say that a<br/>
shoe-manufacturer who pegs shoes by <span style="color: #0000FF;">machinery </span>must employ as many shoemakers as would<br/>
be necessary to peg by hand all the shoes that<br/>
he makes by machinery. It is the same as to<br/>
say that a cotton-manufacturer must employ<br/>
as many women as could spin by hand all the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">thread-product </span>of his mill; and so on. In a<br/>
word, the industrial advance made by machinery must be stopped! This in the face of the<br/>
fact that every competent pressman in the<br/>
United States can get a job at good wages.<br/>
<br/>
When a union or any other set of men <span style="color: #0000FF;">under</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">takes </span>so large a task as checking the use of<br/>
machinery, they make a pitiful display of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
