<span>THE PEOPLE, THE RAILROADS, AND THE GOVERNMENT<br/>
<br/>
the enlightened legislator must be to <span style="color: #0000FF;">correct<br/>
</span>as far as possible existing errors, to make a<br/>
repetition of them impossible, and to establish<br/>
a permanent basis upon which the people<br/>
and the railroad can transact their business<br/>
in the future without injustice either to one or<br/>
to the other.<br/>
<br/>
The current created by the existing agitation<br/>
must be turned into a safer channel, or great<br/>
harm will be done, both to the railroads and to<br/>
the people. This agitation has now reached<br/>
a point where it may be said to carry a threat<br/>
to the general welfare of the country; because<br/>
it threatens to affect the industrial enterprises<br/>
of the country, with the millions of men,<br/>
women, and children directly dependent upon<br/>
these enterprises. I do not believe that the<br/>
people desire the destruction of the railroad<br/>
properties; and I believe that the people, the<br/>
Government, and the railroads are united in<br/>
the desire to turn this current of agitation from<br/>
destruction to construction.<br/>
<br/>
The public demands that the railroads of the<br/>
United States shall be so regulated by law as to<br/>
prevent future injustice in their management<br/>
or discrimination in their conduct. The<br/>
Government of the United States is shaping its administrative policy to that end.<br/>
As a railroad manager and as an individual,<br/>
I heartily endorse this policy, and shall do all<br/>
I can to promote such a course.<br/>
<br/>
We are not planning and legislating for <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day<br/>
</span>alone, but for to-morrow, when there will be<br/>
more than 100,000,000 people in the United<br/>
States, producing and consuming. Therefore the problem of a fair adjustment between<br/>
the railroads and the people through the<br/>
Government is a problem of greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">responsibility </span>than any other problem of the<br/>
generation. We must face it with open minds,<br/>
laying aside all personal ambition and our<br/>
private prejudice to seek <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the_good </span>of all<br/>
the people, which is also the good of all the<br/>
railroads.<br/>
<br/>
I should like to take up in sections the several<br/>
points that seem to form the basis, not only<br/>
of the popular agitation, but also of most of the<br/>
legislation, wise and unwise, now proposed by<br/>
the lawmakers of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
I. Elimination <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Rebate<br/>
<br/>
The Hepburn Act is effective, and is both<br/>
just and wise. As time goes on, the machinery<br/>
for the enforcement of the Act will improve,<br/>
and should improve, and the enlightened<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9149<br/>
<br/>
</span>railroad m<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13 </span>will <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperate </span>with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Governmen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">u</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>with the people to enforce the<br/>
law. I believe in the principle of the Act,<br/>
which is that there shall be uniformity of<br/>
charges without illegal discrimination or<br/>
unlawful devices to any class of shippers or<br/>
communities as against another. I believe<br/>
that the rebate is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tlf'ig </span>of the past, as a principle, even though in the very nature of things<br/>
there will probably never be absolute perfection<br/>
in this matter any more than there can be perfection in the matter of mail delivery, army<br/>
administration, or any other organized administrative function involving such a large percentage of our population.<br/>
<br/>
2. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">valuation </span>of Railroads<br/>
<br/>
Valuation for the purpose of establishing<br/>
a basis for fixing transportation charges would<br/>
not be of any disadvantage to the railroads,<br/>
except to further disturb present financial<br/>
conditions, but of no practical value for the<br/>
purpose of arriving at a fair and equitable basis<br/>
for rate-making, and I do not believe that it<br/>
would cure the existing ills.<br/>
<br/>
As a railroad manager, I should not<br/>
oppose it, nor do I see how the right of the<br/>
Government to make such valuation can be<br/>
challenged, even though I doubt its ultimate<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency </span>in accomplishing the practical results<br/>
for which it is being urged. The expense it<br/>
would entail on the Government would be unwise, as all the elements constituting the principle of fair and equitable rates can be had<br/>
through other sources of information at the<br/>
Government's command-which will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliable </span>while the valuation theory will not.<br/>
<br/>
3. The Limitation of Future Security Issues<br/>
<br/>
This plank in the most radical of all platforms meets my views. I believe that the<br/>
capitalization of the railroads should be directly<br/>
under Federal law, which would provide<br/>
Federal authority to construct and operate a<br/>
railroad, the purpose of which is to engage in<br/>
interstate traffic either <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>its own rails or<br/>
through connecting lines. Such legislation<br/>
should.be made with the fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearly </span>in mind<br/>
that in some sections of this country there are<br/>
large areas that need railroads, and that they<br/>
cannot get the railroads unless the builders<br/>
are allowed to make a profit, or to see the chance<br/>
of profits, on the building. The law should,<br/>
however, make it impossible to gain these<br/>
profits more than once; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">requirements<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
