</span>woman was doing full work again, but living<br/>
at the institution under the daily observation of<br/>
a physician. The patient should not return to<br/>
his home life until correct habits as to hours of<br/>
work, exercise, sleep, bathing, recreation, and<br/>
so on, have been worked out satisfactorily and<br/>
have become thoroughly established.<br/>
<br/>
We individuals all differ; no two persons are<br/>
alike. Individual equations in each one of<br/>
these cases should be solved, and then habits<br/>
thoroughly established. It is not a thing that<br/>
can be done suddenly. It needs long observation on the part of a physician specially trained<br/>
for such work. It involves a consideration of<br/>
the mental states, the emotional states, the<br/>
methods of work, the temperament of the<br/>
individual, his education and experience, his<br/>
age, and his financial resources'.<br/>
<br/>
This health education having once been<br/>
thoroughly done, there should not arise the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9125<br/>
<br/>
</span>necessity for it to be done again. It should<br/>
mean a large increase of power throughout all<br/>
the subsequent life of the individual. If his<br/>
stomach is weak, he should discover how to<br/>
handle it most wisely. Has he a weak heart?<br/>
He should learn to work so as to get the most<br/>
out of himself with the least danger. Has he a<br/>
nervous system that is apt to play him false in<br/>
times of great pressure? He must learn how<br/>
to get the very best work out of this defective<br/>
piece of machinery, unless indeed it be possible to remove the cause within the nervous<br/>
system itself, so that the weakness no longer<br/>
exists and he shall not, therefore, be obliged<br/>
to look after it.<br/>
<br/>
To know one's limitations is the first step to<br/>
success. To know how far one can venture<br/>
with safety is to be able to charge right up to<br/>
the danger line with the confidence and audacity<br/>
that win out.<br/>

A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES<br/>
<br/>
MOUND BAYOU, MISS., AN EXAMPLE OF THRIFT AND SELF-GOVERNMENT<br/>

<br/>
counties of Mississippi for two reasons:<br/>
it contains the richest soil in the famous<br/>
Yazoo Delta, and it possesses the only regularly<br/>
constituted Negro town in the Southern States.<br/>
This town, called Mound Bayou, gets its name<br/>
from a large mound, a relic of the prehistoric<br/>
inhabitants of the country, which marks the<br/>
junction of two of the numerous bayous that<br/>
make so important a part of the natural drainage system of this low and level land.<br/>
Situated in the heart of the wide alluvial<br/>
plain between the Mississippi and the Yazoo<br/>
Rivers, Mound Bayou is the centre of a Negro<br/>
population more dense than can be found anywhere else outside of Africa. The Negroes outnumber the whites seven to one throughout<br/>
the Delta. There are whole sections of these<br/>
rich bottom-lands where no white man lives.<br/>
Mound Bayou and the territory for several<br/>
miles around it on every side is one such section<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>Negro colony, occupying 30,000 acres, all<br/>
of which is owned by Negroes, most of them<br/>
small farmers who till 40 and 80-acre tracts.<br/>
<br/>
B OLIVAR COUNTY is noted among the<br/>
<br/>
The town itself has, at present, a population of<br/>
about 500. Of these, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eightrthree </span>are registered voters.<br/>
<br/>
Mound Bayou is a self-governing community.<br/>
That is one of the interesting things about it.<br/>
It has had, since it was incorporated in 1898,<br/>
a mayor, three aldermen, a constable, and a<br/>
town marshal, all of them Negroes. This was<br/>
necessarily so, because no white man has ever<br/>
lived in this community since it was established,<br/>
except the man who introduced the telephone<br/>
system, ahd he remained only long enough<br/>
to teach some of the townspeople how to<br/>
manage the exchange.<br/>
<br/>
The colony, of which Mound Bayou is, so<br/>
to speak, the capital, grew out of a correspondence and an interview between Maj. George<br/>
W. McGinnis, land commissioner of what was<br/>
known at that time as the Louisville, New<br/>
Orleans, and Texas Railway, and Isaiah T.<br/>
Montgomery, the man who founded the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colony</span>. The railroad, now known as the Yazoo<br/>
and Mississippi Valley, wanted to settle the<br/>
vacant lands along its right-of-way. It was<br/>
