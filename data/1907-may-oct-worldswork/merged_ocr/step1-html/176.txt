supplies, that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span>forgotten it. To<br/>
his prosperity is largely attributable the great<br/>
increase in the number of small banks. In<br/>
Scotland County, <span style="color: #0000FF;">reversing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">immemorial </span>custom,<br/>
farmers now lend money to the merchants. 1f<br/>
the prices in the fall do not suit the cotton<br/>
growers, they simply hold $ 10,000,000 worth<br/>
for better prices the following summer. A<br/>
conservative estimate would probably put the<br/>
increase in land values during the last ten<br/>
years at 250 per cent. The cases of <span style="color: #0000FF;">two<br/>

my attention, one refusing $ 2,500 for land he<br/>

years. On Route No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, I found that the<br/>
number of pieces of mail handled per <span style="color: #0000FF;">month<br/>
</span>had grown from 952 to 5,032; on Route No<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>2, from 1,372 to 3,670; and on Route No. 3,<br/>
from 1,553 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">3di31</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>total increase of from<br/>
3,878 to 12,233, or more than 200 per cent.<br/>
Another illustration is found in the fact that in<br/>
five years the circulation of the Methodist<br/>
paper published in the building in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>write has increased from 4,000 to 8,000; that<br/>
of the Baptist paper from 5,000 to 11,000; and<br/>
that of the farm paper from 5,000 to 24,000.<br/>
<br/>
For the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">too</span>, the school is beginning<br/>
to lay hold on farm life-mo longer a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mere<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>bought in 1897 for $ 350, while another has<br/>
sold a tract for $ 2,000 which then cost him<br/>
$ 750. In the first instance, the profits were<br/>
unusually large, but the second case is typical.<br/>
<br/>
Of the other factors that have helped in the<br/>
remaking of country life in Carolina, better<br/>
schools, better roads, rural mail delivery, and<br/>
the rural telephone must not be ignored.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecklenburg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>good roads are famous, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dun<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ham</span>'s will become equally so, and the $ 3oo, ooo<br/>
Guilford is now expending will leave its roads<br/>
not inferior to Durham's.<br/>
<br/>
As for the increase in quantity of mail matter<br/>
handled, I recently obtained the statistics for<br/>
three Raleigh rural delivery routes which had<br/>
then been in operation three and one-half<br/>
<br/>
parasite, but a <span style="color: #ff0000;">living</span>, vital thing rooted in the<br/>
soil. Agriculture and Nature study now have<br/>
a place in the curriculum. Under the old<br/>
system, the farmer boy learned about the wonders of Asia and Switzerland, but nothing<br/>
about the wonders of plant and animal life;<br/>
he was taught the metric system of weights and<br/>
measures, but not how to calculate a feeding<br/>
ration; foreign exchange had a place in the<br/>
school books but there was not a word about<br/>
the elements of soil fertility. Being taught<br/>
a hundred ways of <span style="color: #0000FF;">applying </span>education in<br/>
the store, but nothing of agriculture, small<br/>
wonder that hundreds of boys who might<br/>
have been farm successes became town<br/>
failures, and hundreds of others, quitting<br/>
<br/>
