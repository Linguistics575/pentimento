</span>instead of with the wings of a bird. The fish<br/>
has a swimming bladder which he can expand<br/>
and contract at will and thus rise or descend<br/>
in the dense medium in which he lives. This<br/>
swimming bladder corresponds to the gas bag<br/>
of the dirigible balloon, but the fish has the<br/>
advantage of being able at any time to draw<br/>
from an inexhaustible supply of air to distend<br/>
his bladder. Furthermore, he lives in a stable<br/>
and storm-free medium unlike our atmosphere.<br/>
There is a likeness to the fish also in the propellers which have been used on air-ships.<br/>
They have followed very closely the idea of the<br/>
tail of a fish or the screw of a steamer. They<br/>
have been pitched too high for work in the air.<br/>
On account of friction, no motor of to-day<br/>
could turn them fast enough to compare with<br/>
the beats of an insect's wings or with the whirr<br/>
of the wild duck as it flies. The propellers of<br/>
an air-ship should make at least <span style="color: #ff0000;">12,000 </span>or<br/>
14,000 revolutions a minute and be arranged<br/>
so as to lift the machine as well as propel it.<br/>
<br/>
The experimenters who have put their trust<br/>
in aeroplanes have approached the problem<br/>
more nearly after the theoretically proper<br/>
plan, since these machines are built upon the<br/>
principle used by birds in soaring. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mistake </span>probably is to hope by the aeroplane to<br/>
solve the whole problem of flight, for a bird<br/>
soars or glides on its wings only for the purpose<br/>
of resting or conserving its power after having<br/>
gained a height by hard muscular work.<br/>
<br/>
Yet one must admire the patience, the industry, and the daring of the ever-increasing<br/>
number of experimenters in this field. Many<br/>
of them impoverish themselves, and the pity of<br/>
it is that the same experimental work is done<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">anumber </span>of men-the duplication of costly<br/>
effort that comes of a lack of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation</span>.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a great gain if some institution<br/>
or some man of fortune were to construct a<br/>
great aeronautical experiment shop, well-enough<br/>
equipped to permit work in every department<br/>
of this wide field<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>There should be a laboratory, a testing plant and a large machine shop<br/>
-all for serious work. The discoveries and<br/>
tests made there should be given to the world<br/>
without the restrictive influence of patent rights.<br/>
To stimulate the inventive faculties of the<br/>
workers perhaps prizes might be given for all<br/>
inventions that help toward the construction<br/>
of a successful air-ship, a ship that shall make<br/>
its way through storms and not be dependent<br/>
upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bulky </span>gas bag with its combustible<br/>
contents.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
THE RIDICULED AND ENDURING HOUSE<br/>
OF LORDS<br/>
<br/>
HE Liberal English Government is-as<br/>
<br/>
is inevitable and usual-wrath at the<br/>
obstructive House of Lords, which is always<br/>
the stronghold of the Tories. Sir Henry<br/>
Campbell-Bannerman recently put through the<br/>
Commons this <span style="color: #0000FF;">resolution<br/>
</span>"That in order to give effect to the will of the people,<br/>
as expressed by their elect<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>d representatives, it is necessary<br/>
that the power of the ot <span style="color: #0000FF;">.er </span>house to alter or reject bills<br/>
passed by this house <span style="color: #0000FF;">shr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>be so restricted by law as to<br/>
secure that, within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">limits </span>of a single Parliament, the<br/>
final decision of the House of Commons shall prevail."<br/>
<br/>
This has no more meaning than a formal<br/>
protest; but it has again called up for discussion<br/>
the unbusiness-like qualities of the hereditary<br/>
House, many of whose members are always<br/>
absent, whose perfunctory sessions of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">halfhour </span>are often the exasperation of practical<br/>
statesmen, and whose stubborn opposition to<br/>
many liberal measures arouses the unavailing<br/>
wrath of the Radicals. It has been said by<br/>
an astute public man that if any American who<br/>
dares criticise our Senate were compelled to<br/>
study the House of Lords, he would praise<br/>
Heaven that we are no worse off than we are.<br/>
<br/>
These recurrent outbursts of unavailing <span style="color: #0000FF;">criticism </span>recall a saying of the Saturday Review a<br/>
generation ago. This abject organ declared:<br/>
<br/>
"As <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">matter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fact</span>, no man <span style="color: #0000FF;">living</span>, or who ever <span style="color: #0000FF;">lived-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>Caesar or Pericles, not Shakespeare or Michael <span style="color: #ff0000;">Angelocan </span>confer honor more than he took on <span style="color: #0000FF;">entering </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>House<br/>
of Lords."<br/>
<br/>
It was this that provoked three of Swinburne's<br/>
mocking sonnets beginning:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>O Lords our Gods, <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficent</span>, sublime,<br/>
In the evening and before the morning flames,<br/>
We praise, we bless, we magnify your names."<br/>
<br/>
and ending<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Our time, with Heaven and with itself at odds,<br/>
Makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>But yours are yet the corn and wine and oil<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>And yours our worship yet, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>Lords our Gods."<br/>
<br/>
But the Bishops and the favored brewers and<br/>
the inheritors of old titles still hold the worship<br/>
of the "crowned republic" and hold their power<br/>
and will hold it so long as the English continue<br/>
dearly to love a lord. For the House of Lords<br/>
has become, as royalty has in a much greater<br/>
measure, a stronger social than political<br/>
institution<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
