divided.among them according to custom.<br/>
For the first time in a dozen years, the other<br/>
elective officials were Democrats, who promptly<br/>
turned out their Republican subordinates,<br/>
making all the more pressure upon Governor<br/>
Hughes to take care of the many little Republican politicians who knew no other means of<br/>
livelihood than a public salary and whose<br/>
services consisted in delivering the delegates<br/>
of their towns and in attending to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">floaters<br/>
</span>and the election boards every November.<br/>
Following the ancient custom, the Speaker of<br/>
the Assembly and the President of the Senate<br/>
called on him with tentative committee lists<br/>
and asked what they could do for him in the<br/>
way of committee appointments. His acceptance of this favor would have implied<br/>
reciprocity in the appointments within his<br/>
power. Governor Hughes did not fall into this<br/>
trap. He refused to look at the committee<br/>
lists and said that he was the executive, not<br/>
the legislature; and that he would refuse<br/>
to interfere with the legislature and expected<br/>
the legislature to refrain from interfering<br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
Among Governor Hughes's first appointments were the Superintendent of Public<br/>
Works and the Superintendent of Elections.<br/>
These places had been filled by county leaders<br/>
who controlled delegates and who owned<br/>
Senators, Assemblymen, and Congressmen.<br/>
Congressman Herbert Parsons, who is chairman of the New York County Republican<br/>
Committee, and Mr. Timothy L. Woodruff,<br/>
the Republican boss of Brooklyn and chairman<br/>
of the state committee, had agreed among<br/>
themselves that Mr. Parsons should have the<br/>
choosing of the Superintendent of Public Works<br/>
and Mr. Woodruff of the Election Superintendent. Before he took the oath of office,<br/>
Governor Hughes had announced that he was<br/>
going to appoint Mr. Charles H. Keep as<br/>
Superintendent of Banks-which, in the judgment of the leaders, was all the patronage that<br/>
the Governor was entitled to. Mr. Keep knew<br/>
all about banks but it is doubtful if he could<br/>
name the counties of the state, not to say the<br/>
county bosses, and it was necessary that the<br/>
other departments should go to men who knew<br/>
how to distribute their immense patronage with<br/>
political accuracy. Since Mr. Parsons and<br/>
Mr. Woodruff were the first to favor Governor<br/>
Hughes's nomination and were the bosses of<br/>
the two most populous counties of the state,<br/>
they were naturally entitled to take first pick<br/>
<br/>
GOVERNOR HUGHES-NOW AND LATER<br/>
<br/>
of the offices. But Governor Hughes thought<br/>
that he was elected to take first pick himself,<br/>
and he did. Neither Parsons's man nor<br/>
Woodruff's man was appointed. Every office<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor</span>'s power of appointment<br/>
Governor Hughes filled with the man he<br/>
thought best.<br/>

<br/>
</span>MR. HUGHES'S INDEPENDENCE<br/>
<br/>
Before the appointments were announced,<br/>
Governor Hughes received an invitation to go<br/>
to Washington and take dinner at the White<br/>
House. He went. He arrived at the hour of<br/>
his dinner invitation and as soon as the dinner<br/>
was over he went away. The waiting reporters<br/>
had expected the dinner to be preceded or<br/>
followed by a political conference. "Not a<br/>
word of politics was spoken," Mr. Hughes<br/>
told them. What the President and the Governor talked about is nobody's business but<br/>
theirs. But the students of state politics in<br/>
New York have thought that they have seen,<br/>
not hostility, but a vigorous independence on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor</span>'s part. The Administration gave<br/>
open aid in electing <span style="color: #ff0000;">him-witpess </span>the speech<br/>
at Utica of Secretary Root. The Governor is,<br/>
no doubt, appreciative. But he does not<br/>
look at the subject in a personal way at all.<br/>
He is Governor-that's all.<br/>
<br/>
The White House dinner and some following events are among the incidents which<br/>
account for the wholly <span style="color: #ff0000;">indeendent </span>relations<br/>
now existing between the President and the<br/>
Governor. Whatever Governor Hughes is<br/>
doing, he is not building up a political organization in New York for the Roosevelt<br/>
policies. He is not building up an organization of any kind. He told the Albany<br/>
Republican organization, at a reception to<br/>
which they had invited him, that he believed<br/>
in party organizations only as methods <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>expressing and executing the public will<br/>
and not as a means of livelihood for their<br/>
members. He said that the Republican party<br/>
was many times bigger than the organization<br/>
and that when the will of the organization<br/>
supplanted the wishes of the party, the state of<br/>
New York would go Democratic, as recent<br/>
examples proved. What the Governor said<br/>
in his Albany speech he has repeated in other<br/>
public addresses until the politicians have come<br/>
to believe that he really means what he says<br/>
and that, so far as he can, he will do what he<br/>
promised.<br/>
<br/>
One of his first official acts was to recommend<br/>
<br/>
