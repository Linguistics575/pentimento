<span>(HTY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN<br/>
<br/>
fore proceeds from the people. It ordinarily<br/>
has a reasonably long term of office, or its<br/>
members are but slowly replaced year after<br/>
year. Because this is its nature, it can be disinterested, prudent, fore-looking, and wise<br/>
through experience. All city business, like<br/>
all corporation business, needs a management<br/>
which is thus continuous, and so may reasonably be expected to exercise foresight and good<br/>
judgment in discerning and meeting the needs<br/>
of the future. It is impossible to do city business well through bodies replaced every year<br/>
by an annual election; if it were ever possible,<br/>
it has ceased to be so, and the chances are that<br/>
it was never possible. The commission or small<br/>
central board charged with a part or the whole<br/>
of the city's business ought to be elected by the<br/>
people, unless the existing political conditions<br/>
make it more prudent to have it appointed by<br/>
an authority outside the city, as was the case<br/>
with the Boston commissions and partly the<br/>
case at Galveston. In the successive elections<br/>
of a member or members of such commissions,<br/>
the people have an annual opportunity of expressing their content or discontent with the<br/>
management of the commissions; but, as has<br/>
already been said, there are other available<br/>
means of procuring direct expressions of the<br/>
will of the people on explicit proposals when<br/>
such expressions are needed, namely, the two<br/>
processes called the initiative and the referendum. Two other indirect modes of bringing<br/>
the opinions and wishes of the people to bear<br/>
upon such commissions are already in active<br/>
use; one is furnished by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'daily </span>and weekly<br/>
press, the other is the method of public hearing.<br/>
The latter, because completely public, is the<br/>
more effective of the two. The annual reports<br/>
of commissions, the public press, and the hearing, together give a large amount of publicity<br/>
to the operations of such commissions, and this<br/>
publicity will secure to the people an adequate<br/>
control over their operations.<br/>
<br/>
Democracy, like autocracy, needs to keep<br/>
account of the rapidly changing conditions of<br/>
human society. What might have been undemocratic a century ago may easily be safely<br/>
democratic now. Democracy also needs to<br/>
use in its governmental business the scrap-heap<br/>
which is so important to the sound management<br/>
of industries. It should throw away the obsolete<br/>
machinery with which it finds itself encumbered<br/>
and build the new machinery which will do its<br/>
work efficiently and honestly on the vaster<br/>
scale of the present day.<br/>

</span>No improvement in the form of American<br/>
city government can remedy the existing abuses<br/>
and evils, unless the change of form be <span style="color: #0000FF;">ae<br/>
</span>companied by the selection of a different sort<br/>
of man to conduct the new government. What<br/>
then are the reasons for thinking that suitable<br/>
men could be obtained to administer municipal<br/>
affairs discreetly and honorably, if government<br/>
by commission or selectmen should be adopted <span style="color: #0000FF;">P<br/>
</span>The right men for the new sort of administration would be experienced business men who<br/>
had already been successful in their several<br/>
occupations, and who therefore had a large<br/>
stake in the moral and material welfare of the<br/>
community over which they were chosen to<br/>
preside. At present, almost all the men who<br/>
serve as aldermen and councilmen in the<br/>
American cities are of small capacity, and have<br/>
never succeeded in any business or serious<br/>
undertaking. Over and over again lists of the<br/>
aldermen and councilmen of American cities<br/>
have been published which show most of them<br/>
to have little or no property and no describable<br/>
means of support. In short, they are not<br/>
persons who have given evidence of capacity<br/>
to administer successfully any large affairs.<br/>
<br/>
SMALL BOARDS ATTRACT BETTER MEN<br/>
<br/>
In the first place, the five men who would<br/>
administer a city like Galveston would each<br/>
have a considerable amount of power and direct<br/>
responsibility, and the five united would have<br/>
all the power. Each man's term of service<br/>
would be at least <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years long; so that he<br/>
would have ample time to prove his quality<br/>
and demonstrate his usefulness to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">community</span>. Each could look ahead and make<br/>
long plans, and in all probability see them<br/>
carried out. The board, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">commission</span>, as a<br/>
whole would feel that they had a trust to<br/>
execute, and that the means of executing it<br/>
were in their hands. Wherever this method<br/>
has been applied, either to the whole or a part<br/>
of the city's work, as a matter of fact a superior<br/>
class of men has at once appeared in municipal<br/>
administration. Thus the school committee<br/>
of St. Louis was suddenly reduced to twelve<br/>
men to whom were confided large powers and<br/>
more public money than had ever been appropriated for school purposes in St. Louis. The<br/>
result was that an admirable board was<br/>
immediately chosen, and the high quality of<br/>
this board has been maintained. In Galveston, as soon as the control of the city was<br/>
placed by the new charter in the hands of five<br/>
