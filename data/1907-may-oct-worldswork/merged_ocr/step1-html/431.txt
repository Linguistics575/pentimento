<span>TAFT: A CAREER <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF<br/>
<br/>
</span>but there were lawyers on the legislature's<br/>
judiciary committee who had a criminal practice, and the chairman himself said, "Many<br/>
a time have I seen when I would <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>given all<br/>
my fee to have had twenty-four challenges for<br/>
the defendant."<br/>
<br/>
As a last resort, the helpless citizens tried to<br/>
disbar Campbell, and in this Taft represented<br/>
the Bar Association. He made a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tcrrilic </span>fight,<br/>
but Campbell was strongly entrenched and<br/>
the proceedings failed. However, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s speech<br/>
denouncing the man with the convincing effectiveness of a giant's broadaxe, so aroused the<br/>
community to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">speaker</span>'s own intense hatred<br/>
of vicious rascality that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blackleg</span>, like the<br/>
blackmailer before him, left town. His <span style="color: #ff0000;">clientble </span>scattered. Here was a signal act of useful<br/>
citizenship. Again his own words best apply to<br/>
him. At a class dinner in New Haven, just<br/>
after our war with Spain began, he said:<br/>
<br/>
"There are several kinds of patriotism. We heard in<br/>
Alumni Hall this morning of the quiet, self-denying <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriotism </span>which is working for the good of all in securing a<br/>
better civil government, and which has not the plaudits of<br/>
the crowd and the deep gratitude of the people before it<br/>
as a reward for labor and self-sacrifice. In the long run,<br/>
this kind works more for the good of the country than any<br/>
other<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>It needs not the spur of palpable danger or the<br/>
It is <span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
<br/>
</span>MR. TAFT'S MARRIAGE<br/>
<br/>
At this point in Mr. Taft's career, there were<br/>
two diversions that require mention. The first<br/>
was not of great importance; the second was<br/>
very important indeed. The one was his first<br/>
Federal job, the second was his marriage. The<br/>
Internal Revenue office for the First District of<br/>
Ohio gathered in more than $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000,000<br/>
</span>annually on whiskey and tobacco, and the<br/>
place of collector was not an undesirable one.<br/>
President Arthur had on his hands a factional<br/>
fight that involved this appointment. For the<br/>
sake of harmony, the young man in the prosecutor's office was suggested as a compromise,<br/>
he being also the son of so prominent a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Republican </span>as Judge Alphonso Taft, and the young<br/>
man helped out his party by accepting. He<br/>
went to the bottom of tax-collecting methods,<br/>
and did not stop until he knew pretty nearly<br/>
everything about the business. But then, after<br/>
ten months, he resigned to practice law with<br/>
his father's old partner, H. P. Lloyd. Collecting money was not congenial to him.<br/>
<br/>
The lady Mr. Taft married was Miss Helen<br/>
<br/>
9229<br/>
Herron. Like him, she came of a family of<br/>
lawyers. Her father was John W. Herron, ex<br/>
United States District-Attorney, and the partner<br/>
of President Hayes; and the President was<br/>
"Uncle" to her, and his wife was "Aunt Lucy."<br/>
Miss Herron had known <span style="color: #0000FF;">Will </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>from her very<br/>
earliest years and the two families were close<br/>
friends. After the boy graduated from Yale,<br/>
the engagement was announced. She also<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>college about the same time, but<br/>
taught for a while in a private school. She<br/>
believes in thorough education for women, that<br/>
the woman may with more grace and dignity<br/>
preside over the home, which, to her mind, is<br/>
"the <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftiest </span>type of usefulness." Music has<br/>
always been her absorbing passion, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cincinnati </span>was to owe her much as a devoted<br/>
patroness of the art. In 1886, he being now modestly established in life, they were married. For<br/>
their trip they chose Europe, and a few months<br/>
later returned to Cincinnati, to enter upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>home life that is beautiful in its simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF OHIO<br/>
<br/>
Taft did not practice law any great time before he was again in the public service. All<br/>
told, his private practice has not covered more<br/>
than a few months. The office now was that<br/>
of assistant <span style="color: #0000FF;">county </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">solicitor</span>, to which he had been<br/>
appointed in 1885. Two years later there came<br/>
to him another honor, and for a rising lawyer<br/>
of only twenty-nine, it was about the last<br/>
hoped for just then. As he himself says, it<br/>
fell like a bolt out of a clear sky. Judson<br/>
Harmon, later Attorney-General under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleve-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>land, resigned as judge of the Superior<br/>
Court of Ohio. Foraker, who was then<br/>
Governor, and had himself been a judge in this<br/>
court, wished Taft's father-in-law to fill<br/>
out the unexpired term, but Mr. Herron <span style="color: #0000FF;">declined</span>. Then Harmon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>friend both of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Foraker </span>and Taft, urged the Governor to<br/>
appoint young Taft. Others did the same.<br/>
Taft had been working up cases in the solicitor's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>with such industry and effectiveness that<br/>
men felt intuitively that the community needed<br/>
him for something bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Now a certain coolness had fallen between<br/>
Will Taft and the Governor at the time. There<br/>
was Taft's unrelenting activity against the<br/>
machine, for instance. And besides, Foraker<br/>
had appeared for the defense, on the criminal<br/>
side, when Tom Campbell was tried. But<br/>
Foraker was generous and impulsive, and so<br/>
the bolt out of the clear sky lifted the young<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
