<br/>
</span>HERE are several inland waterways<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>projected along the Atlantic seaboard,<br/>
<br/>
to provide safe passage for our coastwise trade. Besides the Cape Cod Canal,<br/>
there are plans for waterways connecting<br/>
Raritan Bay and Delaware River, connecting<br/>
the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>and<br/>
another extending from Winyaw Bay on the<br/>
coast of South Carolina to Jacksonville, Fla.<br/>
The most important, however, is the waterway extending from Norfolk, Va., through<br/>
the inland sounds of North Carolina southward to Beaufort Inlet.<br/>
<br/>
This is known as the Norfolk-Beaufort Inlet<br/>
Waterway, and is about 205 miles in length;<br/>
the present project is for a minimum depth of<br/>
twelve feet, the estimated cost being a little<br/>
less than $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500,000</span>. The exact route is shown<br/>
on the accompanying map. It is not expected<br/>
that this waterway will accommodate large<br/>
ocean steamships, but the depth will be ample<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">capacious </span>freight steamers and for barges<br/>
having a draft of ten feet and a capacity of<br/>
1,000 tons, which will carry bulky products at<br/>
a minimum of cost. It will insure perfect<br/>
safety for the vessels passing through, for it is<br/>
protected along its entire length by what is<br/>
known as "The Banks," the line of sand-dunes<br/>
separating the ocean from the inland sounds<br/>
of North Carolina, and it will entirely avoid<br/>
Cape Hatteras and the treacherous inner and<br/>
outer Diamond Shoals which extend nearly<br/>
fifteen miles into the ocean and constitute one<br/>
of the most dangerous points in the world.<br/>
<br/>
In 1903, commercial organizations in the<br/>
cities of Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington,<br/>
Georgetown, Charleston, Brunswick, Savannah,<br/>
and Jacksonville compiled data showing the<br/>
benefits which would accrue to these ports and<br/>
tributary sections by the construction of this<br/>
<br/>
waterway, a tabulation of which shows an<br/>
annual saving of $ 5,500,000. A special board<br/>
of United States Army Engineers estimated<br/>
that the traffic which would be affected annually amounted to 1,100,000 tons, and that the<br/>
yearly saving from its construction would<br/>
amount to $ 600,000. This was based upon a<br/>
conservative estimate of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>which would<br/>
unquestionably seek coastwise movement.<br/>
<br/>
All the ports south of Hatteras would have<br/>
a safe and cheap means of transportation to<br/>
Norfolk, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New<br/>
York. It would help relieve the congestion of<br/>
freight on the railroads and act as a regulator of<br/>
rates. It would affect the whole country east<br/>
of the Alleghenies. Incidentally, the canal will<br/>
make a great change in eastern North Carolina.<br/>
Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds are fed by<br/>
six navigable rivers-the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">euse</span>, Pamlico,<br/>
Roanoke, Chowan, Perquimans, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pasquotank</span>. From the Neuse River to the Virginia<br/>
line, there are at least eighteen large counties<br/>
containing some of the most fertile lands in the<br/>
country. No part of the section tributary to<br/>
these sounds and rivers now has an outlet to the<br/>
ocean for its water-borne trade. Beaufort Inlet<br/>
is the only one which offers an unobstructed<br/>
navigable depth, and this is inaccessible. It<br/>
is true that Pamlico Sound is connected with<br/>
Beaufort Inlet by Core Sound, but this is only<br/>
about four feet deep. There is no outlet at<br/>
all on the south, and the only passage for its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">water-borne </span>trade is northward through a canal<br/>
to the Elizabeth River and thence to Chesapeake<br/>
Bay-which canal is owned by a corporation<br/>
that charges toll. It was estimated by the Board<br/>
of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors that by<br/>
the construction of the new waterway eastern<br/>
North Carolina alone could effect an annual<br/>
saving of $ 200,000<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
