<br/>
</span>less valuable to-day than they were ten years<br/>
ago. Yet ten years ago the city could sell <span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>per cent. stock for a better price than it can<br/>
now sell 4 per cent. stock.<br/>
<br/>
The cause is not in England, nor in France,<br/>
nor in New York. It is in underlying economic<br/>
conditions. Money is scarce the world around.<br/>
Such a tremendous amount of capital is needed<br/>
to carry on great works in all lands, the mills,<br/>
the shops, the railroads, the canals, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">farmsin </span>a word <span style="color: #0000FF;">commerce </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>it is more and more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to borrow great sums of money for other<br/>
purposes. For instance, the United States alone<br/>
has sent, within the past few years, perhaps half<br/>
a billion to help develop Mexico, another quarter of a billion to build mills, railroads, and<br/>
street railways in Cuba; yet another quarter of<br/>
a billion to open up the Philippines. Great<br/>
Britain has poured probably a billion dollars<br/>
into South Africa since the war ended. England and the United States together sent more<br/>
than a quarter of a billion dollars to pay the<br/>
debts of Japan. These are but instances. They<br/>
show how the cash of the world has been drawn<br/>
into fields untilled by our fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rue</span>, the increasing gold supply has gone<br/>
far to offset the drain; but it has not met it by<br/>
probably many billions of dollars. For, at<br/>
this very time, when the old lands are pouring<br/>
out their money for the building up of the new,<br/>
the old lands themselves are demanding more<br/>
and more money-money in billions for <span style="color: #0000FF;">railroads</span>, money in billions for business. And,<br/>
between all these insistent demands, the private<br/>
investor stands supreme, the master of the<br/>
situation. If New York City will not pay<br/>
him more than four dollars interest on his hundred he will lend his money to Japan, at five<br/>
dollars, or even to a mining company, at twenty,<br/>
in promises. It is merely the old principle of<br/>
supply and demand. And, since New York<br/>
City is demanding and the public is supplying,<br/>
New York must come to the public's terms;<br/>
for that is the way of the business world. The<br/>
man with money has no favorites. Other<br/>
things being equal, he chooses the creditor<br/>
who pays him best. And this is the fact that<br/>
underlies these strange phenomena of latterday finance<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>TO MEET THE RAILROAD NEEDS<br/>
<br/>
HERE are three parties to the building<br/>
<br/>
of every railroad or to its extension or<br/>
equipment. The first is the citizen, the second<br/>
is the person who supplies the money, and the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">RAILROAD </span>NEEDS <span style="color: #ff0000;">9167<br/>
</span>third is the plan-maker and actual constructor.<br/>
The trouble that the railroads present arises<br/>
from the dislocation of these three parties.<br/>
The citizen <span style="color: #ff0000;">elamors </span>for railroads, for more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cars</span>, for more locomotives, for everything that<br/>
goes to make <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>railroad. The man with the<br/>
money refuses to advance it until the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citizen<br/>
</span>stops brandishing a legislative club. The<br/>
builder, meantime, also is afraid of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">citizen</span>,<br/>
but he makes most of his prayers to the man<br/>
with the money.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is the gist of the condition that has<br/>
been and will be the theme of so many public<br/>
addresses, letters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">essays</span>, warnings and pleas.<br/>
It is very far removed from the ideal condition.<br/>
Properly the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citizen </span>should come to the builder<br/>
and ask for facilities, not <span style="color: #ff0000;">eringingly </span>nor yet<br/>
as a bully, but as one business man <span style="color: #ff0000;">makinga<br/>
</span>contract with another business man. If the<br/>
builder <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">satislicd</span>, he should be able to call<br/>
upon Capital quickly, obtain funds, and then<br/>
go ahead and build the road, or buy the new<br/>
equipment, or do the double-tracking requisite.<br/>
<br/>
But because of this dislocation Wall Street<br/>
is <span style="color: #ff0000;">despontlent</span>, the State legislators are bitter,<br/>
for some of the people are savage, and the railroad magnates are not fit company for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Godfearing </span>men. What can be done? When<br/>
a disagreement of this kind occurs in a firm, or<br/>
in a single corporation, provided the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firm </span>or<br/>
the corporation is sound, it is generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">easy </span>to<br/>
reach an adjustment. Why cannot an adjustment be reached in this greater matter?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the real difficulty is that "the<br/>
Citizen" means eighty millions of people, "the<br/>
investor" means also a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>number, and<br/>
there are perhaps not more than twenty<br/>
great railroad builders. The citizen in his<br/>
present mood declares that the builder is a<br/>
robber and a thief. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">builder </span>retorts that<br/>
the citizen does not know what he wants.<br/>
Meantime the man with the money decides to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spend </span>it in South America, or Canada, or even<br/>
in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there is a way of adjustment.<br/>
begin with, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rainoad </span>builder must come out<br/>
in the open and let himself be seen He must<br/>
wash his hands of the disreputable <span style="color: #0000FF;">stains </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left<br/>
</span>by his dabbling in high <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance</span>, He must<br/>
move his residence from Wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stem</span>. What<br/>
would one <span style="color: #ff0000;">say </span>of a reformed <span style="color: #0000FF;">pirate </span>who still<br/>
maintained <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>ship upon the seas<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>though he<br/>
should now call it a yacht? In <span style="color: #0000FF;">line</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">railroad </span>president or chairman who is to help<br/>
rather than to hinder the restoration of <span style="color: #ff0000;">public<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">To<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
