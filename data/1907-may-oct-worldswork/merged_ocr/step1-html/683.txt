<br/>
</span>second Mor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little, white, unpretentious<br/>
office-building halfway between the graveyard<br/>
that bounds Wall Street on the west and the<br/>
deep dark river that skirts it on the east. There<br/>
sits Mr. James Stillman, the president of the<br/>
National City Bank, of New York. The office<br/>
is severely plain. In that, it echoes the New<br/>
England spirit of its master. Here are no<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand-dollar </span>rugs, nor tapestries, nor pictures. Yet all this ostentatious poverty is an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affectation</span>, no more, for the bank is the richest<br/>
bank and its directors are among the richest<br/>
men in the whole United States.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Stillman is a remarkable individual.<br/>
He is a man of middle stature, well-built, alert,<br/>
alive. Restless energy marks every move.<br/>
His clear, light-brown eyes look at and through<br/>
you as he talks. The look and the voice are<br/>
cold, icy-cold. Men say that deep down below<br/>
the ice there flows a river of sentiment, love of<br/>
children, appreciation of things beautiful, art,<br/>
music, the sea. It may be so, but one may<br/>
well find it hard to believe. Mr. James<br/>
Stillman of 52 Wall Street is a cold, hard, loveless individual, however genial and delightful<br/>
may be Mr. James Stillman of the brown-stone<br/>
house in the Seventies.<br/>
<br/>
He is the National City Bank, its brains, its<br/>
wonderful intuition, its very soul. He has<br/>
aspired to be the Rothschild of America, and<br/>
to found his bank in the old Custom-House, the<br/>
great stone-pillared pile into whose shadows his<br/>
eyes look as he glances from his windows across<br/>
the street, and make that the Bank of All the<br/>
Banks. Perhaps he will do it. For he is<br/>
young, and Morgan, Baker, Schiff-oh, well,<br/>
a man must drop the arms of power sometime!<br/>
<br/>
THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF STILLMAN<br/>
<br/>
James Stillman was born on June 9, 1850,<br/>
in Brownsville, Tex., just across the river from<br/>
Matamoras, Mexico. It was a wild and most<br/>
unlikely land. Away back in the early'30's<br/>
his father went down from New England to<br/>
Matamoras, seeking a fortune from the traffic<br/>
over the border in cotton, hides, and wool.<br/>
Then came the war with Mexico, and Brownsville sprung up amid the Chaparral. The<br/>
trader went back to New England, married<br/>
the choice of his youth, and brought her down<br/>
to live in the new town along the river.<br/>
There, in a little Mexican-built cottage within<br/>
sound of the river in <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood</span>, James Stillman<br/>
was born.<br/>
<br/>
On the wings of the Civil War came Fortune.<br/>
<br/>
The boy, well grown, was sent to Hartford,<br/>
Conn., to school. He has not since seen<br/>
Brownsville to this day. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">family'moved<br/>
</span>North, having strong Union sentiments, leaving<br/>
the Southern end of the business in the hands<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>rampant Southerner, Mr. Carson. Mr.<br/>
Stillman piled up a fortune, gigantic for those<br/>
days. By a stroke of rare judgment, he ignored the Union blockade. The Matamoras<br/>
gateway stood wide open. Mr. Stillman, in<br/>
the North, and Mr. Carson, in the South,<br/>
opened a new trade route through Bagdad, a<br/>
Mexican port. The cotton blocked the roads<br/>
for miles behind the open door. Merchandise<br/>
from New York, consigned to Bagdad, slipped<br/>
into the South in a huge and steady flood.<br/>
So was laid the foundation of the Stillman<br/>
fortune of to-day.<br/>
<br/>
A few years later, young Stillman turned to<br/>
the inheritance of his tradition, the cotton<br/>
business. Within a few years his frm was<br/>
doing the biggest cotton business in this country,<br/>
selling direct to the mills. For more than<br/>
twenty years he was the master of this trade.<br/>
<br/>
Strange it is that the very stars in their<br/>
courses seem to fight for such a man as he. It<br/>
chanced that the older Stillman, not with any<br/>
great pride but more by chance, retained the<br/>
title to nearly all the land around about Brownsville. Six years ago, you or I might have gone<br/>
down and bought it for a few dollars an acre.<br/>
Then, again by chance, a group of St. Louis<br/>
capitalists went down and dug for water<br/>
in the Brownsville country, found it, then built<br/>
a railroad. To-day, that Brownsville land is<br/>
worth in the hands of Mr. James Stillman all<br/>
the way from $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>to $ 500 per acre.<br/>
<br/>
Meantime, Mr. Stillman has made himself<br/>
the centre of the banking world. Years ago<br/>
he became the youngest director of the National<br/>
City Bank, a quiet, respectable institution.<br/>
He was elected because his father happened to<br/>
be a friend of Mr. Moses Taylor, who was, at<br/>
that time, the dominant influence in the bank.<br/>
Some fifteen years or so ago, a new president<br/>
was wanted. It was a man's hour on Wall<br/>
Street. The world was ripe for a fall. The<br/>
Baring panic, the crisis of 1893, the free-silver<br/>
collapse, lay just beyond the hill where man's<br/>
eyes could not see them. By chance, Mr.<br/>
Stillman took the presidency. The storm<br/>
broke. He showed himself the master mariner,<br/>
quiet, skilful, courageous, cold as an iceberg<br/>
in panic, intuitive as a woman in the hour of<br/>
action. And so he came to his inheritance.<br/>
