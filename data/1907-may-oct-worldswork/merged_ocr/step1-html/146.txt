</span>example, rice is a crop of rapidly rising importance. Formerly it was grown mainly in<br/>
the lowlands of the Carolinas. In Texas<br/>
and in Louisiana, settlers from the older farming states are now raising rice by irrigation<br/>
on higher ground, where they use planting<br/>
machinery and imported Japanese seed suited<br/>
to the new conditions. Now the quantity<br/>
produced and the low cost at which it can be<br/>
sold has brought against the Carolina rice<br/>
growers a competition which they are unable<br/>
to meet, and the Department of Agriculture<br/>
is now experimenting on behalf of Carolina<br/>

land in the South. Reclamation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">everglades </span>of Florida is an important project which<br/>
is already being looked into by the state in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation </span>with the United States Department<br/>
of Agriculture. If, as seems probable, it can<br/>
be carried through, the result will be to add to<br/>
the state 18,000,000 acres of very fertile land<br/>
-equal to one-half of the entire state. Portions<br/>
of the everglades already drained have produced phenomenal crops-in one case, for<br/>
example, 40 tons of sugar cane to the acre.<br/>

What the South needs most, however, is not<br/>
new discoveries in agricultural science, but the<br/>
application of what is already known. Man,<br/>
not Nature, has been at fault. But a change<br/>
is at hand. Powerful forces are at work.<br/>
The Southern States have prescribed the<br/>
introduction of agricultural common-school<br/>
instruction, and rapid progress is being made<br/>
in method.<br/>
<br/>
There are about <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>million acres of swamp<br/>
<br/>
land <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the drainage which resulted from<br/>
digging the Herring canal, and reclamation of<br/>
this type of land can be expected to take place<br/>
steadily through private enterprise. In the<br/>
case of the large swamp bottoms, particularly<br/>
in the Mississippi Valley, the engineering<br/>
works and problems involved create a field<br/>
for public action. Such reclamation work<br/>
also profits the general welfare from the standpoint of sanitation, and aids largely in the<br/>
extermination of the mosquito by destroying<br/>
the favorite breeding places.<br/>
