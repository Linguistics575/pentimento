<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">WHAT<br/>
<br/>
</span>education is our national fetish and yet, by<br/>
government confession, the country schools<br/>
are inadequate. The teachers are untrained,<br/>
working only until they can get money enough<br/>
to do something else; having between <span style="color: #ff0000;">twentyfive </span>and thirty <span style="color: #0000FF;">recitations </span>a day, they cannot prevent their pupils wasting half their<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
With Scandinavia it is not so. In Sweden,<br/>
at least, every rural teacher has a normal<br/>
education behind her. Moreover, there are<br/>
"the People's Highs." These latter are not<br/>
rural copies of the city high schools, but informal institutions where farmers and their<br/>
wives, or farm hands of both sexes up to the<br/>
age of twenty-five, can get teaching directly<br/>
calculated to make them more efficient in their<br/>
work, as well as to awaken patriotism, stimulate<br/>
mental activity, and warm the heart. There<br/>
are no entrance requirements or examinations.<br/>
All instruction is by lectures and "quizzes."<br/>
The object is simply to teach the peasantry to<br/>
make the best-financially and socially-of<br/>
country life. The farmer's diet being commonly <span style="color: #0000FF;">unwholesome</span>, rational country cooking<br/>
is taught to the farmer's wife. She is encouraged to go into poultry farming and market<br/>
gardening, and to use the wild berries that grow<br/>
so plentifully all about her. The farmer <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span>learns chemistry, horticulture, dairy<br/>
bookkeeping, cattle breeding, fishing, and<br/>
surveying-along with Danish history, politics,<br/>
singing, gymnastics, and sloyd. All this, with<br/>
board, for $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2.50 </span>a week!<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about the People's Highs<br/>
(which from Denmark have spread to Norway<br/>
and Sweden) is that they serve as rural settlement houses or neighborhood centres. Alumni<br/>
associations are formed among the finished<br/>
pupils. Concerts, dances, and festivals are<br/>
given in the schoolhouse, relieving the fatal<br/>
tedium of farm life. University students go<br/>
out to lecture in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">folkskule </span>after our own<br/>
university-extension plan. Benevolent city<br/>
people send lawyers to sit at stated intervals in<br/>
the schoolhouses to give free legal advice to<br/>
the farmers.<br/>
<br/>
And now the farmers are paying back. In<br/>
Denmark they are forming cooperative <span style="color: #ff0000;">cattlebreeding </span>societies, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperative </span>dairies, bakeries,<br/>
factories, and mills. They are founding their<br/>
own country banks. <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">armers</span>' unions arrange<br/>
for the collection, sale, and export of produce.<br/>
In short, they are showing some of that capacity<br/>
<br/>
8891<br/>
<br/>
for concerted action which has always made<br/>
the city the better place to live in. The whole<br/>
countryside is waking. Tenement dwellers<br/>
have heard the news and are taking to the fields.<br/>
For the first time, there is a powerful attraction<br/>
toward the country.<br/>
<br/>
CHEAP TELEPHONE RATES<br/>
<br/>
Space dwindles; and yet I have said nothing<br/>
of the telephone system of Stockholm, the<br/>
finest in the world. You pay <span style="color: #ff0000;">21- </span>cents for a<br/>
call at a pay station, $ 13.50 a year for city<br/>
service, 4 cents on the long distance telephone<br/>
for a distance of sixty miles, 46 cents for a<br/>
thousand miles, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">53 </span>cents for the greatest<br/>
limit of distance conceivable to the Scandinavian<br/>
mind. In Stockholm everybody has a telephone, the littlest shops and all but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">humblest </span>homes. In 1904, New York-with a<br/>
population six times as great as the Swedish<br/>
capital-fell 2,000 behind Stockholm in the<br/>
number of telephones. And the service is<br/>
good. So much for a state telephone service<br/>
in competition with private companies.<br/>
<br/>
I have said nothing of the stringent building<br/>
laws of Stockholm, which practically prohibit<br/>
fires. Cellars of stone arches, stone or iron<br/>
staircases, attics floored with fireproof masonry<br/>
and roofs of tile, metal, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">slate-thee </span>things,<br/>
in conjunction with a limited height for firstclass buildings and a prescribed size for chimney flues, make fires so rare in Stockholm that<br/>
it hardly pays to keep up a fire department.<br/>
The chimney sweep and the flue inspector<br/>
ought by rights to be considered the most important members of the fire brigade. Once a<br/>
year every flue, stove, and chimney in the<br/>
capital is examined, and many times a year<br/>
every chimney must be swept out. The result is an insurance rate moderate <span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span>belief. For something like $ 1.25, you<br/>
may insure $ 2,500 worth of furniture for a<br/>
year. And for $ 17.50 on the thousand, you<br/>
can insure your house and all others <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>built<br/>
on that site forever.<br/>
<br/>
And still there remains the famous Gothenburg system by which the Swedish Government<br/>
controls the sale of alcohol, limiting the hours<br/>
of sale, and seeing to it that no private <span style="color: #0000FF;">individual </span>shall make more than just a paying <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit<br/>
</span>out of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>. The rest reverts to the State.<br/>
The demon saloonkeeper is not in Sweden;<br/>
the motive for his enticements is taken from<br/>
him.<br/>
