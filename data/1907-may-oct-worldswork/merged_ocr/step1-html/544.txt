<span>THE PERIL OF JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
ITS CRITICAL CONDITION CAUSED BY INCREASED TAXES AND WAR-DEBTS<br/>
<br/>
JAPAN stands to-day at the parting of the<br/>
ways. Neither its statesmen nor the<br/>
students of <span style="color: #0000FF;">economy </span>who study it<br/>
<br/>
from foreign lands can clearly tell its future.<br/>
Briefly, Japan of to-day dates from April, 1868,<br/>
the year after the beginning of the reign of<br/>
the present Mikado. In that month was promulgated the "Imperial Oath of Five Articles,"<br/>
which is the basis of Japanese civilization. The<br/>
substance of these articles may be outlined:<br/>
<br/>
(1) Public opinion shall decide all measures<br/>
of government, through the deliberative<br/>
assemblies.<br/>
<br/>
(2) All classes shall unite to carry out the<br/>
Government plans.<br/>
<br/>
(3) All the people shall be allowed to fulfil<br/>
their proper desires, so that all shall be happy.<br/>
<br/>
(4) Uncivilized customs shall be broken<br/>
through, and everything shall be based on the<br/>
law of nature.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>) Knowledge shall be drawn from all the<br/>
world, that the Empire may be built up.<br/>
<br/>
It was in the next year that the great change<br/>
was made. Hitherto, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Feudalism </span>had been the<br/>
law. The Daimios, or leaders, had held power<br/>
over their people, even to life and death. They<br/>
had also held the lands. They gave up the<br/>
lands to the crown, and surrendered all their<br/>
power over the people, and also their responsibility for the lives and persons of the people.<br/>
The nobles received, in return, one-tenth of<br/>
the revenue formerly accruing from their lands;<br/>
and the soldier retainers received pensions,<br/>
afterwards funded into national bonds.<br/>
<br/>
It was that change that made modern Japan.<br/>
Within little more than half a man's lifetime,<br/>
practically the last trace of Feudalism has gone.<br/>
To-day, justice, legislation, administration, and<br/>
political power centre at one capital. It has<br/>
been forty years of centralization and organization. If one take the latter-day evidences<br/>
of Japanese life, and study them in close connection with the Five Articles, it becomes<br/>
evident at once that those articles have been<br/>
no dead-letter. They have been the vitalizing<br/>
principle of the Government at every one of<br/>
the difficult and dangerous steps that have<br/>
<br/>
been taken to bring the nation to its present<br/>
position.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Feudal system that made Japan<br/>
light-hearted, gay, and happy. The dependents of the great nobles lived in the day that<br/>
sped, worrying not at all over the prospects<br/>
of to-morrow: for was not the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Daimio </span>great,<br/>
and rich, and generous? Food, when the<br/>
harvests failed, came to them from his largess.<br/>
His power protected them in their rights, gave<br/>
them the law, left them free to amuse <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span>, to labor happily abroad in his fields,<br/>
or to follow joyously the gentle arts of manufacture that they loved. So it was that their<br/>
children were always happy, and laughter<br/>
lay upon the land like sunshine.<br/>
<br/>
At first the change was barely felt by the<br/>
people at large. Solid pensions were granted<br/>
to the old retainers. Between 1872 and 1878,<br/>
the Government issued more than $ 90,000,000<br/>
of bonds to fund these pensions, and the bonds<br/>
paid from 5% to 10% interest. The pension<br/>
granted to the old Samurai, or retainer, was<br/>
quite sufficient to keep him in comfort, and to<br/>
keep his children happy. But the pension<br/>
did not increase as his descendants increased.<br/>
To-day, the Samurai of 1870 and his little<br/>
family are represented by dozens of people,<br/>
their children and their children's children.<br/>
The principal of the pension has been scattered,<br/>
so that no single one of the family has enough<br/>
to live upon.<br/>
<br/>
And it has all been fearfully sudden. France<br/>
and England faced the same problem six<br/>
hundred years ago, and solved it; but in each<br/>
case it took two hundred years in the solution<br/>
and, even so, entailed upon the people much<br/>
suffering and left a heritage of poverty and<br/>
misery. Japan does nothing slowly. In education, for instance, it was not content to<br/>
take a generation for transition. The Samurai<br/>
youths, whose education in former days was<br/>
about equally divided between the gentle arts<br/>
of fencing, swimming, jiu-jitsu, archery, and<br/>
reading, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>plunged into a full-fledged Western school. We are told by a great Japanese<br/>
educator that such authors as Mill, Spencer<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
