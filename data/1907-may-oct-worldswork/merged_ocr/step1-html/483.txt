<span>WORLD-WIDE PROBLEMS OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">RACE<br/>
<br/>
</span>peaceful cooperation of all other nations, we<br/>
should make short work of war. Great<br/>
captains with their noise and guns would go out<br/>
of fashion in a jiffy; the barriers of high tariffs<br/>
would disappear; we should manage the world<br/>
with much less tomfoolery of kings and parliaments; and peace conferences would be<br/>
unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
This gives a suggestion of constructive <span style="color: #0000FF;">statesmanship-the </span>making of trade and communication and association easy, the working out of<br/>
government and of industry so as to make it<br/>
cooperative in a world-wide way, the bringing<br/>
of men and of nations to look upon themselves,<br/>
not as parts of a parish nor of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">province </span>nor of<br/>
one country only, but as parts of the world.<br/>
To be sure, we are gradually going in that<br/>
direction, but the progress is rather slow.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth while to remark that this universal<br/>
Martian unity and peace rest on a mechanical<br/>
necessity. So, too, it is worth recalling, the<br/>
most rapid strides that we have made toward<br/>
world-unity have been taken because of<br/>
mechanical inventions-the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-engine</span>, the<br/>
telegraph, and the like. And mechanical helps<br/>
will doubtless continue to be the best helps in<br/>
the progress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization</span>. Railroads are<br/>
mechanical, and flying-machines, and the<br/>
Panama Canal, and most of the means whereby<br/>
we have increased the production of useful<br/>
things. Mechanical, in a sense, are the<br/>
methods of conquering the tropics so that white<br/>
men may live and work there. When we<br/>
perfect the machinery of communication, of<br/>
transportation, and of production (of which our<br/>
present machinery is probably the crude <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>forms of an experimental period), then the<br/>
Socialists and Utopians will come to their own<br/>
and we may learn the lesson of the dwellers on<br/>
Mars.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, it may be that the whole canal system<br/>
of that planet-their water supply, from pole<br/>
to pole-is owned <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>trust, and the inhabitants<br/>
form one great peaceful community because<br/>
they are in industrial serfdom!<br/>
<br/>
WORLD-WIDE PROBLEMS OF RACE<br/>
<br/>
GREAT volume of instructive literature<br/>
<br/>
has been suggested by the British<br/>
Colonial <span style="color: #0000FF;">Conferences-books </span>about imperial<br/>
political organization, about commerce, and<br/>
about all the kinds of world-wide tasks that<br/>
engage the attention of the strongest organization of the most powerful race of men that ever<br/>
lived; for the British Empire, whatever its<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9281<br/>
<br/>
</span>future, is so far the biggest political fact in<br/>
human history.<br/>
<br/>
Any man who follows this literature, both in<br/>
English periodicals and in books, <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>the key<br/>
to the dominant thought and feeling everywhere in-race-unity. This is almost as true<br/>
now as it was centuries ago when <span style="color: #0000FF;">race-difference </span>was of itself a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficent </span>cause of enmity<br/>
and often of war. Toleration of other races<br/>
has grown with every century-grown in some<br/>
aspects; but the radical race-difference always<br/>
asserts itself. In India, in Africa, in China,<br/>
in the West Indies, wherever there is an Englishman, he regards other races as radically different and as inferior to his own, and he at<br/>
least tacitly denies their ability ever to rise to<br/>
his level.<br/>
<br/>
The application of this fact to political and<br/>
military organization, to trade, and to all the<br/>
other practical problems of civilization-that is<br/>
the British Empire; and every discussion of<br/>
large policies comes back to this central fact.<br/>
<br/>
While, therefore, the Peace Conference is<br/>
dealing, in its restricted and almost necessarily<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">non-committal </span>way, chiefly with the courtesies<br/>
and the etiquette of quarrels between "<span style="color: #ff0000;">dvilized</span>" Powers, the gravest dangers to peace<br/>
in the future, as they were in the recent past,<br/>
are the dangers of race-conflict. Witness the<br/>
Boer War in South Africa and especially the<br/>
Japanese-Russian War. Witness the danger<br/>
that will arise at some time at Constantinople.<br/>
Witness the unrest in India. Witness the<br/>
little irritations of the Japanese in California.<br/>
Witness our long unsuccessful dealings with<br/>
the Indians. Witness the troubles these forty<br/>
years in our Southern States-for that matter,<br/>
our troubles since African slavery was introduced into the United States.<br/>
<br/>
There is a deep hostility, too, in some other<br/>
races to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">English-to </span>all white men. It has<br/>
been only <span style="color: #ff0000;">fiuy </span>years since the Indian mutiny,<br/>
and there is a persistent unrest to-day in India.<br/>
The Japanese are so jealous of their race pride<br/>
that they easily take offense. The Chinese<br/>
have no love for "foreign devils," and very<br/>
little reason to have.<br/>
<br/>
The great field for humanitarianism in the<br/>
future-for that matter, the one great direction<br/>
of true civilization-is not the field of mere<br/>
religious propaganda, but the adjustment of<br/>
race-differences. The task is to find honorable and peaceful ways of lessening the dislike<br/>
that most races of men have for other races-to find ways of living and working together in<br/>
<br/>
