THE OLD AND THE NEW ON THE TOLUCA ROAD<br/>
<br/>
comes from the United States. But the<br/>
building itself has all the charm of tradition.<br/>
As befits a people whose mother country is<br/>
Spain, the architecture is Arabic Gothic, and<br/>
an especially pure and graceful example. A<br/>
year ago the pioneer skyscraper and only<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>office building was erected in the<br/>
capital. It towers with stately effect in the<br/>
group plan. The National Theatre, at present<br/>
a skeleton chaos of steel, will be another; and<br/>
then there will be the Pantheon for the repose<br/>
of the illustrious dead, besides ten or twelve<br/>
more buildings of which the legislative palace,<br/>
surpassing anything of the kind in the south,<br/>
will form the centre. Even each suburb<br/>
is to have its share in this beautifying<br/>
scheme. An astronomical observatory already rises among the gardens of Tacubaya.<br/>
Santa Maria has a Geological Institute, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>Popotla will soon be the location of a meteorological observatory.<br/>
<br/>
Attractive homes, however, guarantee a<br/>
city's beauty more than public buildings.<br/>
The broad avenues of Mexico City are lined<br/>
with them now. The American has appeared<br/>
here with his pet institution, the real estate<br/>
boom. He has plotted out swampy wastes<br/>
into <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonies</span>, paved the streets with asphalt,<br/>
and planted trees. You turn a corner, and<br/>
you leave gaudy stucco fronts and barred<br/>
windows behind, and are at once in a wealthy<br/>
neighborhood of modern American residences.<br/>
Only the peaked sombreros dodging luxurious<br/>
motor cars remind you that you are not in<br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago, for perhaps a solid mile of<br/>
street, there would be no echo of the carpenter's<br/>
hammer: to-day nearly every block is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">din<br/>
