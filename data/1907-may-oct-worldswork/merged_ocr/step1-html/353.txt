<span>THE PEOPLE, THE RAILROADS, AND THE GOVERNMENT 9151<br/>
<br/>
seem powerless to prevent the disturbances<br/>
of the interstate rates.<br/>
<br/>
Such cases, which can be multiplied <span style="color: #0000FF;">indefinitely</span>, point to a conclusion that the Federal<br/>
regulation over rates should be widely extended.<br/>
I am far from being an enemy of the rights<br/>
of any state in the Union, but I do not understand that these rights give a state the right<br/>
to regulate rates nor to make regulations to<br/>
govern the movement of traffic between states.<br/>
Such an application of the Federal power over<br/>
corporations authorized to engage in handling<br/>
interstate traffic, either by Federal authority or<br/>
by direct supervision, should not take away any<br/>
of the power of the states over purely intrastate traffic. If the Interstate Commerce<br/>
Commissioners should establish a standard of<br/>
rates over the entire country, after using all<br/>
the information at their command and the<br/>
machinery of the Government to adjust and<br/>
establish a scale of rates that are fair and <span style="color: #0000FF;">equitable</span>, it-is not right that the power of the<br/>
various states, by their separate acts, can<br/>
break down the entire fabric of rates so fixed<br/>
by power granted by Congress. There is, however, no doubt that the state can regulate the<br/>
traffic of railroad, telephone, telegraph, water,<br/>
gas, or other like companies which are exclusively state institutions.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, a railroad from Chicago to<br/>
East St. Louis which does not engage in handling interstate <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>is subject to the jurisdiction<br/>
of the state of Illinois, alone. When, however,<br/>
it engages in interstate traffic by interchanging<br/>
with other roads extending beyond the state<br/>
of Illinois it thereby becomes interstate, and its<br/>
situation under the law is entirely changed.<br/>
It has become subject to the whole body of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Federal </span>law relating to interstate common<br/>
carriers, and has removed itself from all state<br/>
laws governing the same subject. Thereafter,<br/>
the state of Illinois may not, under the guise of<br/>
a local law, reduce its interstate rates, but such<br/>
power resides only in the Federal Government.<br/>
<br/>
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMISSION<br/>
<br/>
The scope of the Interstate Commerce Commission should be sufficiently broad, and, at a<br/>
time not far distant, full enforcement of the<br/>
law should be had. It will in time become<br/>
a necessity that the proper fulfilment of the<br/>
functions of the Government, in dealing with<br/>
this most important question affecting, as it<br/>
does, every industry, man, woman, and child<br/>
<br/>
in the land, will require the creation of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">new<br/>
</span>Cabinet officer, whose department will be<br/>
charged with responsibility in matters pertaining to railroads and navigation; who,<br/>
through his position in the Cabinet, will enable<br/>
the Cabinet members to keep in touch with all<br/>
matters involving the movement of the commerce of the nation, both domestic and foreign.<br/>
<br/>
As the laws multiply, the labor of enforcing<br/>
them, of judging affairs under them, of making<br/>
rulings and investigating charges, must also<br/>
multiply. The Commission, too, must continue<br/>
to grow strong, or the whole system of administration will be ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that I have touched upon most of<br/>
the vital points that are at issue. In dealing with<br/>
them, I have but one policy. That is, that the<br/>
people and the railroads shall get together and<br/>
confer upon the matters that arise between<br/>
them, and that the Government shall be the<br/>
instrument to enforce the agreement that the<br/>
railroad and the people shall make between<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that railroads should<br/>
enter into politics, and I look <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidently </span>for<br/>
the time when railroads will not be forced to<br/>
go to a state or Federal capital to save <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>from dangerous legislation. That time<br/>
will come when the people and the railroads<br/>
bring to the settlement of their differences<br/>
the same common sense that they bring to the<br/>
settlement of their private disagreements.<br/>
<br/>
EMPLOYEES AND INVESTORS ASSOCIATED<br/>
<br/>
The one and one-half million employees<br/>
of the railroads and the stockholders are closely<br/>
associated and their interests are identical.<br/>
You cannot injure one without affecting the<br/>
other. There is a total stock issue on railroads<br/>
of about $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">6,6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">50,000,000</span>, of which amount about<br/>
$ 4,150, ooo, ooo is dividend-paying stock, and<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">500,000,000 </span>is non-dividend-paying stock.<br/>
The stockholders receive annually about<br/>
$ 240,000,000 as dividends, which is 5.78 per<br/>
cent. on the total dividend-paying stock, and<br/>
but 3.6 per cent. on the total stock issue of the<br/>
railroads; while the employees receive annually,<br/>
in monthly installments, $ 840,000,000, which is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">equal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dividend <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12.6 </span>per cent. on the total<br/>
railroad stock capitalization of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">6,650</span>, ooo, ooo.<br/>
<br/>
An employee earning $ 900 on a railroad is<br/>
receiving an income equal to 5 per cent. on<br/>
$ 18,000, and has a stake in the property equal<br/>
to an investment of that amount in 5 per cent.<br/>
securities. An employee who earns $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,500 </span>per<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
