immigrant. These will, within the next fifty<br/>
years, completely transform this region. As<br/>
it stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day</span>, it has demonstrated enormous<br/>
possible riches. It may almost be said that<br/>
every man, particularly every white man, in<br/>
this whole region who has any qualities of<br/>
industrial leadership is building a fortune,<br/>
large or small, in proportion to his abilities and<br/>
in proportion to the transportation facilities<br/>
that he enjoys-and many of them are already<br/>
becoming men of very considerable fortunes.<br/>
On the Arkansas River there <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>cotton planters<br/>
who live in palatial homes, and so of course<br/>
there are all the way down the Mississippi<br/>
Valley. When this region has the number of<br/>
railroads that its products will maintain, and<br/>
as dense a population even as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufacturing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ions </span>of the upland South, not to speak<br/>
of the corn belt of the North Central States,<br/>
it will become a very rich region. The man<br/>
who digs ditches and the man who builds<br/>
railroads in this part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">United </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">States </span>are<br/>
the men who <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the architects of a great agricultural prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
A very large part of the timber resources of<br/>
these states has been bought by great lumber<br/>
companies, some for immediate working and<br/>
others to hold for the future.'But there could<br/>
hardly be a safer investment, nor could there<br/>
well be a better, than the purchase of<br/>
good farming lands, anywhere in this area.<br/>
Indeed, if there were some method whereby<br/>
a hundred thousand farmers could be directed<br/>
to these lands, as the opening up of new territory has frequently attracted them to such <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>region as Oklahoma, and if this hundred<br/>
thousand farmers had money enough to<br/>
drain their land and to clear it and no<br/>
more, and if they would devote the same<br/>
skill and the same business methods to the<br/>
growth of cotton that is given to the culture of<br/>
wheat and corn in the North and Northwest,<br/>
they would be, within the decade, the most<br/>
prosperous farmers in America. Of course,<br/>
this prediction is made upon the assumption<br/>
either that they carried enough labor with<br/>
them to gather the crop or that a machine<br/>
should be invented to do this with less labor.<br/>
<br/>
THE PASSING OF PRESENT PROBLEMS<br/>
<br/>
When one takes a comprehensive view,<br/>
therefore, of this region, remembering that no<br/>
part of it will be unhealthful after it is drained<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-remembering</span>, too, that white men can then<br/>
live in this climate as long and work as hard as<br/>
<br/>
A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
in southern Europe-it is a short-sighted view<br/>
which concerns itself overmuch with any<br/>
present educational or social or political or<br/>
hygienic problems that exist there. The one<br/>
thing needed and the one thing that is now<br/>
quickly inevitable is the opening of the country<br/>
to settlement. For the first time, these large<br/>
facts are now becoming known and economic<br/>
forces will soon open this land to settlement.<br/>
<br/>
When the industrial history of the whole<br/>
United States comes to be written, it will be a<br/>
cause of wonder that lines of railroad were<br/>
built across deserts to mining camps long before<br/>
they were built through the richest agricultural<br/>
section of the continent. This, again, is a<br/>
result of old ignorance, both of the people<br/>
and of the land-the ignorance of people both<br/>
there and elsewhere. Every million that is<br/>
spent in planting and opening this region will<br/>
yield prodigious dividends in immigration, in<br/>
agriculture, in schools, in home building, in<br/>
the building of cities, in the awakening of<br/>
thought, as well as in the increased production<br/>
of cotton.<br/>
<br/>
Iowa has a mile of railroad for every six<br/>
square miles of territory, and Kansas for every<br/>
nine square-miles. But Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas have yet only one mile of<br/>
railroad for every fourteen square miles of<br/>
richer <span style="color: #0000FF;">land-a </span>vast difference in facilities.<br/>
<br/>
JACKSON, MISS.<br/>
<br/>
A good example of the awakening of this<br/>
part of the South is the recent history of Jackson, Miss.<br/>
<br/>
It was a straggling, ill-kept capital village<br/>
a dozen years ago, and its chief claim to existence, not to say distinction, was that the<br/>
old state-house stood there. There is now a<br/>
<br/>
. new and very beautiful capitol and there is a<br/>
<br/>
new town, the growth of which in prosperity<br/>
and beauty is nothing short of astonishing.<br/>
There was an unattractive, muddy road which<br/>
led from the station to the state-house ten years<br/>
ago. It is now a beautifully paved street,<br/>
with compact business houses, and residences<br/>
which show both prosperity and good taste.<br/>
<br/>
The city has become a manufacturing place;<br/>
it has almost suddenly grown, from a mere<br/>
village, to have more than 31,000 inhabitants.<br/>
The enterprise of the business men is shown by<br/>
this fact-that it was they who made the first<br/>
movement to secure for the South a fair share<br/>
of the Government supplies needed in<br/>
Panama; and a business man of Jackson<br/>
