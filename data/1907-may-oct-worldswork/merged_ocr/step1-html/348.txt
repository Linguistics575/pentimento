Of the other revolutionary movements, four<br/>
were the birth-throes of South American<br/>
republics, and were directed against Spain,<br/>
Greece, Belgium, and Italy. Two others were<br/>
brought about by personal ambitions-the<br/>
revolt of Mohammed Ali in Syria and the coup<br/>
d'etat of Napoleon III. The last two revolutionary wars-the Indian Mutiny and our own<br/>
Civil War-had their origin, the first in the.<br/>
natural clash of two civilizations, the second in<br/>
the clash of two great principles.<br/>
<br/>
Roughly, there were twenty important wars<br/>
in which the underlying causes were true international questions. Of these, three were<br/>
probably fought on principle, although the<br/>
price of victory in each case was territorial<br/>
aggrandizement. These three were the war<br/>
of France against Austria to establish the<br/>
Kingdom of Italy, in return for which France<br/>
became mistress of Savoy; the war <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
</span>followed England's interference in dynastic<br/>
troubles in Afghanistan; and our own war<br/>
with Spain.<br/>
<br/>
Another division of this great group of wars<br/>
embraces three wars fought primarily and<br/>
principally for commercial reasons, not always<br/>
too lofty. The three wars are the so-called<br/>
"Opium War," whereby Britain forced the<br/>
opium trade into China; the Boer War; and<br/>
the Boxer troubles in China.<br/>
<br/>
The fourteen other great international struggles were wars for territorial aggrandizement,<br/>
although in each case there were plausible<br/>
pretexts in the shape of national honor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">commercial </span>rights, and other considerations that<br/>
weigh with the nations.<br/>
<br/>
Of the forty wars classified in the preceding<br/>
paragraphs, twenty-four appear to be of kinds<br/>
that might have yielded to a possible solution<br/>
through the medium of a peace movement<br/>
sufficiently powerful. The considerations upon<br/>
which this statement is based must be made<br/>
quite clear.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the twenty revolutionary wars,<br/>
a sharp distinction must be drawn between<br/>
the political and the racial wars. The experience of this period has taught the world that<br/>
arbitration, in the shape of armed interference<br/>
between the combatants is possible in the case<br/>
of purely political revolutions, and sometimes<br/>
in revolutions not purely political. England<br/>
and Russia helped Greece to freedom; France<br/>
helped Belgium to break the bonds of Holland;<br/>
England aided Turkey in the war against<br/>
Mohammed Ali; France came to the succor of<br/>
<br/>
THE PREVENTION OF WAR<br/>
Italy; England interfered between Spain and<br/>
Portugal; the United States stepped between<br/>
Spain and Cuba.<br/>
<br/>
There is no good reason to suppose that an<br/>
overwhelming world-movement for arbitration without arms would have met with failure<br/>
in any one of such cases. In them there is<br/>
seldom any great element of national honor<br/>
involved, nor is there any great underlying<br/>
vital principle. They are as purely political<br/>
struggles as are the annual elections in countries<br/>
where party feeling runs high. This is the<br/>
most promising of all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>for the<br/>
newer apostles of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it is hardly conceivable that a<br/>
peace-movement, however universal, could<br/>
have prevented the Indian Mutiny, the Civil<br/>
War in America, or the present outbreak of<br/>
bloody revolution in Russia. In India, an<br/>
ancient civilization was gradually <span style="color: #0000FF;">encroached<br/>
</span>upon by a new, all-conquering civilization. It<br/>
is too much to hope that, pending the <span style="color: #0000FF;">millennium</span>, any peace <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>touch the<br/>
roots of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>struggle like this.<br/>
<br/>
Our own Civil War was very different, yet<br/>
one must hesitate to class it as a contest that<br/>
could have been easily arbitrated. It was not<br/>
a revolution so much as it was a great war of<br/>
principle. When a strong nation, evenly<br/>
divided, fights for what it deems its God-given<br/>
rights, it would be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">powerful </span>movement indeed<br/>
that could prevent a clash of arms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day</span>,<br/>
in Russia, one might well preach peace in vain<br/>
to hordes of men who have not had enough<br/>
to eat in years, whose mothers, sisters, or<br/>
daughters have been outraged or slain by the<br/>
soldiers of the Empire.<br/>
<br/>
If the possibilities of the peace movement<br/>
are limited in the revolutionary wars, they are<br/>
doubly limited in the domain of international<br/>
war. Of the forty wars pointed out above,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fourteen-X </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">per </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cCntr</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-arose </span>from national<br/>
pride, from the desire of a nation to grow in<br/>
greatness and in territorial wealth. When<br/>
Peter the Great made his will, he bequeathed<br/>
to all his successors on the throne of Russia<br/>
a fixed, definite, never-to-be-shaken ambition.<br/>
It was to plant the banner of Russia over more<br/>
and more of the littoral of the Baltic and the<br/>
Black Sea. The fruit of that bequest within<br/>
the period covered in this discussion consists<br/>
of three great wars, costing in all more than<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">500,000,000 </span>in money and nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">8oo</span>, ooo<br/>
human lives. The Powers of Europe have<br/>
stood banded against the carrying out of this<br/>
<br/>
