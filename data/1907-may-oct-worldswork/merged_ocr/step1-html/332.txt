<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9130 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TOWN<br/>
</span>was made to repeal the prohibition law. In<br/>
order to secure the vote of Mound Bayou,<br/>
which seems to have the balance of power in<br/>
the county on this question, a "still hunt"<br/>
was made among the voters in the community.<br/>
A plan was arranged by which a saloon was to<br/>
be established in the town and one of the<br/>
citizens made <span style="color: #ff0000;">proprietor</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>"This scheme came very near going through,"<br/>
said Mr. Montgomery. "The plan was all<br/>
arranged before we heard of it. Then we<br/>
called a meeting and I simply said to the people<br/>
that experience in our own town had taught us<br/>
that a saloon was a bad thing to have in the<br/>
community. I said that if the law was passed,<br/>
a colored man might run the saloon here, but<br/>
in the rest of the county they would be in the<br/>
hands of white men. We would pay for<br/>
maintaining them, however, and we would be<br/>
the ones to suffer. We voted the law down<br/>
and there has been no serious attempt to open<br/>
the county to the liquor traffic since."<br/>
<br/>
In a certain sense, it may be said that the<br/>
Mound Bayou town and colony have been a<br/>
school in self-government for its colonists.<br/>
They have had an opportunity there, such as<br/>
Negro people have rarely had elsewhere, to<br/>
learn the real meaning of political institutions<br/>
and to prepare themselves for the duties and<br/>
responsibilities of citizenship.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to note, in this connection,<br/>
that this is one of the few instance in which<br/>
Negroes have ever organized and maintained<br/>
in any Southern state a government which has<br/>
gained the entire respect of the Southern people.<br/>
A writer in a recent number of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Planer's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Journal</span>, published in Memphis, says<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Will the Negro as a race work out his own salvation<br/>
along Mound Bayou lines? Quien <span style="color: #0000FF;">sabe</span>? These have<br/>
worked out for themselves a better local government than<br/>
any superior people has ever done for them in freedom.<br/>
But it is a generally accepted principle in political economy<br/>
that any homogeneous people will in time do this. These<br/>
people have their local government, but it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>consonance<br/>
with the county, state, and national governments <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">international </span>conventions, all in the hands of another race.<br/>
Could they conduct as successfully a county government<br/>
in addition to their local government and still under the<br/>
state and national governments of another race? Enough<br/>
Negroes of the Mound Bayou type, and guided as they<br/>
were in the beginning, will be able to do so."<br/>
<br/>
The story of Mound Bayou would not be<br/>
complete without some account of the man who<br/>
founded the colony and to whose patience and<br/>
wisdom it owes the greater part of its success.<br/>

</span>BY NEGROES<br/>
<br/>
Isaiah T. Montgomery was born on the plantation of Joseph E. Davis, a brother of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jefferson </span>Davis, the President of the Confederate<br/>
States. The plantation where he was born,<br/>
in 1847, was known as "The Hurricane" and<br/>
was situated in Warren County, Miss. His<br/>
father, Benjamin Thornton Montgomery, came<br/>
originally from Virginia. He was purchased<br/>
in Vicksburg by Mr. Davis, while he was still<br/>
a boy. He had picked up a little education<br/>
from his young master in Virginia before he<br/>
was sold South. After he came into the possession of Mr. Davis, he managed to acquire,<br/>
in some way that Isaiah could never account<br/>
for, a very good practical education, so that he<br/>
was able to make surveys and draw plans for<br/>
buildings, and for years he was in practical<br/>
control of the plantation upon which he was<br/>
employed. There were four children, all of<br/>
whom received the rudiments of an education<br/>
from their father.<br/>
<br/>
When he was nine years of age, Isaiah was<br/>
set to work sorting and filing letters and papers<br/>
in Mr Davis's office, and from that time he<br/>
lived in his master's home. He had a great<br/>
deal of copying to do for Mr. Davis and it<br/>
was in this way that he gained a practical<br/>
knowledge of written English that has stood<br/>
him in good stead ever since. As he grew<br/>
older he became the special attendant of Mr.<br/>
Davis, having charge of all his public and private papers, and he worked steadily in his office<br/>
until the breaking out of the Civil War. In<br/>
1863, Mr. Davis retired, upon the approach<br/>
of the Federal armies, to the interior of the<br/>
state, taking with him his slaves. Young<br/>
Montgomery was left behind with his father,<br/>
however, to assist in taking care of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">plantation</span>.<br/>
<br/>
After the destruction of the Federal gunboat <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ndianola</span>, at Hurricane, and the passage<br/>
of the Federal gunboats under the batteries<br/>
of Vicksburg, Isaiah entered the service of the<br/>
United States as a cabin-boy for Rear-Admiral<br/>
Porter. He was present, in his capacity as<br/>
cabin-boy, at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle </span>of Grand Gulf,<br/>
accompanied the first expedition up Red River,<br/>
and was a witness of the operations at the siege<br/>
and capitulation of Vicksburg. In the winter<br/>
of 1863, he lost his health and was discharged<br/>
from the navy at Mound City. From there<br/>
he went to Cincinnati, where, through the<br/>
kindness of Admiral Porter, his parents had<br/>
been able to precede him.<br/>

Immediately after the war, Isaiah's father<br/>
