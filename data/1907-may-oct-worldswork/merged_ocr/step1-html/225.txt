</span>THE FARM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, NEAR KNOXVILLE<br/>
<br/>
It was the centre, very much as Charleston<br/>
was, of the extreme Southern sentiment for<br/>
many years after the war-naturally; but<br/>
that was long ago, and this political and social<br/>
feeling later came to act <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>as a wholesome<br/>
conservative force and has prevented the<br/>
spirit of commercialism from setting up new<br/>
standards. Solidity and dignity mark its life.<br/>
To persons who like character in cities as well<br/>
as in people, Richmond is one of the most attractive places of residence to be found anywhere in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The hand of Industry has touched it, too.<br/>
From locomotive works to a baking-powder<br/>
factory, its manufactures have grown <span style="color: #0000FF;">rapidly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-from </span>35 million dollars' output in 1895 to<br/>
70 <span style="color: #0000FF;">millions</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>year. Years and years ago,<br/>
somebody began to make cook-stoves there.<br/>
Now there are three big factories. In the<br/>
building of the old Libby prison soon after the<br/>
war, a man with one lathe began to make<br/>
tubs and pails of cedar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day</span>, that factory<br/>
covers twelve acres of land, employs 2,000 men,<br/>
and owns 2,000,000 acres of timber-land, and<br/>
has its own railroads and barges and steamers.<br/>
More than half the blotting paper used in the<br/>
world is made in Richmond (so they tell you)<br/>
--$ 4, ooo, ooo worth of it. The manufacturers<br/>
buy rags in England, Germany, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sweden-everywhere</span>. The bank deposits in the city<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A STREET SCENE IN MEMPHIS, TENN., IN <span style="color: #ff0000;">MARCH<br/>
<br/>
</span>The quantities of cotton <span style="color: #ff0000;">overran </span>the warehouses and was piled (to be rained on and soiled and damaged) in <span style="color: #0000FF;">vacant<br/>
<br/>
</span>lots and on business streets.<br/>
warehouse and shipping house is in course of erection.<br/>
<br/>
All the transportation systems were inadequate to move it.<br/>
<br/>
An enormous combination<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
