</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>ing in the public schools of New York<br/>
<br/>
is as simple as it is short. In 1905<br/>
an organization was formed for the purpose of<br/>
providing for the schoolgirls of New York<br/>
what the Public Schools Athletic League was<br/>
already providing for one hundred thousand<br/>
schoolboys of the city-interesting and helpful recreation that would have a real part in<br/>
their lives outside of school hours. It set out<br/>
to cope with one of the biggest problems of<br/>
this city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff-dwellings</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Manhattan children-and this is true of the<br/>
children of all congested cities-have almost<br/>
no place in which to play except the streets;<br/>
but of all the children in the world, city children have the greatest need for healthy play.<br/>
It is a matter of the very first importance that<br/>
they should have a chance to gain muscular<br/>
control and bodily dexterity-for the ordinary<br/>
<br/>
conditions of their life do not provide <span style="color: #0000FF;">thatto </span>say nothing of the vigor and stimulation<br/>
that comes with right exercise to all the functions of the body-the work of stomach and<br/>
heart, lungs and brain.<br/>
<br/>
Five hours a day in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolroom</span>, and<br/>
then the crowded, ill-ventilated tenement or<br/>
apartment house, with perhaps a game of tag<br/>
or hop-scotch or jump-rope in the midst of the<br/>
hubbub and dirt of the street, make up the life<br/>
of the average city child.<br/>
<br/>
Some school buildings possess gymnasiums<br/>
and playgrounds, but out of school hours they<br/>
do nobody any good. Here was the opportunity, if only the right form of organization<br/>
and alliance with the educational system of<br/>
the city could be secured. Such an alliance<br/>
had already been secured by the Public Schools<br/>
Athletic League, and the Girls' Branch followed. Under suitable provisions for <span style="color: #0000FF;">control<br/>
<br/>
