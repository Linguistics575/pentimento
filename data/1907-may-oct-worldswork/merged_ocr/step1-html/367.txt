<br/>
</span>wrong relation to life and to work in this year<br/>
1907 and in these United States of America.<br/>
Such unions are throwing away the help and<br/>
sympathy and cooperation of other working<br/>
men-of the owners of this shop, for example,<br/>
who themselves are working men or nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course</span>, such an <span style="color: #0000FF;">effort </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>foregone failure.<br/>
Else who could conduct shops with any hope<br/>
of success? But for the moment even as pitiful<br/>
an <span style="color: #0000FF;">effort </span>to reverse human progress as this is<br/>
causes some trouble. For instance, a part of<br/>
the edition of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">July </span>number of THE WORLD'S<br/>
WORK was delayed for a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">days</span>, to the<br/>
annoyance of some subscribers. There are<br/>
very few pardonable reasons for <span style="color: #0000FF;">delay </span>in issuing<br/>
a periodical. But, if any delay be pardonable,<br/>
the publishers hope that this is.<br/>
<br/>
To those who have been patient or sympathetic under this annoyance, the publishers<br/>
wish to express their hearty appreciation. The<br/>
union feeders and pressmen hare done them<br/>
good service by making this publishing house<br/>
an open shop from the top <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>to the basement;<br/>
and it will remain an open shop.<br/>
<br/>
Most questions that arise in the conduct of<br/>
life or of industry <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>debatable<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>But this is<br/>
not one of them. The conclusion was reached<br/>
before the controversy was begun. The owners<br/>
of this publishing house might conceivably<br/>
shut it up and earn their livings in some other<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">way-a </span>contingency, however, that is not<br/>
imminent; but, as they regard their duty to<br/>
themselves and to society, they could not <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceivably</span>' conduct it at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">retrogressive </span>and<br/>
uneconomic dictation of other persons, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>when this dictation is based on a plan of<br/>
work that makes for inefficiency and weakens<br/>
manhood.<br/>
<br/>
THE CONFLICT ABOUT PUBLIC LANDS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">THERE </span>is, of course, a body of laws <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
</span>govern the care and the use and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">disposition </span>of government lands in the Western<br/>
States. But <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>of them have been so <span style="color: #0000FF;">systematically </span>disregarded, evaded, and violated<br/>
that in many communities they have become<br/>
a dead letter. Public opinion has become adjusted to evading them. Important enterprises<br/>
are conducted in disregard of them, and<br/>
large investments made. Many men ceased<br/>
supposing that they would ever be rigidly <span style="color: #0000FF;">enforced</span>; and the "moral sentiment" of many<br/>
communities approved their <span style="color: #0000FF;">desuetude</span>. Yet<br/>
in the main these are wise laws, necessary<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9165<br/>
<br/>
</span>for the proper use or for the preservation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>forests and water-supplies.<br/>
<br/>
When the present Administration began to<br/>
enforce them, many prominent men were indicted and some were convicted. But the<br/>
sympathy of a large part of the public in the<br/>
West was with the violators and not with the<br/>
enforcers of the law. At the recent Public<br/>
Land Convention in Denver, the Colorado<br/>
delegates <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>badges denouncing "interference by Government bureaus <span style="color: #ff0000;">iinder </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">autocratic </span>rules and <span style="color: #0000FF;">regulations</span>"; Senator Heyburn exhibited a map of Idaho showing the<br/>
large areas of forest reserves and spoke as if<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government </span>had forcibly and wantonly<br/>
taken this land from people who had titles to<br/>
it; and the drift of the addresses was against<br/>
the enforcement of the law.<br/>
<br/>
The whole subject is in a chaotic state.<br/>
Congress stopped some executive orders touching land-administration while they were in<br/>
process of execution. .The Western sentiment<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>strong part of it at least-is opposed to<br/>
the proper preservation of these forests. The<br/>
Administration is, of course, in favor of their<br/>
preservation. The public opinion of the coun<br/>
try (except so much of it as is more or less<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'scifi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>interested or has <span style="color: #ff0000;">suftered </span>hardship<br/>
because of the recent enforcement of laws long<br/>
disregarded) demands that the policy of the<br/>
Administration be carried out. The conflict<br/>
will continue in Congress, as it is all the while<br/>
appearing in the courts, where land-thieves<br/>
are brought to trial. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the general purpose<br/>
of the existing laws and the policy of the President prevail, as they are likely to do, Mr.<br/>
Roosevelt will receive the thanks of the next<br/>
generation, which will be more earnest even<br/>
than the opposition of the present. The<br/>
Western trip of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Secreta </span>ry <span style="color: #0000FF;">Garfield</span>, Mr. Pinchot,<br/>
of the Bureau of Forestry, and Mr. Ballinger,<br/>
Land Commissioner, was a wise use of the<br/>
summer. These capable and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1ouragcous </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">public<br/>
</span>servants can have no aim but the public <span style="color: #0000FF;">good</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>of this generation and of the next; and they will<br/>
be able to present the problem and to execute<br/>
the laws and to frame policies with first-hand<br/>
information.<br/>
