</span>THE<br/>

CASINO AT MAR DE LA PLATA, AN ARGENTINE SUMMER- <span style="color: #0000FF;">th'OR'l<br/>
<br/>
</span>The people of the Argentine are luxurious in their tastes, and demand a beauty and a style <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their<br/>
public facilities that is seldom surpassed on the North American Continent<br/>
<br/>
since the Japanese occupation. According to<br/>
the geography that I studied in my school days,<br/>
the population of the island was about evenly<br/>
divided between head-hunters and pirates, and<br/>
it was only the exceptionally lucky or agile that<br/>
ever arrived at years of discretion. Murder<br/>
and sudden death were not accidents but<br/>
incidents. They were the ordinary lot of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sinful </span>man in that forsaken country. To-day,<br/>
there are more than 5,000 citizens who <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>money in the savings banks! Several hundred<br/>
miles of railroad connect the various towns;<br/>
the telegraph and telephone have taken the<br/>
place of the signal fires on the hills.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of heathen pirate revels, there are<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">r. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l<br/>
<br/>
</span>over a hundred and fifty schools all <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>country, conducted by the Government, and<br/>
everybody goes to school. Some of the pupils,<br/>
it is true, were once head-hunters, and others<br/>
were pirates. But the bottom dropped out of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">head-hunting </span>business, and piracy became<br/>
unconventional. They turned their minds to<br/>
books and their hands to the writing of bills of<br/>
lading. In 1896, the foreign trade was just<br/>
beginning-it totaled <span style="color: #0000FF;">0nly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1,313,000</span>. To-day<br/>
it is close to $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">hS</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo-and </span>still growing.<br/>
In 1890, 681 inhabitants were killed by raiding<br/>
savages from the deep forests. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day </span>the raids<br/>
are practically over, and the raiders have either<br/>
paid with their lives or gone to school<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

The shipping facilities created in recent years for the great Argentine port are probably as modern and complete as<br/>
those of any harbor in the world<br/>
