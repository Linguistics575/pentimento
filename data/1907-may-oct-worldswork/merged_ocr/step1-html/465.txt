<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Commission took over all the work of<br/>
the association, proceeded with the census,<br/>
enlarged the experiment plant, opened an<br/>
attractive shop in a fashionable shopping<br/>
district of Boston, and will open industrial<br/>
shops in other parts of the state as seems<br/>
advisable. The Commission furnishes blind<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">home-workers </span>with raw materials. It starts<br/>
trustworthy blind men and women in business,<br/>
with the understanding that if they succeed,<br/>
they will pay back the amount the State has<br/>
lent them. The Commission gives information<br/>
to sightless persons who seek positions. Above<br/>
all things, it urges upon each community its<br/>
responsibility for the care and employment of<br/>
the blind within its precincts. State institutions can train the blind man; but his <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowcitizens </span>must furnish the market for his products, and see to it that he gets his fair share<br/>
of patronage.<br/>
<br/>
A GREAT PRACTICAL WORK<br/>
<br/>
In Massachusetts, happily, opposition<br/>
between the old order and the new has ceased.<br/>
The Perkins Institution for the Blind and the<br/>
Commission are working together. The shop<br/>
where the Commission puts on sale the work<br/>
of the sightless is under the same roof with<br/>
the salesroom of the Perkins Institution. The<br/>
school in changing its attitude has set an<br/>
example which other institutions cannot afford<br/>
to disregard. For the new movement in behalf<br/>
of the blind will not cease until every sightless<br/>
person in our land has the chance to earn at<br/>
least part of his support.<br/>
<br/>
Philanthropists and public-spirited people<br/>
all over the country have taken up the work.<br/>
Business men are advocating it. Great men<br/>
like Mark Twain and Mr. Choate have<br/>
approved it. Governors and legislatures have<br/>
given it public sanction. Its complete success<br/>
now depends on three classes of responsible<br/>
persons: First, the directors of the institutions<br/>
and other educators; second, the trustees of<br/>
the institutions and the State Boards; third<br/>
and ultimately, the public, of which the blind<br/>
man is one.<br/>
<br/>
We ask that the directors be cultivated men,<br/>
sincerely interested in the whole problem; that<br/>
if they have not the initiative to lead the way<br/>
to progress, they will accept and carry out<br/>
intelligent suggestions. We ask that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trustees </span>of our institutions for the blind be chosen<br/>
for the highest interest of the sightless, for their<br/>
competency, and not merely for name, <span style="color: #ff0000;">family<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
or social eminence. We ask that they be men<br/>
who can afford a little time to study the <span style="color: #ff0000;">prob<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lems </span>of the blind. We ask that the trustees<br/>
be so qualified that no director or teacher or<br/>
any other person can impose upon them as to<br/>
the condition, work or efficiency of the school,<br/>
or the accomplishments of its graduates. We<br/>
ask that the trustees build schools for the blind<br/>
on land suited to the peculiar needs of the<br/>
sightless.<br/>
<br/>
THE NEED OF OPEN AIR EMPLOYMENT<br/>
<br/>
The blind need to be placed where they can<br/>
have plenty of room for playgrounds and learn<br/>
a little of farming and gardening. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Willowwork </span>is one of the well known industries for<br/>
the blind in Europe; but it has not been introduced here, except in Wisconsin, because of<br/>
the lack of willow. Why not plant willow<br/>
on land near the institutions, and employ<br/>
blind people to trim and care for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">willowgroves</span>? Why not let the blind raise poultry?<br/>
It has proved a profitable industry for them<br/>
in England. If these suggestions do not prove<br/>
practical, the fact remains that the sightless<br/>
need large playgrounds-out-of-door life.<br/>
Their inactivity and often the disease which<br/>
caused their blindness keep them undeveloped<br/>
and anemic. If they are to become strong,<br/>
healthy men and women, they must have a<br/>
great deal of unrestrained exercise in the open<br/>
air. In the old days there was at least an excuse<br/>
for putting the institutions in the cities; but<br/>
now, when the trolley makes the country accessible, every consideration of economy and wellbeing for the sightless cries out against the<br/>
blasting of the rock of crowded Manhattan for<br/>
the purpose of building a school for the blind.<br/>
Such costly building was, I am told, meditated<br/>
by the trustees of the New York Institution,<br/>
and I am glad to learn that they have abandoned<br/>
the idea. I shall be glad too, and all the friends<br/>
of the blind will rejoice, if the trustees of the<br/>
Perkins Institution succeed in their wise efforts<br/>
to move the school out in the country.<br/>
<br/>
We ask the public to take all these matters<br/>
to heart and understand the needs of the sightless. The strangest ignorance exists in the<br/>
minds of people as to what the blind can do.<br/>
They are amazed when they hear that a blind<br/>
person can write on the typewriter, dress <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span>without assistance, go up and down stairs<br/>
alone, eat with a fork and know when the sun<br/>
is shining. But they are ready to believe that<br/>
we have a special stock of senses to replace those<br/>
<br/>
