<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9048 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>MARCH<br/>
had been made four or <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>years ago of<br/>
the condition and of the conduct of all the<br/>
companies doing business in the United States,<br/>
and if a similar examination could be made<br/>
now, there is little doubt that a very great<br/>
improvement would <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>discovered. The rights<br/>
of stockholders are more carefully considered.<br/>
Not long ago the counsel of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">private </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">corporation </span>in New York was preparing a tax statement, and the officers of the company said to<br/>
him: "Prepare it exactly as if you knew that<br/>
the company would be <span style="color: #0000FF;">examined </span>next week as<br/>
the insurance companies were, or as if an<br/>
inquiry were to be made by the Department<br/>
of Commerce and Labor." The <span style="color: #ff0000;">eouble </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">standard </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">conduct-one </span>standard for private<br/>
affairs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>for corporate affairs is<br/>
less common than it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Every act or tendency or awakening that<br/>
makes for honesty and for fair dealing directly<br/>
adds to the stability of values, to the security<br/>
of investments, and to financial confidence.<br/>
These forces are far stronger for stability than<br/>
the rhetorical alarm in <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>circles is for<br/>
panic. Moreover, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>checking, by <span style="color: #ff0000;">imy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lcgitimate </span>force, of the ambitions of great financial<br/>
consolidators has itself added to prosperity<br/>
and security.<br/>
<br/>
The agitation and activity touching the<br/>
regulation of corporations have then, on the<br/>
whole, in spite of some <span style="color: #0000FF;">overzealous </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mischievous </span>activity, been a constructive and<br/>
conservative and <span style="color: #0000FF;">upbuilding </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>.<br/>
<br/>
THE OUTSIDE CRITIC OF THE RAILROAD<br/>
<br/>
ANY books have been published of late<br/>
with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>to the elucidation of the<br/>
railroad problem. The authors of these books<br/>
are not railroad men, but are generally students<br/>
who have devoted much time and labor to the<br/>
study of the railroad business. They know<br/>
the theoretical side of the problem much better<br/>
than the railroad presidents know it, and they<br/>
all have a smattering of the practical side.<br/>
They have failed to settle the problem; they<br/>
have failed, indeed, even to define it. Most<br/>
of them have made it clear that a problem<br/>
exists, but that has been an axiom for many<br/>
years. The reason why none of the bulky<br/>
volumes published on the subject has really<br/>
accomplished much is that they have not<br/>
brought practical advice to a <span style="color: #ff0000;">practicaltask</span>.<br/>
They have undertaken to build a ship by<br/>
merely making sketch-drawings of what a<br/>
ship should be<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ob</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>EV CNTS<br/>
<br/>
In the office of a railroad president, one hears<br/>
very little of these writers or of their books.<br/>
The chance remarks of men like Messrs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ripley</span>, Finley, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kruttschnitt</span>, Winchell, and the<br/>
other men who really operate railroads will<br/>
all be found on <span style="color: #ff0000;">file</span>; but the critical books<br/>
are not in sight. The reason is that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">worldold </span>antagonism between the theorist and the<br/>
practical man is just as much alive as it ever<br/>
was.<br/>
<br/>
The railroad heads are working hard to find<br/>
a solution of the problems that confront them;<br/>
but they are not willing to adopt any Utopian<br/>
dream that comes along. They hear of abuses<br/>
in their railroads, and they remedy the abuses<br/>
by calling into conference the men under<br/>
whose immediate command the abuses occur.<br/>
Discipline grows strict, and responsibility is<br/>
piled upon the agents, managers, and superintendents. The first result of the agitation<br/>
has been the strengthening of the railroad<br/>
discipline, and the promulgation of a new code<br/>
that makes it a grave offense to be accused<br/>
by the patrons or the newspapers.<br/>
<br/>
The patrons of the railroad are looming<br/>
much larger in the view of the manager than<br/>
they loomed a year ago. It was the habit to<br/>
run the railroad for the big shippers, and let<br/>
the general public do business with it if it<br/>
pleased. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-day </span>the general public comes<br/>
first. This is a long step in the right direction.<br/>
Other steps are to follow, as the railroad<br/>
heads can work them out. They must <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">urged </span>to new efforts-and in this respect <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>"outside critic" performs a useful service<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>THE REGENERATION OF THE RAILROADS<br/>
<br/>
HE year has seen the beginning of a new<br/>
<br/>
era in the administration of American<br/>
railroad corporations. It has been a year of<br/>
persistent agitation, of the constant turning<br/>
over and over of a great principle, the principle<br/>
that the people are greater than any private<br/>
organization of capital.<br/>
<br/>
The result comes slowly to light. In the<br/>
end, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>will give us a new school of financiers,<br/>
following the gradual disappearance of those<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">m </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ignates </span>who stand for <span style="color: #0000FF;">autocracy </span>and for the<br/>
obsolescent, cynical code of corporation ethics<br/>
that has been the conventional thing in <span style="color: #0000FF;">administration </span>for the last ten years. This old<br/>
order changes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">yielding </span>stubbornly, it is true,<br/>
but surely.<br/>
<br/>
There has never before been an era in <span style="color: #0000FF;">American </span>finance and public policy when the voice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
