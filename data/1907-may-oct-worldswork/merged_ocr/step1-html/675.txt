<span>A UNIVERSITY PUEBLO<br/>
<br/>
The students have caught the spirit of the<br/>
Indian design and take the greatest interest in<br/>
carrying out the pueblo idea. Inside the buildings, picturesque Indian decorations have been<br/>
worked out on the walls and ceilings of the reception rooms, patterned after designs on the<br/>
Sikyatki <span style="color: #0000FF;">pottery </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>from other sources. There<br/>
are brilliant friezes, copied from the highly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conventionalized </span>symbolism of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pucblos-adaptations </span>of birds and beasts and reptiles;<br/>
the rainbow-god in his various forms; the moongod and the sun-god and unnumbered other<br/>
gods, all composing an interesting study in the<br/>
art of the ancient Indians. Mural decoration<br/>
reached a high development among these ancient peoples. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quaint </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">beautifuldesigns </span>have been discovered in various <span style="color: #0000FF;">care<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">houses </span>and cliff-dwellings, and on the faces of<br/>
cliffs in many places.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">University </span>has made use of black hardwood "swastikas" (Indian good-luck symbols),<br/>
hanging horizontally, as frames for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">electroliers</span>. In the students' rooms are Indian rugs,<br/>
pottery, and baskets, easily procurable from the<br/>
many Indians living in the vicinity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Albuquerque</span>. Bows and arrows, moccasins, and<br/>
bead-work curios hang on the walls alongside<br/>
photographs of harvest dances and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sarrcd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ceremonials</span>. In the main reception room of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">women</span>'s building is a large vase brought from<br/>
the ruins of Sikyatki and bearing one of the<br/>
interesting emblematic designs which has been<br/>
made use of elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The complete pueblo scheme, as worked out<br/>
by Dr. Tight and the architect, Mr. E. B.<br/>
Cristy, is a practical one. To the two dormitories now in use others <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>to be added on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>unit<br/>
system as the University grows. Plans and<br/>
specifications have been completed for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entire<br/>

be remodeled along pueblo lines and all the new<br/>
buildings will follow the same style.<br/>
<br/>
Two immense, irregular rectangles, each a<br/>
model of a complete communal city, will face<br/>
each other across a fifty-foot <span style="color: #0000FF;">tree-lined </span>avenue.<br/>
Each of these rectangles will consist of about<br/>
six buildings, so connected that when the whole<br/>
is finished it will appear to be one building. At<br/>
the back of the rectangle, the main building or<br/>
highest part of the pueblo will be three stories<br/>
and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">half </span>in height. This will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>used <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dining </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>kitchen, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">laundrics</span>, provision<br/>
rooms, storehouses, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">zlceessories </span>of the<br/>
"mess-hall." Adjoining this highest building,<br/>
on each side, will be another, two stories and a<br/>
half <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-jo-ko-na</span>," the women's dormitory, being one of these. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear </span>corners will<br/>
be "L" -shaped buildings, slightly lower, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span>'s dormitory having been constructed with<br/>
this end in view. From the high building at the<br/>
