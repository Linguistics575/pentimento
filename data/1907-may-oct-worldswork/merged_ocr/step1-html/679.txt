<span>THE MONEY-KINGS<br/>
<br/>
placed it in 4,000 national and state banks,<br/>
all over the country. The report of the Comptroller of the Currency, just out, has been our<br/>
guide. We have deposit accounts, in hundreds<br/>
of names, of course, about equal to the amount<br/>
of cash that each of these banks normally<br/>
carries in its vaults. Our plan is to make a<br/>
simultaneous demand upon these banks for<br/>
the deposits, in cash. We are of the opinion that we shall get at least <span style="color: #0000FF;">five-sixths </span>of<br/>
the total amount, at once. Whenever <span style="color: #0000FF;">possible</span>, our agents will be instructed to get<br/>
gold from the banks, or at least legal-tender<br/>
money, rather than bank-notes. All notes<br/>
received, whether bank-notes or government<br/>
notes, will be presented immediately to the<br/>
proper authorities for redemption in gold.<br/>

<br/>
He sat down. The Banker had just cut the<br/>
tip off his cigar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Absent-mindedly</span>, he scratched<br/>
on the mahogany table, as the host finished,<br/>
the single word, "all." And as he scratched<br/>
he kept his eyes on the tip of the knife. He<br/>
knew that every eye about the table watched<br/>
his face. He said nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The Gambler broke the silence with a laugh.<br/>
<br/>
"It looks like enough!" he said.<br/>
<br/>
"Shall we do it?" It was the host that<br/>
asked the question, and he wet his lips with<br/>
his tongue as he spoke.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes!" said the Industrial Magnate, softly.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes!" echoed the other three<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>They left in silence. It was no time for<br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
OUR STORE OF REAL MONEY<br/>
<br/>
Yes-it could be done! I take it that if<br/>
the accounts were well distributed one billion<br/>
dollars of bank credits could be simultaneously<br/>
converted into bills and silver and gold in this<br/>
country. The last report issued by Mr. William<br/>
Barrett Ridgely, the Comptroller of the Currency, showed that there were in all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">banks-national</span>, state, savings, and trust <span style="color: #0000FF;">companies</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-deposits </span>of real money that aggregated a little<br/>
less than $ r, <span style="color: #ff0000;">roo</span>, ooo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooo</span>. In addition, of<br/>
course, there is another two billions or more in<br/>
circulation, outside the banks. If a billion<br/>
dollars of bank credits were to-day presented<br/>
to solvent banks for conversion into money,<br/>
practically all the real money in the vaults<br/>
would be drawn out to meet that demand.<br/>
<br/>
But <span style="color: #0000FF;">gold-what </span>of the gold? For gold is<br/>
currency in all lands, and gold it must be, if<br/>
men determine to wreck the United States and<br/>
<br/>
9477<br/>
<br/>
all that is in it. Perhaps all the banks hold<br/>
$ 200,000,000 of gold in their vaults. Another<br/>
half-billion is scattered about the country, over<br/>
the line in the banks of Canada-they want our<br/>
gold, having no coinage of their own-hidden<br/>
in hoards for export to Italy, or China, or any<br/>
other land that sends us citizens, locked up as<br/>
"christening gifts" for infants. That is not<br/>
commercial gold and could not be drawn out.<br/>
The rest, perhaps $ 900,000,000, is in the<br/>
Treasury of the United States. The conspirators could draw it out. The "gold certificates," the bills that lie in your <span style="color: #0000FF;">pocket</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally-will </span>demand it. It must be<br/>
paid. Practically, the Government is pledged<br/>
to pay all its bills in specie.<br/>
<br/>
And then-the panic! Perhaps you think<br/>
not<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Then let us look to history. One <span style="color: #0000FF;">day-you</span>, old bankers of the Street, will remember<br/>
the day, the 9th of August, <span style="color: #0000FF;">18th-a </span>man came<br/>
post-haste to Wall Street from the Treasury<br/>
at Washington. He needed money. Wall<br/>
Street gave it to him. He thought that he<br/>
wanted it in gold, thinking that so he could<br/>
scatter it about the country and meet payments<br/>
in gold, thereby making the credit of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ctruggling </span>Government look better than it was.<br/>
Voices were raised against him, vehement<br/>
voices, voices that spoke golden wisdom. Mr.<br/>
James Gallatin, president of the National<br/>
Bank of New York, said to him:<br/>
<br/>
"Coin is the basis of credit. It is impossible<br/>
to maintain the superstructure of credit when<br/>
the basis is withdrawn, for in destroying the<br/>
basis the superstructure is also swept away!"<br/>
<br/>
But Mr. Salmon P. Chase knew better. So<br/>
he carted away from Wall Street $ 170,000,000<br/>
in gold, and scattered it abroad. <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">our </span>months<br/>
later, the banks of the United States were compelled to repudiate the greenbacks. The<br/>
dollar fell in value to 62 cents. It took almost<br/>
twenty years to bring it back again to par.<br/>
<br/>
THE MEANING OF A GOLD FAMINE<br/>
<br/>
Again, let us go back no further than <span style="color: #ff0000;">1893</span>.<br/>
In that year, through a legislative blunder, gold<br/>
was drawn away from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Treasury </span>in huge<br/>
masses. This continued through 1894 and<br/>
1895. The surplus of gold in the Treasury <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>protect the outstanding bills dropped, and<br/>
dropped. When bonds were sold and gold<br/>
poured into the Treasury, it faded away like a<br/>
morning mist. Not only did foreigners call for<br/>
it, but the people themselves hesitated, talked<br/>
it over, then finally began to call for gold. <span style="color: #ff0000;">All<br/>
