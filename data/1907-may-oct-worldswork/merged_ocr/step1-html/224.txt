people. Under the leadership, in great measure,<br/>
of women of a conquering energy and of social<br/>
power, the whole state has been organized.<br/>
The last legislature made appropriations not<br/>
only beyond precedent but far beyond any<br/>
preceding expectation. Since its adjournment,<br/>
as many as <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>new high schools have been<br/>
built. School-grounds are much larger, and<br/>
school architecture has been much improved.<br/>
Since August <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist</span>, last year, Mr. Eggleston, the<br/>
Superintendent of Schools, reports that new<br/>
school buildings have been erected in Virginia<br/>
that have cost as much as $ 330,000. Last<br/>
year more than 500 local meetings of white<br/>
teachers and 200 of colored teachers and 448<br/>

<br/>
but Mr. Henry James would undertake to<br/>
describe the city in a magazine; and many<br/>
citizens of the city did not clearly recognize it<br/>
from his recent, brief, transcendental description. For the purpose of this running sketch,<br/>
Richmond serves as one of the very best<br/>
examples of the great change that is taking<br/>
place in the South, because all the typical<br/>
phenomena of the change are seen there, but<br/>
the change has been gradual. Richmond<br/>
has become commercial-in a sense, it always<br/>
was commercial-but it does not flaunt its<br/>
commercialism. It has not lost its old-time<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">character</span>. It is and it always will be a Southern<br/>
city-not a Southern city with Western <span style="color: #0000FF;">ways<br/>

RICHMOND, VA.<br/>
<br/>
In a rapid and general sketch, such as this<br/>
is, of a vast and rich territory, whatever facts<br/>
you may select to illustrate the changing habits<br/>
and outlook of the people are likely to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">concrete</span>, commercial facts.<br/>
<br/>
Consider Richmond, for example: nobody<br/>
<br/>
nor any such anomaly. After you get beneath<br/>
the surface, it is more like Boston than it is<br/>
like any other city outside the South-it retains<br/>
its character. In retaining its character, it<br/>
retains some characteristics that are vexatious<br/>
to the more modern spirits; but, after all,<br/>
who would have Richmond and Charleston<br/>
and New Orleans mere repetitions of newer<br/>
cities in the North or West?<br/>
<br/>
The rich men build their beautiful country<br/>
homes on their estates just outside the city.<br/>
This keeps up the old Southern country habit<br/>
and gives a good excuse for fine horses. In<br/>
general, its social life keeps its character that<br/>
has for generations made it one of the most<br/>
interesting communities in the United States.<br/>
