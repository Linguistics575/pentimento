<span>WHAT IS A <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHOP-GIRL</span>'S LIFE?<br/>
<br/>
charity are intolerable. The endless rules<br/>
and regulations, the apparent assumption that<br/>
she is by nature immoral and can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">prevented </span>from going straight to ruin only by<br/>
being hedged about by all sorts of iron-clad<br/>
restrictions, are insulting and humiliating to her,<br/>
and make the inmates of the "home" (God<br/>
save the mark!) both <span style="color: #0000FF;">rebellious </span>and unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
These places are cheap and clean and comfortable, however; they provide a safe shelter<br/>
and decent food at a lower cost than can be<br/>
obtained elsewhere, and, uncomfortable and<br/>
unhappy as the girls are while living there,<br/>
the clubs and homes are always crowded.<br/>
<br/>
Something of the endless demand for cheap<br/>
living accommodations for working women<br/>
was demonstrated by the rush that was made<br/>
for the rooms on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jacob </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A. </span>Stamler, Mr.<br/>
John Arbuckle's ship, which two years ago lay<br/>
at the dock at the foot of Twenty-third Street.<br/>
Here, every girl who had a room was supposed<br/>
to be self-respecting. No watch was kept<br/>
upon her, no iron-clad rules were made; but<br/>
every girl was upon her honor to conduct herself as she would in her own home. The<br/>
experiment proved a most happy and successful<br/>
one, but the dock was needed for other vessels,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jacob </span>A. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stamler </span>was removed.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD AND CHEAP <span style="color: #0000FF;">WOMEN</span>'S HOTELS<br/>
<br/>
Among the latest efforts to house the working girls at prices which they can afford to<br/>
pay are the low-priced women's hotels. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Trowmart </span>Inn is doing a great deal to solve the<br/>
problem for the low-salaried woman, so much,<br/>
in fact, that it is not only continually running<br/>
at full capacity, but is unable to take care of<br/>
one-third of its applicants; it always has a<br/>
waiting list of from two to three hundred.<br/>
At present it accommodates 248 women,<br/>
under thirty years of age, none of whom gets<br/>
a salary of more than fifteen dollars a week.<br/>
<br/>
With its clean, well-ventilated, sanitary<br/>
rooms, its excellent bathing facilities, its<br/>
lavatories and laundry, its roomy parlors and<br/>
pleasant library, always open to its guests,<br/>
with cozy little private parlors in which the<br/>
girls <span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>entertain particular friends, and<br/>
with music and dancing in the evening, and the<br/>
companionship of other girls, it supplies to the<br/>
average-salaried shop-girl, at $ 4.50 and $ 5<br/>
a week for room and board, comforts and<br/>
privileges which hitherto have been impossible<br/>
to her.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Trowmart </span>Inn is operated on precisely the.<br/>
<br/>
9315<br/>
<br/>
same principles as any other hotel. There<br/>
are no set hours for coming in or retiring; no<br/>
intimation by word or action that its guests<br/>
are "charity girls." The young woman who<br/>
makes it her home is as free and independent<br/>
as if she were living at the Waldorf or St.<br/>
Regis. Young women are permitted to entertain their men friends in the parlors and in the<br/>
library, and Saturday evenings they give little<br/>
hops to which their men friends are invited.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that are most appreciated<br/>
is the laundry. Few of the girls can afford<br/>
to have their laundry work done, and it is a<br/>
great help and comfort to them to have access<br/>
to a fine, large, well-ventilated laundry room,<br/>
where there are tubs, hot water and flatirons, and where they may go at any time<br/>
to wash out a shirt waist, press a skirt, or do<br/>
their regular weekly washing.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT THE SHOP-GIRL GETS OUT OF LIFE<br/>
<br/>
When the shop-girl leaves the store at night<br/>
her work is by no means done. She is obliged<br/>
to keep herself neat, clean, and respectably<br/>
clothed. As she cannot afford to hire her<br/>
washing done, or to have her clothes made<br/>
and mended, she has a task for every evening.<br/>
There are shirtwaists to be laundered, stockings<br/>
to darn, a coat to mend, a binding to sew on a<br/>
skirt. Her room and bureau drawers have to<br/>
be kept in order, letters home must be written,<br/>
and in the manifold tasks that she <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>to do<br/>
when she comes home from work the evening<br/>
passes by, and she falls wearily into bed to<br/>
sleep the sleep of exhaustion and awake to<br/>
another day of toil.<br/>
<br/>
It is the monotony and loneliness of their<br/>
lives that is the most trying thing to the girl<br/>
workers. Standing behind a counter all day<br/>
waiting on bargain-hunting women, they come<br/>
home at night, nervous and tired, to be confronted by the problems of food, of clothes,<br/>
of rent, of board, of forever providing for the<br/>
bare, material necessities of life. There is no<br/>
time for higher things.<br/>
<br/>
The shop-girl rises in the morning at six<br/>
o'clock, dresses in a hurry, fearing that she may<br/>
be late to her work, eats a hasty breakfast,<br/>
and hurries away. It may be that a special<br/>
sale is on, and all during the forenoon she is<br/>
rushed and distracted by a jostling mob of<br/>
petulant, unreasonable women.<br/>
<br/>
At noon comes a reprieve of forty-five minutes<br/>
during which she eats her luncheon and snatches<br/>
what rest she can before the rush and hurry,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
