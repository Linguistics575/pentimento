pueblo villages are covered with smooth adobe<br/>
plaster, identical in appearance with the more<br/>
durable veneer of the college buildings. The<br/>
dormitories are <span style="color: #ff0000;">f1at-roofed</span>, with broad porticoes<br/>
on each story. Sills, rafters, and pillars are of<br/>
roughly dressed pine logs, mortised and pinned<br/>
together after the fashion of the Indians. The<br/>
capitals of some of the wooden pillars <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>copied<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>those of the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sat </span>Miguel church in<br/>
Santa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fe </span>and the heavy wall buttresses are in<br/>
evidence. A prominent feature is the walled,<br/>
winding stairway outside, reminding one of the<br/>
steep and winding approaches to the modern<br/>
pueblos of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wolpi </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aroma</span>. Long ladders,<br/>
a familiar sight in the Indian villages of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tales<br/>
</span>and Laguna, lean against the buildings. On<br/>
the roof of each dormitory is an exact imitation<br/>
of an adobe Indian oven; this serves to cover a<br/>
reservoir whence water runs <span style="color: #ff0000;">throucrh </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">novel<br/>

</span>A PUEBLO <span style="color: #0000FF;">INDIAN </span>OF TO-DAY<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A UNIVERSITY PUEBLO<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">PUEBLO </span>() \ <span style="color: #0000FF;">EN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ON </span>A COLLEGE ROOF<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is used as a cover for the sun-heating plant<br/>
<br/>
sun-heater which heats the water for the bathrooms below.<br/>
<br/>
From the roofs of the buildings and from the<br/>
porticoes are magnificent views. For hundreds<br/>
of miles, in every direction, stretch valleys and<br/>
mesas and mountains. Fifteen or twenty<br/>
miles to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">east </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">apparently </span>only four or five<br/>
miles, so clear is the air-rises the abrupt and<br/>
precipitous wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sandie </span>range, with its<br/>
hare red cliffs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlements</span>, whose color<br/>
effects at sunset are marvelous. A hundred<br/>
miles to the west, beyond the Rio <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grande</span>, looms<br/>
faintly the rugged outline of Mount Taylor.<br/>
Ninety miles to the north is seen the bare <span style="color: #0000FF;">shoulder </span>of the Jemez peak, 12,000 feet high, rising<br/>
grandly from the vast forests of the Jemez<br/>
Reserve. Southward are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manzanos</span>, the<br/>
San Andres; the jagged pinnacles of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ladrones</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Robber Mountains; the San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mateos</span>, and the Magdalenas; and, melting into<br/>
the shimmering southern horizon, the summits<br/>
of the Organ Mountains, 200 miles toward<br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Two hundred feet beneath the University lies<br/>
the bustling, attractive city of Albuquerque,<br/>
with its 15,000 people. Beyond winds the Rio<br/>
Grande among its farms and gardens, its <span style="color: #0000FF;">meadows </span>and alfalfa <span style="color: #ff0000;">ficslds</span>, its tall poplars and<br/>
spreading <span style="color: #ff0000;">eottonwoods</span>. No more inspiring<br/>
prospect than that from these buildings could<br/>
be imagined.<br/>
<br/>
On festive occasions, long strings of the crimson chile peppers are <span style="color: #0000FF;">festooned </span>around the<br/>
college buildings, just <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the Indians hang them<br/>
to dry from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eaves </span>of their dwellings. Here<br/>
and there are gleaming yellow pumpkins and<br/>
bright-colored Navajo blankets, while at night<br/>
the students gather for merry-making around<br/>
huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">bonfires </span>that blaze in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">placita</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
