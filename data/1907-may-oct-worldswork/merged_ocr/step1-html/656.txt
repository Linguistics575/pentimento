Our boys and girls are correspondingly more<br/>
eager for the benefits of education, and they<br/>
use much energy to obtain them. The boys<br/>
work during the summer vacation in the vineyards, orchards, canneries, and stores, to earn<br/>
money for the next term at college. The girls<br/>
who go are usually supplied with funds by<br/>
their families, but nearly all the boys, even<br/>
those whose parents could afford it, earn their<br/>
own way. The formula of our fathers is, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>You<br/>
may'go' to college if you will-and we hope<br/>
you will; but if you have to be'sent' it <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>do<br/>
you no good." We do not yet insist on education for general culture, but when the getting<br/>
of it involves practical work and a display of<br/>
character, it is approved for those things alone.<br/>
<br/>
Most of our college-bred boys come back<br/>
home and apply their learning to home problems, and the girls, as elsewhere, teach school<br/>
or marry. They haven't many other <span style="color: #0000FF;">alternatives-except </span>to work in the stores or as clerks<br/>
in the courthouse, the latter being an occasional<br/>
variation of their usual course.<br/>
<br/>
In those days there was still a good deal of<br/>
the crudeness of the frontier in our administration of justice. One old Missourian, justice<br/>
of the peace, in a battery case, discovered that<br/>
the plaintiff <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>called the defendant a liar,<br/>
and that the insult had started the assault.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you admit calling the defendant a<br/>
liar?" demanded the old judge.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, sir," replied the plaintiff.<br/>
<br/>
"Complaint dismissed," growled his honor.<br/>
"Where I come from, to call a man a liar is to<br/>
strike the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>blow. Defendant struck in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">self-defense</span>."<br/>
<br/>
In another case the attorneys for opposing<br/>
clients had persisted in threats of personal<br/>
violence upon one another, in spite of warnings<br/>
from the judge. At length the court's patience<br/>
was exhausted by their windy mouthings, and<br/>
he called out <span style="color: #0000FF;">contemptuously </span>to the sheriff:<br/>
<br/>
"Bailiff, announce a recess of ten minutes<br/>
while these damned fools fight it out."<br/>
<br/>
There was no <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight</span>, and the case continued<br/>
in peace.<br/>
<br/>
Our grievances were even, sometimes, settled<br/>
in true frontier fashion with knife or "gun"<br/>
on the streets, but I realize now that these<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affrays </span>were no more frequent nor spectacular<br/>
than similar violence in New York City to-day.<br/>
They were not, however, always so severely<br/>
punished.<br/>
<br/>
But to-day we are more decorous in our court<br/>
procedure, especially in sessions of the United<br/>
<br/>
OUR TOWN <span style="color: #0000FF;">LTFE</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">WHAT </span>IS IT WORTH?<br/>
<br/>
States District Court, where the majesty of<br/>
Federal power is awesomely present. And<br/>
our sheriff chases his criminal prey now in an<br/>
automobile which enables him to spread posses<br/>
over the county at an amazing rate.<br/>
<br/>
In our city government we note a great<br/>
change. In those days, and for years after,<br/>
our city boss was a little Portuguese whose wife<br/>
taught him how to write his name after he had<br/>
been for some time a city trustee. Shrewd and<br/>
politic, he governed us to his own advantage<br/>
until we <span style="color: #0000FF;">gerrymandered </span>him out of office by<br/>
cutting up his district so that each of five<br/>
parts of it was added to another more reputable<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">district..<br/>
<br/>
</span>His downfall was part of a moral uprising<br/>
against frontier conditions in our town. We<br/>
had a large <span style="color: #ff0000;">floating </span>population that came in<br/>
summer to pick fruit and to work in the packing<br/>
houses and canneries, and many of them were<br/>
a rough sort who wanted plenty of saloons<br/>
and places to gamble in. Then we had our<br/>
own fast element, who could not be satisfied<br/>
by our pure wines that we pressed by the<br/>
million gallons, but must have green beer and<br/>
the worst of bad whisky, as if our summers<br/>
were not already hot enough to fry a man's<br/>
brains out. In consequence, we had about one<br/>
saloon for every <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>grown men of our<br/>
permanent population. Every saloon was also<br/>
a gambling place, where poker, faro, pedro,<br/>
keno, and the mechanical <span style="color: #ff0000;">nickel-in-the-slotmachine </span>card games were played to the accompaniment of piano or hand organ or music box<br/>
and boisterous laughter and coarse jokes and<br/>
loud cursing. Our downtown streets were not<br/>
pleasant for decent women. Our outlying<br/>
streets were not safe for any but armed men<br/>
after dark. Even our ancestral town function<br/>
of going to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">post-office </span>Sunday evenings at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>o'clock was marred by the presence of<br/>
drunken and rowdy men and boys fresh from<br/>
Sunday horse-races and ball games and open<br/>
saloons. The hold-up habit got to be too<br/>
popular, even in the plaza at night. Our city<br/>
officials were corrupt and connived at some of<br/>
the disorder, and were otherwise incompetent.<br/>
With open drinking, open gambling, Chinese<br/>
lotteries, and other vices, we were a "wide<br/>
open" town.<br/>
<br/>
Then the sober citizens who wanted to sleep<br/>
o' nights, to walk the streets when they chose,<br/>
without insult or assault, voted in a new city<br/>
charter, giving the town practically government<br/>
by commission, with almost complete authority<br/>
<br/>
