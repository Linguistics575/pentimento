dollar's worth of business with any "banking"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">firm </span>not well established and widely known, or<br/>
else a member of a reputable exchange<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Because<br/>
</span>these firms, even the worst of them, name as<br/>
their references good national banks in various<br/>
cities-in which banks they deposit small<br/>
accounts in order to be able to use the name--<span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>such references must be either ignored or<br/>
investigated personally and thoroughly. The<br/>
mere statement from such a bank, "Messrs.<br/>
So-and-So have an account with us" means<br/>
nothing at all, and is not a safeguard but a<br/>
pitfall.<br/>
<br/>
The real investor does not deal in wildcat mining shares or wild-cat shares of any sort.<br/>
Luckily the bond houses are barely touched<br/>
by the infection that has weakened the whole<br/>
structure of the stock-investment world in the<br/>
past decade or two. It is true that a few of<br/>
the big, solid houses have been made mere<br/>
depots for distributing fourth-rate and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fifthrate </span>bonds to the public in the interests of<br/>
two or three big railroads, but in general the<br/>
bond business as carried on in Wall Street is<br/>
still respectable. In a former article, THE<br/>
WORLD'S WORK paid special attention to the<br/>
circle of strong and clean houses that make<br/>
specialties of bonds of a narrow character<br/>
with a view to giving the buyer a large revenue<br/>
with good security, but a narrow market.<br/>
<br/>
Let us turn, for a moment, from the general<br/>
bond business to the buyer who represents an<br/>
estate, who desires perfect safety above all other<br/>
things, and who does not care so much about<br/>
large revenue. This magazine has received<br/>
in the past two months perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">half </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dozen<br/>
letters from investors deploring the fact that<br/>
such a buyer is exposed to insidious advice<br/>
from brokers and bankers in Wall Street, and<br/>
finds it hard to satisfy his mind that what he<br/>
buys is really as good as they say it is.<br/>
<br/>
In every such case, it has been the advice<br/>
of the magazine to limit the purchase to bonds<br/>
that are legal for New York savings banks, or<br/>
Massachusetts savings banks, except such<br/>
bonds as come in under the clause of the latter<br/>
law which makes legal certain street railway<br/>
bonds. That will be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">field</span>.<br/>
In one or two instances, notably the case of the<br/>
Chicago & Alton 3 per cent. bonds, there is a<br/>
suspicion that this law has been made <span style="color: #ff0000;">a-mere<br/>
</span>creature of financial jugglery, but even in this<br/>
instance no one doubts for an instant that the<br/>
bonds will be paid off at par when due, and<br/>
<br/>
SAFEGUARDS FOR INVESTORS<br/>
<br/>
will pay interest regularly in the meantime.<br/>
The law is strict, and it is generally impartial.<br/>
<br/>
It is not proposed here to publish a full list<br/>
of these bonds. Probably such a list would<br/>
be furnished by any bond house that does<br/>
business of this kind in large quantities. In<br/>
any event, the intending buyer can go to the<br/>
cashier or the president of his savings bank<br/>
and ask a few questions, or he can write to this<br/>
magazine at any time. A book is published<br/>
giving a full exposition of the New York law,<br/>
but it costs $ 15, and is subject to amendment<br/>
after each session of the New York legislature.<br/>
Another book, also at high cost, outlines all the<br/>
laws on this subject in all the states. Trustees<br/>
of large estates, private investors of big sums<br/>
of money, bankers, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>advisers of<br/>
business concerns that invest their surplus<br/>
should have these books, but the small investor<br/>
can obtain all the information that he needs<br/>
without them.<br/>
<br/>
The point of all this is the fact that the law<br/>
has established safeguards in many states that<br/>
will absolutely guard the investment of the<br/>
people, if the people will only be guided by the<br/>
law. The New York Stock Exchange has<br/>
thrown yet other bulwarks between the gold of<br/>
the people and the pirates of high and low<br/>
finance. The strongest of these guards is<br/>
publicity, a certain amount of which is required<br/>
before a stock can be listed on the Exchange.<br/>
Unhappily, the special interests were able<br/>
some years ago to get around this to some<br/>
extent by getting their stocks "listed in the<br/>
unlisted department" of the Stock Exchange,<br/>
which is a foolish thing that stamps the Exchange as not at all a <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfectly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reliable </span>guardian<br/>
of the public's welfare.<br/>
<br/>
On the whole, it will be seen that there is no<br/>
need for anyone to walk into danger if he use the<br/>
proper precaution. If a man will open accounts with firms that he does not know; if he<br/>
takes as gospel truth everything that he sees<br/>
in advertisements or press notices; if he will<br/>
invest in wild-cat stocks in spite of all advice<br/>
and warning; if he persists that he knows<br/>
more about investments than the savings-bank<br/>
committee of his state; if he follows "tips"<br/>
on faith alone-if he must do all or any one of<br/>
these things, he will continue to be the victim<br/>
of the "special speculators," of the sudden<br/>
bankruptcy, of the mere financial pirate, or of<br/>
the bond house whose stock in trade is a confidence game.<br/>
