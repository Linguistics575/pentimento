<br/>
cent. mortgage of the Colorado & Southern is<br/>
made in $ 100 pieces, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>because a large<br/>
part of it is placed in Switzerland and Germany<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>of bonds, because they are habitual buyers of<br/>
bonds, investing their monthly savings regularly<br/>
in this way. France, of course, is the most<br/>
notable country for this kind of buying. When<br/>
the Pennsylvania Company made a loan in<br/>
Paris, last year, it made the notes in blocks of<br/>
500 francs, about $ 96. These notes are listed in<br/>
Philadelphia, and savers of money in small lots<br/>
might get some of them; but they have only <span style="color: #0000FF;">M<br/>
</span>per cent. interest and are not very cheap.<br/>
<br/>
There is, in fact, a lamentable lack of such<br/>
bonds available for regular investment of small<br/>
sums of money. That is the main reason why<br/>
the average man throughout the country <span style="color: #0000FF;">does<br/>
</span>not know what a bond is, and thinks that only<br/>
the rich can own bonds. It is an impression<br/>
that has done more harm to the people and the<br/>
railroads than almost any other single factor<br/>
in the situation. The American is not personally interested in our great companies to<br/>
any extent. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very serious weakness, and<br/>
is recognized as such by all foreign critics of our<br/>
finance and by a few home critics.<br/>
<br/>
The result is that the very small investor is<br/>
left to be the prey of the sharper and the<br/>
swindler. Mining shares, wild <span style="color: #0000FF;">flotations </span>in<br/>
small industrial stocks, traps of all sorts are<br/>
almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">invariabiy </span>issued in lots of <span style="color: #0000FF;">81 </span>and up.<br/>
Some of them, in fact, are even smaller. They<br/>
are paraded as the only feasible means of<br/>
investing small sums. They blatantly advertise themselves as invented, projected, and<br/>
intended to provide the small saver of money<br/>
with a medium for investment. Thousands of<br/>
people are swindled every year for just this<br/>
reason. If a means were invented whereby<br/>
the great sound mass of investment securities<br/>
could be brought within the reach of the<br/>
people of small means, and the people could<br/>
be taught that they are within reach, millions of<br/>
dollars could be saved to the people each year.<br/>
<br/>
At present, there are several good companies<br/>
in this country making investments on just this<br/>
plan for the people. Nearly all of them are<br/>
real-estate companies. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Their </span>bonds take various forms. The only trouble about them is the<br/>
difficulty of selecting the good from the bad.<br/>
Probably more than half the companies that<br/>
now do this sort of business are not sound. A<br/>
small number of the concerns are perfectly<br/>
safe, sound, and conservative. Perhaps the<br/>

INVESTING MONEY BY SMALL INSTALMENTS<br/>
<br/>
most interesting feature of this group of <span style="color: #0000FF;">com<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">parties </span>is the way they have gone after the small<br/>
investor..<br/>
<br/>
Recently, the writer encountered an offer<br/>
made by one of these companies to sell a $ 1,000<br/>
bond, payable in ten years, at the rate of about<br/>
In other words, the investor<br/>
who can figure on having $ 71 per year to invest<br/>
can deposit it with that company, get a receipt<br/>
for it, and consider it safe. He does the same<br/>
thing <span style="color: #0000FF;">each</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>for ten years, making $ 710 in<br/>
all. After the last payment, he gets $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,000 </span>in<br/>
cash. It looks as though it were an offer to<br/>
give the investor something for nothing. In<br/>
reality, it is merely paying him compound<br/>
interest at nearly 6 per cent. per annum for<br/>
the use of his money, and is a desirable investment of its class. Variations of this plan of<br/>
investment will be found in great abundance<br/>
in the real-estate field.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, the growth of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">business </span>and the intelligent effort of the promoters<br/>
of other and less praiseworthy enterprises have<br/>
taken away from the held of railroad and strong<br/>
industrial investment in the past two years or<br/>
so. Unless the makers of railroad bonds and<br/>
their bankers realize this fact shortly, there<br/>
will be an increasing flood of money flowing<br/>
into the newer forms of bonds and a diminishing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>flowing to the big <span style="color: #ff0000;">er </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rporation </span>bonds and<br/>
notes. It is time that s <span style="color: #ff0000;">m1ething </span>were done to<br/>
offset the tendency of the retailers of other<br/>
bonds to sell them on the instalment plan to<br/>
the smaller investors of the country.<br/>
<br/>
There is no good reason why railroad bonds<br/>
should not be sold in the same way. The time<br/>
must come when either the railroads will split<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">bonds </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ioto </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">< </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.nall </span>lots, or the bankers who<br/>
sell them will sell on the instalment plan. A<br/>
man who saves $ 200 per annum, on an average,<br/>
should be able to buy a $ 500 bond in two years<br/>
and a half. In the meantime, the banker<br/>
should pay him interest on his instalments at<br/>
the rate of at least 4 per cent. The writer has<br/>
no doubt that within the next ten years a business of this kind will spring up among the great<br/>
banking houses of New York, and that it will<br/>
not only bring wealth and credit to the bankers<br/>
who carry it on but will also serve as the most<br/>
powerful incentive toward making the American<br/>
people a race of investors, as are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French</span>,<br/>
the Dutch, and the Swiss.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are objections, out most of<br/>
them are trivial. They have been surmounted<br/>
in other countries, and in the promotion of the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
