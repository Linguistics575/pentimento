the photographs with this article is that of fifty<br/>
farm wagons loaded with modern machinery<br/>
going out from Burlington-and this is but one<br/>
illustration of the rapidity with which improved<br/>
farming implements are coming into use<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Fifty years ago, moreover, the farmers of<br/>
the Upland South wasted the lands-tilled a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>recklessly for a few years, then cleared<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>"new ground" and abandoned the old to<br/>
broom-sage and gullies; but now this <span style="color: #ff0000;">landdebauchery </span>has ended. Crop rotation and<br/>
the legumes preserve the earth's fertility.<br/>
Every season a crop of land-enriching <span style="color: #ff0000;">COWpeas </span>may be sandwiched in between the<br/>
staple crops or cultivated in connection with<br/>
them. Farmers no longer scratch over 500<br/>
acres to make what intensive culture would<br/>
produce on <span style="color: #0000FF;">100</span>. "Don't go West to find a<br/>
new plantation," says a new eastern-Carolina<br/>
proverb; "plow deeper and you will find<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fa</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>a new one just below the old one you have<br/>

</span>Two stories from real life will illustrate<br/>
as well as anything else the whole story of<br/>
the state's farming progress.<br/>
