</span>their excellent moral character. Not only is<br/>
crime distinctly rare among them but they are<br/>
extraordinarily quiet, <span style="color: #0000FF;">good-natured</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellbehaved</span>. They are, as a rule, utterly above<br/>
petty thieving and may be trusted absolutely<br/>
with goods, valuables, or money, while in matters of business they have a high sense of honor.<br/>
The mere word of a Chinese merchant or trading-house is good for tens of thousands of <span style="color: #ff0000;">dollars</span>; your Chinese steward is absolutely straight<br/>
in his accounts; your <span style="color: #0000FF;">washerman </span>returns every<br/>
garment you sent out and seldom attempts to<br/>
overcharge; and housewives have found that<br/>
it is perfectly safe to pay the bill presented by<br/>
the Chinese market-gardener at the end of the<br/>
month (made up from a row of mysterious<br/>
scratches with charcoal on the canvas cover of<br/>
his wagon) without troubling to check it up.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese do not bear so high a <span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span>in this regard. The paper of <span style="color: #ff0000;">their </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">merchants </span>is not so good and they are frequently<br/>
accused of sharp practice in bargains or <span style="color: #0000FF;">contracts-but </span>since when have we been entitled<br/>
to hold up hands of holy horror at this sort of<br/>
thing? In the fine old <span style="color: #ff0000;">Johnsonese </span>phrase,<br/>
"the invidiousness of their offense <span style="color: #ff0000;">consisteth<br/>
</span>not in the singularity of it." Granting all <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>they have been accused of, they are nearly as<br/>
honest as the average white man; indeed, much<br/>
of the disfavor with which they are begining<br/>
to be regarded is due to the fact that they are<br/>
coming to meet us, if not to beat <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span>, at our own<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from these merely commercial or<br/>
mechanical virtues, both Japanese and Chinese<br/>
have an excellent personal reputation all up and<br/>
down the Coast. Not only are they <span style="color: #0000FF;">honest </span>and<br/>
industrious, but they are kindly, cheerful,<br/>
grateful for good treatment, devoted to the<br/>
children of the families in which they work,<br/>
faithful to their friends, kind to their families,<br/>
to one another, and to everyone in trouble.<br/>
They give liberally, not only to their own poor,<br/>
but to Christian missions and charities. "As<br/>
fat as a Chinaman's horse" has passed into a<br/>
proverb. The dislike of them is racial and<br/>
class, not personal. I was in San Francisco at<br/>
the time of the earthquake and noted the utter<br/>
absence of any personal ill-feeling toward the<br/>
Chinese on the part of the other refugees. White<br/>
men and Chinese squatted side by side in the<br/>
parks, stood in the same bread-line, and jostled<br/>
against each other as they toiled up the streets<br/>
away from the fire, loaded with bedding and<br/>
food, but there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">never </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>word nor a sign of<br/>
<br/>
AS A <span style="color: #0000FF;">WOR </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">KING </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MAN<br/>
<br/>
</span>other than cheery good fellowship and mutual<br/>
helpfulness.<br/>
<br/>
The terrors of the "Yellow Peril" exist<br/>
chiefly in the imaginations of walking delegates<br/>
and Congressmen. "Chinese cheap labor"<br/>
has not to date "ruined" any white man, for the<br/>
simple reason that it does not compete with him.<br/>
It fills a gap which no white man or woman on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacific </span>Coast is willing to fill, except temporarily under stress of circumstance. It is<br/>
not a question of wages. The fact of the matter is that we cannot get, at any price, more<br/>
than half the white labor that we need here now<br/>
to build and keep in repair our railroads, man<br/>
our mines, work our farms, pick our fruit, our<br/>
hops, our nuts, grow our vegetables, and do our<br/>
household work. A good general servant in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">California</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>instance, commands from $ 30 to<br/>
$ 40 a month, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">washing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>put out," and<br/>
few are to be had at that price.<br/>
<br/>
To speak of "Chinese cheap labor" provokes a smile on the Coast, for the Chinese<br/>
laborer gets at least as high a wage as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">white<br/>
</span>man of the same class, and usually a little higher<br/>
on account of his superior industry, honesty,<br/>
and trustworthiness. Chinese workingmen<br/>
earn from $ 2 to $ 4 a day in the orchards, the<br/>
mines, and the canneries, while a fair Chinese<br/>
servant gets $ 40 a month and board, and a good<br/>
cook or steward receives from $ 50 to $ 100.<br/>
One such cook, with a helper, will provide<br/>
meals in a lumber or mining camp for forty or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>men.<br/>
<br/>
Nor does the great mass of Japanese interfere with any class of white labor. Certain of<br/>
them are more enterprising and versatile, however, and are beginning to enter the lower grades<br/>
of skilled manual labor. Hence their <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpopularity </span>with the labor unions and the recent<br/>
agitation for their exclusion. The chief trouble<br/>
with the Japanese is that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little too much<br/>
like ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
The Oriental influence upon our social or<br/>
political life need give little concern, since both<br/>
races come here with the fixed intention of<br/>
returning to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Orient-the </span>Chinese after he<br/>
has made some money, the Japanese after he<br/>
has learned some particular thing. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">show<br/>
</span>not the slightest desire to intermarry with the<br/>
white race, even if this were permitted; they<br/>
take no more interest in politics or in any form<br/>
of social life outside of their own colonies and<br/>
tongs or guilds than so many horses.<br/>
<br/>
As to the nameless Oriental vices and dir.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>about which we hear so much, I <span style="color: #0000FF;">think<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
