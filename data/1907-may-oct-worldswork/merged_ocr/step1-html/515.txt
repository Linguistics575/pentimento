<span>WHAT IS A <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHOP-GIRL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span>LIFE? 9313<br/>
<br/>
always been claimed that a shamefully low<br/>
wage is paid her, and it is frequently intimated that the young and pretty shop-girl<br/>
need not, or is not expected, to live upon<br/>
her salary. That this shameful thing has<br/>
occurred, the writer has been assured by girls<br/>
to whom the alternative has been suggested.<br/>
But it does not now occur so frequently as<br/>
when the whole race of shop-girls was considered the natural prey of man. It is difficult<br/>
to get at the exact wages paid to shop-girls.<br/>
The managers and proprietors consider that<br/>
to be strictly their own affair, and intimate that<br/>
it is not that of the inquirer.<br/>
<br/>
From the girls themselves it is almost as<br/>
difficult to find out anything <span style="color: #0000FF;">definite </span>or reliable.<br/>
As far as could be learned from very extensive<br/>
inquiries, the salaries of these women range<br/>
from $ 5 to $ 20 a week, according to the position<br/>
occupied and the amount of responsibility<br/>
assumed. The average sales-woman, such as<br/>
stands behind the counter in the notion department, the ribbon department, stationery, <span style="color: #0000FF;">neckwear</span>, and hosiery departments, receives from<br/>
five to eight dollars a week, with seven dollars<br/>
as the average. In other departments, where<br/>
a greater amount of intelligence and a more<br/>
specialized knowledge of the stock is required,<br/>
the salary is higher, ranging in different stores<br/>
from seven to fifteen dollars a week, with ten<br/>
or twelve as the average. The usual wages of<br/>
cash-girls and bundle-wrappers is from two<br/>
and a half to five dollars a week.<br/>
<br/>
SAFEGUARDS <span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span>CHARACTER<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Exactly as in a household," said one department store manager, "the work goes better,<br/>
and the help attend better to their duties and<br/>
are more interested in their work when they<br/>
are living in healthful physical and moral<br/>
conditions. It is to our interest to surround<br/>
our young women with all the protection, both<br/>
physical and moral, that lies in our power.<br/>
And it has been our experience that the greater<br/>
proportion of them are earnest, serious-minded<br/>
girls, trying to earn their own living in an honest<br/>
and respectable manner, and ambitious to rise<br/>
in their business."<br/>
<br/>
In one of the oldest stores the women are<br/>
not allowed to leave in the evening through<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">employees</span>' entrance, because it leads out on<br/>
a dark street where there are usually a lot of<br/>
loafers hanging about, but are sent out by the<br/>
front door, so that they may come out upon a<br/>
street that is well lighted and protected.<br/>
<br/>
In a number of the better stores, detectives<br/>
are employed by the year for the sole purpose<br/>
of protecting the attractive young girls from<br/>
the machinations of "mashers" and young<br/>
men about town.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor-walker </span>offers a more difficult<br/>
problem. He is usually a man of good <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance </span>and pleasant manners. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">instances<br/>
</span>he is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">unprincipled </span>and designing, and<br/>
should his advances be repelled by a girl in<br/>
his department he has it in his power to ruin<br/>
her chances for advancement, even to make<br/>
her lose her position.<br/>
<br/>
To put a check on the floor-walker, and to<br/>
protect the girls in his department, two drygoods houses have made it a rule that any<br/>
employee may go straight to the head of the<br/>
firm with all her difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT THE GIRLS DO FOR THEMSELVES<br/>
<br/>
In nearly all the stores there are employees'<br/>
associations, <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>associations, and mutual<br/>
aid societies<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which by the investment of<br/>
trifling dues provide for sickness, death, and<br/>
burial. To some one of these nearly all the<br/>
girls belong, and the meetings of the societies<br/>
and the sociability provided by them proves<br/>
a pleasure as well as a benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Of late years a saving bank institution<br/>
has sent a representative to each of the<br/>
large stores on pay day, to receive what money<br/>
the girls can spare from their salaries, to save<br/>
for them. As banks do not open until long<br/>
after the shop-girl has gone to work, and as<br/>
they close long before she quits work, it is<br/>
practically impossible for her to take the money<br/>
to the banks. Their savings, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">many-indeed<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">most-cases </span>are so small that they would be<br/>
almost ashamed to deposit them, but when<br/>
the kind little old lady with the big brown bag<br/>
and the little account book arrives at the store,<br/>
the girls do not hesitate to give into her keeping<br/>
even a few pennies. These savings are slow<br/>
and precarious, but in time they count up and<br/>
sometimes enable a girl to take a little trip,<br/>
to take a few music lessons, or to get some<br/>
article of clothing that she could not otherwise<br/>
afford.<br/>
<br/>
In many of the stores the girls form little<br/>
reading circles and clubs. Their meetings<br/>
are usually held on Saturday evenings, at the<br/>
homes or rooms of the different members;<br/>
readings, music, and conversation form the<br/>
entertainment, and simple refreshments are<br/>
served.<br/>
