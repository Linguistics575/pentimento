</span>The adult Filipino could not hope for absolute self-government, but his children might.<br/>
So "Santo" Taft advised the Filipinos to<br/>
stop thinking about independence until there<br/>
were crowded schools in every <span style="color: #0000FF;">village</span>. The<br/>
Spanish had never promised more than two<br/>
teachers for every 5,000 people, and, as an<br/>
actual fact, the friars had given them but <span style="color: #0000FF;">one<br/>
</span>for that number. judge Taft brought <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>thousand <span style="color: #0000FF;">teachers </span>from the United States<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

result, four Filipinos out of five cannot vote;<br/>
but the four, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">well </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iifth</span>, are eagerly<br/>

<br/>
Judge Taft's trust in the natives went further<br/>
than letting them hold <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>. He organized<br/>
a native <span style="color: #0000FF;">constabulary</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflicercd </span>and tutored<br/>
by Americans, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">gave </span>them <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>share in <span style="color: #0000FF;">smothering </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrections</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Army men scoffed <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>

<br/>
</span>which meant one for each two villages to teach<br/>
the native teachers our graded system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">education</span>. The important item of the course was the<br/>
English language. Thousands of little <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fifi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pines </span>also wanted to learn English, and at<br/>
first there were not schools enough. But now<br/>
500,000 boys and girls speaking many <span style="color: #0000FF;">dialects<br/>
</span>are reading, writing, and reciting in English,<br/>
which is to be their first common language.<br/>
They are also becoming familiar with our <span style="color: #0000FF;">institutions </span>and thereby making one long step<br/>
toward popular government. Judge Taft made<br/>
<br/>
pointed to the Indian mutiny. But Judge<br/>
Taft knew how the conditions in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the-Philippines<br/>
</span>differed from those in India, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>persevered<br/>
in the face of prophetic warning. It was not a<br/>
great while until most of the American troops<br/>
were being ordered home; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">constabulary<br/>
</span>was able to keep the peace, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little help<br/>
now and <span style="color: #0000FF;">that</span>.<br/>

</span>Taft was obviously the man. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>was inaugurated on the Fourth of July, 1901, one year after<br/>
