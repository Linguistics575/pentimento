</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MACNEIL </span>STUDIO AT COLLEGE POINT, NEAR NEW YORK CITY<br/>
<br/>
It adjoins the MacNeil home and commands a fine view of the Sound<br/>
<br/>
public recognition has already come, it is something of a surprise to walk into his studio at<br/>
College Point-on Long Island, within sight of<br/>
New York <span style="color: #0000FF;">City-and </span>be greeted by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">boyishlooking </span>young man whose beard seems out of<br/>
place. He takes his work <span style="color: #0000FF;">seriously </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">while<br/>
</span>he is at <span style="color: #0000FF;">it-but </span>he does not take his <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished<br/>
</span>work so seriously as one might expect. If you<br/>
ask to <span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commemorative </span>medals which<br/>
he has won, you must wait until he has found<br/>
them and rubbed off some of the tarnish. His<br/>
studio (which is within <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>few feet of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span>)<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with sketches, figures, busts, and all<br/>
the paraphernalia of a sculptor, but the man<br/>
himself makes you feel that you are in a workshop, not in a sanctuary of art where <span style="color: #0000FF;">conversation </span>must be carried on in a language of<br/>
technicality. There is absolutely no "<span style="color: #0000FF;">pose</span>"<br/>
about him, and you may talk with him for an<br/>
hour without observing any trace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">affectation<br/>
</span>in manner or speech. That he is a dreamer<br/>
is evident-but evident only in his work. Very<br/>
slender, of medium height, he has a fine, compact head and large eyes that meet yours with<br/>
the suggestion of a twinkle. His name betrays<br/>
his Scottish origin but his personality is that<br/>
of the Latin races<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>As a <span style="color: #0000FF;">matter </span>of fact, Mr. MacNeil was born<br/>
in Massachusetts, at Prattville, and the first<br/>
part of his professional education was obtained<br/>
at a normal art school in that state. Later on<br/>
came more ambitious work in Paris, where he<br/>
won honors in the Julian School and in L'Ecole<br/>
des Beaux Arts. On his return from Paris,<br/>
he went immediately to the Northwest, where<br/>
he sojourned with the Indians while making<br/>
sketches for the four bronze reliefs that now<br/>
adorn the Marquette Building in Chicago.<br/>
These reliefs, symbolizing four dramatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">incidents </span>in the life of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pete </span>Marquette, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">explorer<br/>
</span>of the Mississippi River, were early <span style="color: #ff0000;">evidences<br/>
<br/>
</span>of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">genius</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Then came another long period of study.<br/>
While working in a Chicago studio and teach,<br/>
ing in the Institute of Art of that city, <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>came for a four years' course in Rome.<br/>
Before leaving Chicago, he was married to<br/>
Miss Carol Brooks, one of his former pupils.<br/>
During the four years, they studied together<br/>
under the same masters. Since his return, he<br/>
has been himself a teacher in the best of <span style="color: #0000FF;">American </span>art schools. He was one of the first<br/>
instructors in drawing and modeling at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cornell </span>University when Andrew D. White carried<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
