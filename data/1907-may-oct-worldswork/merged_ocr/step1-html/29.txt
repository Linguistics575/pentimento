<span>SAN FRANCISCO'S MORAL BREAKDOWN<br/>
<br/>
the existence of abuses whose correction in<br/>
other states is left to the statutes.<br/>
<br/>
The provisions for the exclusion of trusts<br/>
and monopolies and for the regulation of<br/>
railroads are <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>severe. Any railroad<br/>
that shall desire to exercise the right of eminent<br/>
domain in Oklahoma must be chartered under<br/>
the laws of the state. These laws, the framers<br/>
expect, will be sufficient to prevent any injustice<br/>
in the exercise of the right. Railroads shall be<br/>
prohibited from owning coal lands, and all<br/>
railroads shall be under the supervision of an<br/>
elective state railroad commission. No passenger fare of more than two cents a mile<br/>
shall be charged. This, mind you, is a part of<br/>
the constitution.<br/>
<br/>
Other advanced political theories are embodied in the instrument. One of <span style="color: #ff0000;">thescy</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>a<br/>
clause for prohibition that prohibits not only<br/>
the sale of the liquor but its importation into<br/>
the state. The constitution provides that the<br/>
Indian Territory shall have prohibition for<br/>
twenty-one years, but a separate section provides for prohibition for the whole state. This<br/>
section will be yoted upon separately from the<br/>
constitution, and requires only a majority for<br/>
passage. The principle of the initiative and<br/>
referendum is adopted. Elective officers are<br/>
forbidden to succeed themselves-this being<br/>
an attempt to prevent "ring" leadership in<br/>
politics.<br/>
<br/>
But the greatest distinction of the new constitution is its elaborate regulation of corporations.<br/>
Another distinction is its length: it is by far<br/>
the longest of state constitutions. A third<br/>
distinction is, that this is probably the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>state constitution drafted by a convention in<br/>
which an Indian tribe had a legal vote and a<br/>
considerable influence. The Osage Nation<br/>
had two votes of the total of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1127 </span>and Indian<br/>
influence is, quaintly enough, mainly responsible for the prohibition clauses in the new<br/>
constitution. The new state is, of course,<br/>
overwhelmingly Democratic.<br/>

SAN FRANCISCO'S MORAL BREAKDOWN<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>people of San Francisco have suffered<br/>
overmuch. But the earthquake and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>are not the greatest of their calamities.<br/>
Their worst misfortune became public a year<br/>
later in amazing revelations of the sordid greed<br/>
that seemed to permeate almost every class of<br/>
men after the ruin of April, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1906</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>A venal city government, the tool of a corrupt<br/>
and corrupting citv boss, sold the public<br/>
<br/>
8827<br/>
<br/>
privileges of the city for ridiculous prices upon<br/>
payment to the supervisors of graft <span style="color: #0000FF;">fees </span>ranging<br/>
from $ 500 to $ 15,000 a vote. The street railway company bought the privilege of running<br/>
an overhead trolley line from "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abe</span>" Ruef,<br/>
the chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">grafter</span>, instead of buying it from the<br/>
city for what it was worth. The telephone<br/>
monopoly intrenched itself by similar means.<br/>
Citizens otherwise reputable chased smaller<br/>
private <span style="color: #0000FF;">ends </span>through the same paths of graft.<br/>
In all, something more than a million dollars<br/>
seem to have been collected into Ruef's corruption fund, and much of it stuck to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">fingers</span>.<br/>
Enough passed on, however, to purchase the<br/>
desired favors from the city powers.<br/>
<br/>
San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">used </span>to the kind of graft<br/>
disclosed in the earlier part of the investigation.<br/>
The purchase of immunity by vice had been<br/>
known for years, and was common to many<br/>
cities. But the graft in high places, the spread<br/>
of the taint to <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>good people" and the enormous<br/>
bulk of the corrupting influences raise San<br/>
Francisco to a solitary eminence of shame.<br/>
<br/>
There is an explanation of this moral breakdown at the very point that should have been<br/>
the last to weaken. For two generations the<br/>
city had boasted of its license, of its "<span style="color: #ff0000;">wideopenness</span>," of its Parisian flavor. It had taken<br/>
a silly pride in being "different," regardless<br/>
of the moral quality of the difference. This<br/>
boast and this pride have been the weak vice<br/>
of even the so-called "better <span style="color: #0000FF;">classes</span>" in San<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco</span>. Now the city is reaping the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harvest<br/>
</span>of that moral <span style="color: #0000FF;">let-down </span>in a whirlwind of<br/>
corruption.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that the graft has been accepted<br/>
by labor politicians is not especially significant.<br/>
The significant fact is that the graft was offered<br/>
by men of every political complexion and <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>by some of those highest in the city's<br/>
business life. In brief, the city was full of<br/>
rottenness, and needed only this supreme opportunity to make the disgraceful disclosure of it.<br/>
<br/>
But, after all, is it San Francisco only? The<br/>
disorganization and confusion of the city, the<br/>
unparalleled property loss, entailing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete<br/>
</span>readjustment of the ownership and value of<br/>
property rights, made of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>to<br/>
graft the most enormous temptation of its kind<br/>
in our time. That the temptation found such<br/>
willing victims is deplorable. But the mood<br/>
of other cities that would criticize <span style="color: #0000FF;">San </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ty<br/>
</span>should be a mood of self-searching, to make<br/>
sure that they are not more righteous only<br/>
because their temptation is less<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
