<span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">6-FOOT </span>SEWER IN NEW ORLEANS<br/>
<br/>
The city <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>spending more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">818,000,000 </span>on its water and<br/>
sewerage and drainage works. By drainage, the water-line has <span style="color: #0000FF;">been<br/>
</span>sunk <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>4 or 5 feet beneath the surface to 15 or <span style="color: #ff0000;">18 </span>feet, and<br/>
the white death-rate reduced to an extraordinarily healthful degree<br/>

<br/>
A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
has been the result. In fact, the best index<br/>
of all this great <span style="color: #0000FF;">change </span>which makes for the<br/>
growth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency </span>is cooperation-a spirit<br/>
of working together. In the old time, under<br/>
the old influences, every plantation was a<br/>
sort of principality in itself. Every unit of<br/>
working life cultivated "independence," which<br/>
was another name for isolation. This tendency run throughout the old Southern<br/>
methods. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Every </span>college was independent of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span>other one. So, too, every railroad; every<br/>
religious sect; every industry. Work and<br/>
thought were <span style="color: #0000FF;">unorganized</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cooperation-there </span>was no such thing.<br/>
<br/>
If I were asked to name the most significant<br/>
recent change in Southern life, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>should say<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>it is the coming of cooperation, the unifying<br/>
of forces, of energies, of interests, the coming<br/>
together of the workers in every department of<br/>
activity, the pulling <span style="color: #0000FF;">together</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>a word, the<br/>
organization of life. The saving thus made<br/>
of social and industrial energy would have<br/>
brought a new spirit, to say nothing of positive<br/>
gains. The people have thus just begun to find<br/>
themselves, and to know their own capacities.<br/>
The old "independence" which, in its extreme<br/>
development, made every man his own judge<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span>ANTE-FEVER AND POST-FEVER <span style="color: #ff0000;">CISTERNS<br/>
<br/>
</span>Before the discovery that the mosquito transmits yellow fever, unclosed cisterns (like the one on the left) bred <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosquitoes </span>adjacent to bedroom <span style="color: #ff0000;">Windows</span>. Now <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">clo.sed</span>, as shown by the one on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
