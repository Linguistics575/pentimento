<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9166 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MARCH<br/>
</span>tion companies in the State of New York.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>two commissions took over the authority<br/>
and the duties vested for years in the Rapid<br/>
Transit Commission, the State Railroad Commission, the Gas and Electricity Commission,<br/>
and the State Inspectors of Water Meters, and<br/>
various new duties besides imposed under<br/>
the act which brought these new commissions<br/>
into being.<br/>
<br/>
No man can say in advance whether they<br/>
can successfully do the thousand tasks that<br/>
must arise in a state as big and populous as<br/>
New York. Of course, similar commissions<br/>
have done well in other states, and even <span style="color: #0000FF;">more<br/>
</span>strikingly in other countries-but New York is<br/>
New York, and no other place. Besides, the<br/>
powers of these commissions are more sweeping than the powers, we believe, given to<br/>
similar bodies in any other state.<br/>
<br/>
It is within the power of the commissioners<br/>
to control the making of railroad rates, the provision of adequate car-supply, both on railroads<br/>
and street-railways, the distribution of cars to<br/>
shippers, the giving of free or reduced-rate<br/>
transportation, the issue of stocks and bonds,<br/>
the purchase or lease of one corporation by<br/>
another, the issue and capitalization of <span style="color: #0000FF;">franchises</span>, and the consolidation, in any form<br/>
whatever, of companies that come under the<br/>
Public Utilities Act. Telephone and telegraph<br/>
companies alone are excepted from the authority and control of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>commissioners.<br/>
<br/>
The men in whom are vested these remarkable powers are not widely known men. Mr.<br/>
William R. Willcox, the Chairman of the New<br/>
York City Commission, has gained an honorable public reputation as postmaster of<br/>
New York City. Mr. Frank W. Stevens, the<br/>
chairman of the State Commission, is little<br/>
known in public life, and is known not at all<br/>
to the political world. In fact, the members<br/>
of the commissions, chosen directly by Governor Hughes, are singularly free from <span style="color: #0000FF;">political<br/>
</span>trammels. The whole body is strictly nonpolitical. Of the ten members, but one, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr.<br/>
<br/>
</span>James E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sague</span>, is a practical railroad<br/>
man. There is not a traction expert, a gas<br/>
expert, nor an engineer on the board. The<br/>
Governor appears to have gone on the safe<br/>
assumption that, if he selected honest and<br/>
faithful commissioners, they could hire all<br/>
necessary expert advice. The public at large<br/>
will probably agree with Governor Hughes<br/>
that the first requisites are honesty and willingness to work overtime.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">MARCH </span>OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
For the task is one that will require the most<br/>
painstaking labor. There will be no holidays<br/>
for these commissions, and their way will be<br/>
beset with many pitfalls. Already one branch<br/>
of the newspaper press is calling upon them<br/>
immediately to undertake a prosecution of<br/>
certain capitalists. Criticism will be the<br/>
daily fare of the commissioners. It is well<br/>
that so many of them are lawyers, for it will<br/>
require the nicest discrimination and the most<br/>
imperturbable composure to choose the right<br/>
path in the control of the administration of<br/>
these great companies, particularly of those<br/>
in New York City.<br/>
<br/>
So long as Mr. Hughes is Governor, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">policies</span>, the initiative and the results of these commissions will be based upon the nicest legal<br/>
judgment, the fairest interpretation of the<br/>
laws, and the same spirit of courageous fair<br/>
play that <span style="color: #0000FF;">prorated </span>his veto of the two-cent<br/>
bill in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>of the country-wide agitation<br/>
against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">railroads </span>and the hysteria of a<br/>
large, if not particularly influential, part of<br/>
the press. <span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>this law is the great personal<br/>
triumph of the Governor-his contribution to<br/>
the most pressing and most vexing problem<br/>
of our time. And, if it work well under his<br/>
guidance, it will have made a long start toward<br/>
permanence<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>VAST SUMS TO <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">FIELDS-AN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">D </span>THE RESULT<br/>
<br/>
RANCE and England are two of the<br/>
richest nations in the world. New York<br/>
is one of the richest cities in the world.<br/>
Yet in the last week in June, British'consols<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>rentes, which are the representative<br/>
bonds of those two nations, fell to the lowest<br/>
prices in years. And in the same week the<br/>
City of New York offered for sale nearly thirty<br/>
million dollars of its four per cent. stock and<br/>
received bids for only two and a half millions.<br/>
In other words, this city is unable, at this time,<br/>
to sell its stocks even at a price the lowest in<br/>
its history<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>What is the meaning of these events? <span style="color: #ff0000;">No<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lone </span>believes that the English nation, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">peace<br/>
</span>with all the world and at the very crest of its<br/>
commercial greatness, is weaker to-day than<br/>
it was, for instance, in the second year of the<br/>
Boer War. Nor can any man say that <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rance<br/>
</span>is weakening, although it may be noted that<br/>
the income tax, recently laid, has struck a blow<br/>
at the popular habit of investing in the national<br/>
bonds. Certainly no New Yorker is willing<br/>
to admit that the bonds or stocks of the city <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
