<span>THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
I sought him out about 3 P. M. and found<br/>
him mellow, as usual. I asked him about the<br/>
road in question.<br/>
<br/>
"Never heard of <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>he said.<br/>
<br/>
"You have been elected to its presidency,<br/>
Colonel!"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh-well, that must be the road that<br/>
General F was talking to me about one day<br/>
last month. He wanted me to go into it.<br/>
I've got a deed for two thousand acres-say,<br/>
what do you want this for?"<br/>
<br/>
"Only for publication!" said I.<br/>
<br/>
The story came to a rather abrupt conclusion.<br/>
The railroad is included in the list of "projects" published in March with a quotation<br/>
from the president to the effect that "<span style="color: #0000FF;">titles<br/>
</span>have been secured and work will begin as soon<br/>
as necessary legal formalities are complied<br/>
with." It would be interesting to know who<br/>
now has that deed for <span style="color: #ff0000;">2/ooo </span>acres.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, sifting the lists of projected<br/>
railroads thoroughly, it appears that there are<br/>
at least 5,000 miles of railroad actually about<br/>
to be built in the South and the Southwest.<br/>
Perhaps that <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>is low, rather than high.<br/>
It is well to make it so, because, unless all signs<br/>
fail, the tendencies now at work in the South<br/>
will lead to the curtailment of all building that<br/>
is not already well under way or that is not<br/>
too far advanced in its financing to allow<br/>
turning back.<br/>
<br/>
Alabama may be cited to illustrate the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tendency</span>. This state has for many years called<br/>
madly to the capitalists to come and build railroads for its development. It has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">retarded </span>by the failure of capital to respond in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>volume. In this current year, Alabama has provided sufficient justification for<br/>
this tardiness of capital by undertaking to<br/>
penalize heavily the capital already invested<br/>
in the state. The writer can name two railroads, projected to serve local communities<br/>
in Alabama, that have been permanently<br/>
abandoned by their projectors within the past<br/>
three months on account of the attitude of the<br/>
legislators toward foreign capital.<br/>
<br/>
Consider, for instance, the bill to create a<br/>
new railroad commission for Alabama. Under<br/>
the provisions of this bill, the commission is to<br/>
consist of a president and two other members<br/>
elected by the people. The salary of the president is to be $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">3,500 </span>and of the other members<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">33,000</span>. One clerk is allowed at $ 2,400, and<br/>
one stenographer at $ 1,200. The commission<br/>
is also allowed to employ "experts," but can<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8955<br/>
<br/>
not spend more than $ 2,500 per annum for<br/>
such service. This commission, so armed, is<br/>
to be authorized to take supervision over all<br/>
intra-state steam railroad business. As a<br/>
matter of fact, into the hands of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">commis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>sion is given the power to destroy or to assist<br/>
the railroads doing business in Alabama.<br/>
<br/>
Think of a commission, elected by political<br/>
methods, whose members are paid salaries<br/>
no greater than the salary of a good metropolitan newspaper reporter, entrusted with a duty<br/>
of this character! Think, too, of that $ 2,500<br/>
allowed for "expert" assistance! How far<br/>
would it go? What kind of a judgment as to<br/>
"reasonableness and justice" could be reached<br/>
in the hundreds of cases that must of necessity<br/>
come before this commission?<br/>
<br/>
Alabama did not stop with the creation of<br/>
this commission. It passed a two-cent passenger fare bill, and an act to establish <span style="color: #0000FF;">maximum </span>rates on freight and a classification<br/>
which will ultimately, if allowed, reduce very<br/>
materially the freight revenues of every railroad<br/>
operating in the state. It also provided for<br/>
the revocation of the charter of any foreign<br/>
railroad that shall attempt to remove from the<br/>
Alabama courts any legal procedure directed<br/>
against the rates provided by the railroad<br/>
commission of the state.<br/>
<br/>
It would be tiresome to take up in detail the<br/>
legislation directed against the railroads in<br/>
North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee,<br/>
and other Southern states. It is all of a character to satisfy the demands of the people Who<br/>
elected the legislators, and much of it is designed at the same time to destroy a large part<br/>
of the earning capacity of capital invested in<br/>
those states within the past twenty years.<br/>
Such as is most <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ggrantly </span>in violation of the<br/>
rights of property will be set aside by the<br/>
Supreme Courts, but the net result of the steps<br/>
necessary to this end will be that the public<br/>
hostility toward the railroads will be increased<br/>
by the bitterness growing out of suits fought<br/>
by the railroads against the states.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, at the very time when, of all times,<br/>
there is the most urgent need of cooperation<br/>
between the Southern States and the railroads<br/>
of the South, it appears a foregone conclusion<br/>
that the two are drawing apart and becoming<br/>
out-and-out antagonists. The Southern Railway is at this moment straining every nerve to<br/>
convince the people of the North and the people<br/>
of Europe that the South is worthy of their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence</span>. That railroad absolutely needs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
