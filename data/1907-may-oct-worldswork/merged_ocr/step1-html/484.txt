</span>a world over which no one race can rule in our<br/>
stage of civilization, now long past the tribal<br/>
organization. And this must be done without<br/>
causing national decay. Yet it was out of<br/>
mere tribal organization that national strength<br/>
and race-strength originally came.<br/>
<br/>
WORK FOR EVERYBODY<br/>
<br/>
HE Bureau of Labor (at Washington)<br/>
<br/>
has made a systematic inquiry about the<br/>
<br/>
demand for workers in every part of the United<br/>
<br/>
States, and one of its officers has given out this<br/>
statement:<br/>
<br/>
"No man in this country, able and willing to work, has<br/>
any excuse for idleness. There is demand from practically<br/>
every state for labor, both skilled and unskilled. The<br/>
governors or other officials are calling on us to send them<br/>
men and women who want work, and giving assurances<br/>
that the work will be provided. The factories and farms,<br/>
the mines and mills, all join in the chorus of demand<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>while<br/>
from everywhere comes the note <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>insistence that more<br/>
domestic servants be provided."<br/>
<br/>
The most insistent demand is for farm laborers, because theirs is among the least remunerative of all work done by men. So great has<br/>
become this demand that, in many sections of<br/>
the country, farms have been wholly or in part<br/>
abandoned and can be bought at very low<br/>
prices.<br/>
England, but something of the same condition<br/>
is coming in other parts of the Union also.<br/>
The Southern States are among the most insistent for farm laborers, Louisiana offering, for<br/>
example, free houses and free fuel (bills for<br/>
fuel there are at most not <span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>). A man<br/>
who can and will work a farm can get land at a<br/>
profitably low price in most of the Southern<br/>
States. In fact, a man who can work the land<br/>
well, may anywhere become independent.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanics-skilled labor of almost every<br/>
kind-are needed in most parts of the country,<br/>
except in the large cities, to which, of course,<br/>
they <span style="color: #ff0000;">dock </span>in the greatest numbers because<br/>
wages there are highest.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in every city there are swarms of people<br/>
who, if they do not lack employment, lack productive and lucrative work. Men and women<br/>
(and sometimes children) by the hundreds of<br/>
thousands are at work in sweat-shops and in<br/>
hopelessly uneconomic pursuits who, if they<br/>
would work the soil with intelligence or would<br/>
learn skilled trades, could become independent,<br/>
to their own betterment and to the betterment<br/>
of the whole community and especially to the<br/>
betterment of their offspring.<br/>

<br/>
</span>OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
THE CHEAPNESS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>LIFE<br/>
<br/>
IN MANY parts of the United States, in<br/>
<br/>
the Southern States in particular, the<br/>
"unwritten law" is stronger than the law<br/>
against murder. There have recently been<br/>
two cases in Virginia. The kinsmen of<br/>
wronged women have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">acquittal </span>for killing<br/>
their betrayers. In one case there was no<br/>
evidence of crime done by the man that was<br/>
killed except the unsupported word of the<br/>
woman. Since the acquittal of the murderer,<br/>
women in that community have begun a <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement </span>to erect a monument to the young man<br/>
who was murdered, this being their way of<br/>
expressing their belief <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>his innocence. Again,<br/>
in Mississippi, Governor Vardaman pardoned<br/>
a woman who had been convicted of killing<br/>
a man who had done her wrong and told about<br/>
it when he was drunk. This was a sort of<br/>
extension of the "unwritten law" in a curious<br/>
way. It was as much as to say that if a man<br/>
may with impunity kill another man who has<br/>
wronged a woman, a woman herself may kill<br/>
a man who commits crime with her and reveals it.<br/>
<br/>
It requires no argument to show that the<br/>
"unwritten law" is only one evidence of the<br/>
cheapness with which life is held, just as<br/>
execution by a mob is another evidence of the<br/>
same thing. If a man may kill another on<br/>
the unsupported evidence of a woman and be<br/>
sure of acquittal, we pass at once beyond the<br/>
reign of law and come into a social order where<br/>
private vengeance has sway.<br/>
<br/>
There are other evidences of a different sort<br/>
of the cheapness with which we hold human life.<br/>
There was an accident a little while ago in the<br/>
Pennsylvania tunnel under New York City, and<br/>
a man was <span style="color: #0000FF;">killed</span>. There are many accidents<br/>
in these tunnels and there is a long list of<br/>
victims. In this case the man killed "was<br/>
known only <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'Tony</span>.' His number was 857.<br/>
Nothing was known of his address, his relatives,<br/>
or his <span style="color: #0000FF;">friends</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The death of'Tony'<br/>
was reported to the coroner's office and his body<br/>
was sent to the morgue." The foreman was<br/>
arrested. But in this case, as in practically all<br/>
other such "accidents," nobody is punished.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in many such cases where men<br/>
are doing hazardous work they lose their lives<br/>
by their own carelessness. But in many more<br/>
instances, the accidents result from the carelessness of somebody else. Yet, however stringent<br/>
the laws, they are seldom enforced. Incidents of<br/>
this sort show again how cheap human life <span style="color: #0000FF;">is-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
