</span>ADVENTURES OF DARING<br/>
<br/>
pigheaded little rascals, they are about the<br/>
most irritating-especially since one must<br/>
respect their innumerable good points and<br/>
keep his hands off.<br/>
<br/>
"After getting my outfit in order I hastened<br/>
to the Adirondacks. I found a locality where<br/>
'porkies' were abundant.. One of the subjects<br/>
which had to be illustrated was an abandoned<br/>
camp in winter, with the'Porky' eating pork<br/>
rind. This does not sound hard but it was<br/>
well into May and nearly all the snow<br/>
had melted. However, after a careful search,<br/>
I found one patch of about half an <span style="color: #0000FF;">acre </span>of<br/>
snow in a sheltered nook; here 1 arranged a<br/>
camp scene. That night the guide and I<br/>
caught a porcupine and put him in a barrel<br/>
until morning.<br/>
<br/>
"In the meantime, I was taken sick and it<br/>
was all that I could do to walk to the snow<br/>
patch; but the picture had to be made that day<br/>
or not at all, as the snow was rapidly melting.<br/>
Bracing myself up, I arranged the camera, the<br/>
guide released the'porky' and tried to steer<br/>
him to the selected spot. Naturally enough,<br/>
that was the one place to which the'Porky'<br/>
positively refused to go. Things were not<br/>
going well with me and I stood in a dazed<br/>
condition holding to a tree and realizing<br/>
that it was only a matter of minutes before I<br/>
would faint. The snow took strange <span style="color: #0000FF;">shapes-big </span>black and red spots danced over it, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>

</span>the far distance I could <span style="color: #ff0000;">indistinetly </span>hear the<br/>
man swearing at the porcupine. Gradually<br/>
the spots grew larger and closer together;<br/>
between them I got occasional glimpses of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'porky</span>' as he moved slowly toward the selected<br/>
spot on which the camera was focused. Would<br/>
he get there before I lost consciousness? It<br/>
was certainly a queer race, but fortune was<br/>
kind. My last conscious act was that of<br/>
pressing the bulb as I dropped on the snow.<br/>
