</span>agitating the whole civilized world. Scandinavia has hit upon a rational solution. A<br/>
Swedish association, "Art for the Schools,"<br/>
not content with decorating schoolrooms with<br/>
what Mr. H. G. Wells calls "canned art"<span style="color: #0000FF;">-casts </span>and photographs-has set about covering<br/>
the walls of secondary schools with mural<br/>
paintings by the best artists in Sweden. They<br/>
do not choose improving subjects, but those<br/>
easily within the children's ken. The largest<br/>
school in Stockholm boasts a great wall<br/>
decoration by Carl Larsson-a school excursion<br/>
in which the figures of the rector, several of<br/>
the teachers, and a number of the actual pupils<br/>
of that particular school are done from life.<br/>
For a Gothenburg school, the same artist has<br/>
painted a procession of flower-laden children<br/>
on their way to decorate the schoolhouse for<br/>
the midsummer festival. After this fashion<br/>
they bring painting into the child's own world.<br/>
Prince Eugen (himself <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>painter of ability)<br/>
and Andreas Zorn are both warmly interested<br/>
in the movement and have more than once<br/>
donated the proceeds of their annual exhibitions<br/>
to the cause. Here is a plain hint for us.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, in Scandinavia a dozen societies<br/>
have attacked that stronghold of bad <span style="color: #ff0000;">tastepopular </span>fancywork. What has been done in<br/>
Old Deerfield, Mass., and a few other isolated<br/>
places in America, is done by wholesale among<br/>
the peasants of Norway and Sweden. It is a<br/>
two-edged campaign. Toward city folk it<br/>
exercises the functions of an Arts-and-Crafts<br/>
Guild, inculcating a love of what is good and<br/>
native rather than for what is <span style="color: #0000FF;">meretricious </span>or<br/>
foreign. Toward the peasants, the work takes<br/>
on an economic aspect and the Government<br/>
lends a hand. Old hand-industries are revived,<br/>
fine old Scandinavian designs are collected and<br/>
scattered free among peasant craftsmen;<br/>
tapestry weaving, wood and metal work in the<br/>
splendid dragon style of the vikings are freely<br/>
taught to countryfolk, who are encouraged to<br/>
make soft vegetable dyes after ancient recipes.<br/>
Salesrooms in town dispose of the artistic<br/>
peasant work. It means death to the Gibson<br/>
pillow, or whatever takes the place of such<br/>
atrocities in Scandinavia.<br/>
<br/>
Some people think that the American publicschool child gets too much for nothing. But,<br/>
on the theory that the citizens are the State<br/>
and have a common right to the public things,<br/>
Sweden dowers the school children more liberally than we, sure that what makes for the<br/>
welfare of the youngsters makes for the future<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT </span>SCANDINAVIA CAN <span style="color: #ff0000;">TEACH </span>US<br/>
<br/>
welfare of Sweden. There are more free baths,<br/>
free dinners, free school books, free doctors,<br/>
free dentists, and free oculists. And they are<br/>
not abused.<br/>
<br/>
Swedish school excursions are no mere <span style="color: #ff0000;">daytrips</span>. They extend over a fortnight and the<br/>
children are sometimes carried over the line<br/>
into Denmark or Norway. City children<br/>
learn of rural industries, and country children<br/>
learn of city mysteries, at firsthand. When<br/>
there is an exposition, these excursions assume<br/>
mammoth proportions. Fourteen hundred country children were personally conducted about<br/>
the Stockholm Exhibition of 1897 and more<br/>
than <span style="color: #0000FF;">3,000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>went free to Helsingborg<br/>
in 1903. Sweden believes that it pays.<br/>
<br/>
They believe in the pupils' lending libraries,<br/>
placed in almost every school in Sweden by a<br/>
benevolent conspiracy between publishers (who<br/>
remit half the cost of each volume), school<br/>
boards, and a society called Common School<br/>
Friends.<br/>
<br/>
Small wonder that Sweden is progressive,<br/>
for the germs of progress are carefully planted<br/>
in little Swedes before they are out of their<br/>
'teens. No chance for them to grow up <span style="color: #ff0000;">narrowminded</span>, accepting the antiquated notions of<br/>
their fathers. As soon as they are old enough<br/>
to understand, the school children have the<br/>
most advanced theories of so-called Social<br/>
Science presented to them in simplified form.<br/>
The labor problem, defects in local legislation,<br/>
the legal position of Swedish women and the<br/>
history of the woman movement, problems of<br/>
settlement work, poor-relief, housing, <span style="color: #ff0000;">co6perative </span>house <span style="color: #0000FF;">building-thee </span>things are set <span style="color: #ff0000;">before </span>every Swede before he has time to fossilize.<br/>
Therefore, the crust of conservatism is very<br/>
thin in Sweden. Would it come amiss if we<br/>
preached civic duty and the crime of political<br/>
fatalism before the young people of our high<br/>
schools?<br/>
<br/>
REACTION TOWARD COUNTRY LIFE<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the supreme social achievement of<br/>
Scandinavia is the glorification of the pastoral<br/>
life. There is actually a strong tide setting<br/>
from the slums to the farms. The movement<br/>
is at its height in Denmark. It is not due to<br/>
any colonization schemes or other artificial<br/>
devices. The Government and the cities turned<br/>
to help the countryfolk; and the countryfolk<br/>
responded by displaying an undreamed-of<br/>
ability to help themselves. In America, somehow, many good things skip the country. Public<br/>
