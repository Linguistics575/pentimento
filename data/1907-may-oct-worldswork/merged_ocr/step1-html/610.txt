womanhood who shields with one arm the<br/>
child Peace. <span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>figures greatly enhance<br/>

<br/>
THE DIVERSITY OF HIS WORK<br/>
<br/>
The McKinley statue is the first masterpiece<br/>
of this kind that Mr. MacNeil has produced.<br/>
His best-known <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>are his Indians, but<br/>
his creations <span style="color: #0000FF;">cover </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wide range of <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects-from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large and very high relief <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Out </span>of<br/>
Chaos Comes the Dawn") designed for the<br/>
entrance to a mausoleum, to a tiny dancing<br/>
figure fitly named "The Zephyr"; from a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chimney-cap </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the artists' own studio, to the<br/>
fountain at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition;<br/>
from a soldiers' memorial in the street of a<br/>
Massachusetts village, to the busts of university professors and regents. At this time he is<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
"THE MOQUI RUNNER"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span>Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Made</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>engaged upon an important work intended to<br/>
fill a large wall-space in the State House at<br/>
Hartford, Conn. In this the late Senator<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">O. </span>H. Platt is represented in high relief in a<br/>
medallion surrounded by symbolic figures and<br/>
inscriptions-the whole to be cast in bronze.<br/>
<br/>
While his work shows this variety in subject<br/>
and in treatment, one quality runs through it<br/>
all: whatever he touches is, in its very essence,<br/>
American; it smacks of the soil. Foreign<br/>
training and intimate acquaintance with the<br/>
best the past has to offer have left him unaffected in this respect. His strongly artistic<br/>
nature has this quality for the same reason that<br/>
the poet remembers his youth. It was <span style="color: #0000FF;">shown<br/>
