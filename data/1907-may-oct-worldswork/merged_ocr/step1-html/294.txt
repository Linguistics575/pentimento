Real Estate Company," advanced $ 40 to a small<br/>
sweat-shop owner of the East Side, taking as<br/>
security a chattel mortgage of $ 48 for ten<br/>
weeks upon his furniture. Three hundred pairs<br/>
of trousers were turned out of his shop each<br/>
week, for which the sweat-shop owner received<br/>
25 cents a pair. When the ten weeks had<br/>
expired, he could not meet the mortgage. The<br/>
company demanded $ 8 interest, and a new<br/>
mortgage for $ 48. This went on for two years,<br/>
the sweater paying $ 8 every ten weeks, until<br/>
more than twice the amount of the mortgage<br/>
had been paid, yet he <span style="color: #ff0000;">we </span>never able to pay the<br/>
$ 40 at once. A dull season finally made it<br/>
impossible for him to meet even the interest.<br/>
The company threatened to foreclose and<br/>
remove his furniture. The landlord, to whom<br/>
he was in arrears for rent, threatened to dispossess him, and the loan company threatened<br/>
a criminal prosecution if he removed his <span style="color: #0000FF;">furniture</span>. His seven children were without food,<br/>
and would soon be without a roof. In his<br/>
despair, he deserted his wife and children.<br/>
The half-starved wife, with all seven children,<br/>
the oldest being but thirteen years of age, came<br/>
to the Legal Aid Society. The landlord had<br/>
locked their rooms and taken the keys, and the<br/>
company was about to remove the furniture.<br/>
They were absolutely homeless. The Legal<br/>
Aid <span style="color: #0000FF;">Society</span>'s lawyer took the family to the<br/>
municipal lodging-house, and then turned his<br/>
attention to the loan company. He instituted<br/>
proceedings which saved the furniture. The<br/>
woman was unable, of course, to make a living<br/>
for all seven children. The lodging-house<br/>
authorities found homes for all but the two<br/>
youngest. The mother sold all the furniture<br/>
but her own machine, and with that she has<br/>
started life anew. She can support herself<br/>
and the two children, and she hopes ultimately<br/>
to have all the children with her. The husband<br/>
has not been heard from. The tenth ward of<br/>
the city of New York has over <span style="color: #0000FF;">700,000 </span>Jews<br/>
living in an area of some 110 acres, and many<br/>
of them can neither read nor write, and must<br/>
inevitably become the victims of all kinds of<br/>
sharpers. It is only by the utmost care that<br/>
the Society, located in this section, can learn<br/>
the truth of the stories brought to it.<br/>
<br/>
The West-Side Branch is located on the edge<br/>
of the great theatrical district of New York and<br/>
to it comes much of the flotsam and jetsam of<br/>
that profession. Their troubles are often very<br/>
hard to adjust. In one case, a man had been<br/>
engaged as a chorus singer at the beginning of<br/>
<br/>
DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF THE POOR<br/>
<br/>
the season by a well-known manager and had<br/>
worked through a number of weeks at <span style="color: #0000FF;">rehearsals</span>; for this, according to the usual custom of<br/>
the profession, he was not paid. He was then<br/>
discharged because a new stage manager<br/>
decided that the chorus would look better if<br/>
composed of taller men. By this time, it was<br/>
too late to get another engagement for that<br/>
season. Without going into court, the Society<br/>
succeeded in persuading the manager to pay the<br/>
man for one-half of the time he had put in at<br/>
rehearsals. Most of the cases do not have to<br/>
be taken to court at all; of the 3,349 cases<br/>
brought to the Harlem Branch in 1906, it was<br/>
necessary to bring action in only about 350.<br/>
<br/>
Another <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>which, although not directly<br/>
in the line of Legal Aid, gives an idea of the<br/>
many phases of this work, was that of a crew<br/>
of thirty-seven Lascar seamen who were found<br/>
shivering in Battery Park, clad in tropical<br/>
clothing in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">severest </span>of December weather.<br/>
They had appealed in vain to the master of<br/>
their vessel for clothing more suitable to the<br/>
climate. Abdul Rahman, their leader, found<br/>
his way to the office of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seamen</span>'s Branch<br/>
and laid his complaint before those in charge.<br/>
An appeal to the agents of the vessel brought<br/>
an advance of wages which, with a liberal<br/>
donation of clothing from the Protestant<br/>
Episcopal Missionary Society, was sufficient to<br/>
clothe the coolies in garments more suitable to<br/>
the climate.<br/>
<br/>
A girl called at the Philadelphia Legal Aid<br/>
office and said that she had been attracted by<br/>
the advertisement of a Newark concern which<br/>
promised employment at $ 10 per week for<br/>
addressing envelopes. Upon answering the<br/>
advertisement, she was advised that the addressing must be done on one of the company's own<br/>
make of typewriters, which would be <span style="color: #0000FF;">furnished </span>her for $ 2.50. This sum, which represented almost a <span style="color: #0000FF;">week</span>'s work, she borrowed<br/>
from a friend and forwarded. When the<br/>
typewriter arrived, it proved to be made of tin<br/>
and became entirely useless after a few letters<br/>
were addressed. The company then refused<br/>
either to pay the promised salary (on the ground<br/>
that the girl had not done the work specified)<br/>
or to take back the typewriter. The Society<br/>
succeeded in recovering the full amount.<br/>
<br/>
One freezing day in February, a German<br/>
sailor, who could not speak English, landed in<br/>
Philadelphia after a long voyage; he was<br/>
promptly captured by a "crimp," and sold to<br/>
the captain of a most undesirable outbound<br/>
