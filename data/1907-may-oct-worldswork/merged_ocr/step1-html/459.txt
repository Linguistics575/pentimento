<span>HOW TO <span style="color: #ff0000;">KEEP<br/>
<br/>
</span>the Bureau of Municipal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Research </span>has funds,<br/>
avoid the disaster that has discredited the most<br/>
popular leader in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tammany </span>Hall. If, on the<br/>
other hand, the Bureau and the Mayor's<br/>
Commissioners of Accounts take the <span style="color: #0000FF;">search</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oil </span>the Borough <span style="color: #0000FF;">President</span>'s acts and console themselves with dissertations on high<br/>
ideals, a corrupt successor to the Borough<br/>
President will be perfectly safe, until the light<br/>
comes <span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>. Again, if the noblest man in<br/>
New York City takes Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahearn</span>'s place and<br/>
fails to change the mechanism of Mr. Ahearn's<br/>
office, nothing can prevent the recurrence of<br/>
the evils that have characterized Mr. Ahearn's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inefficiency</span>. Holes in the streets would be<br/>
just as offensive and bumpy if Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahearn<br/>
</span>spent his time at revivals. So, in San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco</span>, if every important <span style="color: #0000FF;">oll'me </span>were to be<br/>
filled to-morrow by leading sociologists,<br/>
preachers, and college presidents, San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco </span>would not have good government and<br/>
would be unable to stop the perversion and<br/>
waste of taxes, unless business methods were<br/>
used regularly to tell the truth about the acts<br/>
of government <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>and their subordinates.<br/>
<br/>
Until city, state, and national governments<br/>
give a true picture of what they do when they<br/>
do it, extravagance and bad government will<br/>
be encouraged. Taxpayers who fail to require<br/>
a truthful account of the acts of public servants<br/>
make dishonesty as easy as honesty. Just as<br/>
the cash register, the weekly statement, and<br/>
the carbon copy remove temptation and make<br/>
honesty easier than dishonesty, so a system<br/>
of records and accounts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhcial </span>acts make<br/>
governmental honesty and <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficiency </span>easier.<br/>
<br/>
The method whereby the Bureau of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Municipal </span>Research finds out whether <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>tell<br/>
the truth and makes the truth known to press<br/>
and to public can be applied to every city,<br/>
county, and residence suburb. Nothing could<br/>
make the governments of Philadelphia and<br/>
San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco </span>efficient and honest unless their<br/>
citizens, from the facts before them, want<br/>
efficient and honest government. But a bureau<br/>
of municipal research could point the way,<br/>
just as the Rockefeller and Phipps Institutes<br/>
discover and place before the world truths<br/>
regarding the prevention <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>disease.<br/>
<br/>
THE NEED OF GOOD HOUSEKEEPING IN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT<br/>
<br/>
The trouble with scandal is that it comes<br/>
too seldom. Something is needed, like good<br/>
housekeeping, that will be not too hard but<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">GOVERNMENT </span>EFFICI <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N'T<br/>
<br/>
</span>9257<br/>
<br/>
"powerful constant." To illustrate: Throughout Mr. Roosevelt's administration as Governor<br/>
of New York, there was not one department<br/>
scandal of dimensions to justify a moral<br/>
revolution; yet we now know that policyholders of the life insurance companies were<br/>
systematically plundered. After all, if you<br/>
absolutely must be run over by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">automobile</span>,<br/>
what do you care whether the chauffeur be<br/>
drunk or sober? The Pennsylvania taxpayers who gave $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2,000 </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bootblack </span>stand<br/>
worth $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">2ooderiye </span>little consolation from <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflecting </span>that their Governor and the Capitol <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commission </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">did </span>not know the difference between<br/>
mahogany and painted pine. Few of us would<br/>
forgive a <span style="color: #0000FF;">coachman </span>who could not learn within<br/>
300 or <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,000 </span>per cent. the market price of a<br/>
horse or a <span style="color: #ff0000;">buekboard</span>; yet the cure that the<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">goodness </span>fallacy" urges for stupidity, waste,<br/>
blackmail, and corruption is<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Turn the rascals<br/>
out and give their places to upright men."<br/>
Here and there the recipe is varied to include<br/>
legislation that does not provide for its own<br/>
enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
We have learned too little from our municipal<br/>
experience. As the mud-hen evades the hunter<br/>
by diving, only to appear again at another point,<br/>
so political <span style="color: #ff0000;">badntss </span>dives when attacked, staying beneath the surface until the good man<br/>
has sold his essays upon "The Passing of the<br/>
Boss," "The Triumph of Good Over Evil,"<br/>
or "The Integrity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">People</span>'s Conscience."<br/>
But just as pasteurization increases the susceptibility of milk to contamination, so there is<br/>
something about public opinion <span style="color: #ff0000;">convaleseing<br/>
</span>from a moral upheaval on which corruption<br/>
seems to thrive. After a Jerome or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Folk </span>is<br/>
elected, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Moral Upheavalist tells us that<br/>
"the people always ring true when a moral<br/>
issue is raised." While scandal is brewing,<br/>
however, he preaches the need for high ideals.<br/>
To whom? To the very men who have so<br/>
recently rung true, instead of to those who<br/>
were and still are responsible for plunder and<br/>
mis-government and whose bad character and<br/>
corrupt system upheavals rarely touch.<br/>
<br/>
The argument underlying the goodness<br/>
remedy runs something like this: "Normally<br/>
the rank and file are weak and vicious and only<br/>
the few are good; at times of great excitement<br/>
over moral issues, many members of the rank<br/>
and file can be agitated to a point where they<br/>
will accept the leadership of the good man;<br/>
the problem, therefore, of reforming government is gradually to multiply the number<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
