Court is a giver of diplomas for the same<br/>
quality. Justices Harlan and Day both sat<br/>
in that Court, and Harrison plead before it.<br/>
A year after Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s appointment, the<br/>
late Judge Howell E. Jackson of Tennessee<br/>
was promoted to the Supreme Bench, so<br/>
that for the next eight years Taft was the<br/>
presiding judge. The other two were Judges<br/>
Day and Lurton, the latter formerly Chief<br/>
Justice of Tennessee, and with these three<br/>
there was no thought of domination by any<br/>
one of them. They made that court the<br/>
greatest subordinate court in the United States,<br/>
according to the high respect paid it by the<br/>
whole legal profession.<br/>
<br/>
HIS FEARLESSNESS ON THE BENCH<br/>
<br/>
Courage as an adjunct to good citizenship<br/>
is a fair descriptive phrase of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mr. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>service on the Bench. The direct way he had<br/>
of getting to the gist of a matter, by patient<br/>
research combined with an instinctive feeling<br/>
for justice, has been mentioned already. His<br/>
was no flabby citizenship in a black gown.<br/>
When once he saw clearly through a contention,<br/>
Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>gave his decision as simply and<br/>
naturally as though he were the only man in<br/>
the world, as though there were none to criticize,<br/>
or to threaten, nor yet one whose vote he might<br/>
need later on. This courage, as unconscious<br/>
with him as the breath he drew, was the keynote to his career as judge.<br/>
<br/>
Once he faced a court-room filled with angry<br/>
strikers, sent their leader to jail, and broke a<br/>
strike that had become a reign of violence.<br/>
This happened in 1894, during the terrible<br/>
period when Debs and the American Railway<br/>
Union, 250,000 strong, were trying to block<br/>
every train in the country that hauled a Pullman car. Debs sent a turbulent lieutenant<br/>
named Phelan "to take the boys out" at Cincinnati. Phelan used both speeches and clubs,<br/>
and the strike spread to most of the roads running out of Cincinnati. But he should have<br/>
left the Southern Railway alone, for the<br/>
Southern was the Court's road, and Judge<br/>
Taft himself had appointed its receiver. The<br/>
other roads wanted nothing better than to get<br/>
the strike into a Federal court, and the headstrong Phelan gave them the chance. When<br/>
he tried to tie up the Southern, he was enjoined<br/>
from interfering with the management of the<br/>
receiver's road. But the next night he harangued the men again. He didn't care, he<br/>
roared, even if he were violating injunctions.<br/>
<br/>
TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
Of course, a judge must defend his court from<br/>
contempt, so Phelan was placed under arrest.<br/>
<br/>
Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>had been turning other strikers<br/>
loose on promises of good behavior. He had<br/>
no wish to visit suffering on the deluded and<br/>
impassioned. But the case was different with<br/>
Phelan. Judge Taft did not delay trial, though<br/>
the mob spirit was at its most dangerous tide.<br/>
In Chicago, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Debs</span>'s case was not decided until<br/>
long after the strike, but Judge Taft could see<br/>
the matter in no other way than that if there<br/>
were violation of the law, there should be<br/>
punishment in time to stop more crimes of the<br/>
same <span style="color: #ff0000;">sort..<br/>
<br/>
</span>Phelan's trial lasted a week, and it was a<br/>
week over a powder magazine. The defense<br/>
fought hard, but its greatest reliance was<br/>
terrorism. On the third day someone discovered<br/>
that Phelan had a signal code with the strikers<br/>
who were on the witness stand. He mopped<br/>
his brow, or stroked his chin, or twitched his<br/>
foot, and the witness answered either "Yes,"<br/>
"No," or "I don't know." Phelan was then<br/>
moved out of sight of the witnesses, and after<br/>
that they were completely at sea.<br/>
<br/>
Almost any judge, in sheer human fallibility, would be prejudiced after such tactics,<br/>
but an episode occurred that illustrates the<br/>
invariable fairness of this particular judge.<br/>
One of Phelan's counsel, a criminal lawyer not<br/>
highly respected by the Bar, was making his<br/>
argument; Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>, looking up, observed<br/>
that an attorney for the receiver and others<br/>
were indifferently reading newspapers. The<br/>
flare of red that is a danger signal spread over<br/>
the Judge's neck. He asked to interrupt the<br/>
speaker. And then he said, very sternly:<br/>
<br/>
"This is a court room, not a reading room<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>"<br/>
<br/>
A rattling and folding of papers instantly<br/>
followed. The eminent counsel for the receiver<br/>
arose, meek and embarrassed, and apologized<br/>
Others present, though not even then known<br/>
to be in the room, sent contrite letters to Judge<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft </span>the next morning. Thenceforth the <span style="color: #ff0000;">illconsidered </span>counsel for the defense was listened<br/>
to respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
At the close of the trial, Judge Taft announced that he would render his decision at<br/>
twelve o'clock of the fourth day. The first<br/>
day he and his secretary worked on it until late<br/>
in the evening. The second day they worked<br/>
until much later, and the third day until two<br/>
in the morning. The secretary then went home<br/>
and transcribed his notes until five. At 9:30<br/>
he was back at court to find the Judge <span style="color: #0000FF;">already<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
