<span>WHAT MIGHT <span style="color: #0000FF;">BIC<br/>
</span>sewing. They have also succeeded to some<br/>
extent as travelling salesmen and agents. There<br/>
is opportunity for them in news-stands, <span style="color: #ff0000;">tobaccoand </span>candy-shops and other small businesses.<br/>
No doubt other occupations and industries<br/>
will be found for them.<br/>
<br/>
But even a few occupations are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>for<br/>
them all, if the trade and the man are fitted<br/>
one to the other, and both are <span style="color: #0000FF;">properly </span>advanced<br/>
in the hurrying market-place of life. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>practical failure of many graduates of our<br/>
schools for the blind is rooted in the entire<br/>
problem of education. But in addition to these<br/>
there is a class whose problem is not strictly<br/>
educational-those who have lost their sight<br/>
in mature years.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">DIFFICULTIES </span>IN GETTING WORK TO DO<br/>
<br/>
The lot of an idle graduate of a school who<br/>
has learned how to be blind is hard enough.<br/>
He leaves school flushed with hope and courage.<br/>
He thinks he can brave the world and conquer<br/>
it. Perhaps he hears of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>position as teacher<br/>
and makes the necessary application. His<br/>
application is refused because he cannot <span style="color: #0000FF;">see</span>.<br/>
He learns of another position and applies for<br/>
it in person, passes all the tests and examinations successfully, and is praised for his<br/>
ability. Still his services are not accepted<br/>
because it is not thought possible for him to<br/>
teach even music as well as a seeing man. Yet<br/>
he has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>to teach music. He has<br/>
even studied under masters.<br/>
<br/>
If a young blind man, educated and trained<br/>
in the dark, loses courage after repeated failure,<br/>
what must be the feelings of one who is <span style="color: #0000FF;">suddenly </span>stricken blind in mine or factory?<br/>
Blighted ambitions, sorrow, bitterness and<br/>
despair. "What will become of me? Who<br/>
will feed and clothe my little ones? Must I<br/>
live useless always, an object of charity?"<br/>
These are the questions that rack him. He<br/>
may try to be cheerful; but happy he cannot<br/>
be, unless he finds occupation. His unused<br/>
faculties will rust. The light of intelligence<br/>
fades from his countenance. His hands grope<br/>
for the tool that accident has snatched away.<br/>
<br/>
What shall we do to alter this condition of<br/>
the blind in America? First of all, it is necessary to awaken public interest in matters concerning the sightless. An enlightened public<br/>
sentiment is the only power in a democracy<br/>
that can bring about and maintain the betterment of any class. When the public <span style="color: #ff0000;">under<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stands </span>the blind man, his needs and capacities<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>DONE<br/>
<br/>
FOR THE BLIND 9261<br/>
there will be an end to the more special causes<br/>
which we find partly responsible for present<br/>
conditions in this <span style="color: #ff0000;">country-lack </span>of enthusiasm,<br/>
intelligence and cooperation on the part of<br/>
those who have charge of the institutions for<br/>
the blind.<br/>
<br/>
The superintendents of these institutions,<br/>
dependent on boards of trustees who know<br/>
almost nothing about the needs of these institutions and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blind</span>, trusted<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>public which is not informed, are often<br/>
men of indifferent attainment, wedded to petty<br/>
theories, and unprogressive. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hey </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">generally </span>kind, and believe that they have the best<br/>
interests of their charges at heart. But the<br/>
existing condition of the sightless throughout<br/>
the country bears sufficient evidence to their<br/>
incompetency.<br/>
<br/>
CONFUSION IN PRINTING FOR THE BLIND<br/>
<br/>
An obvious illustration of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">incompetency<br/>
</span>and the absence of cooperation between the<br/>
schools is the confusion in the prints for the<br/>
blind. One would think that the advantages<br/>
of having a common print would not require<br/>
argument. Yet every effort to decide which<br/>
print is best has failed. The Perkins <span style="color: #0000FF;">Institution </span>for the Blind, with a large printing fund,<br/>
clings to Line <span style="color: #0000FF;">Letter-embossed </span>characters,<br/>
shaped like Roman letters, in spite of the fact<br/>
that most of the blind prefer a point <span style="color: #0000FF;">system</span>.<br/>
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Blind<br/>
offers its readers American Braille, a print in<br/>
which the letters are composed of raised clots.<br/>
This is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">modification </span>of the system which<br/>
was perfected by Louis Braille <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-quarters<br/>
</span>of a century ago and is still the system used<br/>
throughout Europe. The New York Institution<br/>
invented, controls and advocates New York<br/>
Point, another species of Braille. The money<br/>
appropriated by the national government to<br/>
emboss books for the blind is used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>the<br/>
types. The new periodical, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matilda </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Z </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ieg/er<br/>
</span>Magazine for the Blind, the boon for which<br/>
we have waited many years, is printed in<br/>
American Braille and New York Point. The<br/>
same book, expensive to print once, has to be<br/>
duplicated in the various systems for the different institutions. Other prints <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>yet to come.<br/>
They are still in the crucible of meditation.<br/>
A plague upon all these prints! Let us have<br/>
one system, whether it is an ideal one, or not.<br/>
For my part, 1 wish nothing had been invented<br/>
except European Braille. There was already<br/>
a considerable library in this system when the<br/>
