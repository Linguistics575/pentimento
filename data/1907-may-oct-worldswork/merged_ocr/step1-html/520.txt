</span>de <span style="color: #0000FF;">menthe</span>. Coal-tar, that chokes us with its<br/>
asphaltum stew-pots and smooths the path for<br/>
the flying automobile, helps to vulcanize its<br/>
tires, to paint its body, to light its lamps, and<br/>
to run its engines. Side by side in the same<br/>
garden grow roses, potatoes, deadly nightshade, onions, aconite, and cabbage. A very<br/>
slight readjustment of the atoms and molecules<br/>
of carbolic acid makes salicylic acid.<br/>

ALL FOOD IS CHEMICAL<br/>
<br/>
Almost everything in our food-bins, granaries, and slaughter pens, in all organic matter, is composed of four chemical elements:<br/>
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon; and<br/>
carbon, the principal product of coal-tar, is<br/>
chief. Chemists give every substance a name<br/>
according to the elements and numbers of<br/>
atoms of which it is composed. Yet the<br/>
formulae of numerous well-known substances<br/>
are identical. Take certain atoms of carbon,<br/>
hydrogen, and oxygen, and you can make<br/>
either starch or cotton, according to the way<br/>
in which you put them together.<br/>
<br/>
This point in chemistry is mentioned to<br/>
show that we are helplessly dependent upon<br/>
chemical skill in eating synthetic products<br/>
like the fruit essences and perfumes; and that<br/>
it is not for us to assume that a synthetic food<br/>
substance is not just as healthful and nutritious<br/>
as its analogue made in Nature's out-door<br/>
laboratory.<br/>
<br/>
However slight the differences in formula, or<br/>
soil site, or appearance, taste, and odor, we<br/>
know that one stuff will kill and another nourish; and we must be guided by some sort of<br/>
evidence that settles the question. But when<br/>
we discard synthetic strawberry essence because it comes from a coal-tar source, we may<br/>
be totally wrong. Certain varieties of bacteria<br/>
will destroy us if they get a chance. Yet our<br/>
lives depend upon other bacteria-the sources<br/>
of fermentation. All vegetation is made possible only through bacterial fermentation in<br/>
the soil. Certain "bouquets" in brewed<br/>
liquors and flavors in butter and cheese are<br/>
due to the formation of bacterial ferments.<br/>
Many of these bacteria are well known, are<br/>
cultivated, and used to make these desired<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">bouquets</span>" and flavors. Here in the germ<br/>
industry is a duplicate to synthetic chemistry.<br/>
Here the breeders must be careful not to let<br/>
disease-bearing germs mix with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flavormakers</span>, or the cup will savor of death.<br/>

WHAT THE FOOD LAW SAVES US FROM<br/>
<br/>
vessel, very little food traveled far from home.<br/>
Pemmican, tongue, ham, bacon, and cod, after<br/>
a preparatory creosote varnishing in clouds<br/>
of hickory smudge smoke, were equal to distant<br/>
journeys; and so were brine-cured corned<br/>
beef, mackerel, oysters, pigs' knuckles, and<br/>
pickles. Few foods were eaten out of season,<br/>
fresh meats were of recent slaughter, vegetables<br/>
not far from the garden. But every commercial influence, from railroading to canning,<br/>
has increased the temptation or demand for<br/>
preservatives, cheaper substitutes, or complete<br/>
substitution. Competition has made extra<br/>
effort in making foods attractive in appearance,<br/>
odor, and taste.<br/>
<br/>
We are in a very crude state of food <span style="color: #0000FF;">art</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>chromo stage. If a fruit or vegetable<br/>
shows a leaning towards any primary color,<br/>
it is shoved into its most dazzling grade. Butter must be Etruscan gold, not washed-out<br/>
brass. No Nile-green peas shall disgrace our<br/>
board; let them be green like the emerald!<br/>
The can-freed tomato and the ketchup must<br/>
be Roman-red. Paint-wrap the candy with<br/>
the flag of freedom for Independence Day<br/>
consumption, and with the shamrock on St.<br/>
Patrick's Day.<br/>
<br/>
BENZOIC ACID EVERYWHERE<br/>
<br/>
The drug preservatives in common use are<br/>
benzoic acid, borax, boracic acid, salicylic<br/>
acid, formaldehyde, creosote, salt, saltpetre,<br/>
sulphite of soda, and a number of proprietary<br/>
secret mixtures. The object of using preservatives is to prevent decomposition or<br/>
bacterial fermentation. The aim is to use<br/>
enough to stay decomposition and yet not<br/>
injure health. The producers, the judges, and<br/>
the public are very much at sea as to what<br/>
preservatives best meet these requirements.<br/>
Much testimony was offered the Congressional<br/>
<br/>
'food-bill committee regarding benzoic acid.<br/>
<br/>
The medical dose is from IO to 60 grains.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Benzoie </span>acid used as a food preservative requires from <span style="color: #0000FF;">IT </span>to I grain in such amount of an<br/>
article as would be eaten at one time, or I part<br/>
in 1,200 to 2,000. In an ordinary "helping"<br/>
of canned tomatoes preserved with benzoic<br/>
acid, one would eat <span style="color: #0000FF;">about</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>to I grain of the<br/>
drug. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in cranberries, huckleberries, plums, grapes, grape<br/>
fruit, oranges, pineapples, carrots, parsnips,<br/>
cauliflower, rhubarb, and green peppers. In<br/>
fresh cranberries there <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of I per cent. of<br/>
benzoic acid; in stewed cranberries I, of I per<br/>
