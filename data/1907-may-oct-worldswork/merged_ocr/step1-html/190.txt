raised money by public subscription to<br/>
have them come. This is, perhaps, the<br/>
most important fact yet <span style="color: #ff0000;">developed-that<br/>
<br/>
</span>agricultural communities themselves may be<br/>
expected to provide for such instruction-at<br/>
first, the best-informed and the most energetic<br/>
of them. It may follow that such a local<br/>
demand will arise as to make this method of<br/>
instruction widespread; and perhaps the state<br/>
governments and other such agencies will<br/>
adopt it. In Texas I heard the work spoken<br/>
of as "Knapp's University," and throughout<br/>
the region which the demonstrators have covered it is regarded as the best practical help<br/>
that agricultural life has ever received.<br/>
<br/>
Such is the simple story that I went to Lake<br/>
Charles, La., to get; for it is at Lake Charles<br/>
that Dr. Knapp has his headquarters. In his<br/>
office, as well as at other places throughout the<br/>
South, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>met some of the demonstrators,<br/>
selected by him to do this work. I saw some<br/>
that had worked in Texas, some in Louisiana,<br/>
some in Mississippi, and some in Alabama.<br/>
Every one talked as if he had found a great<br/>
mission in life; every one had a sort of apostolic<br/>
zeal and felt that he was leading mankind to a<br/>
permanent higher level of prosperity and right<br/>
living. You will have to travel a long time<br/>
and talk to many classes of men before you<br/>
will find such certainty of purpose, such <span style="color: #0000FF;">devotion </span>to human betterment, as the best of<br/>
these men show. The stories of their work<br/>
and the experiences of the farmers whom they<br/>
have taught are stories of making two bales of<br/>
cotton grow where one grew before, or of three<br/>
bushels of corn where one grew before; but is<br/>
not that as cheerful a story as there is in contemporaneous history?<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Knapp recently explained the system<br/>
of work and instruction in these paragraphs:<br/>
<br/>
"First, the farmer is selected to conduct a simple and<br/>
inexpensive demonstration. Second, a contract is drawn<br/>
with the United States Department of Agriculture by which<br/>
he agrees to follow certain instructions. Third, better<br/>
seed is furnished him and his name is published in the<br/>
papers. Fourth, each month when the Government's<br/>
Field Agent goes to inspect his demonstration many of his<br/>
neighbors are invited; consequently, he will almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">unconsciously </span>improve his farm so as to be ready for company<br/>
and cultivate all of his crops better. Fifth, a report of his<br/>
extra crop is made in the county papers. His neighbors<br/>
talk about it and want to buy seed. Sixth, he sells the seed<br/>
of his crop at a high price; his neighbors ask him how he<br/>
produced it; he is invited to address public assemblies, he<br/>
has become a man <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>note and a leader of the people and<br/>
cannot return to his old ways. Soon there is a body of<br/>
<br/>

such men; a township, a county, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">finallya </span>state is transformed.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>The environment of men must be penetrated and<br/>
modified or little permanent change can be made in them.<br/>
The environment of the farmer is limited generally to a<br/>
few miles. The demonstration must be carried to this<br/>
limited area and show how simple and easy it is to restore<br/>
the virgin fertility of the soil, to multiply the product of<br/>
the land per acre, to increase the number of acres each<br/>
laborer can till by three or four fold and harvest a profit<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">untitled </span>fields by animal husbandry. This is our<br/>
Farmers' <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cooperative </span>Demonstration Work."<br/>
<br/>
The accompanying map shows the places<br/>
where these men have made demonstrations<br/>
in certain counties in northeastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Texas </span>and<br/>
in Louisiana, and the following are some of<br/>
the reports:<br/>
<br/>
A farmer, Mr. W. H. Miller, of Fairfield,<br/>
Texas, wrote last November about the result of<br/>
the work done by Mr. Procter, one of the<br/>
demonstrators:<br/>
<br/>
"Every man that followed Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Procter</span>'s instructions<br/>
has succeeded far beyond his expectations. I have<br/>
doubled my cotton crop on every acre that I planted and<br/>
cultivated according to your instructions. I have<br/>
been farming for twenty years but I realize that I have<br/>
just begun. Farming is in its infancy. We feel like we<br/>
have a new lease on life in following your methods."<br/>
<br/>
The same demonstrator reports that in an<br/>
area where the weevil had done great damage<br/>
in 1903 and where the demonstration work<br/>
was done in time to show results in the crop of<br/>
1904, the yield was as follows:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Another demonstrator, Mr. H. E. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saveley</span>,<br/>
reported last December the bales of cotton<br/>
grown about a number of Mississippi towns,<br/>
on the same area, as follows<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
