of the people. Nor is there going to be any<br/>
less capital in the world nor any less owned by<br/>
Americans than there is now. In fact, the total<br/>
of real wealth every year becomes greater.<br/>
Why, then, is there a <span style="color: #0000FF;">feeling </span>that the tide of<br/>
prosperity may slacken? Why do men apprehend a change from good times to bad?<br/>
<br/>
The Only Change That Can Come<br/>
<br/>
There is but one change that can come to<br/>
slacken the tide of prosperity, and that is a<br/>
change in the freedom with which money flows<br/>
into productive industries. If a large amount<br/>
of capital were to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">hoarded </span>or to be locked<br/>
up in undertakings that did not pay and from<br/>
which it could not be withdrawn without great<br/>
loss, then that much capital would, for the time<br/>
being, be lost to productive industry; and, to<br/>
that extent, useful and profitable work would<br/>
be checked or suspended. Money would, to<br/>
that extent, become "high" and "timid."<br/>
<br/>
In fact, this very thing has taken place, to a<br/>
degree. Money that would otherwise have<br/>
been available for productive uses was spent<br/>
or consumed in the Boer War (English consols have, therefore, fallen lower than they have<br/>
been in recent times), in the Japanese-Russian<br/>
War, in the destruction of San <span style="color: #0000FF;">Francisco</span>, or<br/>
has gone into the rehabilitation of Japan and<br/>
into a hundred lesser and similar diversions<br/>
from the customary channels. For these reasons, money is high and certain classes of<br/>
securities are low in all the principal countries.<br/>
The phenomenon is not confined to the United<br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
But this result may also be caused, or<br/>
augmented, by a mere state of mind. It is<br/>
not necessary that great sums be spent in war<br/>
to cause an apparent scarcity of money.<br/>
Suppose that men in the United States who<br/>
own only a few million dollars, and who have<br/>
for ten years been actively using this <span style="color: #ff0000;">sum-An<br/>
</span>railroads, in factories, in banks, keeping it<br/>
going all the while and <span style="color: #0000FF;">allowing </span>it to flow<br/>
freely into all sorts of enterprises-suppose<br/>
these men become afraid and withdraw their<br/>
money from general use; suppose they sell<br/>
their interest in thousands of small industries<br/>
and put these millions into lands that yield<br/>
nothing now or into government bonds and<br/>
other low-yielding securities; in other words,<br/>
suppose they invest their wealth in less productive ways and withdraw their money from a<br/>
thousand paying industries, simply because<br/>
they become alarmed-what happens then?<br/>
<br/>
MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
The owners of this capital of course receive<br/>
reduced incomes. But they can afford that<br/>
loss, for they save their principal. But the<br/>
multitude of working producers lose more or<br/>
less of their productive business. Money<br/>
becomes too high. They cannot go on making<br/>
their accustomed profits; and very soon the<br/>
weaker among them fail; and presently we have<br/>
"hard <span style="color: #0000FF;">times</span>" or <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>panic-all because men who<br/>
control capital become afraid.<br/>
<br/>
This is one way in which panics come. It<br/>
is practically the only way in which a stop in<br/>
our present prosperity can come. The whole<br/>
question, then, narrows itself to this: Is there<br/>
any good reason why men should become<br/>
afraid and withdraw money from productive<br/>
uses? There is no sound reason why they<br/>
should. Any comprehensive survey of the<br/>
industrial condition of the world, and particularly of the United States, will fail to disclose<br/>
any sound reason for fear.<br/>
<br/>
But fear may come without sound <span style="color: #0000FF;">reasons-may </span>come for insufficient and even silly reasons.<br/>
There are as many such reasons as there are<br/>
superstitions or prejudices held by men; and<br/>
short-sighted men manufacture reasons for fear.<br/>
<br/>
Financial Machinery <span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span>Fault<br/>
<br/>
The worst of it is that our financial machinery<br/>
is so constructed as to cause any fear, whether<br/>
it be reasonable or not, to spread; for it is too<br/>
much under the control of a non-productive<br/>
class of men, or men who can afford to be nonproductive, and of men who can, by the aid of<br/>
this machinery, use not only their own capital<br/>
but the money of the productive classes as<br/>
pawns in a game. If a man could withdraw<br/>
from industry only his own money, the country<br/>
is so large and wealth is so distributed that<br/>
perhaps no very serious damage could be done,<br/>
even if many men should become panic-stricken.<br/>
But our financial machinery is such that men<br/>
who control it can practically withdraw from<br/>
industry not only their own money but parts of<br/>
yours and mine and our neighbors'; and they<br/>
can use much of it, when money becomes<br/>
high, in their own games of financial thimblerigging-use it as gamblers or misers use<br/>
money. It is not the real wealth in the country<br/>
that these men can directly control, but the<br/>
surplus wealth, the ready money, the liquid<br/>
capital; and that is enough to disturb values.<br/>
<br/>
The one great weakness in our <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>and<br/>
industrial life lies in this weakness of our banking and corporate machinery, and in the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
