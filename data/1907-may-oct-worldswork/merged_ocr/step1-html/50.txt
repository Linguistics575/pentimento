moose. It took them several days after they<br/>
got to camp to get their instruments in order.<br/>
On leaving camp they gave the outfit to<br/>
two guides to carry over a portage. When<br/>
the photographers caught up again, the guides<br/>
were standing in the water, holding the canoes<br/>
and wet from head to foot. Unmistakably,<br/>
there had been an upset and the cameras were<br/>
in the river. With some difficulty they were<br/>
fished out and the guides were sent back for<br/>

more films for the moving-picture machine,<br/>
which had to be taken apart, dried, and<br/>
adjusted again. Soon after they had started<br/>
the second time, they found a young bull moose<br/>
feeding in a pond, one side of which had a soft,<br/>
muddy bottom. This was exactly what they<br/>
wanted. Mr. Dugmore, in one canoe, kept<br/>
the moose from getting ashore, while Mr.<br/>
Robinson set up the <span style="color: #0000FF;">moving-picture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>machine<br/>
on the muddy bank, so that <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>the moose<br/>

the machine a longer time to get pictures of<br/>
him. But the wetting which the machine had<br/>
suffered had made it difficult to set up quickly<br/>
and while Mr. Robinson was working with<br/>
it the moose almost got by the other canoe and<br/>
away into the woods. When the machine was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>ready, the guides and Mr. Dugmore,<br/>
with both canoes, drove the moose ashore in<br/>
