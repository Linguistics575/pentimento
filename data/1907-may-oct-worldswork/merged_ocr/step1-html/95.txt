<span>IS THE DOCTOR A SHYLOCK?<br/>
<br/>
he were to be paid for <span style="color: #0000FF;">all-or </span>most-of the<br/>
professional visits he makes, he could afford<br/>
to cut his prices in two; but the ethics of his<br/>
calling demand that he respond to every ring<br/>
of his bell, however hopeless the prospect of<br/>
compensation. The reputable physician who<br/>
would demand <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>references before<br/>
putting his finger on the pulse is as rare as the<br/>
steamboat captain who deserts his passengers<br/>
when the ship strikes-and shares the same<br/>
odium. He would be forced out of the ranks<br/>
of any reputable medical society in America.<br/>
That he should not patent nor conceal any<br/>
new formula whose merits he discovers; that<br/>
he should give to his profession the rights to<br/>
all instruments he may invent, or improve;<br/>
that he should leave his family or his bed at<br/>
any hour at the call of any man; that he should<br/>
risk his own life and that of his children whenever an epidemic breaks <span style="color: #0000FF;">outfall </span>this and<br/>
more is accepted by the public as a matter of<br/>
course. His is a thankless task, for the doctor<br/>
has no press-agent. The only member of the<br/>
community who realizes the extent of his public<br/>
service and the smallness of his recompense is<br/>
the doctor's wife.<br/>
<br/>
I recall a certain medical student who in his<br/>
senior year took charge of an obstetrical case<br/>
"for practice." The patient was a poor<br/>
Negro woman living in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tumble-down </span>shanty<br/>
on a disreputable street. The student was<br/>
careful to secure from his professor a promise<br/>
that he would respond to his aid when needed.<br/>
One night the call came unexpectedly and the<br/>
student rushed for the telephone. The professor's wife answered that the doctor was out<br/>
of the city. Beads of perspiration burst out<br/>
on the young man's brow and he worked his<br/>
thinking apparatus quickly and hard. He<br/>
could recall but one other, and for him he<br/>
called with the haste of a man turning in a<br/>
fire-alarm. To his great joy, the second doctor<br/>
answered-but said that his wife had that hour<br/>
returned from an absence of several weeks and<br/>
would leave again the following morning.<br/>
But when the student explained the situation,<br/>
the doctor left his fireside and sat with the<br/>
student in that poor <span style="color: #0000FF;">woman</span>'s hovel until<br/>
nearly daylight the following morning. But<br/>
he did not do it "for practice!"<br/>
<br/>
And if such a physician be called from the<br/>
bedside of a patient whom he has perhaps<br/>
visited for weeks without the prospect of a<br/>
single dollar, to attend a millionaire with an<br/>
aching stomach, he regards it as only the<br/>
<br/>
8893<br/>
<br/>
capitalist's duty to society that his check should<br/>
balance the poor devil's account also.<br/>

MEDICAL INCOMES IN NEW YORK CITY<br/>
<br/>
What are the real facts about medical <span style="color: #0000FF;">in..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comes </span>of to-day? In the effort to reach an<br/>
honest answer, we must differentiate between<br/>
the New York specialist, the average American<br/>
specialist, the average successful practitioner,<br/>
and the country doctor, at least<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The New York specialist receives the largest<br/>
fees in the country and the most of them, for<br/>
two <span style="color: #0000FF;">reasons</span>. Here are found a few physicians<br/>
of exceptional reputation and hither gravitate<br/>
the country's wealthiest patients. Those who<br/>
have not come to New York to live, come now<br/>
and then for consultation. While figures that<br/>
can be relied upon are not easily obtained, there<br/>
are doubtless a number of specialists on Manhattan Island whose incomes run above<br/>
$ 100,000 a year. It is easy to imagine that<br/>
those who attend New York's great magnates<br/>
receive large fees and that their prestige attracts<br/>
many other wealthy patients. These belong<br/>
in a class to themselves and are representative<br/>
neither of the American specialist nor of the<br/>
average specialist of New York City.<br/>
<br/>
The largest fees, quite naturally, are charged<br/>
for surgical work; the operation for appendicitis is a familiar example. The customary<br/>
New York charge was brought out some months<br/>
ago in the published letters that passed between the surgeon and the mother of a wealthy<br/>
patient. The case was one of gangrenous<br/>
appendicitis, "with impending disaster"; the<br/>
surgeon went twenty miles from the city to<br/>
operate, and saved the patient. He sent a bill<br/>
for $ 1,080; the mother sent a check for $ 600<br/>
and a friendly letter saying that she had found<br/>
$ 500 to be the customary fee in the city.<br/>
The surgeon replied that it was pretty well<br/>
known that he never undertook the responsibilities of an abdominal operation for less than<br/>
$ <span style="color: #ff0000;">31,000</span>, that in some such cases his fee had<br/>
been several times that amount, but that he<br/>
would submit the correspondence to three<br/>
other surgeons. All of them endorsed the<br/>
charge as reasonable and one specifically stated<br/>
that in all abdominal operations he also charged<br/>
$ 1,000, or more. These charges, it seems,<br/>
are made for services to families well able to<br/>
pay. Some patients doubtless pay more;<br/>
most undoubtedly pay less-all the way down<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>These figures, standing alone, will appear<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
