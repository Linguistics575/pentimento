<br/>
</span>You think, perhaps, -that this is hardly true;<br/>
but that the man of many millions may <span style="color: #0000FF;">withdraw </span>as easily as you or me. Let us look to a<br/>
time when he tried to do it. In the autumn of<br/>
1902 this country had arrived at a pinnacle of<br/>
prosperity. Tremendously capitalized trusts<br/>
by the dozen were declaring dividends, arraying<br/>
themselves in the silks and satins of prosperity.<br/>
I saw it; so did you. Six months later, the very<br/>
rich took fright. If only one, or two, or three<br/>
had done it, it would have mattered very little.<br/>
But hundreds of them did it all at once. You<br/>
saw a million men thrown out of work; you saw<br/>
grim poverty sweep down upon the valley of the<br/>
Monongahela; you saw a dozen great steam<br/>
yachts offered for hurried sale in the daily<br/>
papers of New York; you saw bankruptcy fall<br/>
upon half a dozen trusts, and you felt the pinch<br/>
of poverty in your own little bank account. And<br/>
why?<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>It was, in part, at least, because the rich<br/>
had sought to turn their backs upon their<br/>
responsibilities, had sought to escape the web<br/>
that they had woven.<br/>
<br/>
Then, what is this subtle, volatile, sensitive<br/>
thing, credit? Most men use it; but I have yet<br/>
to meet the man who can define it. Most<br/>
economists say that it is based upon ownership<br/>
of money or of property. Thus, a man who<br/>
owns a mill which will produce for him, in the<br/>
next six months, wealth amounting to $ 10,000<br/>
can get credit for that amount, payable in six<br/>
months. Well and <span style="color: #0000FF;">good</span>. But another man<br/>
owns, we shall say, nothing. His name is good,<br/>
and he enjoys a steady income. He, too, has<br/>
credit, perhaps quite as good and extensive as<br/>
that of the man who owns the mill. Credit,<br/>
then<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is not based merely on tangible property.<br/>
It is also based on honor, good name, or some<br/>
intangible, yet fairly secure inflow of money.<br/>
<br/>
CREDIT, THE BASIS OF BUSINESS<br/>
<br/>
Now, in the business world, it is to-day quite<br/>
impossible to keep pace with the times without<br/>
making the earnings of to-morrow pay the<br/>
debts of to-day. For instance, the Milliken<br/>
Steel Company, of Staten Island, has immense<br/>
orders on its books for steel, to be manufactured<br/>
and delivered to the merchants within the next<br/>
year. But it is necessary to spend a lot of<br/>
money before that steel can be made and delivered. Raw material has to be bought, transportation charges must be paid, labor must be<br/>
hired and paid by the week or day, rents and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">taxes </span>are falling due. The future earnings<br/>
are there, on the books, but how can the orders<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9479<br/>
<br/>
</span>be filled unless these intangible future orders<br/>
can be made tangible, can, in fact, be made<br/>
into money?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the manager of the plant may go to<br/>
the dealers in iron, from whom he must buy<br/>
his raw material, and say to them:<br/>
<br/>
"I want 10,000 tons of iron. It will cost me,<br/>
to-day, $ 140,000. I shall take it from you, if<br/>
you will take my note for six months."<br/>
<br/>
The dealers know the firm. They consider<br/>
the promise perfectly good. He gets the iron.<br/>
They get his note. That is one transaction.<br/>
But, later in the year, the dealers themselves<br/>
find themselves pressed for money. They look<br/>
over the notes they own. The Milliken note<br/>
looks like good paper. They decide to sell it.<br/>
Perhaps some private buyer takes it from them,<br/>
but much more likely they take it to a bank.<br/>
The bank does not know Milliken Bros., but<br/>
it does know the dealers. So the dealers write<br/>
their names across the back of the note, turn it<br/>
into the bank, and are credited with so much,<br/>
on the bank's books, namely the $ 140,000, less<br/>
the discount to correspond to the interest for<br/>
the time the note still has to run. That<br/>
"credit" at the bank is just as much good to<br/>
the dealers as so much cash. They can draw<br/>
checks against it, or get it in cash, if they please,<br/>
and put the money wherever they like.<br/>
<br/>
Meantime, Milliken Bros. have wages to pay.<br/>
The credit they got from the dealers on their<br/>
iron did not help them to pay the weekly wages.<br/>
Men who work cannot take notes for their<br/>
wages; they must have cash. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">firm </span>of<br/>
Milliken Bros. has not, of course, exhausted<br/>
all its future resources in buying that iron.<br/>
The money it will receive for its steel will not<br/>
only pay off the debt to the iron dealers, but<br/>
also all the expense of making the steel. The<br/>
manager goes to the firm's bank, explains the<br/>
matter of the orders for steel, and asks about<br/>
borrowing some money. The bank scrutinize<br/>
the business pretty closely, measures up the<br/>
contracts for steel, then makes a loan to Milliken Bros. A note is made out, promising to<br/>
pay $ 25,000 to bearer in six months. The<br/>
bank takes it, and credits the firm on its books<br/>
with that $ 2 5,000, less discount for six months<br/>
at whatever the rate may be<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Usually, it is<br/>
6 per cent., or thereabouts; but it runs very<br/>
high at times, and at other times it is lower.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here are two separate transactions in<br/>
credit; and each is performed through a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span>.<br/>
What is a bank? If anyone thinks he can<br/>
answer the question he is welcome to try<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>One<br/>
