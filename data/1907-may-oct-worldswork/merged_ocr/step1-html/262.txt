<span>SAFEGUARDS FOR INVESTORS<br/>
<br/>
HERE has never been a period in the<br/>
<br/>
I history of Wall Street when the con<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scientious </span>bankers and brokers were<br/>
more careful in giving advice to intending<br/>
purchasers of bonds and stocks than they are<br/>
to-day. So far at least as the real leaders of<br/>
the investment market are concerned, the<br/>
interests of the people are now honestly guarded<br/>
by the bankers.<br/>
<br/>
There have been periods when the relation<br/>
of the investor to the Wall Street market was<br/>
the relation of the plundered to the plunderer.<br/>
For instance, at the top of the long rise in the<br/>
stock-market in 1891, in 1902, and at other<br/>
similar periods, even the most conservative<br/>
bankers continued strongly to advise their<br/>
customers to buy stocks without fear. But<br/>
at the top of the great rise that took place in<br/>
1906, a steady, <span style="color: #ff0000;">infh1ential </span>body of bankers,<br/>
without conference with one another but with<br/>
almost perfect unanimity, warned the people<br/>
to leave the stocks alone. This rank-and-file<br/>
of the Wall Street army has now turned "traitor" to "the interests" and has raised a shout<br/>
of warning.<br/>
<br/>
This is a hopeful sign. In the beginning,<br/>
the banker was supposed to be a safeguard to<br/>
the client, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>advice was supposed to be<br/>
disinterested, and generally was. But in the<br/>
long period between the Civil War and the<br/>
year 1906, the banker degenerated. Instead<br/>
of calling himself a "banker," he called himself a "banker and broker." The old-line<br/>
banker became an <span style="color: #0000FF;">anachronism</span>. His real<br/>
investment client gradually disappeared, or<br/>
caught the speculative fever and began to<br/>
follow his mentor into "stock deals," "marginal<br/>
accounts," and all the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">new-fangled<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">contrivances </span>for separating him from his money.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of so-called "banking houses"<br/>
arose in Wall Street that would have been a<br/>
disgrace to the name in the other days. As<br/>
time went on and the great financiers came into<br/>
prominence, they began to subordinate these<br/>
banking houses to their own individual interests.<br/>
When Smith, Brown & Co. had gained a<br/>
good list of clients and could therefore buy a<br/>
lot of stocks for investment, some great magnate<br/>
undertook to bring Smith, Brown & Co.<br/>
<br/>
under his influence. Perhaps he would open<br/>
a small account with the house, and buy and<br/>
sell stocks through it. After a time, he would<br/>
invite the head of the house to lunch at his<br/>
club, compliment him upon the way in which<br/>
his orders were executed, intimate that the<br/>
account would be enlarged, and finally tell<br/>
him of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great movement that was going to<br/>
take place in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">marketmext </span>week.<br/>
<br/>
In time, Smith, Brown & Co. came to follow<br/>
the tips of the magnate. His customers made<br/>
money, and, as they always told their friends<br/>
about it, the clientele grew fast. The head<br/>
of the firm recognized that his position as a<br/>
"Keene broker," a "Gates broker," a "Hill<br/>
broker" or a "Harriman broker," as the case<br/>
might be, was the basis of his great sucess.<br/>
He kept in close touch with the magnate who<br/>
fed him. At last, generally at the top of a<br/>
big rise, the magnate began to hint of some<br/>
great thing to be accomplished. Perhaps<br/>
a stock dividend was to be declared; perhaps<br/>
it was an increase in the dividend to IO per<br/>
cent.; perhaps it was a great "deal" for some<br/>
ore lands; perhaps it was only a huge speculative pool that was to be formed. In any case,<br/>
the banker was led on to high hopes. He<br/>
handed them to his clients. They bought<br/>
thousands of shares of stock. They "made<br/>
the market," as they say in Wall Street.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the crash. Exactly this thing<br/>
happened in 1903, when nearly every great<br/>
commission house in Wall Street had become<br/>
identified more or less closely with one or<br/>
other of the great "special interests," and had<br/>
systematically "loaded" its customers with<br/>
the stocks of the interest to which the head of<br/>
the firm owed allegiance. To a far less extent<br/>
the same thing happened in the fall of 1906,<br/>
especially in the stocks that are roughly<br/>
grouped as "Harriman stocks" and "Hill<br/>
stocks." In each case, the things promised<br/>
by the magnates actually came to pass, but<br/>
they were not followed by further great rises<br/>
in price, but by terrible declines.<br/>
<br/>
It was at this point that the real body of the<br/>
Wall Street bankers broke away from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the financial kings, and swore anew<br/>
its old allegiance to the interests of the public<br/>
<br/>
