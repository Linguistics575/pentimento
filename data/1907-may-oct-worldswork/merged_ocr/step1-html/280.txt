EGYPT OLD AND NEW<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shiftlessness </span>and inefficiency still linger in the shadow of modern<br/>
improvements-but such scenes as this are far less common than<br/>
when <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lord </span>Cromer began his career as "adviser" to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive<br/>
<br/>

sympathy of all humane men, it is the Grand<br/>
Master of Ceremonies to His Highness the Khedive." Many other diplomats agree with him.<br/>

EGYPT AS CROMER LEFT IT<br/>
<br/>
Leaping over the space of <span style="color: #ff0000;">twcnty-five </span>years<br/>
of English occupation, let us glance at the<br/>
Egypt of 1007. Its condition <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>is more<br/>
than the measure of England's justification:<br/>
it is the measure of Lord Cromer as a builder<br/>
and as a man.<br/>
<br/>
Take the state of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>, for instance.<br/>
Cromer introduced into Egypt the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bank-ofEngland </span>kind of finance, as opposed to the<br/>
"high finance" of Ismail. He first did for<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>LIFT BRIDGE AND A LOCK<br/>
At the Nile Barrage<br/>
<br/>
the bankrupt country what Alexander <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamilton </span>did for the impoverished colonies in the<br/>
early days of our Republic-he put it <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>sound money basis. The revenues of last<br/>
year were double those of 1882, in spite of the<br/>
great reduction in taxation and the vast sums<br/>
expended in public works. The Canal shares<br/>
worth <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20,000,000 </span>when Cromer landed are<br/>
now worth more than $ 150,000,000. In 1882,<br/>
Egypt's 4 per cent. "unifieds" were selling at<br/>
less than 50; now 3 per cent. stocks are worth<br/>
100, or more. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Foreign </span>capital no longer fears<br/>
<br/>
