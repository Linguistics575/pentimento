and that of Mr. Carnegie dominate the business<br/>
life of the city that few men there will talk to<br/>
you about him. Much of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">reticence </span>is due<br/>
to sheer ignorance, for Mr. Frick has kept his<br/>
own counsels most discreetly<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tut </span>much of it,<br/>
as one may see from the faces of those one<br/>
questions about him, is due to an uneasy sense<br/>
of insecurity in talking about a man whose<br/>
power penetrates so nearly to every phase of<br/>
life of the city. He is in most of the financial<br/>
institutions of the city, he is the largest owner<br/>
of the city's real estate-his holdings are worth<br/>
many millions-he is powerful in steel, he is<br/>
one of Pittsburg's two "great" men, and the<br/>
more active of the two.<br/>

years, hardly more to him than a branch office,<br/>
his shadow falls heavily upon Wall Street.<br/>
His tremendous power is known, his intimate<br/>
alliances with the other great power of Standard<br/>
Oil and with the terrible energy of Harriman<br/>
are recognized.<br/>
<br/>
But Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rick </span>has yet the aloofness<br/>
of the great commander, of the man able to<br/>
stand alone. And there is something of dread<br/>
in the mental state of Wall Street regarding<br/>
him, for no one knows the final reach of his<br/>
ambition, nor the direction of its course. He<br/>
is the Silent Man, a mystery. He is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tremendous </span>power, for the moment in equilibrium,<br/>
poising, they think, for a final great sweep of<br/>
conquest.<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">CLEAN-HANDED </span>LOYALTY OF THE EMPLOYEES TO THEIR ROADS<br/>
<br/>
BY<br/>
<br/>
C. M. KEYS<br/>
<br/>
EARLY a million and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>half of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span>citizens of the United States are in<br/>
<br/>
the employ of the railroads. Out of<br/>
<br/>
every twenty adult males in the country, one<br/>
is a railroad employee.<br/>
<br/>
Against these men has arisen in the last two<br/>
or three years a general accusation touching<br/>
closely upon the personal honor of the entire<br/>
class. In every economic text-book concerning the railroad problem, there has been included an <span style="color: #0000FF;">insinuation-in </span>many cases a direct<br/>
statement-that the whole railroad business<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">honeycombed </span>with "graft," and depraved<br/>
by the lust for personal gain.<br/>
<br/>
The accusation arises out of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">longcontinued </span>exposure of the methods of <span style="color: #ff0000;">highfir1ance </span>in the exploitation of the railroads, the<br/>
equally damning evidence with regard to the<br/>
unearned increment that has accrued to the<br/>
promoters of the railroads, the established<br/>
facts with regard to money paid by the railroads for political <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>, and the equally<br/>
well-established charge of favoritism shown<br/>
at all times and under all conditions, lawful<br/>
and unlawful, to large shippers.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, a very eminent economist <span style="color: #0000FF;">has-lately<br/>
</span>made the statement that if one scratch the<br/>
railroad service anywhere, he reveals "graft."<br/>
<br/>
It is echoed in almost all the magazine and<br/>
newspaper comment on railroad matters<br/>
throughout the United States. It is therefore interesting to note that just at this<br/>
moment the "railroad man" has received<br/>
a vindication at the hands of a committee thoroughly well-qualified to issue <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>vindication.<br/>
<br/>
About a year ago arose a general outburst<br/>
of invective directed primarily at the men who<br/>
handle the railroad business of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pennsylvania </span>Railroad. It was based upon an<br/>
examination made by the Interstate Commerce<br/>
Commission into the conduct of a few minor<br/>
officials of that railroad in the matter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">distributing </span>cars to shippers. The indictment<br/>
spread far beyond the range outlined for it by<br/>
that investigation. It became, in fact, a<br/>
general indictment of the personal honor of the<br/>
American Railroad Man.<br/>
<br/>
The Pennsylvania Railroad appointed a<br/>
committee of <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>men to carry on an investigation. They have just handed down their<br/>
report. The committee consisted of Messrs.<br/>
C. Stuart Patterson, William H. Barnes,<br/>
Effingham B. Morris, Thomas De Witt Cuyler,<br/>
and Rudolph Ellis. All are men of a social<br/>
and business standing that makes it <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond<br/>
