<span style="color: #ff0000;">ENTION </span>the subject of medical fees<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>in the average group of men and you<br/>
will learn that the American doctor<br/>
is "out for'the money<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>-is a kind of licensed<br/>
pirate, overhauling every disabled patient that<br/>
enters the harbor of his office. Wherever an<br/>
article on the subject appears outside of the<br/>
medical press, which only physicians read,<br/>
such is generally the point of view. Whenever<br/>
a literary man is confronted with a doctor's<br/>
bill, railroad corporations and trust magnates<br/>
dwindle into pygmies beside the medical<br/>
"plunderbund," and the editor or writer finds<br/>
solace only in giving the doctor wide and<br/>
scathing publicity. But it is a long search to<br/>
find, in the protests against medical greed,<br/>
actual figures on which the man without a<br/>
grievance may base his judgment.<br/>
<br/>
It is a commonplace thing to hear men speak<br/>
of the exorbitant fees of to-day as a new development in our civilization-but our fathers and<br/>
our grandfathers and their grandfathers engaged in the same criticism. In a curious<br/>
examination of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>collection of the laws<br/>
of the Virginia Colony, I remember finding a<br/>
statute aimed at "divers <span style="color: #ff0000;">avaritious </span>and griping<br/>
practitioners in Physick and Surgery," a statute<br/>
which permitted the patient to have his doctor<br/>
arrested if he thought his bill too large. And<br/>
this rebellious attitude is extended also to other<br/>
bills in relation to sickness-the charges <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
druggist, of the trained nurse, and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">undertaker</span>--but the doctor is regarded as the archpirate<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>It is a strange fact that although life and good<br/>
health are priceless possessions, we begrudge<br/>
all that it costs us to preserve them. The<br/>
probable reason is that such payments seem<br/>
a dead loss; there is nothing to show for the<br/>
expenditure. Another curious fact is that the<br/>
size of the fee has little to do with the outcry.<br/>
The Arkansas farmer, whose doctor charges<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>a visit for a five-mile trip over a rough road,<br/>
howls as loudly as the New York business man<br/>
<br/>
who yields up $ 10 for a visit that he himself<br/>
made to the physician's <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>.<br/>
<br/>
THE DOCTOR'S POINT OF VIEW<br/>
<br/>
It is too much to expect that the day will ever<br/>
come when patient and doctor will be agreed<br/>
on the subject of fees. Their points of view<br/>
are too widely different. The physician, it is<br/>
true, refuses to be considered in the same light<br/>
as a business man or a lawyer, and insists that<br/>
he is a public servant; but he looks at his <span style="color: #0000FF;">income </span>as a whole, not on any particular fee.<br/>
He compares the number of his working hours<br/>
and his responsibilities with those of men of<br/>
equal standing in other lines; and then he contrasts his income with theirs. And what is<br/>
his conclusion?<br/>
<br/>
"One thing I am sure of," said one of the<br/>
most skilful and most conscientious surgeons<br/>
I ever knew-a man who has unquestionably<br/>
dragged scores and scores back from the borderland of death-" is that physicians are the<br/>
poorest paid of all the professions when you<br/>
consider the kind of service they render. A<br/>
doctor's bill is the last to be paid, and they<br/>
seldom do it with graciousness."<br/>
<br/>
This view is practically universal among<br/>
medical men-specialists, city doctors, country<br/>
practitioners, and all. It is simply a case<br/>
where the men who pay the bills think one<br/>
way, and the men on the job think another<br/>
way. The patient divides the number of<br/>
dollars he pays by the hours of service he<br/>
individually has received; the doctor divides<br/>
his receipts for the day by the hours of medical<br/>
service he has actually given.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor makes no secret of the fact that<br/>
he bases his charges partly on the service<br/>
rendered and partly on the patient's ability<br/>
to pay. The well-to-do classes resent this as<br/>
an injustice; the poorer classes ignore it and<br/>
complain equally loud; the doctor still insists<br/>
that the burden of his ministry to the suffering<br/>
poor should be shared by the well-to-do. If<br/>
