<br/>
</span>neighborhood friends, organized to bring some<br/>
decency into the next election and when he<br/>
himself was delegated to watch a certain polling<br/>
place. His duty had especial reference to the<br/>
toughs who hung about this booth, and it was<br/>
not long before a friend whispered to him that<br/>
one of the toughs was intimidating voters.<br/>
<br/>
"Which one?" Taft demanded.<br/>
<br/>
A deep flush had leaped from his collar to<br/>
his temples. He went rapidly toward the<br/>
man pointed out, a big stone mason, who<br/>
swaggered across the walk to meet him and<br/>
tried intimidation on him. He wanted to<br/>
know what Taft was doing around the polls,<br/>
anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
Boiling inwardly, but without a word, Taft<br/>
hit him and he sank in a heap.<br/>
<br/>
"Now then," said Taft, having removed the<br/>
cause of discord, "let's find out what's the<br/>
trouble here." That was his judicial mind at<br/>
work, even in a limited sphere.<br/>
<br/>
CHASTISEMENT OF A BLACKMAILER<br/>
<br/>
But what gave him more standing yet among<br/>
those who must respect the physical man first<br/>
if they are to respect a man at all was his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">chastisernent </span>of a formidable "slugger" named<br/>
Rose. The man had come to Cincinnati and<br/>
started a weekly blackmailing sheet. The<br/>
most respected citizens were not immune from<br/>
his scurrilous attacks, and the town lived from<br/>
one issue to the next in a state of fear and<br/>
trembling. Rose was a dangerous man to<br/>
handle, a prize-fighter, and thugs flanked him<br/>
round as a bodyguard. Then a filthy article<br/>
appeared about Taft's father. The old judge<br/>
was a man of stately dignity, though in no way<br/>
conscious of it; and he was so absent-minded,<br/>
aware of nothing but his work, his books, and<br/>
his home, that it was said of him that he knew<br/>
but three women by name in the neighborhood,<br/>
and one of these was his wife. Rose's scandalous article was therefore ridiculous, and no one<br/>
thought anything of it; no one, that is, except<br/>
Will <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>. But for him the libel was a criminal<br/>
offense against a member of his own family, and<br/>
to his mind criminal offenses are things to be<br/>
punished.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the article was brought to his attention, Will Taft called up his brother Charles,<br/>
who knew Rose by sight and could point him<br/>
out. Charles urged on Will the absurdity of<br/>
noticing the libel at all. Will replied that he<br/>
did not look at it in that way, and added that<br/>
he was going to find Rose at once. Charles<br/>
<br/>
9227<br/>
<br/>
tried to dissuade him, though knowing in his<br/>
heart that it was useless. The vibrant, <span style="color: #ff0000;">passionstrung </span>voice coming over the telephone told<br/>
him that much, and Charles at last said, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Well<br/>
then, I'll go along."<br/>
<br/>
The two brothers, the elder slender and prudent, the younger big and chafing and flushed<br/>
to the brow, were hurrying to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rose</span>'s sanctum,<br/>
when on the way they met the editor himself.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that the?" asked Will.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, that's the man," Charles replied.<br/>
<br/>
Will stepped quickly ahead of his brother,<br/>
and confronted the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blackmailer</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you Rose?" he demanded.<br/>
<br/>
But Rose had hardly nodded his head before<br/>
Taft had him by both shoulders, lifted him up,<br/>
and dashed him to the pavement. Instantly<br/>
the 2oo-odd pounds of Taft, knees first, came<br/>
down upon Rose, and Taft had him by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cars<br/>
</span>and was grinding his face into the pavement.<br/>
<br/>
"If you leave town to-night," said Taft,<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>'ll let you up."<br/>
<br/>
Rose sputtered promises, and thus unburdened himself of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">zoo-odd </span>pounds. "Now<br/>
then," said Taft, "I am coming down town<br/>
to-night, and if you are still here, then this<br/>
thing has only just started."<br/>
<br/>
But Rose kept his promise.<br/>
<br/>
There are also other legends of young<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>'s prowess in local political affairs, as of<br/>
his throwing out-doors a petty boss named<br/>
Fagin, who afterwards became his marshal.<br/>
<br/>
MR. TAFT'S PRACTICAL POLITICS<br/>
<br/>
But neither then nor since has he been a<br/>
man to endure gang rule, though he <span style="color: #0000FF;">does<br/>
</span>believe in party regularity. He frowns on<br/>
minor differences that might split his party<br/>
and hinder its activity in the doing of big<br/>
things for the country's good. But he sees no<br/>
good for his country in venal bossism, and he<br/>
fights bossism as he would knock down a<br/>
bully. He simply cannot endorse that kind of<br/>
a system of politics, and in this he frankly disagrees with his brother Charles, whose <span style="color: #ff0000;">TimesStar </span>is notoriously the "gang" paper in<br/>
Cincinnati. Less than two years ago, Secretary<br/>
Taft made a speech at Akron that helped to<br/>
drive this "gang," Cox included, out of power.<br/>
<br/>
With no "political order of mind," or <span style="color: #0000FF;">politiical </span>ambitions either, the young graduate<br/>
entered the political game with the same zest<br/>
as he had at Yale, the difference being that<br/>
civic duty took the place of college spirit. But<br/>
he was not the idealistic reformer<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>whom he<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
