<span>PENNSYLVANIA'S PALACE OF GRAFT<br/>

work. A clerk has <span style="color: #0000FF;">testified </span>that Huston gave<br/>
him Cobb's blue-prints to copy and locked<br/>
him up secure from intrusion while the copying<br/>
was going on. Cobb is threatening to sue the<br/>
state for the use of his design and for his commission as the architect. Whether the plans<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Huston</span>'s or Cobb's, the work went on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">apace</span>, and last summer the structure was<br/>
announced as finished, and within the appropriation. The Commission made much ado<br/>
over having on hand a balance of $ 35,000.<br/>
<br/>
HOW THE PLUNDERING WAS POSSIBLE<br/>
<br/>
There is in Pennsylvania a state board<br/>
charged with the care and repair of public<br/>
grounds and buildings, to which allusion has<br/>
already been made. It consists of the Governor, the State Treasurer, and the AuditorGeneral. In order to facilitate the discharge<br/>
of its duties, there is a convenient law on the<br/>
statute books authorizing it at any time to use<br/>
money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated. Coal might be needed for the state<br/>
officials' <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>, or new carpet for the legislative<br/>
chambers, and it was deemed proper that such<br/>
things should be available without any red<br/>
tape. One will notice that the three officers<br/>
intrusted with the duty and the power to use<br/>
funds are the three which would in any case<br/>
have to approve any account before payment<br/>
under any specific act. It was evidently felt<br/>
that there could hardly be any advantage taken<br/>
of this privilege to draw on the treasury by the<br/>
highest officers of the Commonwealth, all of<br/>
them elected by popular vote.<br/>
<br/>
It did not take the Capitol Commission long<br/>
to decide among themselves that the $ 4,000,000<br/>
turned over to them was for a building only,<br/>
although the act called for a structure completed ready for occupancy. The fittings and<br/>
furnishings must come out of some other fund.<br/>
It was to be a grand capitol, a magnificent and<br/>
gorgeous Aladdin creation, and $ 4,000,000 was<br/>
none too much. At the same time, it did not<br/>
seem expedient to go to the legislature for a<br/>
further appropriation for the furnishing. This<br/>
Grounds and Buildings Board, with an undefined right to draw on the state treasury,<br/>
supplied the one condition needed and its help<br/>
was enlisted. Its members also belonged to<br/>
the machine. Huston was made architect of<br/>
the furnishing also, and all things were thus<br/>
satisfactorily arranged for the game of graft.<br/>
After that, it was only necessary to get into the<br/>
treasury with a scoop shovel. There was no<br/>
<br/>
9239<br/>
<br/>
limit but the bottom. The same authority<br/>
that warranted the use of a five-dollar bill<br/>
covered the use of the last five-dollar bill of<br/>
all the millions of surplus.<br/>
<br/>
THE POWER OF THE MACHINE<br/>
<br/>
The political machine in 1901 had been able<br/>
to appropriate $ 4,000,000 to build a new capitol when its own agents <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>"completed"<br/>
one in 1899 for $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">550,000 </span>and the legislature<br/>
had squarely refused to give another dollar.<br/>
It was able to employ its own architect, let<br/>
the contract to its own favorities, and to start<br/>
a carnival of graft unparalleled. It was able<br/>
so to juggle the contract for furnishing that<br/>
John H. Sanderson (who secured the entire<br/>
contract) knew months before it was let that<br/>
he was going to get it, and began work on it.<br/>
It was able to let that contract to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">highestthe </span>only-bidder at prices that carried their<br/>
own condemnation on their face, and was able<br/>
also to keep them concealed. It was able to<br/>
substitute base and cheap metals for fine and<br/>
costly ones, cast work for lathe and hand-work,<br/>
lacquer instead of mercurial gold finish, and<br/>
to collect months in advance of delivery and<br/>
for much that was never furnished at all in any<br/>
finish. It was able to secure blank bill-heads<br/>
from sub-contractors and fill out fake bills<br/>
which were doubled and trebled and then<br/>
presented and paid without a word of objection.<br/>
It was able to use birch for mahogany, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">sub</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stitute </span>putty for <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand-carved </span>molding, to furnish Pittsburg glass instead of French Baccarat,<br/>
to measure air space by the cubic foot and sell<br/>
it to the state, to lay parquetry on cement and<br/>
Wilton on parquetry, to crowd unused rooms<br/>
with unusable supplies, to scamp and <span style="color: #0000FF;">botch<br/>
</span>and pretend in more ways than can be enumerated, and to draw money every time it<br/>
presented a piece of white paper. It was able<br/>
to levy for millions without any contract at all,<br/>
so far as has been shown.<br/>
<br/>
It was able also to close the eyes and seal<br/>
the mouths of men elected to the highest<br/>
places of trust, and to put forth reiterated<br/>
statements that the whole job had been done<br/>
within the appropriation; and later that the<br/>
state had the worth of its money; and when<br/>
that was proven false, that the money <span style="color: #ff0000;">didn't<br/>
</span>come out of the pockets of the people anyway,<br/>
but from corporations. It was able to arrange<br/>
for the architect to draw commissions for<br/>
"specially designed work" that was for sale<br/>
in unlimited quantities in the open market,<br/>
