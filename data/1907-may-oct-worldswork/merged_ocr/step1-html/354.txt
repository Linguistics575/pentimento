annum has an income equal to an income<br/>
from $ 30,000 of <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>per cent. bonds or stock, and<br/>
so on through the list of railroad employees.<br/>
<br/>
The railroad employees are an intelligent<br/>
class of citizens; and, as the railroad question, now being so vigorously discussed by the<br/>
legislatures and the people, is a campaign<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">cducation-which </span>is the only true method of<br/>
solving such a problem with fairness to all<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">interests-l </span>believe the voice of the employees,<br/>
individually and through their organizations,<br/>
will be steadily heard against unjust laws,<br/>
or laws that will unjustly injure their profession and retard the proper development of<br/>
the country, which means constant and increased employment to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>greater number of<br/>
men, and which furnishes safer tracks and <span style="color: #0000FF;">instrumentalities </span>in handling the passengers and<br/>
the commerce of the country.<br/>
<br/>
In point of fact, the thing that the shippers<br/>
and the people of this country now desire is<br/>
not so much reduction of rates as it is better<br/>
service. The people have a right to insist<br/>
that their service shall be constantly improved.<br/>

TRANSPLANTING A CITY'S POOR<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that the railroad managers<br/>
of the country will refuse to treat with the<br/>
people, through their representatives in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Congross</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">openly </span>and fairly on the question of how<br/>
the best result may be brought about, nor<br/>
hesitate to endorse a legislative policy that<br/>
promises better conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Railroad managers will not stand in the way<br/>
of just legislation merely because such legislation might have an adverse effect on railroad<br/>
securities in the market. We all recognize<br/>
that the true function of Wall Street is of<br/>
supreme importance to every section of the<br/>
United States. Without its agency we can<br/>
neither build, extend, nor improve our great<br/>
railroad properties to any large extent.<br/>
<br/>
The leading financial <span style="color: #0000FF;">interests</span>, in New York<br/>
and other money-centres, are coming to realize<br/>
that the only true basis of public confidence<br/>
in us and our securities must be found in closer<br/>
and more cordial relationship between the<br/>
people and the railroads and that the strong<br/>
arm of the Government is necessary to accomplish the most satisfactory results.<br/>

<br/>
</span>PRACTICAL METHOD OF RELIEVING <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE<br/>
<br/>
</span>CONGESTION OF ENGLISH CITIES AND PEOPLING A NEW LAND<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">BY<br/>
<br/>
</span>ELIZABETH A. HUNTER<br/>
<br/>
Sir F rederick Young, had been watching<br/>
his gardener transplanting the rank<br/>
growth of seedlings from the greenhouse to the<br/>
field. Suddenly he saw in that greenhouse a<br/>
picture of the modern city, with its congested<br/>
population, and in the wide <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>all those<br/>
thousands of acres which still may be found<br/>
lying idle, even in England. From that year<br/>
dates the cry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Back to the land." Men began<br/>
to see that the solution of one of the world's<br/>
great problems lay in "transplanting humanity." But how could this be done? <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>Salvation Army is answering the question.<br/>
Some twenty years later, General Booth<br/>
began to give the question consideration. In<br/>
1890, he made an experiment with a "back-tothe-land" colony at Hadleigh, near London.<br/>
In 1898, colonies were established at Fort<br/>
<br/>
IN 1869 an English political economist,<br/>
<br/>
Romie, Cal., and at Fort Amity, Col. The<br/>
sum of the instruction furnished by these three<br/>
transplantings amounted to this: Save for<br/>
rare exceptions, the habitual pauper cannot be<br/>
made to support himself, even on a treadmill.<br/>
But the man who is honestly willing, despite all<br/>
inexperience, can support himself several<br/>
times over when given his chance on the land.<br/>
The question was how best could he be given<br/>
the chance.<br/>
<br/>
The "Army's" Transportation Department<br/>
watched its experiments for five years longer<br/>
and then decided that it had found out. It<br/>
could not, perhaps, transfer the <span style="color: #ff0000;">man-willingto-work </span>directly to the land, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>could<br/>
transfer him to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>country where there was land<br/>
by the million acres to be had. In 1903, it<br/>
began to move selected emigrants from England<br/>
to Canada. By the end of 1905, it had brought<br/>
