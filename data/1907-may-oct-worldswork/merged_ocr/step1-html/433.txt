</span>who had voted for the bill, made 212 members<br/>
present, the number required for a quorum.<br/>
<br/>
Counsel for the importers argued that if a<br/>
member does not vote, he is not doing business,<br/>
and must be regarded as absent.<br/>
<br/>
Counsel for the Government thereupon<br/>
wished to know what good could be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplished </span>by compelling the attendance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">absentees </span>if by merely refusing to vote they could<br/>
break a quorum.<br/>

Well, to be brief, the young lawyer who had<br/>
the People of the United States for client won<br/>
again. In fact, he won for his august client<br/>
every time, and in the most important cases<br/>
of that Administration.<br/>
<br/>
During his three years as Solicitor-General,<br/>
Taft's newer and higher field of activity exacted<br/>
of him a versatility that would have exercised<br/>
even a much older legal brain. He had to<br/>
advise, and advise safely, all the different<br/>
executive departments on all the exasperating<br/>
puzzles of administrative procedure. He had<br/>
to take in accurate information now by wholesale. And yet he found the time to send long<br/>

</span>letters to his <span style="color: #ff0000;">ftther</span>, faithfully accounting for<br/>
himself and his work as a good steward should.<br/>
If his father were satisfied, he could trust the<br/>
people, his employers, to be even more so.<br/>
<br/>
As <span style="color: #0000FF;">Solicitor-General</span>, Taft had had <span style="color: #ff0000;">Opportunities </span>to spend himself, which he did unsparingly, in the indulgence of the passion of<br/>
his life-the doing of big things. Still very<br/>
young in years, he had done things that were<br/>
big nationally. But he had approached them<br/>
and mastered them with the simple directness and industry and thoroughness with which<br/>
he had learned lessons in school. They were<br/>
tasks set before him, and for the time they were<br/>
all in all. Yet here in Washington, as at home,<br/>
he impressed men as being <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>power apart from<br/>
the immediate thing in hand. This useful<br/>
citizen was palpably capable of higher usefulness, and when he returned to Cincinnati,<br/>
he returned as he had left, a judge, but now a<br/>
Federal Judge, on the Circuit Bench of the<br/>
United States; and of a Circuit, too, that had<br/>
risen to the habit of graduating its judges to<br/>
the Supreme Bench of the Nation.<br/>

ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL OR REVERSE THE FORCES THAT BRING OLD AGE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">BY<br/>
</span>DR. EDWARD A. AYERS<br/>
<br/>
stay the hand of time, but it has dis<br/>
covered much that is upsetting to our<br/>
ancient ideas on the fundamental causes of<br/>
growth and decay, and has even gained some<br/>
insight into the possibilities of reversing the life<br/>
process, whereby age might grow back to youth.<br/>
It is a very fascinating suggestion that man,<br/>
by "taking thought," can add a cubit to his<br/>
stature, or move back from the shriveling of<br/>
age to the bloom and freshness of youth! There<br/>
is much nonsense cropping out in the newspapers about the discoveries of such scientists<br/>
as Professor Loeb, slight hints being projected<br/>
by vivid imaginations to conclusions still far,<br/>
far away.<br/>
<br/>
One needs a lot of bottle feeding in the<br/>
nursery of science before it is easy to discuss<br/>
such ultimate questions as control over advancing age. A host of queries arises: What<br/>
<br/>
SCIENCE has not found out how to<br/>
<br/>
is life? What is the process by which a little<br/>
cell <span style="color: #ff0000;">1-r25th-inch </span>wide can grow into a big,<br/>
complex creature like a man, or an elephant,<br/>
or a whale, or a humming-bird, as the case<br/>
may be? What is it that causes a senseless,<br/>
unconscious bit of life-producing <span style="color: #0000FF;">putty-protoplasm-to </span>move? Why do the pale and<br/>
sickly shoots growing from potatoes in a dark<br/>
cellar reach toward the only light that comes<br/>
through the cellar door? Why will entire<br/>
limbs grow out from the stumps of amputated<br/>
limbs in some forms of lowly animal life, while<br/>
man is given but one chance to sue a railroad<br/>
for the loss of his leg? What is this seeming<br/>
intelligence that causes newly hatched chickens,<br/>
with absolutely no experience, to move unerringly to food? Is instinct becoming defined?<br/>
What has crystallization to do with life <span style="color: #0000FF;">formation</span>? What part in the great drama is<br/>
assigned to the activities of bacteria?<br/>
