<span>8828 <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE<br/>
<br/>
</span>MORE OPERA AND MANY MORE PLAYS<br/>
<br/>
HIS past season of grand opera in New<br/>
York has proved that classic music is<br/>
appreciated by a far wider range of people than<br/>
the purveyors of opera<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>had supposed. The<br/>
performances, under Mr. Heinrich Conried's<br/>
management at the Metropolitan Opera House<br/>
have been conducted on the theory that opera<br/>
is a luxury of the rich and an adjunct of fashion<br/>
and can be supported only by their patronage.<br/>
Mr. Oscar Hammerstein, however, proceeded<br/>
upon the theory that most of the musical appreciation is found in the galleries. Thus, when<br/>
he opened the Manhattan Opera House last<br/>
winter, he had no subscription list for boxes,<br/>
and he set the price of seats at a lower average<br/>
than that of the Metropolitan. The quality<br/>
of the music and of the productions he has<br/>
offered has been generally considered <span style="color: #0000FF;">equal </span>to<br/>
that of the Metropolitan, in spite of the more<br/>
distinguished names of the singers at the older<br/>
house. The great success of the Manhattan<br/>
has justified Mr. Hammerstein's faith in his<br/>
theory. His house has become the centre of<br/>
the best popular opera <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the country. And<br/>
the fact that the Metropolitan has suffered<br/>
little from the competition indicates that the<br/>
healthy growth of musical appreciation has made<br/>
another opera house a necessity in New York.<br/>
<br/>
A similar condition exists among the theatres.<br/>
The two large theatrical combinations and the<br/>
many smaller managers have barely succeeded<br/>
this year in supplying the demand for theatrical<br/>
amusements. There are more than seventy<br/>
theatres in New York City alone, and these<br/>
have all been crowded.<br/>
<br/>
This enormous public demand for music<br/>
and the drama argues a great increase in <span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperity</span>. With this must come, let us hope, also<br/>
higher standards of taste, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and-perhaps-better </span>American plays.<br/>
<br/>
THE JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION<br/>
<br/>
HE Jamestown Exposition will emphasize Virginia history-will, in fact,<br/>
inform a large part of the people that there is<br/>
such a thing as three hundred years of Virginia history. For the historical part of the<br/>
Exposition will be its most attractive feature to<br/>
the thoughtful visitor. To the larger company of sightseers, the almost continuous<br/>
naval pageant, in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">the.ships </span>of all the<br/>
principal governments will take part, will<br/>
make the strongest appeal. Beautifully situated directly on Hampton Roads, compact,<br/>
<br/>
and easy of access, this fair is likely to be<br/>
visited by great throngs of persons during the<br/>
six months that it will be open; for it will<br/>
have the attraction of a seashore resort for the<br/>
inland millions.<br/>
<br/>
Drawn by an historical interest, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">descendants </span>of the Virginians are expected from every<br/>
part of the Union. The streams of them that<br/>
come may suggest for the first time to the<br/>
present generation the great part that the<br/>
colony and the state has played in our history.<br/>
How prolific a mother Virigina has been, is<br/>
even yet an untold chapter in our history.<br/>
<br/>
THE RISE OF THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
AT ONCE the most cheerful and important<br/>
<br/>
fact of the time is the development of<br/>
the Southern States which is now going on at a<br/>
most gratifying pace-and with it, of course,<br/>
the multiform development of the people.<br/>
This takes its place in importance alongside<br/>
of the settlement and development of the<br/>
Middle West, which was one of the most<br/>
important social and economic facts of the<br/>
last century. It was this that made the<br/>
United States a great and rich country and<br/>
saved to mankind the benefits of free institutions and applied them over a large area.<br/>
<br/>
Now the long-looked-for time is come-almost suddenly-when the rich and vast<br/>
area of the South is coming under similar<br/>
conquest, by the very people, too-or their<br/>
descendants-who have dwelt there since this<br/>
region became American. Industrial forces<br/>
have come into action, after a long period of<br/>
waiting and hindrance, that are fast making<br/>
these states realize the riches that have awaited<br/>
development. Wealth, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eheerfulness</span>, and energy<br/>
are bringing the land and the people out of<br/>
isolation and into the full current of American<br/>
life. This is the great social and economic<br/>
fact for us, at least, of this decade-perhaps<br/>
of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-century</span>.<br/>
<br/>
For this reason, THE WORLD'S WORK for<br/>
June will give most of its space to a description<br/>
of this progress; for we believe that thus to report it and to emphasize it is as great a public<br/>
service as a journal given to the interpretation<br/>
of well-directed activity can do. The story<br/>
is so large that only specimen chapters of it<br/>
can be told in any magazine. But these specimen chapters, it is hoped, will be enough to<br/>
show that the most interesting great movement now going on in our country is this rise<br/>
of the Southern people<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
