ORIGINAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">NARRATIVES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>HISTORY<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">An </span>historical work of unique interest, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">glut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">value</span>, is the series of Original <span style="color: #0000FF;">Narratives </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lin-ly </span>American History, now being reproduced<br/>
by Charles Scribner's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sons </span>under the auspices<br/>
of the American Historical Association. Dr.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J. </span>Franklin <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jameson</span>, director of the department of historical research in the Carnegie<br/>
Institution of Washington, is the editor of the<br/>
series. These volumes will be literal reproductions of the earliest editions of the books<br/>
written by the original explorers and founders<br/>
of America prior to the year 1700. Of such<br/>
books as appeared originally in foreign languages the best available translations will be<br/>
used. The idea is to set before students and<br/>
general readers the fresh and vivid words of<br/>
the people who were eye witnesses of the birth<br/>
of our country-the sources from which all<br/>
modern historians have drawn the material for<br/>
their works. But, as the editor says, "no subsequent sources can have quite the intellectual<br/>
interest, none quite the sentimental value,<br/>
which attaches to these early narrations,<br/>
springing directly from the brains and hearts of<br/>
the nation's founders." Of this series there<br/>
have already been issued, "The Northmen,<br/>
Columbus, and Cabot, <span style="color: #ff0000;">98ii-r503</span>," edited by<br/>
Prof. Julius E. Olson of the University of<br/>
Wisconsin and Prof. Edward G. Bourne of<br/>
Yale; and "Early English and <span style="color: #0000FF;">French<br/>
</span>Voyages," edited by the Rev. Dr. Henry S.<br/>
Burrage. Other volumes in preparation are<br/>
"The Spanish Explorers in the Southern<br/>
United States," <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Champlain's Voyages," <span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Narratives </span>of Early Virginia," "Bradford's History<br/>
of Plymouth Plantation," "Narratives of New<br/>
Netherland," "Johnson's Wonder-Working<br/>
Providence of Sion's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Savior </span>in New England,"<br/>
and "Narratives of Early Maryland." These<br/>
volumes are sold at $ 3 net, apiece.<br/>
<br/>
Another historical series is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">American<br/>
</span>Nation, a History," edited by Dr. Albert <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bushnell </span>Hart, Professor of American History in<br/>
Harvard University. The development of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>United States has here been traced according<br/>
to the clearly defined periods into which, upon<br/>
scientific analysis, it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen </span>to fall; and each<br/>
period has been treated in a separate volume,<br/>
written by a trained specialist in the history of<br/>
that period, who has studied the original<br/>
