THE CANADIAN PACIFIC CROSSING A CLEFT<br/>

ledges, sticking them to the mountain sides as<br/>
a swallow builds her nest; there, again, they<br/>
sluiced great rifts in the hills to fill their trestles<br/>
with gravel.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes these mountain roads turn round<br/>
upon themselves, making great loops merely<br/>
to gain a few feet of climb. To make two<br/>
miles, the Canadian Pacific train in one <span style="color: #0000FF;">place<br/>
</span>travels nearly seven miles, and turns enough<br/>

corners to make twelve complete circles. At<br/>
Georgetown, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Col.</span>, the Union Pacific gains a<br/>
few yards of height by a great loop; and this<br/>
is a method that is not at all uncommon. The<br/>
Gothard Tunnel, in Europe, makes two <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>circles in the very heart of the mountain<br/>
itself. It is on the principle of a spiral, and is<br/>
only used to overcome a rise too sharp to be<br/>
surmounted by any direct line that could be<br/>

THE ROAD THROUGH PLATTE CANYON, COLO.<br/>
The result of high grade engineering skill<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest difficulties that confront<br/>
the construction engineer is the rift in the<br/>
mountain side. If the road is following a<br/>
ledge along the cliff and comes suddenly upon<br/>
a great deep chasm running far into the hill,<br/>
heroic methods are needed. Across such a<br/>
