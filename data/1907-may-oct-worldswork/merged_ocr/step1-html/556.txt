<span>9354 TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
border to border. One morning there rushed<br/>
in upon the Judge's secretary a haggard and<br/>
feverish man. He was attorney for the appellants, and he wanted to see the Judge. He<br/>
had not slept, he said, because just too late he<br/>
had remembered that he should have filed his<br/>
papers for an appeal the day before. His<br/>
time had expired, and he almost knew that for<br/>
his negligence his case would be thrown out,<br/>
though it was at the discretion of the Judge to<br/>
extend the time. Judge Taft, whom he had<br/>
never seen, had not yet come. But what kind<br/>
of a man was the Judge, he asked anxiously.<br/>
The secretary smiled and asked him to wait<br/>
patiently. He waited, but not patiently. He<br/>
did not dare expect leniency. At last, the<br/>
secretary heard a whistling down the corridor,<br/>
someone whistling "My Country."<br/>
<br/>
"That' s the Judge now," said the secretary.<br/>
"He always whistles that. "<br/>
<br/>
Then there entered Cincinnati' s lovable<br/>
citizen, smiling and happy, as he always was.<br/>
The uneasy attorney stammeringly introduced himself.<br/>
<br/>
"Why," exclaimed the Judge, "I was afraid<br/>
that you were going to let that case go by<br/>
default. But I'm glad you came, sir. Got<br/>
your papers ready?"<br/>
<br/>
The dumfounded lawyer did not know his<br/>
papers from his hat. He could not believe his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cars</span>. But in less time than he would have<br/>
taken in explaining, his papers were accepted,<br/>
the case set, and the lawyer's mind set at rest.<br/>
On his way out he stopped at the secretary's<br/>
desk. "What a man he isl" he murmured.<br/>
"Another judge would have thrown my case<br/>
out. Oh, what a man he is!"<br/>

<br/>
</span>A JUDGE UNAFFECTED BY <span style="color: #0000FF;">INFLUENCE</span>"<br/>
<br/>
Once, in a bank case, Judge Taft decided<br/>
against ex-District Attorney Herron, his <span style="color: #ff0000;">fatherin-law</span>. It is said that the old gentleman was<br/>
exceedingly wroth over that decision. He was<br/>
positive that he was right. But Judge Taft only<br/>
laughed, and Mr. Herron appealed. And his<br/>
son-in-law was sustained.<br/>
<br/>
Judge Taft as serenely went against his own<br/>
party. During the Goebel troubles in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kentucky</span>, suit was brought in his court by the<br/>
Republicans to get their man declared <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor</span>. But Lawrence Maxwell, on the other side,<br/>
raised the point that the Federal Courts had no<br/>
jurisdiction. Judge Taft found the point well<br/>
taken, and sent the case back to the Kentucky<br/>
state courts. There were many Republicans<br/>
<br/>
who thought that Judge Taft might have<br/>
strained this point for the sake of the party.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the hardest task of all was for a man<br/>
of Taft's sensitive delicacy to maintain his<br/>
independence on the Bench even against the<br/>
seeming exactions of hospitality. In 1897-8,<br/>
before the present good times, five or six Ohio<br/>
railroads were in receivers' hands. Judge<br/>
Taft heard that some of these receivers were<br/>
permitting rebates, and he summoned them<br/>
before him. Among them was Myron T.<br/>
Herrick, later Governor of Ohio. Mr. Herrick<br/>
and Judge Taft were old friends. It was<br/>
Taft who had appointed Herrick to one of the<br/>
receiverships. On arriving in Cincinnati, Mr.<br/>
and Mrs. Herrick were most cordially entertained by Judge and Mrs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>. The next<br/>
day Mr. Herrick went to the Judge's office on<br/>
the business in hand.<br/>
<br/>
"Myron," asked the Judge, "have you been<br/>
rebating?"<br/>
<br/>
Herrick laid down a statement showing<br/>
some $ 80,000 that had been paid to shippers.<br/>
<br/>
The Judge was visibly shocked. He looked<br/>
so stern that Herrick quaked before him.<br/>
<br/>
"Myron," he said, "if you have done this<br/>
thing, you cannot be permitted to <span style="color: #0000FF;">escape</span>."<br/>
<br/>
On the Bench, he was no longer "Bill"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>. He sustained the dignity of the Court,<br/>
and it is declared that he was hardest on his<br/>
friends. Luckily for Mr. Herrick, the $ 80,000<br/>
had been paid because of a moral obligation<br/>
to the shippers, an obligation inherited by the<br/>
receivership that could not in justice be evaded.<br/>
For Mr. Herrick, it was a manner of paying<br/>
off a debt that had been contracted, and was<br/>
not rebating at all.<br/>
<br/>
The Judge gave a great sigh of relief.<br/>
"Well, that is different," he said, and after a<br/>
little there was his jolly laugh again. "Please<br/>
hereafter let me settle judicial questions," he<br/>
added. "I will enter an order for the payment<br/>
of these claims, which are unquestionably just.<br/>
You have taken a great load off my mind, for<br/>
I should not have liked to convict you of<br/>
rebating."<br/>
<br/>
When the receivership of this railroad was<br/>
applied for, Judge Taft declined to appoint<br/>
anyone connected with the road, or interested<br/>
in it even, though a certain man was urged by<br/>
ex-President Harrison. It was then that Mr.<br/>
Herrick was named. This indicates an absolute impartiality when dealing with public<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Judge Taft would accept no favors from any<br/>
