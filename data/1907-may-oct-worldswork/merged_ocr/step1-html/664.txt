<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9462 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">DAWN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NEW<br/>
</span>quite different from one in this country. A<br/>
discordant brass band marches at the head of<br/>
the men when they start for work at daybreak.<br/>
"There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town<br/>
To-night" is the tune, and the men know<br/>
every note of it, for it is played at the Sunday<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cock-fights</span>, in the churches, for dances, and<br/>
even at funerals.<br/>
<br/>
Gaily the men troop along, whistling with the<br/>
band or shouting in a sorry attempt to pronounce the English words. Loin-cloth and<br/>
straw hat suffice for clothing, and their beautifully moulded bodies shine like burnished<br/>
copper. Arriving at a great cut in a mountain<br/>
side, they are handed their time checks by the<br/>
foremen, who are also natives, and work begins<br/>
in earnest. The band takes up its station<br/>
under a cacao tree and keeps the music going.<br/>
A young college man in charge of the camp<br/>
gallops up on a flea-bitten pony and climbs to<br/>
a high platform from which he can watch the<br/>
progress of the work. The tropical sun beats<br/>
down with the heat of a blast furnace, and<br/>
naked water-boys with hides of water and<br/>
cocoanut cups pass among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">toilers</span>. Earth<br/>
and rock are loaded into small cars and pushed<br/>
down a snaky track to be dumped into a ravine<br/>
two hundred yards away.<br/>
<br/>
When the whistle blows at noon, the foremen<br/>
distribute peseta pieces to the workers, who<br/>
quickly pass them over to the crude lunch<br/>
"shacks" for a wholesome meal of rice and<br/>
boiled vegetables. When natives were first<br/>
hired, it was noticed that they would "loaf"<br/>
around at noon without eating, and were unfit<br/>
for work in the afternoon. They were told<br/>
through an interpreter that they should use a<br/>
part of their wages for lunch, but they were not<br/>
impressed with the plan. Finally an ingenious American hit upon the scheme of doling<br/>
out a <span style="color: #0000FF;">peseta </span>at noon for lunch, and there was<br/>
no more trouble.<br/>
<br/>
After the mid-day heat has somewhat abated,<br/>
work starts again. The bandmaster quickens<br/>
the tempo like a cockswain hitting up the stroke<br/>
in a'varsity race, and the men charge the<br/>
mountain side with yells, swinging picks in<br/>
time with the music. As darkness falls they<br/>
return to camp, chattering and placing bets on<br/>
the next cock-fight. The camp is laid out in<br/>
streets with military precision, with neatly<br/>
thatched nipa huts for the men and roomy tents<br/>
for the Americans in charge. The camp site<br/>
is well drained and has a hospital tent with<br/>
white cots and a trained nurse.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ERA<br/>
<br/>
</span>IN THE PHILIPPINES<br/>
<br/>
A long, thatched building filled with tables<br/>
is the rendezvous of the men at night. Here<br/>
they are served with a well-cooked supper.<br/>
Then the wives and children of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Filipinos</span>,<br/>
resplendent in gay calicos, dance until 10:30,<br/>
when all the workmen are sent to <span style="color: #0000FF;">bed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>While the dance is in progress, some stocky<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Igorrote</span>, attired in a loin-cloth and battered<br/>
derby hat, cautiously lifts the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flap </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">head</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>quarters tent, where the engineers are figuring<br/>
up the pay-roll. Edging up to the interpreter,<br/>
he begins a plaintive recital. The interpreter<br/>
listens with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
"He's been up in the hills, burying his grandmother," he said, turning to the chief.<br/>
<br/>
"What's your number?" asks the chief.<br/>
<br/>
A brass tag about the man's neck supplies<br/>
the .information. Turning to his book, the<br/>
timekeeper looks up the man's record.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, I'll let him off this time; it's only the<br/>
ninth that I have record of!"<br/>
<br/>
The Filipino clings to the "grandmother<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fable </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>and uses it blandly upon every occasion.<br/>
It is difficult to keep him at work during the<br/>
entire month; once or twice during that period<br/>
he disappears for a couple of days, but he<br/>
invariably returns to work with the time-worn<br/>
explanation.<br/>
<br/>
This camp is duplicated at intervals along<br/>
the 600 miles of railroad now under construction, each camp presided over by a young<br/>
American, recruited from Purdue, Illinois,<br/>
Wisconsin, Cornell, Massachusetts "Tech.,"<br/>
and other technical colleges. Nearly all have<br/>
had several years of practical railroading under<br/>
the best builders and operators in the country,<br/>
and they are demonstrating what young<br/>
engineers can do when thrown upon their own<br/>
resources thousands of miles from home.<br/>
<br/>
THE NATIVE AS A WORKMAN<br/>
<br/>
The Filipino was not a promising laborer.<br/>
An American contractor who converted the<br/>
old horse-car lines of Manila into a model<br/>
electric system advertised for laborers; when<br/>
several hundred had been gathered in, they<br/>
were offered inducements to start at once.<br/>
A shaking of heads and mutterings in several<br/>
dialects was translated by the interpreters into<br/>
a refusal to begin without having first been paid<br/>
the week's wage. It seems that it had been<br/>
customary during the Spanish regime to engage<br/>
Filipinos to perform certain work, upon the<br/>
completion of which they were paid only a<br/>
portion of the promised sum or dismissed<br/>
