</span>dimes. This waste is paid by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">policy-holders<br/>
</span>and diminishes the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span>that they receive.<br/>
There is thus every reason to desire a more<br/>
economical system of insurance for small<br/>
amounts.<br/>
<br/>
The Massachusetts Savings Insurance<br/>
League proposed to remedy this evil by allowing every savings bank to esta blish an insurance<br/>
department and to sell <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>insurance policies<br/>
in sums of <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>and less at cost, thereby giving<br/>
the depositors the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span>in life insurance<br/>
that they have in the custody of their savings.<br/>
A bill to that <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>was submitted by the<br/>
League to the Massachusetts Legislature and<br/>
has become a law. There are to be no agents,<br/>
solicitors, or collectors for the insurance department any more than for the savings department. The same trustees will have charge<br/>
of both. The same <span style="color: #ff0000;">othees </span>will serve both<br/>
departments. The same supervision and <span style="color: #ff0000;">rtstrietions </span>in regard to investments, accounting,<br/>
interest and profits will apply to both. Any<br/>
depositor in a savings bank can have his life<br/>
insurance in connection with his deposits and his<br/>
premiums charged to his deposit. He has<br/>
simply to show physical <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitness</span>. A separate<br/>
account is to be kept of the savings funds and of<br/>
the insurance funds; and any savings bank<br/>
desiring to do an insurance <span style="color: #0000FF;">business </span>must<br/>
provide a special expense and <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurance<br/>
</span>guarantee fund which must be kept intact.<br/>
The form of policy wilt be prepared by a state<br/>
actuary who will also prepare a table of rates<br/>
and, in connection with the state medical<br/>
director, will prescribe the rules for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">acceptability </span>of the applicants.<br/>
<br/>
This is a most interesting experiment.<br/>
It will enable the same class of working people<br/>
to whom the savings banks have been so beneficial to insure their lives and the lives of<br/>
members of their families on terms that are<br/>
economically sound. The League has not only<br/>
secured the passage of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">act</span>, but has induced<br/>
many leading savings banks to announce their<br/>
intention to avail themselves of it. It is composed of two former governors, two bishops,<br/>
a mayor, two judges, the president of the<br/>
Boston Central Labor Union, the president<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Associated </span>Charities, the chairman of<br/>
the Good Government Association, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Harvard<br/>
professor, the secretary of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Children</span>'s Aid<br/>
Society and <span style="color: #0000FF;">several </span>bankers, business men and<br/>
lawyers. The best way to solve <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>pressing<br/>
economic and social problems is for such men<br/>
as these to get together and undertake them<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
</span>N' INTERESTING and possibly practical suggestion has been made by our<br/>
Consul <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Hanover, Germany, that picked<br/>
groups <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>American manufacturers make <span style="color: #0000FF;">ex</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cursions </span>to foreign countries to promote trade.<br/>
A tour should be carefully laid out. Accurate<br/>
information about al' places to be visited<br/>
should be compiled in advance. Arrangements<br/>
should be made for the reception of the visitors<br/>
so that they may get accurate local information<br/>
on their arrival. The suggestion goes on:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Some </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span>that may be gained by such a<br/>
trip <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>an interesting, valuable and pleasurable voyage,<br/>
educational advantages in the way of <span style="color: #0000FF;">broadening </span>the view<br/>
of the American manufacturer, direct business secured<br/>
and acquaintance established, the study of markets, <span style="color: #0000FF;">.needs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>methods, and processes of foreign manufacturers and<br/>
merchants<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">awakening </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sentiments </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">favoring<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reciprocal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trade </span>relations generally.<span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>This is a plan that, like most plans, will<br/>
depend wholly upon the wisdom with which<br/>
it shall be carried out. If the right kind of<br/>
American manufacturers go to countries and<br/>
cities where markets for their products can be<br/>
built up or enlarged, and if they study local<br/>
conditions and even local prejudices sympathetically, it would be hard to overstate the benefits<br/>
that might follow. American manufacturers<br/>
or the trading companies through which they<br/>
work already have agents or send salesmen to<br/>
all important markets; but agents and <span style="color: #0000FF;">salesmen<br/>
</span>are not themselves manufacturers, and there is<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference</span>. One hindrance to the growth of<br/>
our foreign trade in many markets is the<br/>
ignorance of those markets in <span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>factories.<br/>
