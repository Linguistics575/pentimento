<span>9160 THE MARCH<br/>
leaders-stood in dead earnest for opposing<br/>
policies. <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>you were a Republican, you were<br/>
a protectionist; and, if you were a Democrat,<br/>
(in spite of Mr. Randall and Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">German<br/>
</span>and a few other such men) you were a radical<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tariff-reformcr</span>, perhaps even a <span style="color: #0000FF;">free-trader</span>.<br/>
Mr. Cleveland's second election was the<br/>
triumph of this latter party principle. It meant<br/>
this emphatically and it had no other meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the economic breakdown of the<br/>
Democratic Party. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">vilified </span>Mr. Cleveland;<br/>
it took up the free coinage of silver; it accepted<br/>
the leadership of Mr. Bryan. In a word, it<br/>
lost economic character and standing among<br/>
the thoughtful political parties of the world. It<br/>
became a <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>crank" party. The sound business<br/>
and financial interests of the whole country<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>necessarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrayed </span>against it. This<br/>
was enough to defeat <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>But the damage done by a breakdown in<br/>
economic character by one party was, of course,<br/>
not confined to that one party. It is almost<br/>
always true that when one party breaks down<br/>
in character, the other does too. The massing<br/>
of all the strong industrial, commercial, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>interests in the opposing party brought<br/>
the inevitable result of strong <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>management into politics-in a word, brought Mr.<br/>
Hanna and his unprecedented use of money in<br/>
campaigns; and along with this came the still<br/>
greater power in politics and in government<br/>
of the great financial interests. Had they<br/>
not saved the country and was the government<br/>
not properly theirs? <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r. </span>Hanna himself went<br/>
into the Senate and leadership in Congress<br/>
passed more and more completely into the<br/>
hands of representatives of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial<br/>
</span>and transportation interests.<br/>
<br/>
President McKinley saw clearly the wrong<br/>
and the danger of this excessive special privilege<br/>
and therefore of special power; and, when his<br/>
death occurred, he was gradually preparing<br/>
the way for an effort to correct the most<br/>
glaring inequalities of the tariff-in other<br/>
words, to give his party again a party policy.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Roosevelt has gone toward the same<br/>
large purpose of freeing the government from<br/>
undue control by the great interests, but he<br/>
has gone about it in a different way. Any<br/>
change in the tariff must be legislative. But<br/>
Mr. Roosevelt in his characteristic effort to<br/>
enforce the laws found pressing executive tasks<br/>
which led to the lessening of the grasp of great<br/>
corporations on undue <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit </span>and power; and<br/>
he has proceeded toward the same large <span style="color: #0000FF;">pur<br/>
</span>OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
pose by making the executive department<br/>
energetic-by enforcing laws that had been<br/>
already enacted and by insisting on <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortifying<br/>
</span>them by supplementary legislation. This has<br/>
been a swifter and a more direct attack on<br/>
privilege than trying to reform the tariff, and<br/>
a method more in keeping with Mr. Roosevelt's<br/>
temperament. And he has given his party a<br/>
policy-the restraint of corporations <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span>injustice and from undue political power.<br/>
<br/>
All this activity has strengthened the party<br/>
at least so long as it shall have earnest instead<br/>
of merely machine leadership. And the question now is whether it will hold to this policy,<br/>
as a party.<br/>
<br/>
But in the meantime, unfortunately for both<br/>
parties, <span style="color: #ff0000;">y </span>the Democrats have not developed<br/>
a leader since Mr. Cleveland who can <span style="color: #0000FF;">command </span>the confidence of the commercial and<br/>
financial world; and they have no united<br/>
earnestness about any policy. In spite of the<br/>
apparently growing objection to Mr. Bryan,<br/>
shown by the Democratic press, there is yet<br/>
visible no other Democrat of national reputation whom the party seems likely to nominate.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">here </span>would be no use in putting forward<br/>
another unknown man such as Judge Parker<br/>
was. While the party has, of course, recovered<br/>
from its old lapse into the fatal error of <span style="color: #0000FF;">advo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eating </span>free <span style="color: #0000FF;">silver </span>coinage, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>has not yet come<br/>
back to the positive and courageous position<br/>
that it took under Mr. Cleveland's leadership.<br/>
<br/>
Thus it has come about that the parties, as<br/>
parties, are of little account. The Republican<br/>
Party, which lost its character by complete<br/>
surrender to the Great Interests under the<br/>
Hanna management, has been saved by Mr.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Roosevelt</span>'s activity and by Democratic <span style="color: #ff0000;">ineffieieney</span>; but what positive qualities of character<br/>
it will have, after Mr. Roosevelt retires from<br/>
the White House, will depend wholly upon its<br/>
future leadership. If the same kind of men<br/>
get control of it again as had control when Mr.<br/>
Roosevelt became President, it will provoke<br/>
a great contest of classes. It will breed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Debses<br/>
</span>and Hearsts.<br/>
<br/>
Thus in either party it is the character and<br/>
the personality of the leaders that will count<br/>
for everything next year. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>would be fortunate if the Democrats should show courage and<br/>
convictions by making an earnest platform<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">tariff </span>revision and nominate a man of such<br/>
vigor as to demonstrate the party's earnestness<br/>
and of such balance as to command the economic respect of mankind. Then the <span style="color: #0000FF;">party<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
