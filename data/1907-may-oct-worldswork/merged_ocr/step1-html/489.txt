<br/>
resolve should be done. That this kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">activity </span>is more lasting than sentimental platitudes<br/>
and more binding than oratory is shown by<br/>
the well-known fact that the originator of the<br/>
idea of a Peace Conference was one of the first<br/>
rulers to engage in a bloody war, and by the<br/>
further fact that on the day the Czar's representative opened the present Conference his<br/>
imperial master was in the act of dissolving<br/>
the Russian parliament.<br/>
<br/>
The practical results of the present Conference are not limited to the list of articles that<br/>
will eventually appear as having been adopted.<br/>
Since the preservation of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">workfs </span>peace<br/>
depends chiefly on a strong international sentiment against war, the fact that a topic was<br/>
seriously debated in this Conference is itself<br/>
both significant and hopeful. Here are some<br/>
of the results of which we may hope to reap<br/>
the benefit:<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">r</span>) Sooner or later, we shall see a <span style="color: #0000FF;">permanent </span>court of arbitration which will be in a<br/>
real sense "the Supreme Court of the World."<br/>
Before this court will come the nations with<br/>
their quarrels, just as individuals now appear<br/>
before lesser courts.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Governments will cease to use their<br/>
armies and navies in the collection of private<br/>
debts unless payment be refused after the<br/>
Hague Tribunal has approved the validity of<br/>
such claims. This is the American <span style="color: #0000FF;">modification </span>of "the Drago doctrine."<br/>
<br/>
(3) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Unfortified </span>towns shall not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">born</span>,<br/>
barded at all.<br/>
<br/>
(4) Churches, hospitals, monuments, and<br/>
so on, when marked in a manner agreed upon,<br/>
shall be spared in the bombardment of a<br/>
fortified city.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>) Merchant vessels and other private<br/>
property at sea must for the present remain<br/>
exposed to capture, but there is a growing<br/>
<br/>
9287<br/>
<br/>
sentiment among the nations that such property<br/>
should be made immune.<br/>
<br/>
These, and other results less concrete, are<br/>
long steps in the direction of universal peace<br/>
and it is gratifying to know that the American<br/>
delegation has exerted an influence second to<br/>
that of no other nation. It was General<br/>
Porter's wise modification of Dr. Drago's<br/>
proposition that really secured its adoption,<br/>
and Mr. Choate has been the leading advocate<br/>
of a permanent court of arbitration. His clear<br/>
and convincing address on this subject, following his earnest <span style="color: #ff0000;">ivdividual </span>efforts, had much<br/>
to do with changing the opposition and indifference of some of the delegates into <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthusiastic </span>support of the proposition.<br/>
<br/>
However impractical may be the hope of<br/>
permanent universal peace, we may at least be<br/>
sure that the Hague Conference of 1907 has<br/>
lessened the danger of war in many ways and<br/>
robbed it of a part of its brutality.<br/>
<br/>
Long and sometimes fruitless discussions in<br/>
committee meetings and on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>of the<br/>
Conference may vex the souls of the impatient,<br/>
but it is a good thing to know that we have at<br/>
last reached a point where the foremost nations<br/>
are willing to spend days and even weeks in<br/>
the effort to find a legitimate way leading to<br/>
permanent peace.<br/>
<br/>
A MISTAKE<br/>
<br/>
HERE was an obvious but serious error<br/>
<br/>
in the article on "The Prevention of<br/>
War" in THE WORLD'S WORK for July. In<br/>
the table on page 9145, the two lines showing<br/>
the cost and the number of men killed in the<br/>
Russo-Turkish war of 1876 and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">SpanishAmerican </span>war were accidentally transposed in<br/>
the mechanical department after the pages had<br/>
received their final reading. The error was<br/>
too glaring, perhaps, to be misleading.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">LMOST </span>every mail brings to THE<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">WORLD</span>'S WORK letters from readers<br/>
who have money in the savings banks<br/>
<br/>
and want to know how to invest it so as to get<br/>
better results than the banks can give them.<br/>
The sums range from $ 500 to $ 5,000. Nine<br/>
out of ten of the applicants have never been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">investors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>they have been merely savers. Nine<br/>
<br/>
out of ten, too, want conservative investments.<br/>
The other tenth wishes to get rich in a hurry,<br/>
and wants the way pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
To the latter class this magazine has no<br/>
advice to give, except a word of caution. The<br/>
others we can help, and we try to help. The<br/>
advice given varies according to the amount<br/>
of cash involved, the sex and condition of<br/>
