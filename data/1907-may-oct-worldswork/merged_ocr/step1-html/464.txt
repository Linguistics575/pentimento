<span>9262 WHAT <span style="color: #ff0000;">MIGHT<br/>
</span>American fever for invention plunged us into<br/>
this Babel of prints which is typical of the<br/>
many confusions from which the blind suffer<br/>
throughout the United States.<br/>
<br/>
We Americans spend more money on the<br/>
education of defectives than any other country.<br/>
But we do not always find the shortest, easiest<br/>
and most economical way of accomplishing<br/>
the end we have in view. We desire to bring<br/>
the greatest happiness to the largest number.<br/>
We give generously as earnest of our desire,<br/>
and then we do not see that our bounty is<br/>
wisely spent.<br/>
<br/>
THE WORK OF TWO WOMEN<br/>
<br/>
Three or four years ago, in New York, two<br/>
cultivated women became interested in the<br/>
blind. They observed how much pleasure<br/>
some blind persons derived from a musical<br/>
entertainment, and they thought how many<br/>
hours the sightless must spend without diversion. They set to work to establish a bureau<br/>
for the distribution to the blind of tickets for<br/>
the theatre, the opera and other entertainments.<br/>
This brought them into contact with the blind,<br/>
and they soon perceived that their efforts to<br/>
entertain them were but to gild a sepulchre.<br/>
The blind said to them: "<span style="color: #0000FF;">You </span>are very kind<br/>
to give us pleasure. But it is work we need,<br/>
something to do with our hands. It is terrible<br/>
to sit idle all day long. Give us that wondrous<br/>
thing, interest in life. Work wedded to interest<br/>
gives dignity, sweetness and strength even to<br/>
our kind of life."<br/>
<br/>
The two noble women determined to see<br/>
what could be done. They went for information to the New York Institution for the<br/>
Blind. They asked why the blind were unemployed. They received courteous assurances<br/>
that everything possible was being done for the<br/>
blind, that their hard lot was the inevitable<br/>
result of circumstances. The fact that they<br/>
were idle was deplored, but there was no help<br/>
for it. In a world of machinery, specialized<br/>
industry and keen competition the blind man<br/>
could not expect to find profitable occupation.<br/>
He must, it was urged, ever remain a public<br/>
charge to be treated kindly, and the young<br/>
women were heartily commended for their<br/>
efforts to supply them with entertainment.<br/>
Indeed, it was argued, it would be cruel to add<br/>
to the burden of infirmity the burden of labor.<br/>
It would be quite as cruel to expect them to<br/>
eam their living as to compel a disabled horse<br/>
to earn <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>oats<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>(The same kind of specious<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">BE </span>DONE <span style="color: #ff0000;">FOR </span>THE BLIND<br/>
<br/>
argument was being disseminated in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Massachusetts </span>and other states.) But the ladies were<br/>
too intelligent and too earnest to be convinced.<br/>
Their visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the beginning of a new movement in New York toward the betterment of<br/>
the sightless.<br/>
<br/>
AN ADEQUATE CENSUS OF THE BLIND<br/>
<br/>
Soon afterward an association was formed.<br/>
Meetings were held. Men of ability and eloquence spoke in behalf of the work and drove<br/>
the truth home to the people that the heaviest<br/>
burden upon the blind is not blindness, but<br/>
idleness. The institution raised its head in<br/>
protest and self-justification, and tried to<br/>
prejudice the blind against the association.<br/>
It opposed an adequate census of the sightless.<br/>
The association appealed to the Legislature for<br/>
an appropriation to carry on the census. The<br/>
Legislature made the appropriation and <span style="color: #0000FF;">established </span>a commission. The Commission appointed one of the two ladies Director of the Census,<br/>
with the result that a complete registry of the<br/>
blind of New York State will soon be available.<br/>
This census will not be like the United States<br/>
Census figures, which are vague and <span style="color: #0000FF;">incomplete</span>, but will tell how many blind there are,<br/>
where each lives, and in what circumstances,<br/>
what occupation he has, what trade he has<br/>
learned in school, how old he is, how long he<br/>
has been blind, and from what cause he lost<br/>
his sight. The New York census and the<br/>
Massachusetts census will tell with scientific<br/>
definiteness what has been left undone, and<br/>
will enable us to deal more intelligently with<br/>
the problems of the sightless.<br/>
<br/>
The Massachusetts Commission for the Blind<br/>
grew out of a volunteer organization which<br/>
carried on investigations and experiments. At<br/>
the experiment station a few blind persons<br/>
learned to weave rugs, fabrics suitable for<br/>
curtains, table-covers and sofa-pillows and<br/>
other things useful and beautiful. At this<br/>
station industries and processes were tested<br/>
with a view to increase the number of lucrative<br/>
occupations in which the blind, especially<br/>
women, might engage. After it had demonstrated to the state that they are capable of<br/>
higher efficiency than they have generally<br/>
reached, the association asked the Legislature<br/>
for an <span style="color: #0000FF;">appropriation </span>to extend the work. The<br/>
appropriation was granted, and a commission<br/>
was appointed by the Governor to be responsible for the welfare of all the blind in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Massachusetts</span>.<br/>
