<span>9090 A LIGHTHOUSE<br/>
Shipbuilding Company, all stating that it was<br/>
a stable foundation.<br/>
<br/>
"I sent the drawing of the caisson, with<br/>
copies of the letter, and an answer came back<br/>
that specifications and drawings of the superstructure must accompany it, according to the<br/>
terms of the bill. I then went to Washington<br/>
and met Colonel Lockwood at his office.'Mr.<br/>
Lockwood,' I said,'I wish to make these drawings for the superstructure here in Washington,<br/>
under your supervision, so there can be no<br/>
errors. I would like to have you, in what spare<br/>
time you have, help me in this matter.' He<br/>
said that he did not consider himself competent<br/>
to make these drawings. I then asked him whom<br/>
in Washington he did consider competent.<br/>
He said there was no one in Washington, and<br/>
that he did not consider it advisable for any<br/>
member of the Board to look over the drawings,<br/>
as the whole Board would have to pass upon<br/>
them. But he did say that Mr. Rettig, of Reading, Pa., would be competent to do that work.<br/>
I must admit that I showed my anger and I<br/>
started to go out of the office, when he said:<br/>
'I am advising you for your own benefit.' I<br/>
went to Reading and saw Mr. Rettig and<br/>
showed him my drawings. He said that he<br/>
thought a skeleton structure would be <span style="color: #0000FF;">practicable </span>to put on Cape Hatteras, but I told him<br/>
that I would like to have him make drawings<br/>
for the solid structure; but he said he would<br/>
not do it, and that I had better get Mr. Buck.<br/>
I asked him if he would make plans for a<br/>
skeleton structure if they would be satisfactory<br/>
to the Lighthouse Board, and he said that he<br/>
would. It was evident that he was not on<br/>
good terms with the Lighthouse Board, and<br/>
his act and his conversation placed me in a<br/>
position where I could make no drawings that<br/>
would be satisfactory to the Board, according<br/>
to Colonel Lockwood's statement; and so I<br/>
again decided to go to Congress for relief in<br/>
this matter.<br/>
<br/>
"Up to this time, a period of more than<br/>
twelve years had elapsed since my first act of<br/>
good faith in this enterprise; and it must be<br/>
evident that this work of preparation not only<br/>
took the time of myself and many kind friends,<br/>
but also cost many thousands of dollars.<br/>
<br/>
THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL<br/>
<br/>
"The bill in its present form finally passed<br/>
unanimously through the House and Senate and<br/>
was signed by President Roosevelt on March 4,<br/>
1905, just one hour before his inauguration.<br/>
<br/>
FOR HATTERAS<br/>
<br/>
"The Government is amply protected, so<br/>
that if the lighthouse is not completed in<br/>
accordance with the provisions of the act, the<br/>
Government will not have to pay for it."<br/>
<br/>
The caisson on which Captain Eells intends<br/>
to build his light is in the form of a truncated<br/>
cone, instead of the usual cylinder, so that<br/>
when buried in the sand it will be anchored<br/>
with the weight of sand and rip-rap rock above<br/>
its sloping sides; and it differs from all previous<br/>
caissons in having double walls, which can be<br/>
filled with or emptied of water by powerful<br/>
pumps, so that it contains everything within<br/>
itself necessary to sink itself. It is a ship while<br/>
being towed to location, and a huge diving bell<br/>
while being sunk. When afloat, the caisson<br/>
will ride out gale after gale, anchored in deep<br/>
water. When a calm comes-as calms do<br/>
come, once in a while off Hatteras-the immense structure will be towed swiftly to the<br/>
buoyed location, and scuttled. Once down,<br/>
the weight of the steel and the water in the<br/>
hollow walls will hold it down. Then the<br/>
work of sinking it in the sand by dredging and<br/>
digging from the inside will be done, until<br/>
its bottom is thirty feet below the bed of the<br/>
ocean<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>As fast as the caisson is sunk, it will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled<br/>
</span>with concrete; when all is done, the huge<br/>
double steel shell will be a solid mass of concrete, weighing (with the steel tower upon it)<br/>
27,000 tons. It will be a steel lighthouse,<br/>
built upon a concrete rock in the ocean. In the<br/>
course of time, the steel on the outside of the<br/>
caisson may rust away. That will not matter,<br/>
at all. The concrete rock will be there, firmly<br/>
imbedded in the sand, and the light above will<br/>
be built upon the solid concrete, so that no<br/>
more ships shall go to pieces on that treacherous<br/>
coast for lack of warning.<br/>
<br/>
With one instruction to remember "Keep<br/>
Outside the Light" -with the certainty that no<br/>
storm can shift the tower, and no weather <span style="color: #0000FF;">obscure </span>its light entirely, the seamen rounding<br/>
Hatteras in the protection of the new light will<br/>
do so in increasing numbers and with <span style="color: #0000FF;">decreasing </span>disasters. It will be not only the greatest<br/>
lighthouse engineering feat in the world, besides which Eddystone, Minot's Ledge, Spectacle Reef, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rothersand </span>will seem small,<br/>
but it will be a national monument, typifying<br/>
the broad and liberal policy of this nation in<br/>
the matter of humanity, in its efforts to insure,<br/>
protect, and save the lives of all who approach<br/>
its shores in ships.<br/>
