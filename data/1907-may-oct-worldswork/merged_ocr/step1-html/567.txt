<span>A NEGRO COLLEGE TOWN<br/>
<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">10,000 </span>to the African Methodist Episcopal<br/>
Church. This was the origin of Wilberforce<br/>
College.<br/>
<br/>
The community which has grown up about<br/>
it is composed of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few farmers, who have been<br/>
attracted to the place by the College; a few<br/>
former students, who, after succeeding elsewhere, have gone back there to make their<br/>
homes; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflicers </span>of the school, some sixty<br/>
families in all, and about 400 students. Of<br/>
the little colony of Negro refugees who settled<br/>
in this neighborhood before the war, <span style="color: #ff0000;">them </span>still<br/>
remain a few families. On a little height on<br/>
the edge of the town there still stands a modest<br/>
cottage in which lives the only one of the<br/>
early pioneers who still remains. The memories of others are preserved in the names of some<br/>
of their descendants who occupy farms in the<br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOWN</span>'S UPLIFTING INFLUENCE<br/>
<br/>
I have referred at some length to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
</span>history of Wilberforce, in order to emphasize<br/>
the permanence (I am almost tempted to write,<br/>
the antiquity) of the community, and to suggest something of the interest and attraction<br/>
that the place has come to have for those who<br/>
have grown up there. Permanence and stability are always important factors in the development of a people. They are, perhaps, more<br/>
important to the Negro race at the present<br/>
time than they are to any other element of the<br/>
population. The individual who grows up<br/>
without feeling himself a part of some permanent community, which exercises at once a<br/>
controlling and an inspiring influence upon<br/>
his life, is placed at a great disadvantage.<br/>
In the Negro communities like Wilberforce,<br/>
we may see, I believe, the growth of a moral<br/>
control within the Negro race, which is taking<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">.he </span>place of the control that was formerly imposed upon it from without.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of Wilberforce is reflected in<br/>
the character of its homes and of the people it<br/>
has gradually, in the course of years, drawn<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Idoubt </span>whether there is any Negro<br/>
community in the United States in which there<br/>
is so large a number of beautiful and <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellkept </span>homes.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most characteristic of these is<br/>
that of Professor William S. Scarborough,<br/>
Professor of Ancient Languages. Professor<br/>
Scarborough has been at Wilberforce for about<br/>
thirty years. He has made himself an authority in his studies. He is member of a number<br/>
<br/>
9365<br/>
<br/>
of learned societies, and is the author of a<br/>
text-book on the Greek language. He has<br/>
traveled widely in Europe, and his home is<br/>
filled with the fruits of his journeys. He has<br/>
an extensive library, and he and his wife, who<br/>
is the head of the Normal Training Department of the school, have devoted much time<br/>
to local history, particularly to the history of<br/>
Negro schools in Ohio. His home has the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">refined</span>, studious atmosphere of a scholar.<br/>
<br/>
A WEALTHY NEGRO COLLEGE PROFESSOR<br/>
<br/>
President Joshua H. Jones, whose home<br/>
directly adjoins that of Professor Scarborough,<br/>
is a different type of man-the modern type<br/>
of college president, an administrator and a<br/>
business man. He is an enthusiast in agriculture and, in addition to his work as teacher<br/>
and head cf the college, is an extensive<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">landowrocr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>President Jones is, to a greater<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">C'gree </span>than any other member of the community, a self-made man. He was born on a<br/>
plantation in South Carolina, and, until he<br/>
entered Claflin <span style="color: #0000FF;">Univer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ity </span>at nineteen, he had<br/>
a very imperfect education. He was for ten<br/>
years a student, first at Claflin University, in<br/>
South Carolina, later at Howard, and finally<br/>
at Wilberforce; during all this time he supported himself mainly b r teaching in the summer months. His school training fitted him<br/>
to be a minister. He got the training which<br/>
made him a <span style="color: #0000FF;">busine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.s </span>man outside of the school,<br/>
and the story of how he obtained it is interesting.<br/>
<br/>
"While I was in Lynn, Mass.," he said, "I<br/>
saved a few hundred dollars and put it in the<br/>
savings bank. Somehow or other some promoters who had come East for money for their<br/>
speculations learned of it. They wrote to me.<br/>
I replied <span style="color: #0000FF;">courteously</span>, asking for further information. Then they called on me, and outlined<br/>
their plans and projects. I listened to all they<br/>
had to say, attentively, and with great interest,<br/>
for they were introducing me into a new world.<br/>
But I did not give them my money. I continued to receive circulars, to which I always<br/>
replied. Evidently the promoters did not<br/>
understand me. Perhaps they thought just<br/>
because I always listened and inquired, that I<br/>
had more money to invest than I had. Anyway, this thing went on for years. After some<br/>
years I began to get reports from some of the<br/>
investments that had been offered mo, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
</span>was able to see the other side of the transaction.<br/>
All this time I was observing and studying.<br/>
I never <span style="color: #0000FF;">put </span>any money into any one of the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
