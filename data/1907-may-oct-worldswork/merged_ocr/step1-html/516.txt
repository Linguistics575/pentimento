<span>9314 WHAT <span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHOP-GIRLS </span>LIFE?<br/>
<br/>
In one club the girls meet with their<br/>
mending and darning, and the girl who has a<br/>
shirt-waist or other article of clothing to make<br/>
is privileged to call upon her sister members<br/>
to help her. Another club whose members are<br/>
all department store girls is known as "The<br/>
Girls' Musical Club," and is composed of<br/>
twenty-five members, who give concerts and<br/>
small musical entertainments on Saturday<br/>
evenings, to which they invite their men<br/>
friends.'<br/>
<br/>
In one of the large department stores an<br/>
ambitious little shop-girl started a library some<br/>
years ago. Each girl was invited to bring one<br/>
book, and for the price of this was given the<br/>
use of all books that should come into the<br/>
library. The girls soon had a little library,<br/>
from which members were permitted to draw<br/>
books and keep them out two weeks. As most<br/>
of the shop-girls live at long distances from<br/>
the place of their employment, they read<br/>
on the cars to and from business, and find<br/>
the store library a great comfort and <span style="color: #0000FF;">convenience</span>.<br/>
<br/>
OPPORTUNITIES FOR' ADVANCEMENT<br/>
<br/>
There is a good chance in the department<br/>
store for the ambitious girl to rise and to make<br/>
for herself a position of responsibility and<br/>
profit in the business. As in nearly all other<br/>
kinds of business, there is "always room at the<br/>
top," for the capable and conscientious worker.<br/>
Women now occupy the positions of assistant<br/>
managers, cashiers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bookkeepers</span>, buyers,<br/>
superintendents of advertising, and heads of<br/>
departments. Most of the girls realize their<br/>
opportunities and try to prepare themselves<br/>
to grasp them.<br/>
<br/>
"No one knows, who has not been among<br/>
them," said a gentle-voiced woman, assistant<br/>
manager of one of the large stores, "how<br/>
earnest and ambitious most of these girls are.<br/>
Many of them, after working all day, go to<br/>
night schools to fit themselves for promotion.<br/>
I am often surprised at the earnestness and<br/>
interest which even the little cash-girls show<br/>
in their business. One of our great troubles<br/>
is that when the girls are kept away from the<br/>
store by illness they generally come back too<br/>
soon<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>before they are really able to resume<br/>
business. To girls of that kind promotion is<br/>
certain. Women are needed in every department who are keen judges of goods, who have<br/>
executive ability, who keep their eyes open and<br/>
anticipate the demand of an erratic public<br/>
<br/>
for certain kinds of goods and articles, and<br/>
who have new and progressive ideas."<br/>
<br/>
HOW THE SHOP-GIRL LIVES<br/>
<br/>
On their average salary of between seven<br/>
and twelve dollars a week, these girls must<br/>
live and clothe themselves, and in very many<br/>
instances contribute to the support of others.<br/>
For it is a fact that there are comparatively<br/>
few of this vast body of workers who are not at<br/>
least partially responsible for the support of<br/>
other members of their families. Sometimes<br/>
that means putting practically all of the worker's<br/>
salary into the family fund. Yet the girl<br/>
who lives at home is fortunate, for love and<br/>
confidence and sympathy and companionship<br/>
are there. If she does not live at home, it<br/>
means for her a hall-bedroom in some cheap<br/>
boarding house, or in a rooming house, where<br/>
she "goes out" for her meals-and half<br/>
starves herself to keep within the narrow<br/>
limits of her salary-or cooks indigestible<br/>
messes over the gas jet and saturates her system<br/>
with debilitating cups of tea.<br/>
<br/>
Living in this way, she can have practically<br/>
no social life. She has no place in her tiny<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hall-bedroom </span>to entertain company, and if <span style="color: #0000FF;">she<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meets </span>a man whose acquaintance she cares <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>cultivate, her only means of seeing him is to<br/>
meet him on the street and carry on the<br/>
acquaintance-possibly courtship-in restaurants and on street corners.<br/>
<br/>
A "furnished" room may be had for $ 2.50<br/>
a week, but this room is a mere box, containing<br/>
an iron bed, a combination washstand and<br/>
dresser, and one chair; and has no heating<br/>
apparatus but a burner on the gas jet,<br/>
upon which the girl may also do her cooking.<br/>
Such a room is always on the third or fourth<br/>
floor, so that all her water must be carried up<br/>
two or three flights of stairs.<br/>
<br/>
A better room, with heat, may be had on the<br/>
third or fourth <span style="color: #0000FF;">floors </span>for three and four dollars<br/>
a week, and a fairly comfortable room for five.<br/>
But few shop-girls can pay this price, as the<br/>
remainder of their weekly salary would not be<br/>
enough to cover food and clothes and car-fares.<br/>
<br/>
THE WORKING GIRLS' "HOMES"<br/>
<br/>
Many shop-girls go to the working girls'<br/>
homes and clubs, but they are not happy<br/>
there. To a self-respecting young woman who<br/>
is working hard to earn her own way in the<br/>
world, the attitude of patronage and the feeling that she is being partially supported by<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
