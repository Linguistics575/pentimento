<span>TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
when an alien people comes under our control, we deem it<br/>
our duty to try the experiment of educating them to govern<br/>
themselves, and we should deem ourselves cowards and<br/>
recreants if we declined to accept the responsibility and<br/>
thus throw the people <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>into a chaos of anarchy which<br/>
could not but result ultimately in self-destruction <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>despotism."<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a writer has already said in<br/>
this magazine, he held our national conscience<br/>
in his hands there in the Philippines. But it<br/>
was not enough that the Commission should<br/>
work for the good of the Filipino; it was necessary also to make the Filipino believe it. Judge<br/>
Taft did that-and it was the most wonderful<br/>
thing he ever did.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission toured the Archipelago,<br/>
investigated conditions by personal contact,<br/>
and measured every town and every province<br/>
for the kind of government that seemed best<br/>
for each. They had to deal with Christians<br/>
and Mohammedans and hill-tribe <span style="color: #0000FF;">pagans-all </span>like whipped children, whimpering, sulking,<br/>
suspicious. These Asiatics believed that <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span>good could come out of the West, and<br/>
certainly the Western mind might never hope<br/>
to follow the tortuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">slums </span>of their Oriental<br/>
minds. But whether consciously or <span style="color: #0000FF;">unconsciously</span>, Judge Taft did not appeal to the<br/>
intellect, but to the heart. The more the<br/>
natives sulked <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>smiled conciliation while they<br/>
fingered the locks of their guns, the more<br/>
earnest became the American judge in helping<br/>
them to help themselves.<br/>
<br/>
His simple democracy was contagious. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Native </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">office-holders </span>adopted white-duck as the<br/>

regulation uniform. Judge Taft shook hands<br/>
with the greasy <span style="color: #ff0000;">dattoes </span>and his fellow Conv.<br/>
missioners followed his example. Laughter<br/>
worked better than <span style="color: #0000FF;">epaulettes </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">oilicial<br/>
</span>dignity. Here was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man without token<br/>
of rank, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">lecturer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>them "like a Dutch<br/>
uncle," slapped them on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>, went to<br/>
their fiestas and danced, a ruler who heartily<br/>
enjoyed himself and was not a pompous image<br/>
of condescension. Yet to laugh, to eat, to<br/>
dance, was to follow out his own broad and<br/>
high purposes of state.<br/>
<br/>
Judge Taft won the Filipinos by genuine<br/>
kindness. He understood their grievances,<br/>
even the imaginary ones, which are the hardest<br/>
to appreciate or to remove; and he was absolutely straightforward. He gained prestige by<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">personality </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>also won their affection.<br/>
After that he could tell them <span style="color: #0000FF;">flatly </span>what to <span style="color: #0000FF;">expect</span>, and they believed him. As the herald of a<br/>
