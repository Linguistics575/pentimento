</span>are professional politicians. The Lords are<br/>
not, and the people are not. What subtle<br/>
sympathy exists between this pair of sluggards<br/>
as against their virtuous brother is too deep a<br/>
matter to examine. But that the Lords are<br/>
strong, that the professional political attack on<br/>
them is failing to make way, that their glamor<br/>
attracts, their sober virtues flatter, their stolid<br/>
obstruction secretly gratifies the hidden <span style="color: #0000FF;">instincts </span>of Englishmen, are facts which anyone<br/>
can see. They do not share the enthusiastic<br/>
popularity of the monarchy, but it could safely<br/>
be said that their abolition would be felt by<br/>

</span>common Englishmen to be rather like the<br/>
abolition of the game of cricket. It would<br/>
be, first, "a pity," secondly, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shame</span>."<br/>
<br/>
These observations must be taken to refer to<br/>
those rare occasions when the Lords assemble<br/>
in their hundreds and assert themselves as a<br/>
chamber of veto. Only then is the hereditary<br/>
element in particular evidence. At other<br/>
times, the second chamber drifts through a<br/>
smooth existence, a very honest group of political experts, more useful than harmful, precisely<br/>
what the English Constitution demands and<br/>
makes convenient.<br/>

WHEN TO USE A LAWYER<br/>
<br/>
LEGAL ADVICE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO AVOID SUITS AND TO LESSEN COST<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HE </span>average man consults the lawyer <span style="color: #ff0000;">at<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>the wrong time. Not so the <span style="color: #0000FF;">experienced </span>business man. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">knows<br/>
</span>that good business principle requires that <span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>
<br/>
</span>unnecessary chances of loss should be taken,<br/>
and that prevention is far less costly than<br/>
remedy. The captain of industry embarks on<br/>
no undertaking, however slight, without <span style="color: #0000FF;">secure<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>the services of a skilful counsellor as his<br/>
pilot. In fact, he has under retainer at all<br/>
times one or more attorneys who are familiar<br/>
with his business affairs and interested in his<br/>
success. He makes no agreements and signs<br/>
no papers until approved by a legal expert<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>This is exactly the course that every one <span style="color: #0000FF;">should<br/>
<br/>
</span>pursue.<br/>
<br/>
Business has to-day become an art, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">investment </span>has become an art; without special<br/>
knowledge, no one should expect to succeed in<br/>
either, and part of this knowledge consists in<br/>
the ability to correctly use legal services. The<br/>
lawyer is to-day a factor in everyday life. His<br/>
main business is not to get people out of trouble,<br/>
but to prevent them from getting in. Business<br/>
and personal relations have become so complex<br/>
and the boundary between one man's rights and<br/>
another man's duties is so indistinct to the<br/>
average person that, with the best intentions in<br/>
the world, he or she may cause considerable<br/>
loss to himself, herself, or somebody else. The<br/>
individual-as employer, employee, director,<br/>
trustee, executor, guardian, husband, wife, landlord, tenant, buyer, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">seller-las </span>assumed<br/>
obligations unknown to earlier times. To<br/>
<br/>
properly fulfil these obligations, usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">implies </span>the assistance of good counsel or of good<br/>
fortune.<br/>
<br/>
It is the business of the lawyer not only to<br/>
ascertain the <span style="color: #0000FF;">law </span>but to attain skill in applying<br/>
it. He has before him a very complete record<br/>
of past success and past failure, running back<br/>
through many centuries and compiled from the<br/>
decisions of all the state and Federal courts, as<br/>
<br/>
well as the courts of Great Britain, not to speak.<br/>
<br/>
of the Roman and Continental law whose application to this country is remote. All the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inr</span>.<br/>
portant cases decided are reported by experts<br/>
and digested by experts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reports </span>and<br/>
digests are published at frequent intervals and<br/>
form the bulk of the practicing attorney's<br/>
library. From these he gains by the experience<br/>
of his profession at many times and in many<br/>
places, and naturally can foresee the contingencies that usually arise on any <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">if<br/>
</span>conduct. In no science are more careful and<br/>
numerous records preserved, and in no lines<br/>
of action are more skill and care according to the<br/>
circumstances applied to the production of<br/>
desired results, than in the law.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN BUYING REAL-ESTATE<br/>
<br/>
It would seem superfluous to remind a purchaser of real-estate that the title should be examined before conveyance. Experience, <span style="color: #ff0000;">how<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ever</span>, shows that this rule by some'will <span style="color: #0000FF;">always<br/>
</span>be neglected. Carelessness in this respect <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>sometimes appalling. In one case on <span style="color: #0000FF;">record</span>,<br/>
<br/>
a tract of land was divided into <span style="color: #0000FF;">blocks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>city<span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
