</span>construction of the Manila electric railway<br/>
system have been retained and trained in the<br/>
shops, with the result that they will probably<br/>
be successfully used to repair cars and build<br/>
the bodies of such new rolling stock as may from<br/>
time to time be required. The Filipino is a<br/>
born carpenter; given a bolo and a pile of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bamboo</span>, he will in a few hours complete a house<br/>
or set of furniture that would do credit to a<br/>
well-trained artisan. In the use of machine<br/>
tools he is, of course, unskilled; but the ease<br/>
with which he learns is remarkable. Every<br/>
one of the hundred or more electric cars in<br/>
Manila is manned by Filipino motormen and<br/>
conductors. Taken as a whole, they are much<br/>
more tidy and attractive in appearance than<br/>
men holding similar positions in American<br/>
cities.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion<br/>
regarding the relative economy of laborers<br/>
of different nationalities. Certain it is that the<br/>
white man in that climate is but <span style="color: #0000FF;">two-thirds<br/>
</span>as efficient as the ordinary white laborer in<br/>
America. The Chief Engineer of the Benguet<br/>
Road states that the average Filipino can do<br/>
only <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-fifth </span>as much as a white man in<br/>
America, and that he has found a single Igorrote<br/>
to be worth three ordinary Filipinos. Arithmetic<br/>
leads us then to the inference that the average<br/>
Igorrote laborer can do practically as much<br/>
work in a day as an average white laborer in<br/>
the Philippines, and, of course, he receives<br/>
but one-half as much pay. The same authority<br/>
states that the American laborer in the Philippines is unreliable although competent.<br/>
<br/>
With the experience of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years,<br/>
it is not to be wondered at that American<br/>
interests decided that it would be feasible to<br/>
construct a great railroad system in the Philippines entirely with native labor. Of course,<br/>
not one in a thousand has any mental conception<br/>
of a steam railroad. Yet they understand that<br/>
it will give them a rapid and cheap means of<br/>
getting their produce to market and they appreciate the fact that it will enable them to farm<br/>
on a larger scale.<br/>
<br/>
THE NECESSITY FOR RAILROADS<br/>
<br/>
Goods which now cost $ 40 a ton to transport<br/>
to the sea can be carried by the railroads for<br/>
a small fraction of that sum, and the producer<br/>
will therefore receive a greater return for his<br/>
labor in production.<br/>
<br/>
During the dry season bullock carts can be<br/>
used in some sections of the islands. They<br/>

<br/>
carry 600 pounds and cover fifteen miles a day,<br/>
making the cost of this transportation from<br/>
thirty-five cents to $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>a ton-mile. In some<br/>
sections, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nine-tenths </span>of the transportation is<br/>
accomplished by Igorrote packers, the other<br/>
tenth by the aid of pack horses. At this business of what might be called long-distance<br/>
express service, the Igorrote is a marvel. To<br/>
take fifty pounds from Candon to Cervantes,<br/>
forty-six miles, the round trip requires four to<br/>
six days; he receives one and a half pesos, or<br/>
seventy-five cents gold, and furnishes his own<br/>
rations. Transportation of this sort may cost<br/>
anywhere from $ 20 to $ 100 a ton. As a contrast to these high rates, it might be stated that<br/>
the charges of the Manila and Dagupan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Railroad </span>average <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>to $ 10 per ton for a <span style="color: #ff0000;">hundredmile </span>haul.<br/>
<br/>
The railroads now under construction will<br/>
traverse tracts of uncultivated land, but the<br/>
desire to own and work plantations along the<br/>
railroads will undoubtedly become epidemic.<br/>
The near future will see a large percentage of<br/>
the population engaged in farming on a more<br/>
or less comprehensive scale. The Government<br/>
has provided against the inroads of foreign<br/>
corporations by limiting the area that can be<br/>
held by any one individual or corporation to<br/>
about 2,000 acres. This law, together with<br/>
the present low price of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">land-from </span>$ 1 to $ 3<br/>
an acre-is in accord with the policy of "the<br/>
Philippines for the Filipino." Certainly the<br/>
more capable natives will ultimately come into<br/>
control of large haciendas, which will be worked<br/>
by their less fortunate fellows.<br/>
<br/>
Philippine sugar will <span style="color: #0000FF;">never </span>become a menace<br/>
to Cuban or local supply for the United States.<br/>
All that can be raised in the islands will find<br/>
a ready market at a good price in China. The<br/>
coastwise trade is largely in the hands of<br/>
Chinese merchants, and they have, in the past,<br/>
marketed the entire sugar crop of the islands.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally the location of the trunk lines on<br/>
the various islands was made to conform to<br/>
the richest territory; the roads were planned<br/>
to extend from the more important sea-ports<br/>
through those parts of the island from which<br/>
the largest return in the way of freight and<br/>
passenger <span style="color: #ff0000;">traihc </span>might be expected.<br/>
<br/>
The density of population in the surveyed<br/>
districts is almost incredible, even when <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered'in </span>the light of the most thickly settled<br/>
sections of the United States. For instance, the<br/>
average population of the island of Cebu is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>persons per square mile, and a large portion<br/>
<br/>
