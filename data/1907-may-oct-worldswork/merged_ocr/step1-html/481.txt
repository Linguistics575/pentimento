</span>in economic and in political affairs, and although we have families that have preserved and<br/>
increased great fortunes for several generations<br/>
---in spite of all our real and manufactured<br/>
scandals of <span style="color: #0000FF;">plutocracy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">well-balanced </span>students<br/>
of American economic conditions have no fear<br/>
of the rich. There are, in fact, occasions when<br/>
we are called on to pity them, occasions when<br/>
they are most unjustly treated, occasions even<br/>
when they are denied the share of power and<br/>
influence to which they are fairly entitled.<br/>
For instance, the American press is, as a rule,<br/>
not fair nor just in its treatment of many rich<br/>
men. It ridicules them and repeats false<br/>
statements about their personal character and<br/>
habits till the public comes to have a wholly<br/>
incorrect conception of them.<br/>
<br/>
As to the danger to American social and<br/>
political life from the rich, the surest proof<br/>
that we are not yet debauched by them is the<br/>
present tide of hostility to wealth that expresses<br/>
itself in legislation and in the public prints.<br/>
The rich have won power and still hold it in<br/>
industry-as they always have and to a degree<br/>
always must; but they have visibly lost political<br/>
power and, in the best sense, they have never<br/>
had great social power among us, simply because of wealth. Just now rich men in America<br/>
are paying such penalties that few men of<br/>
moderate fortune envy them. And Socialism,<br/>
or anything like it, has for several years got its<br/>
strongest support in the United States from one<br/>
rich man who makes money and notoriety by it<br/>
and who seeks by it to further his personal<br/>
political ambitions.<br/>
<br/>
That there are dangers to society from rich<br/>
men is admitted; but there are greater dangers<br/>
from fools, and there are more of them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>GUARDING AGAINST OPPRESSIVE WEALTH<br/>
<br/>
HE Engineering <span style="color: #0000FF;">News </span>of New York has<br/>
<br/>
made an interesting calculation, bring<br/>
ing its figures to date, to show the old truth that<br/>
<br/>
the earnings of accumulated capital cut a small<br/>
<br/>
figure in the world beside the wages paid to<br/>
labor. It runs in this wise:<br/>
<br/>
There are about 80 billions of <span style="color: #ff0000;">incomeproducing </span>wealth in the United States. The<br/>
estimated rate of income on <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>all is <span style="color: #ff0000;">4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">} </span>per<br/>
cent. The income, <span style="color: #0000FF;">then</span>, is about 3% billions a<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
The calculation, based on the Census, is<br/>
that the total of wages and salaries paid per<br/>
annum in the United States is more than<br/>
IO billions.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9279<br/>
<br/>
</span>Labor, according to this calculation, receives<br/>
about $ 3 to every $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>received by capital.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>large part of the earnings<br/>
of capital go to men who are also <span style="color: #ff0000;">wage-carncrs<br/>
</span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">salary-earners</span>. There is no sharp division<br/>
between them and the capitalists. Very rich<br/>
men receive only a small fraction; and all the<br/>
men who live solely on their incomes receive<br/>
a very much smaller fraction of the annual<br/>
earnings of capital. This is one of the fundamental facts about the distribution of wealth<br/>
in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
If all the existing wealth were distributed<br/>
equally among all the workers in the country,<br/>
the present average earning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">450 </span>would be<br/>
increased by $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">r5o</span>--or So cents a day.<br/>
<br/>
These big figures are always interesting and<br/>
they totally disprove the usual Socialist contention that the wealth of the country is really<br/>
in the hands of a few men. Still such a proof<br/>
does not reach the real reason for the Socialistic<br/>
propaganda, which is increasingly energetic in<br/>
most of the principal countries of Europe, as<br/>
well as in the United States. For it is not the<br/>
mere possession of wealth that arouses hostility;<br/>
it is the political and economic power that the<br/>
possession of wealth gives or is supposed to give.<br/>
Rich men and groups of rich men control, or<br/>
may control, "natural" monopolies and other<br/>
monopolies as <span style="color: #ff0000;">well</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and power and transportation and in some countries land; and by<br/>
this control they may prevent the cheapening<br/>
of these necessities. So the strongest Socialistic<br/>
argument runs.<br/>
<br/>
Even worse, they may control political power<br/>
--legislation, the courts, and the like; and by<br/>
this means they may hinder the gradual growth<br/>
of individual character and influence in the<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
These are the strong arguments of all those<br/>
schools of thought that we loosely call Socialism;<br/>
and, in the presence of these, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the<br/>
production and the distribution of wealth have<br/>
little effect on men's minds. The fact remains<br/>
that rich men can combine in ways that poor<br/>
men can't. A dozen men who own or control<br/>
a billion dollars can exert more political and<br/>
industrial power than 5,000 men who own ten<br/>
billions. A million men who earn only $ 450<br/>
a year apiece show a colossal total earning of<br/>
450 millions of dollars. But since <span style="color: #0000FF;">practically<br/>
</span>every dollar of this is spent and must be spent<br/>
for living expenses as fast as it is earned, these<br/>
million men have practically no <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>power.<br/>
One man with an income one-tenth as <span style="color: #0000FF;">great<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
