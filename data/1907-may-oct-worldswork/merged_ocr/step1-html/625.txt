<span>CITY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN<br/>
<br/>
govern itself within its grotesque geographical<br/>
boundaries? Has not New York City a right<br/>
to govern itself, free from the interference of<br/>
the rest of the state of New York? What<br/>
business has any state with the administration<br/>
of a great city within its borders? The<br/>
right answer to these questions is that a great<br/>
city is so far created and maintained by the<br/>
country from which it draws its food, and to<br/>
which it distributes all sorts of goods in return,<br/>
that the tributary country ought to have a voice<br/>
in its affairs. Thus, eastern Massachusetts,<br/>
with the help of the New England sea-coast<br/>
north of Boston and of the Canadian maritime<br/>
provinces, created Boston and long maintained<br/>
the city. Railroads have spread out in all<br/>
directions except toward the east, and the<br/>
tributary country which is also the area of<br/>
Boston's distributing function has widened.<br/>
Through all this larger region Boston exerts<br/>
a strong influence, industrial, educational and<br/>
political, and in return this whole area contributes incessantly to the life of Boston. Every<br/>
great city makes a large part of the life of the<br/>
state in which it is situated, and may therefore<br/>
exert upon all the moral interests of the state<br/>
as well as its material interests an influence<br/>
which may be either good or bad. In the<br/>
quality of the government of the great city the<br/>
whole state has in very truth a direct interest<br/>
which can only be properly described as intense.<br/>
This is particularly the case with regard to the<br/>
city's management of those portions of its<br/>
population which make money out of the gross<br/>
vices. One might as well say that the rest of<br/>
the body has no interest in the heart, and<br/>
should have no control over the heart, as to<br/>
say that a state should have no interest in or<br/>
control over the management of the great city<br/>
within its borders. The whole body needs a<br/>
calm, steady, strong heart; but the heart can<br/>
have none of these qualities unless it be fed,<br/>
regulated, and controlled by all the rest of the<br/>
body. City and country are in reality bound<br/>
together by a complex network of channels<br/>
through which flow the lifeblood of both. To<br/>
think of the city as a detached entity living for<br/>
itself alone, and therefore entitled to control<br/>
its own affairs without interference from outside, is to be blind to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">plainest </span>facts of the<br/>
case and to uphold a theory which can only be<br/>
disastrous in practice. Just as the idea of<br/>
local representation has become inapplicable<br/>
in city populations, so the idea of local <span style="color: #0000FF;">self</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">government </span>without external interference has<br/>
<br/>
9423<br/>
<br/>
become inapplicable to cities, particularly<br/>
when the territorial unit of the city is too small<br/>
and has no natural boundaries. In every state<br/>
of the Union there ought to be a state officer or<br/>
board exercising over all the cities in the state<br/>
some of the powers which in England are<br/>
exercised by the Local Government Board."<br/>
That Board is a national authority which,<br/>
among other functions and duties, controls the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>engagements and the expenditures of<br/>
local bodies in two ways: (a) in most cases,<br/>
before any local authority can borrow money,<br/>
it must obtain the sanction of the Board; (b)<br/>
the Board subjects the accounts of most local<br/>
authorities to an independent and searching<br/>
audit. This financial control, which is not yet<br/>
thirty years old, has proved highly useful.<br/>
Its legitimacy <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>unquestioned in England.<br/>
<br/>
The causes of, or reasons for, municipal<br/>
failure in the United States are then somewhat<br/>
as follows: The original structure of the city<br/>
government was ill-suited to the work to be<br/>
done; and municipal work has so changed since<br/>
the American city government was constructed<br/>
that a form of government, originally founded<br/>
on a false analogy, has become less and less<br/>
adapted to present functions. Secondly, city<br/>
business being now much more elaborate, extensive, and complicated than it was originally,<br/>
inexperienced, frequently changing executive<br/>
bodies, like sub-committees of city legislative<br/>
bodies, have become worse than useless; <span style="color: #ff0000;">bebecause </span>the real business can only be done by<br/>
experts. Thirdly, the old idea of local representation and local government is inapplicable<br/>
to modern cities. Fourthly, the city taxpayers<br/>
have lost control over the expenditure of the<br/>
tax money they have paid in. Fifthly, the unit<br/>
of area for taxation is so <span style="color: #0000FF;">defined </span>geographically<br/>
that a just system of taxation has in many cases<br/>
become impossible, and great wastes in the<br/>
various branches of the city administration are<br/>
inevitable. Sixthly, the practices of corporations<br/>
that need public franchises have been often<br/>
corrupt. Finally, legislative remedies for these<br/>
evils have been hindered by a false theory that<br/>
a city ought to be an independent entity<br/>
managing all its own affairs, and accepting<br/>
neither aid nor control from the state.<br/>
<br/>
The result of all these difficulties has been<br/>
that the entire business of a great city is usually<br/>
done in an unintelligent and inefficient way,<br/>
and often in a dishonest way. Direct municipal<br/>
stealing has been notorious, and indirect stealing still more frequent and mischievous. Some<br/>
