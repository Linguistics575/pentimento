<span>THE ECONOMIC LAYMAN AND THE PREACHER<br/>
<br/>
THE NATIONAL SPIRIT OF THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HOW </span>far the practical politicians of the<br/>
South, as a rule, lag behind the best<br/>
thought of their region, is indicated by the<br/>
spirit of a notable address delivered this<br/>
summer at the University of North Carolina,<br/>
by Colonel Robert Bingham, the most famous<br/>
of Southern schoolmasters. The occasion was<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiftieth </span>anniversary of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">class-the </span>class<br/>
of 1857. He spoke to the young men as<br/>
follows<span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"You must regain the national spirit which sectionalism<br/>
at the North and sectionalism at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">South </span>has obscured,<br/>
and which it has <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed </span>in many <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sectionalism</span>,<br/>
whether at the North or at the South, has always been and<br/>
as long as it exists will continue to be a menace to the<br/>
greatness, power and glory of National America<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and<br/>
National America is the only America of the future.<br/>
Southern men made the Nation at first<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Jefferson wrote<br/>
the Declaration of Independence; Washington won that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">independence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Madison, more than any other man, created<br/>
the Constitution and secured its adoption; Marshall<br/>
interpreted it, and these were all Virginians.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>After recalling that it was President Polk, an<br/>
alumnus of that university who "added the<br/>
Pacific coast to our domain and made us an<br/>
interoceanic power," and that it was William<br/>
A. Graham, another alumnus, who, as Secretary of the Navy, "opened Japan-a thing<br/>
<br/>
of international <span style="color: #0000FF;">importance</span>," <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>went<br/>
on to say:<br/>
<br/>
"Why shall not <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>broad and national spirit expel the<br/>
narrow and sectional spirit <span style="color: #ff0000;">whichyrevails</span>. too much, in the<br/>
South; a spirit, which has dwarfed our statesmen so that<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nation</span>, as a Nation, has no need for them because the<br/>
Nation thinks them unfit? What Southern man is there<br/>
whom the whole Nation would think <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>to be President<br/>
or Vice-President? The evil spirit of sectional America<br/>
must be <span style="color: #0000FF;">exercised</span>. The national spirit of Washington,<br/>
Jefferson, Madison and Marshall of Virginia, Polk and<br/>
Graham of North Carolina, must be restored; and, young<br/>
men, why may <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of you aspire to those highest<br/>
National positions so often occupied by Southern men in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">past </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P'<br/>
<br/>
</span>TEMPORARY-PERMANENT CONTROL IN CUBA<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SECRETARY </span>TAFT has again set a date<br/>
when he hopes for the return of the<br/>
Cuban government to the Cubans; and he<br/>
sets it in all sincerity. Doubtless at that date,<br/>
or at a later, the island will again make an<br/>
experiment at self-government<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>But the opinion grows among all classes of<br/>
thoughtful men that the temporary government of Cuba by the United States will be, as<br/>
<br/>
9175<br/>
<br/>
the British government of Egypt has become,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temporary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">administration </span>become permanent.<br/>
With intermissions and possibly with variations,<br/>
American control in Cuba is pretty sure to<br/>
continue indefinitely in some form or other.<br/>
<br/>
This will occur against the will of most<br/>
Cubans, and against the professed will of<br/>
others, and without the wish of the American<br/>
people, but only by the working of natural<br/>
forces. Among these natural forces is, of<br/>
course, the demand of American capital (and<br/>
of all foreign capital) for security; for upon<br/>
this depends the industrial development of<br/>
the island.<br/>
<br/>
If the auspiciously begun Palma <span style="color: #0000FF;">administration </span>ended for no cause except a native inability<br/>
to carry on the routine of government-the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">irreconcilability </span>of mere partisan factions-no<br/>
other Cuban administration is likely at any<br/>
early time lo succeed. The ex-President is<br/>
now a voluntary exile on his remote plantation,<br/>
not a strong man, but a man who made a sincere<br/>
effort to serve his country; and the rather<br/>
lonely and pathetic end of his public career<br/>
points to the probable failure of any successor<br/>
that he may have.<br/>
<br/>
All this does not relieve us of the necessity<br/>
to make an honest effort again to turn over the<br/>
government to the Cubans. We shall probably in due time do so. But the foreign<br/>
investors in the island and most other men who<br/>
have a serious stake there expect the United<br/>
States to give security to its government; and<br/>
they do not expect security in any other way.<br/>
<br/>
THE ECONOMIC LAYMAN AND THE PREACHER<br/>
<br/>
HE election of Mr. Harry A. Garfield,<br/>
successively lawyer, civic reformer, and<br/>
Professor in Princeton University, and the<br/>
oldest son of President Garfield, to the presidency of Williams College marks the end of<br/>
another collegiate dynasty of clergymen<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
public-spirited, well-informed layman has<br/>
now displaced the preacher in Harvard, in<br/>
Yale, in Princeton, in the University of Chicago,<br/>
in Williams and in fact in most of the important colleges and universities. Most of the<br/>
State Universities have chosen laymen as<br/>
presidents from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">beginnanf</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This emphasizes the losing influence of<br/>
theology and of the pulpit in modern life in<br/>
general and in modern intellectual life in particular, just as the proportion of college graduates who enter the ministry has steadily<br/>
decreased. In a positive way it argues the<br/>
