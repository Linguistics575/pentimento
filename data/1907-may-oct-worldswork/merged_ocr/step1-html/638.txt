</span>TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">l<br/>
<br/>
</span>Taft's attitude and methods of work. His<br/>
success has been called the success of personality. The policy of attraction, the protocol<br/>
of a laugh have been emphasized, but the real<br/>
explanation lies in the man's sympathy and<br/>
sincerity.<br/>
<br/>
The Taft Commission was charged with<br/>
a difficult task in colonial government. Since<br/>
the underlying motive was not the good of the<br/>
home country but the welfare of the dependents,<br/>
the Commission had completely to change the<br/>
Spanish system of government, to which the<br/>
natives had been accustomed since the Middle<br/>
Ages-and in such changes the Commissioners<br/>
had no precedent. They were doing something<br/>
new in history. To inaugurate a permanent<br/>
form of government would have been comparatively simple, but it was their task to invent<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flexible </span>kind, a form that could be expanded<br/>
or enlarged as the Filipinos became more and<br/>
more prepared to govern themselves. None but<br/>
an optimistic statesman would seriously consider<br/>
such a task. Judge Taft's views were these:<br/>
<br/>
"We believe that ultimately <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-government </span>is the best<br/>
government for all people, and that all people can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">prepared </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">constant </span>labor and attention ultimately to enjoy<br/>
the blessings of civil liberty and <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-government</span>. Hence,<br/>
