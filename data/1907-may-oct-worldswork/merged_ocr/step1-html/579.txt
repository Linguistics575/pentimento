of the Gunnison. The Indians believed that<br/>
no human being might follow the river through<br/>
its dark channel and come out alive. Those<br/>
who had made the venture had never emerged<br/>
at the other end. Explorers had declared it<br/>
unexplorable and a railroad corporation had<br/>
decided that the Black Canon were better<br/>
avoided. But the district engineer sent this<br/>
message to headquarters:<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Immediate </span>preparations will be made for<br/>
the exploration of the Gunnison <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canon </span>at the<br/>
<br/>
earliest possible date by Fellows and Tor-,<br/>
<br/>
rence."<br/>
<br/>
Instead of a boat, the two engineers took an<br/>
inflated rubber mattress to which the provisions<br/>
and heavier surveying instruments were lashed.<br/>
Record books and the most delicate of their<br/>
instruments were strapped to their bodies in<br/>
water-proof cases.<br/>
<br/>
They entered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canon </span>of the Gunnison<br/>
and for two days towed their rubber raft<br/>
through the rock-strewn stream, followed along<br/>
the brink of the precipice by friends. But on<br/>
the third day they were swallowed up in the<br/>
canon, where measurements and observations<br/>
depended no less upon gymnastic than upon<br/>
professional skill. During the next ten days,<br/>
their progress was at the rate of three miles in<br/>
twenty-four hours. Clad in water-soaked garments, they slept upon damp rocks around<br/>
which the river raced.<br/>
<br/>
The banks were so precipitous that most of<br/>
the journey was made by stream. Twice they<br/>
passed natural bridges, made by columns of<br/>
basalt through which the flood had bored.<br/>
At length the river disappeared in the crevices<br/>
of scores of slippery boulders that lay heaped<br/>
in a titanic pile, extending from wall to wall.<br/>
On the other side they made this memorandum:<br/>
"Twenty yards headway in five hours."<br/>
<br/>
Gradually the canon narrowed to less than<br/>
thirty feet and the roar of the torrent became<br/>
more intense. The sky became a thin blue<br/>
ribbon and the stars were visible in broad<br/>
daylight. Though the journey was made in<br/>
August, the water was icy cold.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly the river presented the phenomenon<br/>
of a horizon. Here was a fall. The stream<br/>
reached it between two abutments. Wading<br/>
cautiously, they tried to round these but there<br/>
was no hold for feet or hands. They could<br/>
not gauge the depth nor see what lay beyond.<br/>
<br/>
"What next?" <span style="color: #0000FF;">shouted </span>Torrence in Fellows's<br/>
ear.<br/>
<br/>
"Overl" responded the senior<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'U </span>first!"<br/>
<br/>
9377<br/>
<br/>
The other nodded and the hands met in an<br/>
eloquent grip.<br/>
<br/>
Two minutes later Fellows disappeared over<br/>
the fall. Torrence gazed at the spot where his<br/>
chief had vanished, then plunged after him.<br/>
Bruised, bleeding, and dazed, he finally gained<br/>
a crag; nearby, in a similar plight, he saw Mr.<br/>
Fellows. Looking back at the sixty-foot sheer<br/>
fall of water, they realized that there could be<br/>
no turning back.<br/>
<br/>
The morning of the eighth day brought them<br/>
face to face with starvation. It had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">sixteen </span>hours since they had tasted food and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">canon </span>apparently contained nothing more<br/>
edible than leaves and bark. They plodded<br/>
on with heavy and painful steps; each hour<br/>
their progress became pitifully slower.<br/>
<br/>
But with the extremity of stress they began to<br/>
feel a grim enjoyment in the struggle. Strapped<br/>
to their bodies was the story they went out to<br/>
learn, writ clear to the understanding of any<br/>
of their craft:<br/>
<br/>
"The Gunnison tunnel is feasible!<br/>
know it, and they shall know!"<br/>
<br/>
Then happened an unusual circumstance.<br/>
A frightened mountain sheep bounded straight<br/>
into the arms of Torrence, who grappled the<br/>
animal with the frenzy of a starving man until<br/>
Fellows could get his knife. The food crisis<br/>
was ended. Strengthened by their savage feast,<br/>
the explorers pushed on into the unknown until<br/>
a rocky barrier stopped their way. At this point<br/>
the river plunged into a dark tunnel; so far as<br/>
the explorers knew, it might be a mile before<br/>
it emerged again, possibly through an outlet<br/>
not big enough to accommodate a human body.<br/>
But the face of the cliff was too smooth and<br/>
slippery to be climbed.<br/>
<br/>
"Here goes! Good luck, Bill!" said Fellows,<br/>
extending his hand. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Torrence </span>grasped it in<br/>
silence. Fellows hitched up his belt and<br/>
slipped off the rock into the stream. The<br/>
surging waters seized him and turned him over<br/>
as he shot into the tunnel, only one foot visible<br/>
to his companion.<br/>
<br/>
A conviction that his friend was already<br/>
drowned took possession of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Torrence</span>. Of<br/>
course he would follow, but there was no need<br/>
of haste. At last he plunged in but was swept<br/>
into the cavern with his head above water.<br/>
With extended arms he protected his head from<br/>
the jutting <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks </span>and raced through the dark<br/>
passage at terrific speed. A few anxious<br/>
seconds brought daylight-and he saw Fellows<br/>
perched upon a rock in mid-stream.<br/>
<br/>
