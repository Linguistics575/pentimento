<br/>
</span>per cent. <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>it in just eight years. Thus<br/>
it will be seen that 87 per cent. finished on time,<br/>
or in less than the regular time.<br/>
<br/>
Under the usual plan, millions of pupils<br/>
are bound in chain-gangs and compelled to<br/>
walk in intellectual lock-step for their whole<br/>
school lives. Once each year a shackle is<br/>
opened and those able to pass to higher work<br/>
are allowed to move on and be bound to those<br/>
left over in the next grade. Still shackled,<br/>
they spend year after year trying to drag others<br/>
or being pulled along by others. Under<br/>
the new plan suggested, there is freedom of<br/>
opportunity for every pupil, the progress of<br/>
each being determined only by his application<br/>
and ability.<br/>
<br/>
Under the usual plan, the pupils whose<br/>
development is slower, or who cannot keep<br/>
pace with the brightest, drag along at the foot<br/>
of the class, and, regardless of thoroughness,<br/>
are rushed over the work. They fall behind,<br/>
stumble for a time at the foot and then, misunderstood, unappreciated, and discouraged,<br/>
drop out of school. They have lost the confidence of their teachers and are no longer<br/>
encouraged by the confidence of their parents.<br/>
Infinitely more are they to be pitied because<br/>
they have lost all confidence in their own<br/>
ability. Under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plan</span>, pupils who<br/>
naturally move slower are not hurried, but<br/>
move steadily towards the higher grades at a<br/>
slower rate. All who have studied the records<br/>
acknowledge that these frequently make the<br/>
best citizens and win the highest successes in<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
It is little less than criminal to compel pupils<br/>
differing greatly in ability and attainments to<br/>
walk in intellectual lock-step for months and<br/>
years; it is an outrage to compel <span style="color: #0000FF;">teachers </span>to<br/>
hurry forward the slow or to hold back the<br/>
bright; and to force many out of school, after<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">having </span>destroyed their <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-confidence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a.nd<br/>
</span>condemned them to lives of ignorance, if not<br/>
worse, is a barbarism that should not be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerated</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>
<br/>
</span>That the appalling effects of the old method<br/>
are beginning to be appreciated is amply<br/>
proven by the statements of leading, educators,<br/>
and by editorial endorsements of my plan by<br/>
500 of the leading papers of the United States.<br/>

SCHOOL CONDITIONS IN PHILADELPHIA<br/>
<br/>
The following extract is from an <span style="color: #0000FF;">editorial<br/>
<br/>
</span>in the Philadelphia Public <span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">edger</span>, dealing with<br/>
the conditions of the schools in that <span style="color: #0000FF;">city<br/>
</span>LOCK-STEP 9253<br/>
<br/>
"There is in the United States a city only 72% of whose<br/>
children attend the public schools. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>these, only <span style="color: #ff0000;">seventenths </span>of 1% pass through the high school; only 4.3%<br/>
reach it. Eighty-four per cent. leave before they have <span style="color: #0000FF;">gone<br/>
</span>half-way through the grammar school. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sixty-sis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">per </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cent</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>go only through the primary grades; 53% <span style="color: #0000FF;">stop </span>at the<br/>
second reader.<br/>
<br/>
"The city in question is <span style="color: #0000FF;">facing </span>a future in which there<br/>
is no assurance that one-quarter of its population will be<br/>
able to write their names; or more than half its population<br/>
be able to <span style="color: #0000FF;">read-<br/>

or do such simple sums as can be counted on the fingers;<br/>
or one-eighth possess the <span style="color: #ff0000;">merest </span>rudiments of knowledge;<br/>
or one in twenty-three have mastered the common branches;<br/>
or one in 143 have availed themselves fully <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the education<br/>
provided by the state<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The city is Philadelphia.<br/>
<br/>
"At the solicitation of the Public Ledger, William <span style="color: #ff0000;">J.<br/>
</span>Shearer, a well-known educational expert engaged in a<br/>
study of public school conditions throughout the United<br/>
States, has made a particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">investigation </span>of conditions<br/>
obtaining in this city. The results are well-nigh incredible<br/>
but, being beyond doubt, they afford reason for the most<br/>
humiliating <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflections </span>and call for instant resolution to<br/>
seek for the causes of a condition so terrifying."<br/>
<br/>
Without any solicitation on my part, I have<br/>
been employed to make investigations and to<br/>
suggest remedies for acknowledged defects in<br/>
New York, Boston, and other cities. Facts<br/>
established by these investigations and by<br/>
personal visits to the schools of a hundred<br/>
towns and cities between Chicago and New<br/>
York and Boston and New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orleans</span>, prove<br/>
that the conditions in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philadelp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lit </span>a but little<br/>
worse than those in other parts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>: country.<br/>
In spite of the work done by our <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tic </span>schools<br/>
and the great improvement in methods of<br/>
instruction, which place the public far ahead of<br/>
private schools, the friends of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>schools must<br/>
acknowledge that there is something radically<br/>
wrong with the method of organization which<br/>
produces such unsatisfactory results as those<br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK CITY<br/>
<br/>
To show existing conditions more <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearly</span>,<br/>
it may be well to consider some of the facts<br/>
concerning a particular city, such as New<br/>
York, as conditions there are typical. The<br/>
report of its superintendent contains much<br/>
which others have not <span style="color: #ff0000;">rlaretl </span>to publish. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>reports called attention to the large<br/>
number of pupils falling behind yearly<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>and the small number reaching the higher<br/>
grades, the friends of the schools would long<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
