</span>general misunderstanding likewise of their own<br/>
qualities and capacities by the Southern people<br/>
themselves. They had not come to their own<br/>
until these recent years, and they had fallen<br/>
into the habit of thinking that they were<br/>
different from other people. They are, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>course, like the people of the North, and like<br/>
the people of the West, and it needed only the<br/>
touch of industrial prosperity to reveal not<br/>
only their kinship but their essential identity.<br/>

whether you live in the North or in the South,<br/>
there is no longer any "South." The striking<br/>
demonstration that Mr. Tompkins has made,<br/>
which is published elsewhere in this magazine,<br/>
that industrial activity is not a new thing in<br/>
the South but a renascence-the renewal of<br/>
an old <span style="color: #0000FF;">thing-is </span>an explanation, in brief, of a<br/>
hundred years of Southern history. Industrial conditions have now come whereby the<br/>
people are finding their natural <span style="color: #0000FF;">aptitude </span>and<br/>
doing the very work that their fathers would<br/>
have done long, long ago, but for slavery and<br/>
