</span>germ fulfil the measure of its destiny only<br/>
through the aid both of man and one of<br/>
300 varieties of mosquitoes? The answer<br/>
to these questions lies mainly in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting<br/>
</span>power of the blood. The proportion of red<br/>
blood-cells in the human body is about 830 to I<br/>
white, but there is a tremendous variation in<br/>
their numbers at various times. The red cells<br/>
grow by the millions during a balloon ascension<br/>
or a fortnight's residence in high altitudes; and<br/>
they are destroyed "in six ciphers" by fever or<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">wound-sooo/soo </span>are lost in every 30 drops<br/>
of blood. The white cells increase rapidly<br/>
after a hearty meal, only to decrease again<br/>
before the dinner gong sounds once more.<br/>
<br/>
One of the lowest forms of life is the amoeba<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>bit of jelly-like protoplasm which moves<br/>
like a cumulus cloud on a summer's day, drawing in here and extending there. All these<br/>
changes in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">shaped </span>the amoeba represent its<br/>
search for food. It has no mouth; when a<br/>
germ comes floating by, the amoeba either<br/>
hollows itself like a thimble or runs out <span style="color: #0000FF;">arm-like<br/>
</span>extensions and enfolds the germ.<br/>
<br/>
Our white blood-corpuscles are essentially<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">amrcbar-bits </span>of protoplasm able to reach out<br/>
and envelope germs, oil drops, gas bubbles,<br/>
and broken-off bits of blood-clot.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lNow </span>every unconscious action in living<br/>
creatures is the result of a stimulus, and that<br/>
excitant is the product of a ferment. The<br/>
individual parts of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">amaeba</span>'s protoplasm<br/>
do not initiate any contraction or extension,<br/>
but they respond to the stimulus of acid or<br/>
alkali, heat or cold, to chemical attraction or<br/>
repulsion. Our blood contains a great variety<br/>
of these excitants, varying in individuals and<br/>
in the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">individual </span>from time to time. It<br/>
also contains a great variety of foods, on some<br/>
of which one germ can thrive while another<br/>
starves. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hence </span>the peculiar differences of<br/>
individuals and species in immunities.<br/>
<br/>
There is not a germ that enters our blood<br/>
which the blood-cells are unable to kill, but<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting </span>power depends upon the quality<br/>
of the blood-as a food, as an agglutinizer, as<br/>
a poisoner, as a digester. The body's defence<br/>
depends also upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-relative </span>number of<br/>
germs and white blood-cells.<br/>
<br/>
IMMUNITY THROUGH INOCULATION<br/>
<br/>
The most successful serum treatment to-day<br/>
is that for diphtheria. The antitoxins for<br/>
tetanus, snake-bite, and rabies rank next.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9.f</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pypaining </span>germ diseases, the most<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OPSONrNS-A </span>NEW HOPE FOR HEALTH<br/>
<br/>
promising attacks have been made on typhoid,<br/>
acute epidemic dysentery, and bubonic plague.<br/>
Next to these come cholera, anthrax, and scarlet<br/>
fever. Thus far, the most obstinate diseases<br/>
have been three of the most destructive<br/>
of all: tuberculosis, pneumonia, and infected<br/>
wounds. Hope for the conquering of these is<br/>
now offered by opsonins.<br/>
<br/>
And the public should remember that it is<br/>
thus far only a hope. It is wise to recall the<br/>
premature exploitation of Koch's tuberculin<br/>
caught up as a message of hope by sufferers<br/>
under the unappealable sentence of tuberculosis. This hope, unjustified by the results,<br/>
was followed by a deeper despair, and the<br/>
slow-moving advance of medical science was<br/>
still further retarded.<br/>
<br/>
It is claimed for opsonins that they act upon<br/>
the invading germs in such a way as to increase<br/>
the willingness and ability of the white <span style="color: #0000FF;">blood</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">corpuscles </span>to engulf and digest them. While<br/>
opsonins exist in all human blood, they are at<br/>
times insufficient to prevent infection or to<br/>
overcome it. By submitting colonies of particular germs to partial sterilization-which<br/>
destroys the lives of the germs but not the<br/>
chemical efficiency of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">excretions</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>injecting the product in proper amount to one<br/>
suffering from the disease which the same kind<br/>
of germs has caused, the patient's blood is<br/>
said then to be able to destroy the invaders.<br/>
This sounds easy but the process is far from<br/>
simple.<br/>
<br/>
THE DOSE OF OPSONINS<br/>
<br/>
If opsonin were to be given as old-fashioned<br/>
hospitality set bread and wine before guests, the<br/>
injections would be apt <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>kill. Each patient's<br/>
dose must be determined by a test of the opsonic<br/>
standard of his blood. (How <span style="color: #0000FF;">this</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>annoy<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">quacksl</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>ordinarily guage the amount<br/>
of a drug to be given by knowing <span style="color: #0000FF;">how</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">much<br/>
</span>is ordinarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">required </span>to secure <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>drug's<br/>
intended effect and by the severity of attack.<br/>
But, in giving opsonins, it is necessary to measure the dose by a mathematical count of the<br/>
digestive capacity of the sick man's white<br/>
blood-cells-not at the normal but with the<br/>
particular germs now in his blood. If he has<br/>
tuberculosis, the physician must calculate how<br/>
many tubercle germs each white <span style="color: #0000FF;">blood-cell<br/>
</span>can digest. And, at the same time, this eating<br/>
ability must be tested in the blood of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>well man,<br/>
to get a guage of normal digestive power. By<br/>
comparing <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.two</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">epsonig </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_Aefect_in<br/>
