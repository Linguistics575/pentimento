caricature of him represented him as a determined man with a big stick.<br/>
His <span style="color: #ff0000;">vigorous </span>manner, the utter <span style="color: #0000FF;">freedom </span>of his talk, the stories that bis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bearers </span>frequently told of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'recklessness</span>' of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">conversation-many<br/>

persons to fear <span style="color: #0000FF;">lest </span>he should <span style="color: #0000FF;">overturn </span>our liberties. (For <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmation<br/>
</span>of this, see <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.New </span>York daily newspapers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>those of April,<br/>

called the enemy of wealth and of prosperity, so bitterly did the rich <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawbreakers </span>resent his bringing them to justice. The word Socialist' was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>applied to him. (See the same attitude about a <span style="color: #0000FF;">century<br/>

<br/>
</span>A very useful faculty of the mind, somewhat<br/>
neglected by the political critics of our time,<br/>
is the faculty which enables one to pick out<br/>
from the intricate and noisy activities of men<br/>
the few simple, permanent things that are<br/>
taking place. The President's manners and<br/>
mannerisms, his impetuous deliverance, his personal complications and controversies, his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">combativeness</span>, his versatility of temper, his misleading confidence in some of his friends and<br/>
his vehement speech about his enemies, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">abhorrence </span>of a merely formal <span style="color: #0000FF;">reticence</span>, his<br/>
enjoyment of action for its own sake and the<br/>
abnormal variety of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">activities-thee </span>accidental, certainly incidental, qualities of the man<br/>
confuse the judgment of those who see little<br/>
things big and big things little and blind them<br/>
to these simple facts:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hat </span>Mr. Roosevelt believes in the people<br/>
and they believe in him.<br/>
<br/>
That they believe in him because he <span style="color: #0000FF;">pugnaciously </span>puts the public welfare and obedience<br/>
to the laws above the privileges of any class,<br/>
even the corporate class; and because he will<br/>
fight for "the square deal": and, for the sake<br/>
of these things, they would forgive him many<br/>
more and more serious indiscretions than he<br/>
has committed. His mannerisms either count<br/>
for nothing in the public mind or add to his<br/>
popularity.<br/>
<br/>
That he is not an "astute politician," as<br/>
machine politicians are astute; for his only<br/>
weapon is his confidence in the people and his<br/>
frank appeal at every step to their confidence<br/>
in him keeps his stick big.<br/>
<br/>
When mere incidents and imagined mysteries<br/>
are put aside, the situation is simple and easy<br/>
to understand. Here is a vigorous man, making public life simpler and honester and bring-"<br/>
ing its sinister activities out of concealment.<br/>
Whether he swears or prays while he <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>it,<br/>
whether he is gentle or rough, or speaks loud<br/>
or is silent, or smiles or frowns, or sometimes<br/>
hits the wrong head and sometimes invites the<br/>
wrong man and sometimes confides in the<br/>
wrong <span style="color: #0000FF;">lady-the </span>public cares about these<br/>
incidents of his activity only for a day<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
<br/>
THE MARCH OF EVENTS<br/>
<br/>
big simple fact is-Roosevelt and the People<br/>
against the criminally privileged Interests and<br/>
the soft critics. That is all that the people care<br/>
to know or that the future will remember; and<br/>
this is the only kind of simple great fact that<br/>
the people have ever cared about or that the<br/>
future has ever remembered.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">HOW </span>RAILROAD MAGNATES MAY BECOME<br/>
PUBLIC HEROES<br/>
<br/>
HERE was, a month ago, an amusing, if<br/>
<br/>
serious, stream of financial and corporation pilgrims to Washington. Messrs. Morgan,<br/>
Harriman (before the stolen letter appeared!),<br/>
Ryan, Speyer, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seligman</span>, Yoakum, and Mellen<br/>
are some of the pilgrims who went, whether<br/>
on their own accord or on invitation. The<br/>
reasons that led them are diverse, but in<br/>
general they wished to get the railroads and other<br/>
great <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>interests "in touch with the<br/>
President."<br/>
<br/>
Some went to protest against the Federal<br/>
"interference" with corporations. Others<br/>
went to point out to the President that Federal<br/>
"interference" is necessary in order to save<br/>
the corporations from grave injustice at the<br/>
hands of the states. A few went merely to<br/>
discuss the situation. One or two, perhaps,<br/>
went in a spirit of bravado and defiance; but<br/>
most went in a spirit of proper deference to<br/>
consult the head of the nation. It is a new<br/>
and wholesome sign of the times, this tendency<br/>
to remove the veil of secrecy from railroad<br/>
operations.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. E. H. Harriman is reported to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>said in a newspaper <span style="color: #0000FF;">interview </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little while<br/>
ago:<br/>
<br/>
"We [ the <span style="color: #0000FF;">railroad'magnates</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>have left it to our lawyers<br/>
to take care of legislation by whatever means might be<br/>
most effective, and to our subordinates to explain things<br/>
to the general public. It won't do. If we are<br/>
ever to extricate the railroads, we have got to come out <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
</span>the open and tell the people the railroads' side of the<br/>
matter."<br/>
<br/>
This hits the quick; and nobody has explained the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gause </span>of all our troubles about the<br/>
railroads more clearly than it is explained in<br/>
these sentences. For the gist of the whole<br/>
matter is, the railroad managers have not<br/>
"come out in the open." If they had done so<br/>
from the first, we should never have had any<br/>
acute trouble; for the public would not have<br/>
had any case against them.<br/>
<br/>
Such questions as rates and fares, with<br/>
which the lawmakers and the commissions <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
