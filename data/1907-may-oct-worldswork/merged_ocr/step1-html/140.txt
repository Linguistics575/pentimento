The Navy Department realized the importance<br/>
of this part of the celebration and detailed<br/>
Rear-Admiral Harrington, who has been in<br/>
the Navy for more than forty years, as chairman of the Exposition Naval Board. The<br/>
great battle between the Merrimac and the<br/>
Monitor is reproduced in the same position<br/>
these old ironclads occupied when they fought<br/>
their terrible fight during the Civil War. This<br/>
famous engagement was fought near the Exposition grounds, just off the point, on Hampton Roads.<br/>
<br/>
The military display, ashore, is correspondingly elaborate. Immense camping grounds,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">11,000 </span>men, were laid out <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>military board appointed by the Secretary of<br/>
War, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>drill plain of thirty<br/>
acres, called the Lee Parade, is used for the<br/>
manoeuvres of the troops. The great parade<br/>
ground, level as a floor, is surrounded by a row<br/>
of full-grown apple trees. The encampment<br/>
consists of several thousand regulars of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>

<br/>
For the first time in the history of the United<br/>
States, armed <span style="color: #ff0000;">troopsof </span>a foreign country have<br/>
been permitted to land on our soil. The<br/>
military feature is an attractive one. In<br/>
response to an invitation from the President<br/>
of the United States, Great Britain, Germany,<br/>
France, Russia, Japan, Denmark, Venezuela,<br/>
Mexico, Costa Rica, Haiti, Belgium, Argentina,<br/>
and the Dominican Republic have sent troops,<br/>
as well as ships of war. This vast army, en<br/>

<br/>
camped at the Exposition grounds in long<br/>
lines of white tents, stretching as far as the eye<br/>
can reach, makes an impression not soon to be<br/>
forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
Among the most noted organizations to<br/>
attend the Exposition are those of the Ancient<br/>
and Honorable Artillery, of London and of<br/>
Boston-similar organizations, the oldest and<br/>
most honored, of their respective cities. The<br/>
Confederate Veterans, uniformed in gray, are<br/>
also here, and awaken <span style="color: #0000FF;">memories </span>of the days<br/>
when they stood in battle array on many Virginia fields. Fraternal organizations in uniform will be present much of the time.<br/>
<br/>
On account of the location, the sports and<br/>
amusements of the Exposition comprise many<br/>
new features. The International Yacht Races<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
