</span>The women rub the clothes on the round stones of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-bed<br/>
</span>and dry them on the bank. The milk-cans prove that the photograph<br/>
has been taken since the Americans landed<br/>

<br/>
But most of the roads of the interior were<br/>
tortuous trails over which no <span style="color: #0000FF;">wheeled </span>vehicle<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>description could pass. A single ride<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adjuntas </span>to Utuado and thence northeast<br/>
to the capital would furnish the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">adventurous </span>with "thrills" enough to last him for a<br/>
long time. Here are <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few experiences that<br/>
will soon <span style="color: #0000FF;">exist </span>only in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>nightmares of<br/>
American cavalry horses:<br/>
<br/>
Between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adjuntas </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Utuado</span>, avalanches<br/>
of earth would slide down overnight; the rider<br/>
who did not wish to risk his life needlessly<br/>
would dismount, take the bridle rein and crawl<br/>
around the landslide in front of his horse, so<br/>
that if the latter went over the precipice, he<br/>
need not follow. A little further on would be a<br/>
mountain torrent, in crossing which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse<br/>

</span>A MODERN PURTO <span style="color: #0000FF;">mew </span>LAUNDRY<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">wash-tub </span>and washboard are almost as new to the island as the<br/>
trolley and the steam-plow<br/>
<br/>
might be thrown by boulders beneath the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface </span>of the water. At a point where there was<br/>
room on the trail for one horse, he would perhaps meet a pack-train of donkeys, with baskets<br/>
of coffee <span style="color: #0000FF;">projecting </span>a yard on each side of the<br/>
animals; <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the driver was in the rear, the<br/>
donkeys would push steadily forward, thrusting<br/>
the horseman into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">underbrush</span>. But this<br/>
was a fairly good highway compared with what<br/>
lay to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Utuado</span>. There were wild<br/>
plunges down the mountain sides where the<br/>
horse seemed in danger of turning <span style="color: #0000FF;">somersaults</span>;<br/>
there were rugged slopes as steep as the roof<br/>
of a house up which one must climb for half <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>mile or more. Even when traveling in a horizontal direction, the trail was full of mud that<br/>
held the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hoofs </span>like glue, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dug </span>out by the<br/>
<br/>
