<span>INVESTING A SAVINGS BANK FUND<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there is practically no chance in<br/>
such an investment for any very large profits.<br/>
It is true that the bonds are convertible into<br/>
Pennsylvania Railroad stock on any November<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist </span>or May Ist, if the holder has given notice<br/>
a month in advance. If one decided to make<br/>
that exchange, he would receive 700 in stock<br/>
for his $ 1,000 in bonds. The consequence is<br/>
that if the stock should during the next five<br/>
years sell at a price higher than I40 per cent.<br/>
of its par value, the bonds would probably sell<br/>
higher than par also. The company can retire<br/>
them at 102% and interest on any interest day,<br/>
but must give notice ninety days in advance.<br/>
These facts give to the investment just the<br/>
slightest touch of a speculative value. It is<br/>
not at all against the issue.<br/>
<br/>
This form of investment is covered at some<br/>
length, because it seems to fit a larger proportion of the inquiries than any other form of<br/>
investment of which we have knowledge. Yet<br/>
there are a few such savers of money who <span style="color: #0000FF;">insist </span>on getting a permanent investment to yield<br/>
them 7 per cent., or some other high rate. It<br/>
is wise to hesitate before encouraging anyone<br/>
to take money out of the bank to try and get a<br/>
high return from it. It is possible to get 7<br/>
per cent. with a great deal of safety, but usually<br/>
one cannot at the same time have the money<br/>
in a form from which it may be recovered<br/>
quickly, as it can from the bonds. There are<br/>
a few preferred industrial stocks, small issues<br/>
on great corporations that pay dividends on<br/>
their common stocks and have done so for<br/>
years, that are desirable-but they are few.<br/>
We know of practically no bonds that yield so<br/>
high a return into which small savings should<br/>
be sunk.<br/>
<br/>
The depositor who has from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000<br/>
in the banks is usually more confident in his<br/>
search for investments than is the smaller<br/>
investor. In most cases that have come to us,<br/>
the depositor has made former investments.<br/>
In giving advice to such depositors, it is not at<br/>
all unusual this year to advise the purchase of<br/>
a block of notes yielding over 6 per cent. if<br/>
held to maturity. There is a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">vaiiety </span>of<br/>
these notes at the present time, and if the buyer<br/>
goes to a solid banking house he runs little<br/>
risk of getting anything that will go wrong.<br/>
No one can imagine a condition of affairs that<br/>
will compel the Pennsylvania, the New York<br/>
Central, the Louisville & Nashville, the North<br/>
American Company, or the Atlantic Coast<br/>
Line to fail to pay <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>interest and <span style="color: #0000FF;">principal<br/>
<br/>
</span>9280<br/>
<br/>
of their notes that fall due in the next few <span style="color: #ff0000;">vears</span>.<br/>
The main disadvantage of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">notes </span>is<br/>
their short term, compelling <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">im </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esnment<br/>
</span>in three years or so. Of course, it they were<br/>
not so short they would not give so much<br/>
revenue. The savings bank depositor may<br/>
find it worth while to make the investment<br/>
merely for the three years, figuring that the<br/>
6 per cent. is quite enough inducement. If<br/>
at the end of the three years there is nothing<br/>
else worth doing in the line of investment, he<br/>
can put his money back into the bank and<br/>
count himself a gainer by the additional interest.<br/>
<br/>
From the above, the policy of THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">WORLD'S<br/>
</span>WORK in giving advice to this class of investors<br/>
may be pretty clearly judged. Under the<br/>
restrictions noted, the range of possible investment covers these securities:<br/>
High-class <span style="color: #ff0000;">bonds<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">High-class </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stocks</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Notes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
. yield 4 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">fill<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>yield 4 to 7%<br/>
.. yield <span style="color: #0000FF;">4</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">65</span>%<br/>
<br/>
Very few industrial common stocks <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>advisable for even the best-versed of these<br/>
investors. Railroad stocks should be bought<br/>
only with the nicest discrimination, and only at<br/>
a time when the yield is very high and the<br/>
dividends are secure, so far as well-versed men<br/>
may judge. Mining stocks and new industrial<br/>
promotions should be absolutely <span style="color: #0000FF;">barred</span>. Only<br/>
in cases where high revenue seems <span style="color: #ff0000;">necessmy<br/>
</span>should even the better class railroad stocks<br/>
and industrials be considered. It should be<br/>
understood that the real investor who <span style="color: #0000FF;">desires<br/>
</span>only perfect safety and stability rather than a<br/>
chance for large profits on his principal cannot, even at this time when bonds are cheap,<br/>
get much if any over <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>per cent. on his money.<br/>
<br/>
The average reader may judge for <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself<br/>
</span>in what class of investors he belongs. W hen he<br/>
has done that, carefully weighing and considering his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">finances</span>, the responsibilities<br/>
that rest upon him, the possible calls upon his<br/>
capital that he will have to meet within the<br/>
next few years and his ability to meet them, then<br/>
he is properly in a position to draw his money<br/>
from the savings bank and invest it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>If he is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>all uncertain on any of these points, he<br/>
should not become an investor except in the<br/>
most conservative way. For the savings bank<br/>
account is not merely a method of <span style="color: #ff0000;">savin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">g </span>money;<br/>
it is also an anchor to windward. So long as<br/>
there is the slightest chance that it will be<br/>
needed in that capacity it should not be depleted, even though the interest return is low<br/>
and the growth of the principal extremely slow.<br/>
