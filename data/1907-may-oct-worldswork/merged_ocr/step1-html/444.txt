<br/>
The furnishings for the House caucus room<br/>
cost the state $ 117,258, or enough to build<br/>
and furnish thirty <span style="color: #0000FF;">3-story </span>brick dwellings. The<br/>
Senate telephone room, eight feet by ten and<br/>
without a telephone, is charged with $ 16,397<br/>
for woodwork and furniture. A cup-rack in<br/>
the Senate barber-shop cost Sanderson $ 325,<br/>
but was billed to the state at $ 3,256. An<br/>
ordinary bootblack stand with two plain<br/>
mahogany chairs cost Sanderson $ 125, but cost<br/>
the state $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,660</span>.<br/>
<br/>
For fitting up some rooms in the attic, Payne<br/>
& Company charged $ 303,693.14. Personal<br/>
inspection of some of those rooms by the writer<br/>
showed only bare quarters for draughtsmen<br/>
and the like. Fifty pairs of "specially de<br/>
signed" andirons were furnished by Sanderson<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>at $ 73.60 a pair. Henry S. Calvert, secretary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Investigating Commission, testified that<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">PENNSYLVANIA</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span>PALACE OF GRAFT<br/>
<br/>
he had bought the identical pattern of goods<br/>
in the open market for $ 33 and was told by<br/>
the dealer that the design had been kept<br/>
regularly in stock for a dozen years. Room<br/>
402 is the headquarters of the Investigating<br/>
Commission. To furnish and decorate it cost<br/>
Sanderson just $ 130. But it cost the state<br/>
$ 1,139.04 to settle with Sanderson. Several<br/>
pages of this magazine might be filled with<br/>
instances such as these.<br/>
<br/>
T. L. Snyder, of Clearfield, <span style="color: #0000FF;">testified </span>that<br/>
while State Treasurer Berry was making his<br/>
exposures last fall, former State Treasurer<br/>
Frank G. Harris placed his property in his,<br/>
Snyder's, hands, and announced that he was<br/>
ready to sell out and move to Oregon, where<br/>
the climate would better agree with his health.<br/>
Snyder also told of hardwood floors, which<br/>
had been laid in Harris's house at Clearfield<br/>
by "Sanderson's men," and of the manner in<br/>
which Harris, while Treasurer, collected $ 500<br/>
due from a relative by taking it out of salary<br/>
Snyder received as assistant sergeant-at-arms<br/>
of the House of Representatives.<br/>
<br/>
A graft of some $ 7,000,000 out of a total<br/>
expenditure <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>$ 9, ooo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">oocr</span>---the exact amount<br/>
has not been definitely ascertained as <span style="color: #ff0000;">yetstaggers </span>the imagination. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is positive genius!<br/>
One's brain whirls between indignation at the<br/>
crime and admiration of the intelligence that<br/>
could devise it and go so intimately into details<br/>
that no scheme for getting hold of the last<br/>
fraction of a dollar seems to have been overlooked. These men have pushed outward the<br/>
limits of human endeavor. Meekly and <span style="color: #0000FF;">shamefacedly</span>, we are proud. It is our funeral, but<br/>
what a monumental funeral! Where else in<br/>
the world could a four million and a half<br/>
building cost nine millions to furnish?<br/>
<br/>
THE INEVITABLE RESULT<br/>
<br/>
The result of the insatiable greed of the machine and the revelations of monumental graft<br/>
will be the election of a class of men who will<br/>
serve Pennsylvania first and their party afterward. An unattached vote made William H.<br/>
Berry Treasurer, although he was a Democrat,<br/>
and it had to <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>over a <span style="color: #0000FF;">400,000 </span>Republican<br/>
majority to do it. That was under the stress<br/>
of excitement. The same vote last year, acting<br/>
with the utmost coolness, forced the nomination<br/>
of Governor Stuart, who is now pushing the<br/>
probe to the bottom of the festering mass of<br/>
graft, of which the much glorified capitol is<br/>
the token now and bids. fair to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>the tomb,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
