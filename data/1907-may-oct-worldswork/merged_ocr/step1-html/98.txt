(2) Something like 20 per cent. of the physicians in the larger cities have handsome incomes, in return for expert work and much of it.<br/>

(3) Eighty per cent. of city physicians and<br/>
most of the country doctors make little more<br/>
than a decent living-many not even that.<br/>

<br/>
</span>a brief review of the article in question<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>While I agree with the writer in some<br/>
particulars, I am of the opinion that he is<br/>
in error in others. Although he does not<br/>
specifically say so, I should judge that Mr.<br/>
Forbes's experience and observations were<br/>
limited to service with one of the hastily thrown<br/>
together volunteer regiments raised for the<br/>
Spanish War. The conditions that existed<br/>
in many of those regiments were chaotic.<br/>
Many of the officers knew only the rudiments<br/>
of their business, and the handling of the ration<br/>
was atrocious, the food being poorly cooked<br/>
and served in any old manner.<br/>
<br/>
These conditions are inseparable from a<br/>
dependence on hastily raised volunteers in<br/>
time of war. If the army that we collected in<br/>
1898 had been soundly whipped, as it would<br/>
have been if it had gone up against the troops<br/>
of a first-class military nation, a valuable <span style="color: #0000FF;">lesson </span>might have <span style="color: #0000FF;">percolated </span>itself into the minds<br/>
of the American people-and as promptly<br/>
oozed out again, for the teachings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bladensburg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Bull Run had been forgotten by <span style="color: #0000FF;">1898</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">IN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">RESPONSE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">your </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">request</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">write<br/>
<br/>
</span>As a former volunteer officer, I feel that I<br/>
may speak with perfect frankness on this subject; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ivdo </span>not cherish any delusions to the<br/>
effect that several hundred thousand <span style="color: #ff0000;">rides<br/>
</span>placed in the hands of an equal number of<br/>
patriotic and brave but untrained men constitute an army. So that if Mr. Forbes's observations are based merely on service with the<br/>
force raised in 1898, he is apt to err. Some<br/>
of the conditions he refers to, especially poor<br/>
rations, do not apply to the regular army to-day;<br/>
and it is desertions from this force and an unwillingness of men to <span style="color: #ff0000;">retinlist </span>in it that form<br/>
his text. His strictures on the ill-fitting, sloppy<br/>
uniform were well founded but are no longer<br/>
apt, as the olive-drab service uniform now<br/>
being issued is a vast improvement over its<br/>
predecessor. All that a man wearing it has<br/>
to do to look well is to keep it clean, keep his<br/>
blouse buttoned, and carry himself properly.<br/>
The issue of this uniform was greatly delayed<br/>
by the large number of old blue uniforms<br/>
accumulated during the Spanish War, which<br/>
had to be utilized as a matter of economy.<br/>
