<span>9120 WHAT FRANCE<br/>
declared against public vandalism or when the<br/>
city proposes a new monument or a new<br/>
statue, the papers immediately interview the<br/>
artists, thus affording the municipal authorities<br/>
and the general public a body of expert opinion<br/>
--a better way, I take it, than leaving matters<br/>
of taste to the discretion of an uncommonly<br/>
common Common Council!<br/>
<br/>
One would hardly expect an object lesson<br/>
from Algiers, but I nevertheless saw something there that I coveted for America.<br/>
Richly oriental, yet magnificently <span style="color: #0000FF;">French</span>,<br/>
that colonial city has imitated the arcades of<br/>
the Rue de Rivoli. A row of pillars runs along<br/>
the curb and supports the upper stories of the<br/>
buildings, which jut out over the sidewalk,<br/>
making a roof for a sort of corridor, with the<br/>
street on one side and the shop fronts on the<br/>
other, so as to shelter you against both <span style="color: #ff0000;">surfand<br/>
</span>rain; for the French genius, while solicitous<br/>
for beauty, is equally solicitous for comfort.<br/>
In Paris, the city guards you even against<br/>
fatigue; you have never far to look for a bench,<br/>
and you do not attract attention by sitting<br/>
upon it, any more than by sitting at luncheon<br/>
in front of a Parisian <span style="color: #ff0000;">caf√©</span>. Meanwhile, Paris<br/>
guards you against din. With the exception<br/>
of Paris-Sport and La <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fame</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">newspapers<br/>
</span>are quietly sold in pretty little kiosks; and<br/>
instead of paving their famous streets with<br/>
granite blocks, the Parisians prefer wood,<br/>
from which proceeds so little noise that you<br/>
need not raise your voice above conversational<br/>
tones as you stroll the Grand Boulevards,<br/>
though the wheeled <span style="color: #ff0000;">trafhc </span>there is simply<br/>
astounding.<br/>
<br/>
And now observe a further detail: you are<br/>
helped to find your way-not merely by names<br/>
of streets, plainly and conspicuously labeled,<br/>
but also by numbers so placed upon houses as<br/>
to be easily discovered. Here we hide them<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-at </span>least in effect. There's absolutely no<br/>
telling what you are looking for or where to<br/>
look for it-whether big or little numerals,<br/>
gilt or bronze or porcelain, black on white or<br/>
white on black, while not by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shrewdest<br/>
</span>guess can you determine whether to search<br/>
upon door or transom or gate or window. In<br/>
Paris, however, you invariably find the number<br/>
on the wall of the building a little above the<br/>
first-story windows, and it is uniformly a<br/>
square blue table with large white numerals.<br/>
You cannot miss it. A small matter, this?<br/>
Yes, but one of countless small matters that<br/>
illustrate the earnestness with which the French<br/>
<br/>
CAN TEACH US<br/>
<br/>
intellect has essayed to alleviate the annoyance<br/>
and discomforts of city life and to raise municipal management to the dignity of a fine art.<br/>
<br/>
But by no means a small matter is that splendid institution-the cab that goes. No Parisian<br/>
thinks of cabs as things that stand hour after<br/>
hour in front of hotels and railway stations,<br/>
refusing to move unless you agree to a fare that<br/>
only the imbecile or the desperate will pay.<br/>
Instead, the Parisian thinks of cabs as running<br/>
constantly, almost, and at a price so modest<br/>
that when there are three passengers they<br/>
would hardly economize on taking a'bus.<br/>
Here you have one of the notable differences<br/>
between France and America; we pay cabs<br/>
to stand still, mostly; they pay theirs to go.<br/>
And they have found a way to fix the price by<br/>
machinery, so there will be no squabbling<br/>
with the driver as you alight. Next to his seat<br/>
is a dial and on top of the dial a little red flag<br/>
with the word "Libre" on it. When the cab<br/>
starts, the coachman pushes down the flag,<br/>
thus setting the mechanism going. The figures<br/>
on the dial keep changing as you ride and<br/>
register your increasing indebtedness<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
contrivance will reckon by time or by distance,<br/>
take account of halts, and even record the<br/>
duration of the intervals when a sightseer has<br/>
ordered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooker </span>to "drive slowly, please."<br/>
The best of it is that the machine, which the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>call the <span style="color: #0000FF;">taximetre</span>, can't cheat.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose, now, that we leave the street and<br/>
see what art, as applied to comfort-in the<br/>
broad sense Consul-General Mason would<br/>
give the word art-has done for the house.<br/>
Note its usual arrangement around a court and<br/>
its preference for a garden at the rear. The<br/>
court lets in air and sunshine, while affording<br/>
quiet to the rooms looking out upon it; and<br/>
the garden becomes also a living-room, even<br/>
a dining-room, if you like, for it is wholly<br/>
secluded from the highway. In this respect the<br/>
French town house is the American town<br/>
house turned completely around, with the front<br/>
yard behind. The ornamental space that is<br/>
all for show with us is all for enjoyment with<br/>
the French. Notice also that the garden is<br/>
not sodded; gravel serves better than grass,<br/>
since you are not afraid to tread on it and the<br/>
rain soaks through it so quickly that you can<br/>
go out directly after a shower.<br/>
<br/>
As compared with our Gallic cousins, we<br/>
are an indoor people. They keep in the open<br/>
air all they can-sit there at their pleasure,<br/>
whenever possible at their work. Besides,<br/>
