<span>A NEGRO'S UPHILL CLIMB<br/>
<br/>
the Hampton boys would accept his decisions,<br/>
even though he were a colored man. I have<br/>
never had any occasion to believe my supposition incorrect. I have been most fortunate in<br/>
having as an able and loyal assistant one of the<br/>
boys who worked with me at the saw-mill,<br/>
Captain Allen Washington, who deserves an<br/>
equal share in any success that may have come<br/>
to the disciplinary part of Hampton Institute<br/>
during the past decade and a half. People<br/>
often wonder how the two races get along<br/>
together at Hampton. The truth of the<br/>
matter is that there has never been any manifestation of unpleasant relations between the<br/>
two. They have met on common ground,<br/>
each yielding to the other the respect due to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>and rank without regard to race or color.<br/>
Without doubt, the influence of each race upon<br/>
the other is good. The Indian has quite as<br/>
much pride in his race and ancestry as he<br/>
needs, and in this respect the Negro is lacking.<br/>
The Negro is accustomed to work and is<br/>
anxious to learn from the white man; the<br/>
Indian is unaccustomed to work, and is sometimes doubtful whether the white man's <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization </span>is the best for him.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after General Armstrong's death,<br/>
Mr. Frissell told me that he would like to have<br/>
me remain at Hampton and do what I could to<br/>
carry out the founder's wishes regarding Hampton's work for the Negro and Indian races.<br/>
I have continued my work along the same<br/>
general lines, giving perhaps more of my time<br/>
to administration and considerable of it to the<br/>
Northern campaign work, relieving Dr. Frissell and Dr. Turner, the chaplain, in some of<br/>
their efforts toward the raising of funds. I spent<br/>
two summers at the Harvard Summer School,<br/>
taking work in gymnastics under Dr. Sargent,<br/>
so that I could better help the boys in their<br/>
physical training.<br/>
<br/>
In the summer of 1901 I was urged to take<br/>
a rest, and one of Hampton's trustees was so<br/>
kind as to give me an opportunity of visiting<br/>
many of the principal countries of Europe.<br/>
I had never felt so hopeful about my own<br/>
people as I have since this trip. It opened my<br/>
eyes to the hardships and disadvantages of<br/>
people in Europe and I feel sure that our<br/>
difficulties in America do not begin to compare<br/>
with those of the average European peasant,<br/>
who, as a rule, is not so hopeful as the most<br/>
benighted American Negro. This trip broadened my views in many ways and increased my<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9201<br/>
<br/>
</span>courage and hope for the future of my race. I<br/>
have ever since been strongly of the opinion<br/>
that I had rather be a Negro in America than<br/>
be anything else anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
As to my work at Hampton, I am not sure<br/>
that I would not have accomplished more elsewhere. Certainly, what has come to me in<br/>
association and contact with the pupils and<br/>
teachers of Hampton is far more valuable than<br/>
anything I have been able to give. I am truly<br/>
glad that I have been able in a small measure<br/>
to lighten some of the burdens that Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rissell<br/>
</span>is carrying. I do not believe that there is a<br/>
man in America to-day who has done more<br/>
than he to find a common platform upon which<br/>
Northerners and Southerners and Negroes can<br/>
work in harmony and mutual helpfulness. It<br/>
seems to me a shame that with the immense<br/>
wealth of America and with so many generous<br/>
people, men like General Armstrong and Dr.<br/>
Frissell and Dr. Washington should be obliged<br/>
to go from place to place asking for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary </span>money to carry on the work of Hampton<br/>
and Tuskegee, expending the energy that<br/>
should go into the daily work of their schools.<br/>
I do not know of any man who is so able<br/>
to completely hide himself behind the cause<br/>
for which he labors as the Principal of Hampton Institute.<br/>
<br/>
It is a great privilege to have shared in the<br/>
work of the institution that has done so much<br/>
for me and my people. A more earnest, competent, devoted corps of workers cannot be<br/>
found than the men and women, mostly of the<br/>
Anglo-Saxon race, who are working at Hampton Institute. I do not think of them merely<br/>
as teachers of ignorant Negro and Indian<br/>
pupils, but as patriotic citizens striving to fit<br/>
these black and red children to share in the<br/>
blessings and privileges of our civilization. I<br/>
doubt if one could find a more earnest lot of<br/>
pupils than are to be found at Hampton, eager<br/>
to grasp the instruction given in trades, in<br/>
agriculture, in academic studies, in religion<br/>
and morals in order to go out and help in an<br/>
unselfish way their less fortunate brothers.<br/>
For I truly believe that unless modern civilization is a failure and Christianity an eternal<br/>
mockery, all of the worthy elements of our<br/>
population, even these black human creatures,<br/>
will be permitted to share equally in all the<br/>
fruits of our country according as they measure<br/>
up to the standards and requirements of this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
