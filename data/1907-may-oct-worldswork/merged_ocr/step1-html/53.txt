<span>FRICK, THE SILENT<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">retiring </span>figures, before men realized the significance of his two appearances. But just now<br/>
he is beginning again to emerge, this time in<br/>
the full stature of the powerful financier.<br/>
<br/>
The other appearances were at two important<br/>
crises of his life. The first, at the time of the<br/>
Homestead strike in Pennsylvania, had in it<br/>
the seeds of the bitter rivalry with Mr. Andrew<br/>
Carnegie that haunts him to-day. The second,<br/>
at the first disclosures of corruption within the<br/>
Equitable Life Assurance Society, was at the<br/>
time when he made an ambitious alliance with<br/>
Mr. Harriman.<br/>
<br/>
The Pennsylvania Railroad handles one<br/>
fourth of the freight in transit in the United<br/>
States at any given moment. Mr. Frick is<br/>
the largest stockholder in the Pennsylvania.<br/>
The United States Steel Corporation is the<br/>
greatest industrial combination in the United<br/>
States. Mr. Frick is in practical control of the<br/>
policies of the company.<br/>
<br/>
MR. FRICK <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>PRIVATE LIFE<br/>
<br/>
He was only fifty-seven years old last <span style="color: #0000FF;">December</span>. Mr. Harriman was fifty-nine years old<br/>
last February. But Mr. Frick is much younger<br/>
for he has a powerful constitution. Mr.<br/>
Frick is one of the "Pittsburg millionaires;"<br/>
but he seems to have none of the particular<br/>
qualities that have made of some of them a<br/>
jest and of others a stumbling block. He is<br/>
known in Pittsburg as "the Silent Man."<br/>
His home life is described by his friends as<br/>
ideal: quiet and devoted. He is a member of<br/>
the clubs, but not a club man. His personal<br/>
habits are methodical and fastidious, but simple<br/>
almost to austerity. No breath of any censure<br/>
of his private life is even whispered in the most<br/>
gossipy places of Pittsburg, where he has lived<br/>
for more than thirty years. His one indulgence is a passion for flowers, and his favorite<br/>
is the Chrysanthemum. His philanthropies are<br/>
not yet great, by comparison with the lavishness of other wealthy man, but their true bulk<br/>
is hidden by the fact that most of them are<br/>
dispensed through a friend who is pledged to<br/>
keep their source a secret.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of his life Mr. Frick is a<br/>
business man-in the homely phrase, "from<br/>
the ground up." He went into business at<br/>
sixteen, and he has pursued it with unflagging<br/>
zeal for forty-one years. The only indulgence<br/>
he has allowed himself in that pursuit has been<br/>
a passion to out-top Mr. Carnegie in everything in which Mr. Carnegie takes pride for<br/>
<br/>
8851<br/>
<br/>
preeminence, and that passion still possesses<br/>
him. It will appear later in this story.<br/>
<br/>
Henry Clay Frick was born in West Overton,<br/>
Westmoreland County, Pa., Dec. 19, 1849.<br/>
His father, John W. Frick, had been a farmer<br/>
in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but at the time of<br/>
H. <span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span>Frick's birth he was working as an engineer in the mill owned by Abraham Overholt,<br/>
at Broad Ford, Pa. John <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>Frick's wife<br/>
was Abraham Overholt's daughter, and H. C.<br/>
Frick was born in Mr. Overholt's house. He<br/>
was the second of five <span style="color: #0000FF;">children-thee </span>boys<br/>
and two girls. John W. Frick died many years<br/>
ago, but Mrs. Frick only a few years ago at the<br/>
age of eighty-six.<br/>
<br/>
The elder Frick was a failure in business.<br/>
As a result young Henry Clay was practically<br/>
adopted into the Overholt family when he was<br/>
about twelve years old. He had a few years<br/>
of common school at West Overton, a short<br/>
term at the Chester Military Academy, and a<br/>
few months at the Otterbein University in<br/>
Ohio. That completed his education, except<br/>
what he gained afterward by a studious <span style="color: #0000FF;">devotion </span>to books as a recreation from business.<br/>
<br/>
At sixteen, however, young Frick was tired<br/>
of schools. He was eager to be in business.<br/>
Through his grandfather's influence he was<br/>
placed as a clerk in the store of White, Orr &<br/>
Company, merchants. A little later he entered<br/>
his grandfather's distillery as bookkeeper.<br/>
From this position he went to Morgan &<br/>
Company, coke dealers, and at about twentyone years of age he appeared in Pittsburg as<br/>
their agent. A year or two later he joined a<br/>
company to build the Mt. Pleasant and Broad<br/>
Ford Railroad, a short line to penetrate the<br/>
Connellsville coke region. The road was<br/>
opened in 1871. It was a success. That was<br/>
the basis of the Frick fortune.<br/>
<br/>
ENTERS THE COKE BUSINESS<br/>
<br/>
These were the beginnings of Mr. Frick's<br/>
interest in the coke business, to which he gave<br/>
his undivided attention until 1882. In 1871,<br/>
the year the Mt. Pleasant and Broad Ford<br/>
Railroad was opened, Mr. Frick organized<br/>
the corporation of Frick & Company, coke<br/>
dealers, with the help of Mr. Abraham o.<br/>
Tintsman, one of his grandfather's partners.<br/>
This coke company bought 300 acres of soft<br/>
coal lands and <span style="color: #0000FF;">SI </span>coke ovens in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Connellsville </span>region, and a year later added "<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">So </span>ovens<br/>
to its equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the panic <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'73</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Everywhere<br/>
