<span>THE TIME TO QUIT WORK<br/>
<br/>
much he is good for and has made careful<br/>
calculations, he is likely to be "all in" before<br/>
he gets to the end. Every step makes an<br/>
inroad on his reserve energy. The last spurt<br/>
costs more than all the rest together.<br/>
<br/>
If a man has covered his distance without<br/>
touching this final turn of the fatigue curve,<br/>
he will get rested in a reasonably short time<br/>
and be able to go over the course again. But <span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span>,<br/>
instead, he has to keep on, teeth set, eyes<br/>
bulging, "hugging his corn cobs," until he<br/>
rolls over on the ground, it may take weeks for<br/>
him to get into good form again. In a big<br/>
race, naturally, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>'s got to be ready to do that.<br/>
<br/>
There are emergencies in <span style="color: #ff0000;">cvcrybody</span>'s life<br/>
when the merely prudent thing isn't the right<br/>
thing. If a house is on <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>and a family on<br/>
the top floor is in danger, and you're the only<br/>
person on the premises, you can't stand calmly<br/>
aside and calculate your fatigue curve. <span style="color: #0000FF;">There's<br/>
</span>a necessity for action-at any cost whatever,<br/>
even life.<br/>
<br/>
A man may have a big proposition to put<br/>
through, some important combination to effect,<br/>
a new movement to get under way. Perhaps<br/>
he is the only person who knows the whole<br/>
situation: success may depend on him. In<br/>
such a case, he must let mere prudence go by<br/>
the board-and he must stand ready to pay<br/>
the price, too, when that's called for.<br/>
<br/>
But such emergencies are not everyday<br/>
matters. To-morrow we are going to have<br/>
another day's business to attend to, and the<br/>
probability is that it will be just as important<br/>
as to-day's. Consequently, we have no right<br/>
to over-drive ourselves to-day; for the price<br/>
of it will be taken out of the quality of to-morrow's work. We have done enough when we<br/>
have come in sight of that last costly lap. It's<br/>
the time to quit.<br/>
<br/>
A great deal of interesting information about<br/>
the nature of fatigue has been made available<br/>
through the ergograph, an ingenious recording<br/>
apparatus devised by Professor Angelo Mosso,<br/>
a great Italian scientist. It works something<br/>
after this fashion: you lay your hand, back<br/>
down, on a little table, and to the end of one<br/>
finger is attached a cord which connects horizontally over a pulley with a small hanging<br/>
weight. The motion of closing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finger </span>lifts<br/>
the weight; and as the effort is repeated over<br/>
and over again, the fatigue symptoms in the<br/>
finger become clear and can be observed and<br/>
recorded in detail.<br/>
<br/>
Now one of the important discoveries that<br/>
<br/>
9197<br/>
<br/>
Professor Mosso has made is that, if you keep<br/>
raising the weight until your finger is exhausted,<br/>
it will take just about two hours to rest it; that<br/>
is, in two hours you can do the same amount<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finger-work </span>over again-and the least bit<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
You would imagine from this that if the<br/>
experiment <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>repeated at the end of one<br/>
hour instead of two, you could do just half the<br/>
amount of work. But it's only <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-quarter<br/>
</span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">much</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>That's the price of work on top of fatigue.<br/>
One <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfatigued </span>man is to his work as four<br/>
semi-fatigued men to the same work. Using all<br/>
the strength you have, you can't begin to get<br/>
normal results; and the strain on will and<br/>
nervous energy is <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrific</span>. Carrying a thing<br/>
through on "nerve" is the costliest business<br/>
a man can indulge in.<br/>
<br/>
Some people, especially those of nervous<br/>
make-up, find it hard to tell when the stopping<br/>
point has been reached-that is, just where the<br/>
dividing line comes between energy-funds<br/>
available for investment and a capital which<br/>
cannot be legitimately tampered with. If they<br/>
get interested in their work, they lose sight of<br/>
everything else, and are going on sheer nerve<br/>
before they realize it.<br/>
<br/>
Though fatigue symptoms vary greatly in<br/>
different people, it may be worth while to mention a few of them here. Sometimes there is<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flushing </span>at the temples. That is the case<br/>
with myself when I have been reading hard<br/>
for two or three hours; and then I know that<br/>
I ought to call a halt. I could keep on reading<br/>
with undiminished interest for a good deal<br/>
longer; but it would be at the price of a sleepless night.<br/>
<br/>
With some people, a sure sign is the increased<br/>
circulation of blood in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cars </span>or checks.<br/>
Some people have queer feelings in the pit of<br/>
the stomach-not nausea, but something suggestive of it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most reliable tests is the control<br/>
test-holding the arms out horizontally at the<br/>
sides and noticing whether or not the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fingers<br/>
</span>tremble. The fatigue condition raises the<br/>
nerve-pressure gate and allows flow-overs from<br/>
one nerve into another. Normally a nervous<br/>
impulse goes along its <span style="color: #0000FF;">nerve </span>directly to the point<br/>
of strain; but when you are fatigued the stimulus spreads into other nerves as well and is not<br/>
distinctly transmitted.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Francis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gallon</span>, the great statistician,<br/>
says that the best test he knows is that of<br/>
<br/>
