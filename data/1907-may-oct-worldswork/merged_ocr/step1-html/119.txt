<br/>
new ideas, and new ideals. But the first year<br/>
in day school was different, because I had in a<br/>
measure assimilated many of these new ideas.<br/>
While I learned a great deal from books during<br/>
my night-school year, that was insignificant as<br/>
compared with the indescribable something<br/>
--very real at Hampton-which I cannot<br/>
express in <span style="color: #0000FF;">writing </span>but which was very tangible.<br/>
In the Junior year, I came in contact daily<br/>
with half a dozen or more lady teachers of the<br/>
sturdy New England type; while many of<br/>
their subjects were not entirely new, the presentation was so different and they touched so<br/>
practically upon everyday life that I found<br/>
myself for the first few months in a realm<br/>
almost as strange as during my first year at<br/>
Hampton. Perhaps the most striking subject<br/>
during my Junior year was zoology, taught by<br/>
Miss Ford, who afterward became the wife of<br/>
General Armstrong. The investigation and<br/>
dissecting of insects and animals of various<br/>
sorts was a constant and appalling revelation<br/>
to me of my dense ignorance of the things with<br/>
which I had been dealing all my life. There<br/>
are few teachers who could have aroused her<br/>
pupils to more enthusiastic work than did Mrs.<br/>
Armstrong.<br/>
<br/>
At the close of school, in June, I was promoted to the Middle class. I asked that I<br/>
might remain at Hampton and work during<br/>
the summer vacation, for the $ 80 saved during<br/>
my twelve months of work at the sawmill was<br/>
considerably reduced. So I was given work<br/>
as janitor of one of the boys' dormitories and<br/>
also of the academic building, for we had night<br/>
school in the summer then. It was to me a very<br/>
pleasant summer. I went home for a two<br/>
weeks' vacation in August-my first trip since<br/>
I had come to Hampton, nearly two years before. I was anxious to see my parents and<br/>
friends, but I think I was even more anxious<br/>
to show my uniform with its first-lieutenant's<br/>
shoulder-straps. Everybody seemed glad to<br/>
see <span style="color: #0000FF;">me-the </span>white as well as the colored people<br/>
--and the older white people were especially<br/>
cordial. The young white men with whom I<br/>
had grown up avoided me whenever possible.<br/>
This I could not then understand.<br/>
<br/>
The Middle year was not very different from<br/>
the Junior. The subject that had the greatest<br/>
influence upon my life <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the theory and<br/>
practice of teaching, which they now call<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pedagogics</span>. I think they were afraid to call<br/>
it by such a big name in my day, for fear it<br/>
might frighten us. It was then the rule at<br/>
<br/>
8917<br/>
<br/>
Hampton that every student was required to<br/>
teach for at least one term before entering upon<br/>
his Senior studies, so a part of the course in<br/>
practice teaching was taken up in the Middle<br/>
year. I don't know whether the impression<br/>
made upon me was due as much to the subject<br/>
in hand as to the teacher. We had a sort of<br/>
conference on human nature-l suppose they<br/>
would call it psychology now-and I feel the<br/>
influence of those conferences to this day.<br/>
<br/>
In June I was promoted to the Senior class<br/>
and given a certificate recommending me to<br/>
teach in the schools of Virginia, provided I<br/>
passed an examination satisfactory to the<br/>
state school officials. That summer I spent as<br/>
headwaiter at a hotel in Pennsylvania, but<br/>
hotel life did not appeal to me.<br/>
<br/>
When the season closed, I returned home<br/>
and secured a school in Cumberland County,<br/>
early in September. As my school was not<br/>
to open before the middle of October, I secured<br/>
work on the farm in the meantime from a Mr.<br/>
Walthall, a white neighbor of my people. It<br/>
surprised the colored community to have a<br/>
boy who had gone to school, finished his<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">eddication</span>" (as they supposed), passed the<br/>
county examination, and been appointed a<br/>
teacher, go out on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>farm and work as a day<br/>
laborer. It also surprised my white neighbors,<br/>
and many of them came over to the field where<br/>
I worked to see if it were really true. It was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>sort of curiosity in those days to see a colored<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">school-teacher </span>working as a farm laborer. I<br/>
opened school about the middle <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">October </span>with<br/>
something like half a dozen pupils. The number<br/>
increased daily until on the first of November<br/>
I had over <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOO </span>and by December there were<br/>
150. I asked for an assistant teacher, which<br/>
was granted me. The school was located in a<br/>
fine community where an unusually large number of colored people owned their own land<br/>
and where a great many more were <span style="color: #ff0000;">graduallly<br/>
</span>buying farms. There were four Negro<br/>
churches within a radius of five miles and there<br/>
were enough people to support <span style="color: #0000FF;">them-the </span>way<br/>
they were supported. Fortunately, they had<br/>
preaching at each church about once a month,<br/>
so that the teachers could generally get around<br/>
to each church at every meeting-day. They<br/>
were always expected to speak and also to<br/>
teach a Sunday-school class. I enjoyed this<br/>
work very much. It is easy for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Negro </span>teacher<br/>
to get the respect and confidence of his people<br/>
and he can do almost anything with them if<br/>
he leads an <span style="color: #0000FF;">earnest</span>, honorable life among them.<br/>
