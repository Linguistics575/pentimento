<span>9232 CAN HUMAN LIFE<br/>
<br/>
As the result of the great revolutions growing<br/>
out of Pasteur's discoveries regarding fermentation, present views and leanings may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">defined </span>somewhat as follows:<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span>) The processes of life formation are<br/>
founded in chemical re-combinations of matter.<br/>
<br/>
(2) All matter must be split up <span style="color: #ff0000;">into </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.its<br/>
</span>ultimate <span style="color: #0000FF;">forms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">corpuscles</span>, atoms, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">molecules-bcfore </span>it can form new combinations;<br/>
they are the structural bricks of the universe.<br/>
<br/>
(3) This dissolution into primary forms in<br/>
organic, or living, matter is accomplished by<br/>
fermentation.<br/>
<br/>
(4) <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the process of dissolution, the particles<br/>
of matter become electrically charged into<br/>
positive and negative "ions"; therefore,<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>) The force which underlies the <span style="color: #0000FF;">affinities<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">antagonisms </span>of molecular matter, which<br/>
causes some substances to fly to one another<br/>
and others to fly apart, is ultimately electrical.<br/>
<br/>
(6) Those combinations which can <span style="color: #ff0000;">growhold </span>their individuality and keep adding to <span style="color: #0000FF;">iti<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">constitute </span>life.<br/>
<br/>
(7) Growth and decay are both accomplished<br/>
through fermentation, the one constructive,<br/>
and the other destructive.<br/>
<br/>
(8) Aside from accidents, the measure of<br/>
one's years depends upon the relative strength<br/>
of these two antagonistic ferments in the body.<br/>
<br/>
For man to stay the hand of time, to extend<br/>
the condition of youth or to check growth in<br/>
any living thing, he must be able to interfere<br/>
with an apparently universal law of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Naturethat </span>every individual growth has a limited era<br/>
in which it can build faster than the ferments<br/>
will pull down. This he can do to some extent.<br/>
To be able to do this is almost to be able to<br/>
create life out of chemicals. This has been done<br/>
to some extent, but these wonderful achievements are a long way from controlling the<br/>
advance of age in the human being. But<br/>
though the functions of man, compared with<br/>
those of an angle-worm, are enormously<br/>
multiplied, yet the variety of materials is very<br/>
slight. The size of the fertilizing cell of reproduction in the mouse and guinea pig is twice<br/>
as large as the cell in man and the elephant.<br/>
<br/>
THE RESULTS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED<br/>
<br/>
Until the middle of the nineteenth century,<br/>
chemists knew only how to "analyze" matter,<br/>
to separate a compound into its primary<br/>
elements. Then began the development of<br/>
the reverse <span style="color: #0000FF;">process-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">synthetic</span>" chemistry,<br/>
or the putting together again-constructive,<br/>
<br/>
BE LENGTHENED?<br/>
<br/>
inorganic chemistry. Attack was next made<br/>
on the problems of synthetic production of<br/>
living matter. To-day there are over 50,000<br/>
artificial chemical products, many of them<br/>
(like the indigo and rose madder dyes) putting<br/>
an end to their manufacture by gardening.<br/>
Dozens of elements contribute to the synthesis<br/>
of inorganic compounds, while four-carbon,<br/>
oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen-almost wholly<br/>
compose those of living compounds. All the<br/>
wonderful forms of such living matter as the<br/>
flavors of jellies and the odors of flowers, the<br/>
leaves and roots, the bones, muscles, nerves,<br/>
and brains, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>combinations of these few simples. Yet the difference between living and<br/>
inert compounds depends upon the way in<br/>
which molecular elements group themselves.<br/>
We can picture an army of molecules as a<br/>
mass of soldiers in "irregular formation."<br/>
A command flies from the general to every<br/>
individual soldier. In a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flash</span>, we see a solid<br/>
front, ready to attack; or a hollow square,<br/>
ready for defence; or a column, ready to defile<br/>
through a mountain pass. The molecular<br/>
"grouping" is obedient to an electrical balancing between negative and positive that picks<br/>
them up as chaff before the wind, and whirls<br/>
them into spheres of action as beautiful in<br/>
equilibrium as the play of the planets around<br/>
the sun, and in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Chemists had believed that the power to so<br/>
combine inert into living matter lay in an<br/>
unknown, mysterious influence called "the<br/>
vital force." Rather concisely stated, we<br/>
might say that all vital growth and action are<br/>
founded on chemical stimulation-ultimately<br/>
electrical; that what looks like the hand of<br/>
Providence mysteriously guiding the unintelligent cells, the brainless plants, the wholly<br/>
inexperienced and helpless new-born mind,<br/>
the homing pigeon-what we call "instinct"<br/>
---is but the expression of certain chemical and<br/>
electrical forces, the unconscious response of<br/>
certain appetites to particular stimulants.<br/>
Snyder has interestingly explained the operation of these forces in the following statement:<br/>
<br/>
"A flower standing in a room turns its petals towards the<br/>
light. To the birds we ascribe intelligence, to the flower<br/>
no more than the attraction of light. Yet it seems as if<br/>
the selfsame forces rule over both. When the new-born<br/>
caterpillar climbs to the end of a branch where it may find<br/>
the fresh bud on which it feeds, it seems as if some dim<br/>
intelligence were at work. When it is satisfied, it climbs<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">down </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">again</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A fly will lay its eggs in meat, whereon its<br/>
larvae may feed, but not on fat<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
