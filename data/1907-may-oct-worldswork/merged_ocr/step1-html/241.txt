<span>THE SOUTH AS A FIELD FOR INVESTMENT<br/>
<br/>
Roughly speaking, the security behind a<br/>
bond depends upon the amount of net earnings<br/>
available to pay the interest on the bond. It<br/>
may be noted in the table that the "charges"<br/>
on the Southern roads are but 55% of the net<br/>
earnings, while on the New England and<br/>
Middle-Western roads they are 62% and on<br/>
the Southwestern they are 72%.<br/>
<br/>
The fact of the matter seems to be not so<br/>
much that the bonds of the Southern companies are badly secured, judged in this way,<br/>
as that the general impression gained from a<br/>
study of the roads is that they are weak in their<br/>
power to earn money. With the exception<br/>
of the Louisville & Nashville and the Norfolk<br/>
& Western, there are no large systems in the<br/>
South that earn $ 3,000 per mile, net. Almost<br/>
every road of importance in the East and in<br/>
the Middle West earns more than this.<br/>
<br/>
If the general run of Southern bonds be safe,<br/>
then here are more bargains than in any other<br/>
section of the Union. If they be not safe, then<br/>
here is a great danger to be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
Using the statistics as a basis, the verdict is<br/>
favorable. Going on from this point, the<br/>
favorable impression strengthens. The real<br/>
influence against these bonds has been, undoubtedly, the slow, reluctant, hesitating<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">growth </span>of the Southern States. But to-day,<br/>
the growth is not slow nor hesitating. There<br/>
have been years of uncertainty, years when<br/>
it looked as though every road in the South<br/>
was born to bankruptcy-but those years seem<br/>
past, as the story of the South unfolds to-day.<br/>
<br/>
In the narrow field of Southern railroad<br/>
bonds, generally speaking, it is safe to invest.<br/>
No bond that is a first-mortgage on a road in<br/>
Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, the Carolinas,<br/>
or Virginia need be questioned, provided the<br/>
road is already built.<br/>
<br/>
In special classes of bonds, we should select<br/>
terminal issues in the great cities, in preference<br/>
to any of the bonds of the South. The railroad centres are well-defined, and no hesitation<br/>
need be felt about legally-drawn bonds on<br/>
terminals in Baltimore, Birmingham, Atlanta,<br/>
Richmond, New Orleans, Nashville, Chattanooga, Charleston, or any other central distributing city of the South.<br/>
<br/>
Railroad stocks are quite another matter.<br/>
There are few such stocks in the South that can<br/>
be classed. as really high-class for the average<br/>
investor who must have a definite certainty<br/>
of dividends. Norfolk & Western preferred,<br/>
Louisville & Nashville, Atlantic Coast Line,<br/>
<br/>
9039<br/>
<br/>
Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis are good<br/>
stocks, but the very prosperity that lies upon<br/>
the roads is more or less of a threat to the<br/>
dividends. It looks to-day as though the<br/>
Louisville & Nashville must be considered a<br/>
safe, conservative 7% stock; but even so, it<br/>
is not beyond speculative influences.<br/>
<br/>
The municipal bonds of the South yield<br/>
larger revenue than similar bonds in most other<br/>
regions of the country. They should be<br/>
bought with the nicest discrimination. Such<br/>
of them as come to New York are carefully<br/>
examined by the bankers, and there are undoubtedly some bargains among them. They<br/>
should be bought only through thoroughly<br/>
reputable and high-grade bankers, who have<br/>
the proper machinery for testing them before<br/>
they are offered.<br/>
<br/>
Many hundreds of millions of dollars have<br/>
been poured into the South in the past five<br/>
years to finance coal mines, iron mills, chemical<br/>
companies, and other industrial enterprises.<br/>
A very large part of this expenditure is now<br/>
paying a good return on the investment<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Quite<br/>
lately there has been a tendency to re-finance<br/>
a lot of these enterprises, watering them freely<br/>
and selling the new stocks and bonds to the<br/>
public. This tendency is likely to resume at<br/>
the next period of great Wall Street activity.<br/>
<br/>
The public at large should not be tempted<br/>
into these enterprises. If a business man cares<br/>
to invest his money in Southern enterprise,<br/>
the field is a good, legitimate, and highly remunerative one. It is not, however, a field into<br/>
which the average non-resident investor can<br/>
afford to put his money.<br/>
<br/>
Industrial companies that have been formed<br/>
at a distance to exploit enterprises in the South<br/>
are-as a rule-likely to be on a speculative<br/>
basis; and their stocks and bonds, however<br/>
alluring, ought to be bought with exceeding<br/>
care. Many of these companies are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Over-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">capitalized </span>and some of them have the disadvantage of non-resident control and management. These afford, as a rule, the kind<br/>
of investments that only the daring or the<br/>
exceedingly well-informed ought to indulge in.<br/>
<br/>
But the South affords a rich field for investment by men who go with their money and<br/>
themselves manage the industries that they<br/>
invest in. In a word, it is a region for the<br/>
working investor; and, if the business or<br/>
enterprise be well-chosen and well-managed,<br/>
money will double itself there in a little while.<br/>
For instance, in recent years the cotton mills<br/>
