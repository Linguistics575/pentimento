<span>9028 A JOURNEY THROUGH<br/>
yield sufficient dividends on its value with a<br/>
business population only <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>or six deep.<br/>
<br/>
I know of no happier men than those who<br/>
regard their homes as the most attractive<br/>
places in the world, provided their homes are<br/>
attractive, their occupations are prosperous,<br/>
and their lives are not narrowed. This opinion<br/>
is firmly fixed in the minds of the people of<br/>
Montgomery and in the minds of the prosperous<br/>
farmers who live in the country round about.<br/>
I heard a man boast of abandoning politics to<br/>
cultivate alfalfa and, since he has been successful in both pursuits, you are obliged to share<br/>
his enthusiasm for his change of occupations.<br/>
<br/>
As in Columbus the foremost citizen of the<br/>
town is chairman of the school board, so in<br/>
Montgomery a public-spirited man of fortune,<br/>
Dr. B. J. Baldwin, has for many years held<br/>
this post-with enthusiasm. Such facts give a<br/>
cue to the civic character of many <span style="color: #0000FF;">Southern </span>men.<br/>
<br/>
You will find men, without looking far or<br/>
long, in almost every Southern community<br/>
who will give you a personal experience similar to this, given by Mr. Benjamin <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boswith<br/>
</span>Smith, an architect in Montgomery, who has<br/>
a farm in the country nearby, which he works<br/>
himself. Mr. Smith is a native of Kentucky,<br/>
a graduate of Princeton College, and a man<br/>
who has traveled much and has lived in several<br/>
parts of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
"I have resided eight years in Montgomery, locating<br/>
here after much travel and mature consideration, not only<br/>
on account of exceptional business advantages and <span style="color: #0000FF;">outlook </span>in the city of Montgomery, but on account of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>farming lands surrounding the city on every<br/>
<br/>
THE SOUTHERN STATES<br/>
<br/>
side. My faith was pinned to the prairie land here<br/>
because not only could all crops raised on the other lands<br/>
be raised here, but it is in my estimation the most wonderful grass land in the world."<br/>
<br/>
Then he goes on to tell how from <span style="color: #0000FF;">hayJohnson </span>grass, Bermuda grass and alfalfa--cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, peas, turnips<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, etc., etc., he made a net profit of $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,860<br/>
</span>on his 180 acres and ditched and fenced and<br/>
raised hogs to boot; how he expects to make<br/>
$ 4,000 net when he has it all in good order.<br/>
And he adds:<br/>
<br/>
"Anything that will grow anywhere else on earth will<br/>
yield <span style="color: #0000FF;">bountifully </span>here if properly attended to. I consider<br/>
the climate the finest, at least in this continent, way ahead<br/>
of California.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>have done the above with incompetent Negro labor.<br/>
I will pay a good German or Swede foreman a good salary<br/>
and give him perquisites that will make his home ideal if<br/>
he will drift this way. Negroes are fine cotton makers if<br/>
they will work, but they will not work. They know nothing but cotton. Our soil cries aloud for proper tillage.<br/>
It is the finest soil I have ever seen and, briefly, the man<br/>
who cannot make more than a competence on 60 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">160<br/>
</span>acres is either too lazy to work or a fool. Laziness, lack<br/>
of initiation, lack of application, is our curse in agricultural<br/>
matters. With energy, application, study, and the love<br/>
of the profession of agriculture, I firmly believe the <span style="color: #0000FF;">agricultural </span>output of Montgomery County, Ala., will greatly<br/>
exceed the output of any section on earth for the same<br/>
acreage. We have as fine lands as anywhere in the world<br/>
and our growing season extends from March <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist </span>to Nov.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist</span>, eight months. I can raise three crops on any piece<br/>
of land I have, barring the raising of cotton.<br/>
<br/>
"Last, but not least, I can always <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>a ready market<br/>
for everything I grow at good Prices."<br/>
<br/>
THE SEABOARD SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
T WOULD be an incalculable gain if<br/>
men's conceptions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">South-especially </span>of the lowland <span style="color: #0000FF;">South-could </span>now be<br/>
made anew and made directly from facts and<br/>
not from traditions or old memories. The<br/>
tourist <span style="color: #0000FF;">sees </span>post-card pictures of old "mammies" (the "mammy" is practically a defunct<br/>
institution), of an old Negro <span style="color: #0000FF;">man </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>rags driving<br/>
an ox, of a little grinning Sambo eating a watermelon, of a former slave cabin, and the like.<br/>
The railroads run, of course, along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">barrenest<br/>
</span>ridges of land, for good engineering reasons;<br/>
and the tourist hotels keep the grotesque things<br/>
in sight. The literature about Southern life<br/>
that has made the deepest impression is either<br/>
<br/>
the literature of the era of slavery, or of the<br/>
era of war, or the romances which have to do<br/>
with these periods; and the people of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bestknown </span>books about the South are either the<br/>
heroes of aristocratic origin, or the poor devils<br/>
whose origin was unknown. Some of the<br/>
Southern folk themselves, too, think of the land<br/>
and of themselves, and of other folk, less by<br/>
fact than by traditions, most of which are exaggerated and some of which are altogether<br/>
untrue.<br/>
<br/>
The effect of these ludicrous misconceptions<br/>
is a real hindrance to knowledge and a check to<br/>
growth. Most persons, for example, think of<br/>
the south-Atlantic coast cities as <span style="color: #0000FF;">unhealthful</span>.<br/>
