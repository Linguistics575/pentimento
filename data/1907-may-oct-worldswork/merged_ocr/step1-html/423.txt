The men who plan all these things and the<br/>
men who do them lead lives far different from<br/>
the life of the ordinary man. Unluckily, it<br/>
has come to be recognized almost as a convention that the railroad camp pushing the<br/>
lines in the West need have no morals. The<br/>
prairie sections of the Canadian Pacific were<br/>
built without the usual accompaniment of rum,<br/>
immorality, and crime, but the bars were let<br/>

down in the mountain sections. On our own<br/>
roads it was uniformly bad.<br/>
<br/>
It took two years and a half to build the<br/>
Canadian Pacific through the Fraser River<br/>
Canyon. In that construction, thirty-two men<br/>
lost their lives through accident. No one has<br/>
ever dared to compute the number of men that<br/>
paid with their lives for the riot <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>vice of the<br/>
railroad camps, but it is conceded that the work<br/>
of the building was not half so disastrous as the<br/>
"pleasure" of the idle days and nights. A<br/>
blow came to follow a word, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flash </span>of a<br/>
knife or the crack of a pistol came to follow the<br/>
blow. Graves, unnumbered and nameless,<br/>
<br/>
mark the path of the pioneer railroads through<br/>
the great mountains.<br/>

It is little <span style="color: #0000FF;">better </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>than it was in the<br/>
