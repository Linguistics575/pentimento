<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SHE </span>tendency of the present day is <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
</span>classify; the general public <span style="color: #ff0000;">insists<br/>
</span>that nationalities be listed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
</span>primers as white or yellow or <span style="color: #ff0000;">black-war-like<br/>
<br/>
</span>or peaceful, commercial or artistic. Time has<br/>
scarcely changed the old copybook axioms<br/>
which summed up the character of a people <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>a few words of light up-strokes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">heavy<br/>
</span>downward <span style="color: #0000FF;">ones-vie </span>French are a <span style="color: #0000FF;">gay<br/>
</span>people, fond of dancing"; "the English are<br/>
gloomy and devoted to trade." To-day we<br/>
ask, in curiosity and alarm, "What are <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Japanese?" The answer might, at this <span style="color: #0000FF;">moment</span>, be given in these words: "The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Japan<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ese </span>are a proud people upon whom we forced<br/>
our acquaintance, but to whom we are not at<br/>
home when they return the call."<br/>
<br/>
Our relations with the Island Empire began<br/>
with such an appearance of good will on our<br/>
part that it is a little <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>for us to treat<br/>
these people as an accident now. We have<br/>
forgotten the blare of trumpets with which the<br/>
invasion of Japan was accompanied, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sounding </span>phrases which told us-and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">invaded</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>here was a people sitting in darkness, to<br/>
whom we would bring a great light. Christian commercialism and commercial Christianity were the two forces which were to raise<br/>
a sunken nation to the light of day; <span style="color: #0000FF;">commerce </span>and evangelization were to dance, hand<br/>
in hand, over a reclaimed and grateful country,<br/>
ready to develop obediently and exclusively<br/>
along the lines of convenience and advantage<br/>
to its discoverers.<br/>
<br/>
SELF-RESPECT DEGENERATING INTO CONCEIT<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese are at present going through<br/>
the wholesome discipline of disillusionment and<br/>
the effect will be lasting and profound. The<br/>
truth is that America and Japan first drew<br/>
together on the strength of idealized qualities<br/>
which were superficial in both-gallant benevolence and disinterestedness on one side; <span style="color: #ff0000;">plia<br/>
</span>bility, chivalry, and romance on the other.<br/>
Such a union is like the marriage of two sentimental young people who have fallen in love<br/>
at first sight. There will be no lasting tie <span style="color: #0000FF;">be</span>,<br/>
tween them until their flimsy ideals are <span style="color: #0000FF;">shattered </span>and they can take stock of the really good<br/>
qualities existing in each, and agree to make<br/>
the best of their common heritage in that sadly<br/>
mixed material, humanity. And the fibre of<br/>
humanity is a web woven of many strands,<br/>
sometimes working out in strange patterns.<br/>
The colors which make such a brave show on<br/>
the right side are but slightly discernible on the<br/>
reverse. The fundamental threads of human<br/>
existence are self-preservation and self-respect,<br/>
and they must be evenly balanced. Character<br/>
is not built on emotions, and great nations are<br/>
not the offspring of enthusiasms.<br/>
<br/>
Japan has suffered in the past from having<br/>
balanced ill between the claims of self-respect<br/>
and self-preservation. For two long centuries the nation worshipped little besides its<br/>
own pride. The exclusion of foreigners and<br/>
the prohibition of travel became a dogma of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">self-sufficiency</span>; the people took it to mean<br/>
that the Japanese were so immeasurably<br/>
superior to all other races that any commerce<br/>
with others meant degradation. Previous to<br/>
and during the seclusion of Japan, the opinions<br/>
of the lower classes counted for nothing; they<br/>
could claim few rights, except those of protection, from their feudal lords; and, to all<br/>
intents and purposes, the nobles and their<br/>
military followers constituted the nation. A<br/>
noble pride became the acknowledged motive<br/>
of action; it took many admirable <span style="color: #0000FF;">shapes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-it </span>inspired valor, self-restraint, a horror of<br/>
ostentation, a simplicity of living, and a consideration for others which are still the <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinguishing </span>characteristics of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>best Japanese.<br/>
But in time this great quality developed into a<br/>
monstrous Juggernaut to which life and all<br/>
that makes life worth living had to be sacrificed<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
