<span>IMMIGRATION TO THE SOUTH<br/>
<br/>
THE PRESSING DEMAND FOR MORE WHITE LABOR ON THE<br/>
<br/>
FARM AND IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MILLS-THE<br/>
<br/>
</span>ing of new economic forces in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>South than the practically universal<br/>
cry for immigrants; for, until recently, the<br/>
Southern people did not care for newcomers<br/>
and made no systematic or earnest effort to<br/>
secure them. But now, from Virginia to<br/>
Texas, domestic servants, mill operatives, farm<br/>
hands, skilled laborers, or small farmers-or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">all-sire </span>in demand. The new era of industry<br/>
has revealed a scarcity of workers in every<br/>
department of work. It is estimated that<br/>
20 per cent. of the spindles in the Southern<br/>
mills are idle for the lack of operatives. There<br/>
are regions where the ripe cotton was not picked<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>last fall for the sheer lack of men,<br/>
women, or children to gather it; and the area<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tilled </span>land would be increased if there were<br/>
men to work it. A gentleman in Savannah who<br/>
was coming to New York, a month ago, was<br/>
accosted at the station by a railroad contractor<br/>
in these words: <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>John, for the love of Heaven,<br/>
see if you can't get me three hundred <span style="color: #0000FF;">men-Dagos </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">anybody-to </span>shovel dirt. I don't<br/>
know what <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>am going to do!"<br/>
<br/>
You ask, "Where are all the Negroes?" and<br/>
you find an apparent mystery. There are<br/>
more Negroes in the South to-day than there<br/>
ever were before. Yet one man will tell you<br/>
that they have surely gone away from his community. Another-many <span style="color: #0000FF;">others-ull </span>tell you<br/>
that more of them are idle than formerly,<br/>
that the number has increased of those who will<br/>
work only two or three or four days a week.<br/>
"They get just enough to live on. Then they<br/>
loaf." But you do not see as many standing or<br/>
loafing at railroad stations or on the streets of<br/>
the towns as you might have seen ten years ago.<br/>
<br/>
The fundamental truth is, the demand for<br/>
labor of all sorts has increased till it has far<br/>
outgrown the number of workers of both races.<br/>
A new pace in work has been set, and the man,<br/>
white or black, whose idleness caused no <span style="color: #0000FF;">comment </span>ten years ago is now a burden and a<br/>
reproach.<br/>
<br/>
A definite campaign to promote immigration<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">MILLS-THE </span>KIND <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>MEN WANTED<br/>
<br/>
has been earnestly begun in most of the states.<br/>
Mr. E. J. Watson, the Commissioner for South<br/>
Carolina, last fall induced the North German<br/>
Lloyd Steamship Company to bring more<br/>
than 400 immigrants to Charleston. Five<br/>
hundred and seventy-five were booked, but on<br/>
the morning when many of the Belgian families<br/>
were to start, the local papers printed in glaring headlines the news of the Atlanta riot and<br/>
a hundred of them refused to go. The cost<br/>
of their coming was paid mainly by a fund of<br/>
$ 20,000 raised by the manufacturers and given<br/>
to the state for this purpose. Out of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">grew </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>long controversy, with which the public is<br/>
familiar, and which is not yet ended. It will<br/>
probably end in a decision that a state may<br/>
bring in assisted immigrants without violating<br/>
the contract-labor clause of the immigration<br/>
law. At any rate, Commissioners of several<br/>
states recently went abroad to secure <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigrants </span>for the South, including Governor Smith<br/>
of Georgia and Mr. P. H. Gadsden of South<br/>
Carolina. Mr. Watson is also in Europe to<br/>
make arrangements <span style="color: #ff0000;">for </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>permanent line from<br/>
Bremen to Charleston.<br/>
<br/>
The Southern Commissioners meet with<br/>
unexpected and even amazing difficulties in<br/>
Europe. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>that maps of the United<br/>
States have been distributed which have vast<br/>
areas of the South printed in yellow, indicating<br/>
the "yellow-fever <span style="color: #0000FF;">belt</span>," and other areas in<br/>
black indicating regions where white men do<br/>
not and cannot live; and some Southern Commissioners have been asked in Europe if newcomers are not enslaved in the South. The<br/>
task, therefore, of quickly turning a strong tide<br/>
Southward is not so easy as it ought to be.<br/>
There are purely artificial as well as traditional objections to overcome.<br/>
<br/>
The immigrants that are most wanted are<br/>
native-born farm hands and mill hands, but<br/>
American farm hands are scarce everywhere,<br/>
for the capable <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>soon become farmers.<br/>
A very large number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons-families<br/>
</span>are going from the North-Central and the<br/>
Northwestern States into the South; but, as<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
