<span>THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD<br/>
<br/>
greatest <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfection-what </span>he thought. "I would<br/>
not stake my reputation answering that for anything you could give mc," he answered. "It<br/>
may be a black fox with the hairs turned silver<br/>
by the intense cold; or a black fox caught<br/>
when it is turning gray from old age; or a fox<br/>
just nipped by the trap at the moment when<br/>
his coat is affected by the season, summer coat<br/>
turning winter, winter coat turning summer.<br/>
But," he added, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>wouldn't stake my <span style="color: #ff0000;">rcputation </span>on any of these theories. I tell you it's<br/>
pure guess. All I'm dead sure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">is-silver<br/>
</span>fox is not <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>species."<br/>
<br/>
I told this to a trapper, who has probably<br/>
trapped more silver fox than anyone else in the<br/>
Canadian Northwest, from whom I hold a<br/>
photo showing some scores of silver foxes in<br/>
his warerooms and who is now a member of<br/>
a company that annually sells 600 silver fox.<br/>
"Those scientists are all wrong. They don't<br/>
know a thing about it. It is a species; <span style="color: #0000FF;">it's<br/>

</span>MR. THEODORE <span style="color: #0000FF;">REVILLON </span>IN THE FIELD<br/>
Even the heads of the great fur houses spend much time in the wilds<br/>
<br/>
a distinct kind. The fact that a silver fox<br/>
may have a litter of puppies in which there are<br/>
cross and red foxes, as well as silver, <span style="color: #ff0000;">doesn't<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">disproveit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">any </span>more than a dog's having <span style="color: #0000FF;">puppies </span>of half a dozen colors."<br/>
<br/>
An interesting experiment is now being conducted by Revillon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Freres</span>, of Paris, on a rocky<br/>
island off Labrador-a silver fox farm. Only<br/>
silver foxes are on the island. There is contact with no other species, and yet the rascals<br/>
upset theory and practice by continuing to have<br/>
puppies of red and cross along with the silver.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>But the way we explain that," said the manager, "is the way you would explain a blueeyed child born in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">black-eyed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">family </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">something </span>inherited from ancestors of a generation<br/>
or two back." This much only can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>said<br/>
definitely of silver fox-it is never found but in<br/>
a cold climate, Labrador or the far North. Its<br/>
feet are fur-padded-the unfailing sign of the<br/>
animal of a frozen <span style="color: #0000FF;">clime</span>. Two thousand a<br/>

year, it is said, are sold in London for the<br/>
European markets. Curiously enough, on the<br/>
opposite side of America is another island given<br/>
up to fox farming. On one of the Aleutians,<br/>
off Alaska, is a blue fox farm. Cross fox also<br/>
presents a moot point. Whether it is so named<br/>
because it is considered to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>a cross, or because of the brownish-black mark between its<br/>
shoulders, is not known. Another curious<br/>
point in fox life is that the best fox skins in the<br/>
world come from Labrador and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kamchatka<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span>bleak, desolate, rocky, fog-engirt <span style="color: #0000FF;">peninsulas </span>jutting out into a <span style="color: #0000FF;">storm-beaten </span>eastern<br/>
sea. Another distinction about fox skins is<br/>
that blue is always blue, summer and winter,<br/>
in Alaska; but the Arctic fox of the same<br/>
region turns bluish drab in summer. A fine<br/>
Labrador cross fox may be <span style="color: #ff0000;">doctorcd </span>with<br/>
chemicals to look like silver; but a gray fox of<br/>
Labrador or a blue of Alaska cannot be "<span style="color: #ff0000;">chemicalcd</span>" into a silver. Of other foxes, more<br/>
need not <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>said than that they are sold at the<br/>
three great world-markets in millions and<br/>
yield one of the biggest fur crops to every part<br/>
of the United States. To the Leipsic and<br/>
Nijni sales yearly come <span style="color: #0000FF;">200,000 </span>English fox,<br/>
200,000 Siberian, 500,000 German, 300,000<br/>
Russian from other parts than Siberia, 90,000<br/>
American red fox, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>over 50,000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alaskan<br/>
