</span>Isaiah T. Montgomery<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>who was <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>a slave belonging to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>brother of Jefferson Davis<br/>
<br/>
but their good will and their forethought have<br/>
made the success of Mound Bayou possible.<br/>
As the colony grows older and the life of the<br/>
<br/>
A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES<br/>
<br/>
community becomes more complicated, new<br/>
<br/>
problems present themselves to the men<br/>
who are still planning and directing its<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
The success of the present community has<br/>
suggested the formation of others similar to<br/>
this one. Already there are the beginnings of<br/>
such communities at other points above and<br/>
below Mound Bayou. Mr. Montgomery believes that the success of these new <span style="color: #0000FF;">communities</span>, as well as the future of the Mound Bayou<br/>
colony, depends largely upon the ability of the<br/>
new generation, now growing up, to profit by<br/>
the experience of the older. It is with this<br/>
idea that he and his associates are even now<br/>
studying out a scheme by which the work of<br/>
the schools can be brought into closer touch<br/>
with the actual work of the colony.<br/>
<br/>
"What we need," said Mr. Montgomery,<br/>
"is an agricultural school, something that<br/>
will <span style="color: #ff0000;">teach </span>the young men to be better farmers<br/>
than their fathers have been. But, more than<br/>
that, we need here a system of education that<br/>
will teach our young men and women the<br/>
underlying meaning of the work that is being<br/>
done here. In some way they must be taught<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">importance </span>of carrying forward this experiment in the spirit in which it was begun.<br/>
<br/>
.The problem of education is at present the<br/>
<br/>
most important which the town and the colony<br/>
of Mound Bayou have to solve."<br/>
