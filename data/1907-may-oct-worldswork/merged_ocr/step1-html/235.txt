many ways like a new land. It has all the<br/>
opportunities of a new and undeveloped land<br/>
with the additional advantages of an old one.<br/>

</span>Little strips and particular places in Florida<br/>
have become known by the visits of great numbers of health and pleasure seekers, especially<br/>
along the chain of the great Flagler hotels.<br/>
Mr. Flagler, by the way, has done more to<br/>
make the state known, perhaps, than any other<br/>
man ever did to make any other state known.<br/>
An increasing number of visitors who go for<br/>
health remain there. But, in spite of this great<br/>
stream of travel in the winter and of the work<br/>
of exploitation done by the railroad systems,<br/>
Florida is yet not only undeveloped-it is<br/>
almost unknown, and much of it has hardly<br/>
been explored. If you will remember what<br/>
drainage and artesian wells will do for a low<br/>
country, you will be able to think of this marvelous peninsula as capable of maintaining as<br/>
large a population as now live in any two or<br/>
three Southern States.<br/>
<br/>
An era of definite industrial activity has<br/>
begun with great vigor. Jacksonville was<br/>
rebuilt after the blessing of a disastrous fire in<br/>
1901, rebuilt as a healthful industrial city.<br/>
The 2,600 buildings that were burned were<br/>
valued at $ 15,000,000; the 6,350 that have<br/>
since been built are valued at $ 27,500,000.<br/>
This is the great distributing place for the whole<br/>
peninsula and this fact (apart from its manufactures and tourist business) is making it an<br/>
important city and will make it a large city.<br/>
<br/>
Of the truck farming-such figures as these<br/>
(for the crop of 1905) <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>simply wearisome, significant as they are of wealth-earning:<br/>
Of two minor crops, tomatoes brought a<br/>
million and a quarter dollars, and celery more<br/>
than a third of a million-an average for celery<br/>
of $ 1,300 an acre. The best examples of<br/>
outdoor intensive farming in the East may be<br/>
found on some of these truck farms. A Jerseyman who makes $ 1,500 a year on his home<br/>
farm of considerable acreage goes to a small<br/>
town in Florida in winter for his health. He<br/>
plants the back of his town lot in celery and<br/>
gets $ 2,500 for his winter crop. The orange<br/>
and grape-fruit crop yields more than three<br/>
millions of dollars a year; pineapples and<br/>
strawberries each $ 600,000; and all vegetables<br/>
nearly 4 millions-a total of about 8 millions<br/>
of dollars a year from fruit and vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
The turpentine workers and the lumbermen<br/>
are working (and depleting) the pine forests;<br/>
but the enormous wealth of the hardwoods<br/>
of the state has yet hardly been touched. The<br/>
state has 200 varieties of trees--<span style="color: #0000FF;">47 </span>per cent.<br/>
bf all varieties found in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The general activity of the cities is indicated<br/>
by the increase in the number of banks since<br/>
1902 from 46 (with 14 millions of deposits) to<br/>
106 in 1906 (more than 32 millions of deposits).<br/>
But the area of activity is yet a very small<br/>
area. The state is the largest <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>of the<br/>
Mississippi River. The distance from the<br/>
western extremity of the state to its <span style="color: #0000FF;">southernmost </span>extremity is almost as great as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">distance<br/>
</span>from Jacksonville to New York, or as the distance<br/>
from New York to Chicago. The state has 1,200<br/>
miles of coast, and it has 42 rivers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1801akes<br/>
</span>of considerable size and a much larger number of<br/>
small ones. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>its 34 millions of acres (not<br/>
counting more than 3,000,000 acres under<br/>
water) only 5 millions are "farm lands," only<br/>
a part of which is really cultivated. In the<br/>
well-drained regions, vital statistics show a<br/>
lower death rate than Massachusetts or New<br/>
York or Philadelphia.<br/>
<br/>
Key West, with the marine railroad built to<br/>
it, will lie on the quickest route to Havana.<br/>
Tampa, on the Gulf coast, is an exceedingly<br/>
energetic city. The basis of its prosperity<br/>
was its cigar factories, of which there are<br/>
more than 150; but it has rapidly developed<br/>
other industries also. In and around the city,<br/>
including the suburban places, the local estimate<br/>
now is of a population of 41,000. It had less<br/>
than 6,000 people in 1890. Nearly 1,000<br/>
ocean-going vessels a year are required to do<br/>
its trade. The people are making money and<br/>
enjoying themselves, extending the city, <span style="color: #0000FF;">building </span>beautiful homes, feeling proud of themselves, and enjoying life. And within the<br/>
last five years, "Tampa has doubled all the<br/>
essentials of a city."<br/>
<br/>
Or consider the growth of Pensacola, whose<br/>
export business has grown five-fold in ten<br/>
years. Cotton stood first-almost IO million<br/>
dollars' worth; then lumber and tobacco and<br/>
rosin and phosphate rock-this because of its<br/>
excellent harbor, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">enough </span>in depth and in<br/>
expanse to anchor all the navies of the world."<br/>
The city bonds, issued for public improvements, have been sold at a premium;<br/>
and the people are building bank buildings<br/>
(one of marble), big business structures, clubs,<br/>
residences. It is a pleasant place to go or to<br/>
<br/>
