</span>A GENERAL VIEW <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>MOUND BAYOU, SHOWING THE RAILROAD STATION<br/>
<br/>
In the foreground, on the right, are Isaiah <span style="color: #0000FF;">T. </span>Montgomery and the town constable<br/>
<br/>
returned to the plantation and in 1866 put<br/>
himself in communication with Mr. Davis.<br/>
Very soon they had perfected plans with him<br/>
for the purchase of the Hurricane and Brier<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>held plantations, containing something like<br/>
4,000 acres of land, upon which the elder<br/>
Montgomery and his sons, under the name of<br/>
Montgomery & Sons, conducted the third<br/>
largest plantation in the state.<br/>
<br/>
It was the desire of Joseph Davis, after the<br/>
war, to keep together as far as possible the<br/>
slaves who had grown up on his plantations.<br/>
His notion was, no doubt, that the interests<br/>
of all concerned demanded that there should be<br/>
just as little break in the old relations as<br/>
possible and that the transition from slavery<br/>
to freedom should be made gradually, with<br/>
the idea that the freedmen should, however,<br/>
eventually become the owners of the land<br/>
upon which they had previously been slaves.<br/>
The plantations were conducted with this <span style="color: #0000FF;">end<br/>
</span>in view until 1880, when it became <span style="color: #0000FF;">apparent<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE BANK OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">JUND </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">UATOJ<br/>
<br/>
</span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Montgomerys </span>that unless there was a<br/>
modification of the terms upon which the project had been left to them after Joseph Davis's<br/>
death, it would be impossible to succeed. The<br/>
heirs could not agree to an alteration in<br/>
terms, and so the scheme was <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">abancloned</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It was with the same notion of carrying out,<br/>
under new conditions, the plan which his<br/>
father and his former master had formed<br/>
years before, that, in 1887, Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Montgomery-as </span>he says in a brief <span style="color: #ff0000;">autoloiogmphy-</span>" sought<br/>
to begin anew, at the age of forty, the dream<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span>'s young manhood," the dream of doing<br/>
something to build up the fortunes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>race.<br/>
It thus appears that the history of Mound<br/>
Bayou is deeply rooted in the past, and is,<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>certain sense, a carrying out <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>scheme<br/>
formulated by the elder <span style="color: #0000FF;">Montgomery </span>and his<br/>
former master for the welfare of that master's<br/>
former slaves. Others than were <span style="color: #ff0000;">intonded<br/>
</span>have become heirs to the plans of these men<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
